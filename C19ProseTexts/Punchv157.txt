- IDEAL PREMIUM BONDS.
MR. Punch, SIR,-On reading the explanatory details of
the new Victory Loan it has pained me to note how little
imagination and knowledge of human nature has been
shown by the financial advisers of the Government. The
THE RAILWAY TRANSPORT OFFICER.
WHEREveR on England's business bent her far-flung
forces go,
If only a couple of tempy subs and privates a score or so,
Slme decorates one with tabs and swish and calls him an
R.T.O.
Wherever the restless flag is flown, a challenge to fear
and foe, -
You'll find in château or schloss or tent or derelict truck
below,
To symbolise order and light and law, the sign of the R.T.O.
On every front in the dear old war, no matter how swift
the show,
No matter how far we hurried ahead we'd look to the rear,
and lo!
With tabs and polish and sign and swank there followed
the R.T.O.
So I, grown terribly sick of him—though a useful lad, I
know— --
Withdrew to a very exclusive war, preserved in the ice and
snow,
Where many degrees of frost might be, but never an R.T.O.
And what was my very first sight of land as we pushed
through the final floe,
And came to the quay where the walrus waits and the
penguins perch in a row 2
idea of the fifteen per cent. premium is undoubtedly good,
but it is expensive, and in my opinion it does not make a
sufficiently moving appeal to the aspirations of the British
race.
At very short notice, therefore, I have devised a scheme
whereby the subscriptions to the loan would be increased
beyond the dreams of the most avaricious Chancellor of
the Exchequer; and yet one which would cost the country
nothing at all.
My proposal briefly is that (if not too late) the loan
should be issued at a hundred per cent., and that an annual
draw should take place; but, instead of this being accom-
panied by any form of monetary premium, the fortunate
investors should receive social rather than financial ad-
vancement. The following table will readily explain my
meaning:—
Every investor whose bonds are drawn during the period
(1) 1920–1930 . to be elevated to the Peerage.
(2) 1930–1940 . . to receive a Baronetcy.
(3) 1940–1950 . . to receive a Knighthood.
(4) 1950–1960 ... to receive a C.B.E.
(5) 1960–1970 to receive an O.B.E.
(6) 1970–1980 to receive an M.B.E.
(7) 1980–1990 ... to become a gentleman by Act
of Parliament, with the pre-
rogative of adding “Esquire"
to his name.
I ask no reward whatsoever for this idea. I give it freely
to the country. My only request is that my own bonds be
included among those drawn in 1920.
Yours, etc.,
“EconoMY."
Our Official Naturalists.
From an official letter from the War Trade Department:—
“I am instructed by the Director of the War Trade Department to
A perfectly good, be-tabbed, be-furred and fatherly R.T.O.
request you to state if the pedigree colt is a shorthorn steer."

Colonel (explaining the War). “You see, THE TRouBLE ALL THROUGH THE WAR was THIs : THE ENEMY HAD THE INTERIOR LINEs.”
Intelligent listener. “BUT why DID we EveR LET HIM HAve THEM 2 WASN'T IT RATHER cARELEss of Us?”
WEDLOCK PRELIMINARIES.
“I’M going to get married,” said
Eustace.
“Who is the plucky lass?” I in-
quired politely.
“Well, as a matter of fact I haven't
mentioned it to her yet.”
“I should do that,” I said. “These
concealments at the outset only cause
unhappiness in after years. Besides, she
may want to buy confetti or a second-
hand slipper or something.”
“As a matter of fact I’ve only met
her once—at dinner,” he murmured.
“How thoroughly bizarre!” I ex-
claimed. “May I ask her name?”
“Dorothy.”
“‘Dora' for short. That makes it more
outré still. The other name hardly
matters, of course.” -
“Well, that's just the trouble,
really,” he confessed. “I've forgotten
the other name. I wrote it down on
the only piece of paper I had on me,
which happened to be a ten-shilling
note; and I gave it to the taxi-man
who took me home.”
“H'm, she'll get rather talked about
with John BRADBURY, won't she 2 ” I
said. “You didn't take the number of
the note by any chance?”
“No, nor of the cab either,” he ad-
mitted.
“You must call on her mother all
the same,” I said firmly. “The pro-
cedure to be adopted is this: You
walk straight up to the front-door,
avoiding the gate marked “No Hawkers'
(not that they 'd be very likely to take
you for a transatlantic flier, anyhow),
wipe your boots on the Salve, ring the
bell with a smart forward movement
of the right thumb, and ask the servant
whether the lady she helps is within.
Or it may be a butler. In that case
you say, ‘Is Mrs.”—and then make a
kind of gurgling noise somewhere be-
tween Parkinson and Featherstone-
haugh—‘at ‘home?' The rest is up
to you.”
“Yes, yes,” said Eustacerather testily.
“But how the deuce do I find out her
address 2'"
“I think you lack some of the neces-
sary grasp of detail,” I agreed. “How
about writing to your hostess? Quite
a short note would do. ‘Ref. your
Ration Issue of the inst. Kindly
repeat introduction to my right-hand
partner and state address in quintupli-
cate.' That will give you a chance of
losing a few copies, if she knows what
you mean.”
“But I didn't take her in to dinner at
all,” said Eustace. “I just talked to her
afterwards about theatres and pictures
and things.”
“You must have a complete nominal
roll of guests then,” I insisted, “with
several columns for particulars—size
of gloves, last vaccinated, next of kin,
favourite flowers and so on. I always
used to put down the favourite flowers
of my men in my platoon roll.”
“But there might be more than one
Dorothy,” he objected; “and besides
I only know my hostess very slightly
indeed.” -
“And by this time you've probably
forgotten her address too. There's
nothing for it, Eustace, but the Agony
Column of The Times. Passionate but
businesslike is the note.” And with
that I left him.
Six days later I found him sunk in
gloom.
“Did you use my idea?" I asked,
“I did,” he said shortly. “It was a
bad one. It had barnacles on it.”
“What did you write?”
“I wrote: ‘Will Dorothy who talked
to lonely demobilised officer about
theatres at dinner on the 14th inst. be
at the Albert Memorial at 11.30 A.M.
to-morrow 2'''
“You might have had another dinner
for the cost of that,” I said. “And was
there nothing doing?”
“It all depends on what you call
nothing,” said Eustace. “If you listen

Old Sinner. “TRUE 7 OF COURSE THEY wos TRUE. THAT’s wot I'M GRUMBLIN’ AT. WITH THE MATERIAL You 'Ad YoU ou GHT To
'AVE Told 'EM LIES A HUNDRED FATHOM LONG."
I'll tell you about it. I felt a bit doubtful
about the whole affair, so I approached
the trysting-place cautiously from the
far side of the Gardens and chose a
concealed position for reconnaissance.
I had taken the precaution to bring my
field-glasses with me x -
“And a protractor, Eustace. Surely
you didn't forget your protractor?"
“Don’t be frivolous. I took a good
look at the place from a considerable
distance away, and I tell you there
were about fifteen of them—falling in
two-deep they were. It was like a
moving flower-bed. I've never seen the
Albert Memorial looking so swish.”
“And wasn't she there 2"
“She wasn't,” said Eustace. “I sup-
pose I ought to have gone up to the
parade and listened to their complaints,
and thanked them for their services and
offered them pensions and so on. But
I hadn't the face to do it. I just slunk
off. And while I was slinking I quite
suddenly recollected a most extra-
ordinary and tragical thing.”
“Well ?”
“Why, her name wasn't Dorothy at
all. That was her younger sister. She
talked a lot about Dorothy that evening
and I mixed the two names up.”
“What two names 2"
“Well, I'm hanged if I can remem-
ber the other one now ; sometimes I
think it began with a W, and some-
times with a V, and then again it seems
to have been an H.”
“Eustace,” I said sternly, “I will tell
you what you are doing. You are tri-
fling with this young girl's affections.”
“Don’t say that,” he pleaded, “don’t
say that. But pending further details
I'm afraid the ceremony will have to
be postponed.” EvoB.

Gish, “The Beautiful Villain” (Cinema),
in The Daily Sketch :—
“I can speak perfectly correct English. I
take pride in being able to express my thoughts
with exactitude. (Mark the adjectives.) Few
can do this.”
We ourselves are of the many who
can’t. We have tried to mark the ad-
jectives and miserably failed.
THE CIRCUS.
CIRCUs! The gilded waggons; the
great tent blazing with light;
The scent of the trampled sawdust, and
“Three shilling seats to the right!”
A face that peers through the curtain
to see how the benches fill;
The rustle of feet in the gangways; the
old expectant thrill.
Out of the lost years' twilight, clad in
their spangles and gold,
Memory musters the riders that rode
in the rings of old—
Knights and jockeys and jesters, pie-
bald ponies and cream,
Fairies in satin and silver floating by
in a dream.
Does the circle seem to us smaller that
the cantering horses keep?
Are they holding the ribbons lower
where the glittering ladies leap”
Ah! well, there is one thing changeless
—the gods be praised for that—
The peal of a small boy's laughter when
the clown sits down on his hat.

WOULD BE 'APPY TO LEND YOU HIER GAME
THE KEEN BOY.
I Do not remember clearly how the
Keen Boy came to be taken on the
strength of my household. I think he
must have deliberately given me the
impression that he really belonged to
someone else, and that he was only
temporarily attached to me for rations.
Anyway, he came to be recognised as a
permanent member of the family, with
definite rights and privileges and, so
far as I know, no responsibilities. His
original deference to me as the head of
the house disappeared as he slowly
strengthened an alliance with my wiſe
and the cook, and in the end he adopted
an attitude of complete indifference to
my existence.
I do not know much about cats, but
am sure he was of a very lazy and
unemotional type, and I could never
understand why Cook named him the
Keen Boy. He had a kind expression
and widely-set grey eyes, and was
rather careless of his appearance. He
wore a detachable coat all the year
round and parts of it were often to be
found in inconvenient places. When
it suited his plans he sought admission
at inconvenient times with a quiet dig-
nity that disarmed criticism, and he
often forestalled me in my search for
some quiet place of Sunday retirement
in the house.
We never had mice until the Keen
Boy came to live with us. He seemed
to have some occult influence over them
and attracted them irresistibly. I do
not think he shared his food with them,
but he certainly allowed them to share
ours, and I believe he was a member
of their Union. They multiplied until
my wiſe had to make a loud noise
before entering an unoccupied room, al-
though she still maintained her faith
in the Keen Boy.
I was enabled to obtain a little cheese
out of bond, and with it I carefully
baited a mouse-trap, although I had
been at business during the day and
was considerably fatigued.
I slept little that night, and as I lay
awake in bed the thought came to me
that if by chance I should catch a
mouse the sight of it might arouse
some latent instinct in the breast of
the Keen Boy and help him to lead a
more useful life.
I was late for breakfast. As soon
as I saw my wife's morning face I knew
that I had caught a mouse. Cook had
just been in to announce the news.
Few words passed between us. Perhaps
our minds were elsewhere with my
wretched little captive. We were both
a little pale. Breakfast was scarcely
over before I rushed from the room,
still determined to carry out my plan.
My victim appeared to be fairly calm
and collected, but he was breathing
rather quickly and irregularly. He had
been unable to enjoy the price of his
liberty; the cheese lay disregarded near
his heaving flank.
I think I acted rather well in an
unusual crisis. Having shielded my
slightly unsteady hand with a towel I
carried the trap and its contents into
the garden, and was pleased to see that
‘the Keen Boy showed some interest
in the proceedings. He even followed
slowly behind me. -
The beautiful morning and all its
details are engraved indelibly on my
memory. Well do I remember the bud-
ding trees, the chirping sparrows, the
butcher's boy at my neighbour's gate,
the soft breeze that fanned my brow.
Nevertheless, taking myself in hand,
I chose a suitable spot, opened the
door of the trap and shook out the
contents in front of the cat.
The mouse, having taken its bearings,
ran slowly back into the house. The
Keen Boy, having seen it arrive safely,
proceeded to eat the cheese,
The German Ex-Crown Prince.
“Oh, Willie, we have missed you,” as
his Dutch guard might have said after
shooting at him if he had tried to escape.
“THE REST of THE NEWs.
King Alfonso is indisposed.
Veal is to be controlled again." -
Daily Paper.
The meat market seems very sensitive.

RED RUSSIA.
(By our Muscovite Expert).
IN his recent survey of operations on
the Western Front in Russia. Dr. HAR-
oLD WILLIAMs briefly describes the
position at Gulyai Pole, the head-
quarters of the bandit chief MAKHNo,
“who is a kind of simplified untheo-
retical Bolshevik with strongly de-
veloped pogrom propensities."
MAKHNo, however, is a negligible
factor in the enchevêtrement of the
Bolshevik kaleidoscope. As his name
implies he is probably of Scots origin,
and his simplicity renders him a much
less formidable antagonist than the
other bandit chiefs in the steppes.
Foremost amongst these is Panikin,
who is of mixed Chuvash and Kara-
kalpak ancestry. Panikin is described
by those who know him as an eminent-
ly synthetic Bolshevik, strongly resem-
bling CHALIAPIN; in physique, while in
mentality he approximates more closely
to TRotsky and Tchich ERIN. He is a
pronounced vegetarian with a strong
partiality for mutton chops, an ardent
devotee of the Doukhobor religion, and,
in view of his Semitic origin, of a
markedly anti-pogromistic tendency.
Secondly there is Bobolinsky, who
was formerly a secretary of M. Protopo-
poff and is now an agglutinative Berg-
sonian Bolshevik with pronounced lean-
ings towards Cretaceous, not to say
Jurassic and Post-Pliocene, Theosophy.
He amassed a large fortune as a railway
porter at Taganrog, and has long been
a prominent member of the anti-ablu-
tionist section of the fruitarian Men-
nonites of the Ukraine. His head-
quarters are uncertain, but he was last
seen moving in concentric circles in the
swampy plateaus of the Kola penin-
sula, accompanied by a body-guard of
amphibious Uzbegs, Tunguses and
Buriats. He is evidently a man to be
reckoned with, though he is known to
harbour strong conscientious objections
to tanks and aeroplanes. -
In view of the extraordinarily inter-
esting personalities of these leaders and
their varied and versatile equipment,
there is naturally a strong desire in the
best Pacifist circles to enter into friendly
negotiations with them and, if possible,
to induce them to settle in this country.
They are at present practically wasted
in a country depleted, depopulated and
devastated by their beneficent activi- |
ties. Here, on the other hand, there
is almost unlimited scope for their
powers of disintegrating reconstruction.

“HERE they are,” cried Margery,
and at the word she launched them
over the rampart of lumber which rests
for ever in the box-room.
“You are quite certain these are the
right things?” I asked.
“Of course.”
“Well, I don't remember this one.”
I held it up.
“That's my croquet mallet,” said
Margery; “I thought your golf-bag was
the safest place for it.”
I emptied the contents of the bag
upon the landing.
“They look very strange,” I remarked.
“I suppose they are golf-clubs. This
one looks like a rifle grenade.”

course was still there. We knew no-
thing further.
When we reached our objective the
first thing to be remarked was that the
tin pavilion had disappeared.
“I expect,” remarked Archibald,
“that the Government commandeered
it for dug-outs. Anyhow the course is
still here.”
“Where are the tee-boxes 2 " I said,
pointing to the first tee.
“Commandeered for canteen spit-
toons.” Archibald's common-law train-
ing is equal to any vulgar emergency.
“Come on,” he said, teeing up a new
ball on a worm cast; “let’s drive off.”
It was the best drive of the day. It
sailed long and low, and, rising towards
the end of its flight in the most ortho-
dox manner, cleared by fifty yards the
ridge of sand-duñes which intervened
The carry from the fifth tee is almost
mountainous. Archibald hit a nice
one, which cleared everything, whereas
I gave an exhibition of my famous
square-leg drive. So we parted com-
pany. It took me some time to find
my ball and play seven full niblick shots.
Then I climbed up the last ridge which
separated me from Archibald. I pictured
him, a somewhat impatient personality,
standing upon an emerald sward and
leaning negligently upon his brassie
while with a slightly contemptuous
eye he measured the distance to the
pin. But no
My first gasp on gaining the summit
was, “The lost pavilion l’ My second,
“All the lost pavilions!” There were
hundreds of them. True, some of them
were huts, while others were no mean
palaces, but there they were, all of

rupted; “you thought
it was the safest place.
Suppose you pick out
all the extras and leave
nothing but golf-clubs.
It might influence my
handicap for years if I
drove off with a patent
sketching stool.”
The following morn-
ing was strangely fa-
miliar. There was the
old pre-war feeling that
something was making
an early breakfastworth
while ; there was the
same look of resigna-
tion in Margery's eye,
the same feeling of de-
linquency as I crawled
stealthily into a cab,
and the same feeling
“GooD GRACIOUS, BOATMAN! WHAT's THAT’”
“OH, THAT'S ONE o' THEM GERMAN FLOATING MINEs, MUM.
WUD GET IN AN ORFUL ROW IF WE BUMPED UP AGIN IT."
them, a veritable town
of tin, cross-ruled with
streets, lanes and high-
ways.
It lay before me with-
out a sign of life, like
a city of the vanished
Incas. Yet somewhere,
lost in its deserted
midst, roamed Archi-
bald. In all probability
he was looking for a
ball. I slid down the
dune's steep side and
entered Bond Street.
I strolled down the
shady side, turned into
Piccadilly and crossed
into St. James's Street.
There was no sign of
Archibald; so I ven-
tured down the Rue
de Paris and emerged
ADMIRAL BEATTY
of untrammelled bliss as I entered the
railway carriage and shook off the
cobwebs of town.
Berrow Dunes golf course was really
discovered by Archibald and myself.
Of course it was laid out and had a
list of members and a tin pavilion and
all that when we first came upon it.
But it was never properly discovered
until we arrived. We found it a land
composed of mountains of sand and
rushes interspersed with comforting
areas of turf which has the colour of
a new billiard-cloth combined with the
resiliency of a profiteer's dining-room
carpet. I may say at once that the
pleasure of discovering a golf-links of
this kind is almost completely marred
by the necessity of suppressing all
knowledge of it.
Until the morning in question neither
Archibald nor myself had set foot in
this haven since July, 1914. From
time to time in different parts of the
world news had reached us that the
between us and the first patch of fair-
way.
“I ought to get up with a mashie,” he
murmured egotistically as he watched
me play my third on the wrong side of
the dunes.
Spurred on by the vision of a perfect
lie, Archibald was the first to reach the
crest of the ridge, and a strong word
was wafted down to me. I scrambled
after him and gazed down upon two
acres of derelict allotments.
After half-an-hour's fruitless seeking,
punctuated, on Archibald's part, by
some deplorable language, we adjourned
to the second tee. The next three holes
averaged thirty-five minutes a hole,
owing principally to the absence of the
fourth green.
“I can understand,” I expostulated,
“a thrifty Government utilising the
tee-boxes and the flag-pins and the
pavilion, but what on earth they
want with the fourth green I cannot
imagine.”
into Petticoat Lane.
It was here that the thought struck
me that the top of a sand-dune was,
after all, the right place to take a good
observation. I therefore retraced my
Rue de Paris and headed for Bond
Street again.
shock when I found myself once more
in Petticoat Lane. I had another try
and found myself there again.
Slightly unnerved I sat down beside
a tin pavilion. It was a poor sort of
finish, I thought, after four years' active
service. Perhaps some day, when pos-
terity revived an interest in the great
European War, I might be brought
to light again. Feebly I tried to
visualise the specimen label, “Remains,
probably human, belonging to the
Mustard Gas Period.”
Just at that moment Archibald came
round the corner.
“Hello,” he said in an unfriendly
voice, “what are you doing there?”

[The authorities of a South Coast town recently promulgated a by-law by which any person weighing over nine stone is
prohibited from riding on a donkey.]
The Donkey. “HEE-Haw.”
“Making a will,” I replied stiffly.
“Well, I think you might help me to
find my ball.”
I realised that the poor fellow did
not quite appreciate the situation.
“Archibald,” I said impressively,
“have you by any chance attempted to
find your way out of this forsaken
city ?”
“I'm not feeling a bit cheerful,” was
the chilling retort; “I’ve lost two new
balls and we've taken nearly two hours
to play five holes. Suppose we get on
with the game.”
He strode away down Petticoat Lane,
and I, knowing the futility of it, rose
up and strode after him. In thirty
seconds we had entered what I took to
be the other end of Bond Street, and in
another thirty seconds we were stand-
ing on all that remained of the sixth tee.
By mutual agreement it was decided
that, having had a sufficient experience
of blind tee shots, we should, lacking a
fore-caddie, indulge in what in hunting
parlance is described as craning.
To that end we left our bags upon
the sixth tee and made for the highest
mountain. Before us lay an expanse of
deep emerald sea-turf, which stretched
away into the far distant marsh-land. It
was interspersed with chains of lesser
sand-hills and populated with active
parties of people. There were little
red flags, white tee boxes and gleaming
pot-bunkers, and in the midst of it all
stood a noble tin pavilion.
We gazed upon the scene spell-bound.
Then we looked at the deserted tin
town.
Silently we slid back to the sixth tee,
gathered up our golf-bags, re-entered
Bond Street and, cautiously as Red
Indians, wound our way to the railway
station. Not until the next train was
securely on its way did we venture to
say what we thought.
“Well,” concluded Archibald, “as
long as nobody hears about it we're
all right.”
This was exactly my view of the case.
:k ::: : ::: ::
A week elapsed before we set forth
for Berrow Dunes again.
We strode confidently up to the new
pavilion and were welcomed royally as
old comrades. All the tribulations, hopes
and triumphs of the Club's stormy
years of war were explained to us,
and we were asked to look round and
say truthfully what we thought. We
could think of one thing only—of praise
to the Providence which had saved us
from exposure.
Then the secretary—a tactless, inqui-
sitive, meddlesome secretary—came in.
“You are just the fellows I wanted
to see,” he cried in his blatant manner;
“we’ve had a little sweep on the score
of your best ball for the first five holes
of the old course and we want to know
who's won it.”
THE BREAKING-POINT.
(After reading a sartorial note.)
I stood unmoved mid many a change,
My days of warfare done;
A London, howsoever strange,
Could not annoy her son;
What though I found a bus's seat
Involved a fight with frenzied furies,
I kept my head, if not my feet,
Before the swoop of office houris.
The departmental flapper held
My favourite hotel;
The galleries I loved of eld
Were hers alone as well;
But facts like these provoked from me
At most, at very most, a dry
“Humph; ”
I realised such things must be
In any famous martial triumph.
Such pinprick changes left me dumb,
Placidly pachyderm,
But now I feel the time has come
To emulate the worm,
And all the Tory in me begs
To state that Change exceeds her
ration
Now that I note on trouser legs
Permanent turn-ups out of fashion.

JBIe. "YES.
She. "WHAT A WONDERFUL coSTUME MR. BULKLEY HAs.”
HE'S RATHER SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS OUTLINE. IT'S THE CAMoUFLAGE IDEA TO PREVENT BEING NOTICED.”
AN IN ARTICULATE HERO.
Do you remember Pembury's W.C.?
Probably not. His great deed was re-
corded in the papers, but, thanks partly
to his own efforts, it was not boomed.
He got it at Bullecourt, and deserved it.
He is as brave as a lion in action, but
socially he is the most abject coward.
I ran across him in London the other
day and found him in a pitiable fright.
There was going to be a function at his
native town and, according to Pembury's
panic-stricken estimate, half the neigh-
bourhood were coming, nominally to
attend a reception in his honour, but
really, of course, to hear Pembury on
“How I won the Victoria Cross.” You
never saw Pembury in a room full of
women? Perhaps it's as well.
It seemed preposterous that a man
who had once made himself terrible to
his country's enemies should now make
a craven exhibition of himself before his
own friends, so I resolved to do what I
could for him.
“Pembury,” I said, “you must be
prepared. Let me have the outline of
that Bullecourt business.”
A gleam of hope came into his wild
eyes.
“You—you don't mean—” he stam-
mered.
“It's your only chance,” I said. “And
buck up; we've only four days. Throw
it off exactly as it happened.”
In ten minutes I had all the detail,
and had written it up long before we
met for dinner together at Latino's that
night. Then Pembury came on to my
rooms to start learning his lines. We
set cushions in a ring of chairs to re-
pre ent the guests, and, when once he
had got over his first terror of the idea,
JPembury made strides. He has a fair
speaking voice—when it'll work, and
some sense of dramatic situation—when
all his senses haven't left him. We had
two more evenings at it in my rooms
and a final rehearsal in the train on our
way down to Pembury's province.
When the guests began to roll up for
the reception, I didn't wonder at Pem-
bury's fright. It wasn't the men so
much ; but the women, a full platoon
of them, might have scared any hero. I
had intended if possible to keep near
Pembury, but could get no closer than
the fringe of a circle of which he was
the centre.
It was only a matter of minutes now.
Here it came.
“Oh, Captain Pembury,” gushed the
local Mayoress, “I’m sure your ex-
perience at Bullecourt must have been
too thrilling. Do tell us all about it!”
“Yes, do / " chorussed the full pla-
toon.
Pembury gave a slight shudder, then
he appeared to remember and began.
I assure you it was quite good. The
modest, deprecating smile, the slight
backward tilt of the head, the chin
pensively taken in the right hand as
if with an effort of memory—I don't
think he forgot one of the stage direc-
tions. Then he started reciting my
terse pithy narrative: the opening
artillery strafe, the advance, the terrific
counter-attack; then himself lying
wounded, with his isolated band of
machine-gunners; the desperate situ-
ation, heat, hunger, thirst, his men
dropping round him one by one, and at
last, just anticipating the final Hun
rush, our own people sweeping up and
relieving him.
There was to have been an impressive
pause at this point, but there wasn't. We
hadn't allowed for Pembury's deaf aunt.
Talking it over afterwards, we con-
jectured that the spectacle of Pembury's
extraordinary eloquence had forced her
to the conclusion that he couldn't pos-
sibly be talking about himself.
“I think, Horace,” she said, nodding
blandly at him, “that it was very gal-
lant of the young man, and I hope he
got home safely. Did he?”

Do You HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY IDEA whether THEY ARE–ER—TAKING ME?”
GEMS FROM THE JUNIORS.
IT is hoped that the publication of
uhe following valuable hints on a proper
celebration of Peace may assist in the
crystallisation of national ideas about
that most important subject:—
How to Cellibrate Peace.
It isnt offen we have a peace to celli-
brate so lets do it jolly well wile we
are about it. My grandfather says
abuv all things let it be done with
dingity as befitts a great nation—
whatever that means. Some peeple
like precessions and things but theyre
a bit slow unless youve got lions in
cages and a elefant or two. How about
crakkers to make the girls jump and
a very imensely big cake but of course
thats only my idea. I darsay groanups
would rather stay in bed to brekfast
and read out bits of newspayper to each
other. But there would have to be fire-
works and anyway dont lets have any
dingity, RUPERT LAKE ſage 10).
A Few Remarks about Peace.
It is rather a Risponsibilyty for me
to say how England should celibrate
Peace spessialy as I am not quite sure
what is the Diffrence between real Peace
and just a Armystis but it is always
a good thing to rejoyce so what does
it matter why. Excep that we muss-
ent Rejoyce when some one else hurts
theirselves so lets hope no one will on
Peace Day. Of course no one need do
what they dont want to but prhaps a
few Remarks will help and I think all
the Serch Lights that were used for
Air Raids ought to shine out from
wherever their places are as some of
us couldent enjoy them much while
there were Boms droping but if you
arnt feeling sort of sickish they must
be splended. And the hole of London
ought to cheer outside Buckingham
Palase and it might be perlite to go to
the houses of parliament dont you think
just to show we are greatful to them
as well and then after that everybody
could start to enjoy theirselves prop-
perly. OLIVE MAITLAND (age 9).
A Sugestsion for how to Celebrat
Peace.
I have got the most lowly thout for
what to do on Peace day. Its a grate
secret but I will tell it this onece. I
am riting a play its so exsiting you cant
think. Theres everso many peple in
it who talk and when theyr done the
King sits down and the Kiser and
they sine there names the King becaus
he wont fite any more and the Kiser
because he cant and then president
Willson says I beg to anounse the leeg
of mashuns has now begun and evºy
body is very glad and shakes hands
and sings God save the King all exsept
the Kiser who goes out and bangs the
dore. I woud have put in more about
france ansetra but there arent enuf
acters and sides I coud make a seprate
play out of them praps. If any body
pays for there seats the money coud
go to help Peace but I shoudent think
they woud.
PHOEBE WARRINGTON (age 8).
Peece.
Peece is very beutiful becoz you dont
have to keep making guns in Peece
and your relashuns arent all soljers
praps they are only in the stocking
change or being quiet things like juges
so you see it is diſrunt to war wich
we know all about now in peece your
father talks about boshviks instead of
germens but its the germens the pecce
is about all the same like it was the
war was about them too a thaetre
woud be a nice way to spend peece
not pictuers but a proper thaetre where
everything is reel Father says wait and

THE BRUNT OF PEACE.
IN that great moment when we touched the goal
Of certain hopes long time deferred
I little marvel if the nation's soul
Was not ecstatically stirred;
If when (by wire) the Teuton toed the line
No orgy of debauch convulsed the traffic,
And even flying-men betrayed no sign
()f any wish to maſlick.
Once, when the killing stopped, we had our say:
Strange attitudes of joy we struck;
Without rehearsal gave ourselves away,
Jazzed in the street and ran amok;
But now this anti-climax leaves us cool; -
Our feet refuse to jump convention's borders:
Besides, they've told us not to play the fool
Until we get our orders.
Nor have we here a foe who turns to friend,
Who, taking from defeat no stain,
After a clean fight makes as clean an end
And clasps our outstretched hands, again;
We know the worth of vows that pass his lips:
From first to last as shifty as a shuttle,
He's taught us how his honour, like his ships,
. He takes no shame to scuttle.
Yet, if it's not the Peace we struggled for,
The thing will somehow have to do,
And we must treat it as we did the War,
And set our teeth and see it through;
And hold the Rhine and have it straitly watched,
And in our bargains stand no further higgling,
Mindful that, though the snake be badly scotched,
He's still alive and wriggling. O. S.
HIER SPRICHT MAN ENGLISCH.
I suppose if I had met Karl Foosboten eighteen months
ago things might have been different; but now he is a
stimulus to me. With his bottle-green uniform, his sword
and carefully-creased white slacks he inspires me, with a
greater confidence in his ability to command than does, for
instance, the cashier at Cox's.
Karl Foosboten is, in short, our village Polizeidiener
(policeman). His position of attention is good, and the
ease and celerity with which he salutes me on every occa-
sion (up to five hundred yards' range) is an example of
Kultur in its highest form. I am certain he would not
treat HINDENBURG himself with greater respect. Only this
morning I had a short interview with him, during which
the position of attention was above all praise. With a
motion of the hand I indicated that the interview was at
an end, as I didn't know how to dismiss him in German
without being familiar. But Karl, who had been learning a
little English, experienced no such embarrassment. Taking
a pace to the rear, he clicked his heels, saluted and with
profound respect, and no doubt with that feeling of elation

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, June 24th.-Evidence of
the holidays, now unhappily over, was
strong in both Houses. The Peers
came back full of good resolutions.
Increased production being the need
of the hour they nobly determined to
sit four days a week in future instead
of three. As a reward for their self-
sacrifice Lord CURzoN promised that
some day, when the signing is really
over and the PRIME MINISTER can tear
himself away from Paris, they shall
be told something about the Peace-
terms.
The bronzed faces of the .
Commons bore testimony to
sunny mornings spent on the
sea-shore and the golf-links.
Judging by the magnificent
gesture with which Sir CLEM-
ENT KINLoch-CookE sought
to repress Mr. Hogg|E's at-
tempt to forestall him in a
“supplementary,” I should
infer that he had been prac-
tising the rôle of CANUTE.
Needless to say Mr. Hogg|E
proved as irrepressible as the
Waves.
Mr. BRIDGEMAN's holiday
pastime probably consisted in
pouring oil upon troubled
waters. Repeated efforts were
made by Major NEWMAN, re-
inforced by Sir Edward CAR-
son and Mr. BottomLEY, to
ascertain whether the Board
of Trade confirmed or denied
Sir ERIC GEDDEs' statement
that there would be a hundred
millions deficit on the work-
ing of the railways. But they
lost all their force under the
emollient gentleness of the
UNDER-SECRETARY's official
manner. A truly Golden BRIDGEMAN.
The FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY
stoutly defended the naval authorities
against the charge that they were re-
sponsible for the disappearance of the
German war-ships. If their advice had
been taken the vessels would have been
surrendered instead of interned, and
Admiral voN REUTEB's coup would have
been impossible.
Certain members have resumed the
practice of despatching minatory tele-
grams to the PRIME MINISTER, and were
naturally disgusted to hear from the
PostMASTER-GENERAL that in future
their pastime was likely to cost them
more. Mr. ILLINGwokTH announced
later on that “the running tunnel” of
the Post Office Mail Tube had been
completed. He at least will have a
convenient bolt-hole when the storm of
public indignation bursts upon him.
ANOTHEn
I learn from the books of reference
that Mr. KELLAway was “formerly a
journalist.” He certainly showed the
contempt bred of familiarity in his
references to the Press attacks upon
the Ministry of Munitions, though his
tribute to “Mr. STEPHEN Gwyn NE of
The Morning Post,” as the introducer
of the StokEs mortar, showed that his
knowledge of the newspaper-world is
not pedantically accurate. His claim
that but for the work of the Ministry
the valour of the soldiers would have
been without avail was advanced with
a vivacity worthy of the PRIME MINIs-

felt rather sorry for Mr. MARTIN.
If Mr. GEORGE TERRELL expected on
a motion for the adjournment to get
the Government to declare their future
fiscal policy he was disappointed. He
managed, however, to elicit from Sir
AUCKLAND GEDDES the surprising in-
formation that that policy is already cut-

THE PRINCESS AND THE DRAGON.
~~~~
ONCE upon a time a dragon had its
lair in a great forest. It was the terror
of the countryside, ravaging crops and
villages and carrying off the inhabi-
tants.
At last the people sent a petition to
the King, who promised the hand of
his only daughter, the beautiful Princess
Layita, to anyone who should succeed
in killing the monster; and he vowed
that until then his daughter, to prevent
heraffections from wanderingelsewhere,
should be confined in the topmost
chamber of the palace tower, where not
even the King himself should see her,
lest he might be suspected of other
matrimonial designs for her.
In those days it was the custom, if
you made a vow, to put the hard work
on to somebody else.
The keys of the tower were entrusted
to the Countess Geltruda, the Princess's
favourite lady-in-waiting. She alone
was permitted to see the Princess, to
take her food—since even Princesses
must eat—and the daily Court gossip.
Meanwhile the fame of the dragon
spread abroad. Not a Knight went
near it. They argued, with common-
sense quite unusual for those times,
that there were plenty of other Kings' for many months.

armour and his horse were jet black.
He had come, he said, to do battle with
the dragon for the hand of the Princess
Layita.
The King himself came out to meet
him. A great banquet was held, fol-
lowed by jousting, and the Black
Knight overthrew all his adversaries.
The King was delighted. “At last,”
he cried, “my daughter will be freed.”
And everyone cheered.
The next day the Black Knight set
out for the dragon's lair. The populace
did not accompany him. It was
generally felt that the meeting of the
Knight and the dragon should be
strictly private.
They never saw him again.

attempted to slay the monster. This
second champion was dressed com-
pletely in white and mounted on a
white horse. So they called him the
White Knight. (In those days people
were very quick at thinking of names).
He too rode to the dragon's lair, but
never returned. The dragon must have
devoured him.
Some time later a Knight dressed in
yellow came to the King's Court. Can
you guess what name
they gave him 2 No?
They called him the
Yellow Knight.
But the dragon swal-
lowed him at a single
gulp.
Next came a green
Knight ; then a couple
of purples; the next wore
heliotrope. But none of
them returned.
By now the dragon
was completely colour-
blind. But his appetite
was as good as ever.

and would question the Countess
Geltruda anxiously. But nothing could
be done.
Then one morning, as the King sat
gloomily at breakfast, a man-at-arms
entered and said, “Your Majesty, there
is one without who wishes to speak
with your Majesty.”
“What does he want at this time of
day?” growled the King.
“He says that he will slay the
dragon and win the hand of the Prin-
cess Layita. At first we turned him

away, for he is but a poor minstrel
boy; but he refused to go.”
The King choked. “You—you tried
to turn him away ! You forfeit your
head next time you turn away anyone
who wants to try conclusions with the
dragon. Bring him in.”
The man-at-arms retired, and came
back with a slim handsome youth,
with golden curls clustering about his
forehead, and clear blue eyes which
looked fearlessly before him. He was
dressed in rags, and in his hand he
carried an old travel-stained harp.
“Acomely youth,” muttered the King,
wiping his moustache. “It is your idea,
I hear, to slay this dragon of ours?” he
remarked cheerfully.

“Yes, your Majesty,” answered the
youth; “and so to win the hand of the
Princess Layita.”
“Just so,” said the King. “Now
let's get to business. About arms. You
can have anything you like from the
armoury, except the suit of gold which
I wear myself on state occasions. You'll
find plenty of * >
“I need no arms,” said the youth. “I
have here a magic dagger, one scratch
of which is enough to slay the grizzliest
beast. It is sharper than a razor.
Would your Majesty care to feel the
blade?”
“A very useful and—ah—effective
y
little weapon,” said the King, edging
away a bit. “Well, as you already
have everything you want, there's no
need to waste time.”
“I will start at once,” said the youth.
“I verily wish you good luck,” said
the King. “You ought to do good work
with that dagger of yours.” He eyed
the youth's shabby clothing. “Go
straight down the passage and turn
to the right if you want a wash and
brush-up.”
The youth drew himself up proudly.
| “Your Majesty,” he said, “if I die in
the encounter I die as I -
am, travel stained and in
rags.”
“Just as you like,”
said the King, and sat
down to finish his break-
fast. He had very little
faith in the minstrel boy,
in spite of the magic
dagger. ... •
When the youth set
out people jeered as he
passed them; they had
no faith in him either.
But he took no notice,
and strode proudly out of
the palace gates.
When he reached the
dragon's lair the mon-
ster was lying sleepily in
the mouth of the cave.
It yawned deliberately,
breathed out a little fire,
and rose to its feet to be
in a better position for
swallowing the minstrel
boy. But the youth
ran nimbly round and
plunged the dagger deep
into its side. The mon-
ster rolled over and lay
still. The magic dagger
had done its work well.
He severed the crea-
ture's head and returned
with it to the palace.
The King ran out to
meet him. “At last,”
he cried—“at last my
daughter is freed!"—and
he embraced the minstrel
boy with tears in his eyes.
“Thank you,” he said as
the youth handed him
the creature's head —
“thank you, my son. It
will look well overthedin-
ing-room mantelpiece.”
Everyone was touched
by these simple words of
apprecistion.
The King made a short speech to the
people. He reminded them of the day
when the Black Knight had come to
the palace; how he had ridden to the
dragon's lair and never been seen again.
“After that,” he said, “many came to
win my daughter's hand. They all
perished. But now this minstrel lad
has succeeded where they failed.”
He embraced the boy again.
populace cheered.
Then the King sent for the Countess
Geltruda. But she was nowhere to be
found.
“What l” fumed the King. “At
such an hour as this!” His tones were
so terrible that the trembling mes-
senger could hardly find his voice to
The
explain that the keys, at any rate, had
been found in her apartments.
“'Tis well,” said the King darkly.
He then proceeded to ascend the
winding steps which led to the top-
most chamber of the tower. Bells rang
in the churches to celebrate the coming
marriage of the Princess Layita and
the minstrel boy. Women wept as they
pictured the joyful reunion of father
and child.
The King unlocked the door and ran
in. “My daughter!” he cried.
But the room was empty
On the table lay a little note. The
King snatched it up. It was rather
faded and dated five years ago.
“DEAR PAPA,” it ran,—“I am going
to elope with the Black Knight. His
name is Rudolph, and he is so hand-
some. He decided not to fight the
dragon after all. I shall start to-
morrow early, before anyone is about,
and wait for Rudolph down the road.
We are going to live happily ever
after. Good-bye.
“P.S.–Geltruda has our Royal Pro-
mise that you will pardon her for having
helped me.”
“Well, anyhow,” said the King,
“we’ve done what we wanted; we've
got rid of the dragon.”
And having once more expressed his
deep obligations to the minstrel boy,
and said how much he regretted that
he could never be his father-in-law, he
graciously presented him with a signed
photograph of his Royal Self in the
character of St. GE9EGE.

Th1: grave anxiety felt for several
months in musical circles concerning
the safety of Mr. H. borough (formerly
Bamberger), the famous violinist and
son-in-law of Lord Boldero |...".
Sir Pompey Boldero), has at last been
relieved by the safe arrival of the great
artist himself, after a series of perilous
adventures, by the side of which the
rounance of the Odyssey is but a jejune
and trivial narrative.
It will be remembered that on the
conclusion of the Armistice Mr. Bam-
borough at once sailed for New Guinea,
to fulfil a longstanding engagement to
organise the private orchestra of the
Sultan of Motumotu and give a series
of re-itals. This engagement was
carried out with resounding success.
Mr. Bamborough, who has always been
a great believer in the Papuans and
a student of Cainozoic geology, rapidly
mastered the language, composed the
internecine quarrels of the cannilalistic
Karons and the pastoral Kebars, who
adhere to the orthodox notation, and,
after holding the post of Prime Minister
for three months, sailed from Port
Moresby amid the lamentations of the
grateful populace.
Mr. Bamborough refused to take any
fee for his services, but was laden with
decorations and presents. These in-
cluded seventy birds of paradise, fiſteen
salamanders, two hund:ed kegs of beche-
de-mer, five richly-painted war canoes,
twenty tons of ebony, and sarongs and
kampongsinnumerable. Unfortunately
the cupidity of the sailors, Kanakas for
the most part of the Sol-ſa persuasion,
was aroused by these treasures, a
mutiny broke out, the white officers were
overpowered, and Mr. Bainborough sen-
tenced to walk the plank. He faced
his doom with unshaken fortitude, his
one request being that before the fatal
plunge he might play BAch's Chaconne.
It was granted, and Mr. Bamborough
declares that he never played so finely
before. Then the sentence was carried
out, and he was left to his fate.
The intrepid musician, however, trod
water for fourteen hours and was then
rescued, not by another ship, but by a
seal, which with the unerring musical
instinct of its race recognised a kindred
soul and towed him to the Isle of
Bobo. Thence he proceeded by cata-
maran to Motumotu, and thence in the
Sultan's Motumotu car to Port Mores-
by. A wireless to Singapore resulted in
the apprehension of the mutineers and
the recovery of all Mr. Bamborough's
treasures, with the exception of five
birds of paradise and a bag of copra.
Mr. Bamborough, who is in robust
health and bronzed by his exposure to
the tropical sun, was met at South-
ampton by Madame Bamborough, their
three sons, Handel Scriabin, Mendels-
solin Stravinsky and Ravel Rachman-
inoſ, and their daughter, Palestrina Por-
pora, and, of course, Lord Boldero, who
seemed somewhat dazed by his good
fortune, but radiated benevolence on the
touching scene of reunion. Mr. Bam-
borough has already accepted an invi-
tation to lecture on his experiences
before the Royal Geographical Society,
and generously presented the faithful
seal, which accompanied him on his
homeward journey, to the Zoological
Gardens. The date of his public entry
into London has not yet been fixed,
but it is hoped that it will not clash
with the Peace Celebrations.

[JULY 2, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE STATUE.
ONE of the oddest things in life is
the way that a story can grow. Even
odder perhaps is the way it can begin.
Let me give you an example.
The other day I was in Waterloo
Place with an ardent young friend, who
pointed to the equestrian statue of Lord
NAPIER OF MAGDALA which is situated
midway between the Athenaeum and
the United Services Clubs.
“There's a very remarkable thing
about that monument" he said, stop-
ping with dramatic suddenness before
it.
I studied the group but saw nothing.
“Don't you see,” he said, “that both
the horse and the rider are looking the
same way?”
Yes, I saw.
“You will notice,” he continued,
“that the gaze of both is fixed on those
two windows at the right end of the
first floor of the United Services Club.”
I agreed. Both certainly look to-
wards those windows, which appeared
either to be dirty or to be screened
from within. -
My young friend was becoming very
earnest. -
“The sculptor,” he said, “gave the
horse and rider that look because it was
in the room at which they are staring
that NAPIER died; and,” he added im-
pressively, “the windows have never
been cleaned since.”
“Ah !” I said, for I must admit to
being interested. And why should I dis-
believe? It seemed probable enough
and did credit to the club's fidelity.
Moreover, my young friend is more
taken by facts than ſancies; nor is he
a leg-puller; and every one knows that
sculptors are given to little dramatic
touches. I therefore accepted the
story, which has many good points,
just as I should accept any other
reasonable London legend, and added it
to my own repertory, telling it chiefly as
an example of that rare thing, romance
in a London club. I may not exactly
have dined out on it, but I took people
along Pall Mall to tell them about the
statue and properly thrill them.
But I told it once too often. I told
it to a man who is not only naturally
sceptical about everything he hears,
but one of those fellows who have
at their fingers' ends what are called
data. Data, it is notorious, are fatal
to romancers, and his data settled me.
“Wait a minute,” he said; “I must
inquire into this,” and he went up to
the library of the Athenaeum for that
chilling thing, a book of reference.
“I thought so,” he remarked as he
came back. “That statue is a replica
of one in Calcutta.”
“Good heavens, is it?” I replied.
“Then what are the horse and rider
looking at there?” -
“I don't know,” he said. “Another
thing,” he went on; “the original statue
was set up in NAPIER's lifetime.”
He looked at me steadily and I
looked out of the window.
“It's not my story,” I said weakly;
“I'm only passing it on.”
“NAPIER,” he pursued, “died at his
house in Eaton Place.”
Humiliation seems to be the best
word I can find to describe my own
condition; but it is the last to apply
to his. I never saw a man so flushed
with triumph. -
A few days later we met again.
“About that story of yours,” he
began. - -
“The one I repeated to you?" I said.
“Yes," he said. “Your story about
NAPIER and his horse. I've had a letter
from the secretary of the United Ser-
vices Club. I wrote to him and this is
what he says:—
“In reply to your letter of 17th
instant I have to inform you that the
two windows referred to belonged to
the west end of the Library. I under-
stand that the reason for veiling the
windows of the room was to obtain
wall space to allow two large portraits
to be hung on the wall to correspond
with the east end of the Library.’”
He then handed me the letter as a
souvenir and leſt me.
Now what I want to do is to meet
my ardent young friend and transfer the
letter to him ; I also want to find out
who told him this fable, and then who
told him, and so backwards until we
get at the fountain-head. For someone
must have begun it. Meanwhile I ask
all those persons to whom I have told
it and who may read these lines to for-
get it.
“You pays your money and you takes
your choice.”
“Now that the drought is breaking we can
look back upon fifty radiant days during
which the sun has dispensed an invigorating
national tonic. His healing beams have soothed
and sweetened countless frayed tempers.”
Daily Mail, June 21, 1919.
“Human beings, just as much as the veget-
able world, have parched in the long drought.
Sleep has been broken, nerves became frayed,
the skin aud hair became dry. We, who
grumble so at our cloudy British skies, have
learned in these last 48 days something of that
sick weariness of brazen heavens and the flam-
ing sun, that surfeit of light and glare, that
torments the exile in the Indian plains."
Same paper, same day.
Now you know just how you were
affected by the drought.

cluding £200 for a Buckskin grand piano.”

And where the feather-pated mayfly

There, when the fun grows fast and
tails are whisking,
You'll find him beatifically frisking.

our BookING-office.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE picture-wrapper of Love Lane (CoLLINs) might lead
you to suppose that it contained a farcical story, which is
by no means the fact. The discovery of an exact epithet
for Mr. J. C. SNAITH's latest novel somewhat baffles me. It
must be an adjective conveying the idea of clever writing,
full of charm and sympathetic observation, but made a
little unconvincing by its rose-tinted outlook upon human
nature. Of Mr. SNAITH's characters here it might be said
that when they are good they are very, very good, and that
the other kind is kept out of the picture. It is a story of
the War, showing the changes that its progress brought
to Josiah Munt, Mayor of Blackhampton, and to the
members of his family circle. As I have hinted, these
changes are wholly beneficial. At first, indeed, you may
think that Josiah, pompously prosperous, who has refused
to speak to one daughter since her unapproved marriage
and is about to cut another from his will for imprisonment
as a Suffragette, will prove the typical explosive parent of
fiction. Actually, however, no such matter. With the War
a thousand new interests and sympathies awake in the
mayoral heart. Melia's unsatisfactory husband enlists,
and in the process of becoming a hero finds his soul. The
relations of this couple and the slow development of under-
standing between them are well and tenderly done.
Josiah himself prospers even more, but differently; becomes
the municipal idol of Blackhampton, is knighted, and ex-
pands chapter by chapter into new geniality. Finally,
the disinherited Suffragette, now a motor-driver, covers the
name of Munt with such glories as demand public con-
gratulation and her reinstatement as the most honoured
member of the united family. Well, I think Mr. SNAITH is
a trifle over-optimistic, and tells, like Hope, a flattering tale.
Certainly he tells a very cheerful one.
Blind Alley (UNwiN) is a running commentary on the
War from the view-point of the disgruntled “intellectual.”
I judge it to have been written for relief from some accu-
mulated ill humours, perplexities of mind and conscience,
and genuine mental suffering. Mr. W. L. GEongº would
not have made his reputation as a novelist on work like
this. The characters are so very palpably pegs on which
to hang opinions, and certainly the author has abused
that indulgent modern trick of writing a book in detached
numbered sections, and so escaping all the discipline
of sound planning. It is an easy method which makes
difficult reading. As to the opinions, Mr. GEORGE makes
violent and (it is just to say) clever protest against the
common man's acceptance without criticism of the “my.
country-always-right” thesis, and gives his own views,
I should suppose, chiefly through the mouths of that most
unsquirelike of squires, Sir Hugh Oakley, of his shell.

way the worthy baronet who apostrophises England thus:
“But I must love you, and love you, because only love,
crude minx with the heart of gold, can teach you to
love.” Mr. GEORGE and Sir Hugh may love England, but
find it rather difficult not to despise her. The quite uncon-
vincing sexual adventures of Sir Hugh's daughters, Monica,

who went into munitions and fell in love with a Don Juan
of a profiteer, and Sylvia, who made a hobby of war-
bazaars and adultery, help to preserve the continuity of the
author's preoccupation with a side of life which, probably
for our souls' health's sake, the rest of us attempt to
camouflage. ... But by no means a dull or negligible book.
Perhaps it would not be unfair to regard Consequences
(HoddER AND Stoughton) as itself a consequence of the
success achieved by Miss E. M. DELAFIELD with the same,
or something the same, environment in certain chapters of
an earlier story. Just how far it should be classed as anti-
conventual is difficult to say, because, though the heroine,
Aler Clare, is a conspicuous failure as a “religious,” and
though her superiors are shown as entirely wanting in
comprehension, Alec herself has been drawn, with all
Miss DELAFIELD's incisive skill, as foredoomed to failure
in everything, one of those unhappy beings who combine
a passionate desire for sympathy with a total inability to
arouse it. In her nursery and school-days, as a débutante
in late Victorian Society, and betrothed to an egotistical
oung prig (the only person in the tale about whom I fancy
iss DELAFIELD really enjoyed writing), the miserable
record of poor Alec remains the same. The convent, which
seemed to offer the solution to her problems, brings only a
result of worse failure than any; and the final tragedy is
what you can see as the only end to such a history. Though
as a study of failure it is clever and penetrating, I shall not
call the book equal to Miss DELAFIELD's best, if only because
it is almost wholly devoid of that ironical humour from
which I have before now derived such malicious entertain-
ment. Consequences finds her both more serious and less
sure of her aim ; but the half-impatient sympathy that
drives it forward reveals a new aspect of this always
original and stimulating writer.
Although The Cameliers (MELRose) makes an especial
appeal to Australians, its vivid account of the Egyptian and
Palestine fighting deserves a more general appreciation.
Mr. Olivi R Hogue is an Australian by birth and breeding,
and has clearly had a literary training, which he puts to
excellent use. He has an eye for essential points and a
lively sense of humour. In this book he gives us facts,
with an admixture of what I should guess is fiction founded
(possibly) on fact. When he is describing the many fights
in which the Camelry took a glorious part he is on ab-
solutely sure ground, and I give him the maximum every
time. But when he descends to tell us of the love-story of
Lieutenant Blaine and Sister Livingstone I have an un-
comfortable feeling that he is writing down to, and a little
despising, his public. Or perhaps it is that a blend of stern
reality with what can only be described as “light stuff" is
not to my taste. However that may be, as a record of
arduous campaigning The Cameliers deserves the very best
of luck, and that is exactly what I wish it.

IN MEMORY OF THE DEAD.
THANKSGIVING DAY, JULY 6TH.
ON this memorial day of Peace fulfilled,
When to the God of battles praise is said
For warfare dome and the long clamour stilled,
Forget not then the dead.
It was for such a day as this they died.
The prayer in which they spent their failing breath
Asked for this hour—for England's faith and pride
Made perfect by their death.
And now beneath the dust of shattered walls,
Far off in alien fields forlorn and bare,
There where they sleep the muted echo falls
Of joy they may not share.
But, could its rumour sound within their ears,
This joy of victory won at what a cost,
They would not have it less, nor touched with tears
For all that we have lost.
Yet will we keep, who cannot else repay
The dearest gift that Love has power to give,
l'or them the first place in our thoughts to-day—
Our dead, through whom we live. O. S.
A capRicious star.
THE other day I was seated at my favourite table in
the Café Régal, scanning the pages of The Wottler, when
I discovered a pale-faced man sitting opposite me.
I glanced at him casually. Not only was he pallid of
countenance, but also there was stamped upon his features
an expression of deep melancholy. He had a look of ap-
pealing sadness in his eyes.
As I was regarding him he caught my eye, and I hastily
turned my attention to a double-page set of photographs
revealing in detail the attractions of Miss Freddie Frinton,
the famous revue actress.
The sad-faced man leant across the table.
“Fine girl that,” he said, indicating a portrait of Miss
Erinton playing with her tame rabbits in the garden of her
riparian villa. “Fine girl; but, like all the sex, Sir, fickle.
“You’d hardly believe, Sir,” he continued, adjusting a
pair of pince-nez upon his unassuming nose, “that my life
has been intimately associated with that of Miss Freddie
Frinton.”
I made noises indicating a polite reserve of astonishment.
“Yes, Sir," he said, “destiny is a remarkable force.”
Not knowing what else to say I told him he was right
there.
“Maybe you will remember, if you cast your mind back
three years, reading about Miss Frinton's attempt to throw
herself over Westminster Bridge?” -
“My memory's not what it was,” I said, “but * >
“I will refresh it, Sir. Miss Frinton had been working
very hard during the run of Buzz Off, with the result that
she suffered from a nervous breakdown. When she threw
herself into the river a man dived in and pulled her out. I
was that man,” added the stranger modestly.
“Really,” said I.
“Early in 1917,” he went on, “Miss Freddie Frinton was
acting at the Collodium. One night, after the performance,
she had just left the stage-door when she was attacked by a
gang of hooligans, who tried to steal her purse. Perhaps
you recollect seeing the affair reported in the Press, Sir?'
“I seem to have a hazy idea wn -
“Well, Sir, that night, luckily, I was near by. I not
only rescued Miss Frinton but I successfully put her
assailants to flight.”
“Well done l’’
The pale-faced man raised a deprecating hand.
“One moment, Sir,” he said. “Last year Miss Frinton
became the recipient of persistent addresses from the son of
a very distinguished house. The young man was a future
peer of the realm, Sir, but unfortunately for him Miss
Frinton did not respond to his advances. Enraged at finding
himself repulsed, the unhappy youth became desperate.”
“Dear, dear.”
“One night, whilst Miss Frinton was at the theatre, he
succeeded in breaking into her flat. Drawing a knife from
his pocket the wretched young man cut from its frame her
most treasured possession—a magnificent portrait of her-
self from the brush of September James, the celebrated
painter.”
I regarded the stranger with increased interest. It was
evident that he was labouring under the stress of some
strong pent-up emotion. He sipped a little whisky-and-
soda with an effort to simulate calm.
“When she discovered her loss,” said the stranger, “Miss
Frinton was distressed beyond measure. Her grief was so
intense that she could scarcely bear to see even newspaper-
men.”
“She was naturally upset,” I put in.
“Prostrated, Sir—inconsolable. And, though I say it
myself, it was fortunate indeed that I was at hand to
render assistance.”
“Oh, you were there?”
“Yes, Sir, I was there. And with me to think is to act.
The police were summoned, but long before they arrived
I had collected a number of clues. Obtaining the loan of
Miss Frinton's magnificent motor-car I was quickly away,
hot on the scent of the author of this dastardly outrage."
“Good work.”
“And, Sir, I traced and caught him. I recovered the
painting. I denounced him to his face. He confessed his
guilt. “I took it as a memento, because I love her,'
he said.”
“Did Miss Frinton prosecute?” -
“Miss Frinton did not prosecute. She was so overjoyed
to get her portrait back that she allowed her generosity to
get the better of her. She did not wish to injure the good
name of a proud and illustrious family. Nevertheless the
story of the episode leaked out and, save for the unhappy
young man's name, which was suppressed, the whole affair
was widely reported in the newspapers.”
“I think I remember that,” I said.
The sad man sighed wearily.
“After that,” he said, “I was at her side always. She
made me think I was indispensable to her happiness. I was
at her beck and call. I was her constant guide and adviser.”
He swallowed the remaining contents of his glass.
“And now—now, Sir, she has deserted me for another.
After all I've done; after all the risk I’ve taken; after all
the devotion with which I have served her. But such is
woman's way. Having finished with me she casts me
aside like a broken toy.”
I breathed sympathy, but I also betrayed curiosity. “You
have not specified your relations with Miss Frinton,” I
said. “Are you by any chance her husband 2"
“No, Sir,” said the pale-faced man, “but I was the best
Press agent she ever had.”
“People used to say in the first weeks of the war, when things were
going badly, “We’ve ogt to win.” The alternative was so unthinkably
horrible.”—Provincial Paper.
But what's the matter with got?

THE BRIGADIER'S BATH.
According to the illustrated papers,
one half of feminine England is arrayed
at the present time in bathing costumes,
and the other half parades the piers
and promenades in dresses that closely
resemble them. Very interesting and
illuminating these pictures. But I
would commend to the notice of the
photographic press the fact that, having
a very serviceable strip of ocean at our
disposal, we on this side are also in a
position to show some excellent lines in
natatory wear. A snapshot of the
troops' tubbing parade at eighteen
hours, with Frederick in attendance as
O.C. bathing, would, I am convinced,
promote the circulation of these popular
organs.
Why a quite good subaltern like
Frederick was selected for the duty is
hard to guess. Possibly it was thought
that with the advent of the Channel
swimming season certain other ranks
might be tempted to simplify the
machinery of demobilisation by making
a bee-line for the cliffs of Albion, leav-
ing a derelict suit of khaki on the coast
of France. Or perhaps Those High in
Authority considered that the specta-
cle of Frederick loafing round the huts
made the camp look untidy, and de-
vised this pretext for finding him honest
employment. At all events they sent
for him.
“In future,” said they, “bathing will
be a voluntary parade, under the control
of an officer. That officer will be your-
self. The times will be 6.30 till 7.30
each morning" (Frederick shuddered),
“17.00 to 19.00 hours each evening”
(another shudder), “and Saturday and
Sunday afternoons” (convulsive tre-
mors). “You will be required to
arrange that the tide is up at those
hours, that the troops do not go beyond
the limits assigned to them, and that no
unauthorised jelly-fishes or crustaceans
are allowed on the portion of the beach
under your command. That is all,
thank you.”
Thereafter Frederick might be seen
gloomily pacing the sands that an even
greater soldier had trodden a century
before.
“What annoys me about the whole
footling business is the fact that it isn't
military operations at all,” he said in
confidence to Percival. “It's really
naval work. Suppose one of my swim-
mers gets out of control and threatens
to ram a passing vessel; I don't know
the nautical drill for warning the
skipper to get his torpedo-nets out.”
“Some people are never satisfied,”
replied Percival unfeelingly. “Here
you are, with nothing to do but pace
the yellow sands, bask in the sunshine,
and watch the innocent sport of the
troops, and yet you grouse about it.”
“Yes,” responded Frederick, “it’s
the innocent sportiveness of the troops
that puts the last touch of joy into the
picture. It was their innocent sportive-
ness that made them dump an old suit
of khaki on the beach the other day,
and when I found it aſter they had all
gone I nearly issued a Casualty Report
and fixed up a Court of Inquiry before
I tumbled to it that I had been had.”
And, with hatred in his soul, salt in
his throat and sand in his eyes, he re-
sumed his weary perambulation until
the hour of 19.00 should secure his
release.
It was now 18.50, and at that pre-
cise moment Brigadier-General Breech-
block, who had recently arrived and
occupied a billet on the sea front, from

which it was possible to observe the
troops bathing, decided that it would
be pleasurable to himself and helpful
to moral if he were to join them.
The Brigadier, I may observe, is an
impressive spectacle, being so lavishly
decorated that it is necessary for him
to do chest-expansion exercises each
morning to maintain the frontal accom-
modation required for his polychromatic
display of ribbons. His dazzle dado
exceeds in richness and area anything
to be found in Northern France. It is
said that whenever a new decoration is
being issued the great ones immediately
send round to Brigadier Breechblock,
asking him to drop in for a cup of tea
and an O.K. or a G.P.O., or whatever
it is that they happen to be pushing at
the moment. So that the honour con-
ferred on the troops by the Brigadier
voluntarily mingling in the same sea
with them was immense.
Now it happened that Frederick
knew not the Brigadier, and, though
one is loth to make the admission, it
is a fact that Brigadiers in bathing
costumes are much as other men. So
when at 18.57 hours Frederick saw a
portly soldier shed an old mackintosh
on the beach and proceed to attack an
incoming wave his heart surged with
bitterness against the laggard who came
to prolong his vigil.
“Hi, there !” he shouted.
are you going?” -
His destination being obvious, the
Brigadier made no response.
“You know well enough you mustn't
bathe after 19.00 o'clock,” cried Fred-
erick wrathfully. “Come out of it!”
The Brigadier surveyed Frederick in
bewilderment. “Do you know who I
am 2" he said at length.
“No,” answered Frederick, “and I
don't care. I suppose you think because
you are a quartermaster - sergeant or
something you can do as you bally well
like. But I'll show you !”
The Brigadier was thunderstruck.
He, a quartermaster-sergeant l It was
necessary that this presumptuous sub-
altern should be crushed.
“It may interest you to know,” he
said, dropping his thunderbolt, “that I
am Brigadier-General Breechblock.”
“Oh, are you?” replied Frederick, still
living; “well, I'm Duggie Haig, and
if you don't come out immediately I'll
put you under arrest for disobeying
orders and for insolence to an officer.”
The stripes on the Brigadier's bath-
ing costume quivered with suppressed
passion.
“I’ll give you one chance,” continued
Frederick. “Come out at once or I'll
throw your old mackintosh into the sea
and keep you there till the tide goes
out."

THE DIPLOMATS.
I. .
My DEAR HENRY,-They say that
the new diplomacy should not be secret,
don't they? Let us, then, be the first
to oblige.
There are three of us; the rest do not
count. First there is myself, the brains
of the business. Bill works away strenu-
ously during office hours and looks
knowledgable and discreet at meal-
times. Ralph darts about the Continent
talking big in terms of Kingdoms and
Republics, and using up his prestige to
et first through the Customs at the
rontiers. Without any reflection on
them I doubt if either of them could
have achieved my masterpiece of diplo-
macy—for example, to have conducted
personality next time he drops in with
a few more hundred pages. Probably
some Sinn Feiner will have supplied
him with a map showing him where
Ireland is or would like to be.
Bill is a soldier; not one of the bright
new sort, who start business with the
rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and earn
promotion once a fortnight, so long as
there is promotion left to earn. He is
one of the regular plodders, who take
years and years to become captains
even. But if Bill is a regular soldier
he is also an old soldier. You know
what I mean, don't you? You've bene-
fited by their efforts yourself, haven't
you? In any case a very useful man
to compete with important personalities
who want to enlist his sympathy with
private schemes for reorganising the
the other hand, feel there is lots of
hope for us.
And so, you ask, it is our three selves
who are avowedly, officially, by the
grace of Heaven and with the approval
of President WILSON, appointed to re-
organise Europe and re-distribute it
amongst deserving and pushing appli-
cants? Well, Henry, not exactly yet;
but it will come to that, no doubt.
What is then our official position? We
have no official position, and that is
the most diplomatic thing about us.
It subtly eliminates the possibility of
international complications resulting
from our activities. But don't go away
thinking that we have done nothing to
justify our title. Listen to this for a
start:-
Our first need, we felt, was the best
an hour's interview with
an important personality
(endeavouring to enlist
my sympathy in his pri-
vate scheme for the re-
organisation of the Bal-
kans) so ably as to pre-
vent his discovering my
ignorance as to the exact
difference between
Bukharest and Budapest
and my inner belief that
they were both the same
town, situated some-
where in the Ukraine.
Why the Ukraine, you
ask? How come I to
know anything about
that? I owe my intimate
knowledge of the Ukraine
to another important
personality who endeav-
ours to enlist my sym-

possible car for the least
possible price. We spot-
ted the very thing we re-
quired; fast but notfussy,
rich but not rowdy. The
question was how to get
it off its present owner
at the price we were pre-
pared to pay. This price
amounted to practically
nothing. Was that a mis-
sion to be entrusted to the
brains of the business, or
to the old soldier? It was
conceivable that a superb
effort of the very oldest
and tawniest soldiery
might just pull it off;
but, after discussion, we
decided to entrust the
mission to neither but
leave it to the rogue.
After a week's roguery
pathy in his private scheme for reor-
ganising the Russias. He has supplied
me with two hundred and forty-three
closely-printed pages of literature on
the subject; he has also supplied me
with a map.
Whatever else may escape one's notice
on this map there is no getting away
from the Ukraine. He is a Ukrainian
himself and no doubt felt entitled to
let himself go when he came to this bit
of his map of Europe. The rest of the
Continent appears like the chorus at
the pantomime when it is standing by,
all stuffed away into the wings to leave
elbow-room for Cinderella. Henry, to
gaze at this map is to see the Ukraine,
as it were one man holding out cordial
hands to another, stretching out its
frontiers to you in London. With but
one kind word of encouragement it
would stretch them still further so as
to include you in their affectionate em-
brace. Whether the process might be
carried further yet, so as to include Ire-
land, I wouldn't like to say. I'll ask my
Slavs, be they Jugo or Czecho. My
affection for Bill is as profound as my
admiration, but I fear there will be
trouble between us if our several inter-
viewers go on supplying us respectively
with maps of Europe which agree so
little with each other. Dash it all, they
treat the Continent like a piece of
plasticine.
Ralph, I am sorry to say, is a rogue
—one of those persistent irresistible
rogues who can wheedle anything out
of anybody. Should your heart be set
on any part of this or the other hemi-
sphere as a convenient site for a new
republic of which you would yourself
be President, you have only to mention
it to Ralph and a representative will
call on you next day, asking you to
name your terms and to state if im-
mediate possession is required. Those
who have his salvation at heart hoped
that the War would save him; but he
was invalided out of the army some
time ago. Now he has joined us they
feel there is no hope for him. We, on
he reported that he could obtain the
transfer to our use, gratis, of the car,
but not without the owner in it. We
agreed to make a concession" on this
point, accepting delivery of the owner
also on condition of his bearing the ex-
pense of the petrol and the tyres. The
happiest part of the whole affair is that
the owner is shaking hands with himself
secretly all the time, thinking it is he
who has done the first-class wangle.
Why and how, you ask again? I have
promised that diplomacy shall not be
secret, and I will tell you. We gave
cause to him, as we have given to you,
to ask, if it is our three selves who are
appointed to reorganise and re-distri-
bute Europe. But in his case we with-
held the true answer. He too is an
important personality with a private
scheme for reorganising the Balkans,
the Russias and any other country in
which he takes an interest. Yes, Henry,
what makes our wheels run smoothly
is oil, or the hope of oil.
Yours ever, CHARLEs.

A LESSON.”
Member. “OH, THANK You. IN THAT CASE I THINK I'LL conteNT MYSELF witH TRYING TO REMEMBER what You Told ME whex
THEY were HALF-A-CROWN.”
HOW TO KEEP FIT.
By way of supplementing the in-
teresting information contributed by
famous athletes to The Strand Magazine
on this subject Mr. Punch has collected
testimonies from leading statesmen and
publicists as to the best way of main-
taining their physical fitness.
Mr. SMILLIE states that he finds an
unfailing stimulus in reading and re-
reading BRowNING’s “Last Duchess.”
His only regret in this context is that the
poet failed to complete the picture by a
companion study of “The Last Duke.”
He also finds himself greatly reinvig-
orated by the perusal of tragedies de-
| scribing the downfall of monarchs and
potentates. But he points out that
SHAKSPEARE was guilty of a curious
error in speaking of “sad stories of the
deaths of kings.” As a matter of fact
in his (Mr. SMILLIE's) opinion they are
the brightest, the most cheering stories
in the whole range of literature.
Lord READING, in the course of a
genial and heart-to-heart talk with Mr.
Punch's representative, declared that
he found his best refreshment and re-
creation in the exercise of radio-active
benevolence. He believed in smiling.
He further admitted that he derived a
certain amount of healthy exhilaration
from contemplating the difficulties with
which the Government were confronted
in the selection of an Ambassador to the
United States. If only Mr. SMILLIE
would be true to the correct pronuncia-
tion of his name, Lord READING thought
that he would be an ideal man for the
post. Failing him, however, there was
always Mr. Eustace Smiles.
Lord BIRKENHEAD, in a brief interview,
observed that recreation could not be
dispensed with, but it must be attuned
to the position of the individual con-
cerned. A Lord Chancellor, however
young and agile, could not possibly
stoop to the reprehensible contortions
of Jazz-dancing. Swedish exercises in
the privacy of the bathroom were legi-
timate and desirable. But mental dis-
traction was quite as important, and he
had found it in preparing a new trans-
lation of CICERo's De Senectute, which
he proposed to dedicate to Lord HALS-
BURY, in view of the interesting fact
that he was now just half Lord HALS-
BURY's age.
Mr. HARoi.D BEGBTE, though still
suffering from the strain of interview-
ing the ex-Kaiser, kindly favoured Mr.
Punch's representative with an illu-
minating monologue. The only way to
keep oneself fit, he said, is to cultivate
hero-worship. His own basic belief is
that all the greatest criminals, if dis-
passionately considered, prove to have
been great benefactors, or they would
have been if they had been interviewed
from their early years by publicists en-
dowed with sympathy, intuition and
uplift. “I often regret,” Mr. BEGBIE
wistfully observed, “that I never knew
CASANov.A, BENVENUto CELLINI, or
ABDUL HAMID. I feel sure that the ad-
vantage would have been mutual, and
that many misapprehensions might
have been avoided if I had been consulted
by the two first-named celebrities before
their autobiographies went to press.”

[JULY 9, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HAPPY WARRIOR.
Toby and I–both full lieutenants
and ex-acting captains for various care-
fully tabulated periods in The Gazette—
were “demobbed” at the same dispersal
centre on the same day. We had never
met before, but later we chanced to
meet at the same counter at Cox's. Here
we asked the same questions about our
gratuities and were driven away by the
same clerk.
In addition we had both been wounded
twice, and distinctly remembered the
attractions of the same patient nurse
at Wimereux. Our trials and sorrows
drew us together, and we decided to
rest on the East coast while the gratui-
ties materialised. -
I was senior by days, but I waived
this point and we stayed at the same
hotel on terms, to a mere civilian, of
perfect equality.
For two days we bathed and fished
in the most gorgeous of old clothes, and
never talked about the War until all
the profiteers had gone to bed.
On the third day came the sharp re-
minder that war and strife still stalk
hand-in-hand through a stricken world.
We were smoking in front of the
hotel and Toby had just completed his
daily checking of the actual amount of
his gratuity, when a motor drew up
and an officer in full panoply—khaki
touched with red—alighted.
There was a sharp clicking noise at
my side as Toby came to attention; he
then apologised, and I helped him to
carry his right foot well away again.
But we both gazed spellbound at that
sinister martial figure; all the dread
horrors of war seemed to have surged
back on our peaceful village. -
“Has HINDENBURG broken his word
to me?” Toby whispered tensely; while
I made a rapid calculation of the dis-
tance to the Crystal Palace, which is
my rejoining centre.
“I don't suppose they'll pay one
penny of gratuity until the second war
is over,” Toby murmured in a voice
that seemed to sorrow for England.
At this moment the officer asked me
if I could direct him to one Ben Harris,
proprietor of bathing-machines. Now
Ben Harris is the man whose fishing-
boat we had been using, a local celebri-
ty of no mean order and a man reputed
to be bad to beat in a business deal.
I pointed out the way with every re-
spect, and then we slunk after him.
“He may be a disguised mine-layer,”
said Toby as we approached the beach,
“I am not going to lose sight of him.
For all we know we may be present at
the making of history.”
Thus we came to assist at that inter-
view and caught a glimpse of the inner
workings of the great silent mechanism
of administration during the transition
period (November, 1918, until Heaven-
knows-when).
“Good morning, Mr. Harris,” said
the warrior with easy affability; “I’ve
come to have a look at your bathing-
machines.”
“Camouflage!” snorted Toby con-
temptuously. “He knows we've fol-
lowed him.”
“You can't deceive the Staff,” I re-
plied with feeling as I recalled the inci-
dent of the Brigade-Major and a rather
soft cap of mine in 1916.
But apparently old Ben could de-
ceive the Staff all right. He took him
round those four bathing-machines and
showed him, with figures, the damage
(repaired by himself and so no longer
evident to the eye) which had been
done by exuberant members of His
Majesty's Forces billeted in the village
during the Great War (1914 to 1918).
The figures and approximate dates were
noted down, and the soldier and the
famous ex-sailor parted amicably.
After a bathe we returned to the
hotel to find the officer resting in the
smoking-room. We spoke to him—yes,
he was quite approachable—and, there
being no profiteer present, we talked
a little of the Great War. He did not
appear to have been in any part of the
line that we knew ; but he mentioned
an anxious month that he had spent in
the Inland Waterway Transport near
St. Omer; and he recalled with great
vividness an air-raid warning in distant
Etaples when he was returning from
conducting a draft in 1917.
Also he had found the Spring of
1918 desperately cold at Norwich, and
doubted if he would care to live in the
Eastern Counties.
“Are you getting demobbed soon?”
Toby ventured to ask.
“I am in no hurry,” he replied, pass-
ing his hand wearily across his brow.
“But don't you sometimes feel that
you would like a rest after the strain 2"
I asked him.
“Yes, at times possibly one does feel
like that; but there are compensations,
you know.” -
The warrior sighed and then smiled
bravely as he went to the writing-table
to make out his claim for travelling
allowance.
“‘Quite like old times," said a policeman on
point duty in Bond Street, London, yesterday
afternoon as he disentangled a block of tram-
way-cars in which an omnibus, half-a-dozen
motor-cars, and a smart Victoria drawn by a
pair of spanking bay horses were involved. It
was, indeed, like old times.”—Daily Paper.
The War had completely blotted out
our memory of the dear old tramway.

THE Dust ATTAck.
(Lines rendered nugatory for the moment
by the recent rains.)
IN punishment of what fell crime
Are both my optics bunged with grime
At every wind's offensive?
What aim of reconstructive art
Has swept away the watering-cart,
Whereon small boys were wont to sit
And have no end of larks with it 2
Why don't we wash the roads a bit 2
Is water too expensive?
It strikes me as extremely rough,
When broken lies the Prince of Bluff
And all his sons and nephews,
That I should be compelled to eat
The nastiest dirt about the street
And have the action of a jaw
That shouts “What ho for Right and
Law 1 ''
Jammed up with little bits of straw
And odds and ends of refuse. "
I know a chap—a chap named Cox
Who pinched a respirator (box)
While still on service (active),
And, when he notes a dust alarm,
To keep his countenance from harm
He puts it on at record pace,
A splendid thing—in Cox's case—
Because the mask improves his face
And makes him more attractive.
But I'm convinced the man is right
And, though it is a curious sight
On gustful days and gritty
To see him come from the “alert"
And knock his hat off in the dirt
And fumble with the tapes and string
And bite the rubber teething ring
And shout “Gas shells "like anything
In Bond Street or the City,
I too, regretful as I am
A source of London's joy to dam
And substitute a spectre
For that refreshing sight and rare
That rambles now through street and
square—
The bardic lips, the eyes of flame!—
Unless the Boroughs meet my claim
Shall feel compelled to do the same
And wear a muck-protector.
And what is more I'll march along
Equipped with a tremendous gong
And give it many a stout hit,
Or make a Strombos horn to roar
Its huge alarum at the door
(I hate to do good things by stealth)
Of that new shrine of wit and wealth,
I mean the Ministry of Health,
And ask them “What about it?”

THE RAILWAY SCANDAL.
“THERE has been, I know,” said
Cantleberry, “a good deal of discontent
over the train-services, and I am told
that some railways have adopted quite
an off-hand attitude, making no attempt
to conciliate their critics and even
taking no notice of them. But what-
ever may have been the behaviour of
other railways ours has not shown it-
self indifferent to our complaints. I
am thinking just now of the case of the
8.47 from Beckenridge.”
“What was that?” I asked.
“The train was unpleasantly crowd-
ed,” said Cantleberry; “you might
almost say dangerously crowded. It
used to arrive at Beckenridge full and
depart fuller. As for any discrimina-
tion being made between first and third
class, that was unheard - of; people
pushed in where they could, into the
guard's van, when he forgot to lock
the door before leaving it, and even on
to the engine-tender. I have travelled
up in that train before now with twenty-
one people in the compartment, not
counting two men (sailors) in the racks.
When the train steamed out it always
left on the platform a score of people
who had been unable to get in any-
where; and naturally many complaints
were made. Season-ticket holders wrote
to the Company demanding that steps
should be taken to ensure the 8.47 not
being over-crowded.
“Well, the Company were not in-
different. They took steps. The method
they hit upon was so simple that one
wonders why nobody had ever thought
of it before. Personally I feel I should
like to meet the man—traffic-superin-
tendent, general manager, director, or
whoever had the notion—and tell him
to his face the opinion I hold of his
ingenuity. The 8.47 is never over-
crowded now.” -
“And what did the Company do to
bring this about 2 " I asked.
“They knocked the 8.47 off alto-
gether,” he said.
“It would be impossible to say whom of the
Big Three was the most popular.”

IV.--THE ROBIN.
THE robin is the fairies' page:
They keep him neatly dressed
For country service or for town
In dapper livery of brown
And little scarlet vest.
On busy errands all day long
He hurries to and fro.
With watchful eyes and nimble
wings—
There are not very many things
The robin doesn't know.
And he can tell you, if he will,
The latest fairy news:
The quaint adventures of the
King -
And whom the Queen is visiting,
And where she gets her shoes.
And lately, when the fairy Court
Invited me to tea,
He stood behind the Royal Chair;
And here, I solemnly declare,
When he discovered I was there,
That robin winked at me. R. F.

Nationalization is not a blessed word
in spite of its recent Sankeyfication.
Wednesday, July 2nd.—There are
limits, after all, to the LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR's omniscience. In friendly
criticism of the Bill by which the
Church of England seeks power, to
reform herself without undue inter-
ference from Parliament, he observed
that “never was older wine put into a
newer bottle.” His old friend Simon
(the Cellarer, not the K.C.) could have
told him that there is nothing objection-
able in this practice; on the contrary,
in the case of a rare vintage, it may be
the only way of preserving its spirit
from the ravages of time. So at least
the Peers seem to have thought, for by
a handsome majority they voted for
the fresh bottle.
The vociferous cheers with which the
House greeted its LEADER's announce-
ment that the Government had decided
to abolish the Liquor Control Board
gave place to groans when he imme-
diately added that its functions would
be transferred to a new Commission.
Even the prospect of unlimited “Gov-
ernment ale" at twopence a pint did
not comfort Mr. BottomLEY, whose
motto, in the matter of beer at any
rate, seems to be quality not quantity.
Encouraged by the successful issue
of their skirmish with the Government
over roads and docks the critics of the
Transport Bill sought to consolidate
their position by extracting a definite
promise that the measure should not
be used for the nationalization of rail-
ways. Mr. BRACE, for the Labour
Party, considered mationalization in-
evitable, but hoped the Government
would not commit themselves at that
moment one way or another. The
HoME SECRETARY was only too glad
to follow this advice, seeing that, as
Sir ERIC GEDDEs subsequently averred,
neither the Government nor any indi-
vidual Member of it has yet come to
a definite conclusion on the subject. In
some forms of locomotion our rulers
may be behind the times, but they are
unequalled at drifting.

BARGAINS.
I set out yesterday vibrant with
happiness, full of a new º:
joy. My heart was throbbing, my
whole being pulsated with the pure
ecstasy of being alive. Lots of other
women feel like that when they're
going to the sales. And this year there
is a hint of genuine reductions in the
sale-time atmosphere. |
So with a heart, as I have said, full
of lightness and a purse full of Brad-
burys I turned my face to the West.
I went into one of the big Stores and
approached an assistant.
“Have you got any bargains in cos-
tumes, or am I too late?” I inquired
eagerly.
I said “Am I too late?” because as
a rule, if you arrive five minutes after
the doors have opened on the very first
day of the sale, some invisible throng
of super-shoppers seems to have been
ahead of you, swept up all the delect-
able bargains you read about in the
advertisements, and vanished while the
shopwalker is telling you to take the
third turning on your left, eight shops
through.
But on this occasion I was in time.
“Yes, Madam,” murmured the assistant,
“we still have a large number of greatly
reduced costumes.”
My soul rejoiced. The world seemed
a pleasant place; the mountains skipped
like rams and the little hills like young
sheep.
“It's just a shopping suit I want,”
I explained; “something quite plain
and simple.”
“Certainly, Madam.

I was about to plunge my arm into
the sleeve when I was seized with
a paralysing numbness. I drew back
shuddering and pointed to the ticket
hanging from a buttonhole.
“What figure is that ?” I asked in
a hollow voice.
“Eightoen

“But I want something cheap,” I
said, “something that is reduced—a
bargain, you know.”

formerly twenty-two guineas.”
It was dreadful to feel the girl's quiet
scorn of me as she said that. Not,
mind you, that she was impertinent;
there was nothing in her actual words
that would justify a complaint to the
management. But, oh, how her un-
spoken thoughts lashed me !
“This is the kind of thing we have
to cope with in sale-time,” she seemed
to say, “a rabble that knows nothing
of the elegant world of our regular
customers;” and she sighed.

“Will you try it on, Madam?” she
asked aloud.
I was about to refuse when it occurred
to me that I should like to see how
I looked in a plain costume that cost
nearly twenty pounds. What grace,
what distinction such a garment must
give to its wearer. ... I put it on.
There was an odd silence and then
the assistant broke out with the usual
exultant expressions relative to per-
ſection in style, cut and fit, and winding
up with the solemn assurance, “It was
built for you, Madam.” But I felt that
her pacan of praise was only half-
hearted; for it was the bitter truth
that the costume did not give me an air
of distinction, after all. It even sagged
-a little at the shoulders and dipped a
trifle at the back. Of course my figure
was to blame. The eyes of the assist-
ant told me that. It was I, not the
costume, that was wrongly built.
“I’m sorry,” I said humbly: “I don't
feel I could pay all that.”
“We have nothing cheaper, Madam.”
In silence she handed me the shoddy
garment in which I had entered the
shop and which I had thought very
expensive when I paid ten pounds for it.
It is an awful moment being helped
into your things again by an assistant
who knows you don't intend to make
a purchase; chasms yawn between you.
Only the thin veneer of civilisation—
thinner than ever at sale-time—pre-
vents an open rupture.
I turned to go. And then a sudden
impulse prompted me to lower my
voice and say with disarming frank-
ness, “But, I say, you know, don't you
think it's an awful price to ask for
a costume 2"
For a moment she wavered. And
then a look that was almost human
came into her face as she whispered,
“It's terrible, Madam.”
“Miss was the other soloist, and played
most beautifully. She is a most sympathetic
interpreter in trios and quartettes, and throws
her whole sole into the work.”—Local Paper.
So that's how the conductor got his
black eye.

famous General, von Falkenwayni, has been

weary officer in the pursuing British Army
had the felicity of ‘sleeping in Falkenhoyn’s
bed.'
“If Germany goes down it will be honourably
and fighting to the last ditch and the last

boasts.”—Daily Paper.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THEN AND NOW.
THE time was July, 1914. The scene
was the great hall of Curfew Place, the
stately but rather dilapidated mansion
of the ancient race of Mouldy-le-Mall-
alieu. The persons were the widowed
Baroness Curfew and her younger son,
Raymond Raoul Rondebert Mouldy-le-
Mallalieu. “Oh, Curfew, Curfew,” cried
the old lady, apostrophising her absent
elder son as she looked round the lofty
hall, “to think that you, the degenerate
head of the ancient race of Mouldy-le-
the man Blogg, or that that glorious
dint should be touched by fingers pol-
luted with Blogg's Blacking. So the

YoU'LL FIND THAT YER FINGERS ARE of DIFFERENT LENGTHs so As To FIT UNDER THE PEAK of THE CAP.”
HOW TO BRIGHTEN DOMESTIG SERVICE.
WHAT is crudely called the Servant
Problem remains unsolved. Chloe and
I did our own washing-up again to-day,
or rather she did it and I encouraged
her by my conversation. -
None of the devices suggested in the
Press seem to give domestic service the
glamour necessary to make it attractive
to the maidenhood of our village.
Even the permission to wear mufti,
to dismiss daily at 2 P.M., to entertain
gentlemen friends in the drawing-room
twice a week, to use our gramophone
and our Christian names, has so far
failed to lure any young lady to our
assistance.
Chloe thinks that perhaps the very
word “kitchen” is offensive to deli-
cate ears, and intends in future, when
referring to this department in the
presence of Ladies of the Household—
or whatever they elect to be called—to
speak of it as the “orderly room" or
“your studio.”
She is willing to address her aides-de-
chambre in any way they choose—Miss
Jones or Jonesy, if simple Gladys or
Gwendoline is barred. (My suggestion
of “Your washup” she treated as levity
of the first water.) -
My own serious conviction is that
service on the domestic front must be
brightened by the introduction of that
sporting and competitive spirit which
in most other departments of life serves
to encourage esprit de corps.
To begin with, cooking competitions
for valuable prizes should beinaugurated
all over the country. In every district
Gastronomic Boards or Committees
should be constituted to judge, and the
winner of the local contest would re-
present her district in the county or even
the national championship. In this
way the names of prominent kitchen
artists would become household words,
healthy rivalry would be fostered and
public interest enlisted.
People of taste would feel it in-
cumbent upon them to know something
of the characteristic work of the local
champion. The most brilliant culinary
stars would very likely become
cuisinières errantes, and go on tour
about the country. Dining out would
acquire a new interest if every guest
was aware that in the preparation of
the dishes some well-known specialist
might have been concerned, whose style
people of culture were expected to
recognise; if one was supposed to spot,
say, a Mrs. Martha Brown amongst the
sweets as quickly as a Corot amongst
the pictures.
Other branches of domestic work
offer even finer opportunities for the
introduction of the sporting spirit.
Bed-making, for instance, regarded
as an indoor game, would become
much more popular than it is. One
can easily imagine public enthusiasm
being aroused and maintained for this
branch of household athletics by articles
in the Press discussing the system of
training, the moral and chances of the
various entrants for some big compe-
tition. Schools of bed-making—the
Graeco-Roman, the Catch-as-catch-
can—would develop each with its en-
thusiasts. Doubtless some QUEENs-
BERRY would arise to formulate rules
for the sport, some LONSDALE to endow
an embossed silver teapot for the
Heavy-weight Mattress Tossing Cham-
pionship of England.
The personal appearance, hobbies
and styles of the favourites for such
contests as the Championship of the
League of Bed-makers would become
familiar to the public through the
medium of the movies, which amongst
topical items would show Miss Daffodil
Smithson practising bolster-throwing
or quilt-squaring with her trainer.

[July 9, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Every girl in the country, thrilled
by the example of her illustrious sisters,
would emulate their achievements, and
thus not only would the pace and
methods of domestic work be infinitely
improved, but its popularity ensured
as yet another ladder towards the
pedestal of public idolatry.
SWELLED HEAD.
“WHAT we want in this country,”
said the man with the red tie, “is
equality of opportunity. Why ain't I a
lord and a duke 2 Of course I wouldn't
be one, not if I had the chawnce; lot
o' blinkin' parasites, that's what they
are ; but I ain't never 'ad the chawnce,
'ave I? No, nor you 'aven't 'ad the
chawnce neither. Why, any one of us
in this 'ere compawtnent might 'ave
the natural capacity to be the best
Prime Minister England ever 'ad, but
what chawnce 'ave we 'ad to prove it?
None at all. Because,” he ended loudly,
“we ain't got equality of opportunity.”
The old man in the corner woke up,
yawned noisily, rubbed his eyes and
broke into the conversation. -
“I got the biggest 'ead in the City o'
London,” he said surprisingly.
We stared at him. º
“Yus, I 'ave,” he insisted truculently,
though nobody had disputed his re-
markable claim. “There ain't a 'at in
the 'ole o' London big enough for me
—not a 'ard felt 'at, like yours.” He
darted a skinny finger suddenly at the
man opposite.
Taken aback for a moment, the
wearer of the “’ard felt 'at " got a grip
on himself. -
“Yus, there is,” he said.
“I tell yer there ain't—not a 'ard
felt 'at—not in the 'ole o' London.”
“And I say there is,” was the con-
fident retort.
The old man was annoyed. “There
ain't, I tell yer,” he repeated; “I’ve
bin everywhere to try to get a 'ard 'at.
'Ow should you know anything abaht
it? Your 'ead ain't no more than a
pimple alongside mine. I tellyer there
ain't a 'at-– Well, then, you tell me
where I can get a 'at big enough.”
“Well,” said the other, “I know
where there's one, at any rate. Out-
side old Jimson's shop—the one 'e as
for a sign. That's big enough, ain't
it 2 Abaht four foot 'igh.”
Plainly, in the old man's view, this
was trifling with a serious subject.
“We don't want no jokin' abaht it,”
he said. “I’m givin' yer fax, I am.
There ain't a 'ard 'at big enough for
me in London—not for sale,” he added
hastily. “Why, I once went into a
shop with a friend oo wanted a 'at,
and after the shopman 'ad served 'im
'e turned to me an' 'e says, "Don't you
want a hat?' 'e says. I says, “Yus,
if you've got one big enough.' 'E
laughed, thinking I was jokin', no
doubt. ‘Big enough ' ' 'e says; 'oh,
we've got one big enough.”
“All right,' I says. “Trot it aht;
but I'll bet five bob you ain't got one.’
“Well, 'e took the bet very confident.
'E tried on a dozen, I should think.
At last 'e give it up. "E looked at me
very respectful like, an' then 'e says,
‘Would you mind my tryin' the ma-
chine on your 'ead?'
“It was a machine something like a
typewriter, what fitted rahnd yer 'ead.
'E put it on an' fiddled abaht with it
an' took it off an' looked at it.
“‘Well,' 'e says— well!”
“Then 'e showed me a bit o' paper
with the shape o' my 'ead marked on
it. I never see anything like it myself
—not unless it was a map of Ireland.
“‘There,' 'e says, “it ain't your fault,
I suppose, but that's the shape o' your
'ead, life-size. You've won the bet.
The only thing I've got in the shop to
fit you,' 'e says, “is a 'at-box.’
“'E seemed a bit cross, but 'e cheered
up when I said I wouldn't take 'is
money. So there you are. There ain't
a 'ard felt 'at in the City o' London
what 'll fit me.”
He leaned back and surveyed his
audience complacently.
“Warn’t it GLADston E 2'' asked
someone, “what 'ad such a big 'ead?”
“That's it !” cricd the old man ex-
citedly. “My 'ead's the same size as
old GLADSTONE's was the same size
exactly.”
“Well, that's a case in pint,” said
the man with the red tie. “Equality
of opportunity—that's what we want.
If your fawther 'ad 'ad the money to
send you to college like GLADSTONE's
fawther sent 'im you might 'a' bin
Prime Minister of England.”
“I think it's very likely,” said the
old man. “Any'ow, I got the 'ead for it.”
Lord Leverhulme's Oversight.
[The Liverpool Daily Post announces the
association of a Newcastle company with
the “fish canning enterprises of Lord Lever-
hulme."]
WHEN his rank to a Barony earned an
advance
Lord LEVERHULME missed a superlative
chance;
For it's clear from his prowess in
company planning
That he ought to have chosen the style
of “Lord Canning.”
Commercial Candour.
“Rubber Gloves for protecting the hands,
while they last, 1/7% pair.”
“The Sun,” Sydney, Australia.
STILL ANOTHER PERPLEXITY.
LAST week Mr. Punch permitted me
to inquire how false stories come to be
invented and put into circulation. This
week I have a further problem to pro-
pound—a mere trifle, but one to which
I should dearly like a reply: What is
Truth? No more than that.
The subject has been worrying me
ever since my partner at dinner made a
certain remark. “How can you,” she
said, “take all that salt 2 Don't you
know that salt promotes gout 7”
I was never so astonished in my life.
I have always taken plenty of salt,
principally because I find things insipid
without it, but a little also in the belief
that it is a healthy accessory. And
this is the first breath of slander to
impair its fair fame. That I am inclined
to be gouty, I knew, but of all the
contributory causes salt would be the
last to occur to me. Quite the last.
Indeed I am not sure that my addiction
to salt is not in part due to a sub-con-
scious, unthinking belief that it is a cor-
rective to gout. As dogs instinctively
nibble grass when in need of medicine,
so had I probably taken refuge in salt.
And now I was to hear this, lightly
dropped in between talk of books and
ballets, but far from lightly received.
For it is part of my character to be.
lieve rather than to suspect. Strange
though it may sound, even after half a
century's experience of this sinful world,
my first tendency is to accept state-
ments at their face value, and only later
—or not at all—to set them under the
microscope. On this occasion, however,
I put the case, hitting me so nearly as
it did, to the company at large.
“Is salt bad for one?” “Does salt
conduce to gout 2" “Is one better
without salt at all ?”—such momentous
questions as these were passed about the
table, to the complete rout of MAssINE
and Lopokov.A, but with no reassuring
result to me, for every one differed even
as this morning's racing experts of the
newspapers differ as to this afternoon's
winners.
Since then I have asked several
medical men, and these also make con-
tradictory replies. And now half m
pleasure in food has gone, because, if
take salt with it, I am afraid I am doing
myself a mischief, and if I abstain from
salt there is a want of flavour. See
what harm a dinner-partner can do!
Meanwhile I return to the greater
problem, What is Truth?
“Pensioners are notoriously long-lived. The
last survivor of the American Civil War died
in 1869 at the age of 109. He fought as a lad
of sixteem.”—Weekly Paper.
He seems to have aged very rapidly.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
APART from its criticisms of certain individuals, Lord
FRENCH's 1914 (CoNSTABLE) is not very conspicuous for its
revelations on such debated matters as, for instance, the
change in voN KLUCK's plans. We get more detail about
those of Lord FRENch's own schemes which were thwarted
either from home or by the French Government. But
perhaps the chief interest of the volume lies in its revela-
tions of the author's personality. His courage and fore-
sight in resisting the temptation to seek refuge for his tired
troops in the walls of Maubeuge, and so avoiding the trap
laid for him by the enemy, shows him at his best and strong-
est. Elsewhere we often find him too much given to alter-
nation between sanguine hopes and unwarrantable fears.
And whatever he may have thought at the time, and what-
ever stimulus was needed to strengthen our thin line at
Ypres, he shows a strange lack of faith in the nation's
courage and resource when he asserts to-day that the break-
ing of that line and the consequent loss of the Channel
ports would have ended the existence of the British Empire.
Of the final chapter, in which he attacks the Government
of the day for their neglect to supply him with adequate
ammunition, we have not heard the last. It is noticeable,
by the way, as significant of Lord FRENCH's loyalty to his
friends (the volume abounds in generous appreciations), that
while he protests against the diversion of material to the
Dardanelles he has no word to say against the original
promoter of that campaign . . . Nothing in this book can
lessen the debt of gratitude we owe to Lord FRENCH for the
great part he played as Commander-in-Chief of our Expe-
ditionary Force, but its untimeliness is, I think, beyond
| question; and, whatever the relation may be between his
statements and the ultimate verdict of history, the indiscre-
tion (to use a polite word) of his attack upon those whose
lips are sealed is not likely to help either the writer or the
Empire in whose service he still holds an honourable place.
Admirers of “SAPPER's" short stories may have wondered
what sort of a job he would make of a novel, and in Mufti
(HopDER AND Stoughton) they have it, prologue, epilogue,
all complete. Sternly he keeps himself to the main path,
the digressions which were such conspicuous features of
his former work being negligible here; but the symptoms
of bitterness which he has lately developed are still to be
found. It is rather easy sport to hold a plebeian knight up
to ridicule by making him an almost impossible vulgarian.
“SAPPER" has better work to do. The light he throws
upon life as certain classes lived it during the War is a true
and useful light. The theme of his love-story, tragic in its
essentials but relieved by comedy and humour, is an ancient
one, dealing with the question whether a girl should marry
the man whom she loves or one whose wealth would save
her family from disaster; but it is made fresh by its war-time
setting, and no one recognises the changes that war has
brought about in the old order of things more clearly than
“SAPPER,” or writes about them with greater force. I need
hardly add that the dialogue of this story is excellent,
and I am convinced that Mr. CYRIL McNEILE has the way
clear before him if he can only keep himself out of the
rut of cynicism.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
That a private soldier in the trenches should have a tunic
button made from the brass of Aladdin's lamp, so that the
polishing of it evoked all the magical properties of that
vessel may well have seemed to Mr. W. A. DARLINGTON a jest
of the richest promise. But unfortunately Private Higgins
was of too retiring a nature to utilise the services of his
genie for the practical purpose of capturing the KAISER and
his High Command, and so bringing the War to an abrupt
conclusion. Inconsistently enough he sets himself the far
more difficult task, when on leave, of winning the hand of
a Society beauty by taking a large house in her neighbour-
hood and displaying great wealth and magnificence. But
in the trenches his enterprise is confined to comparatively
trivial ends, in which the supply of unlimited beer figures
largely. The most amusing effect, however, was undesigned.
On the first appearance of the genie Higgins, petrified with
horror, exclaimed, “Strike me pink!” with the result that
his skin took on a colour which demanded immediate iso-
liberality of writing a penny dreadful so as to make it worth
a pound.” Incidentally let me add that none but the youth-
fully impatient should miss this brief but quite brilliant
criticism by one who is himself a master of the craft with
which it deals. As to the actual intrigue here unravelled,
nothing shall induce me to give so much as a hint at it, lest
clumsy handling should supply a clue that would ruin all.
You must even accept my word for it that very seldom in
such a business have I been further from the truth or more
startled by its disclosure. And if, as always, attainment
was not quite equal to the rapture of pursuing, that is but
further praise of the ingenuity that prolonged this pleasure
to the last possible moment. ... --
My Rest Cure (GRANT RICHARDs) shows our premier jester
and War-fund accelerator yielding to the temptation, that
besets all accomplished artists, of attempting to express
himself in another medium. I owe so many laughs to
lation. Eventually he
was restored by the
same medium, but Cap-
tain Brown, R.A.M.C.,
whose treatment of the
unprecedented malady
had been an absolute
failure, claimed credit
for its cure and posed
as the sole authority
on what came to be
known in the medical
journals as “Brown's
Cisease.” . . . The won-

proved success; but in

due to the entertaining

and his own experiences in the War have given him a sound
knowledge of the speech and habits of Thomas Atkins.
His publisher, by the way, claims, I think, to have dis-

The pleasure you take in The Skeleton Key (CoLLINs) will
be overcast by the knowledge that it is, I suppose, the last
work we shall read from the pen of the late BERNARD CAPEs.
Not a page in the present book but proclaims eloquently the
extent of that loss. The tale itself is an excellent example of
the mystery or detective type; one of the best indeed that I
have met this great while, so well is its interest sustained
and so adroitly is the reader baffled. Usually in murder-
stories the sole interest lies in the game of spotting the
culprit ; the affair becomes a kind of contest between author
and public, in which the finer literary graces are too apt to
be neglected. Dut Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON, who contributes
a short appreciative introduction to The Skeleton Key,
rightly draws attention to the touch of dignity that Mr.
CAPEs never failed to impart to work of this kind, carrying
on the artistic tradition of STEvenson, in “the technical
those mischievous shrewd eyes, that telescopic neck, that
impossible bowler, and that air of genial impropriety, would,
I feel sure, have reduced me to the old helplessness.
The Taste of Apples (SKEFFINGTON) is a simple tale of
a delightful old shoemaker who had just a soupçon of .
genius, and his small round wife who existed to make pies.
They are Americans, sent by their wealthy son to have a
holiday in England. While “Mother,” by dint of admin-
istering much affection and even more pie, is rescuing
Wally Tilton, her son's old school-friend, from evil ways, the
shoemaker wanders about making friends with all sorts and
conditions of men and, true to his last, continually studying
feet. It is in the description of his adventures that a
memorable paragraph occurs: “One class stood apart—
well-shod, their heavy serviceable boots alert and com-
petent . . . firm on both feet, they overlooked the crowd—
the one class that stood neither to gain nor lose by unrest—
England's truly great ones—the Metropolitan police.” Mrs.
JENNETTE LEE's book, with the right page turned down,
will no doubt be left in public places by countless thousands
who share her enthusiasm and sometimes fear to find the
“alert boots” of their idol filled with common clay.

HIDDEN TREASURE.
As soon as Charles came in I asked
him anxiously whether he had any clue
as to the whereabouts of my gold safety-
in. I did not ask him this because
considered him to be the successor
of the famous sleuth-hounds of serial
fiction, but because about a week ago
he borrowed the bally thing and lost
it. If the narrative that follows ap-
pears to be rather melodramatic in
form you must blame Charles for it,
not me.
“Wait a moment,” he said, drawing
his hand wearily across his brow,
“and listen. I have had to-day the
most terrifying experience of my life.
I am still greatly overstraught and
unmung—I mean unmanned.”
“The cocaine has run out,” I said,
humouring him. “Some one left the
back-door open. Have a go at the lime-
juice.”
IIe drained a deep draught and con-
tinued.
“I took a bus this morning from the
Temple to the British Museum. I de-
cided to return by two Tubes and the
Inner Circle. I waited in the ticket-
offing until my turn came to be served.
As I was leaving the wire entanglement
the man behind me clumsily dropped
his change on the floor. I gave one
glance back before I hurried to the lift,
and met in his eyes a gaze of such
sinister ferocity that I was positively
appalled. My knees trembled under
me. A cold shiver ran through my
frame and chilled the very marrow in
it. I shall not keep my marrow in a
frame any more.
“The whole way down in the lift,
| across the intervening mass of heads,
this man kept glaring at me. The
| carriage I had to get on to was rather
crowded even for the Tube. I had to
run full tilt at the gateway and take
the wind of the passenger just in front
of me. Then the conductor slammed
the gate and the fellow expanded again.
You may not have noticed it, Watson,
but they are rather dangerous things,
these Tube gates. Once when I was
in uniform I caught the tape of my
right puttee in the thing as I got off;
then the carriage went on and I had
to spin round faster and faster on that
leg, with the other in the air, till the
train took the whole puttee away like
a streamer and left me spinning.
“But I have digressed. I did not see
the sinister man on that Tube or the
next; but when I was pushed off at
Charing Cross there he was wedged in
amongst the crowd a short distance
away from me, and still glaring at me
with the same expression of intense
and bloodthirsty hate. I felt absolutely
certain now that he was pursuing me.
I wormed my way out of the crowd and
hurried on I knew not and cared not
whither. Suddenly I found myself at
the foot of an escalator, but, alas, the
wrong one. It was going down, not
ul) *
P. You can't,” I hazarded.
“Napoleon once observed,” said
Charles gently, “that there is no such
word as ‘can’t ' to a man who has been
a field-marshal's batman.”
“Go on,” I groaned.
“Almost at the same moment with
the tail of my eye I caught a glimpse
of my enemy in hot pursuit. I was
overcome with unreasoning terror.
Almost without thinking I plunged up
the falling stairway and in a few seconds
I realised that my pursuer had done
the same. -
“The horror of the next moments will
be with me as long as I live. They
seemed an eternity. You realise that
the downward motion of the steps kept
counteracting my forward rush, and
for longer than I like to think we two
were pounding away, with our knees
almost up to our chins, on that terrible
treadmill.
“Cold beads of perspiration burst
forth on my brow. Mechanically I
counted them as they burst. How I
ever reached the top I do not know.
But reach it I did, with the foe hard on
my heels. With a desperate courage I
turned round and pushed off his hat
and had the indescribable satisfaction
of seeing him halt and pass rapidly
away from me downwards and back-
wards.
“For a moment the pursuit was
baffled, and I saw no more of him. 1
reached the Temple Station without
further adventure and was half-way to
my rooms when suddenly I heard the
sound of pattering feet behind me. I
suppose that my nerves were shattered,
for I know that I screamed aloud and
ran as I have never run in my life
before. My imagination played wild
tricks with me; I began to fancy even
that this was no earthly adversary at
all, but the reincarnation of some long-
dead spirit that I had unwittingly
evoked from the haunted shades of the
Museum.
“Nearer and nearer came his heavy
boots; nearer his loud pants. Just
before I reached the staircase to my
rooms a long skinny hand reached out
and clutched my shoulder. My heart
stopped. I turned and faced him, and
for the first time he spoke.
“‘Excuse me, Sir,’ he said, “but I
think you have half-a-crown of mine in
the turn-up of your left trouser-leg ’’
“And as a matter of fact I had.”
There was a long pause.
“Charles,” I said at last sadly, “why
have you told me these things?”
“They're perfectly true,” he said; “I
can prove it.”
“Yes 9 '' -
“Well, I thought I'd look at the
other trouser-leg while I was about it,
and I found your rotten old safety-pin
there.”
And he handed me the missing
trinket. EvoB.
THE POWER OF THE NEW NAME.
THAT bold actor-manager and brave
soldier, Colonel RoPERT Lon AINE, has
revised the title of Cyrano de Bergerac
to Cyrano pure and simple, after toy-
ing for a while with The Romance of
Cyrano. At the same time Miss LILLAH
McCARTHY, in her advertisement, is
printing St. George and the Dragons, the
original style of Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts'
comedy, in small type, and accentuat-
ing its sub-title, The Wise Bishop and the
Foolish Virgins; and the two changes
suggest that any vitalising virtues that
re-christening possesses might be tested
more generally. There are several plays
in London just now that might secure
for themselves really good runs if they
could be named again. Chu Chin Chow,
for example, re-dressed and called Open
Sesame, might be quite a success.
But the oddest development of the
moment in play-titles is that of the
forthcoming South African drama, Dr.
James Barry. Here is distinctly a new
idea. In default of acquiring a comedy
by the author of Dear Brutus and Peter
Pan, give another play his name, with
a slight change of spelling to avoid
trouble ! Could anything be more
simple or efficacious 2 Imitation being
a law of life, we may expect shortly a
melodrama entitled The Rev. Arthur
|Wing Pinneroe; a comedy of West
Country manners, to be known as
Somerset llaum; and an idealistic play
of American life and uplift since the dry
period set in, called Sam Drinkwater.
From a soldier's testimonial to a
patent medicine —
“I am writing of the splendid results I re-
ceived from your splendid —. I used it in
Salonika and it made my nerves splendid. I
cannot speak too highly of your splendid

splendid results to my comrades.”

Conductress (to punishably haughty young man who has just handed her twopence). “Two PENNY on Es?”
CHARLIE.
Charlie is a dog; I believe, though I
have never seen him, a little dog. Betty,
who owns, or rather owned, him, tells
me that he was born black, but one day
he got on to the roof–I don't quite see
how he could have, but these things
present less difficulty to dogs of Charlie's
breed than to those of others: at any
rate the point of the story is that to
get down he had to take a jump, which
frightened him so much that he became
perfectly white all over, with, as Betty
says, placing a fat finger upon her
own, “just a littu tiny black noshe.”
Probably you have guessed from this
chapter of his history that Charlie is a
'maginary dog and have begun to envy
Betty's mother because she has only
'maginary tax and 'maginary muzzle to
deal with on his behalf. But for naughty
tiresomeness Charlie is the peer of any
real dog who ever, wagging a propiti-
atory tail, grinned at his owner, and as
long as she had him Betty's mother
used sometimes to wish that she hadn't.
There was his tiresome habit of lagging
behind on walks which often neces-
sitated that Betty should stand in a
narrow shop doorway during the busy
hour of the morning—when in our
suburban village everybody who is
anybody goes shopping—stamping a
sandalled foot at him and screaming,
“Charlie, Charlie, 'tum here, Sir,” while
potential customers with empty baskets
struggled to squeeze in past her, and
satisfied customers with full ones raged
behind her trying to get out.
Then there were the occasions upon
which he elected to dash across the
flower-beds in the park and hunt 'mag-
inary rats in the shubberies beyond it,
spite of all Betty's shouts and even
tears (for a pure-bred 'maginary dog,
Charlie can be remarkably determined
and wrong-headed). More than once
at such moments all Betty's mother's
explanations (aside) have failed to con-
vince a park-keeper, and strained rela-
tions have threatened to ensue.
There was too the discomfiture of
Betty's little holiday governess. I know
that all governesses are conventionally
little, but Betty's was only just so much
larger and older than her charge as
enabled her to qualify for the post.
Betty, sitting demurely with her on the
sands at the seaside, called, “Tum here
and lie down besides us, Charlie; ” and
a large Australian soldier, unused to
'maginary dogs, rose from the shadow
of a breakwater and accepted the in-
vitation, to the great annoyance of
Betty's little governess, who is very
dignified.
All the same, since Charlie has been
given away Betty's mother has felt
ridiculously sorry that he is gone. She
misses the shrill admonition and en-
couragement which Betty addressed to
him all day long, misses even the sight
of the solid little boy next door who
sometimes looks over the garden-wall
at Betty, and in spite of all her efforts
to exhibit her pet to him has never yet
understood what Betty is playing at.
Charlie's exit came about in this
way. Cook's young man's brother was
discovered to be one of those soldiers
for whom the War is never going to be
over, who are still “carrying on ” with
unbelievable courage, though all the
rest of the world goes past outside their
hospital-walls savouring the joys of
peace. Cook's young man's brother,
or Joe, as his friends more simply call
him, has been brought by the Fate
who usually mismanages the disposal of
wounded soldiers, kind for once, within
a reasonable 'bus-ride of his brother's
young lady's mistress's home, and so
Betty's mother and Betty, and of course
Charlie, for dogs of his breed have dis-
tinct advantages where 'buses and hos-
pitals are concerned, set out one day
last week to visit him. Taking Charlie
was in the nature of an experiment.
Joe might have been one of those curious
people, like the little boy next door, to
whom 'maginary dogs are invisible, but

he wasn't. He saw him at once when
Betty called him to follow her into the
ward, held out a skinny arm and clicked
his fingers at him. When Betty, pant-
ing elaborately, for Charlie has lately
grown very fat, hauled him up and put
him on the bed—no nurse gainsaying
her—Joe pulled his ears and Charlie
licked his cheek.
“My word, Missy,” said Joe, with
Charlie curled up on the red quilt
against his well leg, “if I had a dog
like this it wouldn't half be company
for me, would it now?"
Betty nodded, smiling back at him,
but was, for her, so quiet that, as they
walked away from the hospital, her
mother looked down at the top of her
small round hat wondering.
“Where's Charlie, Betty?” she said:
“you're not looking after him."
“He’s sitting on Joe's bed. I leaved
him for tumpany."
Betty's mother saw a stray tear
splashdown onto the yoke of her frock,
sink in and leave a round dark spot.
Being her mother she didn't suggest
that there must be as many Charlies
in imagination as ever came out of it.
She only squeezed her daughter's hand
very tight for sympathy, wondering
what the chances are for a little
'maginary dog with even the kindest
owner who doesn't know he is there.

RESTAURANT D’ESPAGNE.
As I entered the expensive restaurant,
to my great surprise the head-waiter
hurried up and led me to a table. He
spread the carte de jour before me and
asked if I was sure I felt no draught.
He pointed out such things as were
good and such as were less to be de-
sired. He could not recommend this
as he would like, and, as to that, he felt
certain I should be better without it.
Directly the head-waiter disappeared
the wine-waiter was at my side to know
what I should like to drink. As I had
never before succeeded in getting any
unsolicited attention from this function-
ary I was still more surprised.
The meal began to arrive quickly
and was served with a rhythm such as
the best restaurants once were noted for
but latterly have disregarded : whether
because they have lost pride or because
their customers are unworthy of it, I
cannot say.
Several times the head-waiter came
back to me of his own accord to know
if everything was all right. At first
I thought I was the one privileged
person to be so preferentially treated,
but on looking round I found that he
was showing everyone else the same
fitting but unusual attention.
The table-waiters also were assiduous.
My own attendant could not do enough
for me and I never had to call “Waiter!”
once, or send other waiters to find him
and bring him back. No other waiter
came to remove the cheese before I had
done with it. .
Indeed it really seemed as though
the whole place for the moment existed
only for the comfort of each guest;
which of course is the right restaurant
idea, but is too often forgotten.
Towards the end of the meal the
wine-waiter reappeared, without being
sent for, to know if I required a liqueur
and a cigar.
The coffee was both hot and strong.
There was nothing in the bill that
was unjust.
Unfortunately I can't tell you where

THE LEAVE HAT.
It had long been a tradition that I
crowned each leave with a new hat for
Pamela, and it was a rite by no means
devoid of pleasure for me. The varying
expressions on Pamela's face and her
ultimate rapture were worth paying
for. But what I did grudge was the
number of golden hours spent away
among those strange creatures who
apparently reveal their inner natures
to Pamela, but to me are just soulless
mannequins.
Last leave, therefore, I hit on a new
plan.
The price of the leave hat had never
exceeded three guineas.
“Look here, Pamela,” I said, “I’m
going to make you a sporting offer.
We'll go and buy the hat to-day. Iſ
you choose it within five minutes it
shall be a five-guinea one; if within
ten, a four-guinea one ; and so on,
twenty-five minutes being the time-
limit. What do you think of it?”
Pamela thought a moment.
“Very good,” she said. “I’ve never
dared go to Jocelyn, but I shall this
time.”
We duly went to Jocelyn. Pamela
intimated that five guineas was about
her price. A gracious satin lady sailed
forward with a succulent model in each
hand.
“These are five guineas, Madam,”
she said.
Pamela turned both down in that
firm shopping tone which is my despair.
I took out my watch.
Suddenly she darted across the show-
room and plucked something from a
stand. “That's the hat,” she cried,
jamming it on her head. It certainly
suited her as well as all other hats.
“That's charming, and it goes per-
fectly with my frock,” raved Pamela,
with the light of victory in her eyes.
“How much is it 2 ''
“Three guineas, Madam.”
And only four minutes had run. Our
eyes met; hers darted fire.
“There may be one I like still better,”
she said venomously. Then she tried
on others, with a staccato “No” after
each. Thus ten minutes passed.
“You are now within the three-
guinea zone,” I whispered. “You had
better make sure of your first love be-
fore it is too late.”
So she did. But then she did a hor-
rible thing.
“I think I'll wear the new hat and
leave my velour to be done up,” she
said. “Do you think you could do it?”
Yes, for a guinea and a-half the satin
lady graciously thought she could. I
parted with four and a-half guineas
and we left the shop.

I was beginning to tell Pamela what
I thought of her when a large drop of
rain splashed my nose.
“Good heavens,” cried Pamela in
horror, “it’s going to rain on my new
hat! Oh, there's a taxi-what luck—

I fiew ; and once in the taxi I was
able to give her a piece of my mind.
“It was implied,” I finished up, “that

from a three-guinea one, the advantage
should be mine. It's the old, old –

“They can't have everything,” said
Pamela generously. “After all, l’ve
had quite a lot of nice things this after-
noon—a new hat, a done-up one, a taxi

peered to see what the taxi-meter reg-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIPLOMATS.
II.
MY DEAR HENRY,-Some people look
upon the diplomatic business as em-
ploying only Britain's picked brains.
With three exceptions, Bill, Ralph and
myself, or possibly only with one ex-
ception, myself, this is not exact. (I
am sorry not to be able to be certain
about Bill and Ralph in this despatch,
but I am a little cross with both of
them at the moment. Whatever his
private motive, Bill should have kept
an escape-hole open when sympathis-
ing with his Italian partner at bridge
the other evening; and there is no
reason why Ralph should have gone
the whole hog with his Jugo friends
just because he was out for the day
with them. It made my lunch with
my American friend, who is well
aware of the partnership, very difficult
to conduct yesterday. However, let
Fiume pass; we have more important
| matters to deal with than a mere port.)
Some people, on the other hand, re-
gard it as any fool's job. This is clearly
wrong. Beyond the intimate knowledge
of human nature demanded one requires
also an exact understanding of all the
nuances and an instinctive appreciation
of the margin one should allow—in writ-
ing one's official despatches, I mean.
As many a battle has been lost by the
failure of a careless officer to observe the
right official phraseology in making his
application for leave, so many a country
abroad has lost its whole position and
prestige owing to an incompetent diplo-
mat having concluded with—
“I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient
humble Servant, .”
in circumstances where he should, ac-
cording to paramount and fundamental
principles of international statesman-
ship, have written—
“I have the honour to be, with great
truth and regard, Sir,
Your most obedient
humble Servant, -
You note the difference—the vital, pos-
sibly fatal difference?
Some people again think that, as in
every other function on this earth, from
producing a first-class herbaceous bor-
der to making a success of married life,
the thing never has been and never will
be done properly in any instance with-
out the aid of that omniscient and om-
nipotent element, the Business Man. I
do not agree; not, at any rate, with
regard to diplomacy. Say what you
like of the inevitable habit of “availing
oneself of this opportunity to renew to
your Excellency the assurance of one's
highest consideration,” even at the end
of a letter where one has informed your
Excellency that there will be the devil
to pay unless your Excellency tenders
an apology, and that at once: but I
don't concede that this can be improved
upon by following the business model.
Anyhow, the diplomat doesn't feel
obliged to call every “Sir” dear, doesn't
flood his memoranda with proximos,
insts., and ultimos, doesn't assure one
of his continued attention at all times
to one's esteemed orders, and very rarely
notifies one that all future correspond-
ence must be addressed to that expensive
item, his solicitor. For my part I am
content that my country should con-
duct its correspondence as at present,
and shall derive no comfort from see-
ing its future letters bear a business-
like heading:—
A.B.C. and A1 codes used:
BRITISH EMPIRE,
Incorporating England, Scotland, Wales,
Ireland, India, et catera.
Head Offices: London.
(Branches all over the world.)
Ring : H.M. GEORGE W.
Prime Minister: D. LLOYD GEORGE,
Esq.
District Representative: Sir A. Blank,
R.C.M.G.
Terms : Net cash.
Telegraphic Address : “Britemp.”
Telephone No.: 1 (9999 lines).
And lastly, if my own sensations are
anything to go by, the diplomatic note
gives one a warm feeling inside, which
the business communication tries hard
but entirely fails to reproduce. When
a colossal firm calls me, affectionately,
“your good self,” I am filled with
horror and suspicion. But I am glad-
dened and uplifted when one of His
Majesty's Ministers Plenipotentiary
and Envoys Extraordinary has the
honour to be, Sir, my most obedient
humble Servant, , as they always
have, whatever may have gone before.
That this deliberate courtesy is main-
tained up till the very last minute the fol-
lowing incidents will show. The writer
of the despatches was His Majesty's
Consul in an outlying district in a very
troubled land. The subject matter of his
despatches was unusually enthralling,
to wit the advance of a riotous and blood-
thirsty horde, bent on burning every-
thing, especially consulates, and killing
everybody, especially consuls. The de-
spatches faithfully narrated the march
of events, and with infinite respect and
submission asked for aid. And, though
the danger was ever described as coming
more near and the aid as remaining no
less remote, the writer always had the
honour to be, Sir, your most obedient
humble Servant, John Smith, Consul.
It was not until the very last de-
spatch of all that the writer permitted
himself a slight, a very slight but ne-
cessary variation. Perhaps it was this
that brought the desired help. How-
ever that may be, he described how the
violent hordes were now within sight
and must but for intervention very soon
achieve their fell purpose locally. “In
which case,” he concluded,
“I shall no longer have the honour
to be, Sir, -
Your most obedient humble
Servant,
John SMITH, Consul.”
I, on the other hand, will conclude
this present despatch in the neo-Rus-
sian form, which was employed by the
Bolshevist Legation during its short
stay in our midst : —
Yours, CHARLEs.
TO A FALLEN HERO.
(Aeroplane propellers are being sold for
hat-stands.)
WITH no unsympathetic hand
I hang you in the hall;
My artist soul can understand
The pathos of your fall;
What glorious paths you might have
trod,
What stirring seasons had,
What feats performed ... Oh, Ichabod!
It really is too bad.
Shaped for a warrior's career,
Ere yet our combat ceased,
The heavens were your intended sphere
(Not Camberwell, S.E.)
Far from this humdrum home of mine
Your part you should have played,
Outsoared the lark, and been, in fine,
A really dashing blade.
You should have winged your way
through space,
But Fate, forbidding that,
Makes you a peg on which to place
A common bowler hat.
But obsequies you shall not lack;
In such I will not fail;
With muffled hammer let me smack
The sacrilegious nail.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 7th.-The Treasury
Bench showed no outward signs of its
recent defeat in the division-lobbies.
Captain WEDGwood BENN, disappointed
at seeing no symptoms of impending dis-
solution, inquired what the Government
were going to do about it. Mr. BoNAR
LAw may have been inwardly per-
turbed by the behaviour of his followers,
but he was not going to give himself
away to an avowed opponent, and re-
plied that the Government had not yet
even considered the subject.
Mr. CHURCHILL's recent contributions
to the Sunday Press evoked the curi-
osity of Mr. ARNOLD, who wanted to
know whether they represented the
views of the Government.
Mr. LAw's reply was a little
vague. “The articles in ques-
tion,” he said, “are in the
same position as the speeches
of my right honourable
friend.” The House was
left wondering whether this
meant that they were re-
garded by his colleagues as
equally unimportant.
“A Woman, Two Dogs and
a Motor - Car” would be a
good title for Mr. CHURCH- gº
ILL's next literary effort. The ſº
War Secretary could see no
reason why a Lady - Com-
mandant should not employ
her pets to guard Govern-
ment property. But he found
no escape from the horns of
the dilemma presented to
him by Mr. MACWEAGH-that
if the dogs were not muzzled
they were breaking the law;
and if they were muzzled
they could not protect the car.
In one respect, at any rate, the House
of Commons is a truly representative
body. It is as much subject to hot fits
and cold fits as the rest of us. Four
days ago it rang with cheers when the
PRIME MINISTER announced that WIL-
LIAM HoHENzoLLERN was to be tried in
London. This afternoon the cheers
were scarcely less loud when Colonel
A. MURRAY asserted that “no one par-
ticularly wishes the ex-Kaiser to be
brought over here.” This uncertainty
as to his fate must be very wearing for
the exile of Amerongen.
Warned by last week's experience,
Sir ERIC GEDDEs showed himself much
more accommodating than heretofore
to the critics of the Transport Bill.
He not merely accepted amendments
designed to fetter his financial freedom,
but of his own accord proposed to
limit to the trifle of £500,000 the sum
he might spend on any new service
without coming to the House for per-
mission. He thinks only in half-millions
In OW.
The Lords also spent a busy day in
considering the bureaucratic activities
of the Government. The dairy-farmers
of the West, who have been mulcted in
twopence a gallon by the Milk Com-
mission, found an ardent champion in
Lord STRACHIE, who accused the Minis-
try of Food of a dark design to capture
the milk trade in order to keep itself
alive. Lord RUSSELL as a motorist
complained that though Zeppelins had
long ceased from troubling, Dora still
obliged him to hide his light under a
bushel; and Lord HALDANE vainly
protested against a Forestry Bill under
which, he implied, you would not be

'E KICKs.”
able to see the woods for the officials.
Lord CRAwford replied that short views
were no use in arboriculture and ad-
vised the prophet of clear thinking to
procure “a mental telescope.”
Tuesday, July 8th.-The Housing
Bill had a rather rough passage in
Committee, and the Lord CHANCELLOR
was obliged to accept several amend-
ments, including one (moved by Lord
NorthBRook) which he confessed him-
self unable to construe. But he paid
no attention to Lord SYDENHAM's sug-
gestion that the Government should
appeal to the Bricklayers' Union to
abrogate the rule which forbids a man
to lay more than six hundred and fifty
bricks a day—for the very good reason,
no doubt, that if such an appeal had
any chance of success the Bill would
not be necessary.
An avoidance of anything like over-
statement is a characteristic of Mr.
HARMsworth's Ministerial style. Thus
when asked whether a Ukrainian leader
called GRIGoRIEFF had conducted pog-
roms against the Jews in South Russia,
and in many places wiped out the
whole Hebrew population, the utmost
that he would permit himself to say
was that GRIGoRIEFF was reported to
be “strongly anti-Jewish in his sym-
pathies.”
Mr. Swan is justly proud at having
elicited from the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER a statement that Victory
Bonds now purchased will be imme-
diately available for the payment of
death-duties, but nevertheless intends,
I am credibly informed, to resist as long
as possible the temptation to make a
song about it.
The Transport Bill com-
pleted its Report Stage, but
not without further attrition.
Mr. RAWLINSoN and Mr. MAR-
Riott combined in moving
that the Minister-Designate
should have only one Parlia-
mentary Secretary instead of
two. Only a very powerful
cause could on the second
day of the University match
* bring Cambridge University
and Oxford City into the same
camp; and although for a
time the Solicitor-GENERAL
put up a stout resistance he
was ultimately obliged to
send for his LEADER, who,
on seeing the forces arrayed
against him, surrendered at
discretion, took the Whips
off and so saved the Govern-
ment from another defeat.
On the Finance Bill Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN did his
best to induce the Coalitionist
Free Traders to defeat the
Preference proposals, or at least to
limit their operation to September 30th,
when the Government are pledged to
produce their whole fiscal policy. But
he met with no success. Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN stoutly resisted this attempt to
destroy at the outset his modest monu-
ment of filial affection, and adroitly
reminded the “wobblers" that it was
Mr. McKENNA, a prophet of their own,
who had imposed the duties enabling
the Preference to be given.
Wednesday, July 9th.-JENNY GEDDEs
flinging her stool at the Dean's head
in the High Kirk of St. Giles can
hardly have created more widespread
consternation than did AUCKLAND of
the same ilk when he broke the repose
of an unusually dreary Question-time
with the announcement that on the
16th inst. the price of coal would be
raised six shillings a ton. The fat was
in the fire at once. The miners' repre-

sentatives saw in the increase, which
the Minister had definitely ascribed to
the consequences of the SANKEY award,
a covert blow at their policy of Nation-
alisation, and clamoured for a new
Commission to investigate the causes of
the reduced output. This idea did not
find much favour. “Bar Bolshevists,”
boomed “Boanerges” STANToN. “Have
no economic freaks!” squeaked Mr.
MAcquistEN. And Mr. BonAR LAw
thought a Commission was superfluous,
since no amount of discussion would
alter the facts. The country has got to
pay the miners' wages in one form or
another, and it is fairer and certainly
more conducive to economy that the
cost should fall upon the consumer than
upon the tax-payer. - -
The few Members who remained
in the House for the resumed debate
upon Preference were rewarded by an
entertaining speech from Commander
KENworthy. Before the War, it seems,
he was an ardent Preferentialist, but he
has been converted from the error of his
ways by conversations with Colonial
soldiers and sailors, who, according to
him, never talked about Tariffs—this
does not surprise me—but were elo-
quent upon “the future organisation of
the world, the founding of a common- |
wealth of all people.” This does sur-
prise me, since it is not the experience
of others who have had the privilege of
conversing with these gallant fellows.
Is it possible that the Commander's
companions could have been indulging
in the favourite Colonial pastime of
“leg-pulling” ”
One or two Coalitionists spoke and
voted against the Government, but the
majority held firm, and enabled Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN to extend his Preference
not only to the existing Dominions and
Dependencies but also to any “man-
dated territories "-- hideous term ' —
which the League of Nations may see
fit to entrust to us.
Thursday, July 10th.-Although the
so-called Enabling Bill passed through
Committee in the House of Lords the
New Reformation is not likely to begin
just yet. The measure has still to ob-
tain the approval of the Cabinet and
the House of Commons, and even if it
survives these ordeals will only enable
the Church to legislate for herself sub-
ject to the approval of an Ecclesiastical
Committee of the Privy Council and of
both Houses of Parliament. In these
conditions Church reform is not likely
to exceed the speed-limit, and there is
little danger of His Grace of CANTER-
Bury figuring in the rôle of JEHU.
On the Third Reading of the Transport
Bill Sir ERIC GEDDEs made a praise-
worthy effort to live up to Mr. Bon AR
LAw's recent description of him as “one
of the most modest men I know.”- You
would think to listen to him that he posi-
tively enjoyed the network of advisory
committees in which the Lilliputians
had attempted to enmesh him. As for
the roads, to which he was supposed
to be an enemy, he was so enthusiastic
in praise of their construction and so
lyrical in description of their infinite
possibilities that Mr. JoyNson-Hicks
beamed with satisfaction. And the
climax was reached when, in announc-
ing the proposed personnel of the new
Ministry, he revealed the fact that, with
a moderation that astonished the House
no less than himself, he had included
in it only two officials of the North-
Eastern Railway.

mained obdurate. Sir RICHARD Cooper,

its “odd file,” saw nationalisation in
every line of the Bill, and moved its
rejection. He was nobly supported by
General PAGE CROFT, and insisted upon
challenging a division. The gallant
pair were duly named as tellers. But,
like the Needy Knife-grinder, they had
“none to tell, Sir,” and the Third Read-
ing was carried by 245 to 0.

IF FLOWERS COULD WALK.
IF flowers could walk about, I know
Daintily, daintily they would go;
To and fro along the grass
Prettily, prettily smile and pass.
I know that they would meet and talk
In coloured groups along the walk,
And, ladylike, with perfect ease
Bow low to every passing breeze.
I see them move and set afloat
Their clouds of perfumed petticoat
And chide with aromatic kiss
The baby buds that walk amiss.
I almost see them turn about
And spread their scented sunshades out,
Or pause and, laughing, lean as one
With jewelled smiles toward the sun.
But when the evening star hung low
Above the sunset's fading glow,
Back to the borders, light as air,
Like drifting rainbows they'd repair.
And then a perfumed prayer they'd say
And fold their fragrant frocks away,
And go to sleep like “my son John,”
Keeping their green silk stockings on.

bump my head against the ceiling and
bring the Postlethwaites through. You
know what these ceilings are.”
“We’ve never really had room for the
wretched thing,” remarked Prudence.
And then I had my idea. -
“We'll sell it,” I said ; “furniture is
fearfully scarce just nów and fetching
tremendous prices.”
“Splendid ' " said Prudence. “I’ve
been wanting some new silk stockings.”
As a matter of fact I had already ear-
marked the proceeds of the sale for the
purchase of pyjamas; but a husband
should not be selfish.
Next week the following advertise-
ment appeared in The Hampstead
Harbinger: —
Foh SALE.-A Table, kitchcn top, dining-
room legs; 30s. to good home.—Apply 7,
Peachblossom Mansions, West Hampstead,
between 9 and 6 on the 29th inst.
--- --- - :: >k
While we were sitting at breakfast
on the morning of the 29th inst. Pru-
dence suddenly said:
“Can you hear that noise, Joseph 2 ''
“Now you come to mention it,” I
replied, “I can hear a kind of murmur.
It sounds,” I added dreamily, “like the
voice of the sea.” I have a touch of
the poet in my composition and often
throw off little lyrics in my spare time.
“It sounds to me like a strike-
meeting,” said Prudence.
I went to the window and looked out.
At the entrance to Peachblossom Man-
sions stood a large crowd gazing up-
wards with anxious expectant faces. I
called Prudence to the window.
“Good heavens,” said she, “what
on earth has happened 2"
“Prudence,” I said solemnly, “there
has been a murder at Peachblossom
Mansions, and these people have come
to visit the scene of the crime. We
shall be famous at last; our portraits
will appear in The Daily Snap: ‘Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph Simpkinson, who heard
the dying screams of the victim.’ By
the way, did you hear anything last
might?”
“I heard something,” said Prudence,
“but I thought it was cats.”
“What you thought,” I said judi-
cially, “is not evidence. You must be
more precise in the witness-box.”
“And it's time,” said Prudence in-
consequently, “that you were off to
the City.” -
I put on my hat and gloves, kissed
Prudence, went to the front-door and
opened it. Without the slightest warm-
ing a large female of menacing aspect
shot over the threshold, struck me
amidships and felled me to the ground.
I rose stiffly and saw that she had
been impelled by the weight of a large
crowd behind her. -
“Madam,” I said, “there is some
mistake : this is not the scene of the
murder.”
“I saw you first,” she said trueulently.

“Whero's that table 2 I want that

A hoarse shout of protest rose from
the crowd, which now filled the hall.
“If you would wait a moment—”
I began. -
“Sammy' " she shouted.
“Coming, mother,” said a gruff
voice. I heard the sound of groans
and muffled cries of pain proceeding
from its immediate neighbourhood. . .
“My son,” said the female, her grim
face relaxing for a moment, “’eavy-

“I've got it,” she said exultingly.
“Got what?” I asked feebly.
“The money, of course,” she said.
“You forgot the money, you silly, old
thing.”
I looked at her reproachfully.
“Do you mean to tell me,” I said,
“that you, a frail woman, have tackled
the heavy-weight champion of Canning
Town for a paltry thirty shillings?"
“It wasn't nearly so bad as the
Bakerloo,” said Prudence cheerfully.
WAR’S AFTERMATH.
IN the old days I was not thought
much of as a cricketer. When I was
allowed to play at all, I went in ninth
wicket (unless we were one man short,
I went on to bowl. My first ball hit
the umpire at my end. He woke up
yawning and stretched out his arms to
their full extent. My next ball fell
within reach of the batsman. It was a
slow half-volley. Up, up it soared in a
beautiful parabolic curve. I watched
it sleepily. It reminded me of the dear
old howitzer I used to play with “out
there.” It looked as if it would never
come down. But it did—in the next
field but one.
It was then that I found myself
murmuring : “If the shoot is to be a
success, I must put on elevation for my
next shot.” -
It landed (without any assistance
from the batsman) full pitch on the
pavilion balcony. The captain began
to get nervous, and tried to take me off
by megaphone. The umpire at my end
“Wotabaht it, guv-
ner?” he said, breath-
ing heavily.
“Wh a t a b out
what?” I asked.
“That table,”
answered briefly.
I calculated my
chances against him
and dismissed them as
negligible. The main
thing seemed to be to
get rid of the table;
that gone there was
some hope that we
should escape with
our lives.
“It's in here,” I
said, pointing to the
bathroom.

seemed quite keen
about it, but the
square leg one object-
ed, and said I must
finish my over.
I depressed consid-
erably for my next
shot. The ball hit my
left toe (full pitch) and
ricochetted towards
the batsman. No one
knows what happened
to it after that.
However, they gave
me a new ball, and I
was satisfied. I had
bracketed.
The next delivery I
prepared with consid-
erable care. I had no
intention of discharg-
ing it until I had pro-
crowd, Sammy plunged into the bath-
room and reappeared holding the table
above his head.
“Table's sold,” he roared in a huge
voice, and then, ably seconded by his
parent, commenced to fight his way
towards the door. After a superhuman
struggle he won through, and the crowd,
inflamed by the sight of the table,
followed him out. I shut the front-
door, staggered back into the dining-
room and collapsed on the settee.
“Prudence,” I called hoarsely, imag-
ining that she must be hiding under
the bed, “Prudence 1"
There was no answer. A terrible
thought flashed into my mind. What
iſ there had been a murder in Peach-
blossom Mansions? I leapt up and
searched frantically through our little
flat. Prudence was nowhere to be seen.
Then I heard a knock at the door.
“They are bringing her back,” I
shuddered. Then, pulling myself to-
gether, I went to the door and flung
it open. Outside stood Prudence,
when I went in eighth). I was one of
those fellows who go on to bowl after
the wicket-keeper has taken off his pads
to have a try. I was usually put at
square leg when the off-theory man was
bowling, and long stop to the slow stuff.
Now I go on to bowl first.
There has been a war. I have in-
vented a new kind of ball.
It happened in this way. Our op-
ponents had scored 850 for none.
Most of our side had been carried into
the pavilion in a fainting condition. It
was very hot. There came a time
when the last bowler struck. He said
his union would not let him work
more than eight hours a day.
Then it was that our skipper, in his
coign of vantage on the pavilion balcony,
had a brain-wave. He put me on to
bowl by megaphone.
I was as fresh as paint. I had been
employed all day in receiving the ball
from the spectators on the other side of
the boundary, and returning it to the
bowler.
duced pencil and paper and worked it
out to a nicety. Then I ran up to the
crease and swung my arm. In an al-
most inappreciable space of time the
ball had vanished completely. The um-
pire signalled a wide.
After waiting in silence for a short
time he produced another new ball
from his pocket and ordered me to pro-
ceed. I argued the point. I said that
we hadn't seen the last of the previous
ball; that its muzzle velocity was six
thousand feet per second, and its eleva-
tion (as measured by my pocket-clino-
meter) eight-nine degrees five eight
minutes; that by all the brightest and
best of the laws of gravity it was bound
to come down somewhere; that if he
would not believe me he must at least
take the testimony of so eminent a
physicist as Sir Is AAc NEwTo.N; that if
he would only condescend to look at it I
had a copy of the Principia in my pocket
and could, I thought, convince him;
that, failing that, I had a crate of range-
tables in the pavilion.

When I found him adamant I ap-
pealed to the batsman. I explained
that a projectile with a muzzle velocity
of six thousand feet per second would
strike the earth at a very similar pace;
that I didn't want to frighten him, but
I had the range to a nicety—it was
twenty-two yards, no feet and no inches
to speak of ; that I was very sorry, but
I wasn't at all sure that I wasn't a
yard out in my calculations, and I might
have worked on a basis of twenty-one
yards; that I had forgotten to allow
for drift, which, as doubtless he was
aware, was not negligible when the ball
was new. In short, I exhorted him not
to place the onus of manslaughter upon
me, but to leave immediately.
He left. In fact, they all left.
They had not, however, gone very
far before a sharp exclamation from me
made them all turn round again (I had
gone to inspect the batsman's wicket).
“Look!” I cried. “It's an O.K.'”
They all looked towards the wicket,
and perceived that though both the leg
and off-stumps remained in situ, the
middle one had completely vanished.
Ignoring the risk, they rushed back
to the spot. Sure enough it was just
as I said. There was no trace what-
ever of the middle stump.

tones, “how is that 2." -
The man was shaken to the core.
Tears of emotion quivered on his eye-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PENSIONEERING.
SINCE I became the unwilling recipi-
ent of a stray portion of a Teutonic
obus, some two years ago, I have ac-
quired the board habit, developed along
| strictly medical lines. Therefore I was
not unduly surprised the other day to
receive a neatly typed but illegibly
signed missive summoning me to one
of those orgies which seem to form so
integral a part of my official life.
This document, however, departed
from its customary form in so far as it
hinted that a period was about to be
put to my term of service, and that, if
I could show myself to be suitably de-
crepit, a pension might be arranged.
Had this invitation found me still in
the state of disrepair from which I was
suffering some eighteen months earlier
all would have been well. But Time
the Healer, assisted by professional
masseurs, has done his work so effectu-
ally that my step, which was at one
time unsteady to the verge of syncopa-
tion, is now as firm as an army cook's
soufflé.
It was in a penurious spirit, there-
fore, that I decided to ride to London
rather than pay the first-class fare for
a third-class train service. Accordingly,
on the cessation of my labours of that
day, I set out on my two-and-three-
quarters h.p. (hen power) motor-bicycle
to ride to London. Whether it was
the fierceness of the sun or the fiery
temperament of my mount I know not,
but hardly had I traversed four miles
ere she gave a heart-rending sob and
ceased.
Of her exact ailment I am unaware,
but I am informed by those instructed
in such matters that she had “seized";
what she had seized I could not deter-
mine, but certainly it was not the bit
between her teeth. However, what-
ever may have been the cause, the
effect was that I had to furnish the
means of locomotion for myself, for my
so-called mount and for some hundred-
weight of baggage over another four
miles, back to the starting-point of my
endeavour, in an atmosphere so close as
to be almost adjacent.
Between the anecdote and my text
the connection may not at first be
evident, but all will be clear when I ex-
plain that by the end I had recovered
my long-lost limp.
I eventually reached my destination
by train and punctually the next morn-
ing reported as instructed. After I had
waited about an hour in the ante-room
and read all the files marked “Secret
and Confidential " which littered the
table therein, the master of the cere-
monies arrived. He took, I think, an
instinctive dislike to me, and, having
presented me with a hectographed form,
on which my name was mis-spelt in
one of the many ways that a life of
three years in the army has accustomed
me to recognise at sight, instructed me
to report forthwith to a certain military
hospital the other side of London, men-
tioning at the same time that, unless
careful treatment was meted out to it,
the door had a tendency to slam on
closing.
Nothing daunted and with a well-de-
veloped limp I proceeded as instructed
to the hospital. There I found the larger
part of the British Army assembled on
a similar mission. After an hour's wait
I was provided with some forms to fill
in, for the edification of the Medical
Officer. Amongst other questions was
the following: “What in your opinion
was the cause of your disablement 2"
I gave it as my opinion that a Ger-
man high velocity shellfired with malice
aforethought was the cause, adding a
footnote to the effect that I was not
bigoted, however, but prepared to be
convinced on suitable evidence that it
might have been the doctors who
operated, or rather excavated, after the
event.
After another wait of three or four
hours, during which the rest of the
British Army arrived, I was ushered
into the presence of the Medical Officer.
He promptly gave me another form
to fill in, to show his authority, and
then asked, “Whereabouts were you
wounded ?”
“Left thigh, Sir.”
“Then let me hear your heart.”
As he did so a look of ineffable gloom
spread over his face, but he continued
brightly, “Do your shin bones hurt?”
On my denial of this soft impeach-
ment his face fell as low as a bank holi-
day barometer, but still he carried on.
“Do you limp 2" he asked.
This of course was what I had been
waiting for. I showed him the limp.
A smile lit up his countenance and,
hastily seizing a buff slip, he inscribed
the mystic formula C.11 thereon, adding
as an afterthought the word “two "
in brackets, possibly to guard against
forgery on my part; but since he omitted
to place my name on the document and
even to sign it, the precaution seemed
to me superfluous.
This talisman he ordered me to bear
forthwith to yet another office. I did
so, and the officer, on his return from
lunch, said that of course the certifi-
cate was null and void, but that he was
delighted to see me and that in all
probability the M.O. would eventually
forward him an official document, on
the receipt of which I should be de-
mobilised and receive much money as
a pension.
Now my point is this. Had my bicycle
not “seized " (some object unknown) I
should have had no limp and conse-
quently no pension. (I know that the
income-tax will probably have to be
raised another shilling to pay for it, but
even then I hope to be the gainer). Of
course my right to the pension is un-
questionable, but still I think the public
should know how I came by it.

an American householder behind the Western front. The
sight of it was like that of a friendly face; interesting also
to find upon the cover a charming drawing of the house
and garden (showing, as the history books say, “cab-
bages cultivated at period"), about which I now share with
the author so many genial memories. Incidentally, a pity
that this admirable illustration has been confined to the
precarious existence of a paper wrapper; it is in every way
deserving of reproduction within covers, particularly since,
as a note informs us, the censorship regulations have held
up the photographs that were to have figured there. As
for the writing, that is as brave and humorously observ-
ant as ever , though, even for this courageous and witty
lady, the hopes-deferred of '17 and the trials of early ’18
were obviously not without their effect. The record stops,
to my disappointment, in August of last year, at a time
when, though the light was hourly growing, no one yet knew
how near we were to the full sunrise of victory. The
remedy, of course, is obvious, and I trust that the writer
will soon see her way to a fourth volume that shall include
the released photographs and tell us how reward came to

The only prejudiced thing in Mr. KEELING's little book
on Bolshevism (Hodder) is the lurid picture on the wrapper
of a tarantula with the head of LENIN (or is it Trotsky')
for a body. This is an error of judgment, as the value of
the book is its sobriety and tolerance, and it would be most
profitably read, not by the conservative-minded, but rather
by the wrong-headed stalwarts of the extreme Left, who
have, I am afraid, rather cold-shouldered our author because
he couldn't prophesy smooth things about the Bolshevist
régime. Mr. KEELING is a trade-unionist who has lived as
a workman in Russia since just before the beginning of the
War, and was actually, before his escape, employed in the
Education Office of the Bolshevist Government. He testi-
fies that, whatever be the idealistic basis of Bolshevism as
a creed to free humanity, in fact it is the most damnable
tyranny, using naked terrorism and complete suppression

of free speech as the only means of continuing in power,
and putting its detailed administration in the hands of axe-
grinding and axe-wielding scoundrels of the very worst
type. Mr. KEELING hoped that his fellow-workmen in
England might be glad to listen to his first-hand account
of the misery in which Russian working men who do not
happen to belong to the Red Army are at present living;
but he has found an England divided into two camps or
schools of prejudice, one holding that a Bolshevist can do
and mean no right (and that every malcontent is a Bol-
shevist); the other that a greedy capitalism has frankly
invented the legend of the Red tyranny. Not much of an
audience for a man who has a short truthful story to tell
for what it may be worth.
Messrs. ARCHIBAL.D HURD and H. H. BASHFORD claim
that Sons of Admiralty (CoNSTABLE) is the “first attempt
to give in narrative form a reasonably complete and con-
secutive history of the naval war.” Furthermore they
and is inclined to cry with A-ya, when by chance something
does run away from and not towards us, how delightful it
is for once to be hunter instead of hunted. So portentous
are the author's dinosaurs and mammoths and sabre-tooths
that one feels they could easily brush aside the centuries to
emerge from the arena of his pages and attack us innocent
spectators. Think, for just one instance, of a dicky-bird
twelve feet high and with the head of a crocodile, walking
delicately, intent on gobbling up mankind—it did, in fact
gobble up Mawg, and that, as it happened, most oppor-
tunely. The special point about the book is that, though
we have in a way known it all before, this world of the
fossils, yet in the form of a story, even though the plot is
of the simplest, it has a new and strange fascination. A
really jolly tale—of its sort—but who's for the simple life?
The invasion of Welsh fiction continues unabated, though
I have yet to find among the invaders one whose work

greater splendour in our

enthusiasms, combined
with knowledge and
sound judgment of naval

needed for such a task
as this, and the fact that
the authors have been
successful in their at-
tempt is due partly, at
any rate, to their refusal
to gloat over our vic-

from the one or two in-

had no reason to rejoice.

with specialists' accounts of various phases of the War

the War. One may not always be able to subscribe to
the authors' opinions about either men or matters, but in
avoiding anything in the nature of sensational disclosures
they have shown an admirable reticence and have handled
their task in a spirit worthy of it, which is high praise.
As a frontispiece to In the Morning of Time (HUTCHINsoN)
there is a drawing of the progenitor of all the villains of
melodrama carrying off in true kinema style the first-known
distressful heroine. He is called Mawg and she A-ya, and
they lived in the epoch of cave-dwellings and flint-headed
spears, of easy manners and no irksome complex civilisa-
tion. Mr. CHARLEs G. D. Roberts, putting together care-
ful notes from a bad dream and a good museum, Jhas written
a yarn which, even without the note which the publishers
thoughtfully enclosed for the benefit of the reviewer, I should
have had no difficulty in recognising as one “that depicts
the perils which surrounded our remote forefathers.” This
is even an under-statement, for in fact so amazingly are the
perils set forth that one has hardly a moment's respite all
the way through from the most fascinating apprehensions,
her that scepticism assails me. I very willingly admit the
probability that Mr. LLoyd knows more about the home-life
of South Wales than I do; in this spirit I accept en bloc his
elders, squires, ministers and other native products. But I
am driven to ask myself if he is perhaps a thought less
trustworthy on the habits of London opera singers. Would
they, for example, even in the off season and on holiday,
give al fresco recitals on the harp, or attend chapel in cos-
tumes of “scarlet velvet " ? It all leaves me with the
impression that, in neglecting to send a photographer to
Cwm Herlod, illustrated journalism missed the chance of
a lifetime.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 23, 1919.
INSPIRATION.
I EIRST met the Serbian major in the
spring of 1918 in the Chapel of the
Arena, Padua, studying through opera-
glasses Giotto's impressions of a busy
day in Hell. We went and had some
wonderful coffee-rums together in a
little resort off the Piazza Garibaldi.
I met him again in the late spring of
1919 in the Zoo at Cologne, quizzing
a moth eaten yak through a tortoise-
rimmed monocle. We went and had some
iced beer together under the chestnut-
trees by the Rhine side and talked of
many things.
All about us (it was Sunday) obese and
perspiring Teutons gargled their liquor
and hiccoughed Pros’ts and Mahlseits
to one another, the ladies' paper-under.
clothing rustling whenever they moved.
My Serbian shivered. “Och! hoch
woch! “The language of horses'—and
that is a libel on a noble animal,” he
quoted. “Pas jolie—heim 2 Allons-
nous.” We strolled down the riverside
towards the Hohenzollern Bridge. A
white paddle-steamer labelled “Hinden-
burg" flapped past us down-stream,
laden to the guards with cheering
British Tommies, en route for home and
demobilisation. A smart Hun police-
man saluted us punctiliously. Outside
a tall house the folds of a great Union
Jack stirred lazily in the evening breeze.
Signs of the times.
“First the Romans, then the Franks,
then the Austrians, then the French
again, then the Prussians, and now you,”
the Serb commented, modding his head
towards the flag. “Well, I wish you
could do something that none of the
other masters have done, and that is to
dilute the jargon. Listen to it all about
us. Oh, dreadful ? Reminds me of one
of your Channel steamers.”
Then suddenly we saw her. She was
threading through the moving crowd
before us, accompanied by a sky-blue
officer. She was petite, she was pretty,
she was smart, she was plainly not
indigenous. The Serb nudged me with
his elbow. “French, from the Liaison,”
he whispered. “Listen—follow.” And
follow we did, like a couple of the
most brazen vieux suivewrs, round the
Bahnhof, across the Dom Platz, half-
way up the Hohestrasse, drawn by the
music of that little woman's voice, the
purl of her laughter and the play of her
fluttering hands. At the corner of the
Ring the couple turned into a restaurant
and we turned back.
“Whew l’’ whistled the Serb. “What
a relief! Like a lark singing in a
parrot-house. She tinkled and rippled
like a baby brook, didn't she? I'll
wager she was amusing, too. Did you
note how that fortunate devil had his
head bent down to catch every word 2
How his shoulders shook—heim 2 ''
“Oh, yes,” said I. “Yes, they can
be very charming, Frenchwomen.”
He nodded. “Charming ! There are
none like them. I will tell you of a
little episode if you like. It was in the
early days of the War, just after our ||
disaster. My battery was wiped out
and they gave me a species of a job in
Paris–diplomatic work.
“One morning I was mooning in the
Bois, wondering what there was left in
life for a gunner without guns, when I
saw a lady walking in front of me with
two children and a nurse. A lady d'un
certain dige, vous savez; but oh, my friend,

kept my eyes about me, but never be.
fore had I seen such a perfect pair.
They were —”
He made a gesture in the air as
though to describe some Hogarthian
line of consummate beauty, failed and
kissed his fingers piously.
“Like that 2 " I suggested.
“Like that,” said he. “Exquisite.
“For half-an-hour I followed them,
worshipping. Presently she came to a
gate and lifted the latch, and I realized
that in a moment those wonderful
ankles would disappear and I should
never see them again. I called up all
my courage, stepped forward and
saluted.
“‘Madame,' said I, will you be very
gracious to an old soldier who has not
known much good fortune of late?’
“She bowed, smiling kindly—every-
body, I think, was sorry for us in those
days—and said she would do anything
in her power.
“‘Madame,' said I, ‘you have the
most perfect pair of ankles in the wide
world. They are beyond belief. They
are the most beautiful things I ever saw.
Immortal sonnets have been written
for far, far less. To-morrow I leave
Paris, go back to my people, and I shall
not see you again. But I have here in
my pocket a little camera. Could you,
would you, will you permit me to take
a tiny souvenir of your so exquisite
ankles to sustain me through the hard
time that is coming?'
“She blushed, she bit her lip, she
hesitated, she dimpled, then she backed
into the gateway and lifted her skirts
slowly jusqu'aw genoua.” He patted
his chest. “I have the photograph
here in my case. It has been a great
source of inspiration to me these last
years.”. He turned and tapped his long
fingers on my shoulder. “But is there
any other woman on earth but a
Frenchwoman who could have carried
it off with such grace, such dignity ?
Tell me that, my friend.”
“Is there any other man on earth
*:
but yourself who would have had the
frigid impudence to ask it? Tell me
that,” said I.
He chuckled and lit a cigarette.
PATLANDER.
DUNSLEY GLEN.
THERE is no road to Dunsley Glen,
I should not know the way again
Because the fairies took me there,
Down by a little rocky stair—
A little stair all twists and turns,
Half hidden by the spreading ferns.
High overhead the trees were green,
With little bits of blue between,
So high that they could see, I'm sure,
Beyond the wood, beyond the moor,
The water many miles away
Mistily shining in the bay.
Deep in the glen a streamlet cool
Ran down into a magic pool
With mossy caverns all about
Where fairies fluttered in and out;
Their sparkling wings and golden hair
Made dancing twinkles here and there.
I stood and watched them at their play
Until I dared no longer stay;
I knew that I might seek and seek
On every day of every week
Ere I should find the place again—
There is no road to Dunsley Glen.

IF you ever sailed on board the Polyhymnia
You'd have noticed in her Captain and her crew
An affection for their craft, whom they worshipped fore
and aft,
That was quite incomprehensible to you.
She'd a character as strong as any human,
She was wet and hard to handle in a sea,
But her charm was in the way that she spoke to them
all day,
Just as easily as you can speak to me.
You'd not have understood the Polyhymnia,
Except perhaps a sentence now and then,
But her fancies and her tales, in the doldrums or the gales,
Were like picture-books to simple sailor men;
Then they sent her off to cross the North Atlantic,
But she never told the story of the trip,
For she struck a floating mine well below her water line
And her crew were sent to man a standard ship !
A standard ship ! Poseidon and his Court
Made holiday to mock what time they saw
A ship that was no ship; for, though her lines
Were rigidly correct, she had no soul,
But only such a life as springs half-dead
From Government Departments, and she told
No legends, such as deep may tell to deep:
As when and why the coral insect learned
To be the architect of lonely isles
Set for the harbouring of weary craft,
Nor what shall happen when the starfish shine.
Not she, indeed, but droned unceasingly
Statistics of the shipyard whence she came
Correct, as ever, to the second place
Of dreary decimals, and these she would
“Submit for their concurrence” to the crew,
Who grew morose, then thin, and, staring out
From her bluff bows, saw madness in the seas
And raved at her; and then just in the nick
The pitying waves washed up another mine,
Whereat the crew, half-witted and unmanned,
Drave her thereon and took them to their rafts.
Now they're gone to sea again in the Euterpe,
Who's as fanciful and wayward as you please,
With the family complaint of a scarcity of paint
And a tendency to wallow in the seas.
She's the sister of their dear old Polyhymnia
And her magic is to comfort and condole,
So they fatten and rejoice
At the music in her voice,
As is common in a ship that has a soul.

THE PUFF OBLIQUE.
A DISTINGUISHED public servant has
recently written to a famous firm of
cigarette-makers to say that, though he
is not much of a smoker himself, his
friends have tried the cigarettes in ques-
tion and like them exceedingly. By the
adoption of this vicarious method a
wide field of disinterested testimony is
opened up, as may be judged from the
following examples:—
To a Butcher.—Mr. Jeremy Sweet-
apple, the famous Tolstoyan philan-
thropist, writes from the Garden City,
Letchworth: “Though a convinced and
life-long Fruitarian I am obliged in
honesty to admit that my son-in-law,
Sir Hercules Bludyer, who is unfor-
tunately an adherent to the carnivorous |.
heresy, declares that he owes his robust
health to the unvarying excellence of
the prime cuts which for many years
you have supplied to his table.”
To a Wine Merchant. — Sir Parry
Gorwick, F.R.C.P., the famous authority
on dietetics, writes: “I need hardly
remind you that both in my practice
and in my public utterances I have set
my face like a flint against indulgence
in any form of alcoholic beverage,
including ginger-beer. But it would
be irreconcilable with that character for
veracity which I hope and believe has
been ascribed to me in my profession
if I failed to place on record the re-
markable fact that one of my oldest
patients and friends, a nobleman who
has attained to Cabinet rank, has for
the last thirty years been in the habit
of drinking champagne and port pur-
chased from your firm at luncheon and
dinner daily, and now, at the age of
seventy-eight, has been selected to act
as Chairman of a Commission to inquire
into the Nationalisation of Distilleries.
Only the other day his handicap at the
North Thanet Golf Club was reduced
from 30 to 25.”
To a Tailor.—Lord Broke of Stoney
Stratford writes: “Owing to the severity
of present-day taxation I am unable to
continue my custom. But in penning
this reluctant valedictory epistle I
feel it my duty to state that my wife's
cousin, Sir Offley Richborough, who has
made a large fortune in synthetic sweet-
meats, tells me that your thirty-guinea
lounge suits are admirably cut and will
last with care for three weeks or even
a month.”
To a Publisher. — Mr. Siegmund
Nasalheim, the eminent pro-Bolshevist
Georgian poet, writes: “I have not
read, and, to speak candidly, I do not
intend to read, Mr. Hector Buck's Glory
of Empire. But the other day, while

grossed in the book that he failed to
notice his arrival at St. Albans and was
carried fifty miles further before he
realised his oversight. As he did not
belong to the bourgeois class, but was
wearing dungaree overalls, his testi-
mony was all the more remarkable.”
To a Mind-Culture Institute.—Mr.
Jim Jameson, the great Syndicalist
leader, writes: “Both by temperament
and experience I am profoundly con-
vinced of the futility of any study of
the past, literary or historical. But I
am an honest man and I cannot blind
myself to facts. My colleague and
friend, William Blathers, who has been
nominated for the post of Foreign
Secretary in the first All-Labour Min-
istry, tells me that as a result of a
six-months' trial of your ‘Mnemonic
Efficiency Course,' he has completely
mastered the names of all the capitals
of Europe. Not bad this for Blathers,
who is still known by hostile critics in
Newcastle as “Waffle-headed Wullie.’”
There was an old lady of Cheltenham
Whose boots had a great deal of felt

She said, “In hot weather,
If they were of leather,

THE NEXT BILL.
THE great man leaned back in his
chair. A thousand bell pushes sur-
rounded the desk.
“I shall, as you See,” he said, smiling,
“be in communication with some of the
more important of my assistant-under-
secretaries. But, as you will observe, I
have to be modest in my requirements.
Indeed, I had to show quite a stiff lip
to the House before making it sanction
the paltry provision now permitted—
that is, for three thousand two hundred
under-secretaries for Ways and Com-
munications, and for twelve thousand
assistant under-secretaries—though
how a department is expected to carry
on in this crippled way I don't know.”
“Still,” I suggested, “we may con-
gratulate you on the fact that your
policy is winning its way?”
The great man shook his head mourn-
fully, doubtfully. “Things are scarcely
as I could wish. For instance, the
offence—gross, as I consider it—of
making use of a steamer for a journey
from one coast town to another, between
which a railway exists, is still merely
a misdemeanour and not, as I feel it
ought to be, a felony. I can only hope
to strengthen the Bill by subsequent
amendment.”
“The Bill, then, if it takes the shape
you desire, will differ a good deal even
from the Bill as we know it 2 ”
“Certainly, I demand an unspecified
and quite unlimited number of assistant
secretaries. I must be able to create
new offices if I consider it necessary to
do so, even at the rate of hundreds a
day, without being troubled to go to
Parliament for permission in trivial
matters of this kind. In the midst of
all my work I cannot be expected to
remember to an odd hundred how many
employees of a certain efficient Railway
have applied to me for jobs during the
past twenty-four hours, and as I am
bound, if only in the country's inter-
ests, to take them on as secretaries, I
must not be trammelled by the thought
that all the existing offices are filled.”
“And what other powers do you
claim 2 ''
“I must have power to pay such
salaries as I consider suitable. It is
ridiculous to suggest that the employee
of a peculiarly remarkable Railway
should be expected to rub along on the
remuneration that would no doubt be
proper in the case of other people.
“I want also to secure the definite
abolition of all canals, coastal steamers
and roads—all of which lead simply to
wasteful competition with railways and
which in the past have made it difficult
for us to raise freights to the level to
which we feel they ought to go.”
“And does your ambition end
there 2 " I asked.
“No,” he said, as he rose to conclude
the interview ; “I shall not be satisfied
until the nation as a whole realises
that upon the railways, and ultimately
upon the most efficient line of all, its
happiness and prosperity depend.”
TIHE HOUR OF TRIUMPH.
To-DAY my lady walks with pride;
And who has better right than she
To put an inch upon her stride
Who found a cook 'twixt lunch and
tea 2
What though her working hours be few,
Her wage the ransom of a king?—
More glory than NAPOLEoN knew
Is hers who caught her on the wing.
What matter if by Monday week
We hear that she has “changed her
mind ''
And gone some other place to seek,
As is the fashion of her kind 2
What matter if her trunk arrives
And leaves next day—accepted style 2
The triumph of the hour survives:
We’ve owned a cook a little while.

A WAR CROP.
WHEN the litter of warfare is finally
cleared up, one Y.M.C.A. hut I know
of will yield a choice crop.
It (the crop) was raised over the
period in which various minor States
joined the Allies. Thus, when China
came in, the manageress suggested to
our Colonel that he and his officers
should present the Chinese flag to her
hut. The Colonel approved, the flag
was got down from London, and the
manageress arranged a “Chinese even-
ing” concert. At this function the
Colonel unfurled the flag, and our pet
pianist played what the programme
declared to be the Chinese National
Anthem, during which we all stood at
“attention.” I was in favour of giving
three hearty “banzais,” butremembered
just in time that this is the Japanese
form of jubilant expression. A Padre
(ex-missionary to China) gave us forty
minutes of dynasties and chances of
converts, whereas we would have
preferred five minutes' compressed in-
formation in pidgin English. The rest
of the programme was commonplace
and insular. If the men hoped for
a free issue of edible birds'-nests they
were disappointed.
When Siam threw off the chafing
bonds of neutrality the manageress in-
formed our Colonel that Siam had done
so. A week later we attended a “Siam-
eseevening.” The Colonel did the unfurl-
ing as before. Our pianist hammered
the black notes and called his noise
the Siamese National Anthem—proba-
bly purest fiction, but we daren't risk
it, and stood solemnly at “attention.”
There being no ex-missionary to Siam
present, the Colonel made the 3ration,
and spoke about the man-power of Siam
as affected by that nation's productivity
in twins. Then we settled down to the
old familiar routine of “God send you
back to me” and Corporal Jenkins'
farmyard imitations.
When Cuba perceived on which side
truth and justice lay, we had a “Cuban
evening.” We unfurled the flag, stood
stiffly while the pianist played some-
thing Spanishy, listened to the Colonel's
thinly-veiled ignorance of Cubism and
the Cubes, and smoked Havana cigars
by way of compliment to our latest ally.
Even Liberia's timely bellicosity did
not daunt the manageress, the Colonel
or the pianist. The interior of the hut
began to look really bright. The Lib-
erian National Anthem sounded like
“Chopsticks" syncopated, and when
asked about it the pianist said they
were by the same composer.
As events moved the good work went
on. We grew thoroughly cosmopolitan,
and felt that our hut was the very key-
stone of the Allied edifice. It was a
blow that Patagonia failed to start.
We would have delighted to honour the
broncho rampant on a field of esparto
grass. The pianist would probably
have utilised that weird thing from
“Peer Gynt.” But we had compen-
sation in Panama, and “Peer Gynt."
was utilised after all.
That is how the crop was raised.
To whom shall the harvest be given "
Surely, to the League of Nations, as a
free gift towards the equipment of
G.H.Q., Geneva.

The harassed neighbours far and wide
Assumed (and rightly) that the wee
thing
Who made them muse on babycide
Was busily engaged in teething;
Its fretfulness was wholly due
To tiny molars hacking through.
But now another tale's to tell;
To-day one cannot gather clearly

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BOOK FOR ALL.
SELF-PRAISE, it used to be held, is
no recommendation ; but that was be-
fore the War. The War has altered so
many things that it may have altered
this too, and self-praise be the best
recommendation of all. Mr. Punch
hopes so, because he wants to indulge
for the moment in the pleasure of ex-
tolling one of his own products: he
wishes in short to urge upon all his
readers the merits of Mr. Punch's
History of the Great War (CASSELI, AND
Co.), which one of his young men has
been “assembling” in time for the com-
pleted volume—and a very handsome
one it is—to be all ready for book-
buyers as a Peace Day gift.
Having read the History from cover
to cover Mr. Punch is able to affirm
with perfect impartiality and not a
little pride that it is very well done.
The labour of compressing the record
of four-and-a-half critical and crowded
years, when so much was happening
simultaneously on different Fronts and
in different countries, into a small space,
and preserving lucidity and movement,
is no inconsiderable one, and the author
(who attempts to conceal his identity
under the initials “C. L. G.,” but fails
woefully with all those who peruse our
half-yearly index or who have read The
Hawarden Horace and The Life and
Letters of Sir George Grove and the
Diversions of a Music Lover) is to be
felicitated upon the skill and judgment
with which he has carried it out. He
has shown a fine discretion also in his
selection of quotations, both in prose
and verse, from the weekly issues,
which with consistent self-effacement
he always prefers to his own comments,
shrewd as those can be; and these pas.
sages, together with the profusion of
illustrations, are numerous enough to
give Mr. Punch the cordial feeling,
however illusory, that he is really both
author and artist himself. Since to be a
good-humoured trustworthy historian
has always been his ambition, we must
not grudge the old gentleman his glow.
Looking through this record, which,
after a brief glance at the immediate
antecedents of the Great War—culmin-
ating in TENNIEL's picture of Germania
with her indemnity leaving France in
1871 and being saluted with “Au
| Revoirſ"—settles down in August 1914
to a narrative that ends only with Peace
in the summer of 1919, Mr. Punch
finds himself almost too poignantly re-
living those difficult, grievous, wonder-
ful years. But with the pain is pleasure
too: recognition of the stout-hearted
gaiety of the race and all its smiling com-
posure under dark clouds. “C. L. G.”
indeed, when writing of those early days
of the War, when humanity was horri-
fied by the ferocity of the invasion of
Belgium and the wanton slaughter of
non-combatants, takes h; readers into
a secret. “Let it now,” he says, “be
frankly owned that in the shock of this
discovery Mr. Punch thought seriously
of putting up his shutters. How could
he carry on in a shattered and mourn-
ing world? The chronicle that follows
shows how it became possible, thanks
to the temper of all our people in all
parts of the Empire, above all to the
unwavering confidence of our sailors
and soldiers, to that “wonderful spirit
of light - heartedness, that perpetual
sense of the ridiculous' which, in the
words of one of Mr. Punch's many con-
tributors from the front, “even under
the most appalling conditions never
seemed to desert them, and which in-
deed seemed to flourish more freely in
the mud and rain of the front line
trenches than in the comparative com-
fort of billets or cushy jobs.'”
It was Tommy, in short, who “gave
Mr. Punch his cue, and his high
example was not thrown away on those
at home, where, when all allowance
is made for shirkers and slackers and
scaremongers, callous pleasure-seekers,
faint-hearted pacifists, rebels and trait-
ors, the great majority so bore them-
selves as to convince Mr. Punch that
it was not only a privilege but a duty
to minister to mirth even at times
when one hastened to laugh for fear of
being obliged to weep. In this resolve
he was fortified and encouraged, week
after week, by the generous recognition
of his efforts which came from all parts
of our far-flung line.” These are indeed
gratifying words to read and treasure.
Regular readers of Mr. Punch's pages
will (like himself) find themselves back
again in time as they proceed through
this History, so many well-remembered
verses, grave and gay, cartoons and
social cuts, are here. Again we see
the KAISER taunting KING ALBERT with
having lost all; again we see the German
family performing its morning hate;
again the American Eagle swooping
from the West, and the CRowN PRINCE
imploring his father not to repeat the
mistake of applying the epithet “con-
temptible.” Here once more is the old
lady who had seen the KAISER riding
as bold as brass through the streets of
London, and who, if she had known then
what she knew later, would have called a
policeman; and here again the meatless
gentleman in the restaurant who tears
off a coupon in order that the band may
play five-pennyworth of the “Roast
Beef of Old England.”
We renew acquaintance with so many
old friends, not least of them being the
civilian bidden to the War Office who
undergoes such extremes of humilia-
tion and pride; and the North Sea
skipper with a sore throat who, on
being asked if he has ever gargled with
salt water, replies that he has been tor-
pedoed six times; and the charwoman
who during air raids never kept still
because she had heard that a moving
target is harder to hit. Again we see
the KAISER, the doomed egoist, despair-
ingly watching the sands running out,
while Mr. PARTRIDGE's beautiful draw-
ing of “Peace the Sower,” which dis-
tinguished a very recent number of the
paper, stands as frontispiece.
Everything, you see, is here, in very
noteworthy synthesis: the tragedy and
the comedy inextricably mingled, as they
must ever be, but as by more formal
historians they are not.
The book closes upon a note of con-
fident hopefulness for the future. That
a slightly over-emphasised tendency
towards frivolity and ebullience followed
the Armistice is conceded, but, says
“C. L. G.,” “when commonsense is
found in natures that are honest and
hearts that are clean, it may make mis-
takes, but not for long. No, the spirit
which won the War is not going to
fail us at this second call. Perhaps we
have only been waiting for the actual
coming of Peace to settle down to our
new and greater task. But,” he con-
cludes, “let us never forget the debt,
unpaid and unpayable, to our immortal
dead and to the valiant survivors of the
great conflict, to whom we owe free-
dom and security and the possibility of
a better and cleaner world.”
In June, 1915, “C. L. G.” reminds
us, the Germans were very angry with
Mr. Punch and honoured him with a
serious warning. His performances, he
was told, were diligently noted, so that
when the day of reckoning arrived he
might be faithfully dealt with. Has
not that day arrived 2 If so, can Mr.
Punch have been pardoned, for he has
heard nothing. If not, what can be
in store for him 2 If any loss of nerve,
any weakness in handling the varying
situations that arise so punctually,
should be noted by his readers, they
must attribute the cause to this un-
certainty and suspense. But he must
not be thought of as anything but im-
Penitent. =

KEEP calm, thou mighty ocean, calm, I say,
Over the recent outcome of events;
Let not thy salt tears rise and sweep away
The Sandville-super-Mare bathing-tents;
If any word of mine may haply save
The Pebbleborough bandstand, hear, O wave.
Thou art no longer all that thou hast been
(Before the silvery sausage leaped the tide),
The single practicable route between
The realm of England and the realms outside;
Where is the ancient trust, the old-time ring?
Broken to bits' But cheer thou up, old thing.
Content thee with the triumphs that remain;
Though all the earth were linked by keels unwet
And Honolulu half-an-hour from Spain . . .
And no ships ploughed the watery swan-path, yet
Thou hast romances still, thy shining shore
Shall make perpetual castles as of yore.
With huge despatches from The Daily Mail
From continent to continent we spin,
Contemptuous of thy green and outgrown pale;
But who shall rob thee of thy buckets, tin,
The slippery rocks whereon the starfish roam,
And all the spoil of sea-weed trailing home;
The millions who ne'er braved thy heaving breast
And never shall, by barque nor by balloon,
But only ask of thee a quiet rest
Under an outspread handkerchief at noon,
Who have not shared the stout explorer's thrill,
Or if they have—in sailing-boats—felt ill;
Who care not greatly how the trade-routes run
So long as they have ham and eggs for tea,
And count all kinds of ships as rather fun
To look at, by thy silvern side, O sea,
Or two miles off (they called it “Ocean Glimpse”)
Love thee and worship thee and prod for shrimps?
Thou hast thine ozone and a sun that shines
On parboiled asphalt, and thy lodgings dear,
Whelks and innumerable fishing-lines,
The fringes of a southward-facing pier;
Therefore be calm, O ocean—men may break
Thine ancient power, these things they cannot take.
Let not thine unavailing passions rise
Against the prowess of our gas-filled craft,
Whereon so few that love thee have set eyes
And fewer still would know the fore from aft;
In other words, O sea, keep mild and fair
When I go down to Winkleton-sur-Mer. EvoB.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 14th.-In the opinion
of Lord BALFour of BURLEIGH the
practice of “dilution” as applied to the
House of Lords has been carried too
far, with the result that the blue blood
of the peerage is now very little thicker
than Government ale. Lord CURZON,
himself an example of both old and
new creations, admitted that there had
been a considerable increase
in the output of hereditary
titles, but pleaded in defence
that it had not kept pace with
the increase in the population.
Ahundred years ago there was
one peer per forty-three thou-
sand; now the proportion was
only one per sixty thousand.
The advocates of “equality of
opportunity” have here dis-
tinct ground for complaint.
Why should the infant of 1919
have thirty per cent, less
chance of obtaining a coronet
than his predecessor of 1815?
It is true that, as Lord SALIS-
BURY complained with some
bitterness, comparatively few
of the new Peers ever visit the
House of Lords after their %
first introduction. Possibly */
they consider that they have
already made sufficient sacri-
fices for their country.
If all the Peers' debates
were as lively as that of this
afternoon there would be no
lack of attendance. Nomin-
ally the subject under discus-
sion was the Forestry. Bill; gº
really it was the question of \
the merits or demerits of the
squirrel. That engaging little
creature found stalwart de-
fenders in Lords BUCKMAs-
TER, PHILLIMORE and BRYCE,
to the last named of whom its
hirsute appendages make a
special appeal; and an equally
uncompromising opponent in
Lord CRAWFORD, who, while
yielding to none in his admir-
ation of its delightful acrobatics, in-
sisted that its destructive qualities
would be fatal in a Government forest.
A division was taken, and the “Anti-
Squirrels” had it by a narrow majority.
Most of us would, I think, be puzzled
to give a list of all the Ministers who
have sat in the War Cabinet since
December, 1916. Thanks to a blunt
inquiry by Colonel AUBREY HERBERT
we now know that the present “Big
Five” are the PRIME MINISTER, Lord
CURzoN, Mr. BARNES, Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN and Mr. Box AR LAw. It was
pleasing to hear from the last-named
that he and his colleagues had been
discussing for two hours that morning
the question of high prices, with parti-
cular reference to boots and clothing.
I should like to have heard Lord CURzoN
and Mr. BARNEs swapping sartorial
reminiscences, and the CHANCELLOR OF
THE ExCHEQUER discussing where the
shoe pinches, and why.
A renewed attempt to elicit from Mr.
Bosan Law he Government's inten-

tions regarding Ireland was unsuccess-
ful. He would say no more than that
“we do not wish to attempt anything
without some chance of success”—not
a very hopeful utterance in view of Sir
EDWARD CARson's Twelfth of July
fulmination in Belfast. As to that, he
promised that the Government would
administer the law impartially; but
when Mr. DEVLIN asked specifically
what steps would be taken to bring the
Ulster leader to book the impartial
LAW was judiciously silent.
The debate on the proposed increase
in the price of coal was conducted in an
appropriate atmosphere of gloom. Sir
AUCKLAND GEDDEs—Jean qui pleure, as
Lord R. CECIL called him in contradis-
tinction to the more cheerful ERIC–
grew more and more melancholy as he
pictured the disastrous prospects in
store for us unless the coal-miners
worked more and played less. But he
was careful to say that they were not
alone to blame; and this gave Mr. BRACE,
to whom the miners had wisely en-
trusted their case, a chance to
exhibit his sweet reasonable-
ness. If the Government
would hold their hand, he
said, he and his friends would
do their utmost to get the out-
put increased. The Govern-
ment, having gained their
main object and startled the
country into a realization of
its parlous state, accepted the
offer; and for the moment all
was peace.
Tuesday, July 15th.-Lord
MAC Do NN ELL invited the
Lords to insist that the Gov-
ernment should declare their
Irish policy “forthwith.” His
- own idea is that they should
- hark back to the abortive
scheme of the Convention,
- and disregard the talk of
“Dominion status,” which he
thought had greatly injured
the Irish cause. Lord SHAN-
DON, ex-Lord Chancellor of
Ireland, took the same line,
but with equal avoidance of
exact definition. “Something
in the form of a subsidiary
Parliament,” with control
over such economic questions
as were peculiar to Ireland,
was his prescription. The
LORD CHANCELLOR was in an
awkward position. Spokes-
man at the moment for a Gov-
ernment pledged to provide a
scheme of self-government for
Ireland, he is also a member
of the Ulster Volunteers and
liable to be called up for ser-
- vice at the whim of his im-
perious Commander-in-Chief. The most
accomplished “Galloper" would find it
difficult to ride simultaneously two
horses that insisted on going in dia-
metrically opposite directions. “Forth-
with '' is a disagreeable word in such
circumstances; “at an early date” he
suggested would make the motion more
acceptable; and eventually compromise
was reached on “before the end of this
session"—which, with this heavy obli-
gation hanging on to it, is in danger of
being decidedly elongated.

found the position of liaison officer

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
between the Foreign Office and the
Board of Trade more prolific of kicks
than halfpence, has been succeeded by
Sir HAMAR GREENwood, who is expected
to prove more pachydermatous. His
truly British manner of tackling in his
first reply the pronunciation of the
“Commission Internationale de Ravi-
taillement” greatly impressed the House.
An intimation by Mr. CHURCHILL that
the Army of Occupation in Mesopotamia
would be reduced and native levies
employed in its place lured Mr MAC-
VEAGH into an inquiry as to whether a
similar statement could be made re-
garding the Army of Occupation in
another country “not so far away.”
But the WAR SECRETARY was prepared.
“No, Sir,” he rapped out; “nor the
extent to which it is possible to trust
the native levies.” A very palpable hit.
Sir F. HALL, whose favourite sport
is mare's-nesting, asked the representa-
tive of the SHIPPING CoNTROLLER why
a certain cargo of wood-pulp had not
been brought home by the Aquitania.
Colonel LESLIE WILsoN replied that
exhaustive inquiries had revealed no
trace of the alleged cargo and distinctly
suggested that the hon. Member had
evolved it out of his own head.
The pertinacity of Mr. G. LockeR-
LAMPson, in endeavouring to induce
the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchEQUER
to remove the anomaly by which hus-
band and wife are regarded as a single
taxable entity, has met with some re-
ward. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, while still
declining to anticipate the report of the
Income Tax Commission, agreed to in-
crease the abatement in respect of a
wife from twenty-five to fifty pounds.
A slight restraint on matrimony has
thus been removed and thousands of
existing husbands will find their spouses
all the dearer for being a little less
expensive.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer
was unable to give the figures of the
Victory Loan, but took the opportunity
of thanking those who had helped to
float it, “whether on the earth or in
the air.” This must not be taken, of
course, as a confession that he has been
engaged in “kite-flying.”
Wednesday, July 16th.-At the in-
stance of Lord BRAssBY the Peers talked
at large about Nationalization without
reaching any definite conclusion, poss-
ibly because nobody provided a clear
definition on the subject. Lord Ask-
witH, as an old Civil Servant, said that
if it meant putting the coal-mines under
a bureaucracy he should oppose it root
and branch. Lord HALDANE thought
the subject should be investigated—
which rather discounted his previous
praise of Mr. Justice SANKEY's conduct
of the Coal Commission. Lord MILNER
said he had an open mind on the subject,
and immediately afterwards observed
that there was an “irresistible" trend
of opinion in its favour. Lord SALis-
BURY, as one might expect, considered
an open mind a very dangerous thing to
have about you.
The Commons heard with satisfaction
that the Government had decided to
abolish the censorship at midnight on
July 23rd, but could not quite under-
stand why, having come to a decis-
ion, they should take a week to carry
it out. Mr. H. W. ForsTER said that
it “obviously" required some time to
MODERATE SUCCESS OF THE EX-
CHEQUER MANDARIN IN HIS LATEST
KITE-FLYING ACTIVITIES.
execute the necessary arrangements.
It would be too abrupt, I suppose, to
send all the censors a telegram, “Cen-
sorship abolished.” Some of them may
have weak hearts.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN firmly resisted a
proposal to raise the income-tax limit
to £250, but at the same time made
a further extension of the children's
allowance, which will have the same
effect in the case of every father who
has even three arrows in his quiver.
It is a pity that Sir Edward CARson
was not in his place to-night, for he
would have heard a lot of nice things
about himself and his recent speeches.
Mr. CLYNEs pressed the Government
to prosecute him, as they had done
humbler advocates of “direct action,”
and the ATToRNEY-GENERAL explained
how much he would have liked to do
so, but that the right hon, culprit, taking
an unfair advantage of his knowledge
of the law, had been careful to keep on
the windy side of it. -
Thursday, July 17th.-The modest
total of the Victory Loan rather startled
the House of Commons, which had
been led by the Press to expect at least
twice as much. The CHANCELLoR of
THE ExchEQUER, however, seemed quite
pleased with the result. As a very
large proportion of the 708 millions
subscribed is “New money,” he will at
all events have enough to cover the
anticipated deficit on this Year's Budget.
What if the holders of a thousand
millions of short-dated scurities have
obstinately refused to accept “con-
version”? At any rate the War is
over and he has enough to go on with.

MY DEAR HENRY,-The other morn-
ing I awoke from my sleep and, after
due consideration, stepped out of my
bed. Undecided what to do next I
went to my dressing-table and had a
good look round. I was still doing this
with great thoroughness, when my
attention was attracted to my last
night's handkerchief. Its whole atti-
tude was, to say the least, suspicious.
To be frank, it had tied itself into a knot.
Now, if I know anything about my
handkerchief, it would not do that with-
out some reason. The matter clearly
required looking into; in order to look
into it the more deliberately I hurried
back to bed.
suppose it was because I approached
the affair in this careless frame of mind
that my handkerchief got tied into a
knot, and so did I. If you ask me, I
think these old English ladies are just
a shade too charming.
I omit the earlier passages of the con-
versation, in which at the time I was
given cause to suppose that I acquitted
myself with great brilliance. I come at
once to the point, to which she came by
easy stages. She was about to return
to England; she had a native maid;
the native maid was about to come to
England also. Good. Her passport
was in order and ready for the journey.
Good. About the maid's passport there
was difficulty and delay. (A-ha”) I
should readily understand the para-
mount importance of the old lady and her
The only other noteworthy conversa-
tion I could recall was my remark to
myself as the ladies left us: “Charles,
this is an error which you will regret.”
That was the problem which in my
opinion justified my staying in bed that
morning even longer than I generally
do after the final decision to get up has
been taken.
When an official has before him ex-
plicit instructions not to do a certain
thing in certain circumstances until the
authorities at home have concurred, and
when he has also before him an explicit
knot in his handkerchief obliging him
to do the thing anyway and at once,
what happens next 2 I consulted all
the Secretaries, odd and even numbers,
the Counsellor's typist, and, best autho-
rity of all, the Chancellery servant, but

ficial of a foreign power,
desiring to bring his
country and mine closer
together or hoping to
expedite the peace or
intending to lure me
into the declaration of
another war, had asked
me to dinner. In dip-
lomacy it is more
blessed to receive than
to give. I accepted the
invitation. All the evi-
dence, as I looked about | ||
my room, proved that º
the dinner-party had \\ -
taken place the previous
evening and I had been
at it. This accounted
for the behaviour of

there was no precedent.
Either I had to per-
suade the authorities,
which was impossible,
owing to their being so
far away, or I had to
dissuade the old lady,
which was equally im-
possible, owing to her
being so near. Bill,
my soldier colleague,
having heard the facts,
ruled that this was un-
doubtedly a case of the
irresistible force ad-
vancing to meet the
immovable body, and
that I was the unfortun-
ate in between. I told
him it was no use talk-
ing like that at an in-
ternational crisis, and
so he got thinking.

Carrying my inquiry further, I elicited
the circumstances in which the latter
had compromised itself.
By some oversight, no doubt, my
hostess had allotted to me as partner a
lady who was neither the wife, the
daughter nor even the sister of a First-
class Ambassador. She was, to be exact,
merely the mother of the wife of a Third
Secretary, and that an English one.
That wasn't good enough, was it? I
mean, you can't frame secret treaties
with Third Secretaries' wives' mothers,
can you? And between one Englishman
and another, no secret treaty should be
necessary . . . However, there were
compensations. She was just as charm-
ing as only old English ladies can be,
and I welcomed a little holiday from
the awful strain of having to be so care-
ful what one says, and the still more
awful strain of having to say it in one
of those dreadful languages they will
persist in using on the Continent. I

once 2. Of course I understood ; the art-
ful old thing had postponed this question
until I was sufficiently fed to understand
anything she might care to suggest. So
much for her side of the case.
As for mine, it was my function in
those days to sign the passports of old
English ladies offhand, but to hold
up the passports of native maids long
enough to permit of an interchange
of amenities, by mail, between His
Majesty's representatives abroad and
His Majesty's representatives (all of
them) at home. I now found myself
publicly referred to as the most com-
petent and least red-tape man of my
time, and at the same time faced with
the alternative either of confessing that
in reality I had no scope at all, or of
saying simply and grandly, “You leave
that to me,” and hoping to goodness
that she would do no such thing.
I chose the latter alternative, and
she took me at my word.
lomat, failed to evolve a brilliant solu-
tion, Bill, the old soldier, at any rate
discovered the quietest way out. He
sat down to our typewriter, to stamp
out some draft despatches. (If type-
writing machines could be made more
like horses—easier, I mean, to handle—
Bill would be very grateful and affairs
would develop more rapidly; but that
is by the way.)
“Why regard yourself,” he said
between the thuds, “as in active oppo-
sition either to the lady or the autho-
rities 2 You should give in quietly to
both.”
I saw no sense in that.
“Give the maid her passport right
away,” he went on. -
“But what about the next act; the

ties 2 ''
“One is bound to make a inistake
sometimes,” said Bill, “and some mis-
takes are made by mistake, and some
are not.” Thereupon he handed me

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR PEACE NUMBER.
WE have begun to have our Peace—
we have really. They had a meeting
about it in the Sixth Form room, and
unanimously decided by six votes to ||
four to bring out the Peace Number of
the School Magazine, and it's out
to-day. - -
We are all expected to get a copy, or
what is the good of having a war?
There is some poetry in it about “And
shall the dastard foe come over here?
No, no!" It is very good poetry. Fatty
wrote it. Fatty is very good at poetry
and things like that. He does it with-
out having to think at all, so he says;
he gets something which he cannot
help, I forget what it is, but he gets it,
and then he has to write poetry, and it
passes off till next time. Jimmy says
he had a rabbit like that once, only it
wasn't poetry; it was eating its hutch,
and Jimmy cured it by putting mustard
on the wood. Rabbits don't like mus-
tard, Jimmy says, because it keeps
surprising them when they forget it's
there—you know. Fatty also wrote a
splendid piece about the battle of the
Dodger Bank; it ends up with “And
ten thousand German sailors bit the
dust, and more than that we trust, and
more than that we trust.” It takes up
nearly a whole column, so you can tell
it is pretty good.
My name is in the Magazine—really,
I mean. It says, “T. Smith did not
bat." You see our second eleven played
the Parents, like we used to do before
the War.
I was sorry for old Jones minimus
in the match. It doesn't say anything
about it in the Magazine, because we
decided to keep it quiet, but Jones
minimus's father came in with one pad
on, and it was on the wrong leg. But
Jimmy got Jones minimus out of it all
right. Jimmy said that Jones minimus's
father was right-handed but left-legged,
and it was a sign of a good cricketer;
and besides N ELSoN did the same at
Trafalgar, only it was a telescope.
You would never guess who was the
last Old Boy to win a war medal. It
was Brown major's brother. You would
never think they would have had Brown
major's brother in the War at all, not
if it was ever so, but it only shows.
Taylor minor says that Brown major's
brother wasn't even in the secondeleven,
and one day he was asked in class
where JULIUS CESAR put his army in
winter-time, and he actually said that
CESAR put them into the Accusative
and Infinitive. Taylor minor says any
silly ass knows it should have been the
Ablative Absolute.
But Jimmy wasn't a bit surprised.
Jimmy says Brown major's brother
could hold his breath for three minutes
without going red in the face, and it
was because he was double-jointed.
He could make the joints of his fingers
crack any time you liked.
Then there is all about the entertain-
ment we gave for the Blinded Soldiers'
Fund. Fatty got it up, as a surprise.
We acted a play called Julius Caesar.
Some of the people had seen it before,
but they laughed just the same. It is
all about Brutus and Cassius, and first
he wouldn't and then he did, and so
Caesar gets stabbed, and he doesn't like
it, and says, “Et tu, Brute" in Latin,
just like that; and he had red ink for
the blood.
Fatty arranged it. Fatty knows all
about SHAKSPEARE; you see he is doing
him for an exam. at the end of the term,
that's why. He says he is called the
Bird of Avon, and he tells you in the
notes he put at the end of the book
what he means, so that you can answer
any questions they are likely to set you
on him.
Jimmy was in the play; he was
third citizen, and had to make a noise
like a crowd. Jimmy was very good at
it, and did it in his stomach; you'd be
surprised. He used to practise in the
playground when no one was looking,
and one day one of the masters heard
him and sent him to the matron to
have his temperature taken; he never
guessed it was only SHARspeARE.
Old Fatty played the part of Mark
Antony; he was very good at it, but
the people missed the best because they
did not give Fatty an encore after the
speech about “Friends, Romans, coun-
trymen, lend me your ears; I come.”
You see, that was where Fatty had
arranged for the play to end, and if
they had given him an encore he was
going to give them an imitation of
CHARLIE CHAPLIN.
But at the end of the play, instead
of saying “Encore!” they all laughed,
so you can tell they enjoyed it. Be-
sides, we made twenty pounds for the
blinded soldiers.
Oh, but there's lots and lots more in
the Magazine. One of our Old Boys
won the V.C., and he was asked to
write about it, but all he said was,
“Glad to hear you had a whole holi-
day; wish I was back again. Good old
school! T'lay the game, you fellows; ”
and, instead of signing his name with
W.C. after it or Esq. or any title like
that, he just put “Jumbo.”
It's all in the Magazine—it is really.
There was a young tender of mules
Whose language was ruddy as gules;
O ironical Fate!
At an earlier date
He had taken three Firsts in his Schools.
A FIDDLER.
A FIDDLER, a fiddler,
With scars upon his arms
And golden wound-stripes on his sleeve,
Who wanders by the farms.
His fiddle bow was newer when
He had it out in France,
And played to please the fighting men
And make the children dance—
A soldier, a soldier,
I knew it by his glance.
A friend I had here yesterday
Was blinded in the war;
He came to hear the fiddler play,
Who leaned against the door,
The fiddler, the fiddler
Who gave him one tune more.
The fiddler had a soldier's smile
(And trod a soldier's pace),
With just a touch of gipsy guile
And wheedling gipsy grace.
O soldier, O gipsy,
I saw tears upon your face.
A fiddler, a fiddler
Who wandered here by chance,
With golden stripes upon his sleeve,
Who fought for us in France.
Latest Matrimonial News.
According to Bulletin Russe (Lau-
sanne, May 15th) “a bachelor living at
Smolensk, who could not get rid of his
cook, in view of the law that prohibits
dismissal of employees, married her and
divorced her, after which he was en-
titled to turn her out.” Mr. Punch
trusts that the publication of this in-
teresting piece of news will not suggest
the corollary to any British husband
and tempt him to divorce his wife and
marry his cook in order to induce the
latter to remain.
“I have been asked if women are not spend-
ing too much on clothes. Of course there is
one here and there, as there always is, but as
for women generally I say 'No.' Take the
majority, they really cannot get sufficient to
cover them decently.
Lard, for example, has gone up from 7d. a
lb. to 1s. 10d., and even dripping that you
could get for 6d. is now 1s. 10d.”—Daily Paper.

the present fashion.

AND I'M SURE IT IS DUE TO THE DAYLIGHT
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By lír. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF I have any grudge against the distinguished editors of
The Memorial Biography of Dr. W. G. GRACE (CONSTABLE),
which has just been issued under the auspices of the M.C.C.,
it is that they have deliberately abstained from telling us
anything about his domestic life beyond the bare statement
that “in every relationship of family existence he was ex-
emplary.” I should like to have learned more of that
wonderful old lady, “the Mother of the GRACEs,” who helped
an appreciative but keenly discriminating critic of their
prowess; more, too, of “W. G.'s" work as a village
medico than a single anecdote illustrative rather of his
humour than of his humanity. But no doubt Lords
HAwkE and HARRIs considered that “the play's the thing,”
and so instructed their co-editor, Sir HoME GoRDON, on
whom has fallen the chief burden of the compilation. He
might, perhaps, have curbed with advantage his passion
for statistics. Batting and bowling feats, however mar-
vellous, tend, when reduced to figures, to become a little
wearisome. Happily they are relieved by plenty of char-
acteristic stories, few of them new, but none the worse for
that, contributed by a multitude of cricketers who played
with GRACE in his prime. As an example of his keenness
to teach them the game and to the end of a long life was
in the field, before increasing weight impaired his mobility,
it is recorded that he once caught a man at square-leg off
one of his famous “donkey-drops,” whereupon the retiring
batsman remarked, “The next thing that man will do will
be to wicket-keep to his own bowling.”
I am obliged to Miss ANNE Top HAM for calling her book
The Beginning and the End (MELRose), because it makes
me hope that perhaps she and I are in agreement as to
finding the beginning and the end of her novel very different
things. There are plenty of novels which begin well and
plenty which end well, and a few others rare and precious.
Miss ANNE Top HAM's book falls for me into the first
category, and her picture of Anne Arbuthnot living on the
farm with Aunt Sarah and Uncle John Binns (unlike the
aunt and uncle that usually adopt you in fiction, they were
neither ogres nor fairy god-parents), attending the Misses
Perkins' select academy, and learning to play “The Merry
Peasant" and draw woolly pictures of impossible cottages,
affords an insight into the nurture of the young female of
the lower middle class towards the end of last century,
which must prove gratifying to all interested in the young
female of any class to-day. From his first appearance,
however, I resented the intrusion of the wicked Roddy, and
with good cause, as I found later. I wish her creator could
have found something else to do with bright, brave humor-

ous little Anne. It is not that I regret her subsequent
marriage to a famous surgeon, who I am assured is every-
thing that is charming and whose only emotion on hearing
her story seemed to be hatred of her betrayer; or that I am
not satisfied to leave Roddy ultimately married to a plain
shrew and vainly longing for Anne's love and the com-
panionship of their little son; but because, when Anne
became a fashionable painter and began to mix in high
society, the delightful real-life atmosphere of the first
chapters was shut out. My vote is all for the beginning
this time, and, as it is the sort of beginning which takes up
half the book, only the reader who doesn't agree with me
will have any cause for complaint. - ºr
450 Miles to Freedom (BLAckwooD) is as thrilling a
story of triumph over difficulties as the War has brought
my way. It relates the adventures of eight British officers
while escaping from the hands of the Turks, and the
scarcely less exciting preparations which had to be made
with greater calmness than I was prepared to expect. . . .
I congratulate Mrs. Norris on the new twist she has con-
trived to give to her murder mystery, which baffled me
completely and will, I hope, equally baffle you. By the
way, counsel for young Josselyn's defence might have made
the point that murderers are not in the habit (as far as my
experience goes) of dropping their smoking revolvers into
their victims' waste-paper baskets. . - -
Mr. BARRY PAIN is entitled to claim that The Problem
Club (CoLLINs) provides at least a solution of the difficulty
of finding a new theme for humour, even if, as here, the
ingenuity of the device is more conspicuous than the re-
sulting fun. His plan is to suppose a select club, apparently
of the idle rich, since abundant leisure seems postulated
for the members, and set them each month some test of
ingenuity to be rewarded by a handsome pool. Let me
hasten to remove for you the apprehension roused in my
own, mind by the ambiguous title. Here is no question of
before their formidable
journey was attempted. It */
is a tale well told and worth %
telling, and my only grum-
ble against the authors,
Captain M. A. B. Johnston,
R.G.A., and Captain IX. D.
YEARSLEY, R.E., is that
they produced some con-
fusion in my mind by the
nicknames they gave to
themselves and four of their
companions in flight. This,
however, is an unimportant
detail in a story of great and
moving adventure. Starting
from Yozgad on August 7th,
1918, these sportsmen ar-
rived, “eight thin and weary
ragamuffins,” on British soil
in Cyprus on September
13th. Times and again dur-
ing this dash for liberty their
chance of success seemed to
sink to zero; lack of water

fight against, but perils of all kinds surrounded them by day
and by night. My hat goes off to the whole eight of them, and
in particular to their leader, Commander A. D. CochRANE,
D.S.O., “Providence,” the authors write on the concluding
page of this fine book, “was manifest in our escape, and we
see in it an answer to prayer.” In these materialistic days
I quote this statement with a certain quiet satisfaction.
I found . Mrs. Norris's new novel, Josselyn's Wife
(MURRAY), interesting in the sense that all reasonably
faithful pictures of contemporary American society, with
no special reference to war conditions, are to friendly
students of the very progressive descendants of the Pilgrim,
Fathers. It is an honest competent piece of work, avoiding
(perhaps) distinction on the one hand as it avoids banality
and ultra-sensationalism on the other, though it does pro-
vide a very determined vampire and something like a
murder. Poor Ellen Latimer, a nice thing, becomes Mrs.
Gibbs Josselyn, Gibbs being born a rich man's son and
developing into a successful painter. His father marries a
second time, and in due course Josselyn junior falls under
the spell of his young stepmother's beauty, a spell cast
with the most deliberate premeditation. The author and
the characters generally seemed to me to take this situation
like the giraffe intrigue, indicated above; from this admirable
opening it seemed to me that the humour declined as the
months progressed. What would Eliza, that eminently
practical lady, have said to such a waste of time? Only
one person can solve that problem; and I wish he would.
NOBLE GIFTS FROM NORMANDY.

But, though it's not in history, unless I'm much mistook,
He brought to us a fairer boon than even Domesday Book.

War;
We made the best of things, no doubt, and, leal to our
controllers,
We champed their soapy substitute between our outraged
molars; -

[JULY 80, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CASE OF PRE-WAR WHISKY.
I FIRST met Blenkinsop in the Spring
of 1916. We were sitting down outside
Salonika slaying mosquitoes and wait-
ing until either we or the Bulgars
received sufficient reinforcements to
justify a genuine offensive.
Blenkinsop arrived in command of
a mixed party composed of A.S.C.,
Sappers, an aeronautic unit, and a
draft of two hundred mules. As he
came out with a brand-new commission
to a line battalion there was no reason-
able ground to suppose that his tempor-
ary command was a suitable one. It
invaded the camp after the manner of
a travelling circus, and Blenkinsop just
blew into the Mess and left his various
dependants to settle themselves. He
seemed to be particularly fed up with
them—especially the mules.
In those days Blenkinsop was not
a person of striking individuality; his
outstanding characteristic was his
toneless acquiescence. He was the
most plastic, colourless and innocuous
Second-Lieutenant on the Army List.
Yet he concealed the germ of greatness.
He may have been with us a month
or two months—his personality was
too hazy to attach itself to time—before
he emerged from his obscurity. We
had been singing our unanimous hymn
of hate about war-whisky. It was a
periodical affair and served youth as
a safety-valve for accumulative restric-
tion. When we had said of the Gov-
ernment what Lady Macbeth said about
the spot, and all had spoken, the thin
small voice of Blenkinsop was heard.
“I have at home,” it said, “a case
of pre-war whisky.”
At the word whisky there was a roar
of mingled astonishment, disbelief and
ecstasy which submerged Blenkinsop as
the surf engulphs the feeble swimmer.
From that moment dates Blenkinsop's
first step upon the ladder of preferment.
The Colonel inquired about him, and
the Second-in-Command, who was a
connoisseur of whiskies, spoke to him
quite frequently. The saying went
through the camp, “Have you heard
that one of the Body Snatchers has
got a case of pre-war whisky?"
Blenkinsop became a welcome guest
of many Messes and always he was
pointed out as the man who possessed
a large quantity of pre-war whisky.
His popularity reached such heights
that, when at length he was appointed
to the Brigadier's personal Staff, we,
viz. the entire Mess of the Body
Snatchers, heaved as profound and
thankful sigh of relief. We felt we
had been carrying too much weight.
I did not see Blenkinsop again until
the Autumn of 1917. Our battalion
had been moved across to Italy, where,
in the early days of our visit, we throve
comfortably in a small Piedmontese
village. An admirable liaison officer,
one Captain Rignolletti Guidotti, in-
itiated us into the ways of the land.
He spoke beautiful English, informed
us where all the best scraps were likely
to take place, and was wiser than many
Generals; also he saw that we were
provided against all want. He steered
our Mess President through the diffi-
culties which encompass the stranger
in a strange country; he showed him
the futility of setting his hopes upon
roast sirloin in a goat and chicken
district; and put him in the way of
obtaining the rough, red wine which
comes from the South. Dearly we
loved our Guidotti, who adorned our
Mess in a blue-and-silver uniform which
carried us back to the high romances
of the Kingdom of Illyria.
Then one day the old evil of the
Northmen broke out in us and we
treated him to the saga of the whisky
cravers. He listened to our lamenta-
tions with the patience of a skilful nurse
humouring her unpractical charges.
“Wer' sorry, my old beano,” he said
sympathetically to the Major; “all
the whiskee have travelled West. Last
week your General got feed up with
the wine of Marsala and damn him
profoundly, and be'old, of the Staff
only Blinkersops have at home some
prehistoric bottles . . . I regret, old
beano, it is such a putrid egg.”
Two days later the General came
over to have a look at us. Accom-
panying him, red tabbed and immacu-
late with a piece of ribbon on his chest,
rode Blenkinsop. He had broadened
out and was less reticent than of old.
He told us a good deal about the home
strategy and ate an excellent lunch. Of
the General I can only remember one
incident. Towards the end of lunch I
overheard him whisper hoarsely to the
Colonel, “You’ll hardly believe it, but
there's a fella on my Staff who's got a
cellarful of pre-war whisky.”
A few months later Blenkinsop's
fame had spread to France and he was
appropriated by another General who
at the moment was too valuable to be
denied.
Last week I was lunching at my Club
in Piccadilly. I had not been seated
long before my attention was drawn to
two people entering the dining-room.
One I recognised at once as the General
of a famous Division; the other was, at
the first glance, a stranger. It was only
when I had made allowances for a heavy
moustache and a dignified and con-
vincing personality that I knew him to
be Blenkinsop. The man lunching
with me looked across at them.
“You see that fellow with General
Blank,” he said; “well, he owns a large
distillery—in Scotland, I think.”
After lunch I detached Blenkinsop
discreetly from his General. “Look
here,” I said firmly, “I understand that
you have a lake or a loch, or a litre or
some other liquid measure, of the stuff
which in the good old days Jeames
used to produce mightly about 10 pip
emma.” Blenkinsop attempted to shy,
but I hung firmly on to his red tab.
“Well,” I continued, “I have for three
long years subsisted on the Graves wine
of Macedonia, the rough, red wine of
Capri, 1917 vintage, and, at rare inter-
vals, a diluted mixture of HaO and
methylated spirit. I am a desperate
man and nothing but the key of your
cellar will placate me. If you refuse I
shall—f shall publish an authentic
account of your arrival at Salonika in
1916, illustrated with snapshots of
your command from my own camera.”
Blenkinsop turned pale and glanced
furtively at his General.
“It's all a dreadful mistake,” he
whispered hoarsely; “I did have a case
of pre-war whisky—but it was only the
case. My sister kept her rabbits in it,
and the sight of the hutch was so
exasperating to our Scotch gardener
that he joined up rather than endure its
proximity. I did try to explain the
joke,” he added apologetically, “but
nobody would listen to me.”
PASSIBUS AEQUIS.
[Noting the newspaper discussion, as to
whether Mr. LLoyd GEORGE is inclining—
in the French phrase—to the right or the left,
a correspondent hazards a guess at his possible
attitude.]
I SEE a Coalition cleft
And paths dividing right and left;
In the waste watches of the night
I ponder if the left is right; -
If not, I might be soon bereſt
Of followers in going left,
Whereas if left is right I might
Be doing wrong in going right.
To steal a march—an honest theft—
I see my chance upon the left,
And dimly, as by second sight,
Opponents “left" upon the right.
Yet right is so entwined with left,
Ilike weaver's warp with weaver's weſt,
That if I rudely cut the right
What's left is in a parlous plight.
O horrid choicel One course is left,
Whilst “centres" banquet CHURCHILL-
chef'd—
To have a soldier's heart for fight
And march ahead—left, right—left,
right.

'TAIN'T SHAKspeARE: IT's A CIRCUs.”
THE POINT OF VIEW.
IT is astonishing how quickly a bad
habit can fasten on a man; and there
is no virus that spreads so rapidly as
that of avarice.
But I was going to tell you about my
friend Luker, whom I found yesterday
frowning at a newspaper with an article
in it forecasting the Bank Holiday fes-
tivities.
“In my opinion,” he said snap-
pishly, “this water-pageant is quite
unnecessary.”
“But why?” I asked. “Surely it is
a good thing to use a day of rejoicing
like that for patriotic purposes. Why
should there be no more Peace cele-
brations?”
“I didn't say that,” he replied. “What
I object to is the river notion. If that's
all they can do, it's time we got to
work. We've all played long enough.”
“But Bank Holidays are Bank Holi-
days,” I urged. “You can't make peo-
ple work then. It's not in the British
character.”
“We've just had a Bank Holiday,”
he said. “Ridiculous to have another
so soon. It's criminally unsettling.
And particularly so with this kind of
tomfoolery.”
“You can't apply such a term to this
river pageant,” I said. “It will be
unique.”
“I don't hold with river pageants,”
he replied.
“Not with the KING and the Royal
Barge?” I exclaimed. “It ought to
be wonderful. I think it's one of the
most interesting things that has been
arranged for ever so long. We do so
little with our river, and here's an op-
portunity at last, and everyone is rising
to it splendidly.”
“I don't like river processions,” he
repeated.
“I hope some one will paint it,” I
went on. “Like a Canaletto. Or
that great Constable of a river fête
from Waterloo Bridge.”
“I don't care about river fêtes,” he
said.
“But why? You must have some
real reason,” I said.
“Well,” he replied, “how are people
to see them 2 Only from the bridges
and the banks. All packed tight. No
comfort. People don't live by the river
so there are no windows to let.”
“You’re worried about the absence
of windows 2 " I suggested.
“Of course I am,” he replied. “Don’t
you want people to be happy and com-
fortable 2—or are you, like every one
else, merely selfish? Personally I like
people to be happy. That’s why I
maintain,” he continued, “that river
processions are wrong. Besides, you
know what kind of language bargees
use.”
“Not Royal bargees,” I said.
“All bargees,” he affirmed. “No, pro-
cessions should be on foot, and they
should go where there are windows and
chairs. That's only common sense.
Processions are intended to be seen,
and to be seen under decent conditions.
Now look at the procession on Peace
Day. That was a sound idea—it passed
through the streets, between houses,
and every house had windows and
seats. That was all right. What I
hold is that, instead of having this river
nonsense in boats and barges, it would
be far better to repeat the Peace Day
procession. Lots of people never saw

it. I heard of thousands who were
disappointed, poor things! But what
do you care? You're just as selfish as
everyone else.”
“I'm afraid the project's gone too
far to be altered now,” I said. “But
there's something in what you say.
And of course the East End and the
City and Bloomsbury might have a
chance this time.”
“Oh!” he said quickly, “I wouldn't
change the route. That would be
absurd. After they've learnt the way,
too. No, the same Procession, the
same route, but different people. That's
how I look at it. And really ”—his
face lit up philanthropically—“really
I don't see why it shouldn't be repeated
again and again until everyone has
seen it.” . -
“But what about the dislocation of
industry and trade by these public
holidays?” I asked. “I thought you
deplored that.”
“Only when they are given to non-
sensical and practically private river
shows,” he explained. “For a fine, stimu-
lating, educative land pageant, such as
we had on Peace Day, I would set aside
any number of days.”
“It passed by your house, didn't it?”
I inquired.
“Yes, of course it did,” he said.
“Right past it. We had one of the
best spots on the whole route.”
“And you enjoyed it, of course?” I
asked.
“Me? Oh, I didn't see it. I let my
windows, as any sensible man would.
Just about paid my rent.”
BIRD-LORE.
V.—THE Cock.
THE kindly cock is the fairies' friend,
He warns them when their revels must
end;
He never forgets to give the word,
For the cock is a thoroughly punctual
bird.
And since he grieves that he never can
fly,
Like all the other birds, up in the sky,
The fairies put him now and again
High on a church for a weather-vane.
Little for sun or for rain he cares;
He turns about with the proudest airs,
And chuckles with joy as the clouds go
past
To think he is up in the sky at last.

TEHE LIGHTS THAT FAILED.
Mr. Punch has received the following
pathetic communication:—
“The Ministry of Munitions made
it known through the medium of the
Press that it had a special consignment
of Dover Patrol flares, suitable for cele-
brations on Peace night, price ten shil-
lings each. Joyfully I sent two pounds
for four flares six days before Peace Day.
Foolish people say the Government is
unbusinesslike in its methods. By
return of post I received an acknow-
ledgment of my money, with the assur-
ance that the flares would be despatched
in due course. Great were my prepara-
tions and numerous my guests to see
the unique display. Alas, no flares
arrived. Nevertheless the Government's
acknowledgment by return of post was
not sufficiently explicit.
a document worth showing, and most
of the guests considered the evening
well spent in beholding it.
“On the Tuesday after the Peace Cele-
bration a letter arrived bearing the stamp
of the Ministry of Munitions. Great
excitement. Could it be an announce-
ment that the flares were on the way?
No, it was simply another receipt.
Again dashed hopes.
“Yet the fault is largely my own, for
I find that in ordering the flares I was
I asked for
them to be sent for the Peace Celebra-
tion; I omitted to say which Peace
Celebration—whether the one to com-
memorate the end of the Great War,
or another in a few years' time. The
flares when they arrive will however be
useful as an illuminant if we are to be
stringently rationed for gas.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ADMIRABLE JENKINSON.
Poldunk's does not claim to rank
amongst the aristocracy of restaurants.
Its prices are on a scale that allows no
margin for music, superfluous cutlery
or ornamental printing. What the man-
agement save on the laundry bills the
patrons receive in the quantity, if not
the quality, of pudding. Therefore the
presence of Jenkinson as waiter was in
the nature of an incongruity.
It speaks much for the sterling worth
of Jenkinson that he did not descend to
the level of Poldunk's. In a measure
he raised it to his. By his mere hand-
ling of it a metal cruet would be trans-
formed into the semblance of a piece of
precious silver plate, and oleaginous
Irish stew served by him became an

terms when recommending me for the
Military Medal for 'aving successfully
participated in—ahem—a “stunt.'”
“And were you wounded ?”
“I did have the misfortune once, Sir,
to stop a blighty 'un (an Army expres-
sion, I may say), but I did not sustain
any permanent incapacitation thereby.
It was after the Armistice, Sir, that
the seeds of my trouble were laid. The
Hadjutant sent for me one day an'
remarked that it 'ad been impossible
to utilize my talents properly during
active operations, but now he would
like me to undertake the waiting in the
B.H.Q. mess.

it had been done by my predecessors
in a deplorable manner, although I

cident passed off. But somehow the
remark seemed to stick in my memory.
“Well, Sir, I was eventually demo-
bilised, an' the Duchess very generously
reinstated me with an hincreased honor-
arium. She resumed her celebrated
garden-parties, of which you may 'ave
read in the hillustrated journals, and
one day I 'appened to be serving tea to
the Dowager Lady Orpington and the
Bishop of St. Guffs when that chance
remark of the Hadjutant's came into
my 'ead. Simultaneous a cold shiver
ran down my spine. What would

ferential yet dignified, he
possessed the thought-

the hall-mark of the born
waiter.
“Jenkinson,” said I one
day, “what were you be-
fore you came here?”
“Before the War, Sir,”
he replied in modulated |
tones, “and for a brief
period after, I 'ad the hon-
our to be in the service of
the Duchess of Port Lock-
ington as first footman.”
“But why ?” I com-
menced, trying to bridge
in imagination the im-
mense gulf between the
Duchess and Poldunk's.
“I resigned the appoint-
ment, Sir, of my own voli-

would be little short of a
scandal. Then my nose,
Sir, began to tickle, asymp-
tom I had never noticed
previously, an' I passed
the remainder of the after-
noon in a fever of happre-
hensivity. From this time
honward I began to dread
the garden-parties,because
I could see my career was
threatened by a momen-
tary lapse. At last I could
stand it no longer, and I
presented myself before
the Duchess.
“‘Your Grace,” said I,
‘feeling unequal to my
duties I request permission
to 'and in my resignation.’

she, “I am perfectly satis-
fied with you.'
tion,” he replied hastily, as though fear-
ful lest I should have the temerity to
criticise a duchess. “On finding, Sir,
that the strain of the War 'ad rendered
me unequal to the duties. The sweet
to-day is tapioca, Sir, with jam.”
The idea of Jenkinson being unequal
| to anything on earth was so grotesque
that I reopened the subject on his return.
“The story, Sir, is somewhat lengthy,”
he said in answer to my inquiry.
“When war broke out I saw numerous
references on the walls to a certain
style of 'eadgear, inviting those who
it would fit to wear it. Judging that
it approximated to my size I ventured
to request the Duchess to dispense
with my services for a short time, until
the social situation was again stabil-
ized, so to speak. This she was graci-
ously pleased to do, an' I enlisted into
a very respectable battalion. I have
every reason to believe, Sir, that I
carried hout my duties as a soldier to
the satisfaction of my commanding
officer; in fact on one occasion he
am free to admit that conditions were
sometimes a bit difficult. 'Owever, I
was able to heffect certain improve-
ments, so much so that one evening
the C.O. invited the Brigade Staff to
dinner, with the hobject, as the Had.
jutant phrased it, ‘of showing the
rouge-embroidered nabobs at Brigade
that the old batt, knew something of
the art of taking nourishment decently.'
“As the evening advanced I'appened
to be serving sixteen or seventeen drinks
from a tray with one hand whilst ad-
mixing the necessary soda with the
other (really quite easy, Sir, when you
have learned the knack), when the
Hadjutant — a gallant soldier, Sir,
though sometimes given to levity—
suddenly remarked, “Jenkinson, what
would happen now if you were forced
to sneeze 2 '
“They all laughed, but I just an-
swered, 'Sir, the possibility of sneez-
ing on my part whilst performing my
duties is so remote that I confess I
'aven't given it any consideration.’
“Still, much against my will and to
her great surprise, I left her, Sir, an'
entered the service of Poldunk's.”
“But why Poldunk's 2" I asked.
“Well, Sir, you'll excuse me saying
it,” replied Jenkinson, “but I am
morally certain I shall sneeze sooner or
later in the course of my duties, an’ it
struck me such a calamity would be con-
sidered less of a faua pas at Poldunk's
than at some other places. An' now,
Sir, seeing that your coffee 'as got cold,
permit me to replace it.”
The problem of Jenkinson occupied
my thoughts to such an extent that,
next day, between the courses, I made
certain dispositions on my emptied
plate with the contents of a white
packet. Having done this I awaited
his coming.
“I hope, Sir,” said he, taking the
plate, “that you enjoyed the hash-
ash-ach-choo!!”
It had come, the impending calamity,
the long-delayed stroke Curiously
enough no one seemed to notice it,

but Jenkinson, exhibiting a discom-
posure that I am sure he had never
shown before in his life, rushed from
the room. I waited, expectant and
anxious.
He was back in a few minutes,
apologetic but again perfectly self-pos-
sessed, and there was something of an
air of subdued elation on his immobile
features.
“Sir," he began, “I owe you a
thousand apologies. Knowing the cir-
cumstances I trust you will forgive
me. But,” he continued, “I feel that,
'aving got that sneeze out of my system,
I 'ave broken the spell, so to speak. I
feel a man again, and confident that I
shall not be troubled with a similar
hebullition in future. Such being the
case, Sir, to-morrow I return to the
Duchess.”
“Jenkinson,” said I, “I congratu-

And emerging from the restaurant I
carefully emptied the remaining con-
tents of the white packet in the gutter.

ANOTHER SONG OF SIMLA.
(See “Songs of Simla " in recent num-

ON Simla's green and pleasant heights,
Instead of messy fields of gore,
I spent a year of rare delights,
Thanks to a freakish chance of war;
A very welcome change indeed
From chasing Turks and shedding
bleed
And slaying by the score.
What fragrant memories to my brain
The poet's dulcet warbling brings
Of that serene and choice domain
Where common men may live as
kings' -
IFor I have worked at A.H.Q.:
I've watched the Jakko monkeys, too;
And oh, a lot of things.
Those hungry Generals, lunching well,
I too was privileged to see;
And Mrs. Hauksbee's brilliant spell
Has lighted, I admit, on me;
Still of PELITI's teas I dream,
Which made of life a joy supreme,
And all for one rupee.
Strange skins from Akbar's store I
bought,
Sold, he bewailed, at losses vast;
I know the ancient sinner thought
“A fool! My crore approaches fast!”
Kim's haunts I knew, and, wandering
far
Through by-ways of the dim Bazaar,
Much curious gear amassed.
The foothills' headlong plainsward
plunge;
The far Himalayas’ mighty wall;
Prospect, Elysium, Boileauganj;
Mashobra, Fagu, Wildflower Hall;
Chadwick's impetuous, long cascades;
The Glen's cool depths and silent
glades—
I loved them one and all.
For war and martial ways I feel
A hatred which can never cease,
Yet, though to-day (demobbed) with
zeal
I praise the gods for my release,
I'll bless the Army all my life
Which gave me, in the midst of strife,
A year of Simla peace.

THE SANDs of PLEASURE.
LADIEs first, so we will start with
Jenny. Jenny is only nine, but she has
been to the seaside before and knows
all about it. She wears the fashionable
costume de plage, which consists of a
white linen hat, a jersey and an over-
crowded pair of bathing drawers, into
which not only Jenny, but the rest of
her wardrobe, has had to fit itself. Two
slim brown legs emerge to bear the
burden, and one feels that if she fell
over she would have to stay there until
somebody picked her up.
She is holding Richard Henry by the
hand. Richard Henry is four, and this
is the first time he has seen the sea.
Jenny is showing it to him. Privately
he thinks that it has been over-rated.
There was a good deal of talk about it
in his suburb, particularly from Jenny,
who had been there before, and naturally
one expected something rather—well,
rather more like what they had been
saying it was like. However, perhaps
it would be as well to keep in with
Jenny and not to let her see that he is
disappointed, so every time she says,
“Isn't the sea lovely 2” he echoes,
“Lovely,” and now and then he adds
(just to humour her), “Is 'at the sea? "
and then she has the chance to say
again, “Yes, that's the sea, darling.
Isn't it lovely 2" It is obvious that she
is proud of it. Apparently she put it
there. Anyway it seemed to be hers.
Jenny has brought Father and
Mother as well as Richard Henry.
There they are, over there. When she
came before she had to leave them be-
hind, much to their disappointment.
Father was saying, “Form fours, left,”
before going off to France again, and
Mother was buying wool to make him
some more socks. It was a great relief
to them to know that they were being
taken this time and that they would
have Jenny to tell them all about it.
Father is lying in a deck - chair,
smoking his pipe. There has been an
interesting discussion this afternoon
as to whether lie is a coward or not.
| Father thought he wasn't, but Mother
wasn't quitc so sure. Jenny said that
of colºrse he couldn't really be, because
the KING gave hind a medal for not
being one, lºut Mother explained that
it was only a medal he had over and
Father happened to be passing by the
window.
“I don't sco what this has to do
with it,” said Father. “I simply prefer
bathing in the morning.”
“Oo, you said this morning you pre-
ferred bathing in the afternoon,” says
Jenny like a flash.
“I know; but since then I’ve had
time to think it over, and I see that I
was hasty. The morning is the best
time.”
“I'm afraid he is a coward,” said
Mother sadly, wondering why she had
married him.
“The whole point is, why did Jenny
bring me here 2 " .
“To enjoy yourself,” said Jenny
promptly.
“Well, I am,” said Father, closing
his eyes.
But we do not feel so sure that
Mother is enjoying herself. She has
just read in the paper about a mine
that floated ashore and exploded. No-
body was near at the time, but sup-
posing one of the children had been
playing with it. -
“Which one?” said Father lazily.
“Jenny.”
“Then we should have lost Jenny.”
This being so, Jenny promises
solemnly not to play with any mine
that comes ashore, nor to let Richard
Henry play with it, nor to allow it to
play with Richard Henry, nor
“I suppose I may just point it out
to him and say, ‘Look, that's a mine’?”
says Jenny wistfully. If she can't do
this it doesn't seem to be much use
coming to the seaside at all.
“I don't think there would be any
harm in that,” says Father. “But
don't engage it in conversation.”
“Thank you very much,” says Jenny,
and she and Richard Henry go off
together.
Mother watches them anxiously.
Father closes his eyes. -
“Now," says Jenny eagerly, “I’m
going to show you a darling little crab.
Won't that be lovely?”
Richard Henry, having been deceived,
as he feels, about the sea, is not too
hopeful about that crab. However, he
asks politely, “What's a crab?”
“You’ll see directly, darling,” says
Jenny; and he has to be content with
that.
“Crab,” he murmurs to himself.
Suddenly an idea occurs to him. He
lets go of Jenny's hand and trots up
to an old gentleman with white
whiskers.
“Going to see a crab,” he announces.
“Going to see a crab, are you, my
little man 2" says the old gentleman
kindly.
“Going to see a crab,” says Richard
Henry, determined to keep up his end
of the conversation.
“Well, I never! So you're going to
see a crab?" says the old gentleman,
doing his best with it.
Richard Henry nods two or three
times. “Going to see a crab,” he says
firmly.
Luckily Jenny comes up and rescues
him, otherwise they would still be at
it. “Come along, darling, and see the
crab,” she says, picking up his hand;
and Richard Henry looks triumphantly
at the old gentleman. There you are.
Perhaps he will believe him another
time.
Jenny has evidently made an ar-
rangement with a particular crab for
this aſternoon. It is to be hoped that
the appointment will be kept, for she
has hurried Richard Henry past all
sorts of wonderful things which he
wanted to stop with for a little. But
the thought of this wonderful crab,
which Jennie thinks so much of, forbids
protest. Quite right not to keep it
waiting. What will it be like? Will
it be bigger than the sea? -
We have reached the rendezvous.
We see now that we need not have been
in such a hurry.
“There!" says Jenny excitedly.
“Isn't he a darling little crab? He's
asleep.” (That's why we need not have
hurried.) -
Richard Henry says nothing. He
can't think of the words for what he is
feeling. What he wants to say is that
Jenny has let him down again. They
passed a lot of these funny little things
on their way here, but Jenny wouldn't
stop because she was going to show
him a CRAB, a great, big, enormous
darling little CRAB-which might have
been anything—and now it's only just
this. No wonder the old gentleman
didn't believe him.
Swindled—that's the word he wants.
However, he can't think of it for the
moment, so he tries something else.
“Darling little crab,” he says.
Then they leave the dead crab there
and hurry back. -
“What shall I show you now 2"
says Jenny. A. A. M.
“Mr. G. H. Roberts said he was advised by
his financial advisers that the British sover-
eign, now worth 4 dollars in America, might
shortly depreciate to only four dollars, which
would mean the addition of 20 per cent. on
any article we had to buy in the American
markets.”—Provincial Paper.
We should advise Mr. RoPERTs to

Sir Donald MACLEAN. “THE PEOPLE IN THIs countRY wanT No Roman TRIUMPH.”
Lord CURzoN. “THE TRIAL of THE Ex-KAIs ER MAY very LIKELY NOT BE HELD IN LONDON."
Monday, July 21st.—For a time the
debate in the Commons on the Peace-
treaty was “roses, roses all the way.”
Sir DoNALD MACLEAN paid compliments
to everybody—to the PRIME MINISTER
for his “indomitable optimism,” to Mr.
BoNAR LAw for his “tact, courtesy and
ability,” and to Mr. Asquith for the
classic phrases in which he laid down
Britain's aims in the War—aims which
have now been accomplished. Almost
his only criticism was directed to the
proposal to try the Ex-KAISER in Lon-
don. “The people in this country,” he
said, “want no Roman triumph.”
The chief note of dissent came from
Mr. DEVLIN, who complained that Ire-
land had been left out of the general
settlement. He was told that Ulster
was the obstacle. Well, were there no
Ulsters in the countries that the PRIME
MINISTER had been helping to partition?
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE had no satisfac-
tion to give the Nationalists. If self-
determination was to be the test, it
must apply to Ulster as well as to Ire-
land. As for the Ex-KAISER, it was
right to try him and nowhere would
he get a fairer trial than in England.
There was no reason to suppose that
any of the neutral countries wished to
be the scene of the prosecution. Their
motto, I gathered, would be, “No rub-
bish may be shot here.”
Captain WEDGwood BENN wanted
to know why, if the cost of living was
so high, the Government did not remove
the embargo from such imports as mops
and flat-irons, cotton-duck and boot-
protectors, Saccharine and (of course)
cocoa. Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs in his
best professorial manner delivered a
little lecture on the theory of foreign
exchanges, the gist of which was that,
unless we imported less and exported
more, we were heading straight for
bankruptcy.
It is a pity that Sir John REEs' sug-
gestion that the cinemas should be em-
ployed to disseminate sound views of
political economy among the working-
classes did not receive encouragement.
A film illustrating the fable of “The
Belly and the Members” might be ad-
vantageously displayed just now in the
Yorkshire coal-field, where the miners
have yet to learn that they cannot
strike without hurting themselves.
The Forestry Bill sent the Lords on
another excursion into natural history.
This time it was the hare and not the
squirrel that came in for condemnation.
In a meadow the hare may or may not be
a timorous beastie, but in a plantation,
to judge from Lord CRAwFoRD's account
of its ravages, it becomes a ramping
and a roaring lion. “The hare with
many friends" is a misdescription, so
far as the Lords are concerned, for not
a voice was raised against Lord BLED-
ISLOE's proposal to class it with the
vermin that the Forestry Commissioners
may destroy on sight.
In moving the second reading of
the Ways and Communications Bill,
Lord LYTTON displayed a praiseworthy
zeal. But in order to throw up the
brightness of the future need he have
painted the past quite so black? To
say that our distributing system had
only escaped a disaster similar to that
of Russia. “by the very narrowest
margin '' is surely unjustified, even if
the noble Lord has been travelling by
the Underground during the rush
hours."
Lord BUCKMASTER boldly declared that
nationalisation would be a curse to the
very people who were clamouring for it.
He also furnished a new definition of
pessimists—“persons who would mort-
gage the future without knowing how
the debt was going to be redeemed.”
The special merit of this is that it ap-
plies with at least equal accuracy to
optimists.
Tuesday, July 22nd.—The Commons
sat up half the night to pass the Anglo-
French Treaty Bill, which binds us to
come to the assistance of our neighbour
if Germany attempts “revanche,” and
then went down to Southend to refresh
themselves with a view of the Fleet.
Accordingly there were big gaps in
the House this afternoon, and the
Treasury Bench was chiefly tenanted
by Under-Secretaries. Mr. CHURCHILL,
however, was present to state the in-
tentions of the Government regarding
the troops in North Russia. They are
all to depart by November, unless they
belong to the Military Missions, or the
ice sets in unusually early, or the Bol-
shevists cannot bear to part with them.
According to Sir A. GRIFFITH-Bos-
CAwÉN rabies is diminishing, but the
muzzling-order and the restrictions on
the movement of dogs cannot yet be
relaxed. Major NEwMAN's plaintive
inquiry, “How can a man go away if
his dog is at home 2" aroused the
MINISTER’s sympathy, but did not in-
duce him to alter his decision. The
country may or may not be going to
the dogs, but the dogs are not going
to the country.
A few weeks ago the Government
were badly beaten in the Commons
on a Women's Enfranchisement Bill.

[JULY 30, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
There has been much inquiry as to
how they would get over their defeat.
The answer came this afternoon in the
Sex Disqualification (Removal). Bill,
which, according to the LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR, is a more generous measure
than the other. He himself displayed
a rather tepid enthusiasm for it, and
Lord BRYCE thought the proposal to
allow peeresses to sit and vote inop-
portune, in view of the Government's
undertaking to reform the Second
Chamber next Session.
Wednesday, July 23rd.—Lord CUR-
zoN is too busy these days understudy-
ing Mr. BALFour at the Foreign Office
to put in much time in the House of
Lords. But he paid a special visit this
afternoon to correct Lord BRYCE's state-
ment. The Government had merely pro-
mised to reform the Second .
Chamber some time, but not º
“next Session.”
If Lord CURzoN imagined
that gratitude for the removal
of this impending menace
would cause noble lords to be
more tender with the Trans-
port Bill he was disappointed.
Lord MonTAGU declared that, ;
if the Bill passed, the traveller
who desired to escape Minis-
terial control must either
walk or swim. Lord DEvoN
Pont, who has been a Con-
troller himself, scoffed at the
notion of a Government ever
making economies and urged
the House “to put a knife
into the Bill,” and cut out
everything but the railways.
Lord MIDLEton said they
were setting up “a gigantic
trust” and putting it in the
hands of one man, who might
at any moment leave the Ministry, as
so many business-men had done already.
Lord BUCKMASTER considered that the
Bill made Nationalisation inevitable,
and could not understand why the Gov-
ernment should make two bites of their
cherry.
Members so frequently complain of
the curtness of Ministerial replies that
it was a pleasant change to find Mr.
HoHLER objecting that Dr. MACNAMARA
employed “so much verbiage.” Where-
upon “Dr. Mac,” ever ready to oblige,
snapped out, “The short summary of
this answer is “ No. ' " That did not
quite end the incident. Mr. HoHLER
had five Questions on the Paper—one in
excess of the present-day ration. The
SPEAKER did not call the fifth, and when
the hon. Member asked the reason, in-
stantly hoisted him with his own petard
—“Too much verbiage!” he said.
An unsuspected flaw in the Repre-
sentation of the People Act has been

discovered. So long as he is on service
a youngster of eighteen has a Parlia-
mentary vote, but with demobilisation
comes disfranchisement. Possibly the
idea is that judgment ripens quickly in
face of the enemy, but deteriorates
under the pernicious influence of home-
life; and there may be something in it.
Anyway one good anomaly deserves
another. So Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, anxious
to smooth the path of the Finance Bill,
decided that for purposes of fiscal relief
a “child "might be any age provided
that it was undergoing full-time educa-
tion. Even the elderly undergraduate of
the “Pa's ploughed again” type would
be included in the definition, provided
that he had a parent still living.
Thursday, July 24th.—The Lords'
debate on the Peace Treaty turned
“unusumulº
SAME You Look
chiefly on the proposed trial of the Ex-
KAISER. The critics of the proposal
were not quite at one. Lord BRYCE
thought a trial was superfluous, seeing
that the Allies—the judges-designate—
had already decided that there had
hardly been a greater crime committed
in history; Lord BUCKMASTER, after an
argument full of what Mr. Asquith
would call “juridical niceties,” ex-
pressed the opinion that there was
“nothing to try,” and that the trial, if
held, would quite possibly result in an
acquittal.
Inconsistency is catching. Lord
CURzoN, in defending the trial, said in
one breath that there was no danger
of turning the criminal into a hero—
WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN was not of
the stuff of which heroes could be made;
and in the next that he could not be
left quietly in Holland because it was
“as a hero” that the military party in
Germany still regarded him.
As a sop to the critics, however, he
observed that there was no absolute
necessity that the trial should be held
in London. Three weeks ago the
House of Commons rang with cheers
when the PRIME MINISTER announced
that the capital of the Empire was to
be the scene of this historic episode.
Now the Lords seemed equally glad to
hear that the venue might be changed.
Thus quickly in our delightful climate
does the cold fit succeed the hot.
I am afraid that Lord NorthcLIFFE
will not be pleased with Mr. BonAR
LAW, who, on being asked whether the
Government would adopt the scheme
for the future administration of Ireland
which fills four columns of the Times
to-day, was obliged to confess that he
had not yet read it. This is almost a
case of lèse-majesté.
Having failed to obtain an
answer to a question, on the
ground that it was “hypo-
thetical,” Lord HENRY BEN-
TINCK Sonorously announced
that he would ask “a ques-
tion which is not hypotheti-
cal: How long will the Gov-
ernment insist on this mis-
government of the people of
Ireland 2’’ And Mr. LAw was
as nonplussed as the witness

DIVINE DISQUIET.
(By our Medical Expert.)
THE value of excitement as a potent
stimulus to energy and national effici-
ency has been emphasized by Mr.
GALLICHAN in a courageous and forcible
article in The Daily Mail. Coming from
a paper so notoriously addicted to stead-
fastness and calm, and at a time when
the nation is suffering from an excess
of sanity, the appeal gains enormously
in impressiveness and urgency. As the
writer reminds us, “we are wont to
forget that over-repression is as harm-
ful as unrestrained indulgence. Many
persons require frequent excitement for
a spur to activity, as a tonic, and also
as a sedative. Neither men nor animals
can live healthily without excitement.”
in the bed of a delicate guest, or the
dexterous disposition of a platoon of
alarum clocks in her room, may work
wonders.
But perhaps the worst of all the ob-
stacles in the way of improvement is
the deadening tradition of the “well-
behaved child"—of the maxims that
“little children should be seen and not
heard,” and so on. Modern pedagogy
realises, on the contrary, that in the
nursery, as in the concert-room, the first
aim should be the establishment of the
dominion of din and the annihilation of
the monstrous doctrine which finds its
supreme expression in the odious cal-
umny of “Fidgety Phil.” It is one of
the greatest tragedies of the world that
this noble pioneer in the art of self-
realisation, and emancipated table-man-
HoRATIO, GARVIN and MAxs E,
Have grown quite unbearably tame:
No longer alternately burning -
And freezing with scoops and with scares,
Men read The D.M. without turning
The shortest of hairs.
But we who are sick of emotions
Too stale to inflame or convulse—
We crave for more poisonous potions
To heighten and fever our pulse;
We need something fresh to excite us,
Some new and implacable pest:
Come down, O belovèd Saint VITU's,
And rid us of rest.

IF it had been a Cockney sparrow
that had done this thing I could have

this admirable and most timely article,
it is in the absence of specific sugges-
tions to counteract our national lethargy
and sweep away the last vestiges of the
Puritan tradition which still hampers
our indulgence in an unrestrained joie
de vivre. For example, Mr. GALLICHAN
says nothing of the imperative need of
the revival of high-spirited practical
joking, one of the most helpful aids to
that unfortunate class of people who,
in his own words, are “insufficiently
stimulated by excitement.” The old
methods were, however, crude and in-
effective. Now that we have the benefi-
cent resources of applied science at our
command, the stimulus is capable of
limitless reinforcement. Still much can
be done with the simplest apparatus.
A can of boiling water, if carefully
poised on the top of a slightly opened
door, though not as potent as an ex-
plosive bomb, may still exert a most
salutary influence on a nervous subject.
Even the secreting of a number of mice
ners should have been held up to exe-
cration, instead of being made the sub-
ject of unqualified panegyric. Assuredly
the poets of the past have much to
answer for by their persistent dispar-
agement of vivacity, restlessness and
quick - silverishness, and their corre-
sponding exaltation of repose, stolidity
and calm. Thank Heaven, no one now
dares to extol Castles of Indolence or
“mild-eyed melancholy lotus-eaters" !
The educative effect of the Jazz, in ges-
ture and music, has been an incalculable
boon. Yet much remains to be done
before we can expect to reap the full
benefit of applied excitement. We wel-
come therefore as an incentive to re-
doubled effort the divine discontent of
an anonymous Georgian singer, who
has lent a fresh lustre to the outworn
metre of a forgotten Victorian in “The
Jim-Jammiad,” from which we quote
the two last stanzas:—
The apostles of mental ataxy
Who once lent a hand in the gaune,
about dancing. Forget it.”
I did. I lay on my back and I
watched ruminative cows. I also
watched the peaceful birds, and in so
doing made the acquaintance of Robert.
Robert is to me a small brown object
that wears a red waistcoat and a green
moustache of dangling caterpillars. I
am to Robert a kind of Y.R.C.A. (Young
Robins' Christian Association), which
supplies shelter and food in unlimited
quantities at infinitesimal cost.
Our mode of procedure is as follows:
Robert appears on the ledge of my
window, within a foot of my pillow, his
head on one side, his beak containing
two caterpillars, a big white grub and
a small brown moth. To this insigni-
ficant collection he purposes to add a
little bread or, if possible, cake.
I keep a small pyramid of pilules
made from these intoxicating sub-
stances by my bed. I stretch out my
hand, and Robert backs hastily to the
end of the window-sill. I place the

pilule on the ledge, and he returns,
tucks it with precision into an un-
occupied corner of his beak, and dis-
appears with a soft scurry over the
rhododendrons. As a bird Robert may
have his faults; as a husband I am
ºvinced he is doing more than his
| bit.
It was all very idyllic. I lay on my
back and gazed at a patch of blue sky
with a branch of yellow laburnum
across it, and fed that peaceful bird,
and thoughts of the great city with its
mad glad ballrooms drifted ever further
away.
And then this morning Robert spoiled
it all.
He appeared, as is his custom, as soon
as the nurse had planted the breakfast
tray firmly across my chest. Even to
my sleep-dimmed eyes there seemed
something distraught about him. His
beak was, for a wonder, empty. He
opened it and squeaked, then backed
as usual to the end of the sill.
Hastily I wriggled from beneath the
tray, grabbed at the toast-rack and
stretched my hand out of the window
with a tempting morsel in the centre
of its palm.
Robert considered it and me for an
instant in his one-sided fashion, lowered
his head meditatively and then—ap-
parently went mad. He advanced three
steps, he retreated four. He proceeded
to do a chassé sideways and wave
his right leg in the air, then did the
same with his left. He hopped forward
to within an inch of my hand and
hastily staggered back again. He ex-
tended his wings and jumped into the
air. He advanced with a wild dive,
retreated with a wilder, spun rapidly
thrice round, wavered back to his
original position and finally stopped,
regarding me with ruffled feathers and
an expression of the most utter imbe-
cility.
I sank back on my pillows, the toast
dropped from my palsied hand, and
that small brown destroyer of my
tranquillity hopped up sedately to eat
it. I regarded him with dully horrified
eyes.
He has spoiled my breakfast; he has
ruined my country peace. He has
brought the breath of town to my very
windows. The hideous truth can no
longer be concealed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GIVILISING OF GENTRAL AFRIGA.
HERE am I in M'Banga. Scots myself
I was attracted by the name, but my
mission (from Government) is not to
the wild tribes of Aberdeen but to the
heart of Mid-Africa.
On the termination of hostilities the
King, Umbongi, offered his services to
fight the Germans, Turks, Austrians,
Sinn Feiners, and their allies, and at
all hazards to get a share in any distri-
bution of President WILSON's Fourteen
Points. Such was the purport of his
letter in the Sebanga language. He
did not seem to grasp the international
situation, and in fact mixed up the Sinn
Feiners with the Abyssinians, who are
quite civilised. The Fourteen Points
he apparently regarded as edibles. A
postscript, to his letter stated with em-
phasis that he would take something on
account, and that he would like the
other Great Powers to appoint him man-
datory to all outlying cattle. I was sent
to talk things over with the King.
Regarding my mission as one for
promoting civilisation, I translated the
Laws of Golf into Sebanga, and brought
with me the best set of clubs seen on the
Equator, which forms part of a bunker
on our sixth fairway.
M'Banga has now given up cattle raids
and has taken to golf wholeheartedly,
the Bantulanguages lending themselves
remarkably to this game. As I am a
diplomat, the King has so far always
beaten me, except upon one unfortunate
occasion when my ball cannoned off a
lion into the short eighteenth hole for
one. However, I told the King that at
St. Andrews to strike a lion without
shouting “Fore!” gave one's opponent
the game, and everyone was content,
except the lion, who has not yet stopped
running.
Owing to local conditions we have
made some permissible alterations in
the Royal and Antient game. The King,
who is corpulent, hates dismounting
from his caddie too often, and has in-
vented a new rule by which, after driving
off, we race for the ball lying in the best
position. This innovation, borrowed
from polo, should be welcomed by
elderly mounted players. He invariably
wins, and his victory is celebrated by
deafening applause from the four-and-
twenty tom-toms that precede us.
Umbongi has great respect for St.
Andrews, and I have persuaded him that
among the things never done there is
the decapitating one's caddie when one
misses the ball. He now says “Tut, tut”
instead. Another concession to the
traditions of the headquarters of the
Royal and Antient game is the wearing
of clothes by all players. As I pointed
out to our head witch-doctor, no clergy-
man in St. Andrews would play a round
attired solely in an old top-hat. Though
not expressly forbidden by the rules, I
said it was one of the things which are
never done.
Civilisation is spreading rapidly in
M'Banga. There have been no wars
since I arrived with my Laws of Golf.
All the assegais have been turned into
cleeks, niblicks and corkscrews. The
whole male population now spends its
days on the golf links and the ladies
attend to any necessary work. It is like
being home in bonnie Scotland.
I am returning shortly with the
honorary degree of WW.D. from the
M'Banga University, and a letter from
King Umbongi agreeing to the Fourteen
Points, or as many more as we like,
provided he receives at once a Dictionary
of the Scottish language and an unlim-
ited supply of golf balls. He desires,
too, a ruling from St. Andrews Univer-
sity on the following points:—
(1) Are large snakes, of a peculiarly
venomous kind, to be considered hazards
of the green 2
(2) In a match game all square and
one to play and an infuriated bison on
the eighteenth putting green, what is
the etiquette 2
(3) What (short of death) is the maxi-
mum penalty allowed to be inflicted
upon a caddie with a sarcastic cough 2
TO AN IDEAL CANDIDATE.
(During a recent Election contest a
Candidate completely lost his voice.)
WHEN you, my Henry, lately wrote
That in your quest for high renown,
Just at the psychic hour, your throat
Had been and let you badly down,
It was not due to want of thought,
Which is a virtue that I prize,
When I withheld the sop you sought
And failed to sympathize.
In one with such a natural gift
For gassing till the crack of doom,
To find your lute reveal a rift
Must have occasioned utter gloom.
But in that hour of bitter need
Did there occur the thought to you
That silence does at times indeed
Assume a golden hue?
And see Th’ unequal contest's done;
No longer do I hear you grouse;
For you (I guessed you would) have won,
And potter now about the “House.”
So let me with you here rejoice
And thank Miss Fortune's comic
touch
Which left the other man his voice
And let him “say too much.”

MOTOR NOTES.
By “Hot AIR.”
(After the manner of these things.)
A FEW days ago I had the privilege
of inspecting a chassis representing
the latest production of the Moonshine
Motor Co. -
This attractive model, which is of 25-30
h.p. (developing umpteen h.p. on the
brake), while of orthodox construction,
following soundengineering lines, never-
theless presents several novel and dis-
tinctive features which will specially
appeal to the owner-driver, and F.;
not hesitate to predict that it will still
further enhance the already deservedly
high reputation of Moonshine Cars.
The framework of the car is carried
on four circular wheels, two of which
are placed in front and two behind,
equal distances separating the two pairs.
This is a device which will add con-
siderably to the rigidity and smooth
running of the vehicle, especially on
bad roads.
The cylinders, which are of the gramo-
phonic type, are cast in groups and are
furnished with a roughened surface,
which renders them very convenient
for striking matches on.
The valves are of the semi-upersutic
type, operated by longitudinal ferro-
concrete cams, working eccentrically
with phosphor-bronze bosses, which
are actuated by semi-elliptical canti-
levers from the differential. The usual
difficulty encountered in similar designs,
of the inaccessibility of the plunger-
gudgeons, is overcome in a very in-
genious manner by placing these on the
dashboard with an adjustable adapter
of case - hardened peroxide—a device
which will not fail to recommend itself
to the owner-driver.
The lubricating system follows ortho-
dox lines and is of the centrifugal type
operated by means of a soda-syphon
pump, the handle of which is conven-
iently situated between the carburetter
and the armature of the magneto.
The springs are of the quasi-apo-
plectic type and are calculated to absorb
the shock of any ordinary breakdown.
The gear-box is a model of simplicity,
and will on that account recommend
itself to (No, I really mustn't say
that again). The gears being situated
by an ingenious device outside the box
the latter can be used for storing spare
parts, small articles of luggage, etc.,
and will be found very useful for
touring.
The car is to be placed on the market
at the extremely moderate figure of
three thousand pounds, and the Moon-
shine Co. anticipate being able to com-
mence delivery of this model in the
early Autumn of 1925.

METEMPsychosis alone will account for the phenomenon
of Samuell Pepys, Junior, who has crowned his admirable
work with a third and Last Diary of the Great War (LANE).
It is rounded off by a happy dedication to Field-Marshal
HAIG and some diverting designs by John KETTELweLL.
General Pirpleton and Admiral Topper still crab our every
stroke of strategy and tactics, Brigadier Brigstock dispenses
his robust optimism, Mistress Pepys still buys hats, each
less comely and more costly than the last, while her lord,
that notable cynic, reactionary, gossip and egoist, is busy
with the latest idle or credible war rumour, the choicest
morsel of scandal, the tastiest recipe for food, the cut of his
clothes, his accounts, his ailments and his putts—and, more
solidly, with the record of the hopes and fears of the won-
derful but terrible years 1917 (from July) and 1918. I
would certainly récommend intending historians to lay in
these three volumes as an epitome in a brilliant shorthand
of the facts and moods of the War—packed with shrewd
comments and happy strokes of irony. For us others the
book will serve as a most enjoyable way of recalling in a
luxury of relief the anguish and suspense of these past great
days. As a literary and dramatic tour-de-force I should judge
it to be unsurpassed of its kind. As I have hinted there is
here rather a matter of reincarnation than of parody.
Old Jeremy Ammidon thought that things on the seas
were going to the devil. And if you suppose that this
reflection was provoked by anything so new-fangled as the
German U-boat campaign you are very much mistaken. It
was the monstrous apparition of clipper-built boats in the
port of Salem nearly two hundred years ago that troubled
this retired master-mariner, the most carefully-drawn of the
figures whom Mr. Joseph HERGESHEIMER has grouped in
Java Head (HEINEMANN). I say “carefully-drawn” because
this is the most lasting impression I take away from Mr.
HERGESHEIMER's book; and not because he cannot tell a
story that thrills. There is indeed a moment when he
brings together into one room the high-born Chinese wife
whom Gessit Ammidon, old Jeremy's son, has brought home;
Nellie Wollar, the girl whom Gessit had loved before, and
Edward Dunsack, an opium-sodden clerk; and though I
was certain that one of the three would commit murder or
suicide before the end of the chapter, for several breathless
pages I could not guess who or which it would be. Never-
theless it is the author's pictures of interiors, of gardens, of
a ship's rig, of a Manchu lady's toilet that stay most clearly
in my mind; if they do not interfere with the plot they
stand out more luminously than the characters. In any
case Java Head is an exquisite piece of work and one that
will transport you from the prose of life into the regions
of genuine romance.
In Birds and the War (SREFFINGTON) Mr. H. S. GLAD-
STONE has collected some very interesting evidence to show
that in adaptability to their surroundings birds are not to
be beaten even by the British soldier. In the war-zone
they persisted in singing, making love and building nests
under the most appallingly discouraging conditions. The
idea is that they preferred the din of battle to the treacher-

to give up the idea of mur-
ous quiet of peace in which they were liable to be molested
by people who had leisure for that kind of distraction.
Their gaiety and insouciance were often a source of com-
fortable solace to harassed and tired soldiers; though Mr.
GLADSTONE cites one occasion when, after terrific fighting,
productive of heavy casualties, the bombardment had just
ceased when a lark soared imperturbably into the sky and
poured out its soul in a song so care-free that it called forth
a very unusual protest from a prostrate Tommy. “What
the 'ell is 'e singing about 2" he asked. The book does not
pretend to be anything more than a collection of extracts
from various sources, but they are excellently set out.

AND StoughTon) is that all the characters in it talk like

women—for every type the writer has a sympathetic eye,
with, as I suggest, a suspicion of preference for those whose
histories might be supposed to outrage convention. One
fancies her still pleasantly thrilled by her own freedom from
prejudice in this respect. Many of the sketches are admir-
ably drawn (among the best an excellent study in “Jacquot
and Pierre" of the practical French worker, and a very
daintily told romance of a girl in a cheap drug store); but
inevitably the collection as a whole suffers from some mon-
otony of effect. Fortunately the remedy, skipping-exercise,
is within the reach of all, and should add greatly to the
reader's enjoyment.

not the heroine, of Bart (HUT-

amuses. Having said that and
added that the plot, or rather
the action, of Miss DoRo TA
FLATAU's latest novel is well
sustained, one has said about
all in its favour that justice
demands. The hero is a bit
of a fool; the gilded Society
youths and maidens a trifle
overgilded; the villain almost
unnecessarily vile, and the
hero's mother, though ever so
darling, just a wee bit top
pawky. But what matter
since the book is obviously
written to entertain, which it
does, and not to hold the mir-
ror up to fast Society, which
it doesn't. If there is an es-
pecially false note it is in mak-

tragedy) to write more stuff of the same kind.
“In talking to her I always feel that hers is a point of
view—not, as one so often feels in talking, especially to
women, that what they think is simply nonsense, and not a
point of view at all!” I daresay the italicized parenthesis
has already given you a sufficient clue to the author of this
quotation from Sister Woman (GRANT RICHARDs), since
there can hardly exist the male writer capable of quite such
devastating candour. It may convey also a fair idea of the
peculiar detachment that Miss or Mrs. J. G. SIME brings
to these little studies of her kind. There are thirty of them
in all, none more than a few pages long, each the result of
the writer's shrewd, tolerant and perhaps rather insistently
broad-minded outlook upon feminine life as it is lived, appar-
that time everything has turned out right for the really

“SoME '' DUCR.
SIR,--I have a black-and-tan Bombay
runner duck. Like all of its kind it is
of a most affectionate disposition and
catholic taste in diet. About four weeks
ago it laid a perfectly solid and round
egg, with which I subsequently played
several rounds on the North Foreland
links. I found it excellent for putting
and short iron shots, but rather severe
on my wooden clubs. You can imagine
my feelings when the authorities of the
Natural History Museum at South Ken-
sington, to whom I offered it, declined
my gift as an “unverifiable specimen " '
I should be prepared to exchange it
for a side-car or a small landscape by
SARGENT. ANDREW MERRILEES.

A “GRAND '''CANARY.
SIR, My Canary, “Patti,” which has
been in the family since 1861, the year
of the London début of the famous
prima donna, was recently allowed out
| of its cage on my lawn, and in the space
of about three hours ate the whole of a
croquet-ball. No untoward results have
so far been noticeable, except perhaps
a slight lack of brilliancy in the bird's
highest register. The really extraordin-
ary thing is that it shows no appreciable
increase in bulk. Gr, ADYS Wolf F.
Gullane, N.B.
SUSPENDED ANIMATION IN A
SEA-SERPENT.
SIR,--The shortage of the gooseberry
crop has been very marked this year,
and has been seriously felt by those
reptiles which habitually depend for
their sustenance on this nutritious fruit.
I was fortunate enough early in the
season to obtain a large consignment
from Greenland for the benefit of the
| inhabitants of my aquarium, and in
particular for a fine dwarf sea-serpent
which I purchased a few years ago from
a Norwegian trawler. Unfortunately,
after long abstinence from its favourite
diet, the creature attacked its first meal
with such avidity that it was choked by
a large and very hairy gooseberry, and
in spite of all our efforts with the
kitchen tongs never regained conscious-
ness, but lapsed into a state of deep
coma, in which it still remains. Repeated
telegrams to Sir E. RAY LANKEstER for
advice have remained so far without an
answer, but we are expecting Sir LEo
ChiozzA Monry to-morrow to interview
and stimulate the patient, and have not
given up hope.

SAD CASE of A SQUIRREL.
SiR,-The tragedies of animal life
are too often overlooked even in this
humanitarian age. A squirrel which I
had succeeded in half-taming was dis-
covered a fortnight ago in a fainting
condition on the terrace, having dislo-
cated its jaw in the attempt to crack an
ostrich egg which stood as an ornament
on the dining-room mantelpiece. The
jaw was put in its place by our chauffeur,
but mumps supervened and the poor
squirrel is now undergoing a rest cure
in the Scilly Islands. When oppor-
tunity arises I hope to test his eapacity
in regard to crab, lobster and hedgehogs
au naturel. THEoDoRE LIookHAM.

FELINE AMENITIES.
SIR,-None of your correspondents
have so far noted the omnivorous habits
of Manx cats. My cat “Bradda,"
though not despising milk, fish and fowl,
supplements them with tin-tacks, sand-
paper, Swedish matches and linoleum.
I tested her the other day with the works
of Mr. CHARLEs GARVICE, bound in limp
lamb-skin; but she drew the line. Now
was it patriotism or criticism which in-
spired this grand refusal?

Felt I couldn't do without it
(Though I don't know much about
it),
And the man who sold it me
Said, “It’s cheap at forty-three.
She is not exactly new,
But that need not worry you.
There's a rest for both the feet,
Kick-start, foot-clutch all couplete,
Spares and tools and lamps and

She will run for years and years.
They are in this bag, you see

Forty-three's the merest song:
There is simply nothing wrong.'

Well, to cut the story short, he
Let me have the thing for forty.
TUESDAY.
Woe is me! She will not stir;
Something must be wrong with her.
I have pushed and pulled and curst,
Done my best and said my worst;
Nothing happened. Then I found
That the wheels were far from round;
Both the mud-guards by mistake
Acted for the (absent) brake,
And whene'er I touched a spoke
It incontinently broke.
Now the boot-boy's working at her;
He may find out what's the matter.
WEDNESDAY. --
In the bag that arrant scamp
Said that I should find the lamp;

There's a broken spanner in it
And a dirty bit of rag.

It is down-hill all the way).

On the thing they call a ‘clutch,'

“It would go a trifle better

And I cannot don my vest,
For my body's black and blue
And my head is thumping too;
On my chest 's a leaden weight
And my back-bone's far from .

Both my knees are very sore,
While a brace of ribs or more
Are entangled with my liver—
And the bike is in the river!

EULOGY IN EXCELSIS.
As a result of the epidemic of mutual
congratulation which has recently been
raging, the opening meeting of the
newly-formed Royal Eulogical Society
was held on Thursday last at the
Gigantic Hotel, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
being in the Chair. Among other mem-
bers present were Mr. BoNAR LAw, the
Duke of North UMBERLAND, Mr. PEM-
BERTON BILLING, Mr. PAL MooRE, Mr.
Owen NAREs, Lord NorthcLIFFE, the
Editor of John Bull, Mr. JAMES WILDE,
several members of the Centre Party,
Mr. Robert SMILLIE, Lord FRENCH,
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, Mr. Hi-NRY
AINLEY, Sir ALFRED MOND, Lord BIR-
KENHEAD, and the GEDDEs family.
The proceedings were remarkable for
a unique display of spontaneous adu-
lation, the intensity of which may be
judged from a few extracts chosen at
random from the verbatim report, a
copy of which is forwarded to each
member gratis. It may be mentioned
that one of the rules of the Society
clearly states that no speech may
exceed five minutes in duration; which
accounts for the absence of Mr. J. L.
GARVIN, who felt unable to limit him-
self to such truncated eloquence.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE: I have told you
what I think of my friend, Mr. Bon AR
LAw; but how can I hope adequately
to express my feelings towards my
other friend, Mr. WINston CHURCHILL 2
The task is too stupendous even for me.
Mr. BoNAR LAw: I have known Mr.
WINstoN CHURCHILL both as an ally
and as an opponent, but in either rôle
his head was always well above water.
He is a man you cannot down—drown /
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL : Words fail
me when I attempt to express my ad-
miration for my friends and colleagues,
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE and Mr. BonAR
LAw. However, I shall endeavour to
do justice to their great qualities in
their biographies, which I am hoping to
write in due course.
Mr. JAMES WILDE in a few well-chosen
words expressed the opinion that his
friend Mr. PAI, MooRE was the hardest-
headed man he had ever met.
Mr. PAL MooRE guessed that his
friend Mr. JAMES WILDE was caught
bending very seldom indeed.
The Duke of North UMBERLAND : Re-
cently, in another place, I had the
privilege of studying my friend Mr.
RoBERT SMILLIE at close, almost stuffy,
quarters. I found him one of the most
charming men imaginable, endowed,
moreover, with an unusual sense of
delicacy and an unquenchable thirst
for information.
Mr. Robert SMILLIE : The Duke of
North UMBERLAND is a man after my
own heart. His intimate acquaintance
with royalties is no doubt responsible
for much of his affability and sunny dis-
position. He is an oasis in an otherwise
arid waste of dukes.
Mr. Owen NAREs: My friend and
fellow-worker in the sacred cause of
Dramatic Art, Mr. HENRY AINLEY, is an
accomplished actor whose métier leans
towards the pseudo-serious psychic. As
soon as he finds a part to fit him he will
fit it like a glove, and, I am sure, speedily
recoup himself for all the sacrifices he
made in answer to the call of King and
Country. (Slow music, please—thank
you!) I often think of him as I face
my enthusiastic matinée audiences at
2:30 on Thursdays and Saturdays, and
note the queues every evening at 8:15.
Mr. HENRY AINLEY: While serving my
country on the Virginia Water Front I
had ample leisure for reflection, thanks
to the exigencies of my military duties,
and I often wondered what the Lon-
don stage would be like deprived of
the refining influence of my friend and
fellow - artiste, Mr. Owen NAREs. I

was inclined to think it would resemble
the ball without Cinderella. At the
same time I am convinced that Mr.
Owen NAREs would have made an ideal
O.C. of a Divisional Concert Party or
manager of a Y.M.C.A. Hut.
POLITICS IN THE HOME.
Long experience of the delightful
methods of economy adopted by Gov-
ernment Departments in their dealings
with their employees enabled me to
cope satisfactorily with the exorbitant
demand for higher wages submitted to
me, through my wife, by Eliza, our
cook-general.
All I did was to retire to the sea-
side for the week-end and there call a
Cabinet meeting. My wife attended
as Home Secretary, and I presided as
Prime Minister and First Lord of the
Treasury.
As a result of our deliberations the fol-
lowing letter was drafted: “Whereas
it has been represented to Mr. Brown,
by Mrs. Brown, that Miss Eliza Smith
has hitherto been in receipt of emolu-
ments wholly incommensurate with the
volume of responsibility devolving upon
her, and whereas Mr. Brown, after
thorough and detailed investigation,
desires to show himself in complete
accord with this view, he is pleased to
authorise Mrs. Brown to cease pay-
ments to Miss Smith in accordance
with the scale of pay at present in force
(viz., four pounds per mensem) on and
after the 15th inst., and to substitute
in lieu thereof, but not in addition
thereto, payments in accordance with
the new scale, which shall be four
pounds seven shillings and threepence
per mensem, as from the 15th proximo."
This done the Cabinet was reorganised
and a meeting called. I rose as Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer to protest
against the additional drain on the
revenue which this scheme would seem
to involve; the Home Secretary pointed
out that the deſt use of the words inst.
and proximo in its text made of the
draft a miracle of statesmanship, pro-
viding, as it did, for the necessary
increase to Miss E. Smith without
causing the Exchequer to disgorge so
much as a red cent more than hitherto.
The letter was accordingly despatched
with the approval of all Government
Departments.
To-day Miss Smith's criticisms are
at hand. She demands at least double
the increase. The Cabinet are on good
terms with one another; the only alter-
ations required in the original draft
will be:—For “inst.” read “ult.” For
“seven shillings and threepence” read
“sixteen shillings.” The arrangement
will call for revision after one year, of
course—but sufficient unto the day—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HOLIDAY BUREAU.
THE notice caught my eye as I was
taking a short cut through an un-
familiar street : “Holiday Bureau,” it
ran, and then underneath in small
letters: “Clients' individual needs sup-
plied.”
My most pressing problem just then
was where to go for a quiet inexpensive
holiday. I went in.
It was very like a railway inquiry
office, but besides the usual pigeon-
holes there were shelves of bottles, as
in a chemist's shop. A pretty girl was
talking eagerly to the official-in-charge.
“And the catering must all be done
for me,” she was insisting. “I want
to be able to get something to eat just
when I fancy it, no regular meals, they
are so upsetting to one's plans. Then
“We have exactly what you require,
Sir,” he said; “our Rabbit Fortnight.
You simply take a ticket to any locality
you fancy—ah, excuse me a moment,”
as a large golden-haired lady rustled in.
“Oh, my dear good Sir,” she cried,
“so clever of you! I've had the time
of my life. I can never be grateful
enough—a real rest cure. Just lying
in the sun all day long and living on
cream, exactly what I've always longed
to do. I had a fright though when the
Fulkes called. I hadn't realised it was
so near their place; but they never
noticed me—so queer and refreshing,
you know, not to be noticed. Too sweet
of you to arrange it all so beautifully.
My friends say they mever saw me look-
ing so well and want to know where
I've been l I had to come and thank
you. Good-bye,” and she sailed out.
Ten shillings a week for adults and five
shillings for children is our charge for
a farmhouse holiday. A month would
quite set you up,” he added.
“It would indeed,” she cried ; “but
please explain. I do not understand
how it can he done at the price.”
“Take the children down to any plea-
sant farmhouse you fancy,” he said,
busily measuring a clear amber liquid
into a medicine bottle; “find a quiet
field or wood close by and give them
each a tablespoonful of this, taking
three yourself; rest a few moments and
then walk into the farmyard. Great
pleasure will be shown on your arrival
and a private house and food provided.
The probable comment will be, “A late
clutch ' ' but the hospitality will be
none the less hearty for that.”
“It will be just the thing for the chil-
I want plenty of sea-bathing
and games, and a jolly set of
people who will like the things
that I like; and it must be
cheap. Can you really man-
age all that ?” Her voice
was wistful.
“Certainly, Madam, we can
supply the very holiday you
require, on the Cornish or
Devon coast.”
“Cornwall ! How lovely 1
But I thought it was awfully
difficult to get rooms down
there, and isn't food a prob-
lem in those out-of-the-way
places?”
“I assure you that you will
have no difficulty either about
food or accommodation; and
there is congenial society and
plenty of sport, good fishing,
swimming, bathing, flying.”

dren,” she said, and left the
office with a light step.
By this time I was so much
interested in the other clients
that I sat back in a corner
watching them.
A sapper decided on an
Eagle Week in Scotland, and
an airman who wanted a com.
plete change thought that a
Mole Week-end would suit
him down to the ground.
Then a very stout gentle-
man entered, with boots made
of leather and coat-cloth made
of wool, and a handsome gold
chain and diamond studs.
“I want a really comfort-
able holiday,” he said, “with
a few like-minded friends.
good food and a little gentle
exercise.”
“Flying? Oh!”
“Yes, Madam, I think that our Sea-
gull Month will exactly meet your re-
quirements. Half-a-guinea a week, plus
railway fare, is our charge. The travel
difficulty is simplified by taking no
luggage; you will need none. You
simply take this phial, monthly size;
on arrival drink it; the change lasts for
one calendar month; introductions go
with the outfit.”
“And my return ticket?”
“In your as-you-were suit, Madam;”
and he bowed her out. -
“Yes, Sir, and what can I do ſor
you?” - -
“I want a quiet holiday,” I said,
“lively and congenial society, but not
noisy. I don't want to be obliged to
get up in the morning or to keep an
sort of appointment. I'd like to lie in
bed all day if I feel inclined, and per-
haps stay up all night.” It was aston-
ishingly easy to reveal my most secret
longings to this sympathetic listener.
“This lady ?” I began.
“A rather special arrangement,” he
answered. “We cannot always find
vacancies. A guest in a pleasant house
—as a Persian cat. And now, Sir 2"
“Oh, please attend to this lady first,”
I answered hastily, as a thin shabbily-
dressed figure entered, half-shyly as it
seemed.
“Is it possible to arrange a cheap
holiday 2” she asked timidly.
She was obviously a lady and a very
tired one.
“A cheap holiday for six children,”
she added, gaining courage. “I want
to take them all into the country, but
the present prices make it impossible.”
The attendant looked sympathetic.
“How would a month at a farm-house
suit you, Madam 2 " he asked.
“The very thing,” she said eagerly;
“but it would cost so much.”
“Not very much,” he answered;
“children are half-price, because the
change takes effect on them so easily.
“Yes, Sir, we have the very
thing. We have made special arrange-
ments with a farmer in the Shires, a
trustworthy man; he has a well-stocked
place and caters specially for gentle-
men like you. You will be well housed,
well fed and thoroughly appreciated.”
They talked a while in low tones,
making arrangements; but the fat gen-
tleman seemed displeased with some-
thing.
“No, not very happy momenclature,”
admitted the official humbly, “but these
farmers are a homely race, and one must
use terms which they understand.”
“Still — Fat Stock!” objected the
client.
“Quite so, my dear Sir; but what's
in a name? We know the valuable
services you will render to the country
after this well-deserved holiday. And
I do assure you that you will be thor-
oughly comfortable.”
“And now, Sir,” he said, turning to
me in my corner as the portly gentle-
man left the office.

“I’ll take the Rabbit Fortnight,

“There is risk in all holidays, Sir,”
he replied with dignity—“mountain-
eering, motoring—what you will; but
in your case, provided that you avoid
the vicinity of a harvest field when the
corn is being cut, I should say that the
risk was very slight.”
So I settled with him for the Rabbit

I heard them everywhere.
My heart was beating loud and fast;
I neither moved nor spoke;
And so they went away at last,
The tiny fairy folk.
To-morrow I shall go again
And seek the magic place,
I shall not be so foolish them,
I shall not hide my face.
But I shall stay for hours and hours

And we shall dance among the flowers
And be the greatest friends.
And I shall learn their fairy song,

And sing it every day. R. F.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT CONSOLER.
WHAT is Mr. Johnson doing? Every-
one wants to know that. I happen by
great good luck to have found out. He
is not holding soft-pedalled conferences
with prominent business men; he is
not trying to introduce the teetotalisator
at fashionable race-meetings. No ; he
is subtler even than that. He has per-
suaded the Government to appoint a
secret Interdepartmental Committee,
and you can guess how secret that
must be. It is composed of representa-
tives of the Board of Trade and the
Board of Education, and its object is to
revise the standard classical works of
the English poets in such a way as to
alter or dilute or eliminate the more
Bacchanalian bits of them. A few stray
minute sheets, floating down from a
window in Whitehall, gave me the clue.
I picked them up and read as follows:
“SoNG OF THE BRITISH WoRKING MAN.
(ACX 15397|R 509.)
“Betwixt the A.S.E. and suchlike things
I sat a toping; for what hammer swings
When all the wide world to the dogs is
gone?
So I kept on
Filling my pewterpint-pot up with beers
Bad as my fears.”
Betwixt the A.S.E. and suchlike things
I sat a-toping; for small comfort brings
Peace and her rainbow message from
the sky
With rent so high
Betwixt the A.S.E. and suchlike things.
“And as I sat, over the light-blue sea
There came a noise of purring ; cups of
tea
Wore forced into the hands of barmaids
proud;
'Twas Pussyfoot and crowdſ
The nasal accent twanged, nor over-
loud,
But soft as gentle strains from Ohio:
'Twas Pussyfoot and Co.'
They gained the shore, they climbed a
tramcar's top,
Like to a parish outing up they pop,
Invoking shame with lifted hand and
brolly -
On all things alcoholly!
Ah then, ah then I let my tankard
drop,
And I despised my ignorance and folly,
As boys despise, when cricketing in
June,
The roasted chestnuts of a winter-
In OOn ,
I rushed into the trolley.
* The Board of Trade representatives wished
apparently to read, instead of this line, “Of a
lower specific alcoholic gravity than 2%,” but
were over-ruled by the Board of Education, on
the ground that these words did not fit the
metre so well.
“Packed to the further end the triumph
car
Had kings of commerce, members of
the Bar
And various dons on ;
The azure streamlets floated from them
far ;
Their hats, their coats were ebon as
the night,
Their gloves of pearly-white,
And high above them all in pensive
mood,
Trifling an ivory tooth-pick as he stood,
The young Ionson.*
“‘Whence come ye, merry sports, and

So many and so many and such drought?
Why have ye left behind your beans and

“We follow Johnson 1 Johnson on the
ramp
Has moved his camp !
Johnson, YoUNG Johnson' whatso'er
may ha
On Prohibition we have all gone nap;
Come hither, working man, and
moulded be
To more efficiency.’”
The next sheet was so soiled with
mud that I couldn't read it, but I've
just managed to decipher the line:—
“Mounted on tabby-furs and tortoise-
shells,”
in one place, and a little lower further on
“I saw repentant Pittsburg kneel
a-down,”
and the last paper bore the following
beautiful conclusion, from which it ap-
pears that the working man was so
carried away by enthusiasm that he
lapsed completely into the missionaries'
tongue:—
“Say, stranger,
I have been a ranger,
A truant and a traitor to my vow;
I see that tippling
Queers a stripling,
And I mean to cut it out right now.’”
* Poetic licence. Dvor.

from a mutual friend.

THE SPREAD OF NEWSPAPER
GOVERNMENT.
TAKING their cue from The Times and
Ireland, other newspapers' plans for
hastening the Millennium come thick
as leaves in Wallombrosa. We can
only very briefly mention the most
important.
Perhaps the most momentous is that
of the President of the North Boreland
Golf Club, to which The Daily Mail
has given its generous support, for the
nationalising of golf courses, on the
basis of (1) the abolition of the stymie,
as that vexatious regulation has been
shown to promote ill-will between the
classes; (2) a minimum wage of ten
shillings a day for caddies, and a daily
allowance of half-a-pint of sloe-gin;
(3) the inclusion of the President of the
North Boreland Golf Club as an er-
officio member of the Cabinet, without
portfolio or responsibilities, during his
lifetime.
Secondly we have to note the very
interesting suggestion of The Daily
Herald for the painless extermination
of all Dukes by giving them free seats
in a Second Chamber of the Lethal pat-
tern, with Mr. RoberT WILLIAMs as
chief anaesthetist.
The Spectator issues a draft scheme
for the partition of the Isle of Man;
Greeba Castle, the Great Wheel of
Laxey and other specially selected areas
to be formed into a special autonomous
province with Sir HALL CAINE as
Hereditary Ban. Proportional Repre-
sentation is part of the scheme, and nine
votes will be allotted to all genuine
Manx cats, on the principle of one life
one vote.
Finally, The Daily Chronicle has put
forth a stirring appeal for the Stand-
ardisation of the Eisteddfodic huyl,
signed by our two leading HAROLDs,
BEGBIE and SPENDER. These eminent
writers point out that the Cambrian
brand of uplift is marked by a pecul-
iarly rich and juicy quality, and they
indicate with great skill how this rich-
ness and juiciness can be transplanted
and acclimatized in English soil, so as
to take on in the process a specially
superfatted unction. The course of
spiritual gymnastics prescribed is,
however, long and arduous; but the
signatories declare that they have
doubled their dynamic fervour by the
discipline which it entails.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 28th.-A proposal to
set up four consultative councils, pre-
sumably with appropriate emoluments,
to assist the new MINISTER OF HEALTH,
did not meet with the approval of Lord
DownHAM. In his opinion the tendency
of our new rulers to surround them-
selves with buffer-states strikes at the
root of Ministerial responsibility. But
the Peers were more impressed by Lord
SANDHURST's artful plea that “every-
thing should not be done from White-
hall,” and swallowed the councils by a
small majority.
If all the heat engendered
over the Cippenham motor-
depôt could have been stored
up for future use we could
regard the coal-strike with com-
placency. Even Lord MILNER
was stirred out of his usual
impassivity by Lord DES-
BOROUGH's criticism, and de-
clared that his opponent had
embroidered the Commission-
ers' report “with comment
and innuendo and invective.”
He declared that the only
“scandal" in connection with
the scheme was the manner
in which it had been attacked,
and boldly predicted that far
from being a failure it would,
at present rates, have paid for
itself in two years' time.
The policy of the “locked
box " continues to find favour
with Ministers. It is true that
Mr. Bon AR LAw expressed a
hope that he would be able to
reveal the contents of the fiscal
casket before the Recess. But
at the same time he intimated
that the receptacle containing
was hermetically sealed and
a debate upon the subject if the House
was to rise in reasonable time. Some
Members, to whom The Times' plan for
satisfying Ireland's demand for a Par-
liament of her very own by endowing
her with three makes special appeal,
were disappointed; but the majority,
I fear, were relieved to hear that their
holidays would not be delayed.
Except as a vehicle for humour Ire-
land does not appeal much to the pres-
ent House of Commons. The Minister
of Labour having decided that the out-
of-work donation cannot be extended
to recruiting-clerks in that country—
presumably on the ground that they
belong to the class of permanently un-
employed—an hon. Member asked if he
was aware that several respectable men
were in great distress. “It may be,”
replied Sir Robert HoRNE, “that there
are several respectable people in Ire-
land ” but the rest of the sentence
was submerged in laughter.
Mr. BALDw1N, replying to a sugges-
tion that the Government should take
steps to “deflate the currency,” observed
that, thanks to the success of the
recent Loan, the process had already
begun. It seems odd that the first step
in deflation should be “raising the
wind.”
The connection between the dog-tax
and the salaries of Petty Sessions' clerks
appears at first sight to be as remote
- - The Hen (to the Marquis of Salisbury). “SURE As Eggs Is Eggs

as that between Tenterden steeple and
Goodwin Sands. In Ireland however
they are closely linked, the fees on the
dogs going to provide the honoraria of
the clerks. Desiring to improve the
condition of this deserving class, Mr.
DENIs HENRY brought in a Bill to
raise the dog-tax from the modest florin
at which it stands at present to three
times that amount. Even then, as he
pointed out, the Irish dog-owner would
be eighteen-pence better off than the
British. But the SPEAKER promptly
clapped a muzzle on him, pointing out
that if a Bill imposed a charge upon
the public it must be originated in
Committee.
Apart from this slight mishap the
Government had a wonderful run of
luck, and before eight o'clock had got
through half-a-dozen Bills, one of which,
for the irrigation of the Sudan, would
in the old days have furnished matter
for a couple of nights' debate, while
another, the 'Expiring Laws Contin-
uance Bill, has before now been made
the excuse for a pitched battle.
Tuesday, July 29th.-Lord SALIS-
BURY has hitherto effectually disguised
his affection for the Ways and Commu-
nications Bill. He must in reality be
very fond of it, for he sought this after-
noon to make two of it. But the parent
of the child, as in the leading case before
SoLOMON, thought that bisection would
be fatal to the infant's con-
tinued existence, and success-
fully resisted the proposal.
For weeks past the Com-
mons have been trying to ex-
tract from a dilatory Govern-
ment the names of the new
Ambassador to Washington
and of the new Consul-General
at New York. All sorts of
rumours as to the reasons for
the delay have been current,
the most popular, of course,
being that, like Neptune in the
song, none of the possible can-
didates was willing to live upon
dry land. And there may be
something in it, for when the
name of the Consul-General
was announced this afternoon
it was found that the Govern-
ment had had to go all the
way to Abyssinia to find him.
Even under present conditions
New York is probably a shade
less arid than Addis Abeba.
The War Office is maintain-
ing to the very last its gener-
ous attitude towards the Vol-
unteers. Those pampered pop-
injays are, it seems, to have
the privilege of purchasing the
ammunition boots with which
they were provided by a grate-
ful country after wearing out their own.
Not under cost price, of course—that
would never do; nor even at cost
price—you evidently don't know our
War Office when it is on the economical
lay; no, Sir, at the price (some eight
or ten shillings more) which the War
Office would have to pay if it were buy-
ing the same article to-day ! I hope
the genius responsible for this splendid
stroke of business will get the appro-
priate Order.
Fearing that the Government might
have overlooked the threat of the Triple
Alliance to bring about a general strike
if their demands on certain political
questions were not conceded, Sir FRED-
ERICK HALL kindly drew their atten-
tion to it and asked how many men
were affected. Mr. WARDLE was much

obliged. There were only 1,600,000
men in the Triple Alliance; but, yes,
the Government had noticed it, thank
Ou.
Talk of Pooh-Bah / There is a gen-
tleman in Lincolnshire who already
holds the posts of Relieving Officer,
Vaccination Officer, Local Executive
Officer (Ministry of Food) and Deputy
Coal Controller, and has now been of-
fered (and has accepted) an appointment
as Cereals Inspector. It is believed that
the last word has been spelt wrongly,
and that he is to be “continued in our
next.” -
Some adverse comment was passed
upon Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's absence from
Question-time, but he made up for it by
sitting through a large portion of the
debate on the situation in Russia, and
throughly enjoyed the manner in which
his last speech on the subject was
bandied about between the two Front
Benches. Large chunks of it, proving
conclusively that we had no business tº
interfere with Russian internal affairs,
were hurled by Sir DoNALD MACLEAN
and Mr. CI.YNEs at the devoted head of
Mr. CHURCHILL. The WAR SECRETARY,
drawing upon the same arsenal, found
ammunition equally effective to show
that we must not leave our Russian
friends in the lurch. The Government
policy is evacuation eventually, but in
the meantime our Commanders on the
spot are to have every latitude in con-
ducting their operations.
Wednesday, July 30th.-Mr. LoNG
reported that nineteen vessels of the
ex-German fleet had been salved from
Scapa Flow, but did not display much
desire to increase the number, and
promptly turned down Lieut.-Com-
mander KENworthy's suggestion that
German salvage-companies (which he
characteristically implied were much
better than ours) should be employed
in the work: The Government and the
House generally were more sympatheti-
cally disposed to Mr. RENwick's request
that the resources of our shipyards
should not be wasted on repairing
these derelicts.
Many complaints of the continual
delay in the issue of passports were
addressed to the Foreign Office, and Sir
HAMAR GREENwood promised to attend
to then). But he turned a deaf ear to
Colonel WEdgwood's suggestion that
the examination of passports on the re-
turn journey should be confined to aliens.
There are some British travellers, I
gather, whose return to their native
country it is not desired to facilitate.
The silence of the PoET LAUREATE
during the Peace-celebrations has vexed
the literary soul of Mr. BottomLEY and
induced him to make a suggestion.
Why not revive the ancient practice of
paying a portion of his salary in Canary,
on the off-chance that it might inspire
him to sing like one? Mr. BonAR LAw
doubted whether, with wine at its
present price, the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER would approve the proposed
transaction; besides, he might feel a
certain delicacy in giving so rare a
minstrel the sack.
In moving the Third Reading of the
War Loan Bill the CHANCELLOR of the
ExcHEQUER had the satisfaction of an-
nouncing that since his last statement
about sixty millions had been added to
the receipts. In new money the Fund-
ing Loan and the Victory Bonds had
run neck and neck, 287 millions to 286.
But as regards conversions the Funding
Loan had won hands down with 120
millions to 72. It is believed that the

past!”
OUR ENEMY STILL.
WHENEVER I pay a visit to my
brother it has become almost a matter of
routine that I devote an hour each even-
ing to my nephew Robert, my niece Hen-
rietta and their nursery. Many an hour
have Robert and I spent in marshall-
ing hordes of tin troops over the green
linoleum and laying waste cardboard
houses and villages. The uniforms and
nationalities of our armies are of little
account. One of the best battles I can
remember was between some thirty or
forty Grenadier Guards, under the com-
mand of Robert, who had temporarily
assumed the character of ALEXANDER
THE GREAT, against a troup of staunch
boy scouts, supported by Red Indian
cavalry, gallantly led by NApoleon THE
THIRD, whose earthly shell was that of
a Colonel in the St. John's Ambulance
Corps. e
During these combats Henrietta sat
at the other end of the nursery minis-
tering to the wants of a large family of
dolls. In spite of Robert's protesta-
tions I always devoted ten minutes of
the hour to his sister. But neither
Henrietta nor I found this very satis-
factory; I am not a family-man and
never shall be.
Since the declaration of Peace—I
refer, of course, to the wars outside
Robert's nursery—Henrietta has devel-
oped a taste, simple as yet, for me-
chanics. Her family lies in ghastly
disorder at the bottom of the toy-cup-
board, and now she sits in the same
corner winding up a clockwork-man
with a waxed moustache who continu-
ally saws a piece of wood. From time
to time kindly relations add to her col-
lection. Last Christmas she was pre-
sented with a performing acrobat, who
gyrated madly round a horizontal bar.
The other day I spent the week-end
with my brother and, as usual, went
up to the nursery. For once I went,
not as a general, but as a propagandist.
I had heard that German ships had
already sailed from their harbours, bear.
ing Eastward cargoes of merchandise
in order to re-establish their trade. A
large portion of this merchandise would
consist of toys; therefore I felt it my
duty to warn Robert and Henrietta lest
they should unwittingly trade with the
enemy.
“Robert,” I said, as we moved to and
fro over the linoleum, “never allow a
German toy to darken your nursery
cupboard.”
“No fear !” replied Robert, as he
deftly advanced a platoon of infantry
into a position that threatened myright
flank. “Now, Uncle Henry, do sur-
render and we'll have a grand march-

Kathleen (to father, who has accidentally broken her pet doll). “Y-You Is N'T won thy To BE A GRANDPA.”
I surrendered and left Robert to ar-
range the march. I found Henrietta
winding up a new toy with tremendous
enthusiasm.
“Hullo, Henrietta, what 's this?” I
asked.
“German pvisoner,” puffed Henri-
etta curtly.
Having wound it up she placed it on
the floor. It was, indeed, a splendid
toy. There was a platform and some
ingenious machinery, the result of which
was that an English soldier with a
bayonet was continually pursuing a
German soldier, alternately prodding
him with his bayonet and administer-
ing corporal punishment with his boot.
Henrietta and I were convulsed with
laughter.
“By Jove!” said I, as the pair came
to rest with the Englishman's boot
firmly emplanted on his foe, “that's
good. I'll bet you it's a French toy
. . . they'll never forget. Let's have
a look at it, Henrietta.”
She handed it to me. I picked it up
and searched for the familiar Marque
Deposée. I searched in vain. But on
the sole of the German's boot I found
four letters—“D.R.G.M.,” which, alas !
signify “Made in Germany ”.
So the enemy had already arrived,
without humour and without shame.
THE DIPLOMATS.
IV.
MY DEAR HENRY, The demands upon
us are of infinite variety and come from
applicants of every possible nationality.
One has only to set up in business
abroad these days and state on the
door-plate that one is BRITISH, and the
whole of Europe is represented in the
queue waiting outside one's front-door
next morning. The requests may be for
anything, from the loan of an infantry
division to the purchase of a gent's
summer suiting. About twice a week
a deputation waits upon us with the
simple request that we should take over
Turkey en bloc, and then all will be
well. When I rise to reply that we,
Bill, Ralph and myself, are only we,
myself, Ralph and Bill, the deputation,
with true Oriental cunning, takes it for
granted that we are saying the exact
opposite of what we mean and asks
for a further appointment on the day
following to arrange details of the
transfer. Sometimes I have been goaded
into saying that if the deputation isn't
careful I will take over Turkey, and at
this the deputation frowns at itself and
determines to dismiss its spokesman
for having put me off the bargain when
I was just about to accept. But the
Oriental is a sticker and likes to make
a long job of a thing—the long way
round for the long way round's sake.
I sometimes wonder whether the water
is not dripping with effect on to the
stone; is Bill thinking, after all, of
taking over the Ottoman Empire?
Upon my word I doubt if anyone would
notice it at home if he did.
About two-and-a-half months ago a
man came to us and said he wanted
nothing. Pressed to reveal the mean-
ing of this overture, he explained that
he wanted absolutely nothing. He had
just dropped in to make our acquaint-
ance and have a chat. We tried him
with the offer of a British Army Corps,
a ninety-nine years' lease of the Port
of Smyrna at a peppercorn rent, or five
francs and a packet of cigarettes to tell
us all he knew. He said he wanted
nothing and offered us a cigar each. 1
looked at my watch with a sorry-to-

expression; Bill asked him to repeat
his name and took it down in block
letters for future reference; Ralph,
recognising a kindred spirit, pulled up
his chair in an encouraging manner,
accepted the cigar and generously gave
him one of my matches. It ultimately
transpired that when he said he wanted

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
nothing, he meant nothing to speak of.
He wanted to know the contents of the
Peace Treaty as at that date just pre-
sented to the German delegates at Wer-
sailles. Bill grunted; I gathered my-
self together to kill him with a speech,
and Ralph seized the opportunity to
explain that what I was about to say
was that the contents of the Peace
Treaty should be his by noon to-morrow.
His train for his distant home country
was to leave in the early afternoon.
I asked Ralph, after the man's depar-
ture, what he meant by promising the
impossible to a more than improbable
customer? Ralph pointed out the fact
that he was a newspaper man of a far
country and therefore of infinite use.
We said we saw no use at all; his news
columns we could read without his per-
mission, and his advertisement columns
were his own affair. Ralph observed
that there is a half-and-half column,
which looks like news but is really
advertisement; we should want a place
in that some day all to ourselves. There
was something in this; no scheme is
possible these days without advertise-
ment. We did not know what we might
be doing to-morrow. We have not too
clear an idea what we are doing to-day.
But how to get the Peace Treaty?
“That,” said Ralph, “I leave to you,”
and went his ways, no doubt, to involve
us in further undertakings with his low
friends. “We’ve got to do it,” said I.
“We must keep in with Ralph, since
soon we shall be wanting a second
motor-car.” Bill agreed; Bill feels in-
wardly that we ought to have a car
apiece.
I asked a Secretary of the Legation
to lunch. I also asked his wife to
lunch. I made it clear that if there
had been any children I would have
asked them too. The Secretary inquired
what this was all about 2 I told him to
get on with the costly food and not be
suspicious. I said that he would, of
course, take coffee—the special coffee.
I told him that his wife would also.
And a liqueur 2 Or two 2 And cigars 2
Would his wife break her rule and also
have a cigar this once? I made it clear
that if there had been any children they
should have had a box of Coronas each
to play with. “And now be a good
fellow,” I said, “and show me that
Peace Treaty of yours.”
The Secretary said he would have
been only too glad to divulge the whole
secret, did he but know it. He would
have even borrowed the Legation copy,
had there but been one. He would
have entertained the entire personnel of
all the Allied Legations had it not been
the fact that they also were kept in
the dark. Developing the matter fur.
ther, he pointed out that the Four were
keeping the details entirely to them-
selves; the House of Commons in Eng-
land was clamouring to be told, and
clamouring in vain; Senators in Amer-
ica, who had got hold of some spicy
bits and were repeating them, were
being threatened with dire punishment
by the PRESIDENT, who was said to be
contemplating the issue of fourteen
more points, if they weren't careful; and
in every Allied country every man who
could set pen to paper was writing
letters to his favourite journal, apolo-
gising for trespassing on its valuable
space, but insisting on the scandal of
keeping the terms hidden even from the
important people in the Home Govern-
ment. So, said the Secretary, there
was nothing doing, and there would
have been no better results even if he
had had a dozen children and I had
filled them all to the brim with caviare.
So that was that. If the Four were
keeping their magnum opus so SRCRET,
CONFIDENTIAL, PERSONAL AND PRIVATE
as that, the Three were down and out
in the matter. But were they? Where
was Bill all this time, and what was he
doing?
Bill often strolls round to the shop
of the German Official Propaganda
Bureau, about lunch-time, to read the
latest news about Ireland. He asked
the man behind the counter, in his best
German, if he had any notes about the
Peace Treaty. The man behind the
counter presented him with a hand-
somely bound volume, printed and pub.
lished that very morning by the German
Society for the Prevention of War and
the Suppression of Tyrants, and being
“The Official Peace Terms, as Presented
by the Four to the German Delegates
at Versailles.” It was in English.
Bill bought two copies, one to be
given (with cover removed) to our im-
pressionable friend, the other to be
sent (with cover) to our House of
Commons. Yours ever, CHARLEs.
OUR WASHINGTON POST.
MANY people seem to think that Mr.
Punch has it in his power to accelerate
the Government in appointing a British
Ambassador to the United States. The
result is that he receives letters on
the subject every day. He has no hope
of either himself or anyone else being
able to accelerate the present Govern-
ment in any direction whatever, but it
is flattering to be thought so influential.
A selection of recent letters follow :-
Lord RIBBLESDALE writes: If Mr.
BoMAR LAw could be spared from Par-
liament he would, I am certain, make
an ideal Ambassador to the States. He
has a balanced mind, a pleasant way of
temporising and doubtless other quali-
ties of use in a diplomatic intermediary.
But being so conscious of his value to
the Government, for perhaps just those

PRIME MINISTER’s mind as a possible
choice. One cannot think of West-

therefore fall back on other suggestions.

Mr. H. G. WELLs writes: The more

I am that BENNETT is the ideal candi-

the times, he has a Transatlantic repu-

delightful discussions between BENNETT

such is my detestation of forcible pro-

to suggest as a substitute for my un-

makes no secret of his devotion to

whose love of paradox would be amply
rewarded in such an environment.

THE FATALIST.
OF course Elizabeth isn't to blame.
She will tell you herself that she was
“born unlucky.” But destiny having
now woven my life with hers it has
made me unlucky too. You see, Eliza-
beth is my domestic worker—a product
of peace. She is not clean or tidy or
respectful or economical or a good
cook; but Nature having endowed her
with enough propelling power to enable
her to wash up, I cling to Elizabeth
with the steady force and tenacity of
the barnacle.
The only thing that I actually com-
plain about is her intense fatalism.
"I've been unlucky an' broke the
“It wasn't me 'ands,” she said; “it
was me feet. The floor gave way and
I went through.”
“You went through the floor . "
I marvelled. And then my face
cleared. The house is not mine, and
after all the landlord has no right to
escape these unusual machinations of
fate.
“I knew something 'd happen when
I put the boots on the table by accident
this mornin’,” she explained. “It's
always a bad sign.”
But you mustn't think that Elizabeth
allows her fatalism to interfere with her
judgment. For she came to me the
other day looking actually concerned.
“I’m sorry, 'm,” she said, “but them
vases, and in that moment I hated
Elizabeth.
But she began to speak before I did.
“It isn't as if I’d been unlucky—I
couldn't ha' helped that. But I know
when I'm in the wrong”—she unfolded
a parcel she had in her hand as she
"spoke—“so I went out larst night an'
bought these to replace what I broke.
Right's right, I always say;” and
she laid down before me a pair of vases
on which were emblazoned gigantic and
strangely-hued flowers that could belong
to no earthly flora. “They're bigger
than the varses I broke,” murmured
Elizabeth, regarding her purchase with
satisfaction.
And then I saw that she wore an ||
teapot this mornin'," she an-
nounces. “That means I'll break
another two things afore the
week's out. It always goes in
threes.”
“Then hadn't you better smash
something that is of no value at
once,” I suggest anxiously, “and
get it over?”
“It's no good,” she says with
conviction ; “I’ve tried that before
an' it didn't work. It has to be
done unexpected.”
There is something positively un-
canny in the way misfortune lies
in wait for that girl; you would
think that after causing her to
break two full breakfast services
it would leave her alone for a
while. But no, she has now
started on a third, and her luck
shows no sign of changing.
Spilling the salt accounted for
three burnt saucepans and the
collapse of the plate-rack (at the
moment fully charged); while

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Jeremy (CAssell) is an attempt at that very rare thing,
an absolutely sincere book about childhood. I can imagine
Mr. HUGH WALPole embarking upon it with the stern
resolve to avoid at once artificial sentiment and the tongue-
in-cheek manner of the self-conscious humourist. Just how
far he has succeeded I will leave the individual reader to
determine; he has certainly produced an unusually inter-
esting study of nursery life. We meet the hero, Jeremy,
trailing clouds of glory on the morning of his eighth birth-
day; we take leave. of him, a year later, departing for his
first school. This momentous period Mr. WALPole has
reviewed in twelve chapters, each making its definite mark
in Jeremy's development towards boyhood—the arrival of
the family dog, an engaging monster named Hamlet, loved
by Jeremy throughout the book more than any created
being; the departure of Nurse (“Jampot”) and the advent
in her stead of Miss Jones, middle-aged and inefficient,
whom the nursery tortured and then protected; trouble of
illness in the house, and the like. So far as memory serves
one may say about the three inmates of the Cole nursery
that they ring true. Jeremy himself, cruel, vain, curious,
affectionate, dreamer and profound egoist, does exercise
the charm of genuine childhood, exceptional, perhaps, but
real; while of his two sisters, Maru, the “misunderstood,”
with her too-jealous affection and her fatal habit of un-
timely sentiment, is a portrait almost painfully convincing.
Of course the incidents are “arranged" to some extent; in
actual life events would hardly fall out so readably. But
this only means that Mr. WALPole is a practised novelist,
whose determination not to emulate heaven and “lie about
about us in our infancy” (if you will forgive the antique
jest) has resulted in a volume that will provoke both
laughter and discussion in equal parts.
If novels whose authors have their location—to use their
language also—in the United States at all represent real
life in those promiscuous parts it must be the very nicest
place on earth in which to be a damsel in distress. From
the perusal of many American novels on this theme I have
gathered that a little distress at first is an absolute guarantee
of the heroine's ultimate health, wealth and happiness.
The history — as told by Mrs. AMANDA B. HALL–of
Daphne Haggin, the eldest of the family who inhabited
The Little Red House in the Hollow (HURST AND BLACKETT),
is no exception to the rule, and I may say for myself that
after the first page I never expected that it would be.
Daphne's distress was that, while visiting her rich relations,
she met, loved, and was kissed by, a fashionable young artist
addicted to wearing white suits all the year round (which
convinced me at once that he was not a really nice person),
who afterwards found her drunken father and ramshackle
home sufficiently discouraging to prevent him from earry-
ing the affair to a proper conclusion. His perfidy had the

unfortunate result of blinding Daphne for some time to the
worth of the ideal American hero who opportunely arrived
upon the scene; but a comparison between the conduct of
her two lovers on the occasion of a fire opened her eyes
effectively, and, after receiving and refusing the long-delayed
proposal from the artist, a little flustered by the conscious-
ness that he had not shown up to advantage as a fireman,
our heroine comes out of her distress triumphantly all
round. When I tell you that it is said of the heroine that
“she squinted archly at him (the hero) over her sandwich,”
and of the hero that he was “thin and attenuated,” you
will perhaps decline to believe me when I say further that
it is a pretty story quite prettily told. But it is.
Storm in a Teacup (HEINEMANN) makes me wonder
whether Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTTs' plan of explaining an in-
dustry and telling a story in the same book is altogether
happy. Here, at any rate, the difficulties which beset
those who try to combine instruction with amusement can
Advocacy on all counts after listening to the apologia of
an advocate himself so human and humorous. He is a
little stern with the Bench, perhaps, every now and then,
but no doubt they deserve it, and in any case all of us may
enjoy seeing the Judges, who give so much, getting a little
back. The skill of the draftsman appears in the fact that
Mr. STRAHAN has been able, in a little book of 256 pages, to
give an exact conception of all the respective attributes of
the tribunal, the lawyers and the parties to litigation, a
short suryey of the history and principles of English law,
and a graphic picture of life in the Temple of yesterday;
the skill of the pleader is shown by the certain prospect of
a verdict enabling Judges, Leaders and Juniors all to leave
the court, or stay in it, without a stain on their characters.
Laymen will possibly feel a slight regret to be deprived of
a theme—“lawyers are liars"—which has served them so
well; and members of the four Inns may perhaps be so
impressed by the skill of Mr. STRAHAN's defence as to
clearly be detected. And

divorce, treated Medora solely as a companion and typist.
Medora, however, soon tired of this unwiſely existence
and in the end returned to the husband from whom she
had fled. We are led to suppose that by this time she had
been taught to think less of brains and more of brawn;
Mr. PHILLPotts, however, does not entirely convince me
that Mr. Dingle's future happiness was assured. The
storm, such as it is, is relieved by many gleams of sun-
shine in the way of humour, but—as the title sufficiently
suggests—it is a quite diminutive affair.
All members of the four Inns will be of opinion that
their learned friend, Mr. J. A. STRAHAN, has very ably and
pleasantly defended the profession in The Bench and Bar
of England (BLAckwood), and they will trust that no more
will be heard of the persistent and unreasoned abuse which
has been heaped upon them since that time when the
memory of man runneth not to the contrary. The lay
public will testify that the author most ingeniously mixes
up the powder (sometimes very dry) of corrective facts with
the jam of amusing anecdotes, and will thank him for
being at such pains to tickle their fancies while he is re-
forming their views. It would be an impossibly hard-
hearted jury which hesitated to acquit the Profession of
ever, I gladly admit the
possibility that others may find better sport in (or between)
Mr. ERNEST GooDw1N's covers. To turn to the actual story,
this is about an unsatisfied artist who picks up a sixpence for
a lady in Oxford Street, asks her to tea and falls in love with
her. At least, no; this is only what the story begins to be about.
As a fact the lady (in whom I was prepared to be pleas-
antly interested) disappears till the last chapter, the artist
takes to a caravan, and we get an entirely different and not
nearly so attractive adventure, in which he is mistaken
(a) by comic countrymen for a travelling photographer, and
(b) by some improbable snobs for an eccentric peer. As
his studio had contained on its wall the portrait of a fair
unknown, by the hand of a previous tenant, it hardly as-
tonished me at all that, at the very first village green on
which his caravan rested, he should encounter the original.
This, of course, supplies an adequate love interest and
may draw sighs from the sympathetic ; but as for the
“chuckles,” I can only repeat that he must be of enviable
risibility whose return in them is at all up to schedule.

EVERY MAN HIS OWN —.
IN the face of so many signs of un-
rest and such a prevalent tendency to
down whatever is downable, Mr. Punch
has no alternative but to embrace his
métier anew and spring forward as the
guide, philosopher and friend to all.
For if there is no one left to do things
for us we must do them for ourselves,
whether it is baking our bread or stand-
ing on point duty or driving engines
or extracting fuel from the reluctant
and very grimy soil, or whatever else it
may be. For when Adam no longer
delves and Eve declines to spin, Eve
has to acquire the rudiments of spade-
work and Adam must deal as faithfully
as he can with thread.
Now for some practical hints both
to Adam and Eye to help tide them
over the fretful days ahead.
How To BAKE.
Baking is one of the oldest of the
household arts. It is mentioned both
by HERoDoTUs and HIPPocRATES; but
let that pass. The idea of baking is to
produce bread, a much over-rated article
of food which only butter can make
tolerable, but which it is agreed every-
one must have, Bread is made in
lumps called loaves, which can be either
round or square according to taste. A
loaf should be hard and brownish with-
out, and fairly soft and white within.
Before, however, baking can begin much
must have been done: the farmer has
had to plough and harrow and sow.
Then a i. has had to scare the rooks
away, and then what wheat the rooks
have left has had to grow, and such as
remains after the English summer has
done its worst with it has to be cut
and stacked and thrashed and the
resultant corn ground by the miller
into flour. It is at this point that you,
dear reader, come in. Having pur-
chased your flour you take a basin and
mix it with water in such a way that
the stuff sticks to your hands. This is
humorously called kneading it—the
“k” being silent, as in “knut,” and the
need becoming more excessive every
day. Having sufficiently kned it you
put it in the oven and wash your hands.
In the course of some hours, during
which you must never cease to peer
through the crack of the oven door, the
heat of the fire (if you have any coal for
the purpose, which is extremely un-
likely) will brown the loaf all over, and
when you judge it to be done you will
remove the red-hot loaf with whatever
is most handy, but a pair of wicket-
keeping gloves is best, and set it aside
to cool. Later the lord and master will
arrive and, after taking a mouthful, will
say, “What the dickens is the matter
with this bread 2" You will then reply
—and not without reason—“I’m very
sorry, darling, but Mr. Punch in his
otherwise careful directions never said
a word about yeast.”
CAKE.
Cake is made very much in the same
way as bread, only it is more fun
because there are currants and sugar
as well as the flour, and every now and
then you can have a taste. Cakes also
need an egg or two to make them light,
and (we are getting cautious after that
bloomer about the yeast) some baking-
powder. In order to prevent them from
being what is called “sad" it is well,
while sitting by the oven door, to read
aloud some sprightly article or story or
even to sing a merry song. Ever since
the days of MARIE ANToINETTE cake
has been an accepted substitute for
bread, but that queen was very careful
not to allow ALFRED THE GREAT to bake
it for her.
CoAL.
To those living in London who find
it difficult to obtain this material, Mr.
Punch's advice is—Take a sack down to
Victoria Street or Parliament Square,
or to whatever other place where they
are repaving the road, and collect as
many wood blocks as you can carry.
If stopped by the police drop the full
sack on his toes (there will be plenty
of room for it) and run.
How To WASH CLoTHEs.
With laundry prices so high it be-
hoves every one to learn how to wash
clothes. For this purpose a tub is
needed, a supply of hot water and one
of the many varieties of soap now to be
obtained to which such original and
witty names as “Washo" and “Scrub-l.
bo” are given. Having prepared the
tub to receive it, you plunge the garment
in and proceed to deal with it either as
your laundry is in the habit of doing, or
as you would prefer it to be done. If
you are an idealist you will see that it
is clean and uninjured; but if you wish
merely to reproduce in your home the
methods of your laundry you will see
that the buttons are wrenched off, the
handkerchiefs torn and the soft cuffs
of your evening silk shirt scrupulously
starched. Afterwards you will iron
these things and, with the example of
your laundry before you, keep the iron
on them till they are well and perman-
ently browned.
FALSE MoSEY.
In the scarcity of the genuine article
forged notes that will pass are of the
highest use. The first thing to do is to
cultivate the acquaintance of the village
blacksmith, who will then lend you his
forge. The rest is easy. -
THE REASON.
“WELL," I asked, as the time drew
near, “which is it to be—fishing or
golf?” My hopes were fixed on the
answer being golf.
“Fishing,” said my wife with instant
decision.
“I can't see what difference it makes
to you,” I said, “as you do neither.”
She nodded her head wisely.
“Let it be fishing,” she repeated.
So fishing it is, and here we are.
My wife, I must confess, behaves charm-
ingly; each morning she walks out the
first mile with us, chats with the gilly,
who adores her, wishes us good luck,
and leaves us; each evening she looks
up with the kindest commiseration, or
lays down her book and comes to stand
by my side and say, “It is a beauty,
| º or “Two How perfectly splen-
id 1 '' -
None the less the inn is indifferent,
and until last night it remained a mys-
tery to me why she should prefer fishing
to golf. But last night I overheard
her talking to another woman. “This
is possible,” she said; “but when it
is golf they come in twice a day, and
each time you have to follow the history
of eighteen holes and be ready with
eighteen suitable remarks—more, if the
bunkers are very bad. The strain is
awful; but fishing I can just manage.”
THE MENIN WAY.
ALONG the cobbled Menin way
The wine and wool were sent,
And market waggons every day
To Ypres and Menin went,
And oh! the laughing women sat and
sewed
Before their houses on the Menin road.
There are no houses now ; the rain
In pools where they have been
Lies deep; or out upon the plain
A few frail walls may lean;
And oh! the little children must not
play
With what they find beside the Menin
way.
And I remember gallant men
And lads who fought and died,
And think of all their laughter when
They said Good-bye—and lied;
For “Oh it's not too bad,” they used
to say,
“Along the Armentières and Menin
way.”

come to if the bakers persist in striking.

THE TREMBLING FIST.
It was not that we did not know
the man's face, although strangers are
rarely seen at the “Horse and Groom,”
Barleyhammerden. We were not sur-
prised at his drawn features and haunted
eyes, for he was in khaki. Our silence
—and you ought to hear us at 12.5 of
an average morning—was impelled by
a curious and fascinating mannerism
of the unknown visitor. -
When first he approached the bar
and while waiting to give his order
to Mr. Appleyard's assistant, he lifted
the closed fist of his right hand to the
right side of his head. Just so he
posed, and then he appeared to impart
a trembling movement to his right
forearm.
I wasn't the first to notice it. I think
Fuggle, the auctioneer, who is reckoned a
spry fellow even for Barleyhammerden,
was the one who nearly dropped his
glass and said, “Well, I'm dashed ' "
But two or three of the others after-
wards claimed that they had noticed
the thing all along and hadn't cared
to speak about it. The amazing part
of the business was that the soldier con-
stantly repeated his strange movement,
and it was quickly borne upon us that
the gesture was involuntary and that
here was an affliction that only disease
could have bequeathed.
There is always a man in every bar
who knows everything. Well, Bert
Norris is our local “know-all,” and
when he came in at 12.20 he sized the
case up in a couple of glances. We told
him about the soldier, and he nodded
just as if he was the doctor or the bank
manager. Then he watched the poor
chap lift his shaking hand once or twice
and said right out, without beating
about the bush, “Shell-shock!”
Then we all knew. We'd all had it
at the back of our heads that it might,
be shell-shock, but it was one of those
cases where you felt it better to keep
your opinion to yourself. , Still, there
was no doubt Norris was right. Nothing
else could explain the thing. And when
Norris went up to the soldier and in
the nicest possible way asked him to
have a pint, and the soldier said he
would, we were all rather proud of
Norris and knew he was right in his
diagnosis.
Then came Mr. Appleyard, rotund
and kindly master of the inn. One or
two of us had to smile when he first
spotted the soldier's trick. His eyes
became fixed, and he moved down his
bar to watch more closely. Soon he
came back to our end with quite a
startled expression on his face.
“What's he doing that for, I wonder?”
he asked plaintively.
“Doing what?"replies Norriscockily.
“Why, making funny business with
his fist. Haven't you noticed it? Look
at that now. There he goes again!"
“Shell-shock,” says Norris.
Old “Apple” drew in a deep atmo-

spherical draught of understanding and
a look of commiseration stole over his
face.
“Well, there now,” he soliloquised,
“shell-shock, eh? Poor, poor fellow.
And I had a boy out there. . . . But
for the mercy of 'eaven, as you might
say . . . Shell-shock, eh? Poor, poor
fellow. I can't bear to look at 'im . . .
Here, boys, what do you say to a little
whip-round, eh?”
All were in a kindly mood, and in no
time Mr. Appleyard collected a purse
of fifteen shillings. (We raised two
guineas once—before the War—for the
tailor, when he had to have all his teeth
out and couldn't undo knots.) “Apple”
beckoned the soldier over, and, funnily
enough, started to shout at him. Of
course he might have been deaf as well;
you never know.
- “Hope there 's no offence,” said
“Apple,” “but the boys felt they'd like
to do something for you.” The soldier
stared at him blankly. “Do sometHING
For You !” roared “Apple” at the top
of his voice, sure now that the soldier
was deaf. “Here's fifteen bob we've
collected. Buy yourself some drinks and
smokes—yes, DRINKs AND SMoREs ' "
“Well, I'm sure it's very kind of you,
gentlemen, very kind. . . . I can't say
more.” He bashfully resumed his seat,
elevated his right fist and shook it.
“What part of the line were you?”
thundered “Apple.” “Didn't meet my
boy, Is'pose? Where did you get your
shell-shock 2 ” -
“What's that ?” asked the soldier.
“SHELL-shock,” shrieked “Apple.”
“Where did you get it?”
“I 'aven't got no shell-shock.”
For some of us the room emptied
itself of air.
“No, gentlemen, I 'aven't got no
shell-shock. Whatever made you think
that ? I've never been outside this
country in my life.”
“Apple's" face was nearly purple.
“You’ve never been out of the
country ! You sit there and tell me
that. What do you mean by doing this
funny business with your fist 2 Yes,
clenching your fist and holding it up and
shaking it. What d'ye mean by it?”
“Oh, that,” said the soldier. He
drew back the cuff of his right sleeve
and revealed a wrist-watch. “You see
I bought this silly thing this morning
and I can't get it to go.”
“It is idle to pretend that the just griev-
ances of policemen may justify them in
paralysing the life of the community, but the
just grievances of doctors cannot. That can-
not be true.”—Daily Paper.
Our contemporary owes an apology to
the medical profession for this horrify-

[AUGUST 13, 1919.
TWO WANDERERS IN RUSSIA.
THE story of Swingleham and his kit
is one that appeals strangely to the
imagination. Swingleham landed at
Archangel in May, with a white star on
his shoulder, heroism in his heart and
a soldier's simple needs in his valise.
His abilities were so various, his experi-
ences so diverse, his qualifications so
incongruous, that the gods who govern
one's destinies from Archangel were
puzzled to know what to do with him.
When, in reply to their inquiry as to his
wishes, he said that of course he wanted
a fighting job, they smiled at him
pleasantly and thought it would be best
to appoint him as A.M.L.O., or Assist-
ant Military Landing Officer, at a place
away, and might not be available for
weeks.
“How can I go, then?” asked Swin-
gleham. -
“You might wait, till the winter and
go by sleigh,” said the N.T.O.; “or—
1'll ring up Cupples and see if he can
give you a droshky.”
Cupples was a wonderful R.A.S.C.
man who had spent an endless winter
working miracles, but he was abso-
lutely stumped for droshkies.
“How far is it?” asked Swingleham.
“Twenty versts,” said the N.T.O.
“I’ll walk it,” said Swingleham,
“and your Mr. Cupples can push off
my kit after me, like a kind soul, when
he can raise a droshky.”
So Swingleham walked off and
So Swingleham embarked, his face
at last towards the battle. But when
he reached Shedish the battalion had
moved. Nothing , daunted, having
bought a tooth-brush and a towel from
Ordnance, he caught a barge and
followed it, leaving instructions with
the N.T.O. at Shedish to keep the kit
moving in his wake . . . -
With the battalion, a few weeks later,
Swingleham returned to Shedish. His
valise had left two days before, trying
to overtake him. (You will kindly re-
member the size of North Russia.)
So it goes on. Everybody is trying
to help Swingleham. His story is well-
known throughout the Allied forces;
not an Embarkation or Naval Transport
officer, O.C. troops or Base Command-
which we will call Ust-
Troitski, consisting of
two wooden houses,
three tents and a ferry-
boat on the banks of a
tributary of the Dvina.
His command and staff .
there were to consist of ,
a British corporal and
two Russian soldiers ;
and his work would be
to scan the shining
stretches of the broad
river on the chance that
a barge-load of troops
might haul in to Ust-
Troitski.
The prospect did not
please Swingleham, but
he had a soldier - soul,
and proceeded—though
grousing — whither he LANGUAGE.”

ant but is familiar with
the externals of the val-
ise. The respective or-
bits of the man and his
kit are matter for fre-
quent priority wires;
the emergies of a large
number of brilliant and
determined organisers
are concentrated on the
effort to effect their
junction.
I said that this sim-
ple story appeals to the
imagination. Is there
not food for fancy in
the thought of the
lonely travels of those
two—the man discon-
solate though refusing

delightful barge-trip of
two or three days, reached an im-
portant village, where there were as
many as twenty wooden houses, one
of them being what is known here as a
Rest House. This village we will call
Pinetskoe, and there the barge deposited
Swingleham and his valise to await
transport for Ust-Troitski.
Having dropped his kit at the Rest
House, Swingleham dashed off to see
the Naval Transport Officer and ask
when the boat for Ust-Troitski left.
That was how he put it—“the boat for
Ust-Troitski,” as who should say “the
London Express.” The N.T.O., long-
suffering but a little cynical, asked
when he would like it to go, and
Swingleham said “At once.”
Then the N.T.O. explained how things
really were; that the river was low,
and still sinking; that there was only
one tug of shallow enough draught to
cross the bar at the mouth of the Troit-
ski river, that she was busy pulling
barges off the sand miles and miles
reached Ust-Troitski in a mist of flies
and a white lather; and the Corporal
met him with a telegram saying that he
was posted to a Slavo-British battalion
and was to report forthwith at Shedish.
Where Shredish was Swingleham didn't
know, so, after mopping his brow and
remarking about the flies, he walked
back to Pinetskoe. There he found a
tug at the quay on the point of starting
for Shedish—a four days’ journey.
“By Jove, how lucky!” said Swingle-
ham to the N.T.O.; “I’ll get my valise
from the Rest House and push off.”
“Your valiseisn't at the Rest House,”.
said the N.T.O. “Didn't it pass you on
the Ust-Troitski road 2 I got hold of a
droshky just after you left and sent it
off on your track.”
“Never saw it,” said Swingleham.
“Please have it sent after me to
Shedish; there's a Corporal at Ust-
Troitski who'll turn the droshky round
when it blows in there. I'm not going
to miss this boat.”
ing week by week, day
and night, along the wide polished vistas
of shallow rivers, bumping in carts on
woodland tracks, waiting in bare rest
houses or crowded camps, passing each
other unaware perhaps, as one big barge
slides by another on the Dvina; per-
haps even waiting on the same beach
for boats going opposite ways.
Though they all do their best to
bring it about, his friends do not know
whether the reunion might not now
be a disaster. At present Swingleham's
valise is a beautiful dream to him, an
inspiration, a daily hope. His first
thought every morning is that the new
day may bring it; at meals he falls
into trance-like contemplation, and we
know that his inner eye is following it,
with its incredibly various and com-
plete contents, to and fro and up and
down upon the sun-beaten roadways
and waterways of this vast, lonely and
most leisurely land. Is not disillusion-
ment inevitable if ever Swingleham's
dream is consummated?

“WELL, and what are you people
doing about holidays?” said Pamela.
After three months we three had
met again, and were now in Pam's
boudoir discussing holidays, those holi-
days which we had planned so many
times during our war-work.
Our castles in the air had taken
different shapes. Pam, who had been
an R.A.F. driver for two years, had
planned a long lazy month in Cornwall
—the sea-bathing, bed-at-eight-o'clock
variety. Diana, whose hands still tes-
tified to her unceasing labours on the
land for the past three years, evidently
considered that Brighton was the height
of human bliss; while I, having washed
up, scrubbed floors, blacked grates and
incidentally tended the wounded, felt
that the only holiday worth having
was a country house one, with heaps
of lawn-tennis and boating.
These had been our plans on being
demobilised, and now, after a strenuous
three months of jazzing, theatres and
so on, we had met by appointment to
discuss once more the joys of our much-
talked-of holidays.
At Pam's question I felt my face glow,
but, on gazing furtively round, I was
surprised to see the same phenomenon
apparent in the others. There was
a short pause, then Diana broke into
hurried conversation.
“Look here, you two, I've been so
bored these last months with people
and everything that I could weep, and
the thought of Brighton doesn't attract
somehow. A girl I used to know at
the farm, and who is still there, is long-
ing for a month off, so I'm going back
to take her place.” -
This came out with a defiant rush.
Pam and I gazed at each other and then
dissolved into laughter.
“What is it 2 ” cried Diana.
don't mean—”
“But I do,” said Pam. “I’ve been
so fed up and missed the car so much
that I've persuaded my uncle, the
doctor, you know, to give his chauffeur
a month off and let me take his place.”
They both turned to me. “Now
then, Anne, what's your horrid secret?”
“A month at St. Mark's Hospital,
because they are so shorthanded,” I
confessed; and the holidays committee
broke up in disorder.

then at the clock.”—Daily Mail, Aug. 4th.

TO A GOLF-BALL.
OH, was it just here in the bramble
Or right over there in the whin
That thou boundedst with many a
gambol
And poppedst exultingly in 2
As a sword that is swung by the smiter
Thou cleavedst the ambient blue,
And I cried, “I will hole out that
blighter,
So help me, in two.”
How little I thought of disaster
As I stepped to the seventeenth tee
And, assuming the airs of a master,
Adjusted each ankle and knee,
Poised lightly, addressed thee and drave
thee,
Then poised with professional mien,
Never dreaming the belt that I gave
thee
Had carried the green.
The lark in the blue empyrean
Sings sweetly and mounts as he sings,
And I would for the nonce I could be an
Ethereal creature with wings;
Not hunting a piffulent pellet,
A target for prickle and spine,
And wondering where in the deuce it
Contrives to recline.
As a rabbit surprised in the ſurrow
And chased by the ravening hound
Retires in disgust to his burrow
And passes the day underground,
So lurkest thou, deſtly concealed
In a bower of sweet grasses and
thyme,
Secure as an eft or an eel hid
In bottomless slime.
My caddie I long since have rated
As one with the bat and the mole,
And Smith, my opponent, elated,
Implores me to give up the hole;
I wis he is anxious to collar
A cheaply won triumph, and claim
The match and the paltry half-dollar
We have on the game.
Not so. Though I search for an aeon
Till my soul become one with the
wilds
And a crop of white whiskers flow free
On
This chin that is bare as a child's,
Some day I shall find thee and play
thee,
Yea, grasping my niblick with glee,
A foot from the pin will I lay thee
And sink thee in three.
And Smith (well along in the seventies)
Will shake his abandoned old head
And, croaking, “An outrage, by Heaven,
'tis ”
Go doddering home to his bed;
But me they will lay in my coffin
And friends will inscribe on my bier,

His ninety-fifth year.” ALGOL.
CELESTIAL LOOT.
YESTERDAY evening, just before dusk,
I heard a commotion outside my hut.
Putting my head round the door to see
what was the matter, I nearly butted
into my two old friends, Ah Sin and
Dam Li. .
“China boy wantchee say good-byee,”
they began together as soon as they
saw me. “You savvy, go back to China
plenty quick to-mollow.”
“I am very sorry to hear that,” I re-
plied truthfully. “I shall miss you both
very much indeed—although you are a
couple of awful ruſſians, aren't you?”
Dam Li grinned. -
“Ah Sin number one big luffian,” he
agreed; “but Dam Li * > -
“Dam Li blother to Ah Sin,” the
latter worthy put in promptly, “and
allee both plenty too muchee sad for
leaving hon’lable officer,” he went on.
“Him number one topside fine gentle-
man an' China boy no wantchee go.”
I had heard this gratifying intelli-
gence about myself too often to be
greatly impressed by it. I knew ex-
actly what was coming—a shameless
attempt to wheedle something out of
me before they went. My pockets felt
lighter already in anticipation, for I
knew that I could never harden my
heart this time, when in all human
probability I should never see them
again.
“Aren't you glad to be going back to
China 2 ” I asked after a while, seeing
that they seemed to be waiting for me
to say something. .
“China welly tip-top,” admitted Ah
Sin, “but sea too muchee bad. Makeum
lations topsy-turvy in stomach,” he
added with a wave of his hand towards
that susceptible region.
“Sea plenty too muchee loly-poly,”
agreed Dam Li. “But s'pose China
boy haveum joss in pocket, sea no can
do nothing.”
“Have you two got a joss 2" I asked.
“Haveum plenty soon,” replied Dam
Li enigmatically, after which they were
both silent for a few moments. The
conversation was evidently not shap-
ing itself to their liking. They looked
several times from one to the other and
then at me until finally Dam Li pushed
Ah Sin forward in my direction.
“You talkee,” he said with unwonted
self-denial.
“China boy him clear out to-mollow,
he began as though telling me some-
thing new. “Plenty solly.”
Dam Li came to his rescue.
“China boy flighten' for hon’lable
officer, him forgettee poo' Dam Li an’
Ah Sin,” he explained. -
“No wantchee that,” continued All
Sin.
“You needn't worry,” I assured them.
“I shall certainly never forget you, and
I hope you won't forget me either.”
“No can do,” they asserted in unison.
“S'pose hon'lable officer givelum photo-
glaph,” they went on hastily, bringing
out the last word with evident pride at
their mastery of the English language.
“Photoglaph plenty good joss,” re-
marked Dam Lithoughtfully.
“Of course, I'll give you a photo if
you want one,” I began.
“Allee two both wantchee photo-
glaph,” said Ah Sin hastily.
“All right—two photos,” I amended
and went into the hut to fetch them.
While I was rummaging in my kit
I heard a slight sound and looked up to
find the two Chinamen standing close

to assist me in the search.
Ultimately the photos were discov-
ered, signed by me and presented with
due ceremony, and then we said good-
bye to one another with many protest-
ations of mutual esteem.
After I had seen them out of the camp
I went back to my hut. I saw my kit
strewn about the floor and a horrible
thought struck me.
“Good Lord!” I said to myself.
“Only a couple of photos. It's hardly

round and see what they've taken a
fancy to this time.” - -
I had a look and was immediately
ashamed. Nothing was missing. On
the contrary I found a pair of beautiful

matic pistol which had never been there
before.

“HELEN, old THING, YoUR HAIR 1 "
“HEaBERT DARLING, YoUR FACE '"
My FIRST FLIGHT.
STRANDED at Brighton and bored to monotony,
Sadly I roamed by the crowd-haunted shore;
Fed up with bathing and boating and botany,
Languidly humming the strains of “Asthore ”;
Then, in the offing, descended an aeroplane,
Gaily the pilot came striding my way;
“'Afternoon, Sir!” he exclaimed. “Would you dare
a 'plane
Voyage to-day?”
Turning, I gazed with an eye that was critical
At the contraption of fabric and wires;
Flying's a game which my friends in the City call
Simply gilt-edged—it uplifts and inspires.
Holiday-makers stood by in expectancy,
Cinema merchants rushed up with their reels;
“Go it!” cried somebody; “go an' get wrecked
an' see --
Just how it feels.”
I who had fought for a seat in an omnibus
Surely could never recoil from a 'plane?
There, newly painted, she stood like a Romney 'bus,
Bidding me soar through the vasty inane.
Breathing a prayer for myself and my Fatherland
Swiftly I scrambled aboard (the First Act);
Upward we soared till I felt I would rather land
Promptly-intact.
Swift rushed the air and the engine was thunderous;
“Say, shall I stunt you?” the pilot then roared.
Clouds were above us and Brighton was under us;
Peace reigned below—there was Panic on board.
Fiercely pulsated my turbulent heart inside,
Fiercely we skidded and stunted and swayed;
Grimly I crouched in that brute of a Martinsyde—
Dazed and dismayed.
Every mad moment seemed in its intensity
More than a cycle of slow-moving years;
Finally I, in a state of dumb density,
Reached terra firma mid hurricane cheers.
Since I've decided that nothing can justify
Passenger flights in a nerve-racking 'plane;
Others may welcome the sport, but I'm cussed if I
Try it again.
“In a few days we should learn the composition of the Ministry, if,
indeed, there are to be changes beyond the limitation of the Ministers
in the Cabinet to a doze or so.”—Provincial Paper.
The Government appears to be waking up at last.
“Major Patteson, who is in charge of the aeroplanes at Harrogate,
has made some 200 flights between Paris and London, and crossed the
Channel very often.”—Yorkshire Observer.
Yes, that is, we believe, the most popular route.
. The Westminster Gazette informs us that an American
war correspondent will shortly delight London with his
“illustrated travelogues.” If successful he will doubtless
be succeeded by a Californian cow-puncher with his illus-
trated cattleogues.
From a report of Sussex v. Lancashire:—
“Bowling much faster than he had done before luncheon Tyldesley
ought to have had Baker's wicket with the batsman's score at six,
Hallows missing a catch that came to him rather low in the lips. It
was not an expensive mistake.”—Daily Paper.
Still, the fieldsman was decidedly down in the mouth over it.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 4th.-The concur-
rence of Bank Holiday, fine weather
and a Marine Pageant on the Thames
did not deter Members from doing their
duty to their constituents. They turned
up punctually at a quarter to three, sat
through Questions and were listening
with rapt attention while Mr. Hogg|E
expounded the true inwardness of the
Scottish Estimates, until Mr.
SPEAKER, fearing the effect of so
much excitement, suggested an
adjournment to the Terrace for an
hour or so.
It is fortunate that as Chair-
man of the Great Northern Rail-
way Sir FREDERICK BANBURY is
thoroughly acquainted with the
block-system. But for his vigi-
lance the War Emergency Laws
(Continuance) Bill, under which
our liberties would be at the mercy
of D.O.R.A. for yet another year,
might have slipped through un-
opposed. But Sir FREDERICK,
putting down the signal, tempor-
arily shunted it into a siding.
A commendable vigilance re-
garding the administration of St.
Helena was displayed by Mr. T
JoyNsoN-HICRs. Colonel AMERY
might think it all right that the
Governor should be doing war-
work at home and that his deputy
should have only half-a-dozen
soldiers under his command, but
Mr. JoyNson-Hicks sees farther
into the future. At any moment
St. Helena may be called upon to
resume her historic rôle as an
imperial dungeon, and surely she
should be suitably equipped for
the purpose.
Convinced by the Mercantile
Marine Pageant—the last of the
Peace celebrations—that the War
is really over, Lord HALDANE sees
no further reason for concealing
his light under a bushel. As an
ex-Lord Chancellor, he comforted
Lord LovaT with the assurance
that it was quite permissible to make
a second-reading speech on going into
Committee. Next, as a squire of dames
he protested against the Government's
proposal to exclude women by Order in
Council from certain Imperial posts.
Finally, as an ex-War Secretary, he ob-
jected to the inclusion of the Militia
Acts in the Expiring Laws Continu-
ance Bill. If there is one thing on
which he prides himself it is the de-
struction of the old Constitutional force.
Still he does not want to be haunted
every year by its ghost. .
Tuesday, August 5th. –The Lords
continued their efforts to turn the Ways
and Communications Bill into some-
thing less of a “one-man show” than it
was when presented to them, and carried
against the Government an amendment
providing that the Minister's “advisory
council” should consist, not of Minis-
terial nominees, as had been intended,
but of the representatives of outside
bodies. The LoRD CHANCELLOR dis-
claimed the notion that the Minister
would be an irresponsible autocrat, and

incidentally showed that there are limits
to his own personal ambitions. He
resumed that so important an officer of
tate would be a Member of the Cabinet,
but hastened to add, “I shall not have
the forming of that Cabinet, and I do
not know.” -
Members were agreeably surprised
to hear from Mr. CHURCHILL that in
future education is to be regarded as
an integral part of Army training. So
perhaps the refrain of the old song,
“The Army's the very best school in
the nation,” may some day be more
than metaphorically true. Meantime
it is satisfactory to know that the sys-

tem of direct commissions from the
Universities (which gave us, among
other officers, one Douglas HAIG) is to
be resumed.
The Army of Occupation in Ireland
is costing the country close on a million
a month ; and never have Irish farmers
been more flourishing. No wonder
Sinn Fein is popular in the rural
districts.
Lord Robert CECIL must be amused
to see the way in which he is
hailed as the coming man in
newspapers which before the War
had never a good word for him or
his family. But he shows no
tendency to gain power by lean-
ing to the extreme Left, and this
afternoon he elicited from Mr.
BoNAR LAW a statement that the
“direct action" movement was
the negation of democracy and
would be resisted by the Govern-
ment with all the forces at their
disposal. -
Asked if he had called the PRIME
MINISTER's attention to the neces-
sity of cutting down unnecessary
expenditure, Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
= his hand on his heart, replied that
his right hon. friend was as zeal-
ous as himself for economy in
- every branch of the public service.
The value of this testimonial was,
message from the IXING, recom-
mending the grants of sums vary-
ing from £100,000 to £10,000 to
the victorious commanders and
organizers of victory by sea and
land. These are debts of honour
A which the Nation will gladly and
gratefully pay.
But when Mr. BonAR LAw,
later in the evening, invited the
House to pass the Second Read-
ing of the Ministries and Secre-
taries Bill, under which Minis-
terial salaries of two thousand
pounds are to be raised to five
thousand pounds, it was felt that
there was too glaring a discrepancy
between principles and practice. Mr.
LAw's engaging plea, that in this con-
nection “economy was irrelevant,”
failed to convince; and he only got his
Bill by promising that nothing more
should be heard of it till the Autumn.
Wednesday, August 6th.-If our Min-
isters have been somewhat tardy in
moving the Votes of Thanks to the
Forces, they atoned for the delay by
the eloquence with which they recom-
mended them. Lord CURzoN sought to
be excused, on the ground of recent
indisposition, if he ſailed to rise to the
full height of his majestic theme, but

the Peers who listened with delight to
his comprehensive and finely-phrased
review of the War could only wonder
what more he could have said, or how
he could have bettered its expression, if
he had been in robust health.
The lapidary art is not that branch
of oratory in which the present Prime
Minister most particularly excels. But
if his compliments to individuals did
not rise much above the commonplace,
his story of how the British nation—in
1914 “the most unwarlike people in
Europe”—braced and equipped itself
for the long struggle and eventually
emerged victorious, was thrillingly told.
The Votes of Thanks were passed
nemine contradicente, but there was a
certain amount of opposition to the
monetary grants for the naval and mili-
tary commanders. Mr. ADAMSoN, on
behalf of the Labour Party, moved
to reduce them from £580,000 to
£200,000, and received a rather
surprising volume of heterogen-
eous support. But the Votes were
carried by 272 to 64. -
Then the House had a lively
hour or two over the Welsh Church
(Temporalities) Bill. As the re-
sult of the War the value of tithe
has risen so greatly that the Welsh
municipalities, instead of profiting 4
by the disendowment of the Church
in Wales, are threatened with bank-
ruptcy. So they are to be relieved
at the expense of the long-suffering
taxpayer. The debate was chiefly
remarkable for a concerted attack
by the brothers CECIL on Mr.
BoNAR LAw for his alleged per-
fidy in accepting as a fait ac-
compli an Act which he had
promised to repeal. The culprit's de-
fence was that as a Coalitionist Minister
he was not bound by his promises as a
Unionist leader of the Opposition; and
this plea, backed by a testimonial from
the Bishop of ST. ASAPH, was so con-
vincing that only 37 Members went
into the Cecilian lobby.
An announcement that leathern
gloves may now be imported from
Germany has caused dismay, among
Tariff Reformers, who fear that the
Government have forgotten the intimate
connection between these articles and
the Hidden Hand.
Thursday, August 7th.--The sudden
introduction of a Profiteering Bill is by
no means popular with Members, chiefly
because it will oblige them to postpone
their holidays. Sir FREDERICK BAN-
BURY advanced another objection to it
in the fact that the word “profiteering ”
does not yet appear in the dictionary,
and urged that the title should be
brought into conformity with the Eng-
lish language. Presumably he would
like “The Forestalling, Engrossing and
Regrating Bill.” The use of these
ancient terms would, at any rate, remind
people that “profiteering” is not a vice
peculiar to the twentieth century and
that previous legislative attempts to ex-
tirpate it have not been conspicuously
successful.
The debate on the Consolidated
Fund Bill was chiefly remarkable for
the fact that the PRIME MINISTER took
part in it. This is the third time this
week that he has been in the House of
Commons—a place that latterly he has
been supposed to cherish in the spirit
of the man who liked Glasgow because
there were “such grand facilities for
getting away from it.” Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE was careful, however, to ex-
plain that this week's assiduity must
not be regarded as a precedent, and
that in the future, as in the past, his

visits would probably be of an angelic
character.
He is entirely in sympathy with his
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in
the course of a most gloomy oration,
showing that his Budget estimates had
been all knocked sideways, remarked
that if they were to give Ministers six
weeks' holiday and then six weeks for
thought the national business would
be better done.
A propos of the German indemnities:
“Is it not the considered judgment of our
best financial experts that if the Allies get
200 thousand millions over a long course of
years they will be very lucky?”
Westminster Gazette.
The answer is in the affirmative.
From a feuilleton :-
“And the fragrance of bog-myrtle, wild
thyme and the sea-anemone rose to the senses
like a sweet marcotic.”
Well, there's no accounting for tastes,
but personally we prefer that the ane-
mone should come from the wood.
THE LATEST GOLF RECORDS.
According to The Pall Mall Gazette
of August 6th Mr.G.Sc.BURy of Finchley
caught a swallow-tail butterfly on the
Wembley golf course on the previous
Saturday. The event, in view of the
scene of the capture, seems to him
worthy of record. We agree; but should
like to point out with all respect that
Wembley does not enjoy a monopoly of
these interesting experiences. º
For example, the Weekly Bulletin of
the North Boreland Golf Club describes
how Mr. Norman Stunter, the captain
of the club, while recently approaching
the sixth green, struck and temporarily
stunned a fine capercailzie which had
inadvertently perched on the pin. The
bird on its recovery struggled des-
perately to escape, but was finally over-
powered and despatched in a motor-
car to Mr. Stunter's moor in Inver.
ness-shire, where it is doing as well
as could be expected.
Curiously enough, on the same
day another member of the North
Boreland Golf Club discovered a
huge slow-worm in a comatose con-
dition in his locker. The reptile,
having been revived with sloe-gin,
executed a quick march into the
sand-hills and disappeared.
Even more startling was the ex-
perience vouchsafied to Mr. Ivor
Jenkins, the famous Broadstairs
plusser, two days later, when, on
reaching the crater hole, he dis-
covered a lion cub, which had es-
caped from a travelling menagerie,
lying asleep on the green. Mr.
Jenkins, who is a man of iron con-
stitution, telegraphed to the chief
constable, and with the aid of the police
succeeded in driving the animal off the
course into the grounds of an adjoining
Christian Science infant school.
Lastly, there remains the gallant
exploit of Sir Silas Slazenger, K.B.E.,
who, while sitting outside the club.
house after lunch, caught a Purple
Emperor in his twenty-guinea Panama
hat. The insect has been duly for-
warded by aeroplane to the head-
quarters of the League of Nations for
examination and internment.
“On Saturday evening last there was a re-
cord audience around the Band Stand to listen
to the instrumentalisation and vocalisation of
this celebrated Concert Party, every chair being
occupied by between 600 and 700 people.”
A “record '' indeed.
“Mr. —, B.A., intends to Open a Pre-
paratory School at ‘The Birches,” , On
September 19th, 1919, to Prepare Boys for the
Public Schools, Navy, etc.”—Scottish Paper.
“What's in a name?”—yet it sounds
rather ominous.

Foggy weather yesterday favoured

The dislodgment ceremony was per-
formed by the Right Hon. the Lord
GEDDEs of ERRICK, who as late Chair-
man of the North-Eastern Railway is
also, as is generally known, ex-officio
President of the Ways and Communi-
cations Ministry.
Owing to the existence of some local
disaffection it was found necessary to
post a strong force of railway police, and
these, together with a group of North-
Eastern Railway directors and other
officials of the company, made up an
appreciative if not very large audience.
Having skilfully dislodged the stone
the noble lord, in response to the sound
of loud cheers and fog-signals, said that
it gave him the very greatest pleasure
thus to initiate the suppression of the
iniquitous system of English roads with
which the nation had been so long
cursed. By thus discouraging the use
of these highways, continued the noble
lord, speaking with considerable emo-
tion, they would be removing from the
public a great temptation to disloyalty
—disloyalty to the railways to which
the ceremony of pulling up the first

were now going to owe so much more
—much more than they could ever hope
to pay. He had the greatest pleasure
in declaring the milestone well and
truly pulled up. (Loud and prolonged

A CONFESSION.
CoNscience makes cowards of us all,
and after four years of secret suffering
which I can no longer bear I have
decided to confess all and go and live
in a neutral country.
I will not mince matters. For four
years and a half I have sheltered an
enemy alien, one Ludwig of Munich.
I brought him with me from Munich
in 1913, and it would be idle to pretend
that our acquaintance ripened into any.
thing less than deep affection. That
he ever had any German sympathies I
shall always deny, and he will remain
for ever in my memory as a paragon
of gentility.
Ludwig, I may mention en passant,
was a Dachshund, who first attracted
my attention in Munich by his ingen-
uity in defending his dinner against
hungry rivals, which he did by forming
but I found it too dangerous and decided
to confine him to the house, giving it
out to the world that I had despatched
him.
The result was electrical ; Surbiton
smiled upon me once more, and for four
years this deception was kept up. I
found it difficult to look people straight
in the face and developed a hunted feel-
ing, as if I were always under the eye
of the police or the secret service.
The long period of sedentary living
told upon Ludwig, who put on flesh to
such a degree that towards the close
of the War his legs became quite use-
less, as they simply did not reach the
ground. The employment of Swedish
movements proved quite ineffective and
Ludwig was compelled to remain in bed.
On returning home on the day of the
proclamation of Armistice I rushed into
Ludwig's room to tell him, the news.
His face lit up, but the supreme effort

Are robbed of their dearest delight.

Be found in those marvellous

Ludwig from nose to tail,
he offered to sell him for
five marks an inch, and so
he returned to England
with me. -
Ludwig quickly settled
down in this country and
made many friends, having
little difficulty in picking up
the English bark and adapt-
ing himself to our customs;
but less than a year after
his arrival war was declared

ON Victory night the lads of our
village dragged a tarry old pilchard-boat
to the top of the headland and set it
afire. Full royally did it blaze. The
moor-men on the heights of Carn Pol-
Dhu saw it and made answer by setting
the furze alight. The graziers of Pen-
haze, not to be outdone in patriotism,
touched a match to their landlord's
hay-stacks. All along the backbone of
the Delectable Duchy leapt points of fire.
Climbing our headland at 11:15 of
that joyous night, I saw those ancient
mariners, Captain Amos Jago and Uncle
Billy John Polsue, the centre of an
admiring school of small-fry, dancing
round the flaming ribs of the pilchard-
boat and chanting “Rule, Britannia.”
Seeing that their combined ages
totalled a century and a quarter, that
they were wearing sea-boots, and that
they had been toiling to unload the
freight of the “Ship Inn” for six con-
secutive hours, it was a very creditable
performance, I thought.
At 12.45 I met the corps de ballet
half-way down the cliff-path, homeward
bound.
Captain Amos Jago was sitting on
the path, his broad back lodged against
a boulder, engaged in a hopeless attempt
to strike a light for his empty pipe with
the miss-fire end of a match. On the
lee-side of him lay Unclé Billy John,
taking his rest at full-length, his snores
crashing like fog - signals. “Total
wreck, 'e is, the gert ole good-for-
nawthin’,” grunted the Captain, re-
ferring to his dancing partner. “Well,
what's the odds? “Peace do come but
wance a year,’ as the sayin' is—naw,
that 's Christmas, edden it 2 " he cor-
rected. “Naw matter, wadever a is a
doan come offen, an’ if me an' Billy
John 'ere, what done fower year coast-
watchin', wet or fine, edden entitled
to our orderly an' legitimate rejoice-
ments no man edden, no man.”
I said I was sure of it. The Captain
nodded vigorously. “Yessir, we done
our bit as good as the rest, wet or fine,
an' now—well, a drop of drink in season
an' in reason doan do a man no 'arm,
do et 2" I said I thought it might even
do good. The Captain agreed. “Yes,
it might even do good—a power o' good.
Why, dang et all, look at Billy John
"ere—did 'im a hundred pounds' worth
o' good, didn't et 2 A hundred pounds
an' a letter of 'preciation from the
Admiralty.”
“Did it 2 " I asked. The Captain
snorted, “Of course et did. Didn't you
never heard tell on how Billy John
winned the hundred pound, then 2 Sit
down to wance while I tell on et, for
'tis a brea mazin' yarn. Sit down to
wance.” I squatted obediently.
“Happened all along of a wreck we
'ad 'ere last July twelve-month. Coast-
guard called down wan evenin' to say
there was a barque makin' poor weather

o'clock, up goes two red rockets to the
nor'-west. Lifeboat put out, but 'arf-
way 'cross the Bay she met a long-boat
comin' in with fowerteen poor souls an'
wan ole black nigger aboard. Their
barque had struck on the western edge
of the Seven Sisters reef, they said, an'
was goin' to pieces fast. Next mornin,'
sure 'nough, there wadden a thing to be
seed of 'er, nawthin' but a scatter of
sticks rollin' in on the tide—wooden

for two days, waitin' to see would any
of their belongings come ashore, then
drove off to P'nzance in a waggonette,
black nigger an' all. The gale had
blawed itself clane out by then, but
there was a brea drift of fog about,

'er kits, so 'e didn't 'ave no trouble in
makin' a landin’ at all. ’B hitched the
dinghy to a nobble o'rock, where she'd
float, an’ went pokin' an' pryin' over
the reef for what 'e could find. Wadden
much 'e did find ayther, for all 'is
cunnin.' By the end o' some hours all
'e'd got were about thirty fathom of
rope 'e'd cut off spars, a block or two,
a couple o' canvas buckets, a bird-cage
wid a dead canary in it an’wan old say-
boot. Then, just when he'd give et up
as a bad job an' was for pushin' off home,
he spied a lil' keg jammed in a crack o'
the rocks. 'E worked et loose, prised
the bung out wid 'is marlin-spike an'
set 'is nose to et. It were rum, good
rum, the very best. The smell of et rose
up through the bung strong as death
an' gave ole Billy's nose a tweak that
bringed tears to his eyes. Beautiful
stench et'ad, warm an' powerful. "E put
'is mouth to the bung an' drawed off a
valyant sup of et, once, twice an' again—
thought et would maybe charm 'is stum-
mick, he said, 'im being all scat abroad
wid chronicle indegestion. Must 'ave
misjudged the strength of the stuff or
opened 'is throat too wide or somethin,'
for next thing 'e knawed was that 'e was
lyin' on 'is back in a puddle o' water,
the keg upside down beside'im an' it was
full moonlight. Sleepin' drunk to the
world 'e'd been for six mortal hours.
Old Billy sat up an' clung to 'is'ead with
both 'ands. The Sisters was rockin'
under 'im as if they was afloat. 'E could
'ear the say lickin' round the reef like
as if et were laughin,' an' away to the
southard the red lantern of the Long-
ships Light'ouse winked at en like a
blood-shot eye.
“Old Billy thought the sickness of
death was upon 'im sure 'nough, an’
'im a sinful man. 'E was considerin'
'pon castin' 'isself into the ocean an'
endin' 'is misery there and then, when
all of a sudden, not seventy fathoms
inshore of the Sisters, 'e seed the water
bubble an' eave an' up comes a gert
creature big as a whale an' bigger.
For the first instant Billy thought et
was a whale; then he thought no, it
were too long, must be the say-serpint;
then 'e knawed what et were. ‘Oh,
my dear life an' soul, 'tis a German
submarine !’ says'o, 'an' flattened 'isself
out in the pool as flat as 'e could an'
pulled the sayweed all over 'im. 'E
could see the submarine as plain as
I can see you now, lying like a black
rock right across the moonlight. 'E
seed or 'atch open an' a brace o' foreign
chaps come out an' stand about on
'cr conning-tower laughin' an' talkin'.
Now an’ again wan o' them would put
up a pair o' might-glasses an' look
away towards the Longships passage.
Old Billy, lyin' there under the weed,
like a pig in a dung-heap, seed what
their game was. They were waitin'
on one of our convoys goin' up the
Bristol Channel; waitin' lyin' on the
sand-bottom 'tween the Sisters an' the
shore, where nobody would think o'
lookin' for 'em. They'd come up now
to fill air-tanks, never thinkin' o' that
fat ole weasel, Billy John Polsue, lyin'
drunk out on the reef. For three
mortal hours she lay there pumpin',
an' for three mortal hours ole Billy lay
in the pool shivering like a wet cat,
darin' hardly to breathe. Then the
Germans closed the 'atch an' she went
under. Billy gave 'er a quarter-hour
to get settled, then jumped in 'is dinghy
and pulled for dear life, not for the
Cove, but straight ashore. He ripped
the bottom out of the dinghy, beachin'
'er on the boulders below the Cape, an'
tore the knees out of 'is pants scram-
blin' up the cliff. When 'e got into
the coast-guard station at Penhair 'e
was more dead than alive, an' they 'ad
to 'most drown 'im in brandy before
they could get mouth-speech out of en.
But when 'e did speak they jumped to
the telephone an’’ad the Naval Com-
mander in P’nzance out of bed in 'is
night-shirt runnin' about like a mad
dog.” -
#And did they scupper her?” I
asked.
The Captain rose unsteadily to his
feet and yawned loudly. “Scupper 'er,
yes. They 'ad a fleet o' patrol-boats
round before dawn droppin’ enough
depth charges to blow the bottom out
of the say. An' where do you think
that ole toad, Billy John Polsue, was
while they was doin' of et?”
“Bed 2 ” I ventured. -
The Captain cackled. “Bed Not
'e. Why, baling in the dead fish what
floated up. Loaded a gig-ful, 'e did,
an' swamped the market.”
He placed a weighty sea-boot on the
thickest portion of the recumbent op-
portunist and pressed.

In the way to win from original sin
To ultimate enterprise;
In Arkansaw by the strength of my jaw,
In Illinois by craft,

Where only the chained can stand,
And plucked from the fire of Western

I am the kitten that hands the mitten
To the brewers of beer;
On velvet feet I creep to cheat

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE name of SACHA GREGORY is, I think, new to me; but
if this means that his book, Yellowleaf (HEINEMANN), is a
first novel, it is certainly one of unusually matured power.
Mr. GREGoRY seems to be a born tale-teller. His plot here
is largely a matter of atmosphere; and from the opening
pages of the story the atmosphere of Yellowleaf, the big
retired house in St. John's Wood that is its setting, is
very highly charged . . . I greatly wish that I could sug-
gest to you the quality of the intrigue without a premature
revelation of its course. Briefly, we have this house filled
with charming people: old Lady Mary, who owned it, her
widowed stepdaughter, Lily, her two grandchildren, her
nephew Charles, who loved Lily, and her ancient butler,
who loved them all. This was the Yellowleaf circle before
the breaking in upon it of Aghassy, the piano-playing genius
who married Lily and brought such unpleasant happenings
to the house. In some ways Aghassy himself is the most
skilfully-drawn figure in the group. . His apparent kind-
liness, his plausibility and general absence of melodrama
come so near disarming suspicion that the gradual realisa-
tion of just what sinister business is behind it all gains
monstrously in emotional effect. Perhaps you will close
the book with a grateful conviction that, as the man says
in the play, “people don't do such things;” but this, I
fancy, will hardly affect your interest in a clever, creepy
and very well-written story.
Before the wisdom of elders destroyed the nice distinction
I believed that “narrative "was that explanatory streak
in books which comes in between and as it were prepares
the way for the story bits. If I still might to that extent
emulate LEwis CARRoDL's Humpty-Dumpty and order the
words about I should like to say that Lady CHARNwooD's
book, The Dean (CoNSTABLE), has lots of very interesting
narrative in it, but that, however eagerly you scurry along
looking for it, you will never find the story. It always
seems to be getting ready to begin, but it never does. You
are told many things of births, deaths, marriages, dinners,
dances, inheritings and disinheritings, but you never feel
them happening; yet, because the people concerned are so
real and many of them, in a nice, human, possible way, so
fine, you will be ready to forgive the disappointment of
finding that there wasn't any very urgent reason for telling
you about them at all. , Lady CHARNwood can draw people
—draws too, I think, in what art students call the “life
class”—and it is just possible that her fidelity to her models,
to what she knows of them in private life, has prevented
her from infusing any sense of action into their imaginary
history. The Dean himself, an ordinary high - minded
clever impatient man, and his delightful wife, who would
tell him things about his own family which he must have
known as well as she did, just because she wanted me
to know too, are people whom it has been delightful to
meet, although it has cost me some effort from time to
time to sort out all their family connections, whose rela-
tionships both they and Lady CHARNWooD seemed to
expect me to remember.
To those of us who are not afraid of technical details,
Under the Periscope (CoLLINs) should prove as intriguing as
its title. Lieutenant MARK BENNET, R.N.R., intends here
to tell us all about a particular class of submarine, and
scrupulously he carries out his intention. After reading

egoist whom she marries, and a couple of bad-hats, genuine
his book I feel that there is no excuse for ignorance about
under-water craft, but all the same there is such an ap-
palling lot to learn that my admiration for those men who
go under the sea in ships has, if possible, increased. Let
me, however, hasten to say that Lieutenant BENNET is
not only an instructor of the ignorant. “The incidents
recorded,” he writes, “are all founded on fact, and many of
them are personal experiences.” And to this I can truly
add that most of the selected incidents have a thrill in them.
This is a shortish book and some of the pages in my copy
are absolutely blank, but even in its shorn condition I
recommend it to everyone who wants an answer to the
question, “What does it feel like to be below the sea?”
Mr. IAN Colvin candidly asserts with Marshal voN
HINDENBURG and Mr. BottomLEY that all this talk of
Leagues of Nations is sheer fudge—dangerous because
plausible. There will be none of this nonsense if he can help
it! The Safety of the Nation (MURRAY) depends on its
industries, and commerce is safe only if it helps the essential
industries. Wealth is not wealth if there be not security.
wrong'uns, of a type (certainly not fish-like!) that I must
believe Miss HINE to suppose more common than the facts
warrant. It is, I fancy, part of her scheme to emphasise
the “passion ” of Sheila's wooers; the result being that the
universe appeared to that bewildered lady as pervaded
either by men whose behaviour scared her into justified
hysterics, or (in the exceptional case of her husband) bored
her to tears. Incidentally, you may observe already that
The Hidden Valley is in no sense a war-book; man-shortage
at least was never among Sheila's trials. On the positive
side it might be called a number of things, according to the
taste and fancy of the individual reader; but certainly
neither dull nor badly written. From which indication
you may judge whether you are more like to be repelled
or entertained, and can take action accordingly.
Mr. KENELM Foss has a lot to learn in the art of con-
structing a novel. Indeed his arrangement of the nine
chapters of Till our Ship comes in (GRANT RICHARDs) is
astoundingly capricious, and I put it to him that a court-
ship is unnecessarily handicapped in the telling when one

by a people that stops
its ears against syren-
voices, whether of
money-grabbers (that is
Free Traders and other
profiteers) or idealists,
and realises that War
is War and inevitable ;
that moreover Peace is
War, and Trade as be-
tween nations is not a
mutual accommodation
but a desperate conflict,
in which it is right to
use every device of
diplomacy, every re-
source of power, to out-
wit the enemy. The
Germans in fact were
on the right lines be-
MAID-OF-ALL-WORK,
knows that the ensuing
marriage resulted in
an everlasting struggle
against poverty. Mr.
Foss derives some sen-
timental humour from
the situations he
creates, but in essen-
tials his battle of the
Fosters to feed and
clothe their numerous
progeny is a dreary
affair; and I wonder if
any father of a family
could be as feckless as
Herbert Foster and still
retain an atom of self-
respect. The greatest
humourist alive would
be hard - pressed to
squeeze many smiles
from such a poverty-
fore the Great War. Now nobody can dismiss this all
with a wave of the hand merely because it is unpleasant.
It represents the up-to-date stone age point of view, which
has never yet been disproved, and it logically accounts for
all Mr. Colvin's deductions and obiter dicta, which would
otherwise be rather startling; e.g., “The true ideal of a
national education is the better service of the industries by
which the nation lives.” Mr. Colvin (despite his scorn of
other brands) is an idealist of the extremist will-to-power
school and a passionate anti-huckster. And, as I say, he
may be right, In fact, if he gets enough people to believe
him, he is right. An interesting, cocksure, learnedly docu-
mented, biassed and depressing book.
al
On the analogy of the man who called himself a constant
lover because he was always in love with somebody, Sheila,
heroine of Miss MURIEL HINE’s latest novel, The Hidden
Valley (LANE), might be held a conspicuous example of the
constantly loved. You never met a girl with such a pro-
cession of pretenders to her heart. If, however, you deduce
from this that the tale is going to be yet one more comedy
of courtship, you miss your guess. For one thing, poor
Sheila was not fortunate; despite the multitude of her
chances she had rank bad luck in her percentage of im-
possibles—including in this category both the fish-blooded
stricken theme as this ; but I can truthfully say that Mr.
Foss squeezed with great energy. Mr. H. M. BRock has
supplied some charming illustrations. -
There are eleven stories and sketches bound together in
Home Fires in France (CoNSTABLE), and in spite of Miss
Dorothy CANFIELD's reputation as a novelist, and although
she has nowhere vouched for their truth, I am not at all
convinced that she would like me to regard them as fiction.
In half of them her point of view is that of an American in
France during the War—and both her own countrymen
and mine should thank her for exhibiting it after such a
fashion—the others might have been written by an au-
thoress of either of the allied nationalities who possessed a
sympathy never maudlin and a tenderness never merely
saccharine. Miss CANFIELD has not strained her facts to
bring about that air of completeness which fiction has
taught us to expect. I feel quite sure that the men and
women in her pages went on living for chapters more after
she had written her last word about them—and I do not
remember that any of them married each other. This is
not the way of the novelist. Yet all the romance of
courage and kindness and patient effort and heroic faith is
here, with a trust in the goodness of human nature so
sincere and unconscious as to be an additional argument
in its own favour. -

The world is a different place for a number of people now
that we have a “Marshal of the Air.” The title so affected

himself “Emperor of the Sahara " that he upset a Sunday
morning breakfast in a spasm of hilarity, and the youngest,
still in the Air Force, threatened to illuminate his “wings”
with electricity after sunset.
Happy as I am about the new titular styles, I cannot but
grieve over certain omissions. Of course one must know
what they call fellows who command Groups and Wings
and Flights and so forth, but, as I said when I was an
Equipment Officer, they are not the only fellows on earth,
even when they are on earth. What of us others—the

thing, and the uniform which is to succeed the next uniform
for another, and the small fry are expected to be patient.
We are doing our best, and it is a good best, for mental
resignation is a custom and habit with all those who draw
allowances. But, be there any amongst us gifted with
imagination, let him come forward and indicate the momen-
clature of his choice.

awe of her, and she was of opinion that, as we were all
“temporary gentlemen,” we must have come from Clapham.
(Some of us did.) The majesty of her bearing and the
aloofness of her mien (here was one who really had a mien)
made a deep impression on me, and if only for association's
sake I would propose that the head of the Woman's Royal
Air Force be styled, in all documents, writs and tenancy
agreements, IMPERATRIX of THE ETHER.
There" is a tenderness in most ex-R.A.F. hearts for the
W.R.A.F. cooks. While all ranks deserve a sonorous
appellation, I will content myself for the present in dealing
with their case only. VESTALs or Victualling they shall
be. So let it be promulgated.
There is sure to be a good deal of bickering over the
Chaplains. My submission is “First, second and third
class, AUGURs of THE EMPyREAN; ” but the Bishops will
probably think of something loſtier. The Quarter-master
does not fly; let him be QUAEstoR of THE LEver. Doc-
tors, we are told, must fly; let them be ICARIANs of THE
BLACK, DRAUGHTs. The Paymaster, on the other hand,
might be CHIEF SATRAP or OverDRAUGHTs, while our old
friend the Administration Officer—
I was one –or, as my Colonel would have it, an adum-
bration of one. I, who in private life before the War did
not know the average price of potatoes, was entrusted with
the spending of tens of thousands of pounds on vegetables,
loose-leaf note-books and linoleum. I also had a shop and
sold puttees and lawn-tennis balls. I was the most actively
emergetic officer in my wing, spending twenty-three hours
out of each working day on my feet. Because of this I was
allowed but twenty pounds outfit allowance, instead of
the usual fifty, my work being classed as sedentary. By
way of revenge I stole two pairs of boots from the wing
shop. (See Report of Select Committee on Air Force
Waste, p. 932, Ch. 184, vol. 337.)
In addition to all this work (buying, selling and scroung-
ing) I was an authority on clothing, particularly tunics and
breeches. Indeed even in those days I called myself the
TUNic TETRARCH. And it is this appellation I would bestow
officially on the latter-day A.O. But I am conscious that
it falls short somewhere. It doesn't cover enough of the
ground. Most certainly potatoes should come in, as the
A.O. buys so many; and I should like, if possible, another
alliteration. I have it ! Is not the A.O. a comforter, and
is not the food he buys a comfort? Very well, then. In
all wedding licences, deed-polls, ration-books and promis-
sory notes let the Administration Officer of the R.A.F. be
known as TUNIC TETRARCH AND Por ATO PARACLETE.
The ground is not all covered, but dread of the charge of
presumption restrains me. If my preliminary proposals
find favour, perhaps I may hope for employment at the Air
Ministry (having been demobilised for seven months and
demonetised for five). Does the Air Council need a Press
agent 2 It does not appear so, but in the event of the office
being unfilled I beg to offer my services. I make one stipu-
lation—in regard to the manner of my styling;
CHIEF Exi PURPLER or THE Azu RE
is my present idea.

THE WINKLERS.
NoTwiTHSTANDING the appointment
of an expensive sports officer, capable
of calculating batting averages to three
places of decimals and of organizing
teams and quoting authorities at a
moment's notice for any game, from
snatch-cork to throwing the discus, the
favourite amusements of our troops
consist of directing concentrated or
converging fire with stones at tins on
the beach, or tracking down shellfish.
Woe betide the derelict biscuit-tin that
seeks temporary refuge on our plage.
The artillery bombard it with boulders,
machine-gunners riddle it with pebbles,
and snipers camouflage themselves be-
hind seaweed and scientifically snick
off bits of solder. As for the mussels
and winkles of the locality, it must be
assumed that all other residential quar-
ters are sadly overcrowded, or that they
possess stouter hearts than what they
are popularly credited with.
In the daily count of casualties wink-
les appear to figure more largely than
other molluscs. No doubt this is due
to the pleasure experienced by the ex-
pert winkler in dexterously harpooning
the fish with a pin and giving it the
right rotary twist that reveals it to the
world.
At all events the M.O. has been ex-
tremely busy coping with an epidemic
of Winklers' Wrist, which is akin to
Tennis Elbow, but with a slightly dif-
ferent action.
Our most stout-hearted and resolute
hunter is Elfred Fry, who combines
with his more serious vocation the
duties of batman to Percival. Elfred
tracks winkles with a relentless zeal
that has several times brought him into
active collision with the good people
of Quelquepart-sur-Mer, who consider
that he oversteps the bounds of sports-
manship. They don't mind amateur
collecting, but Elfred's professional
methods arouse their wrath. Hence
fluent expostulation on their part, which
Elfred receives with silent contempt,
thereby diplomatically concealing the
fact that he is unequal to them in
argument.
Elfred's propensity is also a source of
trouble to Percival.
“It isn't so much that I mind him
disappearing with the shaving water,
and only reappearing with the bedroom
candles,” said he, “but he is making my
quarters look like a salvage dump with
empty shells. I've got a search party
out for him now. Expect they'll find
him, disguised as a boulder, trying to
persuade limpets to cling to him.”
When Elfred reported himself, hav-
ing been discovered dabbling in a limpid
sea-pool, the pockets of his tunic were
suspiciously bulging.
“Where have you been 2" asked
Percival sternly.
“Looking at the sunset on the beach,
Sir,” replied Elfred unblushingly. -
“Well, in future you'll jolly well let
the sun set without your assistance.
You seem to think the sun is more im-
portant than your duties. Wait there
while I finish this letter.”
Elfred adjusted his feet for waiting,
and hoped that a neglected hole in his
tunic pocket would not let him down.
But it was a vain hope. Something
clattered on the floor and rolled away
into a corner.
“What's that ?” exclaimed Percival
irritably.
“Think a button 'as dropped off my
tunic,” said Elfred, breathing hard.
Percival plunged once more into the
throes of composition, and for a few
minutes all was quiet. Then the silence
was again broken in two distinct places.

“How do you think I can write letters
while you stand there shedding buttons
like a laundry 2” cried Percival, with
heat. “Go outside and shake yourself.”
Elfred turned obediently, but as he
did so a cascade of winkles poured from
his pocket and distributed themselves
over the floor.
“That's done it !” said Percival
grimly. “If ever you venture within
a hundred yards of my quarters with a
shell-fish in your possession I'll have
'you returned to duty tout de suite.”
For a few days Elfred kept away
from the beach, but the winkle lust led
him on the trail again. Relations be-
tween him and the fisher-folk once
more became strained on a question of
jumped claim, and a complaint was
made to the Maire, who referred it to
Percival's C.O. Percival, who was re-
freshing his jaded intellect with a game
of tennis, was sent for post haste.
He rushed to his quarters to assume
-garments fitting for a military inter-
view, and almost surprised Elfred, who
had just returned from the chaseand had
deposited the spoils, tied in a khaki hand-
kerchief, on a locker. Elfred had only
time to drop the hanky and its contents
into the pocket of one of Percival's
tunics and organise a look of innocent
virtue before his master entered.
“Give me some clothes, quick!"
panted Percival, and he was dressed
and gone before. Elfred had time to
realize that he had taken the tunic
which contained the product of an after-
noon's successful sport.
On the occasions when the C.O. was
really cross his reproaches, as Percival
well knew, could be as white-hot rods,
and this time he appeared to be right on
top of his form. Percival bowed his
head and waited for the strokes to fall.
“I’ve sent for you,” said the C.O.,
“on account of a complaint I've re-
ceived about that confounded servant
of yours. Apparently you have no
control over him. Your capability of
enforcing discipline, etc.—”
This was merely the breeze that
heralded the storm. Soon thunder-
bolts of wrath began to drop with
unerring accuracy on Percival's head,
and vivid lightning danced across his
eyes. Beads of perspiration broke out
on his forehead, and he groped in his
pocket for a handkerchief to wipe them
away. His fingers closed round some-
thing, which he dragged out, and the
next moment both he and the C.O.
were taking cover from a tempestuous
shower of winkles. . . . .
In next day's orders the following
announcement appeared :—
“It is notified for the information of
ALL RANKs that the collecting of
shell-fish is forbidden, and must cease.”

BELINDA'S BAKING.
MoRE than once I have complimented Belinda on her
cooking. Her mint-sauce is admirable, and since I gave
her a wrist-watch she has been able to boil an egg with
anyone.
But when she announced the other morning that circum-
stances would compel her to make bread that day I was
greatly moved. Still I went on with my breakfast as if
nothing had happened, and, excepting that perhaps I ate a
slice or two less than usual, I did not betray any agitation.
During the morning I looked into the kitchen for some
matches. Belinda, all apron and anxiety, was leading a
floury existence. I did not stay long; she was not in a
mood for conversation, and the moist mess in the yellow
basin on the table was not pleasant to look upon. Besides,
Belinda is not at her best with flour on her nose. So I
returned to my room, muttering curses on the bakers who
had brought about this state of things.
We had lunch under a cloud. Belinda was like a young
mother whose baby had been left in the garden while a
thunderstorm was brewing. Five times she left the table
to go and look into the kitchen oven, returning little, if any,
less concerned than when she went. I had the gravest ap-
prehensions as to what the outcome of the business might be.
Reader, do you remember the really large grey pieces of

cellent. -

THE ATTACHE.
THE Colonel's nib, the Major's pen
I cleaned to a lovely shine;
They came each day to work at ten,
I gladly came at nine;
Chuprassis watched me all agape
Tying their cases into shape,
That ne'er a memo. should escape,
With faultless bows of showy tape
The colour of port wine.
The walls were once a sorry show,
For no one in their annals
Had ever dreamt that “Q” could flow
In decorative channels;
But I made graphs and hung on hooks
Statistics from a hundred books
Of miles and minutes, carts and cooks,
Which now relieve the ugly looks
Of all the vacant panels.
Each day at noon the office shut
And others went to munch ; -
‘Twas then I cracked work's hardest
nut
And made a mental lunch ;
And when his glass of port was quaffed
The Major came and read the draft
I'd polished with such careful craft,
And made some jokes (at which I
laughed
And called them fit for Punch).
Days grew to weeks and weeks to years
And still I cleaned that pen,
And, when I soiled it with my tears,
I cleaned it up again;
The clerks below were full of wiles,
So I'd be sent a dozen miles
To fetch and carry heavy files,
Piles and piles and piles and piles—
I was a young man then.
Alas! my hair is silvered o'er;
My youth has lost its spice;
I've ceased to hanker any more
For tabs or crowns or pice;
Half-dreaming, half-awake, afar
I gaze across the troubled bar
And, taking brasso from the jar,
Clean up the solitary star
I'll wear in Paradise.

THE NEW PERIL.
A KINDLY Post-Office has embellished
the latest edition of The Telephone
Directory with a quaint series of in-

at the top of each page. These, while

desire to assist the public (who are
apparently regarded as more or less
half-witted) to a clearer understanding
of the mentality of the telephone oper.

the present practice of hurling the in-
strument through the window; while
the injunction to “pronounce the ‘i’
long in “nine’” must inevitably cause
distress to those sticklers for correct
English who have hitherto pronounced
it short.
The list of such instructions, though
enormous, is by no means complete, and
several more proverbs or mottoes could
be reasonably added. “Allow three
days for trunk calls to materialise" and
“Why telephone at all? A letter saves
time,” are obvious omissions.
Despite the value of this new depar-
ture on the part of Authority there lies
therein a hidden danger, which must
nevertheless be plain to all thinking
men. What if this craze for offering
gratuitous advice should prove contagi-
ous, involving in time all the most cher-
ished of our standard works 2 To be
asked, say, by Bradshaw, to “Be sure,
before selecting a train, that you really
wish to travel,” or to be advised to
“Read always from left to right,” might
well pall in time upon the most enthu-

readily imagine the distress that would
be caused if [Who's Who, succumbing to
the fever, informed us that “The pages
are arranged in numerical order,” or if
The Post Office Directory published the
warning, “Be careful. Your friends
may have moved.”
And so on. The prospect is limitless,
and one to strike fear into the stoutest
heart; only the exertion of considerable
will-power by the habitual readers of
such publications can hope to overcome
the menace of this national danger.

THE CINEMA HABIT.
ScENE.—The Interior of a Picture Theatre.
The spectators at this particular house—and at some others,
for that matter—are not easily roused to express emotion
or even interest. The eleventh-hour rescue of the innocent
hero in a “crook” drama from the electrocution-chair and
the happy ending of a pathetic love-tale fail alike to excite
more than torpid acquiescence, while a life-and-death
struggle on a tight-rope stretched between two New York
sky-scrapers will cause about the same sensation as the
progressive stages in the manufacture of a lawn-tennis
racquet. “Comedy" films (except, of course, those in
which the irresistible CHARLIE CHAPLIN appears) do not
appreciably disturb the general gravity—but perhaps
there is no very obvious reason why they should. And
yet these spectators must enjoy the entertainment, or they
would hardly patronise it as they do. t • ,

Young Girl (to distinguished writer). “I Hare ENJOYED TALKING To You. YoUR convertsATION is so UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM
YOUR writing.”
A HORSE-MARINE CHAUFFEUR.
i ProBABLY one of the happiest, as well
as one of the most useful, men in North
Russia is 2nd Lieut. Coltart, of the
R.A.S.C. Motor Transport. Do not in
your haste suppose that his happiness
(any more than his usefulness) is derived
from the consciousness of a primrose
stock, or a hunting crop wherewith to
urge on his motor lorries. Incredible
as it may seem to those familiar only
with the ways of the late war in France,
we are ſighting the Bolsh without the
aid of motor lorries, and the weather
would make the haughtiest sportsman
doff his stock.
No, Coltart's happiness has surer
foundations. Formerly a dashing caval-
ryman, he is now mothering Motor
Transport on the Dvina. Front. Into
this dry concise statement of fact what
a world of romance is compressed
You cannot set eyes upon Coltart
without being aware that his soul is
still a-horseback; you cannot make a
call upon his energies without realising
that his spirit still answers to the call
of trumpets. A nice taste in breeches,
a watchful quizzical eye, dash, deter-
mination, êlan in speech and action—
all these prove that whatsoever badge
he wears Coltart is still a cavalier.
The business of Motor Transport he
regards from the cavalry point of view.
His method of treatment would invest
the dreariest routine with romance, and
when you realise that Motor Transport
here concerns itself with forest roads
like torrent beds and with the immense,
magnificent but deceptive and shoaly
river you will understand how circum-
stance has played up to him.
His cars are like no others; they are
never defeated. No forest track is too
rough or long for them ; no cross-
country course too severe. He looks to
them to attain the cavalry standard,
and by some miracle neither he nor his
passengers are disappointed, though
the latter are often alarmed; for the cars
he puts at your disposal are as good
and game at torrent beds as over the
sticks; they combine those qualities of
the grasshopper, the tank and the
avalanche which make a clever troop-
horse the perfect companion he is.
So much for Coltart on land ; know-
ing the country, I will not call it terra
firma. Coltart, immersed in the mari-
time or riparian side of his work, appears
outwardly in a totally different guise.
The riding-breeches are exchanged for
a pair of dungarees, the cavalry tilt of
his cap is changed for a deep-sea list;
his legs assume upon the fore-shore a
straddle eloquent of heaving decks, and
his dungarees receive from time to time
a typical bo'sun's hitch. You will
never catch Coltart confusing his rôles
and applying the same adjustment to
his riding-breeches; his conversation
too is always in keeping with his part.
To hear him carrying on a discussion
with two other officers, one of whom
wants to be transported somewhere by
river and the other by road, is to be
bewildered as by a triple personality.
To the one he is a master-mariner, to the
other an arch-chauffeur; yet to both
(difficult as this may seem) always the

[“Hints to Men on the Care of Their
Clothes" is the latest audacity by a woman-
writer.] . . . ; -
I saw quite the sweetest little thing
in going-away lounge suits yesterday,
expressed in dust-cart brown gaberdine.
The coat had a graceful clinging mouve-
ment, while the austere ligme of the
trouser was relieved by the most rakish
little pli at the foot, turned up enough
to reveal a soupçon of a Vorticist sock.
Particularly did I enthuse over the gilet
which accompanied this creation; it
was of the softest turtle - dove grey,
caught sharply together with buttons
of nacre, the waist being accentuated.
Happy, indeed, is the bridegroom who
can include such an up-to-date garment
in his trousseau.
To men with restricted means, who
cannot afford at present prices more
than one suit a season, let me offer a
suggestion for brightening the mono-
tony of their attire. Quite an original
note can be struck by the adoption of
socks, tie and handkerchief of some
vibrant tone. Tomato-red, sparrow-egg-
blue, or whisky-yellow—all have their
charm. . The waistcoat should be left
partly open, with just a hint of in-
souciance to display a glimpse of braces
carried out in the chosen colour scheme.
Only the merest glimpse, of course, is
necessary to impart the cachet of smart-
ness and originality.
Very charming are the cool-looking
tennis suits which are all the rage just
now, and even the man with the most
slender purse ought certainly to indulge
in one of these. Not necessarily in which
to play tennis, of course, but because they
afford such scope for originality in belts,
which, by the way, should be worn
wound negligently round the waist and
caught up in a cabochon at the side,
the shirt being draped lightly over it
in graceful bouffées. -
The economical male can effect a
great saving by adopting pyjamas for
river wear. No colour scheme can be
too outré, for the gay stripes look all the
more effective against the restful green
background of river scenery. For the
chilly days they can be slipped over the
ordinary suit without losing any of
their chic. . -
* Sir HARRY LAUDER, I hear, always
makes his own evening ties. Lesser
lights might well follow his example
and save on what is one of the most
expensive items in evening dress. Any
man who possesses ingenuity, a glue-
pot and half-a-yard of organdi muslin
(procurable at any draper's) can fashion
six ties for the price of one.
Save your cigar bands. Pasted on a
broad strip of ribbon they show to great
advantage round a straw hat, the effect
being original and, I might even say,
arresting.
With the passing of the frock-coat
the great problem is how to adapt it to
the newer mode. Cut short at the
waist and finished with the new blanket
stitch it presents the novel effect of an
Eton jacket, which imparts that “little
boy” appearance so greatly desired by
men bordering on middle age.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 11th.-The Lords
met at the unusually early hour of three
and put in six solid hours of continuous
work. Lord SALISBURY began to feel a
certain sympathy with the trade union-
ist standpoint, and late in the evening,
to the amazement of Lord PEEL, sup-
ported a proposal to safeguard common
land from allotments, on the ground that
it might please Mr. SMILLIE.
Further amendments to the
Transport Bill, intended to reduce
the autocracy of the Minister-desig-
nate to a limited monarchy, were
passed on the motion of Lord Mon-
TAGU and other Peers. Lord LYT-
ToN, but for whose persuasive ad-
vocacy Sir ERIC GEDDEs' transports
would have been even more em-
phatically moderated, objected to
one proposal on the ground that
“the Treasury was wholly unable
to criticize technical matters, such
as the design of a locomotive or the
position of a station.” If his lord-
ship is correctly informed the Treas.
ury must be losing its nerve. Be-
fore the War it was never afraid to
criticize anything. . - -
As the moment for opening the
locked box approaches, the Free
Traders are more than ever anxious
to get a surreptitious peep at its
contents. During Questions Cap-
tain WEDGwooD BENN made so
many endeavours to prise it open
that the SPEAKER had to restrain
him. . . . - - -
Ministers confessed that the finan-
cial outlook was anything but rosy.
The production of coal is barely
half what it ought to be, and the
daily outgo of money is almost .
exictly double the daily income.
Even Mr. BoMAR LAw's announce-
ment that expenditure would be
radically cut down did little to re-
exact definition of what the new word
really meant. They would have liked
to know, too, why the introduction of
this “carefully considered measure"
has been deferred to the dog-days.
Mr. KENNEDY Jon Es declared that
the small trader was to be made a scape-
goat for thesins of bigger criminals. Mr.
CLYNEs remarked upon the absence of
the Food-CoNTROLLER's name from the
back of the Bill. Mr. G. R. THoRNE

Tuesday, August 12th.-No one can
wonder if on this day the Peers should
be inclined to grouse. Lord CHAPLIN,
with his heart in the Highlands, could
not understand why the House should be
asked to give favourable consideration to
a Bill reducing the hours worked in coal
mines from eight to seven, and pointed
out that Mr. Justice SANKEY's hope that
this could be done without raising the
price of coal had already been falsified.
The House was relieved to hear
that in future the Government in-
tended so far as possible to leave
industrial disputes to settle them-
selves. - ; :
Considering that the conduct of
Mr. J. A. CLYDE, the Lord Advo-
cate, in refusing to sanction the
prosecution of certain Air Force
contractors, was to be the principal
subject of debate in the House of
Commons, it was odd that among
the Private Bills on the Order-
Paper was the Clyde Navigation
Order Confirmation Bill. The
House gave a second reading to
the Bill, and, after hearing the
LoRD ADvoCATE's defence—which
was so convincing that it might
with advantage have been made
at an earlier date—confirmed the
Clyde Navigation in that case also.
Meanwhile, General SEELY had
carried on a vigorous controversy
with Sir F. BANBURY across the
benches over the alleged extrava-
gance of the Air Ministry in regard
to its motor-cars. Disclaiming any
intention to be unkind to his right
hon. friend, General SEELY accused
him of having made a ridiculous
mistake. “Any man with an ounce
of sense in his head " would have
seen that £2,700 for the upkeep
of a motor-car was absurd. Sir F.
BANBURY thereupon produced an
enormous bundle of shorthand
notes showing that General SEELY
move the settled gloom of the As-
sembly. But then Mr. BALDw1N
had a happy thought. Assuring
the House that it should have full

made the same mistake himself.

opportunities of revising the Esti-
mates he observed, “I think we may
assume that the LORD CHANCELLOR's
bath is a unique event"—and the va-
pours were dispelled in a burst of
happy laughter.
Rarely has a new measure received
a more unanimous buffeting in debate
than that which was accorded to
the Profiteering Bill. Sir AucKLAND
GEDDEs' defence of it was more in-
genious than convincing. Members
listened politely to his assertion that
the mere introduction of the new word
“marks an increase in social conscious-
ness,” but would have preferred an

said that the Government departments
were themselves the worst profiteers.
The best that Sir R. HoRNE could say
in reply to this varied indictment was
that he would undertake to pick worse
holes in any rival Bill than had been
picked in this one.
And yet when it came to the Division
Members were so much afraid of being
ticketed as pro-profiteers that only eight
of them were found to vote against it,
and Sir WATson RUTHERFoRD, who had
seconded the motion for the rejection,

Government Lobby.
that the really strange thing, hav-
ing regard to the general tendency
of war-time finance, is that it was a
mistake at all.
Anyhow it was a comfort to learn
from Mr. CHURCHILL that the Air Force
Estimates for next year are to be cut
down from sixty-six millions to twenty-
five. The Chief of the Air Staff is
charged with effecting this reduction,
and will in future be known as General
RE-TRENCHARD. -
Equally satisfactory, and even more
surprising, was the announcement that,
by arrangement with our French allies,
we are winding up our Watch on the
Rhine so rapidly that by the end of

October only four or five thousand
British soldiers will be required to
maintain it.
Wednesday, August 13th. — Lord
SoMERLEYToN stated that the Report
of the evidence given before the Coal
Commission ran to 1,219 pages and
would be published shortly in the form
of a Blue-book. Peers with depleted
cellars rejoiced at the prospect of a
fresh supply of cheap fuel.
Every day for weeks past the Govern-
ment have been asked for the name of
the new Ambassador to the United
States. Mr. BonAR LAw not long ago
explained the delay in making the
appointment as due to the fact that
they were looking for the “best man.”
He now announced, amid approving
cheers, that the Government had dis-
covered him in the person of the late
Foreign Minister, who has consented
for the time being to exchange Fallodon
for “a little GREY home in the West.”
Although Mr. HARRY ForsTER is one
of the best-dressed men in the House
he is also one of the most modest.
Members were a little astonished, there-
fore, when he invited their particular
attention to his mether garments. The
War Office had been accused of ex-
travagance in having provided itself
with five million yards of “tartan for
trousers.” If all the Scottish regiments
were compelled to exchange the kilt
for the trews there could not, it was
argued, be any justification for hold-
ing this huge amount.
explained that “tartan " was a term of
art in the tailoring trade, referring to
material and not to colour; and, glanc-
ing down at his own legs, immaculately
draped as usual, he remarked that he
himself was wearing “tartan” trousers
at that moment, though he did not
propose to hand them over to the Dis-
posals Board.
After five years the famous story of
the Russian soldiers in England has
come true. At this moment a thousand
Russian officers are receiving military
training at Newmarket. The an-
nouncement greatly shocked Captain
WEDGwooD BENN, who thought it a
dreadful thing that Russians should be
trained to fight against their own Gov-
ernment. But Mr. CHURCHILL's ex-
planation, that the object was to enable
them to relieve our own officers and
men, satisfied the House as a whole.
It might perhaps be well to warn Cap-
tain BENN not to jump to erroneous
conclusions if in the course of their
stay some of our visitors should be
found in attendance on the Cesarewitch.
The eleven o'clock rule was sus-
pended despite Sir DoNALD MACLEAN's
apprehensions that when the “Who
Goes Home 2'' was sounded Members
Mr. ForsTER
would find no vehicles to take them
there. The Government kindly averted
that danger by keeping the House em-
ployed until half - past seven in the
morning. -
Such private Members as could keep
their eyes open strove hard to put some
“ginger” into the Profiteering Bill, but
without much result. Even when they
insisted, contrary to the Ministerial
desire, on giving the Board of Trade
power to fix maximum prices Mr. BoSAR
LAw was careful to point out that it did
not follow that the Government would
avail themselves of the power.
Thursday, August 14th.-It was a
jaded House of Commons that met this

afternoon to finish off the Profiteering
Bill, and when Mr. BRIDGMAN excused
himself from attempting to solve one
of the fiscal conundrums propounded
to him, on the ground that he had “not
been to bed,” the cheers that greeted
him were really sympathetic.
The last stage of the Bill was very
much like its first. Hardly anyone out-
side the Government had a good word
to say for it, yet no one ventured to
vote against it. Sir Auckland GEDDEs,
in accepting an amendment from Mr,
Tyson WILSON designed to strengthen
the Government in dealing with trusts,
said that he regarded it as a “mani-
festo;" and that description might be
applied to the whole measure. To judge
by most of the speeches an equal effect
could have been produced with less
trouble and expense if a notice-board
had been erected in Whitehall Gardens
announcing that “Profiteers will be
Prosecuted.”
ANOTHER YOUNG GRICKETER'S TUTOR.
THERE has been of late so much
writing about cricket that perhaps one
more authority may be admitted to the
ranks. The Times not only has em-
barked upon a history of the game, but
has thrown open its columns to one
anonymous exponent in particular and
to all cricketers with memories in gen-
eral. The identity of the reminiscencer.
in-chief has been the principal topic
of conversation at Lord's for weeks;
in fact rarely have amateurs of conjec-
ture been offered such a plum; while the
pastime of constructing ideal elevens has
so caught on that the gentleman who
calls himself “Alpha of the Plough"
in The Star in his excitement trans-
ferred three living heroes all untimely
to the Elysian Fields. No need then to
apologise for intruding the claims of a
latter-day Indian NYREN–MohumMUD
ABDULLAH KHAN–to a place among
the authorities.
MoHUMMUD ABDULLAH KHAN's Cricket
Guide was published in Lucknow in 1891,
the full title being Cricket Guide intended
for the use of Young Players, containing
a Short but Comprehensive Account of
the Game, embracing all the important
Rules and Directions nicely arranged in
due Succession, and his reason for writ-
ing it was largely the wish to allay the
fever which cricket seems then to have
provoked in his compatriots. Those
who remember the sang-froid, the com-
posed mastery, of Prince RANJITsINHJI
may be surprised to learn that, at any
rate in 1891, cricket had a way of rush.
ing to the head of young India. “Even
those,” wrote MoHUMMUD ABDULLAH
KHAN, “who are very good and noble
(say, next-door to angels) turn so rash
and inconsiderate at certain moments
that their brains lose the balance and
begin to take fallacious fancies.” More,
they “boil over with rage, pick up
quarrels with one another, and even
look daggers at their own dearest friends
and darlings,” the cause being not only
the game itself, but an ignorance of the
laws that should govern it and them,
and without obedience to which “a
human body is nothing but a solid peace
of rocky hill, that is to say ‘cleverness.”
Very well, then. Feeling as he did
about it, MoHUMMUD ABDULLAH KHAN
had to write his book.
Practical as the instructions of this
Oriental teacher can be, it is really de-
portment that lies nearest his heart. He
is as severe on a want of seriousness
as upon loss of temper. Thus, he says:
“The fielders must take especial care
not to exchange jokes with one another
or try funny tricks that do secretly
divide their attention and produce a hor-
rible defect in their fielding.” Again,

“Behave like gentlemen after the game
is over; avoid clapping and laughing in
faces of the persons you have defeated.”
But there is no harm in a match being
momentarily interrupted by a touch
of courtesy. Thus: “If you are the
Captain of your team and the fielders
of the opposite party clap your wel-
come, you are required simply to turn
or raise your might cap a little, and
this is sufficient to prove your easy
turn of disposition as well as to furnish
the return of their compliments.”
For the most part the directions are
sound, even if they may be a little
obscure in statement; but now and then
one is puzzled. The game in India
must have been very animated if no
error has crept into the following note
on the bowler: “During one and the
same over the bowler is allowed to
change his ends as often as he may
desire, but cannot possibly bowl two
overs in succession.” And this reads
oddly: “The bowler is allowed to make
the batsman stand in any direction he
may choose from the wicket he is bowl-
ing from.” But no fault can be found
here: “The bowler must always try to
pitch his ball in such a style and posi-
tion that its spring may always rest on
the wickets to be aimed at. He must
know the proper rules of no balls and
wides and”—here we are again!—“must
never be wishing to pick up any quarrel
with the umpire of the opposite party.”
And so we reach the umpires, upon
whom the author becomes very earnest.
Under the frenetic conditions to which
cricket could reduce his countrymen, to
umpire was no joke. Indeed he goes
so far as to advise his readers never to
fill that position except when the match
is between teams personally unknown
to them. For to umpire among friends
is to turn those friends to foes. “Take
special care, my dear umpires, not to
call over unless the ball has finally
settled in the wicket-keeper's hand, as
well as avoid ordering a batsman out
unless you are appealed to by the oppo-
site party . . . Each and every one of
the umpires must avoid using insulting
terms, or playing on bets with any one
of the fielders or persons in general, in
his capacity of being an umpire.”
The requirements of a perfect wicket-
keeper are well set forth. After de-
scribing his somewhat “stooping con-
dition” the mentor says, “I would
like this man to be of a grave de-
meanour and humble mind, say the
Captain of the Club, whose duties are
to guide the fielders, order the change of
their places if necessary,” and “guard
himself well against the furious attacks
of the sweeping balls.” Here MoHUM-
MUD ABDULLUH KHAN is among some
of the best critics, who have always
held that for the captain to be wicket-
keeper (as, for example, in the case of
Mr. GREGoR McGIREGoR) is an ideal
arrangement. -- -
Point also needs some special quali-
ties, and with the recital of these and
the concluding friendly warning we
may take leave of the book: “He must
be a very smart and very clever man,
of a quick sight and slender form.”

of some sort.
“Oh,” I said, “I didn't see you be-
fore; I—I am buying some of this
Government linen.”
“Why?" asked Mrs. Carruthers.
“I thought it such a bargain,” I
said; “it will do for almost anything.
It would make nice curtains.”
“You won't like it for curtains,” she
said. “They'd crumple directly.”
“It doesn't matter,” I replied; “I
don't want any curtains and shan't for
years and years. But,” I added, grow-
ing more and more confused, “the
advertisement mentioned dozens of
things it could be used for—blinds,
chair - covers, billiard - rooms, loose-
boxes, cricket, football, tennis and golf
pavilions, cow-houses, poultry houses,
coal and wood sheds.”
“Aren't you thinking of army huts?"
she interrupted.
“So I was,” I exclaimed, my brain
suddenly clearing; “but "–intelligently
—“it would do for children's frocks.
That wasn't in the army huts adver-
tisement, was it 2."
“You'll find it most extravagant
wear for children,” she said. “I wouldn't
advise you to use it for that unless you
can give them a clean one every other
day.”
“I haven't any children,” I said
sweetly, “but I could use it for a tent.
Eighty-five yards should be enough for
a marquee, I think, and possibly a few
tea-cosies, which I badly want. Good
bye.” And I left her staring blankly
after me.
But I don't mind telling you that I
haven't the remotest idea what I shall
do with that linen or why I bought it,
except that it has become a habit with
me, since the days of Government tea
and Government cheese, War Bonds
and Loans, to support the Government.
I would even buy an army hut for use
as a Government coal and wood shed,
as advertised—if I could buy Govern-
ment coal to put in it.

RECONSTRUCTION IN
CLUBLAND.
The futureof London Clubs is already
seriously exercising the minds of our
instructors in the daily Press, one of
whom has uttered a weighty plea in
favour of concentration and amalgama-
tion as the only way to meet the econo-
mic and social difficulties of the situa-
tion. But, as so often happens, specific
suggestions are lacking. A great oppor-
tunity is at hand for promoting social
fellowship, if only it is resolutely and
fearlessly grasped.
To be more precise, there are a number
of “West End Clubs,” seldom mentioned
by name, which are constantly being
raided. Excitement, as another of our
public instructors has recently informed
us, is an essential and healthy element
in life. Why should these Clubs have
a monopoly of these stimulating ex-|
periences? One of the first needs of
Club reconstruction is the fraternisation
of the dull and decorous clubmen of
Pall Mall and Piccadilly with their more
vivacious and enterprising brethren of
Soho.
There is one very select Club, of
which it was once said that it was like
a duke's mansion with the duke lying
dead upstairs. Such an atmosphere can
only tend to perpetuate that unfortunate
class feeling which Mr. SMILLIE and
Mr. WILLIAMs are so heroically labour-
ing to remove. The notion that a Club
should be a sanctuary is little short
of an insult to the intelligence of the
majority and a survival of the old ex-
clusiveness, which the new and en-
lightened distribution of honours has
happily dome so much to break down.
Arrangements for sound-proof dormi-
tories are perſectly compatible with the
general brightening of Club life. How
clamant the demand is for this spiritual
quiescence may be gathered from the
fact that at none of the old Clubs are
any meals accompanied by music. Un-
less we are greatly mistaken there is
not a single gramophone in the Pry-
taneum, where an archbishop is credibly
reported to have recently asked an emi-
ment doctor whether syncopation was
the same as syncope The roof-garden
at the Petroleum, begun in 1914 and
interrupted by the outbreak of the War,
still remains incomplete, a tragic monu-
ment of thwarted but noble enterprise.
Incredible as it may seem, it is none
the less true that the plans of the new
International Ballet Club contain no
provision for a swimming-bath.
On the negative side perhaps the most
imperative need is that of dealing faith-
fully yet humanely with Club bores.
Many schemes have been put forward,
but perhaps the most satisfactory is
the system of probationary selection for
two or possibly three years, after which
every member will have to come up for
a confirmatory ballot, those who are
rejected becoming ipso facto honorary
members of the United Bronchitic Club,
or the Pulmonarium, as it is proposed
to name this great residual institution.
But even before the probationary period
has expired it is suggested that the
Committee of any Club should take
powers to deport any member who in
the space of twenty-four hours uses the
phrase, “What are we coming to?”
more than twelve times.
THE WRAPPER.
HE was a perfectly good novelist;
not quite good enough to be kept under
glass in a uniform edition and not quite
bad enough to be a “Best Seller.”
His next book, which was to be his
masterpiece, was practically finished
when he met her.
She was the prettiest possible young
artist. Red bobbed hair and just eigh-
teen. So, when she mentioned her
wish to paint a picture as a frontispiece
or “wrapper” for his book, he was
delighted.
“I’ve got something now,” she said,
“that might perhaps * *
“Please let me see it.”
It was perfect Just right! Only—
his heroine had bright red hair and lay
a good deal on purple cushions. The
girl in the picture was a brunette.
“Never mind,” he said, consoling her,
“I’ll have it all the same. It will
reproduce beautifully.”
“But—”
He explained to her—for she was,
like very many young people, rather
old-fashioned—that neither the title of
a book nor its wrapper need have any-
thing to do with the story; that a
portrait should be like the artist, not
the sitter, and other obvious facts.
He also told her that the picture
would make the novel a success; but
it was clear that she was still troubled
by a prejudice in favour of the old kind
of illustration, the kind that bore some
relation to its subject, so, when she
had gone, he determined to alter the
colouring of his heroine to suit the
picture.
He soon found out that hair-dyeing
is not the simple business he thought
it, and that the transformation of his
blonde into a brunette compelled him
also to change not only the colour of
the cushions and other accessories, but
the style of her character, and indeed
re-write much of the dialogue and what
there was of a plot. Even the hero had
to be touched up, so as to be brought
into harmony or else contrast.
The job took several weeks.
But he did it. He wanted to give
her a pleasant surprise.
“I’ve been working frightfully hard
too,” she murmured, when he called
at last.
“Good. Let's have another look at
the picture.”
She turned the canvas. The heroine
had suffered a hair-change. Her chev-
elure was now bright red.
He hadn't the heart to ask her to
undo her work, nor the energy to re-
store in the novel the original colouring
of his heroine; so he let things be:
and the book appeared with red hair
on the outside and black within. After
all, this often happens in real life.
The combination made a great hit,
and they married on the proceeds.
“NEW WORLDS FOR OLD.”
IN my youth, when impressions were
chronic,
I recall my deep joy as I heard
Of a State which was purely platonic,
Where no wickedness ever occurred;
Of its truth long I nursed the conviction,
Till, alas! when but half through my
teens
I pronounced poor Atlantis a fiction
To tell the Marines.
Still inclined, in a way, to myopia
And the cult of fantastical lore,
I next read of a world termed Utopia,
And daily kept shouting for MoRE;
But its roseate hues changed to yellow,
And I turned, like the Hun from the
Marne,
To find it as false as its fellow
And simply a yarn.
Now 'tis said that our own little planet,
New-born from the wreck of the old
And the ruins of madmen who ran it,
Will produce a fresh Era of Gold;
Yet I mean to withhold my laudations;
I shall wait till it's not quite so new,
Lest it prove, like these storied crea-
tions,
A fairy-tale too.
“For the many thousands of girls of all
ages, descriptions, and sizes who find, when
their yearly holiday comes round, that they
have no place to go, the Y.M.C.A. holiday
camps are not only a blessing but a real Para-
dise on earth.”—Evening Papcr.
Possibly ; but what does the Y.W.C.A.
say about it?
“Month by month the time is to be passed
away until the nation that plunged the world
into a war which has-well the results are well
known— shall come out of her enforced retire-
ment on an equality with you who read these
lines, and with we who write. We have written
the last sentence advisedly.”
Bangalore Daily Post.
We had hoped it was an accident.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A PECULIAR interest attaches itself now to the work of
Mr. WILLIAM DE Morgan, since the death of the writer has
removed it definitely into that past to which, even at the
time of its production, it seemed always so strangely to
belong. It is odd also, in view of the inevitable comparison
with CHARLEs DICKENs, to find that both have left their
unfinished mysteries. Fortunately, however, for the patience
of those who dislike the unsolved problem, that of The Old
Madhouse (HEINEMANN) is shrouded by no such obscurity
as the fate of Edwin Drood. I am afraid I must add that,
even had this been so, and the fate of Dr. Carteret never
been disclosed, it is improbable that any specially poignant
curiosity would have been excited. The fact is (to be done
with carping) that here is a tale showing the DE MoRGAN
method at its best, or worst, according to the taste and
fancy of the individual. Dr. Carteret disappears in Chapter
Three, when surveying the old house of the title as a pro-
spective residence for his nephew, about to be married; the
nephew, his engagement broken off, falls gradually in love
with the wife of his friend. Behold all ! And for five hun-
dred and fifty-odd pages a number of natural, credible and
very talkative persons discuss these two subjects in that
haphazard manner from which Mr. DE MoRGAN's countless
admirers derive so much pleasure. As for the actual mys-
tery, that, as I say, is no great matter; indeed, when ex-
plained by Mrs. DE MoRGAN, in an interesting note upon
her husband's literary manner, it may seem to have been
much ado about rather little. One sees however possibilities
for unwritten scenes that would have heightened its effect.
Because those scenes can never now be written, The Old
Madhouse is assured of a warm welcome as the last of a
series that has made its definite mark upon English fiction.
The Graven Image (Hodder AND SToughton) is precisely
one of those books whose virtues cannot be concentrated
into a sparkling paragraph. Eminently a sound tale, dealing
with a large number of characters, all well and truly drawn,
who never do anything that real persons would not do in
similar circumstances—what can one say of such a story
except detail the plot, which would take too long, or record
a curt mark of approval, perhaps hardly fair to the prospec-
tive reader? However, medio tutissimus ibo, and content
myself with giving you some kind of epitome of Mr. DAVID
LYALL's scheme. I will reveal at once what took me some
little intelligence to detect, that the Graven Image of the title
= the Golden Calf= an over-strong appreciation of money.
Hence an interest distinctly topical. The root of all evil is
shown worshipped, or in some cases spurned, by the various
members of the Rawdon family; by Oliver, the father, who
spent his life contemplating it, and hardened in the process;
by Marjorie, his second wife and stepmother of his children
(a charmingly drawn character, who slips too soon into the
back-ground), and by the second generation in their own
commercial or matrimonial adventures. Of these younger
folk I myself best liked Judy (an unusual girl, if only because
she used the word camouflage with familiarity in the Spring
of 1914—one clearly who might be called in advance of
her time). Judy, after some inclination towards the Image,
in the person of an elderly but affluent suitor stolen from

the more appropriate Bertha, repented, and chose love in a
cottage with a mate of her own years. The author says it
was his ‘young beauty' that influenced her, a view that the
wrapper-artist sternly discourages. Mr. LYALL's hunch of
life—it is rather too substantial to be considered a slice—if
devoid of sensational plums, provides fare at least nourish-
ing and digestible.
Admirers of Mrs. MAUD DIVER's Strange Roads will please
note that the end of the War and the Peace Conference
find their friends of that book still, with some exceptions,
intact, after having borne themselves during these last few
years much as might have been expected of them. Their
history, as related in this second instalment, is all mixed up
with that of Europe, and is called The Strong Hours (CoN-
STABLE); but really and truly the authoress is not nearly so
strenuous as, judging from the title, she seems to think,
being much more apt at character-sketching than the thrills
of battle. This is all to the good, because readers who have
not met Derek Blount and the rest before may yet be suffi-
ciently intrigued in them for their own sake, rather than
for that of their earlier doings. They still retain the habit
thrills and do not mind being dazzled, you can hold your
breath right through The Lamp in the Desert (HUTCHINson)
from start to finish. There are some murders, an Indian
rising—and oh, a pet mongoose! I almost forgot the pet
mongoose. He fights with a snake and is subsequently
killed by a heavy bronze paper-weight which a lady hurls
at him in a fit of temper. But true love burns true to the
end. Dacre is disposed of; Everard and Stella are happy,
and Netta, the owner of the pet mongoose, has a pet mon-
gosling to play with. The Lamp in the Desert is a very
exciting book. -
Fields of Victory (HUTCHINsoN) consists of letters written
by Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD for the purpose of riveting atten-
tion upon the decisive part played by the British Armies
in the concluding stages of the War. It is an opportunity
which she has grasped with both hands. From one cause
or another the magnificent work performed by British
troops during last autumn has not been duly realized, and
it was time that this defect should be remedied and the
truth brought home to people who from constitutional
disinclination do not read despatches. The task was not
of not taking their excite-
ment quite seriously; their
experience, for instance, be-
ing mainly remarkable for
| opportune returns to that
exactly right hospital where
a hero may find the exactly
right nurse waiting to help
continue the story on lines
which suggest armistices
already signed. Certainly
there is a creepy German—
one of the sort with a hid-
den hand up his sleeve—
whom the writer is sure
an easy one, and Mrs. WARD
apologises for her audacity
in undertaking it. Happily,
however, her apology is un-
necessary, because she ap-
proached the work in a pro-
per spirit and has carried
it through with a finely
balanced judgment. Her
book is at once an incon-
testable proof of British
valour and a great tribute
to the bravery of our Allies.

I have never felt that the solemn ex-cathedra verdict,
“We are not amused,” ever proved anything more than
that the sense of humour of the one pronouncing it might
be defective. So I hesitate to make much of the fact that
I found A Sailor's Home (HEINEMANN), a book of stories
mainly humorous in intention, by “Richard DEHAN,”
rather a gloomy affair. Its vigorous author seems to be
under the impression that she can make jokes by sheer
force, and I am led to wonder whether she takes enough
trouble to make her always bizarre situations reasonably
plausible, or if she ever crosses out anything once set down.
I also find her obscure, and, turning back, as a conscientious
reviewer needs must, to elucidate this or that mystery, find
that there's nothing much in it. “The Rector's Duty,” in
which a sporting ne'er-do-well takes the place of his parson
brother for a hectic week or so, is the best of a disconcerting
bunch. But even that is marred by senseless exaggeration,
such as the description of a man getting back to bed in a
strange room “after having firmly wedged the burner of the
gas-bracket in the socket of his left eye.” The kingdom of
humour surely suffereth not such violence.

In your cottage by the mer,
Heartened by the horn of Triton,
Zephyrs playing through your hair;
Lustier, hour by hour, and lieſer,
May your figure put on fat,
Under yon cerulean reefer
And the grey felt hat.

Mar your matin-song in bed;
Where the NorthcLIFFEs cease from troubling
And vendettas take a rest—
May the wine of joy go bubbling
Down your happy chest |
As you promenade with RIDDELL
Or Sir ERIC by the wave, -
Not as NERo will you fiddle
O'er your country's open grave;
Gently will your fancies pivot
Round the doom to which she sinks,
As you readjust the divot
On the Deauville links.
When the bank rakes in your louis,
And you try to smile in French,
Soft will grow your eye and dewy
At our efforts to retrench ;

You invited us poor devils
To economise.

looking at me under puckered brows. “His utter callous-

“Putting aside the 'even,’” I replied, “I can hardly be

know Randolf is lazy, pigheaded, unpatriotic and insensi-
tive to duty, but brothers often are complete antitheses,

“Do what?” asked Randolf, reverting to the point.
“Oh, anything,” she replied. “Buy Victory Loan, plant
vegetables, save coal—anything to help the country in this
economic crisis.”
Randolf smiled—that horrid supercilious smile which he
uses on great oceasions.
“You think yourselves very patriotic, but tell me a single
thing you do which is not utterly selfish and done expressly
for your own satisfaction. Look you—” he laid down his
pipe and pointed his finger at us as if he were a school-
master—“look you—you buy Loan because it pays you
five per cent. ; you plant vegetables in order to eat them
yourself; you economise coal because you both hate a proper
healthy cold tub in the morning; all your patriotism is
utterly selfish. Now I–now I y
“Now you,” prompted Nina.
“Now I am engaged in a project destined to revolutionise
modern society in every branch, and that although it will
bring upon me disdain and ostracism.”
“What on earth are you doing?” asked Nina, thoroughly
alarmed.
“Ah! you may well ask,” said Randolf, full of mystery.
“Tell us—please do tell us,” she pleaded.
“I’ve been here a week,” replied Randolf, “and borne
your jeers. You say I'm lazy and unpatriotic, but I'm
not.”
“Well them, tell us what you are doing,” Nina insisted.
“I'm letting my hair grow,” exclaimed Randolf with tre-
mendous emphasis. “To let one's hair grow is an unpar-
donable crime. No public school will tolerate it. The
Army, the Navy would rag a disciple of my creed out of the
service. But it is a true creed, and once it is recognised
England will forge ahead with a giant's strides. SAMson had
long hair and he prevailed. They cut it and he was over-
powered. And who has the finest hair in this generation?”
he asked excitedly.
“Oh, I should say PADEREwski,” replied Nina.
“Exactly.” Randolf was triumphant. “And PADEREwski
excelled as a pianist, as a politician, and as a pig-farmer,
Perhaps you haven't noticed—you wouldn't—that LLoyd
GEORGE never became Prime Minister till he let his hair
grow. There was once a time, too, when they wore pigtails
in the Navy, and those were the days of Trafalgar.”
“Yes, Nina,” I cut in, seizing the idea with my usual
facility, “if only BEATTY had had a pigtail do you suppose
the valuable German fleet would be lying useless to-day
at the bottom of the sea at Scapa Flow 2"
“They might be in a worse place,” said Nina.
“Let us waive the point,” said Randolf magnanimously.
“Take my own case. Was I not a bright and witty child,
and have I ever been the same since I lost my childish
curls 2'"
“Not that I know of,” said Nina.
“No,” Randolf exclaimed, slightly ruffled. “But I shall
be, now that I have let my hair grow. Nearly all the bril.
liant thinkers, practically all the greatest ideas, have been
the result of freely-grown hair. And this is my idea, and
this is what I am doing, despite criticism, in my country's
need.”
Randolf stalked triumphantly to the door.
Nina eyed him curiously. Then suddenly she exclaimed,
“Oh, Randolf, I never noticed it before, but now you
mention it . . . and no doubt it explains the brilliamey of
your idea.”
“But what?” asked Randolf.
“You’re almost quite bald behind,” said Nina.

Commercial Traveller. “How Do YoU Do, MY DEAR old Boy? DoN'T You REMEMBER our MEETING AT CAMBRAI ?”
Business Man. “AH, YEs—of course.
LET ME SEE Now, which side were You ON ?”
A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,-Your esteemed com-
munication of the umpteenth ultimo to
hand and its contents noted.
White mealies are at seventeen-and-
six a bag, are they? And monkey-nuts
thirteen-and-fourpence? Dear me!
Hard times in the monkey-world—
what? So your latest gold-hole, “The
El Dorado,” has turned out a fraud and
a delusion, but, on the other hand, the
old Mongwato cow, “Gwendoline,” has
calved at last. I am a firm believer in
the Law of Compensation, aren't you ?
You say that now that the European
disturbance has been taken out of my
hands and transferred to Versailles you
trust the next South-bound ferry will
be haling me along with it, and that
ere long we shall meet to quaff the
bubbling beaker again. Not so, old son,
not on your side of the Big Drift. For
many years in many climes we have
been attempting to overtake the elusive
bawbee, thou and I, haven't we? And
with what success 2 The answer is
“Wash-out.” But now at last I think
I have him cornered, I do, here, right
here in London.
Know, then, that the dance is the
thing in England now. They dance in
the afternoon, they dance in the even-
ing, they dance all night (if they're
let). Take a girl out to tea and she
insists on consuming it at full speed,
you in one hand, an éclair in the other
—grazing at the gallop as 'twere. Take
her out to dine and she'll get in three
laps between the fish and the entrée, a
chukka betwixt the coffee and the bill.
It's going to make a hardy race of us,
my lad.
But the tune has changed since our
day. The “Blue Danube,” “Destiny,”
“Amoureuse" — voluptuous morsels
like that which used to send thrills into
our hearts and feet when you and I
were susceptible young things, are
heard no more in the land. To-day all
hands are up and at it to the dulcet
din of drum, banjo, siren, rattle, drum
again, bones, squeaker, whistle, motor-
hooter, tearing calico, cat-calls and yet
more drum. The result sounds likesome-
thing between a train-wreck, lunch-
hour at the Dogs' Home and a busy
morning in a boiler factory. It's noise
the public wants just now, and it
doesn't seem to mind what sort of noise
it gets as long as it's the kind that
peeved the oyster, namely a noisy
In Olse.
And who has this City of the World
by the ears? -Who puts down the crash-
barrage? Why, Coons, my Ginger.
Niggers, Ethiopians, Smokes, Sambos,
Woollies, Kaffirs, Coloured Gents—no
less, and at a rate of remuneration
which would make the mouth of a
cannon water. White din-merchants
there are, 'tis true, but the black brother
leads the field in a walk, having a
natural gift that way.
Do you remember my old outfit back
in the bush before the War, and my re-
tainers, Whiskers, By’m'by, Klass and
Capetown, and the Hallelujah Chorus
they used to raise of a pay-night? There
would be a prodigal issue of over-proof
native beer all round as an apéritif and
then the orchestra would get busy.
Whiskers' métier was the fiddle. He
constructed it himself from a derelict
paraffin tin, the leg of a chair and a
yard of buck gut. He could make
the thing whine like a whipped puppy.
By’m'by had a twelve-inch mouth
and an eight-inch mouth-organ. He
would rub one against the other until
the sparks flew and the jackals and
hyenas for miles around sat up on their
tails and howled.
Klass did the heavy work on the
tom-tom. He lived for his art. Oft-
times of an overwhelming tropic night,
with scorching winds blowing off the
desert and the mercury singing merrily
in the thermometer, have I seen him

wolloping that old drum as if his life
depended in knocking it inside out, the
veins standing up all over him, sweat
pattering off him like rain.
Capetown was the song and dance
specialist. You must remember him, a
'bull-necked young Matabele who used
to drive my ox-spans? I have heard
voices in my day. I have heard the
heaviest calibre of Feldwebel instruct-
ing recruits, and Coney Island “Bally-
hops” vaunting their dime-shows. I
i have heard the Prophet Dowie praying
and England's heaviest actor-manager
talking about himself. I have heard
the mate of a Falmouth storm-tug giv-
ing the captain of a Rotterdam wind-
jammer his (the mate's) idea of his (the
captain's) pedigree in half a gale off
Cape Cornwall, and the watchers on
the Longships came out to listen. Just
before zero of the third Battle of Ypres
a horse brought down its iron-shod
hoof on the corn-plastered toe of a
Squadron Leader of ours. He lifted
up his voice and for twenty minutes
completely drowned the bombardment.
I have heard a ranch capataz admon-
ishing some young gauchos for letting
a bunch of two-year-old beef slip round
them for the second time in one day,
and the language he used set the dry
pampas afire half a mile away. All
these were good efforts in their way,
but mere idle zephyrs to the hurricane
hullabaloo of my Capetown, believe me.
Did the waggon stick in a drift he
would fill his capacious bellows, open his
mouth so wide that his head seemed to
have split in half, and explode. If the
oxen did not drop down dead of heart
failure there and then they would find
themselves and the waggon blown high
and dry up the opposite bank.
Get my meaning now? If it's
niggers they need over here, and noisy
niggers, I fancy I can supply the
noisiest quartet in the history of the
world.
So get a move on and round 'em up
for me, old man. Whiskers, I under-
stand, is in gaol. He's been there
ever since I left. Says he “likes it.”
Next to myself Tony Shorecomb was
the most credulous fool in the country,
so you will probably find By’m'by
battening on him. Klass lives under a
mimosa-tree at the fork of the Bongola
River. He has a little pied-d-terre
down there, consisting of half an acre
of melons, a goat and four wives.
Of Capetown's whereabouts. I have
no notion, but if you stand still for a
moment and cock an ear you will hear
him wherever he is.
Round the bold boys up; tell them
their old Baas is over here waiting for
them, surrounded by pots of beer.
Promise them sixpence a day stipend.

of youth and beauty, coronetted chorus
ladies, diamond-studded munitioneers,
German-Jew financiers and other mem-
bers of the British aristocracy. On a
raised platform, amid an oasis of imita-
tion palms, sit the jackal and the
hyena howling as though love had
passed them by. There also, arrayed
in their go-to-meeting regalia of leopard
skins, ostrich plumes, brass-wire fallals

|NNER HISTORY.
IT was in Percy's rooms that we
listened spell-bound to this story of the
War.
Percy, who is in his way a bit of a
pivot, is now in an advanced state of
demobilisation. He retains the rank of
Captain but declines to take the badges
and buttons off his tunic and dye the
remainder of his uniform ; he prefers
to owe fourteen guineas for a complete
suit. -
“No,” said Percy, in answertonothing
in particular, “I am not yet publishing
| my Reminiscences of the War. If I
| did, I should feel it my duty to truth
|
|
and posterity to cast aspersions of a
deep and lasting nature on several
senior officers. These officers are still
serving and an iron discipline would
forbid them to reply. That is not my
idea of British fairplay. Nevertheless I
have seen a little of Inner History during
these last four years or so . . . .” He
blinked and looked important.
Jimmy snorted openly. “I suppose
that is what you got your Croix-de-
guerre for,” he said bitterly. Jimmy is
apt to be a little bitter on the subject
of other people's decorations.
“That incident in itself,” said Percy
imperturbably, “might be said to belong
to Inner History. Come, I will tell
you the story.”
Before we could stop him he had
started.
“It was just after the Armistice—
“I knew it,” said Jimmy fiercely."
“Just—after—the Armistice,” Percy
continued, keeping his gaze fixed on his
steel helmet suspended in the corner,
“and we had moved up to the line of
the Meuse. Here things became a bit
monotonous, until the Corps Com-
mander decided to select and fortify a
main line of resistance, in case the
enemy should change his mind. Quite
a large number of the Staff happened
to return from leave about this time
and they took the matter up with great
zeal. I changed my company frontage
about once a day under expert advice
of different branches of the Staff. At
last a tremendously senior General
r x
decided to inspect the line. He arrived
with the usual immense following—you
know the sort of thing 2"
“Yes," came the murmured answer
of suffering reminiscence.
“I could hardly see the turnip field
where I was supposed to resist the tide
of barbarism; it was submerged in
caps of brilliant hue. I received the
General—I hope with some dignity.
He, on his side, was stern yet affable,
if you understand me. Then we mean-
dered in column of route along my
front. At one point the General sug-
gested moving a trench further forward;
my Colonel hastily agreed. With a
withering glance at the Colonel, who
had chosen the present site himself the
day before, I also agreed. A murmur
of enthusiastic agreement also passed
down the long column of the Staff, who
were following us; the A.P.M., who
was smoking a Woodbine in the ex-
treme rear, seemed particularly pleased
about it.
“About half-way along the line we
had to pass through a barbed-wire fence.
Here young Smith, one of my subalt-
erns, very officiously held up the top
strand of wire while the General crawled
through. The Colonel, who is a stout-
ish man, handed me his trench-coat
and crawled through in light fighting
order. Then, as has happened before,
he walked on and left me to carry his
coat.
“It was a brand-new coat and he was
rather proud of it. I suppose that was

why he had brought it out. It was a
fine day, and the only others with coats
were the General and an A.D.C., who
had a wonderful yellow garment, all
pockets and fur collar.
“Presently, in some very moist plough,
we came to one of my Lewis gun posts.
“Here we halted and talked learnedly
about the field of fire. Young Smith,
without any orders, threw himself on
the muddy ground and said the field
of fire was splendid—a Quixotic per-
formance, I thought; but the General
seemed to find his youthful ardour
catching. I saw his knees giving gently,
and I knew instinctively that he was
going to lie down too.
“One glance at his bright field-boots
and his new riding-breeches decided me.
With a respectful yet firm 'Allow me,
Sir,' I placed the Colonel's new coat on
the mud and waved an inviting hand.
With a sigh of content the General
sank on to it, and the Staff Officers all
around sank in unison.
“Only the Colonel stood, and he was
looking at me, and not in the direction
of the enemy, as the book directs.
“After a few moments the General
arose and said the position was excel-
The D.A.Q.M.G., who had been
pretending to kneel in a puddle, said it
was one of the best fields of fire he had
ever seen. The A.P.M., who had not
even pretended to kneel down, made a
note about it, and the procession pre-
red to move on.
“With the help of young Smith, who
had now reached the giggling stage, I
managed to extract the Colonel's coat,
which had become firmly embedded in
the mud; it came out with a sort of
hollow squelching noise. The G.S.O.
smiled approvingly as I wrung it out
and said something about Sir WALTER
RALEIGH; the General also smiled as he
shook hands and said that my line had
been very well chosen.
“It was a most pleasant party of
warriors, all smiling and chatting in
the bleak Belgian field, their trials all
over and victory in their grasp. The
General asked how long I had been with
Infantry in France, and smiled again
when I said three years.
“At last the Colonel suggested—a
trifle curtly, I thought—that they should
move on to the next Company. So they
passed on, and I stood aside as the long
column, with glint of spur and bright
many-coloured caps, passed slowly by.
I sent young Smith to Headquarters
with the Colonel's coat and instructions
to start about the work of restoration.
“A few weeks later I met the General
and he congratulated me on having been
recommended for a Croix-de-guerre.
“There are other things I could tell,”
Percy concluded, “but the time is not
yet. We are too close to these events
to see them in their true perspective.
We are apt to draw faulty conclusions.”
We agreed and left it at that,

THALASSA.
It was a bright warm day with a
sportive wind. I went into a hat-
monger's shop and asked the proprietor
for a straw hat.
“A light one?” he asked.
“Well, I had thought of a dark quiet
maroon with an indigo stripe,” I began.
“I was referring to the weight, Sir,”
he explained. -
“Oh, I see,” I said; “a light one by
all means.” -
“Light straw boater for this gentle-
man, George,” he shouted into the inner
recesses of his store.
I was conducted to a glittering pile
of casques.
“Why is it called a “boater’?” I in-
quired as I made my choice.
“‘Boater,' Sir—trade term, Sir,” he
assured me as he gave me my change.
“Well, you may send my Smuts
home for me,” I said as I entrusted my
grey collapsible to his care.
It was a poor joke, and I soon paid
for it. The Mall, I suppose, is too
severe a temptation to offer to any
meddlesome light straw boater on a
gusty day. Mine had gone some fifty
yards at about the pace of an ordinary
whizz-bang in the direction of Buck-
ingham Palace before I realised what
was happening. Fortunately a taxi hove
in sight.
“Follow the gleam,” I cried to the
driver and leaped on board.
It was the Victoria Memorial that
saved the situation. The taximan
helped me to fish it out of the fountain,
and I hoped the wetting it had got
would sober the pranksome thing. It
did for a time. I had walked back
along the Mall and was in Whitehall
before the spirit of Bolshevism took it
violently again. An upward gust caught
it by the battered brim, and I was just
able to mark it whiffling through a
second-floor window before it disap-
peared. I went and laid my troubles
before a stout commissionaire. He
took me into a large room, gave me pen,
ink and blotting-paper and a pile of
printed forms.
“John Arthur Binks,” I wrote with
great care, “to see the First Lord of
the Admiralty. Business: Recovery of
light straw boater.”
After waiting about twenty minutes
I was shown upstairs into a room where
a very grave young man was sitting
at a desk. A stack of minutes liberally
sprinkled with blots was in front of
him and he had a slight abrasion of the
left temple. He rose as I entered and
handed me my refractory morion.
“The First Lord is engaged,” he said
in an even voice, “but I am directed
by him to return this to you, and to
request that if you have any further
specimens of er—headgear to sub-
mit for their Lordships' approval you
will forward the same through the
customary channels.”
I bowed profoundly and went out.
Catching a motor - bus and climbing
on to the top I had proceeded as far
as Charing Cross station when the
irrepressible took the bit between its
teeth and bolted again. This time it
chose the roof of a motor-bus travelling
in the opposite direction ; but I was
much too cunning for it. I climbed
down speedily, dived into the Tube,
changed on to the Underground and
beat it at Victoria by about half a
minute.
“Caught one of my fares a nasty
crack in the jaw, it did,” said the con-
ductor as he handed it back to me in
the station yard.
I surveyed the dishevelled object for
a few moments and reflected. It was
spattered with mud and ink; one part
of the jagged brim was bent down-
wards, and the other tiptilted like the
petal of a flower.
Further, I concluded that its heart
was clearly set on the sea. Twice it had
made a dart for Victoria, and once to
the head-quarters of the British Navy
itself. Who was I to baulk it of its
desire? It was evidently absurd to
think of going to the office that morn-
ing. I could easily explain the incident.
I went to the booking-office. “Is
this the Light Straw Boater Company
line 2 " I asked the man in the hutch.
“I mean the London, Brighton and
South Coast 2"
“It is,” he replied.
I booked a return to the silver sea
and made my way to the train.
The people who walk about on the
front at Brighton are not accustomed
to violent exercise as a rule, but they
got it that afternoon. I discovered at
least three new short slips for Sussex
and a couple of Olympic sprinters pre-
viously unknown to fame. There were
men who salved the L.S.B. from under
the wheels of Government lorries and
men who clawed it from the air with
ebony canes. Most of them took the
game in good part, but I must except the
lady who dropped a priceless Pekingese
and her golden reticule at one and the
same moment as the truant caught her
in the neck and made a crease in the
powder; the two stout gentlemen who
were tripped up on the esplanade when
it cannoned against their calf-topped
patent-leathers, and the obvious war-
profiteer whose pince-nez it broke just
opposite the Monopole Hotel. Slightly
exhausted myself after an hour or so
of this pastime, I went for a stroll on
the pier, pressing my mangled straw-
rick firmly to my head. The first time
that Irelinquished my pressure it gave a
happy sigh and flapped off deliberately
like a seagull towards the white-capped
waves. I fancy I saw a motor-launch
setting out after the derelict, but so
far as I was concerned the light straw
boater was no more. I waved it a last
farewell and let it boat. EvoB.

BRIGHTENING CHESS.
For a game which is generally ad-
mitted to be admirable, by those who
play it as well as by those who do not,
chess has not the popularity it deserves.
We have yet to read of a bookmaker
who has thought it worth his while to
turn his attention to the game. It
will be interesting indeed if there is
truth in the rumour that chess is now
under the consideration of Mr. CHARLEs
B. CochRAN, who has done so much to
popularise the drama.
One great fault of chess has been
that the interests of the spectators
(who, if there at all, have a good chance
of being in the majority) have been
sacrificed to those of the players. Chess
wants brightening. As played to-day
it appears to be more an anxiety than
a recreation. Each player frowns at
the board as if he had added up the
squares again and again and could only
find sixty-three. True, there is that
slow expansion of the cranium familiar
to all chess-watchers; but, when all is
said and done, there is too little move.
ment in the game.
Give the spectator a chance and
there may be hope. For it is the spec-
tator who has made football what it
is, and given vitality to the so-called
game of baseball; and we predict that
chess will be a different game when
rattles, house-bells and motor-horns are
permitted among the onlookers.
A less abbreviated style of chess-
reporting would help the game into
the favour of the million. When
Casabianca with eyes flashing and his
Paraguayan blood ten degrees C. above
boiling-point, shoots out a lithe hand
and with republican ruthlessness grasps
the white queen by the head and sets
her down in the midst of her sable
enemies, surely something more might
be written about it than “Q—KB2.”
That sort of thing is all very well for
costly communications in the “Per-
sonal" or “Servants Wanted'’ column,
but in the news columns it is calculated
almost to drive the reader to the
leading article.
If the game is worth playing it is
worth brightening. Let a seventy-nine
square board be introduced if that will
do it; let us abolish the three-day
match; let certain of the pieces, un-
known to the players, be fastened to
the board with cobbler's wax; let there
be a gramophone on every chess-table;
let it be a rule that each player shall
wear hob-nailed boots and do what he
likes with his opponent's legs under the
table—anything for brightness.
It is said (with what truth the pre-
sent writer cannot tell) that during the
recent chess tournament at Hastings
more people attended the cinema each
day than went to watch the chess-
players! This at least is certain, that
the game must be taken in hand quickly,
and thoroughly reconstructed, if it is to
become one of the popular spectacular
sports of the coming winter.

MR. Robert SMILLIE is devoting his hard-earned leisure
to the composition of a brilliant. satire called “The New
Battle of Blenheim. SouTHEY's deplorable poem, it will be
remembered, ended with the stanza:— . . . . . º
“‘And everybody praised the Duke
Who this great fight did win.’—
“But what good came of it at last?'
Quoth little Peterkin.- - - - -
“Why, that I cannot tell,' said he,
“But 'twas a famous victory.’”.
It is enough to say that Mr. SMILLIE's poem ends on a very
different note, and that a considerable fluttering of the ducal
dovecotes is expected from its publication.

Fame has its penalties as well as its privileges. Madame
CLARA BUTT, so we read in the “Tea Table Talk” of a con-
temporary, “has been driven to the erection of a special
staircase from her rooms to the garden to avoid curious
eyes,” at Llandrindod Wells. The faithful chronicler omits
to mention, however, that Sir Edward CARson, who is stay-
ing at the same resort, descends, heavily disguised, in a
parachute from his rooms on the fifth floor whenever he
wishes to take the air, re-ascending in a small airship called
“The Covenant;" and that Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY, another
visitor, has had a special light-railway laid down from his
hotel to the links.

At Aix-les-Bains Sir ALFRED Mond, to avoid the em-
barrassing attentions of the enthusiastic populace, has
been obliged to have a special tunnel constructed from his
hotel, providing him with a secret exit at a distance of
about a quarter-of-a-mile. Again, now that the normal
holiday traffic has been resumed in the Isle of Man, Sir
HALL CAINE has been compelled to fortify Greeba Castle
against invaders, relic-hunters, etc., with a strong system
of trenches, barbed-wire and pill-boxes.

THUs one by one our old beliefs get shaken,
And lo! another ruin swells their wreck,
For Europe's fell disease, I find, has taken
The nigger in the neck.
No more we'll know him for the docile creature
Who took things calmly underneath his tan,
Since he assumed that all too striking feature
Which marks the “working man.”
Ah me, that Lagos too creates such crises
And lands her traders in these local ruts;
They'll pay the nigger—yes, and raise the prices
Of fats and oils and nuts.
Yet there occurs one thought that's passing pleasant,
Emerging from this state of darkest night:
East may be East, and West be West (at present),
But Black's the same as White.
In a Good Cause.
Mr. Punch ventures to plead once more for the many
poor children of London who need a holiday in the country.
He begs that those whose children are now enjoying their
holiday, or looking forward to it, will not forget the needs
of the less fortunate. Funds are urgently required by the
Children's Country Holiday Fund, and gifts should be sent

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 18th.-The approach
of the holidays found Lord MILNER in
an unusually skittish mood and deter.
mined to act on the schoolboy's maxim,
“Last day but one; take it all in fun."
A propos of the Profiteering Bill Lord
MIDLEToN suggested, not unreasonably,
that the Government should do their
part in keeping down prices, first by
removing the restrictions on imports,
secondly by selling the surplus com-
modities in their own possession, and
thirdly by ceasing to inflate the cur-
rency. But his only reward was to be
heavily chaffed by the temporary Leader
of the House on his sudden reversion
to the doctrines of CoBDEN.
Similarly, when Lord EMMoTT tried at
the eleventh hour to get from the Gov-
ernment an exact definition of “reason-
able profit,” Lord MILNER made no
attempt to satisfy him, but airily quoted
the old saying that “the simplest child
can ask more questions in five minutes
than the wisest man can answer in
a lifetime.” Lord EMMoTT, I fear, did
not appreciate the humour of the com-
parison, for he declared that he had
never heard an important point treated
so cavalierly. But the House as a
whole was not disposed to delay the
adjournment for the sake of making
technical improvements in a measure
generally regarded as being more for
show than for use.
The prospect of hearing the PRIME
MINISTER declare the contents of the
“locked box” drew a large number of
visitors to the House of Commons; and
there was a fair attendance of Members,
although by past experience they
have learned not to expect too much
from these freely-advertised ora-
tions. The SPEAKER, however, was
“unavoidably absent"—a further
proof, in the opinion of the cynics,
of his unfailing wisdom.
A few light turns beguiled the
interval of waiting for the pièce de
résistance. Mr. HARMsworth gal-
lantly defended the accuracy of the
French text of the Peace Treaty
against the critical attacks of
Colonel WALTER GUINNEss, and
pointed out that, right or wrong,
the “exotic syntax” of the Foreign º
Office had nothing to do with it.
To Mr. T. P. O'Connor's help- ?
ful suggestion that the Commer- ?
By way of whetting the appetite
of Members for the vast banquet of
national economy which, according to
the Ministerial Press, was about to
be offered them, Mr. BonAR LAw an-
nounced that Ministers had decided to

relinquish at once the motor - cars
hitherto allotted to them.
If Mr. LLoyd GEORGE had taken his
cue from the cheers that greeted this
noble example of patriotic self-sacrifice,
and at once announced the further steps
which the Government proposed to take
in order to establish financial equilib-
rium I think his speech would have
been more successful. It would cer-
cial Secretaries now being sent to º
South America should acquire a
knowledge of the local tongues Sir
HAMAR GREENwood replied in stri-
dent tones, “Nobody is accredited
as a Commercial Secretary or Con-
sul to any country unless he is a
master of the language.”

tainly have been considerably shorter.
As it was, he devoted the first half
of a three hours' oration to telling us
a great many things of which we were
painfully aware already—such as that
we had spent an enormous amount of
borrowed money, that our national
existence depends upon our foreign
trade, and that we cannot recover it
without increased production.
Then followed some pretty straight
talk to the Labour Party. The pre-
valent fallacy that the less men worked
the more work there would be for others
was vigorously denounced; and the
notion that nationalisation was the way
to industrial peace was critically ex-
amined in the light of the Yorkshire
miners' strike against the State.
But except on this point there was
little of light or leading in the speech.
The “locked box” was opened for a
moment, to let out the announcement
that after September 1st there would
be no more restrictions on imports,
and was banged to again with the
keys—or at least the “key-industries”
—inside it. Vague hints of the Gov-
ernment's intention to cut down ex-
penditure were given, but, as they were
accompanied by a rebuke to those who
had ferreted out instances of depart-
mental extravagance, they did not much
impress a House by this time a little
bored and decidedly sceptical.
There was unusually little applause
during the delivery of the speech, but
plenty at its conclusion. Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE, as he hastily swallowed the
contents of the “pomatum - pot” duti-
fully placed at his elbow by Captain
GUEST, probably attributed the cheers
to the excellence of his peroration.
My own impression is that any old
peroration would have been equally
welcomed.
Tuesday, August 19th. — The
SPEAKER, having made a speedy
recovery, was again in the Chair.
The House learned without enthu-
siasm that more than six hundred
general officers were still employed
at home and overseas. Asked to
say how they were employed, Mr.
FoRSTER begged for notice. It also
appears that some two thousand
five hundred officers and men are
still engaged on anti-aircraft de-
a fence in this country. It is thought
by some Members that they might
usefully be lent to the Treasury to
repel raids on the Exchequer.
On the very eve of the Recess
Mr. HoGGE has discovered a gross
scandal in the Pensions Depart-
ment. There are no fewer than
five Englishmen employed in the
Edinburgh headquarters of the
Ministry. Sir JAMEs CRAIG men-

BATHING PICTORIALLY.
To Men.—Undress; put on bathing
suit; enter sea; stay there a time;
come out; dry; dress.
To Women.—The choice of costume
is of first importance; the sea itself
hardly counts. There was a time when
no costume was required. With the
outbreak of civilisation a garment of
certain dimensions became desirable.
In comparatively recent years the ad-
vent of the photographic newspaper has
created new standards of decency, and
for successful pictorial bathing these
must be conformed to.
Suitably attired (whatever else is
omitted, the bangle above the elbow
must not be forgotten) the bather
should descendslowly from her machine,
for who knows that the Press Photo-
grapher may not be at hand even in this
early stage of her progress? Expert
operators agree, indeed, that for the
photograph of a bather a modern
bathing-machine is a most appropriate
and romantic background.
All posing for photographs in bath-
ing costume should be accompanied by
merry laughter—laughter so unmis-
takable that it can almost be heard
when the reader puts his ear to the
newspaper. The mouth should be well
#. every front tooth (true or false)
glistening white in the sunlight. There
should be no suggestion of having just
swallowed sea-water.
On the way to the water's edge it
would not be amiss to recline grace-
fully on the sand, holding an unlighted
cigarette in the hand that is attached
to the arm with the bangle on (“The
Aſter-Dip Cigarette"). A chat en route
to the sea with some venerable boatman,
with hearty laughter at his remarks,
would make a good picture (“Beauty
and the Beast"). If portrayal as “The
Fair Rescuer" is desired a pet dog (not
necessarily your own) should be seized,
dipped and held up dripping. The bather
should take care that the dog does not
hide her face, and she should laugh un-
restrainedly into the camera.
It is a mistake to go far into the sea,
as the operator is not allowed to charge
for shrunk socks in his expenses. Shal-
low water, or preferably the dry land, is
best for the successful bathing picture.
Observe these rules and you will be
unlucky indeed if before your fortnight
is up your portrait is not exciting
comment in a million British homes.
THE BELFRIES.
IF you should go to La Bassée
Or Bethune, grey and bare,
You'll hear the sweetest bells that play
A faint and chiming air;
And belfries in each little town
Sing out the hour and mark it down.
If you should go to La Bassée
Or walk the Bethune street
You'll see the lorries pass that way
And hear the tramp of feet;
And where the road with trees is lined
You'll watch the long battalions wind.
But all the clocks that mark the time
Are months and years too slow,
And all the bells that ring and chime
Strike hours of long ago,
And all the belfries where you pass
Lie tumbled in the dust and grass.
Yet still the long battalions wind,
Though all the men are gone,
Because one hour has stayed behind
And wanders there alone—
Yes, one heroic shining hour
Chimes on from every fallen tower.

PETER GROWN UP.
I HAD been reading The Young Vis-
iters” (with preface by Sir JAMES
BARRIE) to my young son and daughter.
Both are novelists, Hilary's masterpiece
being named The Petrol Hawk, while
Maureen's first effort has the sibilantly
soothing title of Sylvia's Seven Sweet-
hearts. Their attitude during the
reading was pointedly hostile, as they
were quick to see that the joke was with
“The book throws a light on the per-
verse fortune that may await to-day's
most heedful child, and will be read
eagerly by those of us who are not
afraid to anticipate destiny. As Captain
McHookey says more than once in the
course of the manuscript, “Losh, losh,
my bairn, ilka day is takin' ye nearer to
bein’ deid, as ye micht say.”
“The life of the adult is too little
understood by children. We sometimes
envy them their freedom and authority,
‘I never did naething 'at wasna weel
intended,” says Peter.
“We quote the passage not merely
because it means nothing, but because
it conveys everything. The adult's
smiles of condescension, his attempts
at teasing, his poses in relation to
worldly knowledge—all these find their
apologia in the specimen abstracted.
In the language of this adult, ‘They
ken nae mair than oursels.'

with a cry of horror at
what seemed veritable

He appears to have
been born in Scotland,
where there are hardly
any public schools. His
early education cannot
therefore be the explan-

That he lives in Lon-

publish all he writes,
our readers know al-
ready. It appears how-
ever that he is also the
author of plays in the
English language, prob-
ably translated there-
into by ALEXANDER

Our evidence is flimsy,
but on the back of one
of the sheets of this

notes that revive mem-
ories. Thus there is,
written in capitals, the

It was found in a kitchen in the Adel-

sheet by sheet from a ‘Robert Burns'

the picture which forms the frontispiece
it will be noticed that he has meditative
dreamy eyes. We imagine that he al-

writing of each page, at Mr. GERALD DU

hollow and vain. There is no avoid-
ance of this cognate attitude, but in-
dubitably it is within our power to get
a grip of the adult point of view. No
child merits a moment of compassion
who does not trouble to learn something
of his rulers from their books, and in
certain passages the material is so self-
revelatory that it seems strange that
the gap between child and adult should
not have been bridged long ago.

AT THE PLAY.
RETURN of THE Follies.
The new Follies go nearer to filling
the blank left by the death of Mr. PEL-
Issier and the break-up of his admirable
troupe than I was prepared to find.
Except for Mr. DAN EveRARD (who has
lost nothing of his form) it is an en-
tirely new team. The mantle of the
dead jester fits Mr. BEN LAWEs physi-
cally. He would do well to wear it.
after his own humour and not fall to
the temptation of reconstructing a de-
parted ghost. Loyalty to a charming
memory on his part may cut across an
equal loyalty on ours.
Mr. REx LoNDON does a good deal to
fill the gap left by Mr. LEWIs SYDNEY
of the ape-like antics. He is perhaps
more versatile. Mr. ARTHUR MARGOT-
son, who was a little tame in the kind
of thing the Follies do and always did
less well, the pretty-pretty song and
dance, was quite brilliant in his “Im-
pressions” of music-hall comedians.
Among the pierrettes there is perhaps
a lack of distinctive personality as con-
trasted with their predecessors. Miss
VIVIAN REEs, diseuse, goes nearest to
the old achievement. A certain ner-
vousness, as of folk realising that they
were playing against a prejudice in
their audience in favour of the old firm,
probably hampered the whole team.
It was certainly a severe ordeal. They
came out of it very creditably.
It is a wonderſul testimony to the
wearing qualities of the old Follies
humour that the best numbers were
from old programmes. The music-hall
burlesque is still a gorgeous piece of fun.
Mr. LAwes as Miss May de Colté, who
had been basely deserted by a blue-
blooded toff ; Mr. DAN EveRARD as Mr.
(Fransby Billious, Dickens Imperson-
ator (there was never surely a better
“line” than that appeal addressed from
the gallery to Faqin, over-anxious not
to be hanged —“Be a sport '''); and
Mr. REx LoNDoN, as a basso who swal-
lowed his bottom notes, were all par-
ticularly good. The “Beverage Quar-
tette" (Rum, Port and Zider) had a
new and quite excellent flavour. The
“Smoky Impression"—an outrage, by
the way, in a theatre where the au-
dience are smoked against not smoking
—seemed a little less tuneful than of
old, if memory does not betray me, as
it well may. I would most seriously
beg Mr. LAwks to restore the exqui-
site pathos of the old Follies' first ver-
sion of the “Baked-Potato Man,” and
cut the cheap tom-foolery which after-
wards completely spoiled it. Does he
not realise the value of tragic relief ?
Of the new matter, “Choo Chin
Chow,” millionth performance, was as
good, perhaps it would be a little more
truthful to say almost as good, as any
of the old burlesques. The attenuated
and compressed Mr. AsHE and the in-
definitely expanded Miss LILY BRAYTON
were alone worth the money—to say
nothing of the perfectly superb camel.
I have mentioned Mr. MARGOTSON's
“Impressions.” Let him add to these
as many as he likes. The “Sunday
School Treat,” in which Mr. LONDON
had the rare good sense not to overdo
the curate, and the Russian Ballet, after
HEATH Robinson, were both excellent
and will be better. But the ballad
about the lonerly lady who lost her
way in Somerset and found her way
inner-to somebody else's heart on a
final high note far up in the flies is
the sort of thing our Follies should
be burlesquing, not offering for sale !
Surely I am right 2 Altogether a most
attractive show. T.
CONCERNING RARITIES.
I HAVE met her at last.
For years I have been searching for
her in vain; and yet I knew that she
must be somewhere.
She is in service in a hotel. I should
like to give the name of the hotel, but
such things are not done. There are
journalistic conventions which such
divulgence would fracture. But I can
throw lights, as the acrostic people do.
I can tell you that there is an engrav-
ing after LANDSEER on one of the walls.
But perhaps that is not enough. Very
well, them, I can say that the hotel is
situated in a town in a county which
gives a certain illustrious young traveller
and orator the title of duke. It is situ-
ated in a town with a harbour at whose
entrance are relics of saints, and among
whose most constant yachtsmen is an
artist who has more than once sent to
the Royal Academy a painting of boys
bathing and drying in the sun. Inci-
dentally I may add that last Wednesday
he did not win his race. This town is
an incredible distance from London, in
an easterly direction I don't think. An
old song once said of it that it was a
fine town, with ships in the bay; and it
is, although at the present moment one
of the ships in that bay is a wreck, heel-
ing over on the rocks, a pitiful sight.
Perhaps I have thrown lights enough?
As to the hotel itself, mum must be the
word. Consider me eager to impart
the information, but restrained by fear
and worldly guile deftly blended.
My discovery of this marvellous crea-
ture, this rara avis in terris, as the LoRD
CHANCELLOR, that impenitent Latinist,
would say, was only one of a series of
remarkable events that have marked
the opening of this holiday. For as I
reached the London terminus (whose
name must also be suppressed) some- ||
thing occurred so untoward as, in a
more superstitious nature than my own,
to implant every kind of misgiving and
possibly cause me to abandon my enter-
prise. In the Middle Ages I am sure
it would have been a portent of doom
not to be disregarded.
The cab had drawn up at the foot-
way by the booking-office, and various
porters were moving towards me, when
suddenly, as though at a preconcerted
signal, every one of them let their bar-
rows go and turned and ran in another
direction. At first I thought that a
new lightning strike had set in ; but no,
for once that was a mistake: all that
had happened was that a rat had been
so ill-advised as to make its appearance
and must now be hunted to its end.
How, in the dusk of the evening,
its figure could be so quickly detected
and the glad news so instantaneously
spread I cannot explain, except by refer-
ence to that extra sense which the pur-
suit of four-footed animals can evoke in
the two-footed; but the fact remains
that the chase was in a few seconds
universal. Up and down the pavement
fled the rat; up and down scuttled the
men, with no weapons but boots with
which to kick at the terrified creature,
for a long time in vain, while their
shouts and clamour filled the air.
At last the rat was cornered and des.
patched and the perplexed passengers
and their luggage had a chance.
“Is this,” I asked the flushed and
triumphant sportsman who now con-
sented to attend on me, “a common

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
BECAUSE Mr. Joseph CoNRAD has placed his new work,
The Arrow of Gold (UNWIN), in the turbulent period of the
Carlist rising, you must not allow yourself to anticipate a
story of cut-throat adventure and blood-letting. Adventure
there is indeed, but almost wholly subjective; an affair of
the soul, or rather of the heart. Youth is the keynote of it,
since it is through the dazzled eyes of the lad who was
known as “Mr. George" that we watch this shifting group
of strange and violent characters, camp-followers of con-
spiracy, who revolve about the figure (unseen) of the
Pretender, or that of the woman whose wealth and beauty
dominate both the movement and the story. That adoles-
cent soldier of fortune, Mr. George, was selected by the
plotters to conduct their gun-running, an exploit that he
appears to have conducted with success, but incidentally
and altogether off the stage. It is his passion for Doña
Rita and the gradual drawing together of these two, the
adoring boy and the girl to whom youth had been hitherto
unknown, that make the matter of the tale. Its telling
displays all that richness of effect of which Mr. CoNRAD has
the secret; as usual, his persons move in an atmosphere
that gives to the least of them a dignity almost heroic.
There are two women especially, slightly but unforgettably
portrayed, the pleasant sister of the heroine and an old Re-
publican grande dame, living with exquisite insolence upon
her aristocratic wits, that are as fine as any in the author's
long gallery. About Doña Rita herself, brilliantly coloured
though she is, I remain a thought less convinced. Mr. George,
infatuate, saw her through a mist of worship, which rendered
it natural never to know what she would be at next, or why.
My trouble was a lurking doubt as to whether Mr. CoNRAD
was always any better informed.
I fear that Through a Tent Door (MURRAY) may suffer
somewhat in popularity through appearing at a time when
active-service books are slightly in eclipse. It would be a
pity if the many admirable qualities of Dr. R. W. MAC-
KENNA's work missed their reward. Perhaps you may
know already the two previous volumes of his reflections,
The Adventure of Death and The Adventure of Life. Here
he has set down certain comments and sketches of what he
might have called (but doesn't) the Adventure of War,
drawn from his experiences as a hard-worked medical
officer in the fore-front, in fact several fore-fronts, of the
battle. They are most of them slight things, giving the
effect of having been transferred to paper in “odd and
broken moments;" all but one, the writer tells us, are true
in substance. Perhaps he will forgive me for adding that
the exception is by some way the least impressive and
moving. Because Dr. MACKENNA has looked out from
his bell-tent upon a world made unspeakably hideous by
War, but redeemed by patient endurance and heroism ;
because, in fact, he sees the fighting from the viewpoint
of one who had to mend, if possible, its ghastly wounds, it
is only to be expected that this record of his impressions
should be sombre. He writes indeed with a passionate
and angry sympathy that it would be easy, and false, to
call sentiment. So his book is hardly a cheerful one-
on the face of it; though, besides the gloom and horror,

it conveys, more clearly, I think, than any I have read,
the spirit of ungrudging sacrifice, of heroism without the
limelight, which his position enabled him to see and his
sympathy to understand.
Mr. IAN HAY is a model of discretion, and in The Last
Million (HopDER AND STOUGHToN) he says much that is
charming and much that is wise. His mission here is to
conduct the American Army, or a select portion of it, over
a perplexing but patriotic England, and dump them on
the battle-zones of France. It would be impossible to
find a cheerier cicerone or one capable of apologising with
more humour and tact for the eccentricities of Great Britain,
while constantly reminding the United States that we too
had a share in the Great War. He is at his best, I think,
in explaining the methods of fighting, both general and
particular, which the contending armies employed in 1918.
This he does with an intelligibility and accuracy that other
writers—more technical or more romantic—might well envy.
In the actual incidents which he describes he is not always
so successful. There is a good account of a trench raid in
the American sector, but the visit of two hospital nurses
not plausible. Nor is the introduction (made in a quite
casual manner, as if it were more or less a matter of ordi-
nary routine) of the suicide of one of them who has loved
“too much and too wildly.” One can drift a good distance
away from the paths of one's early teachers without caring
to see good men travestied, and cheapened.
My only grievance about Miss MARJoRIE Bowen's Crimes
of Old London (ODHAMs)—London of the rapier and sedan-
chair—is that the crimes, a subject I dearly love, fill hardly
more than half the book, and then are short stories about
crimes rather than the carefully documented relations I had,
gratuitously perhaps, led myself to expect. I thought that
Miss BowFN, who is quite at home with musty old records
and has a particular talent for detailed reconstruction,
would have done this sort of thing so well. I rather think
too—but here, haply, my ignorance betrays me—that they
are, most of them, if not all, mere short stories out of her
head, not embroideries of actual fact. They are not un-
interesting—on the contrary; but they lack the authentic
air. And I am bloodthirsty enough to demand real, not
imaginary, murders. The dissertations on the Seven Deadly
to the front line seems
a little out of place
and a c on c e s sion
rather to the film-
ſanciers than to the
demands of the Anglo-
Saxon entente. Nor
do I care very much
for such phrases as
“stretcher - bearers

who is unwilling to
give America due credit for her share in the final triumph,
this is undoubtedly the stuff to give them.
In a “Coda" to The Bonfire (HEINEMANN), of which the
scene is set in a Jesuit school in England, Mr. ANTHoNY
BRENDON explains that he has tried to “present the recog-
nition by the Jesuits of the spiritual values of life” and
also to protest against the teaching of hell-fire to children.
The book has an interest mainly for those who have been
educated by the Jesuits and those outsiders who have
a fairly serious interest in their spiritual system and edu-
cational method. For Kensitites the fathers in these
pages are in the main too virtuous and harmless to be
interesting. For the guileless reader I must enter a caveat.
It would be difficult to maintain that any incidents or
characters, in this disjointed tale are impossible; but
they are often extremely unlikely, and the whole emphasis
seems to be wrong. An abnormally sensitive boy like Luke
Trevor might have had his life darkened by the thought
of hell-fire, but though, at the date roughly indicated,
very horrible pictures of a material hell were painted by
zealous preachers it wasn't by any means a hell-fire religion
that was taught. These studies of priests haunted by the
fear of death, or being confoundedly astute or talking of
love to their pupils in the way old Father Joe does, are
they may be right; but the fact remains that to read it
is to obtain refreshment and repose. Mr. HoweL Evans
is as it were president of a society for protecting his
pleasant people from being unduly preyed upon and
maltreated, and I am glad to enrol myself as a member of
that fraternity. It would have been a thousand shames if
the Harbotts and their faithful servant, and “Ma” Millner,
and Reggie Kemp and the rest of these attractive folk had
met with more than temporary ill-luck. In the course of
this leisurely novel we are introduced to music-hall artistes
(I like especially the man who could lift a donkey with
his teeth), tramps, rogues male and female, and all sorts
of curious people. They seem to belong to a world which
has almost been forgotten, and I suggest that those who
cannot go on a holiday at present should at least get a
change of atmosphere by reading Crabtree House.
From a cinema advertisement:—
“A special attraction, “Adventures among the Cannibals,” in which
one is introduced to a strange tribe which is rapidly dying out.
Possibly the very monotonous diet upon which they feed—fish, cocoa-
nuts and stagnant and salty water drawn from a hole in the ground
—is the cause. Unless this simple race receives assistance from the
outside world it will soon die out.”—Local Paper.
It seems a case for missionary enterprise.

THE PASSING OF THE WHITEHALL FLAPPER.
A FAREwBLL FROM A DEPARTMENTAL, HEAD.
The PRIME MINISTER, in a letter to the various Government Offices,
has pointed out to heads of departments that unless they remove
superfluous employees they will have to be removed themselves.]
Now for the last time, on official duty,
The powdered joy-puff to your nose apply:
And through the mist of tears that veils its beauty
Give me, for this last time, the old glad eye;
Never again, fulfilled of tea and crumpet,
Here through your prattling lips shall laughter flow ;
LLOYD GEORGE has spoken (almost like a trumpet),
And you have got to go.
Farewell! the happy, happy, times are over!
But please don't put this down to me, my dears;
I would have kept you on like pigs in clover,
Steadily on for years and years and years;
I had no option—just a moment's sick doubt,
Then conscience showed me where the right course lay;
“Kick,” said the Voice from Deauville, “or be kicked out !”
And I arranged to stay. O. S.
A LOSING HAZARD.
OF course Frederick ought not to have been there at all.
For one thing, regulations were dead against it, and for
another his bank balance had been ordered complete rest for
at least a month. The atmosphere of a Casino is notori-
ously unhealthy for a weak and ailing bank-balance.
However, he was there, watching the croupier pass his
magic wand over the green cloth, and noting figures with a
stub of pencil on an envelope back. Percival interrupted
him in a calculation involving the misuse of five figures.
“Don’t do it, Frederick, old légume,” he said. “These
strenuous mental exercises are too trying for a mere nursling
like you.”
“S-h-h!” said Frederick, ticking off units on his fingers
and tens on his thumbs. “I'm working out a system.”
“’Nother recruit for the army of Cox's disinherited,”
groaned Percival. “Don't you know the management fat-
tens on people who invent chance-tight systems? Every
time they see a new system coming along they buy a new
safe to hold the proceeds. Save the money to buy some-
thing useful—such as Egyptian cigarettes or pink thirst-
quenchers.” -
“If you don't speculate you don't accumulate,” replied
Frederick, borrowing the vocabulary of the Crown and
Anchor expert. “Foller my system an' you comes in
wheel-barrows an' goes away in motor-cars. I hoffers
my clients—meaning you, Percival—a chawnce of money
for nothink, and I only ask the loan of fifty francs to
provide the necessary capital.”
“If I refuse to lend it, my cheery old bank-smasher,” said
Percival, “you will ever hold it as a reproach over me that
I stood between you and untold wealth. If, on the other
hand, I lend it, I may retain your friendship but lose
the money. Therefore I take a last farewell to this note
and hand it to you. But don't ask me to wait and see it
sacrificed to the system. I regard it as dead, but I don't
feel called on to attend the funeral.” -
They met the following day at lunch, but Frederick bore
no visible signs of opulence.
“Probably I am touching on a painful subject,” said
Percival, “but I am curious to know how long the fifty
francs kept afloat before it finally sank.”
“It didn't sink—at least not all of it.
The system
worked beautifully.”
“I don't see notes fluttering from you like autumn leaves,
and I observe you are drinking water. Did your arithmetic
let you down? I know you aren't highbrow stuff at the
ciphering.”
“No, it all worked out like the staff plans for an Aldershot
sham-fight or the menu at a Brigade dinner—not a single
hitch. But I'll tell you from the beginning.
“If you remember, the tables were pretty crowded. I
got my money changed, and the system was all tuned up
ready to start off by itself. The only thing that gave me
the chilly spine was the fear that the Old Man or some of
the red tabs might come in and spot me. 'Course there
would be no harm if I was just watching, but if the Old
Man spotted me playing there would be the uncle and aunt
of a wiggin' for little Freddy."
Percival nodded sapiently. “I’ve had some,” said he.
“Now, if there is one thing we have learned in this War
it is the art of digging in and fighting behind cover, so I
reconnoitred the ground and selected a tactical position
behind a fat Frenchwoman and her husband. Having dug
myself in I used indirect fire over Madame's shoulder to
get my stakes on the table. Naturally it would be necessary
to come out into the open to collect my winnings, but the
idea of my system is that you hang behind and keep drop-
ping francs all along the course, and then you double up
and come in with a big scoop at the finish. Compree ?”
“Old fruit, the Prince of Monaco buys a new diamond
every year for the crown jewels out of that system.”
“He can't. It's my invention and I've got the patent
rights. But to continue. I'd been pegging away dropping
francs on Numéro Huit till thirty of our fifty had gone, and
I'd laid the remaining twenty to bring off my big scoop.
The ball rolled round and round, trembled on the edge of
the eight and * >
“Rolled into the five.”
“No, it didn't. It rested like a cuckoo on the eight,
and the croupier pushed a hundred-and-forty francs to my
side of the table. I was just emerging from cover to pick
it up when I spotted the Old Man on the other side of the
º: glaring in my direction. I could tell he hadn't seen
me, but he was looking to see who it was had pulled off
the maximum. What was I to do?” -
“I dunno. What were you?”
“Don't ask silly conundrums. I daren't piek up the
money and give myself away. Better to lose the one-forty
than imperil my gratuity. Then I had a sudden inspiration
—you know how they come over me—and I whispered in
my best French into the ear of the fat amiable French-
woman who was camouflaging me: ‘Will you have the
kindness, Madame, to continue gambling for me—for luck?
I shall return in a few minutes.’
“‘ Volontiers, M'sieur,” she answered.
“I bent down and slipped out of the room, and in ten
minutes I returned to see her emerging from the salon
with her husband. She threw up her hands with a gesture
worthy of BERNHARDT herself.
“‘Je suis désolée, M'sieur !' she said. "J'ai perdu tout!
“Frederick, old mutt,” said Percival with emotion, “if
the charm of your society were not more precious than all
the fifty francses in the world I'd jump on you with both
feet. I heard the Old Man telling the Adjutant just now
that the restrictions on gaming were not being enforced
during Joy-time, and he'd had a flutter last night and won
two thousand francs.”

THE OLD HOMESTEAD.
(In grateful remembrance of the daily
New England life in American novels.)
Maisie Clapshaw awoke with a jump
as the alarm clock beside her bed com-
menced to ring. It was four o'clock
and she had almost over-slept. She
began to dress quickly, for there were
the chores to do, a turnover to be baked
for breakfast and the buggy to be pol-
ished, for Mrs. Clapshaw still kept the
old farm going, though her husband—
“Hard-fisted Jim " he had been nick-
named in the old days—had died last
Fall.
Maisie slipped on her plain gingham
gown. It was quite colourless, and had
been turned so many times that she
had forgotten which side was which.
It had belonged to each of her seven
sisters in turn, all of whom had turned it.
She thought of each of them as she went
downstairs. There was Jinny, who had
married a rich man and had never done
the chores since. There was Susy, who
had gone to teach in Boston—Maisie
remembered she had worn a pair of
light-brown shoes which squeaked ;
she remembered the squeak quite well.
Then there were Minnie and Winnie,
the twins: Winnie had died of bron-
chitis, and Jim Clapshaw—Hard-fisted
Jim—had cried like a child. Then there
were Bridget, Daisy and Mollie. As
she reached the bottom of the stairs
she realised she had remembered them
all. When she entered the kitchen she
began to think of her eight brothers.
She remembered them all by name and
thought of something characteristic of
each.
Soon she had the fire going and was
washing clothes, baking the turnover,
sweeping, sorting the tea-leaves and
doing the numerous things she had
done since childhood.
At seven o'clock they breakfasted
simply in the big kitchen. On the
table, which was scrupulously clean,
there were two tea-cups, two saucers,
a basin of coarse brown sugar, a china
tea-pot, four plates, two knives, two
forks, a bowl of curds and whey, a large
loaf of home-made bread, a dish of last
year's pickled nasturtium seeds, a salt-
cellar and the now crisply-browned turn-
over. When breakfast was over, Maisie
cleared away the things while her
mother made the beds, counted the
chicks, hoed the onions, tossed the hay
and plaited a straw hat for Maisie.
Then, when the buggy and horses had
been groomed and the sedge gathered
and put to dry, Maisie made some sweet
wine of apple-juice and nicotine and
designed a dress for herself out of an
old curtain. As the morning wore on
she began to make preparations for
dinner. The location of the farm was
remote and so she killed and plucked a
home-grown fowl, carefully saving the
feathers for a pillow for her mother as
a surprise for Thanksgiving Day. While
the bird was roasting she set about
freezing a custard, oiling the vinegar
and churning some butter. After din-
ner there was the sheep-shearing, the
long wool to be separated from the
short, eggs to be hatched, chestnuts to
be canned and all the daily routine of
the Old Homestead to be gone through
before sundown.
For supper Maisie made a dumpling
of the cold fowl and knocked up a pud-
ding from the chestnut-rinds over from
the canning. After supper she and her
mother sat quietly hemming dusters
and singing the songs that they had all
sung since childhood.
When Maisie retired to bed she set
her alarm clock carefully for four o'clock,
eager to begin the work of another day.

others can wait.
The voucher arrived this morning
neatly made out in triplicate–Army
Form G.982, if you must know. Now
the receipt of a voucher in the Army
is not a matter to be dealt with lightly,
like receiving the morning's milk or
the Freedom of the City. There's al-
ways a chance that the other fellow
has left something out, the “Period of
account" or the “Mode of conveyance"
or the “Number of sheets forming this
voucher.” If so you write him a letter
beginning “It is not understood,” and
that makes you one up on him for the
O.B.E. Of course if you don't spot the
omission then by-and-by the Audit or
the Treasury or the O. iſc Waste Pro-
ducts twitches one into you commenc-
ing “Please explain,” and that leaves
you one down.
I summoned the chief clerk, the
foreman in charge of the pattern-room
and the blue-eyed boy who coaxes the
telephone, and we gave that voucher
the once over. It was absolutely air-
tight, the real Peruvian doughnuts, as
they say in New York, and then some.
“PINS, SAFETY 2: SAMPLES.”
He was a crafty man who thought
of that “samples." Had it not been
there I should certainly have taken his
middle stump with an “It is not under-
stood,” inquiring whether they were
“Pins, safety, Q.M.R.A.F., overseas de-
tachments only,” or “Pins, safety, non-
corrosive, Submarine Miners' Trousers,
for the suspension of.” But he was
no fool, the fellow who compiled that
voucher. (“Accessories, Anti-Gas"),
he had added. There was no getting
away from that.
And all the rest was perfect. The

Thus, “Description of Package” was

payers, all too long the palpitating
victims of pin - profiteers. You will
therefore exhibit these two sample pins,
these Gemini of Pindom, to such of the
public as may call to inquire about
them, not omitting to point out that
the minimum number of pins which
can be sold to any one customer is
thirteen tons. Note further that they
are anti-gas pins, which no doubt en-
hances their value. If you can't sell

you therefore proceed at once, and
choking back your emotions, to take
them upon Ledger Charge. Prepare
also and with all the customary for-
malities a nice fresh Tally. Further,
omit not to record their presence upon
the Weekly Stock-sheet. Lastly, as
there may be some possibility of their
being mistaken for one another, attach
to each a strong label bearing respec-
tively an inscription as follows:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GLOBE-TROTTER.
As I fingered the Sheldon-Browns'
invitation for the week-end to their
place at Shepperley a sort of feeling
came over me as if my withers were
being wrung. No doubt I think it
must have been caused by jealousy,
for Gunter, so ſucy Sheldon-Brown
said in her letter of invitation, was to
be of the party.
I had heard of Gunter but had never
met him. I understood him to be a
globe-trotter and rather épris with
Lucy. No doubt he had told her
and lie freely about without fear of
detection.”
Slamming my cue into the rack, for
my blood was up into the high num-
bers, I strolled over to the sofa and sat
down heavily on the other side of Lucy.
Gunter scowled.
Mastering my feelings, I smiled and
said almost sweetly, “Borneo? Yes,
lovely place, isn't it?” -
Gunter started. “You have been
there?” he said, in a tone that seemed
to imply a sceptical attitude.
This sent my blood further up till it
touched the top and rang the bell. I
I said dreamily, “and you probably
wouldn't know the little village that
was my objective.”
Gunter made a peculiar noise in his
throat. “Sara-Sarawak 2 " he asked.
“I only stayed a night there,” I said
airily. “I trekked into—er—Southern
Borneo. Quite the wildest part —
what ?”
“Quite, I should say,” Gunter agreed;
“though I have not been further than
Sarawak.”
“This is money for nothing,” I said
inwardly, “This is where I begin to
get the bulge on Gunter.” Aloud I
travellers' tales. These things
always captivate women.
On Friday my eye caught a
somewhat similar advertisement
to the one reproduced in the
pages of Punch (issue of July
16th), which offered foreign
hotel labels for swank-potting
purposes. -
“I too,” I said, “will be a
globe-trotter and biff the odious
Gunter with his own petard.”
So I wrote for a sample set of
labels of out-of-the-way places
(so as to avoid running into
Gunter, as it were, if possible)
and received what was described
as “Series 14,” which included
the labels of hotels at Marseilles,
Cairo (Shepheard's Hotel, the
only one I knew by name out of
the twelve labels sent),Colombo,
Sarawak, and several other
Oriental spots. “Sarawak,” I
said, “is my trump-card, I
think.”
Having arranged the whole
series very artistically on the
torso of my kit-bag I travelled
down to Shepperley on Friday
evening. The Sheldon-Browns
(père et fille), Gunter and I
formed the house-party.

said, “Never been further than
Sarawak 2 My dear fellow, you
don't begin to know Borneo till
you've been up-country, into
| the er—the hinterland.”
Gunter winced a distinct
wince at my evident familiarity
with my subject.
“You simply must tell me all
about it,” Lucy urged, turning
a nicely powdered back on the
odious Gunter. I couldn't resist
such an urge.
“So far as I remember,” I
said slowly, “when I left Sara-
wak I took the first turning to
the left and followed the path
leading to the mountains, which
run along the centre of the
island" (the map had shown me
these). “After taking this path
for about one hundred and
thirty-five miles or so I turned
to the right, where the roads
divide, and, after walking over
mountains and valleys for about
another two hundred and fifty
miles I came to a village. Here
I distinctly recollect that I had
to ask the way. The headman
could speak a kind of Lingua
Franca, and with that and a few
signs and wonders I managed
The conversation at dinner that
night was not particularly geographical.
True, Scarborough was mentioned, and
Widnes was lightly touched upon, but
I was quite at home in these latitudes
and held my own with Gunter.
But after dinner we retired to the
billiard-room, and whilst I played a
hundred up with old Sheldon-Brown,
Gunter snookered Lucy in a corner and
took her (in imagination) to the far
corners of the earth.
The game was just over and old
Sheldon - Brown had gone off on a
search, probably fruitless, for whisky,
when I heard Gunter say something
about Borneo.
“Surely,” I said to myself, “this
globe-trotting bounder might have left
one corner of the world unguntered,
one little spot that I could call my own
saw red and other colours in several
shades, but I still managed to smile.
“Er—yes, some years ago,” I said.
“Top-hole place.”
“Oh, do tell me about it,” said Lucy.
What else could I do? Such girls
as Lucy Sheldon-Brown do not grow
on every family tree. Gunter should
not oust me from Borneo without a
struggle.
“Which way did you go?” said
Gunter.
“Oh, the usual route,” I said, “Mar-
seilles, Cairo (Shepheard's Hotel there,
of course), Colombo and—and the way
you probably went.” -
“Very likely,” said Gunter. “And
whereabouts did you stay in Borneo?”
he asked, his voice apparently trembling
with emotion.
“It's—er—rather a long time ago,”

name of the wretched little village—

chiefly huts—and palm-trees, of course.”
“Oh, of course,” Gunter said in an
endeavour not to be out of the scene.
“And of course Dyaks.”
“Naturally,” said Gunter.
“Some of their customs,” I continued
with confidence, “are very quaint; for
instance ->
But my apparent familiarity with
such outlandish regions and their in-
habitants was evidently too much for
Gunter, who rose at this point and
went off to help old Sheldon - Brown
to find the whisky, he said. So I spent
a pleasant hour teaching Lucy the use
of “the long rest” (entailing several
hand-holds) and inventing manners
and customs for the Dyaks for which

they would probably not thank me.
She was thrilled, and as Gunter didn't
return I concluded that either the
whisky was found or that he had gone
to bed in disgust.
By the time Gunter and I left by
the 9.27 for Town on Monday morning
(nothing but the infrequency of trains
made us companions) I was several up
on him; but I was heartily thankful
that during the journey he avoided the
subject of foreign travel. In fact, he
buried himself in his newspaper. I
read mine.
As we neared King's Cross I noticed
him staring at my bag in the rack
above my head. I retaliated instantly
by staring at his bag in the rack above
his head. He sighed; I sighed. His
sigh sounded like one of relief. I don't
know if mine sounded like a sigh of
relief or a peace-night peas-bladder at
the point of death, but it was certainly
caused by relief. For Gunter's bag,
like mine, was plastered with an un-
deniably genuine set of “Series 14”
labels.

LOCAL COLOURISTS.
HARDLY enough attention has been
paid to the announcement that Mr.
Lytton STRACHEY has taken a flat in
Kensington Gore, facing the Albert
Memorial, with the obvious purpose of
steeping himself in an atmosphere at-
tuned to the composition of his long
threatened Life of Queen Victoria.
There was a time, not so very long
ago, when hasty critics condemned the
practice of writers who studied local
colour as a preliminary to creation.
No doubt these preparations were some-
times crudely and hurriedly undertaken,
but the method has never failed to
commend itself to the true artist and
has never found more conscientious ex-
ponents than at the present day.
For example, Mr. Roger FRY, who
is engaged on an epoch-making mono-
graph on Mr. AUGUSTU's JoHN, has de-
cided to spend six months in Rome and
six months in Wales, in order to satur-
ate himself, first, in the magnificentia
Itomac, which inspires our great artist's
colossal cartoons and is adumbrated
in his Pagan praenomen; and, second,
in the Celtic fervour which is his family
heritage and is exhaled from his mighty
and monosyllabic surname.
Mr. CHARLEs WHIBLEY, whose l’ar-
allel Lives of Lord CHATHAM and Lord
North CLIFFE are approaching com-
pletion, alternates visits to his dainty
bungalow on Mount Carmel with resi-
dence in Pitt Street, Campden Hill.
Dr. BRIDGES' great work on the
prosody of CHARLEs LAMB is now in
the press. It is interesting to know
that during its preparation the LAURE-
ATE lived partly in Shepherd Market,
partly on Shepherd's Hill, Highgate,
and latterly on Mint Pavement. Tab-
lets to commemorate his sacrifices in
the interests of biographical realism
will no doubt be erected by the Royal
Society of Arts.

HOLIDAY TOSHI.
By THEoDosLA,
Contributor of “Tea-Cup Twaddle" to
“The Peeress,” and of “Boudoir Bab-
blings" to “The Flapper.”
ALL the world's away to the sea, the
mountains and the moor, and we, the
world's better half, are askin' ourselves
now as ever the biggest question in life,
“How can I look young and lovely 2”
For girls who've been girls some
time and who've got a worried look
'long of readin' all the frightful things
in the papers 'bout what's happened,
what's happenin', and what's goin' to
happen, I don't advise the seaside.
The glare, salt winds, “What are the
wild waves saying 2 " 'n' all that sort
of thing are a bit tryin' and unbecomin'.
But if you must go take one of Falla-
lerie's “Seaside Beauty Baskets,” which
contain simply everything for keeping
the hair safe from the winds, the 'plex-
ion safe from the glare, and in short
for keeping the seaside quite at arm's
length ! Sounds 'surdly contradictory,
doesn't it? To go to the sea and take
all these precautions against it! But
we women are contradictory—it's part
of our charm. -
Lady Flutterwell, who did such 'stra-
ordinarily good work during the War
in runnin' a dance-hall for Allied troops
at Escapadeville, is having a lovely rest
time at her place in the Isle of Wight.
She's a big party there, and I hear of
rippin' beach-dances by moonlight, or
starlight, or whatever old thing is on
duty in the sky, when bathin'-kit is
worn and all the jewels. That fasci-
natin' uncanny creature, Twirlinsky, of
the Russian Ballet, is of the party and
is generally Lady Flutterwell's beach-
partner.
Seems to me the heat-wave's been
used, like charity, to “cover a multi-
tude of what-d'-you-call-'ems.” People
have been 'scusin' themselves on ac-
count of it for lots of little lapses'
Poor old heat-wavel It's been worked
for all it was worth. No wonder it
struck at last. It had more reason
than those miner creatures who won't
mine. Best heat-wave story I've heard
comes from Tatterly Towers, where a
famous Family Ghost does stunts in
the Haunted Corridor of the disused
wing. There was a houseful of guests
of the effervescin' brand, and rumours
got about of ghostly figures being seen
in the park at unholy hours. “What's
this I hear about something bein’ seen
in the park in the middle of the night 2"
asked Lord Tatterly, who 's dull and
heavy and believes in the Family Ghost.
Answered Lady T., who's the opposite
of heavy and doesn't believe in any-
thing, “Easy to guess what it is. The
heat-wave again. Can't expect the
poor Family Ghost to stay in the
Haunted Corridor in this weather.
'Course the poor thing comes out into
the park.”
Glad to hear their impressions of our
dear naughty old Babylon from provin-
cial friends who're invadin' London.
Yes, “Rustica,” St. Paul's is a large
building and, as you say, it's got a
dome. It's ever so far more import-
ant, “Country Cousin,” than seeing all
those funny old Towers and Abbeys
and Museums and things that you
should get yourself a frock at Fragolet's
(Sloane Street) and an Anne Dixon
hat (Hanover Square). -
Blew up to town the other day
on biz and positively saw some People,
with a big P, in the deserted village.
Mrs. “Croppy” Chaloner was in Bond
Street, just back from a tour of the
battlefields, lookin' fitter than ever and
still wearin' her “Battlefield Tour”
kit. It's Désiré's last word in tailor-
mades, and if you get one don't forget
that a rather serious look's worn with
it. "Fraid it sounds heartless, but what
we've got to be is modern, isn't it?

SIDE-LINES.
DR. BEATTIE CRozier has astonished
friends and admirers by revealing, in a
series of articles in a London evening
paper, that in his earlier days he was
a patron of the prize-ring, numbering
many famous boxers among his inti-
mates.
A rival newspaper, we understand,
has made a generous offer to Sir
WILLIAM ORPEN for half-a-dozen short
snappy articles on “My Romantic
Adventures as a Press Photographer;”
but the editor of the Church Family
Newspaper had been unable to persuade
Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY to contribute
to the pages of that journal a few
papers on “My Investigations in the
Realm of Comparative Theology;” and
there is still some doubt whether Mrs.
HUMPHRY WARD will entertain the sug-
gestion that she should contribute a
short series of “Practical Hints on Race-
horse Training” to The Winning Post.
A Fair Warning.
“To be Let, Furnished Service House; 2

“Londoners may be contorted by the assur-
ance that their city is not always the hottest
place in a heat wave.”—Evening Paper.
Quite true. We went into a perfect
kink of laughter when we read it.

petitor at the –swimming gala on Thursday.

A little accident of that kind often
conduces to rapidity of movement.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Local Fishmonger (as exasperating batsman is at last disposed of). “'E's FILLETED !”
CENTRAL THEATRE IDEALS.
At the close of the Drama League
Conference at Stratford-on-Avon a
meeting was held by the newly-formed
Central Theatrical Party to discuss the
aims and policy of the movement.
Sir Stollery Skrine, who occupied the
Chair, said he wanted to see throughout
the country a virile theatre, racy of the
soil, yet animated by the highest uplift,
combining the abandon of the Restora-
tion stage with the austere dignity of
the AEschylean drama, the “spoof" of
the film with the intensity of IBSEN.
Mr. Ernest Grhys stated that the aim
of the Central Theatrical Party was to
effect a synthesis of the Great and the
Little Theatres. Standing outside a
bookshop in the Brompton Road he had
just put down a copy of SHAKSPEARE's
works, when a young man picked it up
and made the casual remark, “SHAK-
sPEARE has too much jaw for me.” That
young man touched the spot. But even
the old dramatists had no monopoly of
prolixity. If he might say so without
offence, even Mr. SHAw had too much
jaw. Concentration, condensation, com-
pression was the clamant need of the
hour, and a new lease of life was being
conferred on SHAKSPEARE by the enter-
prise of the film-producer. Already
The Merchant of Venice had been re-
duced to its true perspective in the car-
toon burlesque of Mr. AsToN DYER, and
the process of jaw-extirpation had been
taken in hand by Mr. KENELM Foss,
who proposed every year to direct two
“super-productions” based on the works
not only of SHAKSPEARE, but of DICKENs,
THACKERAY, SHERIDAN and STEvDNSoN.
The appeal to the eye was superseding
the appeal to the ear. The tyranny of
elocution was at an end, and the theatre
was now thrown open to the deaf and
dumb. It was indeed a hopeful sign
of the times that people no longer spoke
of going “on the stage,” but “on the
screen.”
Mr. Java Ongtong, a student from the
Solomon Islands, welcomed the toler-
ant spirit of the preceding speakers.
To run a doctrinaire theatre insisting
on one form of art would be a great mis-
take. The ideal theatre should appeal
to all types—dolicocephalic, brachy-
cephalic and mesocephalic. He him-
self belonged to the central or mesoce-
phalic type. Nothing gave him greater
pleasure than to read in the issue of
The Times for August 26th the noble
utterance of its musical critic that “the
devil as bogy is now quite an anachro-
nism" and that he is “a maligned and
essentially misunderstood personality.”
Mr. Brigham Younger, home from
the Mormonsk Front, noted with satis-
faction, as a further evidence of this
enlightened tolerance, that in the same
issue of The Times a writer had ex-
pressed his approval of a play in which
“the unsuccessful lover played his part
so well that one can only regret that
the lady could not accept them both.”
The horizons of the drama were con-
stantly expanding. Art was long, but,
like a play of ARISTOPHANES, it ought
to be as broad as it was long. The
Central Theatrical Party should always
be in touch with the circumference.
During the discussion which followed
views were expressed from Tahiti, Tierra
del Fuego, Tibet, Oklahoma and Rili-
manjaro.
“Outfitters maintain that legitimate pecu-
lation is worthy of reward.”—Daily Paper.
We had already gathered that from
their “Accounts rendered.”

Philipson is in the Air Ministry. I
often wondered what his job was. Last
Saturday I found out. We were to
spend the afternoon together, so I
strolled round to his office about mid-
day to take him off with me. -
He looked anxious when I entered,
but obviously pleased to see me.
The next moment a telephone bell
rang.
“Confound my luck!” said Philipson
as the message came through. “I’m
awfully sorry, old man, but it's all off.”
“What's the trouble 2 " I asked, for
you must remember we had long ago
settled down to the ways of peace and
resented any interference with our Sat-
urday afternoons. -

swered, looking unspeakably dismal.

the cause of your distress?”
“You won't understand,” he answered;
“but Jones and Robinson have flown
from Timbuctoo to Karachi.”
“Do you mean there has been an
accident 2 " I asked sympathetically.
“Oh, dear, no,” he said with a sigh;
and seeing my genuine concern he leant
over and whispered confidentially, “I
have to send the telegrams.”
“Do you?” I said, rather interested.
“For the whole bunch,” he added
hoarsely.
“Really,” said I, a little impatient,
for I wanted to hear his trouble.
“It’s awful!” he exclaimed with such
intensity that I blurted out, “What?”
“Sending the telegrams,” he hissed.
He was obviously upset—overworked
perhaps. I would humour him. I
asked him how many he represented.
He took down a typed list, starting,
I think, with the Secretal y of State—
a mere half-dozen.
I laughed and offered to do the lot
off the reel. - -
A curious smile curled on his lip (like
CARSoN's smile when a mere English-
man tries to provide for Ireland), but
he let me try.
I started, “Congratulations on a fine
performance.” His arms fell limply to
his sides and he looked as a Futurist
might look at a pre-Raphaelite, or a
woman at another solemnly suggesting
a return to crinolines. -
“‘Fine!’” he said with terrible scorn,

“AND now, Cyril,” said Mary, when

We had been holding a belated strafe
of our household possessions at No. 34,
Nestling Court, and it was the higgledy-

had no further use that had inspired
her remark.
“Sell'it,” I replied at once. “Pro-

The stool and I broke away to-

THE LATEST DISEASE.
(By our Medical Expert.)
THE news that a strange and
unfamiliar malady has mani-
fested itself in Normandy must
be received with a certain amount
of reserve, in view of the facts
that so far the symptoms have
only developed themselves fully
in one patient, and that experts
differ as to whether they indicate
a mental or a physical cause.
The former view is strongly sup-
ported by Professor Oppenheim,
who describes the disease as
“developing exclusively or prin-
cipally on the basis of the neuro-
time the centre court there was not
considered central in her absence.
“No," she replied, “for a change
I'm going to try a sale.”
“How brave of you!” I cooed.
“Aren't you a teeny bit afraid of
floating mines?"—for it was impos-
sible to connect the dainty Messa-
lina with the commercial variety of
sale. She seemed too fragile for the
task.
“Go on," was my natural com-
ment when she explained how she
really intended passing the after-
In OOn.
“Yes," she said, “I want some fur-
niture,” and she picked up the settee
and stood idly swinging it in her

“What,” I exclaimed — “where
Cyril and Mary live I was at school
with him. It only seems yesterday
that I tied a clove-hitch in the tail
of his white mouse. He's honest,
Cyril is. What is it he's selling?”
“I especially want his two-piece
toast-rack. No breakfast-table can
look dainty without it. You must
come and breakfast with me when I
et it.”
“Delighted!” I murmured. “Shall
I come before lunch, or after ?”
“And,” she resumed, “he has
just the arm-chair I want. One
pathic diathesis.” Amongst exciting
causes emotional disturbances—fear,
etc.—take first place, and it has been
found necessary to prohibit the unre-
stricted perusal of newspapersof a pessi-
mistic or inflammatory type. Per contra
Sir Lionel Hotchkiss attributes the tem-
porary loss of vision by which the disease
is attended to a deficient percentage of
red blood corpuscles in the pedal ex-
tremities and a consequent refrigeration
of the tootsicums. He has accordingly
registered the new disorder at Stationers'
Hall as “Retrench fever.” He further
points out the curious fact that the
symptoms are never so acute as in a
patient who has previously suffered
from a prolonged wasting fever.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE Voice, FROM THE MINARET."
WHEN a man is sharing a luxurious
suite in an Oriental hotel with some-
body else's wife it is always rather a
bore to have a minaret immediately
commanding that suite, with a muezzin
on it calling the faithful to prayer at
fixed intervals of the day and night.
(The minaret in Mr. HIcHENs' play
seemed to be lower than most minarets
and almost leaned up against the bal-
cony of the sinful pair.). But, if he
happens at the moment to be making a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land as a pre-
paration for taking Holy Orders the
proximity of the minaret may be worse
than a bore; it may tend to remind
him painfully of his lapse from virtue.
That was the trouble with Andrew
Fabian, and that was also the trouble
with his partner, Lady Caryll (who by a
curious irony was herself on a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land, a diversion in which
she had indulged while on her way home
from India to make arrangements for
divorcing her husband). Not that the
muezzin worried her own conscience,
but that she was annoyed by the
effect he produced on Fabian's. For
she had a proprietary nature, and
having got possession of the man's
body and half his soul she could not
be happy without the rest of him.
All this, however, only happens in
the Prologue, five years before the open-
ing of the play proper, and therefore
1 should not insist on the Damascus
minaret if it hadn't gone out of its
way to supply the title of a drama that
takes place in England and not the
East at all. Rather a deceptive title
perhaps, as it naturally suggests that
the scenes of the play are laid in the
Orient that Mr. HICHENS has made
familiar to his many readers. But
that is really the only false note in it.
The lady, finding that her man still
entertains ideals in which she has no
part, leaves him for his good and returns,
a little chastened, to her husband.
Fabian is now free to proceed to the
Holy Land and into Holy Orders, and
becomes a popular and much-respected
preacher. Five years later, when the
episode of Damascus is a faint exotic
memory which he proposes to stifle by
marrying a suitable wife for a clergyman,
Lady Caryll (returned to England at the
close of her husband's career through.
illness) intrudes at night upon Fabian's
seaside vicarage, to find out what hold
she still retains upon his affection.
The old wound is satisfactorily re-
opened, but any hope she may have
entertained of a renewal of their liaison
is spoilt by the sudden and tactless
appearance of her husband, who arrives
from Paris in what is described as the
Channel night boat, though, for the
ulterior purposes of the plot, it gets
in at 11 P.M. It is Mr. NorMAN McKIN-
NEL, with something more poisonous
than an Anglo-Indian liver, and things
begin to move briskly. The scene where
the three are brought together is per-
haps the best of many good scenes in
the play. But at the end of it, when
the lady has gone out, leaving the two
men alone, and we are holding our
breaths for a great struggle (possibly
physical), the author runs away from
his climax and lets the husband walk
abruptly out of the room. Contrary to
custom, three has been good company
(for us) and two is none.
The drama finishes on a high plane.
It is true drama, for it shows us action
going on in character. After a year,
in which none of the three has met.
Sir Leslie Caryll, who has learnt that
he has only a few months to live, pro-
poses to lighten his doom by bringing
a divorce action against his wife. But
his revenge is defeated when he finds
that Fabian will welcome the exposure
of the truth and that both he and
Lady Caryll, in payment of their past
offence, have renounced all intention
of ultimate union, whether set free by
divorce or by Caryll's coming death.
In particular the deliverance of the
woman's soul, no longer selfishly dis-
puting all other influences—God's or
man's—in the life of her lover, but
devoted to self-renunciation for his
sake and the sake of his ministry, is
finely drawn. -
The author has had the courage to
deny us a happy ending in the common
theatrical sense; and the high resolve
of these two to forgo their desire saves
the final scene, where the husband is
faced with imminent death, from all
suspicion of melodrama.
I have my doubts about certain de-
tails. I question whether enough
reason is shown for Lady Caryll's re-
turn to her husband in India, when
she had more cause than ever to want
to divorce him. I question too whether
so astute a man would have overlooked
the fact that in the course of a divorce
action against his wife his own infi-
delity would be liable to exposure. And
I further question whether he had any
legal evidence against her. But these
are trifles in a play that keeps an
exceptionally high level.
Its note throughout was a perfect
sincerity. Little regard was paid to the
stage tradition which makes you get up
from your seat and change over after
every third sentence. People sat still
when they talked as they do in ordinary
life and only got up when they really
wanted to.
It was a remarkable cast. I have
never seen Miss MARIE LöHR so quietly
forcible as in her scenes with Sir Leslie
Caryll. Here she imposed her person-
ality more strongly than in the Pro-
logue, where, with all her charm, I
could not quite mistake her for a body-
snatching Siren.
Nor, in this introduction, did Mr.
ARTHUR WoSTNER exactly look the part
of a prospective priest, or even of a
Lancelot torn in the struggle between
duty and passion ; he was too well-
groomed for that. But later he both
looked and played his part very perfectly.
Mr. McKINNEL as Sir Leslie had one of
those unpleasant rôles which he handles
with such deadly strength and dexterity.
The interventions of Mr. HENRY WIBART
as Father Elsworthy (spiritual coun-
sellor and comforter) gave me instant
assurance that all would be well. Miss
ELLEN O'MALLEY (as the suitable
woman for a clergyman's wife) offered
with her simple directness an excellent
foil to the other woman's finesse. And,
finally, Miss WANE FEATHERSto.N made
an admirably fatuous and doting mother
for Fabian.
My very best compliments and thanks
to all. — O. S.

Barbara, “Is IT ANYTHING HE CAN DIE OF 2"
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
You will admit that a hero who meets both NELsoN and
NApoleoN in his first chapter reveals at least an unusual
flair for fine company. So remarkable indeed was the
fortune in this respect of Barry Leroy (METHUEN) that I
confess to having felt some fear, at this early stage of his
adventures, lest Mr. H. C. BAILEY should overload them
with great folk, especially since for me real personages in
historical fiction are always, like the real cab-horse in melo-
drama, a little liable to upset the scenery. But I need not
have worried. Though presently celebrities are “thick as
sprats,” EMMA HAMILTON, Fouché, TALLEYRAND, PITT,
SHERIDAN–all the court-cards in the pack—there is
never any danger that the author and the hero will be
unequal to them. As a fact I found Mr. BAILEY's portraits
admirably suggested, while at no moment does the character
of his hero fail to dominate the scene. The tale is indeed
even more one of personality than of adventure, though
there is plenty of that too. I shall give you no more hint
of it than to say that it shows how Barry, who started as
agent of the FIRST CoNSUI, and plotter of our naval mutiny,
encountered first the NELsoN touch, then that noble and
unfortunate gentleman, the Duc D'ENGHIEN, with strange
results in the awakening of his own spirit. Perhaps you
may find the conversion not wholly inevitable, but your
enjoyment of the book need not be affected. The fact is
that seldom have I met a story of this kind better told.
From one affair to another Barry's career moves to a melody
(I think this is the word I want) both gallant and engaging
and very delicately touched. The result is one upon which
I make its author my sincere congratulations.
In these quarrelsome days I envy Mr. H. Collinsox
Owen the genial and benevolent mood in which he composed
The Adventures of Antoine (HopDER AND Stoughton).
Moreover, I marvel at his profound belief in the invariable
and immediate triumph of good over evil, which enabled
him to give a suggestion of reality even to the astonishing
career of his hero and to the series of lucky coincidences
without which he would have achieved nothing. Possibly
Mr. OweN is out to be amusing rather than effective, and,
if this be so, I have little criticism to offer; indeed, I
felicitate him on having maintained his good humour
almost to the end of his seven episodes, in such sort that
the goodness never quite got the better of the humour.
M. Antoine Poiret founded his fortunes, and those of his
Paris newspaper, La Lumière, on a lucky plunge at the
tables, the lack of evil intention removing the vice even
from this, his one possible sin. He developed matters by
a ridiculous and delicious coup in connection with the theft
of a masterpiece from the Louvre, and consolidated his
position by a frontal attack on the strongly entrenched
leader of class warfare in the merry capital. Established
as an old firm, but still requiring advertisement to keep

things alive, he had resort to the old practical joke of
blocking a public thoroughfare for the execution of unau-
thorised and mythical repairs, but justified his plagiarism
by adding some new incidents to the performance. The
duel which took place between his political leader-writer
and one of his victims needed no justification at all, in my
opinion; by itself it constituted a little gem of drollery,
but with its sensational sequel it became a meaningless and
rather tiresome tale of complications. “The Greatest Adven-
ture,” and the last, I could have dispensed with ; too many
real heroes have gone forth to the war in too real a way
to leave any interest and emotion over for the entirely
theatrical gallantry of a very fictitious patriot. The rest
of the book I would not willingly have missed; the author
and his people have a very happy way with them.
Your true costermonger, so Mr. NEIL LYONs informs us
in A London Lot (LANE), is not to be imagined when in
his Sunday best as wearing pearl-buttoned trouserings or
a red neck-cloth or a bowler hat. Such figures are “only
about persons and places that gained such popularity for
its predecessors. “People seem to like them very much
indeed,” admits the writer, with an engaging satisfaction
(already casting an eye upon yet another record on the
horizon); and it is easy enough to see the reason. As a
companion for a solitary hour, with the printed word to
take the place of a pleasantly discursive voice, Mrs. HINK-
son's year-books could hardly be bettered. And often she
has some illuminating thing to say about the men and
women who called out what has clearly been a genius for
friendship. As for good stories, you will not be dis-
appointed in the reasonable expectation of a score of them.
I have space only for one quotation from a chapter devoted
to such gems. “Surely the train wasn't up to time!" said
someone to an Irish porter, who replied morosely, “She
was, thin. She's the punctuallest train in Ireland, and
a great inconvanience to the travellin' public.” Altogether
a friendly and button-holing volume. ".

and he is quite successfully drafted from Silverside and
Greenwich Park to the plains of Flanders, not quite so suc-
cessfully, I think, evacuated, after a casualty sustained on
his unorthodox “leaf,” to a Hampshire hospital. It ma
have happened in the wild history of the War that a
deserter has come back to report at his depôt only to find
himself on the point of being awarded a posthumous V.C.,
but I am tempted to say that the incident is less in keeping
with the annals of the British Army than with the romantic
pages of Mr. NEIL Lyons. It looks as if the dramatic version
of the story had taken the bit between its teeth and run off,
so to speak, with the vegetable-barrow. But the earlier part
of A London Lot should produce a lot of London laughter.
Mrs. KATHARINETYNAN HINKsoN, continuing her reminis-
cences of Life (mostly Irish) and Literature (various), has
now added a third volume, The Years of the Shadow
(CONSTABLE) to her series. The shadow is, of course, that
from which we are all now emerging, with, for the writer,
the added gloom of rebellion. Naturally enough the events
of that unhappy Dublin Easter play a large, to Saxon eyes
perhaps a disproportionate, part in Mrs. HINKson's War
memories. For the rest the book is made up of the same
easy and gossipy small-talk (very small indeed some of it)
enough, but not quite on the high level of the early chapters.
Of that earlier part I can only say that I read it with the
keenness of a schoolboy; and I don't think that a middle-
aged man could pay an author a handsomer compliment.
Mr. KEBLE HowARD is a popular humourist, and, apart
from one rather glaring error of judgment, I recommend
The Peculiar Major (HUTchINsoN) as a book full of high
spirits and good fun. By means of a magic ring Major
Cloudsdale could make himself invisible to anyone who was
not in love with him. His C.O. in France was not in love
with him, and, when the Major began to explain what powers
this ring gave to him, the C.O. bundled him home as a man
who required careful watching. Then the fun began and
waxed mightily. The Major, however, was not out to play
a series of practical jokes, but to rid the world of its arch-
tyrant, the KAISER. He gets over to Holland and there
meets WILLIAM in full flight. At the moment a hitch had
taken place in the fulness of the flight, and we are given the
opportunity to hear the KAISER talking of the Garden of
Gethsemane. All I can say of this episode is to confess
that it did not suit my sense of fitness; but apart from this
flaw I can assert that the Major and his ring provide a good
measure of entertainment.

The rotten system is to blame
(The system which, ere work was on the wane,
Used to extract just half as much again).

To interfere in all the other mines).
Economy's the only cure ;
The work of Britain's best should be
Nationalised upon a sure
Foundation by the Ministry
(The same old Ministry to whom is traced
Our country's ruin, caused by wanton waste).
Coal is the common source of wealth,
Affecting fortunes not our own,
Since from our industry the health
Of every toiler takes its tone
(If we get what we want, then all is well;
If not, we'll let the nation go to h-l). O. S.
THE LIGHTER LIAISON OFFICER.
As a perſectly good field-gunner, familiar with every
theory conceived at Shoebury and ripened by years of prac-
tical experiment in the most popular theatres of war, William
came to North Russia. The prospect of shooting over a new
type of country under novel meteorological conditions, and
at a fresh variety of target, filled him with professional
enthusiasm. Throughout the voyage North he babbled
perpetually concerning M.V. (which to the R.A. does not
mean “Meat and Vegetables,” as it would to the mere soldier,
but Muzzle Velocity); ballistic co-efficients, trajectories,
angles of draught with husky- or reindeer-drawn vehicles,
and so forth. I daresay in his dreams he imagined himself
contributing an appendix to F.A.T., or Field Artillery Train-
ing, a code name for a stout little volume containing the
secular wisdom of all time.
Arrived at Archangel he made a perfect nuisance of him-
self in the offices of the great, mutinously declining to be an
R.T.O. for anybody. Finally, having dumped most of his
kit, stuffed his valise with a library of range-tables and
festooned himself with a duplicate set of protractors, com-
passes, field-glasses and similar gadgets, he bade us all
good-bye and disappeared up the Dvina. He departed so
heavily accoutred, so eager and with such élan that one
almost listened for the opening roar of a great bombardment
as soon as his boat had vanished into the blue round the
first bend. -
I saw him next a hundred miles or so up-river, sitting
in shirt-sleeves on a large hot stranded iron barge, sharing
a problem in contorted arithmetic with a black bo'sun of
the Naval Transport. Piles, stacks and pyramids of am-
munition-boxes towered about the pair, in process of
laborious demolition and re-erection by a moistly-warm
Slavonic working-party. Never a gun was near and no
sound of battle marred the industrious murmur of the long
sun-scorched beach, with its fringe of barges.
“What are you now, William 2 " I asked. “What great
rôle are you playing in this relief expedition 2"
With puckered brow he looked up from the problem
pencilled across the pages of his Army Book 153. “Hullo!”
he said, “I am Lighter Liaison Officer to the Allied
Forces, please.”
“Explain yourself,” I urged him. “Is there a lighter
and a heavier liaison officer for employment respectively as
the situation varies between comedy and melodrama 2"
“You misunderstand me,” said William, “and, I think,
wilfully. Moreover, while I listen to your idle badinage
the river is falling and 'Q' will not take steps to prevent it.
Bo'sun, make it clear to our allies that of the two hundred
boxes they have just brought on board two hundred and
fifty must come off, otherwise the barge won't float. Now
let me explain that the word “lighter' is not in this case an
adjective but a moun. To be brief, I liaise between the
Royal Regiment of Artillery and the lighters of the river
transport. (This type of craft is known on the Dvina as a
lighter, because it ought to be, being always too heavy, no
matter how little it carries.) Mine is a difficult and re-
sponsible task, requiring, in addition to the natural sagacity
and wide culture common to gunners, familiarity with the
science of the stevedore and the mariner and a high degree
of efficiency in longshoremanship.
“Theoretically and for purposes of rank and pay I am
non-existent, having even had to invent a title for the part
thrust upon me. No scale of pay is laid down for an Aet-
ing Lighter Liaison Officer; and therefore the vulgar make
free to call me Bill the Bargee.”
“And what do you do besides sums in the sun, William
—you a gunner?” -
“To put it modestly, I enable the guns to function.
Not an ammunition barge is towed up river but takes
amongst its freight ten years of my young life; not a shell
bursts in Bolo-land but is charged with the exasperation
its transport caused me. What else do I do?' I compete
with the forces of nature. I defy the drought, I outwit
the Dvina, juggling with freights and figures. To-day
‘Intelligence' have complicated the situation by warning
all concerned that if it rains the river may rise, whereas if
it doesn't it may continue to fall. Here then is a con-
tingency for which I must be prepared. I am prepared.
The bo'sun and I have so manipulated the cargo and the
calculations that the barge is at the present moment draw-
ing one foot forrard, two feet aft and six inches amidships,
dead reckoning. We have just completed arrangements
for a further redistribution and lightening of cargo, which
—unless there is some error in our figures—will defeat any
sly trick the river may play. I am having so much stuff
taken off her that her dead weight will be a minus quantity,
that is to say, instead of drawing a certain depth of water,
she ought to poise above the surface and be a kind of
dirigible aircraft. I confess this seems queer, but figures
can't lie. Come and see me and my barge to-morrow.”
I left him watching the water ebb down the sides of
his barge as the working-party, warmer than ever, steadily
took off what they had so laboriously put on. He was
waiting for the moment when a clearance should begin to
show between the keel and the surface of the river . . .
That evening it rained and rained, and I noticed that
his working-party were carrying the boxes on board again.
So William's experiment in levitation is still to be made.

A RETURNED MEMBER OF THE CHINESE LABOUR CORPS TELLING HIS FRIENDS HOW, WITH THE AID OF
A TANK, HE CHASED HINDENBURG OUT OF BOULOGNE.
THE L.S.S.
AFTER Mess, over the port, the time
comes to talk of many things—War
Office imbecility, brighter cricket, Bol-
shevism, theatres and sometimes the
recent War.
“What was wrong with the War,”
said the Adjutant, “was its incessant
din. Either a Hun heavy or a brass-
chested drill-sergeant on the ramp;either
a mine or a bugler misusing the breath
of life.”
“What do you propose to do about it,
anyway?" asked a junior.
“Ah! n' lad,” said the Adjutant,
“you think the gentleman hasn't any-
thing up his sleeve but his arm. Well,
he has. The spouters have rigged up
their League of Nations—good luck to
it! But I feel a wee bit doubtful about
eternal peace, so I'm preparing to make
the next war worth fighting in by found-
ing the L.S.S.”
“Legion of Sanitary Squadsmen?”
asked the junior.
“Don’t be funny,” said the Adjutant.
“No, the League of Silent Soldiers.”
Even the junior held his peace while
the Adjutant paused to light his cigar,
for the Adjutant's after-dinner schemes
are famous.
“When the L.S.S. gets a grip,” said
the Adjutant, “war will be a rest-cure;
doctors will prescribe it for neurotics.
Start at the beginning. Wash-out
words of command. Do everything by
gesture. Only the dumb employed as
instructors. For ‘form fours' just the
Sergeant's four fingers, carefully mani-
cured, upstretched. Pretty to watch—
and intelligible.”
“Squad drill is bound to breed noise,”
said the Adjutant's assistant.
“Domes of silence on every boot,”
said the Adjutant, “and any man who
makes his eyeballs click would have 'em
taken out and lined with cotton-wool.”
“How about brass bands 2 ” asked
SOrneone.
“Adored by the public,” replied the
Adjutant, “so we'll retain them, but
only for funerals, sports and National
Anthems. Delete bugles altogether.
Turn 'em into ploughshares. Rid God's
earth of a pest.”
“You’ve got to get the men to show
a leg of a morning,” said the junior,
“and stop their noisy snoring.”
“They’re not all hogs like you,” said
the Adjutant. “Anyway, that's easy.
Instead of bugles we'll have trained
soldier-choristers. For Reveille, ‘Chris-
tians, awake,' con spirito. For Tattoo,
‘Good-night, good-night, beloved,’ dim-
inuendo and rallentando. For Lights
Out a sort of Sevenfold Amen. Most
elevating for the troops.”
“Tell us about war,” said the Major;
“so far it's all peace-time.”
“The impatience of Field Officers! I
said “start at the beginning,’” replied
the Adjutant. “However—thegory field
of battle will be revolutionised. Why
gory 2 Let's make the thing a test of
silent self-control. As a child, many
years ago (to the junior) you must
have played at ‘Staring out' with your
little sister. You may even play it still
—with someone else's sister. My idea
is to set our own and enemy companies
face to face for a staring match. The
man who outstares his vis-à-vis will
take him off as a souvenir. Convincing
proof of superior moral.”
“Too slow,” said the Bombing Officer.
“All right for sitting out at a dance,
but men like action and movement.”
“I don't expect a rowdy grenadier
to approve of the L.S.S.,” said the
Adjutant. “Still, I grant your point.
To meet it we might allow handball
matches with air-balloons, either side
disturbing the peace by popping a
balloon to be fined a platoon. Action
and movement by all means. I don't

care if we have sack races across No-
man's-land.”
“Guns 2" asked someone.
“Another slave to convention,” ob-
served the Adjutant; “but we must
allow for a strong prejudice in favour of
guns. We'll permit them, but only for
purposes of ornament—say as a centre-
piece of a fountain outside G.H.Q.
Either side making ‘shoot—bang—fire'
noises to be fined a division, and sus-
ended from the war for a fortnight.”
“What about my branch 2" asked
the Musketry Officer.
“You are rather a problem,” said the
Adjutant; “somehow, war without rifles
would be farcical. Tell you what; if
you can adapt your rifles and machine-
guns to, say, throwing cool and refresh-
ing spray over our troops in hot
weather, you may keep 'em, otherwise
you had better get in touch with the
| Ex-Officers' Employment Bureau forth-
with.”
“Aerial warfare ?” asked someone.
“Glad you mentioned that,” said the
.Adjutant, “because I'm rather in love
with my scheme. The L.S.S. would
not discourage aviation — of course
with engines silenced. No more nasty
showers of hell-raising bombs, though,
to catch you without your umbrella.
Airmen would drop bouquets of arti-
ficial roses and be paid in the shape of
prisoners for skill in craftsmanship, to
be judged by a committee of horticul-
turists from neutral States.”
“Tanks?” was the next query.
“The very look of 'em is loud,” said
the Adjutant. “Instead of tanks we'll
have carnival cars d la November 9th.
Prizes of Kamerads according to artis-
tic merit. Ex-Lord Mayors and their
ladies to adjudicate.”
“Would the Navy come in 2" asked
SOmeone.
“The “Silent Navy'? Obviously,
said the Adjutant. “Naval supremacy
would be settled by yacht-racing. It
might be incorporated with Cowes.
Think how WILHELM would have loved
it—unless he were beaten.”
“What would your League say to
conscription ?” asked the Major.
“That question simply wouldn't
arise,” said the Adjutant. “You don't
compel men to take a summer holiday.
All L.S.S. wars would be summer shows.
We should wait for the glass to reach
‘set fair.’ Imagine it. A picnic tea in
a beautiful French bois, with a happy
enemy just over the way doing ditto;
aircraft skimming silently through the
blue and showering down perfumed
bouquets! Hold me down or I shall
become lyrical. War would be a gentle-

conditions, is a- After you, Sir,

DON'T BE DEPRESSED IN THAT PRE-WAR SUIT,
TAKE A LEAF FROM THE LADIES BOOK.
GOLDEN PROMISES.
I AM the owner of some shares in a
mine called the “Golden Promise"
Mine. I don't know exactly where it is,
but it's a long way off—in Mexico, I
think; anyhow, too far away for me to
o and have a look at it.
I bought the shares some years ago.
The day before I bought them the paper
said they were “a feature on reports of
a rich vein having been struck.” They
seemed absurdly cheap, and as I had
some spare cash which was annoying
me at the time I thought I'd better have
five hundred or so of these “Golden
Promises” quickly, before they went up.
I had visions of following the prices and
seeing them soaring higher and higher,
while I remained cool and collected,
holding on to them for a still higher
figure. I would not sell for a paltry
rofit of a few shillings—not I.
I felt that I had seized the golden
opportunity which we are all supposed
to have some time or another. The
paper said these shares had “great
speculative possibilities.”
All this, as I have said, was several
years ago. I am still holding on to
those shares; but matters did not work
out as I had anticipated. The very next
day after I bought them they seemed
to hesitate, as if nervous about some-
thing. They appeared to have got wind
of the news that I had bought some.
The paper said they were “a little
weaker on profit-taking.” Evidently
the man who sold me mine was content
with a small profit, and I felt a sort of
pitying contempt for a man who had
so little confidence. But perhaps, poor
fellow, he wanted the money. Many
people are compelled to sell promising
securities because they are hard up.
During the next day or two they fell
considerably lower, and the paper said
they had “receded on the denial by the
directors of the rumour as to a rich vein
having been struck.” “Aha!” said I,
“very crafty of the directors; they want
to keep the price down so that they can
buy as many as possible for themselves
before the big rise;” and I felt quite re-
assured. For the next few days they
wobbled considerably, but mostly down,
and I began to find myself quite grati-
fied if they recovered 6d. or so after
dropping 1s. 6d. or 2s. Unconsciously
I kept lowering the standard of what I
hoped from them.
In due course I received a certificate
for my shares, and this bucked me up a
bit. It was a fine impressive sort of
document, with a very nice embossed
stamp on it, and it described me as a
“gentleman,” which I felt to be per-
fectly true; but all the same I thought
it a tactful thing to say, and some of
my confidence returned.
I don't often see the shares quoted
now, and when they are they are ap-
parently sold in bundles of eight or so
at about 1s. 6d. the lot. I get regular
reports as to the progress of the mine,
and at first these used to interest me
immensely. They contained all sorts |
of information as to “cross-cuts” and
“winzes” (whatever they may be), and
occasionally they would give details of
the sinking of a shaft in some new place
to strike into some other burrow they
had been making somewhere else, and
they seemed to have had a lot of amuse-
ment that way. I expect it was rather
exciting boring through to the other
fellows in the other tunnel. They also
used to give minute particulars of the
ore “won.” They call it “winning.”
It seemed to be a kind of game; but
they apparently had bad luck, as they
lost all they ever won.
The trouble, we were told, began with
the natives of that part, who evidently
didn't take to the mine—spoilt their
view perhaps. At any rate they de-
veloped the habit (as I gathered from
the printed reports I received from time
to time) of spending their half-holidays
and week-ends loafing round about the
mine, rolling boulders down it, taking
parts of the machinery away as sou-
venirs, flooding it and suchlike pleas-
antries. They seem full of fun out there.
There was a shareholders' meeting
the other day which I attended. I had
been to previous ones. They are always
much the same. Everybody goes full
of disgust and indignation, and deter-
mined to make trouble for the directors;
but when they get there all their pluck

quickly evaporates and they end up by
warmly supporting votes of thanks to
the various gentlemen who have been
instrumental in robbing them of their
money.
On this occasion, however, one share-
holder was very peevish about things,
and he told us, before the proceedings
commenced, that he was going to “put
the directors through it,” and we all
promised him our moral support and
looked upon him as a hero. And after
the Chairman had told us the usual story
and had assured us that as soon as they
had pumped the water out of the mine
and installed new machinery, etc., all
would be well the peevish shareholder
got up and was very rude to the directors
and told them exactly what he thought
about them. - -
But somehow he got no support from
us. The Chairman replied to him with
a few scathing remarks and appealed to
us as really sensible, reasonable busi-
mess men, who would as a matter of
course treat such childish behaviour
with the contempt it deserved; and we
all frowned on the peevish one and
would have none of him. And when
one of the directors proposed a vote
of thanks to the Chairman for his un-
selfish devotion to our interests we were
all vociferous in our support.
But as soon as I had left the meet-
ing I felt that the peevish shareholder
had been quite right, and the next
time I shall go to the meeting armed
with several stones, and I shall induce
the other shareholders to do likewise;
and when the directors begin to pay
one another compliments and propose
votes of thanks to one another for rob-
bing us of our money we will silently
and without warning rise in a body
and stone them to death; and we will
feel that, at any rate, we have had some-
thing for our money.
If by chance at any time I should
have any more money to invest (which
at present appears highly improbable),
I shall put it into a rubber company—
one about to start. Rubber companies
give you figures which cannot be denied.
For straightforward dealing commend
me to rubber companies. They tell you
plainly and candidly how many acres
they have and how many trees they
intend to plant to an acre. They know
to a nicety how much rubber they can
get from each tree and, working this
out with the price of rubber at a “con-
servative " figure (they always take a
“conservative” figure), they can tell you
exactly how much they will make. And
while they are waiting for the rubber
trees to grow up they get bananas and
cocoanuts and other side lines off them,
which alone will yield enough to pay
20 per cent. or so, quite apart from the
rubber. And when they get knobs on
(which they do about the second year—
the trees, I mean), it is simply money
for nothing.
Yes, I shall try rubber next time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE AFFAIR OF POPPETS AND JANOTHA.
A Holid AY TRAGEDY.
The question of providing for Poppets
and Janotha during our absence from
home during the greater part of last
month gave us much thought.
We didn't care to send Poppets to
any friends in the near neighbourhood.
We thought it was better to send him
to some place which he would not be
able to find again after our return. A
cat that lives chiefly with other people
cuts no mice.
Janotha, whose family came from
the Harz Mountains, has been interned
since 1916 (when she left the egg), but
is allowed out in the dining-room once
a day for an hour or so, during which
time she perches on anybody or any-
thing she fancies as a roost.
If, we thought, the pair could be
housed under one roof during our holi-
day they might feel more at home than
if separated. Poppets would hear the
familiar songs of Janotha's répertoire,
while she from her cage would be able
to watch Poppets down below. Janotha
at home would usually spend a lot of
time watching Poppets openly; he on
his part would watch her and pretend
he wasn't doing anything of the kind.
After much confabulation with the
members of my family who owned, or
claimed ownership of, this worthy pair,
it was decided that I should write and
ask one Henry Lea, of Chalford Magna,
Esquire, and thoroughly good-natured
ass, if he would house them for the
three weeks that we should be away.
Accordingly I wrote:–
DEAR old Sport, We're all going
to Wales for three weeks and are obliged
to leave our cat and canary behind, on
board wages, so to say.
For reasons into which I need not
enter we don't want to place these pets
with neighbours, and I wonder if you
will be a stepfather to them.
If so I will send them along with
plenty of seed for the bird, and will pay
any expense you may be put to over
the cat. Milk is expensive, and there
is unfortunately no “just as good" to
this kind of a pussy-foot.
Neither pet will give you any trouble,
I am sure, and, though actual friendship
between the pair is strictly barred, as
you might say, I feel they would be
happier under the same roof.
Say you will take them and relieve
my mind. Yours, ARTHUR.
Henry replied thus:—
DEAR old ToP,-I should simply love
to oblige you, but don't fancy the re-
sponsibility. I have had no household
pets since my moth-eaten spaniel Togo
faded away in the spring, so I am not
afraid of strife; but, supposing the
climate didn't suit your pair or they
didn't like my quiet bachelor ménage
or the furniture or decorations, what
then 2
However, if you will indemnify me
against all risks, I'll chance it and
take them for you. Perhaps the canary
knows some of the latest songs. We
get very behind the times in this out-
post of civilization.
Yours ever, HENRY.
To this I replied that both Poppets and
Janotha were colour-blind and climate-
proof, that the canary could sing some-
thing near enough to K-Katie for all
practical purposes, that Poppets could
give a fair imitation of the opening
Jazz steps if there was a saucer of
cream about, and that we should hold
him, Henry, free of all risks, whether
by earthquake, flood, fire and tempest,
strikes, eye-strain, pip, wireworm, moth
or rust, and all and every danger that
might betide; and, further, that I had
already despatched the pair, carriage
paid, properly packed and fed, and
should be glad to hear of their safe
arrival in due course.
We not only heard from Henry that
they had reached him safely, but again
after a few days, to say they were in
top-hole trim, and were giving him no
end of amusement. Janotha, as per
instructions, was having an outing
every day in the dining-room, and
Poppets had made several conquests
among the feline and rodent residents
in the neighbourhood.
We heard nothing more from Henry
during the holiday, but didn't worry.
We were so busy sea-siding that we
had almost forgotten the existence of
our pets.
But on arriving home we found a
hamper, and in it a letter from Henry,
which read:—
[2 ENCLs.]
DEAR ARTHUR,--I return to you with
a thousand regrets your two pets. All
went well until last Wednesday, and
as (in spite of the fact that you took
all risks) I shrank from spoiling the
end of your holiday I didn't write to
you in Wales about the ill happenings.
The cat, I am afraid, is not as alive
as it might be, for on Wednesday
morning it left the house suddenly by
the window of the dining-room in
which the canary had been taking its
daily outing, and, on reaching the road,
it had the temerity to dispute the right
of way with a passing motor-car.
With repeated regrets, I am,
Yours sorrowfully, HENRY.
P.S.—Though you may have diffi-
culty in tracing it, the canary is really
enclosed.
CONTROL.;
OR, THE PREMIER ExPLAINs.
IN faint forgotten days of old
There was a Premier, I am told,
Who did not read the papers;
He whacked a ball about the bents
Oblivious of the world's events,
The howls of journalistic gents
And even the advertisements
Of London's largest drapers.
Poor man, I wonder how he knew
Which course was safest to pursue
And which one had a “crab" in it;
Perhaps he used to tire his head
With swatting when he went to bed,
Or kept a little list instead
With all the names, from A to Z,
Of members of his Cabinet.
Far otherwise I hold the helm :
When storms are like to overwhelm
I get The Evening Gorgon,
Which tells me in a newsy par
How many Ministers there are,
And why and when they go too far,
And which ones in particular
Annoy that earnest organ.
And when my morning paper comes
And I am told what awful sums
My colleagues waste in muddles,
And hear of things I did not know—
That Whitehall flappers ought to go
And streams of petrol cease to flow,
And where the goodliest limpets grow
In Departmental puddles.
It fills me with surprise and pain
(Oh brood of vipers that has lain
Within my bosom safe hid);
I feel I ought to thank the Press
For pointing out this fearful mess,
For now I know the guilty; yes,
The children of unrighteousness
Have been revealed to DAVID.
I tell my typist: “Take this note
And send it to The Morning Stoat:
The PREMIER acknowledges
Your article of even date
And humbly begs to intimate
That he has sacked the Heads of
State;
Accept, if it is not too late,
His most sincere apologies.”

FACT IS-ALL THESE ANIMALS YAwNING—so BEASTLY INFECTIOUs.”
NEWS FROM THE OIL WORLD,
(By our own Oleaginous Expert.) -
THE find of liquid oil proceeds apace
in East Anglia, and within the limits
of space at our disposal we can only
indicate some of the most important
discoveries. -
Foremost amongst these is the re-
markable outflow at Caistor, near Nor-
wich. The oil of Caistor has long
enjoyed a local celebrity, but was only
available in small quantities. Within
the last few weeks, however, a well has
begun spouting at the rate of two hun-
dred barrels a day. The oil is peculiar,
and Dr. Pruffle, F.R.S., has seen no-
thing, quite like it in all his previous
experience. Nor, it may be added, has
the writer. That is all that can be
said at the moment, beyond the fact
that the oil, while distinctly sebaceous,
is in the main better suited for medi-
cinal than other purposes, and cannot
be recommended for use in the prepar-
ation of salad-dressing. It is enough
to say that if, as seems likely, the out-
flow is maintained we are face to face
with an asset of very great commercial
value.
At Great Yarmouth an immense
sensation has been caused by the up-
rush of oil in the cellar of a house
inhabited by a barber. To judge from
the specimens which have reached us
it can be used either as fuel or for
internal consumption. Strange to say,
the liquid drawn off at midnight reveals
a much larger proportion of spirit, and
Sir CoNAN Doyle, who was hastily
summoned on this fact being known,
is giving the matter his most careful
attention. We cannot assume the re-
sponsibility for the statement, already
made in the local Press, that the pro-
duct of this well may entirely supersede
cod-liver and Macassar oil and revo-
lutionize our fishing and hair-dressing
industries. Let it suffice if we say that
the operations now in progress are of
surpassing interest to all directly or
indirectly associated with the oil world.
There remains the epoch-making ex-
udation at the North Boreland Golf
Links. During the progress of the
Peace Challenge Cup competition last
Friday all play was suddenly stopped
by the simultaneous gush of a rich and
succulent fluid from all the eighteen
holes! The characteristics of this oil
—for oil it undoubtedly is—cannot be
made public yet awhile. Mr. Isidore
de Truefitt and Mr. T. P. O'Connor
have been summoned to report; Mr.
HAROLD BEGBIE is still busy interview-
ing the noble President of the North
Boreland Golf Club on the ethical pos-
sibilities of the discovery; Mr. Robert
SMILLIE is preparing a manifesto. The
professional club-maker, a remarkably
intelligent man, is freely discussing the
prospect of converting all his stock of
irons into drilling tools. But there
has been no shouting from the house-
tops, and all concerned appear to be
going about a pretty big business in a
calm and sensible way. For ourselves
we are content- with the bald state-
ment that, if the North Boreland oil
possesses all the qualities that are
claimed for it, it is the most extra-
ordinary oil that we have ever come
acroSS. -
The Saturday Review, writing about
the chances of an army of amateur
pitmen, says:–" Some of the older
coal-hewers might, no doubt, be bribed
to brain the new miners.” That would
teach them.

SOUTH SEA SYMPHONIES.
THE announcement that “some thirty
Hawaiian Orchestras” are on their way
to London comes as no surprise to those
who have studied the development of
symphonic music in exotic climes. But
the Hawaiians are not to have it all
their own way. Mr. Bamborough (né
Bamberger), who recently returned
from a protracted sojourn in New
Guinea, in an exclusive interview with
our representative gave a glowing ac-
count of the Polynesian Polyphonic
Orchestra, which is shortly to appear
under his direction at the Queen's Hall.
“Papuan music,” he remarked, “will
be all the rage in the autumn and winter
season, and for the best of reasons. It
combines the epileptic vivacity of the
negroid Muse with a melancholy charm
which is all its own. The outlines are
grandiose and crepuscular, suggesting
herds of dinosaurs prowling amid the
ruins of prehistoric palaces, or shoals
of Kraken pirouetting in the mid-vortex
of the maelstrom. But it imposes no
undue strain on the tympanum. The
sonority of the New Guinea Orchestra
is sumptuous but not nerve-shattering,
and can be endured with impunity by
the naked ear. I would particularly call
attention to the wonderful timbre of the
jamboroon, an octagonal ten-stringed
instrument played with the feet, and
the plaintive ululation of the gogo-horn,
a gigantic conch which takes the place
of the bass-tuba in European bands.
“As for the design of Papuan com-
positions,” Mr. Bamborough continued,
“they conform to the binomial or rotary
system; extreme Darwinians cannot
fail to be impressed by the development of
the Coda. The subjects are in the main
prognathous, with a certain amount
of bulbiform nodulation in the bascular
ducts, but are otherwise free from an
excess of thrombosis. The rhythms
are tropical and fluctuant, and the or-
chestration lavish and corybantic. I
often wonder,” added Mr. Bamborough,
“what PALESTRINA would have thought
of it. But for myself I have no doubt
that in this luxuriant outlandish music
we must welcome a bountiful if bizarre
contribution to the evolution of our
beloved Art. The lubrication,” he went
on dreamily, “is of a new and simple
design. Only one feed-pipe is employed,
and cooling is effected on the thermo-
siphon principle. Ah! forgive me, I
was thinking of my new Starbeam car;
but there is a great affinity between the
two.” Cordially endorsing the great
maestro's verdict, our representative
withdrew from his radiant presence
with a renewed and reinvigorated hope
for the future of native Art.

“I am glad to hear it,” said the

“Oh, me?” said the heron. “I make

“How so?” said the sparrow.
“Why, on railway journeys, when
he sees me from the window, he says
to the man opposite, whom he hasn't

I'm the only bird that can do that.
He wouldn't bother to say, ‘There’s a

THE STANDARD.
CLYFFE LoDoE, seaside boarding-
house, was just reopened after the War.
There was a new notice at the gate, in
which the word “select” took pride of
place and of print; there was an en-
larged window-space, in which guests
at their meals were to be displayed with
prominence but also with taste; the
porch was strewn with wicker chairs
and the steps with cushions, both hav-
ing the same uses of advertisement in
view; and there was a pervasive smell
of new furniture and new paint that was
distinctly intimidating in its suggestion
that Clyffe Lodge had turned over a
new leaf and was waiting to see whether
we knew what was proper to be written
on it.
| We didn't. Dinner on that first even-
ing was a good but a melancholy meal.
Clyffe Lodge, equipped at every point
to receive us, was not yet able to assimi-
late us. Our only link was an over-
powering consciousness that we must
be as select as the notice at our gate
said we were.
A bitter business. Fathers of families
were cowed by the spectacle of the
greatness thrust upon them; mothers
breathed but a single prayer—to con-
duct themselves in a manner that
should not bring social disgrace on
their offspring; young women raked
one another's costumes with an eye
to detail that would have done them
credit if they had been members of a
crack regiment; young men hid under
a bushel the jest that was the foun-
tain-light of all their day lest it should
perish with obloquy in this rarefied
atmosphere of their choice and of
their undoing.
what might be the impossible standard
set up by Clyffe Lodge in jests as in
gentility? Periodically our hostess
thawed her official smile in order to
press with official heartiness second
helpings on us; but she was not really
proof against the arctic chill of our as-
sembly; in a minute or so she always
found the smile frozen stiffly again on
her lips.
It was over at last, and I sought a
quiet if desolate retreat beside a window
in the drawing-room that had no view
of the sea. Gentility en masse, patheti-
cally hopeful of better things to come,
had poured out on to the porch and

there, giving occasional tentative femi-
nine titters in response to occasional
tentative masculine platitudes. It was
pitiful. I caught myself wishing that
an angel could be induced to trouble
those glassy waters of propriety into
some semblance of rude life.

turned to see a stout middle-aged wo-
man knitting on a couch. She nodded
to indicate that it was myself she had
been addressing and continued easily,
“But, bless us, that won't last long.
You young people will be warming up
presently. I know !”
She gave a jovial roll to her friendly
eye, and I loved her. She was vulgar;
she was intrusive; but at Clyffe Lodge
she was a miracle. For she was as
nature and circumstances had made
her; gentility had left her unscathed.
“'Twon't last longer 'n to-morrow,
anyway,” she prophesied, chuckling.
“I’m expecting Miss Trendon come
to-morrow, and then you’ll see.”

Miss Trendon you speak of is—?” I
prompted.
“Well, I should say so,” she agreed
heartily, quite as if I had supplied a
string of adjectives and a family tree.
“There'll be no more moping or 'um-

comes. Fond of a joke, if ever anybody
was, I can tell you. Full of life and fun
and always up to tricks. That lively—
well, you'd never believe. Fond of young
men too—you'll see,” she continued
with a determined kindliness towards
myself that I felt was perhaps in this
case hardly fair to Miss Trendon; it

rously to take no advantage of my in-
advertent scoop in the matter.
But, oblivious of any such delicacies
and subtleties, my informant continued
her happy anticipations. “Why, even
fond of Ma, Miss Trendon is,” she
gurgled joyously. “That fond—well,
you’d never believe,” she concluded in
her favourite formula.
Against this cynical assumption on
the part of Miss Trendon's maternal
parent—for such I now deduced her
to be—I protested with suitable mur-
murs. Indeed I was only too anxious
to believe that a girl so richly dowered
with a capacity for fondness was to
prove the angel who should break up
our social ice.
I awaited her coming with curiosity
and took every opportunity of engaging
her mother in eulogy as a corrective
to my depression. I found it impos-
sible to listen to a recital of Miss Tren-
don's many excellences without longing
to win or lose them all; the thought
of their hourly approach screwed my
courage to the sticking-point of endur-
ing a few more spiritually frozen meals.
On the morrow after tea I hung
about specially, in order not to miss her
on her arrival from the station, whither
Mrs. Trendon had gone to meet her.
A good many of the boarders were in
the porch doing the same; and it was
touching to see how young men and
| maiden-aunts, old boys and flappers
alike hung upon the chance of Miss
| Trendon being able to achieve the melt-
ing process to which her parent had
pledged her. For the fame of Miss
Trendon had gone abroad, and it was
not I alone who had been favoured with
her champion's confidences.
But it appeared to be I alone who
was surprised by Miss Trendon's sex.
When the cab drew up Mrs. Trendon's
only companion proved to be a short
rosy-cheeked man, middle-aged and
superlatively cheerful.
“Mist'r 'Endon,” she announced
proudly and collectively to the group of
us, and I awakened, gaping, to the fact
that the Miss Trendon of my imagin-
ation and hopes did not exist; there
existed only Mist'r 'Endon and his wife;
and Clyffe Lodge was doomed. I
should have to leave it to perish in its
own ice-safe.
“Evening, all,” observed Mist'r
'Endon, with the friendliest of unem-
barrassed nods, and followed up the
greeting by a sudden surprising caper
in which he carried his wife with him
to the tune of a high-spirited refrain:—
“I joined the boarding-'ouse to-day,
So now—we are—all right !”
There was a ripple and stir in the
congealed ranks of the boarders; it was
like the electric thrill with which on
some morning in March all nature
responds to the first touch of spring.
“Really, Pa,” remonstrated Mrs.
Hendon with happy breathlessness,
“you didn't ought ! Whatever will all
these young ladies and gents think?
Two old folks like us!”
“You — old 2 Now, Ma,” warned
Mr. Hendon facetiously, “you know
very well what I think of you.” He
shook a fat, fond, admonitory finger in
her face. “And if you don't—well, what
did the conductor say when the pretty
young lady asked 'im for a ticket to the
Baker's Arms ? Tell me that, then l''
“Oh, get along with you, do, Mist'r
'Endon | " she said, being evidently no
stranger to this question. But its pos-
sible answer and applicability eluded
the rest of us.
“What—what did he say?” I ven-
tured to inquire, and perceived by the
grateful glances of my fellow-boarders
that I had voiced the sense of the
meeting.
Mr. Hendon's arm encircled his wife's
waist and he implanted a resounding
kiss on her cheek. “Lucky baker!”
he replied with gusto.
The ice of Clyffe Lodge had met its
master; it shivered and cracked, it splin-
tered and tinkled into laughter. Young
men upon whom concealment of their
own jokes had acted like a worm i' the
bud took heart of grace; hitherto mum-
mified young women looked with a
rapid access of animation and favour
upon the revived young men; their
elders of both sexes awakened with
relief to the knowledge that, if this it
was to be select, then selectness was
easily within their own grasp. Embar-
rassment, shyness, gentility fell like
garments from Clyffe Lodge; for a
standard had at last been set, and, be-
hold, it was no new-fangled, exalted
criterion, but simply the old, comfort-
able, pre-war affair, and there was no
boarder but might hope to do it credit.
That evening the dressing-bell rang
three times before it was heard above
the roar of badinage and repartee in the
porch. =

D9EsNT Know WHEI-E IT '8 PUT THE
“YOUR.”
It was while reading the exuberant
criticisms of The Morning Post's cricket
correspondent that I was first struck
by the astonishing use to which we put
the possessive pronoun. “You wanted
your Richardsons and your Lohmanns
to get Middlesex out,” shouted this
correspondent. My RICHARDSONs, be
it observed, and my Loh MANNs. And
the statement was true in so far as I
really did want those particular bowlers,
first, because I never saw either of
them, and, secondly, because my bowl-
ing average is at present in the fifties
and would be the better for some sound
professional instruction. I left home
glowing with the joy of possession.
Nor were these two great bowlers to
be my only acquisitions that day. The
chatty financial idiot in the train told
me that, if my trades union authorities
couldn't keep their heads, national bank-
ruptcy was bound to follow. Then at
lunch-time a complete stranger said to
me, “Your City magnates are getting
the wind up badly.” I was very glad
to have some City magnates, so in grati.
tude I handed him my trades unionists.
“If your trades union authorities, etc.,

In the course of the afternoon I was
made responsible for a brace of field-
marshals, a chess champion, West-
minster Abbey (the gift of an American)
and some peerages of the realm. This
last attracted me more than any pre-
vious gift, and I felt moved again to
offer something in return—something
really useful this time. “Sir,” I said
to the previous owner, a man who in-
sisted on talking politics, although we
were at the Oval, “you have made me
such a very generous present that I feel
impelled to give you something in ex-
change. Permit me to offer you a brace
of City magnates, complete with wind
up. And if your City magnates --
I was continuing firmly; but he had
gone.
My burden was still too heavy for
me to bear, and I determined to get rid
of as much of it as possible. Adopting
a French accent, I handed over West-
minster Abbey to an embarrassed po-
liceman; and in the train going home
I disposed of most of my other encum-
brances; but I could not induce anyone
to talk chess. So I have the pleasure
of announcing that I am willing to
consider any reasonable offer for my
chess champion or any part of him.

AT THE PLAY.
“Hoxie AND BEAUTY.”
BE solemn about Mr. SomeRSET
MAUGHAM's naughty little farce and
you are lost. But the camouflage
is so dexterously contrived that I
conceive a bishop might sit and
laugh through it without noticing
its entirely deplorable moral tone.
Victoria, a Dear Little Thing
(Miss GLADYs Cooper), having lost
her first D.S.O., Bill, marries his
best man, Freddy, also a D.S.O.
This (with bazaars) by way of doing
her bit. Bill adored her, but so
does Freddy; and for herself she
can't quite make up her mind
which she loves best. And then
Bill (Mr. HAwtrey), who had lost
his memory, but not, as officially
reported, his life, at Ypres II.,
turns up from captivity in a suit of
reach-me-downs bought in Ham-
burg (and the thrill communicated
by it is alone worth your money,
believe me). He finds a sufficiently
embarrassed Freddy (Mr. MALcol M
CHERRY), and a Victoria outraged
by this new instance of the
proverbial tactlessness of Enoch
Ardens.
But Victorict need not have
worried. Each in a paroxysm, of
generosity is preparing to steal away
and leave the Dear Little Thing
to the other. A way out of the impasse
is discovered by Victoria, who has fallen
in love with the Rolls-Royce of a
Wangler (sugar, jobs, exemptions, pass-
ports and that kind of thing). He has
been winning the War on the home
front, and accordingly has a coronet
in prospect. So a divorce is to be
arranged. The services (purely tech-
nical and formal) of an irreproachable
and unapproachable spinster are en-
gaged, so that the decencies of the law
may be observed.
We are all tired of saying how per-
fectly charming Miss GLADys Cooper
looked. It happens to be true. It
was part of the point that she didn't
need to do much else. Mr. HAwTREY
and Mr. CHERRY, in their self-sacrific-
ing duel, are very pleasant to watch.
Mr. MAUGHAM gives them the most ad-
mirably pointed and polished dialogue.
Miss JEAN CADELL, as the professional
intervener, chaste ministress of the
law's least savoury ceremonies, gave
a deservedly applauded performance.
That exquisite droll, Miss LottſE
VENNE, drew tears from my eyes. If
Mr. Lyston LYLE spoke more like a
toastmaster than a solicitor and had
his mind more clearly made up than
any solicitor I have ever met, the mal-
icious satire on our divorce laws got
well over the foot-lights. Mr. HARBEN,
the Wangler, wooed appropriately. The
little part of a manicurist was excel-
lently played by Miss LAURA LYDIA.

“DADD1Es.”
If Mr. MAUGHAM has wrapped up his
naughtiness in a cloud of gossamer, Mr.
John L. HoBBLE offers a thoroughly
homely and wholesome theme which
gets wholesomer and heavier as Act
pitilessly succeeds Act. Mr. HobbLE
is on the side of the angels and their
wings must be still sticky with it.
I am conscious of betraying myself
as a man of depraved taste and shocking
insensibility. For here were five noisy
Pittsburg bachelors (full of strange
“Rahs” and strong cocktails) so worked
upon by the wistful beauty of little
abstract children and the manoeuvres
of a perfect dear of a mother that the
hard Pittsburg steel was turned to
sugar in their vitals — a process to
which I find stout noisy men of the
producing classes in America (on the
stage) are peculiarly liable.
There are touches of originality in
the treatment. The heroine comes on
suffering from sea-sickness, a moving
figure; the hero, that is to say the
most fatuous of the five, catches it in
the modified form of love-sickness, and
we—but let not a feeling for symmetry
warp our critical judgment. The fact is,
however, I loathe stage children, even
when they are as clever and precocious
as Miss MADELINE Robson; and though
I know it's not their fault.
Miss MARY JERRold has only to
look at you with eyes and a smile
like that to persuade you that
she is really a dear old lady, not
the merest saccharine convention.
Miss STELLA JEsse, ditto: enough
to break up any bachelors' club.
The heroine, Ruth, I frankly found
impossible. Miss EMILY BRookE
did her best with her, and it was a
competent best. In fact she played
a little passage about the orphaned
children of France with a real
tenderness which in any reason-
able context would have been very
effective. But Mr. HobbLE has a
cocktail mind: any old ingredients,
well shaken up, will do for him.
It is high time America went dry.
Of the five men, honours must
go to Mr. GEORGE TULLY for a
really first-rate piece of character-
isation. Mr. MULCASTER, Mr. SAM
Lives Ey, Mr.WEGUELIN were capa-
ble in support. Mr. MATTHEws
seemed unhappy; and I don't won-
der. A packed audience “simply
loved it.”

Miss CECILIA HILL, whose Wings Triumphant I remember
to have much enjoyed, has now followed it with Stone Walls
(Hutchinson). Since the action passes entirely in (I mean
on) a marsh, you must understand the stone walls in a
sense strictly symbolic—the kind, in short, that do a prison
make. In the present instance they enclosed Petra Pen-
rose, the heroine, until such time as the tale had gone on
long enough for her to find freedom in the loving arms of
the hero. Perhaps you see already a certain scepticism in
my attitude? The melancholy truth is that, while I found
Miss HILL's marsh-land sketches admirably real, her people
appeared, almost all of them, to suffer incurably from the
complaint of being characters in a book. Perhaps Petra
herself, apart from her name, was the mildest case; her
lonely childhood and her devotion, in jealous silence, to the
memory of her father were human enough. Petra's father,
one gathers vaguely, had been a victim to the artistic
temperament, so much so indeed that her mother had
divorced him and married again, this time a gentleman
whose public name was Thracted, but who in private
enjoyed the courtesy-title of Papa. You observe a nice
distinction. I have to confess to some sneaking sympathy
with Papa. He was not indigenous to the marsh, may
indeed have been of rheumatic tendency, and it is very
possible that this soured him iust as much as his obvious
efforts to live up to his position as the brutal stepfather of
fiction. The not unexpected result was that he behaved
like an incredible ass and was very properly discomfited:
while Petra, triumphant, embraced her artist and (true to
the marsh habit) was rewarded with the prospect of a
fifth-floor flat in Westminster. So much for her; as for
Miss HILL, she has done work that is more convincing,
and will, I am confident, do it again.
I can hardly suppose Mr. ANTHoNY Hope innocent of a
sly intent to score off his readers in the matter of Beau-
maroy Home from the Wars (METHUEN). As early as
page 38 does the identity of the elderly recluse, whom
Beaumaroy kept secluded in Tower Cottage, begin (ap-
parently) to reveal itself to the astute. Bit by bit, and
as it were casually, you hear of his passion for speech-
making, his harsh voice, violent temper and disabled arm.
Aha! And then, as I say, it all turns out no such matter,
but just Mr. HoPE's little joke in thus presenting a harmless
megalomaniac as the arch-criminal that he imagined him-
self. All this is good entertainment enough ; the trouble is
that, once the revelation is made, the gas is out of the balloon,
beyond the power of any subsequent effort to reinflate it.
In other words, Mr. HoPE seems, strangely for so practised
a craftsman, to have started his tale without material
enough to keep it going. For my own part at least the
moral problem of whether Beaumaroy will collar the money
left by old Saffron. or he redeemed by his love for a lav-

figure heroine named Mary, entirely failed to excite any
interest. Eventually, of course, Romance has it; the Saffrom
(or yellow) gold goes to its rightful heirs, and we leave
Beaumaroy with a bank-balance well lost for love. I fear I
must call him but a degenerate successor of those heroes,
gallant, humorous or cynical, from the same pen who have
given me so much enjoyment in the past.
Except for the amiable confidant, the sleuth-hounds of fic-
tion as a rule range splendidly alone. Whether panting over
the housetops in pursuit of their prey or battling with brain
waves in the depths of an armchair, they scorn the intelli-
gent accomplice. If anyone is allowed for a moment to
overshadow their masterly cunning it is the dark sinister
figure in the centre of that web of villainies which for so
had found a Cubist fourth leg on a chair purporting to be
a Jacobean “reproduction ” (with worm-holes).
The Red One (MILLs AND Boon) is, I should judge, that
sort of hasty posthumous collection of a dead author's un-
published odds and ends which is apt not to enhance his
reputation. Mr. JACK LoNDoN had consistently done better
work than these four shortish stories. The first, which
gives its title to the volume, is a story of taboos and human
sacrifices and a wonderful dome of metal (dropped from
another world?) of which the wonderful reverberations
were taken for the voice of the god. It just fails to get
home. “The Hussy" tells competently but not quite
effectively the story of a gigantic nugget finder with a
jealous wife. “Argus of the Ancient Times " deals with the
long have baffled the secret ser-
vice of two continents or more. H
Mr. HULBERT Footner has, I
think, created a new model for
detective fiction in the business-
like practitioner with an office,
who receives intelligence reports
from half-a-dozen subordinates,
and is in fact entirely dependent
upon one of them for the final
triumph of right. If I have any
fault to find with Thieves' Wit
(Hodder AND StoughTon) as an
American yarn of the discom-
fiture of crooks in the jewel
line, it is that there is too much
organisation and too littlerough-
and-tumble. I had almost begun
to fear that nobody, after all,

revolvers or so in his teeth. But

road to Klondike and wealth.
Parts of it are quite excellent.
I conceive that it would have
been retouched by a clever and
conscientious hand. “The Prin-
cess” is a quite unconvincing
and desperately squalid inter-
lude in the life of three “alki-
stiffs" who had degenerated into
“stew-bums”—anglice the lowest
type of drunken tramp. Perhaps
the disgust which nauseates one
was just the effect that this
far-and-deep-travelled master of
violent-coloured language de-
signed to create. But I must
read White Fangs again to take
the bad taste away.
The scenes of The Enchanted
Pen (METHUEN) are laid at the
Court of the King of the Hundred
Towns, whither various suitors
came to win the hand of the
Princess Celandine. At the best
of times it could have been no
easy matter to court such a
sprightly lady as the Princess,
but these times were exception-
ally out of joint for such pur-
poses because the fairies had
taken things in hand. Directly
a suitor (or a non-suitor for that
matter) got possession of the pen
between the Pope and FREDERIck II., Emperor of the
Holy Roman Empire. I have more than a suspicion
that, after the economical habit which is growing upon
our novelists, he has warmed up the hero of a former book
in that secretary to the Count of Soissons, Mark Bisson,
who, half-priest and widower, tells with due modesty how
he saved the EMPEROR's life and won himself a second
bride. There are desperate gallops to warn or rescue,
rivers in flood to swim on horseback, a hand-to-hand fight
with a hunch-back as strong and wicked as only hunch-
backs in fiction know how to be, and a readable report of
the Council of Lyons, of 1245, with the Earl of Norfolk
setting the fashion for Cook's tourists by proclaiming the
superiority of English customs at every opportunity. The
Betrayers is, of course, not what furniture shops call “real
antique,” but it is at least so good a copy that once or
twice, when, for instance, Mark, in a well-flavoured passage
about lampreys, full of atmosphere, remarked “the palate
cannot sense its blessings,” I was as much surprised as if I
he became a most violent socialist, and gave the poor old
King more shocks than were good for a man of his age. The
whole story is a curious jumble, but Miss EDITHA BLAIKLEY
disarms this criticism by proclaiming, on the second page
of her book, that “accurate-minded persons who become
restive when stories betray a careless disregard for ana-
chronisms had better pause . . . .” For myself—though
I will yield to nobody in accuracy of mind—I went straight
on without stopping and fared none the worse for that.
“One of the most effective devices to catch the motor thief was
exhibited in Long Acre yesterday.
The device, which will fit any make of car, provides for the sounding
of a loud gong immediately the car is moved, which continues all

242 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 17, 1919.
THE LAST STRAW.
It was one of those summer evenings
with the chill on, so after dinner we lit
the smoking-room fire and wondered
what to do. There were eight of us;
just the right number for two bridge
tables, or four picquet pairs, or eight
patience singles.
“Oh, no, not cards,” said Celia
quickly. “They're so dull.”
| “Not when you get a grand slam,”
said our host, thinking of an accident
which had happened to him the night
before. -
| “Even then I don't suppose anybody
laughed.” -
Peter and I, who were partners on
| that occasion, admitted that we hadn't
| laughed.
| “Well, there you are,” said Celia
| triumphantly. “Let's play proverbs.”
“I don't think I know it,” said
Herbert. (He wouldn't.)
| “Oh, it's quite easy. First you think
of a proverb.”
“Like ‘A burnt camel spoils the
moss,’” I explained.
“You mean ‘A burnt child dreads
| the fire,’” corrected Herbert.
Celia caught my eye and went on
| hurriedly, “Well, then somebody goes
outside, and then he asks questions—"
| “From outside?” asked Mrs. Herbert.
“From inside,” I assured her.
| “Generally from very near the fire,
| because he has got so cold waiting in
the hall.” -
“Oh, yes, I see.' - .
“And then he asks questions, and we
each have to get one of the words of
the proverb into our answer, without
letting him know what the proverb is.
It's rather fun.”
Peter and his wife, who knew the
game, agreed. Mrs. Herbert seemed
resigned to the worst, but Herbert,
| though faint, was still pursuing.
“But doesn't he guess what the pro-
verb is 2'' he asked. -
“Sometimes,” I admitted. “But
sometimes, if we are very, very clever,
he doesn't. That, in fact, is the game.”
Our host got up and went to the
door. º
“I think I see,” he said; “and I want
my pipe anyhow. So I'll go out first.”
“Now then,” said Celia, when the
door was safely closed, “what shall we
have 2"
Of course you know this game, and
you know the difficulty of thinking of a

difficult word is “mend.’”
“We mustn't have less than seven
words, one for each of us.”
“Can't we get something from Solo-
MON for a change?” said Peter. “‘A
roaring lion is a calamity to his father,
but the cautious man cometh not again.'
That sort of thing.”
“We might try it,” said Celia doubt-
fully, not feeling quite sure if it were
a real proverb; “but ‘cometh’ would be
difficult.”
“I don't see why,” said Herbert.
“One could always work it in some.
how.” -
“Well, of course, if he asked you,
“By what train cometh thou up in
the mornings?’ you could answer, ‘I
cometh up by the ten-fifteen.’ Only
you don't get that sort of question as a
rule.” º
“Oh, I see,” said Herbert. “I didn't
quite understand.”
“I expect we shall have to fall back
on a camel after all,” said Celia. “It’s
the last straw that breaks the camel's
back.’ Who'll do ‘camel's ’2 You 'd
better,” she added kindly to me.
Everybody but myself seemed to
think that this was a good idea.
“I’ll do ‘straw,’” said Peter gener-
ously, whereupon Celia volunteered for
“breaks.” There were seven of us for
nine words. We gave Mrs. Herbert
the second “the,” fearing to trust her
with anything more alarming, and in
order to keep it in the family we gave
the other “the " to Herbert, who was
also responsible for “back.” Our hostess
had “last ’’ and Mrs. Peter had “that.”
All this being settled, our host was
admitted into his smoking-room again.
“You begin with me,” I said, and I
was promptly asked, “How many blue
beans make five 2 ” When I had made
a suitable answer into which “it’s ”
came without much difficulty, our host
turned to Herbert. Herbert's face had
already assumed a look of strained
expectancy. - -
“Well, Herbert, what do you think
of LLoyd GEORGE 2 " .
“Yes,” said Herbert. “Yes—er—
yes.” He wiped the perspiration from
his brow. “IIe-er—that is to say
I–er—LLOYD GEORGE, yes.”
“Is that the answer?” said our host,
rather surprised.
Herbert explained hastily that he
hadn't really begun yet, and with the
aid of an anecdote about a cousin of his
who had met WINSTON CHURCHILL at
Dieppe once, he managed to get “the "
in several times before blowing his
nose vigorously and announcing that
he had finished.
“I believe he's playing a different
game," murmured Celia to Mrs. Peter.
“The only
The next three words were disposed
of easily enough, a lucky question to
Peter about the weather giving him an
opportunity to refer to his straw hat.
It was now Celia's turn for “breaks.”
“Nervous 2 " I asked her.
“All of a twitter,” she said.
“Well, Celia,” said our host, “how
long are you going to stay with us?”
“Oh, a long time yet,” said Celia
confidently.
“Till Wednesday, anyhow,” I inter-
rupted, thinking it a good opportunity
to clinch the matter. . * .
“We generally stay,” explained Celia,
“until our host breaks it to us that he
can't stick us any longer.” -
“Not that that often happens,” I
added. -
“Look here, which of you is answer-
ing the question ?” - -
“I am,” said Celia firmly.
“Well, have you answered it yet?”
“To tell the truth I've quite for-
gotten the word that Oh, I re-
member now. Yes,” she went on very
distinctly and slowly, “I hope to re-
main underyour roof until next Wednes-
day morn. Whew ' " and she fanned
herself with her handkerchief. -
Mrs. Herbert repeated her husband's
triumph with “the,” and then it was
my turn again for these horrible camels.
My only hope was that our host would
ask me if I had been to the Zoo lately,
but I didn't see why he should. He
didn't. - - - - -
“Would it surprise you to hear,” he
asked, “that the President of Czecho-
Slovakia has a very long beard?”
“If it had only been “goats,’” I
murmured to myself. Aloud I said,
“What?” in the hope of gaining a
little more time.
He repeated his question.
“No,” I said slowly, “no, it wouldn't,”
and I telegraphed an appeal to Celia
for help. She nodded back at me.
“Have you finished?” asked our host.
“Good lord, no, I shall be half-an-
hour yet. The fact is you've asked the
wrong question. You see, I've got to
get in moss.’”
“I thought it was camels,
Celia carelessly.
“No, moss.' Now if you'd only
asked me a question about gardening
You see, the proverb we wanted
to have first of all was ‘People who
live in glass houses shouldn't throw
stones,' only throw was so difficult.
Almost as difficult as ” I turned
to Celia. “What was it you said just
now 2 ''
“Camels,” said Celia.
“‘Camels, yes, or ‘stable-doors, or
‘horses.’ However, there it is,” and
I enlarged a little more on the difficulty
of getting in these very difficult words.

“Thank you very much,” said our
host faintly when I had finished.
It was the last straw which broke
the camel's back, and it was Herbert who
stepped forward blithely with the last
straw. Our host, as he admitted after-
wards, was still quite in the dark, and
with his last question he presented
Herbert with an absolute gift.
“When do you go back to Devon-
shire?” he asked.
“We—er—return next month,” an-

added hastily, “we go back next
month.”

THE PINK ENVELOPE.
SoME philosopher once observed that
the good man is never nervous when the
post arrives. I may claim to be a very
good man. I await the post calmly
confident that no one who owes me
money will have sent it me, and that
everyone I owe money to will be asking
for it. But I have no hideous secret to
conceal. No blackmailer preys on me.
I am willing to make an agreement that
anyone can read all my letters on con-
dition that he takes on himself the
burden of answering them.
When Jane brought in the post the
other morning I could feel that her eyes
rested on the topmost letter of the pile
she handed to me. It was a note in a
pink, oblong, slightly scented envelope,
addressed to me in a lady's writing.
Never before did I receive a billet-doux,
yet I recognised this as one at the first
glance. I saw my wife's eyes stray from
her letters towards the pink envelope.
My conscience was clear, but my hue
became that of the envelope. I won-
dered that Jane, who evidently recog-
nised the nature of the missive, had so
little tact as to place it on the top of
my letters. No one had any reason for
writing love-letters to me, but if some
too susceptible lady had discovered
charm in me I felt that she would
have shown more discretion if she had
written to my club. I temporised,
opening my other letters first.
“Plumber's bill, my dear. He's
charged £3 13s. 2d., and he only had
two men here for one afternoon.”
For once my wife failed to denounce
the miscreant profiteers.
“Here's a note that the library
subscription is due. Could you look
in and pay it when you are in town
to-day?”
My wife agreed mechanically,
“Harold is writing again. Nothing
particular in it. Full of anecdotes of
the wonderful things his children say
and do.”
My wife omitted for once to comment
with acerbity on the extraordinary in-
fatuation my brother had for his own
children, and his amazing neglect of
far cleverer and prettier nephews and
nieces.
At last I came to IT. There was a
silence that could be felt. I wondered
if Jane were listening outside the
breakfast-room door.
“H'm, what's this?” I said in tones
which I strove to render casual. I felt
that my remark rang painfully false
and that it was enough to justify deep
suspicion. I tore the pink envelope
open. What should I say about this
poor infatuated woman?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I glanced at the letter and passed it
across to my wife.
“Extraordinary methods money-
lenders have nowadays,” I remarked.
“Think of a circular like that being
sent out in a pink envelope addressed
in a woman's hand.”
“What did you say that plumber
charged 2" asked my wife. The tragic
episode was over.
I foresee much trouble from these
new business methods. I picture hus-
bands furtively sliding these pink letters
away into their pockets, to be opened in
secret. I picture wives steaming the
envelopes to see what the wicked woman
has been writing to him. It is true they
will find nothing compromising, only
that the New Imperial Finance Com-
pany is prepared to lend any sum up to
fifty thousand pounds on note of hand
at five per cent., omitting to state
whether it is five per cent, per day,
week or month. But the seed of sus-
picion will have been sown.
Still the pink envelope has brought
me one clear gain. Jane can't have
been listening at the door when I
opened the letter. Since that morning
she has regarded me with increased
respect. I am no ordinary employer,
but a person with a past—not to say a
present. I fear that the old saying is
true, that every woman at heart (ex-
cept, perhaps, his wife) loves a rake.

DEAR SIR,--I am writing a book on
old English customs and should greatly
appreciate information as to when
Cricket was first played on the hearth.
I should also like a few particulars of
what must have been a somewhat re-
stricted game, similar in scope, I take
it, to Parlour Croquet.

DEAR SIR,--I was much interested
in your letter about the possibility of
the middle stump being left standing
whilst both the off and on stumps were
levelled. I now wonder if any of your
readers could inform me of an authentic
case of all three stumps, or even the
middle stump only, being removed but
the bails not falling; and in such a case
would the batsman be out 2

connection between the letter H and
good cricket, I might repeat a remark
which I overheard at the Oval not very
long ago. The prevalence of aitches in
the Surrey team was again under dis-
cussion, and the speaker, who was a
man of few or no aspirations, began to
enumerate them. “There's 'obbs,” he
said, “and 'ARRIson and 'ITCH and
'owell. I think that 's all.” “No,”
said the other, “the two HABELs.”
I am, Yours, etc., OvaLITE.
DEAR SIR,--I remember a Gentlemen
v. Players match at Lords some twenty
or thirty years ago, when the Gentle-
men were led into the field by a yery
big man who differed from the others
not only by his commanding stature
but by wearing a large black beard.
Cricketers being as a rule clean-shaven,
or at most wearing a moustache, it was
at once clear to me that this player
was, for purposes of his own, masquer-
ading, and had been to CLARKSON's.
Try as I might, I could not however
discover his identity, as he was referred
to by the crowd (another suspicious
sign) merely by initials. It would be a
great load off my mind if one of your
readers who chances to remember this
match can enlighten me.
Yours, etc., INQUISITIVE.
DEAR SIR,-No historian of cricket
who proposed to include a chapter on
inexpert players of the game should
omit the author of Alice in Wonderland,
to whom is credited the famous remark
that he went on to bowl only once, and
then bowled only one ball, which, he
was informed, would have been a wide

AN infinitesimal flaxen-haired atom sat in a puddle before
the Highland Arms Hotel, splashing itself and its clothes
and shouting for glee. Beside it stood a dignified turbaned
figure, pleading earnestly in Hindustani.
“Huzoor,” it said, “listen to the word of thy servant and
rise; her honour thy mother will upbraid if she see thee
there. And behold, even to-morrow thy servant must leave
the Presence and set forth again upon the black water;
shall he go with a downcast face because the Presence has
taken cold 2’’ All this it said and much more, and the
Presence continued to wallow with callous joy.
Then on the doorstep of the hotel appeared the bit red-
headed nursemaid from Morayshire, who has recently
joined the party. “Bh, Sahndy,” she cried, “get oop oot

PRODUCTION AND ECONOMY.
“THE only things to save this country
from irreparable ruin,” said Whortle-
bury over the little hedge that parts
our gardens, “are increased productivity
and ruthless economy. Have a cigar.”
I accepted his offer. “True, true,”
1 said gravely.
Although Whortlebury is a journalist
I am not always in unqualified agree-
ment with his dicta, but in this case
I felt he had authority behind him.
I am sure I have seen the same thing
said before, somewhere.
“‘More work and less play' must
be our watchword. Every additional
hour you put in means so much more
employment for your fellow-workmen.
Shorter hours and excessive wages
spell starvation for your next-door
neighbour.”
“Admirably put,” I exclaimed;
“would that everyone thought as you
do, Whortlebury. What a merry land
this England of ours would be.”
Whortlebury waved his hand in
modest deprecation. “Plain common
sense,” he observed, “only they won't
realize it. They'll discover their mis-
take when the nation goes bankrupt.”
“True,” I groaned.
“By the way,” went on Whortlebury
more brightly, “did I tell you my latest
idea for the garden? I'm having the
marrow bed and the potato patch there
levelled over and laid with turf this
autumn, so that we can get some
tennis next summer. I've been want-
ing to do it for years, but I couldn't
afford it.”
“Won't it be rather an expensive
job just now 2" I asked.
“Afraid it will,” said Whortlebury
lightly, “but it will be well worth it
next year.”
“But,” I hazarded timidly, “what
about the need for increased production
and ruthless economy? Wouldn't this
be rather a bad example to set the
nation ?”
Whortlebury was in no way abashed.
“Pool,” he said, “there is no connec-
tion at all. I was referring to the
country at large. I've had enough of
work and worry and self-denial these
last five years; I mean to enjoy life a
bit now. What's the use of making
yourself miserable? Besides, between
ourselves, you know, a lot of these
warnings and pessimistie speeches are
nothing but bluff, to scare us out of
our pleasures and make up for Govern-
ment extravagance. Why doesn't the
Government do more to cut down its
own expenditure if the facts are as
serious as they tell us?”
Whortlebury's is a dominating per-
sonality, and I didn't like to say any-
thing more at the time. As I was
reading my paper later in the evening,
however, an exceedingly telling article
caught my eye. It was headed “Econ-
omy or Ruin,” and in trenchant phrases
it set forth the alternatives of individual
retrenchment or public disaster. “You,”
The action of
it concluded, “must eut down your ex-
penses.” I felt it was my duty to bring
this to Whortlebury's notice.
I handed it to him next morning in
the train. “Very sound article that,”
I said. -
Whortlebury glanced his eye down
the column. “Yes, I think it does
rather touch the spot,” he observed,

2s PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[SEPTEMBER 17, 1919.
PETER GOES GOLFING.
Peter belongs to the “old school,"
so he says. But whether he says it
because he went to Winchester in the
days of his not far-distant youth, or
whether it is because he says “gad-
zooks!” instead of — anything else,
when he foozles his drive, I do not
know.
James is somewhat of a contrast,
and yet they have a certain amount in
common; at any rate they find common
topics to quarrel about. For instance,
if Peter says that the KAISER ought to
be hanged James will not counter with
an assertion that white Leghorns are
better than buff Orpingtons; he will
simply reply that the KAISER is a
human being.
Then they will fight for half-an-hour
or so, and after that go out for a
friendly game of golf.
Golf, by the way, is a game at which
neither excels, but at which both are
ambitious. James goes out chiefly for
exercise and plays with a care-free
devilry. Peter is the sort of man who
would set up a theodolite and take
bearings all over the green before he
condescends to push his ball (more or
less) towards the hole. But he would
do it, not in order to facilitate his putt
—probably he would not know how to
use a theodolite—but to impress others
with his precision.
Take last Tuesday, for example.
James and Peter went to watch the
finals of some very important foursomes.
I too went, and noticed with surprise
—nay, alarm—that Peter was carrying
clubs and was dressed in a large and
sloppy cap, a sport's-coat of the same
quality, breeches to match and pale grey
stockings. In fact he looked the over-
compleat golfer. I questioned him on
all this and was given to understand
that he wished to be taken—this James
corrected to “mis-taken "-for one of
the players.
And let it here be said to Peter's
credit that he is in no wise ashamed
of being an abominable swank; in fact
he rather glories in it. As I say, it is
all to his credit. -
“You see,” he pointed out ingenu-
ously, “there are so many players in
a foursome–four to be precise—hence
the name.”
I am not really a duffer at this sort
of thing, but Peter likes to think he
knows more than I do.
“Pray continue,” I said coldly.
“And, since this is so, no one finds
out till the eighteenth hole is neared—
the eighteenth, you know, is the last—
exactly who the players are. Thus for
approximately seventeen holes I shall
have the unparalleled though passing
glory of being taken for—who knows?
—the champion, perhaps.”
As I pointed out, Peter is ambitious.
I made a suitable remark and we
passed on. James was silent.
Arrived at the first tee, we found
that some fifty persons had turned out,
and before these Peter paraded himself,
by numbers and omnipotently.
A full account of the game would be
superfluous here; suffice to say that at
the seventeenth hole the parties con-
cerned were all square. The excite-
ment was intense; even Peter began to
take more interest in the game than in
himself. In this wise the last hole was
reached, and on the green one pair had
two strokes to win. A caddy, in attire
somewhat similar to Peter's, stood at
the flag and contemplated the distance.
He whose turn it was to play walked
backwards, crouching down, as is the
wont of golfers on the green. Then,
having satisfied himself that the hole
was still there, he took aim and hit.
The ball rolled towards the hole—no,
it would not go down this time; but it
would leave an easy shot for his part-
ner. The game was as good as won,
when lo! the unexpected happened.
Cannoning off a piece of dust which the
reckless player had neglected to blow
away, the ball hit the caddy's foot!
O reader, if thou playest not golf,
know well that if your ball hits your
own caddy the hole is lost, and if the
hole be the last one and you are all
square then you lose the match.
The crowd dispersed, when down
upon them, as a wolf on the fold, came
The Daily Snap Man, as all Press
photographers are known. Bouncing
down, he aimed his implement straight
at Peter! Peter swelled. He posed.
He lit a cigarette. He threw it away
and lit a cigar. It was the end of a
perfect day. -
-k :: * ::: : :::
This is the beginning of the next one.
The scene is laid in the lodgings we
share together—James, Peter and my-
self. The time is that of breakfast.
Enter Peter. He leaps on The Daily
Snap and opens it. Turning feverishly
over the pages he at length descries
his likeness.
“Here is fame!” he said, and started
to read the paragraph beneath.
He read, “We append a photo of the

These imported varieties are all very
well, but give us home-grown Quar-
rendens.
AN 0PTIMIST OF THE BALKANS.
I HAD spread my English newspaper
on the table of the café, in the shade
of a great tree in the square of the
little Macedonian town, and my friend,
Captain Aristides Epiglottis, was dip-
ping into it.
“This paper 'ere,” he observed, por-
ing over an editorial, “’e 'as it all very
plain. I read the English papers with
much pleasure. I am great reader, me.”
I agreed politely.
“'E say 'ere,” continued Aristides,
“that this war 'as been wasted and
unproductive effort from many points
of view. That is very right. In the
Turk war I kill eight men. In the Bul-
gar war I kill five officers what was
drinking in a brasserie. And 'ow many
'ave I kill in this war? No one at all.”
This seemed extraordinary hard luck.
“Since you Allies 'ave land at Salon-
ique we 'ave 'ad no Comitadjis, no raid
by the Bulgar, no villages burned—
nothing. You 'ave gendarmes every-
where, and you not allow our people
to 'ave guns. It is ennuyant–so very
quiet. My papa 'e was Comitadji—
what you call bandit—and 'e burn
twenty villages before 'e was kill. I
'ave not burn any village at all.”
I nodded sympathetically. It must
be awful not to have burned even one
village.
“As your paper say, ‘though the pre-
war status has gone for ever'—hélas,
the jolly times— our prospects are not
hopeless.' That is right. We 'ave now
more material of guns than ever before.
Nowhere could we 'ave obtain so much.
It would not have been given, the so
much credit. But since all the world
'ave also more - material, to what
advantage are we?”
Overcome by the pathos of this he
got up and kicked a beggar.
“'E say again 'ere,” he continued, re-
suming his seat, “‘we can accomplish
nothing without giving full confidence
to our leaders.' We also in the Balkans,
we give our confidence to our leaders,
and we soldiers are sure that all will
be well.”
His eyes brightened at his happy
thoughts.
“Yes, certainement. When the Allies
are gone from the Balkans and all the
trouble finish, and we are left in peace,
then we shall make up for the time lost.
We shall 'ave, by ourselves and with
none to interfere, another war, a so
beautiful private war.”
And he drained his mastik as one
who drinks to a Day.

BRITAIN'S SEA DOGS.
[“The huge men-o’-war lay peacefully at
anchor. An almost deathly stillness reigned.
Suddenly out of the silence a bo'sun's pipe
shrilled across the tranquil waters of the
Solent. As if by magic the scene was trans-
formed from one of peace to that of orderly
and disciplined confusion; the air was alive
with the hoarse cries of the officers mingling
with the cheery ‘Ay, Ay's' of the men.”—
Eactract from any Daily Paper during any
ſaval Review.]
“YEo-Ho, my hearties, avast, belay.
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner, and
let the crew cast loose the bow-chaser!"
raucously bawls the Captain from the
poop, a commanding figure as he
stands with his blind eye to his tele-
scope focussed on the one-piece bathing
costumes on Ryde beach.
“Mr. Bo'sun, pipe the fo'cslemen
into the port ratlines and bowse to the
main brace. Let the idlers cat the
davit, and smart about it.”
Acidly the First Lieutenant inter-
prets his senior's orders as he flings
his megaphone at the side-boy, who is
recklessly chewing a plug of tobacco.
“Ay, ay, Sir,” replies the side-boy
cheerily as he receives the butt-end of
the missile in his starboard eye.
Meanwhile the decks present a pic-
ture of orderly activity. The watch
are heaving lustily on the capstan,
hitching up their trousers after their
rough sailor fashion. As the anchor
tumbles home snatches of old-time
chanties float up to windward on a lee
breeze—“Rolling down to Rio,” “Every
nice girl loves a sailor,” and a score
of others. Now and then the bo'sun's
mate may be heard giving a cheery
“Ay, ay,” on his shrill pipe. -
“Cooks to the galley; way aloft the
Captain of the Hold; lay aft the Marines
on the fore chains!” roars the gunner as
he lowers a lantern into the magazine
to make sure the powder is dry.
As the ship gathers way the leads-
men swing their leads in a manner born
of long practice.
“By the mark nine,” the starboard
chains report.
“A quarter less three,’
the port leadsman.
“Very good,” the keen-eyed officer
of the watch replies, and the leads
swing on, guiding the ship into the
deeper channels.
The Quartermaster, a grizzled old
seaman of forty summers, cautiously
comes from
moves the helm first one way and then
the other, feeling his path through the
difficult shoals. His eyes fixed on the
distant horizon, he croons “The Death
of Nelson" softly to himself, his deep
bass voice mingling with the tenor of
the Navigator, who is leaning against
the meridian humming “The sailor's
wife the soldier's star shall be,” and
idly turning the pages of the patent log.
The Middies all this time have not
been idle, although their treble cries, half
hoarse, half cheery, of “Yeo-ho-ho for a
bottle of rum" have been drowned in the
orderly confusion of getting under way.
It is their duty to walk smartly up and
down the decks amidships (hence the
name Midshipmen), with one eye
cocked on the weather. At the slight-
est sign of the weather changing they
at once report to the Captain, who
testily replies, “It's not.” That is
why these bright-eyed lads are some-
times called “Snotties.”
All are now busy with the navigation
of the ship.
“From Ushant to Scilly is forty-five
leagues,” shouts the Captain still more
hoarsely, for the strain of the voyage
is beginning to tell on his nerves. A

frown passes over the Navigator's face,
for he is primarily responsible for the
safety of the ship.
“Ay, ay, Sir.” The Quartermaster's
acknowledgment is none too cordial, for
he is a West-countryman, with a wife
and children, whereas the ship appears
to be heading towards Chatham.
Suddenly there is a grinding and
crushing sound and the ship comes up
all standing.
“Land right ahead ' " shouts the
look-out in the crow's-nest. He does
not turn a hair, though he knows full
well that his devotion to duty may cost
him his life.
“Shiver my timbers!” howls the
Captain in a voice so hoarse it is little
more than a whisper. The cunning old
sea-dog is never at a loss.
The scene is now one of well-drilled
disorganisation. -
“All hands on deck '''
The Captain, foo hoarse to speak,
rushes blindly forward into the eyes of
the ship to interview the now infuriated
Commodore of the Southsea bathing-
machines. As he carelessly treads on
each pair of bronzed and knotted hands
the men cry cheerily, after the kindly
manner of the sailorman, “Ay, ay, Sir.”
THE LONG TRAIL.
THIS is a warning. I issue it because
I have just read an article on “How
to become a writer.” It is on the
woman's page of a popular newspaper,
and is sure to be widely read. It states
with colloquial ease and a split infini-
tive that “to really write well is most
frightfully easy.”
Now, before any harm is done, I
want to warn people (who hitherto
may have led blameless lives) against
starting on a career as a writer. I am
going to tell you exactly what will
happen to you if you won't take my
advice.
You will begin by writing a tragic
novel, of course. It will be most dread-
fully sad and extremely long. That is
the preliminary step. As you are not
likely to possess a typewriter of your
own, you must now pay to have your
novel typed. This (including paper)
will cost you 1s. 6d. per thousand words
(carbon copies extra). Next, you look
up the names of the publishers. There
are three hundred and seven in Great
Britain, so you have a good selection.
Of course, you will deliver your book
in person. Experienced writers prefer
the medium of the post, just as one
would choose to give a bear a bun on
the end of an umbrella instead of
handing it. But you budding writers
are all the same. You want to impress
the man with your personality; also
to discuss a few important points in
your novel, and so arouse his interest
that he will be devoured by curiosity
to read it on the instant. With your
script under your arm, therefore, you
will arrive at the office of a publisher.
No matter whom you have chosen he
will belong to one of the following
groups:—
(1) The publisher in a hurry.
(2) The publisher with insuperable
difficulties.
(3) The publisher suffering from dead
loss.
At the office of (1) you are shown
into a small waiting-room, in which is
a table but no other visible means of
support. You stand, therefore, for a
long time until the publisher—or his
secretary—dashes in. He pushes his
hair back from his forehead in a wild
way and says, “Ah, good-morning-is-
it-a-book-you-wish-me-to-look-at?” as
if you were showing a side line in
something else.

standing facing a man whose breath is
coming in sharp, hurried gasps, who is
holding his watch in his hand and
keeping the door open with his foot ”
$omehow, it doesn't tend to conversa-
tional assurance. You mutter an apol-
| ogy and shuffle away, even forgetting,
sometimes, to leave your novel bellind.
In the case of (2) you are received,
but only to hear how bitter the life of
a publisher can be. You may have
pictured him sitting at ease, a demi-god
ordering the destinies of others and
having, on the whole, rather a good time.
But when you leave you are so over-
come by the poor fellow's daily suffer-
ings, his oppression by reviewers, the
difficulties of distribution and his almost
hopeless battle with the binders, that
you cannot bring yourself to leave your
book with him and thus add another
drop to his cup of misery.
Then there is (3). You are greeted
with much politeness and asked to sit
down—which will astonish you, having
by this time begun to notice that the
dearth of chairs in publishers' offices is
nothing short of amazing.
Emboldened, you tell of your hopes
and fears, and particularly that stirring
incident in your novel on page 574.
The publisher listens courteously and
declares that it sounds “very good
stuff.” You thrill. You soar to the
stars, coming down in time to hear
him speaking of the loss entailed by
taking up new authors. In fact, the
entire business of publishing is a dead
loss, he will tell you. This may strike
you as strange, because his office is
more opulent than any you have yet
visited. -
Knocking the ash from the end of
his half-crown cigar, he will tell you,
brave fellow, of his struggle for exist-
ence and utter inability at the moment
to take on the grave risk of launching
a new writer. At the same time he
seems convinced of your undoubted
genius. Perhaps, as this is your first
book, you would not mind paying the
entire cost of publication yourself?
I think some of you must do this—
otherwise why is the world so full of
rich publishers and poor novels?

AT THE PLAY.
“THE CHOICE.”
“I'M sick of these strong silent
men,” says Lady Jemima Ballardaíle,
sister of the eleventh Lord Sandhills;
and, though she was only a great lady
of the old school and could never
remember the names of people outside
the pale, she sometimes contrived to
articulate the vulgar view. Not that
the epithet “silent" was really applic-
abke to the Rt. Hon. John Cordways
(indeed I have never seen an actor-
manager in a really silent part); but
she was right about his strength. He
was frightfully strong. In the opinion
of his elder brother, Timothy, who
worshipped him, he was one of the
five men who had won the War
on the home front--an arbitrary
estimate, perhaps ; I should cer-
tainly have put the figure nearer
five thousand. But he had one
weakness: he knew nothing of
women. He was under the im-
pression that he could take on just
any woman for his wife with the
same masterful ease with which
he could appoint a new director
to the board of Cordways, Limited.
Incidentally he was, according to
his own statement, a visionary;
and no doubt it had occurred to
him that, if he did a little better
than Arthur of the “Idylls,” and
got hold of the right Guinevere,
“A woman in her womanhood as great
As he was in his manhood, then . . .
The twain together well might
change the world.”
Unfortunately his choice fell, very
suddenly and with appalling inap-
propriateness, upon Lady Clarissa
Caerleon, the idol of a hundred
“boys,” a young lady whose re-
sponse to the call of her country had
taken the form of jazzing, assisting
at fancy bazaars and charity matinées,
and generally serving as the mainstay
of the Society Picture-press in its efforts
to win the War.
As for her—and I suppose it must
be true because we got it out of a brief
autobiography which she sketched for
us later on—she was at first attracted
by his blunt rudeness, a new ex-
perience for her; then hypnotised by
his terrific strength, and finally flattered
by being selected by such a superman.
I did not gather, whatever he may have
alleged, that love on either side had
much to do with a contract concluded at
the third time of meeting; certainly no-
body, except Cordways himself (and this
made me suspect that his intelligence
was not commensurate with his
strength), was astonished when the very
next day his irresistible force came up

against the lady's immovable senti-
ment. She had pledged her word to
secure the restoration of a brave soldier
who had been dismissed by Cordways
from his employ on the ground of re-
peated drunkenness; but the master
remained adamant and the marriage
was off.
Cordways, you see, held the very
sound view that you cannot win a peace,
any more than you can win a war, with-
out discipline. He must therefore make
an example of this insubordinate fellow,
Ayncliffe (I don't know how to spell his
name, as he wasn't in the cast). In
defiance therefore of pressure brought
to bear by his brother, by Lady Clarissa,

and even by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE (who,
like Ayncliffe, was regrettably absent
from the programme); in spite of a hos-
tile Press, and in face of a threatened
strike of his employees (somebody had
already drawn blood from his finger with
a missile—to the general surprise, for we
had supposed him invulnerable), he held
to his principle. Finally, we were in-
formed that at great personal risk he
had attended a mass meeting of his in-
dignant employees, moved an amend-
ment approving the dismissal of Ayn-
cliffe and carried everybody away by his
eloquence, including Aymcliffe himself.
And what was the result for the in-
subordinate? you ask. Exactly; that's
what we were all asking. Was he rein-

was that Ayncliffe was “all right.”

in that case there would have been no

pointment for Mr. SUTRo and all of us.

or not, was “all right,” and so was

restored to the arms of Cordways (I say
“arms,” but in point of fact the strong
man took a strong line of his own when
giving vent to his affections; substi-
tuting for the usual embrace a friendly
spank on the lady's arm or even her
head). Instead, she recurred to Robert
Dalman, one of her old “boys,” a good
fellow who had worked under Cordways.
The latter was very generous about it,
though I could not accept his pre-
tence to a broken heart when I re-
called the primitive brevity of his
wooing and his marked freedom
from emotional transports. Still
he was very nice about it, and pro-
moted his supplanter. One was
a little reminded, though the cir-
cumstances in Mr. SUTRo's play are
much less painful, of the attitude
of the man in La Femme de Claude
towards the apprentice who had
stolen his wife's affections. You
will remember how the curtain
falls on his invitation to the suc-
cessful rival to get on with his
work—“Et tu, viens travailler.”
If Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER en-
joyed playing Cordways, he con-
trived, very artistically, to conceal
it. I think it creditable to Mr.
SUTRo that he should have induced
him to take a part which was
bound to leave the sympathies of
the audience a little doubtful. It
is perhaps a compliment to Miss
Viola TREE to say that in the
opening Act neither her voice nor
her gestures recalled the deadly
type upon which Lady Clarissa was
modelled. You could see that she had
studied it conscientiously (more, so
perhaps than the author, who gave
her some rather improbable things
to say), but the result lacked colour
and spontaneity. Later, when Lady
Clarissa discovered traces of a heart,
Miss TREE's natural sincerity and per-
sonal charm were given their oppor-
tunity. But the most attractive per-
formance was that of Mr. LEON QUAR-
TERMAINE as Dalman, a very difficult
part played with a fine sensitiveness.
The humours of Lord Sandhills (Mr.
GILBERT HARE) and Lady Jemima
(Miss CoMPToN) were as water in a
thirsty land. Miss CoMPtoN indeed is
a gift to any author. It is not what
you make her say that matters; it's
her irresistible way of saying it. Mr.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIARY OF A MONTESSORIAN.
I. -
September 10.—To-night, after reading
the interview with Signora MonTEssori
in The Daily Graphic, decided with
Edwin's approval to carry out her sug-
gestions for remodelling our home life
in the interests of our children. Eva
is eight and Jack nearly six; they are
returning to-morrow from their aunt's
at Cromer, and something must be done
at once to free them from the atmo-
sphere of neglect and unreality in which
they have moved hitherto. Resolved to
begin with the furniture, which, as the
Signora points out, is made for adults,
whereas it should all be adapted to the
needs of children, not only in size but
in weight.
September 11. -No carpenter being
procurable, Edwin spent a busy day in
sawing off the lower parts of the legs of
tables and chairs in the dining-room
and nursery to reduce them to the
Montessorian level. Edwin is full of
enthusiasm, but not being a handy man
he wounded himself badly in the calf
of his left leg.
Eva and Jack arrived from Cromer
in time for tea and were delighted with
the furniture. Instructed Nurse that
none of the children must be watched.
Nurse very sulky and seems quite un-
able to understand the value of the
ethical safeguard in allowing children
perfect liberty of self-expression. “If
I don't keep an eye on them,” she
said, “we may all be burned in our
beds.” I pointed out that there were:
no fires except in the kitchen, but she
remained unconvinced. After dinner
Jane, the new parlourmaid, gave notice,
| on the ground that it made her back
ache having to stoop to the level of a
table only a foot and a half from the
floor. Induced her to stay by raising
her wages one pound a week.
September 12.-Edwin's leg being
still painful, I undertook to expound the
doctrine of self determination to Jack
and Eva after breakfast. Explained to
them that the hooks in my wardrobe
had been placed within their reach, and
gave them the keys of the china cup-
board, the cellar and the pantry. Hav-
ing repeated my injunctions to Nurse
not to watch the children, I went off
to Caxton Hall to attend the monthly
meeting of the Parents' Neo-Paedolo-
gical Association. A most interesting
discussion on the best means of esta-
blishing a healthy metabolism by the
cultivation of the sensory energies
through rapid prehensile movements,
with due regard to an external norm.
Summoned home by an urgent message
from Edwin at 12.30 and found a crowd
outside the door. It appears that, all
the servants having gone out, Eva had
locked herself into the china cupboard
and Jack into the cellar. Edwin, though
disabled by his wound, had dressed and
fetched a locksmith. Pointed out to
him that to break open the doors would
be a fatal error. Force was no remedy
and it would deprive the children of
fully profiting by this opportunity of
learning the results of self-indulgence
and so acquiring a sense of dignity and
order. Edwin rather brutally replied,
“What about my old brandy?” and
ordered the locksmith to burst open the
cellar door.
4 P.M. The doctor has been and pro-
nounces Jack out of danger. It was
not old brandy, but port. Eva, on
being extricated from the ruins of the
china cupboard, said that she had been
playing “bull in the china shop,” thus
enjoying, as one of the speakers said
at our discussion, “the full aesthetic
delight of a spontaneous game,” which
is an invaluable means of realising the
will as a genetic factor in the growth
of personality. Edwin selfishly said
it was not worth the price; that his
Leeds set could not be replaced for
fifty pounds. Expostulated with Nurse
for leaving the house in my absence.
She retorted that if she was not to
watch the children she might just as
well go out. Jane, Gladys and Cook
have not returned. Ordered dinner
in from Garrods. Edwin still fretful,
but was partially reassured by my
pointing out that training by enforced
assent degenerates into discipline by
order. -
EveRY MAN His own wit:
OR, FIRST AID To DINElts-out.
It has been noticed by social ob-
servers that, whereas only a com-
paratively few men strive to be virtuous,
all would like to be funny, or at any rate
capable at any desired moment of re-
moving gravity. It is to meet this very
natural ambition that Mr. Punch offers
a few hints for diners-out during the
next few days, keeping to such topics as
are likely not to be obsolete.
We turn to the paper to make our
selections. Here, for example, is Lord
Fish ER. To be funny about Lord Fish ER
is not difficult. It would be sufficient
to memorise a few of his sentences, or
one might adopt his method with regard
to the day's experiences. Thus one's
partner at dinner often says genially,
“And what have you been doing all
day 2 " How simple to reply in pure
Fisherese ! “Wishing to get to the
City, and noting that all other men were
either in a bus, taxi or train, I brought
my wonderful brain to work and took
a scooter, and I tell you that in five
years' time there won't be a train, bus
or taxi left. We shall be on scooters;
and when the d–d fools ask you
who prophesied this, say, ‘Jacky did.
England's saviour, Jacky.’”
As a second example let us take the
case of the Oily Rectory. Here is excel-
lent material for the humourist, especi-
ally at dinner, where, food being now
and then on the rich side, openings will
be frequent. If you wish to be thought
merely facetious you can wonder how
soon we shall hear of a Vinegary Vicar-
age, and then by a natural transition,
keeping to alliteration (which is always
an ally of easy humour), pass on to
the Fatted Farmhouse, the Superſatted
Shanty, the Oleaginous Oasthouse, the
Messy Manor and the Greasy Grange.
If you desire a reputation for caus-
ticity or cynicism you can express the
belief that the Rector's sermons never
attracted so much attention as his walls
and ceilings have done. You can even
suggest that a certain unctuousness has
before now led to preferment, and specu-
late on the Rector's chances of some
day occupying a Bishop's Perspiring
Palace and pouring oil on the troubled
See.
Or you might combine the two sub-
jects. Now that the servant-girl has
withdrawn her alleged confession the
mystery of the Oily Rectory is still open.
Lord Fish ER is, we know from his own
testimony, capable de tout, and only in
last Friday's Times he calls himself an
“oil maniac.” Can there be a clue here?
With the foregoing assistance no
diner-out need be utterly without hon-
ours at whatever table he graces, pro-
vided that no other guest has also seen
this number of Punch. But, as that is
an incredible hypothesis, perhaps all our
toil has been in vain. - - -
The New Geometry. -
“The two sides of the Pilgrim's Progress:
the obviously moral and theological side which
was in the author's conscious intention, and
the story of strange adventure which he un-
consciously achieved, will not be found to be
divergent, but rather parallel ; and, like all
parallel straight lines, they will meet at last.”
Mr. A tºrtiºn: 114 city, in
“John o' London's Ileekinſ.”
“Now that Mesopotamia and Palestinie have
been released from Turkish misgovernment,
the exploration of ancient sites can be greatly
extended, and, remembering the precious yield
of the dust-heaps of Ornithorhynchus, we may
hope for many new and amazing revelations
of buried history, art, and literature.”

I wonDER how many holiday-makers, confronted in this

delightedly, “Just like JAcoBs.” The number of them
would be a measure of the welcome that will certainly
attend a new volume of Mr. W. W. JAcobs' short stories,
collected under the alluring title of Deep Waters (Hodder
AND STOUGHTON). Most of them have for protagonist that
deservedly popular character, The Night Watchman, whom
indeed you may observe in person on the wrapper: jersey,
generous trousers, conical hat and the whole familiar
outfit. I fancy there are few readers to whom the appeal
of this figure is likely to be made in vain. Perhaps, how-

make-believe. Still, in short, are they “just like JAcobs."
Higher praise you will scarcely want.
Miss MARY Johnston's latest novel, The Laird of Glen-
fernie (CoNSTABLE), might almost be said to have no heroine.
There does indeed exist a lady who at one time seems likely
to qualify for the post, but in a comparatively early chapter
she comes by her end, and is thenceforward only a memory
separating the two heroes. It is the relations of these,
their love, hatred and love again, that form the interest of the
tale. Its scene is the Highlands at the time of the march to
Derby, or, rather, this is the central incident of a story that
stretches before and after it; for the friendship of Ian Rul-
loch and Alexander, afterwards Laird of Glenfernie, began
when they were lads, and lasted (with an interruption) the
length of their lives. The interruption, of course, was Elspeth,
whom both, after their respective fashions, courted. It was
her death, as the victim of Ian, and (in a less degree) the fact
that the latter took Stuart service, while Glenfernie remained
staunchly Whig, which turned love to hate. Thence-
forward, almost to the end, the story treats of the vengeful
pursuit of Ian by his former friend. Into so many and
various scenes does this chase conduct the pair that I fear
it reminded me of nothing so much as the curate's version
of Valentine and Orson, fitted to lantern slides of a Voyage
Round the World ! Still, Miss Johnston has given us a
story both original and graceful. Her gift of phrase has
seldom shown to happier advantage. “So beautiful rang

the Spring that it was like a bell in the heart" is an
example at random. The gift is however one to exercise
with caution; to write, as she does on another page, of
“deep windows tying the interior to the yet rosy West,” is
to approach perilously near affectation.
Why the publisher of Deadham Hard (METHUEN) omits
from the list of LUCAs MALET's novels that particular one
—Damaris its title, if my memory serves—of which this is
a sequel, is beyond my comprehension, if not beyond my
powers of guessing. Damaris Verity, then a child of six,
now eighteen, Juno-eyed, steadfast mistress of her soul, the
“dear witch" of her lithe middle-aged Colonel Sahib Car-
teret, the darling of that distinguished pro-consul and his-
torian, Sir Charles Verity, her adored father, is the heroine-
goddess of this charming romance. Henrietta, the much-
married, again moves restless, and motivelessly intriguing,
through its pages. A noble-hearted bastard brother of
Damaris, knit with her in a bond of tenderly romantic
affection, is a new and entirely satisfactory creation.
LUcAs MALET’s hand has not lost much of its cunning,
though it be not the cunning of the modernist. Nor do her
remains in a sense incomplete its capable craftsmanship
and intensity of restrained feeling give it a place amongst
the most notable books in the library of the War.
I suppose Mr. STEPHEN McKENNA, when, in an epistle
dedicatory to Sonia Married (Hutchinson), he calls it a
footnote rather than a sequel, felt that he hadn't quite
succeeded in touching the level of Sonia and so essayed to
take the critic bull by the horns. I am rather inclined to
agree with him, but that doesn't mean that I didn't read
every word of his footnote with interest. O'Rane back from
the wars, blinded, teaching at his old school, keeping open-
house for the blind and halt and the down and ſout, is as
lovable, as unexpected, as ever. It is Sonia who goes to
pieces. I can see our author now at work on Sonia Returns
(and I wish him the best of luck), to rehabilitate that dear
girl in our good opinions. I don't believe she would have
betrayed her man, though I admit the provocation. O'Rane
wasn't easy to live with. Saints and heroes seldom are, I
am told by the wise. Sonia Married is Sonia marred,
perversely, painfully. I am sure Mr. McKENNA has been
let down by his three-decker plan. He must make speedy

era, but are restful paulo-post-
Mutiny Victorians, confident
Sahibs with no misgivings about

Let me tell you, Damaris is a

emancipated maidens will laugh
at her appalling innocence. In
some ways, my dears, she can
give you points, believe me.

A fairly extensive study of

has convinced me that fashion-

of woman that we do not fre-

She is ambitious and yet au fond

dry (and expensive) as Pommery

culating and yet impulsive and

Mr. WHITLock does not admire it at all, but reserves
all his appreciation for the unconquerable people who
furnished the raw material for that machine's 'industries.
His book details a persecution utterly beyond credence if
the thing had not actually happened. That the Germans
should daily shoot, with or without a travesty of trial,
numbers of peasants accused of “counting trains” or
similar feats of espial, may now seem natural enough, but
it is still hard to believe that they could, for example, in
perfect seriousness imprison all the scholars at a girls'
school for refusing to learn music from a Teuton professor,
or a Brussels pastor for reading from the Book of Psalms
passages in which KING DAVID had said pointed things
about his enemies. Other instances of the workings of
“German inentality,” from which one dare not quote here,
are so terrible in themselves and so poignantly set forth
that if you want to believe that all the past can be forgiven
and forgotten you had better not take up Mr. WHITLock's
work at all. The only relief from the gloom of these pages,
except indeed the altogether admirable English in which
they are written, is the account of the feeding by America
of those of our brave allies who would otherwise have been
left to starve. These two bulky volumes take us only as
far as the period of the deportations—quite bluntly called
slavery. . By that time America, as the writer had long
foreseen, had been drawn into the War, and so the rest of
the tragedy is not written here. But though his work
Stoughton), considerably fortifies me in this conviction.
Place her in an English atmosphere and she would have been
as nearly impossible as does not matter; but in her New
York environment she seems just right. She divorced her
first husband to marry a man whom she could really consider
a tower of strength, and I am left with the belief that a
man who is married on such grounds has a difficult rôle to
play. The characters are clearly drawn, in particular that
of Mrs. Farron's daughter, who had a little love affair of
her own; and the dialogue is clever without being un-
naturally brilliant. But I think that the book will be more
widely appreciated in “God's own Country” than in mine.
Reproduced literatim from a review:—
“Even regarding the cruel treatment of the Roman Catholics before
1778 and the odious penal laws, he exclaims: “Mon Dieu ! l'Irelande
n'avait pas le monople de ces griefs et deces persecutions. Il faut
juger les faits et les gens d'après l'age et le milieu ou on les trouve,
et au siecle de la guerre de Trente Ans, des Dragonnades de l'Edit de
Nantes, il me faut damner Anglais tout seul pour avoir riposté dure-
ment à tant de provocations.' But let us translate in order that no
reader may miss the point: “My God! l'Irelande n'avait pas the
monople of ces griefs and of ces persecutions. Il faut juger the faits
and the gens d'apres l'age and the milieu ou on the trouvex, and au
siecle do the guerre of Trente Aus, des Dragonnades of l'Edit of .

nuances of expression in a translation.”—Canadian Paper.

Ah, if to that ideal state
Some Prospero, brought up to date,
Might with his magic wand translate
Packed galleries and a full pit
Or could a LLoyd GEORGE get us there,
Liſting us lightly by the hair,
Wafted on streams of red-hot air
Blown from a City pulpit !
Not so the steeps of heaven are won
(He says himself it can't be done);
Many delights we first must shun
And buy the others cheaper;
The bottom dog must have fair play,
And no one be allowed to say,
As CAIN did in his casual way,
“Am I my brother's keeper?”
Thus only, brethren, may we sing
Millennium's reign with Love as King,
And toast the Day when we shall ring
The brotherhood of men in ;
And, for a start, to show how true
Our pledge to pull the weakest through,
We'll leave our Russian comrades to
O. S.
The bloody wolves of LENIN.
A RURAL TRANSFORMATION.
THE river, having apparently nothing
else to do, flowed smoothly and calmly
in its accustomed direction, oblivious
to the patient attention bestowed on it
by the two fishermen. At length fish-
erman Number One laid his rod on a
twig fork, wiped his brow and strolled
along the bank to the other man's pitch.
“What luck, George?” he asked.
“Same as yours, Bill, judging by
your looks,” replied George. “I’ve
tried 'em wi' maggots, wi' paste an' wi'
worms, an' they wain't do more 'n play
swingboats wi' 'em. Ye might jest as
well try fishin' for battleships in Scapa
Flow wi' a boathook.”
“Ay, there wain't be nowt doing till
we gets some rain an' a foot rise in th’
watter,” said Bill. “What d'ye say to
a snack o' summat to eat 2."
“That'll do me,” replied George, lay-
ing down his rod. “Let's go up to the
‘Cheval Blong' for an omelette an' a
verre de bière.”
“There’s some fowks,” said Bill sen-
tentiously, “as allus wants someone
standing by to tell 'em what's 'appened
to them. Th' War 's over, lad, an’ we
ain't in France now. If you like we'll
go to the ‘White Horse' an' hev some
bread-an'-cheese an' pickles.”
“Jest as you like,” replied George,
smiling tolerantly. “Carry on, corp'ril.”
They took the old path, “’crost Cos-
nop's medder, down past Thorpe's spin-
ney, an’ round be th' Pickerill” to the
spot where the ‘White Horse' used to
stand. The old steed was still there,
but groomed and caparisoned out of
knowledge. Little chairs and tables
were placed outside the doors, a coffee-
pot was steaming on a stove, fragile
glasses had replaced the pewter mugs,
and, instead of the buxom country
wench who used to serve the foaming
nut-brown, a gaily coiffured damsel in
high-heeled shoes and filmy stockings
came tripping out to take the order.
“Bong jour, Suzanne,” said George,
seating himself. “Deua bières an’some
aufs an' pommes-de-terre freet, an' allay
vite about it, 'cos we're très faim.”
“Bien, M'sieur,” said Suzanne, dis-
appearing into the interior.
Bill dropped ponderously into a chair
and gasped. “'Old my 'and an' fan me
a minute, George,” he said. “I don't
seem to 'ave got it rightly. 'Ave I bin
called up agen 2"
“There's some fowks,” retorted
George, “as don't know what's 'ap-
pened them till they're told. This is
the ‘White Horse' what was.”
“But where's Joe Ruggles, as used
to be landlord 'ere?”
“I reckon 'e's to market to-day,”
said George. “This is one of 'is ideas.
Joe, as you know, ain't so young as 'e
might be, but 'e jined up like the rest
on us and did 'is packet wi' the B.E.F.
Course, when 'e got back 'e expected to
find the boys coming up for a day's
fishing an' dropping in like they used
to. An' so they did; but somehows they
was allus grumbling. It was “Joe, th’
beer ain't what it used to be ; ye can't
get no forrarder on it,” or ‘Joe, 'ave you
bin robbing the mousetrap for the
cheese?' So at last 'e got rale vexed,
and 'e says, “Ye are all a lot o' pam-
pered grousers an’ ye don't deserve to
be quit o' the gentle chidings of a ser-
major. Th' beer's ten times as power-
ful as any you've scoffed this fower
years past, an' your quarter-bloke
niver giv' you cheese a patch on my |
Cheddar. But I'll fix ye,' 'e says. So
'e put up a stove wi' a coffee-pot on it
an' served eggs an' chips a la Flanders,
instead o' cheese an' pickles, an' watered
down the beer to half strength, an' now
all the boys jest flock in an' lap it up
like milk, same as they used to when
they was out at rest.” -
+
calls her, 'as something to do wi' the
boys' sudden liking for Pussyfoot beer.
I dunno wheer Joe found 'er, but I
wonder 'is missus stands 'aving 'er
about the place.”
“You niver 'ad an eye for beauty,
Bill,” replied George. “Now, I like
the French style—lots of joy-de-vee an'
sparkle an' chatter. Not that Suzanne
iver has much to say.”
“I mind the time,” said Bill reflec-
tively, “afore ye’d iver seen a furrin'
lass, 'cepting a Circassian beauty as
came round wakes week, when you said
there warn’t no lasses in th' wide wide
world as 'ud compare wi' our rosy-
cheeked English 'uns.”
“Travel's enlarged my mind, lad, as
it would 'ave enlarged yours if it 'ad
anything to work on at all. Jest look
at that girl now, tripping along like a
black-eyed gazelle. Th' wench as Joe
'ad afore th' War used to waddle in
like a tank.”
Suzanne had brought in a tray with
plates and glasses. She must have
heard and understood the remark, for
a faint flush glowed on her cheek.
“Stuff to give 'em ” continued
George, smacking his lips. “Vous étes
some peach, Suzanne.”
“Cut it out,” said the girl shortly.
George's jaw dropped in amazement.
Bill peered up into the girl's face and
then leaned back and roared with
laughter.
“Dang me!” he said, choking with
mirth, “I’ve been 'ere this 'alf-hour an'
niver rumbled it. You're Susie Mar-
son, as used to be waitress here five
years ago!”
“Course I am l’” said Susie. “I
remember you both when you used to
come in with hay in your hair and
make noises like turnips.”
“It was the French lingo misled me,
Susie,” chuckled Bill. “Where did ye
larn it 2."
“Picked it up at Rouen when I was
| *
out there with the W.A.A.C.'s,” said
Susie. “You aren't the only people
who went to France. And when I
came back and found that Mr. Ruggles
had turned the ‘White Horse' into an
estaminet we thought it would be in
keeping if I pretended to be French
too. But when an overfed base-wallah
says English girls waddle like tanks I
have to speak out !”
George, with his head down in his
plate, finished his eggs and chips with
a tremendous gulp.
“Reckon I'll be going to see 'ow the
fish is biting,” he said, and departed
hurriedly. -

THE RATE OF EXCEIANGE.
THE world is a small place after all,
and I am not straining the limits of
truth when I say that the prosperity
of France has a direct and almost im-
mediate bearing on my own private
affairs. It is, of course, a matter of
finance, and finance implies a Scotsman.
Lieutenant McMustard is featured as
the villain of the piece, and the dénoue-
ment is timed to occur six months after
the signing of peace.
I was once P.M.C. of the Battalion
Mess. I speak of the times of the
Great War, which you may remember
took place between 1914 and 1918 A.D.
Among the many hardships of its try-
ing campaigns were the circumstances
attending the arrival one day at our
dugout in Dickebusch of a case of
whisky from England. There was little
need, as far as we were affected, for the
label, “Glass with care." On opening
the crate eleven-twelfths was found to
come strictly under this heading; only
one bottle had survived its journey.
As this is a financial narrative I will
pass over the literary efforts this cata-
strophe produced in the Mess. My
chief concern was to debit each member
with eight shillings, his share of the
loss. McMustard now appears as the
chief dramatis persona.
His reasons for not paying the eight
shillings were tabulated under four
heads: (a) The loss was not due to
any act or negligence of his; (b) no
effort had apparently been made to
trace the person or persons responsible
for the damage; (c) no court of inquiry
had been held, vide K.R.; (d) he had
not consumed any of the liquor for
which he had been asked to pay. The
consensus of opinion being against his
attitude, the sum of eight shillings was
officially demanded from him. Six
months later, on the Arras front, he
sent me eight francs by orderly, with
a request for receipt.
I returned the eight francs and
pointed out in a polite note that, as
the franc was only worth eightpence-
halfpenny, I should be pleased to re-
ceive 11.30 francs in settlement of the
debt of eight shillings. This provoked
a statement from McMustard to the
effect that at the time the alleged debt
(note the caution of the Scot) was in-
curred the franc was worth ninepence
three-farthings, therefore, on hearing
from me, he would forward 9.85 francs
in settlement. Argument as to who
should bear the loss due to fluctuation
in the rate of exchange was cut short
by McMustard's going to England for
a course of instruction.
Having rejoined us at Dixmude he
seemed willing, when approached on
the matter, to wipe off the debt, his
idea being apparently that 9.85 francs
(Belgian) was worth at that time only
about five shillings and tenpence. How-
ever he did not function in the matter,
for the War was just then brighten-
ing up and attracting quite a lot of
attention. -
We met again at Cologne, in the
Army of Occupation, and with true
British doggedness I again prepared to
attack. McMustard received my de-
mand for thirteen marks seventy pfen-
nigs for one bottle of whisky, value
eight shillings, the mark being cal-
culated at sevenpence according to
G.R.O. displayed in the sanctum of the
Field Cashier. The War having fizzled
out, I followed up my request by going
to see McMustard. He produced a
Whitaker three years old to prove that
at the time the debt was incurred the
mark was worth nearly tenpence. He
therefore offered ten marks in payment
of the sum demanded, produced a
twenty-mark note and waited for the
change.
As I searched my pockets I remem-
bered that the rate of exchange was
by amended G.R.O. now quoted at ten
marks (the change that he wanted) for
two shillings and tenpence. The only
money I could produce was a five-franc

note I had treasured since leaving
Poperinghe a couple of years ago. Five ||
francs at sevenpence each (present
worth) being the equivalent of ten || ||
marks at threepence-half-penny each,
I explained that the five-franc note
would be adequate change from his
twenty-mark note. Half-an-hour's de-
monstration on the backs of various
envelopes seemed to convince McMus- ||
tard that he was not being cheated.
Thus after many weary years the debt
was liquidated to the satisfaction of all
parties concerned, and McMustard and
I went off to live happy ever after.
I do not suppose that he was any
quicker than I in discovering a little|
postscript in obscure French on the
back of the five-franc note, to the effect
that it was only “payable at the Bank
of Roubaix six months after the conclu-
sion of hostilities.” Therefore during
the last days of December Ishall watch
the French money market with a sneak-
ing hope that, as a temporary develop-
ment only, the financial credit of our
gallant Ally will fall still further, to
the confusion of a certain calculating
Scot.
TEIE MAN TRAP.
I was mowing my lawn when Dobson
appeared at the garden gate. Dobson
is my ex-special-police partner—a most
active officer. It was always his ambi-
tion to catch a burly armed burglar at
work. Now it was my ambition that
the terror of our reputation should keep
all dangerous criminals from our beat.
I really think that Dobson hoped the
burglar would shoot me and that he
would be complimented at the inquest
on the magnificent way in which he
avenged his trusty comrade. Happily
Dobson never had the chance to get an
Albert Medal at my expense.
“Hello,” I said. “Bring your bike
in. There's been quite a number stolen
lately.”
“I’m leaving it outside,” returned
Dobson. “That bike is a trap. Any-
one trying to ride that will be thrown
violently from it directly the machine
gets any speed on. I have fitted an
ingenious attachment. I am going to
leave it here and wait. Pity the regular
police don't think out more artful ways
of dealing with criminals.”
He strolled into my garden. “Dear
me, cutting your grass. You haven't
what I call a straight eye. Let me
show you how to mow a lawn properly.”
I am a philosophic gardener. If any
one wants to show me how to garden
he is welcome. I don't know how
many times my brother-in-law, who is
one of those fussy instructive people,
has clipped my hedges for me.
So I let Dobson grip the mower and

run it up and down whilst I sank into

“What a straight eye, you have ' " and
other encouraging remarks.
I was prepared to sit complimenting
all the evening whilst Dobson kept on
mowing. All at once I heard a shout
in the road and looked round just in
time to see a large policeman jump on
Dobson's bike and ride off.
“Stop at once ' " I shouted.
“After cycle thief!” shouted the
policeman as he pedalled away.
The next moment there came a tre-
mendous thud as fourteen stone of
policeman hit the macadam.

When he regained his breath he
gasped, “Saw a man jump on a lady's

hadn't jammed. He'll be half a mile
off now, I suppose. Well, I'd best be

I said. “It will be his daughter's

ANOTHER RECTORY MYSTERY.
Much Rotham, Essex.
DEAR SIR,--I am encouraged to hope
that a brief account, taken from my
diary, of the amazing phenomena that
have lately focussed upon my quiet
rectory the regard of the civilized world,
may not be without interest. I should
premise that my household consists of
myself, a bachelor of sixty-five, and
two domestics, cook and parlourmaid,
of whom the precise ages have proved
unascertainable, though both are palp-
ably advanced in years. I had also at
the time a young nephew, Tom (four-
teen), spending a part of his summer
holidays as my guest. The entries will
now, I trust, explain themselves.
August 31st.—Tom arrived safely,
looking cheerful. Trust he will not
find our quiet routine too dull. Later.
An amazing incident has occurred which
I must put down while still fresh in my
memory. Sent Tom to bed at 9.30 P.M.
Servants retired at 10. I myself went
upstairs precisely at 10.14. Finding
bedroom door slightly ajar, gave it a
brisk push, when, without warning,
received on my head bath sponge satur-
ated with cold water, causing me to
overbalance myself. How it can have
been discharged remains inexplicable,
as the room was entirely empty. The
only intimation of any supernatural
agency was that afterwards I seemed
to remember sounds as of suppressed
laughter, coinciding with my fall. I
may add that, when sufficiently re-
covered to summon assistance, I found
that neither of the maids (both slightly
deaf) had heard anything unusual;
while my young visitor had fallen into
so profound a slumber that he was
only with much difficulty awakened.
Whole affair a disquieting mystery.
September 1st-3rd.—Nothing unusual
observed, despite the incessant watch-
fulness of Tom, whose untiring activity
is beyond praise. He suggests removal
of study floor with a view to possible
skeletons. Proposal declined. Wrote
letter to The Great Slocombe Gazette,
giving full details of the manifestation.
September 4th. — Cook, washing
lettuces for supper, terrified by de-
moniac howls proceeding from outside
garden. Found her in violent hysterics.
Tom, returning from bicycle-ride in
state of considerable emotion, reports
encounter with unearthly presence in
Rectory Lane. Parlourmaid faints
twice. Addressed supplementary letter
to Slocombe Gazette.
September 6th-All quiet. Letters
published. Effect, despite misprints,
pleasing.
September 7th. — Unexpected but
gratifying visit from representative of
The Daily Smudge, who very courte-
ously asked permission to photograph
house and inmates. Accorded willingly.
September 8th. — Place obviously
haunted. When about to seat myself
at study desk, chair suddenly and vio-
lently jerked towards adjacent French
window, which was partially open.
Sustained further contusions and re-
newed shock. Becoming seriously
alarmed. What is it 2

that is. Interesting. Tom inclined to
discredit theory in favour of corpse

ist, who most kindly offers to subject
rectory and grounds to expert examina-
tion. Accepted with thanks. Also

and advises immediate evacuation of
house as unsafe. Received circulars
from five press-cutting agencies, en-
closing articles from Times, News, Post,

heavy rain. Tom most helpful in con-
veying furniture on to lawn to await
vans. Special excursion from town
brought large crowd, who survey pro-
ceedings over garden hedge, with inter-
ested comments. Penalty of publicity.
Further cuttings; also congratulatory
wire from Sir Watson Sherlock. In
afternoon depressed. Furniture greatly
damaged. Hear question asked at
Labour Congress, denouncing me for
inadequate compensation to Cook.
Started album of press-extracts.
September 13th.-Slept (?) at village
inn. Severe cold. Tom, who heroically
elected to spend night in deserted
rectory, reports further alarming ex-
periences, culminating in apparition of
spectre with chains and shroud. Nerves
seriously shaken. Two more special
trains and quantity of motors, most of
whose occupants put up for lunch at
inn. Landlord exceedingly kind and
sympathetic. Later. Unexpected ar-
rival of my brother George, who, on
being informed of position, declares his
intention of visiting rectory with Tom
and making thorough investigation.
Declines further weapon than stout
ash cane. Tom, for first time, displays
reluctance, but is persuaded. In their
absence continued album. Articles in
Outlook, Spectator, Athenaeum (humor-
ous) and Bee-keeper.
September 14th. —Brother George
and Tom both left by train last evening,
latter somewhat flushed and taciturn.
George assures me that ghost has been
“well laid.” Sincerely trust so; but
explanation as far off as ever. Secured

ing, experience (query, privilege 2).

DEAR SIR, - We are exceedingly
pleased to learn that our course has
done you so much good. We would
suggest that you firmly but respectfully
demand an interview with your em-
ployer. In order to give you the neces-
sary confidence may we suggest the
purchase of one of our vibro-electric
breastplates? Tens of thousands of
our students have found benefit from
these breastplates when undergoing in-
terviews with their employers. With
one of them concealed beneath your

take its place. That marvellous fluid
electricity, which is the basis of all life,
| will flow from the breastplate into all
parts of the body, giving hope, strength
and determination. Experience has
shown that only five per cent. of em-
ployers are able to resist its subtle
force. The breastplate, battery and elec.
trodes, securely packed and delivered

We are, Yours obediently, etc.
“The Dovecote,” Balham,
25th August, 1919.
GENTLEMEN,+I have interviewed my
employer; and with what result 2 That
delicate sympathy heretofore existing
between us, fragile thing that it was,
is broken for ever; in other words I am
sacked. I knocked at the door of his
room yesterday immediately after he
had returned from lunch. The time
chosen shows, I think, that I am versed
in human nature. Nevertheless his re-
ception of me lacked cordiality. For
assistance during this momentous crisis
I relied chiefly upon Rules 78-92 of the
advanced course, viz., those which lay
it down that by an effort of will and
imagination a person may fancy that
he is the sun–" the great orb of day."
(SHAKSPEARE)—and that, like the sun,
he is shooting out beams of light and
heat and force in all directions.
I had brought myself into the correct
imaginative state before entering the
room, and I immediately shot twenty
or thirty beams at my employer's head,
neck and shoulders. I am not aware
that I concentrated unduly on a large
mole which adorns the side of his nose,
though I noticed that this corrugated
excrescence became alternatively red
and blue with great rapidity. It was
impolite in him therefore to demand
brusquely what the Hades I was star-
ing at.
I may as well confess that this unex-
pected remark somewhat unsettled me,
and I closed one eye for a few seconds
(see Rule 138) in order to reassemble
my subconscious and esoteric forces,
with a view to his complete subjugation.
It was at the end of this brief period,
during which my employer wore a sin-
ister expression, that misfortune over-
whelmed nie. As you are aware I had
assumed your B 11 electric breastplate.
Now I have, in the course of several
rehearsals, endeavoured by means of
this breastplate to bathe my being in
the great life-giving fluid, but had never
felt the smallest sensation therefrom.
Yet at this moment, standing as I was
before my employer, with closed eyes
and surging soul, the breastplate began
suddenly to subject me to a series of |
the most alarming shocks. Spasmodic
pains of an intensive character shot
downwards through my legs and up-
wards into my head, causing my hair
to stiffen and the ends of my mous-
tache (which is of a sandy colour) to
move backwards and forwards and even
gyrate convulsively.
My employer, with a startled look,
sprang from his seat, seized a heavy
coal-shovel from the fireplace and
pressed an electric-bell. Before I could
open my mouth the commissionaire en-
tered the room and at a word I was
hustled back into the general office.
This morning I have received a letter
dispensing with my services and sug-
gesting that I should become a Pussy-
foot (whatever they may be).
I have set out the facts fully, Gentle-
men, in order that you may be in a
position to advise me. Yours, etc.
George Washington House,
1st September, 1919.
DEAR SIR,-We have read your letter
with great interest. It is clear to us
that your employer was incensed about
something, and we have come to the
conclusion that it was the convulsive
movements of your moustachios. (N.B.
A sandy moustache moving in the way
you describe might easily irritate the
nerves.) May we suggest that you
should purchase a bottle of our elixir
for the removal of superfluous hair,
and, after treatment, again seek an
interview with your employer? Being
an old customer, we could let you have

“The eyebrows, or that ſunny way
Of turning in her toes;”
All over your unhappy frame
Resemblances themselves proclaim,
But none suggest, for very shame,
That you have got my nose.
This is the nose that, age by age,
Adorns our ancient line;
Full many a Prelate, Prince and Sage
In carven stone recline—
All, all distinguished more or less
By this peculiar nosiness,
Though few of theirs, I must confess,
Were quite as large as mine.
Men gaze at it when one goes by
As at a monstrous freak,
Which—one can see it in their eye—
They simply long to tweak;
Nor is it nothing that one has
At many a rude unmannered Jazz
Been mentioned generally as
“The fellow with the beak.”
But, though with filial pride I wear
This relic of the past,
Your nose, I trust, is not the heir
Of the ancestral cast;
For men are foolishly inclined
To noses of a different kind,
Less angular, if less refined,
And just a shade less vast.
Your mother's, now, is straight and
small,
The sort young men prefer,
Though she is not what I should call
A perfect character;
So, if you hope to be a bride,
I offer you this simple guide—
Just be a bit like me (inside),
But look a lot like her. A. P. H.

[According to a weekly paper, the first known medical prescription
is for an antidote to baldness, made up for an Egyptian queen.]
I MAKE no moan, although beneath the bay leaves
My locks are not so flowing as of yore;
Wholly unmoved, I note how every day leaves
The parting broader than it was before;
Tears, idle tears by me are not expended,
Still can I face my mirror undismayed
To find my daily hair-drill is attended
By such a small parade.
Each time I shake the bottle (large dimension,
Three times as big as those at one-and-one),
I tell myself I do with like intention
What haply many a famous name has done,
Since first that luckless better-half of PtoleMY
Begged her physician for a dope to stop
The rot that won her spouse's comment, “Golly, my
Dear, you are thin on top.”
So suffered, maybe, CAESAR, et tu, BRUTE,
Possibly NERo had not much to cut,
And, Senlac won, some page did extra duty
Applying massage to the CoNQUEROR's nut;
Some frugal-minded Borgia, too, diurnally
May have employed for simple toilet ends
Such poison as he'd not applied internally
To inconvenient friends.
On such as these my frequent fancy lingers,
Snatching a solace from the thought that they
I(neaded their naked scalps with anxious fingers
Or ever I'd begun my little day;
Yes, when myºskull in turn tells how fugaces

'Tis nice to feel that what is taking place is
An immemorial moult.
Quartermasters as Mascots.
Order recently received by a corps in Flanders:—
“With reference to your No. dated —, 1919, will you
please note that no Quartermaster should be demobilized without
the sanction of these Headquarters being obtained, in accordance with
G.R. O. 6475. (sd.) —, Capt. S.C.,
for Major, D.A.M.S.”
G.R.O. 6475, on being looked up, was found to be:—
“Regimental Mascots and Pets.-Licences to land these animals
may be granted if application is made to the Board of Agriculture
three weeks before it is desired to ship the animals, and provided the
Mascots are to remain under military care. There is no bar to the
importation of animals of the monkey tribe.
(Authority : W.O.L. No. 9/9/2200, dated 5-3-19.)”
The Quartermaster thereupon claimed on official authority
that he was popular enough to be a regimental pet, but the
Junior Sub. explained that his case was covered by the last
sentence of G.R.O. 6475.

THE DIARY OF A MONTESSORIAN.
II.
September 12.—A somewhat troubled
night, Nurse having refused to accept
any responsibility for Jack, on the
ground that I had told her the children
must not be watched. Slept in the
nursery in an armchair. Jack very
feverish. Iºdwin recommended milk
and soda-water, but, as Jack did not
ask for it, I could not force it upon him.
As I reminded Edwin, NIETzsche has
rightly said that life is an experience,
not a duty. ARISTOTLE tells us that
children live by instinct, and Dr. ALEx-
ANDER MoRGAN, the distinguished Scot-
tish educationist, writes that “children
must be allowed to examine and experi-
ment for themselves. Only thus will
they grow up to be active and self-
reliant citizens.”
At 8 A.M., hearing a loud knocking,
I went down and let in Cook, Gladys
and Jane. They explained their ab-
sence on the ground of terror at the
behaviour of the children. Pointed
out to them that, while State morality
must be based on free choice, the free
individual must disdain intimidation as
well as coercion. Cook and Gladys im-
mediately demanded the same rise in
wages which I had promised to Jane.
Breakfast rather sketchy, and Edwin
peevish about the limpness of the
sausages. Said he was going to write
an article on the limits of self-expres-
sion in cooks. I replied, in the words
of HAROLD BEGBIE, that “to gain the
affections of democracy for a crusade
having a Moral State as its end, we
must prove to it that this Moral State
would be worth living in. We must
prove that a Moral State would provide
men with the opportunity of living
richly and deeply, not niggardly and
fearfully.” Edwin retorted that our
experiment was a double failure, since
he was not living richly and the servants
were in a blue funk. I replied again,
in the noble words of Mr. BEGBIE, that
“morality should never stand in the
shadow of the policeman,” on which
Edwin, I regret to say, promptly ob-
served, with a sad lack of taste and
uplift: “Quite true; but what would
Cook say to that ?”
Jack being still rather piano, further
experiments with him seem out of the
question to-day. Edwin insisted that
no more keys should be entrusted to
the children; that experiment must be
regarded as complete. By way of com-
promise I obtained his consent to
allowing Eva the right of free election
of amusements until the return of her
governess, Miss Grindle. I made a
further concession by agreeing that
2va should be under supervision, not
vexatious but helpful. The true teacher,
as Dr. ALEXANDER MoRGAN puts it, “will
watch the children in order to study
their capacities and needs,” but not
to interfere with their legitimate self-
activity.
As Edwin's leg still prevented his
going to the Ministry of Supererogation
I arranged that he should remain at
home and invigilate on non-interven-
tional lines, as I was obliged to attend
my bi-weekly lesson in Eurhythmics at
Madame Swetchine's studio at Bron-
desbury before lunching at the Smiles
Self-Help Restaurant with the Neo-
Hellenic Hygienic Coterie. Madame
Swetchine very illuminative, especially
in her insistence on non-injunctional
instruction as a means of developing
the artistic consciousness. A charming
lunch—curried peaches and maté—and
a most stimulating discussion on growth
as a mathematical function of feeding.
Home to tea. Jack much better but
inclined to sleep. Edwin still tiresome.
He had taken Eva in a taxi to Ken-
sington Gardens, where she had elected
to paddle in the Round Pond and, get-
ting out of her depth, had been roughly
pulled out by the park-keeper, whom

she had bitten in the hand. Edwin
had offered the man ten shillings, but
he refused and had taken Edwin's name

not changed her clothes and showed
signs of catching cold, to go to bed with
a supply of chocolates, while I wrote to
The Times to protest against the bru-
tality of State Mamelukes.
ANOTHER IMPENDING STRIKE.
THE feeling of unrest so prevalent in
the commercial world has at length
spread to literary circles, and threatens
to result in a strike of poets, as a pro-
test against the refusal of the Editors'
Defence Association to concede the
demands formulated by the Minor Poets'
Mutual Protection Society. The grav-
ity of the situation cannot be exag-
gerated, and, unless immediate steps
are taken by the Government to settle
the dispute, the nation may at any
moment be compelled to suffer the
incalculable loss and inconvenience
entailed by the complete stoppage of
its poetical supplies.
The origin of the dispute is well-
known. An industrious but undis-
tinguished member of the Minor Poets'
Mutual Protection Society submitted
to the editor of The Bookmaker a poem
entitled “Loves of the Lepidoptera.”
So impressed was the editor in question
by the merit of this tour de force that
by return of post an offer of three shil-
lings and ninepence was received by
the author and, on the advice of a
rapacious landlady, accepted.
The editor of The Bookmaker then
sold the colonial, dramatic, serial, mus-
ical, cinematograph, and all other
rights for a sum of eighteen shillings
and sixpence—thus realising a profit
of nearly four hundred per cent.—and
published the poem anonymously. The
incensed author reported this shame-
less piece of profiteering to the Minor
Poets' Mutual Protection Society. The
Committee of the Society immediately
seized the opportunity to demand sub-
stantial increases in the rate of payment
for poets; a peace bonus to compensate
for the inflated rents of attics; double
rates of pay for night-work, the neces-
sary midnight oil to be provided;
prompt payment on acceptance—re-
tention of MSS. longer than six hours
to be equivalent to acceptance; with-
drawal of the demand for stamped and
addressed envelopes; and special terms
for Odes, Epics, Patriotic Poems and
Obituary Notices.
In presenting these terms to the
Editors' Defence Association the So-
ciety intimated that, unless they were
accepted within forty-eight hours, strike
notices would be posted and minor
poets throughout the country would
“down" pens.
This uncompromising attitude was
endorsed by a mass meeting held on
Monday evening at the Poets' Corner,
and attended by thousands of poets
past, present and futurist. The serious.
ness of the situation is accentuated by
the fact that all living poets of British
nationality are, or should be, members
of the Minor Poets' Mutual Protection
Society.
A few characteristic comments on the
crisis are recorded below:—
Dr. Robert BRIDGEs, Poet-Laureate,
expressed intense distaste for any kind
of public utterance, but was overheard
to murmur sotto voce :—
“Whether I'm paid in cash or sack
Or plum-and-apple jam,
The outlook is extremely black,
But I don't care a button.”
Mrs. ELLA WHEELER WILCox, a copy
of whose works is in all completely fur-
nished British homes, expressed inter-
national sympathy and asserted her
willingness to die in the last distich for
the cause. She concluded as follows:–
“Though ever since I did begin
To write I’ve raked the dollars in,
I shall not chafe at changes made
So long as I am better paid.”

AT THE PLAY.
“THE GREAT DAY.” "
DRURY LANE Autumn melodramas
should be very entertaining to write, or
rather to construct; and the Big Three
of what might be called PARKER's Piece
Conference—I refer respectfully to Mr.
Louis NAPolfoN PARKER, Mr. GEORGE
R. SIMs and Mr. ARTHUR Collins—must
have enjoyed their work on this new
one, The Great Day, almost as much as
the audience enjoys the results. For so
many stimulating things have to be
done: virtue has to be rewarded, and
in the process of bringing this about
the moralist cannot but glow; villainy
has to be frustrated and punished (re-
newed glow); recent history, social and
political, has to be searched and se-
lected from (surely a piquant task);
jokes have to be made; crises of emo-
tional excitement have to be arranged;
and sensational settings decided upon
for which every likely and unlikely re-
source of scene-painting, carpentry and
lighting is at their disposal. All this
must be very stimulating employment
—to say nothing of monetary reward
to follow.
But of the three I personally most
envy Mr. Collins, for, whatever the
anxieties incidental to such labours, it
must be enormous fun to set out to
achieve the impossible, as he has done,
and to win; to bring, for example, the
river Seine in full flood to the boards
of Drury Lane. This is by far the most
remarkable stage spectacle I have ever
seen, and its impressiveness is increased
rather than impaired by the forewarn-
ing of the authors, who in their stern
logic provide, in the previous scene, the
real thunderstorm (so real as to splash
Mr. GLovER and his merry fiddlers)
which causes the river to burst its
banks. Nor do we think less of this
cataclysm because the sole purpose of
unloosing it was to drown Mr. GERALD
LAWRENCE. Nobody else. That so vast
an inundation should be brought about
to satisfy poetical justice in the matter
of one malefactor is surely magnificent;
particularly as there is (to all appear-
ances—such is Mr. Collins's skill) a
sufficient torrent to purge London of
half its detrimental population.
What fun, again, to bring a slice of |
Sheffield to Drury Lane, so that Mr.
STANLEY LOGAN, whom playgoers have
been thinking of for a long while purely
as a debonair Lothario with a leaning
towards manicure, may evolve into an
inventor in overalls with so perilous a
secret that only his own hands can
wield the hammer that releases a molten
stream of the specially toughened metal
which alone can win the war !
But scenery is not all, and it would
be unfair to Mr. PARKER and Mr. SIMs
to lay too much stress upon it, for their
story has its own momentum and is
told with admirable spirit, and now
and then with finer shades of character-
isation than these vast productions

ence") is discernible in a voice of
beautiful mellowness and clarity, and in
the unhurried grace of her movements,
which, with her unaffected sincerity,
endear her to the house; and the
authors, recognising this classic quality,
have provided a little Shakspearean
echo, in her analysis of the perfect
husband in Act I., which for a moment
agreeably emphasises it.
Mr.STANLEY LOGAN, drawn from light
comedy to play a Bayard in adversity
whom a Samaritanese impulse has in-
volved in bigamy, acts so well that
he compels sympathy. The part is
both long and difficult, but he carries
it through with distinction, not unas-
sisted by an excellent ally in the person
of a good and versatile tailor. Mr.
FREDERICK Ross as the steel-manu-
facturer is finely vigorous and resonant,
and, though some days have passed,
his defiant tones still ring in my head.
Mr. GERALD LAwrENCE as a Ruthenian
violinist (and, we all suspected, certainly
a cousin, if not a nearer relation, of
Svengali), discourses sweet music and
insidious subtle wickedness with equal
skill and earns his meed of hate (with
groans and hisses). The part is the
most theatrical of all, but also the most
picturesque, and Mr. LAwRENCE serves
the authors well. Mr. AUBREY FITz-
GERALD does all that is possible as a
lovesick boy in shackles of devotion to
a Kitty (Miss DoRo THY TETLEy) who is
winsome enough to make every man
wish his place; but he has not been too
generously supplied with opportuni-
ties. Lastly, among the principals, we
come to Mr. HUGH C. BUCKLER, whose
impersonation of a soldier broken by a
German prison is painfully convincing.
As an illustration of the richness of
the cast, I may say that, although
that unctuous comedian, Miss MARY
BRough, is among its forty and odd
names, she certainly has not more than
six sentences to speak. Another minor
part that stands forth is that of the
manager of the works, whom Mr. CLIF-
FoRD SPURR makes a very real figure.
There are also a score or so of anony-
mous performers—they are grouped
under “etc.”—that I fancy I have seen ||
before on the same historic boards.
Everything else is lavishly new ; but
the rats that scamper across the stage
in the Paris scene—did I or did I not
recognise them as survivors from Dick
Whittington's cat? It was too dark for
certainty. W.

quiet humour of Mr. A. A. MILNE's
little sketch. But the adaptability of
a Coliseum audience is very catholic, and
the typically unassertive qualities of The
Camberley Triangle (which, it is right
to warn you, had nothing to do with
the Staff College) were not wasted upon
them. It offered a new and very fresh
variation on the return of a husband
(hasty war-wedding, followed by four
years on an Eastern front without leave)
to find his wife in train to elope with
Another. Dispensing with all the more
vulgar developments he proposes a com-
petition with his rival, each to have five
minutes by himself with the lady for the
exercise of his conversational charms.
The tertium quid, being allowed first
turn, urges her, with a peevish violence
that has no persuasion in it, to get on
her hat and cloak and be off with him
before his time is up. He is clearly no
gentleman and thoroughly deserves to
lose. The husband (an obvious con-
queror from the moment of his appear-
ance) refuses to press his claims, dis-
misses the vision that he has cherished
in solitude all these years, and starts
on a virgin quest to win his wife's affec-
tions all over again. He attains with
a minute or so in hand.
Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE played the win-
ning part with a most comfortable
assurance, but was not very well sup-
ported (if that is the right word) by his
rival, who made it rather hard for us
to visualise the fascination which he
seems to have exerted over the wife
before the curtain went up. This in
turn threw a painful doubt upon her
sense of values and made us wonder
whether the victor's prize was quite as
good a thing as he thought it.

a furnished flat to let, so I rushed to
the nearest telephone office and tried
to get through to him. After running
through most of the combinations,
Exchange hit the key number and the
Agent spoke. “Come at once,” he
said, “and come in disguise, or you will
probably be mobbed. Dress up, if you
can, as a plumber.”
I bought a basket of plums, put on
my oldest suit and boarded a motor-bus
that appeared from its placard to have
its heart set on the hills. After an
hour's climb I got off and continued
the ascent on foot. A large and fero-
cious-looking crowd of men and women
were beleaguering the door of the
Agent's office. I beckoned to a small
boy, offered him sixpence and told him
to climb over the back garden wall and
deliver a message. “Tell Mr. Wil-
liams,” I said, “that one waits without
who wishes to have a word with him.
Can you repeat that?”
I was glad that I had put him to this
test, as it appeared that he pronounced
all his w's as v's, and I therefore on-
gaged another.
He reappeared in twenty minutes
with an order to view No. 369, Senna-
cherib Mansions.
I scaled some more peaks and found
at last a peculiar-shaped cromlech on
the left-hand side of the mountain-
top. By an extraordinary coincidence
a precisely similar excrescence entitled
Nebuchadnezzar Mansions had reared
itself on the right-hand side. I did not
honestly admire the architectural style
of the buildings. It was doubtful indeed
whether it could be called a style at all.
In front of each block there ran a long
row of part-worn evergreen shrubs. I
ran after them until I reached the thirty-
sixth entrance and climbed five flights
of stairs. I rang the bell, and when
the door opened put my foot in it.
“I have come to see your flat,” I
shouted, working my way in and waving
the order to view in the tenant's face.”
“Certainly,” he said as we crouched
together in the entrance-shaft. “I ex-
pect you would like to see the reception
cupboards first.”
“I want to see the one you dine in,”
I said. “I have rather a long swing
with my spoon.” He showed me a
small alcove, in which one had to adopt
a sitting attitude in order to get one's
knees under the edge of the table and
so dodge the door, which opened in-
wards. The drawing recess had two
of those large circular tuffet-shaped
cushions in it, and seemed over-fur-
nished when we had both got inside.
“I expect you don't have very large
house parties, do you?'' I asked.
He confessed that he did not, and
took me on to see the bedrooms. He
explained rather apologetically that the
flat had not been designed for a very
long man, but that, by knocking a
square hole in the plaster and fitting
a wooden box in it, he was enabled to
lie down. This was really an advan-
tage, since the box could be reversed
during the daytime, thus adding con-
siderably to the size of the drawing-
room next door.
“I will now let you see the bath-
room,” he went on. “It has a geyser.”
“I have an order to geyse,” I re-
minded him proudly, and we peeped in
together. The bath had beerſ built for
depth rather than for length, and when
you used it, he explained, you took up
the “knees bend" position and dodged
the spout of the geyser. The whole
flat indeed was admirably adapted for
the practice of P.T. exercises, with the
exception of the “arms upward stretch”
movement, which gave one a nasty rap
across the knuckles when one hit the
ceiling. I examined a few cracks in
the walls and some damp patches where
the rain was coming through, left my
basket of plums to refresh the tenant and
went back to the House Agent's office.
“Are there really many people who
want that flat 2 " I asked him, when
I had worked my way through the
scrimmage.
“Most certainly,” he replied, waving
his hand towards the heated throng.
“In spite of the price?”
“A mere nothing.”
“And the size of the thing?”
“Oh, you'll soon get used to that,”
he said cheerfully. “Are you going to
take it or not 2."
“No, I won't take it, Williams,” I
answered, backing towards the door.
“Have it sent round to my rooms for
me, will you—with a couple of lettuces?”
And I scrambled down the slope and
returned to London. EvoB.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN the pleasant parts of a novel are so attractively
pictured that you find yourself indulging an active and
personal regret for the glooms that must overshadow it,
I conceive the author already to have scored a notable suc-
cess. This certainly was my own feeling at the end of
chapter seven of A Man and his Lesson (HUTCHINsoN), when
Mr. W. B. MAxwell had been telling, in his best manner,
about the jolly Sunday parties given by Bryan Waile,
successful dramatist and husband, at his happy home in
Regent's Park. I almost detested the uninvited arrival of
the dazzling Duchess of Middlesborough, between whom and
Bryan there had once been a romance, which, from selfish
caprice, she had determined to revive. Of course the result of
her excursion to Regent's Park was simple ruin, first for the
pleasant Sunday afternoon, disorganised by so conspicuous
a guest; second, for the whole fabric of Bryan's domestic life.
Perhaps from here you find him too easy a victim. But
the skill of Mr. MAxwell's art is to suggest so vividly the
compelling charm of the lady that while disapproving you
comprehend. Also, of course, the conflict between Recti-
tude, even in Regent's Park (with Sunday suppers and a suf-
ficient income), and Romance, backed by the stately homes
of England (about which, as ever, Mr. MAxwijLL lets
himself go very cheerfully), was hardly a level one. I
won't tell you which wins, nor how; sufficient that the
course of the conflict provides a story filled with brilliant
colour which will hold your attention to the last page.
After that, perhaps, you may begin, a little ungratefully, to
wonder: Is A Man and His Lesson a work of genius, or a
seven-shilling shocker written by an artist” I give it up.
But of its qualities as a well-told tale there can be no
possible doubt whatever.
I take it that Mr. H. B. Manriott Watson has called
his collection of short stories Aftermath (CHAPMAN AND
HALL), as an acknowledgment that this field has already
been reaped once by the magazines, which was both honest
of him and (if I may say so without offence) superfluous.
Never did any tales reflect more unmistakably that world
of condensed violence of which we may obtain glimpses at
sixpence, ninepence or a shilling per month. Mr. WATSON
might have, but hasn't, divided his crop into two contrasting
sheaves, the grave and gay. Personally speaking, I own to
preferring the former. Melodrama, with an infusion of
bogey, is, I think, the mixture that he handles best ; and
nowhere are these more cunningly blended than in “Over
the Wire,” an admirable example of much sensation in a
little room. The clairvoyant at one end of the telephone sees
the murder of his friend at the other. “‘Marley !” he called
agitatedly, “there is a man—the man behind you. Look
out! My God.’” That's the stuff to—I mean, few readers
will remain unmoved by the thrill of such a situation. Not
all the stories are on this level; in two at least credibility is
strained considerably beyond breaking point—so much so
indeed that one is tempted to accuse the author of careless-
ness. Also, though the collection includes some mildly
amusing episodes, I found that, as a rule, Mr. WATson

could lift my hair more surely than he could shake my
shoulders. Individual taste will determine this as a
compliment or the reverse.
I should call The Gods Decide (METHUEN) a tale of which
the setting was worth considerably more than the story.
Mr. Richard BAGOT, I am very willing to believe, knows
his Italy at first hand. He has given us herq some highly
interesting disclosures of the extent to which, at the
time of the Italian declaration of war, the country was
systematically undermined by agents of the Central Powers,
who sought to prevent the abandonment of neutrality and
afterwards to destroy national confidence and p triot-
ism. To read Mr. BAGOT's pages of fact is to understand
only too clearly the tragedies that followed. I only wish I
Mr. CANDLER might have collected his information with an
industry beyond reproach, but if he had not possessed an
innate sympathy with the sepoy his time would have been
sadly wasted. More than once he compares the spirit
existing in a native regiment with that of an English
public-school, and even the most truculent critics of our
public-schools admit (if reluctantly) that their spirit is
not without merit. Not only has Mr. CANDLER given
us an opportunity to realise what our Indian soldiers did
for the Empire in the War, but he also writes of them
with a sympathetic understanding and an almost wistful
appreciation. Altogether a book which I should indeed
have been sorry to miss.
Mr. J. S. FLETCHER, in The Valley of Headstrong Men
could call his pages of fic-
tion equally absorbing, or
anything like it. I fear,
however, that the plot of
The Gods Decide is neither
specially inspired nor ori-
ginal. At this date the
countenance of our old
enemy, the signaller to sub-
marines, has become (how
shall I put it?) perceptibly
dusty. Nor was I ever in
any aching doubt that the
hero, married to a pro-Ger-
man neurotic, would attain
his freedom in time to em-
brace the heroine legiti-
mately on the final page.
Indeed my chief feeling was
that, in considering this an
affair for the decision of
the gods, Mr. BAGoT had
underrated his own influ-
ence. Still, it gave the
characters something to
talk about, an opportunity
of which they certainly

The hero, Oliver Carsdale,
who began life as a gar-
dener's boy at Ryvedale
Abbey, and had left the soil
for the mills, is obsessed by
the ambition to buy the
place and end his days its

that he took no effective
steps to do so, but let it be

when he heard this news

tracted round its handle so

its owner proceeded to the

the headstrong men who
foregathered there seemed
to take it as all in the day's

such rough going as is apt to result in some justified
bewilderment and irritation.
It is all to the good that Mr. EDMUND CANDLER ap-
proached the task of writing The Sepoy (MURRAY) with a
clear appreciation of its difficulties. “One must,” he says
in his preface, “be a regimental officer to understand the
Sepoy, and then as a rule one only knows the particular
type one commands . . . and one must always bear in mind
that every company officer who is worth his salt is per
suaded that there are no men like his own.” Mr. CANDI.ER

here, and he has submitted what he has written to officers

THE PRESERVATION OF HUMOUR.
[It is reported that at a meeting at St. Andrews the Rules of Golf
Committee stated that they had no intention of doing away with
“ the fun which the stymie provided.”]
MANY the changes, hard and cruel,
Arising from the recent War:
Butter is tight and so is fuel,
Post-bellum trousers cost us more;
But none may alter by a jot
The games that made us you know what.
Grecers have lost their grace of manner
And flappers half their length of skirt;
Under the red of Freedom's banner -
Your demagogues grow loud and pert :
But through all change from good to ill
Thank God we keep our stymie still.
Lately there ran an ugly rumour
That left me for the time unmanned—
Hinting that this true source of humour
Might very possibly be banned;
Its jocund days, they said, were done,
This Royal and Ancient fount of fun.
Bunkers are good to cure depression;
So is a slice that finds the whin;
A lake that drowns a long procession
Of new-laid globes will make you grin
But, oh, the other fellow's ball
Dead in your line is best of all.
How often, being laid a stymie
That fairly blocked my winning stroke,
I've said to my opponent, “Blimey,
This is indeed a topping joke;
This” (as I wept hot tears of joy)
“Is good enough for Punch, my boy.”
Happily Scotland now as ever
Stands where she did in point of mirth;
Her sense of humour, failing never,
Can see the finest jest on earth;
Though empires fall, she will not let
Our stymie perish. “Scotland yet!”
O. S.
THE BALLYBUN SOVIET.
MINUTEs of THE FIRST GENERAL MEETING.
UNANIMOUSLY resolved that a branch of the Sinn Fein
Soviet be solemnly inaugurated at Ballybun; that all meet-
ings of the Sinn Fein Ballybun Soviet be held at Finnerty's
after closing time; that Mr. Lucas Finnerty, Licensed
Victualler and J.P., be elected Grand Perpetual President,
with power to eject unsuitable members. . .
Mr. Finnerty, L.V. and J.P., then returned to the room
along with Dennis O'Riordan through the broken window,
and, after thanking the assembly for the honour done him,
said that the expression “one-legged viper” had no reſer-
ence to Mr. O'Riordan's qualities as a man and a gentleman.
Mr. O'Riordan had forsooth settled his account at the bar,
and henceforth he would be proud to walk arm-in-arm
with Mr. O'Riordan, steering the same ship of Ireland's
Independence to the same goal.
Mr. O'Riordan, speaking with great emotion and a cut
lip, said that as the last descendant of the Seven Kings of
Kildare he accepted the olive-branch in the spirit in which
it had been offered. He admitted having used the expres-
sion, “degenerate cattle-thief masquerading as publican,”
but that when doing so he was not reflecting upon Mr. Fin-
nerty as a public man, though he still maintained that he
was right in objecting to pay for nine glasses of ginger-ale,
a liquid with which he was wholly unacquainted.
Unanimously resolved by a large majority that sympathy
be expressed with our gallant allies, the Germans, Turks,
Bulgarians and Bolshevists, in their struggle against the
hated English tyrant, and that Mr. TROTsky be elected eac-
officio President of the Ballybun branch.
Mr. Cathal Ua Chavasseagha protested against the use
of purely Saxon expressions like “ear-officio.” He moved
that it be deleted from the minutes. He knew an Irish
word which would meet the situation, but it had just
slipped him. It was, anyhow, a tastier word, and he
moved that it be substituted.—Agreed.
Proposed by Seamus O'Brien (Peter) and seconded by
Peter O'Brien (Seamus), that all other distinguished and
representative Irishmen be elected honorary Presidents.
(Mr. Ua Chavasseagha here explained that “honorary” was
the word which had slipped him).-Agreed.
Mr. Ulick Dermott McMurteagh proposed that the
World's Peace Conferences be held in Ballybun, instead
of Geneva. Geneva was a hard place to reach by boat,
and most people mixed it up with Genoa. No place, he
would venture to remark, was so full of amity and con-
ciliation as Ballybun, and their genial host, he opined,
would continue to lend them his sumptuous Assembly Hall.
Mr. Murphy (Ballybrickeen) interposed. He said he
was as full of amity as any other body, but he objected
to this constant ramming of Ballybun down their throats.
His cousin had a finer assembly hall than had Finnerty,
and he forsooth would not sell the liberties of Bally-
brickeen for Finnerty's messy porridge.
Mr. Finnerty having suitably replied, they were separated
with great difficulty.
Mr. Flaherty McMorrow proposed that President WILson
be instructed to see that justice was done to the Irish farmer.
A visitor from Ennis said that, although he was only a
visitor, he could not help remarking, sotto voce as it were,
that farmers were the greatest robbers in creation. If
justice were done to the Irish farmer the price of hemp
would go up along with him.
There was then an interval of three-quarters of an hour.
The police having restored order and friendly relations, the
visitor from Ennis was removed to the infirmary.
The Chairman closed the proceedings by thanking the
meeting for the general good feeling that had prevailed.
He said that the eyes of the world would be fixed on the
Sinn Fein Soviet of Ballybum. He proposed that a sub-
scription should be taken for the broken tumblers, and that
they should agree to let bygones be bygones and bury the
pipe of peace harmoniously.—Agreed.
The proceedings then terminated.
-
“The reduced fee (£2 2s.) for the cremation of the remains of
Liverpool citizens is to be prolonged experimentally for another year.”
Liverpool Post.
“To balance the high cost of living the Parks and Cemeteries
Committee of Dundee Town Council yesterday agreed to make the
cost of burial a little more expensive.”—Dundee Advertiser.
Many thrifty Dundonians, we understand, are preparing
to migrate to Liverpool.
“A joint conference of 16 Food Control Committees was held
yesterday, to consider the winter milk prices. The farmers' repre-
sentatives said they were prepared to accept 10d. per quart for the
whole period from October to April. The conference subsequently
decided to recommend the respective committees represented to
suggest that the Divisional Commissioner fix the price at 10s. per
quart for the whole seven months.”—Lancashire Paper.
Some profiteers are born and some self-made, but the poor
farmer seems to have had profiteering thrust upon him.

Infuriated Scot (whose partner has lost the match with the shortest of putts). “WoRBRD's FAIL ME!”
WHAT A PITY YOU DIDN'T BRING YoUR BAGPIPES "
Partner. “DEAR, DEAR
A BYE DAY.
THE LAST of THE SEASON.
Following custom immemorial, the
last match of the Porthollow season
is played against the Visitors. It is
always played during a full September
gale and the visitors are always un-
successful.
This year Archibald was entrusted
with the captaincy of the Visitors'
eleven.
“You’ll play, of course?” he said to
me on one bright morning in the Cove.
It seemed a long way from cricket down
there, with both hands full of pilchard
bait, and the bay stiff with mackerel
simply asking for it, but I said, “Yes,"
and again, on the following morning,
“No.” This vacillation was the out-
come of an evening spent in watching
the village fast bowler, intensely virile
after four years of sea-warfare, exe-
cuting his companions at the net. But
Archibald promised to put me in seventh
wicket, by which time the terror might
be getting tired.
I didn't know then that he had
already made similar promises to all
those who had witnessed, and con-
sidered the results of, the village
bowling.
It should be explained that the date
of this match is fluid until the very
day. It does not really matter, as the
combined teams are always on the spot
and fishing amicably together until the
sea becomes too rough to fish. When
that occurs it is unanimously agreed
that the day of civil strife has arrived.
It will now be understood why the
game is generally played in a full gale.
Towards the middle of September
the weather began to favour the match.
“Danged owd lobster jumped clean
out a pot. She be gwine to blow
t’morrow,” said Samuel Pender, who
never errs in such matters.
So on the morrow we hauled forth
clean white trousers, scraped the bait
from our sweaters and breathed de-
fiance at the foe.
“Two Repton and one Winchester
eleven, two old county men, ourselves
and four unknown quantities,” Archi-
bald chanted in my ear as he surveyed
his company; “the wicket's a trifle
rocky and the outfield's rather moun-
tainous, but I think we ought to pull it
off this time.”
The Visitors won the toss and the
two Repton men opened the innings.
The ex-naval rating, bowling from the
life-boat end, was entrusted with the
first over. His opening ball, well on
the leg - side, came in and took the
batsman over the liver; the second ball
got up over the wicket-keeper's head,
curvetted past long-stop, and was even-
tually fielded by cover-long-stop, who
sat on it within a yard of the boundary.
The third ball pitched a yard outside
the wicket, failed to rise at all and hit
the base of the leg-stump.
The batsman returned to the pavilion
with every appearance of relief.
“This is like ToM RICHARDsoN and
D. W. CARR rolled into one,” I mur-
mured.
“They do seem to get about a bit,”
remarked Archibald.
There is no pleasure in giving a de-
tailed account of our innings. It was,
on the whole, a painful and demoralising
spectacle. When I went in fifth wicket
the Navy was not showing any sign of
ennui and the long-stops were still per-
forming prodigies. The first ball I
received broke five different ways and
yet was unable to elude them. The
second ball, being straighter, did not
reach the radius of their activity.
Eventually we were all out for 41
and if the smallness of the score is to
be deplored it must be remembered
that the agility of the long-stops was
amazing. There were only 18 byes.
Though our position could not be
described as a strong one, we took the
field in no despondent frame of mind.
After all, we had some bowling which
was not altogether to be despised.

approved fashion and the wicket-keeper

on many famous grounds—gave his
gloves a final pull, patted his pads and
stood ready to take the first ball. He
knew his bowler of old—fast medium,
pitching on the leg-stump, swinging
with his arm and clipping the off bail.
Everything, length, pace and pitch, was
all that it should or could have been,
but no one, except perhaps the batsman,
was prepared to see the ball break two
yards to leg.
“I can't insult him with a long-stop,"
Archibald whispered to me in the slips,
“but I think we must have a very fine
leg.”
"At the end of the second over third
man was also very fine, shaking hands,
in fact, with fine leg. At the end of
the third over the score was 13—all
byes—for no wicket, so Archibald tried
a double change with something very,
very slow.
This procedure, after an over from
each end, augmented the score by 16–
all runs—and long-on, in the act of
running for a skier, fell into a shell-
crater and sprained his ankle; so the
old order was reverted to, except that,
brutally callous of the wicket-keeper's
feelings, Archibald ordered a long-stop
to take up his position between fine
leg and fine third man. They made an
imposing trio, and the wicket-keeper
was so fascinated by their presence that
he found it almost impossible to keep
his eyes off them. They certainly gave
a memorable exhibition and between
them caught out four (three off their
gloves and one, whom the umpire de-
cided against without being appealed
to, off the nape of his neck) before the
necessary number of byes was obtained.
The final score read: Visitors, runs 23,
byes 18: Total 41. Porthollow (for
five wickets), runs 17, byes 26: Total 43.
This is, after all, a very just result, for
as Archibald, sitting disconsolately on
a crab-pot, remarked to me next morn-
ing, “Look at it how you will, there's
no getting: away from it that their
long-stops were better than ours.”
THE DEW-POND.
THE flowers that grow upon the downs
Are sharp and quaint, and hard to
find ; -
Thistles there be with fluffy crowns
And scabious, shivering in the wind,
And red-stemmed bell-flowers white as
SnOW
Whose name I do not know.
The grasses there are hard to break,
Tough, sun-brown grasses, ever sere,
Thick-hung with seeds that nod and
quake, -
Or pointed like a rusty spear;
And thickest grows the highest grass
Round where the dew-pond was.

A PROPOSAL A LA MoDE.
“WELL, old scBEAM, whAT ABouT IT?”
The pond is deep when dews are deep,
Rufiled and rippled by the breeze;
And all around the tinkling sheep
Can munch and nibble at their ease,
And choric frogs come to the brim
To sing their evening hymn.
Though now, alack, all brown and bare
The little pond lies in the sun,
And cracks and crumbles here and there
Among the grasses dry and dun,
The frogs say it will come again
After the first-long rain. -
And then again the stars will see
Their broken brightness on its face,
As in the hush of history .
When first it shone in that high place,
Like a grey crystal in the marge
Of some great Celtic targe. .
The moon will laugh upon it then,
Although no more its ripples hold
The images of wolf-clad men, .
Her bedesmen on these hills of old,
Who in the dew-pond cooled the blade
That their own hands had made.

TURN DER TICKET UPSIDE Down l’”
A REVOLUTIONARY.
AMONGST the horde of English ad-
venturers assembled in North Russia,
- the most English of all is Cooper-
thwaite, a Horse Gunner. The round
buttons he wears are more to him than
any medal, and the traditions of the
galloping guns are maintained in his
every action. Moreover, he is young
and impatient and full of ginger, full to
overflowing, so that he is ever eager to
administer of his surplus to the laggard
world around him. - -
Judge then how he is fretted by the
delay, deliberation and debate which
preface, accompany and succeed all
action in this vast inexplicable country.
Do you know the vehicle which we
English call a droshky 2. It consists of
a few planks mounted on four wheels,
and is drawn by a pony, part of whose
harness is a triumphal arch. Cooper-
thwaite tells me that this structure is
really the main essential of a system of
draught so admirable that he puts it on
a level with the Russian method of tea-
brewing; but to the layman like you or
me it is simply a triumphal arch worn
perpetually by the pony to encourage
him with the belief that he is being
welcomed at a journey's end.
This device fails, however, to raise
droshky mobility to the Horse Artillery
standard. The Russian pony is a day-
dreamer, if not a somnambulist. As
for his driver—to-morrow is in hand
if to-day is gone, and in the presence
of this great sky and the remote horizon
how pitiful is human haste!
Cooperthwaite pits his single-hearted
energy against the vast inertia of the
country. Coming here with visions of
galloping his battery into action along
(or up and down) the Steppes, he is
disappointed. Things are not what he
expected. But being a lad of uncon-
querable spirit, trained at “The Shop,”
he tries to master circumstance. Every-
one here is doing some queer or queerish
job. Sailors ridemules; soldiers handle
barges; R.E. drivers man telephone
exchanges; fire-eaters consume rations
at the base. Cooperthwaite, R.H.A.,
finds himself frequently conducting
strings of ammunition droshkies. So
engaged he might content himself with
being a picturesque figure, erect upon
his long-maned pony at the head of a
procession of little carts winding across
the damp green flats by the Dvina or
through the grey quaint wooden vil-
lages, each cart with pony and tri-
umphal arch complete, driven by a
bearded peasant in a blouse, his wife
in wild-flower colours, or a young son
or daughter.
But what cares he to be a figure in a
picture if march discipline be set at
naught? So his present pre-occupation
is the endeavour to teach droshky-
drivers to manoeuvre. The patriarchal
peasant and his broad-faced wife gaze
upon him with bewildered eyes as he
gallops up and down the column, elo-
quent concerning pace and the keeping
of distance. Why, think the peasant
and his lady, should they not doze at
ease upon their freight of shells while
the pony trudges at his chosen pace?
Why should they not leave the column
a while to cut forage by the way, or
pause to chatter to acrony in the village?
Why, when the restless Angliski upon
the pony wants them to stop, should
they not stop where and as they are,
in bunches of friends?
Yesterday I saw him trying to form
Battery Column with a hundred drosh-
kies. One Russian artillery soldier was
with him, heartily entering into the
spirit of the thing, and able to enjoy
the situation supremely, thanks to his
knowledge of Battery 3. and of
his country's peasantry. The old men
looked worried beyond speech, the old
women were scared into ceaseless
volubility, and the young ones prostrate
with laughter; but they formed Battery
Column in the end.
Who knows? Perhaps Cooper-
thwaite's heart-breaking endeavours
will not be in vain; perhaps hereafter
the droshky-drivers upon Dvina banks
will be a race apart, and their ponies

MNEMONICS.
You know the rhyme which begins
thus: “Thirty days hath September,
April, June and November,” and have
probably found it to be very useful. I
have written several others, for which
you will be grateful. Occasionally, per-
haps, you have been at a loss to know
whether a particular day was a week-
day or not. Nothing is more annoying
than to arrive at your place of business
on a day that is not a week-day and find
the place closed. The following rhyme
will prevent your making this mistake
if you memorise it :—
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Monday—
Note that all of these are week-days,
Leaving only Sunday.
There are many reliable cookery
books on sale, but, as a rule, they are
not portable. You can carry the
following recipe in your head without
difficulty and insure yourself against
hunger:—
When a kipper's in the pan
There's a meal for any man;
When its tail begins to burn
Then it's finished to a turn.
It is very disconcerting when some-
one in your neighbourhood has taken
poison and you cannot think of the
proper antidote. Perhaps the most
useful rhyme I have written for you is
the next, and it may be the means of
saving many valuable lives:—
POISONS AND ANTIDOTES.
Nitric acid down the throat
Always needs an antidote;
Take some soap-suds or some lime
If you have sufficient time.
Mercury and all its salts
Help to fill the family vaults;
Mucilages, whites of egg,
Help to pull the sexton's leg.
Ammonia is very bad
Taken by a growing lad;
Lemon-juice in water's best,
That will stop his going West.
When you are in company it is very
pleasant to be able to introduce a few
interesting facts into the conversation,
and they are easy to remember in a
form such as the following. There is
no need for your leaving the feast like
poor tongue-tied CAEDMoN and sleeping
with the cows in the stable:—
USEFUL FACTS (a Fragment).
Water weighs ten pounds a gallon.
Crocodiles are found in rivers.
There are six feet in a fathom.
Every soldier has a bullet.
Every bullet has a billet,
Which does not apply to soldiers
When away on active service.
Camels are not often thirsty.
Every hogshead has six firkins,
Which does not apply to hedgehogs.
Sawdust comes from sawing timber.
Firearms are bad for children.
If the babies throughout China
All were flattened like a carpet
They would cover the Pacific,
Leaving many baskets over.

they do not rightfully belong to him.”—Times.

[October 1, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FORERUNNER OF D'ANNUNZI0.
D'ANNUNzio is not the only liberator
who has entered Fiume. I was there
myself in 1889 in the same rôle, but
with less ambition. Nor did I arrive
in a motor car—it was not done in
those distant days—but in a tramp
steamer.
Fiume is a white and yellow town,
built along the narrow strip of flat
shore or clinging to the sides of the
mountains. It is divided in interest
between the sea and the soil, half the
place being concerned with shipping
and the harbour, and the other half
with vineyards. There is, however, a
little interchange, for the peasants must
descend the slopes in order to get their
wine on board, while sailors who wish
to return thanks for defence from tem-
pests or to ensure a prosperous voyage
have to climb (a very distasteful thing
to a seafaring man) to a ledge high
above the town on which the mariners'
chapel is perched. Here, if they are
thinking only of the future, they merely
light a candle, but if they have had a
narrow escape they deposit a votive
offering, which chiefly takes the form
of a rude but dashing oil painting of a
vessel under the direst difficulties, amid
boiling indigo waves, with her name
intensely visible, while in one of the top
corners, set in an oval effulgence, is the
Virgin calmly surveying the storm and
seeing that, in spite of the elements, all
is well, or not too ill, with Her faithful
follower. Several artists in the town
make a living by depicting these scenes.
Outside the church sat (when I was
there) an old woman who carried on the
somewhat subversive business of selling
charms against the perils of the deep.
Since I bought some, for myself, for the
captain of our ship, for the mates and
the engineers, and we came safely back
to England, I know that they were all
that the old woman said of them.
Our ship was taking on raw Hun-
garian or Dalmatian wine (which, by-
and-by, such is the iniquity of vintners,
was to be unloaded at Bordeaux and
transformed into claret), and during
this process, with the mates in charge,
the captain and I made little expedi-
tions. Just outside Fiume, to the north,
is the Whitehead torpedo factory; and
we went there. Then the road runs on
up the coast to Abbazia, a fashionable
watering-place, where the bathing is
done within a space wired against the
incursion of sharks, and we went there
in a carriage and pair, and sat among
Austrians eating immoderately of veal.
But it was too hot for more enterprise,
and for the most part we sat in the
shade and sipped, and smoked long
cigars with straws in them, or played a
variety of billiards with no pockets and
little ninepins in the middle of the table.
And what of the liberation? Ah, yes,
but it was so small a deed (compared
with GABRIELE's) that I was hoping
you had forgotten about it. However,
since it happened, and at Fiume, let me
tell about it.
One afternoon, after walking a little
way out of the town, we came to a
retired cottage, with tables outside
under a tree, and decided that to
repose there would be a more delect-
able proceeding than to adventure
further. We therefore sank into chairs
and ordered something to drink from a
woman whose very forbidding appear-
ance was the only discordant note. So
haggish indeed was she that but for
our lassitude and the pleasantness of
the situation we should have hurried
on. The wine, however, was refreshing,
and the captain, who was a great per-
former on the monologue, resumed his
narrative, either of a triumph of navi-
gation or of love (his two themes), I
forget which. But while he talked on,
and the Adriatic, spreading itself as a
mirror to the sun, increased the heat,
my attention strayed, and I became
aware of a fluttering beating noise near
by and little distressful chirps, and I
saw that, nailed to the cottage wall, by
the door, in the full sunlight, was a
tiny wooden cage, such as is made for
birds to be carried in, not to dwell in,
and there was a rebellious and very
unhappy goldfinch. The poor thing
flung itself from side to side of its
narrow prison in a disorder which was
rapidly becoming a frenzy.
The woman emerging at this moment,
I left my seat and made her look at the
wretched captive; but she only laughed,
and when I would have unhooked the
cage to place it out of the sun she
stopped me with a malignant gesture.
Very well, there was nothing to be
done but what D'ANNUNzio would have
done. I had to employ craft and ad-
dress. Waiting till the harridan was
well within the house again, I advanced
to the cage, undid it and watched
the goldfinch dart out and fly thank-
fully away; and then we also took to
our wings, the captain not with less
fear than I, but unsustained by any of
the moral enthusiasm which seemed to
be my due. He had, however, to retire
equally fast, the heat being forgotten
in the necessity for escape from that
terrifying monster.
When it seemed safe we sat by the
roadside to rest, and there exchanged
felicitations on the fortunate circum-
stance that we sailed the next day.
“Let me see,” said the captain, “where
was I when you interrupted me to in-
terfere with that bird 2" -
MR. PUNCEI EXPOSED.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I beg to cull the
following from the correspondence in
The Yorkshire Post:—
“Sir, – Surely ‘Punch' is caught
napping in this week's issue. On
page 258, col. 3, quoting from a morn-
ing paper, which says, “Remembering
the precious yield of the dust-heaps of
Ornithorhynchus, we may hope for
many new and amazing revelations of
buried history,' etc., Punch comments:
‘For our part we are confidently ex-
pecting a heavy crop of duck-billed
papyrus.' Should it not be platypus—
the ornithorhynchus?—Yours, etc.,
Sept. 17, 1919. S. M.”
In common with my friend “S. M.”
I also should like to point out one or
two little mistakes which occurred in
the same issue to which “S. M.” refers,
and which I feel certain must be due
to oversight rather than want of
knowledge.
In the first place, on page 253, col. 3,
I note the phrase, “turning the pages
of the patent log.” Surely this is a
mistake. I have a second cousin in
the Navy and he informs me—and up
to now I have always found him ex-
tremely truthful—that only the ship's
log is in book-form, the patent log
being more in the nature of a scientific
instrument, such as the sexton or
barnacle.
Again, on page 241, col. 2, I note,
“such difficult Polish phrases as ‘You-
shutupyerjaw.” I am afraid, Mr.
Punch, you have been caught napping
again; for if you read the word slowl
you will see that it is really English–
clearly a humorous attempt at a leg-
pull on the part of your informant.
Yours, etc., Yorks.
“The proposed Chuchow-Chinchow Railway
will run . . .”—Board of Trade Journal.
And for a jolly long time, if there is
anything in a name.

ment offices than there are to-day.”

They are no doubt more noticeable, now
that the flappers have been got rid of.
From an American book catalogue:—
“CYRIL MAUDE's LIFE OF TolsToy.

novelist. Sale price $2.60.”
But, with all respect to the popular
actor, we still think Mr. AYLMER
MAUDE's biography the best.

[In continuation of the theme of Mr. Punch's “Another Impending

well-known speech on the Nationalisation of Verse J
How strange that poesy with all its glories
Should still be so penurious a trade,
While vulgar writers of detective stories
Go rolling round in trousers rich with braid!
Ill-housed, ill-fed and sadly short of shoes,
The Lord knows why one cultivates the Muse,
When novelists have motor-cars in queues
And even journalists look less decayed.
The hours of other men may tend to dwindle,
The poets keep the Sixty-Eight-Hour Week;
Yet this remains the one industrial swindle
On which the WEBBs have so far failed to speak;
And so we die, neglected misanthropes,
Still stamping and addressing envelopes,
Still studying our cheques with microscopes
To make them look a little bit less bleak.
We breathe no threats of throwing down the
tabor,
Yet not for ever will we bite the dust;
The time is past when we would sell our labour
For private profit to a songless Trust;
We are but bards; for wealth we do not itch,
Only at last some small cathedral niche—
But why should all our publishers get rich,
Who couldn't write a ballade if they bust?
Why should these middlemen continue, blow it 2
Is not the bard the servant of the State?
Is not the Laureate the KING's own poet,
Proving that once (in 1398)
All poetry was vested in the Crown,
Proving that poets should be paid, cash down,
Nine hundred yearly and a house in town,
With ink allowance at the union rate 2
Then look what waste—with poets all competers,
And badly overlapping all the time,
All writing anyhow, in different metres—
No wonder none of them can raise a dime!
Would not our minstrelsy be much more terse
If we compelled our poets to rehearse
Under a well-staffed Ministry of Verse
Only the one grand Governmental rhyme?
Now over Helicon they speed the rumour
That profiteering in the Muse must cease;
Even the poor unfortunate consumer
May hope at last to have a little peace;
For we are not so mad as we appear;
We only sing because we must have beer;
And when we get good wages, by the year,
Be very sure our output will decrease. A. P. H.
“While Mr. “Pussyfoot' Johnson, invigorated with the waters of
Northern Europe, directs the strategy, the various associations seeking
to make Britain dry will employ more or less picturesque tactics in an
endeavour to exercise the “terrible demon of drink.’”
Running round after his tail is one of the best exercises
for a demon.

GAMMON.
Angela is not a lover of good litera-
ture; in fact, the only reading matter
she cares much about is the feuilleton
in the daily paper and, alternatively,
the Encyclopaedia. She will pick up a
volume of the latter at random and
read steadily on from wherever it may
chance to open, her mind leaping easily
from Asteroids to Asthma, or from
Wart-Hog to Warwick.
Looking up suddenly last night she
remarked, “Billy, you and I simply
must play backgammon this winter.”
“Why?” I asked.
“Listen. It says here, “Backgam-
mon, as a fireside amusement of a de-
corous nature, is a favourite among
clergymen, squires, farmers and retired
professional persons.’”
“My dear Angela," I replied, “while
yielding to no one in my admiration of
amusement combined with decorum, it
appears obvious that I am ineligible for
this—er—pastime. First, there will
be no fireside to speak of this winter,
and your book states distinctly that
backgammon is a fireside amusement.
We could hardly play round the gas-
stove in the scullery, which is likely to
be our rallying place during the long
winter evenings. We should simply
have to ask Jane to join in. Secondly
—as to my qualification—though it is
well known that in my youth I once
won a prize for Scripture, that hardly
makes me eligible under the heading
of clergyman. My tenancy of The
Acacias, nestling in upwards of a
quarter of an acre of old-world gardens,
does not, I fear, entitle me to the
gallant title of squire. In spite of hours
of labour spent on my allotment I am
still liable to fail in distinguishing
between broccoli and curly kale, a point
over which a farmer would experience
no difficulty. The necessity of main-
taining you in the style to which you
were accustomed before we married
precludes me from retiring from my
profession. And, last but not least,” I
wound up, “I don't know how to play
the game.”
“Oh, but they explain all that here,”
replied Angela, tapping the book. “Just
listen to this: “No point can be moved
to if covered by two men belonging to
the adversary; if covered only by one
man it is called a BLOT.’”
“The squire,” I intervened, “might
employ this offensive term, or even the
retired professional person, but I can
hardly imagine a clergyman using such
an expression. Frankly, Angela, this
game seems to me to be not quite nice.”
“There are two kinds of victory,”
Angela went on—“winning the hit and
winning the gammon."
“That settles it, Angela. I utterly
refuse to play a game in which I might
be tempted to win a gammon. It
sounds to me akin to gaining the leg
of mutton from the end of the greasy
pole at a riverside regatta. Suppose I
happened to let slip one day at lunch
that I had won the gammon the night
before. It would do me no good in the
City.”
I should have continued my argu-
ment further had I not realised that
Angela was not attending to me. Back-
gammon was no longer of any interest
to her; she was wrapped in the study
of Back-stays.
Marital Anomalies.
A propos of a recent wedding an-
nouncement in The Times, the bride
being a Miss HUSBAND, a reader recalls
from Punch MARK LEMON's couplet on
a Mr. HUSBAND's marriage:—
“This case is the strangest we've known in
our life,
The husband's a husband and so is the wife;"
and then adds a new commentary of
his own on Miss HUSBAND's marriage:
“But here is a lady who tells us with pride
She first was a husband and now is a bride.”

apparently sucked the last drop of juice
from the histrionic lemon, and ought
to have been sighing for fresh fruit.
But not a bit of it. One day he came
to see me and said—
“There has never yet been a show
which adequately combined Tragedy,
Comedy and Melodrama, Oratorio,
Opera and Musical Comedy, as well as
all that is best in Knock-about, Revue
and Cinematograph.”
“And never will be,” I ventured.
“Bosh!” he replied in that brisk
way of his. “I’ve thought it all out.
We must begin rehearsing at once. We
are touring the Midland Counties. It
is now the 2nd; we start for D On
the 24th.” -
If you knew Peter as well as I do,
you would not need to be told that we
did start for D on the 24th. The
troupe consisted of Peter, myself and
another enthusiastic amateur, together
with six enthusiastic amateuresses,
the whole neatly packed in one coach
(corridor, Midland Railway), complete
with properties, curtains, dresses (by
Mrs. P.) and wigs (by myself). The
scenery followed along behind in four
goods' trucks.
This may seem to be a deal of luggage.
It was; but we felt it to be unavoidable.
Thus, in the course of a single per-
formance, I contrived to combine the
rôles of Corsican Brigand, Lieutenant,
R.N., heroine (beautiful, jilted, temp.
RICHARD I.), seaside landlord, Doge of
Venice, successful Company Promoter,
Siegfried, Private 'Erb, and Samson (to
Mrs. P.'s Delilah). You see one had to
have a different make-up for each: one
simply can't be expected to await the
arrival of one's errant lord from the
Holy Land with requisite verisimilitude
if one is wearing a pillow under one's
white waistcoat and a heavy gold watch-
chain over it. The same applies to
wigs. If I had ventured to play Pri-
vate 'Erb in Samson's outfit, I'm sure
there'd have been trouble with the
military.
But the scenery was worst of all.
Peter is not one of your Elizabethan
simplicity specialists. Far from it. He
had a complete set for every turn.
Hence the four goods' trucks that fol-
lowed us to D
The first performance was to be at
three o'clock next day. Arriving at
the theatre very early on the following
morning we were informed that, as it
was Tuesday, the scene-shifters would
naturally be on strike. The manager,
however, showed us into the theatre.
I can't imagine what the last people
had been doing. They had very kindly
left us the stage and a two-foot dado of
cobwebs all round it; but that was all.
“Never mind,” quoth Peter; “we
must do it ourselves. Off coats | "
I spent a happy morning falling off
mouldering ladders and hammering
nails into my fingers, clinging with my
teeth to crumbling cross-beams, break-
ing the fall of drop-scenes on the back of
my neck, screwing staples into plaster
walls and watching them carry away
when the first strain was applied,
crawling like a fly along the ceiling
held up by the clinging folds of dust
and cobweb. The only rest I got was
when I tripped over the footlights and
alighted on my head in the orchestra,
where Ilay half stunned for five minutes.
My only lunch was the mouthful of
mortar that I swallowed when our main
front curtain was carried away.
But failure is a word unknown to my
Boss, and it was only a few minutes
after three that the curtain was rung
up. Hungry and dirty though I was,
when the call-boy came to call the

Quiet Person (as unpopular member noisily enters Club after long absence). “DUDsoN's GIVING HIMSELF A VERY HEARTY welcome.”
“Rich Uncle from Australia.” (myself),
I was somehow in time; the prompter
was there, and, when I went off after
my first turn, the senior scene-shifter
was all ready. It was a triumph of
organisation, all the more remarkable
when you realise that the rich uncle,
the call-boy, the prompter and the
scene-shifter were one and the same
person.
There was only one hitch in the after-
noon performance, and that was when
I mislaid the avalanche in the mountain
scene. It was my duty, after admin-
istering the dose from above, to rush
on in my capacity of Tyrolean peasant
and snatch the heroine from the jaws
of death. As it was I found it barely
in time, and in my hurry I missed my
footing on the ladder and came down
with the avalanche on to the heroine.
After that we had to cut out the parts
of the programme where she appeared,
as she seemed seedy.
After the final curtain a gratuitous
feat of strength on the part of the other
amateur brought the drop-scene de-
picting the walls of Gaza about our
defenceless ears, and it was decided
that only Samson could be trusted to
get them up again in time for the even-
ing performance.
This, together with a number of other
odd jobs, occupied my energies while
the rest of the cast refreshed itself.
This time I got no nourishment what-
SOever.
The evening performance went
swimmingly, especially the Grand
Naval scene, where the Lieutenant
dives from the bridge. He fell safely
into the net provided for him, but un-
fortunately caught his heels in the basin
which supplies the “splash,” and
emptied it over himself. His return to
the stage, with clear traces of the deep
upon him, was most effective.
I was the Lieutenant.
It was in the last turn of all, however,
that the spectators really got their
money's - worth. The drop-scene (re-
presenting a stately Venetian palace,
with the Lion in the foreground) was
safely lowered. We were all in our
places and the curtain was about to rise
when the Boss noticed with horror that
the drop-scene of the previous turn
(pawnbroker's shop, interior) had not
been raised. He rushed to the operating
cord and, heedless of my cries, hastily
raised it; without, however, noticing
that the skirts of my gorgeous train
were tucked in the folds of the rapidly
shortening canvas.
Judge then the surprise of the au-
dience when the curtain rose on that
sumptuous scene, that exotic company
of cringing courtiers, with the stately
Doge of Venice himself dangling head
downwards from a sky of rich Italian
blue. I remember thinking, as I kicked
out in my despair, whether it would be
better to hang up the whole show by
not saying my opening lines, or to try
to carry on as though I were meant to
be there. Finally, however, the train de-
cided the question for me by parting com-
pany with my gown at the shoulders.
I rebounded heavily from the sloping
roof of my own throne, and was caught
first bounce by the now falling curtain,
which pinned me to the stage like a wasp
in a window. As they carried me from
the theatre I could hear the audience
still applauding vociferously; and high
above the sound rose the voice of the
Boss congratulating his troupe.
“Splendid!” he shouted rapturously,
“splendid! There was only one thing
wanted to make the show really repre-
sentative and that we gave 'em. I had
clean forgotten to have an acrobatic
turn.” -

THE DIARY OF A MONTESSORIAN.
III.
September 26th.-Looking back over
the events of the last week I confess
that there have been moments when I
hardly hoped to bear up against the con-
centrated malignity of circumstance.
For days I had not the heart to keep
my diary, but now, thank Heaven (and
Mrs. Prant), I can breathe freely and
deeply again.
To recapitulate. On Friday Eva
swallowed a cork; or, to be more pre-
cise, she declared that she had swal-
lowed a cork, and it was just as trying
as if she had. It was not until Satur-
day afternoon that she confessed to
Dr. Gumbleton that she said so in order
to see what we would
do. Of course children
must experiment, but
experimenting with the
emotions of parents is
rather serious. Though
I had to give up two
lectures and a lesson on
the Hawaiian guitar, I
kept perfectly calm ;
and by Sunday I had
the situation well in
hand. -
Edwin, I regret to
say, completely lost his
head. He declares him-
self quite incapable of
coping with Jack and
Eva on a non-injunc-
tional basis. He also
states that it is impos-
sible for him to com-
bine attendance at the
office with the domestic
duties rendered neces-
Order, showing how with him the
pendulum steadily swings from macro-
cosmal vertiginosity to microcosmal
immobility. But even more helpful
was the advice of Mrs. Prant. We
walked back together, and I told her of
my troubles about the children. “Send
them to Gary,” she said; “I’ve sent
mine there.” And then she told me of
this paradise of children in Indiana,
where all the schools are conducted on
the basis of self-determination, where
the pupils make their own laws and
rules, keep the shops and run the banks,
and the fees are so moderate that even
allowing for the journey I should find
it cheaper in the long run.
How would Edwin take it 2 That
was the only cause of misgiving, but it
THE A.B.
THE publisher of the new Air Brad-
shaw (which is bound to materialise)
has not come out into the open. No
doubt he has not yet got his courage to
the sticking point. He is certain to be
heartily sworn at when his air time-
table is published, for “if you see it in
the A.B. it will not necessarily be so.”
Let us take an example:—
Supposing one day in the not far
distant future Aunt Jane says, “George”
(or Ernest, or possibly your name is
Albert Ypres, if you are young enough
to be made a memento of the War), “I
am going to Taunton. I promised to
go down to see your cousin Emma
one afternoon during the week. Just
look me up an air-bus
in the Guide, please,
and tell me what time
there is one back about
six o'clock.”

are living for the pur-
poses of this story).

sary by the flat refusal of Nurse to adopt
Montessorian methods, the inefficiency
of Miss Grindle as an invigilator, and
the apathy of the servants.
Now, while I am anxious to promote
the education of the children on sound
lines of self-determination, it is abso-
lutely impossible that I should sacrifice
my own efforts at self-expression. I
am attending courses of instruction in
Physical Culture (on the Maeso-Gothic
system), Cosmic AEsthetics, Esoteric
Inhalation, Siberian Voice-production.
To abandon these studies before they
have begun to bear fruit would be
nothing short of suicidal, and the worst
sort of suicide, because it would inhibit
a development of my highest faculties.
I put this before Edwin, but he was
cold and unsympathetic.
Things were at their worst when I
went to the Cosmic AEsthetic class on
Tuesday. Mrs. Oldmay was very won-
derful and helpful in her remarks on
Bobolinsky's synthesis of Chaos and
was speedily removed. By a coinci-
dence which was little short of provi-
dential he met me with the news that
his eccentric Australian uncle had died
and left him ten thousand pounds—a
wonderful windfall and so opportune!
For when I broached the Gary scheme
he said that he wanted a holiday badly
and would go over at once and inspect
the schools. He would then cable to
me, and I could easily find an escort
for the children; he at once saw that
it would be impossible for me to leave
London. Edwin thinks of going on to
San Francisco and Hawaii, and does
not expect to be back for at least three
or four months. But it may be good
for his self-expression, and, though I
shall be considerably hampered for the
next few weeks, until the children leave,
I hope to tide over the interim, with
the aid of Miss Grindle, old-fashioned
though she is. As Mrs. Prant said to
me, “Even Montessorians must some-
times resort to compromise.”
“There's one at 2.7, Auntie, gets you
there in nice time for tea; and then
there's one back at 5.57. What's this?
oh, Mons. ex. Let me see then, 6.12.
Another star—I suppose it's another
Mons. ex. Oh, no, it's all right; it's
a non-stop nose-dive as far as Ealing;
that's A1, gets you here at 7.29.”
“Capital 1" says Auntie. “But
please don't wait dinner if I should be
late. And now I'll just 'phone and tell
Emma I'm coming.”
About 1.35 you bundle Auntie into a
taxi (if and when found) with the usual
form of endearment used on the em-
barkation of aunts and trust that all
will be well.
But all is not well. Arrived at Worm-

mile gale blowing overhead, according
to our instruments, and we can't start
till it drops a bit.”
“But I've 'phoned to my niece that
I'm coming for tea,” says Auntie.
“Can't 'elp it if you've 'phoned to the
Queen, mum, to say you're comin' for
dinner. We can't control the winds—
not yet, anyway.”
“What time will it start then?” says
Auntie.
“Can't say yet, mum. Perhaps not
before to-morrow morning.”
“Then I can't go to-day ?”
“You can take the 2.23 to Birming-
ham, mum, if you like and catch the 3.52
from Birmingham on the loop-the-loop
line as it'll only be a cross-wind if you
go that way, but you'll have to pay two
pounds seventeen shillings excess on
your ticket. Much longer journey, you
see, mum.”
Auntie leaves the airdrome muttering
something about writing to Sir John
Alcock, telephones again to Cousin
Emma and returns to you at West
Kensington.
Hoping that the gale has exhausted
itself in the night, Auntie presents
herself again at the air station next
day and is informed that the 2.7 is
“Mons. only,” and if she didn't see it
in the Guide it was not the fault of
the A.B.
“There is a 2.43 which will start at
2.43, w. and w. T.,” says the dromaster.
“What does that mean 2 '' asks
Auntie.
“Wind and weather permitting,
mum. Otherwise it starts when it
can.”
As the wind is still favourable at
2.40, Auntie is assisted into the non-
smoking compartment of the 2.43 and
prepares herself for the usual bout of
air-sickness.
The next act in this air-drama con-
sists of a 'phone message from Auntie
at Devizes, which says in effect:—
“They landed me here at a quarter-
to-four, owing to engine trouble, so
they say. I am staying the night at
an hotel. I tried to catch the next
three air-buses, but they were all full.
It will be almost cheaper staying here
than coming back and paying another
fare, as no money is returned, they tell
me.”
The concluding act is more heart-
rending still, as it shows Auntie (minus
her bonnet) at Taunton (which she only
reaches—owing to continued engine
trouble and congestion of the other air
conveyances — on Friday afternoon),
where she discovers that Cousin Emma
has been unexpectedly called away to
Madrid or Cairo or some other foreign
resort for the week-end on urgent family
affairs.

This sounds a little precise, but the
advertiser was naturally anxious to
save people the trouble of looking for

THE THREE SHIPS.
I HAD tramped along through dockland till the day was all
but spent,
But for all the ships I there did find I could not be content;
By the good pull-ups for carmen and the Chinese dives
I passed,
And the streets of grimy houses each one grimier than the
last,
And the shops whose shoddy oilskins many a sailorman
has cursed
In the wintry Western ocean when it's weather of the
worst— -
All among the noisy graving docks and waterside saloons
And the pubs with punk pianos grinding out their last
year's tunes, -
And the rattle of the winches handling freights from near
and far:
And the whiffs of oil and engines, and the smells of bilge
and tar;
And of all the craft I came across, the finest for to see
Was a dandy ocean liner—but she wasn't meant for me!
She was smart as any lady, and the place was fair alive
With the swarms of cooks and waiters, just like bees about
a hive;
It was nigh her time for sailing, and a man could hardly stir
For the piles of rich folks' dunnage here and there and
everywhere. -
But the stewards and the awnings and the white paint and
the gold
Take a deal o' living up to for a chap that's getting old :
And the mailboat life’s a fine one, but a shellback likes
to be
Where he feels a kind o' homelike after half his life at sea.
So I sighed and passed her ~by—“Fare you well, my
dear,” said I,
“You’re as smart and you're as dainty as can be:
You're a lady through and through, but I know it
wouldn't do—
You're a bit too much a rich man's gal for me!”
So I rambled on through dockland, but I couldn't seem to
find
Out of all the craft I saw there just the one to please my
mind;
There were tramps and there were tankers, there were
freighters large and small,
There were concrete ships and standard ships and motor
ships and all,
And : all the blessed shooting-match the one I liked the
est
Was a saucy topsail schooner from some harbour in the West.
She was neat and she was pretty as a country lass should be,
And the girl's name on her counter seemed to suit her to a T;
You could almost smell the roses, almost see the red and
green
Of the Devon plough and pasture where her home port
must have been,
And I'll swear her blocks were creaking in a kind o' Devon
drawl—
Oh, she took my fancy rarely, but I left her after all!
For it's well enough, is coasting, when the summer days
are long,
And the summer hours slip by you just as sweetly as
a song,
Whº catch the scent of clover blowing to you off the
Shore,
And there's scarce a ripple breaking from the Land's End
to the Nore ;
But I like a bit more sea-room when the short dark days -
come in,
And the Channel gales and sea-fogs and the nights as black
aS Sln,
When you're groping in a fairway that's as crowded as
a town
With the whole damned Channel traffic looking out to run
ou down,
Ora * ... shore's waiting with its fierce and foaming lips
For the bones of poor drowned sailormen and broken ribs
of ships.
So I sighed and shook my head—“Fare you well, my
dear,” I said,
“You’re a bit too fond o' soundings, lass, for me;
Oh, you're Devon's own dear daughter—but my fancy's
for deep water
And I think I'll set a course for open sea!”
So I tramped along through dockland, through the Isle of
Dogs I went,
But for all the ships I found there still I couldn't be
content,
Till, not far from Millwall Basin, in a dingy, dreary pond,
Mouldy wharf-sheds all around it and a breaker's yard
beyond,
With its piles of rusty anchors and chain-cables large and
small,
Broken bones of ships forgotten—there I found her after all!
She was foul from West Coast harbours, she was worn
with wind and tide,
There was paint on all the bright work that was once her
captain's pride,
And her gear was like a junk-store, and her decks a shame
to see,
And her shrouds they wanted rattling down as badly as
could be ;
But she lay there on the water just as graceful as a gull,
Keeping some old builder's secret in her strong and slender
hull;
By her splendid sweep of sheer-line and her clean, keen
clipper bow
You might know she'd been a beauty, and, by God, she was
one now !
And the river gulls were crying, and the sluggish river tide
Made a kind of running whisper by her red and rusted
side,
And the river breeze came murmuring her tattered gear
among,
Like some old shellback, known of old, that sings a sailor's
SOng,
That wide. through his yellow teeth an old deepwater
tune
(The same did make the windows shake in the Boomerang
Saloon'),
Or by the steersman's elbow stays to tell a seaman's tale
About the skippers and the crews in great old days of sail!
And I said: “My dear, although you are growing old,
I know,
And as crazy and as cranky as can be,
If you'll take me for your lover, oh we'll sail the wide
SeaS Over,
You're the ship among them all that's wº me!”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM " dedicates Up, the Rebels /
(METHUEN) rather slyly to “any friends I have left in
Ireland after the publication of this book.” If there is a
note of apprehension in the words, it is not, I fear, un-
justified. Because there is small doubt that Up, the Rebels 1
kindly, tolerant, even sympathetic as it is, will make a
number of earnest folk in the Other Island very angry
indeed; those of them certainly who are not too pre-
occupied with romantic militancy to realise that their ranks
could be exposed to no H.E. more devastating than laughter.
This tale of tragic fun by our genial satirist combines, in
the old phrase, instruction with amusement. The picture
it draws of Irish political life during the War would be
incredible if anything about Ireland could ever be beyond
belief. As usual with a “BIRMINGHAM” story, the characters
seem to make it by their own actions; there is a whole crowd
of them here, all admirably drawn. Sir Ulick Conolly, repre-
sentative of British tyranny, mild, lazy, a confirmed believer
in the wisdom of letting things settle themselves; his
daughter, Mona, single-souled enthusiast for the Cause, who
wore picturesque and expensive draperies, “so far Irish
that no one meeting her in the street would have suspected
her of being an Englishwoman; ” Peter Maillia, poet, son
of a drunken peasant; Bettany, the universal deserter—all
these live, so that you may enjoy the clash of them and
understand the result of it with regret. The story tells
how between them these persons brought about the little
rebellion of Dunally, half farce, half tragedy, and what
came thereof. I have indicated the good entertainment
that the book provides, equal, I think, to its author's best.
As a first-hand study of an urgent problem it gives us some-
thing more. Dunally yielded to the persuasion of the guns;
if only one might dare hope that rebellion at large could be
won over by the persuasive CANoN.
Mr. H. DE WERE STACPooDE, working, as we used to be
told the coral insect did, only quicker, continues to produce
his desert islands in sufficient bulk to accommodate those
shipwrecked couples for whom the housing problem would
otherwise become acute. I jest, but I enjoy; for the fact
is that his latest creation, The Beach of Dreams (HUTCHIN-
SON), despite certain absurdities, remains a highly delectable
resort. Perhaps you know how Mr. STAcPoole can fill
your mental lungs with the ozone of unpeopled spaces; he
has the trick in full blast here, with a finely exhilarating
effect. Not that The Beach of Dreams could be called really
unpeopled ; indeed for a desert island the crowd was at times
almost excessive, including as it did the heroine, Cléo de
Bromsart, the two seamen who had been her fellow-cast-
aways, the hero (of course), and round the corner a whole
crew of undesirables. Nor does this take count of the sea-
elephants, whose society Cléo found so congenial. I am
bound to admit that the sea-elephants worried me not a
little. True, the scene of the battle between opposing herds of
them is a fine piece of imaginative realism, admirably told;

and elsewhere their behaviour was of the sort to appeal to
those who would call animal turns “too sweet"; but the
incident of the storm, watched from shelter by a group of
hero, heroine and baby elephant in the latter's arms, left me
frankly incredulous. I must not tell you more of what
happens on the Beach, but there is plenty of good adventure
there of the right Crusoe kind, including the discovery of a
cache containing all sorts of the most opportune necessities,
a device that I do not remember to have met before. I am
only sorry that the story has appeared just too late to fulfil
its obvious destiny in providing romantic relief for a seaside
holiday, where The Beach of Dreams would certainly form
an excellent antidote to the Beach of Reality.
Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar (METHUEN) is the latest
of the immortal—that is to say, unfinishable—Tarzan
stories. I still think that Mr. EDGAR RICE BURRoughs
does not quite play the game. “Could this creature,” thus
soliloquises a villain of the piece, “be the same dignified
Englishman who had entertained me so graciously in his
luxurious African home? Could this wild beast with blazing
quality of Felic is revealed. All this, if not startling in
novelty, would have made a good enough story. But it is
just here that, as I see it, Mr. Gower's personal emotion
got the better of his art. Because the author had so strong
a wish to expose the misdoings of a certain organism in
the B.E.F., poor Felix, once landed in France, declines
from a human hero to a peg upon which to hang denun-
ciations of the inefficiencies of the “Butterfly Corps.”
The charges, certainly horrid enough, may be deserved;
but the general result is that, while Mr. Gower's book
is never without interest, the interest is not the same
throughout—which is a fault.
Major A. Compett-SMITH is an enthusiast, and very
pºssibly the jovial style in which The Seafarers (CAssell)
is written is better than any other for his special purpose
here, which is to make us appreciate our Navy and to
clear away the cobwebs (if any) which veil our vision of it.
I am not convinced that we are as a nation quite so
ignorant of the value of sea-power as he seems to think us,
and I imagine that readers of his book may occasionally be

My impression of The Trial Stone (ALLEN AND UNwrn)
is of a story beginning with unusual promise, but subse-
quently weakened in effect, partly by the introduction of
a theme about which the writer's feeling was too strong
for him to subordinate it to artistic purpose. I must explain
this. , Mr. John Gower starts his tale quite admirably.
Nothing could be more entertaining than his introduction
of Feliz Neville, the spoilt, egotistical but good-hearted
product of parental mismanagement. All the Nevilles are
well done, but Felix himself and his futile mother are, at
this stage, almost masterpieces of ironical portraiture. The
trouble is that, having thus created a hero of real human
interest, Mr. GoweR has been constrained by his scheme
to let him do nothing but drift; and Felic drifting arrives
rather dangerously near to being a bore. Then, of course, the
War happens, providing (as the Stevensonian title explains)
a touchstone for the true and the false, by which the real
from a young American hand, MARGARET WIDDENER's. It
tells of a charming aristocratic South Pennsylvanian family,
five girls and three boys, and how they all fell in love at first
sight and in various ways achieved matrimony with a rash-
ness which may account for the rising curve of divorce that
is now causing so much heart-searching over there. I don't
mind stretching a point and endorsing the publisher's re-
view: “Youth—romance—humour—a story like a sunny
day in grey weather.” I will add “highly improbable,
sentimental, over-facile." But, as you're only young once,
why not write in this irresponsible way and represent
mating as a much less hazardous and perplexing problem
than it is in reality? And why not also give your reviewer
a chance for an ill-natured remark by a dedication, “For
Auntie; with love and thanks for insisting that I could write
prose?” If he is a sportsman (like me) he won't take it.

SIR, as a humble worm of that community
On which you're pleased to set your sudden heel,
Permit me, of your grace, to ask impunity
While to your sense of fitness I appeal;
As you are great and strong
De merciful if I am in the wrong.
For years you've drawn an Armageddon bonus
Of three-and-thirty shillings by the week;
While I in extra fares have borne the onus
Without a murmur, being soft and meek;
And, though there's Peace to-day,
Yet still you pouch that sum and still I pay.
No less, in spite of your superior manner,
Which threw a doubt upon my right to live,
I used to tip you every time a tanner
For any little help you deigned to give,
Although your claim was nil,
Being, in fact, included in the bill.
And now you strike to keep your war-time largess
When prices to their normal state subside,
And I must pay intolerable charges
For licensed vehicles (last week I hied
A few brief miles from town
And had to plank a full-sized Bradbury down).
This heavy cost of transport when I cab it
By sound economy must be replaced,
And so I thought of giving up some habit,
Innocent, but involving needless waste;
For choice I purposed to
Forgo the luxury of tipping you.
But ere I cease from slipping those gratuities
Into the palm of your protesting hand,
I want a balanced judgment, and to you it is
I come whose word is law throughout the land;
To you I look for light ;
Kindly advise me whether I am right. O. S.

Othello threatens to become the popular play of the im-
mediate future—in fact, if all the tentative plans now being
considered are successfully launched, it is doubtful whether
London contains enough theatres to house all the impend-
ing versions of the masterpiece.
Messrs. ARTHUR BOURCHIER and MATHEson LANG set the
ball rolling by proposing to interchange the parts of Iago
and Othello on alternate nights. Ever in the forefront of
the dramatic battle, Mr. OsCAR ASCHE, finding the tawny
complexion associated with Chu Chin Chow exceedingly
becoming, announces his intention to Othellise in 1929 or
at the conclusion of the run of Chu Chin Chow, whichever
happens first. Determined to be in the swim, Mr. RoPERT
LoRAINE, as soon as Cyrano has completed his West End
tour, will demobilise his nose and give his reading of the
tragedy. Finally it has occurred to Mr. NETTLEFold that
Othello is just the thing to go down at the Scala.
The productions mentioned above appear to be practi-
cally inevitable, but there are in addition a number of inter-
esting proposals of a slightly more nebulous character.
In the most disinterested manner those responsible have
allowed themselves to be interviewed by the representa-
tive of The Barnstormer, and in some cases have even
volunteered a résumé of their proposals.
Mr. LESLIE HENSON stated that he had always cherished
an ambition to play Ham—Othello, and had made a close
study of the “book" at school. As a result of his re-
searches he was inclined to think that the introduction of
a few “additional” numbers by Mr. HERMAN DAREwski, a
carefully-chosen chorus of Moorish maidens in yashmaks or
mashyaks—it was immaterial which—and a final scene in
a fashionable restaurant, would result in the whole thing
going with a bang from start to finish. He had commis-
sioned Mr. FRED THOMPSON to prepare an adaptation on
these lines, and, though not yet actually in negotiation for
a theatre, he was keeping his eyes open.
:: :k :k :k :}; :k ::
Asked if he could confirm his rumoured intention to
produce Othello, Mr. Owen NAREs stated that he was taking
| a referendum of the ladies in his matinée audiences, to
ascertain whether they would like to see him in a slightly
saccharined version of that tragedy. “As long as sugar
continues to be rationed,” Mr. NAREs continued, “I feel
that I owe it to the play-going public to be as sweet as I
possibly can. As a preliminary measure I have commis-
sioned Mr. FRED THoMPsoN to look over the play in the
original quarto.” --
% :: -k :k :: . . . ::
Mr. C. B. CochRAN, though immersed in the final arrange-
ments for the forthcoming contest for the Fleayweight
Championship between Bill Hopper of Balham (holder of
the Keating belt) and the “Kid Killer” of Chicago, gave
the following details of his next production at the Pavilion.
“To begin with,” said Mr. CochRAN, “I should like to make
it quite clear that Othelletta is entirely devoid of offence. It
contains nothing to which exception could be taken even
by a dramatic critic. Peg o' My Heart is not in the same
class for pure innocuousness. This matter has had my
personal attention, and as a final precautionary measure
Mr. FRED THoMPson's ‘book’ has undergone a rigorous
scrutiny by Dr. F. B. MEYER, Indeed, the adaptation is
so intensely unsophisticated that a recent rehearsal had to
be postponed owing to the outbreak of an epidemic of
yawning, which first attacked Mdle. DELYSIA and gradually
spread through the entire company, Mdlle. DELYSIA, by
the way, as a more than Moorish sultana, has the part of
her life; and representatives of all the Sunday schools in
the Metropolitan area are being invited to the first per-
formances. -

Interviewed during one of the intervals arranged to
enable the Alhamdrome audience to recover from its con-
vulsions, Mr. GEoRGE Robey confessed that he regarded
all his previous work, including his Special Constabling,
merely as a stepping-stone to the realisation of his am-
bition to play the part of Othello in his own theatre without
ſunny clothes or comic eyebrows. “In the interludes of
intensive poultry-keeping in my flat,” confided Mr. Robey,
“I have studied the part inside and out, and when the
time comes I fancy I shall be able to throw new limelight
on the psychology of the gloomy dean—Dane—that is,
Moor. Meanwhile I am in close consultation with Mr. FRED
THoMPsoN, and am keeping my eye on a suitable theatre.
When it becomes available I shall be extremely adjacent.”
::: ::: ::: :k :: : :::
Mr. FRED THOMPson, who is responsible for the “adapt-
ation ” of most of the original musical plays in being and
prospective, stated that he was so inundated with commis-
sions to prepare musical and other versions of Othello
that he had been compelled to open a special department
to cope with the demand. Several of his regular lyric
writers had collapsed under the strain and were now
undergoing treatment by a specialist, but he had been able
to obtain a new consignment of recently demobilised
poets, and hoped to be able to deliver the goods without
further delay.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
THE GREAT ADVENTURE.
AN INCIDENT OF THE STRIKE.
THE BRAMBLECOMBE WOLUNTEERS.
WHILE not aspiring to the rank of a
first-class railway, the line which runs
for thirteen miles between Wexmoor
(on the G.S.W.E.R.) and the thriving
port of Bramblecombe is (as the descrip-
tive writers say) at once unrivalled and
unique.
The service on the Wex Valley Rail-
way, though restricted, cannot be called
irregular. For several decades its one
train per day has never failed to run
each way, wet or fine. Punctually at
10.45 A.M. every morning the engine
draws its three carriages out of Bram-
blecombe and trundles along to Wex-
moor, arriving at or about noon. Bram-
blecombians have frequently caught
the midday train to London by it. The
return journey is timed to begin at 3.40
and end at 4.55.
The railway strike came as a shock
to the inhabitants of the Wex Valley.
Many farmers who had relied for years
on the passing of the down train to
awaken them from their afternoon
siesta overslept themselves for hours.
Fowls and ducks stood about, yawning
in amazement at the tedious delay of
the rushing monster that had never
before failed to send them scurrying
home across the fields in time for tea.
That Bramblecombe and Wexmoor
should be deprived of their train ser-
vice was unthinkable. The shock to
the Oldest Inhabitant might have
disastrous results. Moreover, the
PRIME MINISTER was appealing to the
country to cope with this national
calamity. Should the Wex Valley fail
England in her hour of need? NEveR!
A hastily convened meeting in the
Parish Room on Sunday evening after
church unanimously carried a resolu-
tion that the Wex Valley service should
be maintained at all costs. An execu-
tive was formed and more than enough
volunteers came forward as firemen,
ticket-collectors, stationmasters, points-
men and what not.
Early on Monday morning the Col-
onel stepped aboard the “Sir Redvers
Buller” and took charge of the loco-
motive department. Retired some years
ago from the R. E., he still possesses a
vigour and skill which many a younger
man might envy. The Rector's son
from Cambridge was first stoker, and
Blacksmith Riddell from Whipple-
combe Down acted as chief mechanic.
For all the passengers from Bramble-
combe there was at least one ticket-in-
spector apiece. Several tons of luggage
could easily have been handled by the
two-score porters, while the lines were
thick with signalmen, pointsmen and
shunters. Punctually at 10.45 by the
station clock the Colonel let off a blast
from the engine, the Rector blew his
dog-whistle in reply and waved his
green handkerchief, the army of station-
masters saw to it many times over that
the handle of every door was secure,
and a rousing cheer went up as the
Wexmoor Flier steamed out of the
station. One or two pointsmen nar-
rowly escaped amputation of their limbs,
but otherwise it was an extremely
gratifying start.
Owing to a slight misunderstanding
between the Colonel and Farmer Hum-
phrey, who had charge of the signal-box
at Whipplecombe Halt, the gates of
the level crossing presented a barrier
against which the Wexmoor Flier
scored an easy victory; and the gallant

Colonel was in no way dismayed, a
mile further on, by a little jar occa- 2.
sioned by a heifer being too preoccupied &
to distinguish between the up and
down lines. What signals there were
the Colonel ignored as doubtful of
meaning, the farm hands operating
them having initiated a system of
semaphore which was as yet only in
the experimental stage. The train
overran three stations before Black-
smith Riddell had grown accustomed
to the brakes. In the endeavour to
pull up at Whipplehampton, which lies
on a slight gradient, they over-shot
the mark by about four hundred yards,
slid back half-a-mile, and finally at the
third attempt came alongside the sta-
tion platform.
The Colonel and the Rector alighted
to compare notes on the way things
were going. The Rector as guard
thought they ought to have made better
going: the best part of two hours for a
journey of eight miles—by his watch he
made the time to be 12.35—was a speed
he suggested they might with safety
exceed. The Colonel's natural choler
was appeased by the discovery that his
friend had forgotten to put his watch
back an hour the night before. Bidding
good-bye to the cheering populace of
Whipplehampton, the Wexmoor Flier
resumed its journey up the line to the
tunnel that runs under the crest of
Whipplecombe Down. Perhaps the
heavy autumn dew still lay on the rails,
for no small difficulty was experienced
in surmounting the summit of the
gradient. With a good deal of groaning
and creaking the train slowly dis-
appeared into the tunnel. Then for
nearly half-an-hour strange shrieks of
machinery in pain, accompanied by
huge belches of smoke, issued from the
mouth of Whipple Tor Tunnel. The
Colonel, like the Pied Peter of Hamelin,
had apparently carried off his followers
to the mountain recesses of the Tor,
and these were the fumes of consuming
fires and the agonised screams of his
victims. However, on the very stroke
of 1 P.M. the Wexmoor Flier arrived at
its destination amid general rejoicing
and the mutual congratulation of its
voluntary officials.
Thus during the early days of the
strike the people of the Wex Valley
were the proud possessors of one of the
few regular train services in Great
Britain. All who wish may travel free
and without distinction of class, though
a general preference is shown for the
firsts. Even the permanent railway
officials at present on strike are per-
mitted to travel to and fro like ordinary
passengers. But Lawyer Quilpen, who
acts as Deputy District Inspector, has

them with travelling, not on duty, when
not in possession of a ticket. He says
it is immaterial whether tickets were
obtainable or not. This gives some
indication of the gay and careless spirit
which has gone so far towards making
our voluntary effort the success that
it is. F

OUR INVINCIBLE NAVY.
THE CALL of THE WILD.
ANYONE whose lawful occasions took
him to the port of Lerwick in the days
when Fritz was a sailor will support
my statement that it was not a resort
calculated to gladden the heart of your
mere pleasure-seeker. It had its limit-
ations in that direction. Nevertheless
it possessed one great institution.
When you went ashore at Lerwick
after a ten days' patrol you might find
exercise in scaling the streets of the
town, dodging hastily into doorways to
avoid passing vehicles; you might pur-
chase picture post-cards of the Town
Hall photographed at midnight, or, if
you were really out to sow wild oats,
our national tradition we could not
quite smother a feeling of sneaking envy
for the Swiss. We both felt that after
all there was something to be said in
favour of their geographical limitations.
“When once this war is over,” said
Cuthbertson on one occasion, “if ever
it is over, I shall bid a fond but very
firm farewell to the rude imperious
surge. The robins shall nest in my
sou'wester. I shall sink my sea-boots
full fathom five, beat my oilskin into a
gardening apron and my jack-knife into
a rose-pruner and seek out some se-
cluded inland spot where my first care
will be to forget which end of a ship is
for’ard and which is aft.”
“And I shall be with you,” I said
simply.
the direct co-operation of Cuthbertson;
whereupon the Senior Service decided
to try and muddle along as best it
could without my further assistance.
:: :: ::
Under the severe pressure of peace
routine I had almost forgotten the ex-
istence of Cuthbertson until one day I
came across his address scribbled on
the back of an ancient weather-beaten
envelope. I looked him up at once.
He is a solicitor in civilian life, and I
found him at his office toiling painfully
in the midst of formidable legal docu-
ments that reminded me uncomfortably
of income-tax. It was hard to recog-
mise in the person of this imposing but
harassed professional man the old
rebellious filibustering Cuthbertson of
you might squander
your pay on a string of
salted herrings; you
might even bite your
thumb at a Naval po-
liceman. These were
diversions to be fol-
lowed as the tastes of
the individual or the
humour of the moment
might dictate. But
whether you were a
Senior Skipper with
gold on your sleeve, or
only a cook's mate on
a harbour dredger, in-
evitably before the de-
parture of the last lib-
erty boat you made
your way to McCuddy's.
It was the only fitting
climax to the night's
entertainment.
At McCuddy's they

the Norwegian convoy.
When the first exuber-
ances of our reunion
were over we retired to
lunch.
“Different from Mc-
Cuddy's, this,” I said
encouragingly.
“Yes,” as sented
Cuthbertson, his eye on
the tariff. “Somehow I
seem to have lost the
remarkable food-lust I
used to have in those
days.”
“The North Sea cer-
tainly had its points,”
I ventured.
“Lord, yes,” said
Cuthbertson eagerly;
“give me the Navy
every time if you're
after the pure joie de
vivre. Do you remember
the old Norwegian con-
gave you a large and
steaming hot cup of coffee, together
with a sterling plate of ham and eggs,
redolent with glorious intoxicating
frizzly odours that brought the colour
to your cheeks, and all for the ridiculous
sum of sevenpence. It was wonderful.
I dream of the smell of that ham still.
It was here that I first met Cuth-
bertson. We sat opposite to each other
at a little table in a corner, stirring our
coffee and regarding our eggs and ham
with shining eyes. He was the first to
speak.
“This,” he said slowly and emphati-
cally, “is the goods.”
We were sworn brothers from that
hour.
We were working on the Norwegian
convoy at the time, and had both
reached that stage in the career of every
citizen-sailor when the glamour that
overhangs naval warfare was beginning
to dissipate a little. The gilt, as you
might say, was off the ship's-biscuit.
While fully sensible of the grandeur of
We met periodically at McCuddy's
to bewail the comfortless lot of them
that go down to the sea in trawlers,
particularly those of the Norwegian
convoy. When we foregathered for the
last time before I was due to sail for a
distant base we exchanged addresses
and pledged ourselves in a cup of coffee
to seek each other out when the mantle
of NELsoN should have finally fallen
from us.
“If ever we do meet in less turbulent
days,” said Cuthbertson, “we’ll forget
this unfortunate phase in our careers.
I have the very deepest respect for the
Navy as a fighting force and a weapon
of Imperial defence, but as a mode of
life I must confess I find it exceedingly |
trying. To speak plainly it bores me.
Do I carry you with me in this?"
“You do,” I replied with emotion.
Next day my trawler departed for
fresh fields of activity, where in due
time we succeeded in bringing the War
to a triumphant conclusion without
voy, and that Commander at the Patrol
Office with the voice guaranteed to
shatter a plate at fifteen yards?”
We proceeded to exchange remin-
iscences greedily.
“Do you know what I mean to do?”
exclaimed Cuthbertson at length, when
we had so far worked ourselves up that
he was waving his soup-plate gracefully
to and fro after the fashion of diners
endeavouring to counteract the motions
of a trawler in a rough sea, and I had
more than once hailed the waiter with
“Ahoy, cooky.” “I mean to charter a
bit of a yacht next year and have a cruise
round the old haunts. I suppose you
wouldn't care to ship with me?”
“Nothing better,” I cried.
“I'm afraid it won't be as jolly as it
used to be,” he said regretfully; “there'll
be no U-boats for one thing. And we
shall miss the rich naval flavour.”
“We may run across a couple of old
drifting mines to bring a bit of the at-
mosphere back,” I suggested hopefully.

Cuthbertson shook his head sorrow-
fully. “I fear we shall never be able
to recapture the first fine careless
rapture of hearing a full-blown deep-sea
fishing skipper gently chiding the
trimmer for spilling paraffin in the tea-
kettle. Rare pleasures of this sort
lose their delicate charm the second

I tried to cheer him by talking of
McCuddy's and the prospect of ham
and eggs and coffee for seven pence, but
it was not till we were leaving that I
caught a glimpse of the real Cuthbertson
of old. By the door stood a magnificent
commissionaire, portly and dignified, in
a gorgeous uniform of blue and gold.
As soon as he saw him Cuthbertson's
face lit up with pleasure.
“By Jove, the very man!” he exclaimed
joyfully. “We'll hire him for the trip;
it'll be as good as sailing aboard an
Admiral's flag-ship.”
In his delight at the prospect he
squared his shoulders and with head
and eyes turned smartly to the right
marched out, favouring the startled
door-keeper with a faultlessly executed
Naval salute.
THE MoDERN WERSION: Strike while
the iron's cold.
HOW THE STRIKE STRIKES ANNE.
Anne finished folding up with careful
fingers the minute silken flag which
for so long had adorned the front of
her doll's house.
“Now that peace is over I shall
have to ask Nurse where she's put
the dark blinds for the doll's house,”
she remarked with a tiny sigh.
“But the Lighting Order isn't in
force again. What do you want the
dark blinds for 2 " I asked.
“Won't they make us shade our
lights again, then?” she asked in sur-
rise. “What about air-raids 2"
“But there won't be any air-raids,”
I assured her. “There isn't a war on
here now, you know.”
Anne pondered this statement for a
moment. “What is it, then 2" she
asked. “We’ve got to have ration-
books again, and I'd just frowed away
Teddy's and Dolly Dumps's, so I shall
have to make them some new ones, and
Nurse says next week we shan't have
any cakes with sugar on the top and no
currant buns. It's just like the War.
What is it really?”
“Well, you see,” I explained, “it’s
the strike, and ->
“What is the strike?” Anne inter-
rupted me. “I promised Teddy I'd
find out and tell him ; you see he isn't
a very big boy and he doesn't quite
understand” (here she lowered her voice
that she might not wound Teddy's ten-
der susceptibilities); “but he thinks
it's just like the War, and he's been
drilling all the morning ready to go and
fight.” -
“You can tell him I hope there won't
be any fighting,” I said; “it’s only that
the railway trains aren't running pro-
perly, and it won't be easy for people
to get things; there won't be much
milk for the poor babies most likely"
(“They can have mine,” put in Anne
stoutly), “and it will be difficult to get
to places and that sort of thing,” I con-
cluded rather vaguely.
“Oh,” said Anne in a rather un-
convinced voice, “then there won't be
any poor wounded either? So I needn't
practise nursing?”
I seemed to catch just a hint of dis-
appointment in her voice.
“No, they won't want nursing cer-
tainly,” I said; “and it really isn't
much like the War, though it seems
rather like it just at first, I know.”
“'Tisn't zactly like Peace either,
is it?” said Anne; “but I'll esplain to
Teddy as well as I can.”

NEW FIGHTS FOR OLD.
No longer is it possible for the fiction-
writer to enliven his flagging tale with
a good round bout of fisticuffs, recorded
in plain yea-and-nay English. No
longer does it suffice for him to write
that “Brown struck Williams a right-
hand blow.” He must bear in mind
that four out of five of his readers have
an almost morbidly intimate knowledge
of the technique and argot of pugilism,
and specify whether the blow in point
was a lead, hook, jab, jolt, swing or
upper-cut. -
The following up-to-date version of a
celebrated fiction-fight is offered by
way of illustration:— -
IN THE RUGBY RING.
At the sound of the gong both
principals skipped to the centre of the
arena and proceeded to mix it in no
niggard fashion. Each man led savagely
and repeatedly, without deigning to
stop or to block, apparently expecting
to hand out the K.O. without loss of
time. Neither realised his ambition, it
is true, but a number of straight lefts
got home on either headpiece, and there
were indications that the contest would
not go the full course. On points it
was the Slogger's round.
“For heaven's sake, Tommy, keep
out! ” implored East, as he towelled the
School-house Hope during the interval.
“Don’t try to counter him—come right
back. Feint if you like, but let him
lead.”
The carillon for resumption found
both men fresh and with an unchanged
foreign policy.
“There he goes, in-fighting again,”
groaned East, as Brown once more took
his merchandise for sale within the
prohibited area. He dumped two dan-
gerous left jabs and endeavoured to
re-embark with dues unpaid, but the
Slogger was too quick for him, shaking
his man with a clever right hook as he
retreated. A brisk rally ensued, in
which Tom's imports largely exceeded
his exports, and he was at last put
down for a count of eight by a nicely
timed right swing to the occiput.
Prices now favoured Thompson's Slog-
ger by 2 to 1 (t. and o.)
During the recess Brown under-
went some badly needed sponge-work
at the hands of his chief second.
“Tommy,” observed the latter, “this
may be funny, but it ain't fighting.
He'll put you out in five minutes if
you don't slip him. Come back, I tell
you. If there isn't time, side-step,
duck—anything but go in as you're
going. Make him lead to you, but
don't try to cross-counter yet—wait till
he blows and then drop it in on the
solar plexus. We'll look after the
point later on.”
Third round. This was mainly a
strategic retreat on the part of Brown,
who seemed at last to realise the
wisdom of his henchman's advice and
was taking full advantage of the twenty-
four foot enclosure. Mr. Groove, a
familiar ring-side figure, was heard
to remark that he had not witnessed
such masterly footwork since the days
of CHARLIE MITCHELL. Finally Williams
halted, pending repairs to bellows,
whereupon a jubilant scream arose from
the School-house Citadel.
“Now, Tom,” sang out East, “what
I said.”
Brown was inside the fence in a
twinkling, lying close to his man and
jolting strongly with right and left over
the heart. Williams covered up to
avoid further unpleasantness, but no
sooner was the embargo raised than
Brown whistled home again with a
couple of genuine rib-roasters. The
Slogger seemed annoyed. He now
rushed, but Brown side-stepped neatly,
leaving his opponent to come harm-
lessly to earth in a neutral corner.
Betting: 2 to 1 against the Slogger.
(Offered by Mr. Groove. Declined by
Mr. Rattle.) -
The succeeding round was the least
dramatic of the fight, the School-house
Hope working round and round for an
opening, while the Slogger propped him
off with his long left. Brown was now
displaying a marked facial puffiness
and was bleeding at the tooth-box;
while the Pride of Thompson's showed
several purple patches in the vicinity
of the mark.
During the next session Brown was
cautioned for holding, but the objection
was ruled out by young Mr. Brooke,
the Referee, on the grounds that the
contest was being decided under P.R.
rules. Shortly afterwards, a vicious
right upper-cut from the Slogger having
failed to connect, the round ended in a
clinch.
From this point forward the School-
house Hope, finding that his fraternal
embraces involved no risk of losing on
a foul, presented the ring with a superb
exhibition in the Graeco-Berkshire style,
repeatedly throwing his man and falling
on him. And so the battle dragged on
to the end, which came none too soon.
Dr. T. Arnold (Headmaster) appeared,
whereupon everybody except young
Mr. Brooke left Big Side in a hurry.
A poor inconclusive contest. In the
absence of a stake and sidestakes—
to say nothing of proper organisation
beforehand—this is hardly to be won-
dered at ; but if Tom Brown wishes
to claim the welter-weight champion-
ship of Rugby School I suggest that
he must meet the Slogger again under
the following conditions:—
(1) Queensberry Rules.
(2) Meeting to be held at Olympia,
Holborn Stadium, the Albert Hall, or
some other recognised temple of the
fancy; and
(3) Mr. EUGENE Corri to replace
young Mr. Brooke as Referee.
For exclusive special interview with
both principals, see appendix at end of
chapter.
THE SEA TROUT.
(Western Highlands.)
THE stag to the hill
And the bee to the clover,
The kite to his kill
And the maid to her lover,
The bard to his dreams
And the scribe to his cunning—
But I to the streams
Where the sea-trout are running.
The streams of the South
Flow in green meadow places;
You open your mouth
And breathe in the soft graces;
Their brown trout are wise
And take time to consider,
And you stalk every rise
Like a hart in Balquidder.
In the North the streams flow
With the peat running through them,
And the gods long ago
Have hurled granite into them;
The sea-trout's a flash
Silver sudden as laughter,
And he comes with a smash
And considers it after.
At forty yards fair
Off the reel he'll deliver
A leap in the air
And a roll on the river,
And the issue 's in doubt
Till the net 's underneath him,
And he dies a sea-trout— -
Better bay could I wreathe him 2
The loveliest–oh
For a music that I lack
To sing you his snow
And his silver and lilac
The wildest, the best
And the bravest of fishes,
And, however he 's dressed,
The most dainty of dishes.
But the stag to the hill
And the bee to the clover,
The hawk to his kill
And, a hundred times over,
My heart to the “brow”
In brown pools and romantic,
And the trout running through
Off the tides of Atlantic.
Ferdie, the Freak.

DISTRESSING POSITION OF RAILWAY STRIKER WHOSE SON, BEING SULKY, REFUSES TO TAKE HOME
HIS THAIN.
A FLEET STREET PRACTICE.
I MET him last August at a restaurant
in Fleet Street. He was making an
excellent lunch and looked opulent.
In spite of this I took a fancy to the
man; somehow he looked like one who
has taken his chances in the world.
I sympathised, too, with his glance of
amused contempt at a sallow youth at
the same table, who in his zeal for the
horse-breeding industry was scanning
the early evening paper for possible
winners. The sallow youth made a
note of two “naps” and departed,
looking miserably optimistic.
This fleeting vision of the gay world
of Sport led to a disjointed conversa-
tion between the stranger and myself.
Finally we got on to cricket. Here he
became very interesting, and he evi-
dently loved the game. He had a
slight Northern accent and was, I
think, unduly prejudiced in favour of
Yorkshire. I ordered another cup of
coffee and told him a few things about
Kent.
I was just beginning to impress him,
I think, when a man passed us on his
way out and said, “Good morning,
Doctor.”
The stranger nodded in reply and
then began about HIRST. As he was
speaking my second cup of coffee
arrived.
“I suppose this is bad for one in the
middle of the day?'' I said as I took it.
• A look of intense pain—almost a
spasm—came over his face at once.
“For heaven's sake don't talk about
that,” he said abruptly, and then began
to ask me about Woolley.
“But,” I said, “I thought, as a doc-
tor, you would be interested in questions
of diet.”
“I hate them,” he replied fiercely.
He took a gulp of coffee and then leant
across the table and said, “Do you know
who I am 2"
I hate riddles and I thought of saying
“Yes” and leaving him, but he gave
me no time.
“I am the well-known West-end
physician who grants interviews to
correspondents of the evening papers.
Now you know,” and he sat back in
his chair as though the worst was over.
“Great Heavens,” I said, “so you
are actually the man who advises peo-
ple to wear lighter clothes during a heat
wave 2"
“I am that man,” he replied; “I may
also mention that during a cold snap
I strongly advise them to wear warmer
clothes. I also point out that it is not
wise for a man of ninety to try to walk
as far and fast as his grandsons. As
for diet, hardly a week passes but I
warn a special correspondent against
lobster mayonnaise.”
“Do you find it hard work?” I asked
after a pause.
“Rather wearing,” he replied; “with
Fleet Street as a sort of consulting-
room and my thousands of anxious
patients waiting for advice, I am kept
pretty constantly at it. Of course I
play the game. An unscrupulous man
might make a fortune out of it.”
“How 2 " I inquired with natural
curiosity.
“Well,” he said in a reflective tone,
“suppose that I, with my huge prac-
tice, were to write strongly urging
people of all ages to live on suet pud-
dings during foggy weather; I could
then go up to the City and buy suet
pudding shares for all I am worth.
When the fog came I should sell out
at the top of the market.”
At that moment a boy came in—it
was just after two o'clock—and handed
him a 6-30 edition. We looked it over
together; but there was no interesting
news. Then with a groan he pointed
to the “Stop-press” column. The
heading ran : “Old lady collapses
while bathing—gallant rescue by a
boatman.” -
“I am sorry to leave you,” said the
West-end physician, “but I must go
at once and warn my elderly patients
that they must be careful about bathing.
I shall probably add a little advice for
young bathers too. Good-bye.” -

ONCE life was a series of petty annoy-
ances. I loathed the postman's knock,
heralding as it did the arrival of letters
which had to be answered. I hated the
dustman, who usually arrived about
6 A.M. and by loud discussions of the
day's betting forecasts ruined my beauty
sleep. The railways too—how I longed
for the blood of the demons who began
shunting at two in the morning on the
line near my house. The yodel of the
milkman was a torture to me. I re-
monstrated with him once about his
practice of “Milk-ho-ing" when all
decent people were in bed, and he
seemed to regard me as a poor being
with no sense of melody. He continued
and even aggravated his yodel. Then
when I had settled to work in the morn-
ing there were the constant ringings
of the tradesmen. I could hear the loud
laugh of the butcher as he flirted with
one or other of the maidservants at the
side-door—most distressing not only as
a crude and objectionable noise, but
because it created an awful fear that he
might go so far as to marry the girl and
leave us face to face with the dreadful
servant problem once more.
And now !
We had a strike of the dustnen a few
months back, and to-day I rejoice when
I am awakened by a rolling of rubbish
tins and a hoarse but genial voice say-
ing, “You may take my tip or leave it,
but Little Vic 's a dead cert for the
3.30.” They are working—bless the
ſine fellows'

nate condensed milk. A delightful rat-
tat from the postman cheers me, for it
shows that a mail has got through.
Happiness comes to me when I hear the
butcher and the baker at the side-door.
What matters a little friendly flirtation
if we are provisioned for another day?
I remember the awful week when the
bakers were on strike and our home-
grown staff of life was apparently com-
posed of putty.
I only need one thing to be perfectly
happy—to be roused from my sleep by
my old railway friends shunting. There
was a peculiarly squeaky clank that
ran along a line of shunted trucks which
I miss sadly. If they knew how their
music was appreciated I am sure they
would return.
“What is it, Jane 2''
“The curate, Sir. He does not want
to interrupt you at your work, but he
is just calling for your subscription to
the Boys' Brigade.”
I feel that I should have more re-
spect for the clergy—who have far
better reason for striking than any
other section of the community—if they
only had the pluck to down cloth and
intimidate the public with the threat:
“Not a subscription invited, not a col-
lection made, till we get a living wage.”
“The taxicab and motor-car piled with lug-
gage remain a familiar London sight. It is
more surprising to encounter in the heart of
London men and women carrying bags and
parcels and obvious strangers."—Times.
Very surprising for Eye strangers, wo
should think.

“MY CHILDREN USED TO BE MONSCHUS Fox D of THIS YER PAINTIN', BUT THEY've GRow ED out of IT."
A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,-Very many thanks
for your cheery epistle with the account
of the Hornblower obsequies. It must
have been a jolly affair—the mourners'
hurdle race afterwards, I mean.
As for myself I continue with my
discovery of England. I am at the sea-
side, but as I do not care for shrimping
in a top-hat I have shunned the fashion-
able resorts and am at present camped
in a tiny fishing village which clings to
the flanks of the Cornish cliffs like a
nest of limpets to a rock.
Here leaps ashore the full south-
west, heavy-winged with the scents of
brine, sea-weed and pilchards. Drifts
of sea-pinks and sea-holly mist the
cliffs and dunes with frail colour.
Black seine-boats lie among the
houses, poking their curved snouts in
at the windows to sniff your breakfast
rasher and a non-stop orchestra of wind
and wave renders Wagnerian selections
throughout all meals.
The native housewives dump their
rubbish on their door-steps and punc-
tually, twice a day, the Atlantic rolls
up and carts it away.
Punctually, twice a day, as the tide re.
cedes, the local drake, Francis, marches
his harem of ducks across the wide
stretch of sands to high-water-mark, to
see what edible flotsam that universal
provider the sea has coughed up, ready
to dispute d outrance with the gulls the
possession of any particularly tooth-
some morsel. To the beach also on hot
afternoons come the local kine, flatten-
ing out the children's trench systems
and paddling with the best of us—
which, now I come to think of it, may
account for the salt in the butter.
In thick weather the fog-horns of
passing ships, and the village donkeys
(tethered on the cliff-side), blare dis-
consolately at one another all night
long. -
The men-folk of the place arise at
four o'clock in the morning and row
out to see whether any crabs or lobsters
have been foolish enough to tumble
into their booby-traps. The rest of the
day they spend either propping up the
Lifeboat House or paddling visitors out
to the pollack grounds. This is en-
thralling sport.
The visitor reclines on the bottom of
the boat among a jumble of rusty
ballast, sea-weed, bait and fish-hooks,
praying earnestly for death, while the
mariner (who is paid by the hour) dis-
courses pleasantly on the perils of the
deep and dangles the strings.
I have not done this myself; I have
seen too many robust visitors suffer
dreadful sea-change; moreover I have
scanty faith in the string-dangling sys-
tem of fishing. It seems to me to
depend far too much on the gullibility
of the quarry. For me the Mills bomb.
You grasp the grenade in your right
hand, extract the pin with your left,
and heave. If there is a fish (or fishes)
anywhere in the neighbourhood you've
got it (or them).
The whole affair is settled one way
or another in ten seconds. The method
is simple, quick, clean and effective,
and to my mind infinitely preferable to
jockeying a bucking dinghy over a
ground-swell, your lunch butting at the
“barrier of the lips,” the joie de vivre
gone from you, waiting till the village
idiot of the deep chances along and
gets his silly self firmly entangled in
your bit of barbed wire.
However, the fish-blasting season is
over, they tell me. It is not being done
any more in these days of Peace. It is
string-dangling or nothing now.
Yesterday morning as I lay in my
warm bed listening to the teeth of the
early bathers chattering on the beach
(a favourite diversion of mine) I heard
the voice of the Philosopher uplifted
towards my window. Wrapping my-
self in the eider-down I leaned out and
inquired what his trouble was. He
waved a large bundle of twine at me
and said his family had sent him out to

fish. He would like me to come and
watch him do it. When I was ready
I would find him at the far end of the
beach. -
I bombed Albert Edward out of bed
with wet-sponges, breakfasted and set
out for the rendez-vous. We found the
Philosopher sitting with his back to a
rock, a pocket chess-board on his knees,
working out a problem. He welcomed
us warmly, told us where we would
find the gear and advised us to get a
move on before the tide turned.
Albert Edward inspected the col-
lection of oddities that the Philosopher
had assembled and scratched his head.
- “I say, what about bait?” he inquired.
The Philosopher looked at him over
his spectacles and tut-tutted. “Dear
me! Isn't there any bait 2 Then I'm
afraid we shall have to get some.”
Albert Edward agreed; he was afraid
we should. He picked up a couple of
lance-hooks, tossed one to me and we
started work.
For the benefit of the uninitiated I
will explain that lances are small eel-
like critters which inhabit the wet sand.
You scratch for them with an iron hook
about eighteen inches long. Any in-
shore dweller can experience all the
sensations of this sport by walking up
and down a ploughed field, bent double,
feeling for worms with a crochet-needle.
At the end of an hour we had scratched
an acre or so of sand and had secured a
lance and a half between us.
The Philosopher not having provided
us with anything to carry them in,
Albert Edward dropped the catch into
his trouser pocket and we returned to
headquarters. It took us some time to
draw the Philosopher's attention away
from the affairs of a queen and a
bishop.
“How many have you got?” he
inquired.
Albert Edward felt in his trouser
pocket and his face went blank; all too
late he remembered the hole in it.
“Well, not any, as yet.”
The Philosopher shook his head.
“I’m afraid that's hardly enough,” he
sighed.
Albert Edward agreed; he was afraid
it hardly wasn't.
“I fear we shall have to try again,”
said the Philosopher. “Most annoying
after all our labour—still, there are
thirty hooks to be baited.” His nose
drooped over his problem again, like a
tufter's on a cold scent, and Albert
Edward and I took up our scratchers
and went at it once more.
At the end of an hour and a half we
had ploughed another acre of sands, with
the net result of four lances, which
were assigned to my trouser pocket
this time. Albert Edward paused in his
labours to straighten out the kinks in
his spine. “Good fun, isn't it?” he
remarked. “I can hear my vertebrae
click every time I move.”
We sank down on the sands and lit
cigarettes.
The Demon-Twins (aged twelve
years and twelve years and fifteen
minutes) padded up and regarded us
curiously.
“What are you doing?” they de-
manded together.
“Blackberrying,” said Albert Edward
shortly.
“Don’t you believe him, my sons; he

nesting.” -
“Funny, aren't you?” sneered Twelve.
“I know what it is,” shrilled Twelve-
fifteen; “you're lancing, and you're
stuffy because you can't catch any.”
“Fat-heads !” said Twelve.
“Chumps ' " said Twelve-fifteen.
They padded off, giggling derisively.
Albert Edward sniffed. “I adore
children, don't you? Like little rays of
sunshine. Hello, here's the mermaid.”
The Sea-lady paddled towards us,
kicking the surf about with pink toes
and looking very rosy and cheerful.”
“Don't you find it rather damp
sitting there 2" she called.
“Not half so damp as standing up
sorting through tons of sand with a
tooth pick,” said I.
“If fifty fools with fifty hooks should scratch
from two till eight,
Do you believe,' the Walrus said, “they'd

—also the directions on mouse-traps.
By the way your charming little
brothers have just passed along.”
The Mermaid nodded. “I know.
They've been lancing all the morning.
Look.” She displayed a tomato tin
brimming with the nasty little brutes.
“Good Lord, how do you do it?”
Albert Edward exclaimed, and there-
upon dilated on our heroic labours, the
unsporting behaviour of the quarry,
and the trouble the Philosopher would
get into with his family if he arrived
home fishless. The cruel girl was not
in the least moved by our intense
sufferings, but at the mention of the
Philosopher she softened all over.
“Poor darling,” she crooned, “what
a shame ! Here, take these.” Impul-
sively she thrust the tomato tin upon
Ine.
“But—but won't the Twins object 2"
I demurred.
“And what if they do? You don't
think I'm frightened of those little
brats, do you ?”
“I don't know about you,” said I,
“but not a few strong men on this
beach—myself included—turn pale at
the mere sight of them.”
“You ought to be ashamed of your-
selves then,” she scorned. “Two big
brawny brutes like you! Anyhow, give
these to the Philosopher with my love.”
She waved her hand and paddled home
to lunch—fortunate girl!
We found the Philosopher lying be-
hind his rock, bound hand and foot.
We asked him what he thought he was
doing—imitating Houdini, the Hand-
Cuff King, or practising the Indian
rope trick? He explained that he was
unravelling the spiller line, but was
under the suspicion that he had made
a mistake somewhere. He would be
much obliged if we would remove a
hook from his pectoral tissues. There
were numerous others embedded in
various portions of his anatomy which
were not quite so excruciatingly pain-
ful and which, he had no doubt, he
could bear with.
We drew out our pocket-knives and
by 2.30 P.M. he was a free man and had
returned to his chess problem. By 3.45
Albert Edward and I had got the severed
line tied together again and the hooks

knotted on once more. By 4.10 they
were baited. By 4.30 we had the spiller
laid out along the sands ready for the
fast in-coming surf to cover it, and
reported as much to the Philosopher,
who was masticating the paper wrapper
in mistake for the cheese sandwich it
contained and perusing a racy little
“Treatise on the Synchronous Vibra-
tions of the Soul.” He promised to
keep a watchful eye on the line and
advised us to trot home, as it must be
getting on for lunch-time, he thought.
As we sped up the boat-slip we
passed the Demon-Twins; they were
crouched among some crab-pots staring
out to sea with the wide innocent eyes
of childhood.
“Don't altogether like the look of
those little perishers,” said Albert Ed-
ward. “It struck me they were con-
cealing something from us behind a
pot.”
I nodded. “They're out after blood,
and I've got an idea it's ours they
want. They won't like losing their
lances.”
“Oh, well, I don't care; I’m not
really frightened of them. Are you?”
“N—o, not really,” said I.
At about seven o'clock we returned
to draw the spiller. We found most of
the visitor population, summoned by
some mysterious agency, on the beach
awaiting the miraculous draught.
The Philosopher was still behind his
rock, still absorbed in “TheSynchronous
Vibrations of the Soul,” completely ob-
livious to the babbling crowd about
him. A whale might have come along
and taken him and the spiller into its
belly without his being aware that any-
thing untoward had occurred.
We pulled on the line. Several will-
ing hands sprang to our assistance. The
first hook came ashore. It was bare—
bare even of bait. The second was
stripped also. Likewise the third and
fourth, the fifth and the sixth, and so
on even to the twenty-ninth.
Not a single fish dangled on a single
hook; not a single lance remained.
Albert Edward looked at me. I looked
at Albert Edward and nodded.
People began to titter. “One more
pull,” shouted a helper. “There must
be something on the last hook, it's so
heavy.”
We brought the last hook ashore
with a run, and the helper was right—
there was something on it. People
laughed outright this time.
“Dear me,” purred the voice of the
Philosopher in my ear. “A dead cat!
I wonder how it got there?”
“Do you?” said Albert Edward
dryly, his gaze resting on two small
figures sitting near by on a sand-dune
staring out to sea with the wide inno-
cent eyes of childhood. “Do you? I
think I have an idea.”

Adjured his followers to keep their heads;
Whereat some answered, by their doubts impelled,
“We'll keep our Heads, but not if they are swelled.”
THE TERRORs of ART.
Painter, your portraits make you justly feared,
Forecasting traits that have not yet appeared;
So, when you limned Hyperbolus, they say
Two fees he readily agreed to pay—
One for the picture, one for the condition
It never should be placed on exhibition.
OF PROFITEERS.
Six years ago a huckster lank and lean,
But now a Prince (to judge him by his mien),
See how Banausus, treating us like toads,
Rolls roystering along the crowded roads.
Yet who will envy traders who succeed
In wringing riches from their country's need?
Beggars, on horseback set, ride to the devil;
The Profiteer speeds to a lower level.
OF WIZARDs.

Wrestled to gain the mastery of the State;
Meanwhile, belaboured by conflicting blizzards,

THE ILLUSION COMFORTING.
ONCE upon a time—and a very discontented unsettled
time at that—there was a hill with a wood on the top of
it through which the wind used to rush and roar, and, as
the hill was steep and some little distance from the town,
not many people found their way there. But one morning
the woodman, who was sawing logs from one of the trunks
—for this was a time when a man who had a saw was
almost as lucky as a man who had a bicycle—was astonished
to see a number of men climbing the hill; not countrymen,
but very obviously townsmen, for they wore black coats,
and carried small leather cases or bags and newspapers,
and not a few had top hats.
They ascended the hill at a great pace, each singly
and each now and then looking at his watch; but when
they got to the top they stood all together among the
trees waiting as if in some suspense.
Now and then one would say something; but another,
who seemed to be the leader, would hold up his hand and
make a silencing sound.
The woodman, being curious about this invasion of his
solitude, was about to inquire of the leader as to the reason
for it, when a gust of wind began to stir the forest, increasing
in volume with each moment, and, as they heard it, a look
of ineffable joy, not unmarked by a certain wistful melan-
choly, illumined the faces of the crowd.
“What is it?” the perplexed woodman asked.
“What is it?" cried the ecstatic leader. “Can't you
hear the wind 2"
“Of course I can hear the wind,” said the woodman.
“But what of it? Why does it cause you such happiness
mixed with regret 2"
“Because,” replied the leader, “it makes a noise exactly
like the 8.53—the dear old vanished 8.53 to town.”

AT THE PLAY.
“REPARATION.”
THERE were obvious reasons why
Mr. HENRY AINLEY should be attracted
to the part of Fedya (Tolstoy's “Living
Corpse”), but clearness of motive could
hardly have been one of them; for his
character and the springs of his actions
were always much too obscure to hold
our sympathies. Fedya is an habitual
drunkard, and on his own admission
a thoroughly bad egg; but, while he
deserts an adoring wife in favour of a
gipsy, we are not to be misled by the
spectacle of his amorous embraces
into supposing that his relations with
the girl (her unfortunate name is
Masha) are anything worse than Plat-
onic. He is good enough to bear his
wife no ill-will for being deserted by
him ; indeed he would be quite glad to
see her comfortably married to an old
admirer for whom he has a great re-
gard; but when it comes to a question
of divorce this besotted creature, guilty
of every offence except the technical
sin of infidelity, finds his sense of
honour too nice to allow him to tell the
necessary lie which would set his wife
free.
Nobody in the audience believes for
a moment in the sincerity of so fine a
distinction, and nobody is sorry (except
at the thought of losing Mr. AINLEY)
when Fedya is seen making arrange-
ments for suicide as the only form of
“reparation.” It does not come off,
however—he is too much of a coward;
besides, it is far too early in the play.
Instead he takes means to appear to
be drowned, and so starts a new career
as a living corpse.
You might suppose that he would
not be content with growing a beard
for disguise, but would disappear alto-
gether; on the contrary, he apparently
remains in the neighbourhood of his for-
mer wife, now happily remarried; and
eventually in a moment of drunken
expansion gives the whole thing away
during the course of a doss-house con-
fidence. He is overheard by a black-
mailer and is arrested by the police,
together with the wife, who is charged
with bigamy. In the end he recurs to
his original idea of suicide, and, though
well aware that it comes too late to
affect the charge of bigamy, he commits
that anticlimax.
We live in gloomy days, and I was
not greatly surprised, last week, that
more people had not faced a walk home
to the suburbs for joy of the good
cheer offered at the St. James's Theatre.
For myself (living within easy walking
distance) I had no fault to find with
the sombre and sordid atmosphere of
the whole business; I could easily have
borne much worse things (though the
flat tones of the singing gipsy-girl tried
me hard) for the sake of Mr. AINLEy's
acting in the doss-house scene, and the
gracious charm of Miss MARION TERRY;
but the obscurity of Fedya's motives
and standard of honour (to say nothing
of his wife's affections which I could
never properly localise) left my head
exhausted and my heart untouched. I
don't blame anybody, but it is always
unsatisfactory when you don't care
twopence what happens to your hero
and heroine.
It was a pity that the promise of the
first scene was not fulfilled. It had a
quiet air of IBSEN and aroused no ap-
prehension of the melodramatic devel-
opments that were to follow. I drew
high hopes from that scene, based not
only on the attractive appearance and
manner of Miss MEGGIE ALBANESI (as
Fedya's sister-in-law), but also on the
samovar, which gave me confidence that
the milieu was true Russian. Not
that I question the rest of the local
colour, though I was never quite con-
vinced by the gipsy lover, who seemed
to me to lack the seductive arts of her
kind. But then, as I have hinted, her
relations with Fedya were not accord-
ing to convention.
That clever actress, Miss ATHENE
SEYLER, was not well suited in the
part of the wife; but Mr. Ion Sw1NLEy,
as the second husband, gave a very
firm and solid performance; Mr. OTHo
STUART, as a prince and a general com-
forter, showed a suave decorum ; and
the Bohemian histrionics of Mr. CLAUDE
RAINs came near at times to dispersing
the ambient gloom. But I doubt if even
|the gifts of Mr. AINLEY (whose return
is extremely welcome) will serve to
carry off a play whose interest is so
remote in its appeal to the general
sympathy and understanding. O. S.
The Day of Rubber.
For centuries a tropic plant,
Obscure and insignificant,
Common to both worlds, West and
East,
I did no good to man or beast.
Yet now my rich and viscous juice,
Turned to a locomotive use,
Has lent the rigid chariot wheel
The limber movements of the eel,
And oils that kindle and explode
Have made me Monarch of the Road.
The wonders of nature, as described
in two articles in The Chronicle:—
“THINGS SEEN.
AN ECHO.”
“THINGS HEARD.
THE CARCAss.”
ORATORY AT THE ZOO.
ADEQUATE criticism is a great satis-
faction; but how rarely one meets with
it... I have read my share of leading
articles on the Upheaval; I have heard
more than my share of remarks upon
it—in the street, in the home, in the
bus; but for the best general comment-
ary I had to go to Regent's Park and
to a speaker of foreign extraction. He
gives no suggestion of culture; he pro-
bably never wrote a word in his life;
but you should hear him on the Strike!
I found him in that portion of the
park which is railed off and entered
through turnstiles and where a stratum
of rocks suddenly breaks through the
earth and rises to a height unusual in
London. Here I walked near and far.
I could, had I liked, have ridden in a
four-in-hand drawn by llamas or upon
the backs of elephants or camels, but I
preferred the new and popular means of
locomotion. One thing that very soon
struck me both with astonishment and
regret was the number of empty resi-
dences. We have heard so much about
the congested state of London, but I
can assure you that in the Zoo there
are too many rooms to let.
But all this is beside the mark; what
I want to tell you is that in one of the
cages under the raised terrace dwells—
with too few neighbours—a swarthy
observer of life who is known as Ursús
Americanus. He is in the second cage
on the south side from the west end,
where the great open bear-pit is, now
the home of Billy. Talking is the great
accomplishment of Ursus Americanus
—he is the only talking bear in the
Zoo—and, as I stood by the barrier in
front of him, he lifted up his voice and
began. At first I was uncertain as to
the theme of his jeremiad, and then
gradually Irealised that it was the Strike.
Never was a subject so handled—the
inopportuneness of it, the folly of it, the
failure of it, the wickedness of it, the
pathos of it. Every aspect drew forth
the mot juste—or to be exact the in-
flerion juste; he ran through the whole
gamut : surprise, anger, despair, disdain
and grief. But you must go to hear
him—Ursus Americanus, in the second
cage from the west end on the south
side, not only the sole talking bear in
the Zoo, but the sole bear with sound
social and political views.
One word more. You must take a
piece of very hard biscuit or crust with
you, for that is his solvent of speech.
With soft food he is merely moody and
mute. =

Refined Little Girl. “You KNow, Lucy, I've GNLY on E FAULT To FIND witH our PIGs.
THEY WILL GRUNT WITH THEIR MoUTHS FULL.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Poor Relations (SECKER) reveals a new side to the art of
Mr. CoMPTON MACKENZIE. Realism we have had, and
romantic graces; here is the lightest of light comedy,
dancing on the edge of (and occasionally slipping into) farce.
The idea of it is simplicity itself. Take a prosperous
dramatist, with pockets full of royalties, son of a family
surely the most horribly greedy in fiction—and watch them
devour him. Because the plot, save for the slight and
rather obviously foreordained love-affair of John and his
lady secretary, keeps rigidly to this one plan, I will not say
that even all Mr. MACKENZIE's dexterity preserves it from
some effect of sameness. In other words these Touchwoods
do strike me as a long time over their meal. Also I was
haunted by the problem of how John, human, humorous,
and almost incredibly long-suffering, came to be surrounded
by such a crew of cannibals. This said, however, my
carping is at an end. If beauty as such holds no place in
Mr. MACKENZIE's present scheme, his command of the vivid
phrase is as arresting as ever. Thus on the first page we
are introduced to John amid a crowd of passengers leaving
New York by liner, and hoping silently that “the sense of
being imprisoned in a decaying hot-water-bottle would pass
away in the fresh Atlantic breezes.” Later again we get
the hero condemned to a detestable dinner in Carlington
Road (not without wistfulness did I find myself on such
historic ground !) and reflecting critically on an interior of
“ pink lampshades and brass gongs”—surely West Ken-
sington in a phrase To sum up, a book in my jealous eyes
not wholly worthy of a writer whom I should like (rather
unreasonably) to confine to bigger work, but one that will
at least provide the maiden of bashful fifteen with the
unusual treat of reading Mr. MACKENZIE aloud to an
unperturbed glandparent.
In so far as Mr. STACY AUMoniER wrote The Querrils
(METHUEN) with a propagandist purpose, I suppose his
object was to reveal the dangers of family life for the young.
You detect already a new doctrine, one not unprovocative
of thought. Broadly stated, one might call it the peril of
over-protection. To illustrate his theme the author takes
a family of the ultra-cohesive type, gently nurtured, whose
rather too comfortable nest was hedged about with every
kind of sanction, and lined throughout with a snug down
of mutual esteem. The Querrils (surely a needlessly awk-
ward name) owned the kind of home in which photographs
accumulate, and Victorian furniture is preserved for associa-
tion; where the cat is tacitly not supposed to torment dear
little birds, and the natural instincts—for “natural” read
“predatory"—are for the most part conveniently ignored.
Into this gentle company Mr. AUMoNIER proceeds to hurl
a bomb of horror, of ignominy and unspeakable disgrace,
and says in effect, “Watch how they take it.” I will not
tell you the precise nature of the catastrophe, beyond saying
that its mechanism hardly carries full conviction: I doubt
very much for one thing whether any jury would have
found Peter guilty of the offence into which he is trapped.
That of course is, however, a minor point. Mr. AUMonIER

is more concerned with his Querrils, shattered at first by
the blow, then gradually closing their family ranks again,
till time and the War (from the first I felt that the War
would catch them before the end) bring final separation.
Not a cheerful story, sometimes a trifle too long-winded,
but undeniably original and sincere.
I should like to re-name The City of Palms (HUTCHIN-
son) with the title “The Undefinable Something.” The
unknown element was for ever appearing, whether as some-
thing mysterious in the aspect of the desert, or something
strange in the expression of the minor characters, or as
something else within the heroine, Sylvia Rocke, forbidding
her to accept a cigarette, as on page 81, or willing her to
tania converted from a pacifist into an activist. Mr.
SINCLAIR's suggestion is that this was quite a common
third degree procedure. I take leave, in the interests of
Anglo-American friendship, to doubt it, and to mention it
as characteristic of the author's zealous method. But how
came Jimmie to be tortured at all? ... Well, having been
transferred, after behaving in a very gallant and unexpected
manner, from the French to the Russian front, he found
himself up against his old friends the Bolshevists, and
began fervently and indiscreetly to preach the dark creed
to his fellows. That was asking for it, no doubt. But
Jimmie kept his end up till his torturers broke his reason
and he died a martyr to the best that was in his creed.
The book—Jimmie Higgins (HUTCHINson)—puts the case
stop where she was, as on
for entering the War from the
page 152. This last “some- ſº º *… point of view of an interna-

in rapid succession, of sudden pallor, complete whiteness

ordinary proposal of marriage made in the most normal
and favourable circumstances. And when one of her
leading and most robust male characters was labelled “an
amiable youth,” I was thoroughly antagonised by this
patronising attitude to a very deserving sex.
Mr. UPTON SINCLAIR is one of those writers who is more
interested in his thesis than in his characters, and perhaps
too much concerned about his cause to be altogether just
to other points of view or even to records of fact. So you
will do wisely to take a little salt with (for instance) his
description of unspeakable tortures inflicted by an American

[OCTOBER 15, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DIDYMUS OF THE N.U.R.
A CHARACTER SKETCH.
I HAVE not the advantage of a personal acquaintance
with Didymus, but the events of the last few weeks, during
which he has been obtruded upon the public vision with a
prominence which must have been very painful to so
retiring a nature, have thrown his personality into sharp
relief; and from the evidence of his own statements and
actions, and the conclusions they invite, one is enabled to
realise a character almost unique in its clarity and
consistency.
Fundamentally a man of moderation, Didymus desires to
be known as an Apostle of Peace. He is never to be seen
without an olive-branch in one hand, whatever lethal
weapon he may be brandishing in the other. The day on
which he and his friends declared a strike that had been
engineered with a forethought worthy of the German High
Command and a secrecy that would not have disgraced our
own Intelligence Department was the saddest day in his
life. The seventh day of his failure to shake the courage
of the community was perhaps sadder still.
It is to his credit that he had been so absorbed in the
advocacy of Peace that, although he represented a body of
men of whom not much more than sixty per cent. had stayed
at home during the affair with Germany, he appears to have
forgotten altogether about the War and ; lessons in
rapid organisation which the Government had learned in
the course of it.
A passionate enthusiast for Law and Order, he protested
vehemently against the statement in The Times that the
strike threatened the nation with bloodshed; yet he ad-
mitted, when it was all over, that the country had been
within an ace of civil war. This only proves that he is
too honest a man to hold to an opinion when it no longer
serves his purpose.
Risen from the ranks of Labour, and himself, in earlier
days, a working man, he recognises that the wealth of the
country is largely in the hands of the first or second gener-
ation of men who have risen from the same ranks. Hence
his sympathy with Capital as coming within the legitimate
aspirations of Labour. - - -
Other Labour leaders may confine the term Labour to
the class that is engaged in certain forms of manual exer-
tion; but Didymus is too broad-minded for that. He is
well aware of the existence of myriads and myriads of other
workers—struggling clerks, typists, shop-girls—who have
never had their wages doubled to meet the rise of prices,
and would be happy with half the earnings of a locomotive
driver. No one knows better than he that it was this class
—and not the rich, whom it scarcely affected—that suffered
most by the strike which he promoted; and the thought
was anguish to him.
Ever devoted to the cause of co-operation as between
Capital and Labour, Didymus is confident that this great
end can best be achieved by indirect methods which permit
a temporary obscuration of the facts. This explains why
his strikers were allowed to imagine that they were fighting
for dear life against a body of bloated Capitalists in the
persons of Shareholders who had nothing whatever to do
with the dispute, and belong for the most part to a class
of society with incomes not exceeding his own. The view
that the end justifies the means is often, as in his case,
found to be consistent with the possession of a very sensitive
COIlSClence.
Didymus is a true citizen, though he may be a railway-
man first and a Labour-man second. But if his country
has only third place in his heart, it is a very good third.
No patriot is more concerned about production; none was
more distressed by the knowledge that a general railway
strike (apart from the incidental expense of it, chargeable to
the community) was likely to arrest the process of national
revival, dislocate every industry except that of the agitator,
and bring the State to the very verge of bankruptcy. If,
then, he elected to set the immediate claims of a class
against the future welfare of the nation, it is clear that the
motives which actuated him must have been very lofty and
of a strangely compelling force.
It may be that the strike has gone far to alienate the
growing sympathies of the public and to set back the fulfil-
ment of the hopes of Labour some twenty years, but that
is not the fault of Didymus. It is due to a misunderstanding
of his motives, insidiously fostered by the falsehoods eman-
ating from the environs of his friend the PRIME MINISTER.
In the cause of Truth, for which he has a confirmed regard,
Didymus is prepared to expose those falsehoods. And for
this purpose he is happy in enjoying the gift of fluent
speech. Gentle or menacing, as the occasion demands,
his style has of late, through close association with the
President of the N.U.R., become perhaps a little cramped,
but it is still persuasive. He greatly prefers arguments
to threats. This trait indeed is very characteristic of him.
He probably has more power in his little finger than any
man extant to-day. Thanks to the terrific potentialities of
the machinery which he controls (for Didymus disclaims
all personal credit for his power) he has but to apply that
little finger to a button —and keep it there—to throw the
entire nation into a state of paralysis. But, if he has a
giant's strength, he declines to use it like a giant. Time
after time, he assures us, he refused the offer of a general
strike of all the Unions: he was determined not to utilise
this deadly instrument unless he really wanted it.
Of a most accommodating disposition, the friendships of
Didymus are marked by a rare catholicity, and he would be
hard put to it to say which he loves best, the Government
or the Extremists of his own party. His tenderness of
heart is such that he would not willingly injure a beetle;
but when it came to a question of dealing a knock-out
blow to the nation or risking the loss of his job he had to
be firm. Didymus would do anything rather than sacrifice
his power for good. Such a temperament wins affection
in turn, and he is greatly beloved by those whose wages he
gets raised. The higher he gets them raised the greater
becomes his popularity. This system is known as “the
sliding scale,” and everybody must sympathise with his
natural anxiety that it should only slide one way.
Finally Didymus bears his defeat (if I may use so
abrupt a word) with the same perfect self-restraint which
he exhibited while organising the attempted starvation of
the community; and in his modest way he is content to
regard it as tantamont to a triumph.
P.S.—One further and very touching revelation of the
man's character. Even as I write, a deputation of the Par-
liamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress (of
which he is an ornament) is closeted with the PRIME MINIs.
TER, urging that the mines should be placed under the control
of a Government already exhausted with controlling the
railways. Didymus is not there. He is taking a rest, and
giving the Government a chance. This shows a generous
and forgiving nature. O. S.
“A simpler, but not so accurate, explanation is that, whereas in full
compression the work done in compressing the charge (if a charge
existed) is regained by that compressed charge forcing the piston down
with a reduced 'compression,' the compressed charge has lost its com-
pression at the top of the stroke.”—From a letter in “Motor Cycling.”
Even now we seem to detect a certain lack of lucidity,
probably due to over-compression. -

BACK TO THE NORMAL AFTER THE STRIKE.
A TRACEDY OF THE TELEPHONE.
“TELEPHONE 2'' said the man in the
District Contract Office incredulously.
“You want a telephone put into your
new flat 2 How long have you got it
for 2 Three years; is that all? Well,
I'll take your order if you like, but—
Are you thinking of renewing your
lease ?”
It was in April, in the early halcycon
days of demobilisation and before the
horrors wrought by the War had really
been brought home to me, that I had
the temerity to demand a telephone on
no other pretext than that I wanted
one and was prepared to pay for it.
“Do you see that ?" continued the
local officer, pointing proudly to an
enormous pile of MSS. about the size
of a year's output of CHARLES GARVICE.
“That's this week's list of people who
want telephones. And that's names
only, mark you; we keep the addresses
in another office; it makes more of
a system keeping the addresses separ-
ately, you know.”
There the matter might have ended
had not my wife heard from a friend of
a friend (who was a friend of another
friend who heard about it first) that
a man who lived at Croydon had
managed to get a telephone, by sheer
persistence, after about a month.
Now it is the invariable rule amongst
good men and true that if a woman
looks into your eyes with a glance full
of meaning, and tells you somebody
else's husband has been able to do some-
thing which you have not accomplished,
it has simply got to be done.
Through May and June I remained
in my trenches, merely carrying on de-
sultory paper warfare, small raids to
see if the same enemy was still in oc-
cupation, harassing fire with a light
type - writer and occasional five-page
bombardments with one of heavy calibre
on suspected tender spots.
The answers were inexorable when
they came, which was not often. There
was not room on the whole telephone
system for another syllable. Moreover,
they gave me to understand that if they
risked another subscriber the whole
of the telephonic conversation of the
country would inevitably coalesce, and
all the words run into one another in
one stupendous conglomeration.
Petrified by the prospect of such a
national calamity I should have given
in had not the administrative side of
the Home Staff sent frequent reminders
at breakfast: “Reference my M.G.
(Meaning Glance) 746.9/7 of the 15th
ult. I note that the telephone has not
yet been installed. Please treat this
matter as urgent—or I shall eat your
butter ration while you are out.”
Spurred on to renewed effort I sought
out, with considerable misgivings, the
chief office, the very fountain-head of
supplies. My old British warm went
with me in case I should come across
an odd instrument lying about the place.
“You see,” said the kindly authority
to whom I was finally punted, “even I
myself am doing without one.” This im-
pressed me no more than if I had heard
of a doctor who refused to take his own
medicine. Resolutely I indicated the
telephone directory. Eighty per cent.
of those people, I said, had been allowed
to play with the telephone all during
the War; seventy-nine per cent. had
complained. My patience, on the other
hand, was inexhaustible. They could
give me the wrong number every time,
instead of every other time, if they
liked. I would be satisfied if they
would let me have an instrument and
make it buzz a little at times.

he said; “there isn't room on the ex-
change."
I disclaimed all preference for any
one exchange. Couldn't they find room
on another? Couldn't they give me
a trunk line only, say a far-off place
like Cardiff, so that once on the line
I could get a through connection back
to the City? A great bitterness over-
took me when he refused even this
concession. What about the profiteer
who had about seventeen 2 Couldn't
I be allowed to slip in on some pretext,
whip up one and carry it away if it
showed no signs of use 2 Here I indi-
cated my British warm, which was
oppressing me sadly since the temper-
ature was eighty-four in the shade.
The suggestion was not without
effect. As I reached the street I had
the uncomfortable feeling that I was
being watched.
In August I became pitiful. No
accused doomed to die for the crime of
another ever pleaded his cause more
eloquently. Tolstoy's plays seemed
redolent of hilarity compared with
the gloom and disaster which over-
shadowed my household. In vain I
pleaded that life without a telephone
was unbearable; that the doctor was
likely to be required urgently at any
moment; that destructive fires were
imminent; that my business was at a
standstill—did they realise that ? As
an author of unproduced plays, how
was it possible for me to carry on iſ
Mr. CochRAN was unable to ring up and
settle terms for any one of the two
hundred and twenty-nine plays with
which he had been bombarded ?
I got no reply; no satisfaction even,
except that the local district man took
to bringing his wife to the office with
him for protection.
In September, however, I changed
my tactics and took the field as an
outraged British warrior. The nation,
I wrote, had revolted before at the idea
of her soldiers begging in the streets,
yet here was I, together with my en-
tire family, destitute of the necessary
powers of communication and all means
of earning a living. Was this a nation's
gratitude” But for me (and a few mil-
lion others) we should have been under
the heel of the Prussian by now. I no
longer desired to plead; I demanded
my rights. I understood that people
who had a telephone were allowed to
transfer it. Very well, I claimed that
right. At my country's call I had re-
linquished my old telephone at The
Whortleberries, Finchley, in 1914. No
sensible person, of course, expected an
entirely new telephone; all I asked
was that my old telephone, Number
9998 Finchley, should be transferred to
me. If they would do this I should

phrase “wiping a joint.” Smith, a

and the other a mere copy. State,

Countess is entitled to a return of the
money; (b) What are her chances of
getting it 2
(3) A., a conscientious grocer, exhibits
for sale on his premises a box of hen-
fruit or cluckberries, labelled simply
“Eggs.” B., a professor of cytology,
purchases one for 5%d. and takes it
home for his tea. It is not in fact eat-
able, and B. sues A. for a return of the
purchase price. A. testifies that what
he sold B. was what it purported to be,
viz. an egg; that he did not represent
it as new-laid or fresh, or in fact as
eatable at all; that B. did not explain
at the time of the transaction that he
His Lordship pleased; that as between
grocer and public it must be construed
as meaning “an egg fit to eat.” Even
if the Court did not accept this restricted
view it could not possibly be held that
a spheroid cretaceous receptacle full of
sulphuric acid gas constituted an egg.
How should the judge decide the case?

answer as satisfactory 2

[Author of “A Fortnight,” “Basement

ments to “The Ladies' Field.”]
To My FRIEND Z-Thinking how in
the late heat wave we have all been
literally in the melting-pot has made
me reflect on quantities of things other
than ourselves in connection with the
melting-pot. Ourselves have emerged
unchanged. But the other things 2
No | The British Matron, par eremple.
Did she not long ago slip into the
melting-pot, Z, with her moral bonnet,
her virtuous mantle, her shocked ex-
pression and many disapprovals, her
narrow views, voluminous skirts and
unguessed at ankles—to emerge with
bobbed hair, a glad eye, feet jhat fox-
trot, and views as broad as her twenty-
inch-long-skirt is narrow?
Then the Victorian novel. That
strange old volume—or was it three
volumes 2—the result of a Victorian
mind driving a Victorian pen, in which
the heroine was all blushes and inno-
cence and ignorance, and never even
faintly imagined Cupid without a ring
and a licence in his hand ' That old
novel went long since into the melting-
pot, did it not, Z 2 And has come out
again, as-well, shall we say my Fort-
might, or Basement Bargains 2
Even marriage itself seems to be
sliding into that melting-pot. Do you
weep for that, or do you rejoice, my
friend Z 2 I should rejoice that any-
thing so stodgy and Victorian was
on the move. Yes, but as a novelist
I should weep. For how could one
put any interest into a novel without
the Eternal Triangle? And does not
the base of that always fascinating
geometrical figure rest on marriage 2
I think the Cabinet, with the Bishops
to help them, might take the marriage
problem in hand and try to find a solu-
tion, such as making marriage a lease-
hold instead of a freehold. You know,
my friend Z, how houses are taken on
a three, five or seven years' agreement?
Well, like that. But there's one thing
that will never, never, never be threat-
ened by melting-pots and change of
fashion, isn't there 2 Love! Passion-
ate, purple, perſumed, exotic, iridescent
Love! How little the poor home-bound
Grundy-ridden Sunday-at-Home-and-
Good-Words-reading girloſ the Victorian
era was allowed to know of Love com-
pared with the girl of to-day, who can
get down my Fortnight and Basement
Bargains from the special shelf of books
which Grandmamma isn't allowed to
touch.
And now let us switch our reflections
off to metempsychosis. You are not,
like me, a believer in it, are you, Z2
I went to an interesting dinner the
other night, where we were all metem-
psychosis people. We are all agreed
that we've been all sorts of creatures
as well as human beings. Also we're
all agreed that there were far more
thrills in being a bird or a beast than
in being a person. A pretty and pop-
ular girl present was being chaffed by
her dinner-partner about her many
flirtations. “And do you find it a
satisfying amusement 2" he asked her.
“Yes, it's pretty good fun,” she said.
“But,” she added, gazing with wide
dreamy eyes at the lamp on the table,
“I can recall flirtations that make my
present ones—oh, less than nothing !
I can remember in the sweet old past,
when I was a white Persian pussy,
sitting on a garden-wall in the moon-
light, looking down at a semi-circle of
fiercely - gleaming, terrifyingly ardent
eyes on the gravel-walk below, and all
my present experiences are mere pale
shadows compared with that one.”
We all agreed that she was perfectly
right.
I know that when I was a bird the
mingled joy and terror of the snake's
gaze was a bigger sensation than I've
ever had in this karma. And when I
was a snake — oh, the rapture of love
and cruelty as I drew my little helpless
victim down to me!
I hope I've given you some thrills, Z,
and that you will join the metem-
psychosis people. Good-bye.

MORE WAR REVELATIONS.
THE TRUTH ABOUT No. 5 PLATOON.
[Being an extract from the sort of review we
may expect if the fashion of writing candid
war-histories spreads downwards.]
IN his new book, Four Years of It,
the author, Corporal Bloggins, of “B”
Company, 20th Loamshire Battalion,
has given us a most illuminating story
of the Great War. His style is terse
and lucid and his meaning is nearly
always unmistakable.
The author is quite aware that he
is risking censure by his outspoken
criticism of other men in No. 5 Platoon,
but, as he aptly remarks in a very can-
did preface, he has now received his
gratuity, so there is no longer any need
to keep silence. Once or twice he even
feels it his duty to cast his net of criti-
cism wider, and in chapter vi. his re-
marks on the Colonel's dispositions for
the attack at Arras are very instructive.
The Colonel, it seems, put “B” Com-
pany on the left flank, which was known
to be a heavily-shelled area. Corporal
Bloggins is justifiably bitter about this,
and the matter seems to us to call for
some explanation.
At last we get the full story of the
author's famous argument with the
Regimental Sergeant-Major in 1917.
The immediate result of this at the
time was that Corporal Bloggins was
temporarily reduced to the ranks; but
from his account of it here he seems
to have had distinctly the best of the
argument. It would not be fair to
form a final judgment until we get the
Sergeant-Major's version of this inci-
dent—and we understand that he will
deal with it in his forthcoming volume,
The Recent Quarrel and my Share in it.
Another very intriguing passage deals
with the Battle of Messines. • The inci-
dent where the author told his platoon
Sergeant to “shut his mouth,” as he
(the author) wished to hear the mines
go up, is told with dramatic vigour.
We think ourselves that Corporal Blog.
gins was justified. Platoon-sergeants
have no right to be eating biscuits at
such a moment.
But the whole book is full of pointed
criticism and snappy anecdote and will
well repay reading, as the criticism is
often helpful both for officers and men.
For instance, the author makes legiti-
mate complaint of his having to go up
the line three nights in succession in
January, 1918, with a working-party.
There certainly seems scope here for
an inquiry. It is not as though the
weather was at all fine at that time;
on the contrary, it was distinctly in-
clement. -
But perhaps the chief charm of this
book is its open and racy description
of the personalities and inner life of
No. 5 Platoon. Libellous it may be,
but it has the supreme merits of truth-
fulness and simplicity. The passion of
Private Sikes for getting up a game of
poker on pay-day and his singular good
luck at all card games; the peculiar
good fortune of Corporal Smith, a bro-
ther of the well-known Quartermaster-
Sergeant, in the matter of blankets when
in rest billets; the fierce arguments as
to who was actually nearest when a
Minnie dropped in the trench in March,
1917; and the homely joys of the es-
taminet at Bully-Grenay—all these are
set down with a fine impartial vigour.
The only regret we have in reading
this book is that the author is so inter-
ested in the doings of No. 5 Platoon
that he only gives a line or two to the
action in which he captured a German
machine-gun and won his Military
Medal. But even as it is the book is
bound to give rise to much discussion
and may even lead to several letters in
our columns from the many soldiers
mentioned in its pages. We hope so.

TRAVELLING BY WEIGHT.
[It is rumoured that one of the first steps to be taken by Sir ERIC GEDDEs, as Minister of Transport, will be to correct the
grave injustice by which a fragile spinster of seven stone weight is charged at the same rate as a bloated profiteer of seventeen
stone; and that an ukase will be issued requiring all passengers to pay by weight at a uniform charge of one penny per pound
for every hundred miles. Our artist has here depicted some of the far-reaching consequences of this drastic reform.]

WHAT OUR PRELATES HAVE TO PUT UP WITH.
Young Lady. “AND ARE You PREACHING AGAIN To-DAY.”
Hardworked Bishop. “YEs." Young Lady. “How TERRIBLE | "
AMIBITION.
(Thoughts at Victoria Station.)
Charles, when we both of us were young and green,
Susceptible to hints from every quarter,
Our faces not particularly clean,
Our passions fearful though our pants were shorter,
One hope in life we had on growing big
(More glorious even than to slay the pig)—
We wanted to be just like Mr. Higg; .
That was the vision, shining and serene—
To be a station porter.
They turned us from it. When with jocund noise
We strove to ape the methods of the master,
And heaped the schoolroom sofa high with toys
And pulled it up and down and broke a castor,
And banged the nursery door, and piloted
Imaginary milk-cans overhead,
People were angry, and Aunt Mary said,
“Thunder again, or can it be the boys?
There goes a lump of plaster.”
She used to rap our heads; she used to say,
Pointing to busts of senators and scholars—
The beetling temples garlanded with bay,
The Norman profile, the peculiar collars—
“Sit down, you imps, and read a story, do;
Not by rampaging up and down like you
(Your uncle Herbert has a headache too)
Such men as these won plaudits in their day
And earned no end of dollars.”
What happened,Charles? We stood and sucked our thumbs,
Our earliest dreams were all too soon forgotten;
We took to Caesar and to doing sums,
The net result of which was simply rotten;
Little it profited to toil, to doubt,
Instead of pushing table legs about ;
The garlands on our heads refused to sprout,
And I am writing any bosh that comes
And you are broking cotton.
So ill a thing it is to quench a star,
So much we suffer from our elders' follies;
The gleam was there—it beckoned from afar;
But for that fatal error of Aunt Polly's
We might be rich, we might be famous now,
As very likely in the recent row
The hero Higg was famous; anyhow
We might be members of the N.U.R.
And trundling loaded trollies.
That is the point; despite our tender age
We knew the kingly way; not ours the onus
If we have faltered in life's pilgrimage,
But theirs who did their utmost to dethrone us.
Such thoughts as these must give us, Charles, the pip
Whilst happy railway porters round us trip,
Still asking the unalterable tip,
Still clutching the inviolable wage,
Including the war-bonus.

SECOND THOUGHTS.
FIELD-MARSHAL Sir EDMUND ALLEN-
BY's frank admission that he was re-
jected in the examination for the Indian
Civil Service has excited a good deal of
comment, mainly on “blessing-in-dis-
guise” lines. Instances of these false
starts are by no means so unusual as
people might suppose. The real tragedy
of modern life is to be found in the careers
of many public characters who, though
they may have attained to a certain
degree of eminence, have sacrificed or
postponed the development of their true
genius. Examples might be multiplied
indefinitely, but we can only confine
ourselves to a few of the more poignant
illustrations of this waste of talent,
culled for the most part from authori-
tative books of reference.
Perhaps the most striking instance
of all is that of Lord FISHER, who,
entering the Navy in the year 1854,
only discovered his true vocation as a
journalist sixty-five years later. It is
true that he is making up for lost time
with splendid energy, but still for more
than half a century he gave up to the
Navy what was meant for mankind.
The case of Lord BIRKENHEAD is per-
haps even more pathetic. His true
bent was towards literary criticism, as
is sufficiently shown by his masterly
study in Chambers' Encyclopædia on
the poems of SAMUEL JoHNSoN, an
author with whose rugged personality
he has always had a close affinity. But
a conflicting passion for International
Law, not promptly checked, soon sapped
his intellect, and before many years
elapsed he had sacrificed all forms of
recreation to the writing of arid articles
in The Law Quarterly Review.
The case of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT
affords a curious contrast. Legal studies
preoccupied him in early manhood, and
a great career at the Bar was open to
him when, in the words of Who's Who,
“he abandoned the law in 1893 to be-
come assistant-editor of Woman.” But
Mr. BENNETT is still a young man,
though not so young as Lord BIRKEN-
HEAD, and we may say of him (with a
slight adaptation of the Latin tag), Si
fortuna volet fies de rhetore juder.
Sir OLIVER LODGE, it will be re-
membered, for many years harboured
the ambition of achieving distinction as
a serious man of science, and was so
far successful that he attained to the
position of President of the British
Association. It was only comparatively
late in life that he discovered that the
word Physics (a science to which he
had devoted so many years of patient
research) by a slight rearrangement of
the letters composing it and the ad-
dition of another “c,” could be resolved
into Psychics; and transferred his atten-
tion to a more congenial field of study.
The fact that he was simultaneously
discovered by Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE
greatly facilitated this epoch-making
transition.
The career of Mr. C. B. CochRAN,
again, is a notable example of the tardy
realisation of an early and long-cher-
ished ambition. It was his youthful
aspiration to enter the Diplomatic ser-
vice, but obstacles intervened. He was
obliged to introduce IBSEN to New
York and HACKENscHMIDT to London.
But in the long run patient merit was
rewarded, and, though never officially
employed by the Foreign Office, he
now controls the Ambassadors Theatre.

NEMESIS.
An Episode of the Railway Strike.
OUR train had been quiescent for
some hours, a specimen train in a large
glass case of a junction. A patriarch
of benign aspect appeared to be in
charge and him we accosted for the
tenth time.
“Any word of a move?” we asked.
“That there ain’t,” he replied, smil-
ing cheerfully.
He indicated a morose individual
sitting on a trunk.
“You see that gentleman over there,”
he remarked (he had been a railwayman
in the days when passengers were
“gentlemen”)—“'im with the luggage
and all? 'E's been 'ere since seven this
morning, waiting for a connection.”
“Has he?” said we.
“Ah, so 'e 'as,” replied the patriarch
and continued on his way. We re-
lapsed into brown studies, with the
exception of my vis-à-vis, who had not
ceased to smile since we pulled up.
Catching his eye I hitched my face in
sickly response.
“You find circumstances depress-
ing?” he remarked. “So do I. I was
smiling not so much in the present as
in the past.”
Those funny stories about people
with a delay-action sense of humour
occurred to me.
“The past,” he continued, smiling
proudly, “ of pomp and circumstance,
of crosses and medals and insignia of
rank, keen brains and brave men.”
I recognised the sort of past.
“Always in the midst of these big
things moved a figure with scarlet and
gold facings, receiving all men's hom-
age, living in an atmosphere of clicking
heels. Generals were chatty with him,
and ordinary beings felt weak in the
knees as he approached. He was the
lord of many cars and always travelled
in two, one for himself and one for his
flask and gas-helmet. His breast was
prismatic with the Orders which foreign
Powers rushed to bestow upon him.
They seemed to like doing it. He had
so many medals pinned on that he had
to go into hospital with General's Chest.
Wherever he went sentries slapped,
not once, as for common folk, but three
times. " You may have seen such
things?”
“Yes,” I replied, “I was one of the
slappers.”
“He interviewed foreigners and sub-
ordinates with that ready tact and
ability to get under the skin of another
race which is an Englishman's birth-
right. I can see him now, turning to
a lesser Olympian and saying, “What
on earth is he gabbling about 2" or
“Well, tell him I can't do anything,”
as the case might be.”
He seemed to puff his chest as he
talked.
“And then, his duty done, his end
accomplished, he returned home, this
simple soldier, a Cincinnatus to his
plough. His country awarded him one
of the few decorations he had not
already received—Doggett's Coat and
Badge, shall we say? He found room
for the ribbon next to the Lone Star of
Los Angeles conferred upon him by the
State of California. And so he lays
aside the steel waistcoat of the warrior
for the dickey of a private gentleman.”
Well-earned contentment, satisfied
ambition seemed to gleam in his eyes.
“Truly, Sir,” I said, “you may well
be proud. Such a past as yours - ?
“Oh, it's not mine,” he interrupted
hastily; “you don't seem to have caught
the idea.”
“Not yours?” I replied.

“It belongs to that gentleman sitting
on the trunk over there.”

THE COLONEL'S KIT.
Now that we have returned from
North Russia and can judge details of
the expedition from a detached and im-
partial standpoint, it is time to make
public the fact that the best dressed
man in the Archangel Force was
Colonel Fitznash. Honour to whom
honour is due. In his natural state
Fitznash is a perfectly good cavalry-
man, but on the Dvina he was attached
to the Corps of Gondoliers, and man-
fully shared their hardships and perils
at the Base and in the bogs, by river
and by road. However he was circum-
stanced, with whatever element he
contended, his accoutrements were ap-
propriate. One day he might be seen
at the Base, polished and glittering, a
model of conventional turn-out; the
the Intelligence Officer, Ust-Mekh-
renga, and with an escort of one full
private popped on a steamer thither
bound. On the same day Fitznash,
who was further up the river, received
instructions to proceed to the Base.
This meant a voyage vià Ust-Mekh-
renga.
True to his principles, he thought
first of his Base outfit, and sent Private
Pavlov in advance to convey it to Ust-
Mekhrenga and there await his arrival.
At the boat's last stop before Ust-
Mekhrenga, Pavlov met friends and
went ashore to drink tea with them.
During his absence the Bolo prisoner
came on board and the steamer pushed
off. So the Intelligence Officer who
met it at its destination found aboard a
Bolo prisoner addressed to him, also a
kit-bag and a large uniform case.
But next day there arrived, by rou-
tine boat, at Ust-Mekhrenga one Private
Pavlov, asking in decrepit English for
his master's kit, the kit of Colonel
Fitznash. When, how, with whom
was it supposed to have reached Ust-
Mekhrenga? On the tug yesterday,
with the Bolo prisoner.
With a gleeful eye—for he had re-
ceived no perquisite—the Naval Trans-
port Officer led Pavlov to the Intelli-
gence quarters. There, intelligibly
eloquent in his own tongue, the latter
made evident the truth of his story.
Fitznash was known to be terrible
when roused and to hold the strings of
retribution in his grip, and he was due
at any hour. So there was another
gathering of the friends of Intelligence
—a gathering confidentially convened.
He who came in the glory of his new
next on a barge, wear-
ing a pea-jacket and a
pair of the much-adver-
tised patent “Barge-
boots for Brigadiers; ”
the next, driving in a
droshky in one of those
droshky outfits speci-
ally designed for mem-
bers of the Relief Force;
and the next, labouring
through a mosquito-
misted morass in a sty-
lish net and an exquis-
itely cut pair of sponge-
bags. Whatever he
wore it was perfect of
its kind. This scrupu-
lous regard for appear-
ance Fitznash regarded
as simple loyalty to his
old regiment. He car-
ried it so far that, when
advised by a friend to

slacks departed in his
old; underwear, ties,
socks, handkerchiefs—
all were shed in hurried
shame - faced secrecy.
The kitbag and the
great suit-case were has-
tily repacked and de-
livered to Pavlov, who
heaved them on a
droshky and drove off
to meet his master.
And now at last
Colonel Fitznash, read-
ing this, may know the
truth, and modify his
estimate of Private
Pavlov's incapacity as
a kit-packer.

of application for a Russian decoration

tainable at the Base, he refused on the
grounds that none of the fashionable
ribbons suited his complexion.
There is now no reason why Colonel
Fitznash should remain in ignorance
of his narrowest escape—an escape
from the humiliation of returning to
the Base without any kit but his com-
bined bog and battle outfit. The re-
trospective shock may do him good.
The story will at least explain to him
the woefully bad packing of the kit he
picked up at Ust-Mekhrenga, on his
way to the Base, for which he has
hitherto blamed his bat-boy, Private
Pavlov of the Slavo-British Legion.
Amongst a bunch of Bolos captured
one day up the river there was one so
much fatter than the rest that it was
obvious he was a Commissar, or head-
man. He was therefore addressed to
Summoning his braves, he had cap-
tive and kit transported to his quarters
for examination. Things looked black
for the Bolo, thus associated with a
quantity of obviously selected British
officer's kit; but however dark the story
of its acquisition it might as well be
put to a good use.

I THINK there can be nothing much more fair
Than owning some large mansion in the shires,
And living almost permanently there,
In constant touch with animals and squires;
Yet there is joy in peering through the gates
Or squinting from the summit of a wall
At other people's beautiful estates,
Wondering what they have to pay in rates
And coveting it all.
Yes, it is sweet to circle with one's spouse
Some antique Court, constructed by QUEEN ANNE,
Complete with oaks and tennis-courts and cows,
And many a nice respectful serving-man,
With dogs and donkeys and perhaps a swan,
And lovely ladies having such a time,
And garden-parties always going on,
And ruins where the guide-book says KING John
Did nearly every crime.
Yes, it is sweet; but what I want to know
Is why one has to prowl about outside;
Surely the Earl of Bodleton and Bow,
Surely Sir Egbert and his lovely bride
Should wait all eager in the entrance-way
To ask us in and take us through the grounds,
And give one food and worry one to stay,
Instead of simply keeping one at bay
With six or seven hounds.
Surely they realise one wants to see
The mullioned windows in the South-West wing,
The private trout-stream and the banyan-tree,
The lilac bedroom where they lodged the King;
Surely they know how Bolshevist we feel
Outside, where shrubberies obstruct the view,
Particularly as they scarce conceal
The Earl and household at a hearty meal
Under the old, old yew.
I do not grudge the owner of The Chase;
I do not loathe the tenant of The Lea;
I only want to walk about his place
And just imagine it belongs to me;
That is the kind of democratic sport
For keeping crime and Bolshevism low;
I don't imagine that the fiercest sort
Feel quite so anarchist at Hampton Court,
Where anyone may go.
But I dare say that many a man must take
Long looks of wonderment at Number Nine,
Laburnum Avenue, and vainly ache
To go inside a dwelling so divine;
And if indeed some Marquis knocks one day
And says, “I'm tired of standing in the street;
I want to see your mansion, if I may,”
I shall receive him in the nicest way
And show him round my “seat.” A. P. H.

338 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[OCTOBER 15, 1919.
OTHER CLAIMANTS,
IT may not be generally known that
an overflow Court sat last week to hear
the evidence of various non-military
persons in connection with the origin
and development of that mysterious
vehicle, the Tank, whose birth is wrapt
up in so much obscurity.
For some reason or other the pro-
ceedings were not reported in the press.
In some cases, perhaps, the “Fathers” of
the various “Chapels” took exception;
but in those newspaper offices where pa-
tristic remonstrance is flouted we must,
of course, seek other explanations. Be
the cause what it may Mr. Punch is
enabled to stand alone in his account
of this very remarkable gathering—a
journalistic scoop indeed.
The Chairman (Lord SYDENHAM) be-
gan by pointing out the extremedelicacy
of the test before the Court, since,
although it had been shown elsewhere
to be hard enough to prove that anyone
invented the Tank, it was infinitely
harder to prove that anyone didn't.
He himself, for example, would defy
the most ingenious counsel to demon-
strate that his (the speaker's) own
brain was innocent of the feat. Since
no one knows what he can do till he
tries, it follows that the invention of the
Tanks might be within the scope of all.
But who was the guilty party—he
meant who was the responsible party 2
That was what they were there to as-
certain. Anyone might have done it,
but who was it 2 That was the question.
Immediately the Chairman had ceased
Lord Fish ER leapt to his feet and said
that he demanded to be heard first, and
that nobody should be allowed to dam
the flow of his oratory. It was idle,
he contended, to listen to any other
claimant because there could be no
possible doubt as to his own status in
the matter. No one who had read his
recent letters and articles in The Times
could doubt his title to the honour.
The Chairman here interposed to say
that, although they had all read and
doubtless relished Lord FISHER's joyous
excursions into print, he could not, for
one, recollect any reſerence in them to
the matter before the meeting. Lord
FISHER's services to the Navy, and to his
country through the Navy, were a thing
apart. What they were now met for was
to discover the inventor of the Tank.
The following dialogue then ensued:–
Lord FishBR (with his hand to his
ear). “Inventor of the what?”
The Chairman. “Tank.”
Lord FISHER. “Tank be d–d.
I thought you wanted to know who
was the inventor of swank.” -
Order having been restored, Sir
ARTHUR PINERO, who was next called,
said that he had been summoned
there under what seemed to be some
official misconception. He had never
laid claim to have invented the Tank;
what he invented was Mrs. Tanqueray.
But the departmental mind was liable
to confusion.
The Chairman expressed his regret
that the dramatist's valuable time
should have been thus wasted, and Sir
ARTHUR left the court without a stain
on his character and hurried home to
disinter some more old plays for fresh
Berryal at the Adelphi.
Sir E. RAY LANKESTER said that in
his capacity as a naturalist and bio-
logist he had met some thousands
of caterpillars, many of which he had
opened and dissected, but none of them
had delivered up the secret of the Tank.
In his opinion, if the caterpillar were,
as had often been stated, the parent
of the Tank, the relationship was un-
conscious. It was a wise Tank that
knew its own father.
Professor FINNEY said that he was at
a loss to understand how the Tank was
a matter for such excitement at this
moment. It merely showed again that
nothing was really new, but that fashions
moved in circles. At the Royal Aquari-
um in England's palmiest days—he was
speaking of the glorious seventies—his
Tank and his performances in it had
a world-wide reputation.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw said that he also
was not there to claim the invention.
Anyone who cared to give his mind to
such rubbish could invent a Tank, and a
much better one than those in question.
He was there to say that he personally
believed in ideas as the best munitions,
not perhaps during war, but as a pre-
ventive of war. So long as he was
allowed his high thinking, no drinking,
no meat and a little Jazz, he grudged
no Tank-inventor his fortune.
Sir SQUIRE BANCROFT said that he
was not there to pretend to the glory
of having invented Tanks, but to con-
fer upon those marvellous engines of
warſare the modest meed of his esteem.
He considered them to symbolise the
greatness and the irresistible energy of
England, and, by way of his own tribute
to their worth, he had made an effort to
take out letters patent to change his
name to Tankcroft in their honour, but
had been restrained by a deputation
of fellow actors, who kindly but firmly
protested that the profession could not
permit him to confuse his identity.
Mr. BottomLEY was just beginning
to demonstrate how he had evolved the
Tanks from his own massive brain when
a message from the other and more
regular Court of Inquiry arrived to say
that the matter had been settled and
the award made.
THE PEACEMAKER.
UP to this point we had been ambling
along pleasantly enough, appreciating
more the charms of the country than
the horse-power of the car that we had
contrived to borrow on the strength of
a highly-coloured account of James's
prowess in the MotorTransport service.
Not but what he made a perfectly effi-
cient O.C. Spare Parts, as far as that
goes. -
We had just passed a picturesque
little church nestling in a clump of trees
(and incidentally also in my native
village), and in a forgetful moment I
had remarked that it was the smallest
church in England.
I ought to have remembered the risk
Iran. Architecture is one of the things
James takes very seriously—the others
are breakfast, eurhythmics, lunch, tariff
reform and dinner—and he at once
stated that, on the contrary, the smallest
church in England was that of his old
home, Multum Parva.
I cannot claim any real enthusiasm
for architecture, though I sympathise
with James in three of his five other
interests; but I yield to no man in local
patriotism. I would do anything to
enhance the fame of my native village
(except live in it), and I grew lyrical
over the microscopic church of Burn-
ham-in-the-Beck. It was, I concluded,
too small to swing a cat in.
“Is swinging cats one of the rites of
your denomination or a privilege of the
|reemen of the hamlet 2" asked James
in his nastiest voice but one, and went
on to floor me with figures.
“Only 30 ft. x 12 ft.,” he declared.
“I measured it myself.”
“Mine is 31 ft. × 13 ft.,” I countered;
“but the local linen-draper measured it.
Deduct the width of his thumb from
every yard and—”
“Bah!” said James in his nastiest
voice, and he opened her out, or what-
ever it is one does to convey the im-
pression that one does not care if
police traps are as thick as autumn—
ou know what I mean.
Our bad tempercontinued throughout
lunch, which we took at Monken Mel-
combe. In gloomy silence we paid our
bill. In silent gloom we were preparing
to re-start when the local archaeologist
came along the street. A charming
old boy, as afterwards appeared at the
inquest, he raised his hat and said:—
“Wouldn't you gentlemen like to
pause five minutes and see our church
—the smallest in England 2"
Over his inanimate body James and
I forgot our quarrel. I am proud to
think that it was I who struck the
first blow. Burnham-in-the-Beck for
ever !

JUST As I was FEELING THE BENEFIT of THE WALKING ExERCISE.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Munic goes to the Front (MILLs AND Boon) is a col-
lection of odd-length pieces by your old-established favour-
ites, the WILLIAMsons, C. N. and A. M. The first and
much the best of these (stories, not authors) records a visit
to the French Front by a party consisting of a distinguished
English lady-novelist (to whom you may fit an original at
discretion), her son and secretary, and a charming belle
Américaine whose part is to obtain cars, wheedle permis-
sions, dazzle authorities and generally heap coals of fire
upon the austere head of the famous lady, who hates to be
beholden to her. All I have to say of this affair is that if
the plot (no great matter—even the Mina disappointed my
expectations by not turning out to be anybody sensational)
reflects an actual tour, this must certainly have been a
wonderful and unusual experience, admirably reproduced
here. If not, then one or both of the clever writers has
a first-class imagination for forbidden lands. The luncheon
at Verdun (no less!) is a rare adventure, told with excellent
spirit. I wish I could use anything like the same kind of
praise for the other pieces in the volume. One of them is
a comedy of exchanged identities, amusing enough till the
complications become too complex; another tells of an
elaborate kidnapping of the German Governor of Belgium
by means of a fake film company (concerning which one
is haunted by the spoil-sport reflection that it did not
in fact happen), and for make-weight there are some
wildly preposterous short stories belonging, all too obvi-
ously, to the cinema that screeneth a multitude of absurd-
ities. I feel bound to add that our WILLIAMsons must
be a little more careful of their deserved reputation for art,
as against this quite unworthy nonsense, into which I
fear they have been betrayed before.
Before the War Mr. (now Captain) DESMOND Coke
held a distinguished position as one of our best inter-
preters of school-boyhood; it is pleasant to find from
Youth, Youth ! (CHAPMAN AND HALL) that the pursuit of
arms has left his quality in this respect unimpaired. Of
the dozen tales in this volume most, though personally
new to me, have, I believe, seen publication before; here,
however, they have for the first time the advantage of a
generous profusion of illustrations in the best manner of
Mr. H. M. BRock, of whom also it might be said that he
enjoys the rare faculty of being able to put a real boy upon
paper. As for Captain CoRE's youths, perhaps you know
already the vitality of them; it remains as delightfully
true as ever, equally remote from the sentimental anaemia
of Victorian make-believe, and from the rather catch-penny
“revelations" of some modern realism. Nothing much
happens in the tales themselves: episodes of laughter for
the most part, they yet hold, each of them, some shrewdly
and sympathetically observed instance of boy character.
One certainly, “The Mad English,” my own favourite, is
a little gem of ironical but kindly portraiture. Uncles
and aunts, in view of the coming of Christmas, may
well be grateful that Captain Coke (with him, as they
say, Mr. BRock) has retained so happily the gift of repass-
ing at will the baize door that separates too many of us
from the kingdom of Youth.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is good that a hero should be tall and blond, an
Englishman, a perfect swordsman, and mounted on a black
and splendid steed. It is also a happy thing if you can
put him into a period of history when the suitings of gen-
tlemen were romantic and picturesque. All that can be
done, so to speak, in the twinkling of a pen. But how are
you going to make him fight, for the sake of topical interest,
shoulder to shoulder with the French against Germany ?
That is just where the ingenuity of Mr. MoRICE G1 RARD
comes in. Captain Ivan Brooke, the wooer of the Countess
of Zelle (ODHAMs), was A.D.C. to John CHURCHILL at the
time when that officer assisted TJRENNE a gainst the Im-
perial forces in the Rhineland. And when I add that
give her name here, for you would lose the chance of a lazy
hour's pleasant beguilement if you knew—and I can't help
feeling that Valentine must have got the idea for a very
jolly little comedy out of it all—as well as a charming wife.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw is still at his old work using the jape,
as once the trumpet was used, to sap the walls of Jericho.
Under title Heartbreak House (CoNSTABLE) he offers us six
plays, of which two, The Inca of Perusalem and The Bolshevik
Empress, suggest the cliché that they are not likely to
enhance their author's reputation. Great Catherine has
been seen already and approved on the stage. O'Flaherty,
W.C. is what Mr. SHAw with characteristic audacity calls
in rescuing his lady he was
obliged to leap, on Sultan's
back, a yawning ravine
dared only once before by
horse and man, and sub-
sequently to leap it again
with the Countess also up,
and that circumstances fur-
thermore compelled him to
don the complete mediaeval
armour (including axe, bat-
tle, one) of a former Count
and strike terror into the
hearts of a marauding band,
you will perceive that be-
yond being present at the
battle of Thermopylae or
winning the Grand National
there was little in the heroic
line that he failed to achieve.
He was a fine man, wor, hy
of his broad Yorkshire acres
and the hand of his very
charming Countess. He
also, it appears, made a nota-
ble impression on Madame
DE MAINTF NoN when he
carried despatches to the
Court of Louis THE MAGNI-
FICENT. But when I think
of a certain young Gascon
who arrived in Paris on a
yellow pony and afterwards
kissed the hand of ANNE of
AUSTRIA it takes all the
patriotism that I can mus-
ter to warm me to the ad-
ventures of Captain Brooke.

House is a protracted, dis-
cursive and entirely amus-
ing debate (conducted in a
sort of Shavian asylum) on
ethics, economics, philan-
dering and any old thing.
Few readers of sense and
sensibility could withhold
the tribute of their laughter
and admiration, admiration
qualified by exasperation—
a blend which the malicious
author would particularly
appreciate. Heartbreak
House carries a long preface
which sets everybody right
after putting everybody in

rather glad I am a fool.

story is about a playwright, one Valentine Brook, who, just
as any other playwright might, lent his flat in town to a
friend, and on his return found, which is, of course, not
quite so usual, a strange young lady anxious to recover a
silver bag left there the day before. The strange young lady,
by her equally strange reticences and confessions, rouses
the playwright's suspicions as to the ownership of the bag,
and very soon the story resolves itself into a contest be.

Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front (Con-
STABLE) is a cumbrous title, and I hope that it will not
interfere with the book's success. Mr. E. W. HoRNUNG
worked for some time with the Y.M.C.A. on the Western
Front, and here he relates his experiences very simply and
eloquently. The Rest Hut, in which he started a library,
is vividly described, and the book reflects an abounding
love and admiration for the men whom it was his happiness
to serve. In the chapter, “A Boy's Grave"—no theme
could be more intimate or call for a finer delicacy of touch
—a most tender and moving tribute is paid by the father
to his dead son.

MANY INVENTIONS.
THE Court having settled the question
as to who invented the Tanks (as dis-
tinct from the more trivial question as
to who fought in them) other claims
were then laid before it. -
Miss Letitia Tudberry, The Eyrie,
Walthamstow, claimed to have invented
the first sock-comforter. In October,
1914, she was knitting what was in-
tended to be a pair of socks for a nephew
in the trenches. This was despatched
to him in due course; and a letter re-
ceived later, which thanked her for the
Balaclava helmet and the comforter,
gave her the idea for her great inven-
tion. Evidently the War Office must
have heard of it by some means or
other, for a subsequent letter from her
nephew contained the information
that most of the men in the trenches
were now wearing sock-comforters.—

had been a favourite in his family for
many years before 1914, the younger
Podbys being particularly partial to it.
He had not actually suggested to the
supplied with it, but his wife's cousin,
who sometimes came to tea with them,
| was in the habit of mixing in Society,
and no doubt she had mentioned it to
some of her friends, who had told
'Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL.
There being two thousand other
claimants, the case was adjourned.
Mr. Leonard Limpet, O.B.E., claimed
to have invented the phrase, “Passed
to you, please.” If any one phrase
could be said to have won the War for
England it was this. Without it life
in any great Department would have
been intolerable, and it would have been
utterly impossible for the nation to
have carried on.—Awarded a million
pounds.
Mr. KEATING claimed to have in-
vented Keating's Powder. This, he ad-
mitted, was a somewhat ticklish subject,
but he had felt it to be his duty to put
forward his claim. Nobody would dis-
pute that he had invented the powder
which bore his name, and there would
be as little dispute as to the part it
had played in our great victory. With-
out his powder England could only
have put a scratch army into the field,
and we should undoubtedly have lost
the War.—Awarded a million pounds.
Captain BAIRNSFATHER claimed to
have invented “Old Bill.” It was the
eheerfulness and good-humour of the
private soldier which had pulled us
through, and since nobody expected
modesty in a Court like this, he didn't
mind saying that it was “Old Bill,”
among other things, which had kept
the men cheerful.—Awarded a million
pounds.
Colonel Watt-Watt, C.I.E., claimed
to have invented the R.A.F. uniform
(29th pattern). He admitted that this
pattern had only been in general use
for one day, when it was superseded by
his friend Colonel Tutt-Tutt's design;
but he maintained that it was just
this policy of surprise, of never letting
the enemy know what to expect next,
which had confounded the plans of
LUDENDoRFF and had kept the Germans
guessing.
He also claimed to have invented the
Army Order which forbade officers to
smoke pipes in public, an Order which
had undoubtedly put fresh courage into
the hearts of our Allies and had en-

War Office that the troops should be

a million pounds.
Mr. Tosher, K.C., said that he repre-
sented an elderly wood-cutter in Hol-
land (unfortunately absent),who claimed
to have invented the War. It was ob-
vious that this claim had precedence
over all others, seeing that but for the
War—
The President regretted that he could
not hear Mr. Tosher. In this Court the
claims of patriotic Englishmen only
could be heard, Englishmen who had
not hesitated to offer all, even their
brains, to their country. He was bound
to make this rule, otherwise we should
have German scientists coming over
here and saying that it was they who
had first given the War Office the idea
of employing gas-helmets, and claiming
a reward in consequence.
Mr. SIEGFRIED SAssoon and several
other young poets each claimed to have
invented the word “guts,” or rather to
have been the first poet to recognise
the poetical quality of the word. Poetry
had proved a wonderful inspiration to
the man on the home front, but it was
necessary that the poetry should be writ-
ten in simple stirring lºnglish, and the
discovery of the word “guts” had made
this possible. Combined with “hell”
and “bloody” the effect was irresist-
ible.—Awarded a million pounds each.
Mr. BottomLEY claimed to have in-
vented the comforting news that the
dear boys, Tommy in the trenches
and Jack at sea, God bless 'em, would
end the War by Christmas. (Another
powerful prophecy next Christmas).-
Awarded a million pounds.
Mr. LovaT FRASER claimed to have
braced the nation by saying, in italics,
that, on the contrary, it would last ten
years yet.—Airarded a million pounds.
The President then announced that,
after setting aside a million pounds for
the inventor of plum-and-apple jam,
there was only two-and-ninepence left.
As there were no other claims by in-
ventors, he proposed to divide this
among the infantry. The Court then
adjourned. A. A. M.

THE INCOMPLEAT WANGLER.
IN telling this story I would have it
understood that I am entirely in favour
ef every kindness being shown to the
disabled. Indeed, in my opinion no-
thing is too good for them, and this I
say on general principles and not in
any way because I happen to be one
myself. But even the disabled should
show some reserve; should accept, but
not suggest ; should enjoy, but never
“cadge;” should, in short, be more like
me and less like Ernest. Let me
illustrate my meaning.
We were sitting in the lounge of the
Bellevue Hotel, Ernest and I, when a
woman I had not noticed before came
in and smiled upon Ernest.
“Her name is Mrs. Mottle,” he said
in reply to my inquiry, “and she has a
Rolls-Royce. I had a little conversa-
tion with her yesterday.”
“You would have,” I said.
“And it wasn't a great success, any-
way. Have you noticed how largely
the conversation among hotel guests
turns upon other hotels?” -
“Have I not 2 Do you know Beach-
combe Bay? Where did you stay?
The Métropole? We stayed at the
Grand. The position's better, but I'm
told the food's better at the Métropole.
That kind of thing?”
“Exactly,” said Ernest. “You hear
it all round you. And Mrs. Mottle
specialises in it. She talks of nothing
else. Now, in my more active days I
seldom if ever stayed in hotels. Or if
I did they were small fishing inns in
Ireland or Wales. So she found me the
poorest of company.”
“And presently you saw the Rolls
disappearing down the road at a steady
35 m.p.h.2"
“You need not harp on the Rolls,”
said Ernest. “But you've no doubt
been soured by that morning you spent
playing with little Peter on the beach
before you found that his people hadn't
a car. Mrs. Mottle's a kind woman,
and I felt sorry not to provide her with
better entertainment. So I've taken
steps to inform myself upon her special
subject.”
“And how have you done that?” I
asked.
“I've been studying ‘The A.B.C.
Hotel Guide,’” said Ernest, “ and next
time I hope to put up quite a creditable
show.” -
It was not long before Mrs. Mottle
had joined us, at Ernest's invitation.
I awaited the upshot with some inter-
est, and almost held my breatl, when
she asked, “Do you know Bexcliff 2
We stayed at the Queen's there. A
very good hotel.”
“I know it well,” said Ernest. “It
is, as you say, quite good. They have
excellent cuisine and wines. Electric
light throughout. Night porter.”
Mrs. Mottle looked at him a little
sharply, I thought, but she tried again.
“We went from there to Eastport,”
she said.
“Did you stay at the Victoria.”
cried Ernest, who I saw at once had
made a special study of the advertise-
ment of this hotel. “There they give
you every comfort — large smoking-
room, quiet lounge, splendid situation,
lift, garage, hotel bus meets all trains.
Quite different from the Prince's, near
the station,” he went on, warming to
his work. “That is family and com- ||

tariff on application. And there is a
stockroom. I don't know exactly what
it means, but I remember that there
is one."
I saw in Mrs. Mottle's eye that this
wasn't exactly what she wanted, but
Ernest is in some ways unobservant,
and he went plunging on.
“I think you said you stayed at the
Royal at Harrogate?” he said. “What
a first-class hotel! Occupying as it
does a unique position, standing in its
own unequalled grounds directly facing
the sea n
“Harrogate isn't on the sea,” said
Mrs. Mottle in a freezing voice.
It was only then that Ernest realised:
that he had overdone it. His explana-
tion that he must have been thinking
of the Royal at Whitepool fell lament-
ably flat, and Mrs. Mottle departed
with the conviction that he had been
pulling her leg.
“I may yet get a run in the Rolls,”
I said to him afterwards, “unless my
connection with you has compromised
me. If I do I'll take detailed notes of
any hotel we may call at for refresh-
ment, and let you have them for your
collection.”
WHEN CLAUDIA SMILES.
Claudia propped her elbows on the
sea-wall and gazed entrancedly over the
bay to where the great Dreadnoughts
loomed like grim battlemented islets.
“The lambs ' " she breathed.
Claudia's Uncle John—who occupies
a Chair of Experimental Exegesis at one
of our older, mouldier Universities, and
who handles his words as a connois-
seur handles Venetian glass—groaned
brokenly.
“‘Lambs,' my dear child ! They can
crumple up an Atlantic liner like a
paper bag; vomit tons of bursting

Claudia cut off his flow with an up-
lifted hand. - -
“Don’t be disgusting, John. You
know very well I was referring to the
other side of their natures. They are
quite too sweet for words in their home
lives, full of unexpected little cupboards
and inhabited by the twee-est middies
who dance enchantingly. I do wish
somebody would take me over one.”
She smiled wistfully at me and
sighed.
“It might be possible,” said I. “A
lot of civilians are boarding those
tenders over there. Suppose we try?”
Fifty feet from the pier-head my
passage was barred by a ponderous
policeman.
“Only them with special invites can
go,” he growled.
“But surely . . .” I began.

I turned back and confessed my
failure.
“A policeman stopped you?" Claudia
exclaimed. “Not intentionally, I'm
sure. I always find them so sym-
pathetic. Where is he?”
She advanced on the constable and
smiled at him. The fellow inflated his
chest and twisted his moustachios.
Claudia is easy to look at, and when
she smiles the heart of mortal man is
as pudding within him.
When Claudia smiles, policemen rush
And stop the traffic; porters crush
Each other underfoot that they

and smiled at him. He did his best
to look stern, but his number was up.
“Good afternoon; what jolly weather,

nice and blue and sunny . . . though

She turned to me. “Few people
realize what a policeman has to put
up with—the long hours, out in all
weathers, keeping guard over us while

we sleep. And there are no bands play-
ing, no O.B.E.'s, no Victoria Crosses
—just unremitting silent service.”
The constable coughed into his glove
and increased his chest measurement
still further.
Claudia smiled on him again. “I
wonder if you would be so frightfully
kind as to let us go to the pier-head
just for a minute to watch all those
funny people scramble on the tenders ?
Would you?” she cooed like a ring-dove.
“Certainly, Miss. No 'arm in that.
Pass this way, please.” We passed.
“There you are,” said Claudia; “I
told you so. They will do anything if
you're gentle with them. It's only
when people push against them and
stand on their feet that they get irrit-
able.”
We reached the pier-head. A mine-
sweeper chaſed gently against the steps,
were swarming aboard the flag-ship. A
smart junior officer was standing at
the head of the ladder watching the in-
nocent antics of the animals. Claudia
halted within a few yards of him and
gazed spell-bound. -
“Don’t attract his attention,” I
hissed. “He'll demand our credentials
and have us thrown overboard.”
“Is it Admiral Beatty?” she asked
in an awe-struck stage aside.
“I hardly think so,” I whispered.
“He’s got his cap on too straight.”
“They are frightfully alike, anyhow,”
Claudia went on. “The same eternal
watchfulness, the same iron firmness of
jaw that comes from years and years of
unremitting silent service"—she smiled
in the direction of the Sub-Lieutenant
—“my goodness, I do adore blue-and-
gold !”
The Sub flicked a thread off his sleeve,
time we had returned to the stern and
the officers' dug-outs Claudia had pro-
mised faithfully to be his on November
3rd, always providing her family hadn't
kidnapped her in the meanwhile or
that she wasn't marrying somebody
else on that day. A sun-blaze of gold
braid, surmounted by a weather-carved
humorous face, suddenly shone out
from a curtained doorway. Claudia
smiled at him. The humorous mouth
twitched at the corners in response.
“For heaven's sake go easy,” I im-
plored; “it’s the Captain, I believe.”
“I'm going to thank him, then ; it's
only polite,” said Claudia, and ran to-
wards the sun-blaze. “We’re most
frightfully obliged to you for letting us
come aboard your splendid ship; it's
been too utterly gorgeous for words. I
don't know when I've enjoyed myself
more.”

directed. I approached

She let loose the

His number was up.
“Delighted, I'm
sure,” he laughed;
“but I shall be even
more so if you'll come

The smitten tar breathed hard through
his retroussé snout and hitched at his
pants. His number was up.
“Lady of your party?” he inquired
sotto voce. I nodded.

I. “Heard from home lately 2 How's

He grinned. “Pa's insolvent; Ma's

He handed Claudia down the sea-
weedy steps with tender care, and with
his cap gallantly dusted a hatch-cover
for her to sit on. Ten minutes later we
patted his tie, shot his cuffs and stepped
towards us. His number was up.
“If you would care to see over the
ship I shall be only too happy to show

Claudia beamed. That would simply
be too frightfully thrilling. To explore

had been dying to do all her life. Oh

THE PROPHETEERS.
(With apologies to the Meteorological Office.)
IN some high mansion, I suppose,
The weather-men confront the stars,
Giving “the glass” tremendous blows
And drinking deep at isobars;
And, though I love the language of their art
And all those little arrows on the chart,
There is a thing that jars.
Is it the case that human brain
Can trace the heavenly secrets so,
The cyclones rushing round in Spain
Or bearing down on Pimlico,
And if we'll want our flannels or our furs,
By simply studying barometers—
Can we believe it? No.
But I know ladies by the score
Whose hair, like seaweed, scents the storm;
Long, long before it starts to pour
Their locks assume a baneful form ;
Ah, who has not with Muriel rejoiced
One morning when her hair was much less moist,
Meaning it must be warm 2
And I believe, with brush and comb,
Some damsel in an inner shrine
Sits always at the prophet's home
While sages all around recline,
Or wait with reverence on the outer mat
Until in ecstasy she pins a plait
And shrieks, “It will be fine.”
Then haste they to the great high-priest
And scribble down the mystic rune,
“An anti-cyclone, moving East,
Will stabilise conditions soon;
An inch of sunshine has occurred in Hants; ”
Whereat the whole world puts on thinner pants
And practises the swoon.
But when they hear the Sibyl chant,
“All colourless, and feels like clay,
All straight and horrible—I can't
Do nothing with my hair to-day!”
Then write they down, “A deep depression runs
South-west from Iceland—secondary ones
Are busy in the Bay.”
Think of the powers of that young girl,
And how much destiny must hinge
On whether she can get a curl
To come in her confounded fringe!
Ah, what, I wonder, would the nation do
Suppose one day she took a wet shampoo
Or went and had a singe
And if at times the forecasts sing
Of heat and sun and anticycs
And we, in fact, get no such thing,
But rain enough to bust the dykes,
Well, even oracles are much like men,
And I suppose that that's what happens when
The Sibyl simply strikes. A. P. H.

[October 22, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT TO D0 WITH THE CRYSTAL PALAGE.
A certAIN amount of premature
speculation as to the future of the
Crystal Palace has been indulged in by
irresponsible publicists. Mr. Punch is
in a position to assert authoritatively
that the question has for some time past
engaged the attention of the Ministry
of Thrift, and that four schemes at pre-
sent hold the field.
The first is that which is promoted
by the Vegetarian Vigilance Society.
As no fewer than seventeen experts
claim the credit of having originated
this plan, it is wiser not to mention any
names. It is enough to state that
the proposal is to convert the Crystal
Palace into a gigantic forcing-house for
the cultivation of tomatoes. The value
of this product need not be insisted on.
Whether estimated in calories or kilo-
watts, statically or dynamically, the
tomato stands on the same level with
the potato and the parsnip. The equip-.
ment of the building for its new pur-
pose is calculated to cost not more than
twenty millions sterling, apart from
the wages of the gardeners, who would
number about five thousand, and of the
staff of experimentalists employed in
research work into the by-products of
the tomato, which is believed to contain
radium in large quantities, as well as
other elements of a sumptuous and
saponaceous quality.
The second scheme, which is power-
fully backed by Service men, is for the
conversion of the greatest of glass-
houses into a palace for the permanent
residence of a national hero. Unfor-
tunately there is a considerable diver-
gence of opinion as to the choice of
the hero, the Senior Service inclining
to favour Lord FISHER, and the Junior,
Lord FRENCH. A strong and increasing
group, however, including representa-
tive men of both Services, aims at a
compromise by which both of these
eminent commanders should be accom-
modated under the same roof.
Thirdly, there is the scheme for con-
verting PAXTON's masterpiece into a
Country Club and Rendezvous for all
the members of the Order of the British
Empire. An annual subscription of
five guineas should ensure an income of
five million pounds. The only serious
objection to this scheme is that the
Crystal Palace would require consider-
able enlargement to accommodate all
the members of the Order, and that it
might not be possible to meet this diffi-
culty within the compass of the grounds
available. - -
The fourth and last scheme is of a
more modest character, but it has the
support of a powerful and enlightened
section of the Press. It is to make the
Crystal Palace a great laboratory of
Spiritualistic Research, under the triple
direction of Sir OLIVER LoDGE, Sir
ARTHUR CoNAN Doy LE and Mr...ALGER-
NoN BLAckwood. The Archbishop of
CANTERBURY, without definitely com-
mitting himself to the project, is be-
lieved to have expressed the opinion
that in the circumstances it was de-
serving of careful consideration.
MIGRACIOUS.
THE non-migrating birds, you know,
They fret about the swallows so.
“Why ever need they go so far?
Why aren't they happy where they are?
Suppose these terrible migrations—
This wintering with other nations—
This gadding over land and sea
Should lower their vitality?
And then suppose they miss their way,
And don't they think they'd better
stay?”
This flatters but does not convince
The gallant-hearted swallows, since
It seems with them an idée fice
To fly and fly for weeks and weeks.
But still they think it very kind
That all the other birds should mind.
The swallows tell them not to fuss ;
They say, “You leave it all to us.
We've done this thing a time or two
And, love you, we shall see it through.”
But no, the kindly little birds
Are not to be put off with words.
They ponder as they lie awake
What things the swallows ought to take.
And, when one day they heard them
cry,
“You mustn't trouble, by-the-by,
To cut us sandwiches, because
We cannot hold them in our claws;
We want to travel very light;"
The little birds were j in night.
For they had planned delicious things,
Tomatoes cut in little rings,
With cress and egg and caviare,
Because the swallows flew so far.
And now to let them wander wide
With only what they'd got inside'
From dusk to dawn they thought and
thought,
And with the dawn they up'd and
wrought.
On every telegraphic post,
Both inland and along the coast,
They balanced upon little pegs
Row after row of hard-boiled eggs,
All ready shelled—in sun and rain
They gleam like cups of porcelain
(You must have often seen them there
And doubtless wondered what they
were).
The other birds arranged these rows
To tempt each swallow, as he goes,
To take a bite, a tiny sup,
To keep his little courage up.
And then they telegraphed to know
If they might trust in CLEMENCEAU
To organise and to finance
A sister scheme for use in France,
And got the Spaniards to prepare
Food at their castles in the air.
The trouble was that no one knew
Exactly where the swallows flew ;
For swallows do not raise the topic
Of where they sojourn—just some
tropic.
They never would confess it quite
Even to dear old GILBERT WHITE.
So much for inland strategy;
What of the salt estranging sea?
They went to BEATTY. Such a man
Might hit upon a helpful plan.
He begged them not to give up hope;
An omelette on the periscope,
He thought, would be the very thing
To catch the swallows on the wing.
“My submarines shall form a chain
From Dover to the tropic main,
And poke up light repasts, with fruit,
At intervals along the route.”
“BEATTY for ever !” cried the birds
In gratitude too deep for words.
They feel that they can sit at ease,
Since every swallow, should he please,
May tell himself as on he wends,
“I am remembered by my friends.”

THAT’s why I wouldN'T HAVE IT MYself when I TRIED IT on AT THE shop
|N A GOOD CAUSE.
THE l’I,IGHT OF BART's.
SHALL the oldest London hospital be cramped in its
merciful activities?—that is the question of the hour. For
want of an additional flick to public generosity (on which,
rightly or wrongly, all hospitals depend) shall the increased
cost of life and the decreased value of money be allowed
to curtail the great and noble work for which St. Bartholo-
mew's—or Bart's—has been famous for centuries? Already
the Convalescent Home at Swanley, which was opened so
confidently in 1885, and has been dealing with patients at
the rate of a thousand a year ever since, has had to be closed.
Shall any further curtailments be permitted”
Surely not. That is Mr. Punch's hope and belief.
It is true that spare cash may not be too plentiful just
now, and yet there must be no very serious lack of it in
London, or there could not be the theatrical boom of which
we have been hearing; there could not be such vivacity as
the streets disclose. But even if it were rarer a small sum
can be spared by most of us, and there is no better way of
laying it out than in ensuring the continuance at full power
of this famous institution; at, indeed, fuller power; for the
hour has struck for certain re-buildings and enlargements,
all in the interests of efficiency.
We owe it to old RAHERE, the monk who founded both
the priory and the hospital as long ago as the reign of
HENRY I.; it would be treachery, after so many years, to
let his humane purpose lack support. When the doom of
the monasteries was decreed by HENRY VIII., the hospital
was separated and secularised and in 1547 granted a royal
charter by that monarch, whose effigy still stands over the
chief doorway facing Smithfield, providing for “the con- |
tinual relief and help of an hundred sore and diseased,”
because of “great pity for the poor, aged, sick and impotent
people.” That this “great pity" of 1547 is not in 1919 an
extinct emotion we now have opportunity to show.
There is only too much need for it, for this hospital, like
so many others, has suffered by its very success. The
more it helps, the more funds are needed; and while the
“hundred sore and diseased" of 1547 have been multiplied
out of all knowledge, the revenues of the hospital have
gone down. To come to actual figures, the “hundred sore
and diseased" of 1547 had grown by 1918 to sixty-eight
thousand three hundred and ten. In 1914, before the
War had begun to send up the price of everything, the
hospital was costing £90,936 5s.1d, a year, including the
£3,500 a year for the maintenance of the Convalescent
Home at Swanley. The present rate of expenditure is
£122,308 9s. 7d., and the Convalescent Home has gone.
It is to make good a heavy deficiency, to re-open the Home,
to build new accommodation for the nurses, and to ensure
solvency, at any rate for the immediate future, that the
appeal to the public is now being made—the first time that
Saint Bartholomew has gone out hat-in-hand for a hundred-
and-fifty years.
Mr. Punch is anxious to raise as large a fund as possible
in aid of this great work, and earnestly begs his generous
readers to address donations to The Secretary of Punch,
10, Bouverie Street, Whitefriars, E.C. 4.

WHAT EVERY WOMAN
(APPARENTLY) WANTS,
THE following is an attempt to repro-
duce the elusive style of those little
“Home Talks about Hubby and How
to Please Him” (“Hubby,” it should
be explained to the readers of Punch, is
an endearing diminutive for Husband)
which are a feature of every Woman's
Page in every popular paper. The
thing is not so easy as it looks, and
the writer of this article is conscious
that full justice may not have been
done to the light-hearted spirit of un-
conscious banality which characterises
these causeries:—
POT-LUCK.
When Hubby brings Home a Friend.
“How is it that your marriage is so
happy?” friends often ask me in a
puzzled way.
Let me give you the secret of this
unusual condition. I always allow
John perfect freedom to ask a friend
in to a meal whenever he likes. Incon-
venient? Not if you follow my plan.
For example, John rang up the other
evening to say he would be home to
dinner in half-an-hour and was bring-
ing a man with him to take “pot-luck.”
There was nothing in the house but
some scrag-end of cold mutton and a
herring; but I did not tell John this,
as many wives might have done.
“Bring him along, dear,” I said
bravely; “I’ll manage somehow.”
Then I hurried to the store-room and
took down a tin of sardines, feeling the
occasion justified this little extrava-
gance of hors d'acuvres. For soup I
tossed a quart of water into a saucepan,
into which I flung all the little “leav-
ings” and odds and ends which will
collect in every larder. After bringing
this gently to the boil I removed the
foam and added a dash of disinfectant
powder to give it a subtle indescribable
flavour. I also added a soupçon of car-
bolic tooth-powder to produce an effect
of lobster bisque. -
I now took the herring, which I
boned, folded, damped, pressed and
ran lightly through the mangle, finally
shaping it into dainty rissoles. I gave
them a rich brown appearance by
sprinkling lavishly with the disin-
fectant powder (of which I still had
half a tin), and served them up with a
sauce of ordinary boot-cream which is
to be found in any house and is so
useful in an emergency. .
I next put the scrag-end of mutton
through the mincer—it came out Páte
d'Agneau de Galles; at least that is
how it appeared in the menu. Oh,
yes, I had a menu, for that gives such
ton to your pot-luck dinner. It ran
as follows:—
Hors d'oeuvres variés.
Bisque d'Homard.
Hareng brouillé. Béchamel Chaussures.
Pâte d'Agneau de Galles. Sauce Menthe.
Gateau de riz désinfect&.
It wasn't really a literal description
of the scrag-end of mutton dish, but
it read well, and the friend didn't know
enough French to thrash the matter
out. He left expressing his astonish-
ment at what he termed a most ap-
petising repast. -
And John was so pleased at my
resource and economy that he has
promised to buy me the set of skunk
for which I've languished for ages.
So you see, although it often means a
little extra trouble and ingenuity, it
really pays to humour a man, doesn't

IN A DASHING. HOCKEY CHARGE EX-SERGEANT THRUSTER SUDDENLY GETS THAT “OVER-THE-TOP” FEELING.
LOSSEERING.
By LovELL BLAzER.
THE newspapers of late have been
full of the working of the Profiteering
Act. I have not a word to say against
the principle involved—the protection
of the consumer against the illicit ra-
pacity of the manufacturer or retailer.
But the prosecution of profiteers en-
tirely fails to remedy another cruel
abuse which has grown out of the op-
portunities of the War—I mean the
penalising of the brain-worker, who,
instead of being remunerated in pro-
portion to the cost of living, has often
earned less than in pre-war times, and
at best has received a ludicrously in-
adequate bonus. Against the crimes of
profiteers must be set the sufferings of
those whom—in default of a better term
—we may call the Losseers. And it
is not a case of a few victims, to whom
the maxim De minimis non curat ler
might apply. The name of the Losseers
is legion. In this distressful cate-
gory must be included the entire class
of novelists, male and female. With
very few exceptions they kept their
fountain-pens at full blast throughout
the War. The price of paper was
trebled, and that of ink was so pro-
hibitive that some of them at the time of
the Armistice were seriously contem-
plating the terrible alternative of writing
with their blood. (It is impossible to
discuss the subject without constant re-
sort to the use of italics.) But with a
self-sacrificing generosity that cannot be
too highly commended they instructed
their publishers, instead of asking twelve
shillings a copy, as they were logically
entitled to do, to be content at the out-
side with seven shillings, a sum which,
as anyone with a rudimentary know-
ledge of war economics will readily
admit, extinguished completely any pos.
sible margin of profit. In other words
our novelists were working gratuitously
throughout the War. And this in spite
of the terribly severe handicap under
which they were labouring by reason of
the unfair competition of Truth with
Fiction. This remark applies not only
to novelists but to all purveyors of
sensation.
Many tragic examples might be cited
of those who found their occupation
gone. Several actresses with the most
superb dental equipment were absolutely
disregarded by the illustrated press.
The claims based on the intellectual and
moral damage sustained by thousands
of innocent people owing to the superior
attractions of the War clamour for a
Government Commission. It is invidi-
ous to particularise, but an exception
must be made in favour of Mr. BERNARD
SHAw, who for more than four years was
relegated to the unnatural obscurity of
the ordinary individual, tempered by a
brief joy-ride at the Front, where his
opportunities of self-expression were
marred by the humiliating limitations
which the wearing of khaki imposed on
him.
There is also the ineffably piteous
case of an Admiral of the Fleet who,
never having received so much as a
“Thank you” since the death of KING
Edward, has been driven to journalism
in his seventy-eighth year, much as
SIMs REEves, at the same age, was re-
duced to appearing at the Halls. We
need not dwell on the prima donna
whose periodical losses of her jewel-
case were passed over unnoticed, or
the pianist whose capillary attractions
ceased to enrapture his audience.
Enough has been said to show what an
overwhelming case can be made out for
the bestowal of liberal compensation on
those who were cruelly penalised by the
very conditions which furnished other
sections of the community with an
occasion for illicit gain.

Now is the time of the memorial feast !
Ye maidens all, put on your thickest things,
The furs provided by some faery beast,
And do the buttons up and tie the strings.
Put on your jerseys and your mitts, ye boys,
Ye elder lads your Anglo-Saxon warms,
And let the bell give forth a solemn toll
And make a circle of the hardest forms -

And crown it with some beech-leaves from the lane,
And pour a spot of brandy over it,
If we have any brandy; have we, Jane?
Let it be borne upon a pewter dish
And lay it very reverently and slow
On to the piece of wood, with hands devout,
And light it till there comes a fitſul glow.
Now every one of you may have a wish,
But do not breathe too loud, and do not swish
Your petticoats, ye girls; it might go out.

And why we sit with hands and feet like ice,

Demands a ceremonial sacrifice;
There was a time—you'll read it in your books,
You younger children—when a furnace shone
In every English grate and no one groused,
Before the lean and dreadſul years came on ;
Gay laughter echoed from the ingle-nooks
And every face reflected, pleased as cook's,
The glory of illimitable froust.
Then politicians used to toast their toes -
And artists got their fame by brooding long
Over a dream of amber and of rose,
And port was drunk and there was wassail song;
And that is why, although it gives no he it,
We sit to-night before this tiny flame
(See to it, Mabel, or the spark expires,
So damp it is, so delicate and tame),
Lest we forget how, crimson as the beet,
Our great forefathers used to grill their feet
In England, in the days when there were fires.

THE SOCIAL REFORMER.
I AM not the Social Reformer. I am
that which is to be reformed. First,
I had to be deprived of my money.
This was found easy, for I have been
more virtuous than the average of my
fellows and have always been good
enough not to earn much. The last
remnant of my cash had been removed
that very morning by the tax-collector.
I write from abroad; perhaps you have
not these things in England.
This process being finished, my refor-
mation is to be completed first by de-
hate. He pulls up every morning at
my door, and every morning his para-
site rides into town with him on his
platform. This, of course, only pending
the striking of the hour of “zero.”
There is generally a third of us: a
sacred railwayman going to his work.
Between him and me there is (La Révo-
lution tells us) a bloody feud. I ought
to do his work and he ought to have
my house. He says he doesn't like
my house because it looks damp. It is.
However, we cannot blame La Révolu-
tion for that. La Révolution is going
It was the Social Reformer in person.
He wore a tram-man's cap, without
which he might possibly not have been
identified with Labour. However, per-
haps his labour has been hard labour
in its time, so it is not fair to insist on
that. He wore civilian clothes, to show
he had the right to belong to Society
just as much as I had. He wore no
collar or tie, thus demonstrating his
independence; he carried an umbrella,
thus demonstrating his moral superi-
ority to the rest of us. He talked. He
never stopped talking. He never had
stopped talking. He said he never
priving me of heat, next of
food, next of movement, next
of everything necessary to life,
and next of everything else.
The oppressed are then to rise
and there is to be slaughter.
I am not the oppressed; I am
to be the slaughtered. When
my body has been torn about
a bit and my head has been
fixed up on a high place in a
central quarter where it may
be relied upon duly to adver-
tise the movement, and when
my blood has been utilised for
writing the great triumphal
poster of La Révolution, then,
if I read the leaders of that
same La Révolution correctly,
my reformation will be com-
plete. La Révolution refers to
me as a parasite; nay, worse,
as a bourgeois. It also ad-
dresses me daily as its dear
reader, whom it may count
upon, when the day comes as
come it must, to assist in the
mauling of parasites and bour-
geois. From time to time it

F. would stop talking. We gath-
siered that he had plenty of time
to spare for the purpose, since
the brutal bourgeoisie would
neither let him sleep nor eat,
- nor have a happy hearth where-
at to sit with his family. I
fancy that the same bourgeoisie
had taken his family off him,
and made out of its bodies
tyres for their lavish motor
cars. I could see that the mean
bourgeoisie had stolen his razor
and his soap.
When I got on the tram I
think he had just been dis-
suaded from taking my house.
This shows that La Révolution
is right in encouraging the
theory of irremovable hatred
between me and the railway-
man, who dissuaded him. But
it made the Social Reformer
suspicious of the railwayman,
who knew so much about
houses, and it tended to reduce
him to the confusion under
which we all are as to who is
on which side, and why. One
cannot postpone a promising
war for the purpose of worrying
that; so, whoever of us might
be which, he went on with his
rights of Labour. I am a parasite and
I'm for it. Always anxious to do my
duty, I have written to the Editor to
ask which side I'm really on. The
answer came that, owing to circum-
stances, the war was postponed, that
my question could not be answered,
pending the return of the Editor from
his holiday in the mountains; that
meanwhile my half-yearly subscription
was overdue, and that in further default
I should be subjected to the processes
of the law. Quem deus vult perdere,
prius dementat.
Meanwhile there is a tram from my
village to the town, provided by a callous
Government to prevent the honest work-
ing man using his legs. It is driven
by a man between whom and me (La
Iłóvolution tells us) there is implacable
right. La Révolution will have to be
very rich and very persistent.
La Révolution must have got to hear
of these flippant tram-rides of ours,
every morning, which, being a grave
form of fraternisation, were extremely
bad for the future of society. The
Editor must hurriedly have paid his
hotel bill (out of other people's half-
yearly subscriptions), chartered a taxi
to come up the mountains and fetch
him home, and must have told people
about it. Communications being cut
between La Révolution and the para-
site, owing to the small affair of out-
posts between us, I cannot be precise.
Anyhow, this morning there was An-
other on the front platform with the
driver and the railway man when the
tram pulled up for me.
speech. Though I was absent from the
first half-hour of it I now know it all
by heart. It was thus:—
“The middle class exploits our labour.
It suppresses us; it makes us work,
and it steals the produce of our labour.”
We thus learnt who had stolen his
collar. “If the Parliament does any-
thing to help us ” (it had just halved
the hours of working and doubled the
rates of pay) “the middle classes try to
undo it. It is always like that. It is
their mentality. We shall have no
justice while there are any middle
classes. There must be class warfare
to the finish.”
The driver looked ahead of him and
clanged his bell. There was no one in
the way, but someone had to do some-
thing, if only by way of applause. The

railwayman, who generally displays no
interest in the route, now helped the
driver in looking ahead. I found my-
self, no doubt under the stress of the
moment, also avoiding the Reformer's
eye and assisting at the look-out. But
the Reformer was not to be done in like
that; he joined us on the look-out and
began again on a new theme:–
“Must there not be class warfare to
the finish 2 Shall we have any justice
while there are any middle classes 2 Is
it not their mentality? Is it not always
like that ? Do you deny that when the
Parliament at last does anything to
help us the middle classes try to undo
it 2 The middle classes make us work
and steal the produce of our labour.
Should the middle classes be allowed
to exploit us?”
The driver asked sulkily what the
middle classes were doing to re-arrange
the working hours and the pay? He
had not been told about this. The
Reformer explained fully:—
“The middle class exploits our labour.
It suppresses us. It makes us work
and it steals the produce of our labour.
If the Parliament does anything to help
us the middle classes try to undo it. It
is always like that. It is their men-
tality. We shall have no justice while
there are any middle classes. There
must be class warfare to the finish.”
The railway-man had now lost all
interest in everything, including the
road ahead. He was leaning out, gaz-
ing to the side and thinking of other
things. For myself, I was not as ex-
cited as I had been. But the driver
was all attention, because it is a driver's
business to attend to things, and no man
can be asleep and awake at the same
time. The Reformer regarded himself
as justified in developing his theme.
“And it all goes to show,” said he,
“that there must be class warfare to
the finish.” The driver clanged his bell.
“We shall have no justice whatever
while there is a single middle class left.
It is their mentality.” The driver
clanged his bell twice, and unneces-
sarily.
“If the Parliament does anything
ever to help us . . .” The tram stopped
with a bump.
“The middle classes completely un-
do it.” The tram started with a jerk,
which moved everybody. But it didn't
move the Reformer. He finished his
thesis, and then he gave us by way
of appendix and glossary a complete
explanation of the whole. This I am
afraid I cannot tell you. You see, I
haven't got you on a tram with me. I
can only leave you to guess.

COVERED TRACKS.
THE Railway crisis was over, but my domestic difficulties
remained as acute as ever. My coal-merchants were still
forbidden to supply me with more than a hundred-weight
of anthracite per week. As I had none in stock and depend
entirely for warmth and cooking on a stove and kitchen-
range which are considered economical marvels in that
they consume only five hundredweight a week between
then, it was obvious that the restricted allowance would
be exhausted long before the end of the second day. On
representing this to the local Fuel-Controller I found him
powerless to make any order, but was recommended to
interview the Coal - Controller at the Holborn Viaduct
Hotel, to which I went at once. -
On arrival I was directed to an office, where a pair of
unfledged flappers in yellow over-alls informed me that the
Coal-Controller was at the Hotel Windsor. I hurried to
Westminster accordingly, reached the colossal portico of the
Hotel Windsor, and at the top of a flight of steps a fatherly
hall-porter, entrenched behind a long counter, requested me
to write my name and business on a slip of paper; why, I
don't know, unless as a test of my powers as a précis-writer,
for he did nothing with it when it was finished.
Following his instructions, I went up two storeys to a
door numbered 501. Here, on describing my urgent need
of anthracite to a female clerk, I was referred to “No. 553,”
at the other end of the corridor, where another female clerk
assured me that a certain Mr. Budger, of whose precise
whereabouts she had no knowledge, was the proper person
to whom to apply. So I went downstairs again and con-
sulted the hall-porter, who was as fatherly and helpful as
ever; I had only to go up the steps on the other side of the
hall and, if I knocked at the glazed door he indicated, I
should see Mr. Budger. I did knock at that door, but the
clerk who opened it was not Mr. Budger's, nor, it appeared,
had that particular office any connection whatever with
coal-mines. However, he directed me to the room at the
end of an adjoining passage which Mr. Budger occupied, so
I was distinctly getting warm. But I did not see Mr.
Budger, and even if I had it would not have helped me
much, as he did not happen to be the Coal-Controller,
who, I was told, had moved back that very morning to the
Holborn Viaduct Hotel.
There seemed nothing for it but to follow his example.
After returning there I was not directed again to the room
with the unfledged flappers, but sent up in the lift to the
fifth floor to another numbered door. Here, in an office
simply furnished with a desk and table, another female
clerk asked me to write my name and business in a book,
with which she disappeared. When she returned presently
without the book and with an invitation to follow her, I felt |.
that I was very near the Presence. She conducted me to
another room, which I entered unperceived, as the official,
who was presumably the Coal-Controller, was engaged
with other callers. I gathered from the conversation
that, whatever their suit might have been, it had been
granted, which was most encouraging. But they were
some time in explaining to him exactly why they had
thought it better to come round and talk it over personally,
and a longer time still before they had exhausted their
expressions of gratitude and taken their leave. Then at last
I was alone with the Controller and free to impart my
troubles to him.
From the first moment I had felt that he was the kind of
man I could get on with. He was smoking a pipe; there
was a genial twinkle in his eye; he had a comfortable fire
—in short he was a human being who could feel for the fire-
less. No one could have listened more sympathetically,
and I was convinced that my cause was as good as gained.
And it might have been but for the fact that he controlled
something else and had no jurisdiction whatever in such
matters as mine.
This would have been a serious set-back if he had not
kindly offered to put me in touch with the proper authority
and conducted me himself down another corridor to a door,
outside which he asked me to wait a few moments. I
waited hopefully, for I knew he was in there preparing the
way for me, and I had only to go in and win. After a
while he reappeared and intimated that I could now enter.
When I did I was charmed by the courtesy with which
I was received, though not surprised, for I had already
discovered that the control of coal resembles Art in its ten-
dency to “sqften manners and not suffer them to beeome
ferocious.”
I took a seat opposite the Chief Official, and once more
I told my sorrowful tale. By this time I had begun to get
a trifle tired of it myself, but of course it was new to him, and
I had an impression that I was telling it more poignantly
than ever and making a really powerful appeal to his better
feelings, so that I was all the less prepared for his making
an appeal to mine. If, he pointed out, some persons were
allowed a whole ton of anthracite other persons would have
to go without altogether—which gave me a guilty sense
of being a sort of anthracite hog. It was not till after the
interview that I remembered that practically it was I who
was in the position of going without. Anyhow, he made it
quite clear that, for the present at all events, no exception
to the rules could possibly be made; after which he invited
ine to come and see him again, and gave me his card, from
which I discovered later that he was not the Coal-Controller
after all, but only an Inspector.
Even then I had not lost all hope of running the Coal-
Controller to ground in time. At least I did not lose it till
the next day, when I read in the paper that he had re-
signed his position. It is painful to think he was so deter-
mined to evade me as all that. F. A.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE voice of Mr. STANLEY J. WEYMAN sounds out of the
past with an effect of old friendship singularly agreeable;
the story too with which he breaks an over-long silence is
one that will have for many a topical appeal. When every
morning brings its Daily Herald of fresh unrest, and when
the industrial outlook recalls the deathless epigram of the
Red Queen, addressed to Alice, “The more there is of mine,
the less there is of yours,” it is well for us to be reminded
that the picturesque had also their social problems, and that
the ruin of England is a catastrophe periodic rather than
ultimate. All I mean by this is that The Great House
(MURRAy) deals with the tumultuous forties, when PEEL
turned repealer and plunged the country into the chaos of
the Corn Law elections. Very skilfully does Mr. WEYMAN
use this background of political passion to emphasize the
dignified, essentially aristocratic development of his plot,
an affair of disputed title seen through the eyes of a girl,
herself the niece of one claimant and the betrothed of the
other. Perhaps it may strike you that, for circles so aloof,
Mr. WEYMAN is at times a thought melodramatic in his
machinery—missing documents, for example. It was what
I venture to call Lord Audley's Secret that they contained,
bricked up in the muniment-room of his uninhabitable
Great House; a paper—but I will leave it undisturbed. In
any case its revelations will, I fancy, interest you less than
the pictures of English country life in a dramatic hour,
drawn by a hand that has lost nothing of its old sympathy
or cunning.
It is long since I read a volume that more continually
trembles on the edge of fascinating indiscretions than the one
Mrs. STUART MENZIEs has entitled Sir Stanley Maude and
Other Memories (JENKINs). Our hero of Baghdad figures
with reasonable prominence in the first fifty pages or so,
but afterwards the writer launches boldly and with self-
confessed happiness on a stream of varied personal re-
miniscences which become with almost every page more
free and intimate. And certainly the book improves as it
flows on. Only for convention's sake, it would seem, is the
current ever interrupted by the conclusion of a chapter, for
as often as not a subject crosses swimmingly from one to
the next. Chapter iii., for instance, which includes remarks
on pig-sticking, official red-tape, the present whereabouts
of ENVER PASHA, and an offending gentleman now in high
position, of whom the writer hopes that he will see this and
be sorry, shares the story of an Afghanistan border incident
with Chapter iv., which deals amongst other things with
hospitalities in Ceylon, a Viceroy's popular wife and an air-
raid story that will by no means bear repetition. At first
one was apt to be irritated by a tendeney to lay down the
law er cathedra, but, after all, this is a lady's privilege, and
when an author is brave enough to speak of a foreigner
as “moving her arm after the fashion of the cylinder on the
wheels” (with allusion probably to a railway engine), who
will dispute her claim to further technical proficiency, in
politics, say, or strategy? But all else is quite subordinate
to her main theme—stories of the Great. It seems that
with the most charming garrulity in the world she can
relate anecdotes almost too personal about everybody of
inside importance in Europe—particularly Russia—and this
too, from time to time, with real literary skill and with
grammar nearly always equal to the occasion.

suitable gift? He will probably learn from it a lot of things
that have escaped him, including the fact that peoples
who wilfully deprive themselves of alcoholic refreshment,
like the Saracens and the Chinese, get passed in the race
by the bibbers of alcohol. In the author's case it cannot
be said that when the wine is in the wit is out. Mr. ANDRF.
L. SIMON writes from evidently wide knowledge and with
sustained vivacity, and has produced an appetising blend
of history, science and epicureanism very pleasant to the
palate. Save that for reasons obvious but perhaps hardly
convincing he has said practically nothing of the vintages
of Germany or Austria—must a patriotic Briton never
savour Hock or Tokay again?—there is little in the way
of fermented liquor that his discriminating pen has left
untouched and unadorned. The chapters on Claret, Port
and Champagne are especially illuminating. The author
assures us that France was twice saved by her sparkling
wine—first in 1914, when the German invaders drank them-
selves to a standstill, and again in 1918, when the order to
evacuate Rheims was actually given by the French High
ready (or rather, perhaps, unpractised) writer. His latest
volume, Gabrielle of the Lagoon (GRANT RICHARDs), is an
essay in Romance, which reveals him as more familiar with
the scenes described than furnished with the technique to
“make a story” of them. Thus his Pacific setting is alto-
gether real and admirable; his transcriptions of places
and types, of rum-drinking skippers, of chiefs, or of that
sometimes highly objectionable product, the native “con-
vert,” have all the actuality of experience. But Gabrielle
herself, daughter of a drunken trader and a half-caste woman,
whose strain of island-blood impels her to wild bursts of
dancing, and whose relations with the hero and (a more
strenuous wooing) with the horrid Macka supply the heart-
interest of the story—frankly, I thought her native air was
less like the Tropics than Shepherd's Bush. Anyhow, it
is Macka's infatuation, her abduction by him and their pur-
suit, surely in remarkably leisured fashion, by the hero and
his supporters, that make out the volume. Incidentally
also this scheme furnishes occasion for any number of
detached episodes by the way, each of them, perhaps too

(acting colonel) by KoRNILov and KERENsky, she personally
led her regiment into action and successfully resisted, at the

words which convey little or no meaning to them, they will
also discover a fund of information which they can hardly

volume, the first ten of which deal with individual animals.
To me these are the pick from a richly filled basket; but
such essays as those on “Rejuvenescence" and “The

BEARD CULTURE.
NOT long ago one of Mr. Punch's contributors was
concerned about the question where people went to grow
their beards. I shall doubtless arouse the indignation of
innumerable beards-men by taking this step, but the secret
has been kept long enough, and with demobilisation and the
end-of the tyranny of the mere moustache, the time has
come to give the answer. Here it is: The Caspian Sea.
One can imagine beards bristling with wrath when their
owners read this, and a flood of disclosures pouring forth
in the usual strain: “SIR,-Not only have you made light
of the Freemasonry of the Beard, but you have told a
deliberate lie. I for one grew mine in my own back
garden.” Or, “SIR,--Authoritative though your statement
may be, I beg to bring to your notice the following
statistics, collected by myself from unimpeachable sources,
which would tend to show . . .” So we will modify the
sensational announcement and merely say, “All the best
beards are grown in the Caspian.” Of that I admit no
denial. I grew my own there.
Being on the wrong side of the Caucasus, I permitted
myself a certain amount of originality as to style. At first,
of course, there is no style about it. It is simply a case of
making the most of what one has. From the Sandpaper
Stage one progresses to the Harris Tweed Period, and from
thence by easy stages to the Penwiper Epoch. Then it is
—oh, joyous day!—that the growth first interferes with
tea-drinking and allied industries.
After that, time drags and the faint-hearted begin to say,
“A whole month since I last shaved, and three more before
I'm fit to look at. I'm going to have it off.” They do,
and think they have finished with it. Next morning they
have to shave again.' But the brave, who include myself,
carry on, and soon comes the joy of standing before a glass
with a pair of Scissors, hunting eagerly for something to
trim. ... Now, too, one can gauge one's peculiarities and plan
accordingly. To one comes the revelation that side-whiskers
are his only suit; to another, imperialism; to another,
influenced by local colour, that the Russian style is the
goods; and so on, each according to the disposition of the
fertile areas of his face.
Personally I found a tendency on the part of the growth
on the sides of my chin to outstrip that of the area in
between, but a little cultivation produced a spade-like effect,
which with careful training gradually developed the manner
of the true Assyrian school, as exposed in the more expen-
sive bas-reliefs. Day by day it grew and flourished, until
Asshu R-BAN-I-PAL himself (whose name sounds Assyrian,
anyhow) might have been proud of it. I was even saving
up to buy a row of beads to string across the end, though
this was, I believe, optional in Assyria. * -
Then came evacuation and prospects of a disguised
home-coming; but some of us fell by the wayside, and the
Black Sea claimed me for its own. On first coming on
board my new ship I was treated with the respect due to
my apparent years, but the tell-tale things round my arm
soon gave the show away. The beard had to come off.
I turned out and did the deed early last Sunday morning
with the ship's office scissors. Having herded my departed
glory into an envelope, I started to shave and to consider
how to dispose of such a valuable relic.
It was no use asking advice, for it would only produce
suggestions, of doubtful age and humour, that I should stuff
cushions with it, use it as barbed wire, and so forth. My
own idea was to send it to a taxidermist and have it
mounted. It should be my super-souvenir, and in the days
to come, when my children should gather round my knee
and ask the inevitable, “What did you do in the German-
American war, daddy?” I should unlock the top left-hand
drawer and deftly affix the great relic to my original chin.
It is only by impressing on our children the real horrors
of war that the future peace of the world can be secured.
But all the time I was shaving I had an unpleasant feel-
ing in the back of my mind that I had overlooked some-
thing, and suddenly it came to the surface. I was in His
Majesty's service; so then was my beard. It was a hard
revelation, but once I was reconciled to it my course was
plain. I sealed up the envelope and marked it “Beard.”
Then I attached a note addressed to the proper authority—
“SIR,--It is requested that the attached beard may be
discharged from H.M. service, services no longer required,
and may be disposed of in the manner most advantageous
to the Crown. History-sheet herewith.”
So if you buy one of those lists of Government stores for
sale, and see, just below “Beach-jobs, soft,” an entry,
“Beards, hand, second; style Assyrian, one,” you will know
all about it.

THE DISPOSAL OF JUGG.
According to his history-sheet Jugg
is a born sailor of fifty-four years and
fifty-five inches. In the presence of a
Warrant Officer he may be further
identified by:—
(1) True Lover's knot. Left forearm.
(2) Sea Serpent (couchant) Right ditto.
(3) Royal Naval crest. . Back, upper.
(4) Allied Flags. . Chest, centre.
(5) A Mole Ditto, upper.
His chief qualification is an ability to
raise a shine on brass, and by vigorous
movements emanating from the elbow
keep it there. He is also a gunner.
Jugg came to our squadron in the
days when warfare had been reduced to
a minimum. The reputation of our
own particular squadron in the air, com-
bined with the presence of a prince of
royal blood who languished as prisoner
in the luxurious lounge of the local
lunatic asylum, proved quite sufficient to
keep the Gothas away, and beyond an
occasional air patrol known as “Bathers'
Protection,” and a periodical Tally-Ho
in assorted aircraft after a stray mine
capable of moving three thousand tons
three hundred feet in any direction, the
War had developed into a very slow
business for us. Our solitary gun, which
had been installed in the early days to
raise the native moral and had stayed
on in a state of continual jam, had long
ceased to regard the War as anything
worth coming out of its tarpaulin about.
It soon became apparent, however,
that Jugg would never settle down to
our way of looking at things. In the
first place he told the Duty Officer his
gun needed cleaning, and it would
probably need cleaning again in the
second place, too. This took a week to
begin with. At the end of the second
week he had sacked his assistant gunner
for want of enthusiasm and painted the
gun-pit grey throughout. By the middle
of the third, everything dangling had
been pipeclayed, and at the commence-
ment of the fourth—a sunny week—
his brasswork had winked the local
lighthouse into obscurity and received
signalled confidences from every sea-
going ship within the ten-mile radius.
The fifth week of Jugg's reign opened
with a bit of variety by bringing the
neighbouring Admiral across. He was
old and non-submersible, and, paddling
over in a drifter (flying washing fore
and aft), he bumped our buoy and skil-
fully pitched himself from deck to dry
sand, rising in time to acknowledge the
sentry's salute. He did not stay long,
and his words, few but notable, gave
fear to the brave at heart and courage
to the very deaf. The impression we
gathered from his visit was that, if we
did not sprinkle our brasswork with
grey paint, he would probably be holding
a private shoot at our expense at the
first available dawn.
The following morning we set about
dismantling the gun. Jugg himself
was missing. He continued missing
throughout the day, but early in the
evening the shore guard, who had spent
an exciting afternoon leaning against
the barbed-wire and lending the third
button of his tunic as a touching-point
in some children's races, summoned us
to the telephone. He said that his
attention had just been attracted by the
strange conduct of a man answering to
Jugg's description walking along the
edge of the cliff. On his challenging the
man, who appeared to be throwing sea-
shells into the air and shouting “Bang”
at intervals in a loud voice, the fellow had
suddenly pulled up and without warn-
ing jumped over the edge of the cliff

and into the sea. Without delay our
salvage party, which occasionally ac-
cepts spells of duty and invariably has
to be rescued by another salvage party,
jumped into patent unsinkable waist-
coats and wound themselves up into
Air Force cravats and set off. It was
not until midnight that they returned,
wet and unanimous that Jugg had satis-
factorily disposed of himself and was
drowned. And on the morrow men
learned the news and went about their
work with smiling faces, and in the
evening the canteens were filled with
happy laughter.
However, one bright morning in the
summer of this year, Suzette, who has
been up to no good since she was a
puppy, went along the cliff to look out
a bone she had buried the week pre-
vious, and there she made a startling
discovery. It appears she was burrow-
ing at her accustomed depth near an
old shack and suddenly unearthed Jugg.
She found him alive and sitting on a
box extracting sardines from a tin with
a pen-nib. Of course no one with any
sense of proportion would have taken
Jugg for a bone, but Suzette did. Grip-
ping him between her teeth she hastened
down the cliff and, making a direct point
at the C.O., who happened to be pass-
ing, she laid Jugg at his feet.
The C.O., who was new and had
never seen Jugg, earthed or unearthed,
before, ordered him to be demobilised.
Perkins, a procrastinator and ambiguous
juggler with speech, being demobiliser,
replied that, although the man Jugg was
clearly alive, he had found on searching
his records that he was officially dead
also, and therefore could not be demo-
bilised, and his disposal as a corpse
could only be proceeded with on in-
structions from the Lost Property Office
or the Admiralty.
And now things have come to a pretty
pass. The Admiralty (of London) have
suddenly decided that Jugg is their
property and it is their duty to dispose
of his body in correct sailor fashion.
For our part we have wired and tele-
phoned full facts in every language
from Esperanto down to Erse, and the
M.O. now remains as our last resource.
It appears he is at present engaged in
making a cinematograph film of X-Ray
plates showing Jugg's heart ticking
over on full “revs.”
Meanwhile things are moving apace.
Yesterday a stalwart body of armed
Marines, accompanied by officer and
blank cartridge, arrived on the scene.
A little later they were followed by
(1) Some sailors.
(2) A naval band with covered drums.
(3) A ship's carpenter with coffin.
(4) A padre.
(5) Twelve wreaths.

And choose the rose-walk for delight,

A swish of skirts, a scent of musk,
A flitting shadow in the dusk.
She will not stir the fallen leaves
Nor brush you with her silken sleeves;
Her little buckled shoes will pass-
And never bend one blade of grass;
Only a gleam of powdered hair
Will show my lady pacing there.
What dreams she dreamt here long ago,
What hopes sped with her to and fro,
What wistful memories, what tears
In her withdrawn and widowed years,
Perhaps the last red rose could tell,
But roses keep their secret well.
Each Hallow-E'en she flits again
By starlight through her old domain,
A happy phantom come to see
The gardens of her memory;
To-night we are but trespassers;
The rose-walk and its past are hers.

THE RESIDENTIAL AREA.
AN OLD MAID.
THE advanced age of Miss Priscilla
Callender (who was one hundred and
eighteen at the time of her death a few
weeks ago) was by no means her only
title to respect. From the introduction
of the penny post until late in QUEEN
VICTORIA's reign she had been the post-
mistress of Ewehurst; and after her
retirement, which was celebrated by a
public testimonial and a sale of stamps
unexampled in village history, she be-
came a classical instance of the lon-
gevity of civil servants in general and
of annuitants in particular.
“I was born in the year one,” Miss
Callender was accustomed to say with
pardonable pride; and the nineteenth
century was never paid a sincerer com-
pliment. Her centenary, in honour of
which she received several Royal mes-
sages, will be comparatively fresh in
the public memory. If her demise at-
tracted less attention this must be put
down to the long postponement of the
event.
It must be granted that Miss Cal-
lender's later years were somewhat em-
bittered by the decline of interest in
her age. Scepticism she could face.
When a Welsh professor tried to iden-
tify her with a certain Pamela Culling-
ton, whose birth occurred in 1816 and
whose further particulars were missing
from the parish register, she replied
calmly that she remembered “this Cul-
lington girl, a minx with no respect
for her elders.” But indifference was
harder to bear. Miss Callender was an
earnest student of the local Press, and
as its references to “the wonderful old
lady” grew more infrequent she became
plaintive and morose. On one occasion
she was found by a neighbour tearing
The Bawnton Gazette and Ewehurst and
Farnford Recorder into little pieces, and
exclaiming, “They don't care how old
I am They don't care!”
Her craving for publicity led her, in
her hundred-and-sixteenth year, to attri-
bute to the virtues of a patent medicine
a longevity which was felt by her friends
to be assuming a chronic character.
Shortly afterwards a school of mental
culture devoted a playful article to
female centenarians, instancing her
case, and urged the efficacy of memor
training for ladies doubtful of their
exact age.
It is perhaps unfortunate that Miss
Callender's public career overshadowed
her private history, for this was of
the most interesting nature, and, if not
entirely blameless, was by no means
so frivolous as gossip would have us
believe.
People often wondered why this hand-
some old lady had never married, and
in an unreasonable but oddly human
way the question was asked more fre-
quently with every birthday after she
had completed her hundredth year. In
their answers, her pretended contem-
poraries, who in reality were young
enough to be her grandchildren, be-
trayed a good deal of jealousy and
malice. Their innuendoes gave pain to
Miss Callender and prejudiced some
neighbours against her. With a view
to dispelling this atmosphere of mistrust
the Vicar invited me, some years ago, to
look into the whole subject of Miss Cal-
lender's past, in the spirit as it were of
historical research. It may be objected
that this inquiry was made as long ago
as 1902, when the lady was only in
her hundred-and-first summer; but I
think that no subsequent events could
seriously be held to compromise her
reputation.
If Miss Callender had a fault, it was
a weakness for the military; she could
never resist a uniform. This amiable
trait in her character was first mani-
fested toward the close of the Napo-

leonic wars, and led to some misunder-
standings. Let me say at once that
the tale of the youthful Grenadier, dis-
tracted by her coquetries, who sought
solace in the cannon's mouth at Water-
loo is a pure fabrication. I have been
privileged to read the correspondence
of this young man with Miss Callender,
who was then distributing the first-
fruits of her girlish sympathy for lonely
soldiers. His letters are respectful, hers
were doubtless tender; he dreams of
promotion to corporal, she is just
putting up her hair; he swells with
ardour, she with pride; it was a little
comedy which had no unhappy ending,
for he came home safely and married
someone else. Miss Callender told me
this with a sigh perhaps of regret, per-
haps of relief, more probably of excuse
for her later affairs with the sergeant-
major of Hussars, the bandmaster of
Militia, and the lieutenant of Marines,
who succeeded one another in her
favour during the ensuing years.
No doubt these were brave and pro-
per men, who in warlike days would
have made an excellent match for any
girl; but to the mind of our village,
settling down to the long years of
Peace, they were no more than fine-
feathered strutting players. Their pro-
spects certainly were poor, and Miss
Callender could never bring herself to
take one of them ; though, when it
came to parting, a line of gold braid or
a new cocked hat still held her captive
heart. So the 1820's and 1830's slipped
past, sadly transforming her from a
girl “always running after soldiers”
into an old maid “who ought to know
better, at her age.”
These last terrible words were very
generally pronounced during the Crim-
ean campaign, when the romantic
nature of Miss Callender, careless of a
lapse of years which had brought her
to whatourneighbours call l’age critique,
was rekindled by the flame of war.
She threw herself with enthusiasm into
the task of knitting comforts; her
letters to lonely soldiers once again
encumbered the outgoing mail-bags,
and it is said that she claimed the sole
residue of affection (for he left her
nothing else) of a quartermaster who
fell at Inkerman. However this may
be, it is certain that most of the ground-
less reflections upon her character date
from the Crimean epoch; and in assert-
ing for the rest of her life that “Lord
PALMERSTON had much to answer for ”
she was perhaps not oblivious of per-
sonal concerns.
Thanks to the little inquiry whose
results I have made known, the close
of the South African War found her
already beginning to assume the halo
of propriety suitable to her age; and in
1914, when Kitchener's army was
billeted upon us, she was able to offer
sage advice to the maidens of the village
regarding the folly of forming entangle-
ments with the troops. To these warn-
ings, coming from a lady of wide ex-
perience, due weight was always given;
but I prefer to remember that when a
marching column went down the vil-
lage street a handkerchief was gener-
ally seen to flutter behind the window
of Miss Callender's parlour.

BRIGHT BITS FROM THE BALTIG.
(As seen in the columns of any daily,
any day.)
REDS LOOKING BLUE
FALL or RussiaN CAPITAL IMMINENT.
PETRog RAD I’ETRIFIED.
(From our Special Correspondent,
Mr. DollfoNDEY MUTT.)
Reval, Friday.
IT is probable that the army of
General YUDENITCH will capture the
city at an early date, if it did not do
so last week or even earlier, for it is
now definitely in the possession of the
line Tenschine, Asuwere and Stanatese.
The caviare-rolling plant at Bac-Kache
(pronounced" backache") fell to YUDEN-
Itch yesterday amidst scenes of inde-
scribable emotion.
The representative of the British
Military Mission at Bac-Kache, Major-
General Worthington, stated yesterday
| that he did not see how the Bolsheviks
were to get out of Petrograd witheut
loss, unless they simply left it. In an
case the Finns, who have abolished the
vodka control and declared for a free
Russia, are advancing on Petrograd
from the south-east and may take Bug-
berg any day, thus cutting off the Reds
from the railway and Hotpotsk. Asked
whether YUDENITCH would be able to
hold Petrograd if he should take it,
General WoRTHINGTON said he did not
know. When his views were requested
on the moral of the Bolshevik forces he
said he had not got any. The greatest
significance is attached to these admis-
sions in White Russian military circles.
Public opinion in Esthonia, which
until recently has been against YUDEN-
ITCH, is now undergoing a change, and
a large section of the population, in-
cluding the inmates of the lunatic
asylum at Reval, are in his favour. A
pro-Ally demonstration took place at
Ikupsk on Saturday, the people march-
ing through the streets yodelling, pre-
ceded by Ujars swinging the lead.
It is reported that the Bolshevik force
under Commissaries Bodkin and Push-
kin, which was surrounded in Pskoff
and was let go by the Finns, has now
been polished off by the Letts, and the
survivors finished by the Poles.
RUSH ON RIGA.
LETTS HAVI: A BATTLE.
(From our Special Correspondent,
Mr. Borh.(M. STIFF.)
- Riga, Friday.
According to a telegram received
here last night, Herr Schweinhaus (late
of the Wolff Bureau) informed the Reich-
stag on Wednesday that General voN
DER GoLTz had telegraphed stating that
he would do anything in reason, but
that he would not go home. General
voN DER GoLTZ also pointed out that
he was not the Von der Goltz from
Turkey or the one from Whitechapel,
London; and, in view of the confusion
that seemed to exist on the subject, he
would not be responsible for any debts
unless personally contracted.
The Germans have now been finally
driven out of Riga. Two Latvian field-
guns were galloped into the eastern
suburbs on Sunday, and, after shelling
the Esthonians, Rigans and BERMonT's
Russo-Teuton force until they withdrew,
they shelled each other until ammuni-
tion ran out.
Following the announcement last
week that Marshal Foch was leading
the Letts in Riga, the Reval correspon-
dent of the Zaniske Craziblad reports
a rumour received by telegram from
Stockholm that Earl HAIG is at Finnish
headquarters, wearing a false nose.
Colonel Litltitsch, the latest figure
in Baltic politics, is enrolling large
numbers of recruits from Von DER
Y|GoLTz's force, equipping them with
samovars and kromeskis and passing
them off as Russians. Colonel Litl-
titsch states that he is in agreement
with YUDENItch, but against the Esth-
onians, Letts, Allies and Bolsheviks.
IIe is not quite certain how he stands
with the other forces in the field at
present.
THE SPLIT INFINITIVE.
(From a Review of 1950.)
THE long-expected memoirs of Sir
John Smith, K.B.E., D.Litt., etc., “The
Literary Liberator,” have at last been
published and afford interesting read-
ing. To us who are accustomed to
split infinitives as one of the luxuries
of everyday literature, the tyrannical
restrictions of the past, against which
Sir John waged such patient and un-
tiring war, seem like some grim legend
of mediaeval barbarity.
In Chapter I. Mr. Smith (as he then
was) tells us how his interest was first
excited in the cause that was to be for
him a lifelong crusade, and from which
he was to at length emerge victorious
amidst the plaudits of the English-
speaking world. “I was convinced,”
he says, “that the best authors wrote
under a constant terror of infringing
the law. I felt how firm SHAKSPEARE
had to be with himself when the idea of
Hamlet's notorious soliloquy first struck
him; the temptation to say, ‘To be or
to not be,” must have been terrible.”
Mr. Smith's difficulties in the early
days of the struggle are described in
Chapter II. “I appealed to members
of the House of Lords,” he writes, “but
none of them had ever heard of the law.
It was the shocking injustice of a privi-
lege which allowed the nobly-born and
the politically-minded profiteer im-
munity from an incubus which hung
round the necks of the proletariat, toil-
ing with nothing but five hundred
pounds a year and unemployment al-
lowance between them and starvation,
that determined me to wholly and with
single purpose devote my life to the
ending of this scandalous abuse.”
Truly a noble passage.
The author's efforts in other direc-
tions were at first equally devoid of
Success.
The Labour Minister of the day, he
tells us, said he made a speciality of
pure English and failed to see the diffi-
culty; the Minister of Education ad-
mitted that he left it to his typist, while
the Foreign Minister repulsed him with
the simple statement that he was edu-
cated at Eton. -
The only encouragement that he re-
ceived was from a famous General, who
told our author to mind his own busi-
ness or he would not hesitate to damn
well wring his neck.
Undefeated, our author went to the
editor of one of the greatest daily
papers.
“Legitimatise the split infinitive' "
cried he, aghast. “I don't think. What,
and scrap the splendid article begin-
ning, ‘Before an audience more watch-
ful for split infinitives than critical of
profundity of argument,” etc., which
our readers look for when a Cabinet
Minister speaks at the Oxford Union.
“Rather,” he exclaimed with a fine
gesture, “perish our ‘crack-of-the-rifle-
on-the-moor' article, annual product of
the Glorious First, or is it the Twelfth?"
Still the good work went on, and
gradually light began to almost imper-
ceptibly dawn on the horizon. The
final passages of the book give a noble
instance of the decorum with which our
author wears his laurels. “It would be
false modesty,” he writes, “for me to en-
tirely disclaim credit for what I and my
collaborators have achieved, but many
things contributed to our success. The
movement towards open diplomacy and
the publication of ambassadorial corre-
spondence helped us greatly, while the
writing of books by great admirals and
generals accustomed the reading public
to a greater freedom of speech and pro-
ãº a tempered atmosphere in which
our propaganda could take root. With-
out their help all our efforts might have
been in vain.”
So ends the noble record of a great
work in the cause of freedom.
Let us hope that we who reap the
reward will never allow ourselves to
quite forget the indomitable efforts of
those who won us the liberties we now
take with the English language.

THE COLOUR-SCHEMERS.
I FULLY intended, had I been invited,
to read a paper to a scientific associa-
tion on the Influence of Decorative Art
on the Emotions. Our house has been
a sort of psychological laboratory, so to
speak, and our visitors as well as our-
selves the more or less unconscious
media of interesting mental phenomena.
As chief alchemist, Cicely is responsible
for all arrangements and, I suppose, for
most of the results.
Our breakfast-room-cum-study is all
flowery chintzes and stripes. Wall-
paper, carpet and cushions are a horti-
cultural dream; Kew Gardens a barren
wilderness in comparison. To correct
the intoxication of the senses induced
by this extravagance of floral decora-
tion, vertical and horizontal lines are in-
troduced into the patterns, giving a kind
of geometric stability. They set latitude
and longitude to the botanic Utopia, as it
were. The mental effect of this, Cicely
and I agree, is a feeling of freshness
| and vigour. I leave the breakfast-table
to catch my morning train with my
| mind alert and ready for anything.
The Vicar calls occasionally when he
is bent on philanthropic piracy. Should
he be shown into the drawing-room (a
cheerful orange), all is lost, and the
most impracticable charity is richer by
my guinea; if I see him in the dining-
room, amid its soft hanging lamps
and rich Oriental draperies, my moral
backbone turns to jelly and I weakly
subscribe more than I ought to the
Fund for the Preservation of the Sites
of the Early Churches in Pamphylia
and Cappadocia. Therefore I always
inveigle the Vicar into the study. There
the stripes and chintzes seem to stiffen
my moral fibre and enable me to offer
him a kind but firm refusal.
Conversely, when I had enticed our
landlord into the house the other
week, I escorted him into the drawing-
room. Its yellow mirth took him off
his guard and he became cheerful and
chatty. He told a story, at which
we laughed heartily. Then I showed
him the rocky side-entrance through
which I had to bring my motor-cycle,
and the spot where an admirable shed
could be built. Observing that his
cheerfulness was wearing off, I led him
back to the dining-room. Its insidious
Orientalism stole over him and robbed
him of his will-power. This was the
place and moment for the attack. My
fear was not that he would resist my
proposals, but that my own courage
would evaporate amid the hypnotic
colour tones of the surroundings.
Quickly I demanded that he should
tar-pave the side entrance and build
me a cycle-shed. He was clay in the
hands of the potter and would have
consented to twice as much.
Unfortunately Cicely in a spasm of
jubilation carried him off to see the
breakfast-room chintzes, and he re-
covered. He pointed out that we had
driven a nail into the wall to hang up
a plaque. And before he left he had
given me distinctly to understand that
if he let me have my tar-path and cycle-
shed he would be obliged to raise the
rent by one pound per quarter.
I told Cicely (in the breakfast-room)
that it was all her fault, and we might
have quarrelled about it; but when we
talked it over in the glow of the draw-
ing-room we grew quite light-hearted
again.

THE EconoMY CAMPAIGN.
THE NEW ELIXIR.
(For senile decay try our Monkey Gland).
THERE was a time when friends expressed their wonder,
Perhaps with just a modicum of truth,
That at an age when many men go under,
Or lose the charming attributes of youth,
I, who had almost compassed DAVID's span,
Had not in second childhood merged the man.
They saw my gracefulness of locomotion
And marvelled how my years could stand the strain
I put upon them in my weird devotion -
To toilsome pastimes, thinking in their train
My labours must bring something hard to bear,
Though doing them I never turned a hair.
And, more, they praised me for the transcendental
Ability with which I plied my pen,
And showed eternal freshness in a mental
Dexterity denied to other men;
And still they gazed and still the wonder grew
That I should have what Nature gives so few.
Those days are past: a new elixir vitae
Has been extracted from a simian gland,
And since by Science Age is rendered mighty
My friends will deem my vigour second-hand,
And compliments will take this doubtful shape:
“He must have tapped a special brand of Ape.”
THE CONTRIBUTOR.
HE was a lanky moon-faced boy from the back-veld—had
not been lassooed more than a month, I should say—and
he gazed round my South African editorial office with
interest and wild-eyed concern. It seemed as though at any
instant he might leap down the lift-shoot or try to eat a file.
I sought to put him at ease in my gracious sympathetic
way, and I was rewarded.
“My farrer's a writer too,” he said suddenly.
“Indeed. Writes in Dutch, I suppose?”
“No, he didn't been a Dutsman already.
Duts, but my farrer's er Engelsman.”
He did not seem to have taught his son much English,
but one meets cases in the back-veld where the children of
an English parent hardly know the language.
“What paper does he write for 2 " I asked.
“Punts.” -
“Punch / " I exclaimed. “This is remarkable. Does he
write much 2"
“Yes, he p'raps writes something eats week, wort he
calls his horby. He starts in 1915 en sends him a funny bit
wort he cut out of a Cape Town papers. So Punts writes
something underneath and puts it in. Then my farrer gort
werry gled, an' now eats week he sends Punts a story or a
poetry.”
“Do they put them all in 2"
“No, he didn' put in any more yet.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Wednesday, October 22nd.—Alarmed,
no doubt, by newspaper placards an-
nouncing “Parliament on its Trial,”
Members attended the reopening of
the House of Commons in unusual
numbers. “Thrift, thrift, Horatio"
was the motif of nearly all the Questions
on the Paper. Minister after Minister
was interrogated as to the reductions in

typed reply to the effect that, whereas
at the Armistice the staff numbered so
many thousands, it was now some
hundreds less, and would
by next year be approach-
ing vanishing-point. The
ardent economists below
the Gangway were not en-
tirely satisfied with these
replies, and were evidently
inclined to regard the pro-
mise of the WAR SECRE-
TARY and CHANCELLOR of
THE Exchequer to “lay-
papers" as a device for
putting them off the -
scent. Captain REGINALD ſº

Next to “Hang the KAISER" and

receiving any cash from Germany, we
have just paid her three-quarters of a
million for a mass of potash. Sir ERNEST
WILD made a powerful appeal to Coal-
itionists to secure the redemption of
the third of their pledges by passing
his proposal that no employer should
be allowed to engage more than 25 per
cent. of aliens. A majority of the
Coalitionists present supported him;

THE PARLIAMENTARY PAPER-CHASE.
[Several White, Papers have been issued by the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExcHEQUER and the WAR SECRETARY showing the extent of Ministerial
retrenchments.]
The Ex-Lord ChancELLOR has one
great merit, rare among his Peers:
you can hear every word he says.
From his opening description of Minis-
ters involved in “the mazes of a laby-
rinth from whose tortuous pathways
there is no escape,” to the final prophecy
of National Bankruptcy, when “the
waters of the Thames will wash de-
serted wharves and empty palaces,”
not a syllable escaped one.
To avoid this dreadful fate, it seems,
there are only three courses before us:
a general levy on capital, a special levy
on war-fortunes, or a ten-shilling in-
come-tax. The Peers did not seem so
perturbed at the prospect as I should
have expected. Perhaps they were
wondering whether the pension of an
~~w. le.
Ex-CHANCELLOR who had occupied the
Woolsack for a few months in 1915-16
would properly be considered a war-
fortune, and if so at how many thou-
sands the orator would be assessed.
It is not accurate to say that the
Government have made no efforts in
the direction of economy. The fleet of
motor-cars now used in connection with
Government Departments throughout
the country has dwindled to a mere
four hundred—a number that not so
long ago would have barely sufficed to
take the officials of the Air Ministry
out to luncheon.
The Commons resumed
the discussion of the Aliens
Restriction Bill. The atti-
tude of the Labour Party
was a little difficult to fol-
low. They resisted the
proposal to prevent alien
Trade Unionists from in-
terfering in the industrial
disputes of other bodies
than their own with such
vehemence that Mr. Bot-
TOMLEY was moved to in-
quire whether the supply
of native strike - leaders
was giving out. Yet a little
later Mr. BRACE was de-
nouncing no less loudly a
provision by which in cer.
tain circumstances alien
pilots might be employed
in British ports. The gen-
eral feeling of the House
appeared to be that the
channels of trade, whether
by sea or land, were best
kept free from foreign in-
fluences; and in the ulti-
mate division Ministers,
opposed by an ad hoc coin-
bination of the so-called
“classes” and “masses,”
found themselves in a
minority of seventy-two.
On learning of this re-
verse the PRIME MINISTER is said to
have remarked that, when he recently
urged Capital and Labour to “get to-
gether,” he did not mean in this way.

THE EMANCIPATION OF YOUTH,
A LARGE and influential meeting,
convened by the League of Minors,
was held last Saturday in Hyde Park
with a view to the repeal of the statute
which excludes persons under twenty-
one years of age from Parliament. Mr.
Oswald Mosley, the youngest M.P.,
who presided, began with a frank ad-
mission of his unworthiness to occupy
the position of chairman. He was
already in the sere and yellow leaf, but
his sympathies were entirely with those
who were agitating for this great and
salutary change. With a full heart he
could echo the saying of SHAKSPEARE,
“Age, I do abhor thee.”. What they
wanted was to make Parliament the
nursery of greatness, instead of being
the charnel-house of ossified and cada-
verous nonentities. Old age was never
good; it was only green in the sense
of being mouldy and moss-grown. It
was suspicious, unheroic, garrulous and
miserly. As DisRAELI said, “Almost
everything that is great has been done
by youth.” And again, “The blunders
of youth are preferable to the triumphs
of manhood or the success of old age.”
Literature unſortunately abounded in
disparagement of the young, but, on
the other hand, the world was not run
by literary men.
Mr. ANTHoNY AsquitH, in moving the
main resolution in favour of reducing
the age - limit of Parliamentary re-
presentatives to fourteen, sounded a
note of caution. He did not think they
were yet ripe for Baby Suffrage. Some
of those present might even describe
him as an anti-Montessorian, and he
was not prepared to affirm in all
respects his entire adhesion to that
remarkable creed. Minors were er ipso
facto in the minority; but, on the other
hand, an eminent Victorian had boldly
pronounced the majority to be mostly
fools. Profoundly convinced as he was
of the righteousness of democracy, he
could not subscribe to this sweeping
condemnation. He did not advocate
the extermination of the old, however
painlessly it might be effected. Old
men, where they deserved it, were en-
titled to consideration. But the Ship of
State would never reach the haven of
happiness and prosperity until they had
outh at the prow instead of relegating
it to the menial duties of the cabin-boy.
Miss DAIsy Ashford, who seconded
the resolution, described herself as an
extinct volcano, enjoying what was
virtually a posthumous reputation on
the strength of the achievement of her
childhood. Properly encouraged at the
time, she might have followed up The
Young Visiters by a series of vital
romances; but the tradition of that
period was too strong. By enlarging
the horizons of youth and giving it
earlier scope for its creative activities
they might prevent the recurrence of
such a tragedy. At the present moment
all that was noteworthy in letters and
art and music was being done by the
young.
Lord BIRKENHEAD, who followed, ob-
served that he had been called the Boy
Chancellor, and, like Mr. Verdant Green
on a festive occasion, he was “prou’
title.” Under the system which they
now were met to introduce he might
have earned it many years sooner. This
was a saddening thought, yet they must
not repine, but rather push on to the
goal with renewed energy and determ-
ination. For himself he had no inten-
tion to linger superfluously on the scene
once he was conscious of any decline

to the humiliation of endeavouring to

Mr. EDMUND GossE said that fathers

to a share in the government of the

the triumphs of conquering adolescence,

age was that it brought second child-

To be there than you.
THE CALL.
THAT morning the camp was startled by a call.
Something of the stir of the Reveille sounded in its first
tentative notes, giving way to the gentle persuasion of the
Fall In. The cheerfulness of the “Cook-house Door” had
hardly succeeded when the clarion certainty of the old
Cavalry Charge call thrilled the morning air.
It did not stop there. For one and all it had a personal
message to deliver, and an urgent one. There was that in
it that made the Company Cooks think they might have
put more sugar in the tea lately, that made the Quarter-
master recall in despairing remorse the good food that had
never reached the troops, the garments they had never
worn. His clerk bent over the accounts he was trying to
square and strove vainly to hide his tears. The Orderly
Sergeant shakily decided not to bring Jones up on that
crime after all, and broke down altogether upon hearing
an agitated C.S.M. say “Please” to his batman.
The Post Orderly had no doubts. It was the Letter Call,
and he departed with an unusual springiness. The Mess
Orderlies were already falling in; the Fire Picket could be
observed doubling up from divers occupations; Orderly
Sergeants and Sergeant-Majors were positively sprinting;
their call, they conceived, had been “at the double.” Tents
could be observed in a state of violent agitation as their
inmates made frantic last-minute touches to buttons and
belts, while wild hazards about Guards of Honour and
General Parades floated therefrom. The experts, the spare
buglers, stood aghast.
A low crooning that succeeded a phrase suggesting that
“Officers' wives have puddings and pies” turned the
thoughts of the company officers from fantastic ideas of an
early luncheon to the sudden certainty that a disastrous
calamity was upon the camp. They turned pale in the effort
to remember what particular crisis this unfamiliar summons
might signify. Nobly they strode forth, all unprepared.
The C.O.'s nerve broke at last at an effort that suggested
“Danny Deever,” with perhaps a faint touch of The
Last Post, and yet combined the glories of the Regimental
March Past with the slow beauty of the Cavalry Reveille.
Further, there was in it one wild persistent note that never
a military bugle had sounded before, something that aspired
blindly to better things, not of the army.
“The Mutiny of the 's over again,” he muttered
hoarsely, and looked round for the support that was not
forthcoming; Officers, Sergeant-majors, N.C.O.'s and men
had long obeyed the call. He sallied forth to do something
with them, and tried desperately to think what.
Then the bugler blew again, emitting a cry of the heart
so piercing, so awful, that everybody stood to attention as
though the Birkenhead was sinking again. But he ended
on one sustained note of glorious triumph and then walked
calmly on to the parade ground.
Thence, with a magnificent gesture, he flung back his
bugle to the Buglers' Tent and turned to the expectant
throng.
“I’m demobbed,” he said. “Dis-miss / "
In a Good Cause.
Mr. Punch begs leave to remind his readers of the appeal
that he made last week on behalf of Bart's, and to ask
that donations may be sent to the fund which he is raising
in aid of London's oldest hospital. They should be addressed
to the Secretary of Punch, 10, Bouverie Street, Whitefriars,

THE STATE OF THE STAGE.
IMPORTANT OPINIONS.
THE state of the Stage continues to
be one of the thousand questions of the
hour, among them being the high price
of clothes and their substitutes, the cost
of living generally, the shortage of coal,
and the origin of fogs, which some
pessimists ascribe to the great number
of American plays now being performed
in London. Other prominent questions
include the economy campaign, the
winner of the Cambridgeshire and the
chances of Mr. Asquith ever finding
another seat. But, at any rate in cer-
historical plays for every theatre in
London.
Sir ALFRED BUTT says that the Stage
is at the moment in so flourishing a
condition that no wise manager need
worry about stopping a great success
in the middle of a run and substituting
a revival.
Sir SIDNEY LEE says that everything
is wrong with the Stage. With the
exception of the Old Vic and the Court
every theatre is disappointing and de-
grading. SHAKSPEARE should be played
continuously everywhere. Sir SIDNEY
does not say that all adventitious aid
should be withheld. He would not
has no fault to find with the Stage in
general, but wishes that at Drury Lane
it was larger. There were several effects
which he wanted in The Great Day,
but could not have on account of the
restricted space. One, for example, was
a scene depicting dawn, in which day
was to break and the pieces were to
be distributed among the audience as
SOllWell 11’S.
Mr. , SERGE DIAGHILEFF says that
what is wrong with the Stage is too
much talk and too little movement. If
only everything were done in dumb-
show and danced, the Stage would have
no detractors. He would like to have
tain circles, the state of the Stage
comes first, and few are the papers
so bold as to dispense with well-
known actors' views of the matter.
Mr. AINLEY, for example, in The
Evening News, finds nothing wrong.
Mr. Bourch iER, in The Daily E4'-
| press, even though gloomy to-day,
is aware of a bright light in the
future, when he produces Oliver
Cromwell, Mr. JoHN DRINKWATER's
masterpiece.
The list of actors who have
already rushed into print could be
extended, but, believing that it
would be more interesting to lay
new impressions before his readers,
Mr. Punch has secured the services
of several dramatic celebrities for
his own pages. In response to in-
quiries from one of his misrepre-
sentatives the following replies are
summarised:—
Mr. LESLIE HENson assures Mr.
Punch that there is nothing wrong
with the Stage. Quite the reverse.
It is the ideal environment in
which to win one's bride.
Mr. OSCAR Asch E also says that
there is nothing really wrong with
the stage. How could there be
when the public extends its patron-
TO
“I LL JUST HAVE A Look MYSELF AN' SEE
Moriil.R IS BRINGING ME UP IN THE WAY I ou GHT
G.O.”
his way with such a play, say,
as Home and Beauty. With the
scenery by the young geniuses of
the Mansard Gallery, and MAssiNE
in Mr. HAwTREY's part and KAR-
SAVINA in Miss GLADYs Cooper's,
he would guarantee both an artistic
and a financial triumph. Of course
the story would be rearranged.
There would be no return of the
first husband, no drawing lots, and
no cooking of the steak; but in
their place some very wonderſul
posturing, and twenty wreaths and
bouquets for each of the principals
every few minutes.
Mr. Punch's own opinion of the
Stage to-day—if he may intrude it
—is that it is both vulnerable to
criticism and entitled to be a little
proud of itself.
age to the best ? It speaks volumes
for the high level of taste and discrimina-
tion during the past few years that the
most popular play should be so intel-
lectual and courageous a production as
that at His Majesty's Theatre, which,
beginning simply as Chu Chin Chow,
has now reached such proportions as
to be more fittingly described as Double-
Chin Chow. It would always be a
matter of pride with him that during
its phenomenal run he had lost only
one camel. No, Mr. Asche concludes,
there is nothing wrong with the Stage.
Mr. HERBERT TRENch expresses doubt
as to whether the Stage is what it should
be. The tendency to produce musical
comedy and farce on week - days and
confine serious drama to the Day of
Rest disturbs him not a little. He is
open, he says, to write epoch-making
quarrel with musical accompaniments,
gorgeous scenery and so forth, so long
as SHAKSPEARE was the basis. He
would, however, draw the line at re-
entitling the plays. With the manager
who wished to produce The Merchant
of Venice as The Voice from the Cam-
panile he had no sympathy, nor would
he allow Antony and Cleopatra to fol-
low the present Haymarket success as
Mummies. As a pure business proposi-
tion it would be wise to put on SHAK-
SPEARE at every theatre. Since people
must go to the theatre, it is a corollary
that, if there were nothing but SHAK-
SPEARE they would go to SHAKSPEARE.
SHAKSPEARE would then prosper, espe-
cially as there would be no author's
fees to pay.
Mr. Louis N. PARKER says that he
“MILK DURING THE STRIKE.
HOW WIMBLEDON GOT ITS SUPPLY.
The previous day they thought they
never would get any at all, and finally
they had to take the bull by the horms
and practically steal it.”—Local Paper.
The bull seems to have been cowed.
“Dr. Fisher made a defence of his
1F | Education Act in addressing a gathering
of local educationalists this afternoon.
Economy, he said, consisted not in the
absence of spending, but in the presence
of waste.”—Daily Paper.
No wonder the other FISHER says,
“Sack the lot '''
“While at her moorings in Blyth Harbour
a submarine was fouled by another submarine,
and sank. Only one seaman was abroad, and
he escaped.”—Evening Paper.

(By lſr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
VAIN to a degree scarcely credible in so big a man, intol-
erant of opinions other than his own, appraising everyone,
from the late KING EDwARD downwards, according to
whether he “backed me" or not, guilty of frequent and
flagrant lapses of taste and fairness (not to mention gram-
mar), and continually harping on the string, “I told you
so,” Lord Fisher would have no one but himself to blame
if his Memories (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) were to widen
the already too large circle of his enemies. Yet, despite
all its faults and excesses, I fancy the volume will bring
him more friends than foes; for it is a portrait, self-
painted with the broadest of brushes, of a Man, and one
to whom his country owes more perhaps than to any other
single individual. But for the British Navy the War
would not have been won, and but for Lord FISHER the re-
distribution of the Fleet, by which, in MAHAN's phrase,
eighty-eight per cent. of England's guns were pointed at
Germany, would not have been carried out in time for Arma-
geddon. From one of the many indiscretions which only
Field-Marshals and Admirals of the Fleet may commit with
impunity one learns that, if the author could have had his
way, he would have “Copenhagened" the German Fleet in
1907, and one cannot help speculating on what would have
been the present position of this country in the eyes of the
world if he had been allowed to do so. This is the most
startling of the many pieces of secret history revealed or
hinted at in this volume. But in truth there is not a
dull page, and whether Lord FISHER is discussing naval
strategy or excusing (without complete success) his part in
the Dardanelles affair, or telling us how he taught a Grand
Duchess to waltz, he is always as lively as a schoolboy. If
he wants a sub-title for the second edition which will in-
evitably be demanded, I beg to suggest “The Midshipman
Who Never (quite) Grew Up.”
Oughtn't somebody to break it gently to Mr. John GALs-
worthy that there is a peace on ? I ask because to open
his latest story, Saint's Progress (HEINEMANN), is to find
yourself plunged into all the perplexities of the dark years,
some of which one had begun to hope had slipped behind
us. Chiefly, here is a book about the problem of the
gently-nurtured unmarried mother, and you will not need
telling what blend of sympathy, of resolute unprejudice and
rather grim tenderness Mr. GALsworthy brings to its treat-
ment. It is into the refined, delicately-reared household of |
the Rev. Edward Pierson that the tragedy breaks, when
his daughter, Noel, refused permission for what seemed in
paternal eyes a war-marriage of indecent haste, determined
to follow her own promptings, with the result inevitable in
fiction. The unmarried father is killed, and the tale shows
a group of eminently characteristic Galsworthians facing
(and discussing) the situation. They talk sanely, imparti-
ally, most of them with a strong modernity of outlook,
almost all considerably too much. And out of their talk
emerges gradually the one figure of real tragedy, the broken
old father, assailed in his deepest convictions, his preju-
dices, his whole system of life. Mr. GALsworthy has done
nothing more poignant than this. For the rest, as I have
hinted, Saint's Progress prescribes very effectually the
mixture as before, showing its author struggling with
obvious effort against a conception of social conditions that
has advanced very little since the days of The Fairchild
Family. There is, for instance, a scene of the heroine
taking a poor woman with a hurt hand into a swagger
chemist's, and their reception by its haughty patrons, that,

as a picture of life in first-aid days, is frankly farcical. Still,
a clever and well-written book, if hardly exhilarating.
To the yellow heart and the two jolly Cupids which make
the paper wrapper of The Disturbing Charm (Hodder AND
Stoughton) look like a valentine, Miss “BERTA RUck”
ought really to have asked her publishers to add a legend
warning the public that the contents are “for the
young.” If ever novel was written which drew a black
unswerving line between the fogeys who do not live and
the very young people who do, it is this pleasant senti-
mental story of four pairs of lovers, luckier in the matter
of travel than most of us were (for the ladies at least had
no pressing reason to be there), who met during the War
at an hotel in Western France and, after some slight hesi-
margins and excellent press-work, I found also (to my
chagrin) the legend, “Printed in America.”
Edward Wyndham Tennant (LANE) is the latest volume
in a lengthening list of such appreciations, outcome of
love and sorrow for the heroic dead. I will confess that I
have at times wondered whether these tributes had not
better have been reserved for their eyes only to whom the
loss recorded is a personal one. But again (and especially
in the present instance) I have doubted, in face of the
thought that no one could read this story of a short life
without taking courage from its fineness, and from the
knowledge that this is still the inheritance of our race.

tation and confusion, set to

among the others the sup-
posed love-charm, which seems
to have such great effect and
turns out afterwards to have
been a practical joke, is much
too nice a little creature for
the self-assertive Canadian,
Captain Ross, to whom she
is assigned; and I don't really
imagine that she did live as
happily ever after as her crea-
tor seems to believe. But best
of all I liked the widow, to
whom, until she lost it, the
charm appeared to attract the
Flying-man, the “eaglet-faced”

learns that the travellers, so far from being millionaires of
the accepted pattern, have to make a nice calculation of yen
and sen, and actually spend their last day in Yokohama
senless and hungry because their boat was a day late in
starting. A very charming picture is given of the
hospitality of the Japanese common folk and the wayside
innkeepers. As for the author's sense of style, the book is
something of a “curiosity of literature.” Quite simple
thoughts are wrapped in roomy veils of grandiloquence.

chose to pretend that it did not exist. Clear explanations
might have saved a lot of trouble, yet nothing could really |
save Jimmy from paying for the mistake he had made. We
suspect Blanche from the very first, and the way in which
Mr. LYNCH leads us on from suspicion to certainty shows
him a master of technique. Apart from the leading charac-
ters we are introduced to some people in one of the new
Government War departments who must, I think, be drawn
from life. For I am inclined to feel that at present Mr.
LYNCH's powers of observation are greater than his imag-
inative gift.

A HOME OFFENSIVE.
“Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime.”
WHEN I address my civil wits
To read the Lives of Men of War
(The papers quote the plummier bits,
A service I am grateful for);
When I review their multiplex damnations
Of Jacks-in-office, prone to err,
This endless stream of turbid revelations
Impinging on the Powers That Were;—
(And, mind you, all has not been told;
There's talk of scandals yet to come;
I could—but won't—myself unfold
Tales that would make Whitehall to hum ,
Feebler would grow its appetite for dinner,
And redder yet would burn its ears
If I consented to expose the inner
History of the Volunteers);-
When I survey what serves the Bosch
For sustenance in lieu of meat,
And mark the laundry-men that wash
Our dirty linen in the street—-
Staggered afresh with each appalling blunder
Unmasked by these, the Mighty Four,
I put myself the question how in thunder
We ever came to win the War?
I rather think there must have been
A certain ſew, the silent sort,
Who went about their work unseen
Nor made of it a loud report,
Nor hinted how much better they'd have done it
Had fools but understood their aims,
But simply took the War in hand and won it—
And I should like to know their names. O. S.
LOCAL COLOUR.
I wrote recently to a leading London daily on a matter
of public interest.
The paper in question, while printing the greater part of
my letter as I sent it, added a tag representing its opinions
rather than mine, and then appended my name.
I have below indicated the probable result if this course
were generally followed by organs of public opinion.
(Original letter.)
SIR,--I write to protest against the suffering inflicted on
our pets by these horrible muzzles. My precious Tiny is
developing a bare patch on his nose, caused by the constant
rubbing of the wire.
Can no ingenious scientist evolve an equally efficient but
less cruel instrument 2 Yours faithfully, CYNophil.
(As it might appear in The T–s.)
SIR,--I write to protest . . . rubbing of the wire.
It is doubtless due to the incompetent nincompoops of
the Board of A that this atrocity is perpetrated.
Sack the lot . . .
(The M–g P−t.)
SIR,--I write to protest . . . rubbing of the wire.
If the Government would devote its attention to this
matter of real importance, rather than to harrying the loyal-
ists of Ulster, a remedy would soon be found. . . .
(The D–ly M-l.)
SIR,--I write to protest . . . rubbing of the wire.
The wire wasted on these instruments of torture could
be more profitably used in making mouse-traps or wire-
sieves. OUR MONEY Is BEING wasTED. . . .
(The D–y N–s.)
SIR,--I write to protest . . . rubbing of the wire.
Our misguided Government, not content with starving
German babies, tortures dumb animals. Were we allowed
freely to import the vastly superior German muzzles all
would be well. . . .
(J–n B–ll.)
SIR,--I write to protest . . . rubbing of the wire.
If your valuable paper will collect further evidence and
ventilate the matter it will soon be put right. I know
your power for good. . . .
HINTS TO YOUNG FIUNTERS.
(Being the advice of a South African trader who writes from
the Native Territories.) -
I SEE in the papers there's a lot of young men going to
come to Africa nowadays to travel and get big game and
things like that. Now I been watching animals in the
veld all my life and I thought perhaps I could give a few
hints to young hunters which might save them their lives
one day.
For instance, when a rhinoceros shakes his ears, he is
very tired and just wants rest. You might go quite near
him then and he wouldn't want to do you anything. But,
when he blinks his eyes, beware. Get out quick, because
he can run. Mind you, a rhino got very small eyes and
you got to be pretty close to see him blink. Not many
living people seen a rhino blink. -
Rhinos don't eat men, like I read in one travellers' book.
They eat grass and simply trample men into the ground.
If you're near some elephants and one lifts up his trunk
you best get out smart, because he's got your scent. If
an elephant gets your scent he generally gets you. We old
hunters say if you see an elephant lying down you can go
and twist his tail and he won't mind. That's because no
man ever seen a wild elephant lying down.
I read in lots of travellers' books about how, if you
want to hear a long way, you put your ear on the ground.
Perhaps they can do this in travellers' books, but not on
the veld. All you're going to get if you try those tricks
is some dirt in your ear or else bit by something. If you
got a good Zulu boy, or better still a Hottentot, make him
do the hearing for you.
Don't go thinking you can make fires on the veld by
rubbing two sticks together, because you can't. Those
things you get in travellers' books too, as easy as striking
a match, but I only seen a few Swahili people do it up East,
where they got funny wood. I never seen any South
African boys able to, not even Korannas, who are pretty
smart people. You take matches.
If you're going to shoot any leopards just make sure you
kill them first go. There aren't so many living men shot
twice at the same leopard.
There's plenty more hints like that I could give. One
good one is, Don't you go reading those travellers' books.
From the report of a boxing match:-
“Becºming groggy, the referee intervened and stopped the bout
in —'s favour.”—Sunday Paper.
Should referees be teetotal? The answer is in the affirmative.

- Wife (to returned golfer). “Do You LIKE THE soup, DEAR–oR ARE You STILL PLAYING BADLY”
SNATCHCORK.
“HAve you ever heard of 'Snatch-
cork’?” asked Frederick.
“If he's a man,” answered Percival,
“I met him at Etaples in '17; if it's a
patent medicine, my Aunt Catherine
used to give it to me every morning
when I was a kid; but if it's a new
temperance drink I never heard of it.”
“It's none of them. It's a game.”
“Why couldn't you say so before?”
said Percival crossly.
“Because, my sunny cherub, you
never asked me. I asked you. I've
just been taught it by a real Staff-
Captain, and I'm going to introduce it
into Mess to-night. Most frightfully
nervy game, he says it is. They had to
prohibit it during the War on account
of its demoralising effect.”
“What's the drill?” yawned Percival.
“It's a combination of beggar-my-
neighbour and St. Vitus' dance. If
there are six players you put five corks
on the table; then, taking a pack of
Service playing-cards, you extract all
the aces, kings, queens, knaves, tens
and nines, and put the remainder on a
slow fire or any old where. By check-
ing my figuring you will find there
will be twenty-four cards—nines to
aces—in play. These are thoroughly
stirred—shuffled, I mean—and issued
in a ration of four cards per player.
Each player in turn then grasps his
cards firmly between the first finger
and thumb of his left hand and tries
to palm off a card he doesn't want on
his neighbour, the idea being to get a
collection of four aces, or four kings, or
four anythings of the same value. Got
me, bud?”
Percival passed his hand wearily
over his brow. “It goes like an A.C.I.”
“Good | Now, as soon as a player
has a complete set he just says no-
thing, but assumes an air of vacuity
and quietly takes a cork. Then everyone
else snatches for the other corks, and
the man who doesn't get a cork puts a
franc into the pool and drops out.”
“Well?” said Percival without en-
thusiasm.
“Well, after that you do it again
with only twenty cards, five players
and four corks—like musical chairs,
you know—till you get down to one,
and he scoops the pool. But it's de-
liriously exciting. The snatching makes
you so jumpy. The Dumpshires won't
let a man play without a certificate
from the M.O. that his heart is sound.”
That evening Frederick was posi-
tively scintillating. In addition to being
the pioneer of the new game he had
discovered absolutely the latest smoking
mixture, “Hookah Honey,” which, he
declared, “smoked as cool and sweet as
vanilla-icing and had an aroma like a
Persian rose-garden.” He circulated
his pouch lavishly before hostilities
commenced.
“Patrons an' gen’lemen all,” he said,
“before introducing this game to your
notice I might mention that my com-
rade, Percival, havin' been nine - fly
finalist of the Brigade and knucklebone
champion of the Battalion, can whisk
a cork off the table with such celerity
that spectators are apt to think that he
keeps his own troupe of trained corks.
Now, in order that there may be no
deception, I propose that we play with
marked corks taken from the bottles on
the sideboard.”
“Right you are!" said Binnie; “Cork,
Mark X, taken from the Major's bottle
of super-flavoured sulphuric acid and
cayenne - pepper; item, another cork,
marked O, from the Skipper's ration of
the same; two, branded respectively
F and P, from the soothing-syrup of
our esteemed brothers-in-arms; and
another, Z, identity and contents of
bottle unknown.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
“That's the count,” agreed Fred-
erick. “Now, my hearties, light up
the aromatic weed and let the play
proceed.”
The game was a huge success. It
went with verve and enthusiasm, ex-
cepting for an unfortunate interlude
when all the players claimed to be in
possession of a cork. However it was
found that Percival had only got the
top-joint of Binnie's forefinger, and he
was adjudged to be a loser. Eventually,
after many games, when the promoter
was several francs to the bad and the
players showed a disposition to grab at
nothing in particular, it was decided to
bring the entertainment to a close.
“Quite a decent rag, Freddy,” said
Signals. “And the baccy was a great
improvement on the medicated chaff
you've imposed on us lately."
“Right-o!” said the gratified Fred-
erick. “We'll just replace these corks,
to prevent evaporation, and toddle off
to bye-bye. Was the Major's the nearly
full or the half-bottle 2"
“Hanged if I remember,” said Binnie,
automatically snatching at a fly.
“Well, I'll give him the half-bottle,
although I'm probably sowing the seeds
of a lasting feud between him and the
Skipper. Percival, I'm a cork short,
and I suspect you. Hand it over.”
Percival's dignity had been ruffled
by events earlier in the evening.
“It's my cork, won by lawful con-
quest,” said he, having been victor in
the final spasm. “I refuse to hand it
over at your bidding.” -
“Give it to me. It's from my bottle,
an' it's putting temptation in my wa
to leave it out.” -
“I shall return it,” said Percival, “at
my own time and place.” And so say-
ing he retired. .
Next morning Frederick awoke with
the consciousness of having achieved
two notable successes. It is not given
to everyone successfully to “produce"
a new tobacco and a new game on the
same evening. His elation however
was somewhat damped when the ap-
pearance of an orderly from Percival,
returning a tobacco-pouch found in the
Mess, reminded him that Percival had
also threatened to return a cork “at his
own time and place.” . A knowledge of
Percival's methods made him peep in-
side his teapot to see if the cork was
swimming on the surface; it also made
him carefully cut his breakfast-roll to
see if it had been inserted therein. But
nothing happened, and, seeing the Major
tapping his pipe for his after-breakfast
smoke, he determined to add to his
triumphs.
“I'd like your opinion on a new
brand I've got here, Sir," he said, prof-
fering his pouch.

TEIE SPORTSMAN.
I.—FISHING.
George is a gentleman—that sort of
gentleman on whose gentility no asper-
sions can possibly be cast. He is always
well-dressed, but never dressy. His
face is beautifully tanned. The state
of the weather or the season of the
year does not seem to bear any par-
ticular relation to the complexion of
George. I don't know when I admire
it most. It is very effective when you
catch sight of him hurrying through
a February fog to his office in the City,
but perhaps, after all, it sits most
naturally upon him when he is in
Scotland for his summer holiday, in his
well-cut coat of Harris tweed and the
rest of that distinctive tout-ensemble
that goes to make up George.
When he asked me to join him and
Archie in their fishing and shooting
holiday, I was at once flattered and
flabbergasted.
“Just a little rough shooting,” he
said, “and a very decent loch.”
“Of course I should love to come,”
I said tentatively, “but I'm afraid I
don’t shoot.”
“Don’t shoot ? Is that all? Well,
don't let that worry you. As a matter
of fact the shooting isn't very good.
It's the fishing.”
“But,” I ventured, “I can't fish—
at least I don't think I can. I've
never tried.”
“Then you'll come,” said George.
“Good. That's settled.”
It was settled; but I am not sure
that it was altogether good. Never
shall I forget the first fish that I got
on my line. It happened in this way.
I had been there about a week without
having noticed that the loch contained
anything more lively than weeds. I
was in the boat with George, who was
“ghillying ” for me, and we were drift-
ing before the wind. I had just suc-
ceeded in disengaging my fly from the
mahogany-coloured back of George's
neck and in making my next cast, when
a great swirl in the water attracted my
attention.
I remember thinking that it wasn't
quite the kind of splash that I was
accustomed to make when casting.
Then I heard the line whizzing off the
reel and I knew I had hooked a fish.
The brute dashed away at full speed
and then doubled back straight under
the boat. I was frightfully excited.
“What do I do now, George?” I
screamed.
George seemed a bit out of sorts and
answered shortly, “Keep him your own
side of the boat.”
I leant far over the side to see where
he had gone. The line was taut up
against the keel. I was aroused from
my contemplation by a chilly voice
which said, “If you don't look out
he'll bite your leg.”
I staggered to my feet and saw a
great and fearsome-looking monster
floundering at the bottom of the boat
and making what I took to be frantic
efforts to reach my calf.
“What in Heaven's name do I do
next 2 " I managed to gasp.
George rubbed the back of his neck
softly, thought for a moment and said,
“It’s a pretty nasty position to be in.
The fish jumped in by mistake while
you were looking the other way. The
only thing to do now is for you to dive
in with your rod, swim under the boat
and get in on the other side. That
will have the effect of disentangling
your line.”
Then, seeing that I hesitated, he
added sharply, “And don't waste any
time about it.”
Thus encouraged I took the plunge.
The water was icy. My rod, my line,
my two other flies and my breeches got

Once there I noticed with dismay that

I detected a smile hovering on his hand-

WHEN I first met Gideon he occupied
a small and remarkably inaccessible
office in the vicinity of Orange Street.
Gideon has gone up in the world since
then; indeed, his name is getting a
perfect nuisance on all the Tubes as
"presenting” this and that “by ar-
rangement with,” etc., etc. , Very few
people seem to do anything in the way
of theatrical productions without mak-
ing arrangements with Gideon.
Like all truly great men in the em-
bryo state, Gideon had his weaknesses,
and if he did practise a little harmless
deceit to impress the young idea in those
early days surely it has been justified
by his subsequent success? Under his
table and near the telephone he had a
little bell which could be rung surrep-
titiously by hand. Hardly had the bud-
ding playwright begun to pour forth his
tale to the sympathetic listener when
“ting-ting” would go the telephone
(apparently), and with a deprecatory
gesture Gideon would break off the
conversation and begin a sparkling
monologue with TREE or any other
imaginary speaker that his fancy dic-
tated; and for several minutes the as-
piring author would be enthralled with
the technicalities involved in the leasing
of theatres wholesale, the engaging of
stars at princely salaries, the negotiating
for unwritten plays by all the best au-
thors, and last, but certainly not least,
the mention that he had just come
across a particularly clever play by a
new author who was with him at the
moment.
It is not to be wondered at that when
he finally turned, with relief apparently,
to the interesting matter in hand, the
AEschylus sitting opposite him would
be ready to offer the world's rights of
his masterpiece on any terms in order
to keep in with the man who appeared
to be the hub of the theatrical world.
Yes, Gideon has got on, and yet he
is singularly unspoilt. A little more
portly, a little more urbane, a little
more brusque to his secretary—that is
all the difference that success has made
to him. He still greets me with the
old effusiveness, and it is impossible to
believe that it is fifteen years since I
first called upon him to hear his opinion
of my four-act play, Who Shall Testify 3
What a glorious time it was, sitting
comfortably in a straight-backed chair,
hearing one's own play “cast" with
practically every prominent actor and
actress of the day! I remember how
the first year we shook our heads doubt.
fully and wondered whether GEORGE
ALEXANDER, then in his zenith, “could
grateful, it still is
Every year I come back and there is
Gideon, still cheery, optimistic and ready
to sit down and re-cast my play with
the latest stars until, after a few minutes,
the office seems to fade and its place is
taken in my imagination by the spec-
tacle of a crowded theatre, a breathless
audience, and the eminent representa-
tive of The Times (relegated to the upper
circle owing to the crush) gripping on
to the sides of his seat with excitement
or mirth, or both.
“Ah, yes,” he will begin, and by his
comprehending manner I know that the
play has never really been out of his
thoughts since last year. “Ah, yes,
our play, Two in Trouble—no, no, Who
Shall Testify 2—as you say. Yes, we
must certainly do something about that.
Would it suit HAwTREy, do you think?"
I remind him that a version was
prepared especially for this actor eleven
years ago. “In some ways, you know,”
he goes on indulgently, “your play is
rather too clever. The public are rather
tired of comedy, farce or drama"—
whichever this particular version was ;
“they really want”—whichever the
play was not. “H'm, would it suit
BourchIER, do you think 2"
I express an opinion that no other
actor could do it greater justice, especi-
ally the version I prepared for him eight
years ago.
“Good, good. Let me see. What are

course, now I remember. The man's part

Excellent, don't you think? And MARIE
TEMPEST 2–no, I've just settled her
next two plays; but what about IRIs
HoBY, now 2 Yes, adapted, of course,
but if—” -
And so merrily we go on. Gideon,
I am sure, enjoys it as much as I do.
There is not an actor or actress of note
who has not at some time or another
appeared in my play. There have been
at least eighteen versions, each for a
particular cast and each adapted to
meet the trend of popular taste.
I begin to agree with a friend of
mine, who conscientiously read all the
eighteen versions during his three
months in hospital, that it should never
be produced. As it stands to-day it is
more than a mere manuscript; it is
history itself. By the records I have
kept of the casts suggested one can
trace the rise and fall of every star
within the last decade. See how youth
begins the gallant ascent, rising from
retrace their steps on the downward
grade, moving fitfully along by way of
“Mr. Smack, a solicitor in frock-coat
and black bag, etc.,” until they pass to
the great beyond by way of “John
enters with the coffee.” The meteoric
rise of OweN NAREs is shown vividly
by the fact that he passed in a single
year from “Tom, an undergrad in Nor-
folk jacket and brown shoes,” to “Jas-
per Marr, the somnambulistic hypo-
chondriac" himself; while Miss LöHR
leapt in a few months from “Priscilla,
a pretty girl of eighteen in love with
Tom,” to “Gloriana,” without ever
being cast for the intermediary parts
of “May and Ethel, school chums of
Gloriana's and much under her, in-
fluence.”
Production, I am convinced, would
kill the true value of the play by
reducing it to a stereotyped version.
Some day, when a three-year course
for playwrights is inaugurated at the
University, Who Shall Testify 2 will
be dragged into the light. Professor
GoLLANcz and other literary anatomists
will seize upon it, study it, dissect it and
pronounce it a technical masterpiece.
Then and not till then will the masterly
cleverness be made manifest by which,
with a few strokes of the pen, the whole
atmosphere of the play is changed in
order to suit this or that particular cast
and, what is still more subtle, this or
that particular cast under varying
shades of popular taste. Then and not
till then shall I receive just reward and
recognition for my work, and Who Shall
Testify 3 will be handed down as an
elementary text-book. -
Finally, then and not till then shall I
be able to pay the bill for typing, which
amounts, up to the present, to fifty-
seven pounds and elevenpence. L.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, October 27th.-The fact that
at the present rates of pay a miner need
work only twenty-five hours a week to
earn one hundred and thirty pounds a
year, helps to account for the fuel-
shortage. Chilly householders may,
however, be glad to know that the
Proceedings of the recent Coal Com-
mission will shortly be available to re-
plenish their cellars.
Many times during the last three
years Mr. Bonak LAW has been asked
to announce the members of the Cab-
inet, and has replied by giving the
names of the Big Five. This afternoon
he surprised the House by quickly reel-
ing off no fewer than twenty names,
including those of the new
Ministers of Labour and
Transport. There seems
no obvious reason why Mr.
GEORGE Roberts should
have been excluded; but
it is supposed that Mr.
L Lo Y D G E o R GE, when
drawing up the list, sud-
denly recalled the old nur-
sery-rhyme, and, exclaim-
ing, “Nineteen — twenty
—I've had plenty,” threw
down his pen.
The PostMASTER-GEN-
ERAL was startled to hear
an hon. Member appar-
ently inquiring whether
the ex - Kaiser was “in
constant telephonic com-
munication with this coun-
try." He was just about
to deny the absurd accu-
sation that anybody, ex-
Kaiser or not, could pos-
sibly, while the Post-Office maintained
its traditions, be in this privileged posi-
tion, when a colleague explained that
the words were “his country,” not
“this country.”
Seeing the PRIME MINISTER on the
Treasury Bench some Members jumped
to the conclusion that the Government
defeat last Thursday had convinced
him of the necessity of reverting to the
custom of his predecessors and being in
constant attendance at the House. Not
at all. He had merely looked in to
give his moral support to the LEADER
of the House while he unravelled the
tangled knot in the Aliens Restric-
tion Bill. And very deftly Mr. LAw did
it. After he had spoken, Coalitionists
who had voted against the Govern-
ment were loud in their declara-
tions that they had intended no slight
either to France or to His MAJESTY's
Ministers.
It has been said that Parliament

can do anything but turn a man into
a woman. The House of Commons
this evening, however, did its best to
turn women into men, by its amend-
ments to the Sex Disqualification (Re-
moval) Bill. In its zeal for uniformity
it went so far as to insist that a peeress
in her own right should be permitted
to sit and to vote in the Upper House.
As under the existing law she is also
eligible for the House of Commons, we
may ere long see a noble Stateswoman
flitting along the corridors to charm
the ears and eyes of Lords and Com-
mons alternately.
Tuesday, October 28th.-Lord CUR-
zoN came down rather heavily upon

Paper issued last August. Premising
(not very politely, perhaps) that other
noble lords were in a like condition of
ignorance, he made a long statement
regarding our relations with the present
AMEER. The gist of it was that we
had dropped the subsidy formerly paid
to His Highness's predecessors, and
with it the right to control his foreign
relations. As in practice these too often
proved uncontrollable I fancy the Gov-
ernment of India has made a good bar-
gain both ways.
Lord AMPTHILL complained that the
For EIGN SECRETARY had not com-
municated with Lord SYDENHAM instead
of inflicting upon him this “elaborate
rebuke; ” but Lord SYDENHAM himself
passed no comment upon the Minis-
terial statement, unless his apology
“for having wasted so much valuable
time” was intended to convey a subtle
depreciation of its value.

House when suddenly there was an
unwonted animation on the Treasury
Bench and a ripple of cheering from
all quarters of the House. The new
LoRD PRESIDENT of THE CouncIL had
quietly entered and taken his seat
among his colleagues. Strictly speak-
ing, I believe, he had no right there,
for his labours in Paris had prevented
him hitherto from taking the oath.
The House of Commons would, how-
ever, forgive a much greater sin on the
part of its most popular Member. The
cheers broke forth again when a little
later he advanced to the Table, took
the Oath, and once more wrote “ARTHUR
JAMES BALFour" in the Roll which has
contained that signature in eleven suc-
cessive Parliaments.
Remembering that Cole-
RIDGE, in his famous lines
about Cologne, includes
among its drawbacks “hid-
eous wenches,” I have al-
ways taken a good deal of
discount off the stories
that an epidemic of exotic
matrimony was devasta-
ting our Army of Occupa-
tion. Still it is pleasant
to learn on official author-
ity that the register of Co-
logne Cathedral contains
no record of any British
soldier of any rank having
married a German woman
since the Armistice.
The Government had
some awkward corners to
turn before it secured a
Second Reading for the
War Emergency Laws
(Continuance) Bill, a
measure designed to keep
D.O.R.A. on our necks for another
year. Mr. BonAR LAw," who, remem-
bering last week's upset, made plain-
tive reference to the difficulty of ex-
plaining a case so that the House of
Commons would understand it, declared
that if the Bill was not passed chaos
would ensue. Even that possibility left
Coalitionists rather cold. But, when he
added that in that event the Govern-
ment would regard it as a notice to quit,
the malcontents sat up and took notice,
with the result that the Bill passed its
Second Reading by a majority of 170.
Wednesday, October 29th. — The
House of Commons is, of course,
perfectly sincere in its desire for na-

Parliament were anxious to be told
that it was impossible, and were cor-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BonAR LAw said that the matter had
not yet been settled.
The official statement, recently issued,
showing that the deficit for the year,
estimated in the Budget at two hundred
and fifty millions, had now swollen to
four hundred and seventy-three millions,
had prepared us for the appearance of
the CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER
as a humble penitent, clad in a White
Paper, and prepared to seek vicarious
absolution for his own sins by inflicting
further pecuniary penalties upon the
rest of us.
What happened was quite otherwise.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, far from
being cast - down, was posi-
tively jaunty. At the very out-
set he relieved our apprehen-
sions by saying that no new
taxation would be necessary,
either this or next year, un-
less the House insisted on in-
curring further expenditure.
As for the War Debt of eight
thousand millions the mirac-
ulous operation of a half-per-
cent Sinking Fund would clear
it off in fifty years.
The CHANCELLOR's state-
ment, that months ago he had
instructed the Board of Inland
Revenue to explore the possi-
bilities of a levy on war for-
tunes, took most of the wind
out of the Opposition sails.
Sir DoNALD MACLEAN made
such play as he could with the
contrast between the CHAN-
CELLOR's optimism of to-day
and his pessimism in August,
when he declared that the coun-
try was “heading straight for
national bankruptcy.” Later
on Mr. HENDERSON and others
tried to bring the House back
to a becoming condition of
gloom, but without much vis-
ible success.
Thursday, October 30th.-Under the
new arrangement the LoRD LIEUTENANT
of IRELAND and his CHIEF SECRETARY
are alternative Members of the Cabinet,
by a sort of Boc and Cow arrangement.
To-day Cox was on duty, and he had
to undergo a severe cross-examination
regarding the present administration of
the more than ever distressful country.
Home Ruler though he is, he made it
quite clear that for the moment the
restoration of order is his chief concern,
and he roundly asserted that for the
long list of crimes recently committed
Sinn Fein and no one else was respon-
sible.
Mr. CLYNEs reopened the financial
debate with the best speech yet made
on the Opposition side. He gently
chaffed the Government for inviting
the House to support their proposals,
“however drastic,” for the improvement
of the financial situation, when as a
fact they were making no fresh pro-
posals whatever to that end. But he
did not spare his own colleagues, some
of whom were slow to appreciate the
necessity of increased production. A
reasoned and moderate appeal to the
Government not to exclude the levy on
capital from their proposed inquiry
ended a statesmanlike utterance which
fully justified Lord RoberT CECIL's
encomiums.
Otherwise there was not much force

in the Opposition criticisms. The
PRIME MINISTER evidently felt that he
had nothing to beat, and might kick up
his heels accordingly. For fifty minutes
he entertained himself and the House
with a series of pungent phrases, chiefly |
devoted to the outside critics who con-
fused pessimism with patriotism, and
thought a deficit worse than a defeat.
The cheers which greeted his peroration
were followed by persistent cries of
“Divide, divide l’’ and, though the

THE BOND.
“LIFE's rum, isn't it?” were the
first words Standish said as I took the
vacant chair beside him at the Club.
“In what particular?” I asked.
“In most,” he said; “as always. But
just at the moment I was thinking of
imperfect sympathies; I was thinking
of the long time it often takes to under-
stand some people; how one waits upon
the happy moment; and so on. When
I was at Winchester thirty and more
years ago there was a boy I rather ad-
mired. But I never quite got on with
him. He was reserved, and so
was I; he was a little senior
to me; he had a rather aloof
way with him. Sometimes we
seemed to be on the brink of a
complete understanding, and
then it all went wrong. Per-
haps the best way to put it is
that he attracted and repelled
almost equally; but one never
knew when the currents would
change. Anyway, we went
through our time at Winches-
ter without ever getting pro-
perly on terms, and I regretted
it then with some acuteness,
and have regretted it mildly
ever since.”
“Yes 2 ” I said.
“We never met after leaving
school,” he continued. “I
went to Oxford and he didn't,
and, except that I heard of him
at the Bar, I knew nothing of
him. For thirty years and more
—thirty-three, to be exact—I
had never seen him till —
Well, it was as long as that.”
He paused.
“You know the phrase,
It's
always cropping up in our
lives—a perpetually recurring
tribute to the way in which the more
distant and apparently irreconcilable
events are linked together. “How
little did I think ' ' You've said it to
yourself scores of times?”
“More like hundreds,” I replied.
“Yes, hundreds,” he repeated. “But
never have I said it with more astonish-
ment than this morning. I'll tell you.
You know my son?”
“The one who was lunching with
you the other day? "I asked. “The
sailor?”
“Yes, I've only one.”
“A nice frank boy I thought him,”
I said.

way, he's been having some leave, and

A LUNAR ECLIPSE.
A Most unfortunate thing occurred
the other night which threatens to mar
the impression that Simpson has for
some time been helping me to make
on his sister. She had accepted so un-
reservedly our account of other battle-
field exploits that there was nothing
at all to prepare us for what actually
happened.
“Then that night in Quelquelieu in
“It must have been awful,” she said.
“But I do wish you'd got under proper
cover instead of bothering about me.”
“It was pretty bad,” admitted Simp-l
son. He paused for a while, then added,
“You know, Dora's never been in an
air-raid.”
“Really, Miss Simpson 2"
It seemed almost a pity not to go
on, so I thought I would remember
having been fired on by a Bosch aero-
plane. I turned towards Archie. “You
moment. Whose idea was it, Archie,
that we should stand up to them and
pot them as they passed ?”
“Yours,” he said truthfully.
“Was it? I'd forgotten. Anyhow,
Miss Simpson, there might have been
about thirty of them, big fellows too,
coming round and round in a circle,
flying very low and shooting straight at
us.”
“Shooting at you on purpose?” she
asked with sympathy in her tone.

night, you know, when the
Bosch flew over in droves,
dropping bombs every-
where, and the narrow
squeak we both had. Have
you told her about that?”
“Oh, do tell me, Archie,”
she cried.
Simpson's garden-chair
creaked as he slightly
shifted his position.
“Oh, that night !” he
said, looking up at the
stars. “Yes, that was a
nasty business, if you like.
How many was it they

“Including the two duds.
We were having a little
dinner, you remember, in
that restaurant in the Rue
de l'Occident, to celebrate
your sister's birthday that
day.”
“Mine?” she asked, and
she seemed pleased. -
“Yes. We had just
ordered a bottle of cham-
pagne when the first bomb
fell about thirty yards off
— thirty-five, perhaps.
The cork and the bomb
went off one after the
other. I remember quite
well the contrast between
the two sounds; it was
most marked.”
“It was,” agreed Simp-
Urchin. “Oo—Look
'E's LETTING sonſ ETHINK OUT.”
“I'm afraid so. At
both of us, of course.
There was nothing really
personal about it.”
“But how could they
see you?" she pursued.
I hadn't thought of
that.
“The moon, my dear,
the moon,” pleasantly put
in her brother, doing his
best.
“How stupid of me,”
I explained. “I ought to
have told you. Well, we
took our stand on the
pavement with our backs
to the wall and drew our
revolvers, determined to
sell our lives dearly. Then,
hastily writing our last
messages to those we
loved, we counted our am-
munition and found we
had just thirty rounds
between us. But you
have to be very lucky, or
else a very good shot, to
bring down thirty planes
with thirty rounds, and
revolver rounds at that—
haven't you, Archie?”
“It's not easy,” he said.

have noticed that. I noticed it too.
You had the bottle, and you went on
filling the glasses as though nothing
had happened. And when you lifted
yours to drink to Dora I particularly
noticed how steady your hand was.
You didn't spill a drop.”
“Nor did you, you know,” I mur-
mured.
“I can't pretend I altogether liked
it," he went on, “the bombs, I mean.
But you, you never turned a hair. And
there was that Major fellow in the
corner, with the D.S.O. and bar, fidget-
ing all over.”
Miss Simpson leaned forward and
clasped her hands round her knees.

—shortly after, you know—when we
sauntered out thinking the worst of it
was over, and how they suddenly came
back and began machine-gunning the
streets. Tell her about that.”
“And the fight we had with them,
with nothing but our revolvers,” he
added, piling it on a bit.
“But how thrilling!” she cried rap-
turously. “Did you have to kill any
of them 2 '' -
There was no help for it.
“As your brother says,” I resumed,
“they came back and started machine-
gunning the street, as we were going
back to our billet. It was an anxious
Oh, yes. So we thought of laying our
sights on the moon and keeping our
fire till a Bosch aeroplane passed in
between.”
Aslightly suspicious sound came from
her way. Her voice, however, was
quite calm as she asked if we brought
any down.
“Of course, we couldn't actually
prove anything,” replied Archie, “but
certain things came out afterwards, and
an A.A. battery stationed quite close
claimed four machines in the morning.”
“They do that on principle," I ex-
plained.
“So you brought down four?” she
said.

NOW-AND THEN.
(The style of Mr. PHILIP GIBBs is so
infectious.)
To-DAY, as I went along the Barking-
Ilford Road in one of my touring cars,
there was nothing to show that, only
a month ago, this was the scene of a
grim struggle during the Great Strike,
a fight which raged without respite for
over a week. Our objective in those
days was the City, and day after day
our sturdy Londoners, grimly humor-
ous, and with their round bowler hats
cocked at an angle, fought in a bitter,
unceasing conflict for the cars. . . .
Where the line intersects the
Road therevstill stands an estaminet.
Within, a comely lass of the district
used to dispense refreshment during
those momentous days of last month.
Sunbeams lurked in her hair, and the
blue of the East Ham heavens was in
her eyes, so that one rejoiced to behold
her. Here our boys would come, fresh
from the conflict, to drink the bitter
beers of the country, and to glory in
the light and warmth of the place, so
that I, sipping a more expensive pota-
tion, would marvel at their high spirits
and the indomitable angle of their
round bowler hats. To-day I have
visited the place again. Outwardly it
was little changed, but within the girl
was no longer there. Mine host, as
he carefully mixed my drink, told me
sorrowfully that she had gone beyond
recall. “But yes, we are desolate,”
he said in his patois; “but what would
you? Always the poor little one found
herself milking the till. . . .”
To-day I have travelled to London
by way of the G.E.R. From the win-
dow of a first-class carriage—there was
no Pullman on the train—I saw flash by
all the strong places by the soap-works
and the tanning - yards which made
our progress so difficult in the mighty
struggle of last month, when London
was our objective. . And so one
came to the end of the journey, and
through it all one could not but admire
the chivalrous spirit of our clean-limbed
fellows towards their former foes. The
latter were much in evidence, still in
their blue uniforms, with here and there
the gold-laced cap of the High Com-
mand. Occasionally one saw their
Guards—big burly fellows these, with
silver buttons and badges. . . . They
suffered from no shortage of foodstuffs,
for I tasted a sandwich at the terminus
which had come through the Strike
remarkably well.

THE PASSING OF EMMA.
(The adoption of a Twenty-four-hour Clock is suggested.)
LADY, though other devotees have drifted
Away and none steps forth to break a lance
On your behalf, nor any voice is lifted -
To murmur, “Hang it, give the girl a chance' "
I will be true; I will not pass unheeding
When thus you're threatened; will not turn my back,
But take my stand against the superseding
Of Emma (Pip and Ack).
What shall it profit us, suppose we lose you?
Will roseate hours seem longer if you go,
Or shorter those that wear the baleful “blues' " hue?
I can't delude myself this will be so.
Or when they bid us rise, and willy nilly
(Knowing that we shall get no peace from them)
We do so, will 6.30 seem less chilly
Because it's not A.M. 2
It won't. But when there come our hours of leisure,
The all too brief reward for duty done,
And almost at the outset of our pleasure :
We hear some clock proclaiming twenty-one,
The young hour thus unwontedly inflated
Will tweak our consciences until, misled,
We make for home, and, feeling dissipated,
Crawl wearily to bed.
There shall be mourning then, there shall be sighing,
Lugubrious looks and countenances dour,
The splash of strong men's tears and voices crying
“Emma, thou shouldst be living at this hour; ”
But you'll be dead and gone, though not forgotten;
Too late we'll learn in grief's relentless grip
How truly times are hard and life is rotten
Sans Emma (Ack and Pip).
LEST WE REMEMBER,
THE deep interest excited by the new system of mental
training known as “Bliv,” and the extraordinary results
achieved by pupils drawn from every class of the community,
lately encouraged one of Mr. Punch's young men to solicit
an interview with the founder and director. The request
was graciously granted, with the sole condition that the
anonymity of the director should be respected. No one in
all his enormous staff of assistants knows his name. Some
of them allude to him familiarly as “the Blivver; ” but
this is a matter of no importance. It is enough to say that
he is a man in the prime of life, of commanding personality
and extraordinary cranial development, both frontal and oc-
cipital, taking an evenlarger sizein hatsthan Mr. GLADSTONE.
“You want to know something about ‘Bliv'?” he
remarked. “Good. I will tell you. “Bliv' is the short
for Oblivion. The root idea of my system is to disencum-
ber the mind of useless knowledge, to jettison the cargo of
memory and tradition, to concentrate on the present. But
let me interpose a word of caution at the outset. We
must forget the dead; we must be careful how we forget
the living. It was because he forgot GoschEN that Lord
RANDoIPH wrecked his career. Again, while we should at
all times strive to free ourselves from the dead hand of
the past, we need not altogether disregard those utterances
in which old authors recognised the supreme value of forget-
fulness. Oblivion, wrote one of them, is the remedy for
injuries. To forget, wrote another, is the best revenge.
Sorrow's crown of sorrows, wrote a third, is remembrance
of happier days in misery. But I do not wish to labour the
ethical value of forgetfulness; it is rather as an instrument
of efficiency that its cultivation is indispensable.
“The Bourbons forgot nothing and shattered their
dynasty. Statesmen, within the limits noted above, can
achieve nothing without mastering the art of forgetfulness,
otherwise they will be perpetually restrained by musty pre-
cedents. I have in my hand a letter lately received from
a Cabinet Minister of the highest rank, in which he says,
‘Since studying your wonderful little Blue books I have
entirely and absolutely forgotten, and am no longer troubled
by, the opinions I expressed or entertained before taking
office. The relief is incalculable, and I now come to the
discussion of the most vital problems with a mind fresh,
alert and unfettered by pledges.’
“So much for politics. In literature ‘Bliv' is equally
essential. Hitherto writers have been hampered and par-
alysed by the tyranny of ‘standards,' the greatest curse
of creative effort. I have received many gratifying testi-
monials from distinguished young Georgian poets; but the
critics are less ready to acknowledge the value of a system
which seeks to dethrone pedantry, to abolish the invidious
practice of parallel-hunting and to silence the parrot-cry of
plagiarism.
“It is the same in art. Artists must not only forget the
Correggiosity of CoRREGGIo and the Titianity of TITIAN, but
the Sargentry of SARGENT if they are to produce anything
in vital harmony with the spirit of true Modernism.
“So too in music. How is a composer to be original
unless he forgets—I do not say BEETHoveN and BACH, for
they are already relegated to the limbo of back numbers,
but WAGNER and even STRAUss? for, as an eminent British
musical critic has recently remarked, STRAUss in all but
the physical sense has been dead for many years.
“For all these evils ‘Bliv' is the best—the only cure.”
The interview ended here, but the effect on Mr. Punch's
representative was so profound that several hours elapsed
before he regained full consciousness of his identity or was
able to remember his name.
THE GREEN LOCH.
FAR in the hills the Green Loch lies,
Its emerald water mocks at the skies;
Be they garmented grey or blue
The Green Loch never changes its hue;
For at earliest dawn, when the winds are still,
Over the brow of the western hill
The fairies come in a happy throng
With elfin laughter and elfin song,
Trooping down to the water-side
To bathe in its cool enchanted tide.
Over and under they flash about,
They race with the shy little silver trout,
They twist and tumble and dart and dive
Till all the lake is alight and alive,
And glows with a tremulous sparkling sheen
Like the jewelled robe of an Eastern queen.
But ere the morning has well begun
They all come leaping forth to the sun;
They hang for a shimmering moment there
Shaking their curls in the warm bright air,
While the water drops from their delicate wings
And dapples the lake with quivering rings,
Then rise like thistledown over the trees
And float away on the heather-sweet breeze.
They leave not a sign, they leave not a trace;
A slumberous calm lies over the place;
Only the green, green waters bide
To tell the secret they never can hide. R. F.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT was my singular good fortune to read Allegra (MURRAY)
on a couch of sickness, an experience that I have no hesi-
tation in passing on by recommendation to others. As an
example, indeed, of the gentlest possible fictional nourish-
ment, where everything happens according to the most
restful plan, and no one ever, or hardly ever, does anything
that could conceivably agitate the pulse of the (literally)
“patient” reader, I should certainly say that Mrs. L. ALLEN
HARKER's new novel has deserved the thanks of the medical
profession. How, for instance, could a beef-tea story begin
better than with a literary gent and a budding actress
thrown together at the most exquisite of country inns?
Later, when the hero is handed the best-seller of an un-
dramatic novelist to adapt for the stage at fifty down and
one per cent royalty (I will say for Mrs. HARKER that she
at least does not share the too prevalent delusion that
dramatic authors start from payment by thousands), what
more natural than that a gentle combination of circum-
stances should guide Allegra into the position of star-girl
in the show 2 Thus far, indeed, all was so well that my
nurse beamed and my physician only too palpably con-
templated enlarging his fee. But—well, I said there was
a something. The protagonists, by this time Londoners
established, had arranged an afternoon motor-drive out of
town, and proposals hovered in the air, when by that
morning's post he received word from the original country
inn of their first meeting to say that the little child of the
proprietors was in extremis, and inquiring, in the most
pathetic of literary lispings Well, I still think that in
treating his abandonment of their expedition, fully explained
by wire, as reason for an even temporary betrothal to his
rival, Allegra was hardly playing the game by Paul, or
doing justice to the idealism of her own beautiful nature.
But, this apart, the tale remains an admirable febrifuge.
To me certainly there are no books more attractive than
those in which an expert lays himself open to a friendly
button-holing on his own subject—or subjects. And of
such volumes very few more amiable examples have come
my way lately than that in which Mr. EDMUND Gosse, C.B.,
allows us, as it were in a confidential hour, to share Some
Diversions of a Man of Letters (HEINEMANN). It is an open
question whether this delightful little collection of papers
will be the more welcomed by those who have, or have not,
had the extra pleasure of hearing one of our few remaining
talkers putting his thoughts into living words; anyhow, to
command a friendly book-chat with Mr. GossE on a score
of the subjects that he has made his own (“The Author of
Pelham,” “The Charm of Sterne,” and many others) makes
in these days a singularly good bargain at seven and six-
pence. I will attempt no further catalogue of the contents,
which are sufficiently varied, from historical research,
through criticism, to contemporary portraiture. Nothing
in the list is more appealing than the few vivid pages
devoted to the late Lady DoRo THY NEVILL. Much as has
been written concerning her piquant personality, I was
easily persuaded that there was still ample room for Mr.
GossE's most originally painted miniature. Elsewhere you
have some admirable criticism—I found it first-class fun, for

retorts upon the author of Eminent Victorians; and in a
paper upon Some Soldier Poets a friend who could
appreciate its exquisite truth was startled by the phrase,
“sparkling deference,” applied to one well-recalled attitude
of RUPERT BRookE. Here, in quite unassertive style, is one
of the most companionable books of I don't know how long.
I liked so well the earnestness of MARY FULTON's novel
about Patricia bereaved by the War and finding peace at
the tail of The Plough (DUCKworTH), that I regret that the
relics of an artistic conscience compel me to point out that
the author will need to discipline herself not to let the
things she wishes to say to her readers make hay with her
characterisation. She has something to say and is so
desperately eager to say it that she deals out her mes-
wife's sister (who might just as well have been something
else), and a shower of decorations—“thirty-four knight-
hoods and two hundred-and-twenty minor honours” among
a population of rather over six thousand. I feel that Mr.
HuBFFER very much enjoyed inventing that.
Perhaps the publishers of Panther (HURST AND BLACKETT)
are more susceptible than myself. Certainly the fascinations
of Mr. R. A. FostER-HELLIAR's heroine, named Imp, seem to
have got home with them in a fashion lamentably absent
from my own case. “Her charm sparkles on every page,”
they write almost estatically on what appears to be called
“the turn-over of cover.” I can only repeat with regret
my entire failure to detect it. Other qualities I do not deny
her, conspicuous among them a fine imperturbability in
circumstances of trial. The position was that, owing to a

characters (notably the

fellow-workers at Crow's

she is less tempted to make

was to substitute depilatory
tablets for aspirin as a re.

This worried the acute legal

something of an achievement when a grown-up author
succeeds in writing from the point of view of a child.
Sometimes I have suspected autobiography in such
efforts ; but his own experiences cannot here have
helped Mr. OLIVER MADox HUEFFER much, although
“JANE WARDLE" appears beneath his name in brackets.
Dinah, his heroine in Little Pitchers (STANLEY PAUL),
is a real little girl, full of that jealous consciousness
of her own personality which often makes the girl child
what nurses call “a handful,” while her less introspective
brother is being tiresome for much more understandable
reasons. Apart from Dinah, who only has one really big
adventure and doesn't get much excitement out of it, Little
Pitchers is a somewhat cynical account of life in war-time
in a little country town. Mr. HUEFFER places the affairs
of Crowmarsham in the hands of two dishonest but affable
solicitors, who employ themselves chiefly in digging pitfalls
for each other. He brings his story to a happy ending
| with a missing soldier's return, a marriage with a deceased
simply must tell you. . Remember, our heroine had from
the first been cognisant of these repeated efforts at her
removal. On the night of the final, or quartz, fiasco, she
knocked timidly at the door of the hero's room. “‘What is
the matter?' he asked sharply. “Nothing,' she assured him,
is wrong; only I have got the horrors and cannot sleep.’”
The italics are mine. It was her first and last word of
complaint. What a heroine ! And—what a story !

THE GLAD NEWS.
ARMISTICE DAY.
“WHAT's the date?” inquired the
Company Commander as he prepared
to sign a number of documents destined
to appease the insatiable lust for statis-
tics of that sinister organisation which
passes under the pseudonym of “Q.”
The Quartermaster-Sergeant appeared
to consult the adjacent portion of Bul-
garia.
“The eleventh, Sir,” he decided.
“Oh, ah, yes, of course,” said the
Captain. “And what month 2 ''
The Q.M.S. decided that the Captain
had really been in the Balkans a bit
too long. -
“November, Sir. And the year's
1918, Sir.”
The Captain carefully dated all his
returns, and the top of the writing-pad
he was using as a desk.
“Rations are up, Sir. And it's local
beef again, no jam and no cheese.”
“You 'ear that ?” remarked an astral
voice outside the tent. “Bloomin' Jugo-
Slav cow, no cheese and no blinkin'
pozzy.”
“I suppose,” said the Captain diffi-
dently, as if hesitating to suggest an
absurdity, “no rum issue 2''
“Rum, Sir?” the Q.M.S. lowered his
voice as one who speaks of holy things;
“why, the Quartermaster himself's out
of rum.” -
“Good heavens !” ejaculated the
officer, much moved. “That makes
three weeks since the last rum issue.”
“And three weeks since the last fresh
meat, not counting local beef, Sir.”
“And three weeks since the Mess
ran out of grape-juice in any form,”
added the Captain. “These Bulgars
had better be careful or we shan't come
here again.”
A clicking of heels and a vibration
of the atmosphere indicated the pres-
ence of the Sergeant-Major. -
“Beg pardon, Sir,” observed that
warrior; “rifle inspection ready, Sir.”
“Give me that thing I brought in
with me, Quartermaster-Sergeant. No,
not that—try the pink thing. What
does that say?” -
The Q.M.S. scanned the ill-written
wire.
“Armistice with Germany came into
force 11.00 hours,” he read, “at which
time hostilities ceased.”
“That'll be it,” said the Captain.
“Do your best with the stew. Now,
Sergeant-Major.”
In due course the platoon com-
manders, having examined each man's
thumb-nail by medium of his rifle
barrel, reported all as well as possible.
The Company Commander cleared his
throat.
“Company — 'shun " he rasped.
“The War stopped at 11.00 hours this
morning. Fall out the officers | Dis-
miss 1 '' -
“An' time too,” commented Private
Gudger, as the parade moved off, grous-
ing gently, “keeping us standin' there
a perishin' week.”
“Did you 'ear what 'e said?” re-
marked his mate. “That about the
War?”
“Ay. An' what if it is over ? It
won't do us poor blighters no good.
They'll leave us 'ere in blinkin' Bul-
garia while they talk for a year, an'
then start fightin' the French and the
Yanks over the Peace terms. I tell you,
this War's not goin' to finish, never no
more. It's grown into a nabit.”
:k :}: -k :k :k
The quick Bulgarian dusk was falling,
and each canvas shelter was coming
out a twinkling point of light, when a
sudden burst of cheering came from the
distant railhead dump. The ammuni-
tion column took it up. Brigade H.Q.
buzzed with it. The mule lines neighed
furiously. -
An orderly from the signal office
thrust a pink message form into the
Captain's hands which sent him hurry-
ing with shining eyes to the bivouac of
the Sergeant-Major, who received his
order with incredulous delight.
“These English celebrate their vic-
tory,” said Captain Zogitov of the
Bulgarian Army to his Lieutenant, as
they listened to the cheering, and in
perfect unison they spat expertly upon
the floor. -
“Boys,” the Sergeant-Major was
shouting with beaming face, “the ration
train's just up with some trucksful of
rum, and a double issue is authorised
for to-night. It's on the way up now.
Fall in in ten minutes.” -
And the well-in boomed anew. .
THE GREAT CONSPIRACY.
“WHY is it that women have no
notion of economy 2” inquired Henry.
All women are familiar with this
question; but because we are so wise
we never attempt to answer it.
How
can we, when we know that the whole
world is in conspiracy to prevent our
saving, so that most of us poor victims
give up the struggle as hopeless 2
I want to save; I do indeed. I think
at this crisis in the country's affairs we
ought all to be frugal, to make sacri-
fices. Besides, my account at the bank
is getting very low.
Thus I decided I would not have a
new coat this winter. It was hard,
now that these new fascinating hearth-
rug collars are so much in vogue, but I
was determined to stand firm. Then
—this is where the conspiracy begins—
I saw the advertisement. It showed
the coat, well-cut, elegant, all-wool,
desirable and—think of it in these days
—priced eighty-nine and six.
My pulses throbbed. I realised that
I could make sacrifices for the country
and have my coat as well—without the
newest collar, perhaps—but, as I have
said, now is the time when we must
learn the stern lesson of self-denial.
I hurried to the West-End emporium
without delay. -
“You wish to see our advertised
coat at eighty-nine and six,” said the
assistant in answer to my fevered re-
quest. “Certainly, Madam.”
The garment was placed upon me,
but only for an instant.
“Will you try on this other one,
Madam 2" said the voice of the con-
spirator in my ear; “it is so much
newer, and then look at its superb ligne,
its perfect mouvement . . .” (These, by
the way, are the expressions they send
us with the models from the Paris
ateliers. Of course you only pay to
hear them in the most exclusive West-
End establishments.)
You are now able to see the conspiracy
in full swing. Any woman will under-
stand the subtle suggestion in those
words; and every woman knows what
followed.
I tried on other coats. Models rich
in fur and superb in cut were folded
about me in rapid succession. Losing
all sense of proportion I plunged my
arms into sleeves of coats bearing
prices which but an hour before would
have staggered me. In fact there were
brief intoxicating moments when I
found myself hesitating between a seal-
skin with skunk collar at two hundred
guineas, and a sable-trimmed velour, the
ticket of which was marked with the
sinister sign MNK—three hundred and
eighty guineas.
Prudence came to my aid in time
and persuaded me to purchase some-
thing cheaper. No, it wasn't the coat I
set out to buy. You can't get “line” and
“movement" for eighty-nine and six.
>}: :k ::: :: :::
“Henry dear,” I remarked that even-
ing in the awful lull that followed my
request for an advance of twenty pounds,
“haven't they a system in men's shops
of persuading you to buy something
much dearer than you intended ?”
“Indeed they have not,” replied
Henry emphatically. “You just ask
for what you want and they give it you
—that's all.”
So you see; the shameful conspiracy
is directed entirely against women. I
am sure that men originated it so as
to get us more into their power. No
wonder we are not able to save.

LLOYD GEORGE AGAIN.
THough but a visitor to the village
the Vicar asked me to take the chair at
the Parish Hall when he lectured on
the Wonders of Astronomy. I modestly
refused till he put it to me in this way:
“If I don't ask a stranger I shall have
to ask one of my churchwardens. One
of them articulates defectively and can't
talk. The other can't stop talking. In
fact, on previous occasions he has caused
me to deliver my lectures in very trun-
cated form. Besides, our village audi-
ence loves a fresh face.”
I could not deny the villagers the
pleasure of gazing upon my fresh coun-
tenance.
The audience was large but impas-
sive. When I sat down after a very
few introductory words a sympathetic
deaf lady in the front row said very
loudly, “’As the poor man forgot his
speech 2 Give 'im a clap.” The ap-
plause that followed was too forced to
be flattering.
Soon the Vicar was under way. Now
the subject of astronomy is a somnolent
one. When one thinks of stars one
thinks of night; when one thinks of
night one thinks of bed; when one
thinks of bed one snores—at least a
gentleman at the back did. Soon the
audience became comatose. Those who
were not physically asleep were men-
tally asleep. The Vicar could have ex-
pounded the Muggletonian belief that
the sun is just one mile from the earth
and no one would have noticed it.
All at once he burst forth : “Now as
Mercury goes round the Sun in eighty-
eight days the Mercurian year only
lasts eighty-eight days; whilst, as Nep-
tune is the most distant planet, the
Neptunian year is equal to a hundred
and sixty-four of our earthly years. In
which of those spheres would you pre-
fer to exist, my friends? I pause for
a reply.”
The Vicar might have paused through
a Neptunian year without getting a
reply from that audience. However,
these novel astronomical facts im-
pressed me. I thought that I would
regain my reputation as a speaker when
the lecture was over by indicating my
choice in humorous fashion.
So when at last the Vicar finished I
said the usual nice things and then
turned to this question of years. I said
that I found great attractions in the
Mercurian year. Supposing Saturdays
and Sundays to arrive every seven
days, as on earth, and assuming the
usual half-dozen Bank Holidays and
the usual month's summer holiday, it
was evident that in the Mercurian year
of eighty-eight days there would only
be thirty working-days. That seemed
indeed admirable. But I also observed
that quarter-day would come every
three weeks and that the rate-collector
would call every six weeks. Then I
turned to Neptune. Existence in that
planet had its advantages. One could
live there a hundred years without
paying Income Tax. Quarter-days
that were forty earth - years apart
seemed, too, a most desirable ar-
rangement. I was just going to tell
the audience that I was a confirmed
Neptunian when all at once it occurred
to me that I was born in the early
autumn. Had that been my lot in Nep-
tune I might have attained the credit-
able age of a hundred earthly years
and after all miss my summer holiday

and the county cricket season. So I
plumped for Mercury, even if its quar-
ter-days come every three weeks.
The Vicar chuckled all through my
remarks, and the wakened audience sat
open-mouthed. I thought that they
would see my jokes later, and pictured
the blacksmith three days hence burst-
ing into guffaws in his forge, and the
pig-dealer overcome with mirth as he
drove his charges to market during the
course of the week.
But when I walked out of the hall
with the Vicar I heard angry voices
arguing in the darkness.
“I tell you 'e comes from town and
knows what 'e's talking about. If
Government could alter time o' day it
stands to reason it could alter quarter-
days.”
“A nice lookout it is for us with
quarter-days coming every three weeks.
I tell you that LLoyd GEORGE didn't
do so bad in the War, but when it comes
to making new quarter-days 'e's taking
too much upon 'isself.”

UNCONSCIOUS ART.
IT was not intended to be humorous.
It was a serious poem and its theme
was martyrdom. I was not induced by
admiring friends to type-write and send
it out on its travels, as so often seems
to happen in the fairy tale called “real
life”; my friends were of the other
kind, who would simply have said
“Tosh!" if I had given them the
chance to read it. So, without offering
it for their criticism, I did it up in a neat
parcel, with a stamped envelope en-
closed, took it to the post myself, and
waited to see what happened.
What happened was the return of it
within three days, accompanied by a
memorandum :— -
“DEAR SIR,-Your poem has merits,
but we regret to say we cannot publish
it. It is too long and not of sufficient
general interest. As, however, judging
from certain lines of the poem (espe-
cially 6, 36 and 107), we gather that
you have a sense of humour, we sug-
gest that you should write something
in the lighter vein that seems suited to
your natural style, and send it to such
a paper as Cheerio, or to one of the
definitely humorous magazines.
Yours faithfully, THE EDIToR.”
I looked at the lines indicated and
could see no humour in them; certainly
any fun that they suggested was un-
designed. I was deeply aggrieved, but
I cheered myself with the thought that
all the martyrs have not yet won their
palms and crowns, and set myself to
write the humorous article, for which,
at any rate, one person seemed to think

I was fitted. I chose to express my-
self in prose this time, as 1 was rather
disheartened about verse—just a brief
sketch of contemporary life, which
seemed to flow out of my fountain-pen
as if I had been a humourist all my
life. I typed and sent it off in a glow
of self-satisfaction, and back it came in
the allotted three days, with the usual
little note to keep it company.
“DEAR SIR,” the note said, “We
regret that, as we only use humorous
articles in our magazine, we must re-
turn your MS. with many thanks for
the offer. If we might tender a sug-
gestion it would be that you should
eliminate the more flippant phrases
that are scattered somewhat at hap-
hazard through the article, and send
the amended MS. to some serious
magazine, such as The Athenæum, the
subject, apart from its treatment, hav-
ing some merit and interest.
Yours faithfully, PRO Ed.”
So I have at least learnt that my
natural genius lies in the direction of the
two great arts of unconscious humour
and unconscious seriousness. I say
“great,” for, if it is the business of Art
to conceal itself from the general eye,
it is the business of great Art to con-
ceal itself also from the artist. I shall
now set myself to practise both of these
Arts with earnestness and assiduity.

my first fish.
I think I mentioned that when
George asked me to join his party in
Scotland he didn't say much about the
shooting. His actual words, if my
memory serves me aright, were: “As a
matter of fact the shooting isn't very
good. It's the fishing.”
It was not until we had been there
nearly a fortnight that George came
down to breakfast one morning looking
healthier than ever and adorned in a
superb shooting-coat, complete with
leathern shoulder-pads and cavernous
pockets.
“I am going shooting to-day,” he
announced.
Archie, who up to then had taken
his gun out nearly every day, looked
seriously alarmed.
“Are you?” he said. “Then I think
I'll go and fish.” And before we could
utter a word he had bolted like a rabbit,
got into the boat and rowed swiftly out
of range. -
Left in the lurch, I donned my waders
and sallied forth to fish alone. George
disappeared. -
I had been fishing for barely an hour
when the same alarming symptoms

describe. I had hooked a fish; only
this time I felt there was no cause for
alarm. It was clearly a small one.
At this moment a tame duck, cack-
ling insanely, flew over my head, fol-
lowed at a respectful distance by a large
number of leaden pellets and a deafen-
ing explosion.
The bird alighted on the water just in
front of me, and, turning my head, I
found myself looking down the barrels
of George's gun, not five yards away.
At this juncture he selected to fire his
second barrel. I was surprised and not
a little relieved to feel no answering
thrill of pain, and was just coming to
the reluctant conclusion that he had
missed me altogether when a certain
coldness about the legs revealed to me
the awful truth. Pellets had penetrated
my waders in several places.
“Brute ' " I shrieked.
punctured me!”
The water streamed in apace. I took
on a heavy list to port and sank slowly
by the stern.
George hauled me out and began to
apologise.
“I’m awfully sorry, old chap,” he
said, “but the fact is I'm not much of
a shot——” "
“Don’t mention it,” I answered sadly;
“I bear no resentment against you for
having hit me. I remember that when
you invited me here you warned me

George interrupted me by pointing
dramatically towards the loch.
“On the contrary,” he cried, “I
have merely killed him for you.”
Following the direction of his finger,
I saw, first, the duck, still sailing un-
dismayed in the immediate vicinity;
second, the top of my rod protruding
from the water, and last—and by far
the least—a small fish, no larger than a
sardine (and still further resembling
that succulent comestible in that it had
no head) lying on the surface, stone
dead, with one of George's ubiquitous
pellets, no doubt, in its little heart.
I fell upon it with a shout of joy and
bore it triumphantly ashore.
I had caught my first fish.
It was also my last. I had learnt my
lesson. The risk that the intrepid
angler must run seemed hardly com-
mensurate with the prize. George,
actuated by somewhat similar motives,
also gave up shooting.
If only he had known it, the little
fellow—I refer now to the fish—had
every reason to be proud. For he repre-
sented in his own chubby person not
only the total catch from my rod, but
also the total bag from George's gun.

[November 12, 1919.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DOG DAY.
(Every dog has at least one of them.)
“HE's asleep in the sun, behind the
greenhouse,” said Albert Edward, re-
turning from spying out the land.
“Push ahead.”
“What 's his name 2 " I asked.
“I’ve heard the old girl call him
Rupert; but never mind about his
name; make a noise like muffins until
you get him in range and then—click!”
“It's all very well, but 1 *
“For a chap who, according to his
own showing, has made a decent living
stealing sheep in the Colonies, you're
strangely sticky over a little job like
this,” he sneered.
My reputation, it seemed, was at stake.
I stripped off my coat, leapt lightly over
the fence, crept round the hydrangea
bush, did a serpentine tummy wriggle
through some raspberry canes and
arrived within grappling distance of
Rupert. He was, as Albert Edward
reported, asleep on a sunny patch of
grass, drugged with lunch and looking
very much like a hairy sucking-pig.
He did not hear me approach, and when
he woke up his head was swaddled in
my coat, his barking apparatus firmly
muzzled by my strong right hand.
We found Claudia and Chloe dis-
cussing jumpers (knitted, cashmere) on
some mossy boulders at the head of
the lane.
“We’ve got him,” Albert Edward
announced triumphantly.
“Less emphasis on the ‘we,’” I
said. “Who stole the blooming dog
—you or I?”
Chloe's large blue eyes widened to
about the size of Delft saucers. “Stole?”
“Nothing of the sort, dearest,”
Claudia comforted her. “We’ve merely
asked it out for the day. It belongs to
that old woman who is lodging at Mrs.
Tregenza's, and it does have such a
deadly time. It's never allowed out by
itself, and the poor henpecked darling
just creeps along at her heels with its
head and tail down, shooting such
glances of envy at my cheery Peke that
it nearly breaks my heart. So I thought
I'd give it one jolly good day at any
rate, and sent these people round to
invite it.”
“Remove the invitation from Rupert's
head and let him hear the good news,”
said Albert Edward.
Rupert's porcine countenance came
to light; he appeared to be on the
point of tears.
Claudia snuggled her cheek against
the creature's hairy neck. “Cheer up,
old thing; we're quite respectable,
really. Chloe's uncle is a dean and
seven curates have proposed to me.”
“Let's all swank,” said Albert Ed-
ward. “The KING once wrote to me as
his ‘trusty and well-beloved ’l”
“He took it back when he demobilised
you, though,” said I. “My grandfather
got drunk with the PRINCE REGENT."
“He's quite reassured now,” said
Claudia, fondling Rupert's elongated
proboscis—“and ums is going to have
the time of ums' ickle life, isn't ums?”
She turned to me—“I think you had
better carry him a bit further; he
might be still slightly suspicious.
Come on, Chloe.” -
The two girls set off at a brisk pace
across country, swinging their sticks
and discussing lingerie (crème, nun's
veiling). Half-way up Penmenor Hill
I paused. “Here, you bear the burden
for a while.”
“Oh, go on; you don't tell me you're
tired,” said Albert Edward scornfully.
“Why, I've seen a man carry a hun-
dred-pound bag of flour to the top of
Kosciusko without opening a pore.”
“Maybe you did, but I wasn't that
man, if you remember. Take the dog,
or I drop it.”
“Drop it, then. He should follow
us now.”
Rupert lay where we dumped him,
on his back, his legs in the air, appar-
ently studying the cloud effects.
“Let's leave him there and he'll
trot home presently. We can say he
bit us and escaped. Oh!”
Claudia had appeared on the top of
a bank.
“Where's Rupert?” she called. We
pointed. “Why is he upside-down like
that 2"
“Hush he's playing authors. He's
Gilbert K. Filberton at the moment,
hatching a paradox.”
Claudia frowned. “You’ve offended
him somehow and made him suspicious
again. Pick him up, one of you.”
We hesitated. Claudia made signs
of jumping down.
“Well, if you two great brutes won't,
I will. Of course Chloe and I are but
weak women; still I daresay * >
Albert Edward returned and gathered
up Rupert. We dipped down a sunny
slope, crossed a stream and breasted the
carn on the other side. Albert Edward
began to grunt.
“I once saw a fellow carry a hind-
quarter of beef up Kilima N'jaro,” I
began, “and he never —”
“Turned a hair,” Albert Edward com-
pleted, dropping Rupert into a bed of
bracken. “Yes, I know, some men are
wonderful, aren't they 2 Look here,
I'm going to drag this animal. Lend
me your handkerchief; 'mine's in the
wash this week.”
I felt all over myself with no result.
“I had one once, I know. Must have
dropped it somewhere. More expense.”
Chloe, perched upon some giant
boulders, hallooed and waved her stick
at us. I groaned and picked up Rupert
again.

“Tired 2 ''
“Yes.”
“So am I. Still nothing matters as
long as the dog enjoys itself, does it?”
“No, of course not. Let's try car-
rying him between us. You take his
front legs, I'll take his tail. Got 'em 2
Right-o! Forward!”
At Crows-an-wra (which is Cornish
for Zawn-a-Bal, or Pedn-men-du-or
something) we met the two girls re-
turning.
“What on earth have you been doing
all this time?” Claudia inquired.
“We’ve been giving Rupert pick-a-
back rides and playing horses for him,”
I replied. “It's his birthday. Didn't
you know?"
“Well, you've missed your tea, at
any rate. You were such an appalling
time coming, so we had it without you.
It was a scrumptious tea, wasn't it,
Chloe 2 Saffron cake and blackberry
jelly.”
“And cream,” Chloe murmured bliss-
fully—“a cow-full.”
“Don’t talk like that before an empty
dog,” I implored; “it’s cruelty.”
“Oh, we didn't forget him, you may
be sure,” said Claudia. “Didn't forget
Mumsie's ickle diddums, did us, dar-
ling? Here, eat this.” She proceeded
to hand-cram Rupert with chunks of
golden saffron cake. Albert Edward
and I watched the operation fascinated.
“Didn't happen to remember Mumsie's
ickle Albert Edward by any chance, did
you?” that gentleman inquired.
Claudia stared. “My goodness
Did you hear that, Chloe 2 The great
lazy brutes expect us to fetch them
their food, now. No, of course not.”
“Quite right too,” I agreed. “What do
we matter as long as the dog's happy?"
“And now for home,” said Claudia,
as Rupert removed the last crumbs of
cake from his whiskers. “Come on,
Chloe.”
The two girls set off at a brisk pace,
swinging their sticks and discussing
afternoon dance frocks (cérise taffetas,
picot-edged). We followed them. A
hundred yards further on Claudia
halted—" Hello, where's Rupert 2"
“Over there, on his back again, wait-
ing for the little stars to twinkle, twinkle.
There's astrology in his family.”
“We can't leave him like that. One
of you must carry him.”
“Oh, I say! Steady on. He'll find
his way home.”
“No, he won't ; it'll be dark pre-
sently. Besides, I expect he's tired.”

“Not me,” said Albert Edward.

A large figure loomed out of the dusk.
It was Trembath, the local sleuth.
He coughed. “Been a fair old
rumpus over that dog, gentlemen.

from her garden this afternoon.”
“S-S-stolen?” I stuttered in amaze-

coldly, “was the word, Sir.” There
was an awkward silence broken only
by the shuffle of Albert Edward's feet
and the chatter of my teeth.
“Stolen 2" came the voice of Claudia.

R SPEs HUL To say, AND I ExPECT THERE 's A GooD MANY LITTLE GIRLS AND BOYS
SUPER-SALARIES.
SIR ALBERT STANLEY's remarkable
declarations as to the ample supply of
£10,000 jobs if the right man could be
brought to the top have excited so much.
comment that Mr. Punch has thought
it desirable to collect the opinions of a
few leading men on the subject, ..
The SHAH of PERSIA cordially en-
dorsed Sir ALBERT STANLEY's dictum
that the great difficulty lay in finding
men big enough to bear the burden of
big positions. . He added that he was
doing his best ; he was only twenty-one,
but he weighed twenty stone. . .
Lord FISHER thought that Sir ALBERT
STANLEY was talking rot through his
hat. The only good work done now-
adays, was done by men out of jobs.
The papers were full of advertisements
from people who said “Salary no ob-
ject.” If all the ten-thousand-pounders
were sacked, as they ought to be, there
was plenty to go round. -
Mr. Asquith said he had read that
LENIN only received a salary of £1,500
a year. No doubt he would be dubbed
a Bolshevist for calling attention to the
statement. He had recently been read-
ing SAMUEL WARREN's Ten Thousand a
Year, but it threw little light on Sir
ALBERT STANLEY's contentions.
- Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE was specially
interested in the statement that it was
not brains that were lacking, but trained
brains. “That,” he remarked, “is a
most poignant and pregnant saying,
and it falls in exactly: with what in
season and out of season I have been
preaching for many years, past. : You
cannot have big brains unless you have
room for them. Brain-training presup-
poses cranial drill. .You cannot lodge an
A1 brain in a C3 skull. ... But any man
or woman can have an A1 skull if he
(or she) will only give the same amount
of time to skull-drill that he (or she) now
gives to Swedish exercises or face mass-
age. Sir OLIVER LODGE told me, in one
of our many interviews, that between
the ages of seventeen and forty-three
his head had increased in diameter by
almost one-third. The method is simple
and not painful, and consists of dis-
tending the cranium by a current of
compressed air driven through the eu-
stachian tubes. Then as the cranium
expands the brain follows suit. Of
course care is needed to secure an
equable pressure, otherwise a bulbous
appearance may result, instead of the
beautiful dome-like protuberance which
is generally associated with greatness.
. But heads not only wax; they wane. I
remember”—here Mr. BEGBIE adopted
a flute-like tone of infinite pathos—
“that when I saw ... the KAISER at
Amerongen I was at once struck by
the shrinkage of his cerebellum. Per
contra Mr. C. K. SHORTER tells me that,
since devoting his energies to finding
a solution of the Irish problem which
will satisfy the generous aspirations of
the Sinn Feiners, he has been obliged
to exchange a 7-inch for a 73-inch hat.
“The whole subject is of enthralling
interest; perhaps too enthralling when
one thinks of the hereditary predisposi-
tion of hatters to insanity. But I am
sure that we give far too little thought
to systematic and scientific cranial dis-
tension as an indispensable preliminary
to greater efficiency, uplift and salary-
earning capacity. That is the moral
of a little poem I have just composed,
in which a beautiful girl, before con-
senting to becoming engaged, asks her
suitor one vital question:—
“Thrilling with a soft emotion
To her love she sweetly said,
“Tell me, Edwin, tell me truly,
How much are you round the head º'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 3rd.—Sir AUCK-
LAND GEDDEs manfully withstood
the attacks of the hard-shell Tariff
Reformers, who complained that he
was permitting the free importation
of all manner of foreign goods and
thereby promoting unemployment. In
his opinion what the country chiefly
wanted was goods, and Labour would
not be seriously injured by the importa-
tion of toothbrushes from China, arti-
ficial flowers from Japan or even mouth-
organs from Germany.
The mention of this last article
caused a sympathetic spasm in the
breast of Lieutenant-Commander KEN-
worthy, the champion mouth-organizer
of Central Hull. He complained that
the price of these instruments was now
four hundred per cent. above the pre-
war level, and protested against any
obstacle being placed in the way of
their importation.
This poignant appeal must have gone
home, for when Mr. GEORGE TERRELL
endeavoured to move the adjournment,
in order to call attention to the “great
menace to the reconstruction of in-
dustry” involved in the policy of the
Government, only thirty Members sup-
ported him, and the motion fell to the
ground.
The gas supplied to the London
householder now compares unfavour-
ably with that generated in the House
of Commons, which, if not particularly
illuminating, at least produces a cer-
tain amount of heat. Nowadays the
mot d'ordre in the gas-cooking house-
hold has to be, “Polly, put out all the
lights before you put the kettle on ' "
But a Bill obliging the gas companies
to charge according to quality instead
of quantity is in course of preparation,
and is expected to produce an improve-
ment before, say, the winter of 1920-1.
The usefulness of Question-time has
sometimes been challenged. But its
value was proved this afternoon. With-
out its aid the FIRST CoMMIssionER of
WoRKs, who wants twenty thousand
bedsteads for the Royal Air Force,
might never have known that the
DEPUTY MINISTER OF MUNITIONS had
nine thousand of them for disposal. It
was the Member for HERTFoRD who
effected the introduction and gave rise
to the Lobby conundrum: “Why is
BILLING like adversity? Because he
makes us acquainted with strange bed-
fellows.”
In a calmer atmosphere than pre-
vailed on previous occasions when the
Aliens Restriction Bill was before the
House steady progress was made. But
when Colonel WEDGwood moved a
series of Amendments designed to
enable aliens to change their names—
the best way, in his opinion, to turn a
bad German into a good Englishman
—he met with no encouragement, the
House evidently considering that a bad
German by any other name would be
equally malodorous.
Tuesday, November 4th.-Lord CHARN-
wood introduced a Bill to render clergy.
men eligible for the House of Commons
and other representative bodies. Their
present disability, he pointed out, dated
from a time when the clergy taxed them-
selves separately through their own
assembly—a halcyon period, whose
restoration our starving parsons would
infinitely prefer to the faint chance
of election to Parliament. The Arch-
bishop of CANTERBURY opposed the Bill
on the ground that it would involve
EARL BEATTY OF THE NORTH SEA.
the clergy in partisan controversy, and
drew an ingenious distinction between
them and the Bishops, who, though
they sat in Parliament, were not tied
to party organisations. Nevertheless
the Peers gave the measure a Second
Reading.
Having now had time to read the
White Paper on Afghanistan Lord
SYDENHAM made a renewed attack on
the Government policy, and on this
occasion was supported by Lord ISDING-
ToN, who thought that we could hardly
have given the AMEER greater con-
cessions if he had beaten us. But the
two noble lords got no change—in
any sense of the words—out of Lord
CURzoN, who again pointed out that
the negotiations were not yet com-
pleted, and added that the control
over Afghanistan's foreign relations,
which we had now relinquished, had
been of so unsubstantial a kind that
the late AMEER had concluded a secret
treaty with the Germans.
The delay in the appointment of a
Consul-General at New York is due,
according to Mr. HARMsworth, to the
great difficulty of finding “a man pos-
sessing the requisite commercial train-
ing, knowledge of America, business
capacity and experience for so import-
ant a post.” Mr. BOTTOMLEY, who put
the Question, is convinced that the
Government have not really been trying.
He himself is prepared to find such a
man within five minutes and without
leaving his own office.
The evening was occupied by a dis-
cussion on the appointment of a soli-
citor as Coal-Controller. Mr. BRACE,
who led the attack, said that the Gov-
ernment seemed to think that the one
thing necessary was that this official
should have a legal mind. Well, why
not 2 Surely in these days a very desir-
able qualification for the post is a
working acquaintance with Coke upon
Littleton. -
Wednesday, November 5th.-A fresh
breeze from the North Sea dispersed
the vapours of the House of Lords when
Earl BEATTY, escorted by Earl Howe
(descendant of another naval hero) and
the Earl of Lytton (Civil Lord of the
Admiralty), marched up the floor to
take his place among his peers. Those
who expected him to notify his arrival
to the LoRD CHANCELLOR in the time-
honoured phrase, “Come aboard, Sir,”
were disappointed, but the quarter-deck
voice with which he declaimed the
oath greatly impressed the attendant
eetesses.
There followed him two outstanding
figures of the War on land, Lord RAw-
LINSON of TRENT and Lord BYNG of
WIMY, who received an equally cordial
welcome.
After fencing for some time with the
vexed question of premium bonds,
Mr. BonAR LAw announced this after-
moon that in a fortnight or so he would
give a day for a discussion on the sub-
ject and leave the decision to the free
vote of the House. Naturally the
humourists on either side seized their
chance. Mr. MACQUISTEN put in a
plea for the poor bookmakers, so soon
to be deprived of their livelihood, and
presumed they would be given the
unemployment dole; and Dr. MURRAY
suggested that the Government should
send a special mission to Hamburg to
study this Hun-hallowed system of
finance in its spiritual home.
Before 1914 the Member for Stoke-
on-Trent was chiefly noticeable as the
possessor of a somewhat truculent
manner and the most umbrageous hat
in the House. Though he was known
to have done the State some service as

a private soldier in the Soudan, he was
generally regarded as a dangerous re-
volutionary. But, as in so many other
cases, the War brought out the real
man. Having done fine service both
on sea and land, he returned to-day to
deliver, amid the plaudits of a delighted
House, the most tremendous philippic
that has yet been launched against the
Bolshevist tyranny. For over an hour
he described, from personal experience,
the miseries of the hag-ridden Russian
people. Lieutenant-Colonel MALONE,
who also has been lately in Russia—on
“a kind of Cook's tour with TROTSKY,”
as Sir S. HoARE described it—tried
hard to induce the House to believe that
the stories of Bolshevist
atrocities were either untrue
or grossly exaggerated, and
that we ought to make peace
with the Soviet Administra-

THE NEW DISEASE.
STANDING by the Marble Arch the
other day I noticed, coming towards
me over the grass, a man and a boy.
They were walking briskly, and the
man was looking about him with viva-
cious interest. Just before reaching
the Arch they stopped; the man pro-
duced from his pocket a leather case,
from which he took a large pair of
black spectacles, and, having adjusted
these to his nose, he was led away into
Oxford Street as though he had lost
his sight. Had he been of a needy
appearance, I should have thought him
an impostor hoping for charity for an
illusory blindness; but his
air of prosperity precluded
that suspicion, and I went
on my way wondering.
Chance has now brought
me the key to the mystery.
This man, I have learned, is
a victim of a new disease, to
which no name has yet been
given, but which may be
called variously Tractabilitis,
or Plasticenza, or Acute Com-
§ plaisancy, for it consists in
such a loss of will power that
the patient obeys every in-
truction on which his eyes
rest. Normally we are able
2 to resist certain of the public
5 adjurations. Hundreds of
persons, for example, do not
keep to the right, do not
wipe their boots, do not stop
smoking in the lifts, and so
forth. When, however, we
contract Plasticenza we be-
come so pliant as to develop
into a nuisance both to our
friends and ourselves, and,
worse than a nuisance, we are
in danger of passing through
the Bankruptcy Court.
“‘The Bankruptcy Court,' you say?
How 2 ''
Because of the hoardings. Not only
does the victim of the new disease obey
the ordinary instincts of life, such as
keeping clear of gates and bewaring
of pickpockets, but he endeavours to
do all that the advertisements tell him
to, too. At any moment he may buy
articles of luxury that he doesn't want,
or hurry off to Clacton-on-Sea when
he ought to be in London attending to
his business.
The poor fellow whose story I have
now heard, the man I saw in the Park,
although he lives at Shepherd's Bush,
never (until he bought black spectacles)
was able to get past Queen's Road Sta-
tion on the Tube, either going or coming,
because of the notice there, “Alight here
for Whiteley's.” But that was not the

AT THE PLAY.
“SUMMERTIME.” -
WHEN Silvia came from Australia to
the England that she only knew from
her books and dreams, she found in
Devonshire (so she told us) the same
birds singing, the same flowers blowing,
the same old cottages smiling that sang,
blew and smiled in the days of HERRICK,
JANE AUSTEN and Miss MITFoRD. She
even had the good luck (which I have
not shared) to hear some girls of the
Land Army singing “Sumer is icumen
in,” which she cleverly assigned to a
period one hundred years before CHAU-
cER. This gives you the note, on its
rustic side, of a play as guileless as the
promise of its title. -
* If I could suspect Mr. Louis PARKER
of cynicism (a thought that is abso-
lutely repugnant to me) I should guess
that he had said to himself, “People
complain that the Stage is becoming
sophisticated and prurient; that there
is too much bedroom in it; that its
indecencies are too bare-faced and too
bare-backed. Well, this time they shall
have something in the best Victorian
manner, which will not bring a blush to
the cheeks of the youngest brigadier.”
"Such cynicism in our author is unthink.
able, and I prefer to credit him with a
laudable desire to remove us far from
the jazzing crowd and bring the scent
of Devonshire lanes and the taste of
Devonshire cream, as they say, “across
the footlights.” -
To accomplish this good end he has
not scorned the uses of stage conven-
tion. Lovingly he stretches out to us
the long arms (for there are two of
them here) of coincidence — (1) when
Willoughby Spencer engaged himself
inadvertently to three several girls
who happened to be the respective
daughters of three partners in the
same firm of solicitors; (2) when this
trio of blighted maidens, seeking dis-
traction in the Land Army, chanced to
find themselves in the menial employ
of three love-sick men who, in conjunc-
tion with Willoughby, had fled for soli-
tude to a cottage in the wilds of Devon.
Upon this bachelor society, penetrated
with disillusionment, where everybody
was on edge, and losing pride in him-
self and tolerance for his fellows, all
for lack of a woman's refining influence,
suddenly Silvia, an unknown cousin of
Willoughby's, blew in from the Antipo-
des. Stepping at once into the hearts
of all, she restored amity and self-re-
spect, reorganised the cuisine, converted
the slatternly kitchen-wench into a
dapper maid and filled the place with
flowers, cocktails, antique furniture,
and other emollients material and
spiritual.
Here was a chance for Mr. LOUIS
PARKER's notorious gift in pageantry;
and though limited, of course, by con-
ditions of space and matter he never-
theless contrived to have two separate
meals (breakfast for five and dinner
for eight) laid out before our eyes with
the greatest particularity of detail.
Briefly, within twenty-four hours—
and it seemed even less than that to us
—Silvia had employed her magic to
such purpose that the three jilted girls
had paired off with the three jilted men
(thus releasing Willoughby from the
threat of an action, in triplicate, for
breach of promise), while Willoughby
himself fell to the Australian fairy.

Willoughby . . Mr. C. AUBREY SMITH.
Silvia . . . . Miss FAY COMPTON.
Twenty-four hours, as I say, sufficed
for this reconstruction, and the same
respect for the unities was noticeable in
the scene, which remained unchanged
throughout, except for the ornamental
modifications that were due to Silvia's
cultured taste.
It would have to be a pretty poor
play that could not be redeemed by Mr.
AUBREY SMITH's ease of manner and
Miss FAY CoMPTON's personal charm.
But even Mr. AUBREY SMITH could not
quite carry the burden of a rather ama-
teurish first Act; though later, in his
passages with Silvia, he had better
chances and took them all in his stride.
Miss FAY CoMPTON played with a rather
constrained gaiety, as if she would
have preferred to be pathetic, but Mr.
PARKER wouldn't let her. Miss MARY
BROUGH made a superb housekeeper in
the broad style, and Mr. WHITLING
handled the more reserved humour of
the butler with great dexterity. Miss
GwynETH KEYs showed something
more than talent in her study of Selina,
the reformed kitchen-wench.
Much of the fun was of the sort that
has to be rollicking if it is to be of much
use. And Mr. Louis PARKER's fun
never really rollicked. But there was
some very pleasant prattle between
Willoughby and Silvia, though I only
recall one touch of the higher humour
where he prefaced the confession of his
three-fold dalliance with the plea, “I
was so war-weary.”
Summertime, it seems, has added a
new responsibility to the promoters of

AT THE OPERA. .
“Coq D'OR.”
EveRYoNE wishes that gallant Sir
THOMAs of so many arduous and
fortunate emprises may have the very
best of luck with his Opera-in-English
Season at Covent Garden. I happened
to get the bird in the ingeniously varied
bill of fare, which has been designed
to please every palate. The cognoscenti
tell me that Coq d'Or was better done
many hundred years ago in 1914. But
that is the way of these folk. It may
very well be true; but it is as true that,
to one who unfortunately missed hear-
ing and seeing it then, it is a quite
admirable and exciting entertainment,
and provides one of the best possible
proofs of the able way in which our
native talent has been developed. I
say this to forestall criticism by the all-
wise to the effect that Coq d'Or is in
too exotic mood for our island sobriety.
Mr. PERCY PITT led his orchestra
boldly and successfully through the
mazes of RIMSKY-KoRSAKov's fantastic
themes and rhythms—more success-
fully, I think, than the singers in general
dealt with their material. It is a grave
handicap to wed a none too easy music
to the most difficult singing language
in the world, and I privily wonder
whether the gain derived from the ability
to hear a phrase or two in an occa-
sional passage of recitative balances
this indubitable disadvantage. One
may go further and doubt if from the
musical point of view an opera ought
ever to be sung in any language but
that in which it was written. But this
need not prevent us from welcoming
the new movement, if it will bring
more music-lovers for Sir THOMAS to
delight.

Russians, which looks so easy to do

prove) so desperately difficult, provides
a continual imaginative accompani-
ment to the music. The grouping was
extraordinarily effective; the dancing
admirable. Our supers still fix the
vacant eye too frequently, except where
manifest stage directions and explicit
drilling have dictated a temporary show
of interest.
It was entertaining to see the gay
Cockerel, having nose-dived and duly
outed King Dodon, develop engine-
trouble on rising and with difficulty
regain his lines. But the humours of
the evening were not confined to such
accidental diversions. Mr. FostFR
RICHARDsoN (the King) and Mr. HER-
BERT LANGLEY (his General) acted
throughout with a fine sense of the
grotesquery which distinguishes this
Bolshevik pamphlet—for you may set
it down as that in effect. Miss SYLVIA
NELIs has a voice of beautiful quality,
but looked much too nice for the un-
worthy manoeuvres which were ex-
pected of her. The fine tenor of the
Magician (Mr. GERALD O'BRIEN) was
a pleasure to hear. A very delightful
evening and a golden feather for Sir
THOMAS's cap.
THE MAGPIES OF VERDUN.
“I THINK this must be the place,”
said the magpie.
“What place?” asked
der.
“The place I am looking for,” re-
turned the magpie.
He was sitting perkily on the muzzle
of Number 6 gun in the farmyard of
Mère Bigaud, and Jimmy and Jane,
the mascots of A52 Battery, 9th Div-
ision, had come out to do the honours
of their temporary home. Jimmy
always made a point of explaining
everything about the guns to any new-
comers, and Number 6 gun was a very
good object-lesson, as it had been sent
back to the waggon-lines to be over-
hauled and for the time being could
neither bark nor kick.
“Yes,” mused the magpie, “I seem
to have struck it this time. Here's
the weathercock with the little ship on
it, and there 's the orchard between the
two streams; if only an old dame in a
blue gown would come out now I should
be quite sure.”
“A blue gown 2" echoed Jane, in-
terested. “Mère Bigaud wears a blue
gown.” -
“My dear,” said the gander, “it is
perhaps natural that geese should con-
cern themselves with — ah—gowns;
but this gentleman would no doubt
prefer to discuss some less trivial topic.
That gun, Sir, upon which you are
sitting—”

French Dame. “AH, MERCI, Monsieur—vous #1Es aren GENTIL.”
“’ERE, AsseyEz-vous, MADAME, s' IL rous
“Do you think I have never seen a
gun before?” asked the magpie with a
cackle of laughter, “Why, my boy, I
have just come from a place where
they stand as thick as the cabbages
yonder.” -
“Ah, you come from the gun-lines,”
said Jimmy, unabashed. “Then you
must be acquainted with my brown
men. Fine fellows, Sir—fine fellows.”
“My men are blue,” returned the
magpie. “I come from Verdun.”
Both Jimmy and Jane looked up at
him with new interest. They had
heard of Verdun. Mère Bigaud's son-
in-law was there, and from all accounts
it could not be nearly such a pleasant
place as the waggon-lines.
It was the dinner-hour, and the farm-
yard basked empty in the keen Spring
sunlight. A cosy clatter from the kit-
chen was the only sound, except the
far-off thud of a gun or the brief crash
of an A.S.C. lorry across a cobbled
bridge a quarter-of-a-mile away.
“Do you reside at Verdun, Sir?”
asked Jimmy Gander with courteous
interest.
“I did,” said the Magpie; “I and
my three brothers lived in the cathedral
tower. When the blue men have driven
away the grey men for good perhaps
we may live there again. Who knows?
But we're up against a big job now, we
four. We are indispensables.”
“What is “indispensable'?” inquired
Jane.
“Magpies are,” said their new friend
with conviction.
“I suppose it means black and white,”

thought Jimmy Gander; but he did not
risk saying it aloud.
“May I ask, Sir,” he resumed, “upon
what important work you are engaged?"
“You may. We are taking the place
of the storks.”
“I know what they are,” murmured
Jane.
“Naturally, Madam. And doubtless
you know also that since those wretched
grey men came crashing and pounding
into the land of the blue men, the storks
have had to give up their highly im-
portant work.” -
“Why?” asked Jane.
For once Jimmy did not repress her
inquisitiveness. He himself wanted to
know why.
“It's perfectly simple,” retorted the
magpie a little impatiently; “the grey
men's great blundering guns have top-
pled down all the chimneys for miles
round. And what good is a stork with-
out a chimney?. Though, mind you, I
don't say that this fuss they call war is
altogether bad for us birds.”
“Not altogether,” conceded Jimmy
Gander.
“For one thing,” pursued the magpie,
“look how plentiful the corn is in the
horse-lines! Scattered all over the
place. Nose-bags overflowing with it,
and nobody to drive us away. But it
has been an awkward thing for the
storks. And it might have been abso-
lutely fatal for the humans hereabouts,
if we hadn't taken on the job.”
“What job?” asked Jimmy, after
waiting a moment to see if Lady Jane
would spare him the ignominy of hav-
ing to ask.
“Why, bringing the human babies,
of course, my good Sir. Can you con-
ceive what would happen if there were
nobody to bring them 2 A baby famine
—nothing less. Humans have to go
short of a good many things just now.
At Verdun, for instance— But that's
another story.”
“Do go on,” prompted Lady. Jane
graciously. “It is most interesting.
Is it not, James?” -
“Exceedingly,” said Jimmy Gander.
“Our job,” continued the magpie,
“used to be to let the humans know
what the storks were intending to do—
when the humans had the sense to
understand. That's why Pierre's friend
the Sergeant said y -
“Who is Pierre?” interrupted Lady
Jane apologetically; “I’ve heard the
name before.”
“Oh, I forgot,” said the magpie;
“you don't know him, of course.
Pierre is a Norman—one of my blue
men—in the trenches just outside Wer-
dun. And the other day, when I and
my three brothers were having an early
morning flight over the lines, the Ser-
geant caught sight of us and turned to
Pierre. “There you are, mon vieur,”
said he –
“‘One for sorrow, two for joy,
Three for a girl and four for a boy.'
“Pierre seemed pleased. But we were
not. He didn't know that the storks
had had to chuck their job—and we
did.”
“Ah,” murmured Lady Jane, craning
forward her sleek silver head to hear
better.
“If it had been a girl that Pierre
wanted,” pursued the magpie, “we
should not have felt so worried. But
a boy They are such heavy lumps
that even the storks have their work
cut out to carry them. However, we
are going to do our best. And if this
is the farm where Pierre's wife and her
mother live, that 's one bit of work
done already.”
“Mère Bigaud has a daughter,”
hinted General James helpfully.
“And a blue gown,” murmured Jane.
The magpie gave a little hop of de-
light.
“That's it ! And I'm sure I ought
not to make any mistakes when I think
how often I've heard Pierre telling his
friend the Sergeant about it. I must
signal to my brother; he's waiting
yonder, on one of those swinging
wires.” -
“Just a moment, I beg,” interposed
General Jim, as the magpie lifted his
motley wings. “Are the grey men
making any—ah—any progress at the
place you mentioned 2 Verdun, you
know.”
The magpie let his wings drop
against his sides again.
“There were many grey men yonder,”
said he, “and the blue men were fewer
every day. I knew the Normans of
the front line best–Pierre's battalion.
Their officer said something to them
one morning that made them tighten
and stiffen and grip their rifles harder.
Most of them looked straight ahead—
only you couldn't tell what they were
looking at. But Pierre looked at me
and one of my brothers wheeling over
the front line. ‘Two for joy,' he said.”
“What did the officer say?” asked
Jim.
“He said, “Men, there is nothing but
yourselves between the Boches and your
wives and children. There are no re-
serves behind you. You must stand and,
if need be, die where you stand.’”
Jane shuddered, but her husband's
little eyes gleamed.
“Did they say anything 2" he asked.
“They didn't exactly say anything,”
returned the magpie, “but a sort of
sound ran along the line like the voice
of the wind on a field of wheat—and
it sounded like something I've often
heard lately; it sounded like Vive la |
I'rance 1 ''
“And then 2" prompted Jimmy.
“The grey men — those that the
Captain called the Boches—came on
and on—many, many of them ; but the
blue men stood—and died where they
stood—and the grey men got no nearer
to Verdun.” -
From a telegraph post a hundred
yards away another magpie swooped
across and perched upon the gun.
“One of my brothers,” explained the
first - comer, introducing him. “He
will be glad to make your acquaint-
ance.” -
“Is this the place?” asked the second
magpie after he had returned the Gen-
eral's salute and Lady Jane's bow.
“See for yourself, brother—weather-
cock — orchard — two streams. And
can you doubt that yonder old dame
toddling out of the kitchen is good old
Mère Bigaud, of whom Pierre used to
speak to his friend the Sergeant 2"
“In that case,” returned the second
magpie, “we had better be off. The
other two are waiting for us. Every-
thing is ready.”
Mère Bigaud stood by her door and
saw the two flashes of black and white
flicker and swerve across the sky.
“One—two," quoth she, counting on
her fat fingers. “Next time, please
God, there will be four.”
Jimmy and Jane did not see their
friends the magpies again. The worthy
couple were fast asleep in their shed
when the four brothers flew across the
roof of the farm in the early dawn of
the following day.
Towards noon General Jim, taking a
stroll in the farmyard, called Lady Jane
to his side.
“Come here, my dear,” said he.
“Your eyes are better than mine. Is
not that old Mère Bigaud by the win-
dow there? I can see her blue gown,
but I can't make out what that is she
has got in her arms.”
Jane peered forward.
“That white bundle, do you mean?”
“Yes. There's something alive in-
side it.”
“How short-sighted you are getting,
James!" said Lady Jane. “Can't you
see what it is, that fluffy soft brown
thing? I know. It's a gosling—a
human one.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ALTHough Mr. E. F. BENsoN has called his latest story
Robin Linnet (HUTCHINsoN), you will not be very long
in discovering that the interest of it is focussed less
upon Robin himself than upon the parent-bird, Robin's
mother, Lady Grote. Not at first, perhaps, is this interest
very robust; indeed at times you may be tempted to
suspect Mr. BENSON of having created a group of his own
supremely lifelike persons without altogether knowing
what to do with them. Chiefly the coming of the War
is the theme of the matter. To Cambridge it comes,
where we get a contrasted welcome by selected under-
graduates (and you know already how good Mr. BENSON's
best quality young men can be) and a circle of almost un-
bearably realistic dons. Smart Anglo-German society,
represented by Sir Hermann and Lady Gurtner, takes the
shock of it, and that effect is admirably shown in the
struggle that results in these singularly human, if divided,
souls. Finally, and most important, it reaches Helen
Grote, a woman whose life is deliberately dedicate to
every kind of pleasure, adoring mother of a charming son,
yet capable of an amorous intrigue on her own account
with the “cat-like " personality of Kuhlmann, the great
German tenor. You perceive that Helen is like to take
the ultimatum harder than most. I won't tell you just
in what tragic fashion the great change breaks upon
her (save, as a hint, to remind you how much of their
life's emotion Mr. BENson's folk work out in the neigh-
bourhood of Floral Street, Covent Garden); nor will I spoil
by suggestion the really beautiful and tenderly-written end,
by which the author has redeemed what at first looked like
being rather too slight a study of blown straws. I admit
that his work is here unequal; but, on balance, it is a
story certainly not to be left out of your list.
John Dene of Toronto, with his breezy manner, his con-
tempt for officialdom and his super-submarine that “gin-
gered up” the Admiralty, has been written and published
and (very adroitly) brought all the way from Canada by
Mr. HERBERT JENKINs so that he cannot be mistaken for
anybody else. And yet, though his favourite expression
when people annoyed him was “Shucks,” I cannot help
feeling that it might just as well have been “Sack the lot.”
Only in that case he could not have been kept such a pro-
found secret from the English people, nor perhaps could so
many allowances have been made for his unconventional
behaviour. The author of Bindle has written another very
amusing book, and, considering that he has combined the
smashing of the U-Boat campaign with the discomfiture
of a Teutonic spy, and thrown in a very pretty love-story,
not to mention some thinly-veiled Cabinet personalities, I
don't know what more any reader can require. After John
Dene himself I think Dorothy, his typist, who is a White-
hall flapper, but not a very flapping one, is the nicest person
in the book; but I am very fond of Mr. Llewellyn John (this
is the curious name of the Prime Minister), who says, “If
I were only told ; if I were only told. They keep so much
from me.” As for the plot it was the detective part of it

that interested me most ; the exploits of the submarine
were thrilling enough, but I am getting a little weary of
the ginger that might have been.
Do you seek a lively and frivolous diversion from the
oppressive problems of the hour? If so, let me warmly
recommend to your notice Short and Sweet (LANE), the col-
lected outbursts of the late Captain H. N. GITTINs, thirty-
four in the most engaging prose and a dozen in verse, less
expert but occasionally pleasing. The former constitute
some gay chapters in the life of a young man about town,
not so preoccupied with his work at the Bar as to be pre-
cluded from falling in and out of love daily and taking part
in the other fashionable pastimes of the day. Flippant
they may all be, but behind the excellent humour is some
very sound sense and no little understanding of that diffi-
sees her mistake and returns to Eugene and her beloved
County Cork when it is time to bring the story to a just
conclusion. It is not for its treatment of the Irish Question
—though Miss CUMMINs neither evades nor over-colours the
tragic aspect of an Ireland divided against herself—that I
was attracted by The Land They Loved, but for its deft
handling of peasant character, its unforced humour and its
intimate knowledge of the racy speech of the Irish country-
folk and the curious mixture of ingenuousness and agility
that distinguishes their mental processes.
During the Autumn of 1915 Lieutenant GEoFFRY MALINs
was appointed official kinematographer to the War Office,
and in How I Filmed the War (JENKINs) he relates his
thrilling and dangerous experiences. To do him justice he
does not seem to be embarrassed by any great excess of
cult sex which he was for ever
worrying with his brilliantly
conducted proposals of mar-
riage. Most refreshing of all is
the author's pretence of a vast
sense of his own importance,
camouflaging a young philo-
sopher with an exact sense of
proportion and an irresistible
tendency to laugh and make
laugh. Would you have in your
library a permanent reminder
of the tragedy suffered and the
immeasurable glory won by
your country, 1914 to 1918?
Let me then press even more
warmly upon you this little
book, as showing indirectly, in
a single instance, what Eng-
land has lost in young men
who have won so much for
England. Captain GITTINs,
known to many through his
work in Punch, died on active
service in France on March
20th, 1917, aged twenty-four
years. These, his writings, are y^
compiled by his family in his
memory. There could have
been no tribute more modest
or more delicately conceived;

modesty, and I think that he
would have persuaded me more
easily of the importance of his
work if he had not so vigorously
emphasized it. The fact, how-
ever, remains that he did per-
suade me, and I can also testify
that his tale of perils encount-
ered makes a remarkable story,
in spite of the style in which it
is told. Nothing stopped him,
and even the PRINCE of WALEs,
who seems to have been amaz-
ingly clever in dodging the offi-
cial camera, was unable to elude
his pursuit. There seems to be
no doubt of the wide public in-
terest that his films attracted;
and those who missed them on
the move may in part be compen
sated by some most excellent illu.
strations, of the stationary kind,
that accompany his narrative.
No reasonable being can com-
plain of a word-shortage in The

the public attention.
A gift of quiet humour and a singular freedom alike from
bitterness and sentimentality have gone to the making of
Miss CUMMINs' The Land They Loved (MACMILLAN), qualities
sufficiently rare in novels dealing with the Ireland of to-day.
I will admit frankly that I cannot understand how Eugene
Turpin, who for fear of being disinherited grovels like a
whipped worm before his old brute of a father, can suddenly
blossom into the strong and sane man of the countryside
once the menace is removed; but then I do not pretend to
have fathomed what is called Irish mentality. Strange
things pass for cowardice in Ireland, and stranger things
for courage, and it may well be that Eugene's willingness to
undergo any toil and humiliation in order to get possession
of the land he loved should have been appreciated by Kate
Carmody at the outset. But Kate runs to vigour rather
than to subtlety, and, thinking Eugene a poor creature,
departs into service in Dublin, where her adventures provide
Miss CUMMINs with the material for quite the most
entertaining chapters of her story. Needless to say, Kate
public-school days to the time when he qualified as a
doctor, is here set out. But if he is a little too con-
scientious Major BRETT YouNg is a sound descriptive
writer, and he places North Bromwich, the Midland town
in which Edwin lived, before our eyes so that we can
see it and feel it and shudder at it. Imaginative minds
have a tendency to wilt in such an environment, and
Edwin, with his youthful longings and indefinite aspirations,
had to fight hard before he could shake himself free of its
depressing atmosphere. It was bound to be a long struggle;
but one may still complain that in his chronicle of it Major
BRETT YouNg has paid nearly as much attention to the
small skirmishes as to the really important engagements.
This means that you must be at some pains, which the
author might have saved you, to make your own selection
of the things worth remembering. But your patience, if you
have enough of it, will be justified.

THE DECLINE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES.
[“WATCHMAN,”, in The Times, diagnosing the causes of the
threatened extinction of the Middle Classes, contrasts their simple
frugality in the Victorian era with the “motor-car and champagne
standard ” which they have subsequently adopted, and further
ascribes their decadence to neglect of municipal duties.]
BITTER thought that every day which passes,
Making their emoluments more lean,
Tends to extirpate the Middle Classes,
Nullify that useful go-between,
Which, like Virtue (ARIsToTLE), constitutes the happy
IIlean.
What! Shall we in torpid silence suffer
These to vanish in the vast unknown,
Once our White Hope, once the stolid buffer
Twixt the nether and the upper zone,
When the late VICTORIA (bless her l) occupied the
British throne?
Shall we lose this backbone of the nation,
Type of all we have of sound and sane,
Which, to make a modest calculation,
Furnished, ere it went upon the wane,
Half of England's thews and ninety-five per cent. of
England's brain?
Theirs the blame, I hear; they grew too bloated;
They assumed aristocratic airs,
Dined above themselves, and jazzed and moted,
Dealt in highly speculative shares; -
Worst of all, they took no interest in municipal
affairs.
What is left them in the coming clearage?
Whither will they fade away in night?
They will either have to swell the Peerage
Or on Labour's lower plane alight,
Passing, as they fall, the toilers in their steady
upward flight.
Ah! it must not be. We cannot lose 'em ;
We should never look upon their like.
Let them join the Union; let them do some
Pretty spadework in the ultimate dyke;

and when to strike. O. S.
MORE REVELATIONS.
Of the many new War books published to-day up to the
time of going to press there is one which, on account of the
inside knowledge and the vigorous style of the author, will
appeal alike to those who study war and to those who pay
for it.
Commentaries, 1914-1918, is the work of that war-
hardened veteran, General Le Bukkin, and, although his
book pretends to be little more than a digest of letters and
memoranda addressed by him to the War Office, yet its
five hundred closely printed pages glow with sensation as
the General wields his pen in deadly cut and thrust against
the “utter incompetence and imbecile frivolity of those who
brought the Empire to the brink of disaster.”
In a preface General Le Bukkin relates how, in August,
1914, he was rusticating at his country seat, and thus it
was not until he came to London on the occasion of an
Old Comrades' Dinner on Inkerman Day that he was aware
that hostilities had broken out. The War Office had failed
to notify him. With characteristic energy he went straight
to his Club and wrote a letter not only to The Times, but
to the authorities at Whitehall. From this moment General
Le Bukkin never looked back. Until the cessation of
hostilities he acted continuously as an unofficial adviser to
the War Office.
The opening chapters of his Commentaries are devoted
to criticisms of the equipment of our troops in 1914. Most
of this is in a highly technical vein, but even the average
man will appreciate the seriousness of the author's con-
demnation of our service rifle, which “not only fired a smaller
º but was also several inches shorter, than the Brown
ess.”
General Le Bukkin contends that the War Office never
had a fixed policy. When in difficulties they disregarded
expert advice and embraced any idea so long as it was
newfangled. He instances how in 1915, when the mili-
tary situation was far from satisfactory, “the War Office
chose this moment to swap horses in mid-stream. They
hurriedly decided to change the colour of the riband of the
Long Service Medal on the ground that it was the same
colour as that of the V.C.”
Receiving little encouragement and less thanks, General
Le Bukkin still lavished upon the War Office all manner of
mature advice, from details of precautions to be taken when
firing red-hot shell to a nicely reasoned treatise on the
advantages of carrying the feed-bag on the off-side. In
his lengthy chapters on the tank the General displays his
indomitable courage. In a country where there is scarcely
a family which does not number a tank-inventor among its
members he has the hardihood to state, coldly and em-
phatically, that the tank was a costly failure. He claims
that trained elephants, of which we had an inexhaustible
supply in India, capable of living on the country in France,
would have served our purpose better. In the chapter
“Blephant Mastership and Stable Vices" he elaborates
his assertion and concludes with a breathless description
of the moral effect of elephants in action during the Second
Sikh War. “As the rising sun gilded the minarets of the
doomed city, 's elephants, extended to two elephants'
length, the outer flanks dressing on the centre guide, the
centre guide covering the troop leader at a distance of two
elephants' lengths, trunk to croup, and the led elephant
with the mess stores in the serre-file rank, went forward
with irresistible momentum, to the sound of the charge and
the beating of drums.”
During the critical days of 1918 the task of General Le
Bukkin would have daunted a lesser man. He was now in
daily touch with the War Office by post, and although,
as our star grew brighter, it became very doubtful if we
should lose the War after all, yet he never slackened his
efforts. Indeed it is in July of that year that we see him
at his best: “The politicians, who had ever ignored or
ridiculed the experts, now, like mischievous boys, com-
menced to undermine the moral of the army ... Flushed
by the capture of thousands of prisoners and an immense
quantity of material, they thought fit to tamper with the
sacred traditions of the British Army. They abolished the
left-hand salute.”
This book draws a picture of a very depressing state of
affairs, but we must of course defer judgment until the War
Office issues a reply.
This, if it happens, will be a novel experience for the
General. -

Coster. “OH, 'E's A GooD ' UN AT TIMEs ALL RIGHT, BUT "E DON'T ALWAYS CHoose: THE RIGHT TIME."
A FRESH-AIR FIEND.
IT has been noted on many occasions,
I believe, that the virtues of a first wife
grow in proportion to the shortcomings
of the second. In other words, that it
is only human nature to make the best
of things as they were.
As far as matrimony is concerned I
hasten to add that I can claim no first-
hand experience, but I am certain this
principle applies to our memories of the
great War.
Looking back, no one can fail to
observe that there were many things
peculiar to those times which were
infinitely preferable to our present state
of—peace, shall we call it? since there
are now only twenty-three wars out-
standing. Reluctantly I am forced to
the conclusion that the War, as a war,
had many good points. Indeed, when
one comes to think of it, bar the noise
and the practical certainty of death,
there was very little wrong with it.
Flat on one's tummy, for instance, one
had no time for gloomy retrospection
over a mis-spent youth, nor did the
vista of a speculative future appal one.
One lived furiously in the present, and
the less likelihood there seemed to be of
remaining alive the more intense was
the desire to avoid extinction. Then
there was whisky in the Mess; there
was always the chance of going out to
rest some day; there was the delight of
seeing the A.M.L.O. again; but far, far
above all these considerations was the
joy, the unutterable joy to be found in
the freedom to indulge, unquestioned
and uncensured by the demon Hygiene,
in a genuine whole-hearted “fug." Oh,
all ye demobilised, have I not touched a
chord there?. What would you not give
for a batman, a brazier, a thirty-foot
dug-out and a seething, simmering
satisfying tobacco-laden “fug”—just
for once?
Possibly you may recall having lately
passed a man in the streets nodding and
smiling to himself as if obsessed by the
thought of some special good fortune,
and possibly also you have put him
down as one of the lucky ones who
bought “Shells” at three-and-a-half.
But you were wrong. It was I, fatuous
with the anticipation of winter coming
on and the “fug” I would get up just
once, for old times' sake. Though they
never knew it at home, preparations had
been going on for some time. I had
hoarded coal, building up sly nests of it
in odd places. I had saved chunks of
wood on the plea of taking up fret-work
on dulldays. One chilly November day, I
promised myself, I would invite a crony
who would appreciate my humour and
together we would revel once again in
an overheated atmosphere, fill the place
with the indescribable scents of the
oldest pipes and the fume of “Ruby
Queens" (of which I still have a store),
and then hold forth about the dear old
War.
I could not hope, of course, to get my
old batman, the taciturn Mr. Brown,
to come and cook me slabs of ration
beef (carefully scraped) and serve me up
the good old tinned apricots and demi-
custard (to be eaten with the aid of the
company fork and a piece of blanket-
encrusted bread). Those days are gone
irrevocably; but the atmosphere—that
at least could be re-created. Then we
would drink whisky out of my alu-
minium mug and praise God and the
great War.
But the “fug” has failed. Just as my
preparations were nearing completion
and the necessary invitation had been is-
sued an unlooked-for calamity occurred.
A fresh-air fiend came to stay with us.
She came disguised as a female. To a

mere man one could explain one's little
weakness and he would understand; at
most he would but smile a pitying smile
of tolerance; but a woman—no. She
would only regard you as the kind of
person to whom a hot bath is a luxury.
. I have succumbed. Just as many
people would rather die of pneumonia
than admit that they mind the bitter
blast from the open window of a railway
carriage, so do I respond to the eternal
remark, “Don’t you find it stuffy in
this room ?” I said I had succumbed.
Nay, pressing my breast against the
thorn, I encourage her to further ex-
cesses rather than face the implication,
the stigma of being an habitual frowster.
Oh, my home, my home, my little grey
home, it is not the thing I was wont to
picture when we sang “It's a long,
long trail awinding" in the Mess on
guest-nights. Breakfast is no longer a
meal, it is a scramble lest the food
should be blown off one's fork. Chill
blasts sweep through the room whilst
the fresh-air fiend sits and smiles and
says, “Oh, isn't there a delightful
breeze 2 " We might as well sell our
windows for all the use they are. Great
waves rush up the sides of my porridge
bowl; the jam wrinkles like a sand-
dune, and one has only to put knife to
the egg for the toff to be swept off by
the force of the gusts. .
Blast or hurricane disturbs not the
fresh-air fiend; her smile grows broader
and more fatuous as the breeze freshens
and the poached eggs flitter off the
plates. On the very day which I had
set apart for the indulgence in my
harmless little vice I came home and
found her trying to relight the fire.
“I can't think what is the matter
with it,” she said idiotically; “it went
out all of a sudden.” -
Of course I knew that it had been
blown out, but I hadn't the courage to
tell her; I just mumbled, “How extra-
ordinary ! Are you sure you lit it 2."
and went to rescue my typewriter from
the wall, where it had been fluttering
helplessly.
. By this time, of course, all idea of
carrying out my intention had been
abandoned. Upstairs I found a woman,
blue as any woad-stained warrior of
ancient Britain, and she turned out
to be my wife enjoying the fresh air.
The nurse and I battled our way down
the passage just in time to rescue the
child from being squeezed to death by
the forcible closing up of the Treasure
Cot. In the bedroom the gas fire was
burning, but it gave out no heat, and I
could see that the thing was frozen
stiff. Really, if the fresh-air fiend had
not blown herself up with the geyser
I don't know if I should have survived
another week of her. The explosion

accident, geysers being so hard to re-

The fresh-air fiend has gone, but to
a certain extent her influence remains

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WOOL-GATHERER.
Appleyard has returned from Arch-
angel a changed man. He went as
a careless adventurer, popular, light-
hearted and happy-go-lucky; he now
pores over commercial papers and is
afraid of postmen. It is not that he
has in any way compromised himself
with the Government or anybody else
in North Russia. It is his popularity
that has been his undoing.
During the recent War in France the
Archangel was warming up nicely
when Appleyard landed. By the time
he had reached the Front and his first
mail found him, the mosquitoes were in
song and the troops in shorts. Apple-
yard had his mufflers unpacked and
piled in a dump. He then summoned
the village headman and ordered him
sternly to parade every living soul who
had a neck. The wondering peasants,
moujik, barishna and malinki (which
in Appleyard's Russian meant man,
woman and child) were filed past the
peasants only smiled and offered Apple-
yard tea when he tried it. But mufflers
persisted in arriving, not regularly but,
all the more dreadfully, in intermittent
accumulations. Crates of them ad-
dressed to Appleyard congested the
transport routes. Barges burdened
with them littered the sandbanks. His
name stank in the nostrils of railway
and river transport officers. He was
reported on as one of the difficulties of
the campaign, like the language, the
sand-bar at Gunner's Bridge and the
manhood of England were
knitted at impartially. The
trenches were full of worsted
things. No one but platoon
commanders and men of
their kidney appreciated the
seriousness of the situation.
Let it suffice now to say
that the War ended none too
SOOll.
The moment the Armis-
tice was signed the women
of England studied the news-
papers to discover who were
likely to be cold next.
Then Appleyard men-
tioned to his people that he
was going to Archangel in
May. Instantly as the news
flashed from his people to
his people's people, and
their people and so on,
countless knitting - needles
flickered into activity again,
refreshed by their brief qui-
escence. Appleyard was the
excuse—poor little Apple-

Only the withdrawal
saved him, if he is saved.
Coming down the Dvina to
embark for home, he was
met by a cheerful ass, who
announced, as who should
utter good tidings, “There's
a whacking big mail for you,
old boy—several parcels.”
A new strange look settled
on Appleyard's face, his
hands worked spasmodi-
cally, but he said quite
calmly, “Oh, where?”
“In the sheds at the Sab-
ornia Quay,” was the heart-
less reply.
That night Appleyard fell,
not physically, but morally.
He. whose every action
would hitherto challenge
the publicity of daylight
crept forth under cover of

security of home, amidst
the fatuous conviviality of
his clubmates, Appleyard is
more of them than of any other knitted
article can be produced in a given time.
Appleyard couldn't or wouldn't de-
cline to accept these gifts, nor could
he include them all in his kit; for his
departure coincided with the intensest
period of the shipping shortage. His
devoted mother diverted the torrent of
wool to Mr. Cox's muffler department
(a necessary innovation of the late War)
and Mr. Cox arranged to despatch
weekly consignments to North Russia.

it seemed to him that there was more

Acting faithfully on his orders, this lad
informed each recipient that the British
troops had been trained from infancy
in the belief that among Slavs none but
the most incarnadined of the Reds ever
appeared publicly with nude necks.
From that day those villagers were
inseparable from their mufflers. By

THE REPRISAL.
“. . . I PRESSED the trigger and shot
it through the head. A second later
and I should have been a dead man.”
The speaker was Crockston, newly
returned aſter seven years' absence,
mostly in the wilder parts of South
America. “It’’ was a panther or a
puma, or maybe a squirrel or a meercat,
for this was the tenth story of the kind
and I had ceased to follow them very
closely. Then he added—
“You people who live in civilised
countries, within call of a policeman,
don't know what life is.”
It was the fourth time that he had
made that same remark, and it mad-
dened me. For a moment indeed I
found myself wishing fiercely that he
had pressed his trigger a second later.
Then an idea came to me and I crossed
the room and opened the casement.
My flat overlooks Kensington Gar-
dens, and on the cold damp air of the
autumn evening was borne the mourn-
ful cry, “All out! All out !”
“What's that 2" asked Crockston.
“It's the keepers clearing the Gardens
at dusk,” I answered. “I never hear
it without thinking of poor Binney.”
“Who's poor Binney?”
I closed the window and sat down
again before the fire.
“I forgot you wouldn't know,” I
said. “You remember that the winter
of 1917-18 was extraordinarily severe 2
But no, you wouldn't remember that
either, of course. Well, it was. The
gales at the beginning of January were
terrific. Quantities of sea-birds took
refuge inland, and they swarmed beside
the Serpentine as never before. A poor
enough refuge, for it soon became a
sheet of ice. Yet the gulls remained,
too much alarmed by the gales to re-
turn to the sea-shore. At first some
people made sporadic attempts to feed
them. But this soon ceased; food was
too scarce and the birds too plentiful;
and every day the gulls became wilder
and more ravenous.
“There was a man named Binney
who had the flat over this, a curious
little creature of eccentric appearance
and miserly habits. Food rationing
did him badly, because for years he had
made it a practice never to go to the
same shop twice, thinking in some
vague way that this tended to economy.
“One day Binney had been out in
search of food. Not very successfully,
for he was returning across Rensing-
ton Gardens towards closing time with
nothing more appetising than a rather
high herring in a piece of newspaper.
He took the path which leads by
Peter Pan's statue. Looking back, it
seems a mad thing to have done, for it

brought him and his herring into the
midst of a cloud of starving sea-
birds; but it is easy to be wise after
the event.
“Even then all might have been well
with him had he abandoned his herring
at once and fled. But the instinct of
parsimony was too strong, and he clung
to it like grim death—an ominous sim-
ile! Yes, they had him down just at
the top of the rise. A dozen of those
cruel beaks penetrated his jugular vein.
He cried out once, and once only, for
help. But the keepers were just clos-
ing the Gardens, and it was mistaken
for “All out !” Next morning nothing
was found but a skeleton, a bunch of
keys, a pair of boots and a collar with
dicky attached.”
Crockston left soon after, nor did he
tell me any more stories of adventure.
During the War I was strongly against
reprisals, but I doubt now if I was
right. It is certain that they act as a
powerful deterrent.

BENCH-WARFARE.
A FRAGMENT of forensic frightfulness,
illustrating some effects of the War on
the relations between Bench and Bar,
and demonstrating how counsel, the
suspicious rivals of other days, have
in the approved style learnt to com-
bine in alliance against the common
judicial foe.
BAR Council, INTELLIGENCE SUM-
MARY, 1.2.21.
Map reference: Strand, 1/ £13s.6d.
Situation.
The enemy was very active this morn-
ing in the DivisionALcourt sector, their
Heavy Authorities carrying out a search-
ing shoot from 11.29 to 11.43. During
the day also several bombshells fell
into our front bench with violent re-
ports. Three of our arguments were
exploded in rapid succession.
About 15.21 a barrage of cachinna-
tory joke-shells was put down from the
centre of the enemy's position, our
troops complaining that their eyes
were full of tears and their sides ached
for some hours afterwards.
Harassing fire of High Explosive
interruptions went on intermittently
throughout the day.
The actual damage done was slight,
but the moral of counsel occupying this
sector is stated to have been severely
shaken.
The enemy's moral has correspond-
ingly increased, and for the rest of the
day any mouth that opened from our
benches was promptly silenced by a
concentration of ire.
Casualties.
Our casualties were as follows:—
One leader blown out of court.
One leader lost his clients.
One leader evacuated to the A.B.C.
to be treated.
Two juniors severely wounded in
the feelings.
Four juniors reported as having lost
their cases and eight their heads.
One usher rendered speechless
(N.Y.D. gas).
(It is worthy of note that an Associate,
who was lying out in No Man's Land
throughout the day, under cover of
the enemy's parapet, sustained no-
thing worse than slight yell-shock.)
Patrols.
A patrol, consisting of one junior and
four clerks with a Lewis and Lewis
gun, left our benches at 16.20 yester-
day and carefully reconnoitred the
enemy front line. -
The position was found to be unoccu-
pied. A plaid rug was brought away,
but has afforded no clue for the pur-
poses of identification. -
Artillery.
Our Artillery carried out pre-arranged
shoots as follows:—
One Heavy Law Officer shelled the
village of DivisionALcourT with
F.E. from 10.30 to 10.30}.
Four High Loquacity K.C.'s were
detailed specially to direct fire
upon the enemy's support - line,
book-dumps, etc.
Sixteen counsel of all calibres fired
short bursts of application fire
twice during the day, apparently
in order to obtain more practice.
The LUNCHEoN Counter - Battery
group was unable to function
throughout the afternoon.
Enemy Movement.
An enemy was seen to be struck by
a fragment of an Idea at about 13.25 and
fell instantaneously. He was plainly
visible at 13.27, being helped by two
others down JUDGEs' C.T., proceeding
in the direction of LUNCHEoN.
All three had abandoned their equip-
ment.
An F.O.O., observing from PUBLIC
GALLERY O.P., reports that a head was
visible on the extreme right of the
enemy's sector from about 14.15 to
14.27, vanishing suddenly at the latter
hour. Shortly afterwards snores were
heard.
A mine of information on the left of
the enemy's position exploded at 11.37
and blazed for several minutes. The
heat was terrific.
A shorthand-writer is reported miss-
ing (believed grilled).
News from other Fronts.
It is officially announced that SILK
was yesterday taken by an advanced
detachment of the Chancery Division.
The booty is likely to be very great.
Over five hundred conveyances of all
kinds have already been counted. The
SolicITOR-GENERAL has telegraphed
congratulations to the successful troops,
remarking that there is no Division the
members of which understand more
clearly that Deeds are more profitable
than Words.

THE winds that blow from Simla
No summons southward bring,
Nor envy we the melody
Your Simla minstrels sing;

But we would not exchange
Our own Blue Hills, our Nilgiris,
For all your Simla range.
Back in the early ages,
When life was new and gay,
A laughing god with magic rod
Sported an idle day;
He took the heartening Channel breeze,
The Scillies' vault of blue,
And on our hills, our Nilgiris,
He stablishéd the two.
Smiling, he cast about him
And bent to his decree
Moons that beguile the wandering Nile
And suns of Sicily;
And then, that homesick hearts in pain
Might comfort find and cheer, -
He bade the North Sea mist and rain
Keep certain season here.
He chose the crags of Snowdon,
The rolling Lothian laws,
And planted these with English trees,
With Scottish whins and haws;
He tricked them out with beck and
burn
That happy holiday,
Then kissed each new-made toy in turn
And, winging, went his way.
Ah! hills of happy hunting,
In frolic wrought and love,
How oft since then have suffering men
Sought comfort from above;
In sadness, solitude and ill
These healing ways are trod,
Where in the spirit lingers still
That gay and kindly god.
Across the dreaming hilltops
The dallying seasons creep,
And day with day they herd away
As shepherds herd their sheep;
A lotus-land of afternoon,
Of solace and release,
Where day to day and moon to moon
And year to year is peace.
The whin and fir of Ooty,
The rose of Kodanad,
The Druid branch of Avalanohe
Are Heaven's own accolade;
He that hath eyes and with them sees,
Who knoweth his desire,
His own Blue Hills, the Nilgiris,
Shall hold his heart entire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
Essen CE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 10th.-In future
the PRIME MINISTER will attend the
House of Commons on Thursdays to
answer Questions. This handsome con-
cession failed to satisfy Sir F. BANBURY,
who wanted to know whether he would
ever “take his place as an ordinary
Prime Minister.” As if Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE could be an ordinary Prime
Minister! That notable stylist, Mr.
Hogge, grunted out that the PRIME
MINISTER’s excuses were “all hum-
bug,” and was sharply rebuked by the
SPEAKER, who still entertains old-fash-
ioned ideas about the decencies of
debate.
A rather cryptic sentence in the
PRIME MINISTER's Guildhall speech,
expressing the hope that the Powers
would soon be able to organise peace
among the warring sections in Russia,
was translated by Mr. Botto MLEY into
an intention to open negotiations with
the Bolshevist leaders. Mr. THOMAS
thereupon jumped to the conclusion
that the Government had decided to
adopt the policy of the Labour Party,
and asked why they had not said so
during last week's debate. Mr. BonAR
LAw was evidently in some doubt as
to what his right hon. friend did mean,
but was confident that it was not what
the Labour Party meant. Members
took such comfort as they could from
his assurance that the olive-branch
would not be tendered to LENIN and
TRotsky without the House being first
consulted.
Desiring to check the growing tend-
ency of Ministers to promise that such
and such a thing shall be done “shortly,”
Capt. TERRELL, who is happily, still
young enough to remember his childish
experiences, inquired whether “shortly”
meant “This year, next year, some-
time, or never.” But Sir A. G. Bos-
CAwFN is too old a Parliamentary hand
to be caught with such juvenile chaff.
“‘Shortly,” he said, “means “within a
reasonable period.’”
Good progress was made with the
Industrial Courts Bill. An attempt by
Sir F. BANBURY to limit the cost of
administration to ten thousand pounds
was defeated by Sir Robert HoRNE,
who pointed out the impossibility of
framing a definite estimate until he
knew the extent to which the Courts
would be resorted to. Mr. CLYNEs’
suggestion that, in order to remove the
controversy regarding the measure in
Trade Union circles, it should be di-
vided into two parts, was also rejected
after Lord R. CECIL (recollecting a case
before SoLoMon, J.) had declared that
such an operation would give the Bill
its death-blow.
Mr. Hogg|E's declaration, in the course
of the debate, that he had no leader, is
understood to have given great satis-
faction to Sir DoNALD MACLEAN, who
feels that a considerable burden of
responsibility has been lifted from his
shoulders.
Tuesday, November 11th.--This being
Armistice Day the House of Commons
marked the occasion by a small at-
tendance and a short sitting. It is
charitably supposed that the absent
Members were busy advancing the good
cause of the League of Nations else-
where.
The CHAIRMAN of CoMMITTEEs seized
the opportunity to get through some
further emendations of the Standing
THE HORNBILL WHICH HAS LATELY
BEEN ADDED TO THE ZOO IS NOT
TO BE MISTAKEN FOR ONE OF THE
HORNE BILLS WHICH ARE NOW BEING
HATCHED AT WESTMINSTER.
Orders, necessitated by the passage of
the Local Government Acts of 1888
and 1899. This rapid progress encour-
ages unruly Members to hope that in
a few years the House may find time
to complete the unfinished paragraph
relating to the punishment for dis-
orderly conduct which since 1902 has
ended in a painful aposiopesis.
Question-time produced an unusual
amount of important information, e.g.,
that, though we are not at war with
the Bolshevists, they treat our captured
men as prisoners of war (Mr. HARMs-
worth); that “there is no such thing
as a policy of the War Office” (Mr.
CHURCHILL), and that the rumour that
a British Prince has been invited to
ascend the throne of Hungary has not
reached the Foreign Office.
Judging from the tone in which the
SECRETARY of THE TREASURY gave the
terms of the proposed French Lottery
Loan, I should infer that the attitude
of the British Exchequer was accu-
rately depicted in last week's cartoon.
There was a distinctly challenging note
in his remark that no Great Power had
issued a State lottery loan in recent
years, though he believed that proposals
for one had been “made in Germany.”
After a chequered debate the Agri-
cultural Councils Bill secured a second
reading. Inter alia, it is to dispel the
monotony of rural districts by pro-
moting recreation, thus endorsing the
late Lord SALISBURY's opinion, circa
1894, that what the country-folk re-
quired was not Parish Councils but
circuses.
Several Members advocated the es-
tablishment of a separate department
to deal with Fisheries, and Lieut.-
Commander KENworthy expressed the
hope that before long there would be a
system of aerial transport for the
carriage of fish—on the principle, I sup-
pose, that the higher it goes the fresher
it will arrive.
Despite the recent vote of the House
of Commons, the Peeresses are still to
be kept outside Paradise. Their lord-
ships considered that the Commons had
been poaching upon their preserves,
and they have notoriously little sym-
pathy with poachers. Besides, as the
LoRD CHANCELLOR pointed out, the
House as at present constituted is
under sentence of death, and it would
be an ill compliment to the ladies to
invite them to share in its impending
dissolution. So the Commons' Amend-
ment to the Sex (Removal of Disqualifi-
cations) Bill was unanimously turned
down.
|Wednesday, November 12th.-As Earl
HAIG, escorted by Lords DERBY and
ScARBOROUGH, marched up the floor to
take the oath and his seat, the Peers,
stirred out of their usual impassivity,
broke into loud cheers; and it was
with manifest difficulty that the
LoRD CHANCELLOR, remembering stren-
uous days with the Oxfordshire Yeo-
manry in 1914, refrained from giving
him a military salute. Lord HoRNE,
another wearer of laurels won “in
Flanders Fields,” was also welcomed.
Then their lordships settled down to
discuss the importation of live cattle
from Canada. Rarely have they dis-
played such amazing unanimity. From
Lord CHAPLIN, the veteran Protection-
ist, to Lord CREwe, the ardent Free
Trader, all were agreed that these excel-
lent beasts should not be allowed to
enter our markets save in the form of
beef.
Like the gentleman in The Wearing
of the Green, Capt. WEdgwood BENN
inquired, “How's poor old Ireland, and

how does she stand 2" The position,
as elucidated by Mr. BonAR LAw and
Mr. HARMsworth, is that the Home
Rule Act comes into force (unless previ-
ously amended) when the Peace Treaty
with Turkey is ratified, and that the
Peace Treaty cannot even be presented
to the Turk until America has decided
whether she will take her share of the
white man's burden in Armenia. As
America's hesitation is believed to be
largely due to the Hibernian element
in her population it follows that the
postponement of Ireland's hopes is
chiefly due to Irishmen. Will “Presi-
dent” DE WALERA please make this
clear as he stumps the States?
Barely had Mr. BoNAR LAw re-
affirmed the Government's determina-
tion “to maintain the unity of the
Air-Service ’’ than General SEELY was
explaining (from the Opposition Front
Bench) that his retirement from the
Under-Secretaryship for Air was en-
tirely due to the existence of “dual
control.” Varying Sir Boy L.E. Roche's
famous bull, he remarked that “a man
cannot be in two places at once, even
if he is the Air-Minister.” To treat the
Air Ministry as if it were a learner's
machine with two sets of “joy-sticks”
seemed to him to be both absurd and
dangerous. Accordingly he had reached
for the parachute and made a voluntary
landing in the wilderness.
Thursday, November 13th.-An ar-
gument freely used by those who have
been clamouring for the attendance of
the PRIME MINISTER in the House of
Commons was that it would restore the
waning prestige of Parliament in the
minds of the masses. From that point
of view the first of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's
Thursday At Homes was hardly an
unqualified success.
Electricity was in the air from the
start. In a less excited atmosphere
the CHIEF SECRETARY for Ireland would
probably have refrained from describing
Mr. JEREMIAH MACVEAGH as a Sinn
Feiner; Mr. MACVEAGH would not have
retorted that Mr. MACPHERson was
“impertinent,” and the SPEARER might
perhaps have taken the merciful view
that the word was used in its literary
and not in its vulgar (and unparlia-
mentary) significance.
Mr. MACVEAGH, refusing to withdraw
the expression, had to withdraw himself.
Two-thirds of Question time had
elapsed before we reached No. 45 ad-
dressed to the PRIME MINISTER. That,
an unprovocative question about pre-
mium bonds, was answered in the usual
way. But the next dealt with Russia,
and with this Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
answered the others—some fifteen in
all—on the same subject. This was
not at all to the taste of the inquisitors.
As things were,

THING ! REMEMBER ME To No MAN's LAND.”
They wanted to put their victim on the
rack of cross-examination after each
individual Question.
But their protests were in vain. The
PRIME MINISTER gaily proceeded to
deliver what was in effect a long speech,
telling everybody what they knew be.
fore, and practically nothing that was
fresh. There was no reference to the
Guildhall speech and its Prinkipoten-
tialities; the nearest approach to it
being an announcement that the Peace
Conference would shortly discuss out-
standing problems, including Russia.
Some resentment was expressed by
Members, who considered that their
questions had been burked; but Major
MALONE removed the tension by his
plaintive appeal to the PRIME MINISTER
to answer an innocent question about
housing, seeing that he was not “the

“ANY WAY, THERE'LL BE MoRE Room Down
THERE THAN IN THAT SINGLE-SEATER PUP.”
“MY LADY GREENSLEEWES.”
“SHE is good for two guineas at
least,” I said. “She may fetch three.
She has beauty, therefore is a treasure,
and wit, and therefore is a power. In
one word she is a certain winner.”
“Who?” said my liege lady from her
bureau, turning her head somewhat
sharply at the mention of my beauty.
“Who but ‘My Lady Greensleeves,’”
said I, who had been reading over my
latest manuscript, “Greensleeves,' my
heart of gold.”
“I thought I was that,” came the
voice from the bureau.
“But this is a lady of dreams, a poor
enough thing beside you; yet not so
poor neither. She has her dower of
golden guineas.”
“If she sells for two guineas I may
forgive your infatuation. If she sells
for three she will pay the coal bill.”
(To understand the importance of
such a manuscript the reader should
know what poor folk we are, and how
we live in the country on our wits—
on my wits, I might say.)
“Please pass me an envelope,” I said.
“‘Greensleeves' shall go to market this
very night.”
“One envelope?”
“Only one. No need to enclose
another in case of rejection. Once she
goes from us, all in her gown of grassy
green, she will never come back. I
dare say she will fetch five guineas.”
“They may not have room for her,
or they may have someone else like
her in stock.”
“You have only to read her,” I cried,
“to see how absurd you are.”
“I should not like her, I’m sure,
after the way you have praised her wit
and beauty to my face.”
“Only to your back.”
“I distrust this ‘Greensleeves.' Take
my advice and buy her a return ticket.”
“It would be a pure waste of paper
and a penny-halfpenny.”
“If you love her as much as you say,
went on the voice from the bureau—it
struck me as rather cold and calculating
—“surely you would spend three half-
pence to ensure her from ending her
days in a waste-paper basket.”
And now I began to feel maddened
by this lack of faith.
“I will bet you,” I cried, “a gown
of green to a pound of tobacco that she
never comes back.”
“Now you are being absurd,” said
my liege lady. “For how can she
come back if you won't pay her return
fare?”
“I will,” I shrieked, taunted beyond
endurance. “Pass me two envelopes.
Now will you take my bet?”

The bet was taken and I addressed
the envelopes—one to the editor, the

with the other.
“To market she goes,” I said, making
for the door.

“I don't care,” I retorted hotly.
“Murk as the night is, late the hour, I

And I walked half-a-mile through dark
rural ways to our nearest pillar-box,
singing “Greensleeves” all the way.
“A certain winner,” I said, as I found
the pillar-box in the blackness of the
night. It was a Saturday night, the
post had gone and there was no collec-

Into the jaws of the box I flung “Green-

“‘Greensleeves,' now farewell,” I
cried; “and may you never come back

On the morning of the third day,
as I came into our breakfast-room, I
noticed two things at a glance. First,
the eyes of my liege lady were strangely
set upon me, and there was a gleam
in them. Second, there lay beside my
plate an envelope addressed to me in
my own handwriting.
“Oh, “Greensleeves!’”I cried. “Alas!
my poor heart of gold.”
“A gown of the grassy green, com-
plete with sleeves,” said a voice which
came to me from over the coffee-cups
—cold and calculating—“a petticoat
of the best. Also garters fringed with
gold.”
“Wait,” I said.
One ray of hope shot athwart the
gloom which encompassed me. There
is always the chance that the editor
makes use of the envelope for sending
an acceptance and a cheque. I seized
a fish-knife and slashed at the envelope.
But there lay “Greensleeves” within.
Hope dead, I dragged her forth and
threw her on to the fire.
And as the flames leapt up to destroy
all her beauty and all her wit there fell
from between the sheets of the manu-
script, as it were from my pretty one's
green sleeves, another envelope. It
was addressed “To the Editor,” and
bore a virgin stamp. I had posted
“Greensleeves” to myself.

A RIVER, mid the landscape's glories,
Is held by some to be supreme;
And lovely are the songs and stories
Lit by the running water's gleam;
Yet, save in their sequestered branches,
Rivers are marred by human sway,
And raucous trippers in their launches
Pollute the silver water-way.
The horse of all the brute creation
Is welcomed as the noblest breed—
The admirable incarnation
Ofstrength and beauty, fire and speed;
Yet, when at some renowned race-
meeting
His votaries en masse are seen,
The scents of Araby plus Keating
Will scarce avail to keep him clean.
These facts may solve the strange
enigma
That, when this noble pair converge,
Each seems to bring his special stigma,
And hippopotami emerge;
To whom I gladly would deliver
Without the very least remorse
The crowds who desecrate the river,
The mobs who vulgarise the horse.

THE DOUBLE.
THERE must be few minor agonies
more disturbing than the presence of a
constant suspicion, which no amount
of investigation can ever confirm or
disperse.
And when a matter of eighty Brad-
burys—or, I should say, eighty Fishers
—is concerned, why, then . . .
On the assumption that everyone
now bets on horses, I have latterly
opened all casual conversations in
street and tram, office and bus, lift and
cloak-room, with the remark, “I hope
you backed Brigand?” and in ninety-
nine cases out of a hundred the answer
indicated that, although that most de-
sirable proceeding was not indulged in,
money had been invested on one or
more of the Cambridgeshire runners.
The honour of being the hundredth
man fell to the old waiter at a certain
chop-house.
No, he said, he hadn't backed Brigand
or anyone else. Because he didn't hold
with betting. A mug's game. He'd
never had but one bet in his puff, and
that was enough for him. Too much,
in fact, for it had poisoned his life.
“Poisoned?” I repeated.
“Yes,” he said, “poisoned. It was
like this: I never took any interest in
racing, except now and then to be
barged into and very nearly knocked
down by newspaper boys rushing about
with the winner of the three-thirty, till
one day a customer here—a nice affable
gent too—when the time came to pay
hadn't a brown left for me, so he said,
‘I can't give you any money, Robert,
but I'll give you a tip of a better kind.
To-morrow there's a double that 's a
cert—Pheumonia and Knightsbridge.’
You know what a double is ? Both
horses have to win or you don't get any-
thing; but if both win you get a packet.
“As I knew nothing about racing I
went to a pal who was going to the
races and handed him a sovereign, for,
‘If I'm going to gamble,' I said, ‘I'll
do it proper. Put that on Pneumonia
and Knightsbridge for the double,' I
said. “Right-o,’ he said. “Don't for-
get,' I said. “Right-o,' he said, and
then I went home to bed.
“But I couldn't sleep for thinking
about those two horses. And all next
day I was like a maniac. Every time
I heard a paper-boy my heart turned
right over. At lunch I got all the orders
wrong. I served mulligatawny instead
of custard, and if I broke one plate I
broke twenty. My hand was like a
shuttle. And then at last I got a paper
with the first of my races in it, and
found that Pneumonia had won at 10
to 1. I could hardly stand up. -
“Half the double had come home,
sorry. I forgot it.'
and all I had to do now was to win the
other half and then I'd be a millionaire
—a SoLLY JoEL and HARRY LAUDER
rolled into one, for that's what all that
money would mean to me.
“Well, my second race wasn't till
late, and how I got through that after- | (
noon I don't know. And then when I
had bought a paper I didn't dare to
look at it. It cost me eighteenpence
for brandy before I could bring my eyes
to the print, and there, sure enough,
Knightsbridge had won too, at 8 to 1.
Just think of it, 10 to 1 and 8 to 1—
that was eighty pounds to me and my
own quid back. No one knows what
I felt like. I was just like a baby—
I laughed and cried both together. I
thought of all the things I'd buy. I
was mad with joy.”
He stopped and gulped.
“And then in walks my pal and hands
me a sovereign. “I’m really very sorry,'
says he, “but I quite forgot to put it on
for you.'
“Well, I hope I'll never have another
shock like that. In fact I couldn't
stand another. Another would do me

whether he did or not. That's what
I meant by poisoning life. Whenever
I meet him I look him in the eye and
wonder and wonder. ‘Did you have
eighty of the best off me, or didn't you?'

like. But I shall never know. Is he

DELECTABLE DISCOVERIES.
RECENTLY returned from a “hurried
glimpse” of Cornwall, “C. K. S.” has
generously communicated to the readers
of The Sphere his impressions of, and
discoveries in, the Delectable Duchy.
Many people, he tells us, have been
disappointed in Land's End, but he
was “greatly impressed by it.” And
no wonder, for while clambering down
the rocks he saw “a perched block
identified with the tour of Dr. Syntax,
whose head, a very replica of one of
Rawlinson's caricatures, was marvel-
lously presented.” It is good to know
that these voyages of discovery are to
be continued. “Some day,” he con-
tinues, “when flying is as common as
motoring is to-day I shall fly from
Zennor to the Isles of Scilly, which I
am told are even more enchanting, over
that stretch of buried land, the ever-
romantic Lyonnesse.”
It needs but a slight effort of clair-
voyance to forecast some of the finds
that are awaiting the advent of our
modern Icarus on the shores of these
wild and picturesque islands, famous
for their luxuriant vegetation, early as-
paragus and white rabbits. -
The artistic gifts of Lord RAwLINson
no doubt the RAwLINson referred to
by “C.K.S.") were already known to
his friends, though his indulgence in the
dangerous art of caricature had been
hitherto kept a secret. There is, how-
ever, good ground for believing that the
studio in which some of his finest fres-
coes—or Trescoes, as they are called in
the Scilly dialect—were produced is still
in existence, though in a dilapidated
condition and largely overgrown with
fuchsias, geraniums and gigantic wild
gooseberries. -
Of even greater interest, however, is
the ruin of the small marine pavilion
on the Isle of Samson, where Dougi,As
HAIG, the Ettrick shepherd, composed
his famous cycle of lyrics on the diseases
of sheep, and entertained, amongst other
visitors, Sir Lewis Maurice, the soldier-
poet, the illustrious admirals Sir Nel-
son Keyes and Sir Roger Bacon, and
Archbishop French of Dublin, who
was specially attracted to the Scilly
Islands by the opportunities which
they afforded him for the ornithological
researches subsequently embodied in
his classical work, French on Birds.
Another welcome participant in these
revels was Dr. Byng, afterwards re-
nowned as the headmaster of Upping-
ham, who was in the habit of accom-
panying his tuneful host on a Birdwood
cottage grand pianoforte. Other guests
were David Beatty, the Scottish poet
and philosopher, the subject of one of the
most telling of RAWLINsoN's carica-
tures, and Lord Plumerston, whose
“spirited foreign policy” is believed to
have originated during a sojourn under
HAIG's hospitable roof.
There are many other possibilities,
but enough has been said to show what
illuminating results may be confidently
expected from the flight of so admir-
ably equipped and scholarly an explorer
as “C. K. S.” to the land of old Romance.
He has shown us “the real Cornwall";
it remains for him to complete our
enlightenment by the revelation of the
real Scilly Islands.

Indignant Maid (whose coiffure has been disapproved of). “BAD TASTE, INDEED !
NOT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE!"
AND I'VE NOT TRIED ON ONE OF YOUR HATS--No,
OUR HELPFUL HEALERS.
(With grateful acknowledgments to “The Times "Medical
Correspondent,)
A County Court Judge did well recently to call attention
to the new disease of “landlord's neurasthenia.” The
symptoms are distressing, but fortunately there is no im-
mediate danger of the malady assuming an epidemic form.
It is far otherwise with the strange and perplexing com-
plaint to which Sir Parry Gorwick has aptly given the
name of parciflumonia, the first “wave” of which, though
subsiding, affords no guarantee against its recrudescence in
an acuter form. Many persons who imagine that they
have only had a “chill” find afterwards that they cannot
recover their normal capacity for exconchation, and remain
in a state bordering on pheidolia. There is more than a
probability that they have been really suffering from a
slight attack of parciflumonia.
The point is important, because unless it is grasped people
are apt to imagine that their nerves are giving way and that
they are within a measurable distance of decano-ingitis.
Patients who take a needlessly gloomy view of life would
be well advised to recognise cause and effect and go away
for a long period to recuperate, preferably to Monte Carlo
or the Canary Islands.
It is true that the indications to-day seem to show that
the number of cases is not increasing. But it is never safe
to pin our faith to statistics. And the undulation of the
“wave” has been distinctly more undulatory than mere
figures would indicate. Unless this point is also grasped
| we may commit the error of confounding a distressing
cachexia with a healthy metabolism, the results of which
it is better not to contemplate. In the circumstances the
most rigid precautions on the part of public and authorities
are necessary. We should steer equally clear of panic and
blind confidence. So far as possible—this point again must
be firmly grasped, since we are always conditioned by pos-
sibility—cases which have been recognised should be
isolated until the risk of infection is past, and people who
feel “seedy” should consult a doctor—preferably a good
doctor, but not necessarily an expensive doctor—without
loss of time. As ABERNETHY used to say, a pill in time
saves nine.
THE FAIRY LOWER.
You walk in your orchard, you sit in your bower
Mid plentiful treasure of fruit and of flower;
But you shall have pleasaunces brighter than these,
With magical blossoms and magical trees.
Your train is of damask, rich fold upon fold,
Your gown is of crimson, your shoes are of gold;
But a mantle of rainbows shall wrap you about,
Besprinkled with star-dust within and without.
Your ladies-in-waiting are gracious and fair
And a little page stands by the side of your chair;
But an army of goblins shall do your behest
And fly at your bidding to East and to West.
You shall sit on a cushion of velvety moss,
Embroidered with sunbeams across and across,
And a grasshopper chorus shall make you good cheer
Or charm you with delicate lullabies, dear.
I will tap at your window some moon-silvered night,
And when you lean down through the jessamine white
My fairy-swift wings I shall softly unfurl
And bear you away to my palace of pearl. R. F.

AT THE PLAY.
“SACRED AND PROFANE LOVE.”
IT may have been my fault for not
having read the novel on which his
play is founded, but I could never quite
get at Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT's intentions
in regard to the application of his title.
The “sacred" part was easy enough ;
even I could guess that it was illus-
trated by the love of the heroine, Car-
lotta Peel (of the Five Towns), for the
musician, Emilio Diaz (of the world
generally); though I could find nothing
These monologues, all very lifelike,
were received by the audience, both in
the stalls and on the stage (Carlotta
had to do the listening every time,
except when she had to do the talking)
with a very decorous and absorbed
attention. As for the action that filled
in the gaps between the revelations, I
could never quite believe in the sudden
seduction of Carlotta, and still less in
those seven ensuing years, during which
she had built up a great reputation as
a novelist on the knowledge of sex ac-
quired in this rapid apprenticeship, but
made a brief inquiry as to the course
which the bullet had taken, Diaz at
once withdrew from the stage for a dose
of morphine and remained absent for
about a quarter of an hour, the sole
reason for this inhumanly apathetic
conduct being that Rosalie had to come
in from next door at that point to ask
for an explanation of the noise and to
throw off her autobiography, during
which the presence of the drug-maniac
would have been undesirable.

the rather thankless character of Diaz

able) in this young girl's sur-
render of her body at sight
on the strength of a little

“profane” love that worried
me. Was it the love of the
light woman, Rosalie (of Paris),

could trace little profanity in

tion (which came to nothing)|^
for her married publisher,
Ispenlove # If so, I could not
see that it was so much more
profane than her very uncon-
ventional relations with Diaz.
And, anyhow, the Second Act,
which dealt with this subsi-
diary affair, seemed purely in-
cidental.
In support of the former ex-
planation we have the fact that,
at their first meeting, Carlotta
had told Diaz that her name
was “Magdalen.” I don't pre-
tend to divine the author's
purpose, but, if there was any

—for though he inspired so
much “sacred” love he had
very little more attraction for
us in his right mind than out of
it—Mr. FRANKLINDYALL added
greatly to his reputation.
Mr. RoBERTs as Ispenlove
was a little colourless. Rosa-

surances that she was a “good”
and “serious” girl, was played
excellently by Miss JEANNETTE

Carlotta Miss IRrs Hoey's
gentle voice and natural man-
ner exercised their old charm,
especially in the First Act.
But there was nothing better
in the play than Mr. GEORGE
ELTON's slight sketch of a
lovable old cynic.
Mr. ARNoDD BENNETT can
easily afford to dispense with
flattery. His detached revela-
tions of character were good,
but if his ambition was to
scandalise the prejudices of a
British audience by his aud-
acity I am afraid he must have
been disappointed. We are all

invited a comparison with Rosalie,
who was by profession a real “Magda-
len;” and I take leave to suggest that a
better title for the play would have been,
“Amateur and Professional Love.”
It is a patchy piece of work, made up
of some admirable passages of self-
revelation (largely in expansive mono-
logue), stitched together with some
rather improbable action, mostly “off.”
First we had Carlotta's account of her
narrow home-life and her spiritual
yearnings; then we had a chapter of
married life from the lips of Mrs.

sketch of her professional career; and
finally another outburst in the same

periences.

The dramatic possibilities offered by
her subsequent redemption of the hero
from the deplorable habit of taking
morphine were shirked by Mr. BENNETT,
who had it done between the Third and
Fourth Act. The one difficult action
which he handled before our eyes oc-
curred when Diaz, under the influence
of the drug, threatened to shoot Car-
lotta. He recalled her identity just in
time; but the pistol didn't know of this,

THE RECENT RAG EPIDEMIC.
“WE’RE GOING TO RAID THE DOG-KENNEL To-NIGHT.
ARE YOU ON ?”
“NOTHING DoING, JUST BEEN TO THE INSURANCE OFFICE, AND THEY SAY I'VE ONLY ONE LIFE LEFT.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
For a variety of reasons few recent books have given me
such pure joy as the slender volume in which Mr. MAX
BEERBoHM has recorded his impressions of Seven Men
(HEINEMANN). Perhaps even better might it have been
called “Six men—and another,” since you will not have
turned a couple of pages without discovering whose is the
seventh personality, all pervading, a figure such as maybe
you remember, unsmiling, watching with eyes ever so
gravely malicious the self-revelation of his chosen victims.
Moreover, by special good fortune the time of most of
the tales is here the richest period of MAX, when the
dandies still wore curled hats and wit went to a muffled
music of hansom-cab bells; in short, when the world was
young and ginger yet hot in its lips. It is in this setting
that we hear the amazing fable of poor Mr. Enoch Soames
and the Devil, grimly ironical, yet filled with the most
delicate impertinence; of the literary and social rivalry of
Maltby and Braxton, and how its result drove one to wed
a descendant of the EMPEROR HADRIAN ; of James Pethel,
the super-gambler (perhaps just a suggestion out of key),
and of A. V. Laider, who was either the first liar of the
universe or who flung away the most superb short-story
situation ever revealed to man. You see already what feast
of reason is here prepared; and at the end a flow of soul
crowns the banquet, with the tragedy (in two senses)
of Brown, whose name was changed from Ladbroke to
Savonarola after the composition of surely the most turgid
historical drama in which even Mr. MAx BEERBoHM ever
took a sly and devastating hand. Believe me, the rarest
entertainment.
I think that very seldom have I encountered a volume
more blandly, more unblushingly out of date (and, I hasten
to add, less affected in value by that consideration) than the
collection of travel notes and reflections that Mr. MAURICE
BARING has now for the first time published in England (it
appeared in shorter form long ago in America) under the
title of Round the World in any Number of Days (CHATTo
AND WINDUs). The salvation of Mr. BARING in this re-
spect has been his inconsequence. The Indian Ocean, for
example, naturally provokes him to such reflections upon
climate as will but too readily suggest themselves to the sen-
sitive traveller; but for some reason it is here found equally
apt to supply the cue for an engaging parody upon the lights
of contemporary letters. Writing thus, not for an age but
for any old time, Mr. BARING can afford to snap his fingers
at the circumstance that his facts, when he condescends
to them, have for the most part been entirely falsified by the
Great Change. There is, e.g., a certain shock in finding our
author quoting with approval Dr. Johnson's dictum that
“every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a
soldier.” This d propos of NAPOLEoN–about whom the col-
lective verdict of “every man” has probably changed more
in the last five years than upon almost any subject that could
be started. But if the voice of Mr. BARING sounds thus rather
from out of the past the burden of its reflections is for

him an altogether excellent travelling companion. Also he
has in his portfolio a few (not nearly enough) pen-and-ink

for what they recall elsewhere, are altogether beyond price.
Thus, if the world that Mr. BARING went round is no
longer the same, there remains plenty of fun in watching
his circumnavigation of it.

[November 19, 1919.
It pleases me very much now to recall that when I lent
Miss PHYLLIS BottomE's first novel to someone who, of
course, didn't return it, a coolness ensued apparently out
of all proportion to the crime. . It was not quite a great
book, and, though “not quite" has become “very nearly,”
neither is A Servant of Reality (HoddRR AND STOUGHTON);
but in both there is an attitude to life that promises much
for the future, and, for the present, touches Miss BottomE's
work with a rare nobility and human tenderness. A Servant
of Reality is an after-the-war story of a man who came
back from a German prison camp broken in mind and body
and met and loved a woman whom life had made hopelessly
the wrong woman for him. His struggles, against his own
Mr. ARTHUR J. REEs is his choice of a title for The Shrieking
Pit (LANE). Inspiration, no less! Who, catching sight of
this casually on a bookstall, would not find himself in-
creasingly curious to know how a pit could shriek (admirable
word!), and why, and what? The best praise that I can
give the book is to say that no one, having been tempted
by this clamorous appeal to hand over his seven net
shillings, need consider himself defrauded. Of course hon-
our forbids that I should reveal any of the tale, beyond a
general suggestion of it as a thing of murder and marshes
and mystery. Who, in short, killed the old gentleman
whose corpse was found in the pit, and why couldn't it by
any possibility have been the nice young man who (after
convictions,to believe in Kitty's
harmlessness, and his gradual
awakening to the fact that we
have no right to ask more of
our fellow men and women
than their need of us, are the
main theme of the story. Miss
Bottom E is of those whose
conception of “living happy
ever after" has very little to
do with material things, and
Anthony, alone but made one
with his kind through pain,
is, I fancy, by her reckoning,
really a happier man than
many a bridegroom shut up
uncomprehending in a new
happiness for two.
A very modest and witty
account of good work done by
an all-comers' rest-house, with
chapel in an upper chamber, is
given by Padre P. B. CLAY-
Ton, in Tales of Talbot House
(CHATTo AND WINDUs). I take
it that it is primarily designed
as a souvenir for those who ||
had the good fortune to enjoy
its hospitality. But I will tell
the others: first (in the way
of warning) those who have a
down on padres, that they will
lose it if they read this; next,
those who believe that the War
brought its own real revel-
ation to many, that they will
find abundant proof of that
in these gaily serious pages.

the fashion of the juvenile
leads in these matters) has
been at such pains to plaster
himself with every kind of
suspicion? The story follows
what might be called the
Baker Street method, in which
an official policeman is em-
ployed to discover false clues,
arrest the wrong person, and
generally bring into glowing
relief the superior acumen of
the hero-investigator. (Some-
times I wonder whether Scot-
land Yard, in its leisure mo-
ments, can ever read detective
fiction with any real enjoy-
ment.) One or two points
there were about the shrieking
pit that even in the midst of
my thrills roused a slight feel-
ing of uncertainty. It is, for
example, surely improbable
that when a body has been
found in a pit the police,
even story-police, would not
thoroughly investigate the
spot. But if we get talking
like this I shall end by giving
away the whole matter and
depriving you of a capital en-
tertainment. One final word
of praise: in no detective tale
that ever I read does the end
altogether equal the rapture
of the pursuit; but the last-
chapter ingenuities of The
Shrieking Pit bring it con-
siderably nearer than most
I REALLY CAN'T AFFORD IT.
THEN, SIR, As
There was a Talbot House in Poperinghe from 1916 to
1918, and it had an annexe in Little Talbot House of Ypres
from the November of 1917 to the dark days before the
final counterstroke of 1918. Both were in the danger
zone; both brought a corner of heaven into the hell of
men's and officers' lives. It is proposed to found a
Talbot House in London to keep alive this Christian fellow-
ship born of the War in the still fateful days of peace.
If it have a tithe of the humour and charity which this
little book breathes, Talbot House, Trafalgar Square, will
be well worth founding. There is an unworldly reticence
as to the address of its Treasurer, but internal evidence
justifies me in assuring the many whose hearts must be
touched by this book that the energetic Vicar of St. Martin's-
in-the-Fields will gladly acknowledge their gifts.
The first point upon which I have to congratulate
to this perhaps impossible ideal.
Mr. BENNET CoPPLESTONE, whatever the theme of his
book may be, has the gift of establishing an intimate rela-
tion with his readers. A current of good-nature runs
through The Last of the Grenvilles (MURRAY), and although
Dicky Grenville, the hero, was almost too perſect a knight
I was never bored with his perſections. Indeed he can be
warmly recommended as an antidote to the exotic youths
who crowd the pages of modern fiction. The War saved
Dicky from internment in a London office and sent him
flying seawards; but he performed no miracles, except, per-
haps, that of reappearing after nearly everyone had given
him up as lost in the Battle of Jutland. There is the
quality of a tonic in Mr. CoPPLEston E's work, and this
may excuse the touch of bedside manner with which he
administers it.

CONFESSIONS OF A DRAMATIC CRITIC.
[In a supplementary review of Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT's Sacred and
Profane Love Mr. WALRLEY, of The Times, revises the estimate
he formed of it on the first night and makes the following painful
admissions: “It may be well,” he says, “to explain that one notices’
a play and then thinks it over. True, one's "notice’—the virtually
instantaneous record of one's first impressions—sometimes wears a
specious appearance of thought. But that is one of the wicked
deceptions of journalism.”]
WHEN for a paper published once a week,
That gives a writer scope for due reflection,
I have contrived a leisurely critique
Upon some fairly recent stage-confection,
And to my judgment brought
A slow and solemn gravity of thought;
Much, Mr. WALKLEY, have I marvelled how
The lore that out of ancient scribes you suck
Exuding from your broad and Attic brow
(The urgent printer's devil crying, “Buck up !"),
Pours off your non-stop pen
Between 11.0 and 11.10;-
u}),
How on a play whose price was blood and tears,
Costing its maker months of toil and anguish,
Your final word, that lifts him to the spheres
Or leaves him under your reproof to languish,
You fix with instant hand,
Stamping the thing with “Stett" (or “Let it stand " ").
And now you own that second thoughts are best;
Indeed (unless you meant to be facetious)
No previous thought had been thrown off your chest—
Only an outward semblance, very specious;
So from a god you sink
To eommon men who take their time to think.
Oh, Mr. WALKLEY, my illusion's gone ! -
Shattered my faith in those allusive nocturnes
Composed impromptu from 11.0 on,
Fast as the moving finger of the clock turns ! .
How can I know but what
Next week you'll tell us you were talking rot?
O. S.
THE EINSTEIN UPHEAVAL.
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTs.
THE wide-reaching results of Dr. EINSTEIN's great dis-
covery are by some unthinking observers regarded as only
affecting mathematicians and philosophers. There could
not be a greater mistake, as may be readily shown from
the following considerations. The acceptance of the theory
carries with it, as an indispensable corollary, the acceptance
of the proposition, Time = the Fourth Dimension. Once we
grant this, as we must, the literary implications of the dis-
covery are revealed in their true significance and the re-
construction of a large number of standard sayings becomes
necessary. When prose has been adopted as the vehicle
for expression, the carrying out of the change is not so
difficult; but some little skill will be required to adjust the
metre in those poetical allusions which are in constant
use.
For example: “I know a bank where the wild fourth
dimension grows,” is at the first blush somewhat dis-
concerting. But on repetition it will be found that the new
form of the phrase is a great improvement. It is more
impressive and sonorous, and it can be defended as a legi-
timate application of the principle of vers libre.
The famous and often quoted couplet from Hamlet ad-
mits of a very simple adjustment, the metre being retained
if we drop only one word and read:—
“The fourth dimension's out of joint. Oh spite,
That ever I was born to set it right !”
Here it will be conceded that the omission of the harsh
and unseemly epithet “cursèd” is a distinct gain.
More difficult to reconcile with popular predilections is
the new version of the line in WATTs's famous hymn: “The
fourth dimension, like an ever-rolling stream,” but the
task of adaptation ought not to be beyond the powers of a
great prosodist such as the present PoET LAUREATE.
We may add in conclusion that for the present there is
no intention on the part of Elord NorthcLIFFE to change
the title of his chief paper to The Fourth Dimensions.
REGIMENTAL HOCKEY.
My company team has played its first match. The
score was—but what of a few goals, more or less 2 The
play's the thing. And I'm quite sure that the seventeenth
was “kicks,” and would have been given so by the umpire,
only in his eagerness he nearly swallowed his whistle and
then didn't like to confess his clumsiness.
A few candid comments on the team, after the manner of
a school magazine, may be helpful at this early stage. Will
you print them for me, Mr. Punch 2 I asked the Adjutant
to do so, but he says that his space in Battalion Orders is
so limited that he is obliged to decline advertisements.
Here they are:–
Corporal Jenkins (goal). Maintained most admirable
sangfroid in trying circumstances. . Showed punctuality
and precision in retrieving the ball from the net. Should
not smoke cigarettes while play is in progress; hockey is
more serious than warfare and allows less licence.
Private Bulpitt (right back). A natural golfer. At the
top of his swing is reminiscent of WARDON. Must learn to
replace turf. -
Lance-Corporal Farthing (left back). A striking contrast
to his partner. Longest drive, three yards; hits, six; mis-
hits, all the rest. Should practise in his barrack-room.
Private Blagg (right half). Lacks pace but is a very
useful tripper. A thoroughly unscrupulous half-back.
Sergeant Pinkerton, D.C.M., M.M. (centre half). A mag-
nificent fighter at close quarters. Finds hockey a very
passable substitute for dirty work with the bayonet.
Private Samways (left half). Not a great player, but a
clever debater on points of hockey-law. Should avoid per-
sonalities. The umpire's character and personal record
may be all that this half-back alleges, but such a matter is
surely better discussed in the canteen after the match.
Corporal Kibney (outside right). A very agile forward
with an entertaining trick of balancing his stick on his
nose during slack moments.
Private Fribbance (inside right). Uses his stick with a
scythe-like action, but rarely reaps the ball. Sometimes
cuts down the opposing left half, but more often his own
wing-partner. Is earmarked for agricultural furlough next
haymaking.
C.-S.-M. Wagstaffe (centre forward). A keen and deter-
mined attacker. Selects the enemy's goalkeeper as his
special objective, and more than once put him into the net,
the ball having been diverted elsewhere.
Private Smith (inside left). An adaptable forward, using
either side of his stick with equal facility. Leaves no rule
unbroken.
Staff Sergeant Lovejoy (outside left). Apt to confuse hockey
with the club-swinging of which he is so fine an exponent
in the gymnasium. Could always be located in action by
the cries of human beings in pain. A dangerous forward.

“It is always a mysterious thing why
a golfer's form should vary from one
day to another, with the curious result
that on a Monday he should be unable
to do anything wrong, and on the fol-
lowing Tuesday be equally unable to
do anything right. Perhaps the form
of the Great Triumvirate is not quite
so variable as this, but certainly they
have their good years and their bad
years, and this lapse of form is as in-
explicable to the player himself as to
the looker-on. Take JAMES BRAID, for
instance, the famous Walton Heath
professional. He has had one of his
very worst seasons, and yet he will tell
you that he is feeling as fit as ever, and
that as far as he knows there is nothing
to account for this strange decline from
his usual irreproachable form.
But it is not always a question
of physical fitness. A man who has
something on his mind will never be
able to put his best into the game, and
this may well have been the trouble
with JIMMY BRAID in this last season.
As is well known, Mr. GEORGE (the
Welsh Wastrel, as I heard a well-known
performer at Sunningdale call him the
other day) has a house in the imme-
diate neighbourhood, and it is quite
possible that sub-consciously JIMMY
has been allowing this to worry him,
so that he has been throwing away
strokes with almost the same freedom
as Mr. GEORGE throws away millions
of the taxpayers' money. The im-

“The ladies looked at the photo sym-

had said, a beautiful face, and it seemed
strangely familiar to me. I puzzled
over it until, by another transition,
Georges diverted the attention of the
party to his stock of engraved shell-
cases, German helmets and cartridge
paper-knives. Then, while he was busy
effecting big sales, I slipped the photo

over which you used to
pore and which were
engraven on your heart,
Were :—
“‘DEAR OLD CHECKY,
—Having the time of
my life now. Better
game than pottering
round the barbed-wire

in my kit by mistake,
but you can keep my

picture postcards, Brummagem souve-
nirs and war notions generally. He had
an attractive menu posted up to lure the
wandering tourist, but the only place
the dishes appeared was on the menu.
Whether you ordered huttres and Veuve
Clicquot or poulet rôti and Pommard
the result was the same—omelette and
vin blanc, unless it happened to be
omelette and vin rouge. However, old
Georges contrived to entertain his vis-
itors so well with war anecdotes that
they didn't notice it, and the bill helped
to keep up the illusion that they had
lunched lavishly.
“Without doubt Georges possessed
a double helping of imagination and
dramatic power, even for a Frenchman.
I happen to know that at the com-
mencement of the War his family were,
as our Sergeant-Major used to say,
‘evaporated from the divested area' to
Rouen, where Georges, being a Terri-
torial and too old for the line, did guard
duties over prisoners and stores, and
“As I said, Georges had dramatic
power, and he was also a true artist.
He didn't pile on the horrors too much
or too long, but, for the benefit of the
ladies, switched on the sentimental
stop at just the right moment. Picking
up a photograph in a tinsel frame from
themantel-piece he regarded it tenderly.
“‘A beautiful lady,’ he murmured;
‘and her lover, he was un beau garçon.
An English Tommee, un simple soldat,
but with the face of an Apollo and the
heart of a lion. Le pauvre petit ! I re-
member him as he used to sit by my
fire gazing at this photograph. There
is writing on the back—words of love
and longing, sans doute, but I under-
stand not the English language. One
morning the orders came for the assault,
and he placed the photograph into my
hand.
“‘“Guard this for me, mom viewa!,” he
said, “until I return; it is my greatest
treasure.”
“‘Then he kissed it again and
“And the lady, my noble Apollo,
whose likeness you tenderly kissed
before going out into the battle, never
to return, was Freddy Fryer, the lady
impersonator of the Ninety-ninth
Divisional Concert Party.”
Another Impending Apology.
From a cinema advertisement:—
“THE GREAT GAME,
Featuring BoMBARDIER WELLs.
THE IRRESISTIBLE FLAPPER.”
Provincial Paper.
From a pro-Italian pamphlet:—
“All the tribes of Jugoslavia are thumping
their tum-tums and talking of war with Italy."
Well, it can't be said that they have no
stomach for the fight.
“BIG INCREASE IN BIGAMoUs MARRIAGE

Despite a few regrettable incidents we
feel sure this is a libel on the Dominion.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LETTER TO THE BACK BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,-
As you will note by this here letter heading
I am at present in the town of Reading.
How's that for a nifty little bit of
impromptu verse? How do I do it?
Oh, I dunno. A gift, I suppose. And
why am I in Reading 2 Taking a course
of biscuits 2 Visiting its Earl 2 Nay,
nay, old companion, neither. I am here
because—oh, well, I'll tell you all about
it, since you insist.
I wrote to you that our old Bagshawe
was in deep waters, didn't I? Well,
it is all over; he has joined the great
majority, and I, as his Best Man, was
with him to the bitter end. Of course
I'm pretty hardened to that sort of thing
now—after my varied experience—but
for all that it never fails to move me
deeply. The poor chaps cling to me so
pathetically; call up memories of the
past; choke . . Baggy was par-
ticularly temperamental; without ex-
ception the most ticklish bridegroom I
have ever handled.
A case of mine in Saskatchewan gave
me the slip just as the bride weighed
in. I discovered him some time later
in the town corral, engaged in a horse
deal. Nor could I move the fellow
until the whole auction—horse included
—had been transferred to the church-
yard, where he could watch proceedings
through the window and punctuate his
responses with occasional bids.
Another case of mine—in Bechuana-
land this time—reclined on the sharp
end of a scorpion two minutes before
the saddling-bell rang for the nuptials.
He arrived at the post on time, but in
my arms, and went through the cere-
mony bent double, and doing a sort of
Maori war-dance. Only my firm grip
on his braces kept him in court at all.
I have had them feign loss of memory
and catalepsy at the last moment, con-
fess to arson, bigamy and murder; but
by the exercise of tact and firmness I
have nursed them all through. I pride
myself on it. But Baggy . . . I go
all goosey when I think of it, even
now, even here—in Reading.
It wasn't that he was reluctant; it
was his nerves. You know how con-
foundedly jumpy he was in the old
days up at Shangani—well, the late
European friction has done nothing
towards mending matters. He was
never actually punctured, but he was
the champion shock-absorber of the
home front. Did a bomb drop any-
where between Yarmouth and Brixton,
Baggy was sure to be standing with
his ear to the bang. The result was
pitiable. Six months after the Armis-
tice the drone of a cockchafer overhead
would set him burrowing like a badger,
and did an infant pop its paper-bag
within ten yards of him he would fling
himself in the gutter and moan for an
ambulance.
I knew all about this and was pre-
pared for some slight flutterings at the
chancel steps, but I had no suspicion
of the twist proceedings would take.
Else you would never have caught me
within a thousand miles of oh, well,
we will come to that.
I descended on Cheltenham the day
before, and found Baggy installed in
a hotel there, looking pale but deter-
mined. I took him for a scramble up
Leckhampton Hill in the evening (I
am a firm believer in exercise, it keeps
'em from going off their feed and brood-
ing), and he got the usual last will and
testament off his chest. He is be-
queathing you his collection of Somali
nose-rings, and Knox what he is pleased
to call his library, but which, as far as
I can ascertain, consists of a single
bound volume of La Vie Parisiemme.
He spoke affectionately of the old up-
country days. Of course he was making
a change for the better and was the
happiest man on earth, but still they
had been rather jolly, hadn't they 2 He
sighed several times to show how happy
he was. I kept him locked in his room
next morning while I went to the church
to see if all was in order and the drop
working properly. At eleven o'clock
I dressed and fed him. He partook of
a hearty breakfast and walked to the
scaffold with a firm step, refusing all
spirituous consolation. -
It has been my experience that most
brides are deliberately late. Prompti-
tude, they imagine, would give the
public the idea that they are mad keen
to get at the man; they therefore hang
back twenty minutes or so to show
that they don't really care a whoop
either way, and are only being dragged
into the affair against their better judg-
ment. If they only knew what this
delay sometimes costs the conscientious
best man | Why, once in the Cape
Province I was riding a bucking bride-
groom's chest for thirty-eight minutes,
| pounding him on the head with a
hassock to keep him quiet.
Some amateurs trot their men into
the arena right away, and keep them
hanging miserably about until the bride
chooses to materialise — old women
commenting audibly on their paleness,
the pluck leaking out of the toes of
their patent leathers. Not I; I entertain
the condemned in the vestry with light,
bright blither until a verger tips me
off that the lady is rounding the bend.
Then I administer a stiff bracer of
jumping powder from my flask, whip
off his rugs (so to speak) and he pig-
jumps up to the starting gate with all
the bloom on. This creates a favour-
able impression.
Baggy responded creditably to treat-
ment. He toed the scratch line ten
seconds ahead of the bride with his
ears cocked and his crest high.
Everything went swimmingly until
we approached the “Wilt thous,” when
some silly ass let the door slam. Baggy,
true to form, dived for the mat like a
retiring White Hope. I grabbed him
by the scruff just in time and jerked
him to his feet. The padre (an archaic
half deaf and blind relative of the bride)
came to the end of his mumble and
paused for Baggy's response. Baggy
was incapable of utterance. I shook him
heartily, but only produced a castanet
solo of teeth. There was nothing else
for it, so I rendered the “I will” my-
self. I had not got Baggy round by
the time the “To have and to hold”
repetition was due, so I repeated that
for him as well. I handed him the
ring. He dropped it. I caught it in
mid-air and handed it back to him.
He proceeded to screwitnut-wise on the
wretched girl's left thumb. I stepped
between the pair, frustrated Baggy and
steered it on her fourth finger myself.
The clerical dotard suddenly leaned
forward and, capturing both our hands,
instructed me—me—to repeat, “With
this ring, etc.,” after him.
“No, no, no; I'm the best man,” I
whispered feverishly, “the BEST MAN,
don't you understand? That's the
chap you want, over there,” nodding at
Baggy, who was wobbling slowly to a
flank, gone dithery altogether.
The old fool blinked stupidly and
plunged straight ahead with the blessing.
My goodness, Ginger, do you per-
ceive what was happening to me?" In
half a jiffy he would have finished the
blessing and I should be married. Iſ
Me! Ich / Je / What a situation for
an innocent young follow to find him-
self in all of a sudden. What a situa-
tion, Ginger, I ask you! I am a brave
man, Ginger, but I confess there have
been moments when even I have turned
my back on extreme peril. This was
one of them. I turned my back on it,
clave through the bevy of swooning
bridesmaids like a wild pig through a
cane brake, bowled over a couple of
vergers who were loitering up the aisle
bidding the small boys be quiet, took
the font in my stride and was out of
the door and down the street, running
like a dog with a can tied to its tail.
The gates of the railway station yawned
before me. I dashed through them
into a moving train and burrowed under
the seat. The train brought me to
Reading, and here I am still—still
panting slightly. - - *
Ever thy PATLANDER.

MUSIC IN THE MELTING-POT.
INTERESTING NEw DEvelopMENts.
NoTHING is more reassuring in the
present condition of the musical world
than the sudden reaction against that
exotic Orientalism from which some of
our leading composers suffered more
or less acutely before the War. Per-
haps the most notorious instance was
that of Mr. de Banville Quantock,
who, it was alleged, when under the
influence of the divine afflatus, used to
array himself in a Malayan sarong,
Afghan sandals and a Chinese Man-
darin's jacket.
But this is now ancient history. To-
day there is no stauncher hierophant
of the Gaelic revival than Mr. Quan-
tock. He tosses the caber daily. His
Highland costume is a miracle of cor-
rectness, and his last work, the massive
symphonic poem, entitled “Inchna-
damph,” is marked by the true Ossianic
flavour. As The Times' musical critic
remarks in his inspired comment on
the concluding pages of this momentous
work: “At the culminating moment
(marked “Glenlivet' in the margin of
the score) the principal or “Drumna-
drochit' theme has so burnt itself into
the composer's imagination that he can-
not bear to be parted from it long, but
tightens the rhythm with a new figure
of drooping paired quavers; the melodic
contours, which so strangely suggest
the quartzite summit of Suilven, become
more precipitous, and the Great Idea
at last evaporates in an iridescent
ecstasy of whirling arpeggios.”
:k -k :::
But this, happily, is no isolated ex-
ample of protest and fruitful reaction.
We have also to welcome the “Celtic
|Twilight Recitals,” which Miss Deirdre
O'Shanachie is giving at the Dale-
carlian Hall. It is impossible in cold
print to convey the hypnotic charm of
Miss O'Shanachie's crooning of the
masterpieces of palaeolithic Milesian
minstrelsy. The effect is immensely
enhanced by the assistance of her
brother, Mr. Dermot O'Shanachie, who
accompanies her on the Connacht
“bosthoon,” an instrument which The
Times' critic has happily described as
a sort of prehistoric oboe. The lights
are turned down throughout the per-
formance, and the effect is wonderfully
restful. Indeed, striking testimony has
been paid to the salubrious, sedative
and even eupeptic influence of these re-
citals by such high authorities as Dr.
Scrutton Block and Sir Castor Doyle.
:k :: :*
In this context it would not be right
to overlook the success achieved at the
Praetorian by the Sisters Dinwiddie,
from the Isle of Arran, in their Old Red
Sandstone Songs, comprising a rich
selection from the Middle Oolite selies,
together with many fine specimens of
Jurassic folk-tunes still current in the
neighbourhood of Loch Ranza. At
Hendon, Iolo Morgan and his sister
Blodwen have been drawing crowded
audiences to their “cantillations" of
Panceltic ballads to the accompaniment
of the motor harp; and lastly we may
mention the visit of Madame Trelawny
Chuff with her famous Cornish Riviera
Band. Our native musicians are now
sustained by a single emotional impulse,
multiform in its expression but constant
in its aim. Altogether the national
musical outlook is extremely hopeful.

him down. He showed equal

incautiously inquired what this

people have been found sleeping
in churches.
Mr. McCURDY rightly declined
to accept Lieutenant-Commander
KENworthy's suggestion that the
Food Department should send its
surplus bacon to the distressed
districts of Europe. He sees no
reason for adding to their miseries.
After the Industrial Courts Bill
had passed its Third Reading the
House plunged, for the third time
in a fortnight, into the Russian
bog. With the exception of Colonel
WARD, who again maintained that
we were bound in honour to carry
out our undertakings to Admiral
Koi..TCHAK, no one had a clear
policy to put forward. All con-
demned the Bolshevist atrocities
in tones varying from the tenore
robusto of Lord Robert CECIL to
the mild falsetto of Mr. ARTHUR
HENDERSON; but hardly anybody
thought it Britain's business to
spend more blood and treasure in
putting them down; and the only
point on which there was general
agreement was that there ought

to be no more “vacillation." It is not clear-cut statement of policy in regard
surprising that the PRIME MINISTER to Egypt. While desiring in every
possible way to associate the Egyp-
tian native population with the Gov-
ernment, neither in Egypt nor in
the Soudan is England going
to give up her responsibilities.
“British supremacy exists; Brit-
ish supremacy is going to be main-
tained.” So that's that.
Tuesday, November 18th.-Loud
i cheers greeted Mr. G. Roberts's
announcement, in reply to a
request for the release of more
spirits “for medicinal and other
purposes,” that all restrictions on
clearance are to be removed forth-
with. It should, of course, be
clearly understood that the Com-
mons are only interested in the
matter from a purely medical
# point of view, and that the recon-
# ditioning of the famous WALENTIA
Wat is to them a matter of in-
difference.
; In New York the pound ster-
ling is now worth only four dollars
seven cents. The news that the
British sovereign, once the big gun
of the financial world, has shrunk
into a mere 4:07 had sent the CHAN-
CELLoſt of THE ExchEQUER to his
bed, and it was left to Mr. BALD-
wiN to convey the melancholy tidings.

After these hesitancies it was re-
freshing to hear from Mr. BALFour a |examples of distinguished aliens–from

who have made England what she
is. Descending from the sublime to
the domestic he asserted that the
trade in modern bedroom furniture
was entirely created by one of these
immigrants. So it seems that it
was due not to Lord FISHER, but
to an alien, that we were able “to
sleep quietly in our beds.”
Wednesday, November 19th.-
The Lord CHANCELLOR was almost
apologetic in his recommendation
of a Bill to enable County Court
Judges to retire on a pension at the
age of seventy-two, and admitted
that one of his predecessors on the
Woolsack had administered sound
justice when well over ninety. But
HALSBURYs are not to be found on
every Bench, and, though Lord
HALDANE was of opinion that
judges, like port wine, took a long
time to mature, and often reached
their prime after they had passed
the Psalmist's span, the House
generally agreed that it was better
to run the risk of parting with one
of these fine old crusted veterans
than to allow others to lag super-
fluous on the Bench long after
MR. ROBERTS DECLARES THE FOUNTAIN
OPEN.

they had mislaid their strength and
bouquet.
A noble Member of the Government
recently stated his opinion that answers
to Parliamentary Questions were not
to be taken seriously. Too much
attention must not be paid, therefore,
to Mr. CHURCHILL's assertion that he
had heard of no discontent among the
temporary officers of the R.A.M.C. in
India. If that be the fact it shows
either that the WAR MINISTER must be
conveniently deaf, or that these gentle-
men, who were torn from their posi-
tions and sent abroad during the War,
and are now, a year after the Armistice,
compelled to serve in a trying climate,
must be curiously inaudible.
A year ago the Admiralty had a
thousand vessels on order for the Fleet.
Six hundred of them have been
countermanded, which is just as
well perhaps, seeing that the one
battleship since completed, the
Hood, is to cost the country a
cool six millions.
Who says that the Govern-
ment has no regard for self-deter-
mination ? Constitutions for In-
dia, Egypt and Ireland are on the
way, and now the Maltese are to
be given control of their own ad-
ministration. As, however, the

Three weeks ago the House
was urging the Government to
take the most drastic steps to-
wards economy. This afternoon
Member after Member rose to con-
demn the proposal to limit the unem-
ployment dole to ex-members of the
Services. Mr. CLYNEs moved to reduce
the vote by one hundred pounds,
the accepted Parliamentary method of
demanding an increase, and was sup-
ported by Sir Edward CARson, who
declared that “hard cases made bad
blood,” and described the dole as “an
insurance against revolution.” Mr.
MACQUISTEN deplored its demoralizing
effect upon domestic servants, who
would as soon go into a house with
leopards (varia lectio “lepers”) as with
children; and Lord HUGH CECIL and
Mr. RENwick courageously defended
the Government. But the chorus of
opposition from all quarters was so
powerful that Mr. BonAR LAw, smelling
a possible defeat, took the Whips off.
As it turned out, however, the House
had more courage than its Leader, and
by a majority of ninety-four defeated
the Amendment.
Thursday, November 20th. — The
second of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's pleasant
Thursday afternoons did not quite come
up to anticipations. Members had pre-
pared fifty-seven conundrums for him,
and it was confidently expected that
after “ No. 25” was called the rest of
Question-time would resolve itself into
a repetition of ATHANASIUs contra mun-
dum. But, as usual in the House of
Commons, the unexpected happened.
The proceedings were about as lively
as a Quaker meeting. Athanasius
delegated half his questions to oblig-
ing colleagues, and delivered such slick
answers to the others that the “Supple-
mentary" merchants were left with
most of their goods on hand. To Major
O'NEILL, who inquired how long the
PRIME MINISTER proposed to continue

WEDGWOOD BENN.
his Thursday attendances, he graci-
ously replied, “As long as it meets the
general convenience of the House,” and
Members cheered dutifully but not en-
thusiastically. For, to tell the truth, he
had so successfully curbed his natural vi-
vacity as to be almost dull, which shows
once more what a clever man he is.
On the Electricity (Supply) Bill the
HoME SECRETARY moved a new clause,
transferring to the Ministry of Trans-
port all the powers of the Board of Trade
in regard to electricity, on the ground
that the new Department possessed
“driving force and energy.” Far from
resenting the implied imputation Sir
AUCKLAND GEDDEs warmly supported
the transfer. He had the utmost con-
fidence in the MINISTER of TRANSPORT.
But this exhibition of brotherly affec-
tion did not remove the apprehen-
sions of some Members, who thought
that, in roads, railways and canals. the
new Minister had already a sufficient
field for his energies.
A CHAMPION BACK-NUMBER.
ANYONE with a keen ear, leaning
against the silversmith's window in the
small hours, might have heard the dis-
cussion, for now and then it became
quite shrill.
And no wonder, for silver ornaments
want very little sleep and the nights
are long—from six or seven till nine or
ten, with nothing to do and, which is
worse, nothing to see. During the day-
time there is always something hap-
pening, something to look at : the
people passing in the street; the people
who stop and examine the things in
the window and little think how they
are being examined in their turn, and
what a scrutinising glance a snuff-box
or a vinaigrette can give; the people
who come into the shop. And
then there is the fun of speculat-
ing as to what they will buy and
whether they will buy at all; and
the terrible excitement of being
picked up and appraised, not
knowing whether one is to be
bought and carried away to a
new home or put back in the win-
dow to be humiliated before the
other articles there.
All this makes the day interest-
ing; but nights are dull, and it is
not surprising then that a good
deal of time goes in disputation.
On this particular night of the
shrill debate the argument con-
cerned the rival claims to distinc-
tion of a number of the speakers.
Each wished to prove that he or
she was the most remarkable or
had led the most necessary exist-
ence. One hears something of the
same kind in human conversation
now and then, but the conceit of silver
articles can beat anything, and on
this occasion it had been vociferous.
Everyone demanded to be heard and
everyone shouted down the others.
The snuff-boxes, the patch-boxes, the
pounce - boxes, the baby's coral with
silver-bells, the spoons, the salt-cellars
—all urged their claims. There was only
one silent individual on the whole shelf.
“Well,” finally said a Queen Anne
skewer with a ducal crest engraved on
it, who had acted as a kind of M.C.
ever since he had joined the silver-
smith's stock, “we seem to have heard
everyone now, except our little modern
friend in the corner.”
“Yes, why doesn't our little friend
speak up?” said a George the Third
snuff-box. “Has he no pride what-
ever? Is there no quality on which
he can plume himself?”
“Most certainly there is,” said the
article in question—a plump little crea-
ture rather like a chubby watch.

And smitest wildly when I come
To settle on my heart's desire,

Blest member of the biped race,
In sock and slipper warmly shod,
Bethink thee in what evil case
Chill Autumn finds the hexapod.
If on the fender's shiny knob
I fain would find a gentle heat,
Too soon I feel a scorching throb
Pervade my tender vacuous feet.
And if to ease the smart I turn
And squat me on the window-pane
I find that cold no less can burn,
So spread my weary wings again.
No warmth is in the painted door,
And all too rough the papered wall,
And if I light upon the floor
The carpet tickles worse than all.
Though once too often I defy
Thy lifted hand and meet my fate,
I know no fairer place to die
Than on thy comfortable pate.
And when this world is left behind,
What shall come after? There's the
rub.
My own hope is that I shall find
Nirvana in Beelzebub.

THE STRONG MAN REVEALED.
THE Actor-Manager leaned back and
closed his eyes.
“All right,” he said wearily; “give
me the plot in as few words as possible.
But I warn you that, unless it breaks
absolutely new ground, it's a wash-out
so far as I am concerned.”
“It does break new ground,” said
the Author eagerly. “Or it breaks old
ground in a new way, which is the
same thing.”
“Not a bit,” murmured the Actor-
Manager, still with his eyes shut.
“You shall judge,” said the Author.
“John Granite is a strong man . . .”
The Actor-Manager groaned.
“. . . but his wife, Nina, fails to realise
this. She is frivolous—no real harm,
you understand, but frivolous — and
John's patience and gentleness she
merely mistakes for weakness.”
The Actor-Manager opened his eyes.
“Have you ever been to a theatre at
all?” he asked. “Or read any play ?
Did you see me in The Lion and the
Butterfly 2 Did you see me in As Tem-
pered Steel ? &: in Give Her Her
Head 2 Or in a score of others?”
The Author held up a deprecating
hand.
“You were a miracle of patience in
all those plays,” he said. “Please be
patient now and hear me out. By the
Third Act Nina has quite decided that
John is too weak to be worth bothering
about, and that he cares for nothing but
his work. On the other hand, Nigel . . .”
“He would be Nigel.”

she thinks that he is strong. She is
quite wrong, of course; he is weak as
water. But Nina in the matter of
strength and weakness is singularly un-
observant. Then comes the big scene.”
The Actor-Manager appeared to be
fast asleep, and the Author repeated
himself. “Then comes the big scene.
Nigel is clasping Nina in his arms when
John enters. With his invariable good
taste John pretends not to see them,
but turns to the mirror ostensibly to
put his tie straight. But the look on
his face is so extraordinarily strong that

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“WHY, oh why will you not always be wholly serious?”
This plea, once put by Mr. MAX BEERBoHM into the lips of
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, has an odd sound to-day, when she
herself threatens to become one of the most vivacious (and
popular) of our story-tellers. Of the novels in her new manner
I certainly think none has been more attractive than the
latest, Cousin Philip (CoLLINs). The initial situation is
admirable. A middle-aging gentleman of quiet late-Vic-
torian habits finds himself forced to play guardian and
host to a lovely, exquisite, and wildly high-spirited girl of
nineteen, about whom he has promised her dead mother to
“see that she has her chance.” The first half of the book,
which deals with the resulting ferments and more especially
the inevitable clash between pre- and post-war ideals of
conduct, is capitally handled. From my saying “post-war”
you will gather that the tale is sufficiently modern; indeed,
it even embraces the pyrotechnics of Peace-Day. And as
the embodiment of this modernity, cool, brilliant, wholly
self-sufficient, the girl Helena is among the most striking
portraits in all Mrs. WARD's collection of whatever period.
I am not going to say that the second half of the story,
with its hint of Jane Eyre melodrama, is equal to the grace
of the opening; but taken all round the tale marks a con-
siderable advance upon anything that the rather facile art
of Mrs. WARD THE SEconD has yet given us. It encourages
me to hope that in time she may come full circle and meet
her predecessor in a masterpiece of Victorian dignity blent
with Georgian verve.
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON would not live in Dublin for all
the money in the world. Still less would he live in Kerry
or Connaught or Belfast or Londonderry. He does not
say so, of course, in Irish Impressions (CoLLINs); it is one
of those obvious things that are not susceptible of proof.
That being the case it is only right that his impressions
should represent an agreeable tribute to Irish hospitality
rather than a detached survey of Irish affairs. Not that
detachment is very easy where Ireland is concerned, for it
is a land where only the jester can either speak his mind or
change it without being assaulted (figuratively, of course)
by many adversaries. There is no more convincing jester
than Mr. CHESTERTON when he chooses, but in Irish Im-
pressions he has not chosen. He has tried hard to see eye
to eye with his Dublin friends—the twin solar systems of
Irish literature-cum-politics that revolve about Messrs.
W. B. YEATs and GEORGE RUSSELL respectively—and to
explain that in each case they have come to the right con-
clusion for the wrong reason or have advanced the right
reasons but drawn the wrong conclusions. That is the
CHESTERTON stock-in-trade. The CHESTERTON imagination,
that wonderful creator of Father Brown and The Napoleon
of Notting Hill, is here allowed no scope. Irish Impressions,
in a word, is not even CHESTERTON at his second-best as
literature. That it could have been a serious contribution
to the literature of the Irish Question was not, in the cir-
cumstances in which the impressions were gathered, to
be expected.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DoRFF's My War Memories (HUTCHINson) is a political book
by an exceptionally able man, who has about as much sense
of the complex interplay of politics as a bright schoolboy.
If it were designed as an apologia addressed to the outsider,
it could be set down unhesitatingly as a profoundly stupid
book. But it is, of course, rather a defence of the German
Army Command against the timid blockheads at Berlin,
who never understood what war was and betrayed their
country by abandoning a military simplicity of outlook and
refusing to shoot out of hand anybody who introduced
irrelevant conceptions, such as human justice or freedom.
He can never forgive BETHMANN-Hollweg for giving the
game away. With a persistence that cannot but win
admiration for its superb effrontery, he represents Germany
as the peaceful lamb faced by a world of cruel shearers
taken one at a time, and administered in that fashion I
should like to prescribe them for the people who regard such
books as a publisher's attempt to deceive.
One small drawback to Mr. RALPH NEvill's Life and
Letters of Lady Dorothy Nevill (METHUEN) is the impres-
sion it conveys of having been gleaned in a well-reaped
field. But what a treasure-field it is Though, thrice
unfortunately, Lady Dorothy herself held only the pen of
a not specially ready writer, all the great epistolaries of her
. were her close friends, and delighted to pour out
efore her their best. Of herself, quite one of the most
popular and conspicuous personalities of an age that is
partly present, partly past, who knows not the main facts
to-day? Shrewd, sympathetic, rather more than tolerant,
(and as part of that lamb he
incidentally does a good deal
of bleating). Of the deport-
ations he says, in answer to
the protest of certain duly-
despised fellow-countrymen:
“The military authorities were
acting from patriotic duty, and
not arbitrarily.” One could
feel some sympathy with a
beaten man who so ably and
indeed so heroically bore his
dreadful burden of responsi-
bility if there were ever any-
where in this book any tribute
to the valour of the opposing
troops or leaders, with the
perfunctory exception of the
Grand Duke NICHOLAs. He
has, indeed, something to say
of the unbroken spirit of the
Dictators, LLOYD GEORGE and
CLEMENCEAU, but this is only
by way of demonstrating the
poor spirit of all the Germany
that was not the army. The -
one thing that the elaborate
artifice of this uncandid and
unconsciously humorous book
is unable to conceal is that
LUDENDoRFF's inability to see
the situation except through
Prussian - blue spectacles
launched him upon his final
gamble with his countrymen's

some time to come.
THE
WHY, You've PUT FIVE
The death of Mr. J. E.
PATTERson, in the Spring of
this year, has deprived the
lives and destiny in the campaign of 1918. One wonders
of what stuff he must be to survive the débâcle.
I am not at all sure that All Sorts (MILLs AND Boon) is a
very apt title for the volume containing nine short stories
by Miss I. A. R. WYLIE. Superficially they are at least
of several sorts. There are two Russian peasant tragedies
as a beginning, then six English stories, ranging from grave
to gay (one of them, “The Episcopal Scherzo,” a capital
comedy), and, lastly, a sorrowful tale set in a French town
during the German occupation. But in quality these stories
are more alike than they are, in setting or subject, diverse.
There is the same good workmanship in all, not an inch of
scamped imagination, not a moment when Miss WYLIE is
not in touch with the man or woman through whose eyes
she is looking. She knows to a nicety where to begin and
where to end, and one or two of her stories deserve even more
praise than this. Probably, as is the case with most
collections of short stories. the v will make their best effect
world of letters of a writer whose real knowledge of a
certain kind of life and disdain of any literary artifice
drew and held the attention. As Mr. C. E. LAWRENCE,
who passed the proofs of The Passage of the Barque
Sappho (DENT) for the press, says in a foreword, “It is
good that this, the latest, if not the last of his tale of
novels should be a sea-story, penned with the joy of the
telling that was part of the man.” Fully to enjoy this
chronicle of a voyage from San Francisco to London you
must have in you the love of ships and of all that pertains
to them. It was a long voyage and Mr. PATTERSON has
described it at considerable length, but he has escaped
monotony by weaving a web of mystery about his story.
Yet at the same time the characters drawn by him are
patently true to life. I have frequently read the statement

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
IN PRAISE OF COMMON PLACE.
To A MIDDLE-AGED PoET FROM ANOTHER.
[Mr. JoHN BAILEY, lecturing before the British Academy on
“Poetry and Commonplace,” is reported to have said that poetry
“could not have too much of the truths of universal application.”
The great poets, from HoMER to GRAY and WoRDsworth, were “at
least as much occupied in giving new life to old things as in dis-
covering new.” Contemporary poets, on the other hand, were apt to
lack universality.]
WHEN Youth observes with pitying smile
Our progress toward the sere and yellow,
Or in a less corrosive style
Remarks that we are turning mellow—
For blood that lacks its former glow,
For joints that creak and bloom that's rusted,
Solace it is at least to know
The worth of ancient wines and crusted.
'Tis true that we do not indulge
In the vers-librist's easy latitude,
But our Victorian bosoms bulge
For joy of any deathless platitude;
We love the clichés learnt in youth,
Which grow with years more fine and fruity,
E.g. that Beauty = Truth,
That Truth is tantamount to Beauty.
Age cannot spoil their potent spells
Nor custom stale our simple piety
Who drink from these established wells
And never, never know satiety;
Why hustle after something strange
When we can read in old HoRATIUS
Such truths as these—that seasons change,
That Life is short and Time fugacious 2
Our Georgians seek a modern quest,
But when they get as old as I am
They'll know the tritest truths are best
(See VIRGIL, DANTE, HoMER, KHAYYAM);
Try as he will, no man can hope,
Save on a universal basis,
To match the cosmic GRAY, or cope
With WoRDsworth's hoary commonplaces.
There's nothing new this time of day.
No bard should blush to be a debtor
To those who had the earlier say,
So long as he can do it better;
The form's the thing; to poets dead
And crowned in heaven we give the credit
Not half so much for what they said
As for the jolly way they said it. O. S.
FAT AND THIN MEN IN GOLF.
BY W. W. WILTON.
(Being the 5,000th article on the Royal and Ancient Game
written by this famous expert).
THAT a certain amount of adipose tissue is an extremely
useful asset is undeniable. But it must be correctly dis-
tributed in order to conduce to efficiency at the game. It
is not essential that a golfer should be fashioned like a
statue by PHEIDIAs, but he must be so fashioned that the
development of energy is not hampered by his physical con-
tours. To put it crudely, a man whose waist measurement
exceeds that of his chest by more than fifteen inches is not
likely to be a long driver. I have only known one golfer
with a plus handicap who weighed more than eighteen
stone. On the other hand, massive solidity of build is
a decided advantage in a high wind. SANDY MACLURKIN,
one of the best Scotch players in the eighties, was a man of
singularly fragile physique, and attributed his success in
one championship meeting, which was played at Prestwick
in a heavy gale, to his having filled the pockets of his trousers
with lead.
Dogmatism should always be avoided, but it may be
laid down as a general rule that a golfer who wishes to do
himself full justice should not allow his weight to exceed
thirteen stone. The good golfer should be well nourished,
but a too generous diet is to be deprecated. More matches
have been lost by heavy than by frugal lunches. But loss
of appetite in a championship meeting is a bad sign.
DoNALD MACINTYRE always attributed his defeat in the
final at St. Andrew's in 1891 to a third helping of boiled
beef and suet dumplings at lunch before the concluding
round, in which he started with a mine at the first hole.
Per contra, Mr. HECToR DUFF, who was the favourite for the
amateur championship in 1897, was knocked out in the
semi-finals after a breakfast at which he only ate one
boiled egg.
Some amateurs of a neurotic temperament are in the
habit of steadying their nerves with aspirin before an im-
portant match. Others I know who prefer ammoniated
quinine or sloe gin. I cannot help thinking that a series
of tests, if carried out under the supervision of hygienic
experts, might be of great importance in establishing a
standard diet for golfers and settling once and for all the
vexed question of the value of stimulants and sedatives.
The question of nerves is all-important; and here the stout
man generally scores. Stout men as a rule—though there
are, of course, exceptions — are genial, easy-going and
imperturbable. They do not brood over defeat. The lean,
slim, delicate man is seldom a good loser. He may be
endowed with an artistic temperament—few great artists
have been abnormally rotund—but that is an attribute
which is out of place in the golfer.
This reflection prompts me to observe that golfers should
be extremely careful in their choice of reading when an im-
portant match or meeting is in prospect. A clever friend
of mine, to whom I cannot give more than three or four
strokes when he is on his game, broke down badly in a club
match last week, and confessed to me afterwards that it
was entirely owing to his preoccupation with Dr. EIN-
STEIN's theory of space. To speak frankly, I do not think
that serious golfers should read the newspapers at the
present time, always excepting the articles on golf.
The influence of stoutness and slimness of figure on the
style and efficiency of golfers as writers is a most fascinat-
ing subject, but cannot be adequately dealt with in a con-
cluding paragraph. I hope to return to it in a year or two.
Meanwhile, in response to many requests, I propose to dis-
cuss next week the intensely interesting problem of pre-
mature baldness in amateur golfers and its bearing on their
iron play. It may clear the ground a little if I state here, with
all the emphasis I can command, that no golfer can aspire
to championship honours who wears a wig on the green.
Our New Masters—and Misters.
“Last evening the nomination of a Government candidate to
support the policy of Lloyd George and Bonar Law was definitely
settled. . . . Speaking at Mr. Myers's meeting [Labour], Mr. Jack

A DULL MORNING.
(Being the experience of a Member of
the British Army now in France.)
Elfred Fry paced the sands with the
dejected mien of a demobilised Bol-
shevist who has been offered work at a
steam laundry. “What a 'ole!” he said,
kicking viciously at a little green crab.
“What a 'owling cavity | What a blink-
ing excavation 1"
At his best Elfred had the chastened
gaiety of a sciatic centipede; at his
worst he regarded the world with the
abysmal gloom of a pavement artist
during a thunderstorm. On the present
occasion his mood, embittered by tem-
porary poverty, was furtherexasperated
by his surroundings.
“Sand, sand,” said he ; “more sand
an' water. Four years 'ave I delved
in it, lived in it an' packed it away in
sandbags, an' now I'm supposed to be
injoying it. What a blighted crater!"
He walked moodily along the beach,
finding an additional grievance in its
colour, which too much resembled khaki
for his taste. A distant vista of red-
roofed villas at Ambleteuse and Audres-
selles and the grey-green headland of
Cape Gris-Nez gave agreeable variety
to the scene, but brought no comfort to
Elfred. Picturesque views were not,
to his mind, an effective substitute for
beer.
Few people were about, but as El-
fred clambered round a little rocky
headland he suddenly saw a man
climbing rapidly down the face of the
cliff. So precipitate and hurried was
the man's descent that in the last few
yards he lost his footing altogether and
fell headlong on to the soft sand. Before
he could pick himself up another man,
wearing a reefer-suit and a red kerchief,
rushed to him, not to render assistance,
but apparently to squeeze out what
little breath remained in his body. El-
fred noticed that the cliff-climber had
a little black bag slung round his neck,
which the red-cravated ruffian was try-
ing to get possession of and which the
other man was equally bent on retaining.
They rolled over and over in a fierce
struggle, first one and then another
holding the advantage, and none of
the few spectators who had assembled
showed any disposition to interfere. At
last Red Cravat got his man down, and,
with his fingers on his throat, tried to
strangle him into unconsciousness; but
just as he appeared likely to succeed
in his dastardly endeavour a woman
glided from the crowd, swung a weighted
stick in both her hands and crashed it
down on his unprotected head. No
warning cry, no murmured sob of horror
came from the crowd. Elfred simply
yawned and walked on. The daily
activities of the Société Grand Guignol
de Cinéma had lost their interest for
him.
The hum of an aeroplane engine
smote his ear, and he whisked his hand
as though to still the buzzing of an
importunate fly. It was the great
London-Paris Aerobus doing its diurnal
journey, but its passing evoked no
enthusiasm in Elfred. He knew it
was timed to pass at twelve o'clock,
an acute reminder that the wet canteen
opened at the same hour.
All at once his eyes lit up with a gleam
of interest. He had noticed a round
iron object rocking in the waves near
the shore—something that promised
excitement. Hastily colleeting a supply

of boulders he ran down to within
twenty yards of the object of his atten-
tion and threw a sighting shot. It went
about a yard too far, but he bracketed
with the next and secured a direct hit
with the third. The stone clanked on
the iron and ricochetted into the sea,
but nothing further happened. Un-
daunted, Elfred kept up rapid fire,
making good practice and getting a fair
percentage of hits. The clanking of
stone on iron sounded like war-time
industry at a foundry, but it was evi-
dent #. found something lacking.
At last he desisted in disgust.
“It's only an old buoy, after all,”
he said dispiritedly. “I thought it was
a mine floated ashore wot 'ud make
some fireworks.”
On the coast hereabouts stands an
old ruined fort. Probably Napoleon
built it, or demolished it, or elaborated
his scheme of invasion from it. At
low tide it stands at the extreme end
of a rocky peninsula, but high tide
converts it into an island. So rapidly
does the tide sweep over the low-lying
neck that unwary visitors are constantly
being cut off and forced to remain on
the fort for about six hours, or, when
a boat is available, are held to ransom
and piratically rescued. Elfred himself,
in the course of winkle - hunting ex-
peditions, had more than once been
marooned at this spot.
He noticed now in passing that the
tide was rapidly coming in, and that
an English soldier on the fort was in
danger of being cut off. In his present
misanthropic frame of mind he was
inclined to gloat on the misfortune of
someone else, till it occurred to him that
a rescue might be productive of solid,
or liquid, tokens of gratitude. Therefore
he cautiously proceeded along the
narrow neck, hailing loudly the while.
The soldier had disappeared behind
a corner of the fort, and Elfred had to
pick his way right to the extremity of
the point. He paused there for a mo-
ment to rehearse a dramatic entrance,
and then rushed forward.
“’Urry, 'urry!” he shouted in well-
simulated agitation. “The tide's
sweepin' in like a mill-race' "
“What abaht it 2" asked the soldier,
busying himself with a basket.
“Well, we'll be cut off in a minute,”
replied Elfred, trying to keep up excite-
ment at white heat. “I've come to
rescue yer'''
“Look 'ere, mate,” said the other;
“I've come 'ere for a few hours' quiet
fishin', an' if you comes shouting abaht
an' disturbing me it'll be you as wants
reseuing.”
Elfred was dashed. He looked back
at the incoming waters, now a foot deep
in places, and the stones, slippery with

“What have you got to eat?” he
asked suddenly.
“Bully an' biscuits.”

“Water,” said the soldier fiercely.
There was no help for it; Elfred had
to flounder dejectedly over the boulders,
and just got ashore before wading
became an impossibility. -

and squeezing the water from his

NOTICE IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY MANNER.
THE CHARITY THAT BEGINS AT HOME.
To-DAY, nearly a whole month before
Christmas, I overcame the Ethelred
spirit which urged me to procrastinate,
and, walking firmly into a toyshop, I
succeeded in purchasing the very thing
I had in mind for my little god-child
Wilfred—a working model of a howitzer.
They also sold me a young sculptor's
modelling outfit.
When I came to untie the parcels at
home I decided that I would give the
modelling toy to the Christmas Mission.
It would find its way into some deserv-
ing home and afford an aged couple
many hours of innocent amusement,
whereas in the hands of my god-son
it might prove to be an instrument of
misfortune by arousing in him aspira-
tions to become a sculptor. The streets
of London have suffered enough already.
As some time must necessarily elapse
before the Christmas presentation, I
took the toys out of their boxes with
the idea of pulling the howitzer through
and putting it away in oil, but some
latent gift within attracted me irresist-
ibly to the modelling outfit. Unconsci-
ously I fell to work and soon under my
feverish sensitive fingers the inanimate
clay took life and became an exquisite
bas-relief representing Lord NoFTH-
CLIFFE refusing an option on the vacant
possession of No. 10, Downing Street.
The howitzer was a businesslike
weapon with elevating and traversing
gear and a good supply of ammunition.
After some preliminary registering I
subjected the hearthrug to a searching
fire, forcing the cat to retire in marked
disorder.
The piece was then brought into
position under cover of some volumes
of the Encyclopædia, and long range,
high angle fire brought to bear upon
the parrot emplacement with good
effect. At 15.23 hours a direct hit on
the parrot was observed, followed by a
loud explosion.
At this moment the door opened.
Penelope stood on the threshold taking
in the details of the scene.
“Just testing the toy I have bought
for my little god-son Wilfred,” I has-
tened to explain. (It is just possible to
get in the first word of an argument
with Penelope.) “It is so disappoint-
ing for a child when the toy does not
live up to its high promise.”
“Very,” she replied; “and Wilfred is
so hard to please considering he is only
three months old.”
:k x: :: ×
I have decided after all to present
Wilfred with some Victory Loan, and
as to the Mission those blankets in my
kit will be just the thing.
Animated by a consciousness of well-
directed beneficence, I ought not to
have a dull moment during the long
winter evenings. -

BROTHER HEROES.
[“Trench stunts” are reported to be popular
with tourists in the battle areas. To spend a
night in a shell hole, “just to see what it was
like,” is the right thing to do.]
I'M glad I found out what the War was
like,
Sat in a shell hole 'neath a raining
sky
And learned how surely cold and damp-
ness strike
Into your very vitals; for thereby
I feel I'm one with those who bore the
brunt
(Of course we'd air-raids on the Lon-
don front).
I set myself no dilettante task;
Not till a full five dreary hours had
sped,
And nought remained within my brandy
flask,
Did I go back to breakfast and to bed
(I wonder if our gallant lads as well
Withdrew to this same excellent hotel).
I'm glad I had the enterprise to keep
My vigil thus; no more need I re-
frain
From martial speech and hold my man-
hood cheap
When any speaks of “Wipers" or
“Loovain; ”
In tones of comradeship I can declare,
“I know, old chap, I know it. I was
there.”

PROBLEMATICS.
THEY were introduced in the very
earliest stages of my education. In-
stead of being told to divide 1728 by
144, I was informed that Mr. Shirley,
a greengrocer, had just packed 1728
oranges in a box, with 144 in each
layer, and wanted me to work out the
number of layers.
I reached the stage of square-roots
only to find that I had to satisfy the
symmetrical whim of a fastidious farmer
who wanted to plant 576 mangel-wur-
zels in rows in such a way that the
number of wurzels in each row should
equal the number of rows.
“And now,” said the Chief Instructor
on a Sniping Course, ten years later,
“let’s see if you've got the idea of
the thing. Just take this down —
‘Rifleman Longsight sees a canary in
a tree; he adjusts his sights to 200,
takes a regulation aim and fires. He
observes his shot to strike nine inches
below the centre of the lowest visible
portion of the canary. He moves his
sights to 350 and this time smashes
a twig six inches above his point of
aim. His rifle and shooting were per-
What was the range of the canary 2'"
But what appeared to me to be
merely occasional levity in the School-
master and the Instructor I have found
to be a positive obsession in the mind
of a University Lecturer in Law.
The aspirant to the degree of LL.B.
is confronted in the earliest stages of
his training by Aulus, Balbus, Caius
and Decius, who, owing to a series of
coincidences which would have puzzled
even JustiNIAN himself, have decided
to take legal advice, and, having con-
fidence in the student's well-deserved
reputation, submit themselves to his
judgment.
But the imagination of a don is only
given full scope when the student has
begun the study of English Law. The
problem is usually presented in as
topical a form as possible.
Rowhard, Cox and Banker, three
undergraduates, proceed after a bump-
supper to Rowhard's rooms, which are
on the second floor; Bower, another
undergraduate, promising to join them
in a few minutes. Considerable commo-
tion is caused by the discovery that the
only bottle of whisky has been borrowed,
“Thieves.” A Russian research student
living on the floor below is roused by the
shout, and, jumping out of bed, hastily
puts on his eyeglasses, snatches up his
revolver and rushes upstairs. Rowhard,
thinking that the sound of footsteps sig-
nifies the arrival of Bower, seizes a soda-
water syphon and discharges its con-
tents into the face of the Russian on the
stairs, who, in throwing his left hand
up to protect himself, forces a portion
of his eyeglasses into one of his eyes,
seriously impairing the sight of it. At
the same moment he fires his revolver,
and the bullet strikes Cox in the big
toe of his right foot. Banker shouts
“Murder ’’ and rushes into the rooms
of Fitz-James Austin opposite. The
latter, a very nervous undergraduate,
who has been devoting himself that
evening to the study of the mental
element in guilt, jumps out of window
in terror and breaks his leg on the
pavement of the court below, at the
same time knocking down Bower, who
is on his way round to Rowhard's
rooms, and fracturing one of his thighs.
Consider the legal position of all
parties.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EXPERT ADVICE.
I AM most anxious to avoid getting
a cold. And the newspapers are even
more anxious about it than I am.
Every day, just now, they warn me
about the necessity of keeping the sys-
tem up to tone, of the danger lurking
in chills, and, above all, of the fact that
the colds of the population cost the
nation fifty million pounds a year.
They give me expert advice, culled
from that army of medical men who
are so unassuming that they prefer to
be nameless, merely using in their
modesty such self-effacing descriptions
as “An Eminent Physician,” “A Well-
Known Surgeon,” “A Harley Street
Expert,” or just “A Medical Man.”
Knowing it is all done for my good,
I have tried to follow the newspaper
instructions. I began with the advice
of one expert, who declared: “To avoid
a cold, eat as little as possible. The
practice of clogging the system by an
abundance of proteins and proteids
puts too much work on the alimentary
organs. The subject is thus unable to
resist streptococci and pneumococci”
—this was rather beyond me, but I felt
the chap meant well—“which promptly
invade the system.”
Forthwith I took to frugal living. I
allowed my butter ration to be absorbed
by a hearty member of the family; I
eschewed bacon ; I renounced second
helpings. Nevertheless I got a cold.
Scarcely had I recovered when further
newspaper advice caught my eye.
“If you would keep fit at this time
of the year,” it stated, “and above all
ward off chills, eat as much and as
often as possible. The system cannot
have any resisting power against
streptococci and pneumococci”—all
the authorities seem unanimous about
these nicknames, anyway—“if it is not
adequately stoked by the fuel of ample
diet.”
Hurriedly I resumed my butter
ration — not without some difficulty
with the hearty member of the family
—and went on ample diet. Neverthe-
less I got another cold.
A little shaken in my faith, I was
still determined to persevere. The
advice now took a dictatorial turn,
which might have unnerved a less
courageous disciple.
“Directly you enter a train,” it com-
manded, “fling open both windows to
clear off the germs. Be firm in ignor-
ing possible protests of less enlightened
passengers. Further, a wafer of in-
cense, or one of any pungent odour, may
be burned as a safeguard for all present.
Remember too that should a person
sneeze in a public compartment with
out holding a handkerchief to his face
he is performing an act of pure Bol-
shevism. It is your duty to be alert,
and, at the sight of an approaching
sneeze on the visage of anyone in your
radius, bring your newspaper sharply
over the face of the offender; though it
is better to carry a large sheet of pre-
pared antiseptic blotting-paper for this
purpose. Travellers in public vehicles
should band themselves together and
eject anyone showing symptoms of a
cold.”
The very next time I had to travel
I entered my compartment in a spirit
of quiet determination, armed with
incense-wafers and antiseptic blotting-
paper.
As the “Eminent Physician” and I
had anticipated, both the windows
were closed. A man in the corner was
coughing; a woman opposite to him
sneezed. So did the young man on my
left and the maiden on my right. No
one seemed possessed of antiseptic
blotting-paper or, apparently, a hand-
kerchief to hold before them. I pic-
tured the streptococci and pneumococci
as reeling from one to another of us,
fairly gorging themselves, and then
going away to tell their friends about
us and put them on to a good thing.
The time had come for action. I
could not let the nation go on sacri-
ficing fifty million pounds a year in
this way if I could help to prevent it.
I rose, flung open both windows, cir-
cumvented the man in the corner, who
was about to sneeze for the third time,
by a swift application of the blotting-
paper, and had just got a couple of
incense-wafers alight when . . .
Isn't it strange that when you want
to help humanity, when you strive to
enlighten your fellow - creatures, you
are always misunderstood? I mean
to say, don't you think that people in
railway - carriages have a bitter, sus-
picious outlook on life? There wasn't
any excuse for the people in that com-
partment either; they had evidently
read the “Eminent Physician's" in-
structions, because they adopted that
bit about travellers in public vehicles
banding themselves together and eject-
ing anyone showing symptoms of a
cold. Only, of course, in their blunder-
ing way they had got the wrong hang
of the thing. I hadn't a cold that
time, and yet they put me out on the
platform at the very next station.

QUITE, QUITE.
I HAVE decided at last upon a pro-
fession. I am going to set up as a
quorister.
It had been a busy morning with me
at the office, and I felt annoyed at first
on being interrupted. I had been en-
gaged for about twenty minutes in pre-
paring a draught by putting the office
copy of The Times over the fireplace,
where two lukewarm pieces of coke had
been laid. I had just got them to spark
nicely when the paper suddenly went
up with a loud roar into Victoria Street
by way of the chimney. The only
thing to do was to paste the edges of a
number of spare minute sheets together
in order to form a substitute, and I was
just accomplishing this when Enderby
burst in.
“You're wanted at once in Room
1005,” he said.
“What for?” I asked nervously and
glueing myself rather badly on the left
sleeve. -
“The Committee are sitting,” he
said: “you've got to make a quorum.”
“I’m awfully sorry,” I said, “but I
never got beyond quadratic equations;
besides—”
“It's perfectly easy," he told me;
“you've to take Anderson's place.
You'll only have to sit there and say
nothing and look wise. The Secretary
will introduce you as acting for Mr.
Anderson.”
“Lend me your spectacles and your
spats then,” I stipulated.
He did so, and when I had adjusted
these I went down immediately to a
long dark room, in which several kind-
looking and sleepy old gentlemen and
one extremely young and alert one sat
about a table covered with green baize
and furnished with more pink blotting-
paper than I had ever seen before in
the whole of my life.
As soon as I came ºn I was intro-
duced to the Chairman, and the alert
young man began to read out in a quick
clear voice a number of entirely unin-
telligible sentences, and every time he
stopped for breath the Chairman looked
round rather timidly and said, “I think
we all agree with that, gentlemen.”
Thereupon the old gentlemen frowned
a little over their spectacles and said,
“Quite, quite,” and I frowned a little
over Enderby's spectacles (it is, as a
matter of fact, extraordinarily hard to
frown under them), and kicked my
spats with each toe in turn to make
sure they were there and said, “Quite,
quite,” too.
Every now and then I felt an irresist-
ible temptation to say “Quack, quack,”
but I checked it in time, feeling some-
how that it was better to follow the

normal procedure. By degrees some-
thing about the authoritative manner
or the sonorous quality of my “Quite,
quite's" made such an impression that
one by one the old gentlemen began
to leave off quite-quiteing and relin-
quish the whole business to me. And
when, towards the end of the meeting,
I was able to produce a box of matches
and light the cigar of the old gentle-
man on my right and the cigarette of
the old gentleman on my left, it was
clear that they regarded me as a man
of profound administrative capacity
and skill in worldly affairs.
It was after this that I made my
momentous decision. I am about to
rent an office and engage a typist with
gold hair and grey suède shoes and a
bag with a powder-puff in—a typist
of the kind that makes tea at eleven
o'clock in the morning and three o'clock
in the afternoon, and spells “custom-
ary” with an “e’’; and I am going to
put a brass plate outside the door with
“H. Jenkinson, Quorister” engraved
upon it, and underneath this, “Busi-
ness, professional and political quora
ready made or bespoke.” And people
will ring me up on the telephone or
write letters to me asking me to make
a quorum, and the letters will be filed
by the quarum and I shall go out and
make quora and charge two guineas a
time.
I am well aware that at first I shall
have a good deal of opposition to en-
counter. People will say that I cannot
sit on committees of which I am not
a member. But when one thinks of
the number of cold mornings when it
is nice in bed, or of bright mornings
when it is nice in the country, the
advantages of having a professional
quorum - constituter always ready to
oblige will soon become clear. I shall
attend and hand in my card with the
name of the member I am representing
underneath it to the clever and com-
petent young secretary, and, as soon as
the meeting has started, the perfect
timbre of my “Quite, quite ” will re-
assure any malcontent, there may be:
and, if any member does lodge an
objection, I shall frown at him a little
over my spectacles, which will not be
Enderby's but my own, and rimmed
with the most expensive tortoiseshell.
And in time perhaps I shall establish
quoristry as a profession and obtain a
charter for it, and there will be schools
in which students and associates will
be taught to wear spats and to say
“Quite, quite ” in a properly authori-
tative manner, and nobody will have
to go to committees at all, except the
chairman and the alert young secretary
and a quorum of quite-quiters from the
Associated Institute of Quoristers. And
the fees of members who have advanced
in the profession will of course become
higher and higher. Men such as these
will attend only very important com-
mittees and will be able to say “Quite ”
with an intonation so perfect that it
will go far towards settling the doubts
of a deputation of bargees and lighter-
men. I reckon that our fees for a
Cabinet Meeting will be about a hundred
guineas. Evoe.
Thanet.
All true hearts will go out to the
Northcliffe Press in its embarrassment
(painful, if bravely concealed) over
the victory of a HARMsworth in the
Coalition ilterest.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 24th.-Judging by
appearances Sir FREDERICK HALL is
anything but a timorous person. He
looks as if he might hold his own with
BECKETT or CARPENTIER. But when he
thinks of foreign competition with our
manufacturers his heart is as water.
A recent statement of the PRESIDENT
of THE BoARD of TRADE, that he did
not shiver at the prospect of Japanese
rivalry, moved him sorely. “Is that
correct?” he asked in amazement.
“Quite right,” returned the right hon-
ourable gentleman cheerfully; “I am
not shivering at all."
Sir AUCKLAND is anxious
to extend this happy con-
dition to his fellow-coun-
trymen generally. A few
days ago he was proving,
with the aid of elaborate
statistics, that it was im-
possible to lower the price
of coal by anything like
the six shillings recently
imposed. Now he an-
nounced, to the mingled
joy and surprise of the
House, that the price of
household coal was to
come down promptly by
a whole half-sovereign.
The process of reason-
ing by which the reduction
was justified was not too
clear. There is still a
shortage of production,
and inland coal is still be-
ing sold at less than its
cost price—a “very dan-
gerous position,” in the
Minister's opinion; but ex-
port rates are very high,
so the Government have
decided to share their in-
flated profits with the
home-consumer. Even the proverbial
unwisdom of looking a gift-horse in the
mouth did not prevent Members from
speculating on the reasons for this
sudden change of policy.
Asked whether the British Ambassa-
dor at Washington had any particular
mission as regards the Irish Question,
Sir HAMAR GREENwood replied, “Only
the mission which is entrusted to all
representatives of HIS MAJESTY abroad
of explaining when necessary the policy
of HIS MAJESTY's Government.” It
looks as if Lord GREY must have been
kept pretty busy of late.
In view of the large number of works
of art which have recently left this
country for America, Sir W. DAvison
suggested the advisability of putting
on an export duty. The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER rather smiled upon
the proposal, provided that it was con-
fined to old masters. The limitation
is certainly desirable. An over-" con-
trolled" generation would witness the
disappearance of most of its new masters
without a pang.
The natural desire of the London
County Council that its lines should
be laid in pleasant places has been
checked by the FIRST CoMMissionER
of WoRKs. “Through my heart first,”
was practically his reply to the pro-
posal to run tram-cars through Hyde
Park. . -

LORD MILNER AND LORD CURzoN.
in Egypt it should be the massive
oration in which Lord CURzoN traced
the course of events there since 1914,
and laid down the policy which His
MAJESTY's Government intended to pur-
sue. We might have annexed Egypt
on the outbreak of the war with Turkey
—it would probably have saved a lot
of trouble if we had, though Lord
CURzoN did not say so—but we deli-
berately preferred to declare a pro-
tectorate, a vague term which might
mean much or little in the way of con-
trol, and which the Egyptian National-
ists have perhaps naturally interpreted
in a different sense from ours. But now
our course is clear. We are not going
to leave Egypt at the mercy of Turkey
or any other foreign Power; but we
are going to associate the natives “pro-
gressively" with their own administra-
_
tion. To ascertain, after full consulta-
tion with all persons concerned, the
best way of carrying out this policy is
the task assigned to Lord MILNER's
Mission, now, after many delays, on
the eve of departure. If anyone can
persuade the Egyptians that the best
way to fulfil their aspirations is to re-
main under the agis of the British
Empire it should, as Lord SELBoRNE
remarked, be the man who gained his
first reputation as the author of England
in Egypt.
No man would dare to impugn the
valour of the SERJEANT-AT-ARMs, who
has shown his mettle many times
both on land and sea.
Yet I fancy he blenched
a little at Mr. Bottom-
LEY's proposal that he
should bring up in cus-
tody the Sinn Fein M.P.'s
who have hitherto refused
to take their seats. For
the recalcitrant Members
include Countess MARKIE-
VICz, and, if she resisted
arrest, Sir Colin KEPPEL
would have some difficulty
in reconciling duty with
chivalry. I think he was
quite relieved when Mr.
BoNAR LAw replied that
he saw in the proposal
no advantage either to the
Nation or the Govern-
ment.
Not content with the
removal of restrictions on
the supply of whisky some
Members are now pres-
sing for a reduction in the
price. Mr. McCURDY, how-
ever, thought it would be
imprudent at present to
abolish the maximum, but
expressed a hope that in
course of time the revival
of competition between traders would
result in lower prices. Mr. McCURDy
is always an optimist.
Wednesday, November 26th.—Only
yesterday Sir DoNALD MACLEAN was
holding up his hands in horror at the
suggestion that some financial difficulty
could be adjusted in “another place.”
Yet this afternoon the Lords had the
temerity to discuss at considerable
length a very important financial matter
—to wit, the origin of the present high
prices. True, they did not arrive at an
agreed conclusion. Lord D'ABERNoN
had no doubt that high prices were
largely attributable to currency-infla-
tion. Lord PEEL was equally confi-
dent that they were principally due to
diminished production. Lord BUCK-
MASTER maintained that currency must
be reduced, and put in an eloquent plea

for the people earning from three hun-
dred to a thousand pounds a year, “the
most self-sacrificing class in the whole
community,” who had suffered grievous
losses in the War and gained nothing
out of it. -
At the instance of Lord PARMooR
the Peers decided by a narrow majority
that clergymen were not fit persons to
sit in the House of Commons, or, it
would perhaps be more accurate to say,
that the House of Commons was not
a fit place for clergy to sit in. Even
on the Episcopal Bench there was much
diversity of opinion. Thus, while the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY thought
that it was a great advantage for clergy-
men in their social work to stand out-
side the ordinary rut of political
partisanship, the Bishop of LLAN-
DAFF, in a passage for which the
Commons will hardly thank him,
dwelt upon the desirability of rais-
ing the tone of that assembly by
the admission of “men of great in-
tellectual ability, wide outlook and
high character.”
While the Upper House was thus
concerned with the constitution of
the Lower the Commons returned
the compliment by discussing the
position of the Peers. Mr. J. H.
THoMAs, touched to the quick by
the sad case of Lord ASTOR, who
has lately become a Peer against —&
his will, and alarmed, perchance,
by the possibility that in these days
of rapid social evolution he himself
may be exposed to the same fate,
sought leave to bring in a Bill to
empower HIS MAJESTY to accept
the surrender of any peerage. In-
cidentally he seized the opportun-
ity to dissociate himself from the
apostles of “direct action,” declar-
ing that, in a constitutional coun-
try like this, Parliament should be su-
preme. It needed considerable self-
abnegation for Major WooD to oppose
the Bill, since its passage would in the
ordinary course of nature enable him
some day to describe himself as “Lord
Halifax, Gentleman,” but he did so on
the ground that the Government were
pledged to the reform of the House of
Lords, and it was no good trying to do
the thing piecemeal.
Thursday, November 27th. — The
Aliens Bill ran the gauntlet of much
severe criticism in the Lords before
obtaining a Second Reading. Lord
NEwToN, pursuing an old vendetta, at-
tributed the harshness of some of its
provisions to the sensational Press, and
asked if the Government knew there
was a Peace on. The hardships that
might be inflicted on innocent for-
eigners made Lords BUCKMASTER and
PARMooR so angry that Lord LINCOLN-
SHIRE, “as a lifelong Liberal,” was
moved to come to the rescue of the
measure, with the remark that its op-
ponents seemed to think that it was
going to be administered by prize idiots.
The Lord CHANCELLOR admitted that
the “stunt" Press might have had a
hand in the shaping of the Bill, but
pleaded in extenuation that such news-
papers had a flair for “what the public
were thinking to-day and what they
were going to think to-morrow.” While
Germany was in default on half-a-dozen
of her principal undertakings under the
Peace Treaty it was risky to assume
that the War was over and that pre-
cautions were no longer necessary.

COGGESHALL-GOTHAM.
THE township of Coggeshall-Gotham
lies in a sleepy hollow, the direct ap-
proach to which is down a steep hill
that has made most of its visitors give
it a wide berth. A warning that the
hill is dangerous has been fixed at the
bottom of the slope by the authorities,
as experience has proved that accidents
occur there more frequently than at the
top.
Two bridges, a hundred yards apart,
have been built across the river Coggle,
which flows through the valley. A
by-law requires everyone crossing the
North Bridge to pay a toll of twopence.
When sufficient money has been raised
by this means to defray its cost it
will be declared free, and the South
Bridge, hitherto free, will levy a toll
to pay for its erection. To cope
with the floods of the Coggle in
winter the authorities have built
a dam in the higher part of the
parish, diverting the rising waters
into the fields, thus keeping the
river at a uniform level. The old
practice of damming the stream
with hurdles has been given up as
unsatisfactory. As the river might
run dry in very hot weather the
inhabitants of the township are
directed to make liberal use of the
water supply in winter and abstain
from drinking in summer.
Coggeshall-Gotham was not slow
to turn the forces of nature to its
advantage. A pipe thirteen miles
long has been laid from the sea at
Coggeshall-super Mare to a reser-
voir built at Coggle Tor, eight hun-
dred feet above sea level, where
turbine machinery has been in-
stalled, to be driven by water falling
from the reservoir, thus generating
electric power and light. The steam
pumping plant, which forced the sea-
water up to the reservoir, was probably
larger than any similar machinery in
the world. This has now been scrapped,
as the local engineers have decided to
employ the current generated by the
falling water to raise it from sea level
to the reservoir. As a matter of pre-
caution oil lamps are kept alight in the
streets all day in case the electric light
fails at night.
Nor are the authorities of this com-
munity behind-hand in dealing with
social and industrial questions. In
matters of sobriety, honesty and good
conduct the inhabitants of Coggeshall-
Gotham are united in an ideal citizen-
ship. They nevertheless recognise a
right to liberty of opinion and action
in the application of the great principles
which are the heritage of the people.

this community. On the contrary they
enjoy a code of laws specially enacted
by and for them no less freely than do
the majority who live under what is
known as the Majority Law.
For instance, regulations as to the
lighting of vehicles after dark are not
applicable to all and sundry, for there
were, and still are, divers opinions on the
matter. A man of the Majority, whose
representatives have passed a by-law
requiring the lighting of vehicles after
dusk, may be and is fined for driving
without lights. On the other hand, a
Minority man, who has registered his
objection to this, is absolutely free to
drive an unlighted vehicle. It is by
such a system of judicious compromise
that it is possible to meet and solve the
debatable problems of prohibition, Sun-
day trading, privilege of the Press, etc.
As soon as any of the community
strike work to indicate dissatisfaction
with wages or conditions of labour, the
authorities of Coggeshall-Gotham cause
labour in every trade, profession, class,
vocation and employment to cease, in
order that no section of workers may
have a grievance greater than that of
another. In this way equality and
sympathy of feeling are maintained.
To meet the depreciation of the
sovereign a sliding scale has been
adopted whereby the pound sterling is
made equivalent to thirty, forty, or
fifty shillings, according to the regula-
tions in force at the time. The housing

“I AM going to be a Master of Foxhounds when I † do about it 2 -
up,” said my friend Isabel, as I met her by chance taking
the air with her brother Lionel and their nurse. Her
ambition was inspired, no doubt, by the portraits of lady
M.F.H.'s which jostle musical comedy actresses in the
Photographic Press. +
“But don't you think lady Masters of Foxhounds will
come to an end when we are settled down to Peace 2 "I
asked.
“That won't make any difference,” said Isabel, “because,
if our next baby is a girl, Mummy says I may become a
boy. Of course, if Lionel would change with me,” she went
on to explain, “I could be one at once, but Lionel wants
to stay a boy, and Daddy says he must have one girl in the
family.”
“So you've got to wait?” I said.
“Yes.” -
“But if the next baby is a girl your Daddy will be content
with her, and you can become first a boy and later on a
Master of Foxhounds 2"
“Yes, that's right,” responded Isabel in such a sanguine
tone that I had not the heart to suggest that the fact that
her Daddy was a barrister with a practice worth a hundred-
and-fifty pounds a year, supplemented by the slenderest of
private means, might also be an obstacle to her plans. I
therefore raised my hat and wished her good-bye.
Isabel raised her hat in return, for in anticipation of her
prospective manhood it was her gentle custom to salute
or to return the salutes of her friends by removing her hat
from her head. As she wore her hair of a length which
has not been fashionable amongst men since the days of
the Cavaliers, and as her hat was attached to her head by
an unmanly piece of elastic, the practice was viewed with
extreme disfavour by her nurse, since it was impossible to
perform this act of courtesy without throwing her curls
into the most glorious disarray and flinging her hair-
ribbon to the pavement.
A week or two later I met Isabel again. I took off my
hat. On this occasion she did not acknowledge my saluta-
tion in the customary manner. She merely bowed. Look-
ing up, I noticed a bundle of white in her nurse's arms.
“Hallo,” I cried, “the next baby has arrived, and you
will be able to become a Master of Foxhounds 2"
“No, I shan't,” retorted Isabel; “it’s only a boy.”
“Well, have you thought what profession you are going
to take up instead?" I asked. -
“No," replied Isabel glumly; “I expect, after all, I shall
just have to be an ordinary mummy—like Mummy.” -

“A PLEA FOR THE OWL.”
[Mr. JoHN LEE has pointed out the usefulness of the owl in devour.
ing creatures “whose destruction of foodstuffs in this country is not
sufficiently realised.” It will be recalled that when Persephone was in
Hades and Pluto gave her leave to return to the upper air provided she
had not eaten anything, Ascalaphus reported that she had eaten a slice
of pomegranate. By way of revenge Persephone ultimately made an
owl of him.] -
WHEN sorrow - sick Persephone, half-wild through hope
deferred,
Bestowed his somewhat curious shape upon this ancient
bird, -
She saddled him, I take it, with such a vile repute,
That ever since at sight of him one felt inclined to hoot.
I too possessed the feeling that he who told the tale
Which damaged this poor lady was quite beyond the pale;
I said, “Of all informers, few are so low as he,”
Until I saw the point of view advanced by Mr. LEE.
Ascalaphus, I gather, is a useful little soul;
He holds that mice are tasty, has a penchant for the vole;
And woe betide the raiding rat who chances to be out,
For owls are always hungry, and they leave no bones about.
I find him, then, a patriot, who does his fellows good
By swallowing four-legged profiteers who’d fatten on our
food; - -
And sparrows, too, those reevers of our country's fruit and
COrn, -
They curse (in barns) the rueful day Ascalaphus was born.
Then let us be forgiving, and yield with one consent
Our welcome to this sinner who has chosen to repent,
Who crowns with honourable works a life long over-cast,
And clothes with virtue here to-day his questionable past.

unobtrusive, a manner. Mrs. — is a very charming and pathetic

THE DOOR-MAT.
OUR tenancy of No. 31, Aysgarth
Mansions, St. John's Wood, would have
expired in the ordinary course at Christ-
mas. Our landlord wanted us to go.
He has a waiting list of anxious would-
be tenants for most of these flats, at
almost any rental, while from us he
could only demand a ten per cent. in-
crease if we stayed after that time. We
too were anxious to go. We don't like
the landlord, his administrators and
their designs, but so long as we could
not find anywhere else to go we de-
termined to lie low.
But last week Anita discovered Elm
Lodge, Golder's Green, a non-basement
house of the right size, not more damp
than most—a house, in fact, which
The landlord was evidently feeling
uppish too (and what landlord doesn't
just now 2), for the mat was not re-
stored to its fond owners, nor was any
reply received to my letter the same or
the next day. The only letter, in fact,
that we received on the 26th was one
from our prospective landlord's agent,
informing us “re Elm Lodge" that he
had discovered that we were only second
in the field, and that if the references
of our rivals were satisfactory we should
not be able to secure that desirable
residence.
So we decided that it might be as
well to hedge a little with our present
landlord. Accordingly I addressed him
as follows:—
DEAR SIR,--The mat has not come
back, nor have I heard from you. I
leads me to doubt the genuineness of
your complaint.
I have every confidence in my staff,
and can only add that, if the mat is
removed by you or at your instigation,
I shall have no option but to at once
place the matter in the hands of my
solicitors.
I should be only too happy if you
found it convenient to vacate No. 31,
either on the termination of your pre-
sent tenancy at the end of the Christ-
mas quarter, or earlier.
Yours faithfully, J. SANDEMAN.
I chewed this letter till the following
day, when we received a note informing
us that Elm Lodge was ours, with im-
mediate possession, the references of our
rivals having evidently proved unsatis-
factory. We were so up in the air
seemed to fill the bill of our
The agent believed we
were first in the field, and
our offer was so liberal that
he thought the landlord
might (he would not commit
himself further) entertain it.
We felt so uppish with
this that when our outside
door-mat was removed (dur-
ing our week-end absence
from the 21st to the 25th of
November) we didn't take
it lying down. After an
immediate tour of several
staircases I returned to
No. 31 and commenced a
slight passage-of-ink with
the landlord, opening with
this, which I sent by hand:—
DEAR SIR,--I am sorry to
trouble you about what may
seem a trifling matter.

again that I felt that Sande-
man, with whom I was sure
I should never have deal-
ings again, ought to have a
chance of sharing our high
spirits. I accordingly ad-
dressed him as follows:—
MY DEAR SIR,-Your de-
lightful letter of the 28th
inst. is to hand, and has
been much enjoyed. In fact,
all here at No. 31 are loud
in their praises of your liter-
ary style. Personally I may
say I find it difficult to de-
cide which I appreciate the
more, the split infinitive or
the kind thought in the ex-
pression of which it forms
so ornamental a part.
Yours faithfully,
ALFRED F. SUMMERs-
Johnson.
P.S.—You can have No. 31
Between the 21st and 25th inst.
our front door-mat was removed, and,
as I have since discovered, placed out-
side the door of No. 97, and chained
down in a cruel manner.
Now you may say, “How do you
know it is your mat?” ... I am ready to
admit that in the main the members of
the door-mat family bear a striking re-
semblance to one another, but the
ravages of time have left certain marks
on the whiskers and on the underside
of this one that leave no doubt in my
mind as to its identity.
I find on enquiry that No. 97 was
vacated on Saturday the 22nd of No-
vember, and let on Monday the 24th,
during which interval we were away
from home. I say nothing about this
coincidence, but shall be obliged if you
will see that our dear mat occupies its
old and honourable position outside our
door on or before to-morrow morning.
Yours faithfully,
ALFRED F. SUMMERs-Johnson.
trust you did not misconstrue my for-
mer letter.
Although I am positive about the
mat being ours, I do not suggest that
anyone in your employ would have re-
moved it, even to make No. 97 look
more attractive to a potential tenant.
But I shall be grateful if you will
have it replaced outside our door. I
am sure the poor thing frets under its
captivity; and if you would even but
have it unchained I am confident it
would find its way back to

ALFRED F. SUMMERs-Johnson.
On Friday the 28th I received the
following from the landlord:—
Re Door-mat, 31, Aysgarth Mansions.
DEAR SIR,--I am in receipt of two
letters from you re above, and the
levity with which you treat the matter,

porters assure me that the mat in ques-
tion has always been outside No. 97,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. H. F. PREvost BATTERsby's new novel, The Edge
of Doom (LANE), suffers in part from the drawback of
appearing a little after the fair. For this I understand that
our old and well-nigh forgotten friend, the military censor,
must accept some of the blame. It starts with a situation
of admirable promise. Julian Abingdon, East African
explorer, being reported missing under circumstances of
possible discredit, Cyllene Moriston, his betrothed, first
persuades another admirer of hers, one Chaytor, to organise
a search-party, and then decides to join it herself. This,
of course, is what I have been told vulgar persons call
asking for trouble. Nor is the request long unanswered.
Chaytor finds Abingdom, not only alive, but happy as a
king (dusky variety) and very similarly circumstanced.
Being naturally unable to fire this horrid truth at Cyllene
(by this time in the throes of fever) he has first of all to com-
pose a pathetic lie about alonesome grave, and subsequently,
for facility of transport, to marry her himself, all of which
I found good entertainment, full of the precise kind of direct
action that I like in novels. What followed, though direct
enough and written with a fine vigour and a candour that
is at times almost startling (see above), is not what I had
been expecting. It develops, in short, into a remarkably
outspoken war-novel, of which—however I might regret
the story it had seemed about to be—I have to admit the
power. Full of fury and indiscretion (the final attack is at
times almost unreadably vivid) Mr. BATTERSBY's active-
service revelations held even a reviewer whose weariness
of war-fiction is become such that he can never see a trench
without wanting to skip it. More I cannot say.
Generals may write and counterwrite in column after
column, but it has been left to Mr. W. J. SELIGMAN to
expound the most shocking intrigue of Armageddon.
Whether he has been wise to reveal that secret of the
“hidden hand” which has so troubled our various Expedi-
tionary Forces I cannot say. But in The Salonica, Side-
Show (ALLEN AND UNwiN), speaking as an officer in the
A.S.C., he attempts to exonerate himself in the matter of
the potatoes when there is only one sack, and of the straw-
berry jam when there isn't any at all. You can't divide a
single sack or a couple of tins amongst a score of units, he
tells us, and you can't give them all to one, because that
would make the others jealous; so what wonder if the
poor puzzled A.S.C. keep these dainties to themselves?
And after that lame excuse is all forgiven and forgotten,
Old Bill ? Not half, I do not think. But lest it should be
thought that Mr. SELIGMAN has not told us also of cam-
paigns and strategy and international policy and other such
minor details, let me hasten to add that in The Salomica
Side-Show he has written a most instructive and withal an
exceedingly amusing book of life behind the lines and, when
the chance came, of fighting too. Only about his ancient
history I do not feel so sure, for he tells me at the end of
the book that CAEsAR GERMANICUs, a statue of whom he dis-
covered at Amphipolis, was a Roman emperor. But that, of
course, was long before the days of plum-and-apple conserve.

Miss RomeR WILsoN is apt to hide her most beautiful
pearls under heaps of shell of this kind: “It was cold in
bed to-night, therefore he sat up and dragged his old fur
coat off the chair beside him and struggled to spread it
over the bed without getting out,” etc., etc. You will meet
with a good deal of this insignificant realism in If All These
Young Men (METHUEN), but you will be well advised to
accept it with patience, for you will be rewarded with
thoughts and passages of really startling beauty. The
story here is of the slightest. Josephine loves Sebastian,
who feels himself bound to the indifferent virginal Everett.
There are other incidental variations on the tangled attrac-
tions and reactions of the amorous young. Miss WILSON,
in the over-elaborate detail of her material setting, is apt to
be tedious, but I hasten to add that her perception of the
heroic illusions, the egotisms, the hesitations and the nobler
realities of rather too clever youth in love is positively
astounding, though her heroes and heroines are alike a
hold and haunt you—one certainly that will add greatly
to her reputation as an artist.
Mrs. HoRACE TREMLETT's Platonic Peter (HUTCHINsoN) is
just what its title suggests and also just clever enough to
annoy you because it isn't a shade cleverer still. It is
quite an amusing story of the Mayoress of a country town
and her platonic friendship and flirtation with an officer
on the staff of the General whose headquarters are in the
neighbourhood. Judy, the Mayoress, is a charming person,
though almost preternaturally wily, and Mrs. TREMLETT,
who has displayed her puppet's mental activities with con-
siderable skill, succeeded in leaving me quite uncertain as
to whether she would or would not ultimately abandon the
solid comforts of her life as Mayoress for the beaux yeur of
the very unplatonic Peter. Perhaps to serve as contrast to
this inherently vulgar story, Mrs. TREMLETT has interwoven
with it the history of a fine woman's faithful love for a
man crippled in the War. It is a beautiful tale and well
little pallid. To students of the intriguing phenomena of
modernist youth I -
commend it without

into a shining pleasaunce. The tale of how, into his new
town of gardens and parades, he built his dreams and the
youth he was content to forgo, I found one of unusual charm.
After a while love comes to join battle for Moneypenny's
heart in the person of a little brown-eyed governess, Morgan,
heiress of enchantment, symbol of all the wild freedoms of
his nature that Moneypenny had tamed, as he had tamed
the sea and the tamarisks into the ordered elegance of the
new Marlingate. The story moves with a queerly pic-
turesque effect in its mid-Victorian setting. Deliber-
ately unrealistic it fascinates almost as would a ballet or a
poem. Once indeed the author does actually drop, not too
successfully, into verses that may, I fancy, have formed
the embryo of the book. In the end, after a brief interlude
of passion, ambition for his town conquers human love in
Moneypenny, and the death of Morgan, defeated, finishes
the first half of the story. Frankly, I should have been
better pleased had there been no second, for thence onwards
the tale seems, in my seeing, to go to pieces. From a fan-
tasy it becomes a grotesque. Only the fine sincerity of
Miss KAYE-SMITH's treatment rescues Moneypenny's crazed
revenge upon the town from becoming a horrid absurdity.
But, taken all in all, she has written a novel that will both
may disappoint you, or it may not ; it would have dis-
appointed me when I was your age.” Without the smallest
claim to be considered a boy in years, I still ask leave to
express a little disappointment; and this solely because the
book which Sir HENRY has hitherto given us at Christmas has
been one which veterans and boys have been equally greedy to
read. Now he turns his attention to explorers—splendid
men all of them, men of whom boys will read with fine
delight. Who, for instance, can think of Captain Scott
without feelings of affection and sincere pride? Sir HENRY
relates the exploits of these heroes in a quiet style which
gets straight home. But those of us who take interest in
exploration are already familiar with these great adventures.
Hence the veteran growl which accompanies my heartiest
compliments.

T0 DORA, WHO DECLINES TO DIE.
[At the Standing Committee on the War
Emergency Laws Continuation Bill various
powers conferred on Dora were retained, in-
cluding the power “to prohibit whistling and
other moises.”]
THERE was in my career a phase
When I required a stalwart mate
To hold my hand, to guide my ways,
To keep my erring fancy straight;
But, now the need is over-blown,
Once more I want to have my head,
And still “She goeth not,” I moan;
“I would that she were dead.”
It sounds uncivil, I admit,
To scrap you when the danger's
gone ;
Yet only for a passing fit
As tempy bride I took you on ;
My loyal patience you abuse;
I yearn for half-forgotten joys;
I want to whistle when I choose,
I want to make a noise.
Well you performed your wifely part,
Making me do the things I loathed;
But now Another has my heart—
To Liberty I am betrothed;
She may not boast a strength like
yours
To put and keep me in my place,
But she has other gentler lures,
And I prefer her face.
With her I now propose to wive,
And, if you haven't played the
game—
If, Dora, you are still alive,
Then I shall do it just the same;
Once of my life you held the keys;
Our lips in tragic hours have kissed;
For old times' sake don't force me,
please,
To be a bigamist.
O Dora, it would never do
To make yourself—and me—absurd;
Let me not have to bracket you
With CALVERLEY's immortal bird;
He knew full well, that parroquet
With the green tuft and small black
eye, -
He'd make a lovely corpse, and yet
The fowl refused to die.
Large sacrifices I have made
To execute your least decree,
Now on your honour it is laid
To do a little thing for me:
Do it, and as you pass in air
(The while I toll the “All-clear” bell)
In that new world—I won't say where-
I'll wish you joy. Farewell!

A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,--Don't be silly. Fancy
writing to demand your money back
because you've just fallen off a mule I
sold you five years ago. On my soul,
Ginger, I blush for you. -
I know I guaranteed her quiet; but
what of it? You don't judge people by
their exalted moments, do you? If on
your next visit home you dived out of
an Alhambra box into the big drum
with two chuckers-out in your embrace
and consequently spent a night in the
Wine Street caravanserai, you wouldn't
brand yourself as an habitual criminal,
would you? Of course not. Boys will
be bhoys (God bless 'em!)—especially
those of your Titian tint—and mules
will play the assoccasionally; it is their
nature to. What if she did buck you
into a syringa-tree and then roll on
you? That's nothing. Some donkeys
would have made it prickly-pear and
lunched on you afterwards.
And anyway I expect you annoyed
her. If you treat that mule reasonably,
don't interrupt her meals or drag her
out at unseemly hours or in inclement
weather, touch her with whip or spur,
jerk her mouth, hustle or shout at her,
and above all don't try to force her
where she doesn't want to go, you will
find her the most obliging little crea-
ture in Africa. If you are not man
enough to cope with her, address her
to HERTzog (or anyone else you dis-
like), stick a stamp on her and drop
her in the pillar-box. I wish to hear
no more of the matter. As for giving
you your money back, it can't be done.
I spent it on nougat ages ago.
By the way, have you ever tried that
pillar-box wheeze? I unburden my-
self of quite a lot of odds and ends that
way. Simply wrap 'em up in bits of
paper and post 'em. Who to ? Oh, any.

for his Unnatural History Museum.
You know Miss Birdie de Maie (née
Emily Potts), of the Frivolity Theatre,
don't you? My dear chap, you can't
peruse a single dentifrice advertisement
without seeing her rows of ivory leap-
ing at you like those stuffed trophies
of the chase in the taxidermist's in
Piccadilly. She has the finest teeth
in England, as I happen to know, for
I have the acquaintance of the fellow
that made 'em. Well, Birdie gets all
my old tooth-brushes. If you can't
think of anybody to enrich off-hand

a friendly hint either to dry up or cut
his throat.
Again, what have we on hand? An
ancient dancing pump?. Once more the

pleasure that the Cadwallers of “Villa
Bordighera,” Balham, have been pre-
sented “with the gift of a son, Hubert

injecting mingled }% and surprise into
scores of deserving British homes.
Yes, old Sir Pompey was married a
week or so ago (a trifle late in the day, I
should say—wanted somebody to “close

I got a cream-and-gold invitation to

shouldn't mention my name if I were

have become a proud god-father lately
(Charles's—a filly), and, thinking it was
up to me to do the thing properly, I
went to the Stores and ordered a bas-
sinette to be sent to the god-daughter.
I was worried and mentally dishevelled
at the time (country stiff with frost,
horses puffing up and eating their heads
off with hay at a thousand pounds a
ton) and seemed to have mixed my
orders somewhat. Anyhow, a couple
of days later I got a note from Charles
saying his daughter (aged one month)
was simply delighted with her whisky
decanter.

Mother. “WHERE IS THE PAIN, DARLING 2 "
Mabel (with dignity). “IN
THE PROPER PLACE, OF COURSE.”
THE NEW CALIGRAPHY.
FROM a pilot in the R.A.F., riding
the wind and bombarding the unchar-
itable Hun with cunningly contrived
bombs, to a peaceful organiser of bene-
factions raising the wind by bombard-
ing the charitable with, I trust, no less
cunningly contrived appeals is as one
might say, a distinct come-down.
I only mention this biographical de-
tail because, had it not been for a
dormant craving for something more
exciting than the daily task, I might
have failed to follow up the trifling in-
cident through which I am now en-
abled to announce a discovery which
marks an epoch in the artistic and
literary history of the world.
It was while endeavouring to intro-
due an element of sport into the perusal
of the morning's mail, by trying to
guess the amount of the enclosure from
the handwriting on the envelope, that
I found, among the replies to a rather
moving appeal for the provision of
night-classes for those who have re-
ceived a Public School education, a
communication couched in characters
that conveyed no meaning whatsoever
to the combined intellects of myself, my
typist and the office-boy.
The letter, if such it may be called,
was headed by an address in Chelsea,
and occupied about twelve lines. It
began with a few graceful but meaning-
less flourishes, followed by what looked
like a mass of cobwebs; then came a
collection of strange objects, one of
which might have been a broken mahl-
stick, some drooping curves and pot-
hooks, a few meagre and attenuated
strokes and globules, and finally, where
one would expect to find the signature,
a peculiar design distantly resembling
a conventional rose.
I determined to visit this eccentric
scribe and learn from his lips the
message that his pen had so signally
failed to convey.
In due course I found myself in the
presence of my correspondent, whose
appearance and the studio he occupied
were indicative of the highest and
most recent developments of Twentieth-
Century Art.
“I was strangely moved by your
appeal,” he exclaimed, on learning the
purpose of my visit, “and, although not
at the moment in a position to sub-
scribe, I thought I would express to
you my contempt for the hopelessly
antiquated curriculum and barbarous
neglect of Art existing to-day in our
schools.
“I see,” he continued, “that you are
still bound to the old laborious letter-
by-letter method of reading. Listen,
and I will expound to you the New
Caligraphy, whereby the pen, no longer
hampered by the intolerable limitations
of a formal alphabet, regains its long-
lost liberty of expression.
“My temperament has always chafed
under the task of laboriously arranging
our unsightly signs into the few con-
ventional phrases necessary for modern
social requirements, although I had
long since resolved such phrases into
single coups-de-plume, decipherable to
anyone gifted with a little patience,
imagination and sense of contour.
“At length I conceived the idea of
abandoning all pretence of legibility, in
your meaning of the term, in favour of
a direct linear and pictorial appeal to
the emotions.”
“In short,” I ventured, “you became
a caligraphical post-Impressionist or
literary Worticist.”
“Precisely,” he agreed. “Now here
[taking some sheets from a drawer] are
some specimen letters designed to meet
the more frequent occasions for corre-
spondence. Accepting an invitation.

by those flourishes in the opening lines,

followed by the gratitude mutely yet

eloquently conveyed by those uplifted
pot-hooks. Could anyone interpret
that as a refusal?
“Now mark the subtle atmosphere
of negation in this refusal, the droop-
ing melancholy of the commencement,
gradually stiffening into the unmistak-
able non-possumus of these spiky un-
compromising uprights. Here,” con-
tinued the pedantic voice, in the manner
of a demonstrator in anatomy, “we
have an invitation, on my part, to
dinner. Could you misinterpret the
seductive entreaty of these gracious
lines—hope, desire, expectation in every
curve, the very pot-hooks subtly camou-
flaged as notes of interrogation ? And
see the suggestion of grapes and a cor-
nucopia obviously raising hopes of
champagne and repletion.
“Look,” cried the Vorticist, his face
alight with enthusiasm and pride, “at
this masterpiece of Neo-caligraphy—
a snub to an undesired acquaintance.
Could anything be more frigidly aloof
than these thin, hard, pointed symbols,
never relaxing into a friendly curve or
the careless abandon of a flourish, every
stroke retroussé—disdain in diagram 2

sable glaciers. I really pity the wretch
who receives it.
“Now before you go,” he concluded,
handing me the last of his specimens,
“let me have the satisfaction of hear-
ing your interpretation of this charac-
teristic example of my art.”
That which met my startled gaze
resembled nothing so much as a battle-
field a few minutes after zero. Serried
clusters of spikes like bayonets led
the eye to a series of appalling explo-
sions, ranging from whizzbangs to Big
Berthas. The climax must have ab-
sorbed fully half a bottle of ink. A
platoon of enraged porcupines, goaded
to madness by a halo of forked light-
ning, seemed to have encountered a
belt of uncut chevaux-de-frise. One
last terrific ink-burstended this amazing
piece of penmanship, save for the usual
rose.
“I should certainly regard such a
thing as a declaration of war,” was my
verdict, “and I should be strongly dis-
posed to reply by direct action.”
“Direct action,” he repeated; “I don't
quite follow.”
“I mean,” said I, “that I should
-dispense with the antiquated paper and
post-box business, put my ink into a
syringe and substitute the writer for
note-paper.”
“Your suggestion is not without
merit,” said the Vorticist, “as a last
resort when dealing with a being of
inferior culture, such as my landlord;

facsimile of my reply to a fellow-painter

who with misplaced buffoonery pro-

“Do not assume, however, that I
employ my art only on those of my

to address a rather powerful design

fellow has not ventured to write to me

materialistic sort of man, and was
grasping a crumpled letter.

Small Boy (fascinated by milking process). “Now PUT IT ALL BACK AND Do IT AGAIN.”
MILLY AND THE GAS-MASK.
Now that the Censor is no longer
seen in the land the little story of Milly
and the Gas-mask may be told.
Milly lived in the town of Houtby-
under-Boodle, which is in the Black
Country. Do not misunderstand me,
Milly was not black; only the country
was black. Milly was fair, with large
round blue eyes which looked shyly, or
rather shyly, out upon a terrifying and
yet enticing world.
Prior to the outbreak of war Milly
assisted in the manufacture of stone
ginger-beer bottles. There is not un-
limited scope for originality in this
craft, however, and Milly left it without
a pang for the greater excitement of
making munitions of war. For some
months she filled shells. But even
here individuality is hardly encouraged;
each shell must have the same filling
as its neighbour, and Milly was glad
enough to transfer her activities to the
novel industry of finishing gas-masks.
Here indeed was work after her heart.
If the gas-masks did not (or should not)
vary very much from one another, the
wearers would. To every mask a
soldier! The thought stirred her heart.
More, it stirred her pen. Yes, she wrote
a little note. It ran–
“DEAR SoLDIER,--I hope this mask
will save your life.
With love from MILLY.
7, Brick Lane, Houtby-under-Boodle.”
She slipped it into a gas-mask when
the forewoman was not looking, and
spent the rest of the day with a face
sc hotly suffused that a fellow-worker
asked if she had a fever.
The scene here changes. We find
ourselves in Flanders, somewhere be-
hind the line, where a new draft is
being initiated into the ritual of gas-
mask drill. They have at length suc-
ceeded in adjusting their masks satis-
factorily when signs of distress are
observable in Private Punnett, who,
after violent contortions, drags off his
mask and exhibits a purple face and
starting eyes.
“Who told you to take it off?” roars
the Sergeant. -
“I couldn't breeve,” replies the in-
dignant Punnett. “Pretty well done
in, I was.”
“Here, let's see,” says the Sergeant.
Then, “Yes, there's something in the
pipe. What the ...? ‘DEAR SoLDIER,
—I hope this mask will save your
-
life. With love from . . .” No laughing
in the ranks! Prepare to take off. . .
Masks / ''
“. . . . will save yer life,’” grumbled
Private Punnett that evening for the
twentieth time. “And jolly nigh lost it
for me. “Love from Milly,' indeed! My
loving Sarah and five kids is enough
for me. An' you needn't mention this
at home, Sam. The old girl mightn't
understand.”
Alas ! that our romance should end
thus. And what of Milly, you will ask,
shyly waiting and hoping in Houtby-
under-Boodle? Ah, well, we need not,
after all, waste too much pity there.
For soon after the Armistice a fine
stalwart Houtby-under-Boodler, late of
the 14th Loyal Blackshire Regiment,
came and carried off Milly. She likes
to think that the gas-mask which saved
him was actually the one into which
she slipped her little note, for a little
note, as she truly says, may so easily
be displaced.

Gallery. Lord Astor occupied a seat in the

(Modelled on a recent advertisement.)
PARENTS 1
Do you wish to win your children's
respect? Do you aspire to wear the
halo of omniscience? Can you answer
the every-day questions that puzzle
their untutor d minds 2
WHAT Do You say when THEY AsK You
• Why is water wet 2

Do fishes ever catch cold 2

Why do bubbles burst 2
Why doesn't Uncle Montague burst 2
Can you at once give the correct answer
to these vital questions? Or have you
any handy book of reference to which
you can immediately fly?
You will find them all answered in
THE PARENTs' FIRST-A1D LIBRARY.
Do not fall into the foolish error of
supposing that children ask questions
primarily from a desire to annoy.
They ask because they thirst for exact
knowledge. Deny them the necessary
refreshment and you nip in the bud
the scientific spirit of inquiry that dis-
tinguishes Man from the lower animals.
Whatever impression you may convey
to the rest of the world, in your chil-
dren's eyes you are (or should be)
godlike and infallible. Are you prepared
to forfeit their simple trust and love?
Are you willing to knock yourself off
your own pedestal?
Some parents, unfortunately, cannot
answer all their children's questions
off-hand. It is for them that THE
PARENT's FIRST-AID LIBRARY has been
compiled and published in twelve
sumptuous volumes.
Suppose, for instance, you are sud-
denly asked at tea by your youngest-
born, “Why can't we see in the dark 3"
do not reply, “Eat your bun, child,”
but clap your hand to your head and
exclaim, “Tut, tut, I've left my pocket-
handkerchief (or my digestive-tablets)
upstairs.” You then rush into the
study, feverishly revolve the handsome
fumed - oak bookcase in which THE
PARENT's FIRST-AID LIBRARY is housed,
and stop it at Vol. VIII. (oki-PoRI).
Turn up the fascinating article on
“Optics,” and there you will find all
(and more than) you want to know.
On your return to the tea-table you os-
tentatiously flourish the alleged missing
article and casually remark, “Now, let
me see, Clarence, you were inquiring
why we cannot see in the dark. The
reason is, my boy, that the interposition

of light and the retina of the eye mili-
tates in a greater or less measure, ac-
cording to the degree of obfuscation,
against the formation of clear images
which, by a process of reflection, pro-
duce the static condition we are accus-
tomed to call sight. And now it's time
you went to bed.” An answer like that
will encourage Clarence to come to you
again for information.
No question has yet been asked or
conceived out of the bland innocence of
the youthful mind that is not answered
in these priceless pages. The simple
yet arresting language in which the
articles are written brings them within
the range of the fattest parental head.
“FATHER of TEN’’ writes:—“Since
purchasing THE PARENT's FIRST-AID
LIBRARY I have put on flesh.”
THE REv. SEPTIMUs DoDDER writes:—
“My children now regard me with
something akin to awe.”
“HARAssed MINER's WIFE” writes:—
“Willie knows better now I’ve learned
him.”

CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
I NEVER seem to get the right sort
of Christmas present for my menfolk.
They don't complain, of course, but
they regard my offerings with a sort of
forced gaiety of manner, an ebullition
of gratitude which does not ring true.
Why do I always choose the wrong
thing 2 Because at Christmas time the
hand of man is against me. Let me
give you an example of my unhappy
experiences at this season.
I go into an establishment dedicated
to men's wear—not without trepidation,
for we are just as shy, O men, of enter-
ing one of your shops as you are of
appearing in ours.
“I want to buy a present for a man,”
I confide to the rather nice-looking
youth behind the counter.
“Certainly, Madam. This is the de-
partment for woven underwear. What
can I show you?" he asks, fingering a
bifurcated garment.
I blush—isn't it silly of me?—and
dive to another counter. I am received
by a grave pompous man.
“I want a present for my husband—
will you please suggest something?” I
say pleadingly.
Now if that assistant had not a heart
of stone, if he had any trace of humanity,
or even the faintest spark of pity for me
in my dilemma, he would at once tell
me the sort of thing men require; but
no, he is hard, inexorable, adamant.
“Here is the very thing,” he says
with a Machiavellian smile, “our hand-
somely fitted all-leather stud case,
37s.6d., containing a stud for every
day in the year and obviating the daily
annoyance of lost studs. I should
strongly advise this.”
He advises it, you see; yet that
assistant, away from his counter, may
be a humane man; he may be full of
the milk of human kindness, an amiable
father, a conscientious husband. “No
gentleman can do without it,” he adds
emphatically.
“It seems too much like encourag-
ing a bad habit,” I protest. “Can you
suggest something more useful ?”
“Certainly, Madam. A box of ties
of various shades and suitable for every
occasion. The gentleman has quiet
tastes, I presume 2" º
I wonder if he presumes that by
looking at me. “Not too quiet,” I
correct.
“Then these are the very newest
designs, Madam.”
I start back in dismay. “But he's
not so noisy as that. Haven't you
something less—resonant 2"
“But I can assure you that these
Futurist ties are the very latest note in
men's wear. Everyone is getting them ;
they've been so much in demand that
this is the last box I have left . . . "
This and many other things he says,
which lead me to believe that he is a
supreme judge of the tastes of his own
sex. And later I must witness Henry's
silent agony, confronted by Futurist
ties and unable to cry out, but striving
to find the proper words in thanks.
Of course it isn't only the male
shop assistant who so vilely ſails in
his common obligations. I remember
standing at a counter in one of our
big stores when a youth came in and
addressed the nearest female assistant
with a pitiful air of bravado. “I say, you
know, I want a present for a young lady,”
he said. “You’ll be able to tell me the
sort of thing girls like, won't you?”
There are thousands of things in
shops, young men, that girls like. To
name the most ordinary and obvious
items we like boxes of gloves, vanity
bags, fans, those big bottles of Eau de
Cologne, silk stockings—why, we sim-
ply can't have enough silk stockings.
If you gave them to us on every kind
of anniversary throughout the year we
should not have had our fill of them or
ever complain of monotony. The girl
behind the counter was, of course, per-
fectly aware of this, yet she remarked
with disarming affability, “I should
certainly advise you to give her a silk
Maltese lace handkerchief. These at two
guineas each are extremely handsome.”
Now I have nothing to say against
silk Maltese lace handkerchiefs. It is
true that they offer no scope for wiping
the nose on them ; they cannot be
tucked in the corsage as an embellish-
ment (except by the heroine of a story
written by a man) because that idea has
long gone out of fashion; you cannot
convert them into d'oyleys or lamp-
shades. Of course, if you had everything
in the world you could possibly desire
and the Slave of the Lamp was hanging
about waiting for something to do, you
might command him, “Bring hither
silk Maltese lace handkerchiefs,” but as
a present for the average girl—well, it's
the sort of thing that would embitter
her at once.
The young man wavered. “It isn't
much to look at for two guineas, but if
you're sure she'd like it more than
anything else. Of course you ought to
know.”
Even at the eleventh hour the assist-
ant did not relent; pitiless, remorseless,
in her heart “no chinks where love
may enter in,” she coerced that young
man into flinging away two guineas.
I pictured the poor girl who was to
receive the gift sobbing her heart out on
Christmas day and stamping on the
Maltese lace handkerchief in her fury.
It might even have led to a broken
engagement. Such things do happen.
I recall that the coolness and ultimate
estrangement that sprang up between
my brother and a girl who would have
made him an excellent wife began from
the day she sent him an embroidered
tie-holder. It was such a nice one too,
and when the ribbons were fastened at
both ends kept the ties beautifully flat.
I'm sure I don't know why he got so
enraged about it. -
So I think it will be better to give
Henry a cheque this year. Let me see
—really nice silk stockings cost a
guinea a pair. Suppose I give him a
cheque for three guineas and leave the
idea to sink into his brain . . .
He knows I always like three pairs at
a time.
COLD COMFORT.
(An eminent Frenchman is of opinion
that microbes can live for some thou-
sands of years.)
Joys fail and life loses its savour,
Food thrills me no more as of old,
Tobacco is reft of its flavour,
And, nursing my annual cold,
For solace I seek the professor's
Deductions, which tend to confirm
The hope that perhaps my oppressor's
No parvenu germ.

You PLAYED A WRONG NOTE.
BRIDGE NOTES.
THE Caution Bridge Club has been
formed at Little Poppleton to help
those who have reached a certain pro-
ficiency in Bridge and are interested in
the problems that so often present
themselves. Beginners are especially
encouraged to send in their difficulties
or anything likely to be of general
interest.
The following are some of the points
that have already been raised and the
decisions arrived at by the Committee:
(1) M. (or N.) was asked to teach
three beginners. He explained the
rudiments of the game during dinner,
and afterwards they found an old
pack and began to play. The dealer,
seeing a number of picture-cards in his
hand, went, as he had been advised,
one No-trump. The next two passed.
M. (or N.), who had dined very well,
thought he had a hand in which every
card was a picture, but wasn't sure, so
passed. The declarer led off with Mrs.
Bun, the baker's wife; the second hand,
waiving his right to the lead, took it
with Mr. Bun, the baker; the declarer's
partner discarded Master Chips, the
carpenter's son; M. (or N.) had no
Buns. What (under the circumstances)
should he do?
Decision.—Whatever the cards in
M.'s (or N.'s) hand he should now (and
for ever) discard Mr. Bung the brewer.
(2) Score, game all. Time, 3 A.M.
A. deals and goes one Heart; Y. goes
two Diamonds; B., who stutters and
plays indifferently, after a few minutes
is found to have gone two Hearts; and
then Z. is found to have gone to bed.
Is this better than two Hearts?
Decision.—Infinitely.
(3) (Four beginners). Towards the
end of a hand B. gathers up his trick
containing the four top honours in
trumps and puts it into his own hand
instead of on the pile of tricks. He
then plays these honours from his hand
(without being noticed at the time), and
of course finishes up with four extra
cards (all of low value). What should
he do?
Decision.—If he has lost his contract
he should quickly claim a misdeal;
otherwise deal the four, face downwards,
one to each player.
(4) Mr. and Mrs. A. are playing with
Mr. and Mrs. B. In the course of the
game Mrs. B. is in doubt how to play
and gives two alternative cards to Bid-
dles, her Pekinese, saying she would
play the one the dear little fellow
kissed. He kissed the right one. Can
Mr. and Mrs. A. claim a penalty 2
Decision.—A player may (with gen-
eral consent) refer to a bystander who
professes himself uninterested in the
game (as Biddles doubtless was) a dis-
puted question of facts, but not of
actual play. The A.'s could thus claim
to make Biddles pay any money lost
on the rubber.
“My personal belief is that the contest will
not last more than six months—in fact, I feel
inclined to say not more than four—and that
the Englishman will emerge from it Heavy-
Weight Boxing Champion of Europe.”
Provincial Paper.
The prophet is now comforting himself
with the reflection that, though he was
wrong about the man, he was well
within the mark regarding the time. .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 1st.—Some thirty-
five years ago Mr. LINLEY SAMBOURNE
gave the readers of Punch his concep-
tion of the advent of the first lady
Member of Parliament. Happily the
reality was very different from the
dream. Lady ASToR, demurely but
daintily garbed in a black dress with
white collarette (the lady reporters who
simultaneously appeared in the Press
Gallery are my authority for this de-
tail), was the very antithesis of the bla-
tant and “bloomered” female of the car-
toonist's imagination.
Convoyed by the PRIME
MINISTER and Mr. BALFOUR,
proud but a little flustered
at having such a precious
cargo under their protec-
tion, the new - comer ad-
vanced to the Table, where
the Clerk of the House re-
ceived her with an extra-
low bow (he should now be
dubbed Sir “Courtly " IL-
BERT), took the oath, added
to the Roll its first feminine
signature, had a moment's
conversation with the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
(who gallantly doffed his
usually inseparable hat), and
then shook hands with the
SPEAKER, who, to judge by
the warmth of his welcome,
was not at all displeased at
the addition to his respon-
sibilities involved in her
arrival.
It even tinged with ro-
mance the sordid details of
finance. Mr. BottomLEY,
leading a forlorn hope
against the pundits of the
Treasury, assured the House
that Premium Bonds were
much less of a gamble than the Bonds
of Matrimony, in which not every
feminine investor was so fortunate as
to draw “a splendid husband, with the
reversion of a seat in this House.”
This obvious bid for the new Member's
vote was not left unchallenged. Mr.
LYNN promptly topped it with the ex-
pression of his hope that on such a day,
“when we have put youth at the helm
and beauty at the prow,” the House
was not going to take a retrograde step
in the direction of lotteries.
The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer,
who admitted that he had exercised the
feminine privilege of changing his mind
on the subject, denounced Premium
Bonds with all the zeal of a pervert,
and, although the Government Whips
were not on, succeeded in taking into
the Lobby with him the bulk of the
House, including its new lady-Member.
Premium Bonds were down and out
by 276 votes to 84. I fancy if their
supporters had told the House more
about bankers and less about bishops
the voting would have been a good deal
closer.
Tuesday, December 2nd.—Chivalry
not being entirely defunct even in the
House of Commons, Lady ASTOR is
apparently to be left in undisputed
possession of the coveted corner-seat
below the Gangway formerly occupied
by Mr. T. M. HEALY. She sat with
exemplary patience through a more
than usually dull Question-hour. Her

later experiences were more exciting.
She incurred a gentle reproof from Mr.
WHITLEY for indulging in casual con-
versation during a Division, and after-
wards, on essaying to leave the House,
found her way barred by that most
vigilant of Whips, Mr. TowyN Jones.
Happily the Father of the House (Mr.
T. P. O'Connor) came to the assistance
of its Mother, and chivalrously offered
her a pair.
Mr. Hogg|E protested against the
business of the House of Commons
being interfered with by a chess-match
upstairs, and darkly hinted that this
was a device of the Government to
burke discussion of the Scotch Land
Settlement Bill. Mr. BonAR LAw as-
sured him that no such slight to Scot-
land was intended, and then, with most
of the other Members, adjourned to

- | ſh. º
Committee Room 14, where Señor CAPA-
BLANCA, the most accomplished “wood-
shifter" of the age, disposed of thirty-
six out of his thirty-eight opponents in
double-quick time.
Wednesday, December 3rd. — The
Lords spent a rather depressing hour
over the industrial situation. Every-
one deplored the prevailing unrest, but
no one seemed furnished with a sure
remedy. Lord IsIINGTON thought that
Whitley Councils might solve the pro-
blem, provided that their decisions
were made binding. Lord AskwitH
feared there was no chance of these
councils being generally appointed so
long as workers could run
to Downing Street and get
what they wanted there.
He was for compelling
everyone, masters and men
alike, to belong to a union
or association before being
allowed to take part in a
trade—a pleasant prospect
for those who still cherish
old - fashioned notions of
freedom. Yet even Lord
SALISBURY made no protest.
So far all was gloom.
But sparks flew when the
Electricity Bill came up
for Second Reading. Lord
MoULTON delivered a slash-
ing attack upon the whole
principle of the measure,
declaring that it would “not
only nationalise the indus-
try, but bureaucratise it.”
The Lord CHANCELLoR was
as much shocked as if he had
stumbled on a live-wire, and
hastily moved the adjourn-
ment of the debate in order
that he might get up his
-brief for the defence.
Just before his retire-
ment from the Air Ministry
General SEELY announced with pride
that a single aeroplane had averted a
war on the North-West Frontier. That
method of peace-making is hardly likely
to be successful in the future, for, in
reply to Lieutenant-Commander KEN-
wor THY, Mr. Most AGU stated that it
was the practice to warn the enemy
whenever a raid was intended. This,
ostensibly in the interests of women
and children; but, as Sir John REEs
intelligently observed, “How long are
the combatants likely to wait after the
warning has been given 2"
Much sympathy was evoked by Col-
onel AsHLEY's complaint that a wine-
merchant was still forbidden to deliver
his precious goods except for cash down.
Sir C. KINLoch-CookE pointed out the
inconvenience thus caused to people'
who might wish to give presents to

their invalid friends. Judging by the
cheers with which his remark was re-
ceived, a number of Members would
gladly practise this form of benevo-
lence, even if their charity began at
home.
Debate on the Government of India
Bill was chiefly confined to the experts.
Fortunately for the Minister in charge
their criticisms often cancelled one
another. Thus, when Colonel YATE
moved an amendment designed to get
rid of the “ diarchy,” Sir H. CRAIK
promptly declared that the amendment
would itself introduce that mysterious
constitutional disease in its worst form.
Similarly an amendment moved from
the Labour benches in favour of hand-
ing over more powers to popular ad-
ministration received its most effective
criticism from Mr. John WARD, who
pointed out that sanitation had no
meaning for the Eastern mind, and
that the passage of the amendment
would be fatal to decent Labour condi-
tions in India.

to nod, I suppose. It is this, no doubt,
and not the delay-action methods of the
United States Senate, which is causing
the Dove of Peace to be so long on its
way.
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE ploughed con-
scientiously through the sixty or seventy
Questions addressed to him without
giving a vast amount of information.
We learned, however, that there was a
good deal of agitation in the Georgian
Republic. That this unrest is likely to
to extend to other Georgians, not of the
Caucasus, was apparent when, a few
minutes later, the PRIME MINISTER
informed an astonished House that,
having regard to the heavy labours of
the past Session, the Government had
decided to give Members a substantial
holiday. Parliament would therefore
be prorogued before Christmas, instead
of being adjourned, and to this end a
| large part of the legislative programme
would be sacrificed or carried over by
special resolution into the new Session.
Among the measures thus to be placed
in “cold storage” are the Government
of Ireland Bill and the Anti-Dumping
Bill.
According to the PRIME MINISTER's
time-table only one day was left un-
appropriated between now and the end
of the Session. Mr. DEVLIN promptly
collared half of it for a debate on the
alleged sufferings of Chaplain O'Don-
NELL at the hands of the military
authorities. It was a sheer waste
of time. Mr. DEvDIN blustered, Mr.
CHURCHILL was rigidly “official,” and
the motion was ultimately talked out

Mr. MonTAGU's refusal to insert a
provision for woman's suffrage in the
Government of India Bill, on the ground
that it was a matter for the Indians to
decide for themselves, gave Lady Astor
a chance of making her first interposi-
tion in debate. “But,” she objected,
“it is to be decided by Indian men.”
The Minister had, however, the last
word, and the amendment was defeated.

THE NEW DISPENSATION.
MR. MoRTAGU ExPounds THE LAW.
A NORTH-WEST FRONTIER SENTRY.
“THE 200th have asked us out to
dinner,” said Cuthbert, just as the
crack of a rifle told us that Percy the
Pathan had started his almost nightly
attempt to extinguish the Mess lamp.
Percy is a gentleman who leads a
double life. By day, his countenance
shining with friendliness and loyalty,
he comes into camp to sell goats to the
Army and profiteers disgracefully over
the deal. By night he sits on a hill-
side, disguised as a lump of rock, and
does target practice in the direction of
our Mess tent.
His cousin, Alfred the Afridi, keeps
the mules amused at the opposite end
of the camp by dropping lead from a
‘500 Express into their lines. This
gives them a legitimate excuse for
stampeding—a performance which our
long-eared friends rightly consider the
finest joke in their extensive répertoire.
“Though I am very partial to din-
ing out,” I said, “and am not a little
tired of the efforts of our Perce, I
daren't do it.”
“Why daren't you?”
“Cuthbert,” I said, “I fear no foe
in the shape of “friendly' tribesmen;
but we are the only British unit in
this camp. Each native unit mounts
several guards. Each guard posts
several sentries. And, completely ignor-
ant as I am of our Indian brethren's
customs and language, it's as much as
my life's worth to stir from our own
area after dark. I should be shot before
I'd gone ten yards.”
Cuthbert, however, was confident
that he knew the mysteries of a sepoy's
challenge.
“The sentry,” he explained, “shouts
‘Halt' You can give any reply that
enters your head. ‘Friend' is a good
word, but any other will do as well.
The sentry, unwilling to display his
total ignorance of the English lan-
guage, assumes that you are all right,
and answers, “Pass, frien', alliswel,’
using the only English words that he
knows, and he doesn't know the mean-
ing of those.”
“It sounds quite easy,” I said, con-
siderably reassured.
We therefore licked our paws, wiped
some of the dust off our faces and set
off towards the 200th.
All went well and strictly according
to Cuthbert's description until we were
more than half-way home, having spent
a very pleasant evening. Suddenly a
man leapt at us from behind a tent.
“Hol-tad-van-spass!” he shouted.
“Cuthbert,” I said, as we both
halted very suddenly, “the fellow is de-
manding an impossibility. What shall
we do?”

“Something pretty quickly,” replied
Cuthbert ; “the blighter has come to

“I’ve got it,” I cried; “I’ll halt,
and you do the advance and pass. It's
the only way we can obey his com-
mand.”
“No,” said Cuthbert, “you advance.
I'm much better at halting than you.”
I greatly wished to remind Cuthbert
that he, not I, was supposed to know
all about the Sepoy's habits, but I
realized that this was no place for
argument, which could only lead to
disaster. I therefore advanced, trem-
bling with fear. Scarcely a yard for-

and I lurched almost it seemed on to

Granted that the artistic soul of the
cornet of the Palais de Cinéma required

he should rehearse the slow movement
from the incidental music of “The
Bride of the Prairie" at midnight.
M'sieur Bonneton and the Sergeant-
Major, meeting on the stairs after a
night disturbed by devastating min-
strelsy, discussed the matter.
“It's not meself that minds music in
its proper place,” said Coghlan. “But

that the Bonnetons, who were the

under the impression that he had re-
turned. Repeated knockings led to the
appearance of M'sieur instriped pyjamas
and an unamiable mood. M'sieur's tem-

the tiny Palais de Cinéma

could feel isolated in a house
possessing the acoustic and
olfactory properties of 10

rez de chaussée indulged in
one of their diurnal dis-
putes, Peggy could gauge

Thenceforth the Arctic
regions could give the at-
mosphere of the staircase
of 10 bis an impression of
warmth. The popping of
Hippolyte's corks was an
exasperation, the smell of
Peggy's onions a studied in-
sult, and the domestic dis-
putes on the ground-floor
an indication of M'sieur's
malevolent temper. Peggy
in her loneliness sighed for
the amenities and common

incidents are common in
Petiteville, owing to a short-
the exact moment when
M'sieur's white heat of wrath would
dissolve into tears of forgiveness and
reconciliation. When Peggy was pre-
paring a savoury dish of steak and
onions Madame Bonneton's sensitive
nose told her the precise minu e when
it was done to a turn. And when Hip-
polyte on the deurième étage was con-
strained to recruit exhausted nature
the drawing of the cork sounded like a
popgun throughout the house. These
things made for comradeship. To smell
your neighbour's dinner is a sure link
of sympathy.
So all was concord and amity at

of the ground floor and the premier
étage began to find cause for complaint
in the habits of their fellow-lodger.

us remonstrate.”
Unhappily Hippolyte proved very
touchy on the subject of his nocturnal
melody-making. He could quite under-
stand, he said, that M'sieur Bonneton's
material mind could not soar above
corporeal considerations of cabbages
and chicory, but he thought that the
gallant representative of the Chasseurs
des Lapins (luckily Coghlan had not
sufficient French to understand the
gibe) ought to appreciate martial music.
He announced his intention, if need be,
of blowing the last breath of his body
into his beloved cornet at any hour he
pleased, and the discomfited deputation
withdrew.
Unfortunately another discord dis-

But a fortnight's constant supply had
lulled them into a false sense of se-
curity, and this occasion found Madame
Bonneton without a reserve stock of
fuel and Peggy's ménage void of candles
and water.
To Hippolyte a lack of light and fuel
was a trifle, but his consuming woe
was that he had been late on the tabac
queue and had not a cigarette in the
world.

band on his return, “we have the rous-

the scent of it goaded Hippolyte to dis-

LAW AND LETTERS.
El ForTs to brighten the proceedings
in our Courts of Justice have been inter-
mittently made of late years, and we
note with great satisfaction the new and
admirable example set by Mr. Justice
SHEARMAN last week. “At the sitting
of the Court,” so we read in the Law
Report of The Times for December 2nd,
“His Lordship referred to his comment
on the petitioner's habit of saying ‘one’
for ‘I,’ and said that the character in
Dickens, whom he mentioned on Fri-
day as having used the word in the
same way, was Mrs. Prig, when she
and Mrs. Gamp had tea together.”
"Anything that can draw Law and
Letters more closely together is cordially
to be welcomed, and we look forward
confidently to further developments on
the lines which, with the exercise of a
little intelligent anticipation, we have
endeavoured to forecast in the following
report:—
At the sitting of the Court Mr. Justice
Starling said that he wished to make a
personal statement. During the course
of a case tried before him last week he
had indulged in an obiter dictum on the
new planet which had swum into the
ken of politics. As he put it, they had
just witnessed the appearance of an
Astoral body on the Parliamentary
plane. He regretted to say that the
phrase had been shockingly mutilated
in its transference to print. One paper
had credited him with the inane remark
that pastoral bodies had appeared on
the Parliamentary plain. Others had
passed over the observation altogether,
an even greater outrage. The com-
ment, in view of the ever - increasing
interest in psychics, was topical, legiti-
mate and opportune. Moreover he
had to bear in mind the prestige of
his Court as the home of mirth. This
prestige was very precious to him.
There were occasions on which it was
the duty of a judge to prefer levity to
law, to be merry as well as wise. If
Apollo could unbend, why not Rhada-
manthus 2 He was well aware that
the papers would probably say “Rhodo-
dendron,” but let that pass. As long
as he sat in this Court he would
never have the gallery cleared for
laughter at remarks from the Bench.
To applaud counsel was a very different
matter and could not be tolerated.
There was an excellent proverb which
told us that one man might steal a
horse, but another might not look over
the hedge. Proverbs were the distilled
wisdom of the ages, and this one em-
phasized the truth that greatness had
its privileges as well as its duties.
In this context he thought it desirable
to refer to the criticisms of a poem of
his which had recently been quoted by
a counsel who appeared before him.
There seemed to be an extraordinary
notion afloat that Judges should never
cultivate the Muse; that there was
always fallacy in poetry. From this in-
human creed he profoundly dissented.
A large number of quite rational people
believed that SHAKSPEARE was the
pseudonym of a Lord Chancellor, and
the belief in poetic justice was wide-
spread and ineradicable. It would be
unseemly for him to pass judgment on
his own poems, but he begged them
not to accept the piece quoted as his
supreme achievement in verse. In order
to enable them to form a truer estimate
of his quality he proposed to read them
several of his lighter efforts.
The recital, which occupied the re-
mainder of the sitting, was a great
success. Two poems were encored,
and a policeman rendered first aid to a
prominent Junior who was suddenly
attacked by convulsive hysteries. Just
before the hearing was adjourned Mr.
Justice Starling said that he wished to
correct a slight mistake he had made
on the previous day in attributing the
saying, “Let us ail be happy and live
within our means, even if we have to
borrow the money to do it with,” to
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD. It should, of
course, have been ARTEMUs of that ilk.
EINSTEINIZED.
I HAD been reading Dr. EINSTEIN's
article in the morning paper, and the
train (as I deduced by an analytical
mental process), apparently in disproof
of the theory of perpetual motion, was
retarding relatively to the platform.
The station was teeming with moving
mass points and my mind was alive
with science as I propelled the door
outwards.
Grasping my bag I flew into space.
Arriving at a fixed point and acceler-
ating my speed through a system of co-
ordinates in a high state of motion, I
followed the deviation of light rays to
the end of the spectrum, and deposited
my bag in the place for inert and heavy
masses. Satisfied with my calcula-
tions I placed myselſ in stable rotation,
when unfortunately, while theorising, I
collided with an immovable object.
He opened up a whole string of new
theories.

on my basal principle.

THEY told us the German spy in fiction had perished,
worked to death; and I, who have a depraved taste in such
matters, dropped him a tear of gratitude and farewell. And
now here is Miss ELIZABETH Robins bringing out a new
novel, The Messenger (Hodder. AND Stoughton), with no
fewer than three of them in the first chapter. An odd, con-
tradictory and perplexing novel it is too; in places very well
written, containing several excellent little sketches of
character and one admirable full-length portrait (all as
one might expect from an artist like Miss Robins), but
wasted on a plot of such nightmare melodrama that I kept
on thinking to myself, “It surely must be a parody!" Of
course the spies were to blame. Never did you picture such
a crew. Led by a super-intriguer, one Greta von Schwarzen-
berg, governess in surely the most unsuspicious family ever
imagined, the things they did in the way of secret writing,
gold-hoarding, craft, cunning and concealment, simply stag.
ger belief—mine, anyhow. First, the family—a Cabinet
Minister's (shame!)—are found living on the Scotch coast;
and when, on a boating expedition, they propose to land
on the island where her assistants have just established a
“secret” wireless, over goes Greta into the sea in a faked
accident to prevent the landing. I mention this to show
you the kind of worker she was—having no space to tell
how the police raided her room (by this time the obliging
family had moved to the East Coast) or any of her sub-
sequent adventures, which include an interview at the White
House. Really, but for a touch of grimness in the end
and the study, mentioned above, of Julian, the pacifist,
it would remain impossible not to believe that the author of
The Magnetic North was writing this nonsense with her
tongue in her cheek . . . As it is I give up.
It may more than once have chanced to you, in the midst
of the rough-and-tumble of a “GEoRGE A. BIRMINGHAM "
farce, to have marked the revelation of some specially
shrewd insight into Irish affairs. Therefore it is hardly
astonishing that the author should now have chosen to
collect his inside knowledge into a book, not of fiction but
of facts. An Irishman looks at his World (HoddBR AND
StoughTon) is information undiluted, save with a dash of
wit; to read it is, especially for the Saxon, to gain a mass
of first-hand information in an admirably palatable form.
The new parties in Irish political life, Religion, Culture,
Education—these are some of the themes to which the
reverend author brings the result of his experience. There
are also others, notably a clever study of “the middle
classes” in town and country, involving a comparison
of social conditions in Dublin and Belfast, and a reasoned
investigation of the causes leading to the decay of the
Irish country town. Illustration of this is in the frankly
borrowed tale of the South of Ireland man who set up as a
fishmonger, but went out of business at once because people
would keep bothering him for fish Quite frankly, CANoN
HANNAY is concerned with causes rather than cures. The
reading of his book will hardly make you feel less suicidal
in a small Irish country town on a wet day, but it will at
least provide information as to the conditions precedent to
your unfortunate state. Which is always something.

The Scent Shop (HUTchINsoN) is one of those rare
achievements which will undoubtedly appeal as much to
the taste of the casual novel-reader as it does to the judg-
ment of the professional critic. Miss PEGGY WEBLING, a
delightfully accurate and acute observer of modern hu-
manity, has the gift of attracting and pleasing; I even ask
myself whether her occasional side-slips in grammar and
syntax were not put in on purpose, to satisfy the critic's
morbid craving for something to criticise. For the rest
the idea, the plot, the incidentals, the characters and the
mise-en-scène were all to my liking and revealed the expert
novelist. The idea, the art of perfume-making for the art's
own sake, was so subtly developed as to be quite fragrant
itself. The plot, the awakening of love between the per-
fume-maker and his young wife, left me as love-sick as was
Arthur Lackland, the aspiring third party who suffered in
the process. Of the many and divers incidentals I liked
most the romance of “Flash of Radium,” aristocrat of
the acrobatic world, and Maidie Cunningham, whose real
surname was Hopkins, and of whose real affections the
Major E. W. C. SANDEs is not only an engineer capable
of bridging and unbridging the Tigris with a string of boats
seven times in the space of thirteen days, and a musician
able to reconstruct The Geisha for the benefit of fellow-
captives in a Turkish prison, but he is also by way of being
an author. His book, In Kut and Captivity with the Sixth
Indian Division (MURRAY), moving as it does with the mea-
sured precision of machinery, is sometimes more business-
like than entertaining; but you may call this an advantage for
so serious a subject. Here we have the whole of the Meso-
potamian campaign set forth like a blue-book, maps, dia-
grams, appendices and all, up to the unhappy point where
General Townshend and his army of ever-glorious renown
became the “precious and honoured guests of the Ottoman
Government.” ENVER PASHA, not Major SANDEs, is re-
sponsible for the above expression, to the justice of which
our officers, in view of such tokens of affection as filthy
quarters and starvation rations, do not fully subscribe.
Yet that they found something to laugh at through siege
and imprisonment one would expect. One of them dis-
well-born R.F.C. officer
had little need and less
control. The excellence of
the mise-en-scène consists
above all in its happy and
varied contrasts; it is in-
deed marvellous that the
author should be able to
move so easily between
Mayfair and 'Ammer-
smith, the wild country and
the very modern Country
House, conveying the true
atmosphere of each and
never getting the one
mixed up with the other.
Of the characters I am
glad to be able to confirm
the publisher's view that
“all are entertaining,” and
to add a note of my own
that the ensemble is really
delightful.

In stating that Tir-
anogue (METHUEN) failed to fascinate me it is only fair
to add that I take no interest in the horse, except as a
highly unspecialised and now happily defunct medium of
locomotion. In Miss DoRo THEA. ConyERs' latest story, on
the other hand, all the characters eat, sleep, live and have
their being for, on and about horses. It is, in a word, one
of those Irish hunting stories. But I can fairly claim that
it is not prejudice on my part that causes me to withhold
my acclamation. I have read many Irish hunting stories
that aroused me to more than ordinary mirth or gripped
my unspoilt imagination. However, to be wholly fair to
the authoress of Tiranogue, I made my Irish landlady read
it. She comes from the short grass country and can pilot
a hayburner with the best of them. Her verdict coincided
with mine. There are too many people in Tiranogue all
doing something different at the same time, and you can't
remember who is in love with whom or which is the
expectant heir to what estate. As for the persons to whom
all the horses belong it would take a Tattersall to distin-
guish them. Possibly the hunting fraternity like these
little problems and find that they act as a sort of intel-
lectual stimulus between breakfast and bridge. So I recom-
mend the book to them with the assurance that if they like
horses Miss CoNYERs gives them full value.

has not made that purpose clear or I have failed to see
it. I suspect, from the title and from the fact that the
book begins and ends with a queue, that the one at the
theatre door has for him some cryptic symbolism, but as I
can't find out what it is I must regard his story as a story
only, not a fiction-coated evangel of social peace. The first
chapters left me hopeful; the last a little confused. The
heroine seems to score heavily by marrying the villain at a
registry-office and then remaining mute when he takes no
further notice of her, and in a week or two marries the hero's
sister in a church. Mr. WALLIS has failed to make it plain,
at least to me, that it wouldn't have been more sensible to
have insisted on announcing her marriage and ceasing to
live on the hero's bounty; but I am quite sure that Ruth
meant well, and so does Mr. WALLIS, and he at least should
succeed in doing well—by-and-by.

WISDOM OF A MINER PROPHET.
[The idea seems to be that, if the miners can “convert” public
opinion by argument, they are willing to dispense with “direct
i action ”; but, if they can't, Mr. SMILLIE claims the right to apply
“constitutional" compulsion.]
BEHoLD how noble is the mind of Man'
And oh, how well to exercise that feature,
Which, by Creation's nicely-ordered plan,
Hall-marks him as a reasonable creature,
So different from the beast,
Who cannot argue in the very least.
Force is the only weapon of the brute,
Being devoid of god-like understanding;
But we can biff the enemy in dispute
Simply by sweet persuasive propaganding;
Can get his views reversed
Without the need to push his face in first.
My brethren, let us then in this affair
Of nationalising coal avoid coercion ;
Go for his reason rather than his hair,
With arguments inviting his conversion,
Which anyone may read who
Runs and be brought to think the same as we do.
Let us explain, in case his heart is hard,
That force of numbers gives him no authority;
That thinking men refuse to pay regard
To verdicts given by a mere majority;
Such claims are not allowed
(Except when Labour's got the largest crowd).
But, if we fail—if still his stupid head
| Declines to have the sacred Truth inserted,
We'll freeze his hearth, we'll stop his children's bread,
We'll turn the thumb-screw till he gets converted,
And, paralysed with terror
Of constitutional methods, owns his error. O. S.
A DESERT ISLAND ROMANCE.
I NEVER had the least idea that Garrod had taken to
literature. I had always regarded him as a most respectable
In a n.
When he called to see me I guessed that it was in
connection with the vacant Chairmanship of the Greens
Committee. It may seem an unpardonable ambition on
my part, but worse men have been Chairmen of Greens
Committees, and I flatter myself that I have a unique idea
for altering the bunkers at the ninth hole.
“Old man,” he said as he sat down, “I want you to
promise to oblige me in a little matter.”
“Certainly, certainly,” I said. “Always glad to do any-
i thing in my power for you.”
| I thought this was rather artful. After pledging myself
thus even my natural modesty could not compel me to
withdraw my name from nomination.
“Well, I have been writing a little thing and I should
like your impartial opinion upon it.”
Garrod is in the tinned-fruit business. I suppose that
he would regard it as an impertinence on my part if I con-
sulted him concerning any scheme I might have for cornering
tinned pine-apples.
“It's not a play, Garrod 2" I asked faintly.
“Oh, no, not a play.”
I gasped with relief. At any rate Garrod belonged to
the small minority of righteous men who have not written
plays.
“Just a little story,” explained Garrod. “I flatter myself
it's original. A fine fellow—army officer gone to the dogs—
wild rather than wicked—is working his way home as a
stoker on a steamer. He gets into conversation with a
charming girl who is a first-class passenger.”
“Yes,” i assented. I knew that stoker. If I had any
idea that the world of fiction corresponded with the world
of fact I should ship as a stoker to-morrow to get my fill
of conversation with charming first-class passengers.
“Well, the ship is wrecked. My hero swims ashore and
finds on the beach the unconscious body of the girl. It is
a desert island, you understand.”
“I understand,” I said. Of course I understood. I have
always said that the Colonial Office ought to see that all
desert islands are provided with chaperons.
“They fall passionately in love. When finally they are
rescued they hear, on board the ship, that the hero's uncle
is dead and that he succeeds to the baronetcy and estates.”
“Ah,” I said, without committing myself more de-
finitely.
“How does the plot strike you?”
“Quaint and original,” I said boldly.
my recording angel swooned.
“Do you think I could make anything out of it?”
“One cannot promise success, Garrod, for British editors
have a certain distrust of markedly original plots. But
try by all means. Only there is not much to be made out
of literature. Hasn't it struck you as remarkable that no
literary man has been charged with profiteering? The
only stain on our caste was when a famous writer was
prosecuted for hoarding sugar. You may be successful,
Garrod, but you'd do far better if you stuck to the tinned-
fruit business.”
I smiled sadly when he left me. What hope was there
for that veteran story 2 There ought to be a society for the
prevention of cruelty to aged and decrepit plots.
I met Garrod a month later and he gripped me by the
hand.
“It's come off,” he cried. “The editor of The West Ken-
sington Magazine jumped at it. He's eager for a series on
similar lines. Suits the public. All men want to be on
desert islands with pretty girls, and all women want to be
on desert islands with nice men. Now you're in the busi-
ness. Could you give me a hint how the same idea could
be worked out in slightly varying forms?”
“It's easy,” I said. “Let a charming girl, who has
wasted a fortune in frivolity rather than vice, be working
her way home disguised as a stoker. She gets into con-
versation with a first-class passenger—artist, I should make
him. Wreck | Everybody drowned save stoker and artist.
Desert island. When rescued they hear that the she-stoker
has become immensely wealthy through the death of an
aunt.”
“I see, I see. Excellent. If I make a volume of these
short stories I shall certainly dedicate it to you. You
haven't another idea 2"
“You may have heard of a book called Robinson Crusoe.
Bring it up to date. Make him Sir Robinson Crusoe. One
day on his desert island he sees the print of a high heel
in the sand. Leave out Man Friday. Chaperons spoil the
effect.”
“Splendid!” said Garrod. “Thanks awfully, old man.”
Mark my words—two years from now Garrod will be a
best-seller. I don't grudge him that, but he has just been
elected Chairman of our Greens Committee.

Wife (by way of concluding altercation).
“CoME ON, BILL.
'E's BENEATH YER, EVEN IF 'E 'As GoT A MIDDLE-CLASS ’AT ON."
HENRIETTE.
(With the British Army in France.)
SINCE an army of wives invaded
Northern France, bent on reclaiming
their respective husbands to the paths
of peaceful domesticity, the daily mili-
tary round is invested with a suburban
setting. Wives pat our ties on the
doorstep, straighten out the kinks in
our Sam Brownes, and so far forget
our martial dignity as to suggest,
“Hadn't you better take your umbrella,
dear?” The final suburban touch has
been supplied by the revival of the
servant-girl question, consequent on
representations that a daily diet of
warmed-up Maconochie and bully-beef
rissole, as prepared by Jock and Bob,
the batmen, errs on theside of monotony.
It was useless to point out that the War
had been won on this diet.
“There is no point in prolonging the
horrors of war,” said Margaret;
“besides, Jock is failing. He served up
some very inferior cigarette ash with
the potatoes yesterday.”
“And, because I suggested an occa-
sidnal sweet, Bob has threatened to
make a pudding. He says he used to
make lovely jam roley-poley in old shell-
cases,” said Dorothy. “We must have
a bonne at once.”
Hence the coming of Henriette. We
found her on our return from parade—
or should one say, from the office?—in
complete possession of the dining-room.
Being satisfied with our appearance she
immediately engaged us and had pre-
parations for dinner well advanced be-
fore we had time to realize that we had
sacrificed our liberty and independence
for a mess of potage and three other
courses.
Without doubt Henriette was effi-
cient. Her cooking was excellent and
her economical management had a
visible effect on our friendly relations
with Messrs. Cox. But efficiency is a
terribly ruthless machine.
“Yon wumman,” said Jock a few
days after Henriette's arrival, “has the
flinty heart of a Quarter-maister an'
the accusing een of a Provost-Sergeant.
Her ideas o' cleanliness spell death tae
comfort. Let's gang whaur we can
smoke a fag wi'out her glowering the
whiles tae see a speck of ash doesna
licht on the floor.”
“I can't go nowheres,” said Bob
gloomily, “till I've cleaned the knives.”
“Wha's tae stop ye?”
“Shel” said Bob, jerking a thumb.
“She stopped my supper last night for
just stepping out.”
This was the commencement of a
domestic discipline beside which that of
the army was lax and easy. It reached
its culminating point of severity when
one morning Bob brought the Army
rations which are the solid foundation
of our diet. Henriette frowned dis-
approvingly at the joint and indulged
in vehement and critical remarks at
considerable length.
“What 'ave I done now?” said Bob
helplessly.
“Yeken fine,” said Jock; “she ordered
mutton an' ye’ve brocht beef again.”
“Does she think the R.A.S.C. is a
kind o' family stores?” said Bob. “A
lot o' choice they gives you.”
“Weel, ye’ve tae tak' it back an'
change it.”
“What 'opes?” replied Bob defiantly
but with a sinking feeling in his heart.
“If ye don't," continued Jock deliber-
ately, “she'll be takking it back hersel',
an' dock ye yer dinner forby.”
Bob considered the question for a
minute.
“All right, let her,” he said at
length; "'Enriette's 'ot enough, but

scrapping with the R.A.S.C. is just
suicide.” -
Henriette listened grimly to the dis-
cussion. Apparently she understood
Bob's mutinous refusal and decided on
prompt measures. Picking up the joint
she flung herself through the door and
strode off in the direction of the Supply
Depôt.
What happened there was subse-|
quently related by Jock.
“It wasna in my mind, Sir," said he,
“tae get mixit in international com-
pleecations, but I thocht it wad be an
eddication to see the R.A.S.C. reso-
lutely tackled, so I steppit oot an' volun-
teered tae gang wi' her. Losh, it wis
fine! There wis a bit o' a corp'ril in
the stores, an' when he clapped een on
me an' Henriette wi' the joint he just
doubled up fit tae dee for laughing.
“‘Now, M'am,' says he tae her,
‘what's your pleasure to-day? We
can't recommend our biscuits, but the
plum-and-apple is fine.'
“She juist withered him wi' a luik
an' tell't him things in French that
wad hae made his bluid rin cauld gin
he could hae unnerstood them.
“‘What's it all aboot ?' he asks
wi' a mazed luik. -
“The leddy's no' satisfied wi' the
ration beef,' says I. ‘Ye'd best change
it for a nice piece o' mutton an' let her
gang. Ye canna afford tae offend cus-
tomers at thic stage o' the War.’
“‘Ye'll tak what we gie ye an' be
thankful," says he, perking up.
“‘Weel," says I, ‘I’ve tell't ye for
yer ain guid. I ken the leddy,' says
I, ‘and I ken her possibeelities when
she's roused. The consequences be on
yer ain heid.’ -
“He lookit a bit scared at this, an'
he lookit mair scared when Henriette
thumpit the beef on the table, took
him by the neck and shook him whiles
the teeth rattled in his heid. Just then

says he sharply.
“‘It’s a complaint aboot the rations,'
says the Corp'ril, shaking. ‘Private
McBean wants mutton.'
“‘Well, we 'aven't got mutton,'
wheezes the Staff - Sergeant, “an' 'e
wouldn't 'ave it if we 'ad. I've a mind
to put you under arrest for bringing
civilians in 'ere,' says he to me.
“‘I’ve no' brocht 'er," says I. ‘The
leddy brocht me. Ye can pit her unner

GRAWE NATIONAL SITUATION.
INDUSTRIAL PEACE Continues
No SIGN or BREAK.
Duke of Southcliffe's MEssage to NATION.
[From “The Daily Sale” of April 1st, 1930.]
There is no sign of a break in the
stagnant period of industrial peace and
prosperity that is sapping the very
vitals of the nation and causing justified
alarm everywhere outside the charmed
circle of “the sleeping beauties” of the
Cabinet and those who benefit by their
inertia.
It is now ten years since the
vitalising influence of a strike exercised
its galvanic effect upon the nation.
Britain is sunk in the slough of con-
tent. And the Government, who are
directly responsible for this state of
affairs, are doing nothing to remedy it !
In another column we print in
leaded type the vital message delivered
to the nation by the Duke of Southcliffe.
One notable sentence is reproduced on
our front page to-day, Messrs. Sellit
and Sellit, the proprietors of “Kill-
um ” (the new vermin-destroyer and
furniture-polish), having patriotically
consented to the suspension of their
full-page announcement—for which
they have paid the record sum of one
hundred pounds an inch—in order that
we may do our part in awakening the
nation to the peril in which a Govern-
ment, unable to see beyond mere peace
and progress, have involved it. The
Duke of Southcliffe's warning will in
consequence to-day be in the hands of
the ten million intelligent daily pur-
chasers of The Daily Sale. It is, as
he says, a natural fact that “only by
conflict is real progress made. Pros-
perity spells lethargy. We must have
strife.” Unfortunately, and as usual,
the Government, instead of leading the
nation, waits for its hand to be forced
by public opinion. Public opinion
must operate. Lethargy must be de-
stroyed and healthy strife resumed.
It is to-day a fact that, as one hun-
dred-and-fifty special correspondents,
whose experiences are summarised on
page 30, unanimously state, the old
vigorous class warfare, that did so much
to make us great, is in eactremis (i.e. in
danger of dying out). This must not
be. As we have led before in times of
great national emergency, so we intend
to lead again, and the future will show
that we are entirely right. Such inci-
dents as the burning of The Daily Sale
by the Trade Union Congress leave us
unmoved. They merely serve to empha-
sise how far this once virile “Parlia-
ment of Labour” has fallen from its
originally high and useful estate. Its
present anaemia makes it, in the words
of Mr. Grinlie, its President, “content
with things as they are.” Was ever a
more dangerous gospel preached by
any responsible Labour leader? Britain
needs industrial strife. Too long has
an effete Administration allowed the
nation to wander in the lotus-land of
undisturbed prosperity. In no other
country does such an unnatural con-
dition of affairs prevail. It will not do
for us. It must go, and the Govern-
ment must go with it.
(Photographs on back page.)
CALLING NAMES.
[“Why should employers call workers by
their mames without the use of the customary
ceremonial prefixes, while they would resent
being addressed in that manner themselves by
the workpeople?”—Mr. Sidney Webb.]
ALREADY the workers call their em-
ployers all kinds of names which they
would resent being applied to them-
selves, and perhaps the balance is kept
with more exactness than Mr. SIDNEY
WEBB will admit. The particular point

he raises, however, will no doubt be
adjusted all in good time by the Trades
Unions.
We understand that in Mr. SIDNEY
WEBB's household, when the maid an- |
nounces “Dinner is served, Sir,” the
reply given is “Thank you, Miss Wil-
son.” And those who have been privi-
leged to observe the great social re-
former at luncheon in his favourite
restaurant cannot have failed to notice
that when Mr. SIDNEY WEBB asks the
waiter, “Well, how are you this morn-
ing, Arthur 2" the man replies, “Very
well, SID, and how's yourself?”
Lately, during his Christmas shop-
ping, while seeking a gift for his friend,
Mr. THOMAS, he entered a hosiery shop
and approached a young lady who was
standing behind the counter. “What
can I show you, Sir?” she asked. “A
red silk necktie, if you please, Madam,”
was the courteous reply, which unfor-
tunately she construed into a studied
affront.
It will indeed be a memorable day
in the history of social reform when
his lordship in Carlton House Terrace
rings the bell and says, “Oblige me by
bringing my spectacles from the library
table, will you?” and the footman re-
plies, “Right-6, CURzoN.”
CREATING.
I HAD decided, after much forethought,
to purchase a new suit, and by a curious
coincidence a woman-friend—it might
be my wife—had asked me to buy her
a ladies' fashion paper. I read this
paper in the bus on the way to my
tailor's.
The head cutter greeted me with a
genial smile and started showing me
patterns.
THEN IT took ME!
“Those shades are too drab for the
year of peace,” said I; “a little bright-
ness may now be displayed in the cor-
sage, and hose may take a joyous tone.
My trousers you can make of Chinese
blue and gold brocaded tissue; slash
them at the calf and trim them round
the ankle with Canadian mink and
kolinsky. They should be also lined
with jade nun's-veiling and cut with a
pannier effect, falling in graceful folds
to the knee.
“The coat,” I went on, “is to be of
oyster tarantulle lined with tomato-
coloured duvetyn. It should be cut to
a high waist line. The back should be
full, and the clinging sleeves of voile
should be caught at the elbow with a
vieux rose button. The neck and tail,
of course,” I said severely, “will be
fringed with monkey, fur.
“Underneath this " — I was now
warming to my work—“I will have a
fawn crêpe-de-chine shirt piped with
cherry-coloured silk and collared with
georgette, and a cravate of moiré. A
smart little powder gilet will complete
the costume.
“For out-door wear a dainty panne
spongebag toque will go with this chic
creation, covered with chiffon velvet
diamanté, and a bright lemon and
emerald silk motif should be fixed just
there,” I said, pointing at the exact
spot on the chief cutter's head.
The chief cutter started backwards,
and went as white as a sheet, and I de-
tected a queer clicking noise down in
his throat, but as he said nothing definite
I took it for granted he had memorized
my order, and so, tripping gaily to the
door, I bade him a cheery good day.

over the duties, and notwithstanding
that this was her first attempt served
up a dinner in no way distinguishable
from those normally produced by Cook.
Her example was an inspiration to all
her comrades. -

VAE VICTORIANIS /
THE success of Sylvia's Lovers, the
new musical comedy at the Ambassa-
dors, in which a French plot with a
WATTEAU mise-en-scène is enlivened by
a lavish use of the Lancashire dialect
on the part of the principal character,
is of course immensely appreciated by
the admirers of Mrs. GASKELL, whose
Sylvia's Lovers first appeared in 1863.
The compliment indeed is almost ex-
cessive to one who was an “eminent
Victorian,” and therefore more exposed
to obloquy than admiration; but after
all Mrs. GASKELL belonged to Man-
chester, and what Manchester said fifty
years ago, etc., etc.
It is pleasant to hear that Sylvia's
Lovers is shortly to be followed by a
comic opera, entitled Cranford, by Mr.
Mersey Ainger. The libretto, we under-
stand, is being adapted by Mr. Wickham
STEED from a psychical romance by the
Czecho-Slovak novelist, Hanusch Dab-
czik, and the principal part, that of the
Princess Prsmitrn,will be played by Miss
Shilbottle with that rich Northumbrian
“burr” for which she is so justly re-
nowned in the Midland pantos.
In this context we are glad to hear that
Mr. Bertrand Bolt has completed the
Second Act of his Grand Opéra Comique,
Daniel Deronda. The story, which
is felicitously named after a forgotten
novel by an old author named ELIOT,
deals with the romance and adventure
of South America in the days of the
famous Dictator Rosas, and the beau
rôle is assigned to Dan Deronda, a richly
humorous Irishman, who is constantly
bringing the scent of Donnybrook
across the pampas. The actual story
is borrowed from the Gaucho poet,
Hilario Poncho, a free and spirited
version having been made by Mr. CUN-
NINGHAME GRAHAM and Mr. T. P. O'Con-
Nor, M.P. -
We cannot help thinking, in con-
clusion, that our gifted composers might
give the pre-Victorians a chance as well.
What a fine title, for example, Pride
and Prejudice would be for a romantic
opera, in which the scene was laid in
Monte Carlo, the libretto founded on the
German of SchNITZLER, and the part of
Nero assigned to a full-blooded Polish
Jew with a perfect command of the
Glasgow dialect.
| THE WISH.
IF I with the lamp of Aladdin
Could summon benevolent sprites,
The genies and things that they had in
The days of Arabian Nights,
If once at my call an enchanted
Young fairy from nowhere arose
And promised one wish should be
granted,
Whichever I chose ;
My hopes wouldn't merely be built on
Quick methods of raising the wind,
The fabulous riches that MILTON
Attributes to Ormus or Ind;
Ambition's gay pinions—I've furled
'em ;
High rank's no attraction for me;
Not mine be a dukedom or earldom
Or Order B.E.
I'd waive then the wealth of a Croesus,
The latest six-cylinder Rolls,
A house that an agent could lease us,
A cook or a cellar of coals,
The clothes that apparel the dandy,
The pride of a pillar of state,
The dream of the golfer—a handi-
cap (say) of plus eight.
Not long at the choice would I fumble,
For wishes aren't given to waste;
No, mine would be rather more
humble—
A personal matter of taste;
Though Fate did her worst, I could
smash her
If my little fairy assured
The boon of a really good rasher
Of bacon (home cured).

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Essence of PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 8th.-A long and
learned oration by Lord HALDANE did
little to reconcile the Peers to the Elec-
tricity Bill. In vain he pointed out the
advantage of a central supply of
cheap—or comparatively cheap
—motive-power to the British
workman. Perhaps his assertion
that “we have never really thought
out the electricity question in this
country” put up the backs of
noble lords, who are a little tired
of Lord HALDANE's perpetual re-
commendation of “clear think-
ing" as the panacea for all our
ills. - One after another they de-
nounced the Bill as an example
of the Government's tendency to ||
bureaucracy and extravagance. It ||
looked as if the Bill might be re- ||
jected. But then arose the LoRD
CHANCELLOR. Since last week he
had had time to get up his brief
and was bristling with electricity.
The opponents of the Bill were
roundly told that they had not
read it or they could never have
made such ridiculous statements
as he had heard that night. As the
storm broke over their heads more
than one of them wished he had
not left his umbrella in the lobby; and
when it was over they were only too
glad to give the Bill a second reading
sub silentio.
A large part of Question-time in the
Commons was taken up with endeav-

ours to draw from Sir AUCKLAND GEDDEs
an exact explanation of his proposal to
limit the coal-owners' profits to one
industry as a whole. His replies were
as copious as ever, but I doubt if any-
body save the experts—and perhaps not
all of these—understood them. The

most that the unlearned could gather
was that the one-and-twopence was
not really one-and-twopence, but some-
thing more or less.
The difficulty of applying the doctrine
of “self-determination " all round may
he gauged from Captain ORMSBY-GoRE's
inquiry whether Albania is part of the
ex-Austrian Empire, the ex-Ottoman
Empire, Serbia or Greece. Mr. BonAR
LAW was frankly nonplussed and re-
ferred the riddle to the Peace Conference.
Tuesday, December 9th.-At the in-
stance of Lord NEwTON, the Peers
made several important changes in the
Aliens Restriction Bill, designed to
render it less harsh in its action towards
our late enemies. The alterations did
not meet with the approval of the
LoRD CHANCELLOR, who still had some
electricity left over from yesterday, and
used it for a spirited rendering of the
“Hymn of Hate” (British version).
I don't know that the arguments of
Lord HALDANE, who dwelt upon the
benefits conferred upon our interior
economy by foreign restaurateurs (and
incidentally gave a free advertisement
to certain fashionable hotels), or of
Lord BUCKMASTER, who viewed with
horror the possibility that German, that
“noble language,” should cease to be
taught in our schools, except by
“persons who know nothing about it,”
carried very much weight. The Peers
were, I think, more impressed by Lord
shilling and twopence per ton, and a |SALISBURY's admission that his heart
forecast of its probable effect upon the quailed at the thought of sending
Austrian women and children back to
their own country in its present de-
plorable condition; and they accepted
Lord NEwton's amendments without
a division.
A certain section of the House
of Commons believes that Mr.
CHURCHILL is still keeping British
troops in Russia, and otherwise
bolstering up the Anti-Bolshevists.
Lieut.-Colonel MALONE went so
- far as to suggest that we had been
|||subsidising the forces under Col-
Honel BERMost and General von
DER GoLTz, while Mr. Hogg E.
| pointed to the existence of the
| British Army of the Black Sea as
proof positive of Ministers' bad
faith. Mr. CHURCHILL denied the
first allegation, and disposed of
the second by informing his critic
that the Army of the Black Sea
is stationed, not in Russia, but in
Turkey. -
Debate on the supplementary
estimate for the Ministry of Pen-
sions revealed the fact that no
fewer than thirty-eight thousand
War - widows had already re-
married and thereby secured the
dowry of a year's pension offered
by the Ministry. Mr. HoggB suggested
that in order to encourage this practice
the dowry should be doubled. Happily
for the spinster population, already
faced with unfair competition, Sir
WoRTHINGTON Evans paid no attention
to this insidious proposal.

fighting in the air than any of his pre-
decessors—I believe Lords WEIR and
ROTHERMERE would be quite prepared
to endorse this tribute—and hoped this
did not indicate a return to dual control.
Nothing of the kind, the LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR assured him. The Government
were all for a single Air Ministry, but
the Air Force was at present too small
to require a whole-time Cabinet Min-
ister all to itself. By putting the WAR
MINISTER at the head of both Depart-
ments the best brains of both Army
and Air Force were brought to bear on
aerial problems; but if ever his right
honourable friend found himself unable
to live up to his own high standard he
would resign one of his posts. On re-
ceiving this testimonial Mr. CHURCHILL
at once telephoned to his hatter for a
larger size.
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE was unable to
attend the House of Commons on his
At Home day owing to an engagement
with M. CLEMENCEAU. Sir J. Norton-
GRIFFITHS promptly suggested that he
should bring the French PREMIER with
him. But Mr. BonAR LAw—remem-
bering, no doubt, what happened to the
young lady of Riga—“shook his head
in a negative sense” (I thank The Times
for teaching me that word).
In introducing the Navy Estimates
Mr. LoNG quickly showed that he has
no belief in the “Scrap the lot" doc-
trine. On the contrary, fortified by
the opinion of the young sea-dogs now
gathered round Lord BEATTY at the
Admiralty, he is in favour of “showing
the flag” more widely than in recent
ears. The Navy was costing a hun-
dred and fifty-seven millions a year—
much of it due to the better pay given
to our sailors—but even to save that
vast sum the country, he was convinced,
was not prepared to do without it.
After hearing this statement most of
the Members thought that they might
rest quietly in their beds, and thither
betook themselves.
Thursday, December 11th.-Accord-
ing to Lieutenant-Commander KEN-
worthy the objects of the Sinn Fein
loan are so innocuous that nobody
ought to be prosecuted for soliciting
subscriptions to it. Mr. MACPHERSON
thereupon quoted the announcement in
the prospectus that “interest on the
loan will not be payable until six
months after the Irish Republic has
received international recognition and
the English have evacuated Ireland.”
From some acquaintance with the habits
of the Irish investor I am convinced
that if the CHIEF SECRETARY were to
post up the prospectus on every police
barracks in Ireland with that condition
underlined he might dispense with his
prosecutions.
The Coal Industry (Emergency) Bill
met with an inglorious fate this aſter-
noon. The remark of its author, Sir
AUCKLAND GEDDEs, that it would not
find a single enthusiastic supporter in
the House, was entirely justified by
the debate. The declaration of Mr.
LESLIE Scott, that its principle (the
limitation of profits) was wrong, and
must not be applied to any other in-
dustry, was practically accepted by
Mr. BoxAR LAw, who said that it was
only introduced to fulfil a pledge to
the Miners' Federation. The miners'
representatives (Mr. ADAMSoN and Mr.
HARTSHORN) thereupon denied that they
wanted the Bill (not that º loved
the mine-owners particularly, but be-
cause they loved nationalization more).
After that it was useless for the Govern-
ment to press the ill-starred measure
upon a reluctant House. But the sit-
ting was not entirely wasted, for the
House, delighted to find that there was
still something in Ireland amenable to
the law, passed the Dogs Regulation
(Ireland) (No. 2) Bill.

THE NEW HOMME ORCHESTRE.
IN music as elsewhere the cost of pro-
duction has become an acute problem.
Even in pre-war times the economics
of concert-giving, where a full orchestra
was employed, had reached a stage in
which the adequate remuneration of
performers could only with great diffi-
culty be reconciled with a due regard
for the pockets of the public. Happily
the emergency seems likely to produce
the solution. Within the past fortnight
the newspapers have recorded the emer-
gence of two vocal pluralists. First there
was Mr. DICKINsoN, the window-cleaner
of Leigh, who can sing a tenor and
bass duet by himself. And now an
even more dazzling luminary has swum
into our ken in the person of Mr.
ALEXANDER B. RAwLE, of Teddington,
who, in the words of a representative of
The Daily News, “can not only whistle
and hum simultaneously, but can com-
fortably combine the tones so produced
into a passable imitation of the brass,
string and wood of an orchestra.”
The late Mr. GEORGE GRossMITH, it
will be remembered, simplified musical
entertainment to the extent of “Piano
and I.” But the Teddington virtuoso
has carried the one-man show to its
extreme limit by dispensing with all in-
strumental aid. “He whistled “Home,
Sweet Home' with vocal arpeggi that
would have made THALBERG sob like
a child.” The homme orchestre of old,
who had a number of instruments
strapped on to his person, which he
blew and belaboured simultaneously,
displayed a strenuous agility; but it
was at best a clumsy and a costly con-
trivance. Mr. RAwLE is the true man-
orchestra, needing no equipment but
his own larynx and lung-box. It is
true that he speaks modestly of his
sonority. “When in practice,” he told
The Daily News man, “I can fill an
average-sized hall.” In time and with
further practice we hope he will be
able to give a One-man Festival at
Olympia.
>k ::: -:
But the greatest of Mr. RAwLE's
achievements remains to be chronicled.
One of the most serious and irksome
drawbacks to the musical career is that
it involves, or is supposed to involve,
an arduous process of education, attend-
ance at colleges or academies, prolonged
studies under professors and teachers,
instruction in sight-reading, harmony,
counterpoint and so forth. Mr. RAw1.E
has reached his unique position without
any musical education at all. He “has
never learnt music, and cannot read a
note.” He is, as the Germans put it,
autodidakt. To say that he is merely

“self-taught" would be to commit the
unpardonable error of using two sylla-
bles where four are all too few to render
justice to the situation. This remark-
able case suggests the need of a drastic
revision of orthodox views on the subject
of musical education. Genius is the only
thing that counts in art, and if genius
can reach its highest development
without any schooling, the existence of
conservatoires, academies, etc., can no
longer be justified.
It is painful to think what might
have been the result if Mr. RAWLE had
entered the Royal Academy or Royal
College of Music and his soaring talent
had been constricted in the strait-
waistcoat of an academic curriculum.
He might have been drilled into a dull
contrapuntist or wasted his energies
on mastering the now obsolete sonatas
of BEETHoveN, or have been converted
into a mediccre player of the trombone.
Left to himself and the promptings of
his artistic instinct he has inaugurated
a new era in music and musical econo-
mics hardly less momentous than the
changes in astrophysics brought about
by the discoveries of EINSTEIN. If one
man can give a vocal and orchestral
concert without instruments or accom-
panist, the problem of cheap music for
the million is solved. On the other
hand, the prospects of single-voiced
vocalists, one-instrument instrumental-
ists and musical professors are gloomy
in the extreme.

FURTHER REVELATIONS;
oR, THE BRITISH STAFF WINDICATED.
IN these days, when to be a General
is synonymous with being the author
of a book with a sub-title of If I Had
Only Had My Way, there is no longer
any reason why I should withhold the
secret which has recently come to my
knowledge. Naturally, after reading (the
reviews of) the International Library
of Everyman's Memoirs, you have been
wondering by what happy chance we
friend told me, LUDENDORFF decided to
make every effort to bomb and destroy
his enemy's headquarters. It was use-
less, he explained, to attempt to bomb
the French; the chances of hitting the
one room in an estaminet in which all
branches of the Divisional Staff usually
congregated and shouted things down
innumerable telephones were too re-
mote. But if the French were gregari-
ous the perfidious English went to the
other extreme, and their headquarters
officers be? Their “A” branch then
chipped in with their habitual injured
air, and said that without “A” there
would be no records kept of personnel,
and neither “Q” nor “G” would know
whether there was anybody in the line
or not, unless they actually went there
to see for themselves. This point, I
believe, very nearly settled the question
in favour of “A.” But the argument
became so acrimonious, and there was
so much of the “If only you'd let me
usually spread over several square miles I know sometimes what you are doing,”
ever succeeded in winning the
merest skirmish, let alone the
War as a whole. -
Well, I can tell you. LoyAT
FRASER and all the others who
saw the War as a War, and not
merely as a messy business in-
volving extremes of boredom
and sheer fright, can put forward
their opinions to the contrary,
but I know ; I know because,
when I was on the Rhine, I got
the story from a Prussian Staff
Officer who had disguised himself |
as a country gentleman while
waiting for the next war.
I may say at once that our
success was not due entirely,
as you have been told, to the
doggedness and determination N
of the Tommy; it was not the S-
courage and initiative of the
subaltern nor his reading aloud
to himself during times of stress
from the pamphlet, “Am I Of.
fensive Enough 2" nor was it
the C.O. sitting in his dug-out
and writing to his company
officers, “You will attack point
88 at dawn, under a creeping
barrage, if it can be arranged,
but you will attack anyway.”
No, nor yet was it the green-
tabbed warriors who knew to a
digit the number of troops in
the Esthonian capital or the
high-water mark on the Vistula
rather than the news of their
own front. Doubtless these had

that LUDENDoRFF got fed up
--- with it and gave the squadrons
orders to do their very worst
over the whole area occupied by
one of our Corps headquarters
whose Commander was con-
sidered the most dangerous, he
having plagiarised. LUDEN-
DoRFF's methods too freely.
Great was the joy, so my Prus-
sian said with a gleam in his eye,
when the report came that the
whole of the important part of
the headqbarters was destroyed;
but their joy changed quickly to
chagrin and amazement when
it was discovered that the disin-
tegration of what was considered
the fountain-head of command
made little or no difference to
the organisation as a whole.
Alas, contempt for the British
Staff Manual, which he never
read seriously, caused this huge
miscalculation on the part of
LUDENDoRFF. He had not read
that wonderful paragraph about
“The Interchangeability of the
Staffs,” whereby an officer of
one department invariably trains
himself to be able to step cheer-
fully into the shoes of another
and carry on. He had never
realised how every Staff Officer
of one branch always envies the
easy task of doing the other
fellow's job and doing it better.
their uses, though some of them were
hidden from us by the proximity of
things which hiss before exploding.
But the factor which went further than
any other towards showing LUDEN-
DoRFF the futility of continuing the
War was something of a very different
character. -
It was in '17 that the German General
Staff began to cast about seriously for
a means of disorganising the Staff on
the other side. Up till then, I believe,
they had considered it better to leave
it alone and let it do its worst (some
say it did, but they are regimental
officers and know nothing about it).
At a great Conference, so my Prussian
of territory. LUDENDoRFF could not
hope to knock out every branch of the
Staff, and so the question arose which
was the best branch to bomb?
What followed was extremely inter-
esting. My Prussian explained that
on this subject the Hun “Q" staff
declared at once that the British “Q"
was the most important, since without
supplies our army could not carry out
the Napoleonic dictum and move on
its belly—not enough spring in it, I
suppose.
The Hun “G” Staff replied with
warmth that without “G” to move the
troops about a bit there would be no
war at all, and then where would “Q"
The effect was instantaneous.
When the catastrophe came, the Corps
Adviser in Horsemastership took over
the duties of the General Staff as if to
the manner born, and sent out the usual
messages to increase harassing fire one
hundred per cent., irrespective of the
amount of ammunition available, thus
preserving the lifelong feud between
himself and “Q.” The Chemical Ad-
viser, discarding his gas-mask, took
over the Brigadier “Q” job and at once
demanded a return of the fuse-number
of every shell fired on the 185h, subse-
quently correcting the date to the 19th.
The new Brigadier of the Artillery (the
Amusements Officer) began his régime.

Chief Engineer's office and having a
row. The O.C. Corps Prisoners' Cage,
following out the destiny of all Chief
Engineers, sent “Not available" to all
indents for stores from the Gunners,
while the Agricultural Officer carried
out the best traditions of the Intelli-
gence Staff and compiled overwhelm-
ing evidence to prove conclusively that
the enemy might attack at dawn, or he
might not.
Everything, in fact, went just as
smoothly as ever, indeed everything
went much better. For without the
Adviser on Horsemastership everybody
rode as it suited them and felt more
comfortable. Without the Chemical
Adviser everybody felt the need of a
gas-mask and wore it. Without the
Amusements Officer people saw the
funny side of Army Entertainments,
and without the Agricultural Officer
. Nature warmed to her work and the
vegetables flourished apace.
The realisation of the invulnerability
of our organisation was the real turn-
ing-point of the War, and it was from
this point that LUDENDoRFF really strove

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SPOOK CONGRESS.
ON St. Nicholas' Eve, in the dark be-
fore dawn, the National Amalgamated
Union of Ghosts and Associated Shades
held a well-attended gathering in the
ruined crypt of Grimchester Abbey, to
consider reconstruction. The Headless
Admiral took the sarcophagus.
In his opening remarks the Admiral
said that he felt it his duty at this the
first general meeting since 1914 to
thank those members of the Union who
had been serving their country on active
service. On the platform he was proud
to meet once more the Shivering Spook
of Saltpetre Hall, who had rendered
yeoman service supplying chill breezes
in Mesopotamia. He was also de-
lighted to find beside him Bloody Sir
Rupert, who had rattled his chains and
clanked his armour in the Ypressalient
throughout the War to give our troops
warning of enemy raids and night
attacks, In the body of the meeting
he saw other friends too numerous to
mention, spirits who had been, if he
might venture a ghastly jest, over-proof
(Loud gibbering) and he would ask his
hearers to show their gratitudein the cus.
tomary manner. (Prolonged ululations.)
The Skeleton Horseman, in field-boots
and wearing the General Service and
Allied Victory ribbons on his clavicle,
thanked the Chairman and the meeting
in a few soldierly words on behalf of
the ex-Service shades.
Proceeding, the Headless Admiral
remarked that the spectral situation
was by no means a satisfactory one.
His hearers would admit that he was
not given to losing his head (here the
speaker put it on the table), and he
wished to say in all seriousness that
only a very thorough season's haunting
could bring things back to the pre-war
status. “Un-canny,” not “Ca' canny,”
must be their watchword. There was a
fine psychic field waiting for enterprise
and energy.
Melchizedek the Murdered Miser
thought that more modern methods
should be introduced to secure atten-
tion. For instance, if the Admiral
would change his usual cry, “Luff'
Luff Will they never luff” to “Sack
the lot l” or something similar, he was
sure such a step could not fail to be
popular. He himself had changed his
bags of gold for Treasury Notes with
most gratifying results.
The Phantom Drummer asked whether
the executive had given full considera-
tion to the question of Direct Manifest-
ation. When he returned from active
service he found that The Bloated
Grange had been let to a jujube manu-
facturer, who had made a large fortune
during the War out of rat-exterminators.
As usual he appeared at midnight by
the Blue Room bed, now occupied by
this person, and said loudly, “I am the
Drummer.” The man asked in the
most vulgar fashion what firm he tra-
velled for, and why he had not come
in office hours. He submitted that the
Union should take combined action
over cases like this.
The Bleating Bogle said he was most
strongly in favour of Direct Manifesta-
tion. Several times lately, he remarked,
he had had an electric fan turned on
him while trying to materialize.
The Yammering Ghoul of Dramtu-
muchie said that while Direct Mani-
festation was on the tapis he would like
to draw attention to the present Prohi-
bition campaign. He maintained that
if Prohibition came into force it would
be the worst thing that had happened
to British ghosts since the invention of
electric light. -
In a brief and witty speech the Wam-
pire Nurse expressed herself against
anything which tended to suppress the
individual element. Ghosts who were
conscientious workers never had any
difficulty in making their mark. Her
own business of drowning the baby
heir in the moat had gone down well
ever since it was introduced in 1721.
Whustlin' Wullie asked whether any
steps had been taken to prevent the
immigration of undesirable aliens from
Central Europe, which must be full of
unemployed Werewolves and Doppel-
gangers. Our good nature had been
imposed upon before.
Gibletto the Gory Ghibelline, rising
with great indignation, said that he
hoped that the last speaker was not
making backhanded references to him.
He had been a supernaturalized English-
man since the time of CHARLEs II.
Whustlin' Wullie begged that Gib-
letto would not take his remarks as per-
sonal. No one had a higher regard for
him (Gibletto) than he (Whustlin'
Wullie) had. Here he clapped that
phantom heartily on the back and con-
sequently expressed regret that the
point of the poniard which his friend
wore through his chest stuck out so
inconveniently behind.
The Headless Admiral was proceed-
ing to exhort all present to make the
most of the present Shade boom, when
the cock crew, and the assembly, gather-
ing together their shrouds, manacles and
loose vertebrae, hastily evaporated.

Like this, “Go in and win, man' "
Or, “Down with the tomato, REECE ' "
Or, “Play up, can't you, INMAN ?”
For in those halls where silence dwells,
Where coughs resound like thunder
And sneezes crash like bursting shells,
Emotion is kept under.
But if the stifled powers of these
Unnaturally grave men
Were once let loose they'd promptly
Selze
The chance to act like cave-men.
In thought they hurtle chalk and cues
Like mad at one another ;
Here this man that man's elbow screws,
There brother cannons brother.
And as their passions' seething froth
Of violence grows darker
The blood that's spilt upon the cloth
They mop up with the marker.

For language is unbeatable,
Which, as they never speak aloud,
Is simply unrepeatable.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I FANCY that most of us would admit that our chief
interest in the Memoirs of the Great (opportunities of con-
sulting which have not lately been wanting) lies in the
glimpses they afford of the Other Great at close quarters.
I seldom met a book that appealed more frankly to this
natural instinct than the volume put together by that
clever and himself most interesting man, the Roumanian
Minister, M. TAKE Jonescu, under the sufficiently apt title
of Some Personal Impressions (NISBET). Here you get
your celebrities neatly arranged, a chapter to each. Often
the chapters are no more than a couple of pages, or a
single anecdote, in length; but of every one (as Viscount
BRycE justly says in his brief preface) “we feel that the
man described is no longer a name but a creature of flesh
and blood.” I am not going to pretend that always the
incidents attached to the names are of first-class importance;
but as a whole the book conveys a remarkably vivid im-
pression of European diplomacy from within. Perhaps
not one reader in twenty, glancing through the table of
contents, will be able to resist turning first to the chapter
devoted to the Ex-KAISER, though here it is to be admitted
that M. Jonescu has least chance of telling us anything
very novel. The best, certainly the most appreciative,
of the German portraits is that of the late KIDERLEN-
: WAECHTER, for whom the writer entertained a profound
admiration. The chapter under his name contains two say-
ings worthy of quotation—one from KIDERLEN-WAECHTER
himself: “Every big victory is the work of the people, and
the people have to be paid for it;" and the other a strikingly
sane estimate of England by BISMARCK, over-long for me to
quote here. These give you a measure of the book—the
lightest of anecdotal reading, but written by a man too
individual to be commonplace.
Mr. HoRACE HUTCHINson has long been one of the
heroes of the golfing world, but he wields the pen as
deftly as the putter, and his literary excursions have
carried him far beyond the confines of the Royal and
Ancient pastime. Peter Steele the Cricketer contains the
best description of a village cricket-match I know of ;
Cricketing Saws and Stories is a little masterpiece; and he
has also achieved distinction in the domains of fiction,
psychics and natural history. He was once called the
“Sardonic Hutchinson" by an eminent Scots philosophic
critic of golf; but that was probably owing to his famous
negative definition of the game: “Golf is not agriculture.”
As a matter of fact “sardonic” is the last epithet I should
have chosen for a writer so generous, modest and whimsi-
cally humorous—never more so than when at his own
expense. His new book, Fifty Years of Golf (Country LIFE
OFFICEs) may be described as primarily a golfing autobio-
graphy, but the mellow urbanity of the style, the wealth of
anecdote and the knowledge of human nature which it
displays will commend it to many readers who have never
handled a club. No one has given us so many or such genial
portraits of the outstanding figures of the golfing world in the
last half-century. The writer knew them all, as instructors,

exemplars, or rivals, but always as friends, and he has a
kindly or affectionate word to say of them all. When the
Royal and Ancient Club of St. Andrews elected him captain
in 1908, “one of my wife's relations was good enough to
say, ‘I’m glad they made Horace that—it will look so
well in his obituary notice.’ So it will; but I hope not yet.”
That is a hope which all golfers and all lowers of good
letters will cordially endorse.
Perhaps it is only fair to warn disciples of the original
“BARTIMEUs.” that parts at least of An Awfully Big
Adventure (CASSELL) hay tend a little towards disappoint-
ment. The fact is that the title-tale is too big for its
setting. Zeebrugge remains such a heart-stirring piece of
history that to have it served up as part of a parti-
cularly silly love-story makes for impatience. Not there,
nor in the twice-told stories of the “Q-boats" that follow,
searchings of trays, turned out to be, “See Estimates No. 50,”
and so vanished into air. I don't know in what Govern-
ment Office Mr. SHANKS was employed, but he certainly
deserves the gratitude of all Civil Servants, temporary or per-
manent; for wherever it was his time was surely well spent.
In The Purple Jar (HUTCHINsoN), Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick
has used Miss EDGEwoRTH's story of the chemist's bottle,
which was mere clear glass when the contents were tipped
out, at once to provide a title and to suggest a moral to her
story. Sally was an English girl who would go and be a
governess in Germany. Her adventures in Hamburg con-
sist chiefly of a love affair with a young German of dis-
honourable intentions, but, until the last when he went
unbelievably to pieces, of great personal attractions. I
don't think Mrs. SIDGwick has made quite a success of
writing in the first person from the point of view of a very

To lovers of birds there can

a book by Mr. W. H. Hudson,

Birds in Town and Village

If anyone had said to me, before I read The Old Indis-
pensables (MARTIN SECKER), that it was possible to write a
satiric novel two hundred and fifty pages long on the
internal mechanism of a Government Office, even a latter-
day Government Office, I should have flatly refused to
believe him. Not because these places are so abysmally
boring as tradition would have it; rather they must be full
of humorous happenings, or why that loud chuckle at half-
past three in the club smoking-room? but because of all
jokes the jokes of Civil Servants seem to be the most tech-
nical. To Mr. EDWIN SHANKs, however, it has been given
to achieve the impossible and to play with chains of
authority, channels of communication, red tape and routine
as if they were so many iridescent soap-bubbles, and to make
characters of farce out of the slaves of schedules and re-
turns. It is hard to say what is the prettiest fancy in the
tale of the Department of Evasions at the Circumlocution
Office, but perhaps it is the one which concerns the lost
papers on the appointment of Sir Ephraim Hogg, who,

word of it is derived from observation and understanding
of the inhabitants (both on the wing and on foot). Here
Mr. HUDsoN pays considerable attention to the daw, which
abounds in the Duchy and is left almost unmolested. He
is not at pains to defend the rogue, in fact he calls it an
“injurious bird,” but he explains very clearly why “Jackie”
is so widely tolerated. “The daws,” he says, “may be
regarded as bad hats generally in the bird community, and
on this account they touch a chord in us." I must add
that Mr. DETMOLD's coloured illustrations are exquisite.

“Schusucht" sounds more like “Hunt the Slipper.”

TO THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB ON IIs HOME-COMING.
. . [Being a welcome from a next-door neighbour who rejoices in the
evacuation of the Club's premises by the War Office, and notably for
reasons (connected with the War-emergency hutments that still block
the river-view in this vicinity) which should be appreciated by Sir
ALFRED MOND, of the Office of Works, himself an ornament of the
Club in question.]
LONG have I waited with eyes that yearn,
Watching and watching for your return,
Since to the country's cause you lent
What for a party's use was meant,
Lending it just the same as though
The option was yours to stay or go.
Worn to a thread with hope deferred,
Peace to me was an empty word.
What was the good of a truce to gore
If there were still dug-outs next door 2
If, where a halycon calm should be,
Flappers of War still wolfed their tea?
While you were gone this weary spell,
Occupying a strange hotel,
My heart resembled a hollow drum—
Nothing could fill the vacuum ;
Oh, it is time you were here again
To stay the longing and staunch the pain.
Yes, and it's time for your own sakes too,
Who are not a very united crew;
For some of you follow the Wee Free quest
And some with the Tories have coalesced—
Causing a split that you can't repair
Except in the old familiar lair.
Changes, I fear, have cast a blight
On the haunt of sweetness, the home of light;
Horrible hutments block the line
Of vision across your Thames (and mine);
But, once you are back, Sir ALF, no doubt,
For love of his Club will wipe them out.
Reason enough for me to yearn
From the pit of my tummy for your return,
Apart from the neighbourly joy that I
Take in your caravanserai,
In its simple charm and its old-world grace,
And the cachet it gives to Whitehall Place.

DUAL MENTALITY.
SIR,--I take the liberty of sending you a curiosity of
literature that may perhaps interest your readers. I am a
contributor of occasional articles to the more thoughtful
section of the Press, and last evening I was engaged upon
an essay entitled “Moral Evolution and the League of
Nations.” Owing to the contemptibly inadequate ration
of coal allowed us by the local Fuel-Overseer I am nowadays
compelled to do my spare time writing in the drawing-
room, which is also occupied after dinner by my wife.
Usually I am able, as the result of a rigorous course of
self-training, to divide my brain into two water-tight com-
partments, concentrating the one upon my work and
simultaneously lending the other to a discussion with my
wife on domestic and other topics. On this occasion,
however, owing to some obscure aberration which ap-
parently produced a form of mental short-circuiting, the
two compartments refused to work independently, with
the result that the article, which I enclose here with,
emerged in a somewhat unconventional form. It was only
on reading it over this morning that I discovered the
strange effect, of which I was at the time quite unconscious.
Possibly some of your readers may be able to advance a
scientific explanation of this interesting phenomenon.
Yours truly, (REv.) Thomas FIDDLE, D.D.
[ENCLosure.]
It is ſervently to be hoped that the present obscurantist
attitude of the United States Senate will not be allowed to
wreck the project of the League of Nations before it is
even launched. Allowing for differences in temperament,
it cannot be gainsaid that by her continued neglect to dust
the dining-room mantelpiece Florence has fully merited
a month's notice. Whether, however, in view of the
alarming growth of Bolshevist activity all over the world it
would be wise at this juncture to court still further State
upheavals must depend on Cook's future performanees.
Certainly the cutlets to-day were grossly underdone; but
blood is thicker than water. The lofty traditions of Anglo-
Saxon friendship and co-operation forbid the notion that
eggs should go any higher; while the obsession of the
Monroe Doctrine cannot altogether account for the fact
that Skinner's bacon is a disgrace. Of course the question
of arousing American opinion by means of an organised
campaign is one entirely for the Profiteering Tribunal, and,
if the bathroom waste-pipe is choked, the Government
must find a way out.
On the other hand, it would be idle to deny that one of
the most disheartening aspects of the situation is Mrs.
Tomlinson's new sealskin jacket. Admitted that her
husband has just made a small fortune by a regrettable
speculation in Oils, this policy of isolation from the essential
concerns of civilisation at large is one that cannot be
logically defended. Nor is it to be supposed that Susan
Dillwater's engagement has been broken off merely from
a desire to avoid unprofitable European entanglements.
What the young women of to-day are coming to is a ques-
tion that President WILsoN could doubtless answer if he

a certain piquancy to the fact that Cousin Jane's chilblains
have lately been much worse. If the brotherhood of man-
kind is to be something more than an empty phrase, it
should be rubbed with embrocation night and morning.
This will give the protagonists of a lasting world-wide
peace an opportunity to stop the tittle-tattle that goes on
in the village, and we may then hope to discover what
became of the rest of the bottle of claret that was opened
yesterday to inaugurate a new era of goodwill and pros-

CHRISTMAS DESSERT.
THE grown-ups eat their oranges sitting in their places;
They take so long about it, they wear such sober faces;
With their knives and forks of silver they cut away the rind,
And what a dreadful lot of juice they always leave behind.
Tom and I eat oranges sitting on the ground;
We use our thumbs for boring, and, oh, the squeegy sound
Of sucking through the sugar-holes' the pips we nearly
swallow
We drink up our orange-juice until the skins are hollow.

BERTRAM THE BAILIFF.
“HE 'll be here in a few minutes,”
I said; “is everything ready ?”
“Yes, everything,” said Margaret.
“There's a nice fat pouch of tobacco in
his bedroom—that's most important,
isn't it 2—and a barrel of beer in the
scullery and a rickety wooden chair in
front of the kitchen fire. That's all
he'll want if he's anything like the
bailiffs I've met—in books.”
“S-sh, speak lower. Remember the
cuckoo-clock is listening. I shouldn't
like the bird to know, he's always had
such respect for me. To think that
after all these years, Margaret, we two
should be sitting here hand-in-hand”—
I seized her hand hastily—“sitting here
four-in-hand, I mean hand-in-hand,
before the dying embers waiting for
the bailiffs' "
“But there's only one man coming,”
said my wife, and she threw a log on
the fire. -
“That makes it all the worse. They
insult us by thinking one is enough for
the likes of us.” I was growing bitter.
“Well, one is enough for me. I do
hope we shall get on with him. They're
Government beer, and then—
nice kindly men as a rule, aren't they?
Willing to help in the house and nurse
the baby and all that ?”
“That is so, Margaret. At least ac-
cording to the novels of my youth; but
they may have changed all that.”
“Don’t you think we ought to hire
a baby for him? He may become vio-
lent when he finds there isn't one.
He may suspect us of smuggling it
away to prevent the landlord distrain-
ing on it.”
There was a thud on the door.
“Here he is l’’ cried Margaret, and I
turned and went with heavy tread to
let the bailiff, or rather the bailiff's
man, into my home.
A few days later I met my Uncle
Gregory. “My dear boy,” he said, “is
it really true? Have you got the
b ; have you got them in 2"
“Only one. And he's the bailiff's
man, I believe. The bailiff, you must
know, is much too superior a person to
come himself; he only attends Royalty.
You have to give his man plenty of
beer and a chair by the kitchen fire,
and lots of shag now that the beer is
“Yes, I know,” interrupted Uncle
Gregory crossly, “then they nurse the
baby for you and help in the house.
I've read just as many novels as you
have. The beggars aren't like that in
real life, though.”
“But this one is, Uncle Gregory. He
nearly wept when he found there wasn't
a baby to be nursed. We've grown quite
fond of him. Bertram is his name.”
“Well, I can't think how you've
managed to get yourself and that
poor girl into such a disgraceful pre-
dicament,” burst out Uncle Gregory;
“surely with your income ; :
“To tell the truth,” I interrupted,
“I've been rather extravagant lately.
Margaret sent me to get her a penny
packet of nasturtium seeds for the
window-boxes, and I got her six for
fivepence halfpenny. She's just as bad
herself, though; I cannot get her to eat
her bubble without a squeak. So the
result is we've been living beyond our
income for some time past.”
“But had you saved nothing at all,
Gerald 2"

sixpenny money-box some time ago,

“Well, I don't understand you,” said
Uncle Gregory.
“I know; but you will soon,” I said
darkly as he strode away.
When I got home that evening I
found that our conversation had already |.
borne fruit.
“Aunt Elizabeth has only just gone,”
said Margaret. “She's been lecturing
me on our bad management and the
spindrift lives we've been leading.”
“Spendthrift,” I said.
“Yes, that sort of life. And she said
we were disgracing the family. Bertram
made us toast for tea, though.”
“The question now is, Margaret, will
the family feel disgraced to the point
of paying up the landlord, or will it
not ?”
“I'm afraid it will,” said Margaret;
and she was right.
A few days later we bade a reluctant
farewell to our visitor, for we had
become quite fond of the kindly old
IIl&n.
In a fortnight, however, he was back
again, put in by the justly incensed
grocer, whose seventh application on
bright orange-paper had met with no re-
sponse. Once more a scandalized family
came to the rescue, and once more we
parted from Bertram, our good old
friend—one of our oldest, we began to
consider him.
On hearing of his third appearance
in our kitchen our relatives summoned
us to a family council.
“Have you any explanation to
offer,” thundered the head of the clan,

“Oh, but I'm awfully methodical,”
I said. “I keep a carefully worked out
scale of bills, which I settle in a cer-
tain fixed order, so as to leave only one
creditor gnashing his teeth at a time.
First, the landlord gnashed, after him
the grocer, then the baker. The next,”
—I consulted a note-book—“yes, the
next to gnash is my tailor, I think.”
“And why on earth must you let
things get to such a state? Surely
with your income—”
“But I'm not complaining; we like
our Bertram; he's very good com-
pany and useful in lots of ways. He
dusts the cuckoo and exercises the
carpet-sweeper. To be sure he doesn't
nurse the baby; but how can he ”
There isn't nº -
“Enough of this nonsense,” said my
Uncle Gregory; “we mean you to
realise that you are disgracing the
family, and that something must be
done.” - .
“Well, then,” I said in desperation,
“perhaps you can suggest some other
way of getting a servant. You must
admit we're the only members of the
family who don't have to answer the
door themselves. You say we're dis-
gracing you, but I think you ought to
be very proud of us and of Bertram the
Faithful Retainer.”
There was silence; then a subdued
rustling as the family melted slowly
away, leaving Margaret and me to our
triumph.
Three weeks later Bertram placed six
postcards on our breakfast-table.
Each was from an uncle, aunt or
other member of the family, and each
bore the same words:—
“We have the bailiffs in.”

Wendor of Penny Toys (to millionaire). “’ERE Y'ARE, SIR.
WAITS AT THE CROSS-ROADS.
SEVERAL pairs of heavy boots were
dragged as far as the lamp at the cross-
roads. Then the band played.
After a single performance of a carol
tune I heard a massive form clamber-
ing over my rockery, and horny thumbs
seeking the bell-push. Waving my
retinue of servant aside, I myself
opened the door, more in anger than in
sorrow, and spoke without reserve to
the musician who stood there holding
a dented euphonium in one hand and
touching a few fragments of hat with
the other.
In a voice that was gentle though
husky he offered an explanation of his
visit. “There's some as don't like us
to go too far, guvnor, so we gives a
sample and then calls to discuss
business.” -
“I don't understand,” I replied, “and
in any case come off those bulbs.”
“S'posin' you don't 'appen to be fond
of a bit of music,” he said tolerantly,
“p'ra'ps there's some—er—friend you'd
like us to visit, now you know our
style. Ten chunes, carrils and what-
not, for seven-and-a-tanner—or ‘’Erald
Angels' over and over for five bob,
that's our tariff,” and he breathed on
the breech of his instrument and
polished it lovingly with his sleeve.
I was quick to catch his meaning,
and it was but the work of a moment
to select one of my—er—friends.
“Take this seven-and-sixpence, my
good man,” I said. He obeyed. “Go
to the Avenue, to a house named
‘Woodside'; play there. It is sure to
be appreciated.”
I returned to my fireside well pleased
to think that Raunder, the president of
our local orchestral society, was about
to receive some return for his outrageous
conduct which compelled me to resign
my place as second flute.
I could hear the shuffling of feet,
but when the musicians moved away it
was not in the direction of the Avenue.
Hatless I pursued them. The one who
had called on me turned politely to meet
me. -
“Scoundrels'. I pay you to go to
Woodside, and you move off in the op-
posite direction. Give me back my
money.”

“You said “The Lilacs,’ Bill,” said the
Cornet reproachfully; and the Eupho-
nium, looking puzzled, replied that
“The Lilacs” was certainly what he'd
understood the gentleman to say.
“Some misunderstandin', Sir,” he
said blandly, feeling in his pocket. “If
I'd 'ad any idea it was “Woodside'
I couldn't never 'ave took the money.
Couldn't 'ardly go back to “Woodside,'
could we, Sam 2"
“Imposserble,” said the Cornet.
“Go back | What do you mean?”
I asked. -
“Well, guvnor,” said the Euphonium,
“if we was to go playin' at ‘Woodside'
the gent there would want to know why
we wasn't up 'ere playin' outside o' your
'ouse, like what 'e told us; " and he
handed me three half-crowns, two of
which, I subsequently discovered, were
bad ones. - -

The Dottoressa MonTEssoRi, the renowned Italian Educationalist,

on and justified the absence of fairy-tales in the modern Italian
system of children's education.]
THE learned Dottoressa MonTEssori,
Whom neo-Pestalozzians idolize,
Crowning her with a special crown of glory—
A halo of a supra-normal size,
But whom Victorians, whether Whig or Tory,
Regard with dubious or indifferent eyes,
Has eloquently ventured to assail
The domination of the Fairy Tale.
Little she cares for ANDERSEN or GRIMM,
And all the wizards who have long beguiled
With their caprice and fantasy and whim
The instincts of the self-expressing child;
Great Pan is dead, and now along with him
The fays must follow, ruthlessly exiled
By fiat of the famous Dottoressa
And the enlightened teachers of Odessa.

Avaunt, O tribe of leprechauns and gnomes;

Affront the latest grandeur that is Rome's;
We have no longer any use or need
For Puck or Peaseblossom or Mustardseed.
Well, well, it is an arduous task, I trow,
To keep the realm of Oberon out of bounds
While still the horns of elf-land faintly blow,
Charming initiate ears with delicate sounds,
And while the little people come and go
On lone enchanted knolls and mossy mounds,
With WALTER DE LA MARE, “R. F.” and YEATs,
Warders and watchers of the ivory gates.
And you, Signora, who would banish fairies,
Take heed lest your emancipative zeal
In extirpating fanciful vagaries -
Estrange your friends and limit your appeal;
Of wonder and surprise each child the heir is,
And 'tis a crime that heritage to steal;
Rather let us the children's treasure cherish,
For where no vision is the people perish.

AUCTION HANDICAPPING.
“No,” said Vernon Umpleby in a
tone of cheerful retrospect as he mani-
pulated an under-vitalised soda-siphon
—“ no, Sandy, I'm afraid that you
Scotchmen are no good at auction.”
“There was once a Scotchman who
was put up at auction,” I said, “but
there was no sale.”
“No bidders, you mean,” said Wer-
non, talking indistinctly through the
bottom of his tumbler.
“On the contrary, there were plenty
of bidders; but the upset price was too
high.” -
“Rot l’’ said Vernon.
“I'm not a bit downhearted because
you have won two evenings at bridge.
We did rather better to-night.”
“Yes,” said Vernon; “you were only
eight hundred down to-night and twelve
hundred down last night.”
“Anyhow, it might be worse.”
“Which how 2 ”
“We might have been playing for
half-a-crown a hundred instead of ten-
pence a thousand.”
“I thought it was twopence a million.”
“Did you?” I said. “Then it 's
lucky for me I didn't win. I should
hate to have trouble with you in your
own house about the stakes.”
“Don’t worry about that,” said Ver-
non kindly. “We could soon settle the
trouble outside the house. At least you
would be outside.”
“Thanks,” I said, rising. “I can
take a hint as well as any man.”
“Yes,” said Vernon. “And, being
Scotch, you can take a drink as well as
any two men. Help yourself, and sit
down.”
I did both.
“Look here, Sandy,” said Vernon,
“I don't like winning your money.”
“Being a Yorkshireman, it must cut
you to the heart.”
“I'm going to offer you a handicap,”
Vernon said. “You see, there's prac-
tically nothing to choose between our
wives.” ,
“I’ve only one,” I said, “and I
prefer her to any other. And you
wouldn't have said that about them if
they hadn't gone upstairs half-an-hour
ago.”
“Let's talk sense,” said Vernon, a
little testily.
“Well, you begin.”
“I’m quite serious,” said Vernon;
“I want you to have a run for your
money. So I propose to give you a
handicap.” … -
“I've got one already,” I objected.
“As they don't play for anything and
as I play with Margot and as she is
your wife she gets half of your winnings.
She must be tenpence in over these
two nights. I noticed that she went
up to four diamonds and five no-
trumps to-night, and you doubled each
time. We lost about five hundred on
those two hands.”
“Margot does go a bit above her
paper,” said Vernon judicially. “So
we must allow for that in the handicap.
Let me see—”
“I can give you two strokes a hole
at golf,” I suggested helpfully. “How
would that do as a basis?”
Vernon answered.
“Quite simply,” I said persuasively.
“Let's take it that a round of golf is
equal to a rubber at auction. I give
you thirty-six strokes on a round of
golf, so you will give me thirty-six
points on a rubber of auction—below
the line, of course.”
“But that would be a game right
away,” Vernon objected.
“Not necessarily,” I said. “You
see, I might elect to take eighteen
points on the first game and the other
eighteen on the second or third—if
there was a third. Then Margot and
I would only want two tricks in clubs
or better to take us out.”
“I see your idea, of course,” Vernon
said, “but it sounds a bit complicated.
Mine was to let you score game at
twenty points, and Ethel and I would
have to make the usual thirty. That's
giving you a third of the game—fairly
generous, I think.”
“For a Yorkshireman, perhaps it is.
I give you thirty-six strokes a round
at golf and you offer me a third—six
strokes—at auction. Of course you
can't play golf for nuts.”
“No more can you auction,” Vernon
said hastily.
“That completes my case, m'lud,” I
said, rising to my feet and sitting down
again.
“Surely,” Vernon grumbled, “if I let
you score game at twenty, that's good
enough for you?”
“No,” I answered, “not nearly. But
I'll compromise with you. I'll take
three bisques in each rubber.”
“Three points, do you mean?”
“No. Three tricks, of the current
value, at any time just after a hand
finishes. And I'll take my bisques
singly or all in a lump, just as I
please.”
Vernon thought over this a moment.
“I don't mind trying that, just for
fun. And I don't mind betting you
three to one in half-crowns that you
won't win, even with three bisques.”
“I’ll take that,” I said, “over the
next three nights.”
“Good,” said Vernon, chuckling.
“Of course we are making a fresh
start 2 " I asked.
“I don't see how it would work,”
“Yes, if you like to put it that way.”
“We start fair and level again?”
“Yes, yes,” Vernon agreed.
“Then you'll begin by paying me
back that one-and-eightpence.” -
“Well, of all the-the–Scotchmen,”
Vernon said explosively.
He rose from his chair, took some
change from his trouser-pocket, picked
out a shilling, a sixpence and two
coppers, and put the rest back. He
looked thoughtfully at the one-and-
eightpence, and then slowly returned
it to his pocket.
“No,” he said—“no. On second
thoughts I won't. I don't want you
to have a bad night. If I gave you
back all this money you wouldn't be
able to sleep for joy.”
- ::: ::: ::: :: - ::
Next evening we played on the three
bisques per rubber basis. On the first
hand Margot and I had an absolutely
fool - proof heart call, and went out
with four tricks. In the next game
we went a thin diamond and made
two tricks, fourteen, and, taking three
bisques, twenty-one, ran out game and
rubber.
The next rubber, after several hands,
made them twenty-four to our twenty-
one in the first game. We had agreed
to hold up our bisques, and a lucky odd
trick in spades took us out. In the
second game Vernon and Ethel had a
little slam in no trumps.
“Game and game,” said Vernon
joyously.
“No,” I said, “on the contrary, we
take our three bisques here, and that's
rubber to us.” .
“Hang it all, we've made game,
haven't we ?”
“Perhaps. It's rather a technical
point; but three bisques in no trumps
is game to us, and two games make a
rubber. I stand by my agreement.”
“Yes, the Scotchman keeps the Sab.
bath and everything else he can lay his
hands on.”
“Including his bargain,” I said, “and
his temper.”
After that Ethel suggested tactfully
that handicapping by bisques seemed
rather silly, and Margot that it was a
fine evening for snooker pool. R. K. R.

That distant spot—a silvery beach
Stretching away to uplands wide
Where herds of reindeer, gentle-eyed,
Browse upon toothsome herbs that grow
All warm and snug beneath the snow,
And frosty gnomes in jerkins blue,
The keepers of the caribou, *
Come for the milk that never fails
To fill their silver milking-pails. .

With simply sacks and sacks of toys
For well-conducted girls and boys.
High-perched above the soundless

Where marble-stiff the billows stand,
Yet sheltered from the Arctic breeze
Crying, “Heigh presto!
By groves of sparkling Christmas-trees,
Where blood-root and the Christmas
rose
And every flower that braves the snows
Bloom, and the tender snowdrop
smiles
And dreams of sun-enchanted isles—
A long, low log-house all of fir
Is full of bustle, noise and stir,
As, spurred and booted, Santa comes
And stamps his feet and blows his
thumbs
And leaps into his jingling sleigh,
Harkaway !
Expect me back on Christmas morn;
God bless my soul! where is that
horn ?”
Oh, week by week and day by day
Old Santa Claus has worked away
With gnomes in hundreds at his beck
To nail and glue, to pack and check
Horses and dolls and Noah's Arks
And ſubsy dogs with lifelike barks,
Soldiers and picture-books and guns
And woolly lambs for little ones.
So, children, be most awfully good
And fold your clothes, as children
should ;

Or dog's-ear Father's history book,
Or make Nurse have to tell you twice

And pierce the gloom with eager eyes,

ESSE N C E OF PA R L I A M E N T.
A MINISTERIAL CHRISTMAS PARTY.
“THERE ARE Toys AND Toys.”—Sir AvcKLAND GEDDEs.
Monday, December 15th.-A humble
apology by Lord STANHOPE for his
share in the Dougi,As-PENNANT inquiry
furnished Lord CURzoN with an oppor-
tunity for administering to the House
of Lords as a whole a tremendous
dressing-down. By its impulsive action
it had inflicted pain upon a number of
innocent people and cost the State ten
thousand pounds. Lord SALISBURY
made a mild protest against the manner
of this castigation; but the other Peers
seemed to think it more judicious to
kiss the rod than to provoke its further
exercise.
With the acceptance of the Commons'
Amendments, the Church “Enabling ”
Bill surmounted its final obstacle. A
measure blessed by the Archbishop of
CANTERBURY, on the ground that it will
strengthen the national character of the
Church of England, and welcomed by
Lord HALDANE because, in his opinion,
it will turn the Church into a sect and
lead to its disestablishment, has obvi-
ously a great, if somewhat doubtful,
future before it.
In the Commons Sir AUCKLAND
GEDDEs admitted that there had been
an enormous increase in the importa-
tion of German toys, but, when pressed
to prohibit it in the interests of
British manufacturers, indicated that
such action was not immediately ur-
gent, remarking oracularly, “There are
toys and toys.” When a child, he him-
self, for example, was quite content
with a lump of coal as a plaything.
Having been otherwise employed last
Thursday, the PRIME MINISTER ap-
peared in the House this afternoon and
gave a great deal of miscellaneous but
not very detailed information. Thus, of
his conversations with M. CLEMENCEAU
the only definite result recorded was
that the French Government had been
given leave to float a loan in this
country. Hence, no doubt, the smile
on the face of the Tiger depicted in
last week's cartoon. Mr. BILLING's
untimely curiosity as to whether the
loan would be in the form of Premium
Bonds was not appeased. The peace-
offer conveyed by M. LITVINoFF to the
British Minister at Copenhagen had
been returned unopened (how did the
Government know it was a peace-
offer?), and the Bolshevists were told,
if they wanted peace, to seek it from
Generals KolTCHAK and DENIKIN.
As for Ireland there was to be no
Home Rule Bill this Session, but only
a statement “in outline " of what next
year's Bill would probably be. Mr.
DEVLIN's protest against the priority
given to the Irish Education Bill led Sir
Edward CARson to ask whether educa-
tion was not far more important than
Home Rule. There does not seem much
to choose between them if we accept the
Nationalist leader's retort that “the
more you educate the Irish people the
greater rebels they will become.”
Tuesday, December 16th.-The Lords
sat up till nearly midnight with the
Government of India Bill, which, de-
spite some severe criticisms by Lord
AMPTHILL, who described the author of
the measure as “a globe-trotting doc-
trinaire,” and an eleventh-hour attempt
by Lord MAcDoNNELL to eliminate the
“dyarchy,” was safely piloted through
Committee by Lord SINHA, himself the
strongest argument for its provisions
and the most hopeful augury of its
Success.
The Commons were surprised to learn
that there is one manual worker in
this country who has neither received
nor claimed increased remuneration
since the War, although he carries out
his duties with such efficiency that no
complaints are ever heard from those
for whom they are performed. His
case would long ere this, no doubt, have
been taken up by the Labour party,
but for a not unnatural reluctance to
stand on the same platform as the
Public Executioner.
Mr. Roberts cannot meet the request
for a reduction in the price of milk

Optimists credit her with a poten-
tial production of two gallons a day,

The Irish Education Bill was down
for second reading to-night, but the
Nationalist Members, knowing perhaps
that their Ulster brethren were very
anxious to further its progress, were
determined to delay it. So first, with
the assistance of the “Wee Frees” and
the Labour men, they secured leave to
move the adjournment in order to call
attention to the suppression of The
Freeman's Journal by the military
authorities in Ireland. And then, to
make assurance double sure, they set to
work to obstruct the Votes for the Air
Service and the Army.
Mr. E. KELLY, the Member for East
Donegal, particularly distinguished
himself. During the first part of the
Session, Ilearn from the Parliamentary
Gazette, he spoke only seven columns
of Hansard. This afternoon he more
than doubled his total output, and dis-
played an astonishing thirst for infor-
mation on such diverse questions as the
demobilisation of the W.R.A.F.'s, the
window-cleaning of barracks, the opti-
cal instruments supplied to pilots, the
charting of the atmosphere and the
commandeering of meadow-land for
aerodromes. By the copiousness of his
style and the artless manner in which
he cloaked irrelevance under the guise
of legitimate curiosity he recalled the
triumphs of the late Mr. J. G. BIGGAR.
So the night wore on, until at eight-
fifteen the adjournment motion came.
Comparatively little was said about
The Freeman's Journal. Mr. T. P.
O'Connor's speech was chiefly com-
posed of extracts from The Times, a
journal of which I should judge him to
be a more diligent student. Mr. ADAM-
son's was almost entirely devoted to
the hard case of the Irish motor-drivers,
who have elected to lose their liveli-
hood rather than apply for a Govern-
ment permit; and the Irish ATToRNEY-
GENERAL had professional scruples
against freely handling a case that is
sub judice. The Government had a
big majority in the ensuing division;
but the Nationalists had secured their
object, for it was by that time too late
to start the Education Bill.
Wednesday, December 17th. — Mr.
BoNAR LAwannounced that he could not
find further time for the Education Bill
this Session. Sir Edward CARson put in
a plea for the Irish teachers, thus robbed
of an increase in their emoluments;
and Mr. DEVLIN, perceiving that he had
allowed the Ulster leader to secure a
tactical advantage, jumped up to sup-
port his appeal. Mr. LAw, comment-
ing upon this sudden unanimity, dryly
observed that, as Mr. DEVILIN took so
much interest in the teachers, it was a
pity that he had not allowed their Bill
to come on last night.
It is fortunate that the MINISTER
FoR LABour is a Scotchman. A mere
Southron would not have known what
to make of an inquiry whether a certain
workman had, for failing to pay his
rates, been “threatened with diligence,”
and might have been tempted to reply
that he was very glad to hear it. But
Sir RoberT HoRNE, of course, knew
very well that “diligence” is Scots for
“distraint.”
Sir Robert was also called upon to
say why “immobile” members of the
Women's Corps were deprived of the
unemployment benefits accorded to
“mobile women” in the same corps,
and made serious and suitable reply.
But did I, or did I not, hear him hum-
ming under his breath, “La donna &
mobile "7
A long debate on the Appropriation
Bill might be summed up in a single
phrase from the CHANCELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER: “We had to repeat com-
monplaces until we really acted upon
them.”

priate, to the extent of his claim, any monies
standing to the debtor's credit at the bank.]
WAs it a lawyer who, with the im-
mortal incumbent of Eversley in his
mind, said, “It’s a fine day. Let's go
and writ somebody” 2
Anyway, that fine old sportsman,
Arbuthnot, of Arbuthnot Brothers, Sons,
Nephews, Pilkington and Arbuthnot, is
a great believer in this maxim. He
knows all the legal pack of sleuth-hounds
well, and has hunted many a time and
oft with them (one at a time, as is the
custom with this pack)—Writ, Sum-
mons, Affidavit, Discovery, Interpleader,
Distringas, Trespass, Order, Appear-
ance, Verdict, Judgment, Taxed Costs
and the rest. If he has a favourite
among them, though, it is Garnishee
—by Payment out of Bank Account.
In Self v. Jenkins more than half the
pack had run, but had failed to bring
down the quarry (Jenkins). I should
have let it (and Jenkins) go at that, but
| Arbuthnot's blood was up and he wired
me the following hunting fixture:–
“Thursday. Meet at Law Courts, 11.0.”
Arbuthnot and I rode up almost
simultaneously and dismounted (he
from Taxi, I from my more sober steed
—old Mobus), and we went straight
up to the Master and asked leave to
put Garnishee on the scent. Permis-
sion being given, Arbuthnot remounted
and the chase began.
The affair was too exciting for me
and I hacked quietly home on Mobus,
but from Arbuthnot's account the run
must have been a wonderful sight.
Jenkins, who had early got wind of
danger, broke cover, it seems, from Red
Lion Square (where he had lain doggo
for some time), ran through Gray's Inn
Passage, along Holborn and crossed the
Viaduct well ahead. Turning sharply
to the right through Old Bailey he
breasted Ludgate Hill, and by way of
the old Watling Street headed straight
for Barclay's Bank, where safety lay.
He didn't know, but, instinctively felt
that Garnishee was out for his blood.
Arbuthnot by another route, not
knowing the quarry had scented dan-
ger, and urging Taxi to the last two-
pence, hoped to head off his victim
before he could reach the Bank. Gar-
nishee, he said, was quite in order, but
should have been put on Sooner.
There was a view halloa by Budge
Row; Jenkins, his tongue hanging out,
was visibly tiring, and Arbuthnot
bribed Taxi to further efforts.
I'm sorry for Arbuthnot—personally,
I mean ; I don't care two straws for his
brothers, sons, nephews, the deluded
Pilkington, or the Arbuthnot who brings
up the rear (probably to keep Pilkington
from bolting)—because Jenkins, who
knows the country better, by devious
lanes and by-ways reached the Bank
first and had withdrawn, leaving no
trace (not even the scent of a Bradbury
or Fisher) by the time Arbuthnot rode
up with his beloved Garnishee; for
When they got there the ledger was bare
And so the poor hound got none.

A DEMOBILISED HUSTLER.
IN another sphere George's forceful
personality might have been a valuable
asset, but to appoint him caretaker and
doorkeeper of our local Natural History
Museum was akin to installing an elec-
tric dynamo to wind up a watch. It
was typical of his enthusiastic nature
that he immediately proposed to do-
nate to the institution his collection
of curios, comprising (a) a variety of
silk-woven postcards representing two
hands ſervidly clasped beneath the flags
of the Allies and inscribed “Souvenir de
France; ” (b) the handle of a rum-jar,
the remainder having been shattered
by a rifle bullet (at least that was
George's explanation of its non-arrival
in the front line, he being company-
runner at the time), and (c) a piece of
shrapnel alleged to have been extracted
from George's right tibia, a statement
that lacked confirmatory evidence.
George furthermore suggested that he
might in his official capacity deliver
short lectures describing them to vis-
itors, any profits resulting therefrom
being regarded as his particular per-
quisites.
Unhappily the Committee did not
see its way clear to accept George's
offer, which confirmed his impression
that they were a retrograde and re-
actionary body. George expressed this
conviction to Constable Gurney, his
ex-platoon sergeant, who was shelter-
ing in the museum lobby against the
inclemency of the weather.
“This ain't a museum,” said George;
“it’s a blessed mausoleum. There
ain't no punch about it. They carry on
with the same old show of stuffed
birdses and dusty skellingtons that they
'ad twenty years ago; an' the gate
receipts is dwindling to nothing. All
day I comb the cobwebs out of my
'air and brush the mould from my uni-
form. It's the most gorgeous monu-
ment of nothing doing I ever saw since
our old Sergeant Drummer was de-
mobilized.”
“You never was one for a quiet
life, George,” said the policeman, “else
you'd 'ave joined the Force. Let well
alone.”. - -
“Not for me. I've a certain pride
in being alive. What's wanted 'ere is
a few good posters an' a constant
change of programme. I've seen a
potty little museum in wakes-week
with only a two-'eaded calf or a five-
legged sheep drawing bigger money
than we do. But a natural 'istory
specimen hasn't got a chawnce of living
in one of our glass cases unless it can
perduce a certificate that it's been
dead at least twenty years, an' the
deader it is the 'igher it stands on the
pay list. I reckon the Committee is
elected the same way too.”
Constable Gurney proceeded on his
beat, feeling that George's stay at the
museum was not likely to be long, and
he was not surprised when the latter
hailed him a fortnight later and said
he was leaving at the end of the week.
“I gave you a month,” replied Gur-
ney. “'Ow did it 'appen?”
“The Committee of Somnambulists
find me too disturbing,” said George.
“First, I 'ad a bit of trouble with 'em
over the skellingtons. I pointed out
'ow they collected the dust, an' sug-
gested running 'em over with a clean-
ing rag an' a bit of blanco to freshen
'em up. They was horrified, an' said if
I laid a finger on any of the specimens
except in the way of kindness I'd have
to quit, an' stay quit. -
“Well, a few days later I was a bit
vigorous with one of the heggs—I dis-
remember its Latin name, but I think
they call it a Red-billed Wingo Bird's
Hegg—'an it crumbled up in my 'and.
It was about the size of a duck's hegg,
an' very rare, an' I'esitated about tell-
ing 'em. Instead I provided a sub-
stitoot. Never mind 'ow I got it—it
were a good substitoot, superior to my
mind than the original. A day or two
later an old gent—one of our few regu-
lar customers—was lookin' over our
collection of heggs, an' 'e spotted my
substitoot.
“‘Strange I never noticed that be-
fore,' 'e murmured. ‘A most remark-
able specimen of the Ovum Thingabob-
imus. I've never seen one before with
such vivid and well-defined markings.’
“'E went away in a state of great ex-
citement, and I reckon 'e must 'ave sent
the fiery cross an' tocsin amongst the
Associated Union of Orthinologists, for
the next few days our turnstiles was
clicking like a Cup Final. It was the
biggest boom in the whole of our natural
'istory, an' I expected every day the
Committee would turn over in its sleep
an' notice there was something doing.
Then interest began to die down a bit
an' the moss started sprouting again in
the lobby. - -
“‘This won't do, George,’ says I to
myself. “If you don't keep things mov-
ing the place will be dozing off again.
It's up to you to wake up the Siester
Society in spite of itself. If one hegg
is enough to draw a decent gate,’ says
I, “with a whole laying we ought to get
a regular riot.’
“So I made my preparations, an' I
set about it; but the Chairman unex-
pectedly 'appened to drift in just as I
was a-touching up all the heggs in our
collection with a paint-brush an' a few
tins of enamel, and --

OLD SIR ARCHIBALD.
A CHRISTMAS CAROL.
OLD Sir Archibald looked out
With a sense of grievance;
This was partly due to gout,
Partly to St. Stephen's;
Whitely lay the winter's snow;
Shone the moon with clarity;
Several people down below
Stood demanding charity.
Silver in a shining spate
From his hand departed;
Thereupon the eldest wait
Touched his cap and started:—
“Following ancestral use,
Sir, the village choir would
Much appreciate a goose
And some logs for firewood.”
“Hither, Alfred,” cried the Squire,
“Hie thee to the larder;
Give these men what they require,
Though the times be harder.”
Alfred's brain began to jump;
Thus his thoughts he fashioned:—
Is the old boy off his chump 2
Don't he know we're rationed 2
“Sir,” he said, “out there I see
Bill the breeches-maker;
Comfortably off is he,
So is Bert the baker;
Then there's that there 'Enery Meek
Runs a soda fountain,
Earns his eight pound ten a week,
And the profit's mountin'. . .
“Bring them port and caviare!
Bring them pearl and ruby
Each of them there blokes is far
Richer nor what you be;
Still, Sir, as you seem a bit
Keen on this yer giving,
There are some that's far more hit
By the cost of living.”
“Alfred,” said the grey-haired Bart.,
“After what you've hinted
I suppose I'll have to part;
No one shall be stinted;
When you've fed the village band
As in bygone ages,
Kindly close the window and
Take a rise in wages.”
Gentles who have been enthralled
By this simple ditty,
Imitate Sir Archibald,
On the poor have pity;
Yuletide, at which pedants scoff,
Need have no detractors,
Now it makes men better off
Than their benefactors.
Evoe.

A RATION OF PEARLS.
WHEN I was told that Emily Jane
had gone to a matinéeat a certain House
I had a conviction that she was not
aware that the usual variety show had
given place that afternoon to a per-
formance of The Trojan Women. As
she cleared away the remains of my
breakfast on the following morning she
entertained me with the following ver-
sion of her experiences:—
“. . . . An' that wos 'ow we never
rumbled they wosn’t givin' a proper
show, an' I ses to Perce we ain't 'arf
lite, and 'e ses never mind, and bort
two fortles. 'Arf-a-crahn each they
corst 'im. But I thort it funny to see
two clergymen walking into a music-
'all as bold as brass, an' I nudges
Perce; but 'e ses, wot of it, they like
their bit of fun, 'specially them wot's
bin chaplins. So I ses nuffink; but
wen we wos settled dahn in our seats
I see more parsons, and pile-ficed young
fellers wiv glasses, an' I thinks to me-
self, these ain't the kind to join in no
choruses, and Ises to Perce we bin 'ad.
“An' wen the show started, blimey
wot a set-aht ! No band, an' 'ardly any
scenery but some pillers. An' then 'er
wot wos the Queen went orf the deep
end somethink orful abaht 'er 'ardships,
an' grahsed abaht losin' the war for
a 'arf-hour on end . . . An' then a
norficer come 'an took a kid orf of his
ma. Pore little blighter, e' didn't 'arf
'ave to go froo the 'oop!” [A kind
heart beats beneath the rough exterior
of Emily Jane.] “Took 'im an' froo
'im 'orf of a cliff, they did. Me an'
Perce wos waiting to 'ear 'im bump,
but, lor, they wasn't up to no effecks like
that . . . An' that just started the ole
Queen orf agine. My, she didn't 'arf
lead orf abaht them soldiers ' "
“The Greeks,” I remarked.
“Yus, that's it, Greeks—a lot of
blighters, Perce ses; they done the dirty
on 'im too, in Salonika it wos, for two
drackmy in 'is chinge for some figs . . .
And then the flighty bit come on wot
wos the cause of orl the trouble; and
the Queen didn't 'arf tell 'er'orf neither;
she called 'er all the nimes she could
lay'er tongue to. Talk abaht getting the
bird . . . an' I ses to Perce, I ses, ‘’Ere
I'm abaht fed up, let's 'op it; ' but 'e
'ad a progrem wot said somethink abaht
some dances, and 'e set on an' on, 'opin'
against 'ope—as if they could dance wiv
no band an' all . . . An' so they kep'
on jawing an' walking abaht the marble
floor wiv no shoes nor stockings on—
not reel marble it wosn't, or it wouldn't
'arf have bin piccadilly for their plates
of meat.”
When Emily Jane lapses into rhym-
ingslang Ibecome filled with a cold fury.
“The fault is yours,” I said bitterly,
“if you did not appreciate the play.
It is the work of a Greek tragic poet
who lived over two thousand years ago.
The author is still the undisputed mas-
ter of pathos.”
“Two fahsand years ago!” she ex-
claimed as she vanished with the tray
and slammed the door. “No wonder
it's a back number. An’ if,” she con-
tinued, raising her voice stair by stair
as she descended—“an' if any of our
awfers tries to perdooce stuff like that,
wiv no joy-walk nor nuffink, you can
tike it from me it'll be a wash-out.”
And there, blushing for our genera-
tion, I find myself in complete agree-
ment with Emily Jane.

THE ACTIVE SERVICE SUPPLY CO., LTD.
As I fought my way in mufti through
the Strand scrum a few days ago an
individual with an air of rather cock-
a-hoop smartness, a velour hat on one
side of his head, a broad gold ring on
one finger, and a tie with the Artillery
thunder-and-lighting zig-zag colours,
caught my eye and spoke.
“Glad to see you so well, Sir.”
“Thank you, Hooley,” I replied.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you once
more.”
I knew him—oh, I knew him. The
worst bombardier in the old Battery,
but the best boxer; sometimes the per.
fect village idiot, sometimes, when it
suited his book (or shall I say his con-
duct sheet?), a suave and subtle diplo-
“Go on, Hooley; I become intrigued.”
“Thought you would, Sir. If I may
say so, we often used to wonder what
they'd allow young gentlemen like you
to do in civil life. This Company will
save you all a lot of worry. You're all
a little lost without a war. You've
all got to think for yourselves now, and
there's no Sergeant-Major to hold
your hand. I know the feeling myself,
in a humble way.”
“And what is your Company going
to do for us?”
“Why, in the first place to be a kind
of a registry; gentlemen on the look-
out for a war will have their names
down in our books; and other people
who have a promising war up their
sleeve, but nobody to develop it, will be
put in touch with them. I don't ima-
never yet been organised. We propose
to supply entertaining and remunerative
upheavals to suit every taste and of
every magnitude, from mere week-end
riots to important campaigns. On the
other hand, from our classified nominal
rolls we shall be able to provide the
agitator, the revolutionary and the
politician with his appropriate type of
partisan. A wide selection of fili-
busters, free lances and swash-bucklers
of every grade will be available.
“‘Shareholders need not necessarily
belong to any combatant category, but
it is proposed that a bonus should be
added to the dividend of those who
assist in earning it by active par-
ticipation in hostilities.’”
“The thing has an alluring sound,”
I said. “Drop me a line when your
mat. Turn and turn
about I used to tick
him off in the office,
and he to, amuse me
magnanimously with
the gloves. This rou-
tine was, I suppose,
frequently disturbed
by the Hun, but one's
memory is selective.
“What are you do-
ing with yourself now,
Hooley?” I inquired
after the usual ritual
of reminiscence. 2
“Well, Sir, I worked
at the docks for a
while, till the foreman
insulted the Army.
He said he could put

asked if he'd ever

The Little Man. “No, As A MATTER of FACT I Dox'T.

BUT FATHER 's Dows-
people have a really
nice war on hand, will
ou?”
“Delighted, Sir–if
you'll just pay your
first call on allotment;
half-a-crown per one
pound share, Sir.”
“But I thought it
wasn't necessary to be
a shareholder?”
“Ah, you've not
been attending. Share-
holders need not be
combatants, but com-
batants must be share-
holders.”
“Then I'll post-
pone my application,
Hooley.”
“For old times'
sake, Sir, let me put
you down for a couple
of shares at least—or
and he said, “No,” and I said, “Then
listen,” and knocked him off the dock-
side into a barge.”
“So now you're out of a job 2"
“I, Sir 2 You know me better. If
you can spare five minutes I'll tell you
what I'm doing, and I know you'll be
interested.”
Over a subterranean coffee and cigar-
ette Hooley expanded. From his breast
pocket he produced, and with a knuckly
hand flattened upon his knee, what
looked like a prospectus. The politician
manqué replaced the light-hearted
pugilist and bent himself to exegesis.
“Well then, Sir, I'm helping to float
the Active Service Supply Company,
Limited.”
“Seems the wrong time to find a
market for kit, Hooley 2”
The ex-bombardier twirled his mous-
tache and smiled. “You’ve got the
wrong end of the stick, Sir. We don't
supply the kit for the active service,
but the active service for the kit.”
gine you yourself have any idea of the
interesting troubles active in the world
at present. The Press isn't paid to
advertise them—not the smaller ones
—and the public has no chance of
participating.”
“But, my dear Hooley, surely there
aren't always wars going on 2"
“And if they run short, what then,
Sir? This here prospectus—this pro-
spectus—says, “Should the Company be
as largely supported as there is every
reason to anticipate, a fund will be set
aside for such an emergency as universal
peace. It will be for the shareholders
to decide whether this fund should be
distributed in the form of unemployment
pensions, or devoted to the provision
and fostering of casus bellis between
suitable Powers.'”
“The latter
finance,” I said.
“Besides being more sportsmanlike,”
said Hooley. “But listen again: ‘The
market for soldiers of fortune has
seems like sounder
make it half-a-crown.”
“We'll call it half-a-crown then,
Hooley. Why didn't you come to it
quicker? And now you'd better go
and apologise to the foreman.”

message which interrupts the current

where the real fineness of “RoNNIE's "self was appreciated
by his intimates, but throughout the vast throng that in
pre-war days followed the fortunes of English football, there
is no counting the number of those who must have felt his
death as a loss personal and acute. RoNALD W. Poulton-
PALMER (the last name a late addition under the will of his
uncle, to whose great business at Reading he was to have
succeeded) was born in September 1889, and killed in
Flanders, either by a sniper or a chance shot, on May 5th,
1915. The whole of his adolescent life is a record of
athleticism and of increasing social service. Rugbeians and
Balliol men will naturally read it with especial interest. It
is above all striking to notice how, at school, much of the
traditional spirit of “muscular Christianity” seems to have
survived, or been revived, in Poulton and his circle, so that
some passages in the Rugby chapters read as though they
might have been written by ToM HUGHES. I have no space
to tell of the work with boys' clubs that claimed so much of
his holiday times, or of the international matches (de-
scribed most graphically here), in which the amazing runs
and still more the inspiring personality of the English
captain are already a legend. Many will read this book,
mourning a great player and a worker of splendid promise.
When you start to carry out a definite programme and
don't complete it I suppose you're generally considered to
have failed, and if Sir ERNEST SHACKLEton's Expedition is
to be judged in this way it must be counted a failure. But
I like to remember that high failure is a better thing than low
success, and after reading South (HEINEMANN) I do not think
that anyone will be found to complain that Sir ERNEST's
aim was not high enough. I am not concerned to argue
with those who deny the usefulness of Polar Exploration.
I will just ask them to read this volume and see if they
can't be stirred by the spirit of adventure which it
breathes. Sir ERNEST's attempt to solve certain geographical
problems was first, last and all the time a sporting one.
Misfortune met him and his gallant companions consider-
ably more than half-way, and after his ship, Endurance,
was defeated by the ice of the Weddell Sea they were beset
by extreme and perpetual peril. It is a wonderful tale and
gains much from the style of its telling. Sir ERNEST can
claim to be at least something of a literary artist, on the
ground that he is always direct and spontaneous. Illus-
trations as excellent as the text are given abundantly, and
the book is so admirably produced that I must include its
publishers in this message of congratulation.
I congratulate Lt.-Col. W. D. CROFT on a very effective and
soldierlike piece of work, Three Years with the 9th (Scottish)
Division (MURRAY). It is an admirable record of the Start,
1915; Plugstreet Wood, The Somme, Vimy Ridge, 1916;
Arras, Havrincourt, Ypres, 1917; Gauche, Gouzeaucourt,
the German Offensive, the Bloody Salient again, Meteren

and Hoogenacker Ridge, 1918; and lastly, “Blue Bonnets
Across the Border,” 7th December, 1918. A more graphic
reminder of the fighting of the Great War, an element of
it we tend to forget, I have rarely come across; the gallant
author's natural and extremely crisp style compels atten-
tion, and his sense of humour is always apparent. Many
will appreciate with gratitude his record of a “carpeting"
of a certain ubiquitous ex-Minister of War (not WINSTON).
My only regret is that the author seems to think that there
is no other division like his own in the British army. Every
good soldier may and should think like that... Colonel CROFT
produces evidence to prove his case; he relies partly upon
the testimony of the ex-Kaiser and partly upon his own de-
preciation of praise lavished on rival divisions. But in a
writer who should be strictly impartial this is bad; it has
the inevitable effect of making the reader tire of this division
and all other things Scottish. . . . Let that pass, however,
and let all ranks read the book, together with the lay public.
If they can, let them write an equally good account of their
and tears, and I am sure that all the truly real people who,
in defiance of the warning I have kindly given them, ask
for it at the libraries, will find that they can't read it and
will send it back indignantly. But the other people will
enjoy it immensely and feel more at home with if than they
have felt with any novel since Miss BENson's last. I hardly
like to mention it, as it may be a symptom of approaching
realness, but I do wish that she hadn't let “our witch"
fight the German one, both mounted on broomsticks, during
an air raid, and I cannot feel that the macabre incident of
the dead who mistook a bomb on their graves for the last
trump really fits in; but, after all, these are trifles. Even a
Miss STELLA BENSON has to have some sort of incident to
account for having told you all about her characters; and
with them, particularly Sarah Brown and her “very wieldy
family,” David, her Dog, and Humphrey, her Suit-case, I
have no fault to find at all.
As “TAFFRAII,” has an apparently inexhaustible supply
equally good units. If their
books are up to sample I
will read the lot.
I am rather afraid that,
in spite of its title, you may
not find AGNEs and EGER-
ToN CASTLE's New Wine
(CoLLINs) very conspicu-
ously novel, either in theme
or manner. The peasant-
bred hero, called to high
estate, and by his native
virtues generally confound-
ing the knavish tricks of
the Smart—this in epitome
was the career of Shane,
otherwise Lord Kilmore—
is a figure at least as old as
the eighteenth century. I
think his authors deserve
credit for a sincerity of pur.
pose that just, though only
just, holds him above the
waves of unintentional hu-
mour. It would have been
so fatally easy to submerge

of intriguing things to say,
and knows exactly how to
say them, it is not remark-
able that his books are wel-
comed by myriads of ad-
mirers. In H.M.S. Anonym-
ous (JENKINs) he gives us
a few stories of destroyers
before the War, and then
passes on to incidents in
his own career from 1914
to 1918. For two and a-half
years he was in command
of a destroyer attached to
the Harwich Force, and sub-
sequently joined the Battle
Cruiser Force at Rosyth.
Wherever he was or what-
ever he might be doing he
preserved such a clear judg-
ment of men and matters
that anything he likes to tell
us has a real and peculiar
value. Referring to the
German sailors he writes,
“Though they were work-
ing under the orders of a

the poorlad. I rather doubt whether I need tell you in detail
how Shane falls a victim to a siren with soulful eyes and a
brutal husband; how they are about to elope (all this time
the original charmer of his bare-foot days goes on reflecting
upon yet another injustice to Ireland) and are saved in the
nick of time; and all the rest of it. Eventually, after the
long arm of war has brought Shane as a cot-case to Lady
Hobson's hospital, and he has escaped even from that, the
hunted one bolts back to Ireland, home and beauty, with
her tenacious ladyship hot on his heels—and perhaps at
this point the sustaining clasp of the CASTLEs does let him
under for a moment. However, even if the final scene
hardly leaves you properly impressed, you may still thank
them for a sound, workmanlike and reliable tale, such as
will keep no one awake o' nights, and may, on the con-
trary, delude many into thinking that stories like that must
be very easy to write—which is by no means the case.
If you want to enjoy Living Alone (MACMILLAN) you
must read it not so much in the light of reason as by the
touch of sympathy. Miss STELLA BENson says herself that
it isn't a “real book" written for “real people,” and I quite
agree with her. It is a magic book made out of laughter
Higher Command their senseless brutality can never be
condoned; but it must be admitted that they were brave.
Chivalrous or gallant they certainly were not, but brave—
yes.” I heartily recommend a book which offers fresh testi-
mony to the greatness of our Navy, and does it without a
suspicion of bombast.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TALKING CINEMA.
A RECENT announcement in the daily
papers states that a Swedish scientist
has perfected a talking cinema, in which
the reproduction of sound synchronizes
with the action. Of course the idea is
not new, though hitherto none of the
experiments has been quite successful.
Mr. Bertram Boom, the managing
director of Movieland, Limited, when
interviewed regarding the latest dis-
covery, gave non-committal answers;
but he was more communicative to a
few friends one evening after dinner.
“I’m all for progress—mauve dress-
suits, increased referees' fees and all
that sort of thing,” he said; “but I wish
the venerable Swede had left the picture
proposition alone. When I heard about
it I sent for Flickers, my producer.
“‘See here, Flickers,' I said, “it’s
always been our aim to move so far
ahead of the times that the leaves of the
office calendar get singed keeping pace
with us. We've got to be on this.'
“Flickers chewed his gum in a lateral
direction which I knew meant disap-
proval.
“‘Well, what's the trouble 2' I in-
quired impatiently.
“‘Jest this,' he replied gloomily.
‘We’ve got the finest team ever from
a pictorial standpoint, but vocally—
well, a glee party from Mudville, New
Hampshire, would sound like grand
opera to us.'
“‘They won't have to sing,' I said.
“‘Thank goodness for that. But
jest talking doesn't help us any. Take
Rick Reckless, f'rinstance, who features
our “Mustang Mike” series. He's got
a face that might have been chipped
from the Rocky sierras, wears fringed
trousers, sombreros, lariats an’ red
flannel shirts like they've growed on
him, and rides and shoots equal to the
hardest-bit Texan cow-puncher; but
when he starts putting over larynx
sounds all the audience 'll know his
accent couldn't come from anywhere
but Islington, U.K.’
“‘He can learn his part, like a stage
actor.'
“‘I should worry. Stage actors
don't have to get it over the footlights
whilst jumping precipices and riding
under express trains. If our team
have to start thinking about vowel
sounds and accented syllables they'll
lose pep. Besides, what about Queenie
Gibsmere, the Fascinating Flapper ?
We pay her a million dollar salary
becos she's got the soulfullest eyes
an' dinkiest dimple in Picturedom, but
you know as well as I do that she talks
through her nose an' drops aitches till
she's standing knee-deep in 'em at the
end of five minutes' conversation.’
“‘I know, I know !' I groaned.
“But we can't afford to be out of the
movement. I'll see the patentees and
arrange a trial trip on a scenario of our
own making. We won't come to a de-
cision on one of their window-dressed
productions. Meanwhile your job is
to engage a Professor of Elocution and
persuade the troupe to take up voice-
culture.'
“A week later Flickers reported pro-
gress like a ship's carpenter announc-
ing another six inches of water in the
hold.
“‘Why I should be a producer when
there's honest work to be got loading
coal barges, I don't know,” he said.
“I broke it to Rick first. ‘My dear old
ruminant,' he murmured, “I’ll drop from
parachutes or slide down avalanches,
but as for talkin' I'm not takin' any.”
But I argued till I persuaded him, an’
now he's studying BRET HARTE and
GEORGE ADE to get atmosphere an'
chewin' filberts to harden his throat.'
“‘And what about Queenie?' I asked.
Flickers groaned. ‘Diffidence wasn't
her strong suit. “I'd love to 'ave a
speaking part 1" she said when I told
her. “I’ve often thought I'd make a
'eavenly Juliet !” I guess you knew
what you were about when you pushed
the job on to me of telling a pampered
star that her jewels of speech want
considerable polishin' up and re-settin'
before we could exhibit 'em to the
public l'
“Flickers grouses, but he gets things
done, so I let him have his head.
“Business called me away from the
studios for about a week, and when I
returned Flickers, looking aged but
triumphant, said he'd succeeded in
reeling off a few hundred feet of sound
film and was ready to give me a private
view that minute. “Right-o!’ said I,
leading the way to our private theatre.
‘I'm pressed for time, so just reel off a
bit where the plot's thickest, and we'll
give our decision right away.'
“Flickers having arranged the phono-
graph attachment and turned down the
lights, a picture was projected on to the
screen showing Rick and Queenie stand-
ing in the middle of the boundless
prairie that we rent from the Eden Gar-
den City Corporation. Then the phono-
graph started buzzing and I nearly
jumped from my seat, for it sounded
just as though the figures on the screen
were talking. The dialogue went:—
“Rick. I'm only a doggoned ornery
dead-beat, Miss Maisie, but I'd stake
my last cent to call you my own prairie
blossom.
“Queenie. Oh, Mike, how I 'ave—
have longed for this hour.
“A Voice. Shassy across, Rick, and
put a strangle hold on her, and we'll
have the sob and slow music busi-
ness,
“In the gloom I heard Flickers make
a profane exclamation. ‘The Voice’
was his; he had forgotten that, though
you may put blinkers on a camera, you
can't gag a phonograph. The film went
on relentlessly:-
“Rick. Is that sure gospel, Maisie,
or are you putting a bluff on me?
“Queenie. My own 'ero—
“Operator. Would you mind backing
a yard this way, Miss Gibsmere? You're
getting out of focus.
“This was too much for Flickers.
“‘Switch on the lights and shove
something down that blamed buzzy-
motor's throat ' ' he shouted. Then he
turned to me. “I hand in my resigna-
tion, guv'ner. I’m for a course of
finger-talking at a deaf-mute school an'
some instruction in the Morse Code
before I pose again as a producer under
these conditions.'
“‘Don't you worry, Flickers,’ said I
soothingly. “Come round with me to
see the patentees.'
“‘What for?' he cried, clutching at
my sleeve in despair. “Not to buy the
rights?'
“‘No,' I answered.
“To pay them
hush-money.’”
OUR COMING GUEST.
Soon will the parting year be sped
And lips shall falter, “Fuit,”
Then swift proclaim you in his stead
As loud as they can do it;
He had his chance—for him '18
Had neatly knocked the Bosch out—
Yet proved the merest might-have-been,
The most amazing wash-out.
He promised well—indeed, too much ;
Alackaday, poor fellow,
Each project at his palsied touch
Turned prematurely yellow;
So, as he passes on the way
All years must tread at his age,
Thank Heaven I'll see no more, I say,
His sour and peevish visage.
And you? I know not what you bring
By way of care or laughter,
Until you too have taken wing
Up to old Time's hereafter;
Mayhap you'll set a tougher task,
With strikes and such in plenty;
Still, at your birth this boon I ask:
“Be sweet as well as '20.”

I BELIEVE one gets hardened to it in
time. I have heard of men who can
use a slipper on their offspring while
they peruse the morning paper.
“Where's Chris 2 " I said when I
reached home.
“John,” said Joan, “he's been very
naughty and he's had to go to bed. I
told him I should tell you about it.”
“The young beggar ! What's he
been doing?”
Well, there was no doubt about it, he
had been running amok, and—well, I
realised what was expected of me as a
Man and a Father.
“I’ll go up and see him at once,” I
said in my sternest voice.
Joan seized me by the arm and began
to talk hurriedly.
“I think, if you just go and talk to
him—I’m sure he's sorry, really
John, you won't—”
“Woman,” I said, “don’t be weak
and foolish. The boy must be taught
discipline. This is a case for firm
handling. Once we overlook this ten-
dency to self-determination n >
As I went upstairs I pictured Joan,
poor girl, with her head in a cushion
trying to stifle the sounds of anguish
from above. But I pulled myself to-
gether and went on.
Outside Christopher's bedroom I
stopped to think. How should I tackle

Now or never. “Yes, Christopher,
it is,” I said, walking into his room.
“Hoo ! Doesn't it sound funny when
you call me ‘Christopher.' Doesn't
sound like me, does it 2."
“Perhaps not,” I said feebly; “but that
doesn't matter. I've come to talk to you.”
“I thought you had,” said Chris.
And then after a long pause—“What
shall we talk about 2."
I felt that I had better treat this as
an opening.
“We will talk about a little boy
whose father was away all the day
working. And one day, instead of
trying to help his mother, the little
boy—”
“What was this little boy's name?”
asked Chris suspiciously.
“Never mind that now.”
“I know.”
“No, you don't.”
“Yes, I do.”
Heavens, this wouldn't do. I pulled
myself together.
“Stop talking, Chris, and listen to
me.”
“Bet his name's ‘Chris,'
muffled voice.
“Ah!” I said, “so you know what
I've come to say to you, do you?”
“I think so,” said the small voice,
grown suddenly serious.
“Well, what do you think I ought to
do about it 2."
“Dunno,” said Chris, beginning to
count his fingers.
“Don't you think I ought to be very
angry 2”
“Mother's been that already.”
“Well, aren't you ashamed of mak-
ing Mother angry?”
Christopher came out from the bed-
clothes and sat up in desperation.
“I've been bein’ sorry for hours and
hours and hours, but there wasn't no-
body here to see me doin' it,” he said
tragically. And then, after a pause—

did the trick, really; although he looked
absurdly small in bed, anyhow.
“Well, we'll tell Mother how sorry
you are and then forget all about it, old
man. But it mustn't happen again,"
I finished weakly.
Christopher heaved a sigh of relief.
“’N could I have a drink of water

When I went downstairs again half-
an-hour later I found Joan sitting by
the fire.
“Well?” she asked brightly, looking
up from a novel. I felt she had hardly
played her part. I coughed slightly.
“I don't think you will have any
more of that trouble with him. I've-

“Yes, I know you have, you silly old
dear,” said Joan. “I’ve been listening

Before the fires were cool in the

Sharing the shelves where their masters
slept,
Tearing the bones that their masters
tore.

Auntie. “HAVE YOU READ AEOUT THAT PRE-HISTORIC MONSTER WHICH was supposed To HAVE BEcoME ExTINCT AGES AGo, BUT
HAs JUST BEEN SEEN IN CENTRAL AFRICA 2"
Algy. “YEs—A KIND of RIP WAN WINKLE, wasN'T IT?"
A untie. “WAS IT? OH, I THoughT IT was sometHING MUCH LARGER THAN THAT.”
A PATENT AMATEUR.
JUST now there is a wave of inventiveness passing over
the country. If you don't believe me ask the Patent Office.
Perhaps the vast army of people who first thought of Tanks
are beginning to think again. Or probably it's a sort of
germ that might attack anyone.
Certainly it surprised us when it broke out in William.
Being a journalist, he is not, as a rule, given to deep think-
ing; and when he began to be abstracted, profoundly medi-
tative, almost sullen, with an apparent desire to be alone,
we thought at first it was the onset of hydrophobia. In fact
we looked it up on the back of the dog-licence to make sure.
William's remarks now became irrelevant. For example,
after being wrapped in silence for over half an hour, he sud-
denly flung out the question, “How many people do you
know who possess a trousers-press?”
Faced with the problem, I confessed I could not connect
a single acquaintance with a trousers-press. “Henry hasn't
got one,” I admitted.
“Neither have I,” said William ; and he went on to remark
that he knew many men in many walks of life, and only
two of them owned a trousers-press, and they shared it
between them. Yet the inventor of this apparently neg-
ligible article had made a small fortune out of the idea.
“If,” concluded William, “you can make a small fortune
out of a thing that you can dispense with, how much more
can you make out of something that you can't do without 2."
This sentence I give as William composed it, and from
its construction you will observe that he had ceased to be
a journalist from that hour. You see, when you're an
inventor you can't be anything else. It takes all your
time. Judging by William's procedure you must sit up
experimenting all night long ; you lie down in your clothes
and snatch a little sleep at odd moments. When you walk
abroad you stride along muttering, waving your arms and
bumping into people; you forget to eat; your friends fall
away from you. Let me advise parents who are thinking
of a career for their sons never to make inventors of them.
It's a dog's life. Far better to put them to something with
regular hours, say from 10.30 to 4 o'clock, which leaves
them with the evenings free.
William wouldn't divulge what his invention was because,
he said, he was afraid of the idea getting about before he
took out the patent. He merely told us it was a device
which no man living could do without. But he went so far
as to show us the inner workings of his discovery (herein-
after referred to as It), which, not knowing what they were
for, rather mystified us. I know there was a small suction
valve which involved the use of water, because William
demonstrated to us one Sunday afternoon in the drawing-
room. He said afterwards that the unexpected deluge that
broke over the politely interested faces gathered round him
was merely due to a leakage in the valve, and he set to
work to repair it at once.
At that time William always carried on his person a
strange assortment of screws, metal discs, springs, bits of
rubber and the like. He pulled them out in showers when
he took out his handkerchief; they dripped from him when
he stood up. I think he kept them about him for inspira-
tion.
William completed It in a frenzy of enthusiasm. He

said that nothing now stood between him and a vast for-
tune, and in a mood of reckless generosity he promised us
all shares, which tended to deepen, if that were possible,
our interest in the invention. Then he betook himself to
the Patent Office.
I saw him the following day, and it occurred to me at
once that all was not well with William. For one thing he
did not burst in unannounced with hair dishevelled, which
seems to be the usual way for an inventor to come into a
room; he entered slowly and sat down heavily.
“Is anything wrong with the invention?” I asked.
He pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his brow.
A metal disc fell out and rolled unheeded across the floor.
“Nothing is wrong with It,” he answered dully.
“You don't mean that someone else has thought of It -
before you?”
“Most people seem to have thought of it.” He paused
and absently plucked off a stray piece of rubber from his coat-
sleeve. “It seems to have originated in America in 1880.
Then a large colony of German inventors applied for the
patent; a body of Russians were imbued with the idea;
several Scandinavians had variations of it. It even seems
to have filtered into the brain of certain West African
tribes; and as late as 1918 a Czecho-Slovak ” He
paused, overcome with emotion.
“But if It is a thing man can't do without, why haven't
we heard of it 2." I demanded.
“Men,” replied William sadly, “seem determined to do
without It. They don't know what is good for them.”
Suddenly he raised his head with the light of enthusiasm
in his eyes. “By the way, I was talking to a chap at the
Patent Office who told me that there's an enormous boom
in inventing in this country just now. I'm going to get
a good article out of it. How does this sound: “Has the
War Made us Inventive?' with a catchy sub-heading like
“Patent Officials Snowed Under'? I tell you it's good stuff.”
I breathed a sigh of relief. William had become a
journalist again.
THE WOES OF A GEORGIAN.
I KNow a most gifted young Georgian bard
Whose fate from the first has been cruelly hard,
For, though he performs most anarchical feats,
His early admirers compared him to KEATs.
So to rescue their minds from fatuity's brink
He wrote in vers libre a fantasia on Drink;
But his eulogists found in its atmosphere drab
A wonderful spirit resemblance to CRABBE.
But the climax was reached when he published a book
In unscannable verse called “The Songs of a Crook,”
And an erudite scribe in The Times (the Lit. Supp.)
Compared him to WILLON. That filled up the cup.
Then he penned a strange ode on the beauty of Tanks,
So outré it grievously shocked Mr. SHANKS,
Till the LAUREATE found that its metrical plan
Was forestalled by an ode of the reign of QUEEN ANNE.
I have tried, not in vain, so I fervently hope,
To solace his soul with this comforting dope:
“They may find your psychology Plesiosaurian,
But they never can say that you're Early Victorian.”

COMEDIES FOR COSTUMIERS.
THE quaint old idea that the play's
the thing has long been démodé. To-day
the only thing that counts is the dresses;
the plo's of comedies are just so many
clothes-dummies, and it is the costumier,
and not the author, who should by right
be called before the curtain. All this
makes it the more astonishing that the
dialogue takes no cognisance of , an
actress's frocks; that the real essentials
of a play are left to speak for them-
selves. It is by way of an attempt to
correct this curious conspiracy of silence
that the following skeleton of a costume-
comedy is obtruded:—
SELF-FXBRESSION.
ACT I.
Scex E.—Lady Cecilia's drawing-room.
Enter a parlourmaid, ushering in
Miss Browne-Jones and an attendant
gentleman. -
Maid. I'll tell Lady Cecilia you're
here. [Eacit.
Miss Browne-Jones. How surpris-
ingly well that girl's dress fits'. It posi-
tively might have been cut in Bond
Street. How do you like my squirrel
cap, Jim 2
Jim. Charming, charming. Er—
about this little affair
Miss B. J. It suits me, doesn't it 2
Fur is so endearing, I always think.
Jim. Top-hole. I say
Miss B.-J. And what about my coat?
Isn't that little intervention of mole
absolutely it?
Jim (absently). H'm—yes. Did you
say it was found in the dustbin’?
Miss B.-J. My coat! In the dustbin
Jim. No, no. The letter from Lord
Smallhold to Lady Cecilia.
Miss B.-J. Oh, that. Yes, in the
dustbin. So like Sir Maurice to go
prying about. But Cecilia doesn't know
he knows, you know.
[They discuss the incriminating
letter, which is unimportant from
our point of view. -
Enter Lady Cecilia. She is wearing
a fascinating little frock of henna-
coloured tricolette that is characterised
by a marked simplicity deceptive only
to the ignorant.
Miss B.-J. (with a little shriek of
delight). My dear Cecilia! Where did
you get it?
Jim. Gowned to perfection as usual,
Lady Cecilia.
Lady Cecilia. That's too sweet of
you, Jim. How are you both 2 (In
response to Miss B.-J.'s hungry gaze)
Rather nice, isn't it 2 -
Miss B.-J. (awe-struck). Nice! It's
inspiring. Your dressmaker is a genius.
[At this point the audience, refer-
ring to their programmes for the
name of the costumier and find-
ing they cannot see, will make a
mental note to look again when
the lights go up. Meanwhile
trifling affairs are discussed on
the stage.
Enter Sir Maurice, a heavy-looking
man of about fifty.
Sir Maurice (after the usual greetings,
playfully). Miss Browne-Jones, I can
see you have been shopping in Paris.
Miss B.-J. (gratified). Wrong again.
I got these at a little place in South
Doulton Street.
Sir M. Another triumph for home-
grown industries.
Re-enter Parlourmaid.
Maid. Please, m' lady, may, Cook
have a word with you?
Lady C. Certainly. (Exit parlour-
maid. To the others) Excuse me, but
she'll give notice if I don't go at once.
[Eacit Lady Cecilia. When she
re-enters Miss Browne-Jones and
Jim have left and Sir Maurice
is alone. Lady C. is garbed in
a dazzling tea-gown of golden
tissue that peeps out provoca-
tively from a veiling of flame-
coloured chiffon. It is held at
the waist by a plaited belt of
purple, green and orange silk,
culminating in a jade ornament.
The seams are emphasized by
beads, which repeat themselves
delightfully on her shoes. The
resulting effect is such a master-
piece of daring yet harmonious
colour-blends that Sir Maurice
and the audience forget all about
the Cook.
Sir M. Hullo | That 's new, eh?
Lady C. Of course it's new.
Sir M. (walking round her). It's a
very remarkable—er—creation, is it
not ?
Lady C. Wery. You see, dear, you're
so impossibly bourgeois that it's up to
me to do my little best to brighten the
fireside, isn't it 2
Sir M. Quite, quite. Especially when
coal is so scarce. Very thoughtful of
you, I'm sure.
Lady C. Marguérite says I have a
positive gift for wearing expensive
frocks. And one mustn't hide one's
gifts, must one?
Sir M. (suddenly remembering the
plot, sternly). No, nor one's letters
—in the dustbin.
Lady C. (turning white, if possible).
In the dustbin’?
CURTAIN.
ACT II.
SCENE.—Miss Browne-Jones's drawing-
room at tea-time. Miss Browne-Jones
strikes the right note with a black velvet
frock whose sobriety is only relieved
by brick-red buttons. Mrs. Vaughan-
Smith has an air of chic in her seal
wrap with kimono sleeves combined
with a black satin hat underlined
with gold lace.
Miss Browne-Jones. Yes, the poor dear
has taken refuge with me. Sir Maurice
said such things—about Lord Small-
hold, you know—she was quite shat-
tered. Have you seen her latest after-
noon gown 2
Mrs. Vaughan-Smith. No. Has she
brought it with her ?
Miss B.-J. Naturellement. Oh, you
should see it ! It's in copper-beech
crépe de chine, and the folds are—I
can't describe them—they just twine
themselves round your heart! And the
sleeves are the merest reminder. I do
so hate sleeves that shout out they're
there; don't you?
[Enter Lady Cecilia, wearing the
gown in question. She stands
gracefully in the doorway for a
second or two.
Miss B.-J. There ! Now isn't it—?
Mrs. V.-S. (solemnly). I have some-
times dreamt of frocks like that.

didn't sleep a wink last night. I was

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, December 22nd.—Although
this was the eve of the Prorogation,
His speech, if not lively in tone or
brilliant in style, was eminently busi-
nesslike. Almost the only purple patch
was a quotation from Father FLANA-
Parliament was unable to act upon the GAN, formerly Vice-President of Sinn
schoolboy maxim, “Last day but one,
take it all in fun.” On the contrary,
grave events were under discussion in
both Houses. In the Lords a harrow-
ing tale of the distress in Central
Europe came from Lord BRYCE, and
was followed by an earnest appeal from
Lord READING that this country,
without waiting for the Allies,
should send relief to Austria. In-
felix. Lord CURzoN had to remind
him that it was necessary to temper
mercy with justice. We had already
spent twelve and a-half millions on
the relief of European distress and
must think a little of our own needs.
Taking this admonition to heart
the Peers thereupon gave a Second
and Third Reading to the Old Age
Pensions' Bill, despite a protest
from Lord BUCKMASTER. He was,
I think, a warm supporter of the
Parliament Act, which deprived the
Upper House of all power over
finance, but he did not allow that
little circumstance to deter him
from rebuking the Government for
not imposing additional taxation to
meet the ten millions a year thus
added to the national expenditure.
The Commons met in an atmo-
sphere of mingled gloom and curi-
osity. Two hundred and thirty-
two Questions on the Order Paper
testified to their curiosity. The
gloom was chiefly caused by the re-
cent distressing events in Ireland.
Wiscount CURzoN endeavoured to
relieve it by requesting some re-
laxation of the liquor restrictions
during the holiday season; but this
gallant attempt to increase the
spirit of Christmas was unsuc-
cessful.
Two weary hours were spent in
the almost mechanical process of
agreeing to the Lords' amendments
to the Electricity and Housing Bills
(why doesn't the House take its non-
contentious business as “read " ?), and
Members were already pretty well tired
when the PRIME MINISTER rose to make
yet one more attempt to settle the Irish
Question, which has baffled all his pre-
decessors for more than a century. It
was plain that he “felt his position
acutely.” Probably he missed the
challenging interruptions of Mr. DEVLIN
and his little band of followers, who on
this occasion were ostentatiously ab-
sent. Or he may have been oppressed
by the feeling that where GLADSTONE
failed twice and Mr. Asquit H once even
he might not succeed.
Fein, protesting against the coercion of
Ulster. As little but the unexpected hap-
pens in Ireland the most hopeful feature
of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's scheme is that
he does not anticipate a welcome for it
from any Irishman. Since it endows

ically defined—with a Parliament that
it does not want, refuses to the Sinn
Feiners the Republic for which they
profess to be pining, and is based upon
the partition of Ireland, which every
Southern Irishman positively loathes,
he is likely to be justified in his vaticina-
tion. On the other hand the financial
provisions furnish so much solid pud-
ding for the new Legislatures that it is
possible that Irishmen, who are not all
the selfless idealists that they like us
to imagine them, may come to the con-
clusion that they might go further and
fare worse.
It was noticeable that Sir EDWARD
CARson, though he still affirmed that
Ulster only wanted to be let alone, and
drew a lurid picture of what might
happen under a Sinn Fein Administra-
tion, did not absolutely bar and bolt
the door against the scheme, but gave
an assurance—very necessary in the
circumstances—that he was not “try-
ing to discourage the PRIME MINISTER."
He was, at any rate, as helpful as
Sir DoNALD MACLEAN, who thought the
PRIME MINISTER did not go far enough,
and vaguely urged “big and open-
handed action; ” or as Mr. HEN-
DERSON, who still hankered after
the Home Rule Act of 1914, which
no one in Ireland will have at any
price; or as Mr. ACLAND, whose
pious hope was that the Sinn Feiners
would come and state their position.
General CROFT was of opinion that
the Government might as well offer
“a pill to Vesuvius” as this scheme
to Sinn Fein, and yet immediately
afterwards twitted the Unionists
with having deserted their prin-
ciples at a moment when they had
been proved overwhelmingly right.
Thus the scheme was born into a
chilly atmosphere, but, as it is going
into cold storage for the next two or
three months, that may not matter
much.
Tuesday, December 23rd.—Bar-
ring a few Questions, none of them
of vast importance, the only busi-
ness before the Commons was the
resolution carrying over the War
Emergency Laws (Continuance)
Bill into the Session of 1920. This
measure was intended to prolong
the existence of D.O.R.A., now near-
ing her allotted span, and naturally
created no enthusiasm outside the
Government Departments. Even
Mr. BonAR LAw added to his plea
of necessity a hope that in her
next incarnation D.O.R.A. would
be considerably reduced in size.
But the House still jibbed at the
proposal, and, when Mr. Hogg|E's
protest was endorsed by that grave
and reverend Tory, Mr. EveLYN
CECIL., Mr. LAw consented to withdraw

STRENUOUS DAYS.
WHAT quiet restful times they seem
as I look back at them now, those
moments at Shingle-sur-Mer, when
the October days darkened and we
played together after tea on Satur-
day afternoons, Richard, Priscilla and
I. It was a motor-bus sometimes that
caught our dramatic fancy, the cumber-
some motor-bus that plied all summer
between the coastal towns; there would
be a heavy plunge on to the sofa's fail-
ing springs, brisk business with a hand-
bell and some “really” tickets, and
then “a accident,” and we rolled in a
happy heap on the floor. And when I
had been bandaged with handkerchiefs
and brought to the sofa hospital, we
would put out in the sofa-boat to
sea, the weather growing rougher and
rougher till Richard showed signs of
acute distress—a powerful rendering
and more vivid even than life, as all
true art must be—and then the wreck
came and we tumbled off and wallowed
on the carpet waves. “I swimmih',”
Priscilla used to say on these occa-
sions. “You swim too.”
A gentle over-arm stroke without
any leg-action to speak of was my idea
of the thing, till Priscilla, who has a
very masterful mind, besides being a
very good drawing-room swimmer for
a child of three, explained to me forcibly
that I had got to do my bit. That is
why late visitors have often found me
prone on my watch-chain and striking
out helplessly like an impaled beetle,
with the end of a piece of string in my
mouth to drag me to the hearth-rug,
which was the pier and “home.”
It was bad for the trousers, per-
haps, but not really hard work, and it
called, at any rate, for no great mental
energy or nervous strain. And in Lon-
don I fancied that our exercises would
be milder still. The great city would
have a civilising, refining influence
and remove the last trace of the Viking
touch which the salt air had imparted
to the children's minds. Saturday
evening would find us sitting in a cosy
room, furnished entirely in the Cageby
manner, with chintz - covered chairs
and a pale green carpet, punctuated at
rare intervals by enormous pink flowers.
On one of those flowers would be the
ball of blue wool which connected ulti-
mately with Araminta, busily knitting
for herself the sweetest of sweat—of
jumpers, I mean ; on another a model
of the Albert Memorial, which Richard
was deftly constructing out of small
pieces of scrap-iron and screws, not
once mislaying the necessary nuts.
Upon a third, at her little stool and
table, would be Priscilla, poring over a
large book which contained brightly
coloured pictures of cows and the other
more sedentary mammals. And upon
yet a fourth, sitting elegantly in my
own armchair, I would reflectively
smoke my pipe, gazing ever and anon
through the blue wreaths into the
glowing heart of the anthracite stove.
But apparently this was not to be.
I must own that I felt a preliminary
qualm when Araminta left the room
just after tea with the parting words,
“By the way, I took them to the Zoo
on Thursday,” but I was still prepared
for somnolence and peace when the first
frightful thump at the door came. Then
the handle turned round several times
rapidly but unsuccessfully, and the
thing burst open, followed by Richard,
like a portion of a 5.9, and Priscilla,
head-over-heels, with a flushed face and
the tufts that are training to be curls
already shockingly disarranged.
“I a bad lion,” she announced on
completing the second revolution, and
Richard shouted simultaneously, “And
I'm a rhinoceros, and you're a buffalo,
and we're going to chase you.” I am

Nervous Post-War Sportsman. “OH DEAR, oh DEAR, THESE TAR ROADS 1
BREAK MY NECK THERE.”
I MIGHT ALMOST AS WELL GO INTO THE FIELD AND
not a naturalist, and I suppose it may
have happened, at some time on the
prairies or pampas or wherever this
noble creature ranges at large, that a
respectable business buffalo coming
home at the week-end has been pounced
on at one and the same moment by a
wicked carnivore and a raging pachy-
derm, and had his tie pulled out and
his hair ruffled and his collar unbut-
toned and his pipe and his matches
taken away; but it is a very exhausting
experience, and I was relieved when
Richard suddenly said, “Let's be two
monkeys in a cage, and you come and
look at us and put your fingers through;”
and, dragging Priscilla after him behind
a chair, presented absolutely for the
first time on the same bill the Borneo
ourang-outang and the wanderoo ape
from Malabar. My howl of agony fol-
lowing a severe finger-bite is, I flatter
myself, one of my cleverest turns, and it
had eleven encores before Priscilla, with
her usual abruptness, said firmly, “No
more monkey,” and Richard, fearful
lest the good work should fail to go on,
hastily cried, “I’ll be the keeper and
she be a tiger, and I leave the cage-door
open and she run out and eat you.”
I have every admiration for Richard
as a stage manager, but as a sportsman
he leaves something to seek. Was it,
I ask you, quite fair to shout to the
infuriated terror of the jungle, “I’m
the keeper, Priscilla; you mustn't touch
me,” and leave me under the paws of
the raging animal until Araminta merci-
fully entered to carry it away to bed 2
“Good-bye, Priscilla,” I called as she
departed. “No, you can't speak; I've
bittened you all up,” she replied, and
added with a face of seraphic ecstas
as the door closed, “And the blood.”
Can you wonder that I compromised
with Richard after that for the story
of Big Claus and Little Claus and Blue-
beard twice over?
The whole matter is receiving, as they
say at our office, my most earnest con-
sideration.
I seem to remember faintly being con-
ducted to the Tower when I was about
four years old, and that it made a very
great and ennobling impression on my
mind. Perhaps if Araminta would con-
sent to take them there some time next
week the historic atmosphere of the
place might curb their wild instincts
and elevate their thoughts, and we might
pass on to some quieter amusement
next Saturday—a little thumb-screwing
maybe and a turn or two of the rack,
with the execution of ANNE BoDEYN or
Sir THOMAS MoRE thrown in. I do
hate children to be rough. EvoB.

A PANTOMIME PROBLEM.
CINDERELLA'S SLIPPER FITS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FOOT. WHAT SHOULD THE FAIRY PRINCE DO2
WANTED–A NEW YEAR’S GIFT.
Mr. Punch's friends are already aware of the close
interest he takes in the Heritage Craft Schools at Chailey,
Sussex. In 1914 these schools were concerned with the care
and education of crippled children, and during the War
extended their work in many directions to include in par-
ticular the treatment of children suffering from Air-raid
shock, and a scheme for the training of wounded soldiers
in agriculture and various handicrafts during their conval-
escence at the Princess Louise Military Surgical Hospital.
The crippled boys gave up their buildings to the wounded
soldiers, and themselves helped largely in building the
Kitchener Huts to take their place; also by their own
example, which showed how difficulties could be bravely
overcome, they taught the crippled soldiers what forms of
happiness and service were still possible to those who had
lost the use of a limb.
It would be a long story to enumerate the developments
and ambitions of the Heritage Colony. Notably funds are
needed for the consolidation of the Army Children's Homes,
for an Operating Theatre in the Girls' Hospital and for the
purchase of Army Huts and additional land. A sum of
twenty thousand pounds is required; and Mr. Punch can
think of no better object for a gift at this season of giving.
Very sincerely he endorses the appeal of Princess Louise,
and lays stress on the testimony given to the work at Chailey
by the Bishop of LoNDoN, Surgeon-General Sir ALFRED
KEogh, Major-General Sir Robert Jon Es and Lieut.-General
Sir FRANCIs LLOYD, who, speaking on the occasion of the
opening of the Kitchener Huts, said: “Anything that can
be given in the way of help or of money will be thankfully
received and, I can assure you, will be faithfully spent.”
Mr. Punch earnestly begs his friends, for the sake of
the children of our fighting men, to send a New Year's
gift to Bishop BRowNE, 2, Campden House Road, Kensing-
ton, W.8; or to the Hon. Treasurer, Miss A. C. RENNIE,
The Heritage Craft Schools, Chailey, Sussex.
|NDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION.
[The Rat Bill comes into force on New Year's Day, and one recalls
regretfully the time when the belief prevailed that rats could be
rhymed to death.]
I cAME too late | The tears sweep like a tidal
Wave down my cheeks, my soul is wrapped in gloom,
To think that I must rest unsought and idle
In what would once have been a poet's boom ;
Had I but lived in days when human folly
Believed that rodents could be killed by rhyme,
This would have been my golden chance, and, golly,
I would have had a time.
The summons would have sounded, and upon its
First note I would have hastened to the fray,
Forthwith have built a barrage up of sonnets,
Oped rapid-fire with ode and roundelay;
Those who were bent on turning rats and mice up
Would then have come and clamoured round my door
For verse (of which I should have put the price up
And blamed it on the War).
Life would have been more lucrative and sweeter
In those old days when I'd have come out strong,
Serenely moulding massacre in metre
And blandly selling sudden death in song;
Whereas, alas! in this degenerate season
My skill is not considered worth a rap,
Less even than the art of putting cheese on
The hook inside a trap.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
You may experience some shock of surprise at finding
upon the title-page of Mount Music (LoNGMANs) the names
not only of E. CE. SomeRVILLE, but of MARTIN Ross. Miss
SoMERVILLE explains the mystery by a prefatory note say-
ing that the book was planned by her late partner, and
herself some years ago, and put aside when part-written
for other work. Do not suppose however that you will
find here any clue to the old problem, “Which wrote
which 2" On the contrary, the joins are as imperceptible
as ever, Mount Music has little in common (beyond some
breathless runs and the native humour of its peasantry)
Captain BENN, who seems to have enjoyed every minute of
his service, took a critical judgment into the Army. He was
not impressed by “spit-and-polish" as the best means to
true discipline. He was profoundly depressed by the stifling
of real initiative in both officers and men. “Whatever
future photography may have in the War it has none in the
Flying Corps,” was one of several dicta of the kind current
among the mandarins in the early stages of the War, and
the author gives plenty of evidence of the obstruction which
the pioneer flier had to face . . . A valuable record, admir-
ably illustrated by the author's camera and appropriate maps.
Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT is still in the Saga business.
A good thing for us, as these keen airs from a simpler
with the glorious farce of the
Flurry Knox books. The note
of it is far more restrained; its
twin themes, the gradual decay
of landlordism (embodied, at its
best, in the lovable but ill-
starred household of Mount
Music); and the cleavage, religi-
ous, political and social, inflicted
upon the Island of Saints by its
opposed Churches. There is a
plot, of young love and the in-
trigues of vaulting ambition; it
moves slowly, as suits a tale
where time is one of the chief
forces, till a point at which Miss
So MER v ILLE, like Fate, has
taken the abhorred shears and
cut without warning the threads
of a history of which (as she
herself says) as much remains
untold as has gone before. For
my part I could have followed
gladly every word of it. There
is about the whole book a quiet
beauty, a wistfulness even in its
laughter, and above all a sense
of quality, as impossible to mis-
take as to define, that makes for
a singular refreshment of the
spirit. This is my tribute, a
grateful one. As for charms of
detail, I leave you to explore
these in person; you may accept
my word that the process will
be a pleasant one.

world have a very tonic quality.
The Outlaw (CoNSTABLE) is the
story of Gisli Soursson, crafts-
man and warrior; of Grayflanks,
the sword that was forged into
a spear and brought bane to its
owner, and of Aud, the noble
wife of Gisli, who upheld his
honour and cleaved to him in
the long days of his outlawry
that ended with his life sold
dearly in a splendid fight among
the hills. Mr. HEWIETT has
contrived an idiom for the re-
telling of these heroic tales,
which avoids, on the one hand,
a tiresome archaism, and, on
the other, a disquieting mod-
ernity. It is a considerable feat
of artistry. I think, for the un-
learned, such as myself, it would
be useful if some details of com-
parative chronology were vouch-
safed us in an appendix. But
perhaps the transcriber feels
that these are dateless stories,
best left in their sublime detach-
ment. I note, by the way, early
authority to confirm some of us
in our more reckless habits of
speech: “Let you and I weld a
new sword out of this,” quoth
Thorgrim Bottlenose, a well-bred
sportsman of the period.
I welcome a novel by Miss
MILLs YouNG as I would a friend
That phrase of Parliamentary debate, “The honourable
and gallant Member,” may be applied with peculiar appro-
priateness to Captain WEDGwooD BENN, D.S.O., D.F.C.,
whose In the Side Shows (Hodder AND Stoughton) is a
modest record, lightened by humour and relevant observa-
tion, of excellent fighting service. A sitting Member and
junior Whip, not much short of forty and untrained to arms,
might well have found arguments for standing-to on the
home front. However, October, 1914, found him in the
Middlesex Yeomanry; April, 1915, in Egypt; August of the
same year in Gallipoli, in the thick of that mournful enter-
prise. After the evacuation he wangled a transfer to the
R.N.A.S., serving under Commander SAMsoN in Palestine
and Arabia and doing patrol work in the Mediterranean;
in 1917, making yet another change of status by transferring
to the R.A.F., he was, after getting his wings, engaged in
observation, photographic and bombing work on the Italian
front, carrying on till within a few weeks of the Armistice.
who brings with him an atmosphere of common sense
and level-headedness. She knows South Africa as well
as I know her books about it, and without any of the
obtrusiveness of a professional propagandist she has a way
of directing one's thoughts steadily towards the difficulties
besetting that country. She does so again in The Dominant
Race (Hodder AND STOUGHTON), but it is more than pro-
bable that many of her readers will be so intrigued by the
story that they will have no attention to spare for such
troublesome things as problems. For my taste, however,
the love-story is rather damaged by having for its hero one
of those strong, reserved, devastatingly capable men, with
whom my encounters in real life are so grotesquely few
when compared with the opportunities I have been given
to meet them in fiction. But perhaps this is no great
matter in a novel by Miss MILLs YouNG, for whatever her
characters may be like—or unlike—her descriptive powers
remain.

THEY were sitting together to see the New Year in—the Old Man with the Scythe and the Young Fellow
with the Hump.
“So after all,” said the Junior, “the world didn't come to an end on the 17th instant, as they promised us.”
“No," said Time, without enthusiasm; “I’ve got another reprieve.”
“I don't seem to catch the right note of joyous relief in your tones,” said Mr. Punch. “I'm afraid all
this worry about a fourth dimension has added to your cares. I should hate to be called a fourth dimension.
What you want is a little rest. Why don't you follow the fashion and strike? Why don't you down scythes?”
“It would be indecent,” said the Antique with some dignity. “I belong to one of the public services.”
“All the more reason for striking, if we are to accept the new gospel according to the Triple Alliance.
The nation's necessity is their opportunity.”
“Perhaps, like the railwaymen, I should find I wasn't quite so indispensable as I thought. Anyhow, I dis-
approve of strikes in public services; and if I were a Government I should know how to put an end to them. The
fact is you don't treat these people as public servants. You should give them better conditions than they can get in
private service, and to these special privileges there should be attached special obligations. Nobody is compelled
to be a miner or a railwayman or a transport-worker, and if a man chooses to join one of these public services
he should be made to understand that the conditions must be accepted, and that for the period of his engage-
ment it is just as illegal for him to strike or desert as it would be in the fighting services.”
“Very sound,” said Mr. Punch; “and the discipline we learned in the War ought to come in useful here.”
“I should like to believe it. But I see very little sign of any such lesson having been assimilated. The War
taught us many other things much more easy to retain than discipline. You can't take a plain law-abiding
citizen out of his daily routine and teach him to throw bombs at other people's heads and stick bayonets in other
people's gizzards without leaving him a little restive, a little dissatisfied with the excitement afforded by the
relatively unemotional life to which he returns. And it is not only the fighting-man who has had his ordinary
standards rudely shaken; you have all suffered from War-shock, and you have not yet recovered your sanity.”
“I suppose,” said Mr. Punch, “it wouldn't be possible for you to take a year off and let us all go to bed
to-night and wake up on New Year's Day, 1921, to find that some good angel—or perhaps it would take a full
choir of them—has carried on for us while we slept, and got through all the heavy business which makes me

shudder when I read the agenda for 1920. You see, it's the transition period which is so difficult; it is so hard
to be off with the Old World before you are on with the New.” -
“I have heard much talk of New Worlds since I began to take notice,” said Father Time a little wearily.
“Like the gentleman in A Soul's Tragedy I have known many leaders of revolt. I have seen tyrannies overthrown
and worse tyrannies set up in their place. And I have known many wars that were to end all war, and they
didn't. You do well to be glad that for a while, perhaps for a generation, you have secured peace for your
land ; that is a great achievement; but there is something more to be done before the Millennium is announced.
“I don't suppose any nation has ever had such a chance as you have been given. But do you look like
using it? You would be indignant if I told you that you are lacking in gratitude to your dead. But all this
breathless race for wealth and luxury, this hunger for just any diversion that may distract you from the memory
of the past few years (I am told that no novel or play or picture-palace film has a chance of popular success
to-day if it touches upon the War)—is this your best response to their sacrifice?
“I was never of those who imagined that the War would make much change in men's natures. Natures
are not easily changed. You throw a rock into a pool and it is convulsed to its depths, but the waves soon pass
into ripples and the ripples die away, and the pool remains unchanged. Its water is not turned into dry land,
or wine, or anything else.
“According to the PRESIDENT of the United States (whose own Republic, held up as a model for the rest,
threatens to be as late for the Peace as it was for the War) the Allies were out to make the world safe for
democracy. But safe against what? Against autocracy 2 Good. But who is to make it safe against itself 2
I hear a great deal about the Sanctity of Labour (meaning the theory of it, or a particular class that appropriates
its name), but very little about the Sanctity of Work (meaning the Actual Thing). Yet it is by its work, and
little else, that a nation grows to greatness. If Germany could have forgone her military ambitions and been
content to go on working, within a decade or two she could have had the world at her feet. And unless you
challenge her in the lists of Labour she will yet have the world at her feet; for she knows how to work, as you
don't ; she knows, as you don't, how to spurn delights and live laborious days; and that—far more than her
army—is what made her great and will make her great again.”
What defence of his country was on the lips of Mr. Punch may be conjectured but will never be known,
for at this point the midnight bells began.
“There goes the Old Year,” said Father Time, “and I must fly. I'm always flying.”
“Good speed to you,” said Mr. Punch, “and a better New Year than you seem to expect. And let me
thank you very much for doing most of the talking. I generally have to do it myself. As a set-off let me
present you with a book of my own words, which contains the accumulated wisdom that has flowed from my
pen in the course of the last six months. I do hope you won't find it too cheerful for your taste. You see we
had to keep our hearts up during the War, and, if I am to believe all you say, we need to keep them higher
than ever if we're to get through this terrible Peace. . By the way, I anticipated, rather intelligently, what you
have just told me and have had it already embodied in the Epilogue to this book. For that reason, if for no
other, I trust that you will take a personal interest in my
@nt jumürtt and fifty-stbenth tolume."
