PARTRIDGE,
NEW WELLS FOR OLD.
Over the top of Part II. of The Out-
line of History I caught the smiling
glance of the man in the opposite
corner of the compartment.
“Good stuff that,” he said, indicating
the History with a jerk of his head.
“Quite,” I agreed, maintaining my
distance.
“Immense,” he continued. “And it
means the dawn of a new life for me.
I'm WELLs's hero. Every time I've
appeared in his half-yearly masterpiece,
ever since Tomo Bungay. And look at
the mess he's made of my life. Often
I've had to start it under the cloud of
mysterious parentage. Invariably I
have been endowed with a Mind (capital
M). Think of those uphill fights of mine
against adverse conditions. And my
unhappy marriages. He has led me
into every variation of infidelity. When
I did hit it off with my wife for once,
he sent us to the Arctic regions as a
punishment. In the depth of winter,
too.
But, now he's taken up this History,
I'm free. The dam has burst and strange
things come floating down . . .”
He sprang to his feet in his excite.
ment. He was wearing a loose-fitting
suit and what his master might call a
lower middle-class hat.
“And now I'm going to do all the
things I've always wanted to do. A
happy marriage; well-ordered life in the
suburbs; warm slippers in the fender,
and all that that stands for; kinemas,
perhaps, and bowls. An allotment . . .”
“But,” I objected," this History won't
occupy him for ever. There should be
only about sixteen more parts. He'll
have you out again next autumn.”
“But WELLs is getting the Suburban
idea too.” He was standing right over
me, glaring horribly with excitement.
The train had entered a tunnel and he
was shouting bravely against the din.
“Look in Part I. He acknowledges the
help he has received from Mrs. WELLs,
And her watchful criticism. That from
him / I tell you I am free—free!"
He was shaking me by the shoulders
now, his face close to mine. “I shall
have my allotment. Prize parsnips—
giant marrows!"
“Don't be too sure,” I yelled—the
tunnel seemed endless. “Remember
or old Sherlock. Doyle raised him
rom the dead. And you."—my voice
rising to a scream—“he'll have you
out— out—out !”

MR. PUNCH 0N SILK STOCKINGS.
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-Your article about
Christmas presents was a great success.
I took your advice about the silk stock-
ings, and sent the following verses with
them, which some of your married
readers may care to cut out and keep
for future use:—
Your stockings once, on Christmas Eve,
Would hang, your cot adorning,
And Father Christmas, we believe,
Would fill them ere the morning;
But since he spied your dainty toes
To exchange the parts he's willing:
He thinks it's his to send the hose
And yours to find the filling.
He lays his offerings at your feet
And hopes you won't deride them,
For he has nothing half so neat
As you to put inside them.
There! I can only repeat that the
results were excellent, and express my
gratitude to you for the same.
Yours obediently,
GRATEFUL HUSBAND.
P.S.—The ties I got this time were
quite all right ; she too must have
read your article.

NATURE AND ART.
To Betty, who can afford to defy the laws of symmetry.
[Being reflections on the old theory, recently developed before the
Hellenic Society by Mr. JAY HAMIBIDGE, that certain formulae of
proportions found in nature—notably in the normal ratio between a
man's height and the span of his outstretched arms (2 : N/5)—consti-
tuted the basis of symmetry in the art of the Greeks and, earlier, of
the Egyptians.] º
Betty, I fear you don't conform
Precisely to the female norm
From dainty foot to charming noddle,
But, closely measured, span by span,
Seem built upon a private plan
Not found in ANNIE KELLERMAN
Or in the well-known Melos model.
If you compare your width and height—
Arms horizontal, left and right—
With ancient types of pure perfection,
The ratio may not, it's true,
Be as the root of 5 to 2,
But what, my dear, has that to do
With laws of natural selection ?
Let Mr. HAMBIDGE to your shape *
Apply his T-square and his tape,
And wish that you were more archaic;
Why should I care? I love you best
For what no compasses can test,
For graces not to be expressed
In terms however algebraic.
I love you for the lips and eyes
That none may hope to standardize
On any system known to Hellas;
And what I like about your smile
Has no relation to the style
Of any pyramid of Nile
Figured by mathematic fellahs.
Though your proportions mayn't agree
With FECHNER's pedant formulae,
I don't complain of such disparity;
Too flawless that perfection shows;
For me a larger comfort flows
From human failings (take your nose—
I like its quaint irregularity).
Indeed I love you best of all
For those defects by which you fall
Short of the pattern you should follow;
As I would fain be loved for mine,
Speaking as one whose own design
Lacks something of the perfect line
Affected by the young Apollo. O. S.
How TO GAIN A Journal ISTIC Position.
YoUNG aspirants are always endeavouring to secure posts
on our leading newspapers, and complain bitterly that their
letters of application are ignored by obtuse editors. To
help them in this sad ambition Mr. Punch has composed
a series of letters to divers editors which he guarantees will
prove eminently satisfactory. -
To the Editor of “The Daily News.”
SIR,--I regard the insufferable LLoyd GEORGE as the
most dangerous, the most malignant, the most incompetent
politician who has ever attempted to misrule this country.
like LENIN and TROTSKY blush for the human race. I feel
||with you that till the real Liberal party returns to power
England will never know peace and prosperity. Then and
then only will brotherly friendship between England and
Germany be renewed. Then and then only shall we see
cheap milk, cheap coal, abundant housing, the Free Break-
fast Table and the Large Cocoa Cup. To show my devotion
to the cause you so nobly advocate I may say that I have
actually read every article contributed by Mr. MASTERMAN
to your paper. I am strongly in favour of an entente with
Labour, by which Labour should agree not to contest any
seats where the true Asquithians stand a chance. I enelose
as a specimen of my work the first of a series of articles on
“How LLOYD GEORGE lost the War,” which I am sure will
be invaluable at by-elections.
To the Editor of “The Daily Mail.”
SIR,--I am young and, if possible, growing younger daily.
My motto is “ Hustle and Bustle" and not “Dilly and
Dally.” I live on standard bread, in a wooden hut em-
bowered, when feasible, with sweet peas. My ear is always
close to the ground, and I can confidently predict what the
man in the street will be thinking about the day after to-
morrow. Politically, I am opposed to the Wastrels, the
Wee Frees and the Bolsheviks, and am not prepared as yet
to back Labour unreservedly. I can express myself brightly
and briefly on any topical subject. Herewith I send speci-
men articles (length three hundred words) on “Poker
Bridge,” “Are we having Wetter Washdays?” and “The
Woggle-Wiggle Dance.” Should there be no vacancy on
your staff I should be prepared to accept one on any other
of your publications—The Weekly Dispatch, The Times or
The Rainbow.
To the Editor of “The Manchester Guardian.”
SIR,--I was a Conscientious Objector during the War. I
conscientiously object to everything still, including the
Peace Treaty. I speak and write fifteen languages and
dialects, including Oxford English. I have a comprehensive
knowledge of social and political life in Continental Europe,
Asia, Africa, America and Polynesia. I have also resided in
England. I have a deep conviction that under all con-
ditions, everywhere and at all times, England is invariably
and absolutely in the wrong. In home politics I am reso-
lutely opposed to all the Coalition has done, is doing or will
do. It is my firm opinion that the actions of England
would become less deplorable, less criminal if Mr. Asquith
returned to power. I enclose as specimens of my mentality
two intensely human articles which I doubt not will find a
home in your columns: “Proportional Representation in
Jugo-Slavia "(length four thousand five hundred words) and
“Futurism under TRotsky" (length five thousand words).
To the Editor of “The Spectator.”
SIR,-In offering my services to you I may point out how
happily my up-bringing and mental training have fitted me
for a post on your staff. The child of an Archdeacon (who
was also honorary chaplain to a rifle club), I was born in a
house with earth-filled walls and brought up in intimate
association with a large number of most intelligent animals.
If desired I am prepared to relate anecdotes of the family
bull-dog and a pet she-goat which will verify my description.
I feel with you that England can only be saved by relying
on a Free-Trading, Non-Socialist, Church Establishment.
I loathe alike Mr. Asquith and Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, and
think that the intellect of England, which blossoms so lux-
uriously in country rectories and deaneries, finds its best
expression in Lord HUGH CECIL. As a specimen of my
literary ability I enclose a middle article on “The Sense of
The iniquity of the Coalition will make enlightened rulers
Obligation in Tom-Cats.”

THE TUBE cuRE.
[It has been observed that employees in the
Tubes never catch cold while at work, and
doctors, questioned by an evening paper, have
said that “the Tube atmosphere should be
quite likely to cure a cold if breathed long
enough—say for an hour at a stretch.”]
To-DAY, when I acquire a cold
(Rude Boreas having blustered),
I do not, as in times of old,
Immerse my feet in mustard;
I put a penny in a slot
At some Tube railway station
And draw a ticket for a not
Far distant destination.
I shun the crowded liſts, although
They're right enough in their way,
And make my calm, unruffled, slow
Descension by the stairway;
'Tis there a man can be alone,
Immune from all intrusion;
I doubt if there was ever known
Its equal for seclusion.
Where no invading footsteps fall
I quaff the healthy vapours,
While glancing at my ease through all
The illustrated papers;
And since I've found the bottom stair
A place they don't upholster,
I always take when going there
A small pneumatic bolster.
Not till an hour or twain have gone,
Thus pleasantly expended,
Do I proceed to carry on,
And, when my journey's ended,
I find all dread bacilli slain—
No germ shows his (or her) face –
And so, my cherry self again,
Come blithely to the surface.
A BUNCH OF POETS.
Mr. Obadiah Geek has broken his
long silence to some purpose. Those
who remember his pre-war achieve-
ments in the field of polychromatic
romanticism will hardly be prepared
for his present development, which lifts
him at a bound from the overcrowded
ranks of lyric-writers to the uncon-
gested heights whereon recline the great
masters of epic poetry. And yet it was
perhaps inevitable. The thunder and
the reek of war (the last two years of
which, we believe, were spent by Mr.
Geek in the Egg Control Department)
could scarcely have failed to imprint
their mark on the author of Eros in
Eruption; and so he has given us a
real epic, whose very title, Ad Astra, is
symbolic of the high altitudes in which
he so triumphantly and so securely
navigates. Outwardly it is a story of
the War, but there is little difficulty in
probing the allegory; and those who
follow the hero's vicissitudes as a
to his victorious advancement to the
rank of Acting Lance-Corporal, unpaid
(and there is a symbolism even in the
“unpaid "), will readily supply the
application to the affairs of everyday
life.
The ten thousand odd lines of this
inspired poem are liberally enlivened
with those characteristic flashes which
Mr. Geek's previous efforts have led us
to expect. Nothing could be happier
than the following, descriptive of the
hero's early days on the barrack-
square:—
The Sergeant rolled his eyes toward the azure
And called down curses on my bloody
head . . . -
“You buzz about,” his peroration ran,
“Like a bluebottle in a sugar-bowl.
Thank God we have a Navy l’’ and my feet,
Turned outward, as they had been drilled
to turn,
At forty-five degrees or thereabouts,
Itched to join issue with his swollen paunch;
But I refrained.
Or again:—
Fame, the skyscraper, hath a thousand floors;
And some toil slowly upward, stair by stair,
And stagger and halt and faint upon the
way ;
Others, more fortunate, achieve the top
At one swift elevation, by the lift.
Mr. Geek, whatever his method of
progression may have been, has cer-
tainly “achieved the top"—if indeed he
has not gone over it.

In Throbs, Miss Gramercy Gingham-
Potts reveals a depth of feeling and
delicacy of expression that should
secure her the right of entry to every
art-calendar and birthday-book. Her
Muse is, perhaps, a trifle anaemic, but
to many none the less interesting on
that account; its very fragility, in fact,
constitutes its chief appeal. She has
an engaging gift of definition that,
combined with a keen appreciation of
the obvious, makes her verses partic-
larly susceptible to quotation. For
instance —
The maiden asked, “What is a kiss?”
The poet wrote:
“Kisses are stamps that frank with bliss
Love's contract-note.”
While for effectively studied simplicity
it would be difficult to match the lyrical
gem to which Miss Gingham-Potts has
given the arresting title, “Farewell”:—
The birds sing sweet in Summer;
The daisies hear their song;
But Winter's come, and they are dumb
So long.
I told my love in Summer,
So pure and brave and strong;
But frosts came on; my love is gone;
So long !

A new volume by the author of Swings

ing raid on the garbage-bins of London's
underworld. Mr. Biggs is a stark real-
ist, and his unminced meat may prove
too strong for some stomachs; but those
who can digest the fare he offers will find
it wonderfully sustaining. Here is no
condiment of verbiage, no dressing of
the picturesque. Life is served up high,
and almost raw. By way of illustra-
tion we cannot do better than quote
from the opening poem, “Bill's Wife,”
in which the calculated roughness of the
rhythm is redolent of the pervading
atmosphere:—
At the corner of the street
Stands the Blue-faced Pig ; *
Outside a barrel-organ is playing
And the people are dancing a jig.
A woman waits there grimly ;
Her eyes are set and her lips drawn thin ;
For Bill, her man, is in the public,
Soaking his soul in gin.

than devote careful attention to these
gaunt chronicles of Slumland.

The following stanzas, taken from a
poem entitled “Reconstruction,” are a
favourable example of Mr. Thor Pin-
money's somewhat unequal genius:—
By strife we live, but boredom slays;
My mind from out this office strays
And takes me back to the spacious days
When I counted socks in Ordnance.
I hate my pen; I hate my stool;
What am I but a nerveless tool 2
But we did not work by rote or rule
When I counted socks in Ordnance . . .
There are times even now when it really seems
I'm back in a suburb of shell-shocked Rheims;
But the office echoes my waking screams
When I find it was only in my dreams
I was counting socks in Ordnance.
Unfortunately, all Mr. Pinmoney's
efforts do not come up to this standard,
and we should be almost inclined to
wonder whether the writer has not after
all mistaken his vocation, were it not for
the really brilliant piece of work which
brings the volume(Pegasus Comes Home)
to a close. We make no apology for re-
producing this masterpiece in full:—
Man comes
And goes.
What then 2
Who knows?
Here we have the whole philosophy
of life and the life hereafter summed up.

money is by this assured of a permanent
place in the anthology of post-bellum
poetry.

Or harness to our prams and punts
The puissant radiobe;
Me rather it delights to roam
Across the salt AEgean foam
With old Odysseus, far from home,
And bless the name of LoBB.
To soar with PIATo to the heights;
The human touch that more delights
Than crown or regal robe;
To taste the fresh Pierian springs,
To see CATULLUs scorch his wings
With the fierce flame that sears and
stings—
For this I thank thee, LoBB.
I've made no fortune out of beer;
I'm not a plutocrat or peer,
Nor yet a bloated profiteer,
An OM or e'en an OBE;
But if I'd thirty pounds to spare
I'd go and blow them then and
there
Upon the Hundred Books that bear


By no vain annotations vexed
The sign and seal of Lorb.
To find in PLUTARCH's kings and knights

[JANUARY 7, 1920.
A NEWSPAPER SCOOP.
(With the British Army in France.)
“I spotted him by the fountain-pen
stains on his vest and the thunderbolts
sticking out of his pockets,” said Fred-
erick. “So I went up to him and said,
‘You are Wuffle of The Daily Hooter,
the man who wiped-up Whitehall and is
now engaged in freezing-out France?”
“What did he say?” asked Percival.
“Whipped out a note-book and asked
me to tell him all about it. I said I
was pining for the white cliffs of Albion
and that the call of the counting-house
and cash-box was ringing in my ears,
but that I couldn't get demobilised be-
cause the Colonel's pet Pomeranian had
conceived a fancy for me and wouldn't
take its underdone chop from anyone
At that moment a motor - lorry
rumbled by, and Binnie, recollecting a
passage in Wuffle's latest article about
“motor - lorries rushing madly about
with apparently no purpose in view,”
jumped excitedly to the door.
“‘Magneto Maggie' leading,” he
shouted, “and “The Sparking Spitfire'
is just behind. Care to double your
bet on ‘Maggie' at evens, Percival?”
“Not yet,” replied Percival cautiously.
“It's only the first lap yet, and “Maggie'
sometimes jibs a bit when she passes
the Remount Depôt."
Wuffle had his fountain-pen at the
alert and looked inquiringly at Fred-
erick.
“I suppose it is another example of
deliberate waste,” said the latter. “But
we've got the lorries eating their heads
else. I also hinted that I
and a few friends could
tell him things that would
make his biggest journal-
istic scoops look like para-
graphs in a parish maga-
zine, so he invited me to
bring you round this after-
noon to split an infinitive
with him.”
“Wuffle 2 ” said Binnie.
“That's the man who
wrote about 'gilded sub-
alterns loafing luxuriously
in cushioned cars in a
giddy round of useless and
pampered ease '2"
“Well, I won't say he
wrote it, but he signed it.
No single man living could
write all the stuff Wuffle
signs. It's turned out as
they turn out cheap motor-
cars. One man roughs it
out, passes it to the ad-
BEHIND THE SCENES IN CINEMA-LAND.
The Rescuer. “I’m Not A very GRACEFUL DIVER, you know. WHAT
ABOUT EMPLOYING A PROFESSIONAL SWIMMER. Fort THIS PART of THE show?"
Wuffle jumped up with alacrity.
“I'd be awfully glad to get a snap-
shot of it,” said he, disappearing in
search of his hat and coat.
Frederick took the opportunity to
make a few scathing remarks to Percival.
“It's just like you, you mouldy old
citron,” he said. “I start a little ex-
periment in tirage de jambe, and you
put your heavy hoof in and spoil the
whole business. You know jolly well
that Le Glaxo was completely closed
down months ago.”
“Oh, put another penny in your
brain-meter and try to realise that you
aren't the only one who's grown up,”
replied Percival impatiently. “Your
brain-waves move about as quick as
G.P.O. telegraph messages. I'd got
the scheme worked out while you were
putting over your old mus-
ical-comedy gags.”
Since the departure of
the British, Le Glaxo's
only excitement is the ar-
rival of its one train per
day. Ignoring the sensa-
tion caused by the detrain-
ing of four persons simul-
taneously, Percival led his
party along a muddy rough
lane.
“The dump is about four
kilometres away and the
road gets rather bad to-
wards the end,” he said,
maliciously edging Wuffle
into a bit of swamp.
“Sorry; I was going to
warn you about that.”
Wufflescraped mud from
his trousers and followed
the leader over a rough
wall into a hidden ditch.
A breathless climb up a
jective department, thence to the punc-
tuation-room, where they sprinkle it
with commas and exclamation marks,
and then Wuffle touches it up, fits it
with headlines and signs it. Oh, I for-
got. Before it goes to press the libel
expert looks it over to see that it isn't
actionable.”
“Anyway, he 's the responsible
party,” said Binnie, “and I would fain
have converse with the Wuffle. That
'gilded subaltern bit was ringing in
my head like a dirge the other night
when I was wearily trudging the seven
kilometres from St. Denis camp because
there was no one to give me a lift.”
That afternoon Frederick introduced
his friends to Wuffle.
“Sorry we're late,” he said, “but
Percival and Binnie here have been
engaged with the Pioneer-Sergeant dis-
cussing the best method of converting
a whippet-tank into a roller for the
off in the garages and the petrol is
simply aching to be evaporated, so we
give the drivers exercise and ourselves
some excitement over organising these
Area Circuit Steeplechases.”
“Why not trans-ship the lorries?”
suggested Wuffle.
“That would never do, old prune,”
said Frederick. “The troops would
have nothing to guard.”
“Send the men home,” persisted
Wuffle.
“Come, my willowy asparagus,” re-
plied Frederick in horrified tones, “we
must have troops to find us work to do.
Of course it's sometimes difficult to
keep the men employed, and then we
have to make dumps of empty biscuit
tins and things for them to guard.”
“I fixed up a real beauty at Le Glaxo,
not ten kilometres from here,” chipped
in Percival. “If you'd like to see it
there's a train going in about twenty
hill and a steady trudge over plough-
land found Wuffle still game, but, after
he had got his camera ready for action
on the cheerful assurance that they were
nearing their quarry, a disappointed
cry from the leader dashed his hopes.
“Hang it!” said Percival, “I forgot.
The dump was moved to Pont Antoine
last Tuesday. Come along; it's only
three kilometres away.”
Strangely enough, Pont Antoine was
also a blank. Binnie suggested trying
Monceau, two kilometres further on ;
but when they arrived there, fatigued
and dirty, a thin drizzle was falling and
it was almost dark. Percival confessed
himself baffled.
“I’m awfully sorry,” said he to
Wuffle ; “I can't find it now, and the
point is how are we going to get back?
There isn't a railway for miles.”
“Don't any of our lorries or cars
pass here?" asked Wuffle.

“Oh, yes. But they won't give you
minutes.”

“It's the result of the articles in the
papers about waste,” said Frederick
sympathetically. “But I don't sup-

your hanging on and running behind.”
Wuffle looked round disconsolately.
In the gloom the lighted windows of
the tiny Hôtel de l’Univers blinked
invitingly.
“I think I'll stop here for the night,”
he said, “and telephone for a car to

“Right-o!” said Percival. “And

looked round for applause.

The well-advertised series of articles
in The Daily Hooter commenced a few
days later. The conspirators studied
them diligently in gleeful anticipation
of finding their contribution to journal-

in a brief paragraph.
“When I had collected my material

the sake of exercise and amusement I
permitted them to conduct me on a wild-

“HULLo, GEORGE |
AND WHEN 's THE WAR GoING TO BE OVER, EH 2"
THE QUESTIONABLE ALIEN.
William, my hitherto unventuresome friend William, is
going abroad. I cannot be certain why. Perhaps he no
longer feels his heroism equal to the strain of living in a
country fit for heroes. It may be that he has unwittingly
incubated a bacillus which figures in novels as the “Call
of the Wild.” Anyhow, William is going abroad—so much
so that, if he went any farther, he would be on his way
home again.
I need not say that I felt called upon to help William
through this trying period, and our preparations proceeded
satisfactorily until the clever geographers who arrange
these things nowadays discovered that William could fetch
the Far East by way of the Far West...Then the inter-
national complications set in. First, William's passport—
a healthy enough document at the start—had to be carried
round the diplomatic quarter of London until it broke out
into a thick rash of supplementary visas. Next we sought
out the moneychangers in their dens, to transmute William's
viaticum bit "by bit into four foreign currencies. Then a
Great Power through whose territory William will have to
pass apparently was nervous of his approach and instituted
a grand inquisition into the status and antecedents of the
Alien (William).
We unfolded the paper on our table and stared at it
aghast. Its area was rather less than a square yard; in
colour it favoured the yolk of bad eggs; while all over its
broad expanse were ruled compartments, half of them filled
with questions that no gentleman would ask another, the
other half left blank for William's indignant replies. We
vided all his baptismal titles—there are four of these be-
sides “William ”—and then attacked the first real poser:—

William groaned. “Reach me down Todhunter's Arith-
metic, will you ?” said he.
I did so, and turned up the Money Market page of our
daily paper. Nothing was heard for the next five minutes
but grunts and sighs of despair. We then gave it up on
the understanding that William must make a point of
winning heavily at bridge—or would it be euchre 2—on
the way across.
Have you ever been in the territory of the Great Power
before ?

to remark more hopefully: “Well, there's this to be said

they'll give me away.”

“No,” answered William frankly, “but I possess a
brother-in-law who has leanings towards Rosicrucianism.
Next, please.” -
The next was a very searching, legally-worded inquiry.
It demanded at great length to be informed whether William
was a person who advocated the overthrow by force or
violence of the Government of the Great Power, or all forms
of Law, or believed in the propriety of assassinating any or
every officer of the Great Power because of his official
character.
William took up the paper-knife with an expression of
sheer animal ferocity. “Yes,” he hissed, “the whole lot.

ANIMAL HELPS.
(By a Student of Domestic Economy.)
Living in a remote country district,
where the difficulty of obtaining ser-
vants is at present insurmountable—
the nearest “pictures” are twelve miles
off—I have been much impressed and
encouraged by two letters in recent
issues of The Spectator. One describes
a Bloomsbury grocer's cat that bought
her own cat's-meat; another recounts
the exploits of a spaniel belonging to
a house painter and glazier at Yar-
mouth (Isle of Wight), which, if given a
penny, would immediately amble off to
a grocer's shop and purchase a cake.
Viewed in their true perspective,
these exhibitions of animal intelligence
seem to indicate fruitful possibilities of
the employment of our dumb friends
to assist us in these trying times. Many
years ago I remember reading of a
baboon which discharged the duties of
a railway porter at a station in Cape
Colony with great efficiency. I have
unfortunately mislaid the reference, but
..so far as I can remember no mention
was madeof wages or tips; consequently
the importation and employment of
skilled simian labour on a large scale
might go a long way towards reducing
the expenses of our railway system.
But in view of certain obvious diffi.
culties it is perhaps better to restrict
our attention to the sphere of domestic
service and farm labour. And here I
would urge with all the power at my
command the employment of the ele-
phant. The greatest burden of house-
hold work is the washing of plates, and
this is a task which elephants are pecu-
liarly well fitted to undertake; also the
cleaning of windows without the use
of a ladder. A well-trained and ami-
able elephant, again, would enable par-
ents to dispense with a perambulator.
I admit that the initial outlay might
be considerable, but the longevity of
elephants is notorious, and it would
always be possible to hire them out to
travelling menageries.
Another neglected asset is the well-
known aptitude shown by poodles for
digging out truffles, an accomplishment
of which I often read in my youth. If
truffles, why not potatoes?
The extraordinary intelligence and
affectionate disposition of the runner
duck has often been commented on by
our serious weeklies, but so far little
attempt has been made to turn these
qualities to practical account. They
forage for themselves. Why should
they not be taught to do so for their
owners as well?
One more point and I have done.

indispensable to the modern curriculum.
The domestic pig has on many occasions
shown a capacity for mastering simple

that the pupil always ends by bettering
his master. Under a more enlightened
and humane régime I confidently look
forward to the time when our children
will learn the Rule of Three, not from
highly-paid and incompetent govern-
esses, but from unsalaried porcine in-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,-A Merry Christmas
to you! A bit late, you say? On the
contrary, in plenty of time. It is next
Christmas I am referring to. Over
there, in your tropical land, when the
sun stings your skin through your shirt
and the sand blisters your feet through
your boot-soles, when you butter your
bread with a soup-ladle and the mer-
cury boils merrily in the barometer,
then, vainly pawing the air for mos-
quitoes with one hand and reaching for
the siphon with the other, you gasp,
“Gad l-it must be getting on for Christ-
mas-time.”
But over here in England, where
the seasons wheel round without any
appreciable difference in temperature,
where, if it were not for the gentleman
who writes the calendars, nobody would
know whether to wear straw-hats or
snow-shoes, Christmas comes sneak-
ing up behind you and grabs you by
the pocket before you have time to
dodge. “Christmas Eve already!" you
exclaim. “Christmas Eve 1 and there's
dear old Tom in Penang and good old
Dick in Patagonia and poor old Harry
in Princetown, and I've not written a
word of cheer to any of them and now
have no time to do so.” That's what
happened to me this year, anyhow ; but
I'm determined it shall not occur again,
so—A Merry Christmas to you, Ginger.
This my first Yule in the Old Coun-
try, after many in foreign climes, was
not an unqualified success. On the
morning of Christmas Eve I went for
a walk and lost myself. After wading
through bog systems and bramble en-
tanglements for some hours I came out
behind a spinney and there spied a
small urchin with red cheeks and a red
woollen muffler standing beneath a
holly-tree. On sighting me he gave
vent to a loud and piteous howl. I
asked him where his pain was, and he
replied that he wanted some holly for
decorations, but was too short to reach
it. I thereupon swarmed the shrub,
plucked and tossed the richly berried
boughs to the poor little chap. In
return he showed me where I lived—
which indeed was not two hundred
yards distant, but concealed by the
thicket. -
Later in the day Edward came in to
tea, much annoyed. Bolshevism, he
declared, was within our gates. He had
been out to collect Christmas decora-
tions in his own private fenced spinney,
and confound it if some scoundrels
hadn't been and gone and stripped his
pet holly-tree of every twig Anarchy
was yapping at the door.
The Aunt soothed him, saying she
supply of splendid holly from a sweet
little boy who had come round hawking
it at sixpence a bough. I asked her if
by any chance the dear little fellow had
worn a red woollen comforter, and was
not surprised when I heard that he had.
No sooner had I fallen asleep that
same night than I was aroused by an ex-
traordinary din. I lay there, comatose
and semi-conscious in the pitchy dark-
ness, and wondered what had happened.
Presently I distinguished the bray of
trumps, and I knew. “Golly!” I whis-
pered to myself, “I'm dead. Cheer-o!"
Then I recollected something I had
read concerning ye sports and customs
of ye Ancient British and decided it
must be “Waits.” I crept to the
window and by a glow of lanterns
beheld the St. Gwithian Independent
Brass Band grouped round the porch,
blasting “Christians, awake! " through
their brazen fog-horns. I fumbled
about on the dressing-table, missed the
matches but found a half-crown. “Take
that and trot ' " I snarled, hurling it at
them with all my strength. The coin
hit the trombone a glancing blow on the
snout, ricochetted off the bassoon and
bounded into the rockery.
The music stopped abruptly as the
bandsmen swarmed in pursuit of for-
tune. In half-an-hour's time they had
pulled all Edward's cherished sedums
and saxifrages up by the roots and
turned over most of the smaller rocks
without discovering the treasure. A
conference in loud idiomatic Cornish
then took place, with the result that two
musicians were despatched to a neigh-
bouring farm for picks, crow-bars and
more lanterns; the remainder squatted
on the flower-beds and whiled away the
time of waiting by blasting “Good
King Wenceslas" to the patient stars.
In due course the messengers re-
turned and the quarrying of the rockery
began in earnest. By 4.15 A.M. they
had most of it littered over the drive,
but had struck some granite boulders
which defied even the crowbars. A
further conference was then held, but
at this point Edward made a dramatic
appearance, clad in lilac pyjamas, odd
boots and a kimono of the Aunt's, which
he had worn as King Alfred in some
charades the night before, and in the
darkness had donned in mistake for his
dressing-gown. His address was im-
passioned and moving, but had no effect
on the Waits, who could only be per-
suaded to abandon their silver mine at
the price of a second half-crown.
A day or so before Christmas I began
to notice that everybody was getting
presents—everybody except me, that
is. This caused me pain. It gave the
impression that I was not appreciated.
into Penzance, bought several articles
I had been wanting for some time,
wrote a few affectionate notes in dis-
guised handwriting, such as “With
dearest love from Flossie,” “With hugs
and kisses from Ermyntrude,” etc.,
enclosed them with the articles, ad-
dressed and posted them to myself and
rode home again.
On Christmas morning I opened them
in public with a vast flourish, and left
the touching little dedications lying care-
lessly about where anybody could read
them. From the glances of wonder and
respect which flashed at me from all
sides I gathered that everybody did.
The sensation was both novel and pleas-
ing. One parcel, however, there was
which I had not sent myself. It had
been forwarded on by the “Punch"
Office, marked, “Please do not crush,”
and carefully tied and sealed. My heart
leapt. “By Jove!" said I, “a genuine
Christmas present. Somebody loves me
after all. Perhaps a duchess has sent
me her tiara.”
With trembling fingers I unlaced the
strings. The household crowded about
me, panting with envy and excitement.
Reverently I folded the multitudinous
wrappings back and revealed a very old,
very dilapidated silk slipper, severely
busted at the toe and stuffed with sticky
sweets, a small female doll, and a note
—“With all best wishes to PATLANDER
for a happy Christmas, and many thanks
for useful hints contained in Punch
issue, December 10th, 1919.”
I may remind you that in the issue
mentioned was an epistle from me to
you recommending the Post as a means
of disposing of rubbish, with special
reference to worn-out foot-gear. I only
wish I knew who played this trick on
me, Ginger; I would like to give him
something ingeturn—say an old footer-
boot—with my foot inside.

Slightly deaf Footman (announcing each guest in character). “MR. JoNEs—THE LAST of THE BANDIEs.”
THE WHAT-NOT.
“Look here,” I said, “this is indeed
serious. The what-not's moulting.”
“It's been like that for a long time,”
said Anna. “But I suppose it's getting
worse.”
“I’m afraid so. And we must have
something reliable,” I said, “to stand
dishes and things on at meals. We
can't pile them all on the table at once
like a cairn. To tell you the truth,” I
added, “I’ve had my eye on an old
oak dresser at Smalley's for a long time.
It would be a good investment—at a
price.”
“Yes,” said Anna; “but I suppose
the price would be the earth and the
fulness thereof.”
“That is precisely what I propose to
find out, and if they'll take anything
less than thirty pounds it's ours. In
the meantime,” I added, “we’ll dope
the poor old what-not with furniture
cream and see about driving it to
market.”
There are two accepted methods of
dealing at old furniture shops. The
first is to approach them, well-groomed,
be-ringed and perfumed, smoking a
with a circular movement of the arm
to expose the gold wrist-watch that
will crawl up the sleeve at wrong mo-
ments, and to ask in a commanding
voice, “How much is the—ah—oak-
dresser—what?”
The presiding genius (and being a
dealer he is usually a genius), who had
really ticketed the article thirty pounds,
approaches it, removes the ticket by a
little sleight-of-hand and says, “Thirty-
eight guineas, Sir," without a blush
(the dealer who blushes is hounded from
the ring). This method of dealing is
direct action of the most dangerous
kind.
The other method, and the one I
most usually adopt, I can best illustrate
by detailing my interview with the
proprietor of Smalley's on the occasion
when I went dressering.
I sidled into the shop in garments
carefully selected from my pre-ward-
robe and wearing a vacant expression.
Picking up a piece of china I examined
it carefully, turning it upside down, as
though to search for a pottery mark,
which I probably should never have
recognised.
“H'm, not bad,” I said.
I've ever had,” said the dealer. “I
want—”
“Ah, German,” I said, putting the
thing down hurriedly as though it
might be mined. “It may be a good
piece, but—what is the price of that
brass fender ?”
“Seven-ten, old Dutch and a bar-
gain,” said the dealer laconically.
“But probably wouldn't fit the fire-
place in my mind. Though,” I added
to myself, “it might fit the one in our
dining-room.”
I thought it about time to notice the
dresser, not to attempt to buy it yet—
oh dear no, but merely to fire the first
shot in the campaign as it were.
“What kind of a dresser do you call
this?” I said. - “Slightly moth-eaten,
isn't, it 2 ”
“That's nothing; merely age. It's
Welsh,” he added, “and a beauty. I
wish I could get hold of more like it.
Look at those legs; I'll guarantee you
won't— Excuse me, Sir.”
An immaculately dressed individual
had entered the shop, and the gentle-
man trading as Smalley called an as-
sistant to serve him. By the time he
returned to me I had wandered far into














jewelled gasper and entering the shop

easily, having seen thirty
busily examining a walnut stool with a
woolwork seat.
“You haven't one like this in oak, I
suppose? This one,” I said, “would
hardly suite my suit. That sounds
wrong, but you apprehend my mean-
ing.” º
# I haven't,” he said simply. I could
see that he was tiring rapidly, but
wasn't absolutely ripe for plucking.
So I priced about a dozen pieces of
china, admired several pictures and
pieces of Stuart needlework, descanted
on the beauties of a set of wheatear
chairs, pulled a small rosewood table
about until its claw and ball feet nearly
dropped off from exhaustion, and finally
led him back to the Welsh dresser.
“What's the price of
the Scotsman?” I said
guineas on the ticket
during the preliminary
examination.
“Twenty-nine pounds
to you,” he said wearily.
He evidently knew the
strict rules of the game.
“But look at those
legs,” I said. “They're
frightfully bent, aren't
they?”
“That's one of the
best features about it,”
he said. “Real Queen
Anne, those legs are.”
“Oh, were hers like
that ? I didn't know,”
I said. “Look here, I'll
give you twenty-eight
pounds, spot cash.”
“Very well,” he said.
“I like to do business.”
“I beg pardon,” said a
voice behind me, which,
in turning, I discovered
to belong to the assistant, “but that
dresser's sold. The gentleman who's
just left bought it.” -
As I was looking for the ticket (which
had disappeared), I couldn't help over-
hearing the assistant's aside to his
employer.
“Thirty-five guineas cash,” he said.
There is something, after all, to be
said for direct action.

IT is a very delicate task that the
annual pantomime imposes upon Mr.
ARTHUR Col.IINs. He has to “surpass
himself,” but he must not do it once for
all or he would rob the critics of their
most cherished phrase. He reminds
me of the constructors of our Atlantic

two than the last, each swifter by a
fraction of a knot, each with a few more

advance in one respect at least—that
the grotesque and the beautiful are kept
reasonably apart ; the lovely colour-
scheme, for instance, of the garden in
Fairyland is undisturbed by any element
of buffoonery. There was a revival too
of topical allusiveness after the reticence
proper to war-time; and the GEDDEs
family must be justifiably flattered by
their admission to a choric refrain.
The humour, of which Mr. STANLEY
LUPINo bore the brunt, was here and
there a little thin, and it is time that
somebody let the Management of Drury
Lane into the open secret that the pun,
as an instrument of mirth, has long been
a portion of the dreadful past. Mr. WILL
Evans, as the Baroness Beaua champs,
seldom let himself go, being no doubt
held in restraint by a consciousness of
his resemblance to Miss ELLEN TERRY.

a very nice sense of fun. As for Mr.
CLAFF, who played the operatic Baron,
his most humorous moment was when
he meant to be most serious. This was
in a song in praise of Prince Charming,
“featuring” H.R.H. in a portrait curi-
ously unlike the original.
The two most effective incidents were
borrowed from the Circus and the Halls.
Mr. DU CALION, who had no other very
obvious claims to play the part of a
humorous courtier, did his famous
ladder-feat—a perfectly gratuitous per-
formance, for, though he was supposed
to be rescuing Cinderella through a top-
storey window, she had the good sense
to descend by the staircase, having ig-
nored, as is the way of Love, the locked
door that made this im-
possible.
The other imported
business was the work of
a black horse, who pre-
served an expression of
extreme gravity and de-
tached boredom during
the play of human wit
around his person, dis-
simulating his own su-
perior gifts of humour
until called upon to illus-
trate them with some ex-
cellent circus-tricks.
On the sentimental side,
Miss MARIE BLANCHE,
obedient to the inexor-
able tradition that a
young hero of pantomime
must be a woman, played
Prince Charming with
the right manners that
makyth man; and as Cin-
derella Miss FLORENCE
SMITHSoN once more
breathed that air of in-
nocence which still re-
mains unstaled by years of steady addic-
tion to the heroine habit. Her vocal in-
trusions, always well received, were not
always well timed ; certainly it was an
error of judgment to insert a solo at
the cross-roads after she had told us
that she hadn't a moment to spare if
she was to get home from the ball
before the rest of the family. But here
again it was a matter of obedience to
some unwritten and inscrutable law of
pantomime which it is not for us, the
profane, to question.
And in this spirit I tender a grateful
acknowledgment not only of the good
things that my intelligence could ap-
preciate in this lavish entertainment,
but also of the other things that I can
never hope to understand. O. S.

“I remember, I remember . . ." Still on every side echoes
the poet's cry, while scarce a publisher but can prove that
the thoughts of age make long, long books. Certainly not
the shortest of these, but among the most readable, is
A Medley of Memories (ARNoLD), in which the Right Rev.
Sir DAVID HUNTER-BLAIR has embodied the recollections
of his very active career as Benedictine monk and a leading
figure in the world of British Catholicism. Eton, Oxford,
Rome, and (of course) his own famous monastery at Fort
Augustus, are the chief scenes of it; and about them all
Sir DAVID talks vividly, even brilliantly. I am not saying
that all this pleasant garrulity would not have been the
better for the blue pencil, especially in those chapters in
which the writer's memory dwells almost to excess upon
the births, marriages, deaths and dinner-parties of the
orthodox Peerage. Elsewhere, however, Sir DAvid finds
occasion in plenty for the exercise of a wit so dextrously
handled that often his thrust is delivered before you have
realized that the rapier has left its sheath. I had marked a
score of examples for quotation (and now have space for
none) and twice as many good stories. In the Oxford
recollections it was pleasant to renew my own lively
memories of a certain notorious lecture by Mr. WALTER
WALSH on Ritualistic Societies, when violence was
narrowly averted by the tactful chairmanship of the
present LoRD CHANCELLOR-a lecture from which (as
Mr. BELLoc observed at the time) “each member of the
large audience departed confirmed and strengthened in
whatever convictions he might previously have entertained.”
latter-day gleanings which he has been compelled to dis-
miss for the present as being too recent for print.
Mr. G. B. STERN has set himself to study with sympathy
and a candour which extenuates nothing the Jew in England
in the circumstances of war, and in particular the Jew of
German origin completely loyal to the country of his
adoption, but suspected and persecuted by such simple folk
(and journals) as are content to put their faith in equally
simple proverbs about leopards and spots. I suppose if
Children of No Man's Land (DUckworth) has a hero and
heroine you will find them in Richard Marcus and his sister
Deborah. Young Richard, passionately English, with all
the simple unquestioning loyalty of the public-school boy,
counts the months to the day when he can testify to this by
bearing arms in his country's defence, but finds nothing open
but internment or (by much wangling) a possible niche in
a Labour battalion. Deborah's adventures are chiefly of
the heart, or what passes for the heart with a common type
of modern girl anxious to wring every sensation out of life
that playing with fire can give. It does not do to betray
one's age by expressing too confidently the idea that much
of all the goings-on of Deborah and her friends Gillian and
Antonia seems impossible. Mr. STERN certainly writes as
if he knew what he was writing about, and there is so rich an
exuberance in the way he crowds his canvas, and so much
humour expressed and repressed in his point of view, that I
found this a distinctly entertaining and instructive book.

Field Artillery. If he evinces, blatantly at times, the mo-
tives and perspective of the propagandist, he is justified by
the fact that he most ardently practised the Hun hatred
which he preaches. He states that he enjoyed the dangers
and discomforts of so doing, and his assertion is proved to be
a true one by his having returned again and again to the
fray, notwithstanding every excuse and temptation to leave
it. The book follows on after his Khaki Courage, and is
also in the form of letters to his people at home. It takes
up the narrative at April 14th, 1917, and carries it to the
triumphant end. When, by reason of his wounds, he had
to leave the Front and work in London and elsewhere, he
naturally lost touch with the real business of the battle;
even after his return to the Front in April, 1918, his letters
lack their original sense of actuality, and I, reading them,
began to wonder if he was ever going to recover his former
style. Happily he does so, and with his letter of July 11th
and then the old Northern counsel to “get eendways wi'
it" does hover in the background of one's mind I repeat
that sincerity carries the thing through. For all that, how-
ever, The . Fairing did but confirm me in a previous
impression that these Mary-call-the-cattle home localities
must remain more convenient to the local colourist than
attractive to the inhabitants.
The publication, as a foreword, of a “Glossary of Native
Words” used in the text made me wonder whether I
should be bored or instructed, or both, by The Death Drum
(HURST AND BLACKETT). Most happily I was neither.
Miss MARGARET PETERson has built her novel, perhaps a

in Uganda, a quite uncommon setting. It is the story of

an almost insuperable sense of its having been “made on
purpose." I had therefore a double stroke of bad luck in find-
ing both these elements present in The Splendid Fairing
(MILLS AND Boon). But the more credit to Miss CoNSTANch
Holme, that, despite my increasing conviction that the
wrong prodigal would return, and that the powers of nature
were throughout almost visibly preparing to engulf him,
the gentle and unforced power of her story did hold my
attention till the final wave. Distinction shown in apparent
absence of effort would, I think, be my verdict on her
writing; she clearly knows her Northern farmer-folk with
the sympathy of intimate experience. I hope I have not
already suggested too much of the plot, a little tragedy of
the commonplace dealing with the relations between two
farming brothers, of whom the younger prospers while the
elder fails, and the life-long jealousies of their women.
Miss Hoºſe works, one may say, on a minute scale; the
short but simple annals of the poor interest her to the ex-
tent of providing an entire volume of three hundred odd
man of the best type for her satisfactory finish.
Few authors have a shrewder idea than Mr. P. G. Wode-
House of what the British and American public want in
the way of humour, and I do not know anyone more de-
termined to supply their requirements. He would be a dull
fellow indeed who did not appreciate the high spirits and
humorous situations to be found in A Damsel in Distress
(JENKINs). It is no small feat to maintain a riot of irre-
sponsible fun for more than three hundred pages, but Mr.
Wodehouse gets going at once, and keeps up the pace to
the end without even a pause to get his second wind. If
some of the characters—a ridiculous peer, his more ridicul-
ous sister and his most ridiculous butler—are of the “stock"
variety, Mr. Wodehouse's way of treating them is always
fresh and amusing. But in his next frolic I beseech him to
give golf and its tiresome lingo a complete rest.

FASHIONS FOR MEN.
[“Who will help the Disposal Board by starting some new fashion
that would enable it to get rid of a great consignment of kilts as worn
by the London Scottish, the Royal Scots and the Highland Light In-
fantry?”—Mrs. KELLA ray on the Disposal Board’s “Curiosity Shop.”]
THERE are who hanker for a touch of colour,
So to relieve their sombre air;
For me, I like my clothes to be much duller
Than what the nigger minstrels wear;
I hold by sable, drab and grey;
I do not wish to be a popinjay.
In vain my poor imagination grapples
With these new lines in fancy shades,
These purple evening ooats with yellow lapels,
These vests composed in flowered brocades;
Nor can I think that noisy checks
Would help me to attract the other sex.
With gaudy schemes that rouse my solemn dander
I leave our frivolous youth to flirt;
A riband round my straw—for choice, Leander;
A subtle nuance in my shirt;
For tie, the colours of my school—
These are the limits of my austere rule.
But, when they'd have me swathe the clamorous
tartan
In lieu of trousers round my waist,
Then they evoke the spirit of the Spartan
Inherent in my simple taste;
Inexorably I decline
To drape the kilt on any hips of mine.
It may be they will count me over-modest,
Deem me Victorian, dub me prude;
I may have early views, the very oddest,
On what is chaste and what is rude;
Yet am I certain that my leg
Would not look right beneath a filibeg,
I love the Scot as being truly British;
Golf (and the Union) makes us one;
Yet to my nature, which is far from skittish
And lacks his local sense of fun,
There is a something almost foreign
About his strange attachment to the sporran.
So, when a bargain-sale is held of chattels
Surviving from the recent War—
Textiles and woollens, built for use in battles—
And Scotland's there inquiring for -
The kilt department, I shall not
Be found competing. She can have the lot.

“—four hundred yards from the Central Tube, to be
exact; and there's a large roller skating-rink next door.
You never rolled, did you? Three sessions daily, the ad-
vertisement says.”
“I'm afraid I sat oftener than that when I rolled,” I
confessed. “‘Another transport split,’ as the evening
papers say. I wonder whether Sir ERIC GEDDEs is the
rink-controller. But tell me a little about the house. I
“There are.”
“Next, please.”
“The next is at Chiswick; very damp and miles and
miles to catch your bus. And there's a basement again.”
“You might grow mushrooms in the basement,” I said
hopefully, “while I hunted my Pimlico on the shore.
What about the third 2 ”
“The third is at Hampstead, very high up and very
salubrious. The agent says we should be able to overlook
the whole of London.”
“Impossible,” I protested; “you can't ignore a thing like
London.” -
“I don't think he meant that exactly,” she explained.
“He said that from the top bedroom window on bright
days one could catch a glimpse of the dome of St. Paul's.”
“That will be rather fine,” I agreed. “We can have
afternoon receptions in the top bedroom, and print “To meet
the Dean and Chapter’ on the card. People love meeting
Chapters in real life. What is the rental of this eyrie 2."
She told me. It was as high as the site; and, again,
there was a dug-out underneath.
“You haven't tried Ponder's End 2 " I said at last. “I’ve
often seen those words on a bus, and a lot of sad-looking
people on the top, pondering, I suppose, the inevitable end.”
“Well, which of them are we going to choose? It's the
servant problem that's the real trouble, you know. They
simply won't cope with a basement nowadays.”
“I think you overestimate the help crisis,” I said. “There
are two things that they really want. The first is to have
employers absolutely dependent on them, and the second is
a gay life. To take the first. I remember that when I was
in digs—”
“Do you mind if I knit?” she asked.
—“when I was in digs it was my landlady's fondest
delusion that I could do nothing to help myself. And, of
course, I was bound to foster the idea. Every night I used
to hide my pipe behind the coal-scuttle or my latchkey
in the aspidistra, just for her to find. There was rather a
terrible moment once when she came in unexpectedly and
caught me losing half-a-crown underneath the hearth-rug;
but I pretended to be finding it, and saved the situation.
It will be just the same with you. You will go down into
the basement and pretend to mistake the flour for the salt,
and the cook will love you for ever. It's all done by
kindness and incompetence.”
“I suppose it is,” she said doubtfully.
“And then there's amusements,” I went on. “We
will have Charles in once or twice a week. No servant
who has ever heard Charles trying to sing would prefer
a night out at the cinema or the skating-rink. If she does,
we'll get a gramophone.”
“Not for worlds,” she gasped.
“Oh, you wouldn't have to listen to it. It would live in
the basement, and HARRY LAUDER would help the girl to
clean the knives and break the cups, and GEORGE RoREY
would make washing the dishes one grand sweet song.
The basement would be a fairyland.”
“All this doesn't seem to get us much further,” she com-
plained, “in deciding which of those houses we're going
to take.”
“Oh, doesn't it?” I said, and, sitting down, I wrote a few
lines rapidly and handed her the draft for approval. She
approved.
And that is why, if you look at The Times' “Domestic
Situations” column to-morrow, you may see the following
announcement :—

AND whAT ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN ?”
OUR INVINCIBLE NAVY.
ORDEAL BY WATER.
WHEN the innermost recesses of the
Admiralty archives yield their secrets
to the historian there will be some
strange and stirring events to relate.
But however diligently the chroniclers
may search amongst the accumulated
records at Whitehall there will still re-
main one outstanding performance, one
shining example of courage and endur-
ance of which no trace can there be
found; for it was never officially known
how Reginald McTaggart upheld the
honour of the White Ensign in the Gulf
of Lyons.
Reginald does not in the ordinary
way suffer from excess of modesty;
indeed he has been known to hint that
on more than one occasion it was pri-
marily due to his efforts that the world
was eventually made safe for democracy;
but of this his greatest exploit he will
never speak without pressure, and even
then but diffidently.
When WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN first
cried “Havoc" and let slip the Prussian
Guard, Reginald was among the most
unsophisticated of landsmen. He had
never in his life so much as heard a
tinguish a battleship from a bathing-
machine. But the blood of a maritime
ancestry ran hot in his veins, and, being
too highly educated to get on in the
Army, he placed himself at the disposal
of the Senior Service, which embraced
him gladly. Henceforth his career was
one of unbroken triumph.
Having taken a First in Mechanical
Sciences at Cambridge, Reginald was
at once detailed off for deck-swabbing
on a Portsmouth depôt ship; but one
day an enterprising Rear-Admiral of the
younger school, noting his scientific
manner of manipulating a squeegee, had
him sent before the Flag Captain, who,
on learning his antecedents, recom-
mended the blushing Reginald for the
post of batman to the Senior Wireless
Officer. Here his talents showed to
such advantage that in a little over
a year he received a commission as
technical officer, and was placed in
charge of an experimental Torpedo
School, well away from the storms
and tempests that vexed his less gifted
brothers.
It were tedious to relate Reginald's
adventures during the next two years
—how time and again he baffled the
cunning devices of the German naval
billiard-table for use on drifters in rough
weather and perfected an electro-mag-
netic contrivance by means of which
enemy submarines were inveigled into
torpedoing themselves without warn-
ing. All this and much else is accessible
to the formal historian ; besides, Reg-
inald tells people himself. We will
hurry on to the grand exploit.
It occurred shortly after he was ap-
pointed to a post on the British Naval
Mission at Athens. He had left England
little more than a month when the Sea
Lords became uneasy. Trouble broke
out among the torpedoes and there was
no one to set matters right. Paragraphs
began to appear in the Press. The result
was an urgent wireless message to
Athens recalling Reginald at once.
There was to be no delay.
“Are you prepared to start immedi-
ately?" asked the Vice-Admiral, when
he had briefly outlined the situation.
Reginald saluted briskly.
“I don't quite know how you'll go,”
continued the Vice-Admiral. “We

“I start in the morning, Sir," said
Reginald tersely.
The Vice-Admiral seized his hand
and wrung it warmly.
When Reginald came down to the
harbour and saw the craft on which he
had undertaken to embark he was seized
with a sudden faintness. Even the
toughest seafarer would have thought
twice before venturing beyond the
breakwater in such an unsavoury dere-
lict; and Reginald, be it remembered,
had only once in his life made a sea
voyage, and that in the peaceful secur-
ity of an ironclad. His heart quailed
beneath his Commander's uniform.
However, setting his teeth and con-
soling himself with the thought that
she would undoubtedly fall to pieces
before they could leave the harbour
behind, he went aboard.
The master, an unprepossessing but
exceedingly polite child of the AEgean,
was overwhelmed at the prospect of
carrying a British Naval Commander
as passenger. He saluted wildly; he
gesticulated ; it was too much hon-
our. Would his Excellency the Com-
mander accept the use of his poor state-
room—yes? Would he undertake the
navigation of this so dangerous voyage
—no 2 Ah, but he would seek his so
expert advice in the sudden perilous mo-
ment—good. Reginald bowed nervously.
At first all went well. Except for the
atmosphere of the state-room, which
was richly tinged with a mixed odour
of mildewed figs and rotten pomegran-
ates, and the uncomfortable feeling that,
unlesshetroddelicately,the decks would
crumble away and deposit him in the
bosom of the Mediterranean, Reginald
was fairly happy. A ready wit and a
dignified bearing combined to cloak his
lack of seamanship and kept the skipper
in a fit state of humility and awe.
But in the Gulf of Lyons a breeze
sprang up. It was quite a gentle breeze
at first, and Reginald found it rather
stimulating. Towards evening, how-
ever, it freshened, and the ship began
to stagger. Reginald became conscious
of those disquieting symptoms com-
mon to landsmen in such case. Fearful
for his reputation he crept below to
suffer in solitude.
By midnight it was blowing a gale,
and Reginald had lost interest in life.
He was thinking mournfully of the
vanity of all human desires when a
message was brought from the captain.
They were about to perish. Would his
Excellency the Commander come up to
the bridge and save them, please?
It was a painful predicament, and
Reginald was justly horrified. Could

ness of the British Navy in the face of a

cabin and allow the Master to doubt
his courage and resource? He rose and
lurched unsteadily on deck.
The Captain was distinctly excited.
Destruction was imminent. He had
appealed to the Saints without avail.
Would the British Commander come

Excellency think of it?
Reginald thought it was perſectly

A PAINFUL SUBJECT.
I Do not love dentists. In this anti-
pathy I am not unique, I fancy. One
never sees photographs of family den-
tists standing on mantelpieces heavily
framed in silver; and, though The For-
ceps presents a coloured supplement
depicting a prominent ivory - hunter
with every Christmas number, there
is, I am told, no violent demand for it
outside the Profession.
This is not to be wondered at. A
man who spends his life climbing into
people's mouths and playing “The
Anvil Chorus” on their molars with a
monkey-wrench, who says, “Now this
won't hurt you in the least,” and then
deals one a smart rap on a nerve with
a pickaxe—such a man cannot expect
to be popular. He must console him-
self with his fees.
I do not love dentists, I repeat, but I
am also not infatuated with toothache.
It is not that I am a coward. Far
follicular tonsillitis and, above all,
sleeping sickness I can bear with forti-
tude—that is, I feel sure I could—but
toothache, no! I am not ashamed of
it. Every brave man has at least one
weakness. Lord Roberts's was cats.
Achilles' was tendons. Mine is tooth-
ache (Biographers, please note). When
my jaw annoys me I try to propitiate
it with libations of whisky, brandy,
iodine, horse-blister and patent pana-
ceas I buy from sombreroed magicians
in the Strand. If these fail I totter
round to the dentist, ring the bell and
run away. If the maid catches , me
before I can escape and turns me into
the waiting-room I examine the stuffed
birds and photographs of Brighton Pier
until she has departed, then slither
quietly down the banisters, open the
street door and gallop. If I am pushed
directly into the abattoir I shake the
dentist warmly by the hand, ask after
his wife and children, his grandfather
and great-aunt, and tell him I have
only dropped into tune the piano. If
that is no good I try to make an ap-
pointment for an afternoon this year,
next year, some time, never. If that
too is useless and he insists on putting
me through it there and then, I take
every anodyne he's got—cocaine, mor-
phia, chloroform, ether, gas, also a
couple of anaesthetists to hold my hand
when I go off and kiss me when I come
round again.
One of my chief objections to dentists
is that they will never listen to reason;
explanations are quite thrown away on
them. They only let you talk at all in
order to get your face open, and then
into it they plunge their powerful anti-
septic-tasting hands and you lose some-
thing. I never go near a dentist with-
out paying the extreme penalty. (None
of those cunning little gold-tipped
caps or reinforced concrete suspension-
bridges forme. Out it comes. Blood and
iron every time). I admit they frequently
appease my anguish. Almost invariably
among the teeth of which they relieve
meat each sitting is included the offend-
ing one. But still I maintain my right
to have a say in my own afflictions.
The doctors let one. I've got a phy-
sician who lets me have any disease
I fancy (except German measles and
Asiatic cholera; for patriotic reasons
he won't hear a good word spoken for
either of them; says we've got just as
good diseases of our own. Damned
insularity'). -
If I send for this doctor he comes
along, sits quietly beside my bed, eating
my grapes, while I tell him where the
pain isn't. The recital over he hands
me a selection of ailments to pick from.
I choose one. He tells me what the
creeps downstairs and breaks the news
to the hushed and awe-stricken family.
A chap like that makes suffering a
pleasure and is a great comfort in
a home like mine, where a sick bed is
the only sort you are allowed to lie in
after 10 A.M. Without the fellow's
ready sympathy I doubt if I should
secure any sleep at all. One gets no
assistance of that kind from dentists,
although they give you more pain in
ten seconds than a doctor does in ten
years.
No dentist ever sees me home after
the slaughter, orders me a diet of chicken
breast, péche Melba and champagne,
or warns my family that I am on no
account to be disturbed until lunch.
No, they jerk your jaw off its hinges
and dump your remains on the doorstep
for the L.C.C. rubbish cart to collect.
Another thing: dentists should not
be allowed out loose about the streets.
They exercise a blighting influence.
You are strolling along in the sun-

MY FIRE.
“SEVENTY-FIVE per cent. of the
world's accidents arise from gross care-
lessness!” I thundered at Suzanne, who
for the fifteenth time in five years of
matrimony had left her umbrella in the
'bus. Being on a month's leave, and
afraid of losing by neglect the orderly-
room touch, I thought fit to practise
on her the arts of admonition. Ad-
monishing, I wagged at her the match
with which I was in the act of lighting
my pipe. Wagging the match, I did
not notice the live head drop off on to
the khaki slacks which I had donned
that afternoon to grace a visit to the
War Office. Only when I traced
Suzanne's petrified stare to its target
inspiring thought struck me. Eagerly I
made my way to the writing-table and
drew out a long and bulky envelope
from the bottom drawer. For some
time I sat there carefully mastering
its contents.
“What's that funny-looking thing
you're reading 2" asked my wife at
last.
“Oh, nothing important,” I answered
as casually as I could. “Er—by the
way, do you know we're insured 2"
“Considering that I've paid the pre-
miums regularly while you were away,
I should think I ought to know.”
“Of course I shall put in a claim for
the slacks,” I murmured.
“But how can you?” she asked, and
wondering looked at me. “I read the
other Aerial Craft, Storm, Tempest,
Subterranean Fire . . . . .” -
“Monsoon, Typhoon, Volcano, Ava-
lanche," put in Suzanne impatiently.
“Cut the cataclysms and come to the

sweetly. “What percent-

And I did so to the fol-

“77, The Supermansions,
S. W.
“DEAR SIRs, I regret
to inform you that a fire
took place atſin the above
demesne and/or flat after
tea to-day and damaged
one (1) pair of khaki

render them unfit for fur-

repair.
“Well, anyhow I've three weeks to
get them in,” I said as lightly as I
could. “My leave isn't up till the end
of the month.”
“Men's clothes are terribly dear just
now,” remarked Suzanne pensively.
“And I was going to ask you to give
me a new hat. But now I suppose—”
This roused my pride and self-respect.
“Suzanne,” I said, “the world is
not coming to an end because I have
to buy a pair of slacks. You shall have
your new hat to-morrow.”
She clapped her hands in triumph,
and a moment's reflection showed me
that I had been caught. If it hadn't
been for the conflagration she would
never have dared to ask for a new hat.
Now I came to remember, I had taken
her out and bought her one on the first
day of my leave.
However, the damage was done
(twice over, in fact), and I sat gently
policy once, and as far as I remember
there's nothing whatever about khaki
slacks in it.”
“Do you know what this policy is 2"
I exclaimed, brandishing the document
impressively. “It's a Comprehensive
Householder's policy. I don't know
what a Comprehensive Householder is,
but I think I must be one.”
“But I'm sure it says nothing about
slacks,” she objected.
“Comprehensive!” I shouted. “That
means all-embracing. This policy em-
braces my slacks.”
“That sounds almost indelicate.”
“Listen. “Whereas the undermen-
tioned, hereinafter called the Accused—
the Assured, I mean—has paid blank
pounds, shillings and pence Premium
or Consideration . . . to insure him/her
from loss ordamage by Lightning, Explo-
sion, Earthquake, Thunderbolts . . .'”
“Oo-er,” said Suzanne with a shiver.
Next day I took Suzanne out to buy
the new hat. This done, we went on
to my tailor's to replace the ill-starred
slacks. A casual inquiry as to price
elicited the statement that it would be
four guineas. I cut short a rambling
discourse, in which the tailor sought to
saddle various remote agencies with the
responsibility for the increase, and
stamped out of the establishment with
the blasphemous vow that I'd get a
pair ready-made at the Stores.
That evening I received a reply from
the Insurance people:—
“In all communications please quote

Soulful Party. “AH, YES, THE world Is ALways so—we NEVER STREw Flowers on A MAN's GRAVE UNTIL AFTER HE IS DEAD.”
THE CANDOUR OF KEYNES.
(Suggested by the perusal of “The Economic Consequences
of the Peace.”)
THERE was a superior young person named KEYNES
Who possessed an extensive equipment of brains,
And, being elected a Fellow of King's,
He taught Economics and similar things.
On the outbreak of war he at once made his mark
As a “tempy,” but Principal, Treasury Clerk,
And the Permanent Staff and the CHANCELLOR too
Pronounced him a flier and well worth his screw.
So he went to the Conference, not as a mute,
To act as the CHANCELLOR's chief substitute,
And in this extremely responsible post
He mingled with those who were ruling the roast.
The Big and redoubtable Three, 'tis confessed,
By his talent and zeal were immensely impressed;
But, conversely, the fact, which is painful, remains
That they failed to impress the redoubtable KEYNEs.
So, after five months of progressive disgust,
He shook from his feet the Parisian dust,
Determined to give the chief Delegates beans
And let the plain person behind the Peace scenes.
Though his title is stodgy, yet all must admit
That his pages are seasoned with plenty of wit;
He's alert as a cat-fish; he can't be ignored;
For he's not a mere slinger of partisan ink,
But a thinker who gives us profoundly to think;
And his arguments cannot be lightly dismissed
With cries of “Pro-Hun" or of “Pacificist.”
And yet there are faults to be found all the same;
For example, I doubt if it's playing the game

“GRANDFATHER, I simply LovE You R NICE LONG BEARD. PROMISE ME You 'LL NEveR HAVE IT BoBBED.”
THE EGOIST.
ON Monday morning Hereward Vale
left home in an unsettled state of mind.
That was putting it mildly. He was
thoroughly unhappy. Something was
up—he couldn't tell what—or whether
it was his own fault or Mary's. Anyhow,
it didn't seem to matter whose fault it
was. The thing had happened. That
was the one overwhelming idea that
concerned him. The first shadow had
fallen ; their record of complete and
perfect happiness was broken.
The road to the station was a long
and particularly beautiful one. Here-
ward had always appreciated every
inch of it. But to-day he hated it. He
hated the way the yew-trees drooped,
the leafless branches of the hazels, the
faded, crumpled blackberry, the scat-
tered decaying leaves. It was really
a remarkable day for November—clear
and frosty, with a bright blue sky and
scudding white clouds. A strong north-
east wind tested one's vitality. Here-
ward's was low. He buttoned his collar
and hurried on.
Mary had never treated him quite
tender, sympathetic and understanding
with his moods. True, he was trying;
but she had known that before she
married him. He was an artist, and
an artist's work, he argued, depended
largely on the state of his emotions.
He earned the family bread by the
labour of his hands and his hand was
the servant of his mind, and his mind
a tempest of moods. Mary had applied
herself to her task with creditable skill.
She could always turn his sullenness
to a sort of creative melancholy of
which he was rather proud; his rest-
lessness to energy and his discontent
to something like constructive thinking.
How she achieved the miracle he did
not know, nor did he inquire. But he
was guided by her as a child by its
mother, still constantly rebelling.
But to-day the machinery had broken
down. Mary had been cool, pleasant
and crisply unemotional at breakfast-
time. He had woken up cross and
with a headache. He had a muddled
feeling and wanted sorting out. But
Mary seemed quite unaware of it. She
had a preoccupied manner; she went
about just too cheerfully, chatting just
was mechanical, Hereward decided, and,
anyway, it wasn't at all what he wanted.
His monosyllabic responses were ac-
cepted as perfectly right and natural,
when they were nothing of the sort.
She did not get up and pass her hand
lovingly and soothingly over his hair
and say things appropriate to his state
of mind. She went on with her break-
fast and looked after him kindly enough,
but without solicitude.
For instance, she made no comment
on the fact that he had hardly touched
his bacon ; she merely removed his
plate and gave him marmalade and
toast as if he had left no bacon at all.
She didn't even notice the lines of
suffering on his face, the dark circles
under his eyes. He cast a glance in
the mirror when her back was turned
to see if they were obvious. They were.
Why wasn't Mary catching his hump 2
She always did.
When finally he left the house, a
little bent, with no spring in his step,
Mary didn't accompany him to the
door. She didn't exchange with him
one of those rapid looks of complete
understanding that he had grown so


like this before. She had always been
accustomed to and found so sustaining
too pleasantly about trivial things. It

and helpful. She kissed him firmly and
coolly, almost casually. Just so she
might kiss an aunt.
The train journey was cold and
lonely. Nobody he knew was travelling
up to town. He bought a daily paper,
but the headlines put him off. They
were nearly all about divorce cases.
There was one about a man who had
lived for three years in the same house
with his wife without speaking to her.
Such things were possible! He gazed
out of the window. The wonderful day
had no charm for him. The feeling
of autumn only further increased his
sense of the loss of youth, of the decay
of romance. He nursed and nourished
his grievance. He desired that Mary
should know what a wreck she had
made of his day, possibly of his life.
He was in no mood for work. He
went up to his studio in Fitzroy Square
and muddled about with pens and ink.
He had what he called a good tidy up,
and firmly and consistently threw away
every relic of sentiment he had foolishly
preserved. At one o'clock, through
habit and not because he was hungry,
he went out and had a lonely lunch at
a small restaurant, sitting at a marble-
topped table which imparted to him
something of its chill. After that he
loafed about looking at things till dusk.
Dusk was quite unbearable. He fled
back to the studio, made up a stupen-
dous fire, lit a pipe and mused.
He decided not to go home that night.
He felt hurt and ill-used. He would
stay in town and have a thoroughly
good time. As the idea struck him he
looked round the studio. The corners
were dismal and shadowy. Everything
not in the immediate circle of the fire
looked grey and cheerless. His easel,
with a bit of drapery thrown across it,
was like a spectre with outstretched
arms. It suggested despair. He could
think of no one whom he wanted to
see. There wasn't a soul he knew
whom he would not in this crisis deli-
berately have avoided.
So he went to the Russian Ballet
and was bored. He had been excited
about Cleopatra the first time he had
seen it ; he now decided that it was a
great mistake to try to repeat emotional
experiences.
He left hurriedly before the pro-
gramme was half over. His feet took
him mechanically to Waterloo Station.
He looked up a train. The 9.30 was
due out; he sprinted and caught it.
The carriage he managed to get into
was empty and warm. He slept; he
slept all the way, and it did him good.
When he arrived at the other end

spangled. The walk out exhilarated

ran lightly down the leaf-strewn steps
of the old garden and looked in at the
window. Mary was seated at the fire.
She looked pensive, pretty and a little
sad. He whistled and she smiled up.
“Hooray!” she said, “I'd nearly given
you up.” She slipped round and had
the door open before he could get out
his key and drew him in. She helped
him off with his coat and scanned his
face with even more than her usual

Their extemporised supper was a
great success, and they sat before the

AT THE PLAY.
“MR. PIM PASSES BY.”
“The year's at the spring
And day's at the morn . . .
God's in His heaven—
All's right with the world !”
WHEN Pippa “passed,” singing songs
like that and preoccupied with the
splendid fact of her one day's holiday,
she unconsciously brought about a
change for the better in the heart or
conscience of all who overheard her.
It was not so with the passing of Mr.
Pim. Prior to his intrusion, there had
been nothing to disturb the well-ordered
existence of Geo. Marden, Esq., J.P.,
and his wife (late Mrs. Tell-
worthy), except that they did
not see eye to eye on the
small question of his niece's
early engagement to a young
artist and on the still smaller
question of futuristic cur-
tains. Then came Mr. Garra-
way Pim, a doddering old
gentleman, with a thin fal-
setto voice and a loosish mem-
ory, but otherwise harmless.
He arrives with an introduc-
tion from Australia and casu-
ally lets fall a tale of a fellow-
passenger with the unusual
name of Tellworthy, from
which—and other incidental
evidence—Mrs. Marden gath-
ers that her first husband (an
ex-convict) is still alive. Hav-
ing dropped this thunderbolt
he drifts off, leaving tragedy
in his wake. End of Act I.
Marden, highly conscien-
tious, takes the orthodox view
that his lawless marriage
must be nullified. His wife,
though horrified at the resur-
rection of her impossible
first husband, permits herself to recog-
nise the humorously ironic side of
things. Mr. Pim, fortunately located
in the immediate neighbourhood, is
sent for that he may throw further
light on the painful subject of Tell-
worthy's revival. He now reports—
what he had vaguely imagined himself
to have mentioned in the first instance
—that Tellworthy had met his death
at Marseilles through swallowing a
herring-bone. The Second Act closes
with a burst of jubilant hysterics on
the part of Mrs. Marden.
But the situation is only partially
relieved. True, the old husband is dead
all right, but the Mardens' marriage is
still bigamous; they have been living
all this time in what would be regarded
in the eyes of Heaven (and, still worse,
the county of Bucks) as sin. However,
can rectify this and nobody need be
any the wiser. This at least is Mar-
den's attitude, always free from any
suspicion of complexity. But his wife
(if that is the word for her), being of a
more subtle nature, determines to make
profit out of the situation. She points
out to him that she is at present the
widow Tellworthy and that she must
be wooed all over again, and can only
be won on her own terms. These in-
clude a recognition of the niece's en-
gagement (has not the young artist an
equal right with Marden to a speedy
marriage with the woman of his choice?)
and a concession to her taste in futur-
istic curtains.
A DROPPER OF UNCONSIDERED TRIFLEs.
Mr. Pim,
Mrs. Marden .
At this juncture Mr. Pim drifts in
again to correctanerror of memory. The
name of the gentleman who succumbed
to the herring-bone was not Tellworthy
(he must have got that name into his
head through hearing it mentioned as
that of Mrs. Marden's first husband).
It was really Polwhistle—either Henry
or Ernest Polwhistle; he was not quite
sure which. Everything is thus re-
stored to the status quo ante, except
that Marden, in a spasm of generous
reaction, feels himself morally bound to
abide by the new conditions that his
wife had laid down.
Mr. Pim only passes by once more to
announce his settled conviction that
Polwhistle's Christian name was Ernest
and not Henry.
It will be seen that the play is
original in design; but it is also a true

—it owes nothing to the adventitious
aid of the costumier. For the author's
observation of the unities is extended to
include the matter of dress; he allows
his people one costume each and no
in ore.
Miss IRENE WANBRUGH played as if
every one of her words had been made
expressly for her, as, no doubt, they
were. I have never seen her so perfect
in detail, in the poise of her head, in
her least gesture and intonation, in her
swift changes of mood; never so quietly
mistress of the finesse of her art.
As Marden, Mr. BEN WEBSTER was
a little restless in a part for which he
was not constitutionally suit-
ed, but played with the great-
est courage and sincerity. Mr.
DION Boucicault's study of
Mr. Pim was extraordinarily
effective; and the way in
which he made the attenu-
ated pipings of this futile old
gentleman carry like the
notes of a bell was in itself a
remarkable feat.
These three were given
great chances, full of colour.
But in the part of Brian
Strange, the boy-lover, by its
nature relatively colourless,
Mr. LESLIE HowARD was
hardly less good. He never
made anything like a mistake
of manner. I wish I could
say the same of his flapper.
But Miss CoHAN asserted her
good spirits a little too boist-
erously for the picture.
I hope I shall not be sus-
pected of partiality towards
one of Mr. Punch's young
men if I say that this is the
best of the good things that
Mr. MILNE has given us. As
in his unacted play, The Lucky One, he
gives evidence of a desire, not unfrequent
in humourists, to be taken seriously.
But he knows by now that brilliant
dialogue is what is expected of him,
and he thinks, too modestly, that he
cannot afford to dispense with it for
long at a time. The result is that,
after stringing us up to face a tragic
situation, he is tempted to let us down
with light - hearted cynicisms. He
would hate me to suggest that Mr.
BERNARD SHAw has infected him, but
perhaps he wouldn't mind my hinting
at the influence of Sir JAMEs BARRIE.
Certainly his Mardens remind me of
the Darlings in Peter Pan. Just as there

the husband's real troubles and amuse-
ment at the wife's flippant attitude
towards the common tragedy.
I will not deny the sneaking pleasure
which this flippancy gave me at the
time, but in the light of calmer reflec-
tion I feel that Mr. MILNE would really
have pleased himself better if he could
have found the courage to keep the play
on a serious note all through the inter-
val between Mr. Pim's first and second
revelations. Apart from the higher
question of sincerity he would have
gained something, in an artistic sense,
by getting a stronger contrast out of the
change of situation that followed the
announcement of Tellworthy's demise.
In the First Act we seemed to have
a little too much of the young couple,
but this insistence was perhaps justified
by the important part which their affairs
subsequently played (along with the
leit-motif of the futuristic curtains) in
the readjustment of the relations be-
tween husband and wife. -
If I have any flaw to find in a really
charming play, I think it was a mis-
take for Mrs. Marden to let Mr. Pim
into the secret of her past. As with
the sweet influences of Pippa, so with
the devastating havoc wrought by the
inexactitudes of Mr. Pim, I think he
should have been left unconscious of
the effect of his passing.

ANOTHER CRISIS.
WHETHER it is due to war-weariness
or not the fact remains that the British
public view with apparent apathy the
new crises which arise day by day to
threaten their happiness and maybe to
change the whole course of their life.
Only a few mornings ago we read
in The Daily Chronicle the following
momentous statement made by that
newspaper's golf correspondent: “I’m
told that the thirty-one pennyweight
ball is doomed.” Doomed ! Yet, so far
as could be observed in the demeanour
of the pleasure-seekers in the Strand on
the afternoon of that same day, things
might have been exactly as they were
the day before.
We learn that the sub-committee in-
vestigating this matter of the thirty-one
pennyweight ball have consulted both
the manufacturers and the professionals.
A ray of hope is given by the statement,
made on good authority, that “the
manufacturers have adopted a very
reasonable attitude.” The country
should be grateful for this. But, on the
other hand, “the professionals want full
freedom in the selection of balls.”
To foster a false optimism at this
juncture would be criminal, and it may
as well be admitted at once that nego-
tiations are proceeding with difficulty.
As we go to press we learn that a pro-
tracted meeting, lasting from 2 P.M.
until after midnight, has been held.
The leader of the manufacturers, on
emerging from the conference hall, was
seen to look pale and exhausted. Push-
ing his way through the pressmen and
photographers he said, “Boys, for the
moment we are bunkered; we must em-
ploy the niblick. No, that is all I can tell
you;” and he walked quickly away with
his hand to his brow and muttering
words seldom heard off the course.
Equally grave, the organising secre-
tary of the professionals was even less
communicative, for he spoke in his
native tongue, and the Scotsman among
the reporters who undertook to translate
his remarks was unfortunately unable
to make himself understood.
The PRIME MINISTER’s Private Secre-
tary has issued to the Press a statement
that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE is keeping in
close touch with Walton Heath and the
progress of events, but that at present
no useful purpose would be served by
Government interference. -
The Daily Chronicle correspondent
also announces that representatives of
American golf are to visit St. Andrews
in the Spring to discuss the question.
We trust their visit may not be too late.
If the problem is one that can be solved
by dollars no doubt they will come
opinion on the British public. We can
only hope that international relation-
ships will not be strained by their
deliberations; let there be a spirit of
toleration and a recognition of the rights
of small nations, and all may yet be well.

Long, long ago they lived in sweet wide

Their homes were in the hedges, gay,

The people, though, came citywards to

“Then we,” the sparrows said, “must

“Yes, we're the birds to go, for all

Their hearts would break; but we're

But we can chirp and chirp and chirp

THE POST-WAR SPORTSMAN MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE HUNTSMAN. -
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Romance of Madame Tussaud's (ODHAMs) strikes one,
in these days of universal reminiscence, almost as a libre d
faire, certainly as a volume that finds its welcome waiting ||
for it. I suppose there are few unhappy beings for whom
the very name of that gifted lady does not revive something
of the nursery magic that is never quite forgotten. All of
which means that Mr. John T. TUSSAUD, who has written,
vivaciously and with obvious pleasure, this history of the
famous show, is (I hope) assured beforehand of his sales.
It is a fat record, taking the story from the earliest wax
profiles made by Dr. CURTIUs for the Parisian aristocracy in
the days before the Revolution; through the Terror, when
his niece (afterwards Madame TUSSAUD) was employed to
model notable heads from the basket of the guillotine,
which was itself subsequently to figure amongst the
attractions of her collection, and finally bringing the enter-
prising artist and her models to England and Baker Street,
whence a comparatively recent move established them (the
foundress in effigy only) in their present palace. I was espe-
cially interested to trace the evidence of close attention paid
to the show by Mr. Punch, and in particular to learn that the
title Chamber of Horrors was first invented by that observer;
though the author falls into an obvious chronological in-
exactitude in ascribing to these pages a cartoon by CRUIK-
shANK published “in November of Waterloo year.” I have
no space for the many queer stories, chiefly of encounters
between the quick and the wax, with which the book
graphs, of which I should have liked many more. Alto-
gether it gives an unusual sidelight on the history of two
Capitals; and incidentally, if the reading of it puts others
in the same resolve as myself, an extra turn-stile will be
needed in the Marylebone Road.
Mr. HARRY TIGHE is something of a problem to me.
With the best will in the world to appreciate what looked
like unusual promise I can only regard him at present as
one who is neglecting the good gifts of heaven in the pur-
suit apparently of some Jack-o'-lanthorn idea of popularity.
No doubt you recall his first novel, The Sheep Path, a
sincere and well-observed study of feminine temperament.
This was followed by one that (though it had its friends)
marked, to my thinking, a lamentable fall from grace. He
has now published a third, Day Dawn (WESTALL). Here,
though popularity of a kind may be its reward, the work is
still woefully beneath what should be Mr. TIGHE's level.
Certainly not one of the demands of the circulating
libraries is unfulfilled. We have a fair-haired heroine
(victim to cocaine), a dark and villainous foreigner, a dashing
hero, a middle-aged woman who adores him despite the
presence of her husband, himself called throughout Baron
Brinthall, a style surely more common in pantomimic
circles than in the drawing-rooms of Mayfair; and the
incidents embrace both murder and suicide. Moreover
there is “plenty of conversation,” and the intrigue moves
sufficiently quickly (if jerkily) to keep one curious about
the next page. But having very willingly admitted so
much I return to my contention, that for Mr. TIGHE to

main theme of this book is to show how much more for-

Whitehall than in the trenches and wire-entanglements of

Star of India (CASSELL) is what Mrs. ALICE PERRIN calls
her latest novel, a title so good that I can only wonder why
(or perhaps whether) it has not been used before. Inside
also I found excellent entertainment. One supposes the
author to have been confronted with two main problems
with regard to her plot—how to make sufficiently plausible
the marriage between a flapper (if you will forgive the odious
word) of seventeen and a middle-ageing Anglo-Indian; and,
secondly, how to impart any touch of novelty to the inevit-
able catastrophe that must attend this union. The first she
has managed by a ...} cunning suggestion of the mingled
jealousy, curiosity and boredom that drove Stella into the
arms of her elderly suitor; the second by a variety of
devices, to indicate which would be to give away the whole
intrigue–one, I may say, whose climax is not nearly so
visible from afar as that of most triangle tales. One point
only. I will reveal: Mrs. PERRIN has had the courage, while
yindicating her own common-sense judgment upon such
folk, to introduce a second girl, daughter and pupil of one
of the spoon-fed idealists who would govern India with
the platitudes of ignorance, and not only to make her

We may, I think, take
fiction pure and naively
simple, but that the ex-
periences of John Lyn-
wood, the hero, in the
Navy are given as the
actual experiences of Mr.
C. L. MoRGAN, the author.
Let me then at once say
that his revelations of the
bullying of junior by senior
midshipmen go back to a
period before the War.
These “shakings,” we are
that tiresome obsession of the ultra-realists that every-
thing that has ever happened is equally important in
retrospect. The narrator, Vanya Gombarov, a Russian
Jew, discourses reflectively and detachedly, as it were
from behind a mask, to an English artist friend about
his early childhood in his own land and the dismal
adventures of the Gombarov family in that underworld of
exploited and miserable aliens which is one of the root
social problems of America. Very poignantly Mr. John
CourNos makes you understand the import of the phrase
so constantly on the lips of such victims of their own
credulous hopes of El Dorado—"Woe to Columbus!” The
portrait of Vanya's stepfather, brilliant, magnanimous, pur-
sued by an AEschylean malignity of destiny, fills much of
the foreground and is a quite masterly piece of work. One
gannot be wrong in assuming this to be essential auto-
biography; there is a passionate conviction as of things
intimately seen and dreadfully suffered. Such material
might well have tempted to a mere piling of squalor upon
squalor. A fine discretion has given a noble dignity to a
record through which shines the unquenchable human
spirit. One passage, full of affectionate discernment about
London, will cause a flicker of just pride in everyone who
is authentic Cockney, whether by birth or adoptión. A big
book of its kind, I dare assert.
asked to believe, were due partly to custom and partly to
boredom caused by lack of leave. If Mr. MoRGAN is correct
both in his facts and surmises it is satisfactory to think
that the War must have obliterated the boredom which
provoked such excesses, and one need not be a fanatical
opponent of physical punishment to hope that such forms
of *} will never again be tolerated as a matter of
custom. I am obliged to conclude that these incidents in
Lynwood's career are absolutely true, for certainly nothing
less than absolute truth could excuse their appearance
in print; but at the same time I must confess that any
attack upon our Navy is apt with me to act as an
irritant. The more reason that I should honestly admit
Mr. MoRGAN's merits and say that he writes with a nice
sense of style, and that his book does not derive its only
interest from its revelations.

THE BENEFITs of PEACE
(as they appear to be viewed by certain unofficial guardians
of public morality).
WHEN Peace superseded the strife and the stress
Which the public regard as a gift for the Press,
It was feared in the quiet that followed the storm,
With nothing to do but retrench and reform,
That the Town would be painted a colourless tint
And the printers have nothing exciting to print.
That fear was unfounded, I'm happy to say,
And red is the dominant tone of to-day;
So far from incurring a shortage of news
While the place is made fit for our heroes to use,
We cannot remember a rosier time;
We have rarely enjoyed such an orgy of crime.
There are scandals as nice for the reader to nose
As any old garbage of carrion crows;
Our mystery-mongers are full of resource;
There's a bigamy boom and a vogue of divorce;
To the licence of flappers we freely allude,
And we do what we can with the cult of the nude.
No, the War isn't missed ; there's a murrain of strikes
Where a paper can take any side that it likes;
We are done with denouncing the filth of the Bosch,
But we still have our own dirty linen to wash;
Though we trade with the brute as a man and a brother,
Our Warriors still can abuse one another.
And if spicier features incline to be slack
There is always the Chief of the State to attack;
We have standing instructions to cake him with mud
And a couple of columns reserved for his blood.
Oh, yes, there is Peace, but our property thrives—
We are having, I tell you, the time of our live", S
OUR, BALLYBUN LOTTERY.
[X propos of Premium Bonds it has been recalled that in his
evidence, given some years ago before a Select Committee, the then
Under-Secretary for Ireland stated that in that distressful country
“lotteries are very much used for religious purposes by people of all
denominations,” and that “it would be flying in the face of public
opinion, especially of the great religious bodies, to interfere with
them.”]
Murphy has given up charity for ever. He was perhaps
fuller of this virtue than any other body in Ballybun, and
his house was packed with things he had won at raffles.
When a brick tore a hole in the Orange drum our Presby.
terian pastor at once got up a bazaar for repairs to the
chapel, and Murphy won the finest silver tea-service this
side of the Aran Islands. Murphy knew no distinctions
of race, creed or sex in the holy cause of charity. When
our Methodist minister, who is universally popular, as his
knowledge of a horse would be a credit to any denomina-
tion, got up an Auction Bridge Drive in aid of the Anti-
Gambling League, Murphy came home with three pink
antimacassars, a discourse by JEREMY TAYLOR and two
months' pay out of the pocket of McDougal, the organist,
who seems to play cards by ear. But Nemesis was lying
in ambush for Murphy.
Three old ladies in Trim decided to get up a Tombola
for the poor this winter, and of course they sent Murphy a
sheaf of tickets. As lotteries are illegal they, being pious,
hated them; anyway they decided to call it a Tombola. They
got the whole of Ireland to send them prizes, articles of
vertu and bric-à-brac, and any other old things that are of
printer's bill nearly ruined the charitable ladies, but, as
they said, the Tombola would pay all the expenses, and if
they could knock any more out of it the poor should have it.
If you sold a dozen tickets you could keep the thirteenth
for yourself, and as Murphy, on account of his charity, was
so popular he must have sold hundreds. People seemed to
have an idea that the raffle was for a gondola, and they
thought it would look beautiful on the pond in front of the
Town Hall. Unfortunately our local poetess confirmed this
error by writing a poem about it called “Italy in Ireland,”
which was produced in The Ballybum Binnacle, with a
misprint about the gondolier's “untanned sole,” which
caused a fracas in the editorial office.
Murphy explained to all concerned that perhaps his Italian
was rusty, and anyway his time was so taken up reading
lottery-tickets and other charitable literature that he never
knew what it was all for. It was a Tombola, however, this
time, and not a gondola, they were subscribing for. It was
a kind of Italian lottery which the police didn't mind be-
cause the prizes were not in money or anything of value,
but just Old Masters and brick-bracks. Murphy has such
a way with him that the editor and the poetess each took a
dozen tickets.
When the result of the draw was published Murphy won
six prizes, but no one grudged him them as he had taken so
much trouble. The Grand Prize, a “statue carved by an
Italian artist, the finest bit of sculpture ever seen in Ireland,”
was won by our popular grocer, Mr. McAroon. We were
all delighted. People trooped in crowds to McAroon's back-
door after closing-time to tell him so. The police took
their names, but the magistrates, who have a great respect
for the fine arts, said that this was a day in the artistic
development of the Cinderella of the West which auto-
matically and prima facie regularised an extension of
closing-hours.
McAroon said that his religion did not run much to
statues, but that, to show his tolerance to all denomina-
tions, especially to those on his books, he would have it
unveiled by his Minister. He would invite the Bishop and
all men of goodwill to be present at the ceremony. He
would place it in the corner of his garden overlooking the
esplanade, where it would cheer the simple mariners coming
home after their arduous fishing toils, and perhaps remind
one or two of them (but he would mention no names) of a
dozen or so of porter that had been left unpaid for after a
recent wedding.
The Ballybun express carries no goods whatever, except
with the connivance of the guard and driver, who are both
very decent Ballybun boys, and will bring anything down
from Dublin for anyone. They promised to carry the statue
themselves from the railway station up to McAroon's house.
If the express was less than three hours late, which it was
sure to be if it was running smoothly, they could just beam-
end the statue on its pedestal and the presiding elder could
unveil it with a hammer.
The train was not too late, just punctually late, and the
guard had time to hurry the statue along through the biggest
crowd we have had for years in Ballybun.
The Minister said that he would not open the case with
prayer, because it might give offence to friends of other
Christian denominations; he would just knock the front
off and let this matchless piece of statuary from the blue
skies of Italy dazzle them with its beauty. It needed no
words from him, but he would just like to remind any of his
flock present that the collection next Sunday was for the
heathen both at home and abroad.
The statue then flashed out on us and left us breathless.
It was the most scandalous thing ever seen in Ballybun;
no use to anybody. The carriage on the stuff and the
it was Venus rising from the sea without a stitch. There

she stood with one hand raised toward the sky and the other
pointing at the backs of all the pious people in Ballybun
as they hurried indignantly home. Some of them blamed
McAroon, while others said that Murphy knew all the time
what a Tombola really was and that he ought to be ashamed
of himself.
The Bishop ordered his people not to deal at McAroon's
until Murphy had removed the scandalous object. So many
bitter things were said that McAroon, who is obstinate when
roused, vowed that as long as the sun shone in heaven the
lady should add lustre to his back-yard. The Minister how-
ever tried to move him to a more prayerful spirit.
McAroon said it wouldn't be right to smash up for fire-
wood a marble statue that had cost five hundred pounds if
a penny. The clergyman said that if everybody stopped
away from his store he would lose more than that in a year,
and that in any case, if McAroon suffered, he would suffer
in the holy cause of charity.
McAroon's piety was touched, and he said that in the in-
terests of peace and holy charity he would agree on a com-
promise. He had forsooth to keep his vow and let the lady
stop, but she had two outstretched arms and there was
always abundance of family washing on hand in the day-
time at all events. .The clergy of all denominations agreed
that his decision was in keeping with the best traditions of
a Family Grocer.
Murphy and McAroon made it up publicly. , Murphy
asked how anyone in Ballybun could possibly know the
but “anyway,” said he, “hear you me. I have suffered so
much in mind from this that I have done with charity for
ever.”

“IF I am to be a bold bad smuggler,

“Of course, my swaggering buccaneer,
if you want to do it in the grand
manner,” answered Frederick, “I’ll
arrange for the saucy little cutter, the
sequestered cove an' the hard-riding
exciseman with a cocked hat and cut-
lass. But the simpler if less picturesque
way is to dump your bag on the counter
at the Customs House and be taken
with a fit of sneezing when the Grand
Inquisitor asks you if you have any-
thing to declare.”
“Whereupon he'll hand me a quinine
tablet and, when I show signs of con-
valescence, repeat the question in a
loud voice. And if I don't know the
correct answer I'll find myself meditat-
ing in Portland or Pentonville. That's
what I'm exposing myself to by oblig-

continued Percival bitterly.
“Hang it !” expostulated Frederick,
“the potty little bottle of scent I'm
asking you to deliver to my cousin
Julia won't get you more than a seven-
days' stretch. And you've got fourteen
days' leave.”
“Well, I won't grumble about that,
although I'd arranged my programme
differently. But what about the box
of Flor Fantomas I'm taking for the
Major, and the bottle of whisky with
which the skipper has entrusted me
for the purpose of propitiating his pro-

says is for his aunt. Their combined
weight will just about earn me a lifer.
I can see me wiring the War Office for

thought of you languishing in a felon's
cell, without cigarettes, gives me a pain
in my heart. Let me see what I can
do for you.”
In a few minutes he was back,

THE SMUGGLER.
(With the British Army in France.)
"IF I am to be a bold bad smuggler,

pyjamas and parcels into his bag, “I
demand the proper costume and access-
ories of the craft. No self-respecting
smuggler can be expected to run a cargo
in a British warm and field-boots."
“Of course, myswaggering buccaneer,

meant for vulgar eyes. If I deliver the
parcels with the seals broken I shall
get the glacial glare from the damsels
concerned, and when I get back scor-
pions and poisoned bill-hooks will be
too good for poor Percival.”
“Phew!” whistled Sparkes. “They
go through your baggage with a fine
toothcomb nowadays. Couldn't you
drop over the side with your bag and
drift ashore on a deserted beach, dis-
guised as a floating mine?”
“I’ve cut impersonations of hard-
ware out of my répertoire since the day
I failed to get past an R.T.O. disguised
as a brass-hat,” said Percival sadly.
“I suppose I must fall back on direct
action. I've a feeling that England
expects every man this day to pay his
duty.”
On the quay there was the usual mad
charge of porters. Percival indicated
his bag to one of them with a distracted
air, and followed him to the Customs
House guiltily. The porter dumped
the bag before an official, who had a
piece of chalk hopefully poised between
his fingers.
“’Nything t' 'clare?” he asked, pre-
paring to affix the sign which spelt
freedom.
Percival blew his nose violently,
hoping the chalk would descend to
save him the necessity of answering,
but it remained poised in mid-air.
“Anything to declare?” repeated the
official, with emphasis.
“Er,” said Percival weakly—"nothing
that you need worry about—only a few
presents.”
“I’ll have to trouble you for your
keys, then,” said the incorruptible.
Percival sighed dismally and pro-
duced them. Suddenly he noticed
Gillow declaring his baggage, and be-
came so interested that he failed to
perceive that the official was in diffi-
culties with the lock of his bag.
“This the right key, Sir?” demanded
the latter at length.
“Oh, yes,” said Percival absently.
“But perhaps the bag isn't locked.”
The bag wasn't. It opened easily,
and the official plunged into a welter of
articles of personal use ; but no parcels
or dutiable goods came to light.
“P'raps you think it's a joke,
wasting my time like this,” snorted
the official indignantly “All I can
say is, it's an infernal bad one.”
“Awf'lly sorry,” said Percival
sweetly, as his eye followed Gillow,
who had emerged unchallenged. “I
must have forgotten to bring the
parcels I spoke about.”
Smiling cheerfully, he directed the
porter to place his bag by the side
seat with an expression of complete
content.
“How fares the master criminal 2"
asked Sparkes.
“A sympathetic friend took my
troubles on his shoulders,”
Percival, “and got the parcels through
with an effrontery which amazed me.
I always took him for an upright youth,
too.”
“Who was it?” asked Gillow.
“You ! Didn't you notice you took
my bag by mistake? But don't let
it weigh unduly on your conscience.
Mine 's clear anyway, and I feel that
my troubles are over.”
But it was not till he got home and
opened his own bag that he discovered
a quantity of broken glass, a pungent
odour of whisky and Cologne water, a
discoloured parcel of lace and a box of
sodden cigars.
“I was never meant for a smuggler,”
he groaned.

BILLIARDS.
HERBERT V. JAMEs.
This match of a hundred up was
played in the handsome saloon of the
“Leadswingers' Arms" yesterday after-
noon before an unusually dense crowd,
who both came in just too late to
secure the table. It is understood that
the game was arranged as the result
of a heated discussion during lunch
the same day, in the course of which
Herbert had the effrontery to tell me—I
mean, to tell James—that what I—that
is, he-knew about billiards wouldn't
cover the pyramid-spot. James, who
some hours later thought of a perfectly
priceless repartee, which he has since
forgotten, replied with dignity by chal-
lenging the other to an immediate game.
Herbert accepted and, hastily finish-
ing their lunch, the two repaired to the
nearest billiard-room.
“I’m not due back at the office for
another twenty minutes, so we've tons
” observed Herbert airily as
they entered.
James looked at him, but said no-
thing. He had the better of the open-
ing manoeuvres, however, for he secured
the only cue that possessed a non-flex-
ible tip; Herbert's was at the best of
the semi-rigid type, a fact which im-
pelled him to declare that the place
would soon resemble a popular tea-shop.
Not being pressed for an elucidation of
this remark, he volunteered one. “No
tips," he explained as he tenderly
chalked his.
Herbert won the toss and elected to
break with spot, which appeared to be
a rounder ball than its fellow. Taking
a careful and protracted aim at the red,
he only missed the object-ball by inches,
his own travelling twice round the table
before finally coming to rest in baulk.
“Now then, Inman,” he said, with a
poor attempt at jauntiness, “score off
that if you can.”
James's reply was a calculated safety-
miss, which only failed of its intention
in that it left his ball about an inch
away from the middle pocket. The
closeness of the contest may be gauged
from the fact that at this stage the
game was called (or would have been
called if the marker had not gone out
to his dinner) at one all.
“In off the white,” declared Herbert,
and promptly potted it. “Sorry,” he
added almost before the ball was in the
pocket.

which chilled the atmosphere a trifle,
the exchanges were uneventful. A
slight tendency towards “barracking”
on the part of the crowd was quickly
stifled, however, by a brilliant effort
from James, who by means of all-
round play built up an attractive break
of 5.
Herbert at once responded by taking
off his coat, but for several innings
contributed nothing else of note except
a powerful shot which pocketed the
red ball in the fireplace. After an agree-
ment had at last been reached about
the rule governing this particular class
of stroke, both players settled down to
their work and put in some useful
*| breaks, runs of 3, 7 and 4 by James
being countered by 2, 5, 6 and 3 (twice)
by Herbert. The latter was the first
to reach the 50-mark, an event which
the crowd signalised by hanging up
their hats and advancing to the table.
When they were informed that the
game was one of a hundred up, they
seemed disposed to argue the matter,
and from this stage their attitude to-
wards the players became openly and
impartially critical.
The latter half of the match was
marked by a somewhat peculiar inci-
dent. With the game standing at 75 all
Herbert made a stroke that left the red
hovering on the brink of a pocket. He
waited anxiously, but with no result.
At this point one of the crowd emitted
a prodigious yawn, and it was the in-
tense vibration set up from this act, so
James declared, that induced the ball
to topple over into the pocket. In sup-
should ensue he pointed to a framed
copy of the Rules of Billiards on the
wall that balanced a coloured advertise-
ment of Tommy Dodd whisky, and
recited the rule on vibration. Herbert

strenuously denied that any such
phenomenon had taken place, and when

tine sarcasm that he refrained from
further contesting the point.
against James, and when, the marker
having by now finished his meal, the
score was actually called at 90–99 in
his opponent's favour, he might have
been excused for giving up the game
as lost. With dogged determination,
however, he faced the situation. His
own ball was somewhere near the
centre, the red about eighteen inches
from the top left-hand pocket, and the
white midway between the right-hand
cushion and the D. With an almost
superhuman stroke (but not, as was
subsequently averred, with his eyes
shut) he smote the red, and his ball
travelled rapidly up and down the
table. On the down journey it glanced
off the white, after which, still going
at a tremendous pace, it made a com-
plete tour of the table and concluded
its meteoric career in the bottom right-
hand pocket. Meanwhile the red and
the white had both departed on voy-
ages of their own, the terminus in each
case being the self-same pocket. (See
diagram.) After the balls had been
taken out, examined and counted, and
James's person had been searched to
see if he were concealing any, the
marker pronounced this to be a 10-shot,
and the game was thus strikingly ended
in James's favour.

I said so once to Margery she remarked

I came down to breakfast at my

I opened it under the usual fire of in-

I ignored them, however, and my
young heart gave a small jump. I am

“But, Alan darling, how beautiful!

and now at last it has happened. I do
hope it isn't a mistake,” said Cecilia
anxiously. She was trying to be nice,
you know. I'm sure she was. I went
on with my breakfast.
“Well, John,” said Cecilia, “can't
you congratulate him, or are you too
jealous?”
John sighed deeply and pondered.
“Terrible how Punch has gone down
since our young days, isn't it?” he said
heavily.

I spent a miserable time until it
appeared. Somehow or other Cecilia
let the great glad news get about the
village. Farley, our newsagent and
tobacconist, held me when I went in
for an ounce of the usual mild.
“So I'ear you've 'ad a article printed

think laughable it'd be, I suppose like,

“Not half,” I said, striving hard to
impersonate a successful humourist.
“Ah, well, it's all good for business,”
he said, as one who sees the silver
orders for the paper for the next two
or three weeks.”
I crept from the shop, only to meet
an atrocious woman from “The Gables,”
who stopped me with a little shriek of

“Oh, Mr. Jarvis, I've been dying to
meet you, do you know. I always have
thought you so funny, ever since that

last summer. I said to my husband
when I heard of your success, ‘I’m not

whether it was too late to stop publica-
tion of the horrible thing.

Margery giggled.
“Cecilia,” I said, rising, “if you
don't control this reptile that you have
married, if you don't force him to hold
his peace, if you allow him to read one
word, I'll throw the bread-knife at him
and . . . and pour my coffee all over
the tablecloth.”
“John,” said Cecilia, “ have a little
thought for others and read it quietly
to yourself.”
Cecilia meant well, of course, but
Margery giggled again.
John read it to himself in a dead
silence, sighed heavily and passed it to
Margery. -
“We shall never live it down,” he
said, putting his head into his hands
and gazing moodily at the marmalade.
Margery read it and giggled three or
four times; but Margery giggles at
anything. -
Cecilia read it and beamed.
“Alan, dear,” she said, “it’s lovely!
Of course they accepted it. John, you
wretch, say you liked it.” (Cecilia can
be a dear.)
“Well, if I must tell the truth,” said
John, “it isn't quite so bad as I ex-
pected. In fact I very much doubt
whether he wrote it at all. If he did

all.”
I smiled.
“You may smile, swelled-head,” said
John; “but I'll bet you five golden
guineas to a bad tanner you couldn't
do it again.”
“Done,” I said.
. After a few days, however, I realised
that I had made a mistake. Even a
bad sixpence is worth something now-
adays.
Cecilia and Margery vied with each
other in offering me the feeblest sug-
gestions for articles that they felt sure
would reduce a rhinoceros to hysterics.
John presented me with a copy of
A Thousand and One Jokes and Anec-
dotes “to prove he was a sportsman,”
he said. I started to look for a bad
sixpence.
Then Margery said to me:–
“Why don't you write and explain
the whole thing to the Editor and offer
to go halves if he prints it?”
I looked at her in amazement.
“You horrible little cheat l” I said.

However, on thinking it over care-
fully there seems a lot to say for the idea
and it's really quite fair. Anyhow I
can't possibly let John win. So here's
the story, and with any luck it will cost
John five golden guineas. But I shan't
give the Editor half.
The Perils of Humour.
From Punch :—

From The Manchester Evening Chron-
icle :- -
“‘THE PROFITEER'S ANTHEM.

“It was reported to the Sanitary Committee
yesterday that the Inspector of Nuisances had
made arrangements for the repair of the
meteorological instruments.”—Local Paper.
Judging by our"recent weather, quite
the right man to look after it.
From a money-lender's circular:—
“Having been, perhaps, the richest nation
in the world before the war, and wealth being
only comparative, it is our empirical duty to
achieve a like position again.”
So that's why they are “trying it on.”
“The news, says the Paris correspondent of
The Times, in itself is serious enough as show-
ing the dangers of letting the Adriatic settle-
ment continue to be at the mercy of a coup de
theatre or coup de d'etat, whichever one may
like to call it.”—Evening Paper.
We fancy the Paris correspondent of
The Times would prefer the former.

THE BURIAL OF DUNDEE.
“Dundee is dead,” said my wife, re-
turning from her morning visit to the
kitchen.
“I am very sorry to hear it,” I re-
plied, laying down the newspaper on
the breakfast-table, at which I still lin-
gered; and indeed I was sorry. Dundee
had been our household cat from the
earliest days of our married life, from
the time when he was a tiny kitten the
colour of marmalade, which had earned
him his name.
“Cook is very much upset,” my wife
continued.
“Her distress does her credit,” I
answered.
“She talks of leaving.”
I must confess with shame that a
pang acuter than the first went through
me at the news, for Cook was one of
those rare artists who understands the
value of surprise and never rides suc-
cess to death.
“Ask her to reconsider her decision,”
I said.
“I have,” said my wife, “and she
remained immovable.”

I knew indeed. The rate of mortality
among her friends and relations was
abnormally high, and on account, as I
suspect, of her skill in cookery she was
in frequent demand as a mourner. By
continual attendance she had cultivated
a nice sense of what was fitting on these
occasions and posed as an authority on
the subject.
“Very well, then, let's have him

Cook, if I asked them.”
“Who else can we get 2 " I asked.
“Yourself,” my wife made answer.
“Me? But I can't be seen by all

explain that our only garden is in front
of the house.
“If you wait till it is dark you
needn't be afraid of anyone seeing
you,” protested my wife.
“And run the risk of being detected
by some suspicious policeman. No,

“Then if you won't do it yourself
you must find someone who will. It
is our last hope of persuading Cook to

courage to face.
The problem remained unsolved when
I stepped out of the train on my return
from the City. To gain time for reflec-
tion I resolved to make a détour. As
I struck into an unfamiliar side street,
I looked up, and there in front of me
stood an undertaker's shop.
The inspiration I entered. From
the back premises advanced to meet me
the undertaker, with a visage tentatively
wobegone, not yet knowing whether
I was widower, orphan, businesslike
executor or merely the busybody family
friend. I unfolded my difficulty. Be-
neath the outer crust of professional
.#. there evidently seethed
within the undertaker a lava of joviality.
“Certainly, Sir, certainly,” he said.
but one of my assistants will be delighted
to earn an extra shilling or so by oblig-
ing you. What name and address” ”
I joyfully gave both and made my
way home.
Midway through dinner came a ring
at the front-door bell. Palmer inter-
rupted her service to answer, and
returned to me with a card on a salver.
“A gentleman to see you, Sir,” she
announced.
“How strange, at this hour !
can it be?” asked my wife.
“The gentleman to bury Dundee,”
I explained in a lowered voice, as I
passed the visiting-card, deeply edged
with black, across the table to her.
Next morning my wife was able to
announce that Cook had consented to
stay. The burial of Dundee by a real
undertaker had gratified her sense of
the correct. I departed to the City
filled with self-complacency.
For a month I dwelt in this fool's
paradise. Then one evening my wife
gently broke the news.
“I have something serious to tell
you. Cook has given notice.”
“Who is dead now 2 " I asked.
She is engaged to be
Who
“No one.
married.”
“Yes, to the young undertaker.”
“What young undertaker?”
“The one who buried Dundee.”
It was too true. At supper, after
the inhumation, a mutual esteem had
sprung up that rapidly ripened into
love. The enterprising young journey-
man, so enamoured of his calling that
he consented to inter dumb creatures
in his leisure time, had evidently dis-
cerned in Cook, with her wealth of
funeral lore, a helpmeet worthy of him-
self; while Cook on her side, conquered
by his diligence and discretion, con-
sidered she had secured a respectable
settlement for life, with the prospect of
obsequies of the highest class for herself.

Is this: That every parson, before

back to me as if it only happened yes-

with a telephone loose about the place
one ought not to encourage other pets.
“Well,” I said to Sibyl, “there we
are, and we must make the best of

Sibyl sniffed as she usually does
when these periodical occurences hap-
pen in our house.
“Which of them are you going to
keep?” she asked, “and is it really
necessary to keep any of them 2 "
“Well,” I said ; “but—”
“What I mean to say,” said Sibyl,
“better do away with them when they
are quite young. It would be far more
humane.”
“I am with you up to a point," I
said; “I admit they are not a very
prepossessing lot.”
“How they came to be born at all
is what I cannot understand,” said
Sibyl, who is always like that when
trying to be serious.

Whether I should ever rear No. 1 was
a matter for time to prove. It was so
delicate that once or twice already it

I had rallied it each time.

HER parents were hygienic, so they never let a germ
intrude
Within the cells and tissues of the girl they christened
Ermyntrude;
They bathed her body every hour and all internal harm
allayed
By pouring Condy's Fluid on her butter and her marmalade;
And when they dressed her took good care to tuck her
chest-protector in—
Result, she grew up strong and fair as any peach or nectarine.
II.
She had no fear of lion or of tiger (in imprisonment)
And in an awful storm at sea she asked the mate what
mizzen meant :
It was a plucky act; if I’d neglected to report it you'd
Never have known the depth and true dimensions of her
fortitude.
If you remain agnostic, if you hold it still not proven, I'll
Give fifty more examples of her courage when a juvenile;
They lie in my portfolio, all printed, filed and docketed,
Including one in which a stick of dynamite she pocketed.
III.
She also painted: one could tell her pictures mid a billion,
So daubed were they with ochre blots and splashes of
vermilion;
She claimed to be a connoisseur of objets d'art and curios,
But what attracted notice was her openwork and lury hose,
Fashioned in every colour from magenta down to cinnabar,
Suggestive of a rainbow or the various liquors in a bar.
IV.
So when she came to twenty - one, the age they call
discretional,
The trooping of her followers was, in a word, processional.
V
But she disdained flamboyant types and snubbed the gay
and gildy brand;
Instead she loved a decadent whose pagan name was
Hildebrand,
Until that sad occasion when she met him coming back o'
night,
His system loaded up with bhang and opium and aconite.
VI.
An artist next attracted her; she turned on her cajoleries,
And soon in unison they laughed at other people's drolleries;
His speech was polychromous (as the speech of many a
carman is);
He mostly talked of masses, lights, half-tones and colour-
harmonies;
That was his doom, for one fine day he went to his sarco-
phagus,
The word “chiaroscuro” stuck deep down in his osophagus.
VII.
I do not know; it may have been her hose that took poor
Rendall in,
Who previously had flirted with her elder sister, Gwendoline.
This Rendall was a wholesale dealer, very rich and large
in all
His habits, though he always said his profits were but
Well, Rendall kept on waddling round her, like a tired and
tardy yak;
His movements showed beyond a doubt that his disease
was cardiac;
He took her on the river; after thinking for a time, aloud
He said, “I will propose to you; that is, of course, if I'm
allowed.”
VIII.
And she replied, “If I were going to propose, I'm blest if I
Would personate an elder who is just about to testify.
Now first of all I must remark that Love has come to grip
you late
In life, but, passing over that, I've certain things to stipulate:
You must exhibit interest, as even Goth or Vandal would,
In curios and bric-à-brac, in ivories and sandalwood ;
And you must cope with cameo, veneer, relief and lacquer
(Ah
And, parenthetically, pay my debts at bridge and baccarat).
I dote on Futurism, and so a mate would give me little ease
Whose views were strictly orthodox on MYRON and
PRAXITELEs.
You do not understand,” she sneered, “so gross is your
fatuity; -
Well then, I answer ‘No,' without a trace of ambiguity.”
- IX.
And Rendall turned back sad at heart; but in a stride his
honey-bee
Was in his arms exclaiming, “Then would wasted all your
money be.
Come, I will take you with your faults and try to make
the best of you;
Your purse is good; perhaps in time I may improve the
rest of you.”

SHAKSPEARE THE TRADUCER.
THE members of the League of
Scottish Veterans of the World War
met recently in New York, and after
“due deliberation” (Query, Can Scotch-
men deliberate “duly " in New York
now 2) passed a resolution demanding
that SHAKSPEARE's tragedy, Macbeth,
be removed from the curriculum of
English literature studies in American
schools.
Apparently this was an example of
“dry” Scotch humour. A neighbouring
city had previously banned The Mer-
chant of Venice from its schools on the
ground that the character of Shylock was
a libel on the Jewish race. If Jewish
children no longer had to pay for school
have been emended in the light of
modern research by a committee of psy-
chical experts appointed for the pur-
pose. The proposer quoted the line
spoken by Hamlet to the apparition:—
“Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,”
and said he would like to substitute for
it, “Be thou a subjective hallucination
arising from an uprush of inhibited
emotional disturbance from the sub-
liminal consciousness, or the objectivi-
sation of a telepathic communication
from the extra-corporeal sphere of
being, or, finally, a manifestation to sen-
sory perception of some supra-normal
undulatory movement of the ether.”
He had always deprecated, he said,
the meddling of untrained amateurs
MODERN MOON-RAKERS.
PoRTA, the once notorious Michigander,
Who launched the now exploded solar
slander,
Whereat ten thousand negroes stood
aghast,
In one short month into oblivion
passed,
But PICKERING's momentous lunar
screed
Proves the persistence of this wondrous
breed. -
Yet this in PickFRING's favour let us
state:

Nothing in any way that may impugn
The credit or the morals of the moon ;
And on the other hand it does attract us
editions of The Merchant of
Venice should Scottish in-
fants still have to squander
their bawbees on a play
that insulted their for-
bears? Perish the thought!
“We consider,” they de-
clared, “that if a Jewish
gabardine is to be cleaned
by American Boards of
Education the stain should
likewise be removed from
the Scottish kilt.” And
if there are no reliable
cleaners in the U.S.A. it
should be sent to Perth.
The example thus nobly
set is being widely fol-
lowed. The members of
the Southern Jazz-band
Union met yesterday way
down in Tennessee and

manding the elimination

tional curriculum. The

foolishness and an insult to the most

A SLIGHT ACCIDENT SECURES HIM A PERSONAL INTRODUCTION TO THE MASTER.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
From Friend to Friend (MURRAY) is the name given,
from the first of them, to a collection of eight fugitive papers,
prepared for republication by the late Lady RITCHIE during
the last months of her life, and now edited by her sister-in-
law, Miss EMILY RITCHIE. Fugitive though they may have
been in original intent, these pages are so filled with their
writer's delicate and very personal charm that her lovers
will be delighted to have their flight thus pleasantly arrested.
Lady RITCHIE was above all else the perfect appreciator.
Horas non numerat misi Seremas; the gaze that she turns
smilingly upon old happy far-off days looks through spec-
tacles rose-tinted both by the magic of retrospect and her
own genius for admiration. London, Freshwater, Paris,
Rome—these are the settings of her memories; and we see
them all by a light that (perhaps) never was on land or sea,
in whose radiance beauty and wit and genius move won-
derfully to a perpetual music. In truth, however, these
eminent Victorians of Lady RITCHIE's circle must have been
a rare company; I have no space for even a catalogue
of them—Mrs. CAMERON, with her vague magnificence,
pouring letters and an embarrassment of gifts upon her dear
TENNYsons; the KEMBLE sisters, LOCKHART, THACKERAY
himself, a score of great and (to the kindly chronicler)
gracious personalities live again in her pages. I should add
that the volume is rounded off by a short story, a late
addition to the Miss Williamson series, which might be
called a pot-boiler, were it not somehow incongruous to
Slight as it is, From Friend to Friend forms an apt and
graceful finish to the work of one whose life was given to
the claims of friendship.
Fanny goes to War (MURRAY) should be read by those
who also went and those who didn't. It is a chronicle of
the adventures of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in
Belgium and France—vivid; inviting wonder, laughter and
sometimes tears; fresh and delicious. The account of the
first visit to the trenches awakens memories. Viewed from
this distance it seems all to have been so picturesque, such
fun! The humour of Thomas, the intelligence and tact of
the good French poilu, the awful moments and the wild
jests in between—these are all shown. The splendid
humour with which “PAT BEAUCHAMP,” the author, bravely
endured her own casualty with its distressing effects is
typical in itself of that spirit in the Anglo-Saxon race which
made the Teuton race wish it hadn't. In my view, the
obiter dictum of an anonymous Colonel sums up the values
of this ladies' contingent better than does the preface of
the distinguished Major-General: “Neither fish, flesh nor
fowl,” said the Colonel on having the constitution of this
anomalous unit explained to him, “but thundering good
red herring !” Time was, I believe and hope, when I
myself, passing through the Base Port on leave and being
full of life and daring, have sighted a lady-chauffeur of a
motor-ambulance and have thrown a friendly glance, even
a froward smile, at her. Waiving all questions of propriety,
I hope that this was so, and that the lady-chauffeur was no

It certainly does not seem eight years, yet it must be
fully that, since Joseph CoNRAD in The English Review
lifted a veil that lay between his admirers and an interesting
personality with the pleasantly discursive papers which
form the basis of the re-issued A Personal Record (DENT).
Between then and now Chance, that masterly but difficult
book, has by a curious freak of public taste given Mr.
CoNRAD, hitherto the well-loved favourite of the relatively
few, a much wider constituency. To these late comers,
rather than to the older (and of course superior) Conradists,
think that she could appreciate a joke made at her own
expense; witness her Tºº from the gushing friend
who, at the moment of the first triumph of The Persian

tion with Punch, not least the
fact that her father-in-law, Deputy J. T. BEDFord, was the
author of that Robert, the City Waiter, who was among the
most famous and popular of Mr. Punch's early creations.
The volume that the writer has put together is the record
of a busy, successful and, on the whole, happy life, passed
in the company of interesting people, about many of whom
Madame LEHMANN has remembered some entertaining
story. Chiefly, as is natural, the persons recorded are the
musical folk of the last half-century, from JENNY LIND to
Sir THoMAS BEECHAM; though in the allied Arts I was
taken by a pleasing and new anecdote of Robert BRowN-
ING reciting How they Brought the Good News into an
Edison phonograph, and overcome by loss of memory half-
way through the ordeal. One wonders if this rather sur-
prising record exists to-day. I am not going to assert that
the non-technical reader may not find the pages devoted
to reprinted criticism rather over-numerous; old news-
paper files, like old theatrical photographs, too quickly
fade. But the author's humour endured; and I}. to
has got together quite a lot
of people and situations that other novelists have used be-
fore. There is the fine young Irishman soldiering in India,
the soulless actress who marries and leaves him, and the
splendid Irish girl, his true mate, whom he weds in happy
ignorance of his first partner's continued existence. But the
hero has a maiden aunt, with a story of her own, and the
heroine a terrific grandmother who are Miss MACNAMARA's
creations, and as she makes wife number one lie like a
trooper in order to preserve the happiness of wife number
two a soupçon of freshness is imparted to the réchauffé.
Of course the well-meaning first wife is not allowed to
succeed in her efforts, and Beau and Perry (you would never
guess from that which was which, but in this case it doesn't
matter) have a very bad time indeed until, reassured by
a friendly barrister, they settle down again into wedded
happiness. These are the confiding souls whom novelists
and lawyers love, and I can see Miss MACNAMARA, by-and-
by, getting quite a nice story out of someone's attempt to
oust their eldest son from his inheritance. I hope she will.

THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF TRADE.
[The revival, in certain quarters, of commercial relations with
Germany has already begun to blunt theºmemory of the War. And
now the proposal to open up trade with the Co-operative Societies in
Russia, to the obvious benefit of the Bolshevists, who practically control
the whole country, looks like an attempt to bring about indirectly a
peace which we cannot in decency negotiate through the ordinary
channels of diplomacy.]
THEY are coming, the carpet - baggers, their voices are
heard in the land,
Guttural Teuton organs, but very polite and bland;
And our arms are stretched for their welcome ; we've
buried the past like a dud;
For blood may be thicker than water, but Trade is
thicker than blood.
The Winter of war is over, and lo! with the dawn of
Spring
They come, and we greet them coming, like swallows
that homeward swing,
Fair as the violet's waking, swiſt as the snows in flood,
For blood may be thicker than water, but Trade is
thicker than blood.
Likewise with Soviet Russia—we've done with the need
to fight;
There are gentler methods (and cheaper) of putting the
whole thing right;
The palms of the dealers are plying the soap's invisible sud,
For blood may be thicker than water, but Trade is
thicker than blood.
Of Peace there can be no parley with LENIN's régime,
as such,
But º can easily tackle what Honour declines to
touch,
Making the sewage to blossom, sampling the septic mud,
For blood may be thicker than water, but Trade is
thicker than blood.
Thus may our merchant princes modestly play their part,
Speeding the silent process of soldering heart to heart,
Just as the forces of Nature silently swell the bud,
For blood may be thicker than water, but Trade is
thicker than blood.
So i. the hands of the Bolshie our hands shall at last be
aid;
Deep unto deep is calling to lift the long blockade;
“No truck,” we had sworn, “with murder; ” but God
will forget that oath,
For blood is thicker than water, but Trade is thicker
than both. O. S.
WITH THE AUXILIARY PATROL.
AN HONOURABLE RECoRD.
MANY years ago, in the reign of good QUEEN VICTORIA, a
little ship, sailed out of Grimsby Docks in all the proud
bravery of new paint and snow-white decks, and passed
the Newsand bound, for the Dogger Bank. They had
christened her the King George, and, though her feminine
susceptibilities were perhaps a trifle piqued at this affront
to her sex, it was a right royal name, and her brand-new
boilers swelled with loyal fervour. She was a steam
trawler—at that time one of the smartest steam trawlers
afloat, and she knew it; she held her headlights very high
indeed, you may be sure.
Time passed, and the winds and waters of the North Sea
dealt all too rudely with the fair freshness of her exterior;
she grew worn and weather-stained, and it was apparent
girlhood behind her out on the Nor'-East Rough. Some of
the younger trawlers would jeeringly refer to her behind
her back as “Auntie,” and affected to regard her as an
antediluvian - old dowager, which of course was mainly
due to jealousy. But she still pegged away at her work,
bringing in from the Dogger week by week her cargoes of
fish, regardless alike of the ravages of time and the jibes
of her upstart rivals. As long as her owners were satisfied
she was happy, for she cherished first and last a sense of
duty, as all good ships do.
And then suddenly came the War, infesting the seas with
unaccustomed and nerve-racking dangers. I must apologise
for mentioning this, as everybody knows that we ought now
to forget about the War as quickly as possible and get on
with more important matters, but at the time it had a cer-
tain effect upon us all, not excluding the King George.
Scorning the menaces that lurked about her path she carried
on the pursuit of the cod and haddock in her old undemon-
strative fashion, for she was a British ship from stem to
stern and conscious of the tradition behind her.
Then one day they hauled her up in dock, gave her a six-
pounder astern, fitted her with wireless and sent her out to
take care of her unarmed sisters on the fishing-grounds.
She flew the White Ensign.
These were the proudest days of her life: she was help-
ing to keep the seas. It is true the big ships of the Fleet
might laugh at her in a good-natured way and pass uncom-
plimentary remarks about her personal appearance, but
they had to acknowledge her seamanship and her pluck.
She could buffet her way through weather that no destroyer
dare face, and mines had no terrors for her, for even if she
were to bump a tin-fish it only meant one old trawler the
less, and the Navy could afford it.
It was during these days, too, that she became known,
though not by name, to readers of Punch, for her adven-
tures and those of her crew were often chronicled in his
tales of the “Auxiliary Patrol.” And when she had seen
the War through she said Good-bye to his pages and made
ready to return again to the ways of peace. She was quite
satisfied; she never thought of giving up her job, though
she was now a very old ship, and it would have been no
shame to her. She just took a fresh coat of paint and
steamed away to the Dogger Bank once more.
:k :; ::: :k :k :k :::
The other day a small paragraph appeared in some of the
newspapers that were not too busy discussing the possibili-
ties of another railway strike: “The Grimsby trawler
King George,” it said, “is reported long over-due from the
fishing-grounds, and the owners say that there is no hope of
her return.” No one would notice this, because the first
round of the English Cup was to be played that week, and
besides it was not as though it were a battleship or a big
liner that had gone down. It was just the old King George.
And that, I suppose, is the end of her, except that she
may continue to be remembered by one or two who served
aboard her in the days of the Auxiliary Patrol—remembered
as a gallant little ship that served her country in its hour
of need, and did not hold that hour the limit of her service.
Well played, King George 1

A LIMPET OF WAR.
(With the British Army in France.)
THE day on which that fine old
crusted warrior, Major Slingswivel,
quits the hospitable confines of Nulle-
part Camp will be the signal that the
British Army in France has completed
its work, even to the labelling and
despatching of the last bundle of as-
sorted howitzers. A British army in
France without Major Slingswivel
would be unthinkable. It is confi-
dently asserted that Nullepart Camp
was built round him when he landed
in '14, and that he has only emerged
from it on annual visits to his tailor for
the purpose of affixing an additional
chevron and having another inch let
into his tunic. Latest reports state
that he is still going strong, and in-
denting for ice-cream freezers in anti-
cipation of a hot summer.
But for an unforgivable error of tact
I might have stood by the old bronto-
saurus to the bitter end. One evening
he and I were listening to a concert
given by the “Fluffy Furbelows” in
the camp Nissen Coliseum, and a Miss
ardent desire to get back to Alabama
and dear ole Mammy and Dad, not to
speak of the rooster and the lil melon-
patch way down by the swamp. The
prospect as painted by her was so
alluring that by the end of the first
verse all the troops were infected with
trans-Atlantic yearnings and voiced
them in a manner that would have
made an emigration agent rub his hands
and start chartering transport right
away. She had an enticing twinkle
which lighted on the Major a few times,
so that I wasn't surprised when the
second chorus found him roaring out
that he too was going to take a long
lease of a shack down Alabama way.
“Gad—she’s immense ! We must
invite her to tea to-morrow,” he said
to me in a whisper that shook the
Nissen hut to its foundations. Sling-
swivel was no vocal lightweight. Those
people in Thanet and Kent who used
to write to the papers saying they
could hear the guns in the Vimy Ridge
and Messines offensives were wrong.
What they really heard was Major
Slingswivel at Nullepart expostulating
with his partner for declaring clubs
“Very well,” I answered sulkily. It
wasn't the first time the Major had
been captivated by ladies with Southern
syncopated tastes, and I knew I should
be expected to complete the party with
the other lady member of the troupe,
Miss Dulcie Demiton, and listen to the
old boy making very small talk in a
very large voice. I could see myself
balancing a teacup and trying to get
in a word here and there through the
barrage.
Still, there was no getting out of it,
and next afternoon found our quartette
nibbling petits gateaux in the only
pátisserie in the village. The Major
was in fine fettle as the war-worn old
veteran, and Gwennie and Dulcie
spurred him on with open and undis-
guised admiration.
“Now I'm in France,” gushed
Gwennie, “I want to see everything—
where the trenches were and where
you fought your terrible battles.”
“Delighted to show you,” said Sling-
swivel, bursting with pride at being
taken for a combatant officer. “How
about to-morrow 2 ”
“Just lovely,” cooed Gwennie.

Gwennie Gwillis was expressing an

evening, but we shan't be starting
before lunch.”
“That gives us all morning,” said
the Major enthusiastically. “Miss
Gwennie, Miss Dulcie, Spenlow, we
will parade to-morrow at 9.30.”
I couldn't understand it. Naturally
Gwennie, with her mind constantly set
on Alabama, couldn't be expected to be
up in war geography, but the Major
knew jolly well that all the battles
within reasonable distance of Nullepart
had been fought out with chits and
indents. I put it to him that it wasn't
likely country for war thrills.
“Leave it to me,” he said confidently.
So I left it, and when we paraded
next morning where do you"think the
wily old bird led us? Why, to the old
training ground on the edge of the
camp, where the R.E.'s used to lay
out beautifully revetted geometrical
trenches as models of what we were
supposed to imitate in the front line
between hates. Having been neglected
since the Armistice they had caved in
a bit and sagged round the corners till
they were a very passable imitation of
the crump-battered thing. -
Old Slingswivel so arranged the
itinerary that the girls didn't perceive
that the sector was bounded on one
side by Père Popeau's turnip field and
on the other by a duck-pond, and he
showed a tactical knowledge of the
value of cover in getting us into a
trench out of view of certain stakes
and pickets that were obviously used
by Mère Popeau as a drying-ground.
To divert attention he gave a vivid
demonstration of bombing along a
C.T. with clods of earth, with myself as
bayonet-man nipping round traverses
and mortally puncturing sand - bags
with a walking-stick. It must have
been a pretty nervy business for the
Major, for any minute we might have
come across a notice-board about the
hours of working parties knocking off
for dinner that would have given the
whole show away. But he displayed
fine qualities of leadership and presence
of mind at critical moments, notably
when Gwennie showed a disposition to
explore a particular dug-out.”
“I shouldn't advise you to go in
there, Miss Gwennie,” he said gravely.
“Why?” asked Gwennie apprehen-
sively.
“Not a pleasant sight for a lady,”
said the Major gruffly. “It upset me
one day when I looked in.”
This was probable enough, for the
Mess steward used it as a store for
empty bottles.
Gwennie shuddered and passed on.
The Major mopped his forehead with
relief and set the ladies souveniring

Taking it all round, it was a success-

the producer, and it was only spoiled
when, so to speak, the curtain rolled
down amidst thunders of applause.
“We don't realize what we owe to

admiringly.

THE TRAGEDY OF AN AUTHOR'S WIFE.
“I won't stand it any longer,” said
Janet intensely, meeting me in the
hall. “Take off your umbrella and
listen to me.”
“It's off,” I replied faintly, perceiv-
ing that something was all my fault.
“Can't you hear it singing ‘Niagara'
in the porch 2"
I dropped the shopping on the floor
and sat down to watch Janet walking
up and down the room.
“I want,” she continued in the tone
of one who has had nobody to be in-
dignant with all day, “a divorce.”
“Who for 2 " I inquired. “Really,
darling, we can't afford any more pres-
ents this * -
“Me,” she interrupted, frowning.
“Couldn't you have it for your birth-
day?” I suggested. “I may have
some more money by then. Besides, I
gave you in
“No, I could not,” replied Janet in
a voice like the end of the world; “I
want it now. I will not wear myself
out trying to live up to an impossible
ideal, and lose all my friends because
they can't help comparing me with it.
And it isn't even as if it were my own
ideal. I never know what I've got to
be like from one week to another. And
what do I get for my struggles?
Not even recognition, much less grati-
tude.”
“Janet,” I said kindly, “I don't
know what you're talking about. Who
are these people who keep idealising
you? I will not have you annoyed in
this way. Send them to me and I'll
put a little solid realism into their
heads. I'll tell them what you really
are, and that 'll settle their unfortunate
illusions. Dear old girl, don't worry
so . . . I'll soon put it right.”
Janet looked at me piercingly.
“It's this,” she said; “I keep having
people to call on me.”
“I know,” I answered, shuddering;
“but I can't help it, can I? You
shouldn't be so attractive.”
“Dear Willyum,” she replied, “that's
just the point; you can help it.”
“Stop calling me names and I'll see
what can be done.”
“But it's part of my 'whimsical wit’
to call you Willyum,” she said grimly.
“I understand that I am like that.
People realise this when they read
your articles, and immediately call to
see if I'm true. I've read through
nearly all your stories to-day, in be-
tween the visitors, and—and—”
I gripped her hand in silence.
“I'm losing all my friends,” she
mourned, touched by my sympathy,
“even those who used to like me long
to themselves, ‘Fancy poor old Janet
being like that all the time, and we
never knew l' and they rush down to
see me again. They sit hopefully round
me as long as they can bear it; then,
after the breakdown, they go away
indignant and never think kindly of me
again.”
She gloomed.
“And all the cousins and nice young
men who used to think I was quite jolly
have suddenly noticed how much jollier
I might be if only I could say the things
they say you say I say . . .”
“Hush, hush,” I whispered; “have
an aspirin.” -
“But it's quite true,” she cried hope-
lessly. “And She's just what I ought
to be. She says everything just in the
right place. When I compare myself
with Her, I know I’m not a bit the
kind of person you admire, and—and
it's no good pretending any longer.
I'm not jealous, only—sort of mis-
rubble.”
She rose with a pale smile and,
hushing my protestations, arrived at
her conclusion. -
“We must part,” she said, throwing
her cigarette into the fire and walk-
ing to the window; “I can't help it. I
suppose I'm not good enough for you.
You must be free to marry Her when we
find Her. I too,” she sighed, “must be
free. . . .” -
“I now call upon myself to speak,”
I remarked, rising hurriedly. “Janet,”
I continued, arriving at her side, “keep
perfectly still and do not attempt to
breathe, because you will not be able
to, and look as pleasant as you can
while I tell you truthfully what I think
you are really like.”
(I have been compelled to delete this
passage on the ground that even if
people believed me it would only attract
more callers.)
“All right,” she continued, unruffling
her hair; “but if I do you must promise
to leave off writing stories about me.
Will you?”
“But, darling,” I objected, “consider
the bread-and-jam.” -
She was silent.
“Well, then,” she said at last, “you
must only write careful ones that I can
live up to.”
“I’ll try,” I agreed remorsefully;
“I’ll go and do one now—all about
this. And you can censor it.” I left
the room jauntily.
Janet's voice, suddenly repentant,
followed me.
“No,” she called, “that won't do
either. Because if it's a true one you
won't sell it.”
“But if it isn't,” I called back, “and
I do, we can put the money in the

And bought tiaras and were cheered
By hopes of breeding Epsom winners;
Eh, lad, you little knew the weird
Dreed by the Yorkshire spinners.
How hollow are those marble halls,
The place I built and deemed a show-

Its terraces, its waterfalls
Once Ihore I hear that sound of
loathing, -
The bell rings and a stranger call
To speak of underclothing.
They've bashed my offices to wrecks,
They've broke their way beyond the
warders, -
And now my country seat they vex,
They trample my herbaceous borders;
They chase me up and down with
cheques,
They flummox me with orders.
They bolt me to the billiard-room,
Where chaps are playing five-bob

They see me dodging from the doom,
They heed no threats and no rebuker;

To haunts that once I used to enter,

feet.
“What's this?” said she, stirring

Aunt Angela was of a
different opinion. “Oh,

house up with accumulated
rubbish. If you don't sur-
render most of it for Etta's

the pride of the muck-
room.
“The Limit,” I should
tell you, is (or was) a
waterproof. It is a faith-
ful record of Edward's
artistic activities during
the last thirty years, being
decorated all down the
front with smears of red,
white and green paint.
Here and there it has been
repaired with puncture
patches and strips of sur-
gical plaster, but more
often it has not. As Edward
S. is incapable of replacing
a button and Aunt Angela
refuses to touch the
“Limit,” he knots himself
into it with odds and ends
of string and has to be lib-
erated by his ally, the cook,
with a kitchen knife. Ed-
ward calls it his “garden
coat,” and swears he only
wears it on dirty jobs, to
save his new mackintosh,
but nevertheless he is sin-
Angela something or she'll tidy us,” he
groaned.
“These orderly people are a curse,”
I protested. “They have no considera-
tion for others. Look at me; I am
naturally disorderly, but I don't run
round and untidy people's houses for
them.”
Edward nodded. “I know; I know
it's all wrong, of course; we should
make a stand. Still, if we can buy
Angela off, I think . . . you under-
stand 2 . . .” And he ambled off to
his muck-room.
If anybody in this neighbourhood has
anything that is both an eyesore and
an encumbrance they bestow it on
Edward for his muck-room, where he
stores it against an impossible contin-
gency. I trotted upstairs to my bed-
room and routed about among my

“An emergency sock of my own inven-
tion. It has three exits, you will ob-
serve, very handy in case of fire.”
“Hump! ” said Aunt Angela.
Edward returned bearing his offer-
ings, a gent's rimless boater, a door-
knob, six inches of lead-piping and
half a bottle of cod-liver oil.
“Hump!” said Aunt Angela.
No more was said of it that night.
Aunt Angela resumed her sewing,
Edward his Gertie, I my slumb-,
my meditations. Nor indeed was the
jumble sale again mentioned, a fact
which in itself should have aroused
my suspicions; but I am like that, inno-
cent as a sucking-dove. I had put the
matter out of my mind altogether until
yesterday evening, when, hearing the
sound of laboured breathing and the
cerely attached to the rag, and once
attempted to travel to London to a
Royal Society beano in it, and was only
frustrated in the nick of time.
So the oft-threatened “Limit” had
been reached at last. I laughed heartily
for a moment, then a sudden cold dread
gripped me, and I raced upstairs and
tore open my wardrobe. Gregory, the
glory of Gopherville, had gone too!
A word as to Gregory. If you look
at a map of Montana and follow a line

ago. Nine years ago, however, Gregory

ennial fidelity. The combination of
| Gregory and me proved irresistible at
all Gopherville's social events.
Wishing to create a favourable atmo-
sphere, I wore Gregory at my first party
in England. I learn that Aunt Angela
disclaimed all knowledge of me during
| that evening.
Subsequently she made several deter-
mined attempts to present Gregory to
the gardener, the butcher's boy and to
an itinerant musician as an overcoat
for his simian colleague. Had I foiled
her in all of these to be beaten in the
end? No, not without a struggle. I
scampered downstairs again and, wrest-
ing Harriet's bicycle from its owner's
hands (Harriet is the housemaid and it
was her night out), was soon pedalling
furiously after Edward.
The jumble sale was being held in
the schools and all St. Gwithian was
there, fighting tooth and nail over the
bargains. A jumble sale is to rus what
remnant sales are to urbs. I battled
my way round to each table in turn,
but nowhere could I find my poor dear
old Gregory. Then I saw Etta, the
presiding genius, and butted my way
towards her.

a full description of the lost one.
Etta nodded. “Sort of illuminated

I have.” -
“Tell me,” I panted—“tell me, is it
sold yet? Who bought it? Where
is—?”
“It's not sold yet,” said Etta calmly.
“There was such rivalry over it that
it's going to be raffled. Tickets half-a-
crown each. Like one 2"
“But it's mine !” I protested.
“On the contrary, it's mine; Angela
gave it to me. If you care to buy all
the tickets—?”
“How much?” I growled.
“Four pounds.”
“But—but that's twice as much as
I paid for it originally l’”
“I know,” said Etta sweetly, “but
prices have risen terribly owing to the
War.”

I found Edward outside leaning on his
jaded velocipede. He was wearing the
“Limit.”
“Hello,” said he, “got what you
wanted ?”
“Yes,” said I, “and so, I observe,

THINGS AWAY. THEY 'RE 'ARD-BoILED AND
THE MOO-COW.
I was getting so tired of the synco-
pated life of town (and it didn't fit in
with my present literary work) that I
bribed my old pal Hobson to exchange
residences with me for six months, with
option; so now he has my flat in town,
complete with Underground Railway
and street noises (to say nothing of
jazz music wherever he goes), and I
have his country cottage, old-fashioned
and clean, and a perfectly heavenly
silence to listen to. Still, there are
noises, and their comparative infre-
quency makes them the more noticeable.
Thereis, for instance, acow that bothers
me more than a little. It has chosen,
or there has been chosen, for its day
nursery a field adjoining my (really
Hobson's) garden. It has selected a
spot by the hedge, almost under the
study window, as a fit and proper place
for its daily round of mooing.
Possibly this was at Hobson's request.
Perhaps he likes the sound of mooing,
or, conceivably, the cow doesn't like
Hobson, and moos to annoy him. But
surely it cannot mistake me for him.
We are not at all alike. He is short
*
and dark; I am tall and fair. This has
given rise to a question in my mind:
Can cows distinguish between human
beings?
Anyway the cow worries me with
its continual fog-horn, and I thought
I would write to the owner (a small
local dairy-farmer) to see if he could
manage to find another field in which
to batten this cow, where it could moo
till it broke its silly tonsils for all I
should care; so I indited this to him:—
MY DEAR SIR,-You have in your
entourage a cow that is causing me
some annoyance. It is one of those red-
and-white cows (an Angora or Pomer-
anian perhaps; I don't know the names
of the different breeds, being a town
mouse), and it has horns of which one
is worn at an angle of fifteen or
twenty degrees higher than the other.
This may help you to identify it. It
possesses, moreover, a moo which is a
blend between a ship's siren and a taxi-
cab's honk syringe. If you haven't
heard either of these instruments you
may take my word for them. Further,
I think it may really assist you if I
describe its tail. The last two feet of it
have become unravelled, and the upper
part is red, with a white patch where
the tail is fastened on to the body.
It is only the moo part of the cow
that is annoying me; I like the rest of
it. I am engaged in writing a book on
the Dynamic Force of Modern Art, and
a solo on the Moo does not blend well
with such labour as mine.
There are hens here at Hillcroft.
This remark may seem irrelevant, but
not if you read on. Every time one of
these hens brings five-pence-halfpenny
worth of egg into the world it makes
a noise commensurate with this feat.
But I contend that even if your cow
laid an egg every time it moos (which
it doesn't, so far as my survey reveals)
its idiotic bellowing would still be out
of all proportion to the achievement.
Even milk at a shilling a quart scarcely
justifies such assertiveness.
My friend Mr. Hobson may, of
course, have offended the animal in
question, but even so I cannot see why
I should have to put up with its
horrible revenge; which brings me to
the real and ultimate reason for troub-
ling you, and that is, to ask you if you
will be so good as to tell the cow to
desist, and, in case of its refusal, to

remove it to other quarters. If the
annoyance continues I cannot answer
for the consequences. N
Thanking you in anticipation,

The reply ran —
DEER SIR,-i am not a scollard and
can't understand more'n 'alf your letter
if you don't lik my cow why not go
back were you cum from i dunno what
you mean by consequences but if you
lay 'ands on my cow i'll 'ave the lor of
you. Yours obedient HENRY GIBBs.
I felt that I hadn't got off very well
with Henry, and thought I would try
again, so wrote:—
DEAR MR. GIBBS,-Thank you so
much for your too delightful letter. I
am afraid you somewhat misappre-
hended the purport of mine. I freely
admit your right to turn all manner of
beasts into your demesne; equally do I
concede to them the right to play upon
such instruments as Nature has handed
out to them; but I also claim the right
to be allowed to carry on my work un-
disturbed. The consequences would be
to me, not to the cow, unless laryn-
gitis supervenes. . I love cows, and I
greatly admire this particular cow, but
not its moo; that is all.
Is it, do you suppose, uttering some
Jeremiad or prophecy? Can it, for ex-
ample, be foretelling the doom of the
middle classes? Or is it possible that
against some injurious treatment re-
ceived from its master?
I have discovered that our daily
supply of milk is supplied by your herd,
and on inquiry I find that our cook is
not at all confident that a quart of the
same as delivered to us would satisfy the
requirements of the Imperial standard
of measurement.
If the animal's fog-horn continues I
shall take it as an indignant protest
against a slight that has been cast on
its fertility, and shall seriously think
of calling in the Food-Inspector to ex-
amine you in the table of liquid measure.
Delightful weather we have been ex-
periencing, have we not ”
Believe me as ever, dear Mr. Gibbs,
Yours most sincerely,
ARTHUR K. WILKINSON.
I do not know how much my corre-
spondent understood of this letter, but,
as the moo-cow was shortly afterwards
relegated to fresh pastures, and as we
are getting decidedly better measure for
our milk money, I gather that he had
enough intelligence for my purposes.
The threat which I thus put at a
venture may be recommended to anyone
suffering from the moo nuisance.

THE London University Correspondent of The Observer
has been deploring the fact that a number of professors and
lecturers have lately resigned their poorly-paid academic
positions in order to take up commercial and industrial
posts at much higher salaries. Among the instances he
cites is that of a Professor of Chemistry at King's College,
who has been appointed Director of Research to the British
Cotton Industry Research Association.
The movement, which the writer denounces as bearing
“too obvious an analogy to the killing of the golden
goose,” is not however confined to London University.
From the great seats of learning all over the country the
same complaint is heard. We learn, for instance, that Mr.
Angus McToddie, until recently Professor of Physics at the
John Walker University, N.B., has vacated that post on his
appointment as Experimental Adviser to the British Con-
stitutional Whisky Manufacturers'Association.
Past and present alumni of Tonypandy will learn with
regret that the University is to lose the services of its Pro-
fessor of Live Languages, Mr. O. Evans, who is about
to assume the responsible and highly-remunerated position
of Director of Research to the Billingsgate Fishporters'
Self-Help Society.
The Egregius Professor of Ancient. History at Giggles-
wick University will shortly take up his duties as Editor of

THE RIDING LESSON.
Phillida arrived up to time with her
suit-case, a riding-crop and a large copy
of D'AULNoy's Fairy Tales. She was
not very communicative as we drove
out, and I sought to draw her. You
never, by the way, talk down to Phillida.

down to any child; but to employ this

off without any fuss. Once on a horse,
she had no difficulty in maintaining a
perfect continuity of speech, and I soon
felt relieved of all anxiety about her
safety. If she was not an old and
practised hand, she had nerve and
balance, and I did not think fit to pro-
duce the leading rein which I had
smuggled into my pocket.
We trotted a perfect three miles, and
she had an eye to the country and a
word to say about all she saw. When

once started, would dash for home. If
the child could only stick it, all might
be well. I pounded along, and after a
two-mile run I came on them. She had
pulled him in and was walking him,
waiting for me, a little turned in the
saddle, one minute hand resting lightly
on his broad back. She was prettily
flushed, her hair blown, but she hadn't
even lost her crop. -
“Did you stop to get my cap 2" she
said as we came up. “Thanks awfully.”
“’M,” responded Phillida
in the manner of a child
sucking sweets. Phillida
was not sucking sweets, and
I accepted my snub. We
drove on for a bit in silence.
Phillida removed her hat,
and her bobbed hair went
all round her head like a
brown busby. I looked
round and was embarrassed
to find the straight grey
eyes fixed on my face, the
expression in them almost
rapturous.
“Jolly country, isn't it?”
I essayed hurriedly, with a
comprehensive wave of my
whip.
The preoccupied “'M”
was repeated with even less
emphasis.
Another protracted
silence. I decided not to in-
terfere with the course of
nature as manifested in one
small grey-eyed maiden of
eight. Presently there burst
from her ecstatically, “Un-
cle Dick, is this the one I'm
going to ride?” So that was
it. From that moment we
got on splendidly. We dis-
cussed, agreed and disagreed
over breeds, paces, sizes. I
told her the horse she would
ride would be twice the size
of Rex, and she nearly fell

being forgotten.
The present position in the challenge
for the World's Halma Championship
is this. Mr. George P. Henrun is
patriotically endeavouring to secure the
contest for Britain, and to that end has
put up a purse of half-a-guinea. The
Société Halma de Bordeaux has cut in
with a firm offer of twenty-two francs,
and the matter now remains in abey-
ance while financial advisers calculate
the rate of exchange in order to ascer-
tain which proposal is the more advan-
tageous. The challenger, of course, is
Tommy Jupes, aged twelve, of Ashby-
de-la-Zouche. His opponent, the cham-
pion, has an advantage of three years
in age and two inches in reach, but the
strategy of Master Jupes is said to be
irresistible. Only last week he over-
whelmed his mother, herself a scratch
player, when conceding her four men
and the liberty to cheat twice.
The public will be thrilled to hear
that a match has now been arranged
between the two lady aspirants for the
World's Patience Championship, viz.,
Miss Tabitha Templeman, of Bath, and
Miss Priscilla J. Jarndyce, of Washing-
of both ladies the contest will take place
in mid-Atlantic, on a liner. There will
be no seconds, but Miss Templeman
will be accompanied by the pet Persian,
which she always holds in her lap
while º and Miss Jarndyce will
bring with her the celebrated foot-
warmer which is associated with her
greatest triumphs. The vexed question
of the allocation of cinema royalties
has been settled through the tact of
Mr. Manketlow Spefforth, author of
Patience for the Impatient. One lady
wanted the royalties to be devoted to
a Home for Stray Cats, and the other
expressed a desire to benefit the Society
for the Preservation of Wild Bird Life.
Mr. Spefforth's happy compromise is
that the money shall be assigned to the
Fund in aid of Distressed Spinsters.
Bert Hawkins, of Whitechapel, has
expressed his willingness, on suitable
terms, to meet T'gumbu, the powerful
Matabele, in a twenty-ball contest for
the World's Cokernut-Shying Cham-
pionship. There is however a deadlock
over details. T'gumbu's manager is
adamant that the match shall take
place in his nominee's native village of
Mpm, but Mr. Hawkins objects, seeing
little chance of escaping alive after the
victory of which he is so confident. He
says he would “feel more safer like on
'Ampstead 'Eaf.” Another difficulty is
that Mr. Hawkins insists on wearing his
this is regarded by T"gumbu as savour-
ing of witchcraft. Mr. Hawkins gener-
ously offers his opponent permission to
wear any article of his wives' clothing;
but the coloured candidate quite reason-
ably retorts that this concession is
practically valueless. On one point for-
tunately there is unaniminity: both
parties are firm that all bad nuts must
be replaced.

THE TALE OF THE TUNEFUL TUB.
[“Why do so many people sing in the bath-
room? . . . The note is struck for them by
the running water. While the voice sounds
resonantly in the bath-room it is not half so
fine and inspiring when the song is continued
in the dressing-room. The reason is that the
furniture of the dressing-room tends to deaden
the reverberations.”—Prof. W. II. Bragg on
“The World of Sound.")
WHEN to my morning tub I go,
With towel, dressing-gown and soap,
Then most, the while I puff and blow,
My soul with song doth overflow
(Not unmelodiously, I hope).
The plashing of the H. and C.
Castalian stimulus affords;
I reach with ease an upper G
And, like the wild swan, carol free
The gamut of my vocal chords.
And when, my pure ablutions o'er,
The larynx fairly gets to work,
Amid the unplugged water's roar
I caper, trolling round the floor,
In tones as rich as THoMAS BURRE.
But in my dressing-room's retreat
My native wood-notes wilt and sag;
Not there those raptures I repeat;
My bellow now becomes a bleat
(For reasons, ask Professor BRAGG).
So, Ruth, if song may find a path
Still through thy heart, be listening by
The bathroom while I take my bath;
But leave before the aftermath, -
Nor while I'm dressing linger nigh.
On the acoustic side, I fear,
My chest of drawers is quite a “dud;”
The chairs would silence Chanticleer,
Nor would I have you overhear
When I have lost my collar-stud.
B00KS AND BACKS.
The proposal to revive the old “yellow
back" cover for novels, partly in the in-
terest of economy in production, partly
to attract the purchaser by the lure of
colour, has caused no little stir in the
literary world. In -order to clarify
opinion on the subject Mr. Punch has
been at pains to secure the following
expressions of their views from some of
the leading authors of both sexes:—
Mr. J. M. KEYNES, C.B., the author
of the most sensational book of the hour,
contributed some interesting observa-
tions on the economics of the dye in-
dustry and their bearing on the ques-
tion. These we are reluctantly obliged
to omit. We may note however his
general conclusion that the impact on
the public mind of a book often varies
in an inverse ratio with the attractive-
ness of its appearance or its title. At
the same time he admits that if he had
called his momentous work The Terrible
rainbow cover with a Cubist design, its
circulation might have been eyen greater
than it actually is... But then, as he
candidly owns, “ as a Cambridge man,
I may be inclined to attach an undue
importance to ‘Backs.'”
Mr. FREDERIC HARRIsoN writes:
“MATT. ARNoLD once chaffed me for
keeping a guillotine in my back-garden.
But my real colour was never sea-green
in politics any more than it is yellow
in literature or journalism. Yet I have
a great tenderness for the old yellow-
backs of fifty years ago. Yellow Books
are another story. The yellow-backs
may have sometimes affronted the eye,
but for the most part they were dove-
like in their outlook. Now ‘red ruin
and the breaking-up of laws' flaunt
themselves in the soberest livery. I
do not often drop into verse, but this
inversion of the old order has suggested
these lines, which you may care to
print:—
“In an age mid-Victorian and mellow,
Ere the current of life ran askew,
The backs of our novels were yellow,
Their hearts were of Quaker-like hue;
But now, when extravagant lovers
Their hectic emotions parade,
In sober or colourless covers
We find them arrayed.'"
Mr. CHARLEs GARVICE points out that
the choice of colour in '. calls
for especial care and caution at the
present time, owing to the powerful
influence of association. Yellow might
lend impetus to the Yellow Peril. Red
is especially to be avoided owing to its
unfortunate appropriation by Revolu-
tionary propagandists. Blue, though
affected by statisticians and Govern-
ment publishers, has a traditional con-
nection with the expression of senti-
ments of an antinomian and heterodox
character. ... At all costs the sobriety
and dignity of fiction should be main-
tained, and sparing use should be made
of the brighter hues of the spectrum.
He had forgotten a good deal of his
Latin, but there still lingered in his
memory the old warning: “O formose
puer, mimium me crede colori.”
. Miss DAisy Ashford, another of our
“best sellers,” demurs to the view that
a gaudy or garish exterior is needed to
catch the public eye. The enlightened
child - author scorned such devices.
Books, like men and women—especi-
ally women—ought not to be judged
by their backs, but by their hearts.
She confessed, however, to a weakness
for "jackets" as a form of attire pecu.
liarly consecrated to youth.
Madame MonTEssori cables from
Rome as follows:—“The colour of
book-covers is of vital importance in
education. I wish to express my strong
conviction that, where books for the
be taken by publishers without holding
an unfettered plébiscite of all children
under twelve. Also that the polychro-
matic series of Fairy Stories edited by
the late Mr. ANDREw LANG should be
at once withdrawn from circulation,
not only because of the reckless and
unscientific colour scheme adopted, but
to check the wholesale dissemination
of futile fables concocted and invented
by irresponsible adults of all ages and
countries.”
SONGS OF THE HOME.
III.--THE GUEST.
I HAVE a friend; his name is John ;
He's nothing much to dote upon,
But, on the whole, a pleasant soul
And, like myself, no paragon.
I have a house, and, then again,
An extra room to take a guest:
And in my house I have a spouse.
It's good for me; I don't protest.
By her is every virtue taught;
Man does as he is told, and ought:
He has to eat his own conceit,
So, “Just the place for John!"Ithought.
The unsuspecting guest arrives;
But (note the worthlessness of wives)
Does he endure the kill-or-cure
Refining process? No, he thrives.
He's led to think that he has got
The very virtues I have not;
Her every phrase is subtle praise,
And oh! how he absorbs the lot.
She finds his wisdom full of wit
And listens to no end of it;
And if he dash tobacco-ash
On carpets doesn't mind a bit.
All that the human frame requires,
From flattery to bedroom fires,
Is his; and I must self-deny
To satisfy his least desires.
I have a friend; his name is John;
I tell him he is “getting on ”
And “growing fat,” and things like
that . . . .
He pays no heed. He's too far gone.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN the war-after-the-war, the bombardment of books
that is now so violently raging upon all fronts, any contri-
bution by a writer as eminent as Lord HALDANE naturally
commands the respect due to weapons of the heaviest
calibre. Unfortunately “heavy" is here an epithet un-
kindly apt, since it has to be admitted that the noble
lord wields a pen rather philosophic than popular, with the
result that Before the War (CASSELL) tells a story of the
highest interest in a manner that can only be called pon-
derous. Our ex-War Minister is, at least chiefly, respond-
ing to the literary offensives of BETHMANN-Hollweg and
TIRPITz, in connection with whose books his should be
read, if the many references are properly to be understood.
As every reader will know, however, Lord HALDANE could
hardly have delivered his apologia before the accuser with-
out the gates and not at the same time had an eye on the
critic within. Fortunately it is here no part of a reviewer's
task to obtrude his own political theories. With regard to
the chief indictment, of having permitted the country to
be taken unawares, the author betrays his legal training by
a defence which is in effect (1) that circumstances compelled
our being so taken, and that (2) we weren't. On this and
other matter, however, the individual reader, having paid
his money (7s.6d. net), remains at liberty to take his choice.
One revelation at least emerges clearly enough from Lord
HALDANE's pages—the danger of playing diplomat to a
are not helpful in avoiding wars” is one of many conclusions,
double-edged perhaps, to which he is led by retrospect of
his own trials. His book, while making no concessions to
the modern demand for vivacity, is one that no student of
the War and its first causes can neglect.
It is not Mr. L. CoPE CoRNFORD's fault that his initials
are identical with those of the London County Council, nor
do I consider it to be mine that his rather pontifical atti-
tude towards men and matters reminds me of that august
body. Anyone ignorant of recent inventions might be
excused for thinking that The Paravane Adventure (HopDER
AND STOUGHTON) is the title of a stirring piece of sensa-
tional fiction. But fiction it is not, though in some of its
disclosures it may be considered sensational enough. In
this history of the invention of the Paravane Mr. CoRNFORD
hurls a lot of well-directed bricks at Officialdom, and con-
cludes his book by giving us his frank opinion of the way
in which the Navy ought to be run. It is impossible, even
if one does not subscribe to all his ideas, to refrain from
commending the enthusiasm with which he writes of those
who, in spite of great difficulties, set to work to invent and
perfect the Paravane. If you don't know what a Paravane
is I have neither the space nor the ability to tell you;
but Mr. CoRNFord has, and it's all in the book.

the portrait of the heroine and the story of her life in

declaring that I found Mrs. Walbridge and her egregious
husband and the general situation at Happy House frankly
incredible. Pleasantly incredible, I should have added; and
I rather liked the young man, Oliver, from Fleet Street,
whom the Great Man had recently made Editor of Sparks
and who realised that he was destined to be a titled million-
aire, for is not that the authentic procedure? Hence his
fanatical obstinacy in wooing his, if you ask me, none too
desirable bride. I hope I am not doing the author a dis-
service in describing this as a thoroughly wholesome book,
well on the side of the angels. It has the air of flowing
easily from a practised pen. But nothing will induce me
to believe that Mrs. Walbridge, putting off her Victorian
airs, did win the prize competition with a novel in the
modern manner.
Mr. ALEXANDER MACFARLAN's new story, The Inscrutable
Lovers (HEINEMANN), is not the first to have what one
may call Revolutionary Ireland for its background, but
it is by all odds the most readable, possibly because it is
Certainly those who think of marriage as a high calling, for
which the vocation is love, will be as much annoyed with
her as was her cousin Lucy, the idealist, at once the most
amusing and most pathetic figure in the book. I am quite
sure that Susies and Lucy's both abound, and that Mrs.
Dowd'ALL knows all about them; but I am not equally sure
that the Susies deserve the encouragement of such a
brilliant dissection. Yet the men whose happiness she
played with believed in Susie's representation of herself as
quite well-meaning, and other women who saw through her
liked her in spite of their annoyance; and—after all the
other things I have said—I am bound, in sincerity, to
admit that I liked her too.
You could scarcely have given a novelist a harder case
than to prove the likeableness of Cherry Mart, as her
actions show her in September (METHUEN), and I wonder
how a Victorian writer would have dealt with the terrible
chit. But FRANK Sw1NNERTON, of course, is able to hold
these astonishing briefs with ease. Here is a girl who first

marriage and the sub-
sequent events which reveal to each the other's true tempera-
ment provide the “plot" of The Inscrutable Lovers. Though
slender it is original and might lend itself either to farce or
tragedy. Mr. MACFARLAN's attitude is pleasantly analytical.
It is indeed his delightful air of remote criticism, his restrained
and epigrammatic style queerly suggestive of Romain Roll-
LAND in The Market Place, and his extremely clever portrai-
ture, rather than any breadth or depth appertaining to the
story itself, that entitle the author to a high place among the
young novelists of to-day. Mr. MACFARLAN–is he by any
chance the Rev. ALEXANDER MACFARLAN ?—may and doubt-
less will produce more formidable works of fiction in due
course; he will scarcely write anything smoother, more
sparing of the superfluous word or that offers a more
perfect blend of sympathy and analysis.
Susie (DUCKworTH) is the story of a minx or an exposi-
tion of the eternal feminine according to the reader's own
convictions. I am not sure—and I suppose that places
me among those who regard her heroine as the mere
minx—that the Hon. Mrs. Dowdaſ,I, has done well in
Nigel, he is impetuous and handsome, and falls in love with
Marian because she is sympathetic, and with Cherry because
she is Cherry, and also perhaps a little because the War
has begun and the day of youth triumphant has arrived.
But he does not make a very deep impression upon me, and
as for Marian's husband, who is big and rather stupid, and
always has been, I gather, a bit of a dog, he scarcely counts
at all. Marian, however, is an extremely clever and intricate
study, and for Cherry—I don't really know whether I like
Cherry or not. But I have certainly met her.
Mr. Punch has pleasure in calling attention to two small
volumes, lately issued, which reproduce matter that has
appeared in his pages and therefore does not need any
further token of his approbation: to wit, A Little Loot

(With the British Army in France.)
“I NoTICED the old sapper instinct
asserting itself in Mac when he tried
to tunnel out of that bunker at the
seventh,” said Denny after tea in the
golf club-house. “He’d have found
some opportunities on a really sporting
course like ours at Villers - Vereux.
Remember Willers, Ponting?” -
“It wasn't a golf links as I remember
it,” said Ponting grimly.
“Bless you, I'm not speaking of
those far-away days. I'm talking of a
month or two back, when I was there
with a Chinese Salvage Company trying
to clear up the mess you made. Beastly
quiet it was, too. The only excitement
was a playful habit the Chink had con-
tracted of picking up a rusty rifle and
a salvaged clip of cartridges, pointing
the gun anywhere and pulling the
trigger to make it say Bang ! I often
found myself doin' the old B.E.F.
tummy-wriggle when the Chinois was
really happy.
“One Sunday—a non-working day
—when all was drab and dreary and
existence seemed a double-blank, my
orderly mentioned that he had dis-
of the hutments. Evidently they were
the remains of the spoils of a lightning
foray on the Base. A further search
revealed a couple of elliptical balls,
quite good in places. So I tipped my
cub, Laxey, out of his bunk and we
proceeded to resurrect our pre-war
form. By-and-by we got adventurous,
and Laxey challenged me to play him
a match after lunch for ten francs a
side. The details required some arrang-
ing, as there were no greens or holes,
but eventually we decided on a cross-
country stroke competition, starting
from the hut-door and finishing at a
crump hole, map ref. : B 26c, 08,35.
“We tossed for clubs, and as I won
I picked a driver and a hockey stick,
leaving Laxey a brassie and a putter
head tied to a whangee cane that gave
it plenty of whip. Laxey was spot, and
broke with a ten-yard drive. Then I
teed up and drove with a good follow-
through action that carried me round
several circles before I could stop.
“I did better the next time, and
made my ball rather sorry that it had
been making fun of me. Laxey had a
bad lie and, though he lofted his ball
with the putter (as I said, the whangee
did give it ‘whip'), he didn't clear the

man to keep the count. Otherwise
your play will be affected by arithme-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“'Send them away, Wilkins,' I said
irritably. “Can't you see they're put-
ting me off my game?'
“Wilkins shoved them off, and I took
the old German line with a rush.
While I was so to speak consoli-
dating, a runner arrived from Laxey
asking for the loan of a pair of wire-
cutters.
“‘’E's 'ung up on the wire, Sir,"
said the runner, 'an' cursing the
artillery somethink awful from force
of 'abit.'
“I sent a pair of nail-scissors with
my compliments, and would Mr. Laxey
kindly inform me what was his score
to date? Laxey'returned the scissors,
saying that he found he could manage
better with a tie-clip, and his score at
15.30 hours was 346, please. Cheered
by the knowledge that I was a matter of
twenty to the good, I executed a brilliant
dribble along a ditch, neatly tricked a
couple of saplings and finished with a
long spinning-jenny into a camouflaged
strong point. By this time Wilkins
was in such a maze of mathematics
that he hadn't time to scare off the
coolies, who were tumbling up in large
numbers and giving a generous meed
of applause.
“Towards the 400 Laxey, who also
had a good gallery of Chinks, was losing
touch, and I advised him by runner to
change direction. He thanked me, but
said that, in view of the difficult nature
of the terrain, he had decided to work
round from a flank. Feeling that I
was nearing the objective I organised
a series of approach-shots with the
driver, and sent to ask Laxey if he
would care to accept fifty start. How-
ever, having foozled into a ruined
pillbox, I reduced the offer by half, and
later on, confident—not to say insult-
ing—reports from Laxey induced me
to withdraw the concession altogether.
“At 16.30 hours precisely, amid
intense excitement on the part of the
Celestial audience, we arrived at the
deciding crump-hole simultaneously.
When I say we arrived, I mean that
Laxey had an eight-yard putt from a
good lie—an easy proposition with the
whangee putter—and I was ten yards
away in as wicked a little crevice as
you could wish to find.
“‘If it doesn't shake your nerve,
skipper,’ said Laxey, ‘I might mention
that my score is 543.”
“‘You’d better give me the game,
then,' I answered. ‘I'm but a modest
520.”
“‘Not jolly likely. You'll take at
least twenty to get out of that burrow.
Besides, I know Wilkins is rotten at
figures, and I claim a recount.”

held a distinct advantage in position I
decided on a strenuous effort to halve
the game. I took a firm stance and the
hockey stick and let drive for the hole
with a tremendous pickaxe stroke.
Instantly there was a blinding flash
and an explosion, and, when we had
finished picking sand out of our ears
and eyes and allayed the excitement of
the Chinks, we discovered my ball com-
fortably nestling in the crump-hole.
“‘If assistance with derelict Mills

HOME THOUGHTS FROM HIND.
1920.
BAck in the years of youth, a thought-
less thruster,
I did adventure to the East and spurn
My native land, and foolishly entrust
her
To other guardians pending my
return ;
And now time bears me to the second
lustre,
And I am old and weary and I burn
To freshen memories waxing somewhat
vague;
But men say, “Shun old England like
the plague.”
Lord knoweth Hind is not a place of
pleasure
Nor such a land as men forsake with
tears; -
Lord knoweth how we venerate and
treasure
The English memory down the Indian
years;
Yet now the mail pours forth in flowing
linea,Sure
England's un-Englishness, and in
Our ears
Echo the words of men returned from
leave,
Describing Englands one can scarce
believe.
Englands abandoned to the fleeting
passions,
Feckless as Fez, hysterical as Gaul,
All nigger-music and fantastic fashions
(And not a house from Leith to
London Wall);
Where food and coal are dealt you out
in rations
And you can hardly raise a drink at
all,
And tailors charge you twenty pounds
a touch.
Is that a place for Nabobs?
much.
No, not
Better were Hind where troubles more
or less stick
To one set style and do not drive
you mad
With changes; where a roof and a
domestic,
Petrol and usquebagh can still be
had ;
And one can trust the Taj and the
Majestic
(Bombay hotels
too bad) -
To stand for culture in the hour of need
And stop one running utterly to seed.

Hind be it; as for Home—festima lente;
Hind be it and a station in the sun,
Wherein if peace abideth not nor plenty
At least you are not ruined and un-

If all the English England's dead and

LITTLE TALES FOR YOUNG PLUMBERS.
THE Conversion of GEORGE.
George was a plumber by trade and
a striker by occupation. He did his
plumbing in his holidays, when he was
not busy. He liked plumbing, as it gave
his throat a rest. He was really the
Champion Long Distance Plumber of the
World and had gained the R.S.V.P.'s
gold medal for doing the back-in-a-
minute-to-get-your-tools in more than
two hours. And his heart was as
tender as his feet. If he heard a clock
strike helonged to strike in sympathy,so
that hard-hearted employers who knew
George's weakness always kept their
time-pieces muffled.
The bursting of our water-pipe was
the means of bringing me into touch
with George. He joined our bathing-
party in the front hall, and said simply,
“I am the plumber.” Just like that. He
then said that he would swim home for
his tools, as he had forgotten the can-
opener. When he got back Auntie was
drowned. *
He did not stay long, as he had to go
on sympathetic strike with the graziers.
He was not really a grazier as well as
a plumber, but his heart was so tender
that he couldn't keep on plumbing so
as to give satisfaction, he said, as long
as the graziers were not grazing, so to
speak. It didn't really matter. No-
thing matters nowadays. I just went
out and sold the house as it stood for
an enormous sum and emigrated on the
proceeds to Tooting Bec.
But this tract deals with George and
his conversion, and has been written
specially to be put into the hands of
young plumbers. Let us see then
how George gave up his sinful ways
and how his heart was changed.
It began with his tooth—an old, old
tooth. It had done some work in its
time, but it decided to strike. And
strike it did. George gave it beer—
Government beer—and it hit George
back, good and hard. George then
began to talk to it. He asked if it knew
what it was doing of. He threatened it
with more Government beer if it didn't
get on with its work more quiet-like.
The tooth sat up then and bit George.
“All right, young fellow my lad,”
said George; “you come out along o'
me, and come quiet. You're going to
the dentist's, you are, and he'll Bol-
shevise you proper, he will.”
The tooth stopped aching at once;
knew it was only just lying low, to
break out into sympathetic strike on
Monday morning. So out he rushed
with it and took it to the dentist. I
was the dentist.
I led George gently by the hand to
my nice little chair and told him what
beautiful weather we were having for
the time of the year. I said, “Open,
please,” and George opened. I then
took my nice little steel whangee,
beautifully polished, and tickled the de-
linquent. A gentle tickle and no more.
I didn't really go far—not farther than
his back collar-stud—but George said
things as if I were a capitalist.
I then said coldly, “It doesn't hurt 1"
I am what is known in the profession
as a painless dentist and rarely feel
much pain.
I capped his repartee by remarking,
“Keep open, please.” That always
shuts 'em up. George kept open. I
then spilt some cotton - wool in his
tooth and put up some scaffolding in
the entrance of his mouth, and said
nonchalantly (I always charge extra
for this), “I have forgotten my niblick;
keep open. I shall be back anon.” I
then went out and had lunch.
When I came back George was still
keeping open, but he looked at me very
wicked with his blue eyes and asked me
from under the cotton-wool if I ever
intended to finish my ruddy little job.
I said, “Dear brother and oppressed
fellow-striker, I regret that I cannot.
I see by The Dentists' Daily that our
Union has declared a sympathetic
strike with the Amalgamated Excava-
tors and Theological Students. You
have my sympathy. I can no more.”
George tried to persuade me as we
went downstairs together, bumping our
heads on each step in turn, but it was
of no avail.
I do not however regret my pious
invention, as I hear that George is a
changed man. Being intelligent, he
thought things over for himself, instead
of letting a man in a red tie do it for
him, and after six weeks came to the
conclusion that a strike is a game that
more than one can play at. He strikes
now only in his holidays. He never
now forgets his tools or leaves taps
running. He does a good day's plumb
for a good day's pay. And he sings
while he works. Strange to say that
little tooth of his has given up striking
too. -
But yet it is not strange, for, as I
told you, it was a wisdom tooth:

FIXES THE HARE.
I Found Andy Devenish, of Castle
Devenish, Co. Cork, in Piccadilly. He
was wearing an old frieze overcoat, the
bottom of which had suffered from a
puppy's teeth, and a bowler hat with a
guard-ring dangling from its flat brim.
His freckled nose was squashed against
Fore's window as he gazed wistfully at
the sporting prints within. I led him
gently westwards, pushed him into the
club's best arm-chair, placed the wine
of our mutual country at his elbow and
spoke to him severely.
“Tell me,” said I, “how is it I find
you thus, got up in the height of fashion,
loitering with intent to lady-kill in this
colossal rabbit-warren which knows no
foxes, eh? Aren't they entitled to some
consideration ? Didn't they carry on
patiently for four dull years while you
were in France, learning to walk in the
cavalry, on the understanding that
you'd make up for it when you got
back by hunting them every day of the
week? Have you no love or sympathy
for dumb animals? Why are you here?
What are you flying from ? Tell me
your dread secret. Is it debt, arson,
murder—or is some woman threatening
to marry you?” . . . . .

soda, then suddenly pointed out of the
window. “See the advertisement on

I was pitching her the yarn. I cornered
the lass alone in the MacManus' draw-
ing-room, went down on my knees and
threw off a dandy proposal I had learnt
by heart out of a book. The girl curled
about all over the sofa with emotion,
and for a bit I thought my eloquence
was doing it. Then I perceived she
was near shaken to pieces with
laughter. Couldn't think why till I

to the decent poor farmers round about
that there'd be ricks fired and cows
ripped if they allowed me to hunt their
lands, so I got stopped everywhere. I
had land enough of my own to carry on
with, so I hunted there till the foxes and
hares gave out, which they precious
soon did, seeing that half the neigh-
bourhood was out shooting, trapping,
poisoning and lurching them.
“I bought a stag from a feller in
Limerick and chased that for a bit;
then on a 'tween day, when I was away
and the deer out grazing in the demesne,
somebody slipped a brace of Mauser
bullets into it, and that form of diver-
sion was likewise at an end. As far as
I could see an animal wouldn't stand

and I'll be afther findin' some little
object to hunt, that them dirthy blag-
yards won't shoot at all.'
“Two mornings later he turned up,
dragging something in an oat-sack.
“I have it here that 'll course out
before the houn's like a shootin'-star,'
says he.
“‘What is it?’ says I.
“The rogue put his hand in the sack
and drew out a yellow mongrel dog.
“‘Where did ye get that?’ says I.
“‘Shure didn't I borry it?’ says he.
“And who did ye borrow it from ?’
says I.
“‘From Misther Flynn, no less,’ says
he. ''Tis his little foxey pet dog.'
“Does Mr. Flynn know you bor-

“‘Begob that he does not,’ says he.
‘Mr. Flynn is beyond in Youghal and

you could pretty nigh eat it. I gave
him a fair start, then laid the hounds
on and we had a five-mile point, going
like a steeplechase all the way. Flynn

good to last. On the fourth day we
were nearing Flynn's house, the dog
leading the pack by not fifty yards,

the left, while the hounds tumbled into
a little boreen that runs up from the
railway-station and went streaking
down it singing out as if they were on
a breast-high scent and in view.

her teeth to the tails of his shirt,
Cruiskeen ripping the trousers off him
a leg at a time, and the rest of the
pack leaping under him like the surf of
the sea.
“I nearly rolled off my mare with
laughter, though well I knew the

LABOUR AND ART;
OR, THE CoNVERSION OF BINKs.
You have stood at some time, I suppose, with a sense of
disaster
And gazed at a picture resembling an egg on a mat, ..
Or a sideslip of squares in the mode of a Pimlico master?—
Well, Binks's “Rebellion " and “Afternoon Tea in my
Flat”
Were extremely like that.
He was nuts upon Beauty was Binks, and from boyhood
acquainted
With Art, and so bound to her side with such delicate
links
That I doubt if the soul of her, much as we've written and
painted,
Had ever been fathomed (for is she not strange as the
Sphinx?)
Till she got to know Binks.
He had hundreds of phases, and all of them highly sensa-
tional,
A Cubist unbending, a Vorticist equally stout;
Scorned one thing, he said, and one only, the Representa-
tional,
Meaning, I take it, a school where there isn't much doubt
What the whole thing's about.
And at times he would say, as I stared at his riotous
scrimmages -
And asked what on earth was the meaning, “You must
have regard
And it seemed that he thought all these things when he
gazed very hard
At a tub in a yard.
But at times he would tell me that Art was a mere inter-
weaving
Of hues and designs; he had done what he could to expel
All thoughts and all visual objects, for these were deceiving,
And I told him, so far as an ignorant layman could tell,
He had done that quite well.
But I think that of all of his phases the last was most
funny;
He was vestured in white when I met him by chance in
the town;
He had shaved off his beard, his beard, like Apollo's, of honey;
His hair was quite short, he had lost his habitual frown,
He was looking quite brown.
He told me he never exhibited now in a gallery;
Commissions were filling his time and engaging his heart;
What was more, he observed, he was making a regular
salary,
So I asked him to tell me the worst and explain from the
* What had happened to Art.
“I have banished Design,” he informed me, “and thoughts
are all duller
Than Beauty, and Beauty is Art; but no critic can grouse
At the notion of Absolute Pure Indivisible Colour
As calm as Eternity, smooth as omnipotent mous—





To the mind of the artist, for Art is a matter of images,”
I am painting a house.” EvoB.

“THE New Poor 2" said Holder, like
myself, one of them. “ Nonsense.
There are none. There are people
who will not use their imaginations,
of course. They are poor, but not
newly so. This so-called new poverty
doesn't touch me. True, the money I
make will not go so far as it used to,
but my imagination goes very much
farther. I have trained it, encouraged
it, my wife's and boy's too. We have
cast off the absurd restraints imposed
by the law of probability. In the old
days, when I used to think, say, of
motors, I was invariably badgered by
the spectre of improbability. I used
to think of a four-hundred-pound car,
or perhaps, in a daring moment, my
thoughts would creep timidly, like mice
out into a still kitchen, on to the six-
hundred-pound plane, only to scurry
back to the lower plane almost in-
stantly. Now I've thrown all that
overboard. Rubbish ! . When I think
of motors I think in terms of Rolls-
Royces. Why think cheaply? It's a
poor imagination that won't run to a
six-cylinder car at least. Strictly, I
What of it? In my mind I use Rolls-
Royces. We've rather worked the thing
up at home. Come and dine with us
and see for yourself.”
We had sausages and mashed pota-
toes, with water. And I may say that
never have I enjoyed a meal more.
You see, Holder kept on telling us all
the time about the famous dinner which
now, owing to the War, we should
never really eat, but which we were at
perfect liberty to imagine we were eat-
ing. I am sorry you were not there.
The hors d'ouvres / Holder describes

RUSKIN, perhaps. Anyhow, he carried
us quite away.
His wife chose oysters. His descrip-
tion of oysters, instantly furnished, was
a little gem—a pearl, silver-grey, so
much so that I too chose oysters. His
little boy, Dickie, chose caviare; but he
really did not care for it. He bit on a
piece of button in his sausage, poor child.
That was why he did not appreciate
the caviare. But Holder distracted his
mind with some very remarkable mush-
room soup—potage de champigmons—a
brilliant word-sketch. We all chose it.
sole. The little lad, Dickie, chose sal-
mon; but Holder reminded him that he
had had salmon the previous evening;
it was out of season in any case, and
he described how the sole tasted that
probably Dickie will never touch. The
boy appeared to enjoy it immensely.
I think it was the game, simple roast
partridges, exquisitely cooked, which
Mrs. Holder enjoyed most. Her eyes
were frankly shining as she pensively
chewed the third quarter of her sausage,
and she thrilled to the juices of the
partridge of the dinner she could no
longer hope really to eat, but which
Holder, thank God, would often de-
scribe, at any rate until a tax is put on
conversation. Even then something
might be done—deaf and dumb lan-
guage, possibly—an evasion, I admit,
but even the New Poor must eat occa-
sionally.
We all enjoyed the game course
most, with the exception of Dickie.
The lad had finished his sausage, and
mashed potato alone is not inspiring.
But that great man, Holder, noticed
it in time, and he satisfied the child
with a word-painting of the brown
crisp skin of cooked goose. Then we

ransacked the English language for it.
A vivifying champagne.
But enough of food, or you will think
we were gourmands. None of us cared
for any sweets after such a meal. And
that is what I like about the Holders:
with them enough is as good as the
feast they will never have.
After dinner we smoked a very fine
cigar in the imaginary conservatory
which Holder has just run up, and I
have rarely, if ever, heard a better de-
scription of men smoking cigars in a
conservatory. Next, Holder played me
a fast game of billiards. He allowed me
to choose my own table, and I picked
the most expensive in the catalogue.
Dickie marked for us. Then he went
to bed. I heard his father whisper a
most convincing description of eider-
downs and real wool blankets when he
kissed him. He is only a very little
boy—big blue eyes, you know, like a
girl's; they watered a little. Excite-
ment. . . .
It was a clear moonlit night with
a touch of frost in the air, so Mrs.
Holder rang for the visionary footman,
man, according to Holder's quick por-
trait of him, who piled up some great
logs on a bank of coals of a positively
fantastic size, and we gathered round
to enjoy a run in the brand-new, latest
model Rolls-Royce which is one of the
special things which Holder will never
possess in this world. Ah, but she was
a queen of cars, and the best of cars
always run better at night. I wonder
why. So smoothly silky, so dreamily
sweet-running, a pouring of cream | I
wish I could convey to you the satin
sound of her transmission, the low
golden purr of her gears, the fanning
of her velvet wings—wheels, that is.
I would sooner ride in that verbal car
of Holder's than walk round the real
backyard that is my own, unless I fall
behind with the rent, as I begin to fear
I shall. . . .
Down the dreamy moon-drenched
highways, across the magic silver-
flecked moors, we climbed on the wings
of the peregrine to the keen, cold up-
lands, soared awhile, then dropped to
the warm and sheltered valley and so
home again. We felt the radiator,
She will never boil on a stiff hill. Mrs.
Holder was glowing from her ride; for
an instant she looked pink and pretty;
she had lost that wistful pinched look.
I went inside for a phrase or so of
Holder's admirable idea of what cherry
brandy should be. We chatted for a
little about the estate that he will never
purchase, and then I left, having pro-
mised to go round there to-morrow for
a little shooting. It will be hot work
among the pheasants if Holder has not
lost his voice.
He and his wife came down the
drive to the entrance-gates with me.
“Good-night,” they said; “we’re
glad you've enjoyed yourself.”
Holder was a little hoarse, for he is a
generous host. I think too the motor
run had tired them both, for their faces
were again a little haggard; and the
wind had brought tears to the eyes of
Mrs. Holder.
So I said good-bye to them—and to
Jack, their elder boy, whom they will
never see again. He lies in France.
But, you understand, it was as if he
had been with us all again for a little

a good-looking, most willing, sensible
while that evening.

on Modernism in Music. It is satis-
factory to know that the subject is not
to be allowed to drop. Grave discon-
tent is riſe in orchestral circles at the
monopoly enjoyed at spiritualist séances
by the tambourine, and it is reported
that Mr. ERNEST NEwMAN, the distin-
guished and outspoken musical critic,
will shortly deliver a public lecture on
behalf of the admission of other instru-
ments to these mysteries, and in par-
ticular the tuba. The claim of the
tuba, Mr. NEwMAN holds, is not only
based on the profundity of its tones, but
upon long literary tradition. Nothing
could be more conclusive than the refer.
ence in the old Latin hymn:—
“Tuba mirum spargens sonum
Per sepulcra regionum.”
It is anticipated that the discussion
will be attended by Signor MARconi,
Lord DUNSANY, Mr. YEATs and Lieu-
tenant Jon Es, the author of The Road
to En-Dor. -

Meanwhile the conflicting current of
musical materialism is running strong.
The Daily Mail, always in the van of
of the insurgent Georgians with in-
trepid zeal. Mr. JULIUS HARRISON is
extolled in a leading article for finding
a theme for an orchestral work, not
in any of the misty or metaphysical
abstractions which appealed to the ef-
fete Victorian composers, but in plums.
And, mind you, not Carlsbad, but honest
Worcestershire plums, without any
Teutonic taint. Mr. JULIUS HARRISON's
patriotic example is not likely to be
lost on his brother composers. Indeed
it is asserted on credible authority that
Mr. GRANVILLE BANTock, who has com-
pletely forsworn all Oriental and exotic
subjects, is engaged on a gigantic sym-
phony, with choral interludes, entitled
“Yorkshire Pudding;” and that Mr.
Josef HolbrookE is collaborating with
Lord HowARD DE WALDEN in a romantic
historical opera in fifteen Acts called
“From Woad to Broadcloth.”

Mr. BERNARD SHAw, who, it may be
necessary to remind youthful readers,
was a musical critic on The Star and
The World before he achieved fame as
a dramatist, has been causing his friends
and admirers serious misgivings by his
article on Sir Edward ELGAR in a new
musical journal, Music and Letters.
Sir Edward ELGAR has a great follow-
ing; he has written oratorios; he is
an O.M.; yet Mr. SHAw salutes him as
the greatest English composer, the true
lineal descendant of BEETHoveN, one
of the Immortals and the only candidate
for Westminster Abbey ! To find Mr.
SHAw taking a majority view is bad
enough ; it is a case of proving false to
the tradition of a lifetime—a moral
suicide. But why drag in BEETHoveN ?
So left-handed a compliment prompts
the suspicion that, after all, what ap-
pears to be eulogy is in reality nothing
more than an essay in adroitly dis-
sembled obloquy. Mutatis mutandis,
Mr. SHAw would not thank Sir Edward
ELGAR for calling him, for example, the
Voltaire de nos jours. What he does
enjoy is the frank disparagement of
Mr. WILFRID BLUNT, who describes
him in the second volume of My Diary,
just published, as “an ugly fellow, his
face a pasty-white, with a red nose and
a rusty red beard, and little slaty-blue
eyes.”

An interesting but, we regret to say,
decidedly hostile estimate of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE as a musician appears in the
columns of a leading anti-Coalition
daily. The critic discusses the PREMIER
both as vocalist and instrumentalist,
and in both capacities finds him sadly
wanting. The volume of his voice is
small, the timbre is unpleasant, the
production faulty and the intonation
LLoyd GEORGE has a certain flexibility
and facility common to all Welsh
singers, the critic condemns his habit
of resorting to an emotional tremolo
which frequently degenerates into a
mere “wobble.” The PREMIER, he
continues, shows agility and spirit in
florid passages, but his declamation
lacks dignity and his articulation is
often indistinct. As a pianist he is
equally unsatisfactory; his repertory is
extremely limited and he is quite un-
able to interpret the complex harmonies
of the Russian School.
: :k :::
A painful example of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's ignorance is forthcoming in
the astounding fact that he is, or was,
under the impression that Karsavina
was the name of a town, and that the
only musician of the name of Corelli
was the author of The Sorrows of Satan.
The critic concludes with a masterly
analysis of the results of these short-
comings on the vitality of the Coalition
Cabinet, already weakened by the with-
drawal of Mr. BALFou R, a very sound
and accomplished musician of the old
school.

Now Ireturn to my ownland and people,
Old familiar things so to recover,
Hedgerows and little lanes and

The friendliness of my own land and

I have seen a world-frieze of glowing
orange,
Palms painted black on a satin
horizon;
Palm-trees in the dusk and the silence
standing
Straight and still against a background
of orange;
A gorgeous magical pomp of light and
colour,
A dream-world, a sparkling gem in
the sunlight,
The minarets and domes of an Eastern
city;
And, Fine midst of all the pomp of
colour, -
My heart cried out for my own land
and people,
My heart cried out for the lush
meadows of England,
The hedgerows and the little lanes of
England,
And for the faces of my own people.

It was with ill-concealed trepidation
that I approached the Pontifical Person-
age who presides over Messrs. Barkrod
and Tomridge's Zoological Department.
The recollection of my previous and
only encounter with him still burned
in my memory. I had gone thither
with a young nephew on whom in a
rash moment I had urged the satis-
faction to be derived from the study
of natural history and he had countered
with a birthday and a demand that I
should convert precept to practice by
providing him with a pet. -
The P.P. greeted us with benignant
expectancy. His white apron merely
accentuated the obvious fact that he
had come in a limousine. I have since
decided that he mistook me for an
I plunged straightway in medias res.
“I have here,” I said, “a journal of
unimpeachable veracity which declares
that the Pasteur Institute in Paris is
suffering from a guinea-pig shortage.
Please oblige me with your expert
opinion on this momentous matter.”
The P.P. smiled slightly, cleared his
throat and, waving me to the further
end of the menagerie, proceeded to
answer my question. “The common
or Sicilian guinea-pig,” he began, “the
Porculus Auriferus Excubitor of BUF-
Fon, is still fairly common, though I
may say that it is many, a day since
they could be purchased for a guinea.

“Of greater zoological interest per-
haps is this little fellow, Porculus Auri-
ferus Decaudatus, an arboreal species
from the Solomon Islands; or thestriated
guinea-pig of Central Nicaragua, which
I am happily able to show you.”
He placed Nicaragua's most valuable
product in my hand, and it promptly
bit me. That I did not drop it into a
cageful of terrier-pups was wholly due
to the native vigour with which Striatus
hung on.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“A tough hide and some facility of expression”—to
quote the author's modest estimate of his qualifications—
have enabled Rear-Admiral Sir Douglas BRowNRIGG to
make his Indiscretions of the Naval Censor (CAssBLL) the
liveliest book of the War that has come my way. Thanks
to the first element in his make-up he managed to retain
his difficult and delicate post throughout the War, and only
once came into serious collision with any of his official
superiors. As these included First Lords of such diverse
temperament as Mr. CHURCHILL and Lord FISHER, and
First Sea Lords with such diametrically opposite views
regarding publicity as Lord FISHER and Sir HENRY JACKsoN,
this was no small achievement. Thanks to the second
element he has written a book which scarcely contains
a dull page. Whether he is giving us a pen-picture of
Mr. CHURCHILL conducting Admiralty business from a sick-
bed, with his head swathed in flannel and an immense
cigar protruding from the bandage; or explaining how the
legend of Lord KITCHENER's survival arose from a trivial
error that caused the news of the Hampshire disaster to
reach Berlin a few minutes before it was published in
London, he always writes with directness and verve.
Admiral BRowNRIGG tells a good deal about the censor-
ship, and illustrates his theme with some excellent repro-
ductions of naval photographs before and after the Censor
had “re-touched” them. He tells us even more about his
work in a less familiar rôle, that of Publicity Agent to the
Silent Service. It was he who arranged visits to the Fleet
by more or less distinguished personagēs—“BRow NRIGG's
circus parties,” as they were dubbed in the gun-room—and
who engaged authors like Mr. KIPLING and artists like
Sir John LAVERY to describe and portray the doings of the
Fleet and its auxiliaries. It pains me to learn, however,
that “Passed by Censor” was only a guarantee for the
harmlessness and not for the veracity of the stories nar-
rated; and in particular that the famous “Q”-boat ruse
of the demented female with the explosive baby was a
pure work of imagination.
Without any special heralding, Mr. ERIC LEADBITTER
seems to have stepped into the front rank, perhaps even to
the leadership, of those active novelists whose theme is
English rural life. I emphasize the word “active,” with of
course a thought for the master of them all, the wizard of
Dorchester, at whose feet it would probably be fair to sup-
pose Mr. LEADBITTER to have learnt some at least of his
craft. His new story, Shepherd's Warning (ALLEN AND
UNwiN), is a quiet tale of life in a not specially attractive
village—a tale that conquers by its direct humanity and by
an art so delicate and so deftly concealed that the book
has a deceptive appearance of having written itself with-
out effort on the part of its author. It concerns a group of
peasants, agricultural labourers, inhabitants of Fidding, a
village gradually yielding to the encroachments by tram
and villa of the neighbouring town. The simple annals of

WHEN you refuse to sign the Peace
Except with various “reservations,"
And prophesy a swift decease -
Impinging on the League of Nations;
When you whose arms (we've understood)
Settled the War and wiped the Bosch out
Regard the whole world's brotherhood
As just a wash-out;
You say, in terms a little blunt,
“This scheme that you are advertising
Was all along a private stunt
Of WILsoN's singular devising;

Under a misty smile he masked it;
We never gave him leave to go

“And you, poor credulous Allies,
Found in this fellow, self-appointed,
The worth he had in his own eyes
And let him pose as God's anointed;
Taking no sort of pains to see
Whether or not he had a mandate,
Like puppy-dogs the other Three
Out of his hand ate.”

Or questioned his credentials, saying,
“Who is this WooD Row What's-his-name? -
And what's the rôle he thinks he's playing?

we ought to have one that will stand any test. Seventy

take such care of them. Think how careful she'd be with
the china. What's ‘trid.’ ” ”
“I’m afraid it must mean tired,” I said.
“Oh, she'd soon get rested here,” said Phyllis; “I don't
think that need be against her. She's probably been in a
hard place lately. Are there any more ?”
“Plenty,” I said. “How does this one strike you?—
‘General. no bacon. possess. 2 rms. £45 why. s.a.v.’”
“I like that one,” said Phyllis. “She must be an awfully
unselfish girl to go without bacon. I don't see how we are
going to spare two rooms, though, unless she's willing to
count the kitchen as one. Forty-five pounds a week must
be a printer's error. But we can easily afford forty-five
pounds a year.” : -
“It may mean that she's ‘weakly,' " I suggested.
“That wouldn't matter much,” said Phyllis; “and I like
her the better for being honest about it.” - -
“‘Wky.’ might stand for ‘whisky,’” I hinted darkly.
Phyllis blanched. “Then she's no good,” she said; “I
simply couldn't stand one that drinks. What's the next
one like 2''
I read on : “Domestic oil no risk. 6 dys, tra. s. hands

“I wonder whether that means that she can cook on an
oil-stove or that she can't cook on any other kind? And
..] does the “no risk' refer to her or the stove? It's not very
clear. I don't think we'll take up this one's references.
Besides I shouldn't like one that was tired for six days.”
“Out of every seven,” I added; “and the seventh day
would be the Sabbath, and her day off.”
“Go on to the next,” said Phyllis firmly.
The next one merely said; “General.
£40 1 rm. s.a.v.”
“It would be nice to have a taking sort of girl,” I
thought (unfortunately aloud).
“We won't think of her, the hussy' " said Phyllis. “Pass
me the paper, please.” -
“They all seem to want ‘s.a.v.,’” she said. “What do
you suppose it means? I wish they wouldn't use so many
abbreviations. ‘S.a. ' stands for Sunday afternoon, of
course, but I can't think what the ‘v.’ is for. Of course
we'll give them Sunday afternoons free, if that's what it
means. I only wonder they don't want an evening eff in
the week as well. I call them most reasonable. And there
are so many to choose from. I always understood from
mother that they're so hard to get.”
Then she turned the paper over.
“Oh, you are stupid!” she said. “You’ve been looking
at the ‘Shops and Businesses for Sale' column.”
“So 've you,” I snapped.
And then I regret to say we had our first quarrel.
I told Phyllis firmly that she is not at all tkg., nor would
she stand any test; that no one could engage her, much
less marry her, without taking risks; that she hadn't had
s. hands for yrs., that she wouldn't go without her bacon
for anyone, and that I should be jolly thankful if she would
take every blessed s.a.v.
I admit that Phyllis was more dignified. She merely
sailed out of the room, remarking that I made her tril.

To the Editor of “The Daily Mandate.”
SIR,-For a number of years I have
been experimenting in wireless tele-
phony with my installation on the
heights of Lavender Hill. On several
occasions recently I have been puzzled
by mysterious ringings of the bell
attached to the instrument, which have
obviously been set up by long-distance
waves. On taking up the receiver,
however, I have been unable to make
out any coherent message, but only
a succession of irregular squeaks, al-
though once I distinctly heard a word
which I can only transcribe as “Gurroo.”
I have no doubt in my own mind that
one of the more advanced planets is
trying to get in touch with us by means
of wireless telephony, and that once we
have deciphered the code we shall be
able to converse freely with its inhabi-
tants. I myself incline to the belief
which, in spite of its great distance
from the earth, is just as likely to wish
to communicate with us, as any other
planet. Yours faithfully,
DioGENEs DoTTLE, F.R.S.'
II.
Mr. Dottle's remarkable letter, pub-
lished in our issue of yesterday, sug-
gesting that inhabitants of Saturn have
been endeavouring to communicate
with the earth by means of wire-
less telephony, has created profound
excitement in scientific and other circles.
To a representative of The Daily Man-
date a number of well-known men
expressed their views on the matter,
which will undoubtedly stimulate fur-
ther investigation into the momentous
possibilities of this epoch-making reve-
lation. The opinions advanced, which
are, on the whole, highly favourable to
Mr. Dottle's theory, are as follows:—
Sir Potiphar Shucks, the famous
astronomer : “The possibility that
Saturn is inhabited is one that, in
the absence of incontrovertible evidence
aside. Assuming that it is inhabited,
that its people are skilled in the use of
wireless telephony and that it is pos-
sible to set up waves of sufficient in-
tensity to travel all the way from
Saturn to us, I see no reason why
communications of the nature sug-
gested by Mr. Dottle should not at
some future date become an accom-
plished fact.”
Mr. Artesian Pitts, the well-known
imaginative historian : “I have long
held the belief that Saturn is inhabited
by a type of being possessing a cylinder-
like body composed of an unresistin
pulp, a high dome-shaped head filled
with gas, and long tentacles, bristling
with electricity, through which all sen-
sations are emitted and received. These
tentacles would act as an ideal tele-
phonic apparatus, so that there is every
likelihood of Mr. Dottle's having actu-
ally received a message from Saturn.
I take ‘Gurroo’ to be Saturnian for
“Hello.’”

teresting theory, and for this purpose
are erecting a special installation on
the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, which is
several thousand feet higher than
Lavender Hill. At our own stations
we have frequently noticed mysterious
ringings, which we have hitherto as-
cribed to carelessness on the part of
operators; but Mr. Dottle's letter opens
up a new world of possibilities. The
Daily Mandate is to be congratulated
on the prominence it has given to the
subject, which has already had the
effect of sending Tromboni shares up
several points.”
Mr. G. Shawburn : “It is an insult
to Creation to assume that ours is the
only populated planet. Of course Saturn
is inhabited, but, unlike our own world,
by people of intelligence. In the matter
of mental advancement Saturn can
make rings round the earth. All the
same I don't for one moment suppose
that Mr. Dottle knows what he's talk-
ing about.”
The PostMastER-GENERAL: “Noth-
ing is known in the Department under
my control of telephone calls having
been received from Saturn or the neigh-
bourhood. I do not propose for the pre-
sent to take any steps in the matter.”

stupendous discovery, beside the poten-

pallid and uninspired commonplaces.
Even so cautious a scientist as Sir
Potiphar Shucks has declared that the
idea of Saturn being inhabited is one
that ‘should not lightly be set aside,'
and has announced his conviction
that under favourable conditions com-
munication with that planet should

thought and action, including Signor
Tromboni, are even more enthusiastic
in their reception of the great theory
first given to the world by Mr. Diogenes
Dottle in a letter to The Daily Mandate.
But the PostMASTER-GENERAL is con-
tent to treat the question with the airy
scepticism and obstructive complacency
that have rendered the London Tele-

A VERMIN OFFENSIVE.
THERE was a faint scuffling sound
behind the wainscot.
“There it is again,” said Araminta.
“Not a doubt of it,” I replied, turn-
ing pale.
Thrusting on my hat I rushed up the
hill to the Town Hall and asked to see
the Clerk of the Borough Council
immediately.
“I have reason to suspect,” I said in
a hoarse low whisper, as soon as I was
shown into the man's presence, “that
our premises are in imminent danger
of being infested. Counsel me as to
what I should do.”
“It is your duty as a good citizen to
take such steps as may from time to
time be necessary and reasonably prac-
ticable to destroy the vermin,” he said
in a rather weary and mechanical tone.
“I hope I am not one to take my
civic duties lightly,” I replied with
some hauteur, “but observe that I
merely said I had reason to suspect
the imminence of the peril. I should
like to know the legal definition of in-
festment, if you please. I cannot de-
finitely say that house-breaking has
taken place as yet. I do not know that
there has even been petty larceny.
There may have been merely loitering
with felonious intent.”
“What is the size of your premises?”
he inquired.
“It is more a messuage than a pre-
mises,” I explained. . “About twelve
feet by ten, I should say—speaking
without the lease.” * - -
“And how many vermin do you ex-
pect it to be about to harbour?”
“None have actually hove in sight
at present,” I said reassuringly, “but
there is a sound of one in the offing—
in the wainscoting, I mean.”
“In a residence of your size I should
say that a single mouse would consti-
tute infestation within the meaning of
the Act, so soon as it forces an ingress.
It will then be your bounden duty to
demolish it. How about purchasing a
trap 2"
“You are sure that is better than
hiding behind the arras and hitting it
over the head with a pole-axe 2.” I in-
quired anxiously, “ or proffering it a
bowl of poisoned wine 2"
“Poison is no longer supplied free,”
he answered coldly, and I went out.
Very luckily, as I hastened up the
hill, I had observed a building with the
words, “Job Masters. Traps for Hire,”
written upon a wooden board. I went
inside and found an elderly man sitting
at a desk in a small office. He looked
extremely patient. “Are you Job 2."
I asked breathlessly. “I have come
Appearances, of course, are quite
often deceptive. They were in this
case. The elderly man was very much
annoyed. When he had explained
matters forcibly to me I went on down
the hill and entered an ironmonger's.
“I wish to buy a trap to catch a
mouse,” I said to the assistant behind
the counter.
“Certainly, Sir.
the lad politely.
“Small to medium,” I replied, rather
baffled. “It has only a medium-sized
scratch.”
He showed me a peculiar apparatus
made of wire and wood containing
apparently a vestibule, two reception
rooms, staircase and first-floor lobby,
with an open window and a diving-
board. Underneath the window was
a small swimming tank.
“I don't want a hydropathic exactly,”
I explained. “I propose to exterminate
this rodent, not to foster longevity in
it. How does it work 2''
He pointed out that, after examin-
ing the various apartments, the animal
would be allured by the fragrance of
a small portion of cheese placed above
the diving - board; overbalancing, it
would then be projected into the water,
where it would infallibly drown. “It
is a thoroughly humane instrument,”
he assured me, “and used in the best
'omes.”
I bought it and went on to a cheese
foundry. Araminta was rather scornful
of the sanatorium when I came home
with it and set it, loaded and trained,
on the dining-room floor; but the child-
ren were delighted. It ranked only a
little lower than the pantomime, and if
only we could have secured an outside
visitor to it I believe that it would
have defeated the Zoo. To visit it with
a sort of wistful hope became the prin-
cipal treat of the day. But, alas, the
mansion remained untenanted. Some-
times during a lull in conversation we
would hear the faint scuffling again, but
after about six days I became convinced,
by kneeling down and placing my ear
to the carpet like an Indian, that the
noise was even fainter than it had been
at first. A terrible suspicion seized me.
I dashed out and rang the bell of the
flat next door.
“It is just as I feared,” I said to
Araminta on returning a few moments
later. “We are not going to be infested
after all. The vermin has been sighted
in No. 140B.”
“We must make the best of it,” she
said, trying to speak cheerfully, “though
it is hard on the children, poor dears.”
“I wasn't thinking of the children,”
I replied bitterly; “I was thinking of
the expense. If we had been living
What size 2 " said

rates.”
I sat down and made out a bill as
follows to the Clerk of the Borough
Council, heading it:-

,, Labour at 216 per hour . 0 74

The man replied coldly that the
householder was responsible for all
expenditure incurred in precaution-
ary measures and that the Council
was in no way liable for the costs
resulting from an offensive that failed
to materialize. He ended with the
rather rude postscript, “What kind
of cheese did you use?”
This was a bit sickening. However, by
threatening to lay information against
him, I have at last succeeded in inducing
the occupier of 140B to take over the
abattoir at a very satisfactory valuation.
It was between that and buying his

“I’ve seen rivetters at New York pie-

“but I never realised how monoton-
ous feeding could be till I got into a

Binnie puffed his pipe severely, being
of the tough fibre which enables Mess

had been silent, rose from his seat,

retreating figure. “Look to what a

“Not a bit of it,” answered Binnie
lightly. “Frederico could eat patent
breakfast food and toasted doormats
without taxing his digestion. His com-

Frederick, “there was a big war, which

“That's where I took the full count,”

“Instead of which,' she'd said Good-day

“Percival, old ace,” said Frederick,
with admiration, “you'll rank among

promptly. “There 's already been

“Then for your sakes I'll rehearse
the symptoms. But my curse will be
on your head if I get to the wrong
hospital.”
It was unfortunate that the M.O.
was in an unsympathetic mood next
morning. He thumped Frederick on
the lower chest and pooh-poohed the
idea of hospital. “All you want is a
few of these tablets,” he said, “and
you'll be fit as nails in a day or two.”
Frederick crawled away dispiritedly
to confide in Percival. That sapient
youth counselled perseverance.
“You must go right off your feed,”
he said. “Let the doc. see you feebly
pecking and he'll soon get alarmed.
In the meantime I’m off to give Binnie
critical accounts of your appetite and
send him to market right away.”
Only a burning passion and stealthy
bars of chocolate could have sustained
Frederick through the next few days.
To sit down to breakfast with a healthy
appetite and refuse his egg and rasher
put the biggest possible strain on his
constancy. His task was made doubly
difficult by the scheming of Percival,
who was constantly inciting Binnie to

said; “and there will be others going

There was no doubt who was the girl

THE BIG-GAME CURE.

For those wild lands where growls

And held a broken-hearted Bisley;

In any case to-day I shrink
From thus evading Sorrow's tram-

A sense of duty bids me think
How costly are the larger mammals;
To kill them just to soothe my mind
Would seem to savour of the wasteful,
A thing all patriot poets find
Exceedingly distasteful.
Not mine the immemorial cure;
The voice of conscience warns me
off it;

How TO ACT IN EMERGENCIES.
The Weekly Dispatch symposium, in
which various celebrities discuss the
way to act in the event of a burglar
being found in the house, shows the
need for a little advice in case of emer-
gencies. We append the following very
helpful hints:—
The old plan of offering a burglar a
cigarette and asking him to take a chair
whileyou telephone to the police is not
now so successful as in the past. The
best plan is to tackle the fellow right
away. For this purpose you should
step behind him, take hold of his coat
and force it over his face. Then tie
his left arm to his right leg across
the back. Properly carried out, this
method rarely fails.

PETER AND JUDY.
Except for the fact that they had
different sets of parents and were born
some hundred miles apart, Peter and
Judy are practically twins. Conse-
quently, after an interval of three
months, strenuous efforts were made
by the two young mothers to bring
about a proper introduction between
the two wonders.
The occasion was to be one of great
importance, for it was Judy's very first
tea-party, marking, as it were, the
dawn of her social career. For days
the post-office wrestled with the corre-
spondence necessary to bring about the
meeting. The mothers, both in person
and by proxy, had scoured the precincts
of Kensington and Oxford Street re-
spectively for the necessary adorn-
ments to do their offspring justice,
changing their minds so often that
the assistants came to take as much
interest in the party as if they were
going to it themselves.
And yet, when the great moment
arrived and the strong silent man was
borne into the room, round-eyed and
expectant, he found his hostess al-
ready tired out with her first tea-party
believe his eyes; nor could Judy's scan-
dalised father.
Peter was very good about it. He
bore this chilly reception stoically,
deprecating any desire to wake the
sleeping beauty—deprecating, in fact,
any interest in her or her cot whatso-
ever. Ignoring the efforts of the Big
People to fix his attention by pointing
him directly at the main object of the
tea-party (they should have known
that babies like looking the other way
always) he remained passively inter-
ested in a fascinating brass knob, the
while getting his gloves into a satisfac-
tory state of succulence before the Big
People should take it on themselves to
remove them.
At last his patience is rewarded. The
hostess, sighing sleepily, is beginning
to show signs of realising her respon-
sibilities. Two immense arms, two
enormous fistfuls of fingers gather her
up and she is borne through the air

Side by side they recline on the
couch. Judy, pouting with sleep, is
buffeting her face with her little white
boxing-gloves, while Peter stares fas-
cinated at the fire, quite sure that social
functions are not in his line. “O-o!”
With only three months' experience,
Judy has not yet attained complete
mastery of the art of manipulating
difficult things like limbs. Inadvert-
ently, and in excess of zeal to kick
higher than any other baby, she has
landed out a beautiful backhander and
caught Peter hard in the tummy.
Peter's eyes open wide. Creases appear
on his face and widen. A cavern opens
and a roar follows:—
“Ya—o-O !”
“Hullo!" (Judy looks up in amaze-
ment, for there is only one noise in the
house like that, and she has the sole
rights of it). “Hullo, is that me? I
didn't know I was doing it”—(the roars
from Peter continue)—“but I suppose I
am. I must be. Let's have a lot more
of this very good noise I am making—

and fast asleep. He could scarcely

The duet produces a crescendo as-
tounding to them both, for there has
never been á noise so wonderful as this
in all their experience. Then to Judy
a very strange thing happens. She
pauses for breath, but the noise goes
on. “This is amazing-how do I do
it? ..."
She joins in again—and then Peter
stops. He too is puzzled vaguely. How-
ever, bother introspection, the concert
proceeds, both artists doing their level
best. Now one of them pauses, now
the other, and at length serious doubts
begin to creep in. There is something
queer afoot-something .
The matter resolves itself. Turning
suddenly they behold each other, both
yelling splendidly. Amazement! Cavern
confronts eavern! Face to face they
roar their hardest, demanding the rea-
son for this strange phenomenon, "this
other me who does when I don't."
They pause - their mouths remain
agape. Slowly they close and smiles
succeed. Joy! A reasonable-sized face
at last. What a relief after the enor-
mous faces, the great mouths, the Cy-
ranese noses of the Big People who are
wont to come and peer. Here at last
is a true face, a face that - no, they
both agree not to dwell unduly on the
discovery.

couch. Judy, pouting with sleep, is
buffeting her face with her little white
boxing-gloves, while Peter stares fas-
cinated at the fire, quite sure that social
functions are not in his line. “O-o!”
With only three months' experience,
Judy has not yet attained complete
mastery of the art of manipulating
difficult things like limbs. Inadvert-
ently, and in excess of zeal to kick
higher than any other baby, she has
landed out a beautiful backhander and
caught Peter hard in the tummy.
Peter's eyes open wide. Creases appear
on his face and widen. A cavern opens
and a roar follows:—
“Ya—o-o l’’
“Hullo!” (Judy looks up in amaze-
ment, for there is only one noise in the
house like that, and she has the sole
rights of it). “Hullo, is that me? I
didn't know I was doing it.”—(the roars
from Peter continue)—“but I suppose I
am. I must be. Let's have a lot more
of this very good noise I am making—

and fast asleep. He could scarcely

The duet produces a crescendo as-
tounding to them both, for there has
never been a noise so wonderful as this
in all their experience. Then to Judy
a very strange thing happens. She
pauses for breath, but the noise goes
on. “This is amazing—how do I do
it? . . .”
She joins in again—and then Peter
stops. He too is puzzled vaguely. How-
ever, bother introspection, the concert
proceeds, both artists doing their level
best. Now one of them pauses, now
the other, and at length serious doubts
begin to creep in. There is something
queer afoot—something . . .
The matter resolves itself. Turning
suddenly they behold each other, both
yellingsplendidly. Amazement! Cavern
confronts eavern! Face to face they
roar their hardest, demanding the rea-
son for this strange phenomenon, “this
other me who does when I don't.”
They pause—their mouths remain
agape. Slowly they close and smiles
succeed. Joy! A reasonable-sized face
at last. What a relief after the enor-
mous faces, the great mouths, the Cy-
ranese noses of the Big People who are
wont to come and peer. Here at last
is a true face, a face that — no, they
both agree not to dwell unduly on the
discovery.
Indifferent to each other once again
they regard the special objects of their
attention, their hands waving gently in
the air, seeking the fairies that babies'
hands are always trying to catch.
Ha! their hands have met.
“Hoo! It's a reasonable hand. It's
got proper fingers, not stumps of
bananas.”
“Moreover,” says Peter politely, “if
you care to take advantage of my offer
you will find that it is properly mois-
tened, succulent and suitable to a baby's
taste. You needn't mind; I prepared
it myself.”
“Goo! Gool-gur!” All is peace and
chuckles. Hand-in-hand they survey
their mothers. “Our mothers, yours—
mine. Ha, ha—he, he-goo!”
The inner thoughts of the two babies
may be hidden from me (I accept the
punishment), but I know — I know
what the two mothers are thinking of.

AT THE PLAY.
“MR. ToDD's ExPERIMENT.”
A NEw terror—or else a new attrac-
tion—has been added to the British
Drama. Mr. WALTER HACKETT has
brought the scent of the cinema across
the footlights. When he wants to
inform you of certain episodes in the
hero's past career, or let you know
what he is doing when he is out of
sight, he throws the main stage into
darkness and lights up a smaller one
on which he gives you as many as six
little tabloid plays within the play.
Such a scheme has its obvious con-
veniences for the playwright, and should
greatly simplify the difficulties of stage-
craft. Those introductory statements
which are required to explain the open-
ing conditions and need such adroit
handling will no longer be necessary.
You just put everybody wise by a
series of tableaua parlants. No longer
need the author worry about the best
way of conveying to his audience the
details of any action that takes place
off the stage; he just turns on a play-
let and there it is. Altogether, with a
couple of the unities disposed of, he
ought to have a much easier time.
On the other hand he is going to
have trouble with his principal stage
and put his actors to the inconvenience
of playing in a painfully congested
area. Thus, in Mr. Todd's Earperiment,
the permanent scene was the hall of a
house, with a large tapestry occupying
more than half of the wall. Lurking
behind this tapestry was the stage for
the tabloids, and the general company
had to crowd themselves into the re-
mainder or wander forlornly about in
the space in front of the tapestry.
The playlets again are almost bound
to be just concentrated episodes, pro-
bably elemental in theme and certainly
elementary in treatment.
The excuses for their interpolation in
Mr. Todd's Experiment were not marked
by a very great subtlety. There was
really none for the first three, which
simply relieved Mr. Todd of the te-
dious recital of the hero's disillusion-
ments in love. The next two were
introduced by way of illustrating his
alleged gift of clairvoyance; and the
last served frankly to fill in the inter-
val while the rest of the company was
away at dinner. The general effect of
all these desultory little Guignols was
perhaps rather cheap, and not very com-
plimentary to the intelligence of those
of us who had outgrown a childish
penchant for peep-shows.
Mr. Todd's Erperiment (for I have
spoken only of Mr. HACKETT's) was to
restore a blasé and valetudinarian
of energy by recalling the memories
of his past loves and so reviving in
him a desire to stand well in the eyes
of the sex. For this purpose he pro-
duces (1) a bunch of wood-violets to
suggest (through the nose) the environ-
ment of his first passion; (2) a specially-
tipped brand of cigarettes to revive
(through the mouth) the sentiment of
his second; and a gramophone record
to recover (through the ear) the asso-
ciations of his third. .
So well does he succeed that the hero
pulls himself together, shaves off his
beard, becomes our Owen NAREs again,
and sallies forth, habited for conquest,
to pay calls on all the three. From all
'illoughby Todd (Mr. Hot Max Clark).
“BE. YoUR old TRUE self. MAKE THE
WOMEN ADORE YOU...”

“You R ADVICE Is Good. I will. Now TARE
OFF MY BEARD AND BE Owen NAREs oxCE
MORE.”
the three he retires disillusioned, having
found them as egoistic as himself, and
in the end finds solace rather shame-
lessly, in the love of a devoted slave
who might have been his for the taking
any time in the last several years.
The matter was pleasant enough, but
its interest must, I think, have left us
indifferent if it had not been for the di-
version afforded by the playlets. While
the idea was original, the presenta-
tion of it seemed to have a touch of
amateurishness, though I would not go
so far as to agree with the old fogey,
played by Mr. FRED KERR, who pro-
nounced the scheme to be “all Tommy
rot.” With the exception of one char-
acter—the devoted slave—the lightness
of the dialogue, mildly cynical, was due
not so much to its wit as to the absence
of ponderable stuff. The easy trick, so
of letting the audience down in the
middle of a serious situation was illus-
trated by the hero when, being in deadly
earnest, he tells every woman in turn
that she is the only woman he has ever
loved.
As Mr. Todd, Mr. HolMAN CLARK was
as fresh as he always is; but Mr. Owen
NAREs could hardly hope to satisfy the
exigent demands of adoration in the
part of young Carrington. Who, indeed,
could sustain his reputation as a figure
of romance when addressed as “Arthur-
John ”2 Mr. FRED KERR, who played
Martin Carrington, the cantankerous
uncle, cannot help being workmanlike;
but he was asked to repeat himself too
much. The best performance was that
of Miss. MARION LORNE, in the part
of the hero's one devout lover, Fancy
Phipps ; her quiet sense of humour,
salted with a slight American tang, kept
the whole play together. O. S.
“TEA For THREE.”
Playwright Mr. Ro1 CoopFR-MEGRUE,
and principal players Miss FAY COMP-
ToN, the wife; Mr. STANLEY LOGAN, the
friend, and Mr. A. E. MATTHEws, the
husband, made a first-rate thing of
two-thirds of Tea for Three.
The wife is without blemish phy-
sically or morally. The husband is
faithful with a single-minded fidelity
in thought, word and deed that looks
(and, I am assured by equally innocent
victims, is) positively deadly. The
friend “frits and flutters” about in a
distinctly casual, not to say poly-
gamous, mood, but has one sacred
place in his untidy heart in which the
wife is enshrined. He can manage
to sustain life so long as he may come
to triangular tea on Thursdays. But
the faithful husband puts his foot on
that. . -
Hence the stolen lunch for two with
which the play opens. Philosophy there
is, and very good philosophy too, from
the flutterer and fritter, and such love-
making as every virtuous woman (at
heart a minx) allows. She is sorry,
doubtless, for the suffering she causes,
but (this is my #". not, I think, the
author's) is really enjoying it like any-
thing and taking jolly good care to look
her best. Then follow little lies and
as little and as needless and quite in-
nocent indiscretions; and the jealous
husband on the rampage.
All this excellently put together,
seasoned with wisdom and wit and
most capably played; Miss FAY COMP-
ToN, admirable example of a pretty
actress who won't let herself be cap-
tured by stage tricks, making every-
thing explicable except her continued
love for her intolerable bore (and Turk)

handling a desperately unsympathetic
part, which was already beginning to
look impossible, with great adroitness;
and Mr. STANLEY LoGAN, though badly
hampered by a shocking cold and
fighting a coughing audience, carrying
the bulk of the good talk and lifting it
gently over the few difficult places with
a brilliant and well-concealed art.
Thus till towards the end of the
Second Act. Then a bad, a very bad,
fairy stuffed into Mr. MEGRUE's head'
the idea of the suicide lottery. The in-
furiated husband, finding his wife in
her friend's room at 7 P.M. (fright-
fully improper hour), sternly offers his
bowler (or Derby) hat, in which are two
cards. The one marked with a cross
is drawn by the flutterer and means
| that he is for it. He is to kill himself
within twenty-four hours . . . And
all this with perfect seriousness.
You will see how the Third Act of a
comedy which had tied itself in this kind
of a knot simply could not be played.
The author had completely sacrificed
plausibility, and it: was not uninterest-
ing to see him twisting and turning,
hedging and bluffing to save it; and a
little uncomfortable to note the convic-
tion oozing away out of the performers.
Queer also that it isn't more

we possibly render justice to the

REVOLT OF THE SUPER-GEORGIANS.
WILD. Sces Es AT A MEETING OF
PROTEST.
AN Indignation Meeting, to protest
against the outrageous attacks levelled
against Georgian writers and critics by
Professor Noyes in his recent lecture at
the Royal Institution and by Mr. A. D.
GoDLEY in an article in the current
Nineteenth Century, was held last
Saturday evening at the Klaxon Hall.
The chair was taken by Mr. Edward
MARSH, C.M.G., who was supported on
the platform by a compact bevy of
Georgian bards; but at an early stage
of the meeting it became apparent that
a majority of those present in the body
of the hall were extremists of violent
type, and eventually, as will be seen,
the proceedings ended in something
approximating to a free fight.
Mr. MARSH began by a frank confes-
sion. He had taken a First Class in
the Cambridge Classical Tripos. But
the days in which he had been steeped
to the lips in Latin and Greek were
long past, never to return. For many
years he had not composed hexameters,
elegiacs or iambics. He had thrown
in his lot with insurgent youth, not as
a competitor or rival, but as an advo-
cate, an admirer and an adviser. Indeed,
if he might venture to say so, he some.
times acted as a brake on the wheels
of the triumphal Chariot of Free Verse.
He was not an adherent of the fantas-
tic movement known as “Dada.” He
had no desire to abolish the family,
morality, logic, memory, archaeology,
the law and the prophets. A little
madness was a splendid thing, but it
must be methodic. Still, for the rest
he was a Georgian, heart and soul, and
it pained him when men who ought to
know better raised the standard of re-
action and sought to discredit the
achievements of his protégés. These
attacks could not be passed over in
silence, and the meeting had been con-
vened to consider how they should be
met, whether by a reasoned protest or
by retaliation. .
Miss Messalina Stoot, who punctuated
her remarks with the clashing of a pair
of cymbals, observed that as a thorough.
going Dadaist she had no sympathy
with the half-hearted attitude of the
Chairman. It was a battle between
Dada and Gaga, and emphatically Dada
must win.
Mr. Mimram Stoot, who accompanied
himself on the sarrusophone, endorsed
the iconoclastic views of his sister.
The only poetry that counted was that
which caused spinal chills and issued
from husky haughty lips. The moan-
ings of mediaeval molluscs were of no
crustacean fossils of Oxford, the home
of lost causes.
Mr. Seumas O'Gambhaoil wished to
protest against Mr. Noy Es' statement
that there were ten thousand Bol-
shevist poets in our midst. This was
a shameless underestimate of the total,
which was at least twice that figure.
Mr. God LEY's offence, however, was
much worse, as he was an Irishman,
though of the self-expatriated type to
which GoLDSMITH and Moore belonged.
The rest of Mr. O'Gambhaoil's speech
was delivered in Irish, but he was
understood to advocate a repatriation
of all Irish renegades to be tried and
dealt with by the Sinn Fein Republic.
Mr. Caradoc Cramp applauded the
sentiments of the last speaker, but con-
sidered that he avoided the real issue.
The Chairman had declared himself a
Georgian, but that was not enough.
The worst enemies of Free Verse were
to be found in that camp. In technique
and even in thought there was little to
choose between many so-called Georg-
ians and the most effete and reaction-
ary Victorians. He alluded to the War
poets, or rather the “Duration "poets,
most of whom were already back-
numbers. Between these and the Post-
war poets, the true super-Georgians or
paulo-post-Georgians, it was necessary
to make a clean cut. To protest against
Messrs. GoDLEY and Noyes was a mere
waste of time and energy. They might
just as well protest against the exist-
ence of an extinct volcano or the
skeleton of the brontosaurus. The real
danger to be faced was the intrinsic
subjectivity of the early and mid-
Georgian poets, of whom the Chairman
had been so powerful and consistent a
supporter. He accordingly called for
volunteers to storm the platform, and,
a large number having responded to
his appeal, Mr. MARSH was dislodged
from the Chair after a gallant fight.
A resolution of adherence to the prin-
ciples of “Dada” having been passed by
a large majority, the meeting broke up
to the strains of the famous song—

Dancing Man (at Galleries of New Primitive Art Society). “ONE would HAve. THOUGHT, witH such A Good FLook, THEY MIGHT
HAVE PUT UP SOME BETTER PICTURES.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FoELowING the iconoclastic spirit of the age, Mr. BARRY
PAIN has essayed in The Death of Maurice (SKEFFINGTON)
the revolutionary experiment of a murder mystery tale that
does not contain (a) a love interest, (b) a wrongly suspected
hero, (c) a baffled inspector, (d) an amateur, but inspired,
detective. It would be a grateful task to add that the
result proves the superfluity of these time-worn accessories.
But the cold fact is that, to me at least, the proof went
the other way. From the first I was painfully aware of
a lack of snap about the whole business, and I am more
than suspicious that the author himself may have shared
my unwilling indifference. Maurice was an artistic bach-
elor, a landowner, a manufacturer of jam, a twin (with
a bogie gift of knowing at any moment the relative posi-
tion of his other half, which might have been worked
for far more effect than is actually obtained from it), and
a reputation of making enemies. He had also an unusual
neighbour, in the person of a young woman whose un-
conventionality led her to perambulate the common at
midnight, playing the first bars of Solveig's Song upon the
flute. One night, at the close of the first chapter, a gun
was heard. But you are wrong to suppose (however
naturally) that the flute-player was the victim. It was
Maurice. And of course the problem was, who did it. I
have told you my own experience of the working out ;
just as no story starting with a mysterious murder can lack
a certain intrigue; but the fact remains that my wish,
heroically resisted, to look on to the last chapter was
prompted more often by impatience than by any compelling
curiosity. Others may be happier.
The author of A Journal of Small Things has done much
to make us understand the sufferings of stricken France and
the more intimate sorrows of war. Chill Hours (MELROSE)
deals with that dark period before the end, when, to some,
it seemed all but certain that the will to victory must fail.
Of the three parts of this gracious little book the first con-
sists of six sketches of life behind the lines, life both gentle
and simple, as affected by war. “Odette in Pink Taffeta,”
an episode of bereavement, is in particular exquisitely vis-
ualised. “Their Places” and “The Second Hay” treat,
with a quiet intensity of conviction, of the absolutely deaden-
ing absorption, by overwork and anxiety, of peasant wives
and children left to carry on in the absence of their men.
The third part is a series of hospital vignettes. They do
not attempt to be too cheery, but they have the stamp of
realised truth. “Nostalgia,” the second part, is in another
mood—recalled memories of the beauties of a loved land
and of dear common things affectionately seen. To those
who dare look at war with open eyes and who take plea-
sure in sincere and beautifully-phrased writing I commend
Mrs. HELEN MACKAY's book without reserve.

what embarrassing to a reviewer, for it has the theme of a
great book with the manner of a trivial one. It is the
history of a very much smaller nation, Ethuria, left de-
spoiled and starving at the end of a nine-years' war, in which
its great neighbours have used it as a battle-ground.
Revolution begins, but a woman prophet steps in and
switches it off in an unusual direction. The Ethurians
perfect among themselves that fellowship which is the
nice ideal behind many nasty manifestations in the real
world, and, when next they are invaded by neighbouring
nations anxious to use them as an excuse for belligerency,
number of Germans in it. Finally, after telling us, some-
times engagingly, sometimes verbosely, all he can remember
about Lancashire, Mr. AGATE brings his hero to Town,
levers him along, year after year, and gets (almost on his
last page) to his big situation. I won't spoil it. Respon-
sibility, which might better have been called “Garrulity,”
is a novel containing boredom and charm in about equal
proportions; not to mention promise for the days when its
author has learned to discipline his too-ready pen.
From the early part of 1915 until the end of 1917 Admiral
they resolutely stick to
their guns (only the meta-
phor is most unsuitable),
refuse to find any cause
of quarrel with their
“foreign brothers,” and
finally persuade them to
abandon the ideals of war,
so that peace on earth
becomes a reality at last.
Here is the book's theme ;
its working out allows for
a boxing match between
the President of Hygeia
and the Foreign Secretary
of Tritonia as the mini-
mum of hostilities; a
wicked newspaper lord,
who pulls strings in both
countries, and a faithful
butler to the Royal Family,
who becomes assistant
state nursemaid and cleans
silver as a hobby. Though
I quite agree with Miss
Evelyn SHARP and the
Ethurians that it is love |||}|
that makes the world go
round, I am not so sure
that either hers or theirs is ||
the best way of advocating ||
their common cause.

what embarrassing to a reviewer, for it has the theme of a
great book with the manner of a trivial one. It is the
history of a very much smaller nation, Ethuria, left de-
spoiled and starving at the end of a nine-years' war, in which
its great neighbours have used it as a battle-ground.
Revolution begins, but a woman prophet steps in and
switches it off in an unusual direction. The Ethurians
perfect among themselves that fellowship which is the
nice ideal behind many nasty manifestations in the real
world, and, when next they are invaded by neighbouring
nations anxious to use them as an excuse for belligerency,
number of Germans in it. Finally, after telling us, some-
times engagingly, sometimes verbosely, all he can remember
about Lancashire, Mr. AGATE brings his hero to Town,
levers him along, year after year, and gets (almost on his
last page) to his big situation. I won't spoil it. Respon-
sibility, which might better have been called “Garrulity,”
is a novel containing boredom and charm in about equal
proportions; not to mention promise for the days when its
author has learned to discipline his too-ready pen.
From the early part of 1915 until the end of 1917 Admiral
they resolutely stick to

phor is most unsuitable),
refuse to find any cause

“foreign brothers,” and
finally persuade them to

A SELFLESS PARTY.
[“They (the electorate) know that we (the Labour Party) are not,
and never will be, merely concerned in the interests of one particular
class.”—Mr. Thomas in “The Sunday Times.”
“Nationalization was proposed not to gain increased wages for
workers, but in the national interest. . . . They were prepared to
produce to the last ounce of their capacity to give to the nation and
to humanity all the coal they required. If he thought that this
scheme was intended to or would give the miners an advantage at the
expense of the State he would oppose it.”—Mr. BRACE, in the House
of Commons.] . . . . . . . . .
Though Comrade SMILLIE keeps a private passion
That yearns to see Sinn Fein upon its own,
Clearly we cannot put our Unions' cash on .
Men with a motto like “OURSELVEs ALONE ;”
To us all folk are brothers s
And on our bunting runs the rede, “For OTHERs.”
Our hearts are ever with the poor consumer;
We long to give his sky a touch of blue;
To doubt this fact is to commit a bloomer,
To falsify our record, misconstrue -
The ends we struggle for,
As illustrated in the recent War.
We struck from time to time, but not at Caesar,
Not to secure the highest pay we could ; -
Our loyalty kept gushing like a geyser;
We had for single aim the common good;
Who treads the path of duty
May well ignore the cry of “Et tu, Brute '"
Humanity's the cause for which we labour;
The hope that spurs us on to do our best
Is “O that I may truly serve my neighbour,
And prove the love that burns within my breast,
And save his precious soul
By a reduction in the cost of coal!”
Nationalize the mines, and there will follow
More zeal (if possible) in him that delves;
Our eager altruists will simply wallow
In work pursued for others (not themselves),
Thrilled with the noble thought—
“My Country's all to me and Class is naught !”
A STORY WITH A POINT.
(With Mr. Punch's apologies for not having sent it on to
“The Spectator.”)
Geoffrey has an Irish terrier that he swears by. I don't
mean by this that he invokes it when he becomes por-
tentous, but he is always annoying me with tales, usually
untruthful, of the wonderful things this dog has done.
Now I have a pointer, Leopold, who really is a mar-
vellous animal, and I work off tales of his doings on Geoffrey
when he is more than usually unbearable. - -
Until a day or two ago we were about level.
Although Geoffrey knows far more dog stories than I
do, and has what must be a unique memory, I have a very
fair power of invention, and by working this gift to its
utmost capacity I have usually been able to keep pace
with him. -
As I said, the score up to a few days ago was about even ;
yesterday, however, was a red-letter day and I scored an
overwhelming victory. Bear with me while I tell you the
whole story. -
I was struggling through the porridge of a late breakfast
when Geoffrey strolled in. I gave him a cigarette and went
of way and I could see he was thinking out an ending for
his latest lie. I was well away with the toast and marma-
lade when he started.
d “You know that dog of mine, Rupert? Well, yester-
ay—” - -
I let him talk; I could afford to be generous this morn-
ing. He had hashed up an old story of how this regrettable
hound of his had saved the household from being burnt to
death in their beds the night before.
I did not listen very attentively, but I gathered it had
smelt smoke, and, going into the dining-room, had found
the place on fire and had promptly gone round to the police-
station. . . . . - *
When he had finished I got up and lit a pipe.
“Not one of your best, Geoffrey, I'm afraid—not so
good, for instance, as that one about the coastguard and
the sea-gulls; still, I could see you were trying. Now I'll
tell you about Leopold's extraordinary acuteness yesterday
afternoon. -
“We—he and I-were out on the parade, taking a little
gentle after-luncheon exercise, when I saw him suddenly
stop and start to point at a man sitting on one of the
benches a hundred yards in front of us; but not in his
usual rigid fashion; he seemed to be puzzled and uncertain
whether, after all, he wasn't making a mistake.”
Here Geoffrey was unable to contain himself, as I knew
he would be.
“Lord! That chestnut ! You went and asked the man
his name and he told you that it was Partridge.”
“No,” I said, “you are wrong, Geoffrey; his name, on
inquiry, proved to be Quail. But that was only half the
problem solved. Why, I thought, should Leopold have
been so puzzled 2 And then an idea struck me. I went
back to the man on the bench and, with renewed apologies,
asked him if he would mind telling me how he spelt his
name. He put his hand into his pocket and produced a
card. On it was engraved, “J. M. QUAYLE.' Then I under-
stood. It was the spelling that puzzled Leopold.”
THE NEW APPEAL.
WE observe with interest the latest development in the
London Press—the appearance of the new Labour journal,
The Daily Nail.
In the past, attempts to found a daily newspaper for the
propagation of Labour views have not always met with
success. Possibly the fault has been that they made their
appeal too exclusively to the Labour public. We under-
stand that every care will be taken that our contemporary
shall under no circumstances be a financial failure.
The Daily Nail is a bright little sheet, giving well-selected
news, popular “magazine” and “home” features, and, on
the back page, a number of pictures. It has a strong
financial section, a well-informed Society column, and a
catholic and plentiful display of advertisements, including
announcements of many of those costly luxuries which
Labour to-day is able to afford. -
While in its editorial comments it suggests emphatically
that the Government of the day is not and never can be
satisfactory, it refrains from embarrassing our statesmen
with too many concrete proposals for alternative methods.
We learn that the new Labour daily is substantially
backed by a nobleman of pronounced democratic ideals.
From his Lordship down to the humblest employee there
exists among the staff a beautiful spirit of fellowship un-
marked by social distinction.
“Good morning, comrade,” is the daily greeting of his
Lordship to the lift-boy, who replies with the same greeting,
on eating. He wandered round the room in a restless sort
untarnished by servility.

THE INSOMNIAC.
Miss Brown announced her intention
of retiring to roost. Not that she was
likely to sleep a blink, she said; but she
thought all early-Victorian old ladies
should act accordingly.
She asked Aunt Angela what she took
for her insomnia. Aunt Angela said she
fed it exclusively on bromides. Edward
said he gave his veronal and ScHoPEN-
HAUER, five grains of the former or a
chapter of the latter.
They prattled of the dietary and idio-
syncrasies of their several insomnias
as though they had been so many
exacting pet animals. Miss Brown then
asked me what I did for mine.
Edward spluttered merrily. “He rises
with the nightingale, comes bounding
downstairs sometime after teaand wants
to know why breakfast isn't ready.
Only last week I heard him exhorting
Harriet to call him early next day as
he was going to a dance.”
They all looked reproachfully at me
because I didn't keep a pet insomnia
too. I spoke up for myself. I admitted
I hadn't got one, and what was more
thinkers are heavy sleepers, I insisted.
They must sleep heavily to recuperate
the enormous amount of vitality ex-
pended by them in their waking hours.
Sleep, I informed my audience, is
Nature's reward to the blameless and
energetic liver. If they could not sleep
now they were but paying for past
years of idleness and excess, and they
had only themselves to blame. I was
going on to tell them that an easy con-
science is the best anodyne, etc., but
they snatched up their candles and
went to bed. I went thither myself
shortly afterwards.
I was awakened in the dead of night
by a rapping at my door.
“Who's there?” I growled.
“I—Jane Brown,” said a hollow
voice.
“What's the matter 2''
“Hush, there are men in the house.”
“If they're burglars tell 'em the
silver's in the sideboard.”
“It's the police.”
I sat up in bed.
why?—what?”
“Shissh! come quickly and don't

slippers and joined the lady on the
landing. She carried a candle and was
adequately if somewhat grotesquely
clad in a dressing-gown and an eider-
down quilt secured about her waist by
a knotted bath-towel. On her head she
wore a large black hat. She put her
finger to her lips and led the way
downstairs. The hall was empty.
“That's curious,” said Miss Brown.
“There were eighteen mounted police-
men in here just now. I was talking
to the Inspector—such a nice young
man, an intimate friend of the late Sir
CHRistoph ER WREN, who, he informs
me privately, did not kill Cock Robin.”
She paused, winked and then sud-
denly dealt me three hearty smacks—
one on the shoulder, one on the arm
and one in the small of the back. I
removed myself hastily out of range.
“Tarantulas, or Peruvian ant-bears,
crawling all over you,” Miss Brown ex-
plained. “Fortunate I saw them in
time, as their suck is fatal in ninety-
nine cases out of a million, or so GAR1-
BALDI says in the Origin of Species.”
She sniffed. “Tell me, do you smell

“I do,” she said, “quite close at
hand too. Yum-yum, I like warm
blood.” She looked at me through
half-closed eyelids. “I should think
you'd bleed very prettily, very prettily.”
I removed myself still further out of
range, assuring her that in spite of my
complexion I was in reality anaemic.
She pointed a finger at me. “I know
where those policemen are. They're
in the garden digging for the body.”
“What body?'' I gasped.
“Why, EINSTEIN's, of course,” said
Miss Brown. “Edward murdered him
last night for his theory. Didn't you
suspect 2"
I confessed that I had not.
“Oh, yes,” she said; “smothered
him with a pen-wiper. I saw him do
it, but I said nothing for Angela's sake,
she's so refined.”
She darted from me into the drawing-
room. I followed and found her stand-
ing before the fireplace waving the
candle wildly in one hand, a poker in
the other and sniffing loudly.
“We must save Edward,” she said;
“we must find the body and hide it
before they can bring in a writ of
Habeas Corpus. It is here. I can smell
blood. Look under the sofa.”
She made a flourish at me with her
weapon and I at once dived under the
sofa. I am a brave man, but I know
better than to withstand people in Miss
Brown's state of mind.
“Is it there?” she inquired.
“ No.”
“Then search under the carpet—
quickly "
She swung the poker round her head
and I searched quickly under the carpet.
During the next hour, at the dictates
of her and her poker, I burrowed under
a score of carpets, swarmed numerous
book-cases, explored a host of cup-
boards, dived under a multitude of
furniture and even climbed into the
open chimney-place of the study, be-

MARDI GRAS.
(With the British Army in France.)
“HAve you reflected, mon chou,” said
M'sieur Bonneton, complacently regard-
ing the green carnations on his carpet:
slippers, “that to - morrow is Mardi
Gras 2"
“I have,” replied Madame shortly.
“One may expect then, ma petite,
that there will be crêpes for dinner 2"
“With eggs at twelve francs the
dozen 2" said Madame decidedly. “One
may not." ' -
On any other matter M'sieur would
probably have taken his wife's decision
as final, but he had a consuming passion
for crêpes, and was moreover a diplomat.
“La vie chère 1" he said sadly; “it
cuts at the very vitals of hospitality.
With what pleasure I could have pre-
sented myself to our amiable neigh-
bours, the Sergeant-Major Coghlan and
his estimable wife, and said, ‘It is the
custom in France for all the world to
eat crépes on Mardi Gras. Accept these,
then, made by Madame Bonneton her-
self, who in the making of this national
delicacy is an incomparable artist.’
But when eggs are twelve francs the
dozen "–he shook his head gloomily—
“generous sentiments must perish.”.
Madame perceptibly softened.
“Perhaps, after all, I might persuade
that miser Dobelle to sell me a few at
ten francs the dozen,” she murmured;
and M'sieur knew that diplomacy had
won another notable victory.
Curiously enough, at this precise
moment the tenants of the premier
6tage of 10 bis, rue de la République,
were also engaged in a gastronomic
discussion.
“If almanacs in France count as they
do in Aldershot,” said Mrs. Coghlan,
“to-morrow will be Shrove Tuesday.”
“An' what av it 2" demanded Ser-
geant-Major Coghlan of the Britis
Army. -
“What of it? As though ye'd not
been dreaming of pancakes this fort-
night an' more past—fearful to mention
thim an' fearful lest I should forget.
Well, well, if ye’ll bring a good flour
ration in the marning I'll do me best.”
“I've been thinking, Peggy lass,”
said the gratified Sergeant-Major, “it
wud be the polite thing to make a few
for thim dacent people on the ground-
flure. I'll wager they've niver seen
th' taste av’ a pancake in this country.”
Thus it was that when Hippolyte
Larivière, the cornet - player of the
Palais de Cinéma, ascended the stairs
to his eerie on the top-floor of 10 bis the
following evening the appetising odour
of frying batter enveloped him as a
garment. He sniffed appreciatively.
freely without considering the effect on
his temperament,” he said. “One some-
times regrets the demands of Art.”
Outside the Coghlans' door another
idea struck him. “The essence of a
present lies not in its value but its
appropriateness. A few crépes on Mardi
Gras would be a novel acknowledgment
to the Sergeant-Major of his liberality
in the way of cigarettes. At present
my case is empty.” . º -
Retracing his steps he went to the
Café aux Gourmets and persuaded the
propriétaire to prepare half-a-dozen
crêpes with all possible speed and send
them piping-hot to his room in ex-
change for a promise of his influence
in getting her on the free list of the
Cinema. Then, in a glow of virtue, he
returned to prepare his toilette for the
evening performance.
It was while Hippolyte was dabbing
his cheeks with a damp towel that
M'sieur Bonneton and Sergeant-Major
Coghlan, having comfortably satisfied
their respective appetites with crêpes
and pancakes, proceeded to call upon
each other, bearing gifts. The dignity of
the presentations was impaired by the
fact that they almost collided on the
stairs.
“Mrs. Coghlan wud like your opinion
on these pancakes,” said the Sergeant-
Major, dexterously fielding one that
was sliding from the plate. -
“And permit me to beg your accept-
ance of these crêpes, a dish peculiar
to France and eaten as a matter of
custom on Mardi Gras,” said M'sieur
in his most correct English, producing
his plate with a flourish worthy of a
head-waiter.
“'Tis with all the pleasure in life
we'll be tasting thim—” commenced
Coghlan. Then his eye fell on the
dish and his voice dropped. M'sieur
was also showing signs of embarrass-
ment. -
“It seems crépes is but another name
for pancakes,” said the Sergeant-Major
heavily, after a pause.
“But yes—and I am already filled
to repletion.” -
“We've aiten our fill too, Peggy an'
me, an' they 're spoilt whin they're
cowld. It's severely disappointed
Peggy will be to find thim wasted.”
“And Madame will be desolated to
despair.”
They stared blankly at each other
for a few minutes. Then M'sieur took
a heroic resolve.
“We must not hurt the feelings of
those excellent women,” he said firmly.
“There is but one course open to us.”
Coghlan nodded assent. Solemnly
and without enthusiasm they sat on
the stairs and consumed the pancakes
and breathing hard, they took their
empty plates and entered their respec-
tive flats.
A few minutes later they again en-
countered on the stairs. Once more
they were laden with comestibles.
“For Monsieur Larivière,” explained
M'sieur. “Madame insisted. She has
a heart of gold, that woman.”
“Peggy's sending these up too,” said
the Sergeant-Major. “I towld her thim
pancakes was the greatest surprise you
iver tasted.”
M'sieur nodded. In response to Hip-
polyte's invitation they entered the
room, and M'sieur took command of
the conversation. The Sergeant-Major
stood stiffly to attention, feeling that
the occasion demanded it.
“Two little gifts,” said M'sieur, “of
epicurean distinction. The crêpes of
Madame Bonneton are an achievement,
but the pancakes of Madame Coghlan
are irresistible.”
“I thank you from the recesses of
my heart,” said Hippolyte with emo-
tion ; “but—you understand me—as
the slave of Art I am compelled to forgo
such pleasures.”
“My friend,” said M'sieur sternly,
“to refuse them would be an affront to
the cooking of these excellent ladies.
A true housewife esteems her cooking
only next to her virtue. You must eat
them—while they are hot.”
“But my tremolo—my sostenuto will
be ruined,” said Hippolyte wildly.
“What is your tremolo to a woman's
tears ?” said M'sieur, with an elegance
born of a fear that he might be com-
pelled to eat the pancakes himself.
“The laws of hospitality—chivalry—
l'entente cordiale itself—demand that
you finish them.”
When Hippolyte finally yielded, his
rapid and efficient despatch of the
dainties excited the admiration of his
hosts. They had collected their plates
and were taking their departure, with
expressions of regard, when a knock
announced the arrival of a garçon from
the Café aux Gourmets, bearing a dish
of crisp hot crépes.
“One moment, Messieurs,” said Hip-
polyte dramatically to his departing
visitors. “It must not be said that
Hippolyte Larivière lacks in neigh-
bourly feeling. Behold my seasonable

g M'sieur groaned. The Sergeant-
Major, being a soldier, concealed his
apprehensions. Wild thoughts of sur-
reptitiously disposing of them in a coal-
bin whirled through their minds, but
Hippolyte apparently divined their
thoughts.
“I regret that I must forgo the
pleasure I promised myself of asking

DOMESTIC STRATEGY.
I will admit that it was I who gave
Mrs. Brackett the idea. But to blame
me for the very unfortunate dénouement
is ridiculous. - -
I met Mrs. Blackett in Sloane Street.
“I'm on my way to a registry-
office,” she said. “No, not that kind
of registry-office; I'm not about to
commit bigamy. I mean the kind where
domestic assistants are sought, but
mostly in vain. I suppose you don't
know of a cook, a kitchenmaid, a house-
maid, a parlourmaid and a tweeny ?”.
I confessed that I did not. But I
told her the story of some friends of
mine who had been in a similar posi-
tion and had succeeded in reorganising
their establishment by an ingenious
strategy.
“The wife went away to stay with
friends in the country,” I said, “and the
husband went to the registry-office,
representing himself to be a bachelor,
a rather easy-going bachelor. It seems
that such establishments are popular
with the few domestic servants still at
large. After a short time he let it be
known that he was really married, but
|further interval he called his household
together and with tears in his voice
informed them that he and his wife had
composed their differences and that
she was returning to him on the morrow.
I understand that it was a complete
success.”
Mrs. Brackett was very much im-
pressed by this story. -
, “If I don't find anyone to-day I shall
try it,” she said as we parted.
She did not find anyone, and she did
try it. She left home the following day,
as I learnt from Brackett when I met
him a week later. . .
“Your tip's come off absolutely A1,”
he said, “and I'm most awfully obliged.
The worry was getting on my wife's
nerves. As it is I filled up my establish-
ment a couple of days ago and, as every-
thing is going well, I've wired my wife
to come home to-morrow.”
“Have you broken it to the maids?”
I asked doubtfully. -
“Oh, no; but I shall just tell 'em in
the morning,” said Brackett. “That'll
be all right.”
I felt at the time that he was being
far too precipitate, but he seemed so
confident that I didn't interfere. The
In the first place Brackett, in his
casual way, omitted to say anything
about his being married until Mrs.
Brackett was actually in the house.
Even then he seems to have been rather
ambiguous in his explanations. Any-
way the new maids were, or affected to
be, profoundly shocked. They intimated
that they would never have entered so
irregular an establishment had they
known, and departed en masse after
spreading a scandal among the trades-
people which will take the Bracketts

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, February 10th.-As His
MAJESTY read his gracious speech to
the assembled Lords and Commons
did his thoughts flow back for a mo-
ment to the last time he opened Parlia-

February 10th, in 1914, and
so little was the coming
storm foreseen that the cus-
tomary announcement, “My
relations with Foreign Pow-
ers continue to be friendly,”
was followed by a special
reference to the satisfactory
progress of “my negotiations
with the German Govern-
ment and the Ottoman Gov-
ernment” regarding—Meso-

Since then everything has
changed—save one. Ireland Ž

appears to want the Bill; but then, as
Colonel SIDNEY PEEL, the Mover in the
Commons, remarked with equal truth,

“Are we to withdraw the troops and

the “Wee Free” champion, who had
interpreted the recent by-elections as a

past, was unkindly reminded that, at
any rate, the results of these contests
had furnished no encouragement to the
party that he adorns. “But I am
afraid I am getting controversial,” said
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, to the amusement
of the House, which had enjoyed his
sword-play for half-an-hour; and with
that he turned to the task of defending
the new policy in Russia. Having
failed to subdue the Bolshevists by
force, we are now going to try the
effect of commerce—a modern reading
of “Trade Follows the Flag.” The
Labour Party cheered the new de-
parture vociferously, but the rest of
the House seemed a little chilly,
and Mr. CHURCHILL, at the PRIME
MINISTER's elbow, looked about as
happy as NAPOLEON on the return
from Moscow.
Lord HUGH CECIL raised the standard
of economy, and complained that the
legislative programme was extrava-
gantly long. “A large number of Bills
generally meant a large amount of ex-
penditure.” I have myself observed
this phenomenon.

sat down I am sure that a

to think that, after all, there
was “something in it.” Wis-

Thursday, February 12th.--This was
the first Question-day of the new Ses-
sion, and the House was flattered to
see Mr. LLoyd GEORGE in his place,
despite the counter-claims of the Peace
Conference at St. James's Palace. Evi-
dently he means this year to “stick to
the shop " more closely, in view, per-
haps, of the possible return from
Paisley of the old proprietor.
To a Labour Member's complaint
that several ex-Generals had been ap-
pointed as divisional Food officers, Mr.
McCURDY replied that no preference
was given to military candidates. But
why not 2 Where will you find more
competent judges of alimentary ques-
tions than in the higher ranks of His
Majesty's Forces?
In attacking the provisions of the
Peace Treaty with Germany as “im-
practicable,” Sir DoNALD MACLEAN re-
vealed himself as a diligent student of
a recent notorious book. Most of his
observations—excepting, perhaps, the
statement that he had “no sentimental
tenderness for the Germans"—were
marked with the brand of KEYNEs, and
his assertion that the utmost Germany
could pay was two thousand millions
came bodily from that eminent statis-
tician. To the same inspiration was
possibly due the unhappy suggestion
that our chief Ally was pursuing a
policy of revenge.
For this he was promptly pulled up
by Lord Robert CECIL, who warned
him not to judge the policy of France
by the utterances of certain French
newspapers. Lord RoberT had, how-
ever, his own quarrel with the Govern-
ment, who, according to his account,
had done nothing to set Central Europe
on its legs again, except to send it a
certain amount of food—not, one would
would have thought, an altogether bad
preliminary.
It was a pity that Mr. BALFour had
for he was dialectically at his best.
After complimenting the Opposition
leader on his “charming tones and
anodyne temper” he proceeded to take
up his challenge—“if I may call it a
challenge.” If Germany was in doubt
as to the amount she might be called
upon to pay, she had her remedy, for
the Peace Treaty especially provided
that she might offer a “lump sum.”
The list of war-criminals was long, no
doubt, but we had limited our own de-
mands to those who were guilty of
gratuitous brutality. As for the con-
dition of Central Europe, that was not
the fault of the Teace Treaty, it was
the fault of the War, and this country
had done all it reasonably could to
remedy it.
The Opposition insisted on taking a
division, and were beaten by 254 to 60.
So far the “doomed Coalition" seems
to be doing rather well.
A SINGLE HOUND.
WHEN the opal lights in the West had
died -
And night was wrapping the red ferns
round, -
As I came home by the woodland side
I heard the cry of a single hound.
The huntsman had gathered his pack
and gone; -
The last late hoof had echoed away;
The horn was twanging a long way on
For the only hound that was still
astray.
While, heedless of all but the work in
hand,
Up through the brake where the
brambles twine,
Crying his joy to the drowsy land ,
Javelin drove on a burning line.
The air was sharp with a touch of frost;
The moon came up like a wheel of
gold;
The wall at the end of the woods he
crossed
And flung away on the open wold.
And long as I listened beside the stile
The larches echoed that eerie sound,
Steady and tireless, mile on mile,
The hunting cry of a single hound.

“I’ve hit on something at last,”
cried Charles exultantly, throwing him-
self down on my second-best armchair.
“I wish you wouldn't hit on it
so hard,” I complained; “the springs
are half-broken already. What's the
trouble 2 ”
“Have you ever heard,” he inquired,
“of the black-coated salariat 2"
“The egg of the greater green-backed
woodpecker—”
“It isn't a bird,” he said; “it’s a
class of people that works with its
brains. And the hand of Labour, ae-
cording to my evening paper, is being
held out to it.”
“But suppose one wears a pepper-
and-salt suit,” I said, “and writes
“Society Gossip." What about that ?”
“That's just my point. All these ac-
cepted lines of distinction are absolutely
wrong. It isn't what people work at
that divides them, it's the way they
travel to their work. Sir THoMAs MA-
LORY knew that. When Lancelot was
going to rescue Guinevere he had his
white horse badly punctured by a bush-
ment of archers and had to finish the
journey in a woodcutter's cart. And
that was a great disgrace to him and
made the Queen's ladies laugh. It
would be just the same with the typists
of a rich employer if his motor-car
broke down and he had to arrive in a
bus. How do you get to town in the
morning yourself 2"
“I am a Tuber,” I said sadly. “Every
bright morning I say I will go by bus,
but when I reach the Tube station the
draught sucks me in through the door,
the man grabs me by the collar, throws
me into the sink, liſts up the plug and
down we go into the drain-pipe to-
gether. I think I have the brand of
Tubal Cain on my brow. It is a kind of
perpetual crease—”
“I too Tube,” said Charles; “but I
know many eminently respectable bus

I said, “and as the second one was

hansom cabs were called the gondolas
of London. The trams, I suppose, are

my life. I do not mingle with them.”
“I mingled with a tram once,” I
said. “I clasped it warmly by the
rail as it was going by, but I missed
the step with my foot. It spurned me
rather badly. But kindly explain what
you're driving at.”
“All these classes,” said Charles,
“have their own friendships, their own
jolts and jars, their own way of being
bullied by conductors and thrown into
the mud and squeezed into cages and
arranged upon straps. But they have
one great thing in common, distinct
though they may be. They are all
passengers, all takers of tickets. There
is going to be a Bus Union, a Tube
Union, and a Tram Union, and when
necessary they will combine.”
“Against what?”
“Against the motorists, first and
foremost,” said Charles. “The opulent

will be picketed; business will be
paralysed.”
“Except for the stout fellows who
walk,” I suggested.
“They will find it very lonely at
their offices,” said Charles. “Nobody
wants to work if there's any excuse to
avoid it, and the beauty of the thing is
that we can strike not only against

AT THE PLAY.
“CARNIVAL.”
Those who imagined that they were
to be given a dramatic version of Mr.
CoMPTON MACKENZIE's romance must
have been shocked to find that the enter-
tainment provided at the New Theatre
was just a variation, from an Italian
source, of the general idea of Pagliacci.
But it was the only palpable shock
they sustained, for never did a play
run a more obvious course from start
to finish. When you have for your
leading character an actor-manager,
who plays the part of Othello, with his
wife as Desdemona (how well we know
to our cost this conjugal form of nepot-
ism), and discusses in private life the
character of the Moor—whether a man
would be likely to indulge his jealousy
on grounds so inadequate—speaking
with the detached air of one who is
absolutely confident of his own wife's
fidelity, you don't need much in-
telligence to foresee what the envy
of the gods is preparing for him.
The remainder is only a matter of de-
tail—what particular excuse, for in-
stance, the lady will find for a diversion,
and to what lengths she will go.
In the present case her only excuse
was the old one, that she was “treated
like a child.” Certainly she deserved to
be, for her behaviour was of the most
wilful and wayward; but she was the
mother of a strapping boy, and a wo-
man who is thought old enough to
play, in the premier Italian company,
the part of Desdemona (with the accent,
too, on the second syllable) could hardly
justify her complaint that she was
regarded as a juvenile.
The choice of the Alfieri Theatre for
the scene of the culmination of the
domestic drama seemed to touch the
extreme of improbability. The actors
were not a poor travelling company of
mummers, as in Pagliacci, with no
decent private accommodation for this
kind of thing. The protagonist of
Carnival was lodged in a perfectly
good Venetian palace, where there was
every convenience for having the matter
out with his wife and her lover. For
the rest the plot was commonplace to
the verge of banality.
As Silvio Steno, in his home life,
Mr. MATHEson LANG was excellently
natural, but as Othello his make-up
spoilt his nice face and tended to
alienate me. As Simonetta (I got very
sick of the name) Miss HILDA BAYLEY
had a difficult part, and failed, from no
great fault of her own, to attach our
sympathies, till in the end she ex-
plained her rather inscrutable conduct
in a defence which gave us for the first
acter. There was too much play with
her Carnival dress of a Bacchante,
which, perhaps, was less intriguing
than we were given to understand.
Mr. DENNIs NEILsoN-TERRY has a
certain distinction, but he did not
make a very perfect military paramour.
His intonation seemed to lack control,
and he has a curious habit of baring
his upper teeth when he is getting
ready to make a forcible remark.
As for the scenes, they were alleged
to be Venice (where the Doges wedded
the sea), but there was no visible sign
of water. You called for a gondola,
which always sounds better than a
taxi, but it never appeared. Perhaps,

however, for one has not always been
very happy in one's experiences of
stage navigation, this was just as well.
O. S.
“PETER IBBETSON.”
That incorrigible romanticist, GEORGE
DU MAURIER of happy memory, was so
transparently sincere as to be disarm-
ing. No use telling him “life's not
like that.” “That's just it,” he'd say,
and get on with his pleasant illusions.
Peter Ibbetson is certainly not tuned to
the moods of this decade, but it would
be a pity if we all became too sophisti-
cated to enjoy such occasional excur-
sions into the land of almost-grown-up
make-believe.
If life doesn't give you what you
want, then “cross your legs, put your
hands behind your head,” go to sleep
and live a dream-life of your own de-
vising—that is the theme. The bare
loved Mimsy of Peter's happy childhood
becomes the wife of a distinctly un-
faithful duke; while Peter finds himself
in prison for killing his quite gratui-
tously wicked uncle, and for forty years
reprieved convict and deceived duchess
meet in dreams till her death divides
and his again unites them.
It is a considerable tribute to both
author and adapter (the late JoHN
RAPHAEL) that their work should, at
the height of the barking season, hold
an audience silent and apparently en-
thralled, in 'spite of the handicap that,
in order to make the story in any degree
intelligible, much time had to be given
to more or less tedious explanations.
I will not pretend that the motives of
the characters were clear or that (for
me) the phantasy quite passed the test
of being translated from the medium of
the written word into that of canvas,
gauze and costumed players, with those
scufflings of dim figures in the semi-
darkness and that furtive and by no
means noiseless zeal of scene-shifters;
or, again, that I was much attracted
by a picture of the life after death, in
which opera-going (please cf. Mr. VALE
Owen) figured so prominently. Indeed
I think that the play would be better
if it ended with the death of the
dreamers and did not attempt that
hazardous last passage.
But certainly there were quite ad-
mirable tableaux and some very intelli-
gent individual playing—in contrast
with the team - work of (particularly)
the First Act, which was ragged and
amateurish.
Mr. BASIL RATHBONE's Peter was an
effective study, avoiding Scylla of the
commonplace and Charybdis of the
mawkish—no mean feat. A young
man with a future, I dare hazard; with
a gift of clear utterance, and sensibility
and a useful figure.
It is a good deal to say that Miss
CoNSTANCE Collier so contrived her
Duchess of Towers as to make us under-
stand Peter's worship.
Miss JESSIE BATEMAN's Mrs. Deane
seemed to me an exceedingly com-
petent piece of work, and Mr. GILBERT
HARE thoroughly enjoyed every mouth-
ful of Colonel Ibbetson's wickedness,
and made us share his appreciation.
And you couldn't accuse him of over-
playing, though he certainly looked too
bad to be true.
Mr. WILLIAM BURCHILL's little sketch
of an old French officer was almost
too poignant.
Why the landlord of the Tête Noir
was got up to resemble Mr. WILL Evans
so closely is a deep matter I could not
fathom, and, if ever I kill my uncle, may

More ADVENTUREs of A Post-war spoRTSMAN.
P.-W. S. (who has taken a Spring fishing). “AND THIs Is what I've PAID THREE 'UNDRED QUID For 1"
THE ORDER OF THE B.S.O.
ONE of the oldest of Mr. Punch's
young men thought he would like to
hear some orchestral music on Monday
week last, so he dropped in at the
Queen's Hall to assist at a concert of the
new British Symphony Orchestra. The
name of the founder and conductor,
Mr. RAYMoND Roze, was already fami-
liar, for Mr. Punch's young man was
old enough to remember Mr. Roze's
mother, MARIE Roze, in her brilliant
prime as prima donna of the Carl Rosa
Company; and he is glad to know
that she is still living in her beloved
Paris, where she was decorated by
M. THIERs for her gallant conduct dur-
ing the siege of 1870. So it is pleasant
to find her son so actively associated
in the good work of finding permanent
musical engagements for demobilised
soldiers in the British Symphony
Orchestra.
The B.S.O. men are not home-keeping
soldiers. Every one of them has served
over-seas, and it was a pity that their
names and the record of their services
were not printed in the programme, for it
ing disproof of the old tradition that
musicians must needs be long-haired,
sallow and unathletic. Alert and young
and vigorous they appealed to the eye as
well as to the ear, and they played, as
they fought, gloriously, these minstrel
boys who had all gone to the War.
Strings and woodwind, brass and per-
cussion, all are uptothebest professional
level. -
There is no movement which has a
stronger claim on all men and women
of goodwill than that for providing
employment for demobilized soldiers,
and the British Symphony Orchestra
is a first-rate contribution to that de-
sirable end. The personnel of the
orchestra is all that can be desired.
It was bad luck that Mr. RAYMOND
Roze was prevented by illness from
conducting last week, but the band was
fortunate in securing an admirable sub-
stitute in Mr. FRANK BRIDGE. Mr.
Punch gives the scheme his blessing
without reserve, but with a word of
advice. To win for the B.S.O. the suc-
cess it deserves will need good judgment
as well as energy and efficiency. The
art of programme-framing has to be
the powerful but, we believe, perfectly
friendly competition of other established
organizations. Last week's programme
had its beaua moments, but it had also
at least two mauvais quarts d'heure.
The men, however, were splendid.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. John HASTINGs TURNER, who had already to his
credit a play, a novel and various successful revues, has
now produced, in A Place in the World (CASSELL), what is,
I understand, to some extent a fictional version of his
play. How far this may be so I am uncertain (not having
seen the play), but I am by no means uncertain that it
makes here a wholly admirable story, one moreover that
shows a notable advance in Mr. TURNER's art as novelist,
being firmer in touch and generally more matured than any-
thing he has yet written. The plot concerns the adventures,
spiritual and other, of Madame Iris Iranovna, pampered
cosmopolitan beauty, when fate or her own egotistical
whim had dumped her as a temporary dweller in the semi-
detached villas of suburbia. The theme, you observe, is one
that might excuse the wildest farce, since the effect of Iris
upon her unfamiliar surroundings was naturally devastat-
ing. Mr. TURNER however has chosen the more ambitious
path of high comedy. In Iris herself, and even more in
the kindly old vicar who so unexpectedly confronts her
with her own weapons of wit and worldly wisdom, he has
drawn two characters of genuine and moving humanity. I
shall not tell you how the conflict (essential to real comedy)
works itself out, nor after what fashion the empty brilliance
of Iris is humiliated and transformed. If I have a criticism
of Mr. TURNER's method, it is that, as with Bunthorne, a
“tendency to soliloquy” is growing upon him which will
enough. Already known as what the old lady called “an
agreeable rattlesnake,” he has now proved himself a story-
teller of conspicuous promise.
Von FALKENHAYN's General Headquarters 1914–1916 and
its Critical Decisions (HUTCHINsoN) seems an honester book
than LUDENDoRFF's; less political, less querulous, less
egoistic. Von FALKENHAYN, who was War Minister when
the War began and retained his office after he had superseded
Won MoDTRE as Chief of the General Staff, shows himself
incurably Prussian, refusing even to consider the possibility
that any State which could wage war effectively would hesi-
tate to do so from any ethical or humanitarian scruple.
“Don’t bother about a just cause, but see that it appears
just before men,” he seems to say. “The surprise effect of
gas (at Ypres) was very great,” is all the comment that
tragic episode draws from him. He was a submarine cam-
paign whole-hogger. But he has his own soldierly virtues
of modesty and loyalty, and refuses to air his personal
grievances in the matter of his supersession by the HINDEN-
BURG-LUDENDoRFF syndicate. If, as seems likely, he speaks
the truth, as he had opportunity to see it, we must revise
our too flattering estimates of the German superiority in
numbers and attribute a good deal of the stubbornness of
their defence to their quicker appreciation of the character
of siege war. The holding of front-line trenches with few
men and consequent immense saving of life was, according
to the General, practised by the German Command long
before we discovered its value. He gives areasoned criticism,

need watching. But he clothes his reflections pleasantly
which has to the layman a plausible air, to the effect that

the relative failure of JoFFRE's great combined Champagne-
Flanders offensive of 1915 was due to the overcrowding
of the attacking armies. General voN FALKENHAYN, though |
he has a prejudice for the German soldier, can bring him-
self to testify to the valour of his British and French oppo-
nent. A readable and conscientious account of a difficult
stewardship.
I wish I could feel as enthusiastic about The Booming of
Bunkie (JENKINs) as Mr. Peter McMunn, who, falling off
a motor-cycle, landed in that quiet Scots village and pro-
ceeded to turn it, by a series of stunts, into a well-known
watering-place. He undertook the job, I gather, partly for
a joke and partly for the bright eyes of Evelyn Kirbet, whose
father put up the money for the purposes of publicity and
propaganda. The transformation of a hamlet into a seaside
resort has been treated as a sort of psychological romance
by Mr. Oliver ONIONs in Mushroom Town, where the human
beings are a background as it were for the bricks and mortar;
Mr. A. S. NEILL, having chosen to make a farce of it, has
provided a hero who believes in humorous advertisements,
enough that so endeared her to her former public. Touch
that and the bloom is indeed gone.
With the Chinks (LANE), a volume of the “Active Service
Series,” treats of the training of Chinese coolies for work ||
with the Labour Corps in the B.E.F. The special interest
of the racial type was, for me, exhausted by the charming
photographs; the task remaining for Mr. DARYL KLEIN,
Lieutenant in the Chinese Labour Corps, of so conveying
the atmosphere as to absorb the reader's attention, was not
achieved. On the two main aspects of the topic, the origin
in China and the result in France, he makes no serious
attempt. I got no clear impression of the coolie at home
or of why he took to being an ally, and I was left with but
the vaguest conception of the unit in France, since the
narrative ended at the disembarcation. Lastly, I have
with regret to complain of one sentence in particular,
where he tells us: “It is high time I said something about
the officers.” He had, from the general reader's point of
view, already said too much. It is a pity to have to speak
thus moderately of a war-book obviously written with care
and has evidently persuaded
the author to take him at
his own valuation. This is.
hardly to be wondered at,
since Mr. McMunn seems
always keener on popping
his puns than on selling his
goods. Specimens are given
of speeches, press articles,
posters and cinema pro-
ductions, but the fun rages
with the most furious in-
tensity round the golf links,

the air of Bunkie leaves me cold.
I really think that The World of Wonderful Reality

a test for your true follower of Mr. E. TEMPLE THURStoN.
You recall the ingredients that went towards the first, or
Beautiful Nonsense, book? Sentiment in the slums, Venice
with a very big V and poverty passim might be regarded
as its composition. Well, here you have John and Jill
home again; no more Venice, a palpably decreasing sen-
timent, and only poverty to fill up with. I am bound
to confess that I found John's protracted preparation for
his nuptials rather less than enough as subject-matter
for a whole book. Of course all this time there remained
Amber (you recollect her; she “also ran " for the John
stakes), and at the back of your mind a comfortable con-
viction that two strings are still better than one. Having
censured the book for insufficient plot, I had better not
proceed to give away what there is. I will content myself
with a personal doubt as to whether John and Jill will
quite reduplicate their former triumph—and that for various
reasons, not least because (for purposes of sequel, I sup-
pose) even Jill herself has been permitted so grave a lapse
Expedition (ARNoLD) fell into my hands. Major DoNoHoR,
while never losing sight of his main object, finds time to
tell us a number of entertaining stories with a sedate
humour which is most attractive. Seldom has an expedition
set out on a wilder errand than this of the “Hush-hush"
Brigade, or, as it was officially known, the “Dunsterville”
or “Bagdad Party.” It was commanded by General
DUNSTERVILLE, and briefly its objects were to combat
Bolshevism, train Persian levies, prevent the Huns and
Turks from threatening India by way of the Caspian Sea,
and a few other little things of the same nature. The men
of this “party” were picked men, and it is enough to say
that their courage was as high as their numbers were few.
It is indeed a mystery why any of them escaped with their
lives, for, as experience proved, it was one thing to train
Persian levies and another to get them to fight when they
were wanted to. And without the levies the “Hush-Hush"
party was outnumbered again and again. ... I could have
wished that the excellent map which is firmly embedded in
the binding had been detachable, for the interest of the
chronicle compelled me constantly to refer to it, and I
suffered great distraction.

I Do not ask for silk attire,
For purple, no, nor puce;
The only wear that I require
Is something plain and loose, - -
A quiet set of reach-me-downs for serviceable use.
For these, which I must have because
The honour of the Press
Compels me, by unwritten laws,
To clothe my nakedness, -
Four guineas is my limit—more or (preferably) less,
Let others go in Harris tweeds,
Men of the leisured sort;
Mine are the modest, homely needs
That with my state comport; -
I am a simple labouring man whose work is all his sport.
I covet not the gear of those
Who neither toil nor spin;
I merely want some standard clo's
To drape my standard skin,
Wrought of material suitable for writing verses in.
•
Something that won't pick up the dust
When rhymes refuse to flow;
And roomy, lest the seams be bust
Should the afflatus blow—
Say five-and-forty round the ribs and rather more below.

[In his lecture at the Royal Institution, to which Mr. Punch
recently referred, Mr. ALFRED Noy Es said that “our art and litera-
ture were increasingly Bolshevik, and if they looked at the columns
of any newspaper they would see the unusual spectacle of the political
editor desperately fighting that which the art and literary portions of
the paper upheld.”] -
SCENE.—A Club-room near Fleet Street. The Political
Editor and the Literary Editor of “The Daily Crisis”
are discovered seated in adjoining armchairs.

P. E. Really 2 I run the political columns. Did you

L. E. I'm afraid I never read the political articles. Did
you notice my two-column boom of young Applecart's latest
book of poems ?
P. E. No time to read the literary columns, and modern
poetry's as good as Chinese to me. Who's Applecart 2
L. E. My dear Sir, is it possible that you are unfamiliar
with the author of I Will Destroy? He's the hope of the
future as far as English poetry is concerned.

L. E. (impressively). He has overthrown all the rules,
not only of art, but of morality. He has created a new

What's ho
P. E. Can't see that that's anything to shout about.
What's his platform, anyway?
L. E. Platform 2 To anyone who has the slightest
acquaintance with Applecart the very idea of a platform
is fantastic. He doesn't stand ; he soars.
: P. E. Well, what are his views, then 2 Pretty tall, I sup-
pose, if he's such a high flier.
L. E. You may well say so. In the first place he discards
all the old artistic formulae.
P. E. I know ; you write a solid slab of purple prose,
scissor it into a jig-saw puzzle, serve it with a dazzle dress-
ing and call it the New Poetry. . .
L. E. Have your joke, if you will. But, more important
still, Applecart is a rebel against humanity and all its
fetishes, social, ethical and political. *
P. E. (startled). A Bolshie, I suppose you mean?
L. E. The artist is proof against all these vulgar terms
of abuse, culled from the hustings. Call him a Pussyfoot
as well; you cannot shake him from his pinnacle.
P. E. Yes, but look here—he's just the sort of pernicious
agitator we're out against in The Crisis—at least in my
department. My special article this morning — three
thickly - leaded columns—actually revealed the existence,
of a most insidious plot to undermine the restraining in-
fluence of the House of Lords by the spread of Bolshevik
propaganda masquerading as literature. You see, there's
a certain section of the Lords, mainly new creations who've
only recently been released from various employments, who
now for the first time in their lives have leisure for read-
ing; then there's the spread of education among the sport-
ing Peers. Well, these people are ready to succumb to all
sorts of poisonous doctrines, if they're served up in what
I presume to be the fashionable mode of the moment; and
I expect your precious Applecart is one of the Bolsh agents

“Christopher,” said Cecilia clearly,

climbed on his knee and put an arm

“I wouldn't hurt you, dear old Dad,

John positively gasped with relief.

[FEBRUARY 25, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE INTERNATIONALIST.
“WHAT on earth,” I said to the
waiter, who was standing a few yards
off, lost in a pensive dream of his native
land—Switzerland, France, Italy 2–
well, anyhow, lost in a pensive dream—
“what on earth is a Petrograd steak?”
The white napkin whisked like the
scut of a rabbit, and he bounded to my
side. “Eet is mince-up,” he said melo-
dramatically. “Ze Petrograd steak
ver good. Two minute—mince-up.”
“But isn't that a Vienna steak?” I
asked.
A spasm of pain passed over his face.
“Before ze War,” he whispered, “yes,
Vienna steak. Now we call it ze Petro-
grad. You will have one? Yes? Two
minute.”
Memories came flooding back of that
moment of crisis which had found so
many of our trusted statesmen ill-pre-
pared, but, terrible as it was, had not
caught the managers of London restau-
rants mapping. I remembered the im-
mense stores of Dutch lager beer which
they had so providentially and so pa-
triotically held in anticipation of the
hour of need. Dutch beer, both light
and dark, so that inveterate drinkers of
Munich and Pilsener were enabled to
face Armageddon almost without a jerk.
They had other things ready too—
Danish pſité de fois gras, Swiss liver
sausages, Belgian pastries and the rest.
It was in that dark hour, I suppose, that
the Vienna steak set its face towards
the steppes. But this was in 1914, and
a good deal had happened since then.
It appeared to me that the restaurant
was not exactly au courant with inter-
national complications and the gastro-
nomic consequences of the Peace. I
felt entitled to further illumination.
“I don't feel at all certain,” I told
the man, “that I ought to eat a Petro-
grad steak. Is it a white steak 2"
“Ah, no, not vite, not vite at all,” he
assured me. “Eet is underdone—not
much, but a little underdone. Wer good
mince-up.”
“I absolutely refuse to eat a Red
Petrograd steak,” I declared. “Have
you by any chance anything Jugo-
Slavian on the menu ?”
“Zere is ze jugged hare—”
“I think you misunderstand me,” I
interrupted; “this is a point of principle
with me. Supposing I consume this
Czecho-Slovakian mince-up and then
have a piece of Stilton; there has been
no war with Stilton, I fancy—”
“Ver good, ze Stilton,” interjected
the chorus.
“And coffee—
“Turkish coffee ?” he said.
“There you go again,” I grumbled.
--
Vienna and Petrograd (and, mind you,
I am not feeling at all bitter towards
Vienna), my relations with Turkey are
most certainly strained.”
“No, not strained, ze Turkish coffee,”
he cried eagerly; “eet has ze grounds.”
“So have I,” I told him; “we will
call it the Macedonian coffee. It is you
who insisted in obtruding these inter-
national relations on my simple lunch,
and I mean to do the thing thoroughly.
Better a dish of Croat Serbs where
love is than a bifteck Petrograd
Never mind, go and get the thing.”
When he returned with it I fell to,
but my thoughts remained with the
waiter. What a man' With his dis-
passionate judgment, his calm sane
outlook on men and affairs, shaken a
little perhaps in 1914, but since then
undisturbed, was he not cut out above
all others to settle the vexed frontier
lines of Europe? I wondered whether
Lord Robert CECIL might not possibly
make use of him. I was tempted to
try him still further.
“Have you ever heard of Mr. J. M.
KEYNEs 2 " I asked him when he
brought me the Bessarabian coffee.
“Mr. KEYNEs I not know. He not
come here, I zink.”
“Or the Treaty of London 2"
“I vill ask ze manager.”
“Or President WILSON ?”
A brilliant smile of illumination lit
up his features. -
“American, is he not ?” he said.
“Ver reech, ze Americans.”
This saddened me a little. He was
not then absolutely complete. There
was a faint tarnish on the lustre of his
innocence. He was scarcely perhaps
suited for the League of Nations after
all. Lighting an Albanian cigarette I
asked him for my bill.

“TIRED of laborious days and nights
Spent on the intellectual heights,

The masters of the future State.
Besides, the people in the plains

COX AND BOX.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Let us talk Haute
Finance. In other words, let us in-
dulge in that good old Anglo-Saxon
pastime of blackguarding Cox AND Co.
It will remind us of the piping days of
war. There is too much peace about,
and the gentle and ever-forgiving Cox
AND Co. expect their customers to be men
of force and character, showing temper
from time to time. Everybody else
may be demobilised; I remain a soldier,
and as such I have my special bank.
Ah, me! the battles in Charing Cross
are not the easy things they used to be.
No longer, as of old, I come fresh to
the attack against a mere underling,
worn down by the assaults of wave
after wave of brother-officers attacking
before me. I enter the Territorial De-
partment alone and am taken on by a
master-hand, supported and flanked by
a number of unoccupied subordinates.
About the Spring of 1925, when I expect
to be the only “T” left, I anticipate
the decisive moment when I shall
cross swords or swop bombs with Sir
Cox himself. Having bravely encoun-
tered “AND Co.” these many years, I
shall not be daunted by that gilded
knight. -
The war having once put me in pos.
session of my Cox AND Co., I had very
frequent recourse to them when in need
of such solace as only money can bring.
The time arrived when I applied in
the money had disappeared.
Though I had no reason to suspect
Cox AND Co. of being dishonest I no-
ticed a tone of assuredness and self-

book again. My eye fell upon a paying
and deducting and refunding and read-
justing of an item itself so shameful
that it dared only appear under its
initials. Why this oscillation ? I asked
myself. So we engaged upon another
correspondence, and another interview
took place, at which I was supported
by my subaltern (who could multiply
and add), and the bank-man was sup.
ported by a young lady (who could
divide and subtract). At the end of a
passionatediscussion, which lasted fifty-
seven minutes (forty-five of them being
after closing time) the conclusion was
arrived at that the total was correct to
a halfpenny. Even Cox AND Co. them-
selves were a bit surprised at that.
Years passed, and there was no doubt
about it; the money continued to dis-
appear. Trusting that Cox AND Co.
were now lulled into a feeling of false se-
curity I tried a surprise reconnaissance.
I dropped in on them without warning
and asked to see that pass-book then
and there. They searched high and
low, but they couldn't find it. I, on
the other hand, found it quite easily,
when I searched amongst my papers
at home. To me this proved that I
was the better searcher. My subaltern,
however, would have it that the cir-
against Cox AND Co. His sympathies
were clearly with them, so I requested
him kindly to get on with his own work
and not to interfere further in my
private affairs. He went away in a
huff, got demobilised and, I have little
doubt, married the young lady who
divided and subtracted and, with her,
set up a bank of his own... I devoted
my young life to the search for some
person, firm or corporation, expert in
pass-books, haughty of demeanour, cap-
able of getting blood out of a stone and
not likely to give even the devil his due;
I wanted such an ally for the next
assault.
I have always remained a civilian,
and as such have retained my other
banker. A man of unlimited posses-
sions, I may state accurately that I
have to-day no fewer than two banks
of my own. Let us call this other one
Box and Co. That is not the real name,
but it is as far as I dare go to refer to
them, even under an assumed name.
Years of stern handling by them have
taken all the spirit out of me. It is as
much as I can do to screw up my
-
courage so far as to ask the loan of a
pound or two of my own money off
them. And there have been times, in
the pre-1914 past, when I have felt it
than to have the stuff thrown at me,
shovelled at me in that contemptuous
offhand manner. I now repaired in
person to the premises of Box and Co.,
with their handsome marble façade and
their costly mahogany fittings, and had
a word with Mr. Box himself: A little
artful flattery, a few simple lies and
just a touch of ginger in the matter of
professional competition, and Box and
Co. were brought into the war. I
handed them Cox AND Co.'s pass-book
and told them that now was their time
to go in and win.
I used to look in every other day to see
how the struggle went. At first Box and
Co. were confident, remarking on my
wisdom in placing myself (and my pass-
book) in such competent hands as
theirs. But as the correspondence
went on their enthusiasm wore off;
Mr. Box gave vent to observations
reflecting ill on the Army system of
pay, on the Army itself, even on that
part of it which was me. Had it not
been that the pride of Box and Co. was
involved, I believe they would have
gone to London in a body, there to
form a lifelong friendship with Cox AND
Co., out of pure fellow-feeling. But I
have hinted that Box and Co. were a
cold inhuman institution, whose busi-

cumstances gave me no right of action

or go down itself. And so Cox AND Co.
had to be for it. Eventually, in the late
winter of 1919, Box and Co. extracted
from Cox AND Co. the admission that a
five had been mistaken for a three, and
I had been done out of twopence, an
affair all the more gross in that it had
happened as long ago as the early
spring of 1915, and never a werd of
remorse meanwhile ! A conclusion by
which neither Box nor Cox was really
satisfied, but which, for me, was enough.
We English may only win one battle in
a war, but that battle is the last.
Possibly, my dear Charles, you have
a soft spot in your heart for this Cox
AND Co., never failing in courtesy and
attention and ever heaped with abuse?
So, to be frank, have I. Let us turn
round and blackguard the other fellow.
The sequel is incredible.
I next handed my Box and Co. pass-
book to Cox AND Co., giving them a brief
and touching résumé of my sad story
of wrong and oppression, and bidding
them do their damnedest in their turn.
They wrote to Box and Co.: “Our cus-
tomer, your customer, we may say THE
customer, Second-Lieutenant, Brevet-
Lieutenant, Temporary Captain, Acting
Major, Local Colonel, Aspiring General
(entered in your books as plain Mister)
Henry Neplusultra, informs us that,
though he has banked with you since
the first sovereign he earned at his
baptism, he has been so frowned at
and scorned as to have been rendered
morally unable to handle his current
balance. He instructs us . . .”
But why relate the story in all its
grim horror? Enough to say that so suc-
cessfully did Cox AND Co. pursue their
instructions that they discovered a
credit balance in my favour of 14s. 3d. ;
so politely and firmly did they conduct
the correspondence that eventually Box
and Co. burst into tears, admitted the
claim and, upon my calling the other
day personally to receive satisfaction,
handed me the 14s. 3d, with a defer-
ential bow. If you doubt the truth of
this statement you have only to come
round to my place, where you can see
for yourself the threepence, which is
still in my possession.

DAY BY DAY IN THE WORLD OF CRIME.
(By a well-known Professor of Larceny.)
IN these days when robbery with
violence is an everyday occurence, few
people will trust themselves alone in
railway carriages. Imagine, therefore,
my surprise, not unmingled with plea-
sure, on seeing a somewhat pompous-
looking individual, with the circumfer-
ence and watch-chain of the successful

carriage on the suburban up-line from
Wallingford. I always travel from
Wallingford, as it is the one station on
the line at which you are not required
to show a ticket on entry. Accordingly
I entered the old gentleman's carriage,
took his ticket, and offered him a
cigarette, which he accepted. I then
opened the conversation.
“I wonder you wear your watch-
chain so prominently,” I remarked,
“especially during the present vogue of
crime—so tempting, you know.”
“Ah!” he said, “so you may think;
but, being a bit of a criminologist, I
have arranged that as a little trap. It
is my belief that the pickpocket, foiled
in one particular, never attempts to rob
his victim in any other way. Now this
chain cost me precisely ninepence. It
is weighted at each end with a piece of
lead, which gives an appearance of
genuineness to the watch-pocket. I
am heavily armed, in case he should
attempt violence.”
It was here that I removed his
pocket-book and slipped it into my
great-coat. Not daring to examine it
openly, I fingered it cautiously, and
felt the stiff softness of bank-notes. I
I was quite surprised to hear his voice
returning from a distance.
“As for my ticket,” he continued,
“that is a single from Wallingford to
the next station, Sadlington; it is two
years old. My season I keep inside
the lining of my hat.”
It was here that I returned the ticket
to his pocket. After all, I reflected, I
could pay at the other end with a very
small portion of the contents of the
pocket-book, which I reckoned must
contain at least half-a-dozen fivers.
“By the way,” he added, “I have a
passion for biscuits; will you join me
in one?” and he proffered a small tin.
“I eat so many of them,” he said, “that
I can write all my memoranda on the
slips of paper from the tins, and these
I keep in my pocket-book. My money I
keep next my season.”
It was here that I returned the
pocket-book. -

With branches sticking out of it, and

Is the old grey heart of the telegraph
pole stirred by these messages?"
I fancy not. -
Yet it all seems very strange;
And even stranger still, now that I
notice it,
Is the fact that the thing is after all
not absolutely naked,
For a short way up it, half obliterated

Discoloured and torn,
There is a paper affiche
Relating to swine fever.

the price of clothing; ” by
which hemeans, I suppose,
that West-End tailors long
ago nailed their high prices
to the mast-head.
In commending the Bill
for the continuance of
D.O.R.A., a remanet from
last Session, the ATTOR-
NEY-GENERAL was almost
apologetic. He laid much
stress upon the “modest
and attenuated form"
which the measure now
presented, and the short
time it was to remain in
force. Serious objection
was taken by the Irish
Members to the provision
that in districts where a
proclamationisinforce the
D.O.R.A. regulations, in-
stead of coming to an end
on August 31st, will con-
tinue for a year after the
end of the War. This they
naturally interpreted as a
means of continuing the
military government of
Ireland,acountry in which,
according to Mr. DEVI.IN,
the Government had as
much right as the Germans in Belgium.
The House, however, seemed to agree
with the Irish Attorney-General that in
the present state of Ireland it would
not be wise to dispense with the regu-
lations, and gave the Bill a second
reading by 219 votes to 61.
Then the House turned to the
discussion of the levy on capital.
The CHANCELLOR of THE
CHEQUER was still inexorably op-
posed to a general levy, but would
like a toll on war-wealth alone,
and proposed to set up a Com-
mittee to consider whether it was
practicable. Mr. ADAMSON frankly
declared that the Labour Party
was in favour of a capital levy, but
wanted to get at the war-profits
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN objected
to widening the scope of the in-
quiry on the ground that it would
take too long, and also that uncer-
tainty would promote extravagance
first.

Mr. BRIDGEMAN. Lord
SPENCER once delighted
the House of Commons
by announcing that he was
“not an agricultural la-

MAN similarly put it in a
good temper by admitting
that he had never himself
worked in a mine. But
he showed quite a suffici-
ent acquaintance with his
subject, and succeeded in
dispelling some of the fog
that enshrouds the figures
of coal - finance. The
miners, of course, objected
to the Bill on the ground
that it was not nationalis-
ation, but were left in a
very small minority.
A Private Members' de-
bate on the Housing Pro-
blem occupied the even-
ing. There was much
friendly criticism of the
MINISTER of HEALTH, for
whom Major LLoyd
GREAME suggested a motto
from the Koran :-
“This life is but a bridge;

much again when the United States
was ready to co-operate; but at present,
he reminded them, that country was
still in a state of war with Germany.
The one bright spot of the sitting
was Lord HYLToN's statement that the
National Debt, which was within a
fraction of eight thousand millions on
December 31st, had since been reduced
by eighty-five millions. The pace is
too good to last, but it is something to
have made a start.
For nearly four years we have been
anxiously waiting to know what really
did happen at the battle of Jutland.
The voluminous efforts of Admirals and
journalists have failed to clear up the
mystery, and even Commander CARLYon
BELLAIRs has not satisfied everybody
so completely as himself that his recent
work reveals the truth. But now the
official history is on the eve of publica-
tion and Mr. LoNG no longer feels it
necessary to keep the secret. Here it
is in his own words: “The moral of
the German fleet was very seriously
shaken.” What a relief
It seems that the Turks were in-
formed in advance of the intention of
the Peace Conference to let them stay
at Constantinople in the hope that they
would forthwith abandon their sanguin-
ary habits. Instead of which they
appear to have said to themselves,
“What a jolly day! Let us go out and
kill something—Armenians for choice.”
So now a further message has been sent
the trade-unions because he insisted
upon employing some of his old com-
rades-in-arms. -* ,
Mr. SExTon's rather maladroit at-
tempt to shift the blame on to the em-
ployers only deepened the impression
that trade-unionism is developing into a
system of caste, in which certain occu-
pations are reserved for certain people.
Only an elect bricklayer, for example,
may lay bricks—though anybody can
heave them—and the mere fact that a
man has shouldered a rifle in the ser-
vice of his country in no way entitles
him to carry a hod.
Thursday, February 19th.-The im-
pending advent of a Home Rule Bill is
greatly perturbing the little remnant of
Irish Nationalist Members, threatened
with the extinction of their pet griev-
ance. Although but seven in number
to them to the effect that the new title| Ş
to the old tenement is not absolute but lº
conditional, and that one of the coven-
ants forbids its use as a slaughterhouse.
A modest little Bill empowering the
Mint to manufacture coins worth some-
thing less than their weight in silver
aroused the wrath of Professor OMAN.
The last time, according to his account,
that the coinage was thus debased was
in the days of HENRY VIII., whose
views both on money and matrimony
were notoriously lax. Other Members
were friendly to the project, and Mr.
DENNIs HERBERT, in the avowed interest
of churchwardens, urged the Govern-
ment to seize the opportunity to abolish
the threepeeny - bit, the irreducible
minimum of “respectable "almsgiving.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER,
however, stoutly championed the elusive
little coin, for which he declared there
was “an immense demand.”
On Captain HAMBRO's motion de-
ploring the action of certain trade-
unions in refusing to admit ex-Service
men to their ranks the Labour Party
heard some very straight talking. The
whips of Lady Bonham-CARTER at
Paisley were nothing to the scorpions
of ex-Private HoPKINSON, who has

BUT THERE I AM ADAMANT.”
they made almost noise enough for
seventy. Question-time was punctuated
with their plaints. The CHIEF SECRE-
TARY did his best to soothe them, but his
remark that “no man in Ireland need
be in prison if he will obey the law”
poured oil on the flames.
Despite the reduction of the Question-
ration from eight to four per Member,
the House collectively grows “curiouser
and curiouser.” This is partly due to
the popularity of PREMIER - baiting,
now to be enjoyed on Mondays and
Thursdays. In future, Members are
to be further restricted to three Ques-
tions per diem; but no substantial relief
is to be hoped for until the House sets
up its own censorship, with power to
expunge all Questions that are trivial,
personal or put for purposes of self-
advertisement. Not many—a dozen or
two daily, perhaps—would survive the

gested by Mr. DE WALERA, is being

Together will root.

myself unable in these first full mo-

every-day affairs.
I can still remember that fresh sum-
mer morning when with springy step I
set out to call upon the District Con-
tract Agent for the first time. Inno-
cently enough I expected to arrange for
the installation of a telephone within
the next two or three days. But I re-
collect that as I ascended the steps of
his premises I became depressed by
that House of Usher foreboding, and
then, when I witnessed the way in
which an imperturbable official dis-
comfited a tempestuous gentleman
who was giving tongue to a long list of
his wrongs, my carefully rehearsed and

actually been fined at the instance of
resolute address shrivelled on my lips
scrutiny.

and I found myself asking tamely for a
form.
This form, plus the information that
telephones were more speedily installed
where ex-Service men were employed,
was the net result of my first encounter.
And now, as I turn in reminiscent
mood to a dusty file, I pause before one
of my early letters to the District Con-
tract Agent: “ . . . If you saw our
staff, who are without exception ex-
soldiers, you would say at once that
they are a remarkably fine body of men
and deserving of a telephone. They
mark their possessions with theirinitials
in indelible pencil. Between them they
| have seen service on every front, from
Mespot to Ireland. Some have been
mentioned in despatches, many have
figured in Cox's Book of Martyrs, and
our cashier says that he once opened a
tin of bully with the key provided for
that purpose. One of our juniors,
Major Bays Waller, O.B.E., who came
to us from a Control Office and who
advises us on our filing, says that it is
like coming from a home to a home.
You must come round and have a chat
with him; you would have so much in
common.
“Trusting that you will expedite the
little matter of our telephone installa-
tion, and assuring you that the spirit
of our staff continues to be excellent,
Although this letter was signed
“Henry Thomas, James & Sons,” the
District Contract Agent's vague reply
on the file before me commences: “Sir
(or Madam); ” and I feel now, as I
did then, that it is not in the best of
taste for him to brag as he does about
his telephone and his “Private Branch
Exchange" on the very paper on which
he writes to baffled applicants for in-
stallation.
From this time the correspondence is
marked by an increasing bitterness on
my side and a level colourlessness on
his. Only once did he assume the
offensive, which took the shape of a
demand for four pounds for possible
services to be rendered at some period
in the future. At Yuletide I hoped
that “during this season of goodwill he
would see his way to give instructions
for the installation of our telephone,”
and in the New Year I played once
more the ex-Service employees' card:—
“. . . Whatever views you may hold
on the policy of the withdrawal of
British troops from Russia, we are con-
vinced that you will sympathise with
our desire to extend a hearty welcome
to a member of our staff on his return
to this office from Murmansk ; and we
feel that, since he served with the R.E.
Signals, it would be a graceful compli-
ment to him if we had the telephone
your co-operation so that this may take

This form, plus the information that
telephones were more speedily installed
where ex-Service men were employed,
was the net result of my first encounter.
And now, as I turn in reminiscent
mood to a dusty file, I pause before one

did then, that it is not in the best of
taste for him to brag as he does about
his telephone and his “Private Branch
Exchange” on the very paper on which
he writes to baffled applicants for in-
stallation.
From this time the correspondence is
marked by an increasing bitterness on
my side and a level colourlessness on
his. Only once did he assume the
offensive, which took the shape of a
demand for four pounds for possible
services to be rendered at some period
in the future. At Yuletide I hoped
that “during this season of goodwill he
would see his way to give instructions

and in the New Year I played once

AT THE PLAY.
“JUST LIKE JUDY.”
IF the author of Just Like Judy will
look into that commodious classic, Mrs.
Beeton's Cookery Book, he will find a
formula for light pastry. And if he
will proceed to the (for him) enlivening
adventure of essaying a tartlet, he will
find that most fatal among a host of
fatal errors will be any failure to pre-
serve the due proportion of ingredients.
I do not suggest that there is as rigid
a formula for light comedy. But cer-
tainly Mr. DENNY threw in too many
unnecessary mystifications and crude
explanations in proportion to the wit,
wisdom and lively incident of his con-
ſection. In particular he was con-
stantly making some of his characters
tell the others what we of the audience
either already knew or quite easily
guessed. To exhaust my tedious-homely
metaphor, if you put in a double measure
of water the mixture will refuse to rise.
And that I imagine is essentially what
happened to Just Like Judy.
rish Judy, a charmingly pretty
busybody, outwardly just like Miss IRIs
Hoey, comes to Peter Keppel's studio
and hears that this casual youth has
got into a deplorable habit of putting
off his marriage with her friend Milly.
She (Judy) will see to that She
assumes the rôle of a notorious Chelsea
model, whom proper Peter has never
seen. Peter knocks his head on the
mantelpiece, just where a shrapnel
splinter had hit him, and is persuaded
that she, Judy McCarthy, affecting to
be Triarie O'Farrel, is his wife. It all
seems very horrible to him, but, shell-
shock or no shell-shock, he sets to
work to paint her portrait in a business-
like way, and at the end of four hours it
doesn't seem at all horrible. And by the
time it is explained that it was all a
joke (some people do have such a nice
sense of humour) he is all for rushing
off to the registry-office, Judy agreeing.
Not that Judy is a minx. She did
her level best to make two people who
obviously didn't love one another fulfil
their engagement, instead of, like a
sensible woman; accepting the inevit-
able, which was, as it happens, so con-
genial to her. What puzzled me was
Peter's indignation with poor Milly
when he found that she really didn't love
him (but, on the contrary, a bounder
called Crauford), yet couldn't bear to
cause him unhappiness, and was sacri-
ficing herself for him. As that was his
attitude precisely, I suppose he felt an-
noyed by this lack of originality. If
we men are like that, it wasn't nice of
Mr. DENNY to give us away.
At any rate I am sure Mr. DoNALD
|| the time.
| good indeed.
When he did he was very
When he didn't he was
horrid. Did Miss IRIs Hoey believe in
Judy? I am not so sure. I suspect not.
Did I believe in either ? I did not.
I was a little surprised that Miss
JoAN VIvi AN-REEs should so overplay
her Triarie. Her work is certainly in
general not like that, and I conjecture
the influence of some baleful autocrat
of a producer. It seemed to me that
Miss MILDRED EvelyN's Milly was, all
things considered, a capable and con-
sistent study of a desperately unsym-
pathetic character, a more difficult and
creditable feat than is commonly sup-
posed. - '1'.

of his musical trifle at the Comedy.
The idea of a company of women that
bans the society of men is at least as old
as the Attic stage. But it is to his
credit that though the theme invited
suggestiveness he at least avoided the
licence of The Lysistrata. Indeed there
were moments when his restraint filled
me with respectful wonder. Thus,
though the Pacific Island to which
the Junior Jumper Club retired—with
no male attendant but the Club porter
—clearly indicated a bathing scene, yet
we had to be satisfied with an occa-
sional glimpse of an exiguous maillot
with nobody inside it. -
In fact, the fun throughout had a
note of reserve and was never boister-
methods in the part of the Hon. Bill
Malcolm, universal philanderer, lent
themselves to this quality of under-
statement. In a scene where he tried
to extricate himself from a number of
coincident entanglements with various
members of the Club he was quite
amusing without the aid of italics.
Mr. GILBERT CHILDs, again, as Weekes
—Club porter and Admirable Crichton
of the island—though a little broader in
his style, was too clever to force the fun.
The other sex, as was natural with
women who affected a serious purpose,
had fewer chances, and Miss PHYLLIs
MonkMAN spoilt hers by a bad trick of
hunching her shoulders and waggling
her arms as if she were out for a
cake-walk on Montmartre.
There were touches of humour in
Mr. CUVILLIER's tuneful music and in
the limited movements of the best-
looking chorus that I have seen for a
long time.
As for the plot, it had at least the
merit of continuity and conformed to
the logic, seldom too severe, of this
kind of entertainment, as distinct from
the so-called revue. Nearly everything
was well within my intelligence, the
chief exception being the title; for
never surely did a wild-goose chase
offer such easy sport. The birds were
just asking to be put into the bag.
I should myself have preferred, out
of compliment to the chorus, to call
the play “Wild Ducks,” only, of
course, IBSEN had been there before.
Not that this would have greatly trou-
bled an author who showed so little
regard for the proprietary rights of
ARIstoph ANEs and Sir JAMES BARRIE.

His career as midshipman.
'Twas not in the least degree
Vulgar curiosity
Urging him to ask the reason
Why, both in and out of season:
'Twas but keenness; all he lacked
Was a saving sense of tact.
Once the Lieut. of Ernie's watch,
Dour, meticulous and Scotch,
Thought he'd show the timid snotty
(Newly joined) exactly what he
Wanted when inspecting men.
Closely Ernest watched, and then
Said, saluting, “Sir, I note
Several creases in your coat,
And I see upon your trouser
Signs of paint-work; yet just now,
Sir,
Did you not think fit to blame
One poor man who had the same?"
Ere that outraged Lieut. replied
Suddenly our hero spied
Coming aft, his labours done,
Our benignant Number One
(Most abstemious is he,
And, in fact, a strict T.T.,
But—it shows how Fate can blunder—
No one could be rubicunder).
Ernest, after one swift glance,
Said, “Excuse my ignorance,
But, Sir, can you tell me why
You are always red, while I,
Even when I drink a lot,
Only flush if I am hot 2"
Just as Number One grew pale
And collapsed against the rail,
Striving grimly not to choke,
Ernest heard the busy Bloke
Calling loudly, “Let her go!”
To a seaman down below;
“Fool! the cutter's bound to ram you,
Push the pinnaceforrard, damn you!”
Ernest shook his youthful head
And he very gently said
Into his Commander's ear,
“You forget yourself, I fear.
May I ask what you would do
If I used that word to you ?
Is it worthy, Sir, of an
Officer and gentleman?”
Aft ran little Ernest, only
Pausing when he saw a lonely
Figure bright with golden lace
Who appeared to own the place.
“Ah!” thought Ernie, “I know you;
You're the luckless Captain who
(Though you hadn't then a beard)
Most unwillingly appeared
But a year ago or less
In the Illustrated Press." '
Crossing to the Captain's side
Of the sacred quarterdeck—
“How did you contrive the wreck
Of the cruiser you commanded
When she bumped the beach and
stranded ?”
You may say, “He is so brave he
Ought some day to rule the Navy.”
Certainly he ought, but still
I'm afraid he never will;
For they talked to him so gruffly
And they handled him so roughly
That, when he was fit to drop
And the kindly Bloke said, “Stop!
Or you'll make him even madder;
He is wiser now and sadder,"
Ernest simply answered, “Ay, Sir,
You have made me sad; but why,
Sir 2" -

“I wonDER,” said Mary for the third
time, “if we shall catch the tram at the
| other end.”
“Calmness,” I told her—this for the
second time—“is the essence of com-
fortable travel. Meeting trouble half-
way—” -
“It isn't half-way,” she said indig-
mantly. “We’re nearly there.”
We were on a bus whose “route"
terminated some five miles from home,
which we proposed to reach by a tram,
and, the hour being late, it was our
chances of catching a car that were
worrying Mary. .
“Never get flurried,” I went on. “If
people would only go ahead calmly
and steadily . . . What causes half
our traffic congestion ? Flurry. What
makes it so difficult to move quickly in
the streets 2 Flurry. What is it clogs
the wheels of progress everywhere?"
“Don't tell me,” she implored. “Let
me guess. Flurry.” *
“Exactly,” I said, and at this point
we reached our terminus. Two trams
were waiting, one behind the other,
some thirty yards away, and, as we
descended the steps of the bus, the bell
of the first one rang warningly. Mary
would have started running, but I
detained her.
“Flurrying again,” I said indul-
gently. “Here are two trams, but of
course you must have the first one,
however full it is,” and I led her to-
wards the second. As I expected, it
was quite empty, and I was still using
it to point my moral when its conductor
began juggling with the pole. It was
then that I realised that, though on
the down lines, this car was going no
further. It was, in fact, turning round
for its journey back to London, while
in the distance the rear lights of our
last down tram seemed to wink a de-
There was nothing for it but to go
ahead calmly and steadily, and we did
so. It was somewhere about the end
of the fourth mile that Mary asked
suddenly:—
“What was it you said clogged the
wheels of progress everywhere?”
“Flurry,” I said feebly.
“Well, I think it's blisters,” she
said. -
FILM NOTES.
Those who are still inclined to ques-
tion whether the cinema is to be re-
garded as a serious force in the realm
of Art should not only read the frequent
contributions to The Times and other
newspapers on this department of the
drama, but should bear in mind that
quite recently it has been stated that
both the Rev. SILAs K. HockING and
Mr. JACK DEMPSEY have taken part in
photo-plays. It cannot be doubted that
the peculiar talent required for making
the heart of the people throb is being
revealed in the most unlikely places.
- -*- ×:
If proof were needed that the art of
the film is a dangerous rival to that of
the stage, we would point to the five-
reel drama, The Call of the Thug, of
which a private trade view was given
last week. Miss Flora Poudray, who
is here featured—her name is new to
us—proves to be a screen actress of
superb gifts. . We have seen nothing
quite so subtly perfect as her gesture
of dissent when the villain proposes
that he and she together should strangle
the infant heir to the millionaire woollen
merchant on the raft during the thun-
der-storm. Patrons of the cinema will
do well to look out for this delicate yet
moving passage. The film will be re-
leased as early as November, 1921.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE publishers of Peter Jackson : Cigar Merchant (HUT-
CHINsoN) seem in their announcements to be desperately
afraid lest anyone should guess it to be a War book. It is,
they suggest, the story of the flowering of perſect love
between two harried folk who had drifted apart. It is
really an admirable epitome of the War as seen through
one pair of eyes and one particular temperament. I don't
recall another War novel that is so convincing. The almost
incredible confusions of the early days of the making of
K.'s army; the gradual shaping of the great instrument;
the comradeship of fine spirits and the intrigues of meaner;
leadership good and less good; action with its energy,
glory and horror; reaction (with incidentally a most moving
analysis of the agonies of shell-shock and protracted neuras-
thenia) after the long strain of campaigning—all this is
brought before you in the most vivid manner. Mr. GILBERT
FRANKAU writes with a fierce sincerity and with perhaps
the defects of that sincerity—a bitterness against the non-
combatant which was not usual in the fighting-man, at
least when he was fighting; or perhaps it was only that
they were too kind then to say so. Also as “one of us.”
he is a little overwhelmed by the sterling qualities of the
rank-and-file—qualities which ought, he would be inclined to
assume, to be the exclusive product of public-school playing-
fields. I haven't said that Peter Jackson gave up cigars and
share for a small-holding when the War was done. A jolly
interesting book.
I found the arrangement of The Clintons and Others
(CoLLINs) at first a little confusing, because Mr. ARCHIBALD
MARSHALL, instead of keeping his Clinton tales consecutive,
has mixed them democratically with the Others. Our first
sight of the family (and incidentally the most agreeable
thing in the volume) is provided by “Kencote,” a brightly-
coloured and engaging anecdote of Regency times, and of
the plucking of an honoured house from the ambiguous
patronage of the First Gentleman in Europe. I found this
delightful, spirited, picturesque and original. Thence we
pass to the Others, to the theme (old, but given here with a
pleasant freshness of circumstance) of maternal craft in
averting a threatened mésalliance, to a study of architecture
in its effect upon character, to a girls' school tale; finally
to the portrait of a modern Squire Clinton, struggling to
adjust his mind to the complexities of the War. This
last, a character-study of very moving and sympathetic
realism, suffers a little from a defect inherent in one of Mr.
MARSHALL's best qualities, his gift for absolutely natural
dialogue. The danger of this is that, as here in the bed-
room chatter of the Squire's daughters, his folk are apt to
repeat themselves, as talk does in nature, but should not
(I suppose) in art. Still this is a small defect in a book
that is sincere in quality and convincingly human in effect.
The Clintons and Others is certainly miles away from the

books of short stories into poor repute, Mr. MARSHALL
and Others (a select band) will rapidly correct this by giving
us in small compass work equal to their own best.
Shuttered Doors (LANE) is what you might call a third-
and-fourth-generation story—one of those books, so rightly
devastating to the skipper, in which the accidental turning
of two pages together is quite liable to involve you with
the great-grandchildren of the couple whose courtship you
have been perusing. Observe that I was careful to say the
“accidental” turning, though I can picture a type of reader
who might soon be fluttering the pages of Shuttered Doors
in impatient handfuls. The fact is that Mrs. WILLIAM Hicks
BEACH has here written what is less a novel than a treatise,
tasteful, informed and sympathetic, on county life and
manners and houses. The last of these themes especially
has an undisguised fascination for her. When Aletta, the
chief heroine, was left pots of money by a Dutch uncle (who
was so far from filling his proverbial rôle that he hardly
talked at all) she spent it and her enthusiasm, indeed her
existence, in restoring two variously dilapidated mansions
—Graythorpes, her husband's home, and Doller Place, left
her by an appreciative aunt. When not thus employed she
In Memories of a Marine (MURRAY) Major-General Sir
GEORGE ASTON records for us, cosily and anecdotally, a life
spent in service, not only of the active kind—in Egypt and
South Africa—but also as a Staff College Professor, and,
more intriguingly, as an expert in Secret Intelligence in
the cloisters of Whitehall or up and down the Mediterranean.
If his book is not so sensational in the matter of revelations
as the current fashion requires, it has a restful interest all
its own, varied here and there with some very attractive
stories. To give just one example, the author, when setting
out to co-ordinate the work of various authorities in a
certain harbour, found a signal buoy, a torpedo station, a
fixed mine and a boom, each under separate control, all in-
cluded in the defences. But the torpedo could not be
launched unless the buoy were first cleared away, and the
mine, if fired, would blow up the boom. One would have
welcomed more of this sort of thing, for the truth is that
even restfulness may be overdone and discretion become
almost too admirable. Occasionally too the writer enlarges
a little on—well, he enlarges a little, as anyone would with
half his provocation. Still, for all comrades of his service,
at any rate, every word he has written will be of interest;
and perhaps he does not really mind so much about the

Homes (given here in extenso),
or comparing those of other
| persons with her own. I don't
want you to get the impres-
sion that Shuttered Doors is
precisely arid; it is too full of
ideas and vitalities for that ;
but it does undoubtedly de-
mand a special kind of reader.
Incidentally, Mrs. H Icks

ology. For Aletta, who was
married at twenty-eight and

the staff of the Viceroy of

The Specials (HEINEMANN)

and it would have been a

Do not allow yourself to be misled by the fact that the
portrait c.) the paper cover of Maureen (JENKINs) does, I
admit, remarkably suggest a lady whose mission in life is
the advertisement of complexion soap. You probably know
already that the methods of Mr. PATRICK MACGILL are made
of sterner stuff. This “Story of Donegal,” which I have
no intention of giving in detail, is the history of the course
of true love in an Irish village, full of types which, I dare
say, are realistically observed; verbose in places to an
almost infuriating degree (not till page 61 does the heroine
so much as put her nose round the scenery), but working up
to a climax of considerable power. Maureen, I need hardly
say, was as fair as moonrise, but suffered from the draw-
back of an irregular origin, which took the poor girl a great
deal of living down. Nor need I specify the fact that most
of the male characters in the district are soon claimants for
her hand. Really this is the plot. Having betrayed so
much, however, nothing shall persuade me to expose the
bogie scenes on the midnight moor, where the villain com-
bines his illicit whiskey manufacture with his courtship,
and where finally the three protagonists come by a startling
finish. Maureen is not a story that I should recommend save
for readers with abundant leisure; but those whose pluck
and endurance carry them to the kill will certainly have
Colonel REAY rightly he doesn't wish bouquets to be thrown
at the Specials, but he would not, I think, discourage me
from saying that they performed dangerous and ticklish
work with unfailing resource and tact. All of us know
that they desire no other reward for their services than the
satisfaction of having done their duty; but our gratitude
demands to be heard; and I for one take this occasion to
trumpet forth the “All clear" signal with feelings of
affectionate pride.
If By Way of Bohemia (SKEFFINGTON) is a fair sample of
Mr. MARK ALLERTON's work I have been missing a number
of very readable stories. His hero, Hugh Kelvin, a journalist
(they must be rare) who had no very good conceit of him-
self, married a barmaid, and she ran his house as if it were
a third-class drinking saloon. She was one of those women
who for want of a better word we call impossible; but she
found Hugh as unsatisfactory as he found her. In the cir-
cumstances the union had to be dissolved, and, although I
suspect Mr. ALLERTON's tongue of being very near his cheek
when he contrived Hugh's escape from a life of sordid
misery, I admit that his solution of the difficulty is cleverly
told. And, after all, coincidences do happen in real life,
and it would be unfair to Providence to suppose that they
were not put there for a useful purpose.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAISLEY TO THE RESCUE OF
THE COALITION.
(The PRIME MINISTER to Mr. AsqviTH).
WELCOME, for Old Long Since's sake,
Home to your ancient seat
It needed only this to make
My cup of joy complete;
The weary waiting time is past;
The yawning vacuum is mended;
And here we have you back at last—
Oh, HERBERT, this is splendid
As one whose wisdom overflows
With human nature's lore,
You know they make the keenest foes
Who have been friends before;
We loved as only Liberals do
Until their rival sabres rattle
And Greek joins Greek (like me and
you)— -
Then is the tug of battle.
As an old Parliamentary hand
Familiar with the ropes,
Those perils you will understand
With which a Premier copes
Whose big battalions run to seed,
Having indulged a taste for slacking,
And let their muscles moult for need
Of foemen worth the whacking.
Such was my case. By habit's use
They still obeyed the whip,
But loyal zeal grew limp and loose
And things were left to rip;
I had no hope to stay the rot
And fortify their old affections
(Save for the stimulus they got
From losing by-elections).
Daily I took, to keep me fit,
My tonic in The Times;
Daily recovered tone and grit
Reading about my crimes;
But one strong foe is what we lack
To put us on our best behaviour;
That's why in you I welcome back
The Coalition's saviour. O. S.
AUCTION IN THE SPAGIOUS TIMES.
“It is Our Royal pleasure to will and
declare one diamond,” said the VIRGIN
QUEEN, when the Keeper of the Privy
Purse had arranged her hand for her.
Sir WALTER RALEIGH, who sat on her
left, was on his feet in a twinkling.
“Like to like, 'twas ever thus,” he
murmured, bowing low to his Sovereign.
“I crave leave to call two humble
clubs, as becometh so mean a subject
of Your Majesty.” It is not known
whether his allusion to the QUEEN's call
was intended to refer to the diamond
rings upon HER MAJESTY's fingers or to
the scintillating glint in HER MAJESTY's
eyes, but she inclined her head graci-
ously in acknowledgment of his re-
marks before turning to her partner.
TER 2" she asked. “Wilt support a poor
weak woman 2" His Lordship, how-
ever, looked down his noble nose and
said nothing for quite a long time. He
found himself, to use a vulgar phrase, in
the consommé. His hand contained the
ace, king and six other spades, nothing
to write home about in hearts or clubs,
and one small diamond. To take from
his partner the right to play the hand
would be the act of a fool—the mere
thought made him raise a hand to his
neck as though to assure himself of its
continuity. Even failure to support
her call would be looked on as un-
gallant, if nothing worse.
“How now, sirrah” Art sleeping in
Our presence?” prompted the QUEEN
sharply. -
The EARL swallowed noisily once or
twice, just to show that he was awake,
and then plunged.
“An it please you, Madam, two
diamonds,” he muttered, with but a
sorry show of his habitual arrogance.
“Double!” said Sir FRANÇis DRAKE
in crisp seamanlike tones, whereat the
Earl of LEICESTER was seen to fumble
for the hilt of his rapier.
“Stay, my Lord,” his liege com-
manded; “’tis true the Knight hath left
his manners in Devonshire, or on the
Spanish main mayhap, but keep your
brawl for an hour and place more fitting.
| We redouble.”
A momentary silence followed the
QUEEN's discourse, cut short by the un-
couth ejaculation “'Ods fish ' " which
escaped from Sir FRANCIS apparently
without his consent. He embarked on
an apology at once, based on the fact
that he was but an honest sailor; but,
meeting with no encouragement, he
gave it up and fell to sucking his teeth.
Sir WALTER meanwhile made good
use of the interval to perfect a flower of
speech signifying, in a manner worthy
a courtier of his reputation, that he
was content. His effort drew from the
QUEEN a glance as nearly approaching
the “glad eye” as any that august
spinster was ever known to dispense.
The Laird of Kenilworth announced
that he also was content; but historians
should accept the statement with re-
serve. Sir FRANCIs either wasn't sure
whether the rules of the game aliowed
him to double again, or else had just
enough tact not to do so. The game
then proceeded.
Sir WALTER led the ace of clubs.
The appearance of the noble lord's
solitary little diamond, as he laid down
his hand, was greeted by a loud hic-
cough from the old salt, and the QUEEN
herself was only saved from swooning
by the timely administrations of a page
with a flask of sal-volatile.
the honest sailor's ace, her partner had
the hardihood to make conventional
inquiry as to whether she had any
clubs. HER MAJESTY uttered in reply
the one dreadful word, “Treason,” thus
avoiding with true statesmanship any
direct answer to the question, and in-
dicating clearly her opinion of his two-
diamond call. The Keeper of the
Privy Purse shot out a lean hand and
gathered in the trick.
With the help of the ace of spades
in dummy, the ace of hearts in her own
hand, and a discriminating use of her
Royal prerogative in the matter of ſol-
lowing suit, all went well until the odd
trick Had been won. After that, how-
ever, Sir FRANCIS, who had not doubled
without good reason, proceeded to deal
outsix diamonds,led by the ace, king and
queen. His partner unwisely allowed
his feelings to get the better of him.
“As WILL SHAkspeaRE hath it,” he
observed with unction, “‘now is the
winter of our discontent made glorious
Sunninet ''' but stopped on a sudden,
with ears and scalp twitching horribly.
“Ho without! Summon the guard ſ”
roared the last of the Tudors, and imme-
diately an N.C.O. and six private beef-
eaters appeared on the scene. “Convey
Our compliments to the Governor of
the Tower,” she continued, addressing
the N.C.O., “and bid him confine the
Earl of LEICESTER during Our pleasure.
My Lord,” she added, turning to her
luckless partner," "twere well, methinks,
you should have leisure in which to
reflect on the folly of trifling with a
woman.” -
It is greatly to the EARL's credit that
at this point he made strenuous endea-
vours to surrender his sword in accord-
ance with the drill-book, but as it re-
fused to come out of its scabbard he
was obliged to unbutton the frog from
his belt and hand over the weapon
complete with leather gear. This for-
mality achieved, he was led away to
durance vile.
Sir FRANCIS, poor fellow, fared scarcely
better than the Earl. “Begone to sea,
Sir Knight,” hissed the QUEEN; “may-
hap the Dons will teach you more be-
coming manners. Begone, I say, and
look to 't your ships return not empty,

THE “rockerty - tockerty-tock” re-
frain of the carriage-wheels below me
changed into a jarring whine as the
train came to a full stop. I looked out
on a dim-lit platform which seemed to
be peopled only by a squad of milk-
cans standing shoulder to shoulder like
Noah's Ark soldiers.
As the engine shrieked and plunged
into its collar again the door was
jerked open and a man projected him-
self into the carriage and, opening the
window so that the compartment was
flooded with cold air, leaned out and
resumed his conversation with a friend
till the train bore him out of shouting
range. He then pulled up the window,
trod on my foot, sat on my lap and
eventually came to rest on the seat
opposite me.
It was a small man, red of head and
bright of eye. He wore his cap at the
back of his head, so as to exhibit to an
admiring world a carefully - cultured
curl of the “quiff” variety, which was
plastered across his forehead with a
great expenditure of grease. His tie
red, green, blue and purple, and from
his glittering watch-chain hung many
fanciful medals, like soles upon a line.
“Brother-in-law to me,” he remarked,
jerking his thumb towards the back-
rushing lights of Exeter.
“Who?” I inquired.
“That young feller I was talking to
just now. Didn't you see me talking
to a young feller?”
“Oh, yes, I believe I did hear you
talking to somebody.”
“Well, him. Married a sister to me,
so he's my brother-in-law, ain't he ”
“Certainly.”
“Well, you're wrong then. He's
only a half-brother-in-law, because she
is only a half-sister to me, her ma
marrying my old man. Understand?”
I said I did and pulled up my rug as
a signal that I was going to sleep and
the conversation was at an end.
“Anyhow, whatever he is, he's good
enough for her.”
I remarked that that was most sat-
isfactory and closed my eyes.
He drew out a yellow packet of
cigarettes, selected one and held them
in my direction. I declined and again
“Very good, please yourself, it's one
more for little Willie. All I can say is
that you're foolish not taking a good
fag when it don't cost you nothing.
You don't catch me refusing a free fag
even when I don't want to smoke. I
takes it and puts it in my cap for when
I do. Pounds I've saved that way,
pounds and pounds.”
He lit his limp tube of paper and
mystery, stamped out the match and
spat deliberately on the floor.
“See me do that ?”
I nodded with as much disgust as I
could contrive.
“Know what them notices say I can
get for that? Fined or imprisoned.”
He paused for me to marvel at his
daring.
“Think I'm mad to take risks like
that, don't cher ? Well, I aren't neither.
They couldn't catch me out, not they.”
He brushed some ash off his lap on
to mine and winked sagely.
“Suppose the guard was to come in
here and start fining and imprisoning
me for it, do you know what I'd do?
I'd swear you did it.”
“But I should deny it,” I retorted

“Of course you would, old chum,
and I shouldn't blame you neither, but
you wouldn't stand no chance against
me”—he leaned forward and tapped
me on the knee as though to emphasize
his words—"I could lie your life away.”
He sank back in his seat, his face
aglow with conscious superiority. The
clamour of the wheels increased as if
they were live things burning with the
fever of some bloodthirsty hunt. .
“Firing her up,” said the red, man;

“Engine-driving, of course. I'm on

He rattled off into technicalities of
his trade, embroidered with tales of
hair-bristling adventures and escapes.
“Yes, old chum, there's more in our

“It was so much the worse for the

“Worse for the cow 2"
“So GEORGE STEPHENson said, and

The little man stared at me, his
mouth open; for once he seemed bereft
of words. We had slowed to a mo-

pulled out again before he regained
control of his tongue, then he broke
loose.

WIZARDS: KLINGSOR AND ANOTHER.
“ANoTHER Parsifal ought to be written from the angle
of Klingsor, who was an enlightened Arabian, physician,
scientist and probably Aristotelian . . . The Knights, and
Wagner with them, call him a wizard, which was a crude
mediaeval way of “slanging' any man who preferred know-
ledge to superstition.” -
This remarkable utterance by the musical critic of The
Daily Mail in the issue of February 25th has created a
sensation in the political world fully equal to that caused
by the announcement of Mr. AsquitH's return for Paisley.
Scientific and artistic circles have also been deeply moved.,
Sir PHILIP SAssoon, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's new secre-
tary, interviewed by our representative, said that the
tribute to his chief was all the more welcome considering
its source. His only criticism was that, instead of calling
the charge of wiza, dry a “crude mediaeval” mode of invec-
tive, he should prefer to style it an ultra-modern applica-
tion of the art of obloquy. -
Sir OLIVER Lodge, in a wireless message from New York,
entirely approved of The Daily Mail's reading of KLING-
soft's character. He was clearly a scientist and a spiritualist
of remarkable attainments. The defection of Iſundry to
the side of the Knights was a sad instance—but not with-
| out modern parallels—of the unrelenting pressure exerted
on weak women by the zealots of orthodoxy.
Mr. A. B. WALKLEY said that he had long suspected
KLiNgson of being a crypto-Aristotelian, but the arguments
of the writer in The Daily Mail had converted his suspic-
ion to a certainty. He proposed to deal with the matter
more fully in an imaginary dialogue between KLING soft and
Sir Oswald Stoll, (who was a devout follower of HERBERT
SPENCER) which would shortly appear in The Times.
Mr. DEVANT professed himself delighted with the vindi-
cation of KLINGsor, who was undoubtedly, like Roger
BAcos, a first-rate conjurer, far in advance of his time, and
with limited resources was yet capable of producing illusions
which would not have disgraced the stage of St. George's
Hall. -
The Archbishop of CANTERBURY excused himself from
pronouncing a definite opinion on the subject, but pointed
out that it would doubtless come within the purview of the
inquiry into Spiritualism undertaken by high clerical
authority. -
Mr. j.com Erstein made the gratifying announcement
that he was engaged on a colossal statue of Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE in the character of the modern Merlin. His treat-
ment might not commend itself to the leaders of Noncon-
formity in Wales, but his own artistic conscience was clear,
and he felt he could count on the benevolent sympathy of
the Northcliffe Press. -
The Editor of The Times strongly demurred to the state-|-
ment that KLINGson was an Arabian. The great authority
on KLINGsor was the anonymous thirteenth-century epic
poem on Lohengrin, the father of Parsifal, and he had no
doubt (1) that the author was either a Czecho-Slovak or a
Yugo-Slav; (2) that KLINGsor, as the etymology suggested,
was of the latter race. In these circumstances the attempt
to establish an affinity between Mr. LLoyd GEORGE and
KLINGsor was nothing short of an outrage, which might
have disastrous results on our relations with the new States
of Central Europe. - -
Mr. J. MAYNARD REYNE3 observed that the character-
isation of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, implicit in the defence of
IKLINGsor made by the musical critic of The Daily Mail,
indirectly confirmed his own impressions. It was true that
the PREMIER did not physically resemble an Arab sheikh,
say nothing of geography, was decidedly jejune, but the sad
case of President WILSON made it all too clear that he was
capable of exerting a hypnotic influence on his colleagues.
Mr. KEYNEs did not think Mr. LLoyd GEORGE was an
Aristotelian; he preferred to consider him an unconscious
Pragmatist. This view he proposed to develop in his
forthcoming volume on the Subliminal Conscience of
Nonconformity.

SUZANNE'S BANKING ACC0UNT.
“THESE want paying,” said Suzanne
as she bounced into my nominally sacred
den at a strictly prohibited hour. There-
with she thrust a dossier of tradesmen's
bills into my feebly-resisting hands, and
bang went an idea I had been tenderly
nursing since breakfast.
“But I can't spend the rest of the
morning writing cheques,” I protested.
“I’m engaged just now on a most im-

“With your eyes shut," commented

“They're mostly small items; for in-
stance, Madame Pillby—she's the little
dressmaker round the corner, you know;

“Suzanne, I will not write a cheque

Suzanne. “I've always wanted to have
a cheque-book of my own, but Father
thought it unsexing. Do let's go and
take out the licence at once.”.
The precious hour of fertilisation was
already wasted, so there and then I
escorted Suzanne to the Bank. At my

it. By the time she had finished she
had trespassed into several columns
reserved for entirely different uses. The
Manager surveyed the effect with con-
sternation.
“Rather a long name, isn't it?” he
asked diffidently. “I was only wonder-
ing if our cheque-forms would accommo-
date it all.”
“Well, I'm not really responsible for
it all,” she replied. “The Trumpington-
Jones part is the more or less permanent
result of a serious accident when I was
little more than a child. But I might
shorten it a bit. I sometimes answer
to the name of Soozles, but I suppose
that would only do for really intimate
cheques. How would ‘S. Beverley
T.-Jones' do? I shouldn't like to lose
the ‘Beverley' as it's a kind of family
heirloom, and I always use it, even when
I'm writing to the sweep.”
I edged away to the window and left
them to settle the signature question
among themselves.
“And what kind of cheques would
you like—"Order’ or ‘Bearer’?” I
next heard the Manager asking.
“Show me some patterns, please,”
commanded Suzanne.
On the wall was a frame containing
a number of different cheque varieties,
“Haven't you any other colours?”
she asked. “I thought a black-and-
yellow cheque would be rather becom-
ing; but don't bother about it if it's
not in stock.”
She ended by taking one book of blue
and one of purple cheques, and with
these and a paying-in-book (which she
said would do so nicely for spills) we
at last departed. From behind the
closed door of the private office I dis-
tinctly heard a prolonged sigh of relief.
A few days later I came upon Suzanne
sitting at her writing-table and examin-
ing a cheque with a mystified air.
“Anything wrong?” I asked.
“I don't quite know,” she replied.
“I sent Angela this cheque the other
day to pay for my ticket for the Law-
Courts' Revel, and she says the Bank
people have returned it to her. And
it's marked ‘R. D." in red ink. Who
is R. D.’ ” ”
“He’s the gentleman who censors
cheques; and he has a way of dis-
qualifying them when there's not
enough cash to pay them. Suzanne,
what have you done with all that
money I paid into your account last
Monday ?”
“But I've only paid those footling
little bills. There must be tons of
money left, unless the Bank's been
“Let me have a look at that cheque,”
I said.
She handed it to me and I examined
it carefully.
“I see it's signed ‘Thine, Suzanne.’”
“But that's how I always sign my-
self to Angela,” she said; “and the
Manager distinctly told me to use my
customary signature.”
“Signature—not signatures,” I ex-
plained gently. “They're rooted in
convention at the Bank and can't bear
the least approach to variety. And
what's this scribbled on the back of
it 2 ''
“Oh, that's only a note I dashed off
to Angela telling her what I was going
to wear. It seemed such a pity to
waste a sheet of notepaper when there
was all that space to spare.”
I gave her a quarter-of-an-hour's
lesson in the art of drawing cheques.
Then I took up the paying-in book
which was lying on the table. I knew
it ought to be in a virgin state as I had
added nothing to the entrance-money.
“And what might all these figures por-
tend ?” I asked.
“Those ? Oh, that's baby's weight-

had been a great success—“it was
the only city in the country in which
a man could buy a bottle of whisky
to take home.”
Wednesday, February 25th.-Ques-
tion-time in the Commons was domin-
ated by the news that Mr. Asquith was
in for Paisley, and Members were more
concerned in discussing the effect of
his return upon the Government and
Opposition than in listening to Minis-
terial replies. Sir DoNALD MACLEAN
was “all smiles” over his approach-
ing release from the responsibilities of
leadership; but Mr. Hogg|E, I thought,
looked rather like Mrs. Gummidge when
“thinking of the old 'un."
A nod from Mr. MACPHERson and
the Government of Ireland Bill was
formally and silently introduced —
strange contrast to the long debates and
exciting scenes that attended the birth
of the Bill's three predecessors in 1886,
1893 and 1912. . . - -
Sir RoPERT HoRNE explained with
his usual clarity and persuasiveness
the new Unemployment Insurance Bill.
The debate on it was interrupted to
allow the discussion of a motion by Sir
J. REMNANT advocating the increase of
police pensions to meet the present cost
of living. The police are, with good
reason, very popular with the House.
In vain the HoME SECRETARY pointed
out that the Government even in this
cause did not feel justified in “out-
running the constable.” Forgetting all
their recent zeal for economy Members
trooped into the Bobbies' Lobby and
beat the Government by 123 to 57.
The idea that Irishmen, however
much they may dislike British rule,
never miss an opportunity of raiding
the British Treasury, has received a
rude shock. Captain REDMOND, in-
quiring about the allocation of a sum
of a quarter-of-a-million for reconstruc-
tion in Ireland, was surprised to learn
that ten thousand pounds had been
allotted to his own constituency, but
not claimed. Mr. DEVLIN supplied the
key to the mystery: “The reason it
was not asked for was because we did
not know it was there.” -
I learn from Who's Who 2 that the
recreations of Sir ALFRED Mond include
“golf, motoring and all forms of sport.”
It must have been with keen regret,
therefore, that he felt himself compelled
to refuse facilities for cricket in Hyde
Park, owing to the risk to the public.
Wiscount CURzoN asked if cricket was
more dangerous than inflammatory
speeches. But the FIRST CoMMIssionER,
speaking no doubt from personal ex-
perience, expressed the view that there
was considerably more danger from a
cricket-ball.
on the Constantinople debate. If they
had waited till Monday, as originally
arranged, they could have trained their
big gun from Paisley on to the Govern-
ment entrenchments. Through insist-
ing on the earliest possible date, they
had to content themselves with the far
lighter artillery of Sir DoNALD MACLEAN.
Much, however, was hoped from Lord
Robert CECIL, who was believed to be
heavily charged with high explosives.
But before he could come into range
up jumped Sir Edward CARson, and
in a few brief sentences pointed out
that until the PRIME MINISTER had told
them the grounds for the decision to
leave the Turk his capital, and the
conditions under which he was to stay
there, the House was talking in the air.
Members thereupon clamoured for the
“Whether a portrait is a work of art depends
on the artist and not on the subject painted.”

Pictures.
PRIME MINISTER, who accordingly had
to make his defence when he had heard
only half the indictment, and to expend
most of the ammunition he had pre-
pared for Lord Robert, including some
remarkable specimens of the “deadly
parallel,” before receiving his adver-
sary's fire.
That in turn rather upset Lord
RoBERT's plan of campaign, and he was
not much more destructive than Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN had been. The House
as a whole seemed satisfied that the
Allies had done their best with a
problem for which there is no perfect
solution, and that there was at least a
chance that the SULTAN would find the
guns of an international fleet pointing
at his palace windows a strong in-
centive to good behaviour.

A FANCY BIRD.
WHEN any friend of mine is in
trouble I always make a point of writ-
ing and asking if there is anything I
can do. As a rule there isn't, but it
is a satisfaction to me to know I have
made the offer. When I heard that
Filmer was leaving his spacious house
and grounds at Hampstead, selling
half his furniture and moving into a
third storey flat at Battersea, I wrote
at once. I received in reply one of
his usual barely decipherable scrawls:
“Yes, old dear, you might find a home
for my raven; it's ancient and a bit
rusty, but lots of life in it yet. I'm
parting with all my garden things.”
I busied myself about the matter at
once. When a man you have known
and respected for years is driven by
high prices and income-tax to vacate
a beautiful home and asks such a
simple thing of you as to find a shelter
for his bird, you like to do your best.
Personally I knew nothing of ravens,
but I recognized the inadequacy of my
garden for the accommodation of a
bird of any kind, therefore I could not
think of taking it. Put I had a sur-
face acquaintance with the owner of a
carriage drive, and I approached him
without delay. He was cold in his
manner and said with so many calls
upon him he could not see his way
to contribute towards the expense of
| Filmer's move, although he had no
| doubt, from my representation, that it
| was a deserving case.
The misunderstanding arose from my
leading up to the object of my visit
gradually instead of coming to the point
at once and asking him to give a com-
fortable home to a raven. When I
explained further he unbent and said
he would think it over.
Later he wrote:—
Re RAven.
“DEAR SIR,--I have consulted an
authority on this bird and find that its
bad character has brought about its
practical extinction in this country save
in the mountain fastnesses of Wales
and the craggy moors of Yorkshire.
I also learn that its extended wings
measure thirty-six inches on an aver-
age. I must decline to provide an
asylum for such an extensive mass of
depravity.”
I confess I was discouraged and
also somewhat shocked. I felt Filmer
should have enlightened me more on
the characteristics of his protégé. The
episode taught me to avoid preamble
in my next quest for a domicile. Also
I thought it only right to express
myself with absolute frankness. The

“Madam,” I said, “may I ask you

She looked startled for a moment
and then quietly closed the door.
I was still further discouraged.
I
felt bound in honour to comply, if
possible, with Filmer's comparatively
simple request. By chance Iran across
Timberley, a man brimful of resource
and suggestion. “You want a brewery,”
he said; “that's the milieu for a raven.
To my mind no brewery is artistically
complete without one. A raven hop-
ping about the casks gives a je ne sais
quoi, a cachet, to the premises. You
should get an introduction to a
manager.” -
With some difficulty I did, and I
waited upon him in his private office.
He seemed immersed in business and
to remain standing.
“I must apologise fortrespassing upon
your valuable time, but it has been sug-
gested to me that no brewery is com-
plete without a raven——” I began,
stammering slightly from nervousness.
“Well, we've got one. What about
it 2 " he said.
In face of this unlooked-for develop-
ment I could do nothing but bow and
retire.
After this third failure to house the
bird I threw convention to the winds
and took to accosting utter strangers
in the street with, “Will you have a
raven 2 ” I went rides in trams and
tubes and canvassed the passengers.
“Not to-day, thank you,” was the
response, save in a few instances. One
man invited me to ask him again and
he would do me in. A lady to whom

hard enough to pay for butcher's meat;

Then at last, all my efforts having

AFTER the unsatisfying theatre-diet
which has fallen to me of late I was
doubly glad to get my teeth into Mr.
ST. JoHN ERVINE's good meaty ration
at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.
His theme is as old and new as JoB.
John Ferguson is a saintly Ulster farmer,
apostle of the doctrine of non-resistance
(rare type in those parts, I understand)
and eager justifier of the ways of God to
men. Ferguson's beloved farm is mort-
gaged; foreclosure imminent. Help is
confidently expected from brother An-
drew in America, but does not come.
Daughter Hannah, sent with a message
to the brutal mortgagee, is outraged by
him. Prospective son-in-law James,
man of great words but little heart,
rushes into the night to kill the ravisher.
But it is silent son Andrew (destined
for the ministry) who does the killing,
because he knows James to be a craven.
John Ferguson urges confidently the
will of God that James, whom he be-
lieves blood-guilty, should not avoid
arrest, and refuses to hide him. But
when young Andrew insists on giving
himself up to save James and his own
falters; he protests in his anguish, but
rallies to accept this last blow from the
hand of God—made none the easier to
bear by the arrival, just a fatal fortnight
late, of the money from his brother, a
forgetful sort of man, who had mis-
taken the date of the mail. The tragic
irony of the whole is skilfully height-
ened by the fact that it is half-witted
“Clutie,” with his penny whistle and
his random words, who goads young
Andrew to his vengeance. -
A grim tale finely (perhaps just a
little too diffusely) told and admirably
presented. Mr. ERVINE's most effective
stroke was, I think, the character of
James Caesar, with his pathetic yet re-
volting self-condemnation, interpreted
with a real mastery of art without
artifice by Mr. J. M. KERRIGAN, of the
old band of “Irish Players.” Miss
MoyNA MAcGILL (a name new to me)
played her Hannah with an exquisite
sincerity and restraint. A particular
moment when, from her hysterical
laughter at the careful choice made by
her father's God of the moment for the
arrival of the money, she breaks into a
passionate “It's not right! It's not
just 1” was very fine. The whole
character was skilfully built up. The
Mr. HERBERT MARSHALL's Andrew
was also an excellent performance.
Was it quite right, however, that the
morning after the murder he should
appear so completely unruffled 2 (I
admit I don't know my Ulster inti-
mately). I rather think that Mr. MILEs
MALLEsoN's well-studied “Clutie” might
have been a little less coherent, with
more fawning in his manner. He
seemed something too normal for his
purpose in the piece. The way in which
the other characters staved off his
piping was beyond all praise. I should
guess, from specimens submitted, that
his repertory was not extensive.
Mr. REA, as the father, was of course
competent, but surely a little over-
placid throughout. He accepted the
blow of his daughter's dishonour with
scarcely a sign that submission caused
him any serious pang—a seeming indif-
ference shared by Miss MAIRE O'NEILL
(Hannah's mother), who appeared quite
untroubled a few minutes after the
harrowing relation, and indeed seemed
throughout to be playing too easily.
Mr. RAYMond VALENTINE had a “fat "
part as the villain, and well and fatly he
played it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FAME. .
For a long time past I had felt that
something ought to be done about it,
and then one evening as I opened my
paper in the Tube I came suddenly
upon the following paragraph —-
“Lunching yesterday with Jack Pop-
pington at the Bitz, where, by the way,
M. Caramel treated us to a superbly
priceless mousse à la Canadienne, he
told me that his Little Pests is selling
like wildfire and proving a real bo-
nanza to the lucky publishers, Messrs.
Painter and Lilley. Had a pleasant
chat with him about old times in the
Army Pay Corps, in which we served to-
gether for nearly sixteen months during
one of the hottest periods of hostilities
‘out yonder.' More famous amongst
the general public for his black-ribboned
tortoiseshell monocle and invariable
presence at all truly semi-smart Bo-
hemian functions, Poppington keeps a
brindled bulldog, grows primulas and
is, of course, known to a select circle
as the energetic Organising Secretary
of the North Battersea Entomological
Society.” - -
The letterpress which I have quoted
above was headed “Popular Pap" and
formed a kind of frame for a photograph
of Mr. Poppington, which seemed to
show that his luncheon at the Bitz had
not really agreed with him after all,
and at the bottom of the column I
noted the familiar signature of “Mar-
chand du Beurre.”
As usual when I read paragraphs
of this kind I first of all blushed guiltily
and glanced round to see whether any-
one had noticed how eagerly. I was
drinking it all in. Then I put on the
faint superior smile of recognition which
I felt that the situation obviously de-
manded. Good old Poppington | One
of the best. What recollections it
stirred 1 Marchand and he and I
When I left the Tube I carefully
crumpled the paper up and threw it
away, and in the middle of dinner I
took care to remark casually to Ara-
minta, “By the way, I suppose you put
Little Pests on the library list 2"
“Awfully sorry,” she said, “but I'm
afraid I hadn't heard of them.”
“Poppington's latest,” I said curtly.
“I'm afraid I haven't heard of Pop-
pington either.”
I gave a sigh of desperation and
leant back in my chair.
“Well, really "I protested. “Surely
the man himself—everybody—I mean
—his—his eye-glass—his bulldog—of
course only a few of us fully appreciate
the extent of his actual research work
—but still—"
“All right, I'll get it,” she replied.
enough, but the situation none the less
was serious. Paragraphs exactly like
this had been meeting my eye in almost
every popular paper for. month after
month, and, though I use two memory
systems and have an electric scalp
shampoo each week, I find them in-
creasingly difficult to cope with. Who's
Which already transgresses the es-
tablished canons of literary art. It is
almost as tall lying down as standing
up, and fellows like Poppington are not
even in Who's Which. He had not,
you observed, even obtained an O.B.E.
What would happen if I met him at
some public gathering or dinner and
by some awful mischance forgot those
salient facts?
It appeared to me that a process for
reproducing short biographies of this
nature in a slightly larger type on the
shirt-fronts of eminent personages was
badly needed; it should be coupled, I
felt, with an arrangement of periscopes
to help one when sitting beside the great
man or standing behind his back. Or he
might perhaps wear upon his sleeve
something like the divisional signs
which were so useful in France. Old
Poppington, for instance, might have a
—might wear an—I mean there might
be something or other on his coat in
red or green or blue to indicate the
nature and scope of his secretarial
activities and give a fellow the right
lead. And to think that every week
dozens and dozens of new Poppingtons
are springing up like crocuses about
me! It was a bewildering thought.
They were becoming perhaps the most
numerous and influential class in the
community. I had visions of mass
meetings of “well - known " men—
“well-known" men marching in pro-
cession with flags to Downing Street
to demand State recognition, statues
and pensions, and insisting that it
should be made a penal offence not to
recognise their well-known features in
the street. I made a great resolve.
Why should I be left out of it? I de-
termined to join the crowd.
I had got rather out of touch with old
Marchand for some time, and had in-
deed forgotten exactly what he looked
like, but I persuaded a mutual friend to
point him out to me, and, selecting the
psychological moment, cannoned into
him heavily in the street. His spectacles
dropped off and his note-book fell out
of his hand.
“Why, if it isn't Du Beurre!” I
shouted, feigning an ecstatic surprise.
“I am sorry,” he said rather stiffly,
when he had recovered his breath,
“ but I am afraid I haven't the
pleasure -
“I am John Smith,” I said.
“Allow me to tell you all about my-
self,” I said. And I did.
I was a little nervous as to how he
would take it, but the event justified
me. When I opened my paper next
evening I found the following words:—
“Ran across John Smith of Ravens-
court Park yesterday afternoon. Chat-
ting with him about one thing and
another, he told me something of the
methods he has employed to bring
about his present celebrity in that
salubrious suburb. He has never, it
appears, written a book, collaborated
in a review, appeared in a night-club,
lunched at the Bitz, sat on a committee,
or been summoned as a witness in a
sensational divorce case. His record,
I fancy, must be one of the most
thoroughly unique in Greater London.”
There was no photograph of John
Smith, but, biting partly into this
paragraph and partly into another on
the opposite side of the column, was
one of Mortimer Despenser, the new
film star, featured in Scented Sin, which
really did almost as well. Dear old

There was a benevolent peer

UNDENIABLY Mr. CARADoc Evans is the bold boy. No
doubt you remember (since they are so difficult to forget)
the two volumes in which he dealt faithfully (and a bit over)
with the manners of his countrymen in the land of their
fathers. I have heard, and can well believe, that some of
Mr. Evans' own people were moved by this tribute even
to the extent of threatening its author with personal violence.
And now he has turned from Welsh Wales to English Lon-
don, and gives us in My Neighbours (MELRose) a further
collection of sketches pleasantly calculated to prove that
the general detestability of his compatriots remains un-
changed by their migration from a whitewashed cottage to
a villa in Suburbia. Whatever you may think of Mr.
Evans' work, whether it attracts or violently repels, there
can be no question of its devastating skill. His sketches,
no more than a few pages in length, contain never an idle
word, and the phrases bite like vitriol. Moreover he employs
an idiom that is (I conjecture) a direct transcription from
native speech, which adds enormously to the effect. Under-
stand me, not for worlds would I commend these volumes
haphazard to the fastidious; I only say they are clever,
arresting and violently individual. Also that, if you have
not so far met the work of Mr. EvaNs, here is your oppor-
tunity in a volume that shows it at its best, or worst.
Half-an-hour's reading will give you an excellent idea of it.

Mrs. GEORGE WEMyss has for some time past specialised
in spinster-aunts, bachelor-uncles and charming nieces. In
Oranges and Lemons (CoNSTABLE) she introduces us pleas-
antly to some more. . The plot, in fact, is chiefly concerned
with the violent squabbles of an uncle and aunt, who belong
to different sides of the family, for the good graces of Diana
(who is nineteen, or thereabouts, and radiant), and Shant,
(who says so—just like that—and is five). There are also
several young men. To test his abilities in the Admirable
Crichton line Diana maroons the most favoured of these,
together with three other aspirants to her hand, and her
bachelor uncle, on an island in a Scottish loch, hamperless,
on a soft day. As the affections of all the lovers remain
undimmed, you can guess what kind of a girl Diana must
have been. Shant's even more responsible job is to tumble
off a pony and allay the temporary tartness which existed
between her two elderly admirers, so that nothing but
oranges and orange-blossoms remain. Really, of course,
none of the story much matters. But if you want the
sensation of having stayed with delightful people in de-
lightful places, where rising prices are not even mentioned
or thought of, Mrs. WEMYss can give it you all the time.

clarity of vision, or her cleverness in describing every
detail she has seen, or her delicate precision of style;
there is only daylight, temperate, pervading, but at times,
I am afraid, almost irritatingly calm. “Give me one indis-
cretion of sympathy or emotion on behalf of your char:
acters,” the reader is tempted to implore her; “let me feel
that you are a little bit excited about them and I shall feel
excited too.” The story, after all, is the simple one (to put
it in the shudderingly crude language of former days) of a
girl's change of heart from an unreal love to one of whose sin-
cerity she eventually convinces herself. Katharine Hilbery,
the granddaughter of a great poet, brought up by a father
whose only interest is in literature, and a charming mother
who wanders in fields of Victorian romance, breaks off
her engagement with a civil servant who has more taste
than talent for letters, and chooses instead a man
slightly below her in social position, but with firmness
reading, for here Sir RIDER HAGGARD is in as good form as
ever he was, when both he and Allan Quatermain were
younger. Lady Ragmall, who is an old friend to readers of
The Ivory Child, reappears here, having in her possession a
mysterious and potent herb, which she persuades Allan to
inhale. Then the fun takes on a great liveliness. Allan is
waſted back to the days when Egypt was under the
domination of the Persians, and he in his ancient existence
performed some of the very doughtiest of deeds. No one
living can tell such a tale with a greater dexterity and zest
than Sir RIDER. And at that I will leave it, with one more
regret that I was not allowed to be present when Allan
recovered from the effects of Taduki (the herb that did it).
I find that when the medicine of thought is wrapped up
in the jam of fiction I generally take both more willingly
than either alone. But if my author, holding out the
and decision of character
and genuine skillin—what?

ture. All through the book
I found myself wondering
whether a mind so finely
tempered as Katharine's, a
perception so acute, was
really fitted for anything so
commonplace as, after all,
love is. And I longed for the
authoress, who explained
every mood so amazingly
well, to explain this too.
Mrs. Norris is evidently
a specialist in unconven-
tional situations. In her
last novel her theme was
the intrigue between a man
and his step-mother. In
Sisters (MURRAY) it is the
passion of a man for his
living wife's married sister,
and in neither case does the
author seem to be conscious
of anything out of the ordin-
ary. Not that there is any
air of naughtiness about
the business. Peter, a rich

Miss LETTs introduces it
with a foreword which con-
veys the impression that a

but the letters themselves
convince — or very nearly

youngest and prettiest of the three Strickland girls. But
Martin, a casual impecunious stranger, stepped in and took
her in one bite before Peter could quite realise she was no
longer a child. So in default he married Alir, who was,
incidentally, worth six of her. Meeting his Cherry, disillu-
sioned about an unsatisfactory and unsuccessful Martin, he
reaches out his hand for this forbidden fruit. Whereupon
Alir, the selfless, drives herself and Martin over a cliff by
way of making things smooth for Peter and Cherry, which
was inconsiderate, if resourceful; for, while Alir is happily
killed, poor Martin only breaks his back, so that all may
end with the balance on the credit side of the Recording
Angel's ledger with Cherry nursing her hopeless invalid.
An unlikely story, pleasantly and competently told.
My appreciation of The Ancient Allan (CAssell) may be
measured by my keen disappointment on finding that the
concluding pages of the book were absent in the copy
vouchsafed to me, and that (apparently) in their place a
double dose of pages 279—294 was offered. Nevertheless
writer has to say. From his
own death-bed Corporal Jack, together with his own love-
story and that of his chum Mac, writes what he can of com-
fort to his friend, and whether his hand or Miss LETTs's held
the pen the book is the work of someone who knows all
about sorrow, and only the initiated—who must be many
for a decade to come—will know quite how well it is done.
Of the late Mr. NoLL Ross, who, to the infinite loss of
British journalism, died at the early age of twenty-seven,
Mr. Punch cannot trust himself to speak with the cold
detachment of the critic. He saw life with the clear eye of
happy youth and set it down with the easy pen of a ready
writer. Coming from New Zealand, through the War, to
England, his natural talents were at once recognised, and
he won a position for himself on the staff of The Times. In
the leisure moments spared from the service of the Old
Lady of Printing House Square, he would crack a jest, now
and then, with the Old Sage of Bouverie Street. Mr. Edwin
ARNoLD now publishes a collection of his writings under

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MEN AND THINGS OF THE MOMENT.
[Mr. Punch cannot hold himself responsible
for the views expressed in the following cor-
respondence.] -
THE MALLABY-DEELEY EMPORIUM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I want you to
use your influence with that great phil-
anthropist, Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY. I
know that he is too modest to claim to
be a benefactor of the race, but I am at
least right in calling him “Mr.,” for
that is how he describes himself on his
shop-window, and he would never have
done that if he had not desired to
avoid confusion with the common
tradesman. Well, I want you to enlist
his powerful sympathy in the cause
of the struggling middle classes, to
which body I belong. I refer parti-
cularly to our crying need for dinner-
jackets at reasonable prices. I am one
of those who spend their holidays at
seaside hotels, where people make a
point of dressing for dinner in the hope
of giving their fellow-guests the im-
pression that this is their daily habit
in the home circle. In view of the
early advent of Spring I approached
my tailor, the other day, with inquiries
as to the cost of an abbreviated dinner-
suit. His prices were as follows:—
jacket £10 10s. 0d.; waistcoat £33s.Od.;
trousers £4 10s. 0d.; total £18 3s. 0d.
I am old enough to recall the time
when the most élite tailors of Savile
Row charged no more than £10 10s. 0d.
for a complete evening costume, un-
curtailed.
I am all for the cheap supply of “gen-
tlemen's lounge-suits" for the so-called
working-classes to lounge in. I know
of no surer antidote to the spirit of
Bolshevism. But let us not forget the
claims of the middle classes, who are
the backbone of the Empire. If Mr.
MALLABY-DEELEY cannot help us in
the direction I have indicated, then let
Mr. KENNEDY Jones, on behalf of the
Middle Class Union, put a hyphen to
his name and open a shop for the sale
of evening wear at demi-popular prices.
Yours faithfully, SURBItoNIAN.
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-It would be a thou-
sand pities if Mr. MALLABY-DEELEy's
beneficent scheme should fail for lack
of advertisement. , Could you not per-
suade your colleagues of the Press to
publish from day to day the route of
his car's progress from his private resi-
dence (or the terminus from which he
debouches) to his place of business, as
in the case of the new Member for
Paisley 2 My only fear is that the Coali-
tion Government might be suspected of
adopting the Wee Free methods of pub-
licity for political ends; but this would
case of a movement designed for the
benefit not of a party, but of mankind.
Yours faithfully, STAGE MANAGER.
THE DECLINE of LEARNING.
DEAR SIR,--I look for your sym-
pathy when I say that I regard the
abolition of compulsory Greek at Oxford
as tantamount to the collapse of the
last bulwark of British Culture. It is
idle for the advocates of this act of
vandalism to protest that the spirit
of Ancient Hellas can be adequately
conveyed in the form of translations,
and to illustrate this futile argu-
ment by reference to the authorised
version of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Admirable as that version may be, is it
for a moment to be supposed that it
can take the place of the original as
a source of spiritual education? or
that our appreciation of Holy Writ
would not be a hundred-fold increased
if it were fortified by a knowledge of
the first principles of Hebraic syntax
and by an elementary acquaintance with
Hebraic composition. It is impossible
to estimate the influence of such know-
ledge in tending to endear the Bible to
our youth. To me indeed it has always
been incomprehensible that our Pre-
lates, who presumably have the welfare
of the Church at heart, have never in-
sisted on making Hebrew a compulsory
subject for Responsions.
And now Greek has gone and Oxford
is the home of one more lost cause.
The gods (of the gallery) may be with
the winners, but it is the losing side
that still appeals to
Yours incorruptibly, CAto.
“THE TIMEs' Flight.”
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-His many friends
(among whom I take leave to count
myself) will heartily sympathise with
Dr. CHALMERs MITCHELL on the engine
troubles he has passed through, cul-
minating in the enforced curtailment
of his scientific expedition. It is
gratifying to think that the pure and
lofty spirit of research which animated
the great newspaper-proprietor who
sent him forth on this mission has been
vindicated by the Doctor's discovery of
an unmapped volcano. Regrettably the
conditions under which he observed it
precluded him from making an expert
survey of it, and even from securing
specimens of its geological structure.
The possibility of such an unfortunate
contingency, which may have escaped
the consideration of the promoter of
the expedition, was recognised by other
scientists. But it was confidently ex-
pected by his Zoological confrères that
his voyage of exploration would add
largely to our knowledge of the habits
notably of the giraffe, as coming, by the
exceptional development of its neck,
within closest range of his vision as he
flew through the vast inane.
Even better opportunities for the
observation of animal life would, it
was thought, occur during the occa-
sional intervals spent on terra firma
for purposes of repose or repair. And
indeed one is greatly intrigued by the
following terse and airmanlike entry in
the log for February 20th : “Much dis-
turbed by lions.” Nothing is said of
the actual capture of one of these
interesting denizens of the jungle, but
reference to such a feat might well
have been omitted out of regard for
brevity. Is it too much to hope that
the enterprise of The Times may yet
be rewarded by the addition of a live
lion to the Zoological Gardens?
In any case, by the exceptional
opportunities he enjoyed for a careful
study of leaking cylinder jackets insu-
lating tape, red-leaded joints and miss-
ing engines, the intrepid Doctor must
have added largely to his knowledge of
mechanical science, to say nothing of
the botanical discoveries he made when
his machine came within a few inches of
contact with a banana-tree.
I, for one, look forward eagerly to his
return, when he will be able to narrate
his experience with a fulness and free-
dom of language impossible in cabled
despatches.
Yours faithfully,
STANLEY LIVINGstone Jones.

WON ON THE POSTS.
(With the British Army in France.)
THE decisive victory of the Racing
Club de Petiteville—late the deuxième
équipage of the Sportif Club de
Petiteville—over the troisième équipage
of the Société Athlétique de Pont Neuf
would not appear to have any bearing
on the washing of Percival's collars
and pyjamas; but, according to Elfred
Fry, there was a poignant connection
between the two.
When the Sportif Club received the
challenge they doubted whether to
accept it, as the Société Athlétique was
rumoured to include several veterans
approaching fifteen years of age and of
tremendous physique. On being con-
ceded the choice of ground, however,
they took up the gage and trained and
practised with such vigour that two
days before the date of the match
Georges Darré, right back, punted his
toe through a previously suspected
weak spot in the ball and irreparably
ruined it. The Société Athlétique was
informed of the disaster and asked to
supply a ball, but they answered that
for visiting teams providing the acces-
sories. There was also an insinuation
that the story of the burst ball was a
fabrication, designed to give the Sportif
Club a loophole of escape from a con-
test that spelt certain defeat.
Stung to the quick, the deuxième
équipage made an urgent appeal to the
premier équipage of the Sportif Club,
who replied that this was the first inti-
mation they had had of the existence of
a deuxième équipage, and recommended
a tourney at marbles or a combat of
peg-tops as being more suitable to their
tender years.
Naturally this insult could not be
brooked, and it was decided to break
away from the parent body and re-
organise under the title of the Racing
Club de Petiteville; but this did not
help them to solve the question of a new
ball. Then it was that Théo Navet,
left half, and son of the blanchisseuse in
the rue Napoléon, had an inspiration,
and Percival's pyjamas became linked
up with the destinies of the club.
“It wouldn't surprise me, Sir,” said
Elfred on the evening when Petiteville
Racing Club's victory by 4 buts to 2,
“if you are the only orſicer in Mess
to-night with a reelly clean collar.”
“And why am I singled out for so
much honour?” asked Percival, taking
the slacks which Elfred produced from
between the mattresses. “Has the
Washer-women's Union handed in
notices and made a complimentary ex-
ception in my case?”
“Well, Sir, you 'ave been favoured,
but it weren't a strike,” explained
Elfred. “You know, Sir, there's been
an alarming short ration of coal an'
fuel down in the village for a long
time, an' two days ago Madame Navet,
who does the orficers' washing, came
up an' said she was bokoo fashay but

HAviNg unexpectedly retained possession of my seat in

my station, so it was rather late when I reached home.
“ Hullo!” I called out cheerily.
“Hullo!” echoed Margaret in a flat sort of voice; “you

I refrained from facetiousness and told her that I was.
“Oh l’” she said. -
“Well, well, Margaret,” I said in a bright and bustling

I lit a cigarette. Margaret looked reproachfully at me.
“What was yesterday 2” she said.
“Tuesday, my dear. We will now have a little chat

“Tuesday the 25th of February,” said Margaret solemnly,
“Possibly, my dear, possibly. But I cannot say that I
find your remarks very interesting. They may be true, or
they may not, but they certainly seem to me to lack that
agreeable whimsicality usually so characteristic of you."
“Our wedding-day,” said Margaret impressively.
“Was it really 2” I said in a whisper. “And you let it
pass without reminding me. Oh, how could you?”
Margaret smiled.
“I didn't think of it till this morning—after you had
gone,” she said.
We both smiled. Then we laughed.
“You know, we really are a dreadful couple,” I said.
“Your fault is greater than mine, though. I'll tell you why.
Everyone knows that a man—especially a manly man—”
I tugged my moustache and let my biceps out for a run—
“never remembers anniversaries, whereas a woman—a
womanly woman—does.” Here I plucked a daffodil from
a bowl near by and tucked it coyly behind her ear.
“It really is rather awful of us.” Margaret restored the
daffodil to its young companions. “We’ve only been
married three years, too, and yet already ” She threw
out her arms in a hopeless gesture. -
“Still,” I said presently, with my hand full of her hand—
“still I daresay we shall get used to it in time—forgetting
the day, I mean. After about the fourth lapse there will be
hardly any sting in our little piece of annual forgetfulness.”
“We mustn't forget to remember we've forgotten it,
though, Gerald, so that we can test the waning powers of
the sting.” .
“I can see this habit growing on us,” I said dreamily;
“a few more years and we shall forget we are married even.
I shall come home one day—provided I remember where
we live—and be horrified to find you established in my
house and using my sealing-wax. Or maybe I shall arrive
with some little offering of early rhubarb or forced arti-
chokes only to be sternly ordered away by a wife who does
not recognise me. “Please take your greens round to the
tradesmen's entrance,' you will say coldly.”

THE COALITION OF 1950.
“AREN'T you being rather badly hit
by the price of tobacco?” I asked
Charles, whose pipe is a kind of extra
limb to him.
“I have just been composing the plot
of a novel,” he replied with apparent
irrelevance. “It begins something like
this:—
“‘Slowly and softly the violet dusk
set in. The beautiful young Première
stood at the window of her yellow-and-
black boudoir, gazing a little wistfully
at the almost deserted pavements of
Downing Street. A white pigeon
“They aren't white,” I said; “they're
a sort of purply p'nky grey.”
“All right,” said Charles, unmoved,
“only it rather spoils the sentence. “A
sort of purply pinky grey pigeon perched
pompously—’”
“Never mind the pigeon,” I said,
“tell me what was the trouble with
the B.Y.P.”
“A change in the leadership of the
Opposition. The old leaderess had just
retired and her place had been taken
by a new one, a man this time, young
and handsome as Apollo, who had
thrown up the Chair of Cinemato-
graphy at the London University to
plunge on to a political platform.”
“What was the programme,” I in-
quired, “of this—er—furniture-re-
mover ?”
“He was a reactionary,” said Charles.
“The Première's party had won a not
too sweeping victory at the polls on
prohibition (not of alcohol, of course—
that had been done long ago—but of
tobacco).”
“How on earth did she do it 2 ”
“National economy, mostly,” an-
swered Charles. “She had the wives'
vote solid, and they carried the more
docile of the husbands with them. She
had to throw out bribes to the un-
married electorate of both sexes, of
been attempting to pay. Powder and
chocolates had been made cheaper.
There was the Endowment of Cinemas
Act of 1948, and the Subsidized Foot-
ball Bill of '49. But all these extra-
vagances had largely ruined the effect
of the abolition of tobacco. At the
beginning of that year she had been
obliged to cancel the State holiday on |
Mondays ny
“Why Mondays?” I inquired.
“Everyone feels beastly on Monday.”
“But I don't see why they should
feel any better on Tuesday.”
“It was twenty-four hours nearer
Saturday,” he replied, “and Saturday
was also a State holiday. Labour, of
course, was infuriated, and unrest was
every day becoming more apparent.
The by-elections were going against the
Première. And now this new handsome
young hero had arisen not only to crys-
tallise the support of his own sex, but
capture the hearts of all the female
electorate under twenty.”
“Twenty 1" I gasped.
“Everyone over fifteen had the fran-
chise,” said Charles calmly. “Now mark
you, the programme of the Opposition
was very cunning. They only proposed
to reintroduce cigar and cigarette smok-
ing. Edward Oburn, the young leader,
being a film actor, naturally smoked

employers, but the enormous army of
cigarette-suckers, male and female, was
with him. - .
“But I don't see how he proposed to
cut down expenses,” I objected.
“He was going to tax the printing of
all words over two syllables in length,”
replied Charles. "“The Press of those
days was not affected by the proposal,
but a considerable revenue was expected
from scientific books, high-brow novels
and Socialistic publications. Well, the
Première, as I say, was a prey to sad
reflections, when suddenly the chur-
chur of a taxi - *

I said. -
“Possibly I am,” he admitted; “it

A few moments later the door of the
boudoir was flung open and the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer was announced.”
“What did she want?”
“She was a he this time, and had
come to announce the inevitable—the

the IBachelor Tax,’ ” he said. . -
“Now, the Bachelor Tax had been
tried some twenty years before, but had
failed, partly owing to the number of
passive resisters who had had to be
forcibly fed, and partly owing to the
number of men who had shown sub-
stantial proof of recurrent rejections.

“Did the taxi go on chugging?”
I asked. - .
“Shut up. They decided eventually
that if a bachelor made a written pro-

to have his case tried before a jury of

was a reasonable offer and one that

If they found that it was, he was to be
exempt from further efforts. The Bill
was accordingly drafted, and carried
easily, and the sequel no doubt you have
guessed. On the day after it became

was a scene of the utmost beauty and

“How long did it go on ?” I inquired.

Charles pleasantly, refilling his foul old

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 1st.—Calendar note
(extracted from The Wee Free Alma-
mack): “Asquith comes in like a lion.”
Everybody wanted to see the victor
of Paisley make his rentrée.
The Peers' Gallery was so
crowded with his former
colleagues that Lord Roth-
ERMERE had scarcely room
for the big stick which
typifies his present atti-
tude towards the Govern-
ment. Poor Lord BEAver-
BROOK was quite in the
background; but I am told
that on historic occasions
he always prefers, with
characteristic modesty, to
be behind the scenes.
As the hero of the hour
walked up the floor, es-
corted by Sir DoNALD
MACLEAN and Mr.THoRNE,
his supporters did their
best to give him a rousing
welcome. But they were
too few to produce much
effect, and a moment or
two later, when Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE left the Treasury
Bench to greet his old chief
behind the SPEAKER's
Chair, they were compelled
to hear the young bloods
of the Coal tion “give a
louder roar.”
Finding the traditional
seat of the Leader of the
Opposition still in the oc-
cupation of Mr. ADAMson,
Mr. Asquith bestowed himself between
the Labour Leader and Mr. NEIL MAC-
LEAN, with whom he entered into con-

A suggestion that in view of the
difficulty of filling diplomatic vacancies
the Government should appoint suit-

declined by the PRIME MINISTER on
the ground that it was not practicable

criticism. Sir FREDERick BANBURY was of giving proper accommodation to the
eloquent upon what he called a “hotel
for gardeners” at Kew. Mr. Hogge
was for rooting up the Royal Botanical
Gardens, since they were hardly ever
visited by Scotsmen, and Captain STAN-
LEY WILsoN inveighed against the ex-
travagance with which the British dele-
gates were housed in Paris. Sir ALFRED
Mond admitted that they “did them-
selves very well,” but pleaded that they
could hardly be expected to go to Mont-
martre—at least not collectively—-and
pointed out that some of the criticisms
should be addressed to other Depart-
ments. He was not responsible, for
example, for “clothes of typists.”
Wednesday, March 3rd.—Among the
things that they do better in France,
according to Lord SUDELEY, is the
popularisation of picture-galleries and
museums. He instanced the pictures
on French match - boxes. But were
they always confined to reproductions
of Louvre masterpieces? My recollec.
tion is that at one time they took a
wider range and were distinctly more
striking than the matches.
One was reminded of PRAED's lines—

interest of the State. The House was
still obstinate, until Mr. BonAR LAw

last went through.
Thursday, March 4th.-Lord Buck-
MASTER’s scheme for preventing the
bankruptcy of the State is to make every-
body invest a portion of his capital in
Government securities and to withhold
the interest until such time as the
State should find it convenient to pay.
This, he explained to his own satisfac-
tion, was quite different from that
dangerous expedient, a levy on capital.
Lord PEEL took a more cheerful view
of the situation, and indicated that it
was quite unnecessary for noble lords to
get the wind up, since the Govern-
ment would have no difficulty in
raising it.
Even the most rigid economists will
not cavil at the latest addition to our
financial burdens. The PENSIONs MIN-
ISTER announced an addition of close
on two millions a year to the annual
charge. The increase is chiefly for a
much-needed improvement in the allow-
ances made to disabled officers, who
have hitherto been but scurvily treated.
Mr. HIGHAM objected to receiving an
answer about the telephones from Mr.
PIKE PEASE. He demanded a reply
from the PRIME MINISTER, not from
a representative of the department
impugned. The SPEAKER, however,
pointed out that there were limits to
the PREMIER's responsibilities: “He
does not run the whole show.” After
this descent into the vernacular I half-
expected that Mr. LowTHER would dam
the stream of Supplementaries that fol-
lowed with, “Oh, ring off!” but he con-
tented himself with calling the next
Question.
The debate on the Third Reading of
the War Emergency Laws (Continu-
ance) Bill was chiefly devoted to Ireland.
Captain WEDGwood BENN, after spend-
ing a whole week in that country, is |
convinced that all the trouble is due
to the Government's reliance upon
D.O.R.A., and declared that the only
people who were not in gaol were the
murderers. That would mean that
there are some four million assassins in
Ireland; which I feel sure is an exagger-
ation. The two hundred thousand
mentioned by the CHIEF SECRETARY
would seem to be ample for any country
save Russia.
Scarcely was this gloomy episode
over than the House was called upon
to pass a Supplementary Estimate of
£860 for “Peace Celebrations in Ire-
land.” As £500 of this sum was for
flags and decorations, which, in Mr.
BALDw1N's phrase, “remain for future
use,” the Irish outlook may, after all,
be not quite so black as it is painted.

A BUY ELECTION.
[The excellent precedent set by Mr.
MALLABY-DEELEY in supplying needed goods
at cheap rates may prove a little awkward
if adopted by Parliamentary Candidates, as
shown in the following anticipatory report.]
QUIET confidence reigned in the
ranks of the Muddleboro Labour Party.
The action of their Candidate, Mr.
Dulham, in arranging for a co-operative
milk supply at sixpence per quart, was
supposed to have won the hearts of
all householders. They had no fear of
Mr. Coddem, the representative of the
great BottomLEY party. It was true
that Mr. Coddem had taken over a
local brewery and was supplying beer
at threepence per pint. But the Labour
stalwarts argued that, in the first place,
this would lose him the women's and
temperance vote, and, in the second
place, the electors would drink the brew.
ery dry in double-quick time. All those
who failed to get cheap beer would
revenge themselves on the Candidate
who had failed to keep his promise.
The Wee Free cause was nearly hope-
less. Their candidate, Mr. Guff, had
made a desperate bid for popularity by
offering, in conjunction with The Daily
News, cocoa at reduced rates. But the
Labour Candidate had put the pointed
question, “Who made cocoa dear in
the first place?” and Mr. Guff had
evaded the question.
When Mr. Stilts, the National Party
Candidate, promised the public cheaper
honours—urging that, if he were re-
turned, it would be unnecessary to sub-
scribe to party funds to get a title—the
voters were quite unmoved. Perhaps
they knew that they could get the
O.B.E. for nothing, anyhow, and had
no higher ambitions.
The Coalition Candidate, Mr. Jenkins,
alone said nothing. The Star, that
famous organ of the Anti-Gambling
Party, proclaimed triumphantly that
the odds offered in the constituency
were ten to one against Jenkins. But
Mr. Jenkins lay low and said nothing
Or rather he achieved the not impos-
sible feat in a Parliamentary contest of
saying nothing and saying a good deal.
But the day before the poll Mr.
Jenkins's polling cards were delivered.
They were headed, “Vote for Jenkins
and Kill Profiteering. Give up this
card at your polling-station for free

usually priced at two guineas. Not

A quarter-mile queue of lady-voters
was standing outside the polling booths
at eight o'clock. Hundreds of them had
their husbands in custody with them.

[A reviewer in a recent issue of The Times Literary Supplement
asks, “Why should the characters in the psychological novel be in-
variably horrid?” and is inclined to explain this state of affairs by the
undiscriminating study of “the theories of two very estimable gentle-
men, the sound of whose names one is beginning to dislike—Messrs.
Freud and Jung.”]
IN QUEEN VICTORIA's placid reign, the novelists of note
In one respect, at any rate, were all in the same boat;
Alike in Richard Feverel and in Aurora Floyd
You'll seek in vain for any trace of Messrs. JUNG and FREUD.
They did not fail in colour, for they had their PEAcock's
tales;
Their heroines, I must admit, ran seldom off the rails;
They had their apes and angels, but they never once
employed -
The psycho-analytic rules devised by JUNG and FREUD.
They ran a tilt at fraud and guilt, at snobbery and shams;
They had no lack of Meredithyrambic epigrams;
The types that most appealed to them were not neuras-
- thenoid;
They lived, you see, before the day of Messrs. Jung and
FREUd. -
(I've searched the last edition of the famous Ency. Brit.
And neither of this noble pair is even named in it;
Only the men since Nineteen-Ten have properly enjoyed
The privilege of studying the works of JUNG and FREUD.)
Their characters, I grieve to say, were never more unclean
They had not slummed or fully plumbed with rapture
unalloyed
The unconscious mind as now defined by Messrs. JUNG
and FREUD.
The spiritual shell-shock which these scientists impart
Had not enlarged or cleared the dim horizons of their art;
They had not learned that mutual love by wedlock is
destroyed,
As proved by the disciples of the school of JUNG and FREUD.
The hierophants of pure romance, ev'n in its recent mood,
From STEvenson to CoNRAD, such excesses have eschewed;
But the psycho-pathologic route was neither mapped nor
buoyed -
Until the new discoveries of Messrs. JUNG and FREUD.
That fiction should be tonic all may readily agree;
That its function is emetic I, for one, could never see;
And so I'm glad to find The Times Lit. Supp. has grown
annoyed -
At the undiscriminating cult of Messrs. JUNG and FREUD.
Let earnest “cducationists” assiduously preach
The value of psychology in training those who teach;
Let publicists who speak of Mr. GEORGE, without the
LLOYD,
Confound him with quotations from the works of Jung and
FREUD—
But I, were I a despot, quite benevolent, of course,
Armed with the last developments of high-explosive force,
I'd build a bigger “Bertha,” and discharge it in the void
Crammed with the novelists who brood on Messrs. Jung

Than those of ordinary life, in morals or in mien ;

OPERATICS.
IT has been suggested before now
that Opera might be improved if the
singing were done behind the scenes
and the performance on the stage were
carried out in dumb show by compe-
tent actors who looked their parts.
But the idea that the movements on
the stage would correspond with the
utterances off it is not encouraged by
the present lack of collusion between
singers and orchestra—I refer to cases
where a performer is required to simu-
late music on a dummy instrument.
This reflection was forced upon me
at a recent performance of Tannhäuser.
It is true that Miss LILLIAN STANFord
as the Shepherd fingered her pipe in
precise accord with the gentleman who
played the music for her. But Mr.
MULLINGs, as Tannhäuser, took the
greatest liberties with his harp. He
just slapped it whenever he liked, with-
out any regard to the motions of his
collaborator. As for Mr. MICHAEL,
who played Wolfram, he was content
to fill in the vocal pauses with a little
suitable strumming; but when he sang
he was so distracted by his own voice
that he left his harp to play the accom-
paniment without visible assistance
For the fine performance which Mr.
ALBERT CoATEs conducted I have no
word but of praise, except that I could
have wished that Miss ELSA STRALIA
had borne a closer resemblance to what
is expected of Elisabeth. She seemed
to want to look as much as possible
like Venus, whose very opposite she
should have been in type as in nature.
Her colouring upset the whole scheme
of contrast, and one never began to
believe in the sincerity of her spiritual
ideals or that her death from a broken
heart was anything but an affectation.

some of us have prematurely reckoned
those of Peterborough Court. MATT.
ARNoLD was supposed to have adminis-
tered, if not the coup de grâce, at any
rate a serious blow to their gambollings
in Friendship's Garland.
It is therefore a matter for unfeigned
rejoicing to find that they are not only
alive but rampant, with all their old
splendid command of polysyllabic peri-
phrasis. One need only turn to the
notice of “The John Exhibition" in
last Thursday's Daily Telegraph, from
which we select the following page:–
purposeful portraiture that helps one to
realise the effect which Theotokopoulos
produced upon his watchful contempo-
raries, and to understand why the Cre-

If some insist on finding modern El
Greco versions of Inspectors and In-
quisitors-general in this John gather-
ing, compounded of comparatively in-
nocuous personalities, the privilege is,
of course, permissible, and incidentally
brightens conversation in irresponsible
circles.”
But a higher level of full-throated
bravula is attained later on —
“If reiteration may also be the mark
of the best portraiture, pace Lord

to Mr. John for continuing to visualize

(A Media’val Tragedy.)
“I want,” said the maiden, glancing
round her with tremulous distaste at
the stuffed crocodile, the black cat and
the cauldron simmering on the hearth,
“to see some of your complexion speci-
alities.” -
“You want nothing of the kind,”
retorted the witch..." Why prevaricate 2
A maid with your colour hath small
need even of my triple extract of toads'

is either a love-potion—” she paused
and glanced keenly at her visitor—“or
the means to avenge love unrequited.”
The maiden had flushed crimson. “I
wish he were dead!" she whispered.
“Now you are talking. That wish
is, of course, the simplest thing in the
world to gratify, if only you are pre-
pared to pay for it. I presume Moddam
would not desire anything too easy 2 "
“He had promised,” broke out the
maiden uncontrollably, “to take me to
the charity bear-baiting matinée in aid
of unemployed ex-Crusaders. The whole
| thing was arranged. And then at the
last moment—” *
“Precisely as I had supposed. A case

gradual wasting of the original with
pangs corresponding to the insertion of

witch. “But I should warn you. They

“No matter.” - ."
“Good. I was about to observe that

chinked pleasingly. The witch, having
transferred the contents of this to her
own pocket, proceeded to fashion the
required charm, watched by her client
with half-repelled eagerness. , . . .
“Hawk's eye, falcon's nose, raven's
lock, peacock's clothes,” chanted the
crone, following the words with her
cunning fingers.
“How—how know you him?” Panic
was in the voice.
The other laughed unpleasantly.

carefully and use a fresh pin for each
record.”
The maid snatched it from her hands
and was turning towards the door of the
hut when a low tap on its outer surface
caused her to shrink back alarmed.
The witch had again been watching her
with an ambiguous smile. “Should
Moddam wish to avoid observation,”
she suggested, “the side exit behind
yonder curtain—” In an instant
she was alone. Flinging the empty
wallet into the darkest corner the witch
(not without sundry chuckles) slowly
unbarred the entrance.
On the threshold stood a slim female
figure enveloped in a cloak. “The love
potion I had here last week,” began a
timid voice, “seems hardly satisfac-
tory. If you stock a stronger quality,
no matter how expensive—— ”
“Step inside,” said the witch.

Some couple of months later the
ladies of the house-party assembled at
Sangazure Castle for the Victory jousts
were gathered in the great hall, ex-
changing gossip and serf-stories in the
firelight while awaiting the return of
their menkind. - - - -
“Hath any heard,” lisped one fair
young thing, “how fareth the Lord
OEil-de-Veau ? They tell me that some
mysterious ailment hath him in thrall.”
At the words the Lady Yolande
Sangazure (whom we have met before)
was aware of a crimson flood mounting
swiftly to herexquisite temples. Strange
to add, the same phenomenon might
have been observed in a score of
damosels belonging to the best families
in the district. The hall seemed suf-
fused in a ruddy glow that was certainly
not reflected from the exiguous pile of
post-Crusading fuel smouldering on the
great hearth. . . . .
“Tush '" broke in the cracked voice
of a withered old dame, “your news is
old. . Not only hath the so-called fever
vanished, but my lord himself hath
followed it.” - - -
“Gone !” The cry was echoed by
twenty voices; twenty embroidery-
frames fell from forty arrested hands,
while nine-and-thirty dismayed eyes
fixed themselves upon the maliciously-
amused countenance of the speaker.
Only one, belonging to the Lady Beau-
regarde, who squinted slightly, remained
as though unmoved by the general
commotion. . . . . -
“Moreover,” continued the old dame,
“report saith that with him went his

mancy, transformed her beauty to the
semblance of a witch and provided her

“Cozening, no doubt. Of course the

true, one would admit that such

She ceased, well satisfied. “Ifancy,”
observed the Lady Yolande coldly, “that

eight hundred years ago) that Satan

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WE are apt to think of Lord NorthcLIFFE as the “onlie
begetter” of the New Journalism. But here comes Mr.
KENNEDY Jones, M.P., to remind us, in Fleet Street and
Downing Street (HUTCHINSoN), that he too had a very
large share in its parentage. And up to a point he is a
proud father. Circulations reckoned in millions instead of
thousands, journalistic salaries raised from hundreds to
thousands, advertisement-revenues multiplied many-fold—
these are some of the outward signs of the success of a
policy which the author summarised when he told Lord
MoRLEY, “You left journalism as a profession; we have
made it a branch of commerce.” But there is another side
to the medal. Frankenstein's monster was perfect in every-
thing save that it lacked a soul. In all material things the
New Journalism is a long way ahead of the Old; and yet,
after chronicling its many triumphs—culminating in the
capture of The Times—its part-creator is fain to admit that
“public distrust of news is the most notable feature in
journalism of recent years,” and that the influence of the
daily Press on the public mind has hardly ever been at a
lower ebb. This frankness is characteristic of a book which
on nearly every page contains something to startle or
amuse. The author's experiences on his first day in London,
including an encounter with a sausage-seller (more friendly
The Times, and his offer of the editorship to Lord CURzoN,
who unfortunately refused it; the provenance of “The
Pekin Massacre,” which originated, it appears, not with
a “stunt" journalist, but with a Chinese statesman wish-
ing to pull the Occidental leg—these and many other inci-
dents are admirably described by a writer who, though he
long ago doffed his journalistic harness, has not forgotten
how to write up a “good story.” Be your opinion of the
New Journalism what it may I guarantee that you will find
its champion an agreeable companion.
There are parts of Mr. W. J. Locke's latest novel, The
House of Baltazar (LANE), which will, I fear, make almost
prohibitive demands upon the faith (considered as belief in
the incredible) of his vast following. To begin with, he
introduces us to that problematical personage, whose
possibility used to be so much debated, the Man Who
Didn't Know There Was A War On. John Baltazar had
preserved this unique ignorance, first by bolting from a
Cambridge professorship through amorous complications,
next by living many years in the Far East, and finally by
settling upon a remote moorland farm (locality unspecified)
with a taciturn, Chinaman and an Airedale for his only
companions. This and other contributory circumstances,
for which I lack space, just enabled me to admit the situ-
ation as possible. Naturally, therefore, when a befogged
Zeppelin laid a couple of bombs plonk into the homestead,

shake-up. I had no complaint either with the trans-
formation that developed John Baltazar from the only
outsider to apparently the big boss of the War; while the
scenes between him and the son of whose existence he
had been unaware (a situation not precisely new to fiction)
are presented with a sincere and moving simplicity. So far
so good, even if hardly equal to the author's best. But the
catastrophe and the melodramatics about War-Office secrets,
preposterously put on paper, and still more preposterously
preserved, simply knocked the wind of reality out of the
whole affair. A pity, since Mr. LockB (though I prefer
him in more fantastic vein) has clearly spent much care
upon a tale that, till its final plunge, is at least lively and
Maida Vale, victims of all those petty, sordid, but deadly
troubles known only to the middle class. Without warrant,
explanation or excuse he introduces into their routine a
sudden touch of magic; the tired City man, the acid foster-
mother, the children (mercifully devoid of any priggishness),
and the pre-eminently human housemaid and cook are
transplanted for a moment into the age of the knights-
errant. Thither also are transplanted their special friends
and enemies, all retaining their modern identities and their
current troubles, and all getting unpleasantly involved in
the troubles of the ancients, to boot. Eventually the
interlude is found to have provided the solution of the diffi-
culties, pecuniary and other, of the home in Maida Wale; and

Olney, of course, has two

CowPER and Lace, and it
is now evident that Mr.
WRIGHT has kept as atten-

on the other. His book
makes no pretence to be
more than a brief and
frankly popular survey of
the art of lace - making

is a definite purpose in it
all. The book may be
labelled intellectual, but the
characters always remain
very human; thus George,
finding himself back in the
times of a thousand years
ago, says critically, “It

seeing him engaged in an
assault on the castle, shouts,
“George' put that sword

writer's style wholly equal to his zeal, his chapters are full
of interesting gossip, ranging from the late KATHERINE of
ARAGON (the originator, according to one theory, of English
lace-making), to some jolly stuff on the literature of Bob-
bins and the old Tells, or working-songs, sung by “the
spinners and the knitters in the sun, and the free maids
that weave their threads with bones.” I have a fancy
that the whole volume has been more or less a labour of
love (never certainly did I meet an author with such a list
of helpers to thank), so I am glad to think that its

Chinese dealers, bold sailormen, travellers, rapt lovers, do
get over the footlights in an effective way. They do the
things that are only done in magazines, but they do them
with a gusto which engages the attention. Perhaps indeed
that's what the author meant by her ingenious title;
though I suppose her device of setting before each story
a longer or shorter, more or less relevant, passage from the
Old Testament gives a clearer clue to the precise way in
which she interprets “nothing new under the sun.”

THE ‘‘NEW’’ WORLD.
[“Direct Action,” which was regarded as a
novelty suitable for an age of reconstruction,
has now, by the good sense of the Trades Union
Congress, been relegated to its proper place in
the old and discredited order of things.] -
IN these, the young Millennium's years,
Whereof they loudly boomed the
birth, . . . * * * *
Promising by the lips of seers
New Heavens and a brand-new Earth,
We find the advertised attraction
In point of novelty is small,
And argument by force of action
Would seem the oldest wheeze of all.
When Prehistoric Man desired
Communion with his maid elect,
And arts of suasion left him tired,
He took to action more direct;
Scaring her with a savage whoop or
Putting his club across her head,
| He bore her in a state of stupor
Home to his stony bridal bed.
In ages rather more refined,
Gentlemen of the King's highway,
Whose democratic tastes inclined
To easy hours and ample pay,
Would hardly ever hold their victim
Engaged in academic strife,
But raised their blunderbuss and ticked
him
Off with “Your money or your life.”
So when your miners, swift to scout
The use of reason's slow appeal,
Threaten to starve our children out
And bring the country in to heel,
There's nothing, as I understand it,
So very new in this to show;
The cave-man and the cross-roads
bandit
Were there before them long ago.
FAIR WEAR AND TEAR.
IN a short time now we shall have
to return this flat to its proper tenants
and arrive at some assessment of the
damago done to their effects. With
regard to the other rooms, even the
room which Richard and Priscilla con- ||
descend to use as a nursery, I shall
accept the owners' estimate cheerfully
enough, I think; but the case of the
drawing-room furniture is different.
About the nursery I have only heard
vague rumours, but in the drawing-
room I have been an eye-witness of the
facts.
The proper tenant is a bachelor who
lived here with his sister; he will
scarcely realise, therefore, what happens
at 5 P.M. every day, when there comes,
as the satiric poet, LONGFELLow, has
so finely sung— - -
“A pause in the day's occupations,
Which is known as the children's hour.”
one considers the buildings and muni-
tion dumps, the live and rolling stock,
the jungles and forests in that half-
charted territory; when one considers
that even the mere wastepaper basket
by the writing-desk (and it does look a
bit battered, that wastepaper basket) is
sometimes the tin helmet under which
Richard defies the frightfulness of
LARs PortsBNA, and sometimes a neces-
sary stage property for Priscilla's two
favourite dramatic recitations
“He plunged with a delighted sewcan
Into a bowl of clotted cweam,” . . .
and * -
“This is Mr. Piggy Wee,
With tail so pink and curly,
And when I say, ‘Good mornin', pig,"
He answers veurwy surly, -

and sometimes the hutch that harbours
a cotton-wool creation supposed to be a
white rabbit, and stated by the owner to
be “munsin' and munsin' and munsin' a
carrot ” — when, I say, I consider all
these things I anticipate that the pro-
ceedings of the Reparation Commission
will be something like this:—
He (looking a little ruefully at the
round music-stool). I suppose your wiſe
plays the piano a good deal? -
I (brightly). If you mean the detach-
able steering-wheel, it is only fair to
remember that a part interchangeable
between the motor-omnibus and the
steam-roller
He. I don't understand.
I. Permit me to reassemble the mech-
anism.
He. You mean that when you put
that armchair at the end of the sofa
and the music-stool in front of it—
I. I mean that the motor-omnibus
driver, sitting as he does in front of his
vehicle and manipulating his steering-
wheel like this, can do little or no harm
to the apparatus. On the other hand,
the steam - roller mechanic, standing
inside the body of the vehicle, and
having the steering - wheel in this
position -
He. On the sofa 2
I. Naturally. Well, supposing he
happens to have a slight difference of
opinion with his mate as to which of
them ought to do the driving, the wheel
is quite likely to be pushed off on to the
macadam, where it gets a trifle frayed
round the edges.
He. I see. How awfully stupid of
me! And this pouffe, or whatever they
call it 2
I. Week in and week out, boy and
girl, I have seen that dromedary ridden
over more miles of desert than I can
tell you, and never once have I known
it under-fed or under-watered, or struck
with anything harder than the human
little floppy with frequent use, but con-
sidering how barren your Sahara
He. Quite, quite. I was just looking
at that armchair. Aren't there a lot
of scratches on the legs?
I. Have you ever kept panthers ?
Do you realise how impatiently they
chaſe at times against the bars of their
cage? Of course, if you haven't . . . .
Finally, I imagine he will see how
reasonable my attitude is and how
little he has to complain of. He will
recognise that one cannot deal with
complicated properties of this sort
without a certain amount of inevitable
dilapidation and loss.
As a matter of fact I have an even
stronger line of argument if I choose
to take it. I can put in a counter-
claim. One of the principal attractions
of old furniture, after all, is historic
association. There is the armchair,
you know, that Dr. Johnson sat in,
and the inkpot, or whatever it was,
that MARY, Queen of Scots, threw at
John BUNYAN or somebody, and I have
also seen garden-seats carved out of
famous battleships. And then again,
if you go to Euston, or it may be Dar-
lington, you will find on the platform
the original tea-kettle out of which
GEORGE WASHINGTON constructed the
first steam-engine. The drawing-room
furniture that we are relinquishing
combines the interest of all these things.
If I like I can put a placard on the
sofa, before I take its owner to see it,
worded something like this:—
“Puffing Billy, the original steam-
roller out of which this elegant piece
was carved, held the 1920 record for
fourteen trips to Brighton and back
within half-an-hour.” And after he has
seen that I can lead him gently on to
Roaring Rupert, the arm-chair. Really,
therefore, when one comes to consider
it, the man owes me a considerable
sum of money for the enhanced senti-
mental value that has been given to his
commonplace property. -
Mind you, I have no wish to be too
hard on him. I shall be content with
a quite moderate claim, or even with
no claim at all. Possibly, now I come
to think of it, I shall simply say,
“You know what it is to have a
couple of bally kids about the place.
What shall I give you to call it square?”
And he will name a sum and offer
me a cigarette, and we shall talk a
little about putting or politics.
But it doesn't much matter. What-
ever he asks he can only put it down
in the receipts’ column of his account-
book under the heading of ‘Deprecia-
tion of Furniture,” whereas in my ex-
penses it will stand as “Richard and
Priscilla: for Adventures, Travel and
Drawing-room furniture indeed! When

BUT THEN, As I TELLS HER, THE GOOD
T
WINTER SPORT IN THE lower ALPS.
ABOUT two months ago, after a course
of travel literature and some back num-
bers of The Badminton Magazine, I
became infected with a desire to spend
a winter in the Alps, skating, sliding,
curling and yodelling in the intervals of
ski-ing, skijoring, skilacking and ski-
handlung. The very names of the pas-
times conjured up a picture of swift
and healthy activity. As the pamphlets
assured me, I should return a new man;
and, though I am greatly attached to
the old one, I recognised that improve-
ment was possible.
. I don't remember how it came about
that I finally chose Freidegg among
the multiplicity of winter-sport stations
whose descriptions approximated to
those of Heaven. I expect Frederick
forced the choice upon me; Frederick
had been to Switzerland every winter
from 1906 to 1913 and knew the ropes.
I somehow gathered that the ropes
were of unusual complexity.
The entire journey was passed among
winter-sporters of a certain type. From
their conversation I was able to learn
by Germans; that Franzheim was ex-
cellent if you stayed at the Grand, but
at the Kurhaus the guests were unso-
ciable, while at the Oberalp you were
not done well and the central-heating
was inefficient.
I ventured a few questions about the
sport available, but was gently rebuked
by the silence which followed before
conversation was resumed in a further
discussion of comforts and social am-
enities.
On arrival at the hotel I took out my
skates, but, on Frederick's advice, hid
them again. “Don’t let people see that
you are a newcomer; there won't be any
skating for some weeks yet,” said he.
“But why not?” I objected. “The
ice must be at least six inches thick.”
“Well, it isn't done,” he replied.
“One's first week is spent in settling
down; you can't go straight on the ice
without preparation.”
On the third day a Sports' Meeting
was held, as the result of which a pro-
gramme of the season was published.
It was announced that there would be,
weekly, three dances and one bridge
tournament; a theatrical performance
the blank evenings filled with either
a concert or an entertainment. I began
to wonder how I could squeeze in time
for sleep.
In order that boredom might not
overtake the guests before evening
came, a magnificent tea was served
from four to six. During the afternoon
one could visit the other hotels of the
place and usually found some function
in progress. We were not expected to
breakfast before ten, and the short time
that remained before lunch was spent
in a walk to the rink, where we would
solemnly take a few steps on the ice,
murmur, “Not in condition yet,” and
return to the hotel.
After about a fortnight of this I an-
nounced to Frederick that I was going
to skate, no matter how far from per-
fection the ice proved to be. -
Frederick was indignant.
“You'll make yourself both conspic-
uous and unpopular. The two Marriotts
are giving an exhibition to-morrow; if
you spoil the ice for them their show
will be ruined.”
“Very well, then,” said I, “I wi

rified; "the professionals are coming

if they don't find clean snow--
"All right; I'll get one of those grid-
irons and course down the ice-run. I
suppose that's what the ice-run is for,'
said I bitterly.
"And spoil the Alpine Derby, which
you know is fixed for the tenth?"
Frederick addressed me with some se-
verity. “Look hero---you must choose
your sport and stick to it. I am a
ski-er; you don't find me skating or
bobbing or curling."
“Or ski-ing," I added.
“Before ski-ing," be informed me,
"one must have one's ski in perfect con-
dition. Mine are improving daily."
Frederick in fact spent his short
mornings in giving instructions as to
how his ski were to be oiled and rubbed.
All the most complicated operations
of unction and massage were performed
upon them, and all the time Frederick
watched over them as over a sick child.
Next I was told that the height of
the season had arrived. The round of
indoor entertainments went on and
almost daily the guests walked to some
near point to witness performances by
professionals who seemed to tour the
country for that purpose.
Just when there appeared to be a
slight prospect of some general outdoor
activity (and Frederick's ski were pro-
nounced perfect) a thaw occurred. I
am bound to say that the event was
received philosophically. Not a single
member of the company made any
complaint; they faced adversity like
true Britons and boldly sat in the warm
hotel to save themselves for the evening.
Nor did their distress put them off their
feed; they punislied the tea unmerci-
fully, showing scarcely a sign of the
aching sorrow which devoured them.
Soon it froze again. The daily visit
to the ice was made and Frederick's
ski were once more put into training.
As for me I began to believe that
there was something shameful or dis-
graceful in my desire to skate. So I left

IT was really Isabel's idea. But it
must be admitted that the Foxes took
it up with remarkable promptitude.
How it reached them is uncertain, but
maybe the little bird that nests outside

The idea owed its inception to my

the open door I heard a small excited
voice expounding to a lymphatic dolly
the whole mystery of fox-hunting:—
“And there was a wood, and there
was a smell. And all the peoploos
on 'normous huge high horses. And
men all the hound-foxes runned after
the smell and eated it all up.”
A fortnight later, taking a short cut
through the Squire's coverts, I sat
down to enjoy the glory of woodland
springtime. “There was a wood and
there was a smell.” There certainly
was; in fact I was all but sitting upon
an earth. -
All this is credible enough. Now I
hope you will believe the rest of the
story. -
A dirty sheet of paper lay near
Reynard's front doorstep. Idly curious,
I picked it up. Strange paper, a form
of print that I had never seen before;
marked too with dirty pads.
It was a newspaper of sorts. Pro-
minent notices adjured the reader to
“Write to John For about it.” The
leading article was headed
“AN APPEAL.”
“Foxes of Britain ' " it began; “op-
posed though we have always been to
revolutionary politics, a clear line is
indicated to us out of the throes of the
Re-birth. The old feudal relations be-
tween Foxes and Men have had their
day. The England that has been the
paradise of the wealthy, of the pink-
coated, of the doubly second-horsed,
must become that of the oppressed, the
hunted, the hand-to-mouth liver. In a
word, we have had enough of Fox-
Hounds; henceforth we will have
Hound-Foxes.”
Then the policy was outlined. Foxes
could not hunt hounds—no ; but they
could lead them a dog's life. They had
been in the past too sporting; thought
too little of their own safety, too much
of the pleasure of the Hunt and of the
reputation of its country.
Henceforth the League of Hound-
Foxes would dispense justice to the
bursts over the best line in the country;
no more grass and easy fences; no more
favourable crossing points at the Whis-
sendine Brook; no more rhapsodies in
| Field over “a game and gallant
ox.”
A Hound-Fox would be game, but
not gallant. He would carry with him
a large-scale specially - marked map,
showing where bullfinches were un-
stormable; where the only gaps har-
boured on the far side a slimy ditch;
where woods were rideless; where
wire was unmarked ; where railways
lured to destruction—over and through
each and every point would the Hound.
Fox entice the cursing Hunt.
As for the Hounds, they feared no
obstacles, but they hated mockery.
They should be led on to the premises
of sausage factories; through villages,
to be greeted as brothers-in-the-chase
by forty yelping curs; into infant-
schools (that old joke), where the de-
lighted babes would throw arms around
their necks and call them “Doggie,”
until both men and hounds would begin
to question whether the game were
worth the candle.
Therefore let every eligible vulpine
enroll himself to-day as a Hound-Fox.
They must be dog-foxes, rising three or
over, of good stamina, with plenty of
scent, intelligent and preferably unmar-
ried. The League Secretary was
(here followed the name, earth and
covert of a well-known veteran).
There was other matter, of course.
A “Grand Prize Competition—A Tur-
key a Week for Life!” was announced.
A humorous article on Earth-Stoppers
and, on the “Vixens' Page,” a discus-
sion as to the edibility of Pekinese.
Absent-mindedly I crumpled up the
astounding rag and thrust it down the
hole. -

The reception of my story was as
cold as the tea. They weren't such
fools, they said, as to believe it. So,

SURMISES AND SURPRISES.
THE appearance of the Dean of St.
PAUL's at a recent social gathering not
in the character of a wet blanket, but
as a teller of jocund tales and a retailer
of humorous anecdotes, must not be
taken as an isolated and transient trans-
formation, but as foreshadowing a gen-
eral conversion of writers and publicists
hitherto associated with utterances of
a mordant, bitter, sardonic and pessi-
mistic tone.
It is rumoured at Cambridge that
Mr. MAYNARD KEYNEs, mollified by the
reception of his momentous work, has
plunged into an orgy of optimism, the
first-fruits of which will be a treatise
on The Gastronomic Consequences of
the Peace. Those who have been for-
tunate enough to see the MS. declare
that the personal sketches of Mr.
CLYNEs, Mr. G. H. RobFRTs, Mr. Hoo-
vER and M. EscoPFIER are marked by
a coruscating wit unparalleled in the
The account of a
dinner at the “White Horse" is per-
haps the clou of an exceptionally ex-
hilarating entertainment.
This agreeable swing of the pendulum
is further illustrated by the report that
Mr. PHILIP GIBBs, by way of counter-
acting the depression caused by his last
book, is contemplating a palliative under
the title of Humours of the Home Front.
It is hoped that the book will come
out serially in the pages of The Hibbert
Journal. -
Very welcome too is the report, nof
yet officially confirmed, that Sir E.
RAY LANKESTER is engaged on a genial
biography of Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle,
with special reference to his achieve-
ments in the domain of psychical re-
search. -
Other similar rumours are flying
about in Fleet Street, but we give them
with necessary reserve. One of them
credits Mr. Lytton STRACHEY with the
resolve to indite a panegyric of the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY. Another
ascribes to Lord FISHER the preparation
of a treatise on The Evils of Egotism.

According to his sort,
To mia in any form of fight

And Cook is by the ears,

By notices and tears,

“With language dignified and terse
And with a haughty look
I should annihilate the Nurse
And coldly crush the Cook;
And, if they started in to weep,
A word would make them stow

‘That's not effective, merely cheap;
And, what is more, you know it.’”
“You’d bring the Cook,” says she, “to

THE BOAT-RACE AGAIN.
IN June, 1914, I took a house on the
Thames, in order to make sure of a
good view of the Boat-Race; then a
man threw a bomb at Serajevo and
ruined my plans. But now it is going
to happen again. And instead of fight-
ing with a vast crowd at Hammersmith
Bridge I shall simply walk up into the
bathroom and look out of the window.
It is wonderful. -
Yet meanwhile I have lost some of
my illusions about this race. I have a
boat myself; I myself have rowed all
the crowd would get a good look at
them, instead of seeing them for ten
seconds. The race ought to be rowed
against the tide. Then it really would
be a feat of strength; then it really
would take ten years off their lives—
perhaps more. Then perhaps small boys
would drop things on them from the
bridges, as they do on me. I wonder
they don't try to do that now. There
is a certain quiet satisfaction in drop-
ping things on people, especially if
they are labouring under Hammer-
smith Bridge against the tide, and I
should imagine that the temptation to
rudder moving at high speed through a
horse's legs. If the race were rowed
against the tide we should all get
our money's worth; and the oars-
men could then put more realism
into their “After - the - Finish ’’ atti-
tudes. As it is, they roll about in the
boat with a praiseworthy suggestion of
fatigue, but nobody really believes they
are tired—nobody at least who has
rowed on the Thames with the tide.
No, I am afraid the actual race is a
sad hypocrisy. But the training must
be terrible. Think of it. They started

over the course in my boat. It is only
ten feet long, but it is very, very heavy.
Still, I have rowed in it all over the
course—with ease. Yet people talk as
if it was a marvellous thing for eight
men to row a light boat over the same
water. Why is that ? It is because
the ignorant land-lubber regards the
river Thames as a pond; or else he
regards it as a river flowing always to
the sea. He forgets about the tide.
The Boat-Race is rowed with the tide;
they deliberately choose, a moment
when the tide is coming in, and hope
nobody will notice; and nobody does
notice. The tide runs about three
miles an hour, sometimes more; if
they just sat still in the boat they
drop things on a University crew would
be almost irresistible. It is not every-
one who can look back and say, “In
1890 I hit the Oxford stroke in the
stomach with a stone.” As it is,
though, I suppose they go too fast for
that kind of thing.
But apart from the small boys on the
bridges, the present system is most un-
satisfactory for people who know “a
man in the boat.” Even in a football
match it is possible for an aunt occa-
sionally to distinguish her nephew and
say, “Look, there is Edward.” But if
she says, “Look, there is Edward,”
meaning No. 5 in the Cambridge boat,
you know she is imagining. All she

have shouted at them and cursed them
and told them their sins, like a monk tell-
ing his beads—“Bow, you're late; Two,
you're early; Three, you're bucketing;
Four, you're not bucketing enough.”
I listen painfully, hoping against hope
that at least one of the crew may be

at least may be rowing properly. But

row out in my little boat and offer to
tow the incompetents back to Putney.
Yet they seem somehow to travel very
easily and well. But, however harmoni-
| ously they swing past “The Doves" or
quicken to thirty-five at Chiswick Eyot,
I know that in their hearts they are
| hating each other. Goodness, how they
must hate each other For ten weeks
they have been rowing together in the
same boring boat, behind the same bor-
| ing back. Iread withgriminterest about
the periodical shiftings of the crew, how
Stroke has moved to the Bow thwart,
| and Bow has replaced Number Three,
| and Number Three has shifted to the
Stroke position. They may pretend
that all this is a scientific matter of
adjustment, of balance and weight and
so forth. I know better. I know that
Stroke is fed up with the face of Cox,
and that the mole on Number Two's
i neck has got thoroughly on Bow's
nerves, and that if Number Three has
to sit any longer behind Number Four's
expanse of back he will go mad. That
is the secret of it all. But I suppose
they each of them hate the coach, and
that keeps them together.
Of all these sufferers perhaps Cox is
most to be pitied. They all have to
eat what they're told, no doubt, yards
the old days rowing men had to drink
beer at breakfast; I can't think of any-
thing worse, except, perhaps, stout.
But Cox doesn't eat anything at all.
He has to get thinner and thinner.
And if there is one thing worse than
eating beefsteak at breakfast it must
be watching eight rowing men eating
beefsteak at breakfast and not eating
anything yourself.
Yes, beyond question Cox is the real
hero. I watch him dwindling, day by
day, from nine stone to eight stone,
from eight stone to seven stone twelve,
and my heart goes out to the little
fellow. And what a job it is! If any-
thing goes wrong, Cox did it. He kept
too far out or he kept too far in, or too
much in the middle. But who ever
heard of Cox doing a brilliant piece of
steering, or saving the situation, or
even rising to the occasion ? His high-
est ambition is for The Times to say
that he did his work “adequately"—
like the Second Murdererin SHAKSPEARE.
And at the finish he can't even pre-
tend that he's tired, like the other men;
even if there was any spectacular way
of showing that he was half-frozen he
couldn't do it, because he alone is re-
sponsible if one of the steamers runs
over them and they are all drowned.
though, of course, if we did, Stroke
would think it was intended for him.
But indeed I take off my hat to all
of them; not because of the race, which,
as I say, is a piece of hypocrisy, being
rowed with the tide, but because of
the terrible preparation for the race.
I wonder if it is worth it. It is
true that they have lady adorers on
the towing-path at Putney, and it is
even rumoured that they receive anony-
mous presents of chocolates. But pre-
sumably they are not allowed to eat
them, so that these can do little to
alleviate their sufferings. It is true
also that for ever after (if their wives
allow it) they can hang an enormous
oar on the wall and contemplate it
after dinner. But, after all, I can do
that too, if I like; for I too have rowed
over the course.
And I shall have a free view of the
race. But none of them will see it at
all. They will all be looking at the
back of the man in front, except Stroke,
whose eye will be riveted on the second
button of Cox's blazer. What a life'

THE CONSERVATISM OF THE
LIBERAL PARTY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I know you take
no sides in party politics, but I still
think you would like to hear why it is
that I have gone over to the Inde-
pendent Liberals. No, it has nothing to
do with Mr. Asquith's triumphal pro-
cession and still less with the North-
cLIFFE Press. The fact is that till quite
recently I belonged to the truo blue
Tory school—was indeed probably the
last survivor of the Old Guard—and I
found myself out of touch with the
progressive tendencies of modern Tory-
ism, its deplorable way of moving with
the times, its hopeless habit of dis-
carding what it would call the old
shibboleths when it wrongly imagined
them to be outworn. My decision to
deserve its honoured name was imme-
diately due to a Liberal Paper which
editorially ridiculed the Liberty League,
formed for the defeat of Bolshevist pro-
paganda, and pooh-poohed the idea of
the existence of dangerous Bolshevist
elements in the country. This attitude
attracted me enormously; for I recalled
the standpoint of the same paper in the
days before the War—how it ridiculed
the alleged German menace and pooh-
poohed the idea of the existence of
hostile German elements in our midst.
Here, I said, is the party for me; here
is your authentic Bourbon spirit—the
type that learns nothing and forgets
nothing; that in the midst of a changing
world remains immovable as a rock.
Yes, Sir, for a Tory of the old school
there is no place to-day except in the
ranks of Liberalism.

Jones was reading his morning paper
in the opposite corner seat with un-
usual attention, and he disregarded my
greeting.
“Why this absorption ?” I inquired.
“Usually you come to the station with
a piece of toast behind one ear, fasten-
ing your boots as you run, and wake
us all up with your first fine morning
rapture.”
“I was just taking a look at the
exchanges,” he replied. “The mark's
about the same price as fly-paper, and,
judging by the news from New York,
your chewing-gum is going to cost
you more shortly. Do you know any-
thing about the money market?”
“I occasionally see it stated that
‘money is plentiful' in it,” I returned.
“I should think it must be an ideal
place.”
“The most gorgeous thing in the
world is to make a bit on exchange,”
he said. “There's such a splendid feel-
“I understand exactly,” I replied.
“Cox once credited me with an extra
month's pay by mistake. But I didn't
realise that you ever had to think about
money matters after having run our
Mess in France.” -
He appeared to take no offence. His
capacity for being insulted in that
direction had probably been exhausted
during the period in point.
“I know quite a lot about exchange,”
he remarked with a reminiscent smile.
“You remember that when I got pipped
in France in '15, they sent me out next
time to Salonica. I hadn't been there
very long before the question of ex-
change cropped up. In the early days
most of us had English money only,
and the villagers used to rook us fright-
fully changing it. I remember sending
my batman, MacGusgogh, to a place
for eggs, and he came back with the
change for my Bradbury in nickel. I
had a good look at it, and on each coin
was the mystic inscription, “DIHAP,'
which is pronounced ‘dinar.’
to be a Scotsman and yet you've been
diddled. This is Serbian money, and
not worth a bean.'
“‘Oh the deceitfu' deevils,’ said he,
‘there's neither truth nor honesty in
the leein’ buddies, Sir. Dut here's
your Bradbury, an’, at onny rate, we
hae the eggs, Sir, for I paid for them
wi' a label off yin o' they Japaneesy
beer bottles. It seemed an awfu' waste
to spend guid siller on folk that dinna
ken when they see it.'”
I began to see the possibilities of
the money market.
“I was round about there till the
Armistice,” Jones went on, “then I
drifted by stages to South Russia. All
the Eastern countries live by exchange.
Practically the only trade they have
is playing tennis with each others'
currency, and the headquarters of the
industry in 1918 was South Russia.

finance when I'd experienced the franc,

“I thought Russian money was all
dud before that,” I remarked.
“Not a bit of it,” said Jones. “You
see, it's not as if there were one breed,
so to speak, of rouble. There were
KERENsky roubles, and Duma roubles,
and Nicholas roubles, and every little
town had a rouble-works which was
turning out local notes as hard as they
could go. I missed a fortune there by
inches.”
“Tell me,” I said, in response to his
anecdotal eye.
“I had a job there which consisted
of going backwards and forwards on
the railway between Otwiski and Triad-
ropoldir in the Caucasus, a six days'
trip. The possibilities of the situation
never struck me till one day I asked a
shopman in Triadropoldir to give me
my change in Otwiski roubles—both
towns had their own currency, of course.
He gave me five Otwiski roubles for
one of his own town. I thought a bit
about that, and when I got back to
Otwiski I tried the same thing, and
found I could get three Triadropoldir
roubles there for one Otwiski.”
“I see,” I remarked, as the beauty
of this arrangement dawned upon me.
“All I had to do therefore was to
change my money in Otwiski for three
times as much Triadropoldir currency,
and then go up the line to the other
place and change it back again, making
fifteen hundred per cent. on the round
trip. Of course you couldn't always
change the full amount, but in a couple
of months I had sixty thousand roubles
—my valise was crammed with them—
and I was only waiting to get down to
the Field Cashier to change out and
make my fortune.”
“And did you?” I asked.
“No, I didn't. One morning the

THE GREAT MUTTON CAMPAIGN.
THE recent disclosures concerning the enormous stocks
of frozen mutton held by the Ministry of Food—some of it
killed two years ago—have put the Government on their
mettle, and a vigorous campaign is now in preparation with
the object of inducing the public to assist in the disposal of
these overgrown supplies. Mr. Punch, being in touch with
sources of information not accessible to the general Press,
has been able to secure an advance copy of a popular appeal
which is about to be issued broadcast by the Government.
It runs as follows:— - - - … . . .
“Men, Women and Children of the United Kingdom
“The time has now arrived when each one of you is
privileged to illumine these drab days of peace with a show
of patriotism no less brilliant than that which lit up the dark
years of war. The task that is demanded is a simple one,
and no heavy price is exacted; all that is required is a single-
minded concentration upon the one essential need of the
moment. - .
“Your Government, solicitous as always for your welfare,
has during the past two years accumulated a vast store of
nutritious mutton to safeguard you against the peril of
starvation. That danger being happily averted, it is now
up to you to eat the stuff. This is not a problem that can
be tackled by half-measures. If you desire to preserve the
financial stability of the Empire, and if you do not wish to
go on eating antiquated corpses of Australasian sheep for
the rest of your lives, you must set your teeth in grim
earnest, eating against time and chewing over time. You
must consume mutton for breakfast, mutton for luncheon,
you must in the interests of the State become a mutton
glutton. -
“Do you shrink from the task? Do you shirk the chop
now that you know what is at stake? An army marches
on its stomach; the nation's well-being hangs on yours.
Henceforth, until the “Cease Fire' sounds, you must fall
upon the domestic enemy as our gallant soldiers fell upon
the alien foe. No quarter must be given, no quarter, fore
or hind, be permitted to escape. Beef must be banned and
veal avoided as the plague; no Briton worthy of the name
will claim a fowl. -
“What are you going to do about it? Do you intend (t
borrow a Trans-atlantic phrase) to give the frozen miſt
to the frozen mutt? Or are you going to take it to your
bosom and give it there, or thereabouts, the home for which
it has so long been vainly seeking?
, “Do it now and do it always.
be—'Itevenoms d nos moutons.'"
In addition to the foregoing, every British housewife
is to be supplied with a valuable booklet containing a num-
ber of official recipes for dealing with mutton. Among the
tasty dishes thus described may be mentioned Whitehall
Hash, Ministerial Mince, Reconstruction Rissoles, Control
Cutlets and Separation Stew. - -
Mr. Punch also ſearns that in honour of the campaign
the Yeomen of the Guard are henceforth to be popularly
known as the “Muttoneaters.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
DURING the past few years the plays and stories, especially
the stories, of ANToN TCHEhov have so triumphantly cap-
tured English-speaking readers that there must be many
who will welcome with eagerness the volume of his Letters
(CHATTo AND WINDUs). This happy chance we owe, of course,
directly to Mrs. CoNSTANCE GARNETT, who here proves once
again that in her hands translation ranks as a fine art.
Both the Letters and the Biographical Sketch that precedes
them are of extraordinary charm and interest. Because
TchEhov's stories are so conspicuously uncoloured by the
personality of their writer (his method being, as it were, to
lead the reader to a window of absolute transparency and
bid him look for himself), it comes almost as a shock to find
how vivid and many-hued that personality in fact was.
Nor is it less astonishing to observe a nature so alive with
sympathy expressing itself in an art so detached. More
than once his letters to literary friends are concerned with
a defence of this method: “Let the jury judge them ; it's
my job simply to show what sort of people they are.”
They are filled also with a thousand instances of the
author's delight in nature, in country sights and scents,
and of his love and understanding for animals (from which
of the Tales is it that one recalls the dog being lifted into
the cart “wearing a strained smile” 2) Throughout too,
if you have already read the eight little volumes that con-
tain the stories—which I certainly advise as a preliminary
—you will be continually experiencing the pleasure of re-
cognising the inspiration for this or that remembered scene.
In short, one of the most fascinating books that has come
I needn't pretend that Red and Black (METHUEN), by
GRACE S. RichMoSD, is what is known to the superior as a
serious work of art or that the men (particularly) of her
creating are what would be called likely. But there's a
sincerity about the writing which one has to respect. Of
her two heroes, Red is Redfield Pepper Burns, the rude and
rugged doctor, and Black is the Rev. Robert McPherson
Black, the perfect paragon of a padre in an American pro-
vincial town. The author's main thesis is that padres are
made of the right stuff. Black, who was all for getting
into the War from the beginning, rushes off to Europe as
chaplain with the first American drafts, gets wounded,
decorated and married. The conversion of Ited Pepper, the
doctor, and of Jane Ray, who became Mrs. Black, is a little
too easily contrived to be very convincing. But this is a
simple work for simple souls who like a wholesome tale
with a distinct list to the side of the angels. Such un-
toward conduct as here appears is not put in for its own
interesting sake, but merely to bring out the white-souled
nobility of the principals.
If I had to select an author likely to win the long-
distance dialogue race of the British Isles I should, after
reading Uncle Lionel (GRANT RICHARDs), unhesitatingly
vote for Mr. S. P. B. MAIs. It is not however so much the
verbosity as the gloom of Mr. MAIs's characters that leaves
me fretful. Nowadays, when a novel begins with a married
hero and heroine, we should be sadly archaic if we expected
the course of their conjugal love to run smoothly; but I
protest that Michael and Patricia overdid their quarrels,
or, at any rate, that we are told too many details about them.

so much if I were not sure that Mr. MAIs, in his desire to
be forceful and modern, is inflicting a quite unnecessary
handicap upon himself. At present he is in peril of wrecking
his craft upon some dangerous rocks which (though I know
it's not the right name for rocks) I will call “The Doldrums.”
My advice to him is to cheer up. And the sooner the better,
for all of us.
There be novelists so fertile in literary resource or so
catholic in their choice of subject that the reader is never
sure, when he picks up their latest masterpiece, whether he
is to have a comedy of manners, a proletarian tragedy, a
tale of Court intrigue or a satire on the follies of the age.
with the daughter of a peer, and finishing him off as a
member of the Government, alarmed at Socialist hecklers
and welcoming the War as likely to give a new direction to
forces that threaten to become too strong for his well-
meaning incompetence. “It would rouse the ancient spirit
of the people and dispel their madness . . . . Even defeat
as a united nation would be better than ignoble peace with
the anarchic mob supreme.” Of course this may be highly
amusing, but— The fact is that, with a disappointment
the greater from having genial memories of a former book
of his, I have to confess myself one of the dullards for
whom Mr. PickTHALL's satirical darts fall apparently point-
less. I am sorry.
To the steady-going devotee of fiction—the reader on the

accordingly take pleasure in
stating that by those who like
a light narrative, in which mys-
tery and romance are pleasingly
blended, the author of The Point-
ing Man can be relied upon to
fill the bill every time. Con-
formity to type is a strong point
with this author as far as the
mystery and romance are con-
cerned, but within those limits
he (or she) provides an admir-
able range of scene, character
and plot. In The Further Side
of the Door (HUTCHINsoN), the
once handsome and popular hero
emerges from a war-hospital
badly disfigured and is promptly
jilted by his fiancée and avoided,
or so he thinks, by his acquaint-
ances. Disgusted he buries him-
self in an old haunted house in
the wilds of Ireland and aban-
dons himself to the practice of
magic. The result is highly
successful, for he raises, not a
spirit indeed, but something
much more desirable to a lonely
}. man who has been con-
templating suicide. So much
for the romance. The mystery

The publishers of Sir Limpidus (CoLLINs) call it, in large
print, a “new and amusing novel,” but I am not confident
about your subscription to the latter part of that statement;
for Mr. MARMADUKE PickTHALL's irony is either so
subtle or so heavy (I cannot be positive which) that one
may well imagine a not too dull-witted reader going from
end to end without discovering the hidden intent. The
subject of the tale, which has no special plot, is a numbskull
landowner, Sir Limpidus, son of Sir Rusticus, lord of
Clearfount Abbey, and type (according to Mr. PICKTHALL)
of the landowning class that he evidently considers ripe for
abolition. As propaganda to that end he conducts his
hero through the usual career of the pre-war aristocrat,
sending him to public school and Warsity (those sufficiently
I could not help feeling sorry that the public's appetite
for war-literature is reported to have become a little
jaded for anything that is not a book of revelations; and
this because Major E. H. Hody, who was in command
of the 17th Divisional Supply Column, describes his trek
from Flanders to Italy with uncommon zest. It is an
admirable account of an achievement well worth recording,
and the author in his advice to C.O.'s, which seems to me
full of wisdom and sound common-sense, explains how it
was that “the mad 17th" were from first to last “a happy
family.” There is cause for deep sorrow in the thought
that Major Hody died suddenly at Cologne only a few weeks
after his preface was finished. He has left behind him
a book which will be valued not less for what it contains
than for the sake of the man who wrote it.

At the sound of Deutschland über alles,
And warriors slap their fighting pants

A FLAT TO LET.
It was twelve o'clock (noon) and I was sitting over the
fire in our squalid lodgings reading the attractive advertise-
ments of country mansions in a weekly journal. I had just
decided on a delightful Tudor manor-house with every mod-
ern convenience, a nice little park and excellent fishing and
shooting, when Betty burst upon me like a whirlwind.
Her face was flushed and a fierce light shone in her usually
mild blue eyes. She looked like a Maenad or the incarna-
tion of Victory at a bargain sale.
“Come on,” she gasped, seizing me by the arm. “Hurry.”
“Good heavens ! Is the house on fire 2 My child | Let
me save my child.” -
“Oh, do come on,” cried Betty; “there's not a moment
to be lost.” -
“But how can I come on in slippers?” I demanded. “If
I may not save the young Henry Augustus, at any rate let
me put on my boots.” -
Betty's only reply was to drag me from the room, hustle
me through the hall, where I dexterously caught my hat
from the stand in passing, and thrust me into the street.
“I've got a flat,” she panted. “That is, I've got it if
“But, my dear,” I remonstrated as the taxi-driver, cowed
by the look in her eye, drew up to the kerb, “if we take
a taxi we shan't have anything left to pay for the flat.”
“Victory Mansions, Trebarwith Road. Drive fast !”
shouted Betty as she pushed me into the cab.
“Now you've done it,” I said bitterly. “Do you know
I've only five pounds ten on me at the moment? We
shall lose the flat while we're quarrelling with the driver.”
“Oh, dear,” cried Betty, “can't you see that this is
serious? ... It was a wonderful piece of luck. I was passing
the mansions and I happened to look up just as someone
was sticking up a notice, “Flat to Let,” in one of the
windows. There was a beast of a man on the other side of
the street and he simply leapt across the road. I slipped,
or I should have beaten him. As it was he got to the door
a yard ahead of me. We looked over the flat together, but
of course he was first, and he said he was sure it would suit
him, only he must ask his wife. It was awful! I felt as if
I must kill him.”
“So you followed him out and pushed him down the liſt-
shaſt? My dear brave girl!”
“No, but I heard him say he could be back in half-an-
hour. I knew I could do it in twenty-five minutes. Look!”
Betty crushed my hand as in a vice. “There he is.”
As we took a corner on two wheels I looked out and
saw a man running. “Taxi!” he shouted in the hoarse
voice of despair. Our driver sat like a graven image and we
swept on in triumph.
“Oh!” cried Betty suddenly, “suppose that, after all,
somebody else She choked on a sob.
“Courage, dear heart,” I said. “All is not yet lost.”
A moment later we had reached Victory Mansions and
made a dash for the flat. -
“Are we in time?” asked Betty as the door was opened.
“I think so, Ma'am,” said the smiling maid and ushered
us into the presence of the out-going tenant. A tour of the
rooms at express speed showed the flat to be a desirable
one enough. There were three years to run and the rent
was not extortionate—for the times.
“I’ll sign the agreement now,” said I.
“Half-a-minute,” said the out-going tenant as he pro-

MY DEARCHARLEs, In all the stirring
| history of the War I don't know which
has been the most moving sight: the
War Office trying to get me to be a
soldier, or the War Office trying to get
me to stop being a soldier.
Before the late Summer of 1914, Eng-
| land had evinced no burning interest in
| its Henry. It had, in fact, left me to
make my own way, contenting itself
with cautioning me if I didn't stick to
the right side of the road, or to fining me
if I exceeded the speed limit. In August
of that memorable year it got, you will
remember, mixed up in rather a nasty
bother. Searching for friends to get
it out, it bethought itself of Henry, along
with 499,999 others whose names for
the moment I do not recall. Between
us (with subsequent assistance) we set
things to rights, and nothing remained
for Old England save to rid itself grace-
fully of what remained of its few mil-
lions of new-found friends. There was,
however, no shaking off its bosom
pal, Henry. I am one of those loyal
characters whose affection, once gained,
nothing can undo. No use saying to
me: “Well, old man, it's getting late
now ; you must come and see us again
some other day.” I am one of the sort
self about that. I'm going to stay
and go on seeing you now.”
In the early days of demobilisation
there was, I think, a certain novelty
and attraction about my attitude to
the problem. In contrast to the im-
patient hordes crowding the entrance
of the War Office, ringing the front-
door bell violently, tapping on the
window-panes and generally disturbing
that serene atmosphere of peace which
was the great feature of the War in
Whitehall, it was refreshing to think
of Henry, plugging quietly away else-
where at his military duties, undeterred
by armistices, peaces and things of
that kind. I fancy I was well thought
of in those days at the War House.
“Say what you like about him,” I
can hear A.G.4 remarking to M.S. 19
(decimal 9 recurring) as they met in
the corridor on their way to lunch,
“but I find him a patient, well-behaved
young fellow.”
“Yes,” would be the thoughtful an-
swer, “it seems almost a pity we are
going to lose him.”
Speaking strictly between ourselves,
I have never thought much of the Mili-
tary Secretary branch. What made
them think they were going to lose me
as easily as all that 2
What I said to myself was: “Henry,
pence a day is thirteen shillings and
eleven pence a day; now isn't it? And
war isn't war when there is a peace
coming on. Why then throw up a fat
income just for the sake of getting into
long trousers? You stay where you are
till they come and fetch you.”
So I just stayed where I was, and I
conducted the operation with such
ability and tact that Whitehall came
to forget all about me. My name went
on appearing, with ever-increasing
dignity and beauty, in the Army List;
but that made no difference. You see,
though lots of people write the Army
List, no one ever reads it; only from
time to time a man will surreptitiously
turn up his own name, just to renew
his feeling of self-importance, or in an
emergency he will look up the name
of a friend in order to get the right
initials after it and not risk giving that
personal offence which may prevent
the loan. . . . -
But when I say that I stayed where
I was I don't mean to suggest that I
didn't go on leave in the usual way. In-
deed I often came home, in full regi-
mentals, too, partly to impress you and
partly to travel first-class at your ex-
pense. Fellow-passengers neverthought
of turning on me and rending me, as
being the cause of six-shillings-in-the-

and make friendly conversation with
me, leading up to the point that they
had been soldiers themselves once, but
had given it up, owing to having been
told that the War was finished.
I would be just as polite to them,
telling them they might count on me to
return to the discomforts and risks of
civil life as soon as I could be spared
from the front. They had never the in-
telligence or daring to ask, “The front
of what ?" -
Now the climax has arrived; I am
asked if they must throw me out or
will I go quietly 2 I fancy I have been
caught by one of those card-indexes. I
suspect some Departmental General of
showing off to a friend. “This is my
IN basket,” I can hear him explaining
as he shows his audience his office;
“every letter which comes in goes into
the IN. That is my out basket, and
every letter which goes out goes out of
the out.
“And then, Sir, we have the Card In-
dex. A complete record of every officer
| in the Army, permanent or temporary."
“Are there still temporary officers
in the Army 2" asks the audience, not
| being able to think of anything better
to ask, and clearly being called upon to
ask something.
“Sergeant-Major, turn up ‘Oſficers,
army, temporary, the, in,' for this gentle-
man." -
| And thus the shameful truth comes
| out. One card only—mine.
Exit audience wondering what man-
ner of intrepid man this Henry might be.
Originally the W.O. had had a great
idea; they caused my regiment softly and
silently to vanish away, thinking that
I would vanish with it. But I had
| been too sharp for them. Learning that
they were bent on “disembodying" me,
and not liking the sound of the word,
I had very quietly removed myself from
my regiment to the Staff. Thus for a
few happy months we see the W.O.
| rendered inert.
My final defeat was due to a chance
remark of my own, made to one of the
fifty-nine officers under whose direct
command I served. Upon my first
arriving on his Staff he had said to me,
“Oh, by the way, P.S.C., of course?”
Quite affable, frank and to the point;
“P.S.C., of course?” -
Not knowing the language, I could
not make an equally affable answer. I
asked him to repeat the question, but
to change the code. .
“You have Passed Staff College, of
course?” he said a little less affably.
I then had the misfortune to answer:
“Why, of course, if you mean that tall
building on the right as I came up here
from the station ?”

not only wanting in essential parts, but
was also the sort of person who jested
on religious subjects. He never forgot
the matter; indeed, when applied to
(under “Secret and Confidential” cover)
to suggest a means of getting rid of me,
he very clearly remembered it. At once ||
every department in the War House
got busy; the interest of the Secretary
of State was enlisted, and the War
Cabinet decided that for permanent
purposes my post must necessarily be
held by a P.S.C. man. Done in by what
was little better, when you come to
think of it, than a mere postscript.
Please understand that there was no
talk of discharging me; no talk of de-
mobilising me; no talk even of dis-
embodying me. Without any reflection
on my conduct and merely upon the
grounds that, not being P.S.C., I could
not be regarded as quite right in the
head, they intimated their intention of
vacating my appointment by the simple
process of an advertisement in the
fashionable columns of The London
“What happens next 2 " I asked.
“You will return to regimental
duty,” they said. '
“But there isn't any regiment,” I
pointed out triumphantly, “therefore

They didn't seem to mind that, and
for some time I wondered why. Then
a thought occurred to me.

like these.
THE GENIUS OF MR. BRADSHAW.
(By our Literary Expert.)
No one will be surprised to hear that
the Christian name of Mr. BRADSHAw'
was George. Indeed, it is difficult to
think what other name a man of his
calibre could have had. But many
people will be surprised to hear that
Mr. BRADSHAw is no longer alive.
Whatever one thinks of his work one
is inclined to think of him as a living
personality, working laboriously at
some terminus—probably at the Char-
ing Cross Hotel. But it is not so. He
died, in fact, in 1853. His first book
—or rather the first edition of his
book “ —was publishcd in 1839; yet,
unlike the author, it still lives. He is,
in fact, the supreme example of the
posthumous serial writer. I have no
information about Mr. DEBRETT and
Mr. BURRE, but the style and substance
of their work are relatively so flimsy
that one is justified, I think, in neglect-
ing them. In any case their public is
a limited one. So, of course, is Mr.
* “Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam
Navigation Guide for Great Britain and Ire-
BRADSHAw's; but it is better than theirs.
Mr. DEBRETT's book we read idly in an
idle hour; when we read Mr. BRAD-
SHAw's it is because we feel that we
simply must; and that perhaps is the
surest test of genius.
It is no wonder that in some circles
Mr. BRADSHAw holds a position com-
parable only to the position of Hoy E.R.
I once knew an elderly clergyman who
knew the whole of Mr. BRADshAw's
book by heart.
without hesitation the time of any
train from anywhere to anywhere else.
He looked forward each month to the
new number, as other people look for-
ward to the new numbers of maga-
zines. When it came he skimmed
eagerly through its pages and noted
with a fierce excitement that they
had taken off the 5.30 from Larne
Harbour, or that the 7.30 from Gala-
shiels was stopping that month at
Shankend. He knew all the connec-
tions; he knew all the restaurant
trains; and, if you mentioned the 6.15
to Little Buxton, he could tell you off-
hand whether it was a Saturdays Only
or a Saturdays Excepted.
This is the exact truth, and I gathered
that he was not unique. It seems that
there is a Bradshaw cult; there may
even be a Bradshaw club, where they
meet at intervals for Bradshaw dinners,
after which a paper is read on “Changes,
I have made, with some Observations on
Salisbury.” I suppose some of them
have first editions, and talk about
them very proudly; and they have hot
academic discussions on the best way
to get from Barnham Junction to
Cardiff without going through Bristol.
Then they drink the toast of “The
Master” and go home in omnibuses.
My friend was a schoolmaster and took
a small class of boys in Bradshaw; he
said they knew as much about it as he
did. I call that corrupting the young.
But apart from this little band of
admirers I am afraid that the book
does suffer from neglect. Who is there,
for example, who has read the “Direc-
tions” on page 1, where we are actually
shown the method of reading tenta-
tively suggested by the author himself?
The ordinary reader, coming across a
certain kind of thin line, lightly dis-
misses it as a misprint or a restaurant
car on Fridays. . If he had read the
Preface he would know that it meant a
SHUNT. He would know that a shunt
means that passengers are enabled to
continue their journey by changing
into the next train. Whether he would
know what that means I do not know.
The best authorities suppose it to be a
poetical way of saying that you have
to change—what is called an euphe-
He could tell you.
No, you must not neglect the Preface;
and you must not neglect the Appendix
on Hotels. As sometimes happens in
works of a philanthropic character, Mr.
BRADSHAw's Appendix has a human
charm that is lacking in his treatment of
his principal theme, the arrival and de-
parture of trains. To the careful stu-
dent it reveals also a high degree of
organisation among his collaborators,
the hotel-managers. It is obvious, for
example, that at Bournemouth there
must be at least one hotel which has
the finest situation on the South coast.
Indeed one would expect to find that
there was more than one. But no;
Bournemouth, exceptionally fortunate
in having at once the most select hotel
on the South coast, the largest and
best-appointed hotel on the South coast
and the largest and most up-to-date
hotel on the South coast, has positively
only one which has the finest position
on the South coast. Indeed, there is
only one of these in the whole of Eng-
land, though there are two which have
the finest position on the East coast.
How is it, we wonder, that with so
much variation on a single theme such
artistic restraint is achieved ? It is
clear, I think, that before they send in
their manuscripts the hotel-managers
must meet somewhere and agree to-
gether the exact terms of their contri-
butions to the book. “The George”
agrees that for the coming year “The
Crown" shall have the “finest cuisine
in England,” provided “The George"
may have “the most charming situation
imaginable,” and so on. I should like
to be at one of those meetings.
This is the only theory which accounts
for the curious phrases we find so fre-
quently in the text:—“Acknowledged to H
be the finest”; “Admittedly in the best
position.” Who is it that acknowledges
or admits these things? . It must be
the other managers at these annual
meetings. Yes, the restraint of the
collaborators is wonderful, and in one
point only has it broken down. There
are no fewer than seventeen hotels with
an Unrivalled Situation, and two of
these are at Harrogate. For a small
place like the British Isles it seems to
me that this is too many.
For the rest, what imagery, what
exaltation we find in this Appendix'
Dazed with imagined beauty we pass
from one splendid haunt to another.
One of them has three golf-courses of
its own; several are replete with every
comfort (and is not “replete” the perfect
epithet?). Here is a seductive one “on

lacked one important attribute of a

“And by a singular chance the plug

“That is my case, me luds,” said
Percival simply. “If the silent Navy
wants to beat my Elfred it's got to rise

a stupendous boxing tournament in the

“Sh!” replied Frederick. “He hasn't
been told it's a boxing contest. He
thinks it's a clog-dancing competition
and is giving the points for foot-
work.”
Unfortunately the M.C. did not hear.
He was speaking himself.
“The next bout should conclude our
programme,” he said, “but I am asked
to announce that Private Henson
challenges Private Fry to box six two-
“The referee ||
francs against a small article of no
intrinsic value.”
Enthusiastic applause greeted the
announcement. A disturbance in the
rear of the hut indicated that Elfred
was heading for cover.
“’E's twice my size,” he wailed as
strong hands hauled him back.
“The challenger admits that he holds
a slight advantage in weight,” con-
tinued the M.C., “but considers that is
counterbalanced by hisadvanced years.”
“This is your fiendish work,” hissed
Percival to Frederick.
“Not a bit of it, old sportsman,”
replied Frederick cheerfully. “The
patent rights are held by 'Enery. I
merely mentioned to him that Elfred
possessed a desirable bath-plug that it
might be useful to acquire.”
Percival left his seat to confer with
the shrinking Elfred.
“’E can 'ave the old bath-plug an'
welcome, Sir, as far as I'm concerned,"
said the latter. -
“Tut, tut!” said Percival. “You must
make a fight for it. The honour of the
Army is at stake.”
“I ain't all that set on the honour of
the Army,” said Elfred. “But'im being
the challenger, shouldn't I be justified
in putting the plugin one of my gloves?”
“The rules don't provide for such a
contingency. Hurry up now and get
stripped, and I'll give you twenty
Both combatants were warmly re-
ceived. 'Enery's decorative tattooing
was much admired, and Elfred was
urgently requested not to spoil the
pictures. By desire of the referee the
stakes were handed to him—Frederick
producing the five francs for 'Enery—
and the battle commenced.
It was early evident that the Navy
intended shock tactics, while the Army
favoured a system of elastic defence.
A salvo of short-arm jabs by 'Enery
was answered by long-range sniping on
the part of Elfred, no direct hits being
recorded. Towards the end of the round
"Enery attempted to approach under
cover of a smoke screen, but action was
broken off at the sound of the gong.
The second round opened sensa-
tionally. Elfred, on the advice of his
seconds, was “making use of the ring”
when he accidentally collided with his
opponent coming in thereverse direction
and gave him a violent thump without
return. There seemed every prospect
of trouble, but clever footwork pre-
vented the incident developing into a
racas. Round two concluded with
Elfred leading handsomely by one point
to nothing.
“Two to one on Elfred,” said Per-
cival excitedly. -
“Take you—in bath plugs,” answered
Frederick, carefully entering the bet.
"Enery equalised in the third round,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 15th.-The great Food-
prices debate hardly justified its pre-
liminary advertisement. Mr. McCURDY
took sure ground when he argued that
high prices were mainly due to
world - shortage; and, though
he entered more disputable
territory when he declared that
the Profiteering Act was not
primarily intended to punish
profiteers, Mr. Asquith did not
seriously attempt to dislodge
him. Indeed, the Ex-PREMIER's
speech was mainly composed
of truisms, his only excursion
into the speculative being an
assertion—with which not all
economists will agree — that
inflation of currency is a con-
sequence and not a cause of
high prices.
An ex-Food Controller, Mr.
GEORGE ROBERTs, defended the
Government against charges
of extravagance, and ventured 4
to remind Labour—as THOMAs
DRUMMOND reminded Irish
landlords—that it had duties
as well as rights.
Early in the evening the ,
PRIME MINISTER, who had sat
through many speeches in
º
House of Commons objecting to their
speeches being reported, but apparently
some of them do—when the reporters
are police constables. The HoME SECRE-
TARY thought it quite possible that if

readiness for the threatened
attack, folded his notes and
silently stole away. -
On the adjournment General
PAGE CROFT accused the Ministry of
Munitions of unfair treatment to one of
its employees. The peroration to Mr.
KELLAway's spirited defence deserves
quotation: “The decision taken by
the Ministry is a decision that will
stand.” That's the stuff to give 'em.
Tuesday, March 16th.-The Lord
CHANCELLOR was so unusually apolo-
getic in his exposition of the War Emer-
gency Laws (Continuance) Bill that
none of the Peers had the heart seri-
ously to oppose him. Lord SALISBURY

official stenographers might think it
worth while to take down their utter-
ances; but I gathered that he was not
prepared to give any guarantee on the
subject, and that Colonel WEdgwood

took note of the Government's admis- (7%
sion that they were anxious to say
Good-bye to D.O.R.A. and only com-
plained that the farewell ceremony was
so long-drawn-out. Lord BUCKMASTER
failed to understand why D.O.R.A.
should have a longer life in Ireland
than in England, and was so carried
away by his own eloquence as to
declare that all the crimes attributed
to the Sinn Feiners had been due
“to misguided attempts to enforce
special legislation against a misunder-
stood and a gallant people.” Lord
BIRKENHEAD replied that there was at
least a plausible case for the contention
that the boot was on the other leg.

must not count too confidently on hav.
ing a further road to fame opened to
them.
Mr. BoxAR LAw read a telegram from
Lord KILMARNOCK regarding the situa-
tion in Berlin. As it was already a
day old, was admittedly based
on a communiqué from Wolff's
Bureau, “censored" by Mr.
TREBITsch LINcolN (late Lib-
eral Member for Darlington),
and had in the meantime been
officially contradicted by the
old Government, it did not add
much to our knowledge.
Time was when it was usual
to move to reduce a Vote by a
hundred pounds if you wanted
to defeat the Government. But
such paltry figures are no good
3/s in these spacious days. Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN's proposed
leduction in the Vote on Ac-
count for the Civil Services was
the much more mouth-filling
§ morsel of one hundred million
*N pounds. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
§ considered it very handsome
` of the Opposition, on the eve,
he understood, of coming into
office, thus to cut off its own
supplies. Nevertheless he de-
clined to accept the generous
offer. Our finances would be
all right if the House would
back the Government by prac-
tising economy as well as
preaching it. As it was, he
thought the worst was over, for—
strange and agreeable phenomenon—
the floating debt was sinking.
After this it was, perhaps, not very
complimentary of Mr. J. W. WILson to
urge the Government to put forth their
best speakers. The PRIME MINISTER
was still coy, but Sir Robert HoſtNE,
in virtue of his new office as President
of the Board of Trade, stepped nimbly
into the breach, and made a speech so
cheerful both in substance and delivery
as to justify the hope that in him the
Government have found the HoRNE of
º Plenty.
Wednesday, March 17th.-Seventeen
years ago Lord BALFour of BURLEIGH,
as a hard-shell Free Trader, sacrificed
office sooner than bow the knee to
the new gods of Birmingham. This
afternoon he brought in a Bill (to safe-
guard “key industries” and counteract
N | “dumping") which would have glad-
ºldened the heart of Mr. Joseph Cham-
BERLAIN. Some of the other Free
& Trade Peers were still unrepentant.
Lord BEAUCHAMP, for example, declar-
ing that shipping was our real “quay-
industry” and needed no protection,
announced his intention of moving the


It is unusual to find Members of the

although one of the authors of the Paris
resolutions, on which the measure was
ostensibly based, thought that it went
far beyond present necessities. The only
dumps with which Germany was likely
to be associated for some time to come
were doleful, not aggressive. -
The Report of the Supplementary
Estimates furnished the Commons with
abundant points for criticism. In pro-
testing against an increase in the re-
muneration of the Law Officers, Mr.
Hogg|E revealed a hitherto unsuspected
admiration for the PRIME MINISTER,
whose services, he considered, were
most inadequately rewarded with five
thousand pounds a year and no pension.
If anyone deserved an increase of salary
it was he.
Mr. Tyson-WILsoN had the temerity
to complain that the Government were
not finding work for all the disabled
ex-Service men whom they trained in
the technical schools, and laid himself
open to a damaging “tu quoque" from
Sir Robert HoRNE, who pointed out
that this lack of employment was
largely due to the trade unions, which
refused to admit these men as “im-
provers.”
In introducing the Naval Estimates
for eighty odd millions Mr. LoNG was
them larger.
The personnel has been
drastically reduced, and parents are
actually being offered a premium of
three hundred pounds to remove their
sons from Osborne. On the other hand
promotion from the lower deck was to
be encouraged, and in future every
youngster entering the Navy would
metaphorically carry a broad-pennant
in his ditty-box.
Thursday, March 18th.-A proposal
to erect a military monument on a
hill near Jerusalem was adversely
criticised by Lord TREoweN. Lord
South Borough, as a recent visitor to
the Holy City, thought that the Govern-
ment would be better advised to de-
molish some of the recent buildings,
including the ex-Kaiser's ridiculous
clock-tower, which had not even the
negative merit of telling the time.
fn consequence of his rather exhaust-
ing séance with the Liberal Party the
PRIME MINISTER was looking a little
jaded. But he perked up wonderfully
when Mr. WILL THoRNE, a propos of a
story that the Russian Soviet Govern-
ment had introduced martial law into
the workshops, asked whether he did not
think that all able-bodied people ought
to be compelled to work. There was
the old twinkle in his eyes as he re-
to know if that was the view of the
trade unions. From recent information
I gather that the bricklayers, at any
rate, would not subscribe to it.
Upon the further consideration of the
Navy Estimates General SEELY urged
the re-establishment of the Com-
mittee of Imperial Defence. Mr.
LoNG said the Admiralty were most
anxious for it, Mr. Asquith also ap-
proved, but from his ten years' experi-
ence as its President entered a caveat
against expecting the Committee to
take upon itself executive functions.
“Had it done so,” he observed, “there
would have been collisions, cross-pur-
poses, waste of application, and in
many cases something approaching
to administrative confusion.” Which
things of course never occurred under
his régime of shall I say?—expectant
watchfulness.
The rest of the debate was chiefly re-
markable for Lady Astor's bold declar-
ation, “The sea belongs to England,
and it could not be in better hands.”
Coming from a country-woman of Mr.
DANIELs it was doubly exhilarating.

THE LATEST PARTY.
(Being the Diary of a well-intentioned
Voter.)
Monday.—Important article in my
morning paper on the serious political
outlook. Recommends the formation
of a new party to carry out progressive
reforms and combat the forces of Revo-
lution and Anarchy. Sounds excellent.
The new party is to be called the
People's Party. I decide to join it.
Tuesday.—By a fortunate mistake my
newsagent placed wrong paper on my
step to-day. Find I was being misled
by the sheet I usually take. A new
party to carry out progressive reforms
and combat the forces of Revolution
and Anarchy has already been formed.
It is called the National Party. I
decide to join it.
Wednesday.—Attended public meet-
ing advertised as being in support of
the new party. Expected to hear all
about the programme of the National
Party. Instead was urged to join the
Modern Party, to carry out progressive
reforms and combat the forces of Revo-
lution and Anarchy. Signed card before
leaving the hall pledging my support.
Thursday.—Dined with Brooks, who
takes very grave view of the state of
the country. Said what we really want
is a new party. Went on to outline some
urgent progressive reforms and men-
tioned one or two necessary steps for
combating the forces of Revolution and
Anarchy. Suggested that he and I
should try to start a local branch of the

Friday.—Johnson called at the office
during my busiest hour. Wanted to
enrolme as a member of a new party, to
be known as the Efficiency Party. No
time to go into it properly, so agreed,
to get rid of him. Anyhow, the object's
a good one. It was something about
progressive reforms and combating the
forces of Revolution and Anarchy.
Saturday.—Heard at the Club that
if the Coalition is not better supported
in their attempts to carry out progres:
Revolution and Anarchy, they will form
themselves into a new party and go to
the country. Locally we are to have,
in addition to the retiring Coalitionist,
a Free Liberal candidate, a Labour
Party candidate, a couple of Indepen-
dent candidates, a People's Party can-
didate, a National Party candidate, a
Modern Party candidate, a Britannic
Party candidate, and an Efficiency
Party candidate. A raid this would

AT THE PLAY.
“THE TRUTH ABOUT THE RUSSIAN
DANCERs.”
With that uncanny tuition of his
Sir JAMEs BARRIE has, of course, hit on
the precise truth. Russian dancers are
not born but made—by the Maestro,
which I take it is (broadly speaking)
Italian for Producer and Presenter.
When Karissima goes on a visit to
the stately home of the Veres the peace
of that ancient haunt of the conven-
tionally correct is queerly- broken.
Young Lord Were loses his heart. How-
ever, that might just as easily or more
easily have happened if the Gaiety had
been invited. But a dreadſul change
comes to Uncle Bill—he buys his clothes
ready-made (at La boutique fantasque,
for a guess, or possibly Mr. MALLABY-
DEELEY's), grows dundrearies and goes
hopelessly off his game at golf.
Karissima, poor dear, can't walk or
talk or putt, for that matter, except
with her toes. Bill calls this last cheat-
ing, but young Were thinks it simply
adorable—as do we all. Lady Vere,
his mother, can't get used to being
kissed by Karissima, who will stand
upon her lightly with one foot, oddly
waving the other meanwhile in the
air. Besides it takes too long and is
rather too demonstrative. And couldn't
Karissima dear just try to walk with
her soles really flat on the ground in
the solid English county way ? Cer-
tainly Karissima will try, to please
Madame, and with painful effort
achieves a half-dozen clumsy steps till
unconquerable habit and Mr. ARNOLD
BAx's allusively witty music liſt her
on tiptoe again. And really she is such
a darling that the once reluctant dow-
ager finally consents to the marriage;
wedding bells forth with (within); a
white-haired clergyman, surprised at
nothing, as becomes the very best type
of padre, appears; follow corps de ballet
bridesmaids; and Bill gives her away.
larissima, says Were to Maestro later
in the evening, is depressed. Because
she hasn't a child. They both tremend-
ously want a child. Maestro, silently
showing his watch-dial, would seem to
wish to suggest that they were un-
reasonably impatient. Karissima also
pleads. Well, he will see what he can
do. But there's an awful penalty.
For a new Russian dancer cannot be
made unless another, surrenders life.
Anyway he fetches his black bag.
And Karissina dances down the main
staircase with her babe, who grows
apace and is shortly seen prancing
in the garden (on his toes—“Thank
Heaven!” says the Maestro).
And Karissima dies and is brought in
own funeral service. Maestro's heart
is touched; he lies down in her stead,
and she, dancing on a carpet of thistle-
down shot with stars (I think), and
her lord (I am sure), perpetually ex-
claiming, “How perfectly topping!"—
both achieve an enviable immortality.
Madame KARSAVINA is exquisite; she
is well supported by Mr. C. M. LowNE
(Hon. 131 ll), Mr. HERMAN DE LANGE
(Maestro), Miss G. STERRoll (Dowager),
and Mr. BASIL Foster (Lord Were).
And I thought I detected Mr. Du
MAURIER's appreciation of the bizarre
in his production. But the triumph
is the triumph of the whimsical author.
I don't think he has ever done any-
thing better; more ambitious things,
yes, but nothing so free from flaw.
Isn't it more than possible that just
three-score years ago, on a May day
(see Who's Who), some Maestro of
Fantasy slipped into a little house in
Kirriemuir, N.B., with a black bag?
Wouldn't that explain the otherwise
inexplicable, the unwearying resource-
fulness, the unabashed playfulness of

DRAM. BAC.
A suggestion has been put forward,
with the support of the British Drama
League and others, for the establish-
ment at our universities of a “Faculty
of the Theatre and Dramatic Degree.”
Heartily applauding the proposal, we
append a typical examination paper
for the final school:—
(1) Sketch briefly the progress of
amateur acting in this country, from
the impersonation of a Danish minstrel
by ALFRED THE GREAT, to the Victory
Varieties Matinée arranged by Lady
Eve Tatlery.
(2) Arrange, in order of probability,
the first fiſty authors of SHARSPEARE.
(3) “The Battle of Waterloo was
won on the playing - fields of Eton.”
Estimate the rival claims of the
Windsor Strollers.
(4) Indicate your make-up for RoM-
ULUS, HENRY THE EIGHTH, ABRAHAM
LINCOLN.
(5) What is a point, and how made?
A “straight" line lies evenly between
any good points; give instances.
(6) Under what dramatic conditions
can a part be greater than the whole 2
Cite the authority of any two actor-
managers for this theory.
(7) Explain, with diagrams, (a) The
Eternal Triangle ; (b) Squaring the
Upper Circle.
(8) Illustrate the axiom that the
length of a run varies with the breadth
of the dialogue.
(9) What proportion of the music-
supplied by (a) Lancashire; (b) Scot-
and 2
(10) Which European drama requires
most doors for its honeymoon farces 2
(11) “What Manchester thinks to-
day England will think next Sunday
evening.” Analyse this statement in
its bearing upon the play-producing
societies.
(12) “Let who will make a nation's
laws so that I make its songs.” Discuss
the ethical and sociological significance
of this with regard to (a) “Where do
flies go in the winter-time?” (b) “I
do like an egg with my tea."
In the vivá-roce portion of the exam-
ination, candidates for Honours will be
required to satisfy the examiners (to the
point of actual tears) by their recital of
selected passages from prepared books.
They may offer any two of the follow-
ing: “Buckingham's Farewell; ” “The
Signalman's Daughter;” “The Death

TRIALS OF THE FISH-TRADE.
“CLoIIIES, MY DEAR DoN'T MENTION cloth Es. YoU ou GHT TO BE IN THE FISH LINE. WHY, I RUNS THROUGH A set o' Fu its
1N ABOUT A MONTH ! ”
A NOTE TO NATURE,
accounting for my previous silence in an unusually tem-
perate March and also presenting an ultimatum.
YE great brown hares, grown madder through the
Spring !
Ye birds that utilise your tiny throttles
To make the archways of the forest ring
Or go about your easy house-hunting !
Ye toads! ye axolotls
Ye happy blighters all, that squeal and squat
And fly and browse where'er the mood entices,
Noting in every hedge or woodland grot
The swelling surge of sap, but noting not
The rise in current prices !
But chiefly you, ye birds, whose jocund note
(Linnets and larks and jays and red-billed ousels)
Oft in those happier springtides now remote
Caused me to catch the lyre and clear my throat
After some coy refusals |
Ay, and would cause me now—I have such bliss
Seeing the star-set vale, the pearls, the agates
Sown on the wintry boughs by Flora's kiss—
Only the trouble in my case is this,
I do not feed on maggots.
Could I but share your diet cheap and rude,
Your simple ways in trees and copses lurking;
But no, I need a pipe and lots of food,
A comfortable chair on which to brood—
Could I but know that freedom from all care
That comes, I say, from gratis sets of suitings
And homes that need not premium nor repair
Except with sticks and mud and moss and hair,
My! there would be some flutings.
So and so only would the ivory rod
Stir the wild strings once more to exaltation,
So and so only the impetuous god
Pound in my bosom and produce that odd
Tum-tiddly-um sensation.
And often as I heard the throstles vamp,
Pouring their liquid notes like golden syrup,
Out would I go and round the garden tramp,
Wearing goloshes if the day were damp,
And imitate their chirrup.
Or, bowling peacefully upon my bike,
Well breakfasted, by no distractions flustered,
Pause near a leafy copse or brambled dyke,
And answer song for song the black-backed shrike,
The curlew and the bustard. -
But now—ah, why prolong the dreadful strain 2–
Limply my hand the unstrung harp relaxes; -
The dear old days will not come back again
Whatever Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN
Does with the nation's taxes. -

THE METHODS OF GENIUS.
(By our Special Literary Parasite.)
THE public already know something
of the painful difficulties under which
novelists labour at the present moment
owing to the paper shortage and the
enhanced cost of book production. But
“the economic consequences of the
Peace" by no means exhaust the han-
dicaps of the conscientious and sensitive
novelist. We are glad therefore to note
the efforts of . The Daily Graphic to
enlist the sympathy of the public on
behalf of this sorely tried and meritori-
ous class. Our contemporary tells us,
for example, of one momentous writer
who was reduced to dictating blindfold
“because the facial peculiarities of first
one and then another amanuensis” up-
set her equanimity. Then there is the
tragic story of Mr. R. L. HICHENs, who,
being engaged to write an article against
time, sent out for a stenographer, who
on arrival proved to be a man with a
large black beard of so sinister an
aspect that Mr. Hiche Ns was forced
to dismiss him and write the article in
his own hand. Yet Mr. HICHENs is not
he works best in big hotels and not, as
we might have guessed, in the seques-
tered tranquillity of a minaret. . . .
To some writers solitude is the true
school of genius. Yet Sir LEWIs MoRRIs
found some of his happiest thoughts
come to him while travelling in the
Underground, while Mr. W. B. YEATs
records a similar experience as the re-
sult of a journey on the top of a tram-
car. Your advanced modernists, with
MARINETTI at their head, find their best
stimulus to creative effort in the clang
and clatter of machinery. Percontra, to
return to The Daily Graphic, Mrs. C. N.
WILLIAMSON must have pretty things
to look at “in business hours.” But the
happiest of all our authors is Madame
ALBANESI, who “finds her brain-spur
in a blank sheet of paper, and not the
ghost of an idea what she is going to
write about.” Less fortunate writers
labour assiduously only to leave the
minds of their readers a blank, without
the ghost of an idea of what the author
has been writing about.
It is a pity that Mr. W. L. GEORGE,
in his interesting survey of modern
writers of fiction in the English Review,
of the “Neo-Victorians" and “Semi-
Victorians,” the “Edwardians” and
“belated Edwardians,” and the
“Georgians” and “Neo-Georgians.”
With all these classes he deals faith-
fully. But his criticism is purely liter-
ary. He fails to tell us the things that
every reader wants to know. It is all
very well to say that the neo-Georgians
“ paint in ink,” but he ought to have
mentioned whether it is green or red.
Does Miss DoRo THY RICHARDsoN dic-
tate to the sound of trumpets, garbed
in crimson trouserloons? Does Mr.
ARNoLD BENNETT cantillate his “copy”
into the horn of a graphophone or use
a motor-stylus? Does Mr. SIEGFRIED
SAssoon beat his breast with one hand
while he plays the loud bassoon with
the other? Does Mr. ALEC WAUGH
use sermon-paper or foolscap? Does
Mr. ALDous HUXLEY keep a tame go-
rilla? These are the really illuminating
details that we hunger for. Without
them it is impossible to appreciate the
artistry of our young Masters. Mr.
W. L. GEORGE has given us a glimpse
of the working of their brains; let him
now reveal to us the secrets of their

ONE of THESE DAYS I'LL–I'LL–wning ITS conFoundED NECK.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
After the Day: Germany Unconquered and Unrepentant
(JENKINs) is the kind of thesis-book which it is wise to read
in a deliberately incredulous mood. Mr. HAYDEN TALBOT
is an American newspaper man of immense resourcefulness
but, I should judge, of a not conspicuously judicial habit of
mind. That, perhaps, is hardly a newspaper man's busi-
ness. He is after copy, and certainly there's good enough
copy in, his interviews with Count BERNstoRFF and Dr.
RATHENAU, and one must admire his feat of getting out of
these and seven other German publicists, including MAXI-
MILIAN HARDEN, the draft of a manifesto to the people of
America, composed in the hope, vain as it happened, that
the KAISER would break his long silence and sign it. It is
the author's theory that it is the inner camarilla, working
for a speedy restoration of the monarchy, that is responsible
for the certainly uncharacteristic reticence of Amerongen.
Mr. TALBOT also interviewed HINDENBURG, whom he found a
“broken-down, inconsequential, garrulous example of sen-
ility;” LUDENDoRFF, who was very stiff and proud and rude;
and the fiancée of the man who sank the Lusitania. His
general idea of Germany is summed up in the remark of
Mr. MANDELBAUM, of New York: “All this talk about
Fritz being down and out is all bunk!” Germany is full
of energy and hate; she will soon be a monarchy again ;
supremacy as the way to revanche. I take it that this is
not so much a book as a réchauffé of newspaper articles,
which alone will account for its formlessness and frequent
changes of plane. Mr. TALBOT, confessing to a total ignor-
ance of the German tongue, seems quite unconscious that
this imposes certain limitations on his capacity to make
an adequate survey of a difficult problem.
I may confess at once that I finished the first chapter of
The Woman of the Picture (HopDER AND SToughton) in a
mood of slight derision, induced by Mr. G. F. TURNER's
allowing one hero to say of the other that he had “the
interminable limbs '' of an aristocrat. To the end of
the book indeed I was uncertain whether such occa-
sional lapses were meant to illumine the character of
the supposed speaker or were unintentional. But again
to quote, this time a phrase in which Mr. TURNER clearly
shares my own delight, “before we were through with the
affair" such details had ceased to be of moment. The
plain fact is that The Woman of the Picture is the most
breathless, irresistible piece of convincing impossibility you
have read for ages. I decline to struggle with any tran-
scription of the plot. On the wrapper you will observe
the woman stepping bodily out of the picture, like the
ancestors in the whisky advertisement; this, however, is a
symbolic rather than an actual presentment. But there is
plenty without it: a rightful heir, mountain castles amid

will undersell the world; is assiduously preparing for air
the eternal snows, a villain (with sorceries), half-a-dozen

attempted murders and the most hair-lifting duel imagin;
able. Soberly considered the whole business is a riot of
delirium, belonging flagrantly to that realm where all the
world's a screen, and all the men and women merely
movies. But the unexpected charm of the book is that
(with the possible exceptions noticed above) it is told with
a touch of distinction, even of subtlety, that invests its
wildest audacities with an atmosphere of fantastic truth.
In short, if Mr. G. F. TURNER has done nothing else he
has at least enabled the fastidious to enjoy the thrills of a
shocker while retaining their self-respect.
In the first of the three stories, each about a hundred
pages in length, which make up Gold and Iron (HEINEMANN),
it is hard to escape the conviction that Mr. Joseph
HERGESHEIMER is saying between the lines, “So you
thought that CoNRAD was the only Joseph who could
throw a man and woman together on a mysterious coast
in the most strangely romantic circumstances, and provide
a thoroughly groolly scrap into the bargain. Well, here's
another little Victory for you.” He seems definitely to
challenge that air of the extraordinary and the inevitable
reader to pit his wits against the author's is, in this instance,
to be completely “had " and to become under the necessity
(about page 265) of taking off his hat, not only to the secret
servant but to a mere minion of the “Yard” also. Two
minor points emerge from a close study of the book. The
first is that the author is undoubtedly a barrister himself;
if I am wrong on this point I finally withdraw my threat
to join the Service. The second point is that he knows his
Scotland even as well as he loves it. In the result you have
two merits, which together amply discount the element of
cheap sensationalism: one merit is the logical development
of the story, and the other is its beautiful setting. I don't
know whether it is due to the Scottish climate or to the
legal atmosphere that the author omits all reference to the
feminine sex or affairs of the heart; but anyhow it seemed
right and meet that women should be left at home when
men were engaged upon such violent and dastardly business.
From certain internal evidences, mainly orthographical,
I am led to suppose The Branding Iron (Constable) to
be of Transatlantic origin. This, no doubt, explains my
unfamiliarity with the name of Miss KATHARINE NEwlis
combined which Mr. Con-
RAD so subtly conveys. It
is a big effort, and I don't ||
feel that the author quite ||
brings it off, yet I cannot º
think of anyone but Mr.
CoNEAD who would have
come nearer to doing so,
and the fight in the dark
in this story is one that
even after the War will
make a reader catch his
breath for half-a -dozen
pages at least. In the

the writer returns to a happier métier, and deals with
an America remarkably interesting and wholly novel to
me, an America where foundries and railways are in their
infancy and crinolines are worn. Saloons, bowie knives
and bags of gold-dust are all too familiar to us, but who,
on this side of the Atlantic at any rate, ever remembers the
quiet towns with Victorian manners to which the diggers
belonged and returned 2 Both “Tubal Cain " and “The
Dark Fleece " are excellent yarns and wonderful pieces of
pictorial reconstruction as well.
After reading The Searchers (HopDER AND SToughton), I
seriously think of myself joining His Britannic Majesty's
Secret Service. All the fun and firearms, and ever, at the
conclusion, a startling surprise for your friends and admirers,
among whom you stand cool, calm and collected. Anthony
Keene-Leslie did not deceive me when, upon his first intro-
duction as a secret servant, he modestly disclaimed the thrills
and excitements commonly attributed to his trade. I knew
that many pages would not be turned before he would
land us in the middle of some crimson intrigue; mysterious
strangers, disguises, cryptic and invaluable manuscripts, ur-
gent telegrams, codes, Italian hidden hands, Scotland Yard,
pseudo-taxicabs, clues and things. Butlet others beware of
Mr. John Foster, a most ingenious manipulator of the old
melodramatics. Presently indeed the suggestion became
so insistent that I went further and began to wonder
whether I was not in fact reading a “story-form" of some
already triumphant film. Certainly the resemblance is
almost too pronounced to be fortuitous; from the sensa-
tional branding scene, through cowboy stunts, to the up-
town playhouse, where a repentant and wife-seeking hero
recognises his mark upon the shoulder of the leading lady
—and so to reconciliation, slow fade-out, and the announce-
ment of Next Week's Pictures. But though it is impossible
not to suspect Miss BURT of having an eye to what poetic
journalism calls the Shadow Stage, this is by no means to
belittle her mastery of the colder medium of print; and I
hasten to acknowledge that, upon me at least, The Branding
Iron has left a distinct though possibly fleeting impression
of good entertainment.

To-DAY I left my downy lair
An hour before my wont :
But do I consequently wear
An unctuous smile 2 I don't.
If with the early lark's ascent
I soared from out my bed, it
Is to an Act of Parliament
That I must give the credit.
When I escape, in butter's dearth,
The fault of waxing fat,
Calmly I view my modest girth
And take no praise for that :

Abjures its ruling passion ; -

Who fixed my sugar-ration.

The chastisement of crime—

For which the law can't hurt you,
In whose regard your heart is free
To follow vice or virtue.

Especially to think,
That leaves me loose to take my

By Pussyfeet dictated,

THE PERSONAL ELEMENT
AT A MOTOR SHOW.
Not to be outdone by Olympia we
have just held a motor show in our
provincial Town Hall. What though
the motoring magazines, obese with
the rich diet of advertisement, grew no
fatter in its honour, it was at least
the most successful social function we
have known since the War began. The
Town Hall externally was magnificent
with flags by day and coloured lamps
by night, and within was a blaze of
bunting and greenstuff. The band of
the Free Shepherds played popular
music, and the luncheon and tea rooms
were the scene of most delightful lit-
tle gatherings. Besides all this, quite
a number of cars were to be found
amongst the decorations.
Nearly every demobilised officer in
the county seems to have taken up an
agency for a car or two, and bought
himself spats on the strength of a pro-
spective fortune. Jimmy Wrigley and
I are amongst them. Wrigley in the
Great War was M.T., R.A.S.C., and
knows so much about cars that he can
tell the make of lamps from the track
and know so little that I judge Jimmy's
cleverness only by other people's in-
credulity. On our stand at the show
we exhibited two cars, which, as I care-
fully learned beforehand from the book
of the words, were a Byng-Beatty
and a Tanglefoot, these being the cars
for which we are what they call con-
cessionaires. (The bat is tricky, but
one picks it up loafing about garages.)
As a rule Jimmy and I do the corre-
spondence between us—Jimmy con-
tributing the technique and I the punc-
tuation; but for the three days of the
show his cousin Sheila volunteered to
preside at a dainty little table and make
jottings of our orders. Sheila is always
ornamental, and as we had the stand
draped to tone with her hair, and she
wore a dress which harmonized like
soft music with the pale heliotrope of
the Tanglefoot's body-work, our display
was a magnet from the word “Go.”
And then on the morning of the
opening day Jimmy went down with his
Lake Doiran malaria and left me to it!
I am as brave as most people, but
this calamity unmanned me. “Sheila,”
I said to a pair of pitying grey eyes, as
the crowd, having heard the show de-
clared open, massed about our stand
—“Sheila, the situation is desperate.
These people will ask me about the
cars. They will expect me to answer
them intelligently, and it's no use in
the world talking horse to them—I can
see that from their sordid looks. I shall
disappear. You can say I have gone
out on a trial run, which won't be a
lie, only an understatement. And you
can just hand them out the little books
and let them paw the varnish. Silence
will be better than anything I could
say. Probably it is better than what
any conscientious man could say about
the Tanglefoot.”
“I’ll carry on, Nobby,” said Sheila.
“You go and buy buns for Miss Hurdle-
wing, and be happy. Fly! here's a
purchaser.”
Sheila's whisper dispersed me into
the crowd and I strolled away, while
she bestowed a smile and a specification
pamphlet on the first of the crowd to
step on to our stand.
I found it impossible to keep away
for long. Sheila looked so well against
the heliotrope Tanglefoot limousine
that I had to go back to look at her.
The stand was surrounded by a
throng, hushed and breathless with
interest. Sheila was talking volubly.
Hardened motorists listened with their
mouths open; zealots, ſeverish to ex-
pend their excess profits on motoring
because it was a novelty and expen-
sive, stood spell-bound ; a rival agent
drank in her words with tears in his
his cheek flushed with a sudden and
splendid determination to amalgamate
with our firm.
“This chassis, gentlemen,” Sheila
was saying, with a glance towards the
Byng-Beatty, “has the most exclusive
features. The torque-tube being fitted
with an automatic lighter, it is possible
to change tyres without leaving your
seat; while by a simple adjustment of
the universal joint the car will take
any reasonable obstacle gracefully and
without any inconvenience to the occu-
pants. The clutch is of the Alabama
type. This new pattern created a great
sensation at Olympia, owing to the
ease with which it permits even the
amateur driver to convert the present
body into a char-ti-banc or a tipping-
waggon. The hood is reversible, so
that passengers may be sheltered from
the wind when the car runs backwards.
In the rear of the boot, concealed by
a door flush with the panels, is an
EINSTEIN parachute, by means of which
a passenger may leave the car before
an imminent accident or when tired of
the company.”
I could not move; I did not want to
either ; and I certainly dared not
interrupt.
“The Tanglefoot,” continued Sheila,
while a sigh of sheer rapture rose from
the crowd, “is pre-eminently the car
for a medical man or pushful under-
taker. No horn is supplied, though
this will be fitted if desired. The car
is not cheap, but properly used will
soon repay itself. Amongst the ac-
cessories supplied with the standard
chassis I should like to call your
attention to the collapsible game-bag
and landing-net.”
This went on for a long, long time,
and I stayed till a man in the crowd
recognised me and showed symptoms
of coming out of his trance. I fled, and
returned only at the luncheon interval.
“Sheila,” I said—“Sheila, this may
be fun for you, but James Wrigley and
I may sing in the streets to pay for it.”

To-DAY I left my downy lair
An hour before my wont :
But do I consequently wear
An unctuous smile” I don't.

That I must give the credit.
When I escape, in butter's dearth,
The fault of waxing fat,
Calmly I view my modest girth
And take no praise for that :

Abjures its ruling passion ;

Who fixed my sugar-ration.
Hampered by regulations for
The chastisement of crime—

For which the law can't hurt you,
In whose regard your heart is free
To follow vice or virtue.

THE PERSONAL ELEMENT
AT A MOTOR SHOW.
Not to be outdone by Olympia we
have just held a motor show in our
provincial Town Hall. What though
the motoring magazines, obese with
the rich diet of advertisement, grew no
fatter in its honour, it was at least
the most successful social function we
have known since the War began. The
Town Hall externally was magnificent
with flags by day and coloured lamps
by night, and within was a blaze of
bunting and greenstuff. The band of
the Free Shepherds played popular
music, and the luncheon and tea rooms
were the scene of most delightful lit-
tle gatherings. 13esides all this, quite
a number of cars were to be found
amongst the decorations.
Nearly every demobilised officer in
the county seems to have taken up an
agency for a car or two, and bought
himself spats on the strength of a pro-
spective fortune. Jimmy Wrigley and
I are amongst them. Wrigley in the
Great War was M.T., R.A.S.C., and
knows so much about cars that he can
tell the make of lamps from the track
and know so little that I judge Jimmy's
cleverness only by other people's in-
credulity. On our stand at the show
we exhibited two cars, which, as I care-
fully learned beforehand from the book
of the words, were a Byng-Beatty
and a Tanglefoot, these being the cars
for which we are what they call con-
cessionaires. (The bat is tricky, but

show his cousin Sheila volunteered to

ABOUT BATH ROOMS.
Of all the beautiful things which are
to be seen in shop windows perhaps
the most beautiful are those luxurious
baths in white enamel, hedged round
with attachments and conveniences in
burnished metal. Whenever I see one
of them I stand and covet it for a long
time. Yet even these super-baths fall
far short of what a bath should be; and
as for the perfect bathroom I question
if anyone has even imagined it.
The whole attitude of modern civili-
sation to the bathroom is wrong. Why,
for one thing, is it always the smallest
and barest room in the house? The
Romans understood these things; we
don't. I have never yet been in a bath-
room which was big enough to do my
exercises in without either breaking the
light or barking my knuckles against a
wall. It ought to be a big room and
opulently furnished. There ought to
be pictures in it, so that one could lie
back and contemplate them—a picture
of troops going up to the trenches, and
another picture of a bus-queue stand-
ing in the rain, and another picture of
Then one would really enjoy one's
baths.
And there ought to be rich rugs in it
and profound chairs; one would walk
about in bare feet on the rich rugs
while the bath was running; and one
would sit in the profound chairs while
drying the ears.
The fact is, a bathroom ought to be
equipped for comfort, like a drawing-
room, a good, full, velvety room; and
as things are it is solely equipped for
singing. In the drawing-room, where
we want to sing, we put so many cur-
tains and carpets and things that most
of us can't sing at all; and then we
wonder that there is no music in Eng-
land. Nothing is more maddening than
to hear several men refusing to join in
a simple chorus after dinner, when you
know perfectly well that every one of
them has been singing in a high tenor
in his bath before dinner. We all know
the reason, but we don't take the ob-
vious remedy. The only thing to do is
to take all the furniture out of the
drawing-room and put it in the bath-
room—all except the piano and a few
cane chairs. Then we shouldn't have
ing, and in the evening everybody would
be a singer. I suppose that is what
they do in Wales.
But if we cannot make the bathroom
what it ought to be, the supreme and
perfect shrine of the supreme moment
of the day, the one spot in the house
on which no expense or trouble is
spared, we can at least bring the bath
itself up to date. I don't now, as I did,
lay much stress on having a bath with
fifteen different taps. I once stayed in
a house with a bath like that. There
was a hot tap and a cold tap, and hot
sea-water and cold sea-water, and
PLUNGE and sPRAY and show ER and
wave and FLooD, and one or two more.
To turn on the top tap you had to stand
on a step-ladder, and they were all very
highly polished. I was naturally ex-
cited by this, and an hour before it
was time, to dress for dinner I slunk
upstairs and hurried into the bathroom
and locked myself in and turned on all
the taps at once. It was strangely disap-
pointing. The sea-water was mythical.
Many of the taps refused to function at
the same time as any other, and the
only two which were really effective

were wave and FlooD. WAVE shot out

PUNCH,
a thin jet of boiling water which caught
me in the chest, and FLOOD filled the
bath with cold water long before it
could be identified and turned off.
No, taps are not of the first import-
ance, though, properly polished, they
look well. But no bath is complete
without one of those attractive bridges
or trays where one puts the sponges
and the soap. Conveniences like that
are a direct stimulus to washing. The
first time I met one I washed myself
all over two or three times simply to
make the most of knowing where the
soap was. Now and then, in fact, in a
sort of bravado I deliberately lost it, so
as to be able to catch it again and put
it back in full view on the tray. You
can also rest your feet on the tray when
you are washing them, and so avoid
cramp.
Again, I like a bathroom where there
is an electric bell just above the bath,
which you can ring with the big toe.
This is for use when one has gone to
sleep in the bath and the water has
frozen, or when one has begun to com-
mit suicide and thought better of it.
Apart from these two occasions it can
be used for Morsing instructions about
breakfast to the cook—supposing you
have a cook. And if you haven't a cook
a little bell-ringing in the basement does
no harm.
But the most extraordinary thing
about the modern bath is that there is
no provision for shaving in it. Shaving
in the bath I regard as the last word
in systematic luxury. But in the ordin-
ary bath it is very difficult. There is
nowhere to put anything. There ought
to be a kind of shaving tray attached
to every bath, which you could swing
in on a flexible arm, complete with
mirror and soap and strop, new blades
and shaving-papers and all the other
confounded paraphernalia. Then, I
think, shaving would be almost toler-
able, and there wouldn't be so many of
these horrible beards about.
The same applies to smoking. It is
incredible that to-day in the twentieth
century there should be no recognised
way of disposing of a cigarette-end in
the bath. Personally I only smoke
pipes in the bath, but it is impossible
to find a place in which to deposit even
a pipe so that it will not roll off into
the water. But I have a brother-in-
law who smokes cigars in the bath, a
disgusting habit. I have often won-
dered where he hid the ends, and I find
now that he has made a cache of them
in the gas-ring of the geyser. One day
the ash will get into the burners and
then the geyser will explode.
Next door to the shaving and smok-
ing tray should be the book-rest. I

who keep on coming to stay, and they
all do it. Few things make the leaves
of a book stick together so easily as
being dropped in a hot bath, so they
had better have a book-rest; and if
they go to sleep I shall set in motion
my emergency waste mechanism, by
which the bath can be emptied in malice
from outside.
Another of my inventions is the Pro-
gress Indicator. It works like the indi-
cators outside lifts, which show where
the lift is and what it is doing. My
machine shows what stage the man
inside has reached—the washing stage
drying stage, or the exercises stage. It
shows you at a glance whether it is
worth while to go back to bed or
whether it is time to dig yourself in on
the mat. The machine is specially
suitable for hotels and large country
houses where you can't find out by
hammering on the door and asking,
because nobody takes any notice.
When you have properly fitted out
the bathroom on these lines all that
remains is to put the telephone in and
have your meals there; or rather to
have your meals there and not put the
telephone in. It must still remain the

NATIONAL COAL.
A GREAT deal of nonsense is being
talked about our coal-mines. I should
like therefore to throw a little helpful
light on the subject of nationalisation.
Speaking as an owner and not as a miner
(I have at the present moment at least
six coals and a pound or two of assorted
mineral rubbish), I want to consider
some of the pros and cons of this de-
batable proposition. I take it, first of
all, that we shall pay for our coal along
with our taxes and in proportion to our
income. This will come rather hard,
of course, on the kind of people who
insist on warming their rooms with
three large electric vegetable marrows,
or by means of a number of small
skeletons pickled in gas. But such
people will no doubt be able to claim
rebates, and rebating is one of the most
healthy and instructive of our British
parlour games. Let us pass on, them,
to the means of distribution.
I greatly doubt whether under State
organisation the practice of opening
up those romantic and circular caverns
in the middle of the pavement and sud-
denly filling our cellars with smoke,
rain and thunder will be allowed to
continue. Rather, I expect, at the
moment when John Postman pushes
the budget of bills through the slit in
the front-door, William Coalman, walk-
ing along the roof, will be dropping a
couple of Derby Brights, in the mode
of Santa Claus, down the chimney.
This will get over the basement trouble,
and deliveries of course will occur fre-
quently, if irregularly, throughout the
day at such times as the Government
consider them to be necessary for
making up the fire.
But whatever happens about deliv-
eries the Inspector of Grates will be
an infernal nuisance. Nothing makes
a man more unpopular than interfer.
ence in a quarrel between husband and
wife, and I imagine that there will be
many little suburban tragedies like the
following:—
SCENE.—A Kensington drawing-room.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith are discovered
shivering over the fire.
Mr. Smith. No, no. Not like that
at all. You must break up that big
lump first.
Mrs. Smith (coldly). This is the way
my mother taught me to make up fires.
Mr. Smith. Your mother! Ha!
[Snatches the poker from her hand.
Mary (entering). The Coal Inspector
has called.
Enter Coal Inspector.
Taking the poker from Mr. Smith's
nerveless grasp, with three vicious
moribund fire. They watch him with
faces of horror. As he turns to go
they glance at each other, and with a
simultaneous impulse seize the tongs
and shovel and strike him with all
their strength on the back of the head.
Mr. Smith rings the bell. Enter Mary.
Mr. Smith. Please sweep that up.
[She does so. He takes up the
poker and resumes the alterca-
tion.
But let us turn again to the brighter
side of things. Nothing fills a house-
holder with such deep pleasure as a
legitimate grievance against the Govern-
ment on minor counts, especially when
such grievances are properly ventilated
in the daily Press. Thus:—
MORE GOVERNMENT CARELESSNESS.
SPARK FALLS ON A HEARTHRUG
AT CROYDON.
Or
PRIME MINISTER, ENCOURAGES
PNEUMONIA.
FIRE GOES OUT AT PONDER'S FND.
These are specimens of the headlines
we may confidently expect, and little
forms like the following will be found
in the more popular dailies:—
PROTEST TO YOUR M.P.
I protest against the continued
refusal of my fire to burn up, for
which Government maladministra-
tion is responsible. I urge you to
do all in your power to see that
a warm ruddy glow is cast con-
tinually over my dining-room. The
men, women and children of your
constituency will judge you at the
next election by your action in this
matter.
And then there is the question of the
miscellaneous material which is now
being supplied in the name of coal,
especially those large flat pieces of ex-
cellent slate. As things are now I often
wonder that the miners don't make
use of them for propaganda purposes.
Chalked manifestoes such as—
We demand forty-four shillings
more a ton, a five-hour week and
control of the mines
would do much to convert the arm-
chair critic as he digs about in the
scuttle. When we get our coal from
the State, however, we shall, of course,
carefully set apart these sections of
slate, wrap them in brown-paper and
send them by parcel post to the nearest
elementary school, with a note to say
there must have been an inter-depart-
mental error.
• From State coal too it will only be a
step to State firewood, and we know
from the papers what lots the Govern-
bed-boards, trestles, aeroplanes, rail-
way trucks—there is no end to it all.
And underneath the firewood, of course,
carefully packed, comes the daily news-
paper itself. There can be little doubt
that, once they have obtained a grip of
coal and kindling-wood, the Govern-
ment will proceed to nationalise the
Press. - EvoB.

“And we'll live a life of freedom in a
corner by ourselves,” she continued
with a disconcerting change of metre
into which I could not hope to follow
her. But her words gave me an idea.
“I do believe,” I said, “I know the

On Saturday I down tools at twelve.

“The man's a marvel,” said Suzanne.
I could have believed that the machine
had recorded the truth.
When we had both regained our
composure Suzanne inquired if I had
got the tickets. The moment for en-
lightenment had arrived.
I led her to a hoarding and placed
her in front of a poster which depicted
a most alluring seaside resort. The
sea was of the royalest blue, the sands
were a rich 22-carat; there was a cave
in the left foreground, a gaily-striped
tent on the right, and a tiny harbour
with yacht attached in the middle
distance; and, with the exception of a

exactly is it you meditate doing this
summer—if any?"
“Taking the children to the seaside,
of course; and, as I said, we must
make our arrangements well in advance,
otherwise we shall get left, as we did
last year, and have to put up with
lodgings in Margate.”
“Have you any particular place in
view 2 " I asked.
“No. But it must have a nice sandy
beach for Barbara, and must not be too
bracing for Baby, and there must be
one or two caves dotted about, and a
snug little harbour with a dear old fish-

“We return before nightfall,” I re-
plied.
Next day I sought Suzanne at the
appointed hour and station. She had
taken my words literally and was
steadfastly occupying the automatic
weighing machine, with her back im-
passively turned upon an indignant
youth who was itching to gamble a
penny on the chance of guessing his
avoirdupois. Quietly I crept behind
her and placed a coin in the slot,
simultaneously pressing my foot upon
the platform. Suzanne gazed with
mingled horror and fascination at the
mounting indicator, and at sixteen

who was apparently fleeing from his
parent's frenzy, and a smaller girl,
mostly sun-bonnet, who was nursing
a jelly-fish. Beneath the picture was
the legend, “You Can Let Yourself Go
at Giddyville.”
I looked anxiously at Suzanne as she
surveyed this masterpiece.

“But what objectionable children "
said Suzanne. “I shouldn't at all care
for Barbara to mix with them; and
jellyfish sting. Besides, that boat
doesn't look at all safe, and the man's
a bounder in every sense of the word.
What's this other place?”
I was disappointed, and considered
Suzanne's criticism superficial in the
extreme. The next pictures showed an
emerald sea and pink shore, two piers,
a flock of aeroplanes, and a structure
that combined the characteristic fea-
tures of the Eiffel Tower and the Albert
Memorial. One suspected a herd of
minstrels in the distance, but here
again the beach was remarkably and
invitingly uncongested. A solitary
barefooted maiden communing with a
crustacean rather caught my fancy, but
it didn't need the angle of Suzanne's
nose to tell me that “Puddlesey for
Pleasure” was a wash-out; frankly, it
was too good to believe that all the
holiday-makers but one were content
to patronise either the piers or the
aeroplanes or the hidden attractions of
the architectural outrage, and to leave
the beach so desirably vacant.
We passed over in eloquent silence a
couple of lurid affiches which declared
that “Exhampton Is So Exhilarating”
(a middle-aged person in side-whiskers
and a purple bathing-suit attempting to
drown his unfortunate wife), and that
“Rooksea Will Restore the Roses” (a
fragile young woman in a deck-chair
being nourished out of a box of choco-
lates by a sentimental ass whose attire
proclaimed him a member of the local
concert party). The next scene to en-
gage our attention was much more
simple in its appeal and striking in its
effect. The sea was neither so bla-
tantly blue nor so vividly green as the
other seas had been ; the beach was but
normally sandy-hued, and there was a
delicious little fellow, clad in nothing
much except seaweed, who was splash-
ing himself with great seriousness in
the middle of a shining pool. Again
that amazing absence of the seaside
crowd; but somehow or other this
picture seemed to ring true. There
were no piers or other “attractions,”
and to souls that shunned such delights
the aura of the place was extremely
sympathetic, A single glance sufficed
to determine us both. -
“Quick!” said Suzanne with a catch
in her breath. “What's the place
called 2"
Alas! where the legend should have
appeared was an ugly gap. The picture
had been badly torn in its most vital
part, and nothing was there to reveal
the identity of that magic spot where

seen the poster exhibited anywhere

Suzanne, however, who has not given
up her sanguine interest in the sport of
bull-baiting, is still intent on taking
time by the horns and getting in before
the rush. She has just compiled a list
of “likely” places (selected for the most
part because she likes the sound of

tion. I have calculated that long before

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 22nd.—As if the con-
dition of Ireland were not bad enough,
Mr. CLEM Edwards sought to make
our flesh creep by asking whether
the Government had information that
risings had been planned" for Easter
Monday, not only in that country but
in Liverpool, Manchester
and Glasgow as well. The
PRIME MINISTER declined to
answer the question, and
was manifestly relieved
when Mr. JAck Jon Es, with
great tact, changed the sub-
ject by asking if a white
blackbird had been caught
that morning on Hackney
Marshes.
Lord WINTERTON and the
other “Young Turks” were
again inquisitive about the
suppressed report of the
alleged Greek outrages at
Smyrna, until Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE put an end to the
catechism with the remark
that “even Christians are
entitled to a fair trial.”
Chafing under the accus-
ation that the trade unions are largely
responsible for preventing ex-Service
men from obtaining employment the
Labour Party pressed the PRIME
MINISTER to produce his evidence.
To-day they got it, in stacks. All the
unions, in principle, are in favour of
training disabled men, but in practice
most of them require that a workman
shall have worked at his craft for from
three to six years before being
admitted to their ranks. “You
have fought for us, but you shall
not work with us” is their atti-
tude.
On the Army Estimates Sir
SAMUEL Scott pleaded for the 'l
formation of an Imperial General
Staff. Even in peace-time there
were plenty of problems to be
solved. We should never be really
at peace, moreover, so long as
there were tribes on our frontiers \
who looked upon war as an
amusement and a pastime, ** as
hon. Members look upon golf.”
Surely this is to underestimate
the devotion of our earnest golfers.
Judging by the condition of the
links on Sunday I should say
some of them look upon it as a
religion.
Mr. NEIL MACLEAN pretended
not to understand why we
wanted an army at all. Was not
the last war “a war to end war " ?
But his main point—in which he
quite respectable people agreeing with him that he confessed that he could
him—is that it should not be officered
from one class. Mr. MACLEAN is not
so revolutionary as he thinks himself.
The most insurgent thing about him
is his hair, and even that is not more
rebellious than Mr. DAN IRVING's.

of opposition encountered by the Silver
Coinage Bill. Having a specimen of
the new shilling in his pocket he him-
self was feeling particularly bobbish,
and could not understand the gloomy
vaticinations of Lord BUCKMASTER and
Lord SALISBURY as to what might
happen in West Africa and elsewhere if
we depreciated our currency. But his
usual self-confidence so far deserted

not “answer for the whole of the
British Empire at a moment's notice.”
The LORD CHANCELLOR refused to
accept Lord BALFour of BURLEIGH’s
proposal to abolish the D.O.R.A. regu-
lation forbidding the sale of confec-
tionery in theatres, on the ground that
it would be unfair to the ordinary shops
to allow this competition,
and that the business of the
theatre was to supply drama
not chocolate. Lord BAL-
FOUR was unconvinced. His
imagination boggled at the
thought of a Scotsman, at
any rate, paying for a seat
in a theatre in order to pur-
chase a shilling's-worth of
“sweeties.”
The House of Commons
has a childlike sense of
humour. There is nothing
that it enjoys more than to
have a Minister struggling
with the pronunciation of
some outlandish place-
name. When, therefore, Mr.
ILLINGworth, posed with
the deficiencies of the mail
service to Bryngwran and
Gwalchmai, made a gallant but ineffect-
ual effort to get over the first obstacle
and evaded the second by calling it “the
other place,” Members roared with
delighted laughter.
In the further debate on the Army
Estimates a good deal was said about
the unfortunate events in Ireland. Mr.
T. P. O'Connor had the grace to with-
draw some of the unfortunate insinua-
tions against the conduct of the
British soldiers into which he had
been betrayed the day before, but
Messrs. KENWORTHY and MALONE
repeated them with additions of
their own, and incurred thereby
2 a castigation from Mr. CHURCHILL
, which the House cordially ap-
% proved.
The Coal Mines (Emergency)
º Bill was read a third time. On
"behalf of the Labour Party, Mr.
ADAMSON declared that the profits
of the coal industry must be
“pooled "- a proposition which
% would command general approval
if there seemed any likelihood
that consumers would receive a
share of the pool.
Wednesday, March 24th.-Since
Nº DisrAELI startled a scientific
Nº meeting by declaring himself to
be “on the side of the angels”
there has been no more remark-
able piece of self-revelation than
Lord BIRKENHEAD's defence of

ecclesiastical lore or the impassioned
appeal that he made for the victims of
the present divorce law that impressed
the Peers as the high line that he took
in condemning the opponents of the
measure. He as good as told the oc-
cupants of the Episcopal Bench that
their view of marriage was lacking in
spirituality. The Archbishop of CAN-
TERBURY was so dumbfounded by the
accusation that he meekly con-
fessed himself unable to follow
the LorD CHANCELLOR's religious
arguments. Lord SALISBURY dis-
played more pugnacity in a reas-
sertion of views that had been de-
scribed as “mediaeval supersti-
tion.” But the Peers preferred
the Use of Birkenhead to the Use
of Sarum, and gave the Bill a
Second Reading by a two-to-one
majority.
In the course of the debate
Lord BUCKMASTER expressed his
regret that so effective an orator *
as the Archbishop of York should
have deserted the Law for the
Church. After this afternoon’s
display I could not help wonder-
ing what would have happened
if “F. E.'s" call had been to the
Church instead of the Bar, and
whether a shovel-hat would not have
suited him even better than a wig.
Members who display a friendly inter-
est in the revival of German trade were
gratified to learn that the clock-manu-
facturers, at any rate, are taking time
by the forelock and are already sending
their goods to this country. So far are
they, moreover, from cherishing ani-
mosity or desiring to magnify the Father-
land that they modestly label them
“Westminster Chimes.” It is pleasant
to record that the Board of Trade, ex-
hibiting the same spirit of self-abnega-
tion, has insisted on substituting the
time-honoured inscription, “Made in
Germany.”
It is a mistake to suppose that there
are no limits to the ambition of the
GEDDEs family. “I never wanted air-
transport,” said Sir ERIC this afternoon,
and later on he expressly disclaimed
the megalomania which had been attri-
|buted to him. by those best able to
diagnose the disease.” He is certainly
coming on as a Parliamentary speaker,
and gave an informing and, on the whole,
hopeful account of the work of the rail-
ways in promoting reconstruction.
Thursday, March 25th.-The PRIME
MINISTER was rather husky this after-
noon. He had been having a strenuous
time with the miners and possibly some
of the coal-dust had got into his throat.
But his spirit is unabated, and he flatly
refused to withdraw his charge that the

In connection with the proposal to
raise the Tube fares, Mr. WILL THoRNE
inquired whether this would not mean
an increase of two pounds a week in the
expenditure of some families, and, on
the figure being challenged, said that it
was quite correct, for one of the families
was his own. Members entered into

After Mr. Asquith's “prave 'orts”
at the National Liberal Club the mild-
ness of his criticism upon the Govern-
ment's foreign policy sadly disappointed
his more ardent supporters. His only
concrete suggestion was that we should
surrender our mandate for Mesopotamia
and retire to the coast, and this did not
meet with much approval.

THE train ran into Victoria Station
and pandemonium.
A struggling mass of people trying
to get out, another mass trying to get
in ; everybody pushing and muttering,
grunting and groaning; and above all
the howling of the Specially Selected
Band of Hustlers in their now famous
and unpopular performance:—
“'Urry up off the car, please.
WAIT till they're all off. Move
right down the centre, please.

I managed to struggle out of
my seat. -
“Thank you, Sir,” said the
man. “Sit down, Em’ly. That's
better. Now you can 'old the
kid. Shut up, 'Enry, will you ?”
I looked for Henry and found
him wedged in a forest of legs.
“I think he's afraid of being trodden
on,” I said.
We managed, with some effort, to
extract the child and make him a little
more comfortable. His father turned
with a sigh of relief to me.
“Awful business travellin' with kids
nowadays, ain't it?” he said.
“I can quite believe it,” I said.
“Bad enough anywhere,” he went
on, “but on this line—well—and they

THE ACTRESS,
YoU are doubtless aware that in the successful musical
comedy, The Girl of Forty-Seven, there is a scene in which
Miss Verbena Vaine, as Clementina, the horse-dealer's
beautiful daughter, denounces the disreputable old veterin-
ary surgeon, Binnett, so whimsically played by that ripe
comedian, Mr. Sid Apps. -
On my first visit to the play many weeks ago an incident
occurred which both enhanced Mr. Apps's reputation for
spontaneous humour and highly diverted the audience.
It will be remembered that at the climax of her outburst,
Clementina, with eyes ablaze and voice vibrating with pas-
sion, hisses, “Loathsome scoundrel, how I detest and de-
spise you!" On the evening to which I refer a mock-sub-
missive look came into Apps's face when these words were
spoken, and he interrupted gently, “Not too much soda,
Verbena,” glancing with mischievous curiosity to see how
she would take his humorous comment upon her emphatic
utterance of this line of many sibilants. -
The audience was greatly delighted by this effect. Miss
Vaine failed completely to maintain the rôle of the indignant
beauty and turned her back to the footlights to hide her
face, though her laughter was betrayed by the shaking of
her handsome shoulders. There was a pause of some
moments before she resumed, “My father shall know of
this,” and so forth. -
Last week, when Doris, my niece, chose that I should
take her to see The Girl of Forty-Seven, I was not un-
willing again to enjoy Apps's humour. I listened with
especial care as we approached the scene in the play to
which I have referred. Perhaps he would employ some
still more successful gag. At last came Clementina's out-
burst. “Loathsome scoundrel, how I detest and despise
you!” she exclaimed with vehemence. “Not too much
soda, Verbena,” replied the comedian gently, with a mis-
chievous glance of curiosity. The actress gave a look of
amazement, then quickly turned her back to the audience,
where she stood for some moments with her face in her
hands and her shoulders shaking, the audience laughing
aloud with delight. The action of the play was delayed for
some moments before Miss Werbena Vaine resumed her part.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
CouxTLEss readers, fusionists and others, will be glad to
have Mr. HAROLD SPENDER's sparkling abstract of the
more romantic passages in the life of The Prime Minister
(Hodder AND SToUGHTON). The first half of the book
describes the upbringing and early battles of this man of
peace, Rose Cottage at Llanystumdwy with “Uncle Lloyd"
—there is a touching picture of the courage, wisdom and
unselfishness of this grand old man—the little attorney's
office at Portmadoc, squire- and parson-baiting passim,
capture of Carnarvon Boroughs, guerilla tactics in the
House, suspension, recognition, pacifism, office, original
budgeting, Limehousing (very reticently indicated), social
reform. Then War and the supreme opportunity for the
energy, persuasiveness, adroitness and determination which
must extort even from opponents the tribute of admiration.
Not a dull page; occasionally an obscure one. None of
your cold and calculated criticism for Mr. SPENDER. Have
idols clay feet? Well, not this one, thank you. And it is
an attitude which enables him to convey to the reader
something of the irresistible personal magnetism of his
distinguished friend, and the courage which delights in
riding the storm and is at its best in the tight corner (one
might suspect the PREMIER of holding the view that if there
were no tight corners it would be necessary to invent them).
The summary of the War period is admirably done. The
history of events leading to the formation of the second
Coalition Government—and the third—is again .#
presented. It would be unreasonable to suppose that allo
Mr. SPENDER's verdicts and estimates will be unchallenged
by historians. But it is unlikely that the PREMIER will
find a more competent hagiographer.
A story that so far violates the conventions as to start
with a mother whose moral instability is a worry to her
children, and a hero who longs to be a practical builder
despite a parental command to follow art—such a tale can
at least claim the merit of originality. Mr. J. D. BERESFORD
would be fully justified in claiming this and much more for
An Imperfect Mother (CoLLINs). Here is an interesting,
fascinating and certainly unusual story, in which only two
characters are of any real moment, Cecilia, the imperfect
mother, embodiment of the artist temperament, egotistical
almost to inhumanity, who abandons her dull husband
and boring daughters to “live her own life”; and Stephen,
the son, who alone can give her a half-sympathetic, half-
resentful understanding. You see already the cleverness
of Mr. BERESFORD's conception. Really, it is just this
that works (at least for me) its undoing. His characters
are fashioned with the nicest ingenuity; the positions
into which he so dextrously manipulates them compel your
interest and delighted wonder; but never once do they
touch your emotions, and never once can you see them as
anything but the creations of a highly talented brain. This
is the more strange because Mr. BERESFORD's people are as
a rule so convincingly real. Perhaps to some degree the
effect of artifice is due to the author's exclusive preoccupa-
tion with his central character. Cecilia's husband her
daughters, the home of her early married life, are shown to
us only by the light of her flashing personality; this with-

I should call An Imperfect Mother a highly entertaining
example of pure intellect, admirable but uninspired, which
for my own part I enjoyed amazingly.
Though “E. H. ANSTRUTHER" (Mrs. J. C. SQUIRE) has
called her latest story The Husband (LANE) one can hardly
resist the feeling that this is rather a generous description
of the central character, who indulged in so much philander-
ing with one person or another that it is difficult to regard
him as more than a husband in, so to speak, his spare time.
Richard Dennithorne, I must believe, was a “ladies' man"
in two senses, since he is undeniably a very womanly con-
ception of the all-conquering male, with indeed more than
a little of Mr. Itochester in his composition. The story
tells how Penelope, the heroine, comes to live with her
adopted aunt Margery, of whom Richard was the spouse
(intermittent); how Itichard, at the moment absent upon
amorous affairs, returned, and so fascinated Penelope with
his masterful ways that she fled to London; how, almost
unravelled until the Mortimers had resolved to try new
pastures. True, they did not go very far, but the dis-
turbing influence of money is sufficiently illustrated by
the fact that it induced such deeply-rooted folk to move at
all. If the theme of this story is a little sordid it is relieved
by its treatment from any reproach, and faithful followers
of the PHILLPoTTs' trail will enjoy every word of it.
All that we ever hoped—some day, when the War was
over—to hear about those most fascinating mysteries, the
Tanks, has been put together by Major C. and Mr. A.
WILLIAMs-ELLIS, under the title The Tank Corps (Country
Life Offices). Here are genuine uncamouflaged pictures of
all kinds of tanks, with detailed maps and descriptions
showing their operations, as well as stories not only of
those that walked in orthodox fashion through enemy
villages “with the British army cheering behind,” but of
others that disappeared entire in mud, or drove themselves

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 7, 1920.
POSSESSION.
THE dear old home has been let to
strangers. An interloper occupies the
messuage. A foreign master controls
the demesne.
To-day especially, when as I write
the air is balmy and the skies are blue,
it is agonising to feel that our own
spring rhubarb is growing crimson only
to be toyed with by alien lips, and that
the thrush on our pear-tree bough
But no, I am wrong; the pear-tree
bough is in the garden of No. 9; it is
only the trunk that stands in the garden
of No. 10. That, by the way, is an acci-
dent that frequently occurs to estate-
owners. Consider critically for a mo-
ment those well-known lines in which
BRowNING says—
“Hark where my blossom'd pear-tree in the
hedge -
Leans to the field,”
and then goes on to speak of “the
wise thrush” on “the bent spray's edge”
as “singing his song twice over.” It
is pretty obvious that the reason, the
poet assigns to this action on the bird's
part is not the correct one. I'vidently
the part of the tree on which it was sit-
ting was on the other side of the hedge
in the next-door fellow's garden, and
it was conscientiously trying to allot
one performance to each of the two
rival householders. But I seem to
have wandered a little from the ancient
home.
Come with me in imagination, reader,
and let us have a look at it together.
The fourth house to the left in this
winding road that fringes the common,
you see it standing there gazing a little
wistfully, yet with a quiet air of semi-
detachment, out over the wide expanse
of green. Half right and half left are
two monstrous blocks of red brick flats
overlooking it with a thousand envious
eyes. The middle distance is dotted
pleasantly with hawthorn bushes and
the pretty pieces of sandwich-paper
that are always the harbingers of Lon-
don's Spring. Beyond these things,
and far away to the front, you may
detect on clear days a white church-
tower nestling like Swiss milk amongst
immemorial trees. And this view is
mine—mine, like the old home. If we
linger for a moment in the road we
shall probably see the scornful face of
the proud usurper at one of the win-
dows calmly enjoying this view of mine,
all unconscious that I, the rightful
owner, am standing beneath. Does it
not remind you of the films 2–
“Charles Carruthers, an outcast from
his ancestral halls, eyes mournfully
the scene of merry junketing within.
Charles Carruthers—blick / ‘blick / "→
outside – “blick 1 blick " " — and you
see the junketers eating his junket
within. .
On looking back in a calmer mood
on the lines which I have just written,
I feel it possible that I may have let
my emotions run away with me and
conveyed a slightly false impression. I
may have suggested that the old home
has belonged to my family since Domes-
day Book or dear-knows when or some
other historic date in our island story.
That would not be strictly true. As a
matter of fact I have never lived in the
house, nor have any of my relations
either. It has belonged to me, to be
quite accurate, since March 25th, 1920,
and the interloper was interloping on
a short lease when I bought the long
lease over his head. It is also true
that by an awkward and absurd con-
vention I have to restore the old home
to the ground landlord in 1941. But
who cares about what is going to
happen in 19412 The Coalition may
have come to an end by that time, and
the first Labour Government, under
Lord NorthcLIFFE or Mr. JACK JoNES,
may be in power. Some bricklayer, in
a mood of artistic frenzy, may have de-
signed the plan of a new brick and had
it passed by the Ministry of Housing.
DEMPsFY may have met CARPENTIER.
No, the trouble is about the inter-
loper. It appears that, having the
remainder of a lease to run, he can go
on anteloping (you know what I mean)
for two years more if he likes. To do
him justice he admits that the place is
mine and wants to leave it. He has
no real love for the priceless old spot.
All that he asks is somewhere better to
go to. So I am gladly doing my best
to help him. I send him notices of
forty-roomed Tudor mansions, which
seem to abound in the market, man-
sions with timbered parks, ornamental
waters, Grecian temples, ha-has, gaze-
bos, herds of graceful bounding gazebos,
and immediate possession. I do more
than this. I send him extravagant
eulogies of lands across the seas, where
the grapes grow larger, the pear-trees
blossom all the year round and separate
thrushes laid on to each estate never
cease to sing. I suggest the advan-
tages of the mercantile marine and a
life on the rolling main, of big game
shooting, polar exploration, and the
residential attractions of Constanti-
nople, Berlin, Dublin and Vladivostok.
Concurrently with this I try hard to
cultivate in him a certain distaste for
the dear old home. I walk up and
down the road in front of it with a pair
of field-glasses, and, if I see that a little
chip has fallen off anywhere or the
paint on the gate has been scratched,
“I happened to be passing the
demesne,” I say, “when I noticed a
rather serious item of dilapidation,” or
“A word with you about the mes-
suage; it looks a trifle off colour to-day.
Have you had it blistered lately 2” And
this worries him a good deal, because
he is responsible for all repairs.
I do not fail to point out to my
friends, either, that this is my well-
known family seat, and I persuade
them from time to time to go and ask
for me at the door. “What, isn't he
living here yet?" I get them to say,
with a well-feigned surprise. “It is
his house, isn't it?” I frequently have
letters addressed to myself sent there,
and every morning and afterncon the
nurse takes the children past it for a
walk. The children are well drilled.
“Look, Priscilla, that's our garden,”
says Richard in a high penetrating
treble; and
“There's a darlin' little buttercup.
I want to go in,” Priscilla replies.
All this quiet steady pressure is
bound to have its due effect in time.
Gradually I think he will begin to feel
that a shadow haunts the ancestral
halls (the front one, you know, and the
back passage), that a footstep not his
own treads behind him on the stair,
that the dear old home will never be
ºpy until it is occupied by its rightful
Ol'Ol.
I shall send him a marked copy of
this article. EvoB.
VERS TRES LIBRE.
(Arabesque on a field of blue).
THESE are the things, or gorgeous or
delicate,
Imposing, intime, dazzling or repellent,
That sing—better than music's self,
Better than rhyme—
The praise and liberty of blue:
The turquoise and the peacock's neck,
The blood of kings, the deeps
Of Southern lakes, the sky
That bends over the Azores,
The language of the links, the eyes
Of fair-haired angels, the
Policeman's helmet and the backs
Of books issued by the Government,
Also the Bird of Happiness (MAETER.

And many other things such as
The Varsity colours, various kinds
Of pottery and limelight,
Some things by Sw1NBURNE, BURNS
and EzRA Pound,
The speedwell in the glade, and, oh!
The little cubes they put in wash-tubs.
REFRAIN.
These are the things, or gorgeous or
delicate, -
and you see him eyeing mournfully
And so on down to “liberty of blue.”
I call on him at once.

I AM sorry for the man who took his
typewriter on the Underground and was
made to buy a bicycle-ticket for it. But
I have no doubt he deserved it. I am
sure that he did it in spiritual pride.
He was trying to make himself equal
to the manual labourer who carries
large bags of tools on the Tube and
sighs heavily as he lays them on your
foot. I am sure that he was tired of
being scornfully regarded by manual
labourers, and was determined to make
it quite clear that he too had done, or
was about to do, a day's labour, and
manual labour at that. It was a sinful
motive and it deserved to be punished;
but it was natural. Nowadays we all
feel like that. We caught it from the
War, when the great thing was to show
that you were doing more work than
anybody else.
I take from a recent copy of Hansardº
the following brisk and delicate piece
of dialogue:–
“Mr. MACQUISTEN: You Labour men
have forgotten what sweat is.
Mr. W. THoRNE : I have never seen
many lawyers sweat, anyhow.
Mr. SPEAKER: This discussion is be-
coming intemperate.
AN HoN. MEMBER: The Hon. Member
for Springburn never sweated in his life.
Mr. MAcquistEN: Yes, I have laboured
in the docks.”
That is it, you see. Sweating is the
great criterion of usefulness to-day. If
you cannot show that you have sweated
in the past, you must at least show
that you are sweating now, or have
every intention of sweating in a mo-
ment or two. Personally, as a private
secretary, I find it very difficult, though
I do my best. As a private secretary I
labour in a rich house in the notori-
ously idle neighbourhood of South Ken-
sington, where nobody would believe
that anybody laboured, much less per-
spired over it. So when I pass, on
the way to my rich house, a builder's
labourer or a milkman or a dustman, I
have to exhibit as clearly as I can all
the signs of a harsh employment and
industrial fatigue. I take great pains
about this; I walk much faster; I frown
heavily and I look as pale as possible.
In the Tube I close my eyes. I hope
all this is effective, but as far as I can
see the milkman never looks at me,
and the builder is always saying to
another builder, “’E says to me, ‘Wot
abaht it?' 'e says, and I says to 'im,
‘Yus, wot abaht it?' I says.” But it is
worth the effort.
carrying a typewriter. I wonder why
everybody else in the Tube carries an
“attaché-case.” It has been calculated
that if all the attaché-cases which get
on to the train at Hammersmith at
9 A.M. were left on the platform, six
men or twelve women or three horses
could take their place in every car.
That means about ninety more men or
one-hundred-and-eighty more women
or forty-five more horses could leave
Hammersmith between 9 A.M. and 9.30.
So that if attaché-cases were forbidden
the traffic problem would be practically
solved.
Why shouldn't they be forbidden 2
It depends, of course, on what is inside
the cases; and nobody knows that for
certain. But one can guess. I have
been guessing for a long time. At first
I thought they were full of very con-
fidential papers. In the old days the
attaché-case was the peculiar trade-
mark of private secretaries and diplo-
mats and high-up people like that.
Even attachés carried them sometimes.
The very lowest a man with an attaché-
case could be was a First-Class Civil
Servant; and one was justified in
imagining confidential papers inside, or,
at any rate, home-work of the first
importance. But nowadays there are
too many of them for that. The

universal. This might be because there
is practically no male person alive just
now who has not been an adjutant at
one time or another, and pinched at
least one attaché-case from the orderly-
room. But most of the cases in the
Tube are carried by females, so that
theory is no good.
Well, then, I imagined sandwiches
or knitting or powder-puffs or tea;
but those also are rotten hypotheses.
I have too much faith in the good sense
of my fellow-countrywomen to believe
that they would cart a horrible thing
like a cheap attaché-case about simply
in order to convey a sandwich or a
powder-puff from one end of London
to the other. So I had to fall back on
my own experience.
I know, at any rate, what is inside
mine. There are some rather grubby
envelopes which I borrowed from the
House of Commons, and some very
grubby blotting-paper from the same
source, and either a ream of foolscap
or a quire of foolscap, whichever is
which ; some pipe-cleaners and a few
pieces of milk-chocolate; and a letter
from the Amalgamated Association of
Fish-Friers which ought to have been
answered a long time ago; and a memor-
andum on Hog-Importing which I am
always going to read while waiting at the
station; and a nice piece of thick string
with which I have tied a bowline on
a bight; and two broken pencils and
some more envelopes; and a Parlia-
mentary Whip of last year and a
stationery bill of the year before; and
several bills of my employer, not to
mention a cheque for ninety-seven
pounds which I suppose he would like
me to send to the bank; and a great
deal of fluff and a pipe or two and four
or five stamped letters which it is now
too late to post. That is all there is in
my case.
But I carry it backwards and for-
wards, in and out, to and fro, day after
day; and the only time it is ever
opened at either end of the journey is
when, in addition to the articles pre-
viously mentioned, it contains bottles.
But I do not carry it for the sake of
bottles; far from it. I am one of those
men who do not mind going about with
a comparatively naked bottle. I carry
it simply because it is the tool of my
trade, and because, if you don't carry a
tool of some kind on the Underground,
at any moment you may be taken for
an idle rich, if not actually a parasite,
who never sweated in his life.
And that, I am persuaded, is why
everybody else carries theirs.
. But this is a very serious conclusion.
It will be a terrible thing if everyone
is going to carry the tools of his trade

ETIQUETTE FOR FIRES.
IT seems that Mr. A. R. DYER, the Chief Officer of the
London Fire Brigade, has issued a booklet giving hints
on fire protection and also how to call the Fire Brigade.
We have pleasure in giving a few points which we are
sure are not included in this interesting and useful pub-
lication. -
::: :: ::: :k ×
Before sending for the Fire Brigade it is advisable to
make quite sure that you have a fire in the house to offer
them. But do not adopt the old plan of waiting until it
reaches the second-floor. This is rather apt to discolour
the wall-paper.
::: ::: :: :: :::
Above all the householder who intends to have a fire in
his house must keep calm. Immediately the maid rushes
into the room to say that the kitchen is on fire, place the
book you are reading on the table, remove your slippers
and put on a thick pair of heavy boots and a Harris tweed
shooting coat. Your next duty is to call the Fire Brigade,
and not to meddle with the fire yourself, for very often an
amateur completely spoils a fire before the Brigade arrives.
--- - --- × ---
When you see the Brigade engine dashing along the
road don't stop it and offer to show the driver a short cut.
And when they start work do not worry the firemen by
telling them how to do it better. After all, while it may be
your house, it is their fire.

IT began with, my reading an article

before that spiritualists were such a

born spiritualist, however, there are, it
seems, other ways of winning a mild
popularity. “If you confess to only a
slight knowledge of palmistry,” the
article continued, “it is often enough
to make you the centre of interest at

This appealed to me strongly. I like
to be the centre of interest. So I
bought a handbook on palmistry and,
having absorbed it, set out for my
next party full of confidence.
Surely enough, the first thing I saw

It was like leaving a Swiss hotel in the
height of the season.
“One at a time, please,” I said limply.
I seized a palm, followed it up, and
found that it belonged to a pinched
sour-looking female. Her character
was stamped on her face as well as on
her hand. If, however, I had said to
her, “Yours is a flaccid repressed dis-
position; you have a lack of imagina-

your life is too narrow and self-centred
to be of the least interest to anyone,”
she might not have liked it. You see,

Philosºpher (who has been mistaken for the football). “THANK Eviso THE CRICKET season 'LL soon BE ERE!”
I worked my way steadily through the
crowd, doling out husbands with an un-
sparing hand. And it was just when I
was beginning to feel a little tired of
the game that my enemy was delivered
into my hands.
We were not on visiting or even
speaking terms; we were indeed the
most implacable foes. But that did
not prevent the woman from shame-
lessly thrusting herself before me and
saying gushingly, “Do tell me what
you see in my hand.”
I looked at her, and before my search-
ing glance even her brazen face fell.
Six months previously that creature
had stolen Wilkins, the best cook I ever
had. Mere man may not understand
the enormity of this offence; but every
woman knows there is no crime more
heinous, more despicable, more unfor-
givable. She might find it in her heart
to condone larceny, think lightly of
arson, or even excuse murder; but there
is not one who would extend even a
deathbed pardon to the person who had
robbed her of a treasured servant.
And Wilkins had been a treasure in-
deed. It brought the tears to my
eyes when I thought of her exquisite
omelettes aur rognons, her salads, her
of knowledge regarding entrées and sav-
ouries. With a hard and bitter smile
I settled down to interpret the hand of
the woman before me.
The company gathered closer round
us and I noticed that Mrs. B., the par-
ticular friend of my enemy, bent affec-
tionately over her with truly feminine
expectation of “revelations.” And from
under the scarf which my enemy wore
about her arms and shoulders she
seemed, I thought, to project her hand
rather timidly. Perhaps she realised
too late what was in store for her.
I was quite dignified about it; I want
you to understand that. Many another,
seeing that creature so plump and well-
fed and knowing the reason, would have
broken out into vituperation. But my
tactics were more subtle. My manner,
as I studied her palm, was at first
nonchalant, even urbane. Then I gave
a start and faltered, “I—I suppose you
wish me to tell you the truth?’”
A frightened look came into her eyes
which, I noted with satisfaction, were
beginning to show tinges of yellow
(Wilkins' only fault is that in some of
her dishes she is over-liberal with the
salad oil and high seasonings). “Of
course I want to know the truth,” said
With an apparent air of diffidence I
began my recital. I did not spare her
in the smallest degree. I ascribed to
her all those sinister characteristics I
had read about in the handbook; and,
when I suddenly remembered a delici-
ous vol-au-vent upon which I had doted,
I added a few of my own.
It was a terrible indictment. When
I had finished an awed silence fell
upon the gathering. Everybody waited
breathlessly for the victim to speak.
“That was most interesting,” she
said with a sinister laugh. “But per-
haps you will read my palm now. You
see, it was Mrs. B.'s that you have just
read. She slipped her hand through
under my scarf.”
There was a burst of laughter from
everybody. Idiotic kind of joke, I call it.
I can assure the writer of the Sunday
articles that a knowledge of palmistry
does not necessarily make one popular.
I am now wondering where you can
buy hand-books on spiritualism.

THE LEAGUE OF
AN APPEAL TO ALL
THE League of Nations Union is engaged in a campaign
for the purpose of making the objects of the League of
Nations better understood in the country at large. The
chief danger that threatens the League is to be found in
the apathy or unconsidered scepticism of the public; almost
the sole active opposition comes from those who would
substitute for it a proletarian Internationale devoted to the
interests of one class only in the world, and from certain re-
actionaries who favour a return to the system of imperialism
which was the cause of the War. In the words of His
MAJESTY THE KING, “We fought to gain a lasting Peace
and it is our supreme duty to take every measure to secure
it. For that nothing is more essential than a strong and
enduring League of Nations. The Covenant of Paris is a
good foundation, well and truly laid. But it is and can be
no more than a foundation. The nature and strength of
the structure to be built upon it must depend on the
earnestness and sincerity of popular support.”
To those, if any, who contend that the Government should
be left to carry out its own propaganda for the League of
Nations the obvious answer is that it is necessary for this
work to be done by an independent body which can bring
public pressure to bear upon the Government of the day
and urge such amendments in the machinery and consti-
tution of the League as time and experience may show to
be desirable. The Union, in fact, bears to the League of
Nations the same relation that the Navy League bears to
the Senior Service; it is an independent body organised to
educate opinion in the needs of a national cause.
NATIONS UNION.
MEN OF GOOD WILL.
of the League have covered a wide range, which embraces
organisation for the administering of territory under its
trusteeship, and for the consideration of international
questions relating to transit, finance, labour and health.
America's repudiation (only temporary, it may be hoped)
of the pledges of her own President, the original and chief
advocate of the League of Nations, has meanwhile thrown
upon Great Britain the main burden of responsibility in
the Councils of the League, a fact that constitutes an over-
whelming claim upon the patriotism of British citizens.
The duty of bringing this claim home to the public has been
taken up by the League of Nations Union, under the Presi-
dency of Lord GREY OF FALLoDON. It has already estab-
lished a headquarters and a staff of experts; organised hun-
dreds of meetings throughout the country, and inaugurated
nearly two hundred branches. It publishes two periodicals
and many pamphlets and is preparing educational text-books;
it is taking part in an international conference with similar
voluntary societies in other countries. --
Clearly such work cannot be carried on without generous
support. The sum for which the League of Nations Union
appeals—a million pounds—may sound large, but it repre-
sents only the cost of four hours of the War, and is not
much to ask as an insurance against another and yet more
terrible war.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, March 29th.-During a brief
sitting the Lords got through a good
deal of business. The Silver Coinage
Bill awakened Lord CHAPLIN's reminis-
cences of his bimetallic days, when he
was accused by Sir WILLIAM HARcourt
of trying to stir up mutiny in lndia.
Undeterred by this warning, however,
the Peers gave a Second Reading to
the measure and also to the Coal Mines
Emergency Bill, which is less
up-to-date than it sounds,
and deals not with the present
emergency but with the last
emergency but one. They
also passed the Importation
of Plumage Bill, at the in-
stance of Lord ABERDEEN, who º
pleaded that beautiful birds, ".
“the result of myriads of .
years of evolution,” should
not be exterminated to make
a British matron's picture-
hat. -
A few noble lords tore ºft
themselves away from these 4
entrancing topics to attend 3%
the opening of the debate in
the Commons on the Govern-
ment of Ireland Bill. They ſº
were ill-rewarded for their
pains, for never has a Home
Rule debate produced fewer
interesting moments. The
CHIEF SECRETARY was so
studiously restrained in ex-
plaining the merits of the Bill
that the “ yawning chasm”
which, according to its op-
ponents, the measure is going
"to create between Southern
and Northern Ireland was to
be observed in advance on the
countenances of many of his
listeners. Years ago Mr. BAL-
Four told the Irish National-
ists that Great Britain was
not to be bored into accept-
ance of Home Rule; but I
am beginning to doubt now
whether he was right. If the
Government get the Bill through it will
be due more to John Bull's weariness
of the eternal Irish Question than to
any enthusiastic belief in the merits of
this particular scheme. Hardly anyone
off the Treasury Bench had a good
word to say for it, but fortunately for
its chances their criticisms were often
mutually destructive.
Mr. CLYNEs moved its rejection. From
his remark that Irish respect for the
law was destroyed in 1913, and that
the present Administration was re-
garded as “the most abominable form

only recently begun his researches into
Irish history and Irish character, and is
working backwards. His prescription
was to cease governing Ireland by
force and leave her to frame her own
constitution.
Lord Robert CECIL agreed with Mr.
CLYNEs in regarding it as a very bad
Bill, but there parted company with
him. In his view the deterioration of
Ireland began in 1906, when the era of
“firm government” came to an end.

Drop coercion by all means, but “let

self-government on a country that re-
jected it, that was nonsense.
As “a citizen of the world,” and
not merely an Irishman, Mr. T. P.
O'Connor denounced the Bill urbi et
orbi. Nobody in Ireland wanted it
unless it was the place-hunters of the
Bar and the Press, for whom it would
provide rich pickings.

rhetoric to plain fact by the CHANCELLOR

would recover its sanity, accept the Bill
and set itself to persuade Ulster into an
All-Ireland Parliament vid the golden
bridge of the Irish Council.
Captain CRAIG could not imagine
that happening in his lifetime. To his
mind the only merit of the Bill was |
that it safeguarded Ulster against
Dublin domination.
Tuesday, March 30th.-Someone—I
suspect a midshipman—has been tell-
- ing Mr. BROMFIELD that five
British Admirals have been
sent to Vienna to supervise
the breaking up of the Aus-
trian Fleet, and that the said
Fleet now consists of three
motor-boats. He was much
relieved to hear from Mr.
HARMsworth that only one
Admiral had been sent, and
that the disposal of a Dread-
nought, several pre-Dread-
noughts and sundry smaller
craft will give him plenty to do.
There appears to be a short-
age of ice in Hull. It is sup-
posed that the Member for the
Central Division (Lieut.-Com-
mander KENworTHY) has not
cut so much as he expected.
The debate on the Home
Rule Bill was resumed in a
much higher temperature
than that of yesterday. Mr.
Asquith, as he thundered in
carefully - polished phrases
against the “cumbrous,costly,
unworkable scheme,” earned
many cheers from his fol-
lowers, and the even greater
tribute of interruptions from
his opponents. For a moment
he was pulled up, when to his
rhetorical question, “What
has Home Rule meant to us?”
some graceless Coalitionist
promptly answered, “Votes!”
but he soon got going again.
Ireland, he declared, was a
unit. The Bill gave her dual-
ism “with a shadowy back-
ground of remote and potential unity.”
The vaunted Council was “a fleshless
and bloodless skeleton.” He remarked
upon “the sombre acquiescence of the
Ulstermen,” and wondered why they
had accepted the Bill at all. “Because
we don't trust you,” came the swift
reply from Sir Edward CARSON.
Mr. Asquith's own remedy for Irish
unrest was to take the Act of 1914
and transform it into something like
Dominion Home Rule. Any county—
Ulster or Sinn Fein—that voted against
coming under the Dublin Parliament
should be left under the present ad-

“PLEASE, MISTER, cAN I HAVE A PENNoktil of cAMLL 2"
Mr. BoNAR LAw did not fail to point
out the inconsistency of condemning
the Government scheme for its com-
plexity and then immediately proposing
another which would involve not one
but a dozen partitions and make the
political map of Ireland look like a
crazy quilt. He advised the House to
reject Mr. Asquith's advice and pass
the Bill, even though it should have
the paradoxical result, for the moment,
of leaving Nationalist Ireland under
British administration while providing
Unionist Ulster with a Home Rule Par-
liament for which it has never asked.
I suppose Mr. DEVLIN is not like the
Sinn Feiners, who, according to “T. P.,”
are so contemptuous of the Bill that
they have never read a line of it. Parts
of his speech, and particularly his
peroration, seemed far more suitable
to a Coercion Bill than to a measure
which is designed, however imperfectly,
to grant Home Rule to Ireland. The
Nationalist leader may be forgiven a
great deal, however, for his inimitable
description of Lord Robert CECIL as
“painfully struggling into the light
with one foot in the Middle Ages.”
Wednesday, March 31st.—The third
and last Act of the Home Rule drama
was the best. Nothing in the previous
two days' debate—not even Mr. BonAR
policy for Ireland—gripped the audience
so intensely as Sir Edward CARSON's
explanation of the Ulster attitude. He
declared that the Union had not failed
in Ulster, and would not have failed
anywhere if British politicians could
have refrained from bidding for Irish
votes. There was no alternative to it
but complete separation, and that was
what Home Rule would lead to. Ulster
did not want the Bill, and would not
vote for it; but, as the only alter-
native was the Act of 1944, she was
prepared to accept it as a pis aller, and
to work her new Parliament for all it
was worth. At least it would enable her
to find schools for the thirty thousand
Belfast children now debarred from
education. More than that, he was
prepared to co-operate with any men
from Southern Ireland who were will-
ing to work their Parliament in a
similar spirit; and he paid a personal
tribute to Mr. DEVLIN, whose courage
he admired though he detested his
politics.
Thus there were gleams of hope even
in his otherwise gloomy outlook, as the
PRIME MINISTER gladly acknowledged
in winding up the debate; and they
probably had some influence in swelling
the majority for the Bill, the figures
being 348 for the Second Reading, 94

entirely to blame. You shall judge.
There is a vacancy in my domestic
staff, and the rush to fill it has been
less enthusiastic than I could wish.
My housewifely heart leapt, therefore,
when, last Thursday morning, I espied
coming up the drive one whom I classed
at once as an applicant for the post of
housemaid. Nor was I deceived. She
gave the name of Eliza Smudge, and
said she came from my friend, Mrs.
Copplestone.
My suspicions were first aroused by her
extraordinary solicitude for my comfort.
“Outings” were entirely according to
my convenience. And when she added
that she liked to have plenty to do, and
that she always rose by 6 A.M., I began
to look at her closely.
She wore a thick veil, and her eyes
were further obscured by large specta-
cles, but I could discern a wisp of rather
artificial-looking hair drawn across her
forehead. And she was smiling.
Now why was she smiling? I could
certainly see nothing to smile at in
rising at six o'clock every morning.
“I shall be free on 5th of April,
ma'am,” she was saying. “Let me see,

in a flash—in one of those moments
of intuition of which even the mind of
the harassed housewife occasionally is
capable. It was Brenda Scott mas-

AT THE PLAY.
“UNCLE NED.” -
As the final curtain fell on the Fourth
Act there was talk of celebrating the
conversion of the villain in a bottle of
the best (1906). But this did not mean
that the good wine of the play had been
kept to the end. Indeed it had been
practically exhausted about the middle
of the Third Act, and the rest was bar-
ley-water, sweet but relatively insipid.
So long as Mr. HENRY AINLEY was just
allowed to sparkle, with beaded bubbles
winking all round the brim of him,
everything went well and more than
well; the trouble began when the
author, Mr. Douglas MURRAY, remem-
bered that no British audience would
be contented with mere irresponsible
badinage, however fresh and delicate;
that somehow he must provide an end-
ing where virtue prevailed and senti-
ment was satisfied.
So, when Uncle Ned's humour had
failed to move the brutal egoism of his
brother, beating upon it like the light-
est of sea-foam on a rock of basalt, he
was made to fall back upon the alterna-
tive of heavy denunciation. And it was
significant that this commonplace tirade
drew more applause than all the pretty
wit that had gone before it. Seldom
have I been so profoundly impressed
with the difficulties of an art which
depends for its success (financial, that
is to say) on the satisfaction of tastes
that have nothing in common beyond
the crudest elements of human nature.
Mr. AINLEY had things all his own
way. Between him, the romancer of the
light heart and the free fancy, and
his brother, the millionaire tradesman
of the tough hide, there was the clash
of temperaments but never the clash of
intellects. (“Nobody with a sense of
humour,” says Uncle Ned, “ever made
a million pounds.") That the man with
the iron will should be beaten at the
last with his own weapons, and brought
to see the lifelong error of his ways by
a violent philippic that must have sur-
prised the speaker hardly less than his
audience, was the most incredible thing
in the play. Indeed the author was
reduced to showing us the results of the
bad man's change of heart and leaving
us to imagine the processes, these being
worked out in the interval between two
Acts by means of a fortnight's physi-
cal collapse, from which he emerges
unrecognisably reformed.
I cannot praise too warmly the de-
lightfully fantastic and inconsequent
humour of the first half of the play.
Often it was the things that Mr. AINLEY
was given to say ; but even more often,
I think, it was the incomparable way
swift and unforeseen turns of gesture
and glance and movement which are
his peculiar gift. Now and then, to re-
mind us of his versatility, he may turn
to sentiment or even tragedy, but light
comedy remains his natural métier.
If I have a complaint to make it is
that Uncle Ted's studied refusal to
understand from an intimate woman-
friend why it was that his elder niece,
who had been privily married, “could
no longer hide her secret” (the reticence
of his friend was the sort of silly thing
that you get in books and plays, but
never in life) was perhaps a little
wanton and caused needless embarrass-
ment both to the young wife and to us.

And one need not be very squeamish to
feel that it was a pity to put into the

the rather precocious comment that she
makes on the inconvenience of a secret
marriage. The humour of the play
was too good to need assistance from
this sort of titillation.
Mr. RANDLE AYRTON, as the pluto-

“THE YouNG PERSON IN PINK.”
What the chair-man said about The
Young Person in Pink who had been
hanging about the Park every morning
for a week was that nowadays you
couldn't reelly tell. He thought on the
whole she was all right. The balloon-
woman was certain that with boots
like that she must be a 'ussy; but then
she had refused to buy a balloon. As
a matter of fact she couldn't, being
broke to the world. And worse. For
she had arrived at Victoria Station un-
able to remember who she was or where
she came from, ticketless, a few shil-
lings in her purse. She had murmured
“Season" at the barrier and had taken
rooms at the Carlton because she had
a queer feeling she had been there be-
fore. Her things had a coronet on
them. The rest was a blank.
Of course nobody believed her; the
women were scornful, the men not quite
nice, till very young Lord Stevenage,
the one that was engaged to a notori-
ous baby-snatcher, Lady Tonbridge—
in a high fever he'd unfortunately said
“Yes”—meets her, and you guess the
rest. No, you don't. You couldn't
possibly guess Mrs. Badger, relict of an
undertaker and now in the old-clothes
line, who has social ambitions. (I must
here say in parenthesis that Mrs. Badger
is a double stroke of genius on the part
both of Miss JENNINGs the author and
of Miss SYDNEY FAIRBROTHER. You
don't know which to admire most, the
things she says [Miss J.] or the way
she says them [Miss S. B.]. Honours
divided and high honours at that.)
Lady Tonbridge had advertised for a
clergyman's widow to render some
secretarial service, and the ambitious
Mrs. Badger had applied, duly weeded.
Meanwhile the elderly Lady T. had
seen her fiancé and with the young
person in pink, and it was a brilliant
and base afterthought to bribe the
clergyman's widow to claim the girl as
her long-missing daughter (invented).
Both the young Lord and the young
person, too much in love perhaps to be
critical, accept the situation; but you

MY ONE ADMIRER.
Of course my wife had made me go
to the bazaar. All men go to bazaars
either because their wives send them,
or in search of possible wives. The
men who are never at bazaars are
those with humane wives, or the true
bachelors.
I did not mind the young lady who
grabbed my walking-stick and presented
me with a shilling cloakroom ticket,
or the other who placed a buttonhole
in my coat (two-and-sixpence), or the
third who sprayed me with scent (one
shilling, but had I known of the
threatened attack I would have paid
two shillings for immunity), or the
fourth, who snatched my rather elderly
silk hat and renovated it, not before its
time, with some mysterious fluid (one-
and-ninepence). These are the things
one expects.
But when I faced the stalls I must
admit that I trembled. In pre-war
days it was occasionally hinted that
bazaar prices were a trifle high. What
would they be now 2 How could I face
the Bazaar profiteer? Sums, reminding
me of schooldays, ran in my head, “If
milk be a shilling a quart what will be
the price of a sofa-cushion ?”
As I stood in the centre of the hall
I could see that the eyes of the stall-
holders were upon me–cold, horrid,
calculating eyes. I could read in them,
“How much has this man got?” I
felt that it would be a proper punish-
ment for war-profiteers if they were
sentenced to purchase all their require-
ments at bazaars for six months.
Glancing round the hall in search
of a place of refuge I saw a sign,
“Autograph Exhibition—Admission one
shilling.” A shilling! Why, such a
comfortable hiding-place would have
been cheap at half-a-crown. I bolted
for the Autograph Exhibition before a
piratical lady, bearing down on me
with velvet smoking caps, could reduce
me to pulp. - . . . .
A smiling elderly gentleman was
in charge. “Hah, you would like to
see my little collection ? Certainly,
certainly.”
I am not interested in autographs.
Most bygone celebrities wrote unde-
cipherable hands. I have been equally
puzzled in trying to read the hand-
writing of GUY FAwKEs and Mr.
GLADSTONE. But this collection was
different. It had letters from nearly
every one distinguished in the world
to-day — good, lengthy, interesting,
readable letters.
“How did you contrive to get all
these ?” I asked the exhibitor.
“Tact, foresight and flattery, my
to these people to-day. You'd get
ignored, or at best two lines type-
written by a secretary. Now look at
that long letter from LLoyd GEORGE
about Welsh nationality and that other
from HILAIRE BELLoc concerning the
adulteration of modern beer. You
couldn't get them now. My idea is to
catch your celebrity young. When a
man produces his first play or novel
or book of poems I write him an ad-
miring letter. You can't lay it on too
thick. Ask him some question on a
topic that interests him. It always
draws. They are unused to praise and
you catch them before the public has
spoilt them. I card-index all the
replies I get. Of course nine out of
ten of the people turn out of no
account, but some are sure to come off.
You just throw out the failures and
put the successes in your collection."
At this point I heard our Archdeacon
afar off. Our Archdeacon booms—not
like trade, but like the bittern. I heard
him booming outside, “My dear lady,
I cannot miss the chance of seeing dear
Mr. Fletterby's collection.”
Fletterby The name was familiar.
Long years ago I published something
—don't inquire into the details of my
crime—and the sole response I had
from an unappreciative world was a
highly eulogistic letter from one Samuel
Fletterby. I remembered the time I
had spent in writing him a lengthy and
courteous reply. I remembered that
often in my darker days I had drawn
out the letter of Fletterby to encourage
1116.
- And now ! I looked at the collection.
It was arranged alphabetically. As
I turned to the initial of my name I
framed a dramatic revelation for my
friend Fletterby: “That writing is
familiar to me. In fact, Mr. Fletterby,
I am its unworthy writer.”
But my letter was not included in
the collection. -
“Throw out the failures,” Mr. Flet-
terby had said. - -
I threw myself out instantly from
the Autograph Exhibition. Better, far
better buy things I didn't want at
prices I couldn't afford than stay in the
company of that faithless one, my sole
erstwhile (as the papers say) admirer.
There was a great athlete named RUDD
Who was born with a Blue in his blood;
Stout-hearted, spring-heeled,

What his Varsity lost on the flood.

A cynic emitted this jape:
“Pray notice, old son,

EASTER IN WILD WALES.
THE recent discovery (duly noted in
The Daily Graphic of the 30th ult.) of
“seven pearls of excellent quality" by
an Aberavon labourer in a mussel
stranded by the tide has led to an
extraordinary influx of visitors to that
quiet seaside resort. Costers have been
arriving at the rate of several hundreds
a day, attracted by the prospect of
finding the raw materials for the indis-
pensable decoration of their costumes,
and the local authorities are at their
wits' end to provide adequate accom-
modation. Amongst the latest arrivals
is the great architect, Sir MARTIN CoN-
wAY, who has been consulted with
regard to the erection of a number of
bungalow skyscrapers, and an urgent
message has been despatched to Sir
Edwin LUTYENs at Delhi, begging him
to supply designs of a suitable character.
Meanwhile pearl-diving goes on day and
night on the sea-front, with the assist-
ance of a flock of oyster-catchers, whose
brilliant plumage adds greatly to the
picturesqueness of the scene. -
Though the special good forture of
Aberavon has excited a certain amount
of natural jealousy in the breasts of
hotel and boarding-house proprietors at
other Welsh seaside resorts, they have
no serious reason to complain. The
usual attractions of Barmouth have
been powerfully reinforced by the pre-
sence in the neighbouring hills of a
full-sized gorilla which recently escaped
from a travelling menagerie. When
last seen the animal was making in the
direction of Harlech, which is at present
the head-quarters of the Easter Vaca-
tion School of the Cambrian section of
the Yugo-Slav Doukhobors. It is un-
derstood that the local police have the
matter well in hand, and arrangements
have been made, in case of emergency,
for withdrawing all the population
within the precincts of the castle.
Great disappointment prevails at
Llandudno owing to the refusal of Mr.
Evan RoPERTs, the famous revivalist,
to localise the materialisation of the
Millennium, which he has recently
prophesied, at Llandudno during the
Easter holidays. By way of a set-off
an effort was made to induce Sir
AUCKLAND GEDDEs to give a vocal re-
cital before his departure for America.
As his recent performance at a meeting
of the London Scots Club proved, Sir
AUCKLAND is a singist of remarkable
power, infinitehumour and soul-shaking
pathos. Unfortunately his repertory is
confined to Scottish songs, and on this
ground he has been obliged to decline
the invitation, though the fee offered
was unprecedented in the economic

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ForresT REID is a writer upon whose progress I have
for some time kept an appreciative eye. His latest story,
bearing the attractive title of Pirates of the Spring (UNWIN),
proves, I think, that progress to be well sustained. As
you may have guessed from the name, this is a tale of
adolescence; it shows Mr. REID's North-Ireland lads differ-
ing slightly from the more familiar home-product, though
less in essentials than in tricks of speech, and (since these
are day-school boys, exposed to the influence of their several
homes) an echo of religious conflict happily rare in the
experience of English youth. Mr. REID is amongst the
few novelists who can be sympathetic to boyhood without
sentimentalising over it; he has admirably caught its strange
mingling of pride and curiosity, of reticence and romance
and jealous loyalty. The tale has no particular plot; it is
a record of seeming trifles, friendships made and broken and
renewed, sporadic adventures and deep-laid intrigues that
lead nowhere. But you will catch in it a real air of youth,
a spring-time wind blowing from the half-forgotten world
in which all of us once were chartered privateers. There
are, of course, worthy folk who would be simply bored
by all this—which is why I do not venture to call
more fortunate, will find it a true and delicately observed
study of an engaging theme.
I must really warn the flippant. It would be appalling if
admirers of Literary (and other) Lapses were to send blithely
to the libraries for Mr. LEAcock's latest and find them-
selves landed with The Unsolved Riddle of Social Justice.
(LANE). And yet I don't know. Here is a subject which
even the flippant cannot long ignore. And a man of the
world with a clear head and a mastery of clearer idiom than
a professor of political economy usually commands has
here said something desperately serious without a trace of
dulness. I should like Professor LEAcock's short book to
be divided into three. The first part, a trenchant analysis
of some of the evils of our social and industrial system,
I would send to the impossibilists and obstructives; the
second, a critical examination of some of the nostrums of
the progressives, should go to the hasty optimists who
think that a sudden change of system will as suddenly
change men, for it contains much that they will do well
(and now resolutely refuse) to ponder. The third part I
would return to the author for revision, for it contains no
more, when analysed, than an ipse diacit, and quite fails to
show that the evils denounced as intolerable in the first
part can be remedied without some substantial portion at

I would remind him, or rather perhaps the more ingenuous
of his readers, that there have been later contributions to
the theory and practice of new-world building than Mr.
BELLAMY's Looking Backward.
The Great Desire (Hodder AND Stoughton) is a novel full
of shrewd philosophy and excellent talk. Mr. ALEXANDER
BLACK sets out to prove nothing, to justify no political or
social attitude, but just to draw his fellow-Americans as he
sees them going about their war-time business, the “great
desire” being simply the thing that is uppermost in the
mind of each one. As a composite picture of what New
And, although the girl is annoyed, it is not on account of
the citation. Much of the story, however, deals with Chicago,
and since my previous knowledge of that city could have
easily been contained in a tin of pressed beef I can pardon
Mr. GIBBON for being as informative about it as he is about
Oxford colleges. ... (He seems, by the way, to have a rooted
contempt for Balliol, which I had always supposed was a
quite well-meaning place.) On the whole, either in spite
or because of its rather Baedeker-like qualities, Drums Afar
will be found quite a restful and readable book.
Somewhere in the course of the tale that gives its title to
York thought about the busi-
ness of getting into the War
the result could hardly be
bettered. One never feels
that latent antagonism which
readers, even though they
may agree with him, uncon-
sciously experience towards
an author who seems to be
arguing a point. Mr. BLACK
gives the extreme views of the
blatant patriot, and of the
anarchist and socialist who
cannot see the distinction
between arguing against war
on paper and arguing against
this War on the street corner.
He makes us realise the peo-
ple who think only how to
make the War an adjunct of:
themselves and those who de-
sire only to make themselves
a useful adjunct of the War.
He draws his types cleverly
and states the case of each one
fairly, but with a humorous
restraint and from a stand-
point of absolute detachment.
The Great Desire has plenty
of charm regarded merely as a
story, but I recommend it
especially to those who are
apt to judge the Americans
by their politicians or to assess
New York on the basis of the
IIEARST newspapers.
If it were only for his com-
plete fearlessness in following
well-worn convention and
his apparent reliance on his

The Blower of Bubbles (CHAM.
BERs) the character who is
supposed to relate it denies
that he is a sentimentalist.
I may as well say at once
that, if this denial is intended
to apply also to Mr. ARTHUR
BEVERLEY BAxTER, who
wrote the five stories that
make up the volume, a more
comprehensive misstatement
was never embodied in print.
Because, from the picture on
the wrapper, representing a
starry-eyed infant conducting
an imaginary orchestra, to
the final page, the book is
one riot of sentiment—plots,
characters and treatment
alike. Not that, save by the
fastidious, it must be con-
sidered any the worse for
this; even had not Mr. BAx-
TER's hearty little preface
explained the conditions of
active service under which it
was composed, themselves
enough to excuse any quan-
tity of over-sweetening. I
will not give you the five
long-shorts in detail. The
first, about a German child
and a young man with heart
trouble, shows Mr. BAxTER at
his worst, with the sob-stuff
all but overwhelming a suffi-
ciently nimble wit. My own
favourite is the fifth tale, a
spirited and generous tribute
to England's war effort. (I
should explain that the book,
IT 2 "
readers' ignorance or want of memory, Mr. J. MURRAY
GIBBoN's Drums Afar (LANE) would be rather a remarkable
book in these psycho-analytical days. His hero actually
has the audacity to have blue eyes and fair hair, to start
his career in the House, and to end it, so far as the novel
is concerned, lying wounded in a hospital, where his fiancée,
a famous singer, happened to be a nurse in the same ward.
Nor does the young man disdain the threadbare conversa-
tional cliché. “Don't you think there is something
elemental in most of us which no veneer of civilisation or
artificial living can ever deaden?” he says in one place
(rather as if veneer were a kind of rat poison). Still bolder,
on leaving America, where he has become engaged to a
wealthy Chicagan's daughter, he quotes—
“I could not love thee, dear, so much
and I suppose the author also, is by origin Canadian.)
This last story, told partly in the form of letters to his
editor in New York by an American officer and journalist,
has all the interest that comes of seeing ourselves as others
see us; though I could not but think that the narrator
erred in making the haughty Lady Dorothy, daughter of
his noble hosts, exclaim, on the entrance of a footman with
a letter, “Pardon me, it's the mail.” So there you are.
If you have a taste for stories that make no pretence of
being other than fiction pure and simple, limpidly pure
and transparently simple (yet witty too in places), try
these; otherwise pass.

OUR SUPER-PILGRIM'S PROGRESS.
THE meagre and tantalizing report of Lord Northsquith's
great journey through Spain and North Africa which has
been issued through Reuter's agency has stimulated but not
allayed curiosity. It is therefore with unſeigned pleasure
that we are able to supplement this jejune summary with
some absolutely authentic details supplied us by a Levantine
detective of unimpeachable veracity who shadowed the party.
Of the journey through Spain he has little to say. Lord
Northsquith attended a bull-fight at Seville, at which an
extraordinary incident occurred. At the moment when the
distinguished visitor entered the ring and was taking his
seat in the Royal Box, the bull, a huge and remarkably
ferocious animal, suddenly threw up its hind legs and, after
pawing the air convulsively for a few seconds, fell dead on
the spot. No reason could be assigned for this rash act,
which caused a very painful impression, but it is a curious
fact that it synchronized exactly with the issue of the special
edition of the Seville evening Tarántula, with the placard
“Strange behaviour (extravagancia) of the British Prime
Minister.” - -
At a subsequent interview with Count Roxi.ANONEs, Lord
Northsquith was reluctantly obliged to confirm the state-
ment that Mr. LLOYD GEORGE was still under the impression
that the Spanish Alhambra was a late replica of a theatre
in London, but begged him not to attach undue importance
to the misapprehension. - -
The tour in Morocco was not attended by any specially
untoward incidents, but at Marrakesh a group of Berbers
ovinced some hostility, which was promptly converted into
effusive enthusiasm on their learning that Lord Northsquith
was not of Welsh origin. Similar assurances were conveyed
to the sardine-fishers of the coast, with beneficial results.
The Pasha of Marrakesh expressed the hope that Lord
Northsquith was not disappointed with the Morocco Atlas,
and the illustrious stranger wittily rejoined, “No, but you
should see my new morocco-bound Times Atlas.” When
the remark was translated to the Pasha he laughed very
courteously.
Always interested in the relics of the mighty past Lord
Northsquith made a special trip to the East Algerian High-
lands to visit Timgad, and spent several minutes in the
tepidarium of the Roman baths. It was understood from
the expression of his features that he was profoundly im-
pressed by the superiority of the arrangements over those
contemplated by the Coalition Minister of Health in the
new bath-houses to be erected in Limehouse.
Lastly the tour included a flying visit to Carthage. The
French archaeologists in charge of the excavations had
recently dug up a colossal statue of IIANNIBAL, and the
resemblance to Lord Northsquith was so extraordinary that
many of them were moved to transports of delight. They
were however unanimous in their conviction that the de-
plorable state of the ruins was largely, if not entirely, due
to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's ignorance of Phoenician geography.
A Startling Disclosure.
From “Answers to Correspondents” in a Canadian Paper:
“Q.—Is it not a fact, that all of Lipton's challengers were built
stronger and heavier than the American cup defenders, to enable
them to cross the Atlantic?—A. D. B., Montreal.
A.—Yes, they were built stronger as they had to cross the ocean
under their own steam.”

never go to the really amusing places
and never know the really interesting
things. For instance they have never
yet explained what it is that the House
of Commons smells of. I do not refer
to the actual Chamber, which merely
smells like the Tube, but the lofty pas-
sages and lobbies where the statues
are. The smell, I think, is a mixture
of cathedrals and soap. It is a baffling
but rather seductive smell, and they
tell me that the policemen miss it when
they are transferred to point-duty. Pos-
sibly it is this smell which makes ex-
Premiers want to go back there.
But let us have no cheap mockery
of the Houses of Parliament, because
there is a lot to be said for them. They
are much the best houses for hide-and-
seek I know. The parts which are
dear to the public, the cathedral parts,
are no good for that, but behind them
there are miles and miles of superb
secret passages and back staircases, the
very place for a wet afternoon. They
are decorated like second-class waiting-
rooms and lead to a lot of rooms like
third-class waiting-rooms; and at every
corner there is a policeman; but this
only adds to the excitement. Besides,
at any moment you may blunder into
some very secret waiting-room labelled
“Serjeant-at-Arms.”
If you are seen by the SERJEANT-AT-
ARMs you have lost the game, and if
you are seen by a Lord of the Treasury
I gather from the policemen that you
would be put in the Tower. Or you may
start light-heartedly from the Refresh-
ment Department of the House of
Commons and find yourself suddenly in
the bowels of the House of Lords, pro-
bably in the very passage to the Lord
CHANCELLOR's Secretary's Room.
Still, there is no other way for
Private Secretaries to take exercise and
at the same time avoid their Members
without actually leaving the building,
so risks of that sort have to be faced.
While the Private Secretary is play-
purlieus his Member waits for him in
the Secretaries' Room. The Secretaries'
Room is the real seat of legislation in
this country, and it is surprising that
Mr. BAGEHOT gave it no place in his
account of the Constitution. It is also
surprising, in view of its importance,
that it should be such a dismal, ill-
furnished and thoroughly mouldy room.
It is a rotten room. Mr. Asquith,
when a Private Secretary, is reported
to have said of it, “In the whole course
of my political career I can recall no
case of administrative myopia at all
parallel to the folly or ineptitude which
has condemned the authors of legisla-
tion in His Majesty's Parliament to dis-
charge their functions in this grotesque
travesty of a legislative chamber, this
sombre and obscure repository of
mouldering archives and forgotten re-
cords, where the constructive states-
men of to-morrow are expected to shape
their Utopias in an atmosphere of
disillusion and decay, in surroundings
appointed to be the shameful sepulchre
of the nostrums of the past.” If that
is what Mr. Asquith said, I agree with

and under them and all round them
him; if he didn't say it, I wish he had.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The room is pitch-dark always, and
it is full of tables and tomes. The
tables are waiting-room tables and the
tomes are as Mr. Asquith has described
them. It is divided into two by a swing-
door. One part is the female Private
Secretary part, the other is the male
Private Secretary part, and it is lament-
able to record that no romance has ever
occurred between a male Private Secre-
tary and a female one.
The room is plentifully supplied with
House of Commons' stationery, which
disappears at an astonishing rate. This
is because the Members come in and
remove it by the gross, knowing full
well that the SERJEANT-AT-ARMs will
suspect the Private Secretaries. It is
a hard world.
However, this is where the Members
come to their Private Secretaries for in-
structions. They come there nominally
to dictate letters to their constituents,
but really they come to be told what
amendments to move and what ques-
tions to ask and what the Drainage
Bill is about, and whether they ought
to support the Dentist Qualification
(Ireland) (No. 2) Bill, or not. It is
awful to think that if the Private
Secretaries downed tools the whole
machinery of Parliament would stop.
No questions would be asked and no
amendments moved and no speeches
made. The Government would have
things all their own way. Unless,
of course, the Government's Private
Secretaries struck too. But of course
the Government's Privato Secretaries
never would, the dirty blacklegs'
After the Secretaries' Room perhaps
the most interesting thing in the two
Houses is the House of Lords sitting
as the Supreme Court. I’verybody
ought to see that. There is a nice old
man sitting in the middle in plain
clothes and several other nice old men
in plain clothes sitting about on the
benches, with little card-tables in front
of them. Two or three of them have
beards, which is against the best tra-
ditions of the Law. But they are very
jolly old men, and now and then one
of them sits up and moves his lips.
You can see then that he is putting a
sly question to the barrister who is
talking at the counter, though you can't
hear anything because they all whisper.
While the barrister is answering, an-
other old man wakes up and puts a
sly question, so as to confuse the
barrister. That is the game. The bar-
rister who gets thoroughly annoyed
first loses the case.
They have quite enough to annoy
them already. They are all cooped up
in a minute pen about eight feet square.
There are eight of them, four K.C.’s and
Excitable Tenor (during dispute about the bill). “BUT, MY FRIEND, You Not KNow ME
WHo I AM—No? I AM Spof FERINo.

put their papers and nowhere to stretch
their legs. They sit there getting cramp,
or they stand at the counter talking to
the old men. In either position they
grow more and more annoyed. Four
of them are famous men, earning thou-
sands and thousands. Why do they
endure it? Because lawyers, contrary
to the common belief, are the most
long-suffering profession in the world.
That is why they are the only Trade
Union whose members have only half-
an-hour for lunch. Well, it is their
funeral; but if I were a K.C. sitting in
that pen, with the whole of the House
of Lords empty in front of me, I should
get over the counter and walk about.
Then the LoRD CHANCELLOR might have
a fit; and that alone would make it
worth while.
The only otherinteresting place in the
Dining Room. This is interesting be-
cause the Members there are all terri-
fied lest you should hear what they are
going to say. They never know who
may be at the next table—a journalist
or a Bolshevist or a landowner—and
they talk with one eye permanently over
their shoulder. It must be very painful.
But of course the best time to visit
the House is when it is not sitting, be-
cause then, if you are lucky, you may
sit with impunity on the Front Bench
and put your feet up on the table. If
you are unlucky you will be shot at
dawn. - A. P. H.

LABOUR AND THE RUSSIAN BALLET.
I wasN'T present at the station when
Madame PAvLovA arrived in London,
bringing with her, as I have been as-
sured by six different newspapers, no
fewer than three hundred and eighty-
five pieces of luggage. But I have
seen, thanks to Sir J. M. BARRIE, the
transformation which a Russian prima
ballerina makes in an English country
home, so I happen to know exactly
what occurred. I think it deserves to
be recorded. Very well then.
Scene.—A Metropolitan railway term-
inus, though you wouldn't perhaps re-
cognise it, because it looks a little like
the interior of a Greek cathedral and a
little like the fair at Nijni Novgorod,
and the posters have obviously been
painted by Mr. WYNDHAM LEwis
or somebody like that. One porter is
discovered leaning against an auto-
matic sweet machine designed by an
Earpressionist sculptor. He is wear-
ing a long mole-coloured smock, and
looking with extreme disfavour at his
luggage-truck, which has somehow got
itself painted bright blue and green,
with red wheels. Music by J. H.
Thomaski.
| Enter L., puffing slowly, the boat-
train. The engine and carriages
resemble Early-Victorian prints.
Madame PAVLovA descends, and
in a very expressive dance con-
veys to the Porter that she has
one or two trunks in the guard's
van which she wants him to con-
vey to a taxicab. -
Porter. 'Ow many is there, lady ?

and points three hundred and
eighty-five times at the station-
roof with her right toe.

[PAvLovA dances a dance indicative
of absolute and heartrending de-
spair, terminating in an appeal
to the heavens to come to her aid.

ally announces that the thing is
entirely contrary to the principles
of their Union, and if the Station-
master permits it he must take
the consequences. The C.E.C.
disappear. -

Porter. We'll do it. (He dances.)
Here goes, Mum.
[Enter, suddenly, chorus of porters
with multi-coloured trucks. (They
are the same as the C.E.C. really,
but they have changed their
clothes.) Aided by the S.M. and
Bill they remove the three hun-
dred and eighty-five packages,
and wheel them, walking on their
toes, to the station exit, R. Here
is seen a taxicab whose driver is
wrapped in profound meditation
and smoking a hookah, the bowl
of which rests on the pavement.
It is represented to him that a
lady with some luggage desires to
charter his conveyance and pro-
ceed to Hampstead. He comes for ||
ward to the centre and ea plains:
1. That it is near the dinner-
hour.
2. That he has no petrol.
3. That he wouldn't do it for
LLOYD GEORGE hisself.
IIe retires to his vehicle and re-
sumes his hookah. PAvLovA
dances some dances expressive of
Spring, of Butterflies, of Flowers,
of Unlimited Gold. In the midst
of the final passage the driver
leaps from his seat, rushes on to
the platform, jumps three hun-
dred and eighty-five times into
the air, whirls PAvLovA off her
toes and dashes from side to side,
carrying her in one hand. He
finally flings her into the tacicab
and returns to his seat. The lug-
gage is piled upon the roof by
dancing porters and tied with
muany-coloured ribbons. The tari
departs in a cloud of petrol, the
driver steering with his toes and
manipulating the clutches with
his hands. Farewells are waved
and finally, surrounded by the
rest of the porters, the Station
Master and Bill dance a dance
of Glad Sacrifice, stab themselves
with their hands, and die.

Shall we go back that way
To those dear hills that the hunters

Where the hearts of the hunters stay;

While I and my like tell old, old

PEACE WITH HONOUR.
This is the story of Mr. Holmes, the
Curate, and of how he brought peace
to our troubled house. The principal
characters are John, my brother-in-law,
and Margery, my unmarried sister, and,
at the bottom of the programme, in large
letters, Mr. Holmes, the Curate. I have
a small walking-on part. The story
will now commence.
John and Margery went out for a
walk in the beautiful Spring sunshine
as friendly as friendly. They came back
three hours later—well, Cecilia (his
wife) and I heard them at least two
villages away. -
They both rushed into the room
covered with mud and shouting at the
before you existed at all, it was my
custom to ramble o'er the dewy meads,
plucking the nimble Nipplewort and
the shy Speedwell. I breakfasted on
botany.”
“Talking of botany,” I broke in,
“there was a chap in my platoon—"
John groaned loudly.
“Do you suggest,” I asked, “that he
was not in my platoon 2"
“I suggest nothing,” he answered;
“I only know that they can't all have
been in your platoon.”
“All who, John ”’’ asked Cecilia.
“All the chaps he tells us about.
Haven't you noticed, since he came
home, it's impossible to mention any
type or freak or extraordinary indi-
vidual that wasn't like somebody in
“That is all, Cecilia,” I said; “that
is how he got to Blighty."
“We will now proceed with the sub-
ject in hand,” said John after a mo-
ment's silence. He produced a small
crushed piece of green-stuff from his
pocket.
“The question before the house is,
as we used to say in the Great War,
‘Qu'est-ce-que c'est que ceci ?' Any
suggestions that it is of the Lemon
species will be returned unanswered.
For my part I say it is Hairy Bitter-
cress.”
“And I say it's Hazel Catkin,” said
Margery.
“And what says Hubert the herbal-
ist?” asked John, handing the weed
to me.

John, “order this girl
out of my house. She
shan't stay under my
roof another hour.”

Margery, “he 's an

wretch, and thank
Heaven he isn't my
husband.”
I put a cushion over
my head.
Cecilia kept hers.
“If you will both go
out of the room,” she
said, “take off your
filthy boots and come
back in your right
minds and decent
clothing I'll try to un-

This chap had the same affliction that
has taken Margery and yourself. He
spent his life searching for specimens
of the Bingle-weed and the five-leaved
Funglebid. At bayonet-drill he would
stop in the middle of a “long-point, short-
point, jab' to pluck asudden Oojah-berry
that caught his eye. In the end his
passion got him to Blighty.”

“Well,” I continued, “it was the

myself were retiring on the village of

throw out. -
“Catkin yourself,” from John, and
so on ad lib.
They kept it carefully in a small pot
in the window, and if one looked at it
the other watched jealously for foul
play.
“On Saturday,” said John, “the
Curate is coming to tea. He is a man
of wisdom and a botanist to boot—or
do I mean withal? On Saturday the
Hairy Bittercress shall be publicly pro-
claimed by its rightful name."
“Which is Hazel Catkin,” said Mar-
gery.

him at the door.

CHIPPO'S SCENARIO.
(With the British Army in France.)
It was the Société Grand Guignol de
Cinéma's busy day. On the beach at
Petiteville cameras were rattling away
like machine guns, orders from the
producer were hissing through the air
with the vicious hum of explosive
bullets, and weary supers were march-
ing and counter-marching in a state of
hopeless apathy. -
At the very height of these operations
Chippo Munkswandered intothecamera
barrage and got firmly entangled in
the picture. As “crowd in background”
was indicated by the scenario, the
producer refrained from killing Chippo
out of hand—in fact he invited his co-
operation for another crowd a little
later on. Thus it was that Chippo
earned the right to describe himself as
a “fillum actor,” with licence to speak
familiarly of his colleagues, CHARLEs
CHAPLIN and MARY Dickford, and full
powers to pose as the ultimate au-
thority of the camp whenever cinemas
At the Café des Promeneurs it was
generally assumed that Chippo was
merely waiting for a fat contract from
the Société Grand Guignol, and pending
its arrival he explained that he was
constructing a suitable scenario.
“The public,” he said, “is fed up
with Texas rancheros in Anzac 'ats and
antimacassar trousers playing poker

tained burst of rapid fire against their

“The same answering to the name of

“The name on the programme is

“YEs—THE CAT ' "
CHIPPO'S SCENARIO.
(With the British Army in France.)
It was the Société Grand Guignol de
Cinéma's busy day. On the beach at
Petiteville cameras were rattling away
like machine guns, orders from the
producer were hissing through the air
with the vicious hum of explosive
bullets, and weary supers were march-
ing and counter-marching in a state of
hopeless apathy. . -
At the very height of these operations
Chippo Munkswandered intothecamera
barrage and got firmly entangled in
the picture. As “crowd in background”
was indicated by the scenario, the
producer refrained from killing Chippo
out of hand—in fact he invited his co-
operation for another crowd a little
later on. Thus it was that Chippo
earned the right to describe himself as
a “fillum actor,” with licence to speak
familiarly of his colleagues, Charles
CHAPLIN and MARY Dickford, and full
powers to pose as the ultimate au-
thority of the camp whenever cinemas
At the Café des Promeneurs it was
generally assumed that Chippo was
merely waiting for a fat contract from
the Société Grand Guignol, and pending
its arrival he explained that he was
constructing a suitable scenario.
“The public,” he said, “is fed up
with Texas rancheros in Anzac 'ats and
antimacassar trousers playing poker
dice with one 'and and keeping a sus-
tained burst of rapid fire against their
opponents with the other. They wants
something true to life. Now, my fillum
opens at the Café de l'Avenir, where a
stout old British soldier runs a Crown
an' Anchor board at personal loss, but
'appy in the knowledge that 'e is
amusing his comrades.”
“The same answering to the name of
Chippo Munks 2 " interjected Chris
Jones.
“The name on the programme is
Reginald Denvers,” said Chippo firmly.
“Acrost the way, at the Café de la
Wache Noire, a drunken unprincipled

Blaney, “I’ll play where I blinking

If I buy from these derelict millions
Though the spirit's long since been a

Though the uttermost heel-tap be

I will give them a place of high honour,
Well knowing that once they con-

My solace when seasons were rotten,
When the cold put my courage to

Or the sergeant, perchance, had for-

To kiss me good-night.
In a world that is apt to be trying,
When things are inclined to go ill
And I'm sitting despondently sigh-

Perhaps they will comfort me still;
At the sight of these humble mementoes
It may be once more I shall know
From the crown of my head to my ten

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WORD-BUILDERS;
A SHORTAGE OF STRAw.
Aitchkin has been doing great things
in forage, but prosperity has not spoilt
him. Although he must be aware that
I remember him in pre-war days, when
he used to strap-bang to the City with
his lunch in a satchel, nevertheless he
often invites me round on those rare oc-
casions when he dines quietly at home.
The other evening, as he toyed with
a modest eight-course dinner, I per-
ceived that his cheerfulness was a trifle
forced, and I thought that probably he
was worrying over the behaviour of his
little son, who, tiring that afternoon of
his motor scooter, had done incalculable
damage to the orchid-house with a
home-made catapult.
When we were left alone with our
cigars he unburdened his soul. It
appears that, ever since the Armistice,
ambition has spurred Aitchkin to be
something more than the “A. Co.” of a
firm which has become torpid with war
profits. He had decided to start in
business “on” his lonesome,” and to
make “Aitchkin" and “forage" synony-
mous terms. Already he had taken
over the premises of a sovereign purse-
maker at a “reasonable figure.” (When
Aitchkin is “reasonable" somebody
loses money.) But his bargain did not
include a Telegraphic Address, and that
morning, working from his letter-head-
ing, “Alfred Aitchkin,” he had brought
himself to compose an appropriate
word. To the “Alf " of the Christian
name he added “Alpha " representing
the initial of the surname (I suspected
the assistance of his lady-typist), making
the complete word “Alf - Alpha” or,
written phonetically,"Alfalfa"—Spanish
for lucerne. It was a word which
could not fail to fix itself indelibly in
the minds of his clients, for it recalled
not only Aitchkin's name, but the com-
modity he dealt in. Full of the pride
of authorship he had driven round to the
G.P.O. in his touring car.
“But they crabbed it at once,” he
said sadly. “Telegraphic addresses
nowadays have to conform to a lot of
rotten new rules.”
He handed me a slip of paper on
which, over the dead body of “Alfalfa,”
he had jotted down the following
notes : —
(1) Not less than eight, not more
than ten letters.
(2) Must not be composed of words
or parts of words.
(3) Words or parts of words may be
accepted if they appear in the middle.
(4) Must not look like a word.
(5) Must be pronounceable.
(6) Russian names, on account of
“And what's more,” Aitchkin con-
tinued, “even when you've got a word
which the Department will accept, it
has to be submitted to a Committee
who take ‘ten to fourteen days' to
make up their minds.” -
A faint tinkling of the piano came to
our ears. Mrs. Aitchkin was waiting
to sing to us. I produced pencil and
paper and threw myself heart and soul
into Aitchkin's problem.
“Rules 2 and 3 are a little contra-
dictory,” I said, “and it will require no
slight ingenuity to form a combination
of letters which shall be pronounceable
(Rule 5) and yet avoid the damnable
appearance of a word (Rule 4). The con-
cession about Russian names reminds
me of something I have read about
shaking hands with murder. In any
case it is a barren concession, because,
as we have seen, telegraphic addresses
must be pronounceable. There is some-
thing sinister here,” I continued. “This
is the work of no ordinary mind. Some
legal brain is behind all this.”
Love of the bizarre and the latitude
of the Russian Rule led me to make
my first attempt with the name of that
all-round Bolshevik sportsman, BLodN-
JINRoFF, and I was endeavouring to
abridge it to not less than eight and not
more than ten letters without spoiling
the natural beauty of the name when
Aitchkin stopped me rather brusquely.
And my next effort, “PLUCROEs,” he
quashed, because he said that the im-
placable suspicion of the G.P.O. would
be at once aroused by the diphthong. I
fancy, though, from the narrowing of
his eyes that he had some misgivings
as to the derivation of the word.
I then set to work with alternate
consonants and vowels (which must
give a pronounceable word), dealing
with difficulties under the other rules
as they might arise. Meanwhile Aitch-
kin, after the manner of an obstruc-
tionist official of the worst type, sat
over me with the rules, condemning my
results. Even “Telegrams: HAHAHA-
HAHA London,” merely caused him to
sniff contemptuously.
“You’ll like this one," I exclaimed—
ARLEYoTA. This is a combination of
the word 'barley' (the ‘b’ being
treated as obsolete like the ‘n’ in
‘norange') and the word ‘oat' with
the 'a' and 't' transposed.”
Aitchkin was interested. Breathing
heavily, he tested the word with each
rule in turn, while I sat relaxed in my
chair. I pictured ARLEYoTA passed by
the Department and brought into a
hushed chamber before a solemn con-
clave of experts. How they would
probe and analyse it during those
momentous ten to fourteen days. And
they discovered that ARLEYotA begins
and ends with the indefinite article.
Aitchkin thrust the papers into his
pocket and rose abruptly, jamming the
stopper more tightly into a decanter
with his podgy hand.
“Not too bad, ARLEYoTA," he said
loftily; “I’ll get them to polish it up
at the office to-morrow.” (So I was
right about the lady-typist).
He opened the door and we passed
out. -
“But it ends in TA,” he shouted
against the Roses of Picardy which
now came with unbroken force from
the drawing-room. “‘TA' is a word,
you know.”
“You may use it as such,” I bawled,
“but they've never heard of it among
the staff of the G.P.O.”

ON THE WESTERN FRONT.
ONCE again we are “for it.” It is
that heavy hour between five and six
when the vitality is all too low for
the ordeal that awaits us. On either
side the far-flung battle line of cluster-
ing figures stretches away into the
gloom. It is an inspiring sight, this
tense silent crowd of men of every
class and vocation, united by a common
where a muttered curse or the sharp
cry of the injured bears testimony to
the fierceness of the struggle.
But see, they turn aná waver. One
more rush and we are through, driv-
ing them before us. The position is
WOn.
Breathing hard we look around at
the havoc we have wrought, and sud-
denly the glamour of victory seems to
fade and one loathes the whole sense-
BY THE STREAM.
(Featuring the Premier.)
MR. LLoyd GEORGE has returned
from a visit to the haunts of his youth
with renewed health and reinforced
Welsh accent. The last day of his
holiday was spent in fishing in the
company of two friends; but unfortu-
nately the newspapers failed to supply
any details of the scene, a lack of enter-
purpose, grimly awaiting the
moment when as one man
they will hurl themselves into
the fray.
Is it the mere lust for fight-
ing that has brought them
here? Or is it the thought
of the home that each hopes
to return to that steels their
courage and lends that élan
to their resolution without
which one enters the struggle
in vain 2
In the dim half-light I
furtively scan the set faces
around me and find myself
wondering what thoughts

ceal. Are they counting the

been through the ordeal be-

—small wonder when one
thinks of what lies before
them. Here and there a man
is puffing at his beloved “gas-
per” with the nonchalance
that marks yourbull-dog breed
when stern work is afoot.
Yet one cannot keep one's
thoughts from the tremen-
dous possibilities of the next
few minutes. Where shall
we be a few minutes hence 2
Some, one knows, will have
gone West—and the others?
Would they effect a lodge-

as, alas! had too often been
the case before ?

understand, especially on the
part of the journals known
to employ Rubicon experts
on their staff. Happily we
are able to give information
which we have reason to
believe will not be officially
contradicted.
From his childhood Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE has known
intimately the romantic
stream, named, for some un-
explained reason, the Dwyfor
river. To its musical mur-
mur may be traced the
mellifluous cadences of the
statesman's voice employed
so effectually in his appeals
to Labour and the Paris
Conference. Who can say
what influences this little
Welsh river, with its bubbling
merriment, the flashing force-
ful leap of its cascades, its
adroit avoidance of obstacles,
may have had upon the career
of the statesman of to-day,
as through the years it has
wound its way from the
springs to the ocean 2 The
senior fish of the Dwyfor are
well known to him, and they
gather fearlessly in largenum-
bers to smile at his bait and to
point it out to their friends.

posite bank of the river and
excitedly warned the party
that they were trespassing,
requesting them to retire.

intelligence could hardly have failed
to warn them of our intentions. The
position would be occupied, never fear,
and in force, with seasoned men from
the East.
At last a stunning roar that seems
to shake the very ground, rising to a
shriek. Now it is each man for him-
self. The long line surges forward,
looking eagerly for a breach. Now we
can see our opponents—hate in their
eyes—as they brace themselves for the
shock. Now we are into them, fighting
silently, with a sort of cold fury save
Their
less, savage business. We do not really
hate these men. After all, they are our
fellow-creatures.
But what would you? One cannot

ignored, and the trespassers replied to
his protests by singing “The Land

being easily distinguished above the
roar of a neighbouring cascade.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
INEVITABLY you will find a sad significance in the title of
Harvest (CoLLINs), the last story, I suppose, that we shall
have from the pen of Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD. It is a quite
simple tale, very simply told, and of worth less for its in-
herent drama than for the admirable picture it gives of rural
England in the last greatest days of the Great War. How
quick was the writer's sympathy with every phase of the
national ordeal is proved again by a score of vivid passages
in which the fortunes of her characters are dated by the
tremendous events that form their background. The story
itself is of two women in partnership on a Midland farm, one
of whom, the senior, has in her past certain secret episodes
which, as is the way of such things, return to find her out
and bring her happiness to ruin. The character of this
Janet is well and vigorously drawn, though there is perhaps
little in her personality as shown here to make understand-
able the passion of her past. All the details of life on the
land in the autumn of 1918 are given with a skill that
brings into the book not only the scent of the wheat-field
but the stress, emotional and economic, of those unforget-
table months. Because it is all so typically English one
may call it a true consummation of the work of one who
loved England well. In Mrs. WARD's death the world of
ungrudgingly at the service of her country. She leaves a
gap that it will be hard to fill.
In some ways I think that they will be fortunate who do
not read A Remedy Against Sin (HUTCHINsoN) till the
vicissitudes of book-life have deprived it of its pictorial
wrapper, because, though highly attractive as a drawing,
the very charmingly-clad minx of the illustration is hardly
a figure to increase one's sympathy with her as an injured
heroine. And of course it is precisely this sympathy that
Mr. W. B. MAXWELL is playing for—first, last and all the
time. His title and the puffs preliminary will doubtless
have given you the aim of the story, “to influence the public
mind on one of the most vital questions of the day,” the
injustice of our divorce laws. For this end Mr. MAxwell
has exercised all his ability on the picture of a foolish young
wife, chained to a lout who is shown passing swiftly from
worse to unbearable, and herself broken at last by the
ordeal of the witness-box in a “defended action.” Inevitably
such a book, a record of disillusion and increasing misery,
can hardly be cheerful; tales with a purpose seldom are.
But the poignant humanity of it will hold your sympathy
throughout. You may think that Mr. MAxwell, too obvi-
ously loads his dice, and be aware also that (like others of
its kind) the story suffers from over-concentration on a
single theme. It moves in a world of incompatibles. The

expense of divorce, and so on. To a great extent, however,
Mr. MAxwell's craft has enabled him to overcome even
these obstacles; his characters, though you may suspect
manipulation, remain true types of their rather tiresome
kind, and the result is a book that, though depressing,
refuses to be put down. But as a wedding-present—no'
The Underworld (JENRINs) describes life round about and
down below a small coal-mine in Scotland something near
thirty years ago. Its author, JAMES WELSH, tells. us in a
simple manly preface that he became a miner at the age
of twelve, and worked at every phase of coal-getting till
lately he was appointed check-weigher by his fellows, and
therefore writes of what he knows at first hand. Here
then is a straightforward tale with for hero a sensitive and
enthusiastic young miner who draws his inspiration from
Bob SMILLIE, loses his girl to the coal-owner's son and his
life in a rescue-party. The villain, double-dyed, is not the
coal-owner but his “gaffer,” who favours his men as to
has too often allowed an honest indignation to carry him
past his mark into the regions of burlesque, and in par-
ticular to confuse character with caricature. But as a
topical squib, briskly written, How They Did It will provide
plenty of angry amusement, with enough suggestion of
the roman à clef to keep the curious happy in fitting
originals to its many portraits. I should perhaps add that
the plot, such as it is, is held together by a rather per-
functory and intermittent love-affair, too obviously em-
ployed only to fill up time while the author is thinking
out some fresh exposure. This I regretted, as Mary, the
heroine, is here a shadow of what seems attractive and
original substance. I wonder that the author did not invent
for her a Ministry of Romance. He is quite capable of it.
Among the writers who have established stable reputa-
tions for themselves during the War “KLAxon" is in the
very front rank. This is partly due to an easy natural style,
but most to a sound judgment and an amazingly clear eye
for essentials. To those (not myself) who want to forget the
from their wives. The
chief surprise to the
reader will be the differ-
ence between the status
and power of the miner
then and now. The
writer has a consider-
able skill in composing
effective dialogue, es-
pecially between his
men; gives a convinc-
ing picture of the pit
and home life, the
anxieties, courage, affec-
tions and aspirations
of the friends of whom
he is “so proud.” Nor

and deserves to be read by many at the present time when
miners are so far from being victims of “the block”—the
employers' device for starving out a “difficult” man—that
they look like fitting the boot to another leg. One is made
to realise their anxiety to get rid of that boot.
How They Did It (METHUEN) may be regarded as a novel
with a purpose, and, like most such, suffers from the defects
of its good intentions. The object is “an exposure of war
muddling at home,” and it must be admitted that Mr.
GERALD O'DonovaN gives us no half-measure; indeed I
was left with the idea that greater moderation would have
made a better case. To illustrate it, he takes his hero,
David Grant, through a variety of experiences. Incapaci-
tated from active fighting through the loss of an arm, he is
given work as a housing officer on the Home Front. His en-
deavours to check the alleged extravagance and corruption of
this command led to his being “invalided out”; after which
he wanders round seeking civilian war-work (and marking
only dishonesty everywhere), and ends up with a post in
the huge, newly-formed and almost entirely farcical Minis-
try of Business. This final epithet puts in one word my
criticism of Mr. O'DonovaN's method. Everyone admits the
serve no other purpose,
they will, at any rate, do something towards differentiating
between the submarine and the U-boat.” By which it will be
seen that to his many other claims on our regard “KLAxon "
adds the gift, not always found among experts, of modesty.

Silver was the harness, crimson were the reins,
All hung about with little bells that swung on silken chains.

What pretty things I had to eat, what pretty things to drink;
And did you know that butterflies could sing like little birds?
And did you guess that fairy-talk is not a bit like words?

They really taught me how to fly, they gave me fairy wings;
And every night I listen for a tapping on the pane—
I want so very much to go to Fairyland again. R. F.

THE IDENTIFICATION of HoBBs.
OLD Hobbs, the gardener, has been in our family longer
than I have. Although we live within twenty miles of
London only once has he made the journey to the great
city, for that one memorable day so nearly ended in disaster
that he always speaks of it with a shudder. Indeed, but
for the arrival of Mrs. Hobbs, belated, flustered and inquir-
ing everywhere for her man, he must assuredly have spent
the night in a police-staticn.
This is how it all happened. Mrs. Hobbs was returning
from a visit to relations in Sussex, and her husband was
to meet her in London, convoy her across the city and
bring her home. In order to avail himself of a cheap fare
Hobbs left by the 7.30 train, though his wife would not
arrive till four o'clock in the afternoon. -
He managed to get across London somehow. After
locating the station at which Mrs. Hobbs was to arrive his
intention was to spend the day “looking round London
a bit; ” but the crowds and the traffic were too much for
the old countryman, so he sought safety by staying where
he was.
Time hung heavily after a while. He lingered round the
bookstall looking at the books and papers till a pert girl
behind the counter asked him if he wouldn't like a chair;
but when Hobbs, who was never rude and consequently
never suspected rudeness in other people, raised his hat
and said, “No, thank'ee, Miss, I be all right standing,”
even the pert girl was disarmed.
Next he amused himself counting the milk-churns on the
platform. Then he killed time by interesting himself in
the stacks of unattended luggage and examining the
labels; and at three o'clock a railway policeman laid a
hand on his shoulder and asked him what his game was.
Hobbs, a little startled but clear in conscience, told his
tale. -
“That don't do for me,” announced the constable. “I
been keeping observation on you since nine, and your wife
round the luggage and fingering parcels, and you'll just
come with me to the police-office as a suspected person
loitering. An old luggage-thief, I should say, to put it
quite plain.”
“Me a thief!” gasped Hobbs, roused to realities; “why,
I've worked ever since I was twelve, and me sixty-three
now ; I was never a thief, Sir. Look at me hands.”
The constable inspected them critically. “They're a bit
horny certainly; but then that may be only your dam
artfulness. Come on and talk to the Sergeant.”
The Railway Police-Sergeant briskly inquired his name,
address, occupation and all the rest of it. Hobbs gave a
good account of himself and mentioned that he had worked
in our family for forty-two years. - -
“Any visiting-cards, correspondence or other papers to
identify you?” asked the Sergeant mechanically. He had
said it so often to the people who cry “Season 1 Season 1"
when there is no Season. " - -
Hobbs confessed to having none of these things; and no,
he knew no one in London. º * I'
“Then you'll stay here till four,” pronounced the
Sergeant, “and we'll see if this good lady of yours comes
along.”
But, alas! no Mrs. Hobbs appeared.
missed the train,” suggested Hobbs des
the trap broke down or something.” -
There was only one more train, it seemed, and that
was not due until nine.
“Oh, I don't think my missus 'ud like to be so late as
that,” said the suspect. “She'd wait till the morning. I
don't reckon she'll come to-night.” -
“No more don't I.” The constable was beginning to
enjoy himself. “If I was you I should drop the bluff and
own I was fair caught. If you was to ask me, I should
say you didn't look like a married man at all. We'll see
what the Sergeant says now.” -
The Sergeant was accordingly consulted. He too was
rather sceptical. -
“If there's any truth in what you say you'd better wir
to this gentleman at Monk's Langford that you say you
work for, and try if we can identify you somehow,” he
advised. And to the constable, “Take him to the Telegraph
Office and let him send his wire. Then bring him back
here. Mind he don't give you the slip.”
So Hobbs, sighing deeply and perspiring freely, wrote
his message: “'Sir, they have got me in the police-station
here and say I am a suspected person, which you know I
never was, having worked for you, Sir, and your father for
forty-two years. But the Sargeant here says he wants
proofs, and you, Sir, must vouch for me as being respectable,
which you know. I am, and none of us was ever thieves.
So will you please do so, Sir, and oblige, as this leaves me
at present, George Hobbs.”
The clerk glanced at it. “It’s a long message,” he said:
“it’ll cost four or five shillings.”
Hobbs hadn't got that—no, really he hadn't.
The constable standing on guard, rather bored, inter-
posed, “We ain't asking you to write a book about it.”
“No, Sir, I couldn't do that,” replied Hobbs anxiously.
“What would you say, Sir, if you was me?”
“Don’t ask me,” answered the policeman. “It’s your
wire, not mine. Send something you can pay for. We
only wants to find out if you're the person you say you are.
Daresay you'd like me to write it for you, and you 'op it
while I done it. I seen your kind before. Try again, mate.”
So Hobbs tried again. And that is how it came about
that at tea-time a telegraph-boy brought me the bewildering
message: “Mr. Lockwood, The Nook, Monk's Langford.

BRIDGE NOTES.
(With acknowledgments to several con-
temporaries.)
IT would, I feel, be but fair to the
great Bridge-playing public to preface
these few notes with a word of warning
against the writers whom I find to my
regret affecting to speak with authority
on this subject in other periodicals.
Until, as in the kindred profession of
Medicine, it is impossible to practise
without a Bridge degree, nothing can
be done to prevent these quacks from
laying down the law. All I can do for
the present is to point out that there is
only one writer who can speak not
merely with authority, but with infalli-
bility, upon all matters pertaining to
our national game.
In this the eighth instalment of my
series on Auction etiquette, I should
like to urge once more upon the young
Bridge-player the importance of play-
ing quickly. And this because yet
in which much trouble might have
been avoided by doing so. In this case
A. took seven minutes to decide whether
to play the King or the Knave, which,
especially as the Queen had already
been played, was, I consider, far too
long. Y., the declarer, sitting on A.'s
left, certainly found it so, for towards the
end of the seventh minute he dropped
off to sleep and his cards fell forward
face upward on the table. Dummy
having gone away in search of liquid
refreshment, A. and his partner B. then
played out the hand as they liked and
then roused Y. to inform him that, in-
stead of making game, he had lost three
hundred above.
Now, A. and B. were strictly within
the rules of Auction Bridge in acting
as they did. There is no legal time
limit for players, as there is at cricket.
But it would have been more tactful
had they roused Y. at once, that he
might see what they were doing with
his cards.
comparatively rare incidents as this.
For instance, it is a mistake to confuse
Auction Bridge with Rugby football.
I have known players who declared
“Two No-trumps” in very much the
same manner as that in which a Rugby
football-player throws the opposing
three-quarter over the side-line. Exces-
sive aggression is a mistake. A young
Civil Servant of my acquaintance even
went so far as to abstain from claiming
an obvious revoke when the delinquent
was the chief of his department. Unfor-
tunately, however, this young man, so
wise in other ways, had the annoying
habit of turning his chair to bring him
luck. On one evening, when the run
of the cards was against him, he turned
his chair between every hand and so
annoyed his chief that no promotion
has ever come his way, and he now
spends his days bitterly regretting that
he did not claim that revoke.
Passing to another point, I am asked
by a correspondent if it is permissible

another case has come under my notice
occasionally to play from left to right,
Nor should tact be confined to such

instead of from right to left, just to
relieve the monotony. He asks, not
unreasonably, why, if this is not so,
writers on Bridge go to the trouble of
putting those little curved arrows to
show which way round the cards are
to be played.
For myself, I see no reason why the
right-to-left convention should not occa-
sionally be reversed, always provided
that the whole table agrees beforehand
to play in the same direction.
There are many other points to
which I should like to refer, and many
players to whom I should like to give
a word of warning. There is the player
who suddenly breaks off to join in the
conversation of other people who hap-
pen to be in the room. There is the
player who whistles to himself while
he is playing: this is a grave fault, nor
does the class of music whistled affect
the question; the Preislied performed
through the teeth is quite as exasper-
ating as K-K-Katie. Then there is the
player who breathes so hard with the
exertion of the game that he blows the
cards about the table. Finally there is
the player who slaps the face of his or
her partner. This is a mistake, how-
ever great the provocation. I have not
space now to deal exhaustively with
these breaches of Auction etiquette.
Besides, I have to keep something in
hand for future articles.
THE MADDING CROWD.
THE scene is an Irish Point-to-Point
meeting.
The course lies along a shallow valley,
bounded on the north by a wall of
cloudy blue mountains.
At each jump stands a group of
spectators; the difficulty or danger of
an obstacle may be measured by the
number of spectators who stand about
it, recounting tales of past accidents and
hoping cheerfully for the future. Motor
cars, side - cars, waggonettes, pony-
traps and ass-carts are drawn up any-
how round a clump of whitewashed
farm buildings in the background.
Blanketed hunters are having their
legs rubbed or being led up and down
by grooms. Comes a broken-winded
tootle on a coach-horn and the black-
and-scarlet drag of the local garrison
trundles into view. The unsophisticated
gun-horses in the lead shy violently at
the flapping canvas of an orange-stall
and swerve to the left into a roulette-
booth presided over by a vociferous
ancient in a tattered overcoat and blue
spectacles. The gamblers scatter like
flushed partridges and the ancient bites
the turf beneath his upturned board
amid a shower of silver coins. The

and the blood-curdling invocations and
wildly-waving arms and legs of the
fallen croupier, shy violently in the
opposite direction and disappear into
the refreshment-tent, whence issue the
crash of crockery and the shrieks of the
attendant Hebes. (Lieut.-Commander
KENWoRTHY should have some questions
to pop about this at Westminster when
next the Irish Question comes up.)
The bookmakers are perched a-top of
a grassy knoll which overlooks the
whole course, and around them surges
the crowd.

TELEPHONE TACTICS.
1T is now some months since the
great autumn offensive was conducted
with the idea of biting off an awkward
salient in my circumstances—in brief,
of obtaining the necessary telephone to
enable me to commence an ordered
existence. . For many, many days my
voice had been unheard crying in the
wilderness that I was a poordemobilised
soldier, that I had once had a telephone
and had given it up at my country's
call, and please couldn't they give me
back even my old, old telephone again?
I have already told how in response to
these very human appeals I at length
got only a request for the balance due
for calls for 1914. My old friend Time,
however, worked his proverbial wonders
and one day a telephone came—phit!
like that.
Directly it had come I suspected a
trap somewhere. Nor were my friends
behindhand in telling me of the horrors
of gigantic and inexorable bills from
which there was no appeal. They said
I must have a coin-box. Excellent
idea! I would have a coin-box.
So the great Spring offensive began.
In early February I opened a strong
barrage upon the main headquarters
(how lovingly these ancient military
metaphors come back to one!) and kept
up a little light harassing fire upon
the District Agent. The enemy replied
with rigid uniformity upon printed
forms—a mean advantage, for I have
to type mine myself. But matters
progressed. At the end of the first
fortnight I had been advised that the
work of installing my coin-box had
been entrusted to no fewer than three
groups of engineers, “to whom you
should refer in all cases.”
Well, I “referred ” for some little
time, and then, after a decent interval,
made their acquaintance separately.
If anything was calculated to bring
back memories of the lighter side of
the War it was the gracious and suave
manner in which I despatched and re-
despatched to other departments. I
might have been the buffest of buff
slips the way I was “passed to you,
please.”
Once again I cancelled all my work
in the pursuit of where the rainbow
ends. Nor was this renunciation any
great hardship, for I had been writing
a book about the Realities of War, and
had just found that all the horrors that
ever might have happened had already
been set down by one who saw most
of the game, being an onlooker. “But
this,” I said, as I set out every morn-
ing—“this is the life, pure adventure
in every moment of it.”

My efforts were rewarded. In late
mind like that.

OF UNDERGROUND TACTICS.
February three people came and left
three coin-boxes—in pieces. Then I
must admit that I did a foolish thing. I
wrote and said that I only wanted one
box. I was afraid that if I kept them
all it would be a case of “Thr-r-ree
pennies, please,” instead of one. (Mine
is a penny district).
It annoyed them all. They came
and took all the boxes away again—
jealousy, I suppose. So at the end of
February I was back in my old trenches
again and visitors were still saying,
“Oh, do you mind if I ring up So-and-
so 2" and I was listening to myself
answering, “Oh, do. No, of course don't
bother about the twopence” (visitors
always want calls just outside the
radius; I do myself).
The crisis came in March. It was
then that I joined the criminal classes.
For many days I had haunted the
telephone dump, taking a melancholy
pleasure in watching real engineers
come out with real coin-boxes for other
people. No Peri at the golden gate
ever looked more wistful. I know now
that it is opportunity that makes the
criminal, and one day the opportunity
came. It came in the form of a young
and evidently new hand, who emerged
from the dump and pitched upon me—
me of all people—to ask, “Can you tell
me where this place is?" As he spoke
address, and in that moment my fate
was sealed. One glance showed me
that he was the bearer of a perfectly
good coin-box, and in a second I had
seized the opportunity.
What he said I have not the slightest
idea and it wouldn't have mattered what
the address had been ; before he started
I had assured him that by a curious
coincidence I was going to that very
place, and that by a still more curious
coincidence I was the very man who
wanted that coin-box. Curious, wasn't
it, how such coincidences happened in
real life as well as in books?
I took him to my home in a taxi. On
the way I succeeded in diverting his
mind from any possible awkward ques-
tions by relating details of my sad
story until I could see the poor fellow
was on the verge of tears. For those
interested in criminology I may say
that all the best criminal devices are
not necessarily planned beforehand to
the end; they are begun any-old-how
and the genius consists in carrying the
thing through afterwards, much the
same as running a great war. I recked
not what might occur after I had nefari-
ously induced the poor innocent to in-
stall the machine; perhaps I had some
vague idea that the Englishman's house
is his castle, though this seems ridicul-
ous when considered calmly. How-
dissections? He came with me unsus-
pecting, and I piloted him out of the
taxi without his ever noticing the name
of the street even. How could I have
foreseen? Well, anyhow I didn't, or I
shouldn't have tipped him on the stairs.
With many nods and winks I gave
my wife the hint how I had managed
it, and we went about the house whis-
pering and hobnobbing in odd corners
like a couple of conspirators while he
began the work of installation.
Then the first dreadful moment came.
Suddenly he addressed me by my name,
with a certain suspicious interrogation
in his tone.
“Who?" I asked blandly, going as
red as a turkey-cock, of course; I never
can help it.
He looked surprised and I plunged
heavily, giving the first name I could
think of, which happened to be the one
he had mentioned in the taxi-his own,
in fact. He looked still more suspi-
cious and I knew it had been a mistake,
especially as close to where he had been
working were two envelopes addressed
to me. I am certain that if my wife
had not called me at that moment I
should have gone permanently purple
all over.
When I got back (I tried to get my
wife to go, but she said she would
rather I went, and that I wasn't reall

could see that it had dawned upon
him that I had wheedled him there
without his knowing exactly where he
was, and that he was determined not
to be had. He asked me to sign for the
installation.
Alas, I could not do that. It was
only then that I realised that I am
constitutionally honest; besides they
might find me out.
We both tried to turn his thoughts
to pleasanter topics. Perhaps asking
him to have a glass of port was a mis-
take; there are times when even bribery
is bad policy. Briefly, after a mumbled
remark that “there was something
fishy,” he refused to leave the box.
Dry-eyed we watched him take it all
down and depart in a dudgeon. We
were left with a vision of shameless
visitors with their twopenny calls and
interminable bills running up even while
we were away on our holidays.
Let us,” I said hoarsely—“let us go
and look at our child; she is all we
have left now.”
Moodily we turned to go upstairs.
In the hall we stopped dead. Upon
tieth-century caution had prevented me
from signing.
“He must,” said my wife with her
usual perspicacity, “have dropped it
on his way out. Let's see who the
box was really meant for.”
Picking it up I read aloud in cold
firm tones my own name and address.
The box had been meant for us after
all. ::: ::: ::: -k
We got it in the end. It came one
morning, like the flowers in Spring,
quite suddenly, and we spent a whole
day telephoning to our friends to tell
them we had a coin-box at last. I also
wrote a letter full of gratitude to the
telephone people and got the reply that,
“owing to the shortage of plant, etc.,"
they regretted that for the time being
they could not grant my request for a
telephone.
We did not tell them that we had
had one for three months; Heaven
knows what would have happened.

The Colonel (at the end of his vocabulary). “WHAT DID LoRD Fish ER say IN 1919?”
FROM THE DANCE WORLD.
(By our Ballet Expert.)
The Daily Graphic announces that
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT has “fallen a
willing victim to the latest fashionable
dances,” and is having lessons in them
“in the privacy of his Hanover Square
home.” A thousand entrancing possi-
bilities are opened up by this bald an-
nouncement. We are content to sup-
plement it by a few authentic details.
Mr. BENNETT, who does nothing by
halves, has mapped out a programme
which will occupy his energies for at
least two years. First comes the period
of pupilship, which will last for six
months. Then a year on the stage;
then six months devoted to the com-
position of three novels and three plays,
each with a Terpsichorean motive.
Already, while engaged on his daily
exercises, Mr. BENNETT has found time
to revise the titles of some of his earlier
works in keeping with his present aims,
and two of these have now been ap-
propriately rechristened Anna Pavlova
of the Five Towns and Helen of the
High Kick.
In the actual technique of his adopted
art Mr. BENNETT has already shown
extraordinary progress. The other day,
while a wedding party was just about
to leave St. George's, Hanover Square,
passing by, took a flying caracole clean
over the Rolls-Royce which contained
the happy pair. Those who witnessed
the feat say that it eclipsed NIJINSKY
in his most elastic mood. But Mr.
BENNETT is not satisfied, and declined
an invitation to appear at the Devon-
shire House Ball last week on the
ground that his achievement does not
yet square with his ambition. More-
over he has decided not to dance in
public under his real name, but is not
yet quite certain whether to choose the
artistic pseudonym of Ben Netsky or
Cinquecittà–probably the latter.
ºl. all he is firmly resolved to pre-
serve in his dancing the sympathetic
and humanistic tone of his presentation
of life in his books. It will be a mes-
sage of hope. He is determined by his
gestural artistry and resilient thistle-
downiness to “sanction and fortify the
natural human passion for believing
that life can somehow, behind all the
miseries and the mysteries, mean some-
thing profoundly worth while.” To
render justice to his mental and phy-
sical agility is beyond our powers.
We have been driven to culling this
memorable sentence from the latest
and most preternaturally precious of
his American admirers.
It is only fair to say that as a dancing
fictionist Mr. BENNETT will not be
way. Rumours are already afloat of
the appearance on the boards of Messrs.
CHESTERTON and BELLoc, under the
impressive aliases of Campoborgo and
Bellocchio, “the Terrible Tarantula-
tors.” This may be only a wild sur-
mise. There is however strong a priori
evidence in support of the statements
that Mr. MASEFIELD is taking lessons in
the Fox Trot at Boar's Hill, and that
Lord Northsquith is bringing back
with him from Morocco a powerful
troupe of Dancing Dervishes, with the
intention of installing them ultimately
in Downing Street. .

Government found it necessary to intern
people suspected of crime it was absurd
to let them out again be-
cause they threatened to
commit suicide. Several
Members, English as well
as Irish, thought that
there was a case for differ-
entiating between con-
victed prisoners and those
who were merely under
suspicion, and on the ad-
journment the Irish Attor-
ney-General a little re-
lieved the prevailing gloom
by a hint that some modi-
fication of the prison-rules

however, that recent experience has
convinced him that builders in general

properly be so described.
Mr. RENDALL's attempt to get the
House to pledge itself in advance to
the full policy of Lord BUCKMASTER's
Divorce Bill was defeated. The main
opposition came from Mr. RoNALD
McNEILL, who sits for Canterbury
and spoke with cathedral solemnity.
Mr. MUNRo supported the Resolution,
on the ground that English women
ought not to be refused the advan-
tages enjoyed by their Scotch sisters.

Lady AstoR, hailing from a land where
they are even greater, displayed no
desire to jump to conclusions, and asked
for an interval of five or ten years to
make up her mind.
If the cheers that greeted Mr. MAC-
PHERSoN were meant to console him
for his “Irishman's rise’’ in slipping
down from the Chief Secretaryship to
the Ministry of Pensions, they were
assuredly superfluous. The supposed

Only on Tuesday Mr. BoSAR LAw was
assuring the House that the Mountjoy
hunger-strikers must be left to commit
suicide if they chose ; the Government
could not release men suspected of
grave crimes. This afternoon he an-
nounced that sixty-six of them had in
fact been liberated on parole.
The new Minister of Labour (late
of the Admiralty) came on board again,
looking none the worse for his strenu-
ous exertions at Camberwell. He had
a hearty welcome from all quarters of
the House, which would hardly know
itself without its “Dr. MAC.”
It is one thing to gain a seat in the
House, but quite another thing to keep
it, as Sir W. JoyNsoN-HICKs has just
discovered. Returning from a prolonged
tour in foreign parts he found that his
favourite corner-seat had been annexed
by another Member. Determined to
reclaim it, he visited the House at
8 A.M. and inserted his card; but on
coming back to the House for prayers
found that the usurper had substituted
her own. Mr. T. P. O'Connor, with
old-world chivalry, considered that the
only lady-Member should be allowed
SPEAKER upheld the principle “first
come, first served.”
On a Vote of twenty-seven millions
for the expenses of the Ministry of
Munitions Mr. HoPE told a flattering
tale. The Department might be spend-
ing a lot of money, but it was making
a great deal more; and he anticipated
that the Disposals Board would hand
over to the Exchequer this year some-
thing like a hundred millions, if not
more. The Slough Depôt, he main-
tained, had been run at a profit and
sold at a profit. The Ministry might
have made some mistakes, but it repre-
sented a prodigious national effort, of
which the historian would speak with
amazement and praise.
Unimpressed by this panegyric Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN intimated that he
came to bury the Ministry and not to
praise it. In his view its administra-
tion had been grossly extravagant. He
demanded the full details of the Slough
transaction and suggested that the
Vote should be withdrawn until they
were forthcoming. To this proposal

Editor (to poet of somewhat dissolute habits who has been paid in advance for contributions which are not forthcoming). “I KNow
YoU ’RE GOING TO THE DEVIL As HARD As You can ; BUT You've Got To sING As You Go.”
THE LAND OF LOGIC.
LET me tell you about my National-
ist friend, Gabal Osman Effendi.
The circumstances of his brother's
death, which were as follows, drove him
into politics and made him a fervent
advocate of “Egypt for the Egyptians.”
His brother was in a very humble
way and lived in a little mud village.
There he had a friend, yet poorer than
himself, who only attained to prosper-
ity when a plague fell on the village.
The sanitary authorities put a cordon
around it to prevent the spread of the
plague, and hired this man among
others to throw disinfectants and things
into any drains that happened to exist.
Thus Osman Effendi's brother's friend
became a Government servant.
Now Osman Effendi's brother had a
sore leg. When he heard of his friend's
new work he thought he saw a way to
avoid any doctor's fees. So he went to
him and said, “I hear that you are now
a doctor.” His friend, proud but truth-
ful, said he was perhaps hardly that,
but he was certainly put to administer
drugs. Osman's brother pointed out
that his leg was sore and suggested that
it should be healed. The other looked
disinfectant. “This,” said he, “is a
powerful drug and, who knows? it may
cure your leg.” It was a friendly act;
but Osman's brother swallowed the
lump and shortly afterwards died.
Osman Effendi at once brought an
action for damages against the Govern-
ment, on the ground that its servant
had caused the death of his brother
(whom, as a matter of fact, he himself
had largely supported). The case was
heard by a Court on which sat two
Egyptian judges and one English, and
the decision went against Osman. This
convinced him of the injustice of the
English.
The Assize Court of Appeal, which
visited the district and heard Osman
Effendi's appeal against the first ver-
dict, consisted of three Egyptian judges.
It is true that the English judge who
should have gone on Assize had fallen
ill, and there was no other to take his
place. But Osman Effendi saw in this
too the malevolent hand of the English,
who nourished a grudge against him.
“How,” he said, “can I obtain justice
if there is no Englishman on the
Court 2"
From that moment he has become
an ultra-Nationalist, and has, I believe,
ing with the best of them the latest
“English" catchword of “Long Live
Egypt' Long Die MILNER 1 " '
He is, you see, an educated man.

AT THE PLAY.
“BIRDs of A FEATHER.”
IT is nearly always a good thing for
the author of a play to know what he
is after, and if he can get his audience
to follow him so much the better. It
is quite possible that Mr. ESMOND had
an idea in his head when he wrote Birds
of a Feather, but if so he never let me
get at it. Up to the very end I had no
conception of what he was trying to
illustrate, unless it was the trite theory
that we are the creatures of our en-
vironment. -
That, at any rate, was how Constance
(of “the House of Ussher") explained
her vagaries, though I couldn't see why.
The daughter of a very rich Jew, whose
Christian wife had run away from him,
she was brought up in great comfort,
As for Constance I have seldom met
a less seizable character. If she was
the result of environment there was no
visible sign to show how it infected her.
We simply had to take Mr. EsMond's
word for it. To me the ménage seemed
to be of the most respectable. But, of
course, you can always attribute any-
thing to your surroundings. One en-
vironment is vicious and so drives you
to vice; another is virtuous with the
same effect. Constance might condemn
hers, but it never had a chance with a
girl like that.
For myself it was not her viciousness
that worried me, it was her vulgarity;
and of this she seemed quite unconscious.
Her speech abounded in second-rate col-
loquialisms. Was it her environment
that taught her to say dreadful things
like “Put that in your pipe and smoke
(aunt) to verify her suspicions with
regard to the morals of Constance. But
I shall never get you to believe me when
I say that the subject was not so much
as touched again till the final Act.
I have spoken of the incongruous
stuff of which old Jacob Ussher's heart
was constructed. That strange organ
was hard enough to make him give his
daughter away to his secretary in the
matter of the forgery; but when it came
to a question of the exposure of her re-
lations with her lover this same heart
was found to be of the consistency of
putty.
I hope I shall not seem guilty of
Constance's indiscretion if I politely
wonder how it was that so astute a
judge as Miss MARIE LöHR accepted
this play. Actor-managers, of course,
have been known to produce indifferent
which included the love
of a peer's son, her
father's secretary. It
is true that her stern
parent would not hear
of their union; but that
has no doubt happened
to young heiresses be-
fore now without turn-
ing them into criminals.
With Constance how-
ever it seems to have
been different. She had
gathered from what she
knew of her father's
career that there must
be easy ways of making
money if you are not
too scrupulous, so she
forged his name for a
thousand pounds with
speculative intent. It
was open to the old
“You setTLE witH HIM,
CoMMITTEE.”
You 'RE chaiBMAN of THE ANTI-PRoPITEERING
work for the sake of a
good acting part for
themselves. If that
was her motive I think
she must have imagined
a fine subtlety in a
character which was
difficult only because it
was loosely conceived.
If she failed to make it
plausible it was not for
want of very adroit
handling.
In Jacob Ussher Mr.
ESMOND gave himself
a most congenial part,
in which he easily sur-
passed his achievement
as author. Mr. Tozer
as a slum-parson was
extremely probable
with his quiet sincerity.
But our chief consola-
man to regard this as an act of filial
piety, since it was an attempt, however
crude, to follow the parental tradition;
but apparently forgery had not been
one of his foibles and he threatened
her with the law unless she gave up
the idea of marrying the secretary, now
dismissed from his service.
Meanwhile she has been carrying on
a secret intrigue with that gentleman
(she must have got this from her
“Christian" mother), and when her
father comes to know of it he suddenly
exhibits an unsuspected gift of senti-
mentality (“My baby Con! my baby
Con!” he sobs), and, in terror lest his
ewe-lamb's name should be tainted by
the breath of scandal, he offers his late
secretary a heavy sum of money to
make an honest woman of her. It
sounds a little inconsistent, but of
course there may have been a nice
differentiation in the old rogue's mind
between a moral and a criminal offence,
it " " The cheap fun that she got out
of a girl-friend who had made it a rule
to pray for her was the kind of thing
you would be sorry to find in a common
boarding-school. And are gentlefolk
in the habit of asking a man, as Con-
stance did, how it was that he ever
came to get engaged to such a woman
as the one of his choice? In Bayswater
it simply isn't done.
At the end of the First Act, after
many trivialities and the waste of pre-
cious time over a description of certain
characters that were presently to appear
and endorse it, there was a sudden
diversion. The professional card of a
private detective was discovered in an
arm-chair. No one seemed to know
how it got there, and, as the curtain
chose this moment to fall, we were left
in a state of palpitation, wondering how
we were to get through the interval
with our curiosity unappeased. Ulti-
mately it turned out that the detective
tion came from Miss RACHEL DE Solla
as the maiden aunt, a reactionary type
of the most confirmed stolidity, with a
weakness for diamonds and indigestion.
Miss MARIE LöHR had many clever
things to say, but it didn't matter
what Miss DE SoLLA said; her manner
was irresistible.
I must doubt, however, whether the
excellent work of the actors will carry
the play to success. Even its title is
obscure. The only thing I know about
“birds of a feather” is that they are
supposed to “flock together”; and I
have always been given to understand
that the adage alludes to the mutual
attraction of similar types. Nobody
ever told me that it was meant to indi-
cate that the sins of the father bird are
liable to be reproduced in his chicken.

still none like her, none. Her perfect
technique remains the least of her
graces. The secret of her charm lies
deeper, in the power to interpret and
convey emotions in the language of her
art. To watch her feet alone is to hear
the shuddering sigh of her Dying Swan,
but her whole body is alert to translate
every nuance of her theme.
She can draw beauty even from an
anticlimax. Again and again in Snow-
flakes, when her partner withdrew the
support of his hand, she poised for a
moment, and, when the poise had to
cease, covered her descent with the most
fascinating gestures of head and arms.
I liked her least (if one may talk of
her like that) as the gipsy-girl in Amar-
illa ; not that she failed in dramatic
intensity but that jealous passion seems
alien to her temperament as we have
learned to know it. I think, however,
that my judgment was tainted by her
wig, which greatly distressed me.
In M. Vol.ININE she has a very ac-
complished partner. His solo as a
Pierrot, danced to a familiar air of
DvoršR's, was the most delightful of
“divertissements.” Her other dancers,
Russian and English, make up a really
excellent company. The presto furioso
of the wild gipsy dance in Amarilla,
to the exciting music of GLozou.Now
and DRIgo, was a brilliant tour de force.
My only complaint (apart from
Amarilla's wig) is that the programme's
explanation of the motive of Snow-
flakes was beyond me. “A little girl,”
it says, “receives as a present a nut-
cracker in the form of a doll. The doll
is in reality a Prince who has been
transformed by a bad fairy, but by an
act of devotion to the little girl he is
restored to life. He then leads his
little friend and other children to the
Kingdom of Pine - trees where the
Christmas-tree was born.” It is true
that the music was from Tschalkow-
ski's “Casse-Noisettes,” and that the
snow-scene was suggestive of Christ-
mas-time; but there was no sign of a
“nut-cracker in the form of a doll,” or,
if there was, I can't think how it es-
caped me, for I was watching with all
my eyes. O. S.

would have to spend most of the term

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPRING AT KEW.
I AM not one of those who believe in
going down to the country to look at
this Spring of which there is so much
talk. Wanting in business organisa-
tion and coherent effort, Spring in the
country is a poor affair at the best :
there may be half-a-dozen daffodils in
flower in one spinney, but you have to
tramp over two or three muddy fields
after that to find a button-hole of prim-
roses, and so onwards over a stile and a
ditch to the place where the blackthorn
has blossomed and the green wood-
pecker is pecking the greenwood tree.
And very likely there are gates.
Judging from statements in novels you
might suppose a gate to be a bright and
simple piece of mechanism, swung on
by rosy-cheeked children and easily
opened by Lord Hugo with his riding-
crop so that Lady Hermione may jog
through it on her practically priceless
bay. That is quite wrong. It rests on
the primary fallacy that gates are meant
to be opened, whereas they are really
meant to be kept shut. What actually
happens when you want to open one is
that you plunge halfway through a deep
quagmire, climb on to a slippery stone,
wrestle with a piece of hoop-iron, some
barbed wire and some pieces of furze,
lift the gate up by the bottom bar and
wade through the rest of the quagmire
carrying it on your shoulder.
If you are riding like Lord Hugo you
hook the fastening of the gate with the
handle of your crop and make your horse
shunt slowly backwards by applying the
reverse clutch with your feet. As the
gate refuses to give, you are, of course,
drawn gently over the animal's head
until you tumble into the bog like a
man whose punt-pole is stuck in the
bottom of the stream.
That is why I like going down to
Kew, where the Spring is tidy and con-
centrated, and there is a squared map,
just like France, at the turnstile gate to
direct you to the magnolia dump, and
little notices pointing you to the Tem-
perate Houses, though this is really un-
necessary, because there are no licensed
premises in the Gardens at Kew. All
is quiet and calm. You are not even
compelled to leave the gravel-walks
and tread on the damp grass, unless
you have a desire to go to the river's
edge and see how stiffly the tail of the
Duke of North UMBERLAND's stone lion
sticks out on the further bank between
the two peel towers from which his
crossbowmen contemplate the Surrey
marshes.
I used to know a man who had
mugged up all the trees and plants, so
that when you said to him, “What a
blue peach-blossoms on it,” he would re-
ply, “You mean the Pyrofoliata persica
corylus,” and explain how it was first
introduced into England by JEREMY
TAYLoR in 1658. Then when you went
up to look at the placard on the tree
you not only found that he was per-
fectly right, but obtained the additional
information that the wood was of a
particularly hard and durable nature,
and only used for making the heads of
croquet mallets and the seats on the
tops of motor omnibuses.
I like this plan of putting placards
upon trees, and I think it might well
be carried out in the country too. There
would be none of that standing about
in the wet then, and arguing whether
the thing is a beech or an oak, when
all the time it is a horse-chestnut and
laughing up its bark at you.
One must not forget either at Kew
the great conservatories, though I do
not care for these so much because
there are men in them watching to see
that you do not pick the cactuses or
the palms to put in your button-hole;
nor the magnificent Pagoda, which
accommodates the Observator, who
watches for the flowers to come out,
and the Curator, who writes apprecia-
tive little notices to stick on the beds;
nor the piebald swans in the artificial
lake.
. But the great glory of Kew is the
Pump-room. It is surrounded by mar-
ble-topped tables and green seats, and
I am awaro that it is not called a
Pump-room, though a noise proceeds
from inside it very like the panting of
a pump. They tell me that this is an
hydraulic machine for washing up the
cups and plates; but I do not believe
them, because so many people who take
tea round the Pump-room drink left-
handed, as if the reverse side of the
cup had belonged to somebody else.
Anyhow it is a very jolly and demo-
cratic assemblage that sits and drinks
tea under the trees and eats cakes that
have no placard on them to say at what
date they were introduced into England.
Here you may see the prosperous docker
with his wife and family sitting quite
unostentatiously at the next table to the
needy scientist who has come to make
notes about the purple narcissi. And a
little further on is the novelist who is
getting local colour for his great rustic
love-scene which he is going to say took
place in the heart of Devonshire.
But it was not for the purpose of pro-
viding you with tea and cakes that the
Pump-room was founded. Just as you
may read in your morning paper that
the Honourable Miss Muffet has pro-
ceeded to Harrogate to take the waters,
so it is with Kew. One goes to Kew to
out by exhaustive inquiries from one
of the waitresses that, though you may
substitute rolls and butter for bread and
margarine, and may have marmalade
with either or both, and though it is
optional to eat even the cakes with
yellow sugar upon them, there is no
way of evading the watercresses. There
is a strong feeling amongst the wait-
resses that it is just these compulsory
watercresses which have made us Eng-
lishmen what we are. The whole vast
pleasure-ground really centres round
them, and the reason why Londoners
flock (as the papers say) to Kew is that
they are hungry for the medicinal virtues
of this aquaceous plant.
After you have taken the watercresses
you are allowed to wander about the
Gardens again and look at QUEEN VIc-
ToBIA's cottage, round which there is
always an eager and admiring crowd
examining it from every point of view
and wondering what premium they
would have to pay for it if it were on
the market now. And then you will
want to go home and be unable to find
the gate; but after a little time the
Observator will observe you with his
telescope from the top of the Pagoda
and mention it to the Curator, who will
direct a bronzed and amiable man in a
blue uniform to lead you to the turnstile.
I am told that there are some people
who do not care to sample their Spring
at Kew or in the country either, but
prefer to go to San Remo or spend
Saturday afternoon toiling in their own
back-garden. Let them mind their peas,
I say, while I go down to Kew.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE title, somewhat puzzling at first, which Miss F. E.
MILLs YoUNG has given to her latest story, The Almonds
of Life (HopDER AND STOUGHToN), turns out to be based
upon a Chinese proverb to the effect that “almonds came to
those who have no teeth.” This rather devastating sample
of philosophy (which I have put by for use against the next
person who attempts to work off upon me the adage about
those who wait) forms the text of a well-told tale of mis-
placed affections. As you may expect, if you know Miss
YoUNG's former work, it is a South African story, not con-
cerned however with Boers and natives and the trackless
veld, but with coastwise civilization and suburban garden-
parties. As before, the author excellently conveys the
place-feeling, so well indeed that I was sorry when the love
intrigues of the two protagonists necessitated their quitting
Africa for a more conventional Italian setting. I may
summarise the plot by telling you that the particular
almond that fell too late to the heroine was somebody else's
husband. But it wasn't so much that she was unable to
eat him as that he proved indigestible when swallowed.
The lady was Gerda, young and dazzling bride of the
middle-aged Fred Wooten, and the gentleman one of her
husband's closest friends, also (before the arrival of Gerda)
person in the book. I need not further detail the crooked
course of untrue love, though I may hint at a fault in
balance, where your sympathy, previously and rightly en-
listed for poor betrayed Fred, is demanded for Gerda in her
difficulty with the almond. As usual, Miss YoUNG unfolds

year later his position was almost grotesquely difficult. Of

exasperating that anyone might have been excused if he

of Russia. “This great people are bound to recover, and
become all the stronger for their present trials,” are the
concluding words of his preface. That this prophecy may
come true must be the prayer of all of us who remember
what we owed to Russia during the earlier part of the War.
It was perhaps my misfortune that, not having read the
book in which Mr. EDGAR RICE BURRoughs recorded the
earlier adventures of his hero, John Carter, in the red
planet Mars, when that gentleman precipated himself
thither (from the banks of the Hudson, of all places), I
found myself in more senses than one out of my element.
Not that it really matters; since the Martian existence of
Mr. Carter was apparently of that wild and whirling
character, familiar to patrons of the Continuous Pro-
gramme, in which one thrill follows upon another so fast
that their precise order becomes of small moment. When
I tell you that the opening chapters of this remarkable
nightmare—The Gods of Mars (METHUEN)—contain mon-
sters with one white eye and mouths in their hands, flying
pirates, an air-ship that sinks down a volcano, an ageless
with a view to the gradual removal of troops without with-
drawal of entire units. It is hardly necessary to add that
the author is an old literary hand, with a pleasantly clear
and luminous style of his own, though one is free to
admit he splits his infinitives almost as much as Sir IAN
HAMILTON split his forces, and with less justification.
In the very improving books which I had to read long
ago the hero or heroine usually had a cross to bear. They
bore it with great fortitude, and frequently died young.
When therefore I opened Mr. JEROME. K. J.E.RoME's All
Roads Lead to Calvary (HUTCHINson) I fancied I knew
what to expect. I read that Joan Allway was possessed
of remarkable beauty, a “Stevensonian touch '' and suit-
able introductions to editors and newspaper proprietors, and
that from the pulpit of a column in the evening Press, with
her photograph at the top, she attempted to reform the
world. I don't know how the photograph came out, but
there was apparently no martyrdom so far. Afterwards
she began to encourage and inspire Robert Phillips, a Labour
M.P. and future Cabinet Minister, and at the same time to be
witch who—but why

present volume, it would perhaps not be unfair to add the
corollary that only those readers who appreciated the one
could swallow the other. Mercifully, Mr. BURRoughs
writes so continually at the top of his voice that after a
time the clatter comes to have an effect merely soporific.
Since Major-General Sir C. E. CALLwFLI, has, in The
Dardanelles (CoNSTABLE), added a volume to a series
called Campaigns and Their Lessons, it is clear that he is
writing mainly for military students, but none the less at
least one man in the street—meaning myself—has been
glad, after reading plenty of merely descriptive accounts of
the Gallipoli affair, to find a book that frankly and justifi-
ably does lay claim to technical proficiency. The exponents
of vivid narrative, modestly disclaiming expert knowledge,
have been painfully liable to break off just short of what
one wanted most to know. They told us how things
happened, or, at any rate, how it seemed they happened,
but the reason why of things they had to leave to others.
In this book we really do get at the why, and even more the
why not, of the magnificent failure. Of actual incident and
human interest General CALLwell's account, which in a
sense is only supplementary to the others, adds little to our
previous knowledge. The only point of the sort I picked
up is his notice of the characteristic reluctance shown by
path of self-denial in a moral anecdote of to-day ?
Running Wild (SIMPKIN) is the expressive title of a col-
lection of child-memories by the late Mr. BERTRAM SMITH,
whom readers of Punch will remember by the pseudonym
“Bis.” They can here learn from a sympathetic little intro-
duction by Mr. WARD MUIR under what conditions of a brave
but losing battle with ill-health this delicate and vivacious
work was written. When I say that these recollections
(which I decline to call by any word implying more arti-
fice) illustrate their author, I give you their measure for
honesty and charm combined. Honesty first of all; Mr.
SMITH's young barbarians running wild and, one conjec-
tures, rapidly reducing their elders to a like condition, have
the compelling effect of unsentimental truth. Few clouds of
glory, for example, trail about the protagonists of “A Day,”
a tribute to the joyous intoxication of a day-long orgie of
naughtiness deliberate and wholly unrepented. You will
find much in these pages to waken half-forgotten and per-
haps secret pleasures. Thus there was for me a personal
echo in the rejection as a seaside entertainment of castle-
building and the ordered sequence of the tides in favour of
the infinitely more variable delight of running water and a
sufficiency of mud. Perhaps I have said enough to suggest
the charm of an engaging volume, itself a memorial of one

Anzacs to report themselves as sick when urged to do so
whose kindly laughter will be missed by many.

O. S.
A TRYING DAY IN MEDIAEVAL TIMES.
THE public torturer hurried home in an irritable frame of
mind. The day had been for him one long round of annoy-
ances. When he commenced his duties that morning, already
exasperated by the thought that if the drought continued
the produce of his tiny patch of ground would be completely
ruined, he was aggrieved to find that far more than his fair
share of a recently arrived batch of heretics had been allotted
to him. During the midday break for refreshments his
dreamy assistant had allowed the furnace to go out, bring-
ing upon the torturer's own head a severe censure for the
consequent delay. In the afternoon, glancing occasionally
through the narrow window, he was mortified to see that
the promising rain-clouds, which might yet have saved his
cabbages, were dispersing; and then, to crown all, just as
he was finishing for the day he had caught hold of a pair
of pincers a trifle too near the white-hot end and seared
his hand.
As he approached the cottage which was enshrined in
his heart by a thousand sacred associations as home, the
torturer strove to rise superior to his worries. He whistled
bravely as he crossed the threshold and caressed his wife
with his usual tenderness. Intuitively she divined the bit-
terness of the mood which lay beneath the torturer's seeming
cheerfulness, but she stifled her curiosity like the wise little
woman she was and hastened to lay his supper before him.
Through the progress of the meal—prepared by her in the
way the torturer loved so well—she diverted him with her
lively prattle. And at length, when she trod on the dog and
caused it to give out a long-drawn howl, she made such a
neat allusion to the Chamber and heretics that the torturer
After the table was cleared the torturer's little blue-eyed
girl came toddling up to him for her usual half-hour's cuddle.
It made a beautiful picture—the little mite with her father's
merry eyes and her mother's rosebud mouth, sitting on the
torturer's knee, her golden hair mingling with his beard.
And how her silvery laugh brightened the place as she played
her favourite game of stretching her rag doll on a toy model
of a rack.
The sound of rain outside brought the torturer and his
wife to the door. As they stood side by side watching
the downpour the last vestige of the torturer's ill-humour
passed away. This rain would mean a record year for his
cabbages, and would do wonders for his beans, which
were already a long way more forward than those of the
executioner.
He realised now that he had allowed the mishaps of the
day to worry him unduly. After all, his hand had suffered
little more than a scorch and no longer pained him, and,
although the censure he had received in the Chamber and
the possible consequences had been very disquieting, yet
he was now able to assure himself and his wife that if
henceforth he kept his assistant from wool-gathering all
would be well.
Suddenly he fell back trembling from the threshold, his
face blanched with terror. A large rain-drop had splashed
on his forehead, reminding him abruptly that before coming
home that evening he had neglected to fill the water-drip-
ping apparatus, which might be required at dawn for the
more obstinate of the heretics.
TALL TALK.
The fact that the Bishop-Elect of PREToRIA, the Rev.
NEVILLE TALBOT, is no less than six feet six inches high,
surpassing his predecessor by two inches, has been freely
commented on in the Press. Anxious to ascertain from
leaders of public opinion the true significance of the appoint-
ment, Mr. Punch has been at pains to collect their views.
How divergent and even contradictory they are may be
gathered from the following selection:-
Sir MARTIN CONWAY, the Apostle of Altitude, as he has
been recently denominated, welcomed the appointment of
Bishop TALBOT as a good omen for the campaign which he
is so ably conducting. “Nothing,” he remarks, “has im-
pressed me so much in the works of TENNYsoN as the line,
“We needs must love the highest when we see it.' Mountain
or building or man, it is all the same. I never felt so
happy in all my travels in South America as when I was
in Patagonia, the home of tall men and the giant sloth.
At all costs we should recognise and cultivate the human
skyscraper.”
The Bishop of HEREFORD (Dr. HENSLEY HENsoN) expressed
the hope that the appointment of bishops would not be
governed solely by an anthropometric standard. It would
be a misfortune if the impression were created that prefer-
ment to the episcopal bench was confined to High Church.

The Editor of The Times declined to dogmatize on the
subject. He pointed out however that the average height
of the Yugo-Slavs exceeded that of the Welsh. The claims
of small nations could not, of course, be overlooked, but he
considered it as little short of a calamity when a Great
Power had an undersized Prime Minister. Short men liked
short cuts, but, as BACON said, the shortest way is com-
monly the foulest.

on Ecclesiastical Prosody. -
Colonel L. C. AMERY, M.P., strongly deprecated the
attempt to identify excessive height with extreme efficiency.
In the election to Fellowships at All Souls no height limit
was imposed. NAPOLEON and the late Lord Roberts were
both small men, and he believed that the remarkable elu-
siveness displayed by Colonel LAwRENCE in the War was
greatly facilitated by his diminutive stature. The testimony
of literature throughout the ages was almost unanimous in
its condemnation of giants. He had never heard of a small
ogre. On the subject of SHAKSPEARE's height he could not
speak with assurance, but KEATs was only just over five
feet. Jumbomania, or the worship of mammoth dimensions,
was a modern disease. Far better was the philosophy
crystallised in such immortal sayings as “Love me little,
love me long,” and “Infinite riches in a little room.”
Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY, M.P., observed that, man being an
imitative animal and bishops being regarded by many as
good examples, there seemed to him a serious danger of an
epidemic of what he might call Brobdingnagitis. Fortu-
nately the results would not be immediately apparent,
otherwise he would be compelled to raise his tariff for
cheap suits. A rise of six inches in the average height of
his customers would throw out all his calculations and
eat up the modest margin of profit which he now allowed
himself. -

too late, whilst the small properties
thus created find eager tenants amongst
those who cannot afford a new outfit
at all. . . -
Many tailors who have built new
suits are beginning to dispose of them
on three or five year repairing leases,
and possession of these may sometimes
be secured from the present occupiers
on payment of a substantial premium.
Gentlemen possessing both town and
country sets of suitings are in many
cases letting the latter in order to come
up to London for the season, whilst
others are resorting to various econo-
mical artifices to meet the crisis. Plus
four golf knickers, let down, make
admirable wedding trousers for a short
man, and many are the old college
blazers dyed black and doing duty as
natty pea-jackets.
In the City, of course, fustian and
corduroys are almost the only wear,
and there is much divergence of opinion
on the Stock Exchange as to the best
knot for spotted red neckerchiefs and
the proper way of tying the difficult
little bow beneath the knees.
In Parliament, where of course the
old costly fashions have long been out
of vogue, the change is equally notice-
able. Lord Robert CECIL, for instance,
habitually wears the white canvas suit
in which Mr. AUGUSTU's John painted
him ; Lord BIRRENHEAD mounts the
Woolsack in an old cassock, which, as
he points out, not only allows a very
scanty attire underneath it, but gives
him particular confidence in elucidating
St. Matthew; while the PRIME MINISTER
himself set off for San Remo in a sim-
ple set of striped sackcloth dittos.
Many Members are having their old
pre-war morning coats turned; Mr.
WINstoN CHURCHILL in machine-gun
overalls, Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY self-
dressed, Sir EDward CARson in a simple
union suit, are conspicuous figures, and
Mr. HoRATIo BottomLEY by a whim-
sical yet thrifty fancy often attends
the House in the humble attire of the
Weaver in A Midsummer Night's
Dream.
Even in the Welsh collieries it is
becoming the habit to go down the

[APRIL 28, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A VANISHED SPECIES.
THE great auk is but a memory;
the bittern booms more rarely in our
eastern marshes; and now they tell
me Brigadiers are extinct. Hand-
somest and liveliest of our indigenous
fauna, the bright beady eye, the flirt
of the trench coat-tail through the
undergrowth, the glint of red betwixt
the boughs, the sudden piercing pipe
—how well I knew them, how often I
have lain hidden in thickets and behind
hedgerows to study them more closely.
How inquisitive the creature was, yet
how seldom would it feed from the
hand. And now, it seems, they are
gone.
Wainly I rack my brains to envisage
the manner of their passing. Is there
to be nothing left but silence and a
shadow or a specimen in a dusty case of
glass preserved in creosol and stuffed
with lime? Or did not the Brig-
adiers rather, when they felt their last
hour was upon them, retire like the
elephants of the jungle to some distant
spot and shuffle off the mortal coil in
the midst of Salisbury Plain or (for so
I still picture it despite the ravages
of a rude commercialism) the vast
solitude of Slough 2
Or it may be that they underwent
some classic metamorphosis, translated
to a rainless paradise, where they
dreamed of battalions for ever inspected
and the general salute eternally blown.
“And there, they say, two bright and agéd
snakes
Who once were brigadiers of infantry
Bask in the sun.”
Anyhow, I cannot believe that ex-
Brigadiers die. They only fade away.
Fade away, I think, like the Cheshire
Cat in Alice in Wonderland, leaving at
the last not a grin but a scowl behind
them. “Brigadiers will fade away,” I
imagine, ran the instruction from the
Army Council, “passing the vanishing
point in the following order: —
(1) Spurs. (4) Brass hat.
(2) Field Boots. (5) Scowl.”
(3) Main body.
But oh, how they will be missed,
with their insatiable hunger for replies!
I remember one in particular, very fierce
and black-moustached, who used to pop
up suddenly from behind a Loamshire
hedge with an enormous note-book in
his hand and say to unhappy company
! commanders, “The situation is so-and-
so and so-and-so; now let me hear you
give your orders.” And the Company-
Commander, who would have liked to
read through Infantry Training once
or twice and then hold a sort of inter-
allied conference with his Platoon-
geant-Major in the chair, felt that after
frightfulness of this kind mere actual
war would probably be child's-play.
And yet they tell me he was a pleasant
enough fellow in the Mess, this Brig-
adier, and liked good cooking. Now
I come to think of it, he faded away
before the War came to an end. He
faded away into a Major-General.
How different from this sort was the
type that could always be placated by a
glittering bayonetcharge orathoroughly
smart salute I remember one of this
kind who came charging across the
landscape, his Staff-Captain at his heels,
to a point where he saw a friend of
mine apparently lost in meditation and
sloth. Unfortunately the great man's
horse betrayed him as he tried to jump
a low hedge, and, when he had clam-
bered up again and arrived in a rather
tumbled condition to ask indignantly
what had happened to the scouts,
“They have established a number of
hidden observation posts,” my friend
replied, keeping his presence of mind,
“and are making an exact report of
everything that transpires on the
enemy's front,” and he waved his arm
towards the scene of the catastrophe.
It was not thought necessary to ex-
amine their notes.
In France Brigadiers were mainly
divided into the sort that came round
the front line themselves, and the sort
that sent the Brigade major or somebody
else who had broken out into a frontal
inflammation to do it for them. It is
difficult to say which genus was the
more alarming.
The first was apt to exhibit its con-
tempt for danger by strolling about in
perilous places for five minutes and
leaving them to be shelled in conse-
quence for a week.
The second sort was apt to issue
orders depending for fulfilment on a
faulty map reference or a landmark
which had been carelessly removed by
an H.E. shell. One of the most intrans-
igeant of this kind whom I remember
could always, however, be softened by
souvenirs; a cast-off Uhlan's lance or
the rifle of a Bosch sniper went far to
console him for the barrenness of a
patrol report. I feel sure he must have
faded at Slough.
But it was in battle that their wild
appetite for information was most amaz-
ingly displayed. At moments when
nobody knew where anybody else was
or whether the ground underneath him
was likely to remain in that sector
more than a few moments or be de-
tached and transferred to another, they
would send by telephone or by a runner
wild messages for an exact résumé of
the situation. It was at such times, I
correspondents recently knighted would
have done yeoman service in the front
line. I can imagine them telephoning
Somewhat after this manner, in answer
to the querulous voice:—
“All hell has broken loose in front
of us. The earth shivers as if a volcano
is beneath our feet. The pock-marked
ridges in the distance are covered with
the advancing waves of field-grey forms.
Our boys are going up happily shouting
and singing to the battle. Sorry, I
didn't quite catch what you said about
being in touch on the right. The
brazen roar of the cannon is mingled
with the intermittent rattle of in-
numerable machine guns. Eh, what?
What 2 ''
Yes, I think the Brigadiers would
have liked that. But, alas, it could not
be. And now they have gone, with
their passion for questions, never to
return, or never till the next A.C.I.
cancels the last.
“And now no sacred staff shall break to
blossom,
No choral salutation lure to light,”
as Sw1NBURNE put it; or
“All the birds of the air fell a-sighin' and
a-sobbin'
When they heard of the death of poor Cock
Robin,”
as No. 1 platoon of A Company used
to sing. Ah, well. Evoe.

THE TAKING OF TIMOTHY.
TEA was over, a clearing was made
of the articles of more fragile virtue,
and Timothy, entering in state, was
off-loaded from his nurse's arms into
his mother's.
“Isn't he looking sweet to-day?”
said Suzanne. “It’s really time we
had him photographed.”
“Why?” I asked.
“Well, why do people as a rule get
photographed 2"
“That,” I said, “is a question I have
often asked myself, but without finding
a satisfactory answer. What do you
propose to do with the copies?”
“There are dozens of people who'll
be only too glad to have them. Aunt
Caroline, for instance—”
“Aunt Caroline one day took me
into her confidence and showed me
what she called her scrap-heap. It
was a big box full of photographs that
time, and she calculated that if she had
had them all framed, as their donors had
doubtless expected, it would have cost
her some hundreds of pounds. While
her back was turned I looked through
the collection. Your photograph was
there—and mine, Suzanne.”
“Anyhow, we shall want one to keep
ourselves. Think what a pleasure it will
be to him when he grows up to see
what he looked like as a tiny baby.”
I called to mind an ancestral album
belonging to my own family that I had
carefully kept guarded from Suzanne
precisely for the reason that it con-
tained various presentments of myself
at early ages in mirth-compelling gar-
ments and attitudes; but of course I
could not now urge that chamber of
horrors in opposition to her demand.
“Besides,” she went on, “we needn't
buy any copies at all if we don't like
them. Snapper and Klick are con-
tinually worrying me to have Baby
since the announcement of his birth
appeared, they've rung me up to ask
when he will give them a sitting.
Sometimes it's Snapper and sometimes
it's Klick; I don't know which is which,
but one of them has adenoids. We
can't do any harm by taking him there,
because they say in their circulars they
present two copies free and there's no
obligation to purchase any.”
“I wonder how they make that pay?”
“Oh,” said Suzanne, “they keep the
copyright, you know, and then when
he does anything famous they send it
round to the illustrated papers, which
pay them no end of money for permis-
sion to reproduce it.”
“But by the time he does anything
famous,” #. “won't this photo-
graph be a trifle out of date? Sup-
posing, for instance, in twenty or
thirty years' time he marries a Movie
Queen—”
Just then the telephone-bell rang,

and Suzanne, as is her wont, rushed to
taken. Once a week regularly, ever

arms on the way.
“Hello!” I heard her say. “Yes;
speaking. Yes, I was just going to
write. Yes; that will do quite well.
What? Yes, about eleven. Good-bye.”
“Not another appointment with the
dressmaker 2 " I inquired.
“No. Curiously enough it was Klick
again—or Snapper—and his adenoids
are worse than ever; I suppose it's the
damp weather gets into them. So I
said we'd take Baby to-morrow.”
“I don't quite see the connection,” I
said. “Besides, aren't they catching?”
“Now you're being funny again.
Save that up for to-morrow.”
“What do you mean?" I asked in
some alarm. “And why did you say
we'd take Baby?”
“Why, of course you've got to come
too. You can always make him laugh
better than anyone else; it's your
métier. And I do want his delicious
little dimples to come out.”
“Do I understand that I'm to go
through my répertoire in cold blood
and under the unsympathetic gaze of
Messrs. Snapper and Klick? Suzanne,
“Oh, nonsense! You've only got to
sing Pop Goes the Weasel in a falsetto
voice and make one of those comic
faces you do so well, and he'll gurgle
at once. Well, that's settled. We
start at half-past ten to-morrow.”
The coming ordeal so preyed upon
my mind that I spent a most restless
night, during which, so Suzanne after-
wards told me, I announced at frequent
intervals the popping of the weasel.
The day dawned with a steady drizzle
of rain, and, after a poor attempt at
breakfast, I scoured the neighbourhood
for a taxi. Having at last run one to
earth, I packed the expedition into it—
Suzanne, Timothy, Timothy's nurse
and Barbara (who begged so hard to
be allowed to “come and see Father
make faces at Baby” that Suzanne
weakly consented).
Arrived at our destination, Suzanne
bade the driver wait. “We shall never
find another cab to take us home in
this downpour,” she said, “and we
shan't be kept long.”
We were ushered into the studio by
a gentleman I now know to have been
Mr. Klick. He aroused my distrust at
velvet coat, and I pointed out this artis-
tic deficiency in a whisper to Suzanne.
“Never mind,” she whispered back;
“we needn't buy any if they're not
good.”
Timothy, who had by now been put
straight by his attendant, was carefully
placed on all-fours on a pile of cushions,
which he promptly proceeded to chew.
Mr. Klick, on attempting to correct the
pose, was received with a hymn of hate
that compelled him to bury his head
hastily in the camera-cloth, and Suz-
anne arranged the subject so that some
of his more recognisable features be-
came visible.
“Now then,” she said to me, “make
him smile.”
With a furtive glance at Mr. Klick,
who fortunately was still playing the
ostrich, I essayed a well-tried “face"
that had almost invariably evoked a
chuckle from Timothy, even when
visitors were present. On this occasion,
however, it failed to produce anything
more than a woebegone puckerthat fore-
shadowed something worse. Hastily

interest in these proceedings; “try

Mr. Klick had emerged from cover
and was standing expectantly with his
hand on the cap.
Dear reader, have you ever been
called upon to sing Pop Goes the Weasel
in a falsetto voice before a fractious
baby, a small but intensely critical
child, a stolidly contemptuous nurse, an
agitated mother and a gaping photo-
grapher, with the knowledge that suc-
cess or failure hangs upon your lips,
and that all the time a diabolical ma-
chine in the street below is scoring
threepence against you every minute or
so 2 Of course you haven't ; but pos-
sibly you may be able to enter into my
feelings in this hour of trial. With a
prickly heat suffusing my whole body
and a melting sensation at the collar I
struggled through the wretched lyric
once. Timothy regarded me first with
scorn and then with positive distaste.
In desperation I squeaked it out again
and yet again, but each succeeding
“pop” only registered another scowl
on the face of my offspring and another
threepence on that of the cabman's
clock.
I was maddened now, and Suzanne
sought to restrain me; but I shook her
off violently and went on again da capo,
and was just giving vent for about the
seventeenth time to a particularly ex-
cruciating “pop” when the door of the
studio opened and a benevolent-looking
old gentleman entered. He gazed at
us all in wonderment, and, overcome by
mingled shame and exhaustion, I sank
into a chair and popped no more.
“Ah, Mr. Snapper,” said Mr. Klick,
“we were just trying to get this young
gentleman amused.”
Mr. Snapper, who, I should imagine,
was the adenoid victim, looked first at
me and next at Timothy, and then blew
his nose vigorously. It was not an
ordinary blast, but had a peculiarly
musical timbre, very much like the note
of a mouth-organ. It certainly attracted
Timothy's attention, for he at once

stood what was required of him and blew
his nose again and again. And with each
blow Timothy's smile became wider,

ing out plates for all he was worth. At
last Mr. Snapper could blow no more,

in payment.
The photographs have turned out a
great success. One in particular, which
shows the first smile breaking through
Timothy's tears, is of a very happy
character, and Mr. Snapper has asked
and received permission to send it to
the illustrated Press under the title,
“Sunshine and Shower”; and Aunt
Caroline has not only been given a
copy, but has had it framed.
Now, when I am called upon to pro-
duce a laugh from Timothy, I no longer
make faces or “pop.” I have discovered
how to blow my nose like a mouth-
organ. It's trying work, but the effect

Is a portent “conspicuous even to-day,”
For, though she was freely condemned and abhorred,
She was never suppressed and she can't be ignored.
Her parents, most anxious to give a good time
To their children, if only they helped them to climb,
Unconsciously aiding the new Self-Expression
Left all from the start to their daughter's discretion.
No nurse was allowed to rebuke her or warn her,
No governess put her to stand in a corner;
At six she revealed a peculiar joy
In the taste of old brandy, and dressed like a boy;
At eight she had read CAsanova, CELLINI,
And driven a toasting-fork into a tweeny;
At ten she indited and published a story
Described by The Leadenhall News as “too gory.”
One governess after another was tried,
But none of them stopped and one suddenly died.
Then she went for a while to a wonderful school
Which was run on the plan of the late Mrs. Boole;
But no “ethical safeguards" could ever restrain
And a fire, for the kindling of which she was held
Responsible, led to her being expelled.
On the strength of her fine pyromaniac rage
For a season or two she appeared on the stage;
Her dancing was crude and her voice was a blank,
But she carried it off by superlative swank,
And married a swarthy and elderly milli-

A militant during the Suffrage campaign,
In the War she adopted the cause of Sinn Fein,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 19th.-Primrose-day
in the House of Commons was more
honoured in the breach than the ob-
servance. Barely a dozen Members
sported Lord BEACONFIELD's favourite
flower (for salads), and one of them
found himself so uncomfortably con-
spicuous that shortly after the proceed-
ings opened he furtively transferred his
buttonhole to his coat-pocket. Among
those who remained faithful were Lord
LAMBourne (in the Peers' Gallery), who
had for this occasion substituted a posy
of primroses for his usual picotee, and,
quaintly enough, Mr. Hogg|E, who had
not hitherto been suspected of Dis-
raelian sympathies.
For a Budget-day the attendance
was smaller than usual. But it was
large enough to prevent Mr. BILLING
from securing his usual seat. The
SPEAKER, however, did not smile upon
his suggestion that he should occupy
one of the vacant places on the Front
Opposition Bench, and curtly informed
him that there was plenty of room in
the Gallery. Thither Mr. BILLING be-
took himself, and thence he addressed a
question which Mr. HoPE, the Minister
concerned, was unable to catch, his
ears not being attuned to sounds from
that altitude.
Otherwise Question-time was chiefly
remarkable for the loud and continued
burst of cheering from the Coalition
benches which greeted Mr. WILL
THORNE's suggestion (d. propos of
| LENIN's industrial conscription) that
“it would be a very good thing to
make all the idlers in this country
work.” Mr. THoRNE seemed quite em-
barrassed by the popularity of his pro-
posal, which did not, however, appear
to arouse the same enthusiasm among
his colleagues of the Labour Party.
It was four o'clock when Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN rose to “open the Budget"
(he clings to that old-fashioned phrase),
and just after six when he completed a
speech which Mr. Asquith (himself an
ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer) justly
praised for its lucidity and comprehen-
siveness,
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN could not on this
occasion congratulate himself (as his
predecessors were wont to do) on the
accuracy of his forecasts.
shots last year, in Spring and Autumn,
but both times was many millions out
in his calculations. Fortunately all the
mistakes were on the right side, and he
came out with a surplus of one hundred
and sixty-four millions (about as much
as the whole revenue of the country
when first he went to the Exchequer)
to devote to the redemption of debt.
an hour by the clock he piled up the
burdens on the taxpayer. His argu-
ments were not always consistent. It
is not quite easy to see why, because
convinced himself that the Excess Pro-
fits Tax, which last year he described
as a great deterrent to enterprise and
industry, only justifiable as “a tem-
porary measure,” should now be not
merely continued but increased by fifty
per cent.
This proposal seemed to excite more
hostility than any other. But the
= |single taxers were annoyed by the final
disappearance of the Land Values Duties
(the only original feature of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's epoch-making first Budget).
Mr. RAFFAN pictured their author being
/ |dragged at the Tory chariot-wheels, and
/ | Dr. MURRAY observed that the land-
// | taxes were evidently not allowed “on

claret.”
Nor is it easy to follow the process
A, the other side of the Rubicon.”
The general view was that the Gov-
ernment had shown courage in impos-
ing fresh taxation, but would have saved
themselves and the country a great deal
of trouble if they had been equally bold
in reducing expenditure.
Tuesday, April 20th.-When a local
band at Cologne recently played the
“Wacht am Rhein" the British officers
present stood up, on the ground (as
they explained to a surprised German)
that they were now the Watch on the
Rhine. But are they? According to
Colonel BURN the Army of the Rhine
is now so short of men that it is com-
pelled to employ German civilians as
batmen, clerks and even telephone-
operators; and Mr. CHURCHILL was
fain to admit that it would not sur-
prise him to hear that “some assist-
ance has been derived from the local
population.”
The Carnarvonshire police are peeved
because they are not allowed to belong
- . to any secret society except the Free-
masons, and consequently are debarred
from membership of the Royal Ante-
diluvian Order of Buffaloes. Mr. SHORTT
disclaimed responsibility, but it is ex-
pected that the Member for the Car-
narvon Boroughs, who is notoriously
sympathetic to Ante-diluvians (is not
his motto Après moi le déluge 2), will
take up the matter on his return from
San Remo.
Having had time to consider the
Budget proposals in detail Mr. Asquith
was less complimentary and more crit-
ical. Good-humoured chaff of the PRIME
MINISTER on the demise of the Land
Values Duties before they had yielded
the “rare and refreshing fruits.” pro-
mised ten years ago, was followed by a
reasoned condemnation of the proposed
increase in the wine duties, which he
believed would diminish consumption
and cause international complications
with our Allies. The CHANCELLOR,
again, had thought too much of re-
venue and too little of economy. He

metaphors—to cut away those parasitic
excrescences upon the normal adminis-
trative system of the country which
now constituted an open tap.
Wednesday, April 21st.—The aboli-
tion of the Guide - lecturer at Kew
Gardens was deplored by Lord SUDE-
LEY and other Peers. But as, ac-
cording to Lord LEE, out of a million
visitors last year only five hundred
listened to the Guide—an average of
less than three per lecture—the Govern-
ment can hardly be blamed for saving a
hundred pounds. Retrenchment, after
all, must begin somewhere.
Sir DoNALD MACLEAN cannot have
heard of this signal example of
Government economy or he would
not have denounced Ministers so
vehemently for their extrava-
gance. His most specific charge
was that in Mesopotamia they
were “spending money like water
in looking for oil.”
In a further defence of the Bud-
get proposals Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
disclaimed the notion that it was
the duty of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer to denounce in the
House the Estimates which he
had approved in Cabinet. His
business was to find the money.
Circumstances had altered his
attitude to the Excess Profits
Duty, and he was now determined
to stick to it. Did not a cynic
once say that nothing succeeds
like excess?
Mr. BARNEs, who was loudly º
cheered on his return to the House, \
joined in the cry for economy.
“Some departments,” he declared,
“existed only because they had
existed.”
The country clergy are without
doubt the most over-rated per-
sons in the country—I mean, of
course, from a fiscal point of
view. Consequently the House gave a
friendly reception to a Bill intended to
relieve them of some of their pecuniary
burdens.
Thursday, April 22nd.—When Dr.
MACNAMARA was Secretary to the Ad-
miralty no Minister was clearer or more
direct in his answers. Now that he
has become Minister he has laid aside
his quarter-deck manner and adopted
tones of whispering humbleness which
hardly reach the Press Gallery.
He ought to take example from Mr.
STANTON, who never leaves the House
in doubt as to what he means. This
afternoon his purpose was to announce
that a certain “Trio” on the Opposition
Benches was in league with the forces
of disorder. “Bolshies ' " he shouted
in a voice that frightened the pigeons
Later in the evening Mr. STANToN
indicated that unless the salaries of
Members of Parliament were raised he
should have seriously to consider the
question of returning to his old trade
of a coal-hewer, at which I gathered
he could make much more money with
an infinitely smaller exertion of lung-
power.
The vote for Agriculture and Fisheries
was supported by Sir A. GRIFFITH-
Boscawen in a speech crammed full
of miscellaneous information. We
learned that the Minister once smoked
a pipe of Irish tobacco, and said
“Never Again"; that the slipper-lim-

pet, formerly the terror of the oyster-
beds, had now by the ingenuity of his
Department been transformed into a
valuable source of poultry-food, and
that the roundabout process by which
the Germans in bygone days imported
eel-fry from the Severn for their own
rivers, and then exported the full-grown
fish for the delectation of East-end
dinner-tables, had been done away with.
In the matter of eels this country is now
self-supporting.
“The stock markets showed a good deal of
uncertainty this morning, and dealers marked
prices lower in many cases to protect them-
selves against possible sales on the Budget
proposals, particularly the excess profits duty
and the corruption tax.”—Provincial Paper.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN omitted to mention
the last-named impost, but no doubt
LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.
“THE BEAR-GARDEN.”
THE authors of the guide-books have
signally failed to discover the really
interesting parts of Law-land. I have
looked through several of these works
and not one of them refers, for example,
to the “Bear-Garden,” which is the
place where the preliminary skirmishes
of litigation are carried out. The Bear
Garden is the name given to it by the
legal profession, so I am quite in order
in using the title. In fact, if you want
to get to it, you have to use that title.
The proper title would be something
like “the place where Masters in
Chambers function at half-past
one;” but, if you go into the Law
Courts and ask one of the attend-
ants where that is, he will say,
rather pityingly, “Do you mean
the Bear-Garden?” and you will
know at once that you have lost
caste. Caste is a thing you should
be very careful of in these days,
so the best thing is to ask for the
Bear-Garden straightaway.
It is in the purlieus of the Law
Courts and very hard to find. It
is up a lot of very dingy back-
staircases and down a lot of very
dingy passages. The Law Courts
are like all our public buildings.
The parts where the public is
allowed to go are fairly respect-
able, if not beautiful, but the pur-
lieus and the basements and the
upper floors are scenes of un-
imaginable dinginess and decay.
The Law Courts' purlieus are
worse than the Houses of Parlia-
ment's purlieus, and it seemstome
that even more disgraceful things
are done in them. It only shows
you the danger of Nationalisation.
On the way to the Bear-Garden
you pass the King's Remembran-
cer's rooms. This is the man who reminds
His MAJESTY about people's birthdays;
and in a large family like that he must
be kept busy. Not far from the King's
Remembrancer there is a Commissioner
for Oaths; you can go into his room
and have a really good swear for about
half-a-crown. This is cheaper than
having it in the street—that is, if you
are a gentleman; for by the Profane
Oaths Act, 1745, swearing and cursing
are punishable by a fine of one shilling
for every day-labourer, soldier or sea-
man; two shillings for every other per-
son under the degree of a gentleman;
and five shillings for every person of or
above the degree of a gentleman. This
is not generally known. The Commis:
sioner for Oaths is a very broad-minded
man, and there is literally no limit to

what you may swear before him. The
that was his artfulness.

only thing is that he insists on your
filing it before you actually say it. This
may cause delay; so that if you are
feeling particularly strongly about any-
thing it is probably better to have it
out in the street and risk being taken
for a gentleman.
There are a number of other interest-
ing functionaries on the way to the
Bear-Garden; but we must get on.
When you have wandered about in the
purlieus for a long time you will hear
a tremendous noise, a sort of combined
snarling and roaring and legal conver-
sation. When you hear that, you will
know that you are very near the bears.
They are all snarling and roaring in a
large preliminary arena, where the bears
prepare themselves for the struggle; all
round it are smaller cages or arenae,
where the struggles take place. If
possible you ought to go early, so that
you can watch the animals massing.
Lawyers, as I have had occasion to
observe before, are the most long-
suffering profession in the country, and
the things they do in the Bear-Garden
they have to do in the luncheon-hour,
or rather in the luncheon half-hour,
This accounts perhaps for the ex-
treme frenzy of the proceedings. They
hurry in a frenzy up the back-stairs
about 1.25, and they pace up and down
in a frenzy till half-past one. There
are all sorts of bears, most of them
rather seedy old bears, with shaggy and
unkempt coats. These are solicitors'
clerks, and they all come straight out
of DICKENs. They have shiny little
private-school handbags, each inherited,
no doubt, through a long line of ances-
tral solicitors' clerks; and they all have
the draggled sort of moustache that
tells you when it is going to rain.
While they are pacing up and down
the arena they all try to get rid of these
moustaches by pulling violently at
alternate ends; but the only result is
to make it look more like rain than
ever.
Some of the bears are robust old
bears, with well-kept coats and loud
roars; these are solicitors' clerks too,
only better fed; or else they are real
solicitors. And a few of the bears are
perky young creatures—in barrister's
robes, either for the first time, when
they look very self-conscious, or for the
confident. All the bears are telling
each other about their cases. They
are saying, “We are a deceased wife's
sister suing in forma pauperis,” or “I
am a discharged bankrupt, three times
convicted of perjury, but I am claim-
ing damages under the Diseases of Pigs
Act, 1862,” or “You are the crew of a
merchant-ship and we are the editor
of a newspaper.” Just at first it is
rather disturbing to hear snatches of
conversation like that, but there is no
real cause for alarm ; they are only
identifying themselves with the in-
terests of their clients; and, when one
realises that, one is rather touched.
At long last one of the keepers at
the entrance to the small cages begins
to shout very loudly. It is not at all
clear what he is shouting, but appar-
ently it is the pet-names of the bears,
for there is a wild rush for the various
cages. Across the middle of the cage
a stout barricade has been erected, and
behind the barricade sits the Master,
pale but defiant. Masters in Chambers
are barristers who have not got proper
legal faces, and have had to give up

of the Bear-Garden nobody notices that
their faces are all wrong. The two
chief bears rush at the Master and the
other bears jostle round them, egging
them on. When they see that they
cannot get at the Master they begin
snarling. One of them snarls quietly
out of a long document about the State-
ment of Claim. He throws a copy of
this at the Master, and the Master tries
to get the hang of it while the bear is
snarling; but the other bear is by now
beside himself with rage, and he begins
putting in what are called interlocu-
tory snarls, so that the Master gets
terribly confused, though he doesn't
let on.
By-and-by all pretence of for-
mality and order is put aside and
the battle really begins. At this
stage of the proceedings the rule is
that no fewer than two of the pro-
tagonists must be roaring at the
same time, of which one must be
the Master. But the more general
practice is for all three of them to
roar at the same time. Sometimes,
it is true, by sheer roar-power the
Master succeeds in silencing one
of the bears for a moment, but he
can never be said to succeed in
cowing a bear. If anybody is
cowed it is the Master. Mean-
while the lesser bears press closer
and closer, pulling at the damp
ends of their rainy moustaches
and making whispered suggestions
for new devilries in the ears of the
chief bears, who nod their heads
emphatically but don't pay any
attention. -
The final stage is the stage of
physical violence, when the chief
bears lean over the barricade and
shake their paws at the Master;
they think they are only making
legal gestures, but the Master
knows very well that they are get-
ting out of hand; he knows then
that it is time he threw them a bun. So
he says a soothing word to each of them
and runs his pen savagely through almost
everything on their papers. The bears
growl in stupefaction and rage, and
take deep breaths to begin again. But
meanwhile the keeper has shouted for
a fresh set of bears, who surge wildly
into the room. The old bears are swept
aside and creep out, grunting. What the
result of it all is I don't know. Nobody
knows. But the new bears

“MARY ROSE.” -
Of course nobody could possibly sus-
pect Sir JAMES BARRIE of plagiarising
(save from himself), yet it will explain
something of the atmosphere of Mary
Rose if I say that it is a story with
such a theme as that admirable ghost-
monger, the Provost of Eton, would
whole - heartedly approve — thrilling,
sinister, inconclusive — with (shall I
say?) just a dash of Sir ARTHUR ConAN
Doyle in his other-worldly mood to
bring it well into the movement. Natur-
ally the variations are sheer BARRIE
and of the most adroit.

Mary Itose is in fact a girl who
couldn't grow up, because whenever
she visited a little mystery island in the
Outer Hebrides “they "who lived in a
“lovely, lovely, lovely" vague world
beyond these voices would call her
vaguely (to Mr. NorMAN O'NEILL's
charming music), and she would as
vaguely return with no memory of
what had passed and no change in her
physical condition. This didn't matter
so much when, as a mere child, she
disappeared for thirty days; but when,
mother of an incomparable heir of two,
she was rapt away in the middle of a
picnic for twenty-five years, and re-
turned to find a husband, mother and
father inexplicably old and changed, and
dreadfully silent about her babe—well,

I don't think it fair to tell you any
more. You shouldn't suffer these thrills
at second-hand. Dut I can say that,
in spite of making it a point of profes-
sional honour to try to keep a warm
spine and check the unbidden tear from
trickling down my nose (which makes
you look such an ass before a cynical
colleague during the intervais), I was
beaten in both attempts. The “effects”
were astonishingly well contrived by
both author and producer (Mr. Holy(AN
CLARK). You were not let down at the
supreme moment by a hurried shuffle
of dimly seen forms or the click
of an electrician's gear suggesting
too solid flesh. The house was in
a queer way stunned by the poig-
nancy of the last scene between the
young ghost-mother and the long-
sought unrecognised son, and had
to shake itself before it could re-
ward with due applause the fine
playing of as perfect a cast as I
have seen for a long time. There's
no manner of doubt that Sir JAMEs
“got it over” (as they say) all right.
Miss FAY CoMPTON makes aston-
ishing strides. Her Mary Rose,
had adorable shy movements
caresses, intonations, wistfulnesses.
These were traits of Mary Rose,
not tricks of Miss CoMPTON. And
they escaped monotony—supreme
achievement in the difficult cir-
cumstances. Mr. ROBERT LoraINE
in the doubled rôles of Mary Rose's
husband and son, showed a very
fine skill in his differentiation of
the husband's character in three
phases of time and development,
and of the son's, with its family
likeness and individual variation.
Mr. ERNEST THESIGER, who seems
to touch nothing he does not adorn,
gave a fine rendering of as charm-
ing a character as ever came out of the
BARRIE box—the superstitious, learned,
courteous croſter's son, student of Aber-
deen University, temporary boatman
and (later) minister. He did his best
incidentally, by rowing away without
casting off, to corroborate the local
legend that the queer little island some-
times disappeared. Miss MARY JERRoLD
was just the perfect BARRIE mother
(of Mary Rose). Mr. ARTHUR WHITBY's
parson, Mr. NorMAN FoRBEs' squire,
Miss JEAN CADELL's housekeeper, left
no chinks in their armour for a critic's
spleenful arrow.

Epicurean. “AH, You LITTLE REALISE. How THESE APRIL show ERs BRING ON THE PEAs.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE a mild grievance against that talented lady, Miss
MARJoRIE Bow EN, for labelling her latest novel “a romantic
fantasy.” Because, like all her other stories, The Cheats
(CoLLINs) moves with such an air of truth, its personages
are so human, that I could delightfully persuade myself
that it was all true, and that I had really shared, with a
sometimes quickened pulse, the strange fortunes of the
sombre young hero. But—fantasy! That is to show the
strings and give away the whole game. However, if you
can forget that, the coils of an admirably woven intrigue
will grip your attention and sympathy throughout. The
central figure is one Jaques, who comes to town as a
penniless and love-lorn romantic, to be confronted with the
revelation that he is himself the eldest son, unacknowledged
but legitimate, of His Majesty KING CHARLEs THE SEcond,
then holding Court at Whitehall. It is from the plots and
counter-plots, the machinations and subterfuges that follow
that Miss BowFN justifies her title. Certainly The Cheats
establishes her in my mind as our first writer of historical
fiction. The character-drawing is admirable (especially of
poor weak-willed vacillating Jaques, a wonderfully observed
study of the STUART temperament). More than ever, also,
Miss Bow EN might here be said to write her descriptions
with a paint-brush; the whole tale goes by in a series of
glowing pictures, most richly coloured. The Cheats is not
a merry book; its treatment of the foolish heroine in parti-
cular abates nothing of grim justice; but of its art there can
be no two opinions. I wish again that I had been allowed

Won LETTow-WoRBEck; from General SMUTs, who congratu-
lated him on his Order “Pour le Mérite,” down to the
British Tommy who promised to salute him “if ever

August, 1914, till after the Armistice with a small force
mainly composed of native askaris, and with hardly any
assistance from overseas, is proof in itself of his organizing
ability, his military leadership and his indomitable deter-
mination. As these are qualities which are valued by his
late enemies his story of the campaign, My Reminiscences
of East Africa (HURST AND BLACKETT), should appeal to a
large public, especially as it is written on the whole in
a sporting spirit and not without some sense of humour.
His descriptions of the natural difficulties of the country

THE HEALING WATERS OF SPA.
[It is feared that the Treaty with the Turk
will not be signed in time for him to receive
an invitation to join the Allies and their late
enemies, towards the end of May, at the Con-
ference to be held at Spa, where it is proposed
to discuss a common scheme for the regenera-
tion of the world.]
Sweet after hopes deferred that make
The stomach feel so queer,
To think the Peace for which we ache
May very soon be here;
That, though but scarce two years have
passed -
Since we contrived to win it,
The War, if things go on so fast,
May end at any minute.
Yet must the pace be hotter still
With less of “hum !” and “ha !”
If we would have our pleasure's fill
And meet the Turk at Spa ;
How nice if he could only come,
Fresh from Armenian slaughter,
And join our Mixed Symposium
Over a mineral water |
His ripe experience would show
Just how (by Allah's grace)
To make this world of sin and woe
Into a better place ;
And, though we failed to cure at sight
All ills that want allaying,

Together go a-Maying. O. S.
LE MONDE 0ü L'ON TRAVAILLE,
THERE had been a long silence be-
tween us. We sat lunching comfortably
at the Ritz, and the Spring air came
| pleasantly in at the open window beside
us. I watched the people passing by
and commented on some of them to
Tony, but he seemed completely wrapped
in meditation. -
Really it was a little aggravating.
Spring always thrills me to the tips of
my fingers; I had put on my very
nicest clothes; we were eating the very
last word in lunches, and there was a
glorious atmosphere of holiday in the
air; but it was all lost on Tony.
Suddenly he roused himself. “It's
a queer thing,” he began d propos of
nothing, abstractedly toying with his
pêche Melba and lapsing into thoughtful
silence again.
“Shouldn't be surprised,” I retorted
sharply.
Then I looked across at him and my |
heart smote me. He is extraordinarily
good to look upon-fair crinkled hair,
Saxon colouring and blue eyes that can
warm up so delightfully at moments.
“What is queer, Tony 2 " I went on
more gently, conscious that in spite of
his abstraction his gaze was wandering
appreciatively in my direction, so that
I felt my new blouse was not entirely
“Well, the fact is,” he roused him-
self to start, “I’ve been making some
very interestin' experiments.”
“Oh ' " I said, a trifle disappointed.
“Yes, very interestin' indeed. You
know, of course, that I’ve only been
demobbed about six months, so there's
no ghastly hurry or anythin', but I
rather feel that I ought to begin to
think of doin' somethin'—some busi-
ness, profession sort of affair, I mean.
Havin' made up my mind more or less,
I thought I'd come up to town yester-
day and have a talk with one or two of
the fellows I know who have got jobs—
get a few tips and so on."
“That sounds an awfully good idea,”
I encouraged him. -
“Well, it was rather,” he agreed
modestly, “but on my life, Betty, you'd
never believe— Well, I'll tell you.
“I dropped in first of all on Dixon.
Not a bad chap at all, one of those—
you know—solicitors. Partner in an
A1 firm an' all that. They're fairly
rakin' in money at present with this
boom in Divorce Court stunts.
“Anyway we began talkin' about old
times and so on, as I hadn't seen him
for ages. We got laughin' over some
of his funny stories about their stuff—
no names or anythin' like that, of
course—and then bit by bit I started
tellin' him what was really at the back
of my mind about takin' up the work.
I don't think he grasped it quite at
first, but when he did he just leant
back in his chair and looked at me with
a kind of pityin' expression. “My dear
old boy,' he said, “take it from a friend,
one who has been through it—don't!
It's a dog's life; years of training;
work all day and night. No peace. Re-
sponsibility all the time. You know,
dear old fellow, what you want is a
soft job. Why don't you start stock-
brokin' or somethin'?'
“Well, of course that was a bit of a
set-back; still I thought, ‘Are we down-
hearted 2' So I trotted on round to
old Simkins—remember that stock-
broker chap we ran into at the Gaiety
the other evenin’? He's a decent sort
of fellow ; clever an' all that too—but
not by way of overworkin' himself.
“Well, I got to his office and asked
him out to lunch at the Club, but he
wouldn't hear of it. “My dear old man,'
he said, ‘you’re comin' right along
with me to the Carlton, and we're goin'
to have the best lunch they can turn
out. I tell you I've struck lucky this
morning; absolutely had a haul ' '
“Well, I thought that sounded pretty
cheery, so we toddled off, and I must
say they did us jolly well. It seemed
just the chance to get him to talk in a
pally sort of way, so I simply put it to
thinkin' of doin'. He listened to me a
bit doubtfully for a few minutes and
then leaned across the table and put
his hand on my arm, interruptin' me.
‘Don’t you do it, my son,’ he said. “As
a pal I warn you. The work the
worry! the carking anxietyl Take my
word for it the life of a stockbroker
isn't fit for a dog.'
“Seemed funny, didn't it? Only he
was so insistent that I began to get the
hump about it myself too and after a
little while I managed to leave him and
rolled off to get cheered up by Bird.
Teddy Bird's one of the best of fellows
—always merry an' bright. They manu-
facture ladies' jumpers or somethin' of
the sort; they were on Army clothin'
durin' the War; pots of money, of
course; not doin' too badly now either.
“I just blew in an' told him to come
on the binge or somethin' to cheer me
up. He wanted to know what I had
got the hump about, so I told him
about these other two chaps, and really
I was beginnin' to think what a let-off
I had had. Then a bright idea flashed
into my mind. Why shouldn't I manu-
facture somethin’? It seemed such a
toppin' good scheme that I asked him
straight out what he thought about it.
“‘My poor innocent lad,” he said,
‘don't you yet realise the sort of exist-
ence fellows like me have to lead 2
Labour troubles, money troubles, tax-
ation on profits. Why, good heavens,
it's little better than a dog's life!'
“I kind of felt crumpled and left
him.”
Tony looked across at me gloomily.
There was a heavy silence. I couldn't
think of anything comforting to say.
He paid the bill and we started thread-
ing our way towards Piccadilly.
“But, Tony,” I finally suggested
rather desperately, “you said just now
there isn't such a ghastly hurry. Why
don't you just stay round and amuse
yourself for a bit till something crops
up 2".
He turned and gazed at me re-
proachfully.
“My dear Betty,” he said, “I thought
you understood me better than that.
For a fellow of real ambition and keen-
ness for gettin' on, it's absolutely feed-
in', an existence like this, just messin'
about. It's the limit. Why, it's
nothin' better than a dog's * x
I glanced at him quickly and he
flushed crimson to the ears.
“What I mean to say—oh, hang it!"
he stuttered, waving his came. “Hi,
taxi! That's right. Hop in, Betty.
We've just about time to get a look in at
the Palladium. You know one wants
cheerin' up these days. Thinkin'
seriously about things is so beastly
wasted after all.

OUR NATURE CORRESPONDENT WRITES TO US THAT THE COUNTRYSIDE IS LOOKING ALMOST PERFECT.
ALL FOR JANE.
(With the British Army in France.)
How Jane contrived to inspire affec-
tion and bitter rivalry in the hearts of
Sergeant Bulter and Chippo Munks is
hard to imagine. She was not beautiful
or agreeable or even intelligent. And
she was certainly fickle and greedy.
If Sergeant Bulter persuaded her to
accompany him for a walk she was
quite likely to return with Chippo; and
if Chippo invited her to dine the end of
the dinner was usually the signal for
her to leave in search of the further
hospitality of Sergeant Bulter.
Nevertheless both soldiers wooed her
with an intensity that nearly brought
them into deadly conflict. The climax
was precipitated by an announcement
in Battalion Orders that ran —
“All ownerless dogs straying about
the Camp will be secured by the Camp
police for destruction. Owners of dogs
will therefore ensure that their dogs are
provided with collars showing names
of owners, and such dogs are not per-
mitted to stray about the lines un-
On reading this Chippo laboriously
inscribed an old identity disc—
JANE MUNKS,
“B” Cox.,
and sought out Jane in her usual
corner near the cook-house. He was
threading the disc with a piece of string
when Sergeant Bulter appeared.
“What are you doin' to that dawg?”
demanded the Sergeant.
“Fittin' 'er with a necklace,” replied
Chippo.
“Well, you can keep it to hang your-
self with,” said Bulter triumphantly;
“she's already provided.”
Chippo perceived, what he had pre-
viously overlooked, that Jane's neck
was encircled with a collar marked—
JANE BULTER,
SERGEANTs' MEss.
A sick feeling of disappointment came
over him, but he dissembled.
“I reckernize the family likeness, Ser.
geant,” he remarked and walked away,
whilst Jane, with callous disregard for
his sufferings, meditated whether to
dine with the Ration Corporal or the
Chippo walked gloomily in the direc-
tion of the town. As he approached
the place the blaring of cornets and
sounds of hilarity reminded him that
Quelquepart was holding its annual
foire. Merry-go-rounds and swing-
boats were not in harmony with Chip-
po's mood, and the performance at the
gaudily-painted Guignol struck him as
particularly dreary, but the sight of
Ferdinand Delauney's Grande Loterie,
with its huge red wheel and tempting
array of prizes, roused him to anima-
tion. Ferdinand was attracting in-
vestors by methods of persuasion which
Chippo, as an acknowledged “Crown-
and - anchor" expert, recognised as
masterly.
“Reckon I'll try a franc's-worth of
Ferdy's prize bonds,” he said. “But I
expect it'll just be my luck to win a
dog-collar or a muzzle.”
In due course the wheel began to
revolve, and it had scarcely stopped
before Ferdinand jumped from the
platform and embraced Chippo with
emotion.

Opening a crate he extracted an ath-
letic young cockerel, which he thrust
under Chippo's arm, and the latter
walked away with a prize for which
he had not the slightest use. -
Presently the cockerel began to
struggle, and Chippo, after considering
all methods of transport, took the string
intended for Jane from his pocket, at-
tached it to the rooster's leg and
marched it before him. He had not
proceeded far before he was confronted
by the scandalised Sergeant Bulter,
with Jane trailing miserably, at his
heels. -
“Hi!” shouted the Sergeant, “what
do you mean parading the town like a
blamed poultry show 2" - -
“A chap must 'ave a bit o' company
when he goes out. I ain't got no dawg
now,” replied Chippo pathetically.
“Dawgs is one thing,” said the
Sergeant, “and a mangy wry-necked
rooster wot's probably missing from
some-one's back-yard is another. It
ain't regimental.”
“It's as regimental as a yellow flap-
eared mongrel wot's bin enticed away
from its rightſul owner,” said the in-
subordinate Chippo. “There ain't no-
think in King's Regs. against it.”
“P'r'aps there ain't,” said Bulter;
“but it ain't soldierlike.”
“One minit, Sergeant. Wot's our
regimental mascot? It's a goat. An'
what's the Dampshires'? A chatter-
ing monkey. If monkeys an' goats is
soldierlike so 's poultry.”
The Sergeant was silenced, and Chippo
and his rooster proceeded on their
way, giving a finished exhibition of the
goose-step.
Thereafter Chippo and his pet osten-
tatiously paraded the lines, selecting the
occasions when the Sergeant was start-
ing out for a constitutional. Though
Bulter's feelings were sorely outraged
he preserved an air of icy aloofness,
which Jane imitated as long as she was
on the lead. This apparent indiffer-
ence should have been a warning to
the cockerel, but he did not know Jane's
peculiar temperament. The full revela-
tion came one morning when they met
in the lines unattended by their respect-
ive masters. The rooster quickly fell
a victim to feminine duplicity, and Jane
carried the mangled bundle of claws
and feathers and dropped it at Chippo's
feet.
Chippo took the remains to Sergeant
Bulter.
“See what your dawg's done,” he
said with indignation.
“An' a good job too,” answered
Bulter.
“You 'ear that ?" appealed Chippo
to another N.C.O. who was standing by.

“See 'ere, my lad,” spluttered Bulter,

“Very well, Sergeant,” said Chippo
meekly; “it’ll give me a chawnce to
make my complaint to the orficer.”
“'Ow do you mean?”
“Why, against you for flat disobedi-
ence of Battalion horders. If you 'adn't
let your dawg run about the lines un-
attended this wouldn't 'ave 'appened.”
The Sergeant's face bore the expres-
sion of a quack compelled to swallow
his own pills. Chippo continued re-

Rarely in his career had Bulter shown
such visible discomfiture.
“Of course,” added Chippo casually,
“if Jane was my dawg I'd 'ave no
grounds for complaint.”
When your strong man is compelled
to submit to the inevitable he usually
does it ungracefully. Bulter took the
collar from Jane's neck and pushed her
over with his foot.

SUSSEX GODS.
I HAVE been told, and do not doubt,
That Devon lanes are dim with trees,
And shagged with fern, and loved of
bees,
And all with roses pranked about;
I do believe that other-where
The woods are green, the meadows fair.
And woods, I know, have always been
The haunt of fairies, good or grim ;
There the knight-errant hasted bin;
There Bottom found King Oberon's
Queen ; . -
The Enchanted Castle always stood
Deep in the shadow of a wood.
But I know upland spirits too
Who love the shadeless downs to
climb;
There, in the far-off fabled time,
Men called them when the moon was
new,
And built them little huts of stone
With briar and thistle over-grown.
The trees are few and do not bend
To make a whispering swaying arch ;
They are the elder and the larch,
Who have the north-east wind for
friend,
And shield them from his bluff salute
With elbow kinked and moss-girt root.
There, when the clear Spring sunset dies
Like a great pearl dissolved in wine,
Forgotten stragglers half-divine
Creep to their ancient sanctuaries
Where salt-sweet thyme and sorrel-
spire -
Feed on the dust of ancient fire.
And when the light is almost dead,
Low-swung and loose the brown
clouds flow -
In an unhasting happy row
Out seaward over Beachy Head,
Where, far below, the faithful sea
Mutters its wordless liturgy;
Then Sussex gods of sky and sun,
Gods never worshipped in a grove,
Walk on the hills they used to love,
Where the Long Man of Wilmington,
Warden of their old frontier, stands
And welcomes them with sceptred
hands. D. M. S.

alone in the conservatory with none
other than the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER himself, who was regarding
this magnificent specimen of horticul-

monocle. After mentioning to him
that its record output was twenty-two

temptation of asking him whether he
thought the manufacture of home-
grown wines would be stimulated by
the provisions of the present Budget.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, however, returned
an evasive reply and went out to join
Sir Edward CARson, who was pacing
up and down in front of the Orangery.

ELIZABETH AND HER YOUNG MAN.
THE study door burst open and one
end of Elizabeth—the articulate end
—was jerked into view.
“Wot will you 'ave for lunch 2" she
demanded breathlessly. “Lamb or
'am 2 ”
Abruptly recalled from the realms of
fiction-writing, I (her mistress) looked
up a little dazed. “Lamb or 'am, '"
I repeated dully, “lamorram ” Er—
ram, I think, please, Elizabeth.”
Having thus disposed of my domestic
obligations for the day I returned to
my writing. I was annoyed therefore
to see the other end of Elizabeth travel
round the doorway and sidle into the
the same one for many weeks at a time.
It isn't her fault, poor girl. She would
be as true as steel if she had a chance;
she would cling to any one of them
through thick and thin, following him
to the ends of the earth if necessary.
It is they who are fickle, and the
excuses they make to break away from
her are both varied and ingenious.
During the War of course they always
had the pretext of being ordered to the
Front at a moment's notice, and were
not, it appears, allowed to write home
on account of the Censor. Elizabeth
used to blame LLoyd GEORGE for these
defects of organisation. And to this
day she is extremely bitter against the
Government. - . -
You will now understand why I was
dejected at the perfidy of the follower
belonging to the Boilermakers' Society.
I saw a dreary period of discomfort
ahead of me. And worst of all I was
expecting the Boscombes to dinner
that very week. They had not before
visited us and Henry was anxious, for
business reasons, to make a good im-
pression on them. I will not elaborate
the case. All I can say is that there
is no earthly possibility of making a
good impression on any living thing if
Elizabeth is in one of her bad moods.
And it would be no use explaiming the
situation to Mrs. Boscombe, because
she has no sense of humour; or to
Mr. Boscombe, because he likes a good
room. Her pretext for
entering—that of dust-
ing the roll-top desk
with her apron—was a
little thin, for she has
not the slightest objec-
tion to dust. I rather
think it cheers her up
to see it about the place.
Obviously she had come
in to make conversa-
tion. I laid down my
pen with a sigh.
“I yeerd from my
young man this morn-
ing,” she began. A
chill foreboding swept
over me. (I will ex-
plain why in a minute.)
“Do you mean the
boiler one 2 " I asked.
“"Im wot belongs to
the Amalgamated Ser-
ciety of Boilermakers,”
she corrected with dig-
nity. “Well, they've
moved 'is 'eadquarters
from London to Man-
chester.”

Finally, the Domestic
Bureau failed me.
Hitherto they had al-
ways been able to sup-
ply me with a temporary
waitress on the occa-
sion of dinner-parties.
Now it appeared these
commodities had be-
come pearls of great
price which could no
longer be cast before
me and mine (at the
modest fee of ten shil-
lings a night) without
at least fourteen days'
notice.
The Bureau promised
to do its best for me,
of course, but reminded
me that women were
scarce. I asked, with
bitterness, what had
become of the surplus
million we heard so
much about. They re-
plied with politeness
that, judging from the

There was a tense silence, broken
only by Elizabeth's hard breathing on
a brass paper-weight ere she polished
it with her sleeve.
“If 'e goes to Manchester, there I
goes,” she went on ; “I suppose I'd
quite easy get a situation there 2"
“Quite easy,” I acquiesced in a hollow
Volce.
She went out leaving me chill and
dejected. Not that I thought for one
moment that I was in imminent danger
of losing her. I knew full well that
this was but a ruse on the part of the
young man to disembarrass himself of
Elizabeth, and, if he had involved the
entire Amalgamated Society of Boiler-
makers in the plot, that only proved
how desperate he was.
I have very earnest reasons for wishing
that Elizabeth could have a “settled”
In fact, she is bitter against every-
one when her love affairs are not run-
ning smoothly. The entire household
suffers in consequence. She is sullen
and obstinate; she is always on the
verge of giving notice. And the way
she breaks things in her abstraction is
awful. Elizabeth's illusions and my
crockery always get shattered together.
My rose-bowl of Venetian glass got
broken when the butcher threw her
over for the housemaid next-door. Half-
a-dozen tumblers, a basin and several
odd plates came in two in her hands
after the grocer's assistant went away
suddenly to join the silent Navy. And
nearly the whole of a dinner service
was sacrificed when LLoyd GEORGE
peremptorily ordered her young man
in the New Army to go to Mesopotamia
and stay there for at least three years
number of applications received, they
must be the million in search of
domestics.
Returning home from the Bureau I
found Elizabeth studying a time-table.
“I see it's a hundred and eighty-
three miles to Manchester,” she com-
mented, “an' the fare's 15s. 5}d.”
“That's an old time-table you've
got,” I hastened to remark; “it is now
£26s. 4d.—return fare.”
“I shan't want no return ticket,”
said Elizabeth grimly.
Sickening outlook, wasn't it?

A Legacy of the War.
No one will lightly forget the noble
services rendered by the Y.W.C.A. to
our troops and those of our Allies
during the War, and many of Mr.
Punch's friends must have given prac-
tical expression to their gratitude. But
we are liable to forget that the end of
the War has not brought an end either
to the work of the Y.W.C.A. or to the
claim which that work has upon our
recognition. There is pressing need of
accommodation and protection and
healthy environment for the large army
of girls who have been demobilized and
are now engaged in, or seeking for,
civilian employment. The funds of the
Y.W.C.A. do not admit of the estab-
lishment and maintenance of sufficient
hostels for this good purpose. At the
moment a chance is offered to them of
purchasing a large, suitable and per-
ſectly-equipped house—rented during
the War, and after, by the Y.W.C.A.
—in a densely-populated district in
South London. The offer holds good
taken, over two hundred girls will be
turned adrift to wander in search of
lodgings. The price is thirty thousand
pounds. It is difficult to think of any
cause to which money could be more
usefully subscribed. Mr. Punch begs
his readers to send to the promoters of
this good work some token of their sym-
pathy and appreciation. Gifts should
be addressed to the Hon. Emily
Rinnaird, 4, Duke Street, W.1.

The white caps around her all breaking in spray,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, April 26th.-Among the
many Members of the House who have
held His Majesty's commission there
are, no doubt, some rather eccentric
persons, but that hardly justified Mr.
PALMER in suggesting that they should
be deprived in debate of the customary
prefix “gallant.” The SPEAKER gave
no encouragement to the idea, and
was still more shocked by Mr. DEVLIN's
proposal that all these courteous ex-
pressions should be dropped, and that
Members should “call each other by
It would certainly add
to the pungency but not to the peace-
fulness of debate if the Nationalist
Leader were allowed to refer to “Sir
Edwar-R-D CAR-R-son,” instead of to
“the right honourable gentleman the
Member for Duncair-r-n."
At Question-time Lord RoBERT CECIL
was informed that a report on the state
of Ireland was being prepared and
would shortly be circulated. But, a
further crop of outrages so moved him
that he could not wait for the facts,
and forthwith moved the adjournment.
The ensuing debate was not very help-
ful. Lord Robert demanded the re-
storation of law and order in tones so
vigorous that an hon. Member called
out, “A New Cromwell!” He did not
seem to like the comparison and later
on took most un-Cromwellian excep-
tion to the Government's methods of
“coercion.” Mr. BonAR LAw's speech
could in the circumstances be little
more than an elaboration of “Do not
shoot the pianist; he is doing his best."
Tuesday, April 27th.-On the report
of the Budget resolutions there was, of
course, the usual attempt to get rid of
the tea-duty. As Colonel WARD sar-
castically pointed out, opposition
to this particular impost has been
for years the “by-election stunt"
of every party in turn. To-day
the rejection was moved by the
Labour Party, and when the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExCHEQUER
asked if in exchange, they were (7

In advocating a slight relaxation of

upon the quality of the cigar that

followed it, and went on to remark
that he did not on this matter expect
the support of the Labour Party. Mr.
JACK JoNEs stentoriously resented this
slur upon their taste. “We like a
good cigar as well as anybody,” he
shouted, adding somewhat superflu-
ously, “Who has a better right to a
good dinner 2" This outburst may
have shaken the CHANCELLOR's con-
viction that Havana cigars are indu-
bitably of the nature of luxuries.
Wednesday, April 28th.-According
to the Duke of RUTLAND, who made an
eloquent plea for the better protection
of wild birds, their worst enemy is the
villageschoolmaster, whose motto seems
to be, “It's a fine day; let us go out
and collect something.” I cannot help
thinking that his Grace must have
some special dominie in his mind and
was arguing from the particular to the
general.
The story of Lady Aston's seat is
beginning to resemble a penny novelette.
Evicted by the bold bad Baronet below
the Gangway the heroine has been
enabled by the courtesy of one of
Nature's noblemen, in the person of
Mr. WILL THoRNE, to find a new home
in the precincts of the Labour Party,
and seems quite happy again.
Since the American Senate takes so
kindly an interest in our affairs as to
pass resolutions in favour of Irish
independence, Mr. RoNALD McNEILL
thought it would be only friendly if
the House of Commons were to recip-
rocate with a motion in support of the
Filipinos' claim to self-determination.
Mr. BonAR LAw fought shy of the
suggestion and preferred Sir Edward
CARson's idea that it was better for
each country to leave other countries
alone. “I would be very thankful,”
he added rather wistfully, “if Ire-
land would leave us alone.” But
his appeal fell on deaf ears, for,
at the instance of Mr. T. P. O'Con-
Nor, the House spent most of the
evening in discussing the threat
of the Irish dock - labourers in
Liverpool to paralyse the trade of
the port unless the Government
released the hunger-strikers at
Wormwood Scrubs.
The rest of the time was spent
in getting the House to agree to
% the expansion of the Excess Pro-
a fits Tax. This was largely secured
: by the special pleading of Mr.
BALDWIN. His argument that to
% call the tax “temporary,” as his
à chief did last year, was quite com-
* patible with maintaining and
even increasing it, was more in-
genious than convincing, but his

the new business, the CHANCELLOR
would do his best to ease it, combined
with an urgent “whip” to secure a big
majority for the impugned impost.
Thursday, April 29th.-Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL gave an account of the
Easter riots in Jerusalem, where Jews
and Moslems have been breaking one
another's heads to the glory of God,
for all the world like Irishmen in Bel-
fast. He also promised to give further
information as soon as Lord ALLENBY's
report should be received. Lord Robert
CECIL, who has lately developed an un-
lawyer-like tendency to jump to con-
clusions ahead of the facts, made what
sounded distinctly like a suggestion
that the British officers on the spot had
been remiss in their duty, and thereby
earned from Mr. CHURCHILL a dignified
castigation which pleased the House.
Crowned with olive-branches plucked
from San Remo the PRIME MINISTER
celebrated one of his now familiar peace-
triumphs. Everybody knows the pro-
cedure on these occasions—the crowded
House, the cheers raised by the faithful
Coalitionists as the victor is seen mak-
ing his way to the Table, and then the
speech, so unvarying in its construction
that I fancy there must be a sealed
Downing Street. First comes a recital
of the immense difficulties of the prob-
lems to be solved—in this case includ-
ing a really serious difference of opinion
with our good friends the French;
then a little comic relief at the expense
of his arch-critic in the Press, who on
this occasion had surpassed himself in
“simian clatter"; next a summary of

the wonderful results achieved—chiefly
the establishment of direct relations
with the hitherto boycotted Govern.
ments of Russia and Germany; and
lastly a declaration that all differences
and difficulties had melted away, and
that henceforward the Allies would be
a band of brothers.
Once more Mr. Asquith disappointed
his more impetuous supporters and
displayed his statesmanship by a speech
in which he practically said ditto to the
PRIME MINISTER ; the only suspicion of
a sting being contained in his sug-
gestion that the Supreme Council had
now outlived its usefulness and should
promptly be replaced by the League of
Nations.
Mr. BottoMLEY, on the contrary, was
all sting and no statesmanship. I
gather that he has been conducting an
unofficial conference on his own, and
as the result of his conversations with
distinguished but anonymous foreign
statesmen has arrived at quite different
conclusions from those of the PRIME
MINISTER. The fact that he was kept
waiting on the pier at Boulogne while
the British Delegation went off in a
special steamer, on which he was not
invited to embark, may have imparted


pattern for it in the archives of No. 10,

WHENEvER we spend a week in
London we never seem to find time for
the things we really want to do. After

And Angela answers, “Don't you ||

“Oh, ring her up, and suggest we come

“I can't think which part of the

“Ah, that's how I missed it. I only

“Well, it's an exhibition showing the

Thus we are left with six evenings
of duty and one of enjoyment, unless
Angela happens to hear that there is a
'cellist from Spitzbergen or a Bolshevik
soprano whom it is social death not to
be able to discuss. In that case we
get no fun at all.
The Hewetsons, who live in London
and can enjoy all these opportunities
for improvement and still have time
for Mr. Robey and the rest, think me a
terrible Philistine. But, as I pointed
out to Hewetson, he suffers just as
acutely when he has a holiday and
goes to Paris. Hewetson holds that

accompanied Mrs. H. to the Français,
the Opéra, the Opéra Comique and the
Odéon, to say nothing of the Théâtre

When I explained this to him, his whole
attitude changed at once, and he im-
plored me to accept his subscription for
shares in my company. But his heart-
rending account of his last visit to
Paris, before the War, when he and
Mrs. H. spent two days hunting round
the Louvre (Musée) under the impres-
sion that the Rodins were kept there,
suggested a wider scope for my schemes,
and it seemed to me that the only fair
way of acknowledging this was to
make Hewetson a director.

detect a familiar note in the conversa-
tion with Angela just recorded. The
idea is simple and, like all simple ideas,
great. We buy a house in each of the
chief capitals of the civilised world, and
to this house the visitor hurries as soon
as he has left his luggage at the hotel.
Each house will be arranged in the
same manner, so that no knowledge of
the language of the country is required
to enable the stranger to find his way
about.
The ground floor will consist of one
large hall or room, combining the func-
tions of waiting-room and Fine Art
Gallery. Reproductions of the principal
pictures and statues of the national
museums will occupy two walls and
the centre carpet, the remaining walls
being hung with the more astonishing
examples of contemporary painters.
(We are not anticipating any inquiries
for contemporary sculpture). A mini-
mum of ten minutes is allowed for this
room. When your turn arrives you
mount to the first floor, which you find
divided into two parts. In each of
these a cinematograph is installed,
one “featuring ” prominent artists in
the standard dramas of the particular
country—works like Le Cid, Macbeth,
Faust, or Peer Gynt ; while the other
runs through the more discussed scenes
of any current entertainment which
conceivably one “ought to see.”
The first of these programmes is de-
signed primarily for foreigners, and is
meant to save them the fatigue of a visit
to national or subsidised theatres, where
these exist. The second is intended to
meet the requirements of natives. Each
bill will last an hour, and, though clients
are entitled to see both performances,
full-time attendance at either carries
with it the right to proceed to the
next floor. Here again are two more
rooms. In the first of these a gramo-
phone renders in turn the leading
vocalists and instrumentalists (serious)
of the country. (Say half-an-hour.)
So far you will have been put to a
minimum expenditure of one hour and
forty minutes, and, as only five minutes
is allowed for the last room, the time
total cannot be considered excessive.
In this last room is nothing but a
row of desks. You wait your turn
before one of these ; then you hand in
your name and receive a pass. On this
is printed a certificate that you, the
above-mentioned, are acquainted with
the masterpieces tabulated overleaf.
Thus in less than two hours (inclusive
of possible delay in the waiting-room)
you are free to spend your holiday
that in time these certificates may come
to be accepted as carrying complete
immunity, for at least a month, from
every form of intellectual treat.
Hewetson wanted the certificates to
be issued in the waiting-room. He
said it would save time. But I decided
that, if the prestige of the institutions
and their certificates is to be kept up,
unscrupulous people must have no
chance of obtaining a pass and slipping
away without going up-stairs. Indeed,
I am adding an elaborate system of
checks, by which it will become im-
possible to reach the Discharge Bureau
without spending the requisite time in
each room. The first room is the
danger. In the crush people might
escape to the cinemas before their ten
minutes is up. My idea is to hand to
each entrant a lump of High-brow
stickjaw, guaranteed not to dissolve in
less than the stipulated period, and to
station a lynx-eyed dentist at the foot
of the stairs . . .
Hewetson in his simple-minded way
also wanted the company to be called
the Holiday-makers' Enjoyment League,
or the Society of Art-Dodgers, or some
such name. He even thought the
houses should be painted in bright
attractive colours. I pointed out to
him that they should be uninviting and
dull in appearance, and that a uniform
sobriety, a suggestion of yearning and
uplift, in every feature of the company's
appeal would not only allow thousands
of hypocrites, like Angela, to seek relief
at our doors, but would actually confer
on people like Hewetson and me a
stamp of that same intellectual passion
from whose manifestations we are en-
gaged in escaping.

ROMA REDIVIVA.
(A Classical Revel, after the Press
accounts of last week's Italian ball).
ANCIENT history became luminous at
Covent Garden last week, when the
great ghosts of the past, from Romulus
to NERo and from EGERIA to AGRIPPINA,
were seen one-stepping gaily in toga
and stola at the great Roman ball. It
was the night, not of the Futurists, but
the Praeteritists, and right royally did
they avail themselves of their chance.
Perhaps the most arresting of all the
costumes were those worn by Lord
CURzoN as TARQUINIUs SUPERBUs and
Mr. LANSBURY as SPARTACUs. The
former was garbed in a magnificent
toga purpurea, elaborately adjusted so
as to show the laticlave on his tunica.
Over this was a sumptuous lacerna of
silver tissue, fastened over the right
his head he wore a petasus of hyacin-
thine hue, out of which sprang three
peacock's feathers. He was shod with
curule shoes, or mullei, fastened with
four crimson thongs. Mr. LANsBURY's
costume was simpler but not less strik-
ing, consisting of scarlet bracca or
barbarian pantaloons, a jade-green
synthesis, buckskin soleae and an ac-
cordion-pleated pileus. Lord HowARD
DE WALDEN as MAECENAs attracted
general attention by the lustre of his
amethystine tunica and the crimson
heels of his crepidae, which may not have
been archaeologically correct, but were
certainly a happy thought. Mr. BER-
NARD SHAw, who personated CATo of
Utica, wore hygienic sandals, a white
toga and a brown felt Jaeger pileus.
Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE as MARCELLUs, the
best boy of ancient Rome, formed an
agreeable contrast to the numerous
who lent a regrettably Pagan element
to the assembly. But Lady Astor as
CoRNELIA, mother of the GRAccHI, was
an austere and dignified figure in her
panniered Botticelli stola, with pearl-
embroidered red wings, and a flabellum
(or fan) of albatross feathers with gold
bells attached. The grandeur that was
Rome, again, was revived in Mr. John,
who assumed the rôle of his namesake,
AUGUSTU's, and in Mr. BottomLEY,
who as HoRATIUS FLAccus imparted a
Sabine simplicity to the scene.
It is a pity that a good many of the
guests had indolently taken advantage
of the fact that ancient Roman dress
was not obligatory, and yet it must be
admitted that some of them looked the
Roman part to perfection. The un-
adorned rigours of evening dress only
threw, into greater relief the truly
Caesarian lineaments of Lord RIDDELL,
the stoical independence of Mr.CHARLEs
TREVELYAN and the aquiline dignity of
Mr. Tich (Parvus).
It may be added that the use of
Latin was not compulsory, but that one
of the guests, who appeared as Phu-
phluns, the Etrurian Bacchus, and par-
took freely of the excellent neo-Faler-
nian supplied by the firm of LEoNEs,
expressed the pious hope that he would
not suffer too much from calida acra on
the morrow.

and relies for her brilliant effects almost
completely on its irresponsible frivolity.
That Mr. BEN WEBSTER has come on

FEw will deny that, in writing The Life of Lord Kitchener
(MACMILLAN) so soon after the death of the great Field-
Marshal, Sir GEORGE ARTHUR has at least displayed the
courage of his affection, since to publish such a work
in a time of controversy like the present is inevitably
to trail a coat of many colours, each a challenge to some
particular prejudice. If, however, one can avoid any such
attitude of parti pris and regard these three dignified
volumes simply as the record of a great man by one who
best knew and admired him, they will naturally be found
of compelling interest. The three main chapters, so to say,
of the story, Africa, India and Whitehall, will each call up
vivid associations for the reader; each has been told care-
fully, with just sufficient detail. Perhaps circumstances
made it unavoidable that Sir GEORGE ARTHUR should, if
anything, rather overdo the discretion that is the better
part of biography; certainly in the result one gets what
might be called a close rather than an intimate study of a
figure that in life was already almost legendary. If any
man of our time was fittingly named great this was he—
alike in his single-minded patriotism, his success and that
touch of austerity which no anecdotes of exceptions can
wholly disprove. In surveying his career of merited
, triumphs one remarks how often it was given to him—as
at Omdurman and Pretoria—to redeem early disaster, and
one feels again the pity of it that he might not live to see
his noblest task accomplished at Versailles. No doubt the
last word upon KITCHENER of KHARTUM cannot be written
value as history hereafter, and is to-day a grateful tribute
to one who nobly deserved gratitude.
Personally speaking, I could find it in me to wish that
Mr. MAURICE HEWLETT would consult a good man about
the Saga habit, which appears to be growing upon him, to
the loss (or so I think) of all those who were lovers of his
more human and companionable fiction. But I repeat that
this is no more than individual prejudice, based on the fact
that these Norse chronicles (of unpronounceable people in
prehistoric times) leave me singularly cold. This apart,
however, The Light Heart (CHAPMAN AND HALL) may be
admitted an excellent sample of its kind. It is all about
the friendship of Thorgar and Thormod, with the former's
untimely death, and the punctilious attempts of the latter
to fulfil his social obligation in the matter of exterminating
the slayers of his friend; also, as second theme, the love of
Thormod for King Olaf, and the ending of both of them—
and of the tale also—in the heroic battle of Sticklestead.
One way and another, indeed, you seldom saw a short book
that contained more bloodshed, or in which love-making
(oh, Mr. HEWLETT') played a smaller part. There was a
“slip of a girl” in the early chapter of whom I had hopes,
but sterner business caused her to be too soon eliminated.
Skill and learning The Light Heart has in plenty, and an
engaging suggestion of the early artistic temperament in
the character of Thormod, fighter and song-maker. But
I fall back on my old complaint of being left cold; and
that I should suffer that way from the work of Mr.
HEWLETT gives you the measure of our loss.

triumphs one remarks how often it was given to him—as
at Omdurman and Pretoria—to redeem early disaster, and
one feels again the pity of it that he might not live to see
his noblest task accomplished at Versailles. No doubt the
last word upon KITCHENER of KHARTUM cannot be written
value as history hereafter, and is to-day a grateful tribute
to one who nobly deserved gratitude.
Personally speaking, I could find it in me to wish that
Mr. MAURICE HEwle:TT would consult a good man about
the Saga habit, which appears to be growing upon him, to
the loss (or so I think) of all those who were lovers of his
more human and companionable fiction. But I repeat that
this is no more than individual prejudice, based on the fact
that these Norse chronicles (of unpronounceable people in
prehistoric times) leave me singularly cold. This apart,
however, The Light Heart (CHAPMAN AND HALL) may be
admitted an excellent sample of its kind. It is all about
the friendship of Thorgar and Thormod, with the former's
untimely death, and the punctilious attempts of the latter
to fulfil his social obligation in the matter of exterminating
the slayers of his friend; also, as second theme, the love of
Thormod for King Olaf, and the ending of both of them—
and of the tale also—in the heroic battle of Sticklestead.
One way and another, indeed, you seldom saw a short book
that contained more bloodshed, or in which love-making
(oh, Mr. HEwlBTT') played a smaller part. There was a
“slip of a girl” in the early chapter of whom I had hopes,
but sterner business caused her to be too soon eliminated.
Skill and learning The Light Heart has in plenty, and an
engaging suggestion of the early artistic temperament in
the character of Thormod, fighter and song-maker. But
I fall back on my old complaint of being left cold; and
that I should suffer that way from the work of Mr.
HEWLETT gives you the measure of our loss.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(HEINEMANN), Sir PHILIP GIBBs has fairly flung aside the
restraint, enforced or self-imposed, that marked his des-
patches from the fighting fronts, to present war, the horrible,
senseless nightmare, as it really appeared to him. His
work as a correspondent emphasised for him the accumu-
lated miseries of thousands rather than any individual's
share, and his point of view is as remorselessly gloomy as
can be imagined. He is detailed in disgust; he is passion-
ate in pessimism. He presents not only the soldier's dis-
taste for trenches and machine guns, and his desire for the
things of familiar life, but also, with surprising vehemence,
his hatred of generals who give blundering orders from
comfortable billets in the rear, or of munitioners in England
who keep optimistic in spite of bad news from the Front.
He does not pretend to be quite fair in his criticisms, for
little of sensationalism for some tastes, it is very comforting
to read. The fact is that the spies of the enemy were
pounced upon so promptly and had such a harrowing time
that both their quantity and quality gradually sank to
something very like zero. It is no exaggeration to say
that most of the miserable creatures who came spying to
this country never had a dog's chance from the word “Go.”
One cannot waste one's sympathy upon those who for
mercenary motives consented to be spies, but I am glad
that Mr. FELSTEAD pleads on behalf of such men as CARL
LoDY. “Some day,” he writes, “when the nations of the
world grow more sensible, there will be two methods of
treating spies. Those who can prove patriotism as the
inspiring motive will be dealt with as prisoners of war; the
hirelings will be condemned to the death they richly deserve.”
obviously the higher command had
to keep out of the firing-line and
somebody had to work—and hard
too—to supply the torrent of muni-
tions demanded. Sir PHILIP ad-
mits all that, but in a kind of agony
calls on God and man to realise the
meaningless horror of it all and
forbid, at any price, the possibility
of its recurrence. If sometimes
unjust and nearly always tragical,
the book none the less is free from
anything like hysteria.
Mr. WARD MUIR writes with one
eye on the evening papers, and the
very title (not to mention the wrap-
per) of Adventures in Marriage |
(SIMPKIN) lures us without any
sense of difficult transition from
the news of the day to the realms
of romance. Fifteen stories are
contained in this book, of rather
unequal length and merit, nearly
all of them dealing with a tense
situation between husband and
wife, several of them calculated to
lift the hair, and one or two suffi-
ciently ingenious in mechanism, I
should think, to raise a curtain.
The adventures are not all un-
happy, and the author would seem
on the whole to balance the scales
fairly evenly between those who
desire to reform the Divorce Law
and those who would rather reform

the cinnabar caverns of Hang Yiu, where the workers

KING'S REGULATIONS, PARA. 1696.
I HAVE been in the Army for over five years; I have
wallowed in Flanders mud; I have killed thousands of
Huns with my own hand; I have seen my friends resume
the habiliment of gentlemen and retire to a life of luxury
and ease; and yet I am still in the Army.
I am informed that I am indispensable and that, although
I shall be allowed to go in due course, the fate of the nation
depends on my sticking to my job for a short time more.
It would be against the best interests of discipline for me
to tell you what my job is. -
Last week I yearned for a civilian life and decided that
not only would I leave the Army but immediately and in
good style.
I laid my plans accordingly and proceeded to Mr. Na-
than's. There for the expenditure of a few shillings I
purchased the necessary material for my guile.
I retired to my office, that is the desk that I sit at in
a room with two other officers, and I armed myself with
a file which would act as a passport to the Assistant of a
Great Man, who in turn is Assistant to a Very Great Man.
They all reside at the War Office. I went there and was
conducted to the Assistant of the Great Man. Everything
was proceeding according to plan.
I found him, after the manner of Assistants, working
It was entitled “Demobilization, letters concerning,” and
this was followed by a long number divided up by several
strokes. Within the file were some letters that had nothing
to do with my plan and still less to do with demobilization,
but I hoped that the Assistant of the Great Man might
not delve too deeply into their mysteries.
My hope was justified. “A personal application?” he
asked as he glanced at the reference number.
“Undoubtedly, Sir," I replied, and something in the
soldierly timbre of my voice arrested his attention.
Carefully replacing his teacup in its saucer he raised his
eyes towards me. As he did so he started as though he
had received a shock; a look of perturbation came over
his features; his cheeks assumed an ashy tint and for a
moment my fate trembled in the balance. But gradually
I could see his years of training were reasserting themselves;
the moral support of the O.B.E. on his breast was restoring
his courage; he nuttered to himself, and I caught the words
“Superior Authority.” -
Still muttering he rose and retired into the next room.
Everything was proceeding according to plan. -
In less than a minute he reappeared and beckoned me
to follow him. I then knew that I should soon be in the
presence of the Great Man himself.
I stood in front of an oak desk and noticed the keen but
suppressed energy of the wall-paper, the tense atmosphere
of war vibrating through the room, the solid strength of
England incarnate behind the oak desk. -
The Great Man spoke. His opening words showed that
his interest was centred rather in me personally than in the
file that lay before him. He spoke again, rose from his seat
and disappeared. And as he went I caught the words,
“Superior Authority.” In less than a minute he returned
and beckoned me to follow him. I then knew that I should
soon be in the presence of the Very Great Man himself.
Everything was proceeding according to plan.
I stood in front of a mahogany desk and noticed the
keener but more suppressed energy of the wall-paper, the
tenser atmosphere of war vibrating through the room, the
solid strength of the Empire incarnate behind the mahogany
desk.
The Very Great Man spoke. His opening remarks
showed that his interest was centred in me personally.
He spoke again, and these are his exact words: “Mr.
Jones,” he said, “I perceive that you are a student of
King's Regulations, and that you conform your actions to
those estimable rules. You will be demobilised forth with,
and in view of your gallant service I have pleasure in
awarding you a bonus of two hundred pounds in addition
to your gratuity; but please understand that this exceptional
remuneration is given on the condition that you are out of
uniform within two hours.”
With my feet turned out at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, my knees straight, my body erect and carried
evenly over the thighs, I saluted, about turned and marched
to the door. Everything had proceeded according to plan.
As I reached the door the Very Great Man spoke to the
Great Man. “You will draft an Army Order at once,” he
said, “in these words: King's Regulations. Amendment.
Para. 1696 will be amended, and the following words
deleted:—Whiskers, if worn, will be of moderate length.'"
I am still in the Army. The truth of the matter is that
what I have described did not really happen. My nerve
failed me at the door of Mr. Nathan's. But I believe that
whiskers, detachable, red, can be obtained from Mr. Nathan
for a few shillings.

DENMARK TO HAVE A MLANDATE
FOR IRELAND.
SENSATION IN PoliticAL CIRCLEs.
DASHING round to Downing Street
on our motor-scooter we were just in
time, to catch Sir PHILIP KERR by one
of his coat-tails as he was disappearing
into the door of No. 10 and to ask him
whether the strange rumour as to the
PRIME MINISTER's latest project was
true.
“Perfectly,” replied the genial Sec-
retary, gently disengaging us. “Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE has been greatly struck
by Mr. JACK JoNES's comparison of
Lord Robert CECIL to OLIVER CROM-
well, and has been studying the whole
Irish Question anew from an historical
standpoint. He has decided that the
mandate for Ireland ought never to
have been undertaken for the Papal See
by HENRY II. STRONGBow ->
“Let's see, wasn't he a Marathon
runner 2" we asked.
“You are thinking of LoNGBoAT,” he
replied. “The Earl of PEMBROKE was
invited to enter Ireland by DESMOND
MAcMoRogH, and between you and me
bad hat. Look at the way he stole
DEvorg HAL, the wife of TIGHEIRANACH
O'Rourke.”
“Quite, quite,” we replied. As a
matter of fact, if he had mentioned
“The Silent Wife” we should have felt
a bit more at home with the situation.
“Now take the Danes,” said Sir
PHILIP. “Do you ever hear an Irish-
man complain of the injustice done to
Ireland by the Danes 2 After that little
scrap at Clontarf they accepted the
Danish invasion quite naturally. Any-
how, the Danes got there first, and the
PRIME MINISTER’s view is ‘first come
first served.’”
“But will Denmark undertake the
mandate?” we asked doubtfully.
“Why not 2 They have Iceland
already, and there is only one letter
different.”
Scooting thoughtfully away, we went
to visit Mr. T. P. O'Connor, feeling sure
he would have some light to throw on
the situation. We found him overjoyed
with the proposal.
“Ireland and Denmark are simply
made for each other,” he pointed out;
“both are butter-producing countries
one homogeneous and indissoluble pat.
Peace will reign in Ireland from marge
to marge.”
Mr. DEvlin was less optimistic. The
rule of Dublin Castle under OLAF TRYG-
vesson was, he declared, not a whit
better than the rule of Dublin Castle
to-day. It was true that TURGEs the
Dane was King of All Ireland in 815,
but it was not until that chieftain had
been very rightly and carefully killed
by MELACHLIN that the Golden Age
of Ireland began. He was doubtful
whether Mr. EDMUND DE WALERA would
consent to be a toparch under Danish
suzerainty. As for himself, he held by
the Home Rule Bill of 1914 or, failing
that, BRIAN BoRU.
When we asked Sir Edward CARson
how he viewed the prospect of becom-
ing a Scandinavian jarl, he adopted
a morose expression reminding us not
a little of the “moody Dane.”
“If the PRIME MINISTER’s proposal
becomes law,” he said firmly, “I shall
have no alternative but to hand over
Ulster to Holland.”
We scooted slowly back to the office,
forced to the conclusion that the Irish

GENIUS AT PLAY.
SHALL I ever see again
In the human head a brain
Like the article that fills
That interior of Bill's 2
Never a day can pass but he
Makes some great discovery;
His inventions are so many
That you cannot think of any
Realm of science, wit or skill
That is not enriched by Bill.
To relieve the awful strain
Of possessing such a brain
William always used to play
Eighteen holes each Saturday.
But he scarce could see at all,
And he often lost his ball,
Plus his temper and his pelf,
So he made a ball himself,
Which, if it should chance to roam
Out of sight, played “Home, Sweet
Home”
On a small euphonium he
Had inserted in its tummy.
Next he wrought with cunning hand
Round its waist an endless band,
An ingenious affair
Such as tanks delight to wear;
And, inside, a little motor
Started every time you smote or
Even when you topped your shot;
And, once started, it would not
Stop, for if it came within
Half a furlong of the pin,
Then it was designed to roll
Straight and true towards the hole.
This is scarcely strange, because
It was bound by Nature's laws,
And a magnet was the force
(Hidden 'neath its skin, of course)
Which, thought he, would make it
feel
Drawn towards a pin of steel.
When he practised first with it
William almost had a fit,
For the ball with sudden whim
Started madly chasing him 1
“That's a game that I'll soon settle,”
William said; “my clubs are metal;
Spoons and other clubs of wood
Will be every bit as good.”
Then he found to his dismay
Every time he tried to play
That the ball with sundry hoots
Chased the hob-nails in his boots.
Finally he had to use
On his feet a pair of shoes
Of a most peculiar shape
Made of insulating tape.
So the final test arrives
When once more he tees and drives.
Joy! As soon as he has hit he
Sees it toddling down the pretty,
Never swerving left or right

Plodding through a bunker and
Braying like a German band.
Reader, possibly you'll guess
That the ball was a success.
'Twas in fact a super-sphere,
But—I shed a scalding tear
On these verses as I write 'em—
He forgot just one small item
Which (as small things often will)
Simply put the lid on Bill:
For the hole proved far too small
To accommodate his ball.
“WANTED Situation by respectable middle-
aged Girl; working housekeeper, can cook,

Singular Coincidence.

MANUAL PLAY.
ONE point emerges very clearly from
the murky chaos of the industrial
situation to-day; and that is that the
brain-worker will not for ever be content
to be merely a brain-worker, thinking
and thinking, hour after hour, day after
day. He is beginning to realise his
latent capacity for manual labour; and
he demands as his right a larger oppor-
tunity for self-development, so that he
too may escape from the drudgery of
brain-work and rise at last to the higher,
freer life of muscular exertion. There
must already be many brain-workers
who are well-fitted to take their place
in the ranks of manual labour; and
the cry goes up with increasing force
that, given only that opportunity which
is every man's due, millions of their
fellows are capable of lifting themselves
to the same standard. -
In my house the cry goes up with
peculiar force about Easter-time, when
I repaint as much of the house as I am
allowed and whitewash the rest, and
can appreciate what I am missing in
my everyday calling. It is astonishing
to think that one used actually to pay
people money to paint and whitewash,
and looked on with meek wonder, for
six weeks, while they did it. Bour-
geois I may be, but I have put aside
that folly. The Easter holidays now
are to me the best holidays of the year,
because for four whole days I can do
almost unlimited decorating. I begin
with the conservatory; I do it a deli-
cate pale blue, and it looks very lovely.
The vine in the conservatory no longer
yields her increase as she used to do,
but I can't help that. After the con-
servatory I start on the basement, and
the opportunities in the basement are
endless. It is a curious thing that
brain-workers who do much decorating
in their spare time do most of it in the
basement and not in the rooms they
have to occupy themselves. The base-
ment is fair game. Another curious
thing is that the people who do have to
occupy the basement never seem to
appreciate what you are doing for them.
They appear to think you are merely
amusing yourself.
The best day for doing the basement
therefore is Easter Monday, when you
can legitimately send the whole staff
(if any) away for a holiday, and com-
mandeer the entire kitchen equipment.
This point is more important than you
may suppose; since if the staff are at
home and you want to use the base-
ment bucket or the soft broom (both of
which are essential for efficient white-
washing) it is almost certain that they
will at the same time want to put them
is absolutely the most refined volume
to some preposterous use of their own;

and this causes either delay or friction,
probably both. Besides, they keep bust-
ling about behind you and saying, 'T't,
't’t,” or “Busy to-day ! ” in a surprised
voice. This is most irritating, and an
irritated painter always goes over the
edges.
When you have got rid of the staff (if
any) you can get to work on the scul-
lery and whitewash the ceiling. White-
washing is much superior to painting.
I don't put my brushes in turpentine
when I have finished for the day; and
if I do I put the green brush and the
light-blue brush and the black brush
and the white brush in the same pot,

is one thing the staff enjoy more than
tea-cups coming away in the 'and, it is
really rubbing themselves against wet
paint and wandering round muttering
complaints about it. Without a driers
or some drier or whatever it is, the
basement remains wet for ever, and all
work ceases while the staff amble
about, ecstatically rubbing themselves
against the doorposts and saying “T'tt,
t’tt,” in a meaning way.
Painting looks lovely while
you are doing it, but is very
horrible when it is dry,
being streaky or blistery or
covered with long hairs.
Whitewash looks horrible
while you are doing it, but
marvellous when it is dry,
which is much more satis-
factory. In a life of average
prosperity and no small
public distinction, includ-
ing an intimacy with a
professional tenor and
two or three free lunches
with noblemen, I can re-
call few moments of such
genuine rapture as the one
when you creep down to
the basement to find the
whitewash dry at last and
brilliant as the driven
SnOW.
The other thing about
whitewashing is that it is
done with a broom, not
with a finicking brush and
a small pot, but a good fat
bucket and the house-
maid's soft-broom. In this
way you can really get
some bravura into your
work. And, except per-
haps for watering the gar-
den with a hose, there is
no quicker way of making
a really good mess. White-
washing by this method,
I find that it takes much
longer to remove the white-
wash from the floors and
other places where it is not

It is a sad quality of oil-
paint that when it is dry
it no longer looks so lovely
and shiny as it looks when
it is wet. It was found
that the sense of disap-
pointment which this pro-
duced was greater than the
Painters' Union could
bear; so someone, in order
to prevent industrial strife,
invented some stuff called
varnish, by which, at the
very moment of disillu-
sion, the maximum of
shininess can be again pro-
duced with the minimum
of effort. It is one of the
few inventions which
make a man grateful for
ill the advance of science.
| Well, that is all there is
about painting. The only
difficulty, once you have
begun, is to know when to
stop. Painting is a kind
of fever. The painting of
a single chair makes the
whole room look dirty; so
the whole room has to be
painted. Then, of course,
the outside of the windows
has to be brought up to the
same standard; and if once
you have painted the out-
side of a window you are
practically committed to
painting the whole house.
The only thing that stops
me painting is a turpentine
crisis, which usually occurs
just before church on Sun-
intended to go than it does to put the
whitewash on the places where it is
intended to go; but the charwoman
does the removing on Easter Tuesday,
and I still think that that method is
the best. Especially, perhaps, for out-
side walls, because in one's artistic
frenzy it is usual to cover most of the
rose-trees with whitewash; they look
then like those whitewashed orchards,
and visitors think you are a scientific
gardener, combating Plant Pests.
Personally I don't pay too much at-
tention to the rather arbitrary rules on
painting laid down by the Painters'
Nor do I insist on “cleaning thor-
oughly the surface before the paint is
applied.” Anyone who sets out in prac-
tice to clean thoroughly the surface of
the basement before applying the paint
will find that the Easter holidays have
slipped away long before any paint is
applied at all. , Besides, one of the
main objects of paint is to hide the
dirt, so why waste time in removing it?
On the other hand, I am not content
with mere painting; I go in thoroughly
for all the refinements like driers and
varnishes and gold-size. Driers and
gold-size are extremely necessary when
day morning, when one has three work-
manlike coats of glossy enamel or pale-
green on one's hands. Week-end
painters should keep a close eye on the
situation, and cease work while there
is yet sufficient turpentine to cope with
the workmanlike coats; for I find that
in these days the churchwardens look
askance at you if you put in a penny
with a pale-green hand.
The extraordinary thing is that this
painting fever doesn't seem to afflict pro-
fessional painters; they know exactly
when to stop. But then they don't

the few forms of labour in which a man
has some tangible result (well, not tan-
gible, perhaps) to show for his work at
the end of the day. There is nothing
more satisfactory than that. It is true,
no doubt, that the professional painter
would rather have a windy article like
this to show; all I can say is I would
rather have a bright-blue basement or
a middle-green conservatory.
A. P. H.
THE EVE OF GREAT POSSIBILITIES.
IN a Press sighing deeply over the
various Labour crises there is the glad
news that Mr. CLEM Edwards, M.P.
(barrister), of the National Democratic
Party, has made a match with Mr.
JAMES WALTON, M.P. (miner), of the
Labour Party, to “hew, fill and train
two tons of coal in the shortest time
for fifty pounds a side.” The contest
is to take place at Whitsuntide.
Parliament will follow suit, and chal-
lenge each other to feats of wholesome
toil, to the great benefit of the nation.
In time no doubt the idea would
take on with the masses and an im-
mense amount of useful work would be
performed disguised as sport. August
Bank Holiday might become the great
yearly fixture for a sort of Gentlemen v.
Players bricklaying competition, and we
may one day read of huge crowds being
attracted to the East India Docks on
Easter Monday to watch stockbrokers,
flushed with their victory of Boxing
Day, playing a return match with the
dockers at unloading margarine. The
movement might expand until even on
Labour Day work would be in progress.
All this is, however, remote, but the
solid fact remains that during Whitsun-
tide of this very year work will actually
be done in a coal-mine. So far the miners
themselves have expressed no official
views on the contest, but there is a
them that anyone should work so hard
on the chance of winning a mere fifty
pounds. For the public at large there
is the gratifying thought that Messrs.
Edwards and WALTON are very nearly
matched, and they should therefore
produce between them in their friendly
struggle the best part of four tons of
coal, an unexpected windfall for the
nation.

THE EVE OF GREAT POSSIBILITIES.
IN a Press sighing deeply over the
various Labour crises there is the glad
news that Mr. CLEM EDw ARDs, M.P.
(barrister), of the National Democratic
Party, has made a match with Mr.
JAMES WALTon, M.P. (miner), of the
Labour Party, to “hew, fill and train
two tons of coal in the shortest time
for fifty pounds a side.” The contest
is to take place at Whitsuntide.
Parliament will follow suit, and chal-
lenge each other to feats of wholesome
toil, to the great benefit of the nation.
In time no doubt the idea would
take on with the masses and an im-
mense amount of useful work would be
performed disguised as sport. August
Bank Holiday might become the great
yearly fixture for a sort of Gentlemen v.
Players bricklaying competition, and we
may one day read of huge crowds being
attracted to the East India Docks on
Easter Monday to watch stockbrokers,
flushed with their victory of Boxin
Day, playing a return match with the
dockers at unloading margarine. The
movement might expand until even on
Labour Day work would be in progress.
All this is, however, remote, but the
solid fact remains that during Whitsun-
tide of this very year work will actually
be done in a coal-mine. So far the miners
themselves have expressed no official
views on the contest, but there is a
them that anyone should work so hard
on the chance of winning a mere fifty
pounds. For the public at large there
is the gratifying thought that Messrs.
Edwards and WALTON are very nearly
matched, and they should therefore
produce between them in their friendly
struggle the best part of four tons of
coal, an unexpected windfall for the
nation.

TO A COMING CHAMPION.
THE exodus was ended; stilled the urging
To “wait and let the passengers off first;"
I and my fellow-sufferers were surging
Along the gangway in one short sharp burst,
Clutching the straps so thoughtfully provided
Stamping on any feet that lay about,
And, Lady, it was then that you decided
This was where you got out.
I noted with an awestruck admiration
The gallant way in which you faced the press,
What force, what vigour, what determination,
What almost everything but politesse;
And then I gave back several hasty inches
Before your maenad rush; I felt alarmed
Lest you should use a hatpin in the clinches
While I was all unarmed. -
So in a more or less intact condition
You made your exit through the trellised gate,
And (this, I must admit, is mere suspicion)
Asked of a porter was your hat on straight;
And lo! the bard, left dreaming suo more,
Mused upon things the future hid from view;
He looked adown the years and saw the glory
England would win through you.
For in my morning sheet I'd seen it bruited,
Mid talk of Jazz and Fox Trot, plaids and checks,
That boxing was a sport precisely suited
I thought about the coming day when bevies
Of beauty would be found inside the ropes,
And saw you, eminent among the “heavies,”
The whitest of white hopes. -
I saw—and at the vision England's stock ran
High above par—how in the padded strife,
Beneath the auspices of Mr. CochRAN,
You'd whip the world, or should I say his wife?
Our land once more would boast the champion thumper,
The doughtiest dealer of the hefty welt,
The holder of but no, by then a jumper
Will have replaced the belt.

On the Vote for the Ministry of Agri-

Wednesday, May 5th.-Apparently
it is not always selfishness that makes
Trade Unionists unwilling to admit
ex-service men to their ranks, but
sometimes solicitude for the welfare of
these brave fellows. Take the manu-
facture of cricket-balls, for example.
You might not think it a very arduous
occupation, but Dr. MACNAMARA assured
the House that it required “a high
standard of physical fitness,” and that
leather-stitching was as laborious as
leather-hunting. It is true that some
of the disabled men with characteristic
intrepidity are willing to face the risk,
but the Union concerned will not hear
of it, and the MINISTER of LABour

Even on the Treasury Bench, how-
ever, doctors disagree. Dr. ADDIsoN
seems distinctly less inclined than Dr.
MACNAMARA to accept the claims of the
Trade Unionists at their own valuation.
The bricklayers have agreed to admit
a few disabled men to their union—
bricklayingapparently being a less stren-
uous occupation than , leather-stitch-
ing—but exclude other ex-service men
unless they have served their appren-
ticeship as well as their country. Upon
this the MINISTER of HEALTH bluntly
observed that the idea that it takes
years to train a man to lay a few bricks
was in his opinion all nonsense.
Thursday, May 6th.-Possibly it was
because to-day was originally assigned
for the opening of the Committee stage
of the Home Rule Bill that Members
in both Houses drew special attention
to the present state of lawlessness in
Ireland. If their idea was to create a
hostile" atmosphere” it did not succeed,
for, owing to Mr. LoNG's indisposition,
the Bill was postponed. Besides, the
fact that every day brings news of
policemen murdered, barracks burned,
tax-collectors assaulted and mail-bags
may argue that the present is a most
inopportune moment for a great con-
stitutional change, may to another
suggest that only such a change will
give any hope of improvement.
It is, at any rate, something to know
that Irishmen have not in trying cir-
cumstances entirely lost their saving
grace of humour. Thus the writer of
a letter to Lord AskwitH, describing
with much detail a raid for arms, in the
course of which his house had been
smashed up and he himself threatened
with instant death, wound up by say-
ing, “I thought I would jot down these
particulars to amuse you.”
The Commons had a rather depressing
speech from Mr. McCURDY. His policy
had been gradually to remove all food-
controls and leave prices to find their
own proper (and, it was hoped, lower)
level. But in most cases the result had
been disastrous, and the Government
had decided that control must continue.

WANTED–A BOOK SUBSIDY.
MR. JohN MURRAY, the famous pub-
lisher, has recently given a representa-
tive of The Pall Mall Gazette some
interesting facts and figures bearing on
the impending crisis in the publishing
trade. It is a gloomy recital. Men
doing less work per hour with the pre-
sent forty-eight hour week than with
the old fifty-one hour week, and agi-
tating for a further reduction of hours;
paper rising in price by leaps and
bounds. “Between the two they are
forcing up the price of books to a point
when we can only produce at a loss.”
In other words, we are threatened with
not merely a shortage but an absolute
deprivation of all new books. The
horror of the situation is almost un-
thinkable, but it must be faced. We
can dispense with many luxuries—en-
cyclopædias and histories and scientific
treatises and so forth—but among the
necessities of modern life the novel
stands only third to the cinema and
the jazz. It is possible that in time
the first-named may reconcile us to
What amazes us in Mr. John MUR-
RAY's pessimistic forecast is his failure
to recognise and advocate the only and
obvious remedy. By the reduction of the
Bread Subsidy fifty millions have been
made available for the relief of national
needs. We do not say that this would be
enough, but if carefully laid out in grants
to deserving novelists, so as to enable
them to co-operate with publishers on
lines that would allow a reasonable
margin of profit, it might go some way
towards averting the appalling calamity
which Mr. John MURRAY anticipates.
The Ministry of Information is closed,
but should be at once reorganised as the
Ministry of Fiction, with a staff of no
fewer than five hundred clerks, and in-
stalled in suitable premises, the British
Museum for choice, thus emancipating
the younger generation from the dead
hand of archaeology. Similarly the
utmost care should be taken to exclude
from the direction of the Ministry any
representatives of Victorianism, Han-
overism, or the fetish-worship of reti-
cence or restraint. But no time should
be lost. The duty of the State is clear.

CONSPIRACY.
IT all happened so naturally, so
inevitably, yet so tragically—like a
Greek play, as Willoughby said after-
wards.
Willoughby is my younger brother,
and in his lighter moments is a Don at
Oxford or Cambridge; it will be safer
not to specify which. In his younger
and more serious days he used to play
the banjo quite passably, and, when the
Hicksons asked us to dine, they insisted
that he should bring his instrument
and help to make music to which the
young people might dance, for it seems
that this instrument is peculiarly suited
to the kind of dancing now in vogue.
Willoughby had not played upon the
banjo for fifteen years, but he unearthed
it from the attic, restrung it, and in the
event did better than might have been
expected.
Anyhow, he did not succeed in spoil-
ing the evening, which I consider went
well, despite the severe trial, to one of
my proportions, of having to perform,
soon after dinner, a number of scenes
“to rhyme with hat.” Indeed, when I
was finally pushed alone on to the
stage, any chagrin I might have felt at
the ease with which the audience
guessed at once that I represented
“fat" was swallowed up in the relief
at being allowed to rest awhile, for
“fat" proved to be correct.
It is not of dumb-crambo, however,
nor of hunt-the-slipper (a dreadful
game), nor of “bump '' (a worse game)
that I wish to speak, but of that which
befell after.
It was a very wet night, and when
the hour for our departure arrived
there arose some uncertainty as to
whether we could find a taxi willing
to take us home.
“I will interview the porter,” said
Willoughby (the Hicksons live in a
flat), and he disappeared, to return in
a few minutes with something of the
air of a conspirator.
“Get your coat on,” he said curtly.
“Have you a taxi 2"
“No, I have a car. Get your coat
on, and be quick about it.”
“A car 2 " I said. “What car 2
Whose car 2 ”
Willoughby turned upon me. “If
you prefer to walk, you can,” he said;
“if not, get your coat on, as I say, and
don't ask stupid questions.”
I did not prefer to walk—would that
I had l—but proceeded to bid my host
and hostess Good-night. Even as I
was doing so the porter came to the
door.
“Hurry up, Sir,” he called to
Willoughby in a stage whisper. “He
As we followed him into the hall
the porter went on whispering to
Willoughby.
“Friend of mine. Always do me a
turn. Going right to your square.”
He continued to nod his head confi-
dentially. -
Willoughby turned to me.
“Got half-a-crown 2" he grunted.
I had. The porter's head-noddings
redoubled.
Arrived at the door, we found a
resplendent car, a chauffeur of the im-
perturbable order seated at the wheel.
“I’m very much obliged ,” Wil-
loughby began.
“That's all right, Sir,” said the man.
“I’m going that way.”
We stepped in, drew the fur rug over
our legs, and the car glided off.
“It's a nice car,” said Willoughby.
“I understand that the chauffeur is
a friend of the hall porter?” I com-
mented.
“That is so.”
“And the owner of the car is 2 ”
“Some person unknown.”
“Where ignorance is bliss * >
“I am a little doubtful if the
chauffeur will mention our ride to his
master, if that is what you mean,”
said Willoughby.
“Have you considered the bearing
of the law concerning Conspiracy on
this case ?” I asked.
“I have not, nor do I intend to,”
said Willoughby airily. “The law
concerning Bribery and Corruption has
a much more direct bearing. Got two
more half-crowns 2 ''
I was searching for them as we
turned into the square in which we
live and the car slowed down.
“Tell him it's at the far corner,” I
said. -
And then suddenly a rasping voice
sounded on the night air :—
“Here, Rodgers' Where are you
off to ? You're very late, you know—
very late.”
The car had stopped with a jerk
before a house which was certainly not
our house. A stream of light from the
open door flooded the pavement. On
the steps stood Percival, the man I had
that row with about the Square garden.
On the pavement, his hand outstretched
to open the car door, was he of the
rasping voice.
“This is the owner,” said Willoughby,
and he laughed quietly to himself. He
'always giggles in a crisis. I could have
kicked him. But at the moment I was
hurriedly debating whether I could
possibly escape by the door on the far
side without being seen. “A small
thin man might have done it,” I thought.
But, alas! I am neither small nor thin.
Willoughby stepped forth into the lime-
light, as it were. During the evening
the dumb-crambo and such had rather
dishevelled his hair, and a wisp of it
now appeared from beneath the brim of
an elderly Homburg hat pushed on to
the back of his head. Under his arm
was the banjo. On his face was that
maddeningly good-natured smile of his.
“What are you doing in my car?"
demanded the rasping voice.
Willoughby did not answer for a mo-
ment, but simply stood there smiling.
Then he said, “Entirely my fault.
Your chauffeur is in no way to blame.
The fact is we couldn't get a taxi, and
my brother being rather delicate * >
“What, another?” barked the rasper.
There was nothing for it. Acutely
conscious as I was how emphatically
my countenance, flushed by the exer-
tions of the evening, belied Willoughby's
description of “delicate,” it was impos-
sible for me to remain in the car, and I
stepped heavily out.
“It rhymes with hat,” said Wil-
loughby softly.
--- sk x: x:
As we slunk off down the Square,
after as painful a five minutes as I care to
remember, Willoughby kept repeating,
“Very unlucky—very unlucky,” till we
arrived at our own door. Then he
began to laugh.
“And what is the joke?” I asked.
> “There is no joke,” he said—“no
joke at all.”
“Indeed there is not,” I said bitterly.
“You must remember that, unlike
yourself, I live here permanently.”
“I realise it,” said Willoughby. “But
do you not think, on consideration, that
that really gives you the advantage 2 I
mean, you have thus the opportunity
of living down the unfortunate accusa-
tion of inebriety that has been brought
against us, which I shall not be in a

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
PROBABLY one of your first, and abiding, impressions of
The Third Window (SECKER) will be that of almost extreme
modernity. Certainly ANNE Douglas SEDGwick (Mrs.
BASIL DE SELINcourt) has produced a story that, both in
its protagonists—a young war-widow and a maimed ex-
officer—and in its theme — spirit - communication and
survival of personality—is very much of the moment. It
is a short book, not two hundred pages all told, and with
only three characters. You observe that I have given you
no particulars as to the third, though (or because) she is of
the first importance to the development. To say more of
this would be to ruin all, since suspense is essential to its
proper savouring; though I may indicate that it turns upon
the question whether the dead husband is still so far present
as to forbid the union of his widow and his friend. The
thing is exceedingly well dome, despite a suggestion now
and again that the situation is becoming something too
fine-drawn; I found myself also in violent disagreement with
the ending, though for what reasons I must deny myself
the pleasure of explaining. Perhaps the cleverest feature of
an unusual tale is the idea of Wyndwards, the modern
“artistic” house that is its setting—a house rather over
deliberate and self-conscious in its simplicity and beauty,
lacking soul, but swept and garnished for the reception of
the seven devils of bogiedom. The atmosphere of this is
both new and conveyed with a very subtle skill.
It must be admitted that Mrs. BELLoc LowNDES's young
their habit when in foreign parts of picking up the worst
people and generally surrounding themselves with a society
that it would be flattery to call dubious. The latest victim
to this tendency is Lily, heroine of The Lonely House
(HUTCHINSoN). It was situate, as you might not expect
from its name, at Monte Carlo, and Lily had come there
as the paying guest of a courtesy uncle and aunt of foreign
extraction, about whom she really knew far too little. They
had tried to postpone her visit at least for a couple of days,
the awkward fact being that the evening of her arrival was
already earmarked for an engagement that Auntie euphe-
mistically called “seeing a friend off on a long journey."
If you know Mrs. BELLoc LowNDEs at her creepiest, you
can imagine the spinal chill produced by this discovery.
Gradually it transpires (though how I shall not say) that
whenever the Count and Countess Polda were in want of
a little ready cash they were in the habit of “seeing off"
some unaccompanied tourist known to have well-filled
pockets. So you can suppose the rest. If I have a criticism
for Mrs. LowNDEs' otherwise admirable handling of the
affair it is that she depends too much on the involuntary
eavesdropper; before long, indeed, I was forced to conclude
either that Lily possessed a miraculous sense of overhearing,
or that the acoustic properties of the lonely house rendered
it conspicuously unsuited for the maturing of felonious
little plans. But this is a trifle compared with the delights
of such a feast of first quality thrills.
The extraordinary cleverness of A Woman's Man (HEINE-
MANN) is the thing which most impresses me about this
life story of a French man of letters, at the height of his

ladies enjoy singularly poor luck, as is shown notably by
fame somewhere in the eighteen-nineties. He is made to

tell his own story, and pitfalls for the author must have
abounded in such a scheme, but Miss MARJoRIE PATTERSON
seems to have fallen into very few of them. Armand de
Waucourt is a self-deceiving sensualist who justifies his
amours as necessary to literary inspiration and neglects his
wife only to find, too late, that she has been his guardian
angel, her love the source of all that was worth while in his
life and work. There have been such characters as Armand
in fiction who yet made some appeal to the reader's affec-
tion; it is the book's worst defect that Armand makes
none. His recurring despairs and passions grow tedious;
his final but rather incomplete change of heart left me
sceptical as to how long it would have lasted had the book
carried his history any further. Armand as a study of a
certain type of egoist is supreme; my difficulty was that I
had no desire to study him. Even Maria-Thérèse Colbert,
the decadent wife of his publisher, a very monster among
women, is more interesting. Miss PATTERSON is on the
side of the angels, but she makes her way to them through
some nasty mire, calling spades spades with a vigour which

No pioneer work was ever more persistently attacked
by the weapons of ridicule and contempt than that of the
Salvation Army, and I suggest that all who sat in the
hostile camp should read William Booth, Founder of the
Salvation Army (MACMILLAN), and see for themselves what
ideas and ideals they were opposing. Mr. HARold BEGBIE
has done his work well, and the only fault to be found with
him is that his ardour has sometimes beguiled him into
recording trivialities; and this error strikes one the more as
Booth, both in his strength and in his weakness, was not
trivial. When this, however, is said, nothing but praise
remains for a careful study both of the man and of his
methods. The instrument upon which Booth played was
human nature, and he played upon it with a sure hand
because he understood how difficult it is to touch the spirit
when the body is suffering from physical degradation. To
this must be added a genuine spiritual exaltation and love
of his fellow-man and also an indomitable courage. Few
men could have emerged with hope and enthusiasm un-
quenched from such a childhood as Booth's; but we know
how he lived to con-
quer all opposition
and to promote and
organise what is per-
haps the greatest
movement of modern
times. In paying our

I do so
the set pieces of official propaganda. To a mere layman
this record is of immense and continual interest; to the
professional, keen to know what his opposite number was
doing at a given time, it must be positively enthralling,
especially the chapter on the U-boats, with its dis-
creet excerpts from selected logs. Incidentally one can't
withhold tribute of reluctant admiration for the technical
achievements of the submarines and the courage, skill and
tenacity of their commanders and crews. Most readers
will find themselves turning first to the account of the
Jutland battle. The tale is told not too boastſully, though
the Admiral claims too much. Perhaps that may be for-
given him, as he certainly took his long odds gamely and
fought his fleet with conspicuous dexterity. Also the Ger-
man naval architects and ordnance folk proved to have a
good thing or two up their sleeves, and the gunnery, for a
time at any rate, was unexpectedly excellent. Naturally
perhaps Admiral SCHEER may be claimed as supporting the
Beattyites rather than the Jellicoists. But he is biassed
and goes further than the most extreme of the former school.
For his real grievance against the British Navy, constantly
finding vent, is that it did not ride bravely in, with bands
playing, to the perfectly good battleground prepared with
good old German thoroughness under the guns of Heligoland.

faithful company of readers will prefer the latter. Mr. GALs.
worthy has less than most men the kind of mind that
can put off the burden of the suffering of war or submit
easily to the difficult need for us all to think one way in a
time of national crisis. But “Caſard,” study of a poilu in
the despairing depression that comes of the fatigue and
horror of long fighting, who is liſted back to courage by a
little frightened beaten mongrel whose confidence be wins,
so forgetting his own trouble, was written, one can feel,
because the author wanted to write it, not because he felt it
was expected of him. Of the peace-time sketches “Manna,"
with the theme of a penniless and eccentric parson charged
with stealing a loaf of bread and acquitted against the
evidence, is as admirable as it is unexpected in flavour.
For the rest there is good GALsworthy, if not of the very
best, and but little that one would not praise highly if it
came from an author of lower standards.
Three members, quite immune to scowl or snub,
Disturbed the quiet of the selfsame club;
The first in resonance of snore surpassed,
The next in raucousness, in both the last.
Patience, exhausted, heaved a futile sigh;
No force can cure them and they will not die.

THE LIBERAL BREACH.
(As viewed dispassionately by a
looker-on.)
WHEN dog with dog elects to fight
I take no hand in such disputes,
Knowing how hard they both would bite
Should I attempt to part the brutes.
So in the case of man and wife
My rooted habit it has been,
When they engage in privy strife,
Never to go and barge between.
Nor do I join the fighting front
When Liberal sections disagree,
One on the Coalition stunt -
And one on that of Freedom (Wee).
Though tempted, when I see them tear
Each other's eyes, to say, “Be good!"
As an outsider I forbear,
Fearing to be misunderstood.
Fain would I use my gift of tact
And take a mediatorial line,
But shrewdly recognise the fact
That this is no affair of mine.
Yet may I venture to deplore
A great tradition cheaply prized,
And yonder, on the Elysian shore,
The ghost of GLADSTONE scandalised.
But most for him I mourn in vain
Whom Fate has dealt so poor a fist
(Recalling SHAKspeARE's gloomy Dane,
That solid-fleshed soliloquist)—
O curséd spite that he was born
(ASQUITH, I mean) to close the
breach
And save a party all forlorn
By mere rotundity of speech.
O. S.
A LIAR'S MASTER PIECE.
My friend Arthur's hobby is the stu-
pendous. He conceives himself to be the
direct successor of the mediaeval travel-
story merchants. War-tales, of course,
are barred to him, for nothing is too
improbable to have happened during
|| the War, and all the best lies were used
by professionals while Arthur was still
serving. Once, however, in his career
he has realised his ambition to be taken
for a perfect liar, and that time he hap-
pened to be speaking the simple truth.
I was his referee and he did it in this
wise.
When ALLENBY was making his last
great drive against the Turk, he was
no doubt happy in the knowledge that
Arthur and I were pushing East through
Bulgaria to take his adversary in the
rear. We pushed with speed and ad-
dress, but just when it looked as if we
should exchange the tactical for the
practical we stopped and rusticated at
the hamlet of Skeetablista, on the
Skeetablista was under the control
of Marko and Stefan and an as-
sorted following of Bulgar cut-throats.
Although the mutual hatchet had been
interred a bare three weeks we found
ourselves among friends. Thomas At-
kins was soon talking Bulgarian with
ease and fluency, while his “so-called
superiors,” as the company Bolshevik
put it, celebrated the occasion by an in-
ternational dinner in Marko's quarters.
The dinner consisted chiefly of rum
(provided by us) and red pepper (pro-
vided by Marco and Stefan).
These latter were bright and eager
youths from Sofia military academy, and
while the rum and red pepper passed
gaily round they talked the shop of
their Bulgarian Sandhurst in a queer
mixture of English and French. They
made living figures for us of the KAISER,
who had inspected them not long be-
fore, of FERDIE and of BORIs his son,
and told moving tales of British gun-
fire from the wrong end. We countered
with KITCHENER, LLOYD GEORGE and
the British Navy, while outside in the
night the Thracian wolves howled de-
risively at both alike.
“I should like plenty to travel away
and see the other countries,” said Marko,
rolling us cigarettes after dinner. “This
is a good country, but ennuyant, 'Ow
the wolfs make plenty brouhaha to-
night, hein 2 Stefan, did you command
the guard to conduct our frien's 'ome?”
Stefan waggled his head from side
to side in assent.
“Yes,” continued Marko, “to see
Italie, Paris, Londres. Particulierly
Londres.”
“I live in London,” Arthur remarked.
“You live?” said Marko with interest.
“Tell me, 'ow great is Londres 2"
“How great 2" repeated Arthur,
doubtful what kind of greatness was
indicated, moral or material.

THE PERSONAL TOUCH.
(By our tireless Political Penetrator.)
For some time past, I understand,
the Government has been considering
steps to bring the personalities of Cab-
inet Ministers more prominently into
the public eye. “We are not suffi-
ciently known,” said Sir WILLIAM SUTH.
ERLAND, who has the matter in hand,
“as living palpitating figures to the
man in the street. We do not grip the
nation's heart. We lack pep.”
I told him that it was a pity about
pep. I felt that the Government ought
to have pep. and plenty of it. If pos-
sible they ought to have vineg, and
must. too.
“You are right," he said. “Occasional

he continued with a sigh, pushing me
over a box of cigars.
“What are you going to do about
it?” I asked, lighting one and putting
another carefully behind my ear.
“You must remember first,” he re-
plied, “that this is quite a modern
difficulty. Statesmen of the past used
to make their leisurely progress through
the town surrounded by retainers on
horseback, or in sedan-chairs, beauti-
fully dressed and scattering largesse as
they went. THOMAS A BECKET, the
great Primate and Chancellor, used to
have poor men to dine with him and
crowds thronging round to bless him.
To-day, I suppose, Joe BECKETT in his
flowered dressing-gown would be a more
popular figure than Lord BIRKENHEAD
and the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, if
you can imagine them rolled into one.

We shall make a point of throwing not

“We are thinking of goat carriages
and overalls for economy,” he said,
“and the largesse cannot, I am afraid,
be allowed for in the Treasury Esti-
mates. But we shall certainly scatter a
handful or two of O.B.E.'s as we go.”
“And how will you deal with the
country and the outer suburbs?” I
asked when my admiration had parti-
ally subsided.
“Ah, there you have the Cinema,”
replied Sir WILLIAM enthusit stically.
“We are going to make great strides
with the Cinema. Our first film, which
is now in preparation, deals with the
Leamington episode and has been very
carefully staged. It has been neces-
sary, of course, in the interests of art
to elaborate the actual incidents to a
certain extent. Coalition Liberals, for
instance, were obliged to board the
train in the traditional manner of the
screen, leaping on to it whilst in mo-
tion and climbing, some by way of
the brakes and buffers, some along the
roofs of the carriages, into their re-
served compartment. Then again we

but we secured the services of actors
well trained in Wild West and “crook”
parts, capably led by those two promi-
nent comedians, Mr. Mutt and Mr. Jeff.
The film ends, of course, with the second
meeting at the Central Hall, West-
minster, when Messrs. Mutt and Jeff
again appear as comic and objection-
able interrupters, and are ignomini-
ously hurled into the street.
“Very soon we hope to have all im-
portant Parliamentary debates filmed.
It will be essential, of course, to provide
some comic relief, and we are relying
confidently on certain Members to prac-
tise the wearing of mobile moustaches
and to take lessons in the stagger, the
butter slide, the business with the cane
and the quick reversal of the hat.”
“In short you think politics should
be more spectacular?”
“That's it,” he said. “Hobbs the
mammoth hitter and a little less of the
Leviatham.” -
Greatly impressed I bit off the end

AURAL TUITION.
THE only other occupant of the carriage was a well dressed
man of middle age, clad in English clothes, but from many
slight signs palpably a foreigner of some sort.
Soon after the train started I noticed that his mouth and
throat were twitching and I surmised that he was about to
speak. But speech is no term in which to describe the queer
animal, vegetable and mineral sounds which issued from
him. First his mouth opened slightly and he seemed about
to sneeze. Next I was conscious of a scraping noise in his
throat, accompanied by a slight ticking. It appeared that
he was going to have a fit and I regretted that we were alone.
The noise grew louder, took on speed and rose in a crescendo
almost to a screech. Then a few more scrapes, as of a pencil
on a slate, and I began to detect that he was speaking. His
lips did not move, so that his voice had a curiously distant
sound. Nevertheless the words were clearly audible.
The following is what he said in a low, metallic mono-
tone: “Good morning, Sir. I am very pleased to meet
you. Can you tell me what o'clock it is 2 I am much
obliged. I wish to descend at Manchester. At what hour
do we arrive there? There are few passengers to-day. The
weather is fine. I beg your pardon if I do not make myself
clear. I do not speak English perfectly as yet. No doubt
I have need of much practice. Can I send a telegram from
the next station ? Is there a good hotel at Manchester?
Will you do me the favour * > - -
“Stop,” I cried, after having several times opened my
mouth to answer one or other of his questions.
As soon as I spoke the words ended with a sudden click;
the voice descended and became a scrape; at last silence.
“My dear Sir,” said I, “I shall be happy to give you
any information I can if you will ask one question at a
time. You evidently speak English very well indeed.”
His face lighted with approval of the compliment and
then the whole performance began over again. Once more
the wheeze, the scrape, the screech, the tick and all the rest
of it. I became terrified at these painful impediments in his
speech.
I remembered that somebody had once told me what to
do on such occasions. It was either to throw the patient
upon his back and move his arms up and down in a
travesty of rowing or to slap him violently on the back.
Seeing that the stranger was several times larger than
Bonfires in the purple heather and the barracks burning
my feet I turned him round and thumped his back vigor-
ously. He received the treatment with amiable smiles.
Next he produced from his pocket a booklet, which he
handed to me with a polite bow, desisting entirely from his
menagerle noises.
I am of a nervous temperament and needed some minutes'
rest in which to collect myself. Then I began to examine
the stranger's gift.
It was a well-printed pamphlet, obviously an advertise-
ment :— -
“HOW TO LEARN FOREIGN LANGUAGES.
The One Truly Scientific Method.
The only way to acquire the real accent of the native is
to listen repeatedly to the language spoken by a native.
With our phonograph No. 0034 and a selection of suitable
records the student may listen for as many hours daily as
he chooses to the voice of a native speaking his own
language.”
Lower down I saw : “Contents of Records. No. 1, At
the Hotel; No. 2, At the Railway Station; No. 3, In the
Train.” Ah! there it was—the whole monologue:—
“Good morning, Sir. I am very pleased to meet you. Can
you tell me ..? "
The explanation relieved me; I turned to my fellow-
traveller. -
“My dear Sir,” said I, “I congratulate you on being the
perfect pupil. Your teacher, could it feel such emotions,
would be proud of you. Only to an exceptional student can
it be given so faithfully to reproduce “His Master's Voice.”

THE MAKING OF A CRISIS.
[We are privileged to-day to publish an
unwritten chapter from Mr. H. G. WELLs'
History of the World. It is entitled “The
Slime Age,” and has a topical interest since
it outlines the methods of production of the
Crisis, the only article of which the supply
to-day exceeds the demand.]
OUT of all this muddle and con-
fusion and slipshod thinking there arose
one man with a purpose, one man who
fixed his eyes on a single inevitable
goal and walked straight at it, not
minding what or whom he trod upon
on the way. His purpose was the mass-
production of crises, and he created
| crises as rabbits create their young,
nine at a time. In those fuddled in-
competent days before the Great War
the crisis was a little-known phe-
nomenon. Here and there in the drab
routine of peaceful corpulent years there

find time to press the PRIME MINISTER
for an explanation of the outrageous
incident at Bobadig reported in our
columns last week. There is only too
good reason to fear that the policy of
alternate violence and inertia, against
which we have so often protested, has
at last inflamed the law-abiding animals
of Bobadig . . .”

“Communications with Bobadig have

they were not satisfied. And so, at
last, out of all the muddle and waste

created crises as men create matches,

created them :—
Extract from “The Slime,” April 3rd,
a paragraph in the Foreign Intelli-

“BobADIG, April 1st.
“A party of French mules, passing
to their quarters in the vilayet of Arima-

Military Mission. It is feared that
many of the mules were injured. Feel-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, May 10th-But for the pre-
sence of a handful of Irish Peers and
of Sir Edward CLARKE (looking little
older than when he pulverised GLAD-
sTone's second Home Rule scheme in
1893) you would never have
thought that this was the first
day in Committee of the Bill
“for the better government of
Ireland.” The Ulstermen were
on duty in full force, but the
bench on which the National-
ists are wont to sit was, like
their beloved country, “swarm-
ing with absentees.”
Lord HUGH CECIL, like Har-
lequin, smote everyone impar-
tially, one of his most telling
strokes being the remark that
the PRIME MINISTER could not
distinguish between the art of
winning an election and the
art of governing a country; but
otherwise his performance was
about on a par with that of
Mr. JAck Jones, who spoke
against the Amendment and
voted for it. Mr. BonAR LAw's
declaration that the Bill, how-
ever unacceptable to Ireland
at the moment, furnished the
only hope of ultimate settle-
ment, coupled with the Ulster leader's
promise that, much as he loathed the
idea of a separate Parliament, he would
work it for all he was worth, carried
the day. Mr. Asquith's Amendment
was knocked out by 259 to 55.
In subsequent Amendments, other
Members attempted to emphasise the
idea of ultimate union by calling the

“Parliaments,” and by setting up a
single Senate to control them both.
But they did not meet with acceptance.
Captain ELLIOTT thought the first as
absurd as the idea that you could make

gether, and Mr. Long dismissed the
second with the remark (which shows
how rapidly his political education has
advanced since the Parliament Act) that
he was in great doubt as to whether a
Second Chamber was in itself a pro-
tection for minorities.
Tuesday, May 11th.-Lord LoNDON-
DERRY moved the second reading of the
Air Navigation Bill. An important
part of the Bill relates to trespass or
nuisance by aeroplanes. The rights of
the property-owner usque ad colum
will obviously have to be considerably
modified if commercial aviation is to be
possible; but Lord MonTAGU entered a
caveat against accepting the provisions
if the hon. and gallant Member does
repeat it I shall not allow it to appear
on the Notice-paper.”
Another hon. Member wanted to know
why, if we were not helping the Poles,
we kept a British mission at Warsaw.
“Among other things,” replied Mr.
CHURCHILL, “to enable me to
answer questions put to me
here.” A third sought inform-
ation regarding the expendi-
ture of the Secret Service
money, and was duly snubbed
by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN with the
reply that if he answered the
question the Service would
cease to be secret.
The rejection of the Finance
Bill was moved by Mr. Bottom.
LEY. In his view the CHAN-
CELLOR was making a great
mistake in trying to pay off
debt, especially if it meant the
taxation of such harmless lux-
uries as champagne and cigars.
“Let posterity pay,” was his
motto. Still, if Mr. CHAMBER-
LAIN was determined to persist
in his foolish course, let him
give him (Mr. BottomLEy) a
free hand and he would guar-
antee to raise a thousand mil-
lions in a month. The best
comment on this oration was
furnished by Mr. BARNEs, who strongly
advocated a tax upon advertisements.
Wednesday, May 12th.-The pre-
valent notion that the only road a Scots-
man cares about is that which leads to
England cannot be maintained in face
of Lord BALFour's vigorous indictment
of the Ministry of Transport for its
neglect of the highways in his native
Clackmannan. The Duke of SUTHER.
of the Bill in this regard without close |=

man's house or property might, as he ->
said, constitute a serious nuisance.

garden-party and showering down |2%

The little coterie that is so nervously
anxious lest this country should do
anything to assist the Poles in their
attacks on the Bolshevists was par-
ticularly active this afternoon. Even
the SPEAKER's large tolerance is be-
ginning to give out. One of the gang

the people were not even allowed tele-

was real danger that the Highlanders

in the price of coal. Although it would
justify them in demanding a further
increase in their present inadequate
wage they did not believe it was neces-
sary or, at any rate, urgent. Sir Robert
HoRNE assured them that it was, and
that the present moment—the season
in happier days of “Lowest Summer
Prices"—had been selected as the least
inconvenient to the public.

A SMALL FARM.
To all of you who have begun to gaze
pensively at railway posters, to furrow
your brows over maps and guide-books,
or hover sheepishly about the inquiry
offices of Holiday Touring Agencies, I
would whisper: “Go to a small farm
and bask.”
You will note that I say a small
farm. A large farm has much that is
pleasant and pungent about it, but to
my mind you cannot bask properly on
a large farm. You are too much in the
way. The medley of barns, byres, styes,
rods, poles and perches is a hive of rest-
less energy. Unless you are walking
about with a bucket or prodding some-
thing with a stick you feel you have no
right to be there. On a large farm you
are expected to accompany your host
across a couple of ten-acre fields to look
at his young wheat. Some people can
tell what is the matter with a field of
young wheat by merely leaning on a
gate and glancing at it. Unless I can
feel its pulse or take its temperature I
cannot tell whether young wheat is
suffering from whooping-cough or nasal
catarrh. All I can do is to nod my
head sagely and say that, considering
the sort of Government we have got, it
looks pretty flourishing. Then my host
remarks that he has got a young bull
in Bodger's Paddock (about three miles
across country) that it will do my heart
good to see. That is the worst of a
large farm; anything you want is sure
to be several fields away from you.
Now at the small farm which I re-
commend, but the address of which I
am not going to give away, you may
lie and bask by the duck pond and be
quite in the picture. Further, if a
sudden irresistible desire for something
—a hoe or a cow, for example—should
come over you, you have only to put
out your hand and grab it. There is
a compactness about the place. They
do not put the cattle in odd fields five
miles apart, but leave them to lounge
round the duck pond or sit in the front
garden, where they can be collected
without effort. There are no energetic
squads of farm-labourers; no bustling
battalions of land-girls with motor-
plough attachments. The outdoor staff
is generally to be found sitting on a
bucket by the duck pond rubbing at a
bit of harness and looking decently
rural. When he has rubbed the har-
ness he stands up and looks at the
young wheat. Then he turns round
and glances at the mangel-wurzel field.
If the appearance of it displeases him
he reaches out for a rake and puts it
right. Then he sits on the bucket
again and has lunch.

[MAY 19, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BRIDGING THE LITERARY GULF.
(Famous Publisher's Great Scheme of
Reconciliation.)
HEARING on good authority that Mr.
Blinkingham, the well-known publisher,
was about to launch an enterprise of a
magnitude only comparable with that
of the Ency. Brit. or the D.N.B., Mr.
Punch hastened to headquarters for con-
firmation of the report, was graciously
admitted to his presence and furnished
with the following interesting details.
Mr. Blinkingham, it may be mentioned,
is at all points a finely equipped repre-
sentative of his class, handsome, well-
groomed and wearing his monocle with
distinction. His sanctum is furnished
with delightfully catholic taste—Louis
Quinze furniture, a Japanese embossed
wall-paper, pictures by BotticFLLI and
Mr. WYNDHAM LEWIs and statuettes of
PLATO, Woltaire and Mr. WELLs (the
Historian, not the Bombardier).
After some preliminary observations
on the deplorable condition of the pulp
industry, Mr. Blinkingham unfolded
his colossal scheme. “By way of pre-
face,” remarked the great literary im-
presario, “let me call your attention to
the momentous statement made by the
Editor of The Athenaeum in the issue
of May 7th : “We doubt whether there
has ever been a generation of men of
letters so startlingly uneducated as this,
so little interested in the study of the
great writers before them.' The Editor
of The Athenaeum takes a most gloomy
view of the situation, which is fraught
with an atmosphere of hostility and sus-
picion inimical to a revival of criticism.
Yet he sees in such a revival the only
way of salvation, the only means of heal-
ing the internecine feud which is now
convulsing the young literary world.
“For my own part I am convinced
that a better way is to lure back the
modernists to a study of great writers
by presenting them in a more palatable
form, not by compressing or abridging
them—for that has been tried before
—but by having them re-written in con-
formity with present-day standards by
eminent contemporary writers. This
notion had been germinating in m
head for some time past, but I did not
see my way clear until I read the
luminous and epoch-making remark of
Mr. C. K. SHORTER, that he would
sooner have written Tom Jones than any
book published thesetwo hundred years.
In a moment, in a flash, my scheme
took shape. ‘He shall write it, or rather
re-write it,' I said to myself, and I have
already submitted to this eminent man
of letters my rough scenario of the lines
on which FIELDING's novel should be
brought home to the Georgian mind.
gestion that the characters should be
rearranged on a Victorian basis, CHAR-
LoTTE BRONTÉ replacing Sophia,THACK-
ERAY Mr. Allworthy, while the title-
rôle should be assigned to an enter-
prising publisher. But I am not with-
out hope that he will adopt my plan.
“The revival of interest in the works of
RICHARDSON, the other great eighteenth-
century novelist, is, I think I may
safely say, a foregone conclusion. Miss
DoRoth Y RICHARDsoN has enthusiasti-
cally welcomed the proposition that she
should reconstruct the romances of her
illustrious namesake, and confidently
expects, on the basis of the method
employed by her in The Tunnel, that
she will be able to excavate at least a
hundred volumes from the materials
supplied in Sir Charles Grandison and
Clarissa Harlowe.
“Nor shall we overlook the earlier
masters. Professor CHAMBERLIN, whose
thrilling lectures on QUEEN ELIZABETH
and Lord LEICESTER have been the
talk of the town for the last fortnight,
has kindly undertaken to organise a
new variorum version of the Plays of
SHAKSPEARE, with the assistance of
Mr. Loos EY, the writer of the recently-
published and final work on the author-
ship of the plays. MILTON will be pre-
sented in both verse and prose, Mr.
MAs EFIELD having promised to re-write
his epic in six-lined rhymed stanzas,
shorn of Latinisms; while a famous
novelist, who does not wish her name
to appear at present, has consented to re-
cast it in the form of a romance underthe
title of The Miseries of Mephistopheles.
“Returning to the eighteenth century,
I am glad to be able to say that a bril-
liant reconstruction of Pope's Dunciad
is promised by the SITwell, family, in
which the milk-and-water school is held
up to ridicule, with TENNYson in the
place of dishonour formerly occupied
by THEOBAL.D. With a magnanimity
that cannot be too highly commended,
the staff of The Times has undertaken
to adapt another forgotten work under
the title of Grey's Eulogy, with special
reference to the work of the League of
Nations.
“I confess to feeling rather doubtful
as to the possibility of reviving any in-
terest in the works of Scott, DICKENS
and THACKERAY. They are at once too
near and too far. Still I hope to per-
suade Miss REBEccA WEST to try her
hand at Vanity Fair. Then there is
GEORGE ELIOT, another uncertain quan-
tity, though perhaps something might
be made of The Mill on the Floss if it
were renamed Tulliver's Travels, and
given an up-to-date industrial atmo-
sphere by Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT. I
have my eye on Mr. Lytton STRACHEY
modern version of Tom Brown's School-
days. At the moment he is too busy
with his Life of Queen Victoria, but I
feel sure he will not lightly abandon so
splendid an opportunity of unmasking
the pedantry and pietism of Dr. ARNOLD
and throwing the white light of truth
on ‘Rugby Chapel.’”

AT THE PLAY.
“WHY MARRY 2’’
THIS is a protracted discussion of a
venerable topic and takes place in a
sun-parlour, which I regret to say is
the brightest thing about it.
John is a dollar-snob—it is John's
parlour—and has two sisters, Jean and
Helen. John is easily the heavy-weight
champion in stage brothers. Sister
Jean, who is entirely dependent on
John, loves a poor man, but under
John's guidance traps a rich one. Sister
Helen (who has a job) also loves a poor
man, but thinks marriage not good
enough. This was, I imagine, due
chiefly to living with John and
Mrs. John. She may have got
a touch of the sun-parlour.
Her man is a terrific young
scientist, who once with four
colleagues deliberately let a
dangerous Cuban mosquito
nibble his arm. The colleagues
died while Ernest survived,
which I regretted. However he
became demonstrator at the
Institute of Bacteriology, with
Helen as his assistant, and in
the excitement of the imminent
discovery of his new bacillus
the two spend the night in
the laboratory totally unchap-
eroned. The discovery saved
thousands of American babes,
but it ruined Helen's reputa-
tion.
Here the narrative becomes
confused, but anyhow John,
who was a trustee of the In-
stitute, spent the three Acts in
alternately sacking and rein-
stating Helen and Ernest, in
thinking of a salary, doubling
it, adding thousands of dol-
lars to it and taking away the
salary first thought of, together with
the additions (and so da capo), according
as he wished to prevent the marriage
because of Ernest's poverty, or bring
it off because of Ernest's disposition to
take Helen to Paris (France) and dis-
pense with empty rites, or postpone it
to gain time, or, on the contrary, have
it celebrated between the dressing
and the dinner gongs in order to
announce it to important members of
the family, who, if I understood the
butler aright, had already fallen on
their food while host and hostess, two
pairs of lovers, Uncle Everett and
Cousin John were bickering in the sun-
parlour.
Cousin Theodore, a guileless and
dollarless clergyman, padded about on
the outskirts of the discussion, making
obvious remarks about the sanctity of
*
principles, which he promptly swal-
lowed. But it was Uncle Everett, the
judge (the only human figure in the
bunch), who grasped the fact (long after
I did, but let that pass) that the two
principal young egotists simply loved
being talked over at such gross length.
To put an end to the business he used
a trick whereby, apparently according
to the law of the unnamed State in
which the parlour was situate, the two
were legally married without intending
it. They had the tact to accept this
solution, and this softened my heart
towards them for the first time.
It was amusing to see Mr. AUBREY
SMITH wondering how on earth he had

got into this play, and Mr. A. E. GEOR3E
prowling about the stage intent appar-
ently on showing how many ways there
are of uttering “Pshaw!” and “Tut-
tut!” or noise to that effect. It isn't
as easy as it ought to be to do justice
to players playing impossible parts; to
Miss HENRIETTA WATson struggling
pluckily and skilfully with her Mrs.
John; or to Mr. CowLEY WRIGHT or Miss
Rosa LYND, so perfectly appalling did
Ernest and Helen seem to me and so
anxious was I to get them off to Paris
respectably or otherwise. They never,
by the way, gave me the ſaintest im-
pression that they could ever have done
work of any value in their laboratory.
I have no idea what the moral of
this modern mystery play may be, but
I did gather that the authoress was
seriously perplexed, not perhaps in any
culties of marriage and the conven-
tional hypocrisies that hedge round
that honourable institution, but just
forgot that serious argument cannot
easily be conveyed through the medium
of fantastically impossible and unin-
teresting people in an extravagantly
farcical situation. The play was kindly

I should certainly call Mr. CoMPTON MACKENZIE our first
living expositor of London in fiction. Indeed the precision
with which, from his Italian home, he can recapture the
aspect and atmosphere of London neighbourhoods is itself
an astonishing feat. In The Vanity Girl (CAssBLL) he has
happily abandoned the rather breathless manner induced
by the migratious Sylvia Scarlett, and returns to the
West Kensington of Sinister Street, blended subsequently
with that theatrical Bohemia in which Jenny Pearl danced
her little tragedy. There is something (though by no
means all) of the interest of Carnival in the new stage
story; that the adventures of Dorothy lack the compelling
charm of her predecessor is inevitable from the difference
in temperament of the two heroines and the fact that Mr.
MACKENzIE with all his art has been unable to rouse more
than dispassionate interest in what is really a study of
successful egotism. From the moment when, in the first
chapter, we encounter Dorothy (whose real name was
Norah) washing her hair at a window in Lonsdale Road,
an eligible cul-de-sac ending in a railway line, beyond
which a high rampart marked the reverse of the Earl's Court
Exhibition panorama, to that final page on which we take
leave of her as a widowed countess, sacrificing her future
for the sake of an Earl's Court of a different genre, her
career, sentimental, financial and matrimonial, is told with
appeal. It is perhaps an unequal book; in parts as good
as the author's best, in others hurried and perfunctory.
One of our more superior Reviews was lately debating Mr.
MACKENZIE's command of the “memorable phrase.” There
are a score here that I should delight to quote, even if the
setting is not always entirely worthy of them. : ,
So long as “BERTA Ruck” will write for us such pretty
books as Sweethearts Unmet (Hodder AND StoughTon),
we need never feel ourselves dependent on America for
our supply of sugary novels. This home-grown variety
is just as sweet, and really, I think, may be guaranteed not
only harmless but positively beneficial. The authoress has
evidently a tender pity for the young men and women whom
our social conditions doom either to have no companions
among their contemporaries or only the wrong ones. Her
heroine represents the too-much-sheltered girl alone in an
elderly circle, her hero the lonely young man who has no
means of getting to know people of his own sort (I can't say
class, because the authoress seems rather uncertain about
that herself). Her story is written in alternate instalments
by “the boy” and “the girl,” a method which encourages
intimacy in the telling as well as a sort of gushing attention
to the reader not so pleasant. Miss NorA SCHLEGEL has
drawn a pretty picture of Julia and Jack to adorn the
wrapper, and I can assure everyone who cares to know it
that they are just as nice as they look; Jack's passion
for abbreviation (“rhodos” for rhododendrons) being the

amazing vivacity but a rather conspicuous lack of emotional
only ground of quarrel I have with them or their creator.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
In Passion (Duckworth) Mr. SHAw DESMOND desperately
wants to say something terrific about love, money and
power. His violence makes one feel that one is reading
under a shower of brickbats, and it is the effort of dodging
these which perhaps distracts the mind from his message.
(Is he a Marinettist, I wonder?) . There are not enough
words in the language for him, so he invents fresh ones at
will; while as for grammar and syntax he passionately
throttled them in Chapter I. : nor did they recover. I will
own that notwithstanding all this the author has a way of
making you read on to find out what it is all about. You
don't find out; but there, life's like that, isn't it? The
author's ideas of the operations of high finance are ingenu-
ous. The Mandrill (do I rightly guess this to be a portrait
distorted from the life?), who is out to corner copper and “do
down" the Squid (head of the opposing copper group), is,
if you are to judge § his passionate exuberance at board
meetings, about as likely to corner the green cheese in the
the censorship still prevented anything like carping criticism
of matters near the battle-front, The Glory of the Coming
(HopDER AND Stoughton) naturally resolves itself into a
paean of praise of the French and British armies in general
and the American troops in particular, both white and black.
Mr. IRVIN S. Cobb brings good credentials to his task, for
he saw the advance of the German army through Belgium
in 1914, and in this book he describes the combined resist-
ance to their last great effort before defeat. The accident,
if we may so call it, to the Fifth Army has had nowhere a
more eloquent apologist. “They were like ants; they were
like flies,” he says of the Germans; “they left their dead
lying so thickly behind that finally the ground seemed as
though it were covered with a grey carpet.” There are
interesting strictures in the later chapters on some of the
quaint semi-official delegations and personages who per-
suaded the United States Government to let them come over
and visit the War; and there are a number of quite good
moon. I imagine the
author saying, “Mandrills
mayn't be like that, but
that's how I see 'em. It's
my vision and mood that
matter. Take it or leave
it.” Well, on the whole I
should advise you to take
it, first putting on a sort
of mental tin hat. You'll
at least have gathered
that Mr. DESMOND is a
lively writer.
Of a war-story reviewed
in these pages some
months ago I remember
taking occasion to say that
the author had damaged
his effect by a too obvious
wish to injure the repu-
tation of a certain cavalry
brigade (or words to that
effect). Well, a book that

I suppose the War did
throw up a great number of
worthy pomposities genu:
since its writer, Major
ARDERN BEAMAN, D.S.O., has admittedly intended it as a
vindication of the work of the cavalry in the Great War. I
can say at once that the defence could scarcely have found
a better advocate. Major BEAMAN (who, I think super-
fluously, figures in his own pages in the fictional character
of Padre) has written one of the most interesting records
that I have read of personal experience on the Western
Front. Partly this is explained by his fortunate possession
of a style at once sincere, sanely balanced and always
engaging. Also his story, apart from the matter of it,
reveals in the men of whom he writes (and incidentally in
the writer himself) a combination of just those qualities
that we like to call essentially British. Cavalrymen of
course will read it with a special fervour; but I am mis-
taken if its genial temper does not disarm even so difficult
a critic as the ex-infantry Lieutenant—than which I could
hardly say more. In short, The Squadroom is a belated
war book in which the most weary of such matters may
well recapture their interest.

country in some conspicuous and applauded way, and old Mr.
Thompson, the principal figure in Young Hearts (HopDER AND

Rose, as an East Riding variant of the type. He had always
some patent scheme for winning the War or improving the
Peace, and no doubt deserved all the ragging he got, though
I lost my zest in the matter before the author did. Mr.
Thompson had two daughters: a minx (almost too minx-like
for belief) and a never-told-her-love maiden of sterling worth.
The latter marries the good-young-man-under-a-cloud (the
cloud was, of course, a misapprehension or, alternatively, had
a silver lining), though the minx shamelessly tried to “bag
him,” as she did every eligible male, the good sister tamely
submitting under the impression apparently that the other
was a perfect darling. I indeed seemed to be the only
person who really understood what a little beast she was—
and possibly the author, who finally allotted to her the
beautiful unsatisfactory young man with the emotional
tenor. Commended for easy seaside reading.

THE VIRTUE THAT BEGINS AWAY FROM HOME
(as illustrated by an American sample of missionary
zeal).
IN Europe's hour of darkest night
That daunts the faith of sage and seer
I long to share the morning light
Diffused in yonder hemisphere;
There all is joy and radiance (just
As when on Eden first the sun rose),
Thanks to the Power that holds in trust
That legacy of Colonel Monroe's.
But out of those so halcyon skies
Chill blasts of disillusion blow
When I observe with pained surprise
The state of things in Mexico;
And “Why,” I ask, “in Heaven's name,
Can't ‘God's own country’ (U.S.A.) go
And, by the right none else may claim,
Put it across the dirty Dago?”
Then I reflect: “'Tis not so strange;
Some virtues best begin at home,
But others, of superior range,
Prefer to start beyond the foam;
There are who mend the ills at hand,
But those whose aims are even bigger
Seek out a far and savage land
There to convert the godless nigger.
“This chance, no doubt, distracts the Yank
From sinners at his very door; -
No local cure, he feels, can rank
With efforts on a distant shore;
His heart to Sinn Fein's gospel wed,
And by its beauty deeply bitten,
He sends his dollars forth to spread
The fear of hell in heathen Britain.”

LET me see. I must have been battling my way through
the Galleries step by step for an hour and three-quarters,
and I haven't yet decided which is the best picture.
But then it's no easy matter to make up one's mind when
there are so many, many pictures—and so many, many
people. . . . -
And some of them, I'm sorry to say, are not quite so
considerate as they might be. For instance, I had nearly
chosen - Mr. CLAUSEN's Shepherd Boy: Sunrise. I was
imagining the hush, the solitude. Suddenly two inexorable
hats were thrust between me and the canvas, while two in-
exorable voices carried on a detailed discussion about what
Doris (whoever Doris may be) was wearing at the wedding
yesterday.

STUNG to the quick by the accusation of secrecy hurled
at him by a portion of the Press in connection with the
conference at Lympne, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE has arranged
with M. MILLERAND, we understand, to make the next
encounter, on French soil, a vastly different affair. As a
delicate compliment to the Welsh blood shared by the
PRIME MINISTER and the greatest of our Tudor kings, and
through the courtesy of Sir PHILIP SAssoon who has
kindly promised to defray the whole of the expenses, the
mise en scène will be arranged to resemble, almost to the
minutest detail, the Field of the Cloth of Gold.
::: :: ::: :k :::
The place of meeting will be between Ardres and Guisnes.
Hundreds of skilful workmen, if they do not happen to be
on strike, will be employed in erecting the pavilions that
are to lodge the two statesmen, who will meet in open
field, but not be allowed, either of them, to visit the camp
of the other lest they be suspected of secret diplomacy.
M. MILLERAND and Mr. LLOYD GEORGE will first meet rid-
ing on horseback, and each wearing as much cloth of gold
and silver as can possibly be put upon their backs. Mimic
jousts and mock combats will be held. Lord DERBY, Lord
RIDDELL and Mr. PHILIP KERR will all encounter chosen
French champions. , Six days will be given to tilting with
the lance, two to fights with the broadsword on horseback,
two to fighting on foot at the barriers. Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
will wrestle with M. MILLERAND.

On the last day there will be a gorgeous masque, at which
the PRIME MINISTER will appear accoutred as Hercules, wear-
ing a shirt of silver damask, with a garland of green damask
cut into vine and hawthorn leaves on his head, and in his
hand a club with fourteen spikes. His Nemean lion skin
will be of cloth of gold, and his buskins of the same material.
Fountains of French wine will play in the British marquee.
M. MILLERAND's chief pavilion will have a magnificent dome,
sustained by one huge mast, covered with cloth of gold and
lined with blue velvet, with all the orbs of heaven worked
on it in gold, and on the top outside a hollow golden figure
of St. Michael. All the Press, but particularly those repre-
senting Lord NorthcLIFFE's papers, will be not only
allowed, but entreated and cajoled, to go everywhere and see
everything, to play about with the ropes of the tents and
take snippets of cloth of gold for souvenirs.

the choice of two courses, either to pur-
chase the cab outright and drive it your-
self, or to finish your journey by the
funicular railway.
Let us suppose that you have done
the latter and emerged on the final peak
which surmounts the Hampstead range.
On your way upwards you will have
been charmed by the number of pic-
turesque houses which seem to have
been thrown at the side of the hill and
to have stuck there, and also by the
luxuriant groves of cocoanut palms and
orange and banana trees which the
L.C.C. has thoughtfully planted to pro-
vide sustenance for London on its Whit-
suntide Bank Holiday. It is indeed a
working people are able on this day to
snatch a little leisure in the good old
English fashion on the swings and
roundabouts and forsake the weary
routine of watching American films.
These great crowds picnic also on the
greensward, bringing their food in
paper wrappers, so that a student of
such matters can easily gauge the pro-
portionate circulation of our principal
morning dailies by taking a walk
round Hampstead Heath early on Whit.
Tuesday morning.
When you have reached the last sum-
mit you will find yourself confronted
by a frowning Gothic pile known as
Jack Straw's Castle, and a large flag-
staff on which the flag is only flown
when the castellan is in residence.
There is also a pond where the inhabit-
ants of Hampstead, both old and young,
swim their dogs after sticks and float a
great variety of boats. On fine morn-
ings there is such a confusion of boats
and sticks and barking dogs that, if you
are lucky, you can come up with an
Irish terrier and an ash plant and go
down rather proudly with a Newfound-
land and the latest model of Sham-
rock XIV. -
Looking downwards from the top
you will discern on the open slopes and
twinkling amongst the vegetation a
vast multitude of white poles. On

are more poles on Hampstead Heath
than in the whole of Kieff. Each pole
is attached to a boy scout, and it has
been calculated that, if all the boy
scouts in Hampstead were to set their
poles end to end in a perfectly straight
line from the flagstaff, pointing in, a
south-easterly direction, they would be
properly told off by their scout-masters
for behaving in such an idiotic manner.
Next perháps in interest to the boy
scouts, both because of their quaint
mediaeval costume and the long lances
which they carry in their hands, are
the rangers of Hampstead Heath.
Feudal retainers of the L.C.C., they
sally ever and anon from their lairs
with lances couched to spear up the
pieces of paper which the people of
London have left behind; and this
paper-sticking is really the best sport
to be enjoyed now on Hampstead Heath,
unless one counts fishing for dace in
the ponds, which I take to be the most
contemplative recreation, except coal-
mining, in the British Isles.
Amongst the very many famous
people who either live or have lived at
Hampstead may be mentioned Mr.
GERALD DU MAURIER, CoNSTABLE, Lord
BYRON, Lord LEVERHULME, JoHN MASE-
FIELD, JoE BECKETT, the younger PITT,
Miss MARIE LLoyd, KEATs, Madame
PAvLovA, RoMNEY, CLAUDE DUVAL and
Richard TURPIN, the last of whom, I
believe, bequeathed his spurs to the
borough in grateful memory of all that
it had done for him. There are no high-
waymen to be met at Hampstead Heath
now, but the solicitor and house-agent
of the man from whom I am trying to
lease Number but there, perhaps
I had better not go into that just now.
I cannot however omit to say a few
more words about KEATs, because the
nation is trying to buy his house,
although it has not yet been decided
which of them is to live in it if they get
it. In the garden of this house the poet
is said to have written his celebrated
“Ode to a Nightingale,” and the night-
ingale may still be heard on Hamp-
stead Heath in June, Presumably it is
the same bird, and the lines,
“Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird;
No hungry generations tread thee down,”
must be taken as a remarkable instance
of literary foresight, for crowds of people
have for years been trying in vain to
trample the brave bird down and have
evidently been hungry, or they would
never have left so much sandwich-paper
about.
Oh, and there is yet one more notable
resident of Hampstead, as you have
doubtless just gathered, and that is
myself, or will be if those accurséd—

THE TARTAR PRINCESS.
SHE was staying at a Finnish hydro
near Helsingfors. I asked for her on
the telephone and her old mother an-
swered.
“Is it you, Monsieur Anatole? Fancy
ringing up so early—twelve o'clock'
Of course Tatiana is in bed. One can
see you have been away from your
native country a long time. We left
Petersburg three months ago. Come
and see us at a reasonable time—say
three o'clock—and we'll tell you all
about it.”
My two years' sojourn in England
had accustomed me to English ways.
I had certainly committed an indiscre-
tion in ringing up my former clients (I
was their legal adviser in Petersburg)
at such an unconscionable time.
I found Tatiana, in a smart black
glacé gown, reclining on a sofa and
smoking a cigarette in a dull sitting-
room, surrounded by other Russian
émigrés. She jumped up when she saw
in e.
“At last, Monsieur Anatole,” she
said. “You remember when you left
Petersburg in 1918 I told you that you
would be submarined, but here you are
back again safely. I'm so glad.” Her
eyes shone and she held out her little
white hand. “You have brought it
with you?” -
“What with me?” -
“The soap, of course. Surely you
remember. I asked you to buy me
some Savon Idéal in Paris. It is the
only kind that suits my skin.”
“But I haven't been to Paris.”
“You haven't brought my soap !
Why haven't you been to Paris?”
“I have been to London.”
She pouted. “Why stay in London
instead of Paris? What silliness!”.
“And how did you get here?” I
asked. - - - - - -
“By sledge. It was terribly exciting
and illegal, of course, and dangerous.
Petersburg's awful. All the pipes have
burst and there are no Russians there.”
“No Russians !” I exclaimed.
“Because the best people—I mean,
of course, the people who won't work—
have all adopted other nationalities.
We are—what are we, Mother?”
“I think it's Adgans, my dear,” the
old lady chimed in.
“Adgans,” I repeated.
“Something of that sort,” said the
Princess. “It doesn't matter about the
name, but it's more convenient. You
are under the protection of your Gov-
ernment and then your property bene-
fits.”
“Do you mean Azerbaijans ?” I
asked.
“But what claim have you to be-
come Azerbaijans?”
“Every claim,” she answered with
asperity. “Somebody had a property
there once—either one of our family
or a friend. Why don't your family
become Esthonians ? - You'd find it
much more convenient. Your father
could leave Petersburg.”
“But he's never been to Esthonia.”
“That's nonsense,” said Tatiana;
“he must have travelled through Reval
at some time, and besides I remember
he went to Riga once to fight a case
for the Government.”
“But Riga's in Latvia,” I protested.
“What does that matter? Anyhow
we escaped with two hundred thousand
roubles and one small trunk. The first
few weeks we had a great time here
and spent all our money, but after that
we had to “put our teeth on the shelf.’”
“But how did you manage without ||
money 2 ''
“Well, we sell our things—jewellery
and clothes. I think you might at least
have come back through Paris; I can't
understand how you forgot about the
soap. You've no idea what bad mani-
curists the Finns are; they've torn my
fingernails to bits.”
“But when you've sold all your ||
clothes and jewellery what do you in-
tend to do 2 " I asked.
Tatiana laughed. “Then there's
the house in Petersburg that will fetch
quite a lot of money, and there are a
number of people here who want it.”
“How can you sell a house to people
who can't get to it?” I asked.
Tatiana shrugged her shoulders. “Of
course I can sell it all the better because
they don't know the state it's in. I
think England must have made you
rather silly. You wrote and asked me
to lunch without my husband and you
know it's not done in Petersburg;
you've become quite English.”
“But last time we met you were just
divorcing the Count and I wasn't quite
sure of your relations with your new
husband.” - -
Tatiana kissed the tips of her fingers.
“He’s lovely l’” she cried enthusiasti-
cally. “A real Cossack officer. Why,
there he is Dmitré, this is Monsieur
Anatole, our family lawyer. He'll sell
the house for us, and he's promised
me some Savon Idéal from Paris.
You'll go to Paris, won't you?” she
said, putting a very seductive face close
to mine.
I parried.

“Oh, that's all right; you can become
a Czecho-Slovak. I can give you a
letter; you need only stay there half-
an-hour when you're passing through.”
“It's difficult for Rus-
ality slipping away and my only safety
seemed to lie in an instant departure.
I caught her hand and kissed her pol-
ished finger-tips. She bent forward and
kissed my forehead.
“Good journey,” she said.
“A happy time at home,” I answered,
and, saluting her husband, I hurried
to the door. -
“I’m glad there's a little bit of
Russian left in you,” she called after
me. “And by the way you might
bring two boxes of the soap; it doesn't
last long.”

“THEN you mean that neither of you is coming to the

“Speaking for myself,” said John, “the answer is in
the affirmative—or negative, just as you prefer. Any way,
I'm not coming. Your worthy brother must decide for
himself.”
“Our worthy brother-in-law has spoken for me, Margery,”
I said; “I also regret my inability to assist at the revels.”

village street. “At five o'clock,” she

“Who else will be present 2 " I

“No one,” she said.
I was never so puzzled in my life.
“It really seems rather odd,” said I,
“that we should meet alone at the
cross-roads. And it seems so romantic
too. At five o'clock, you said? I always
think that is such a sentimental hour.”

Vicar's wife's face.

said. “Perhaps I have not made my-

repeated; “and I think the prospect is

do the occasion all honour, I shall put
on my best mustard-coloured suit and
my new green Tyrolean hat—the one
with the feather in it.”
“I don't see why you should, simply
to meet the Countess of Aire.”
“But think of the romance of the
meeting,” I urged. “Just fancy! It
is to be at the cross-roads, perhaps
above the nameless grave of a suicide.
There I shall be waiting at five o'clock,
all dressed up in my mustard suit and
tremulous with excitement. And at
last there will dash up to the tryst-

silver-plated car, or the family coach
with prancing and foaming horses.
And there, at the cross-roads, we shall
have our little discussion; no speech-
making, all quite informal. Oh, I wish
it could have been moonlight !”
The Vicar's wife began to look quite
scared.
“Are you going mad?" she asked.
I went on wildly, saying just anything
by way of preserving my sanity, “I
remember that once, when I was quite
little, I half promised I would marry
this highly exalted person; we were
playing together as boy and girl in a
garden.”
“But the Countess of Aire,” cried the
Vicar's wife, “never was a girl.”
“And never was a boy either,” I
cried. ->
“The Countess of Aire,” screamed
the Vicar's wife—yes, she was fairly
screaming by now—“is a he.”
“Now that is absurd,” I said.
It was the Vicar, coming round the
corner in his usual hurry, as if every
day were a Sunday, who saved the sit-
uation by bumping into us both.
“The Countess of Aire,” shrieked his
poor wife, frantically clutching him by
the coat-tails, “is a man, isn't he 7"

Monday, May 17th.-In theory the
business of a Second Chamber is to
revise calmly and dispassionately the
legislation which has been scamped by
the First. In practice what happens
in our Parliament is that the Peers, after
killing time with academic debates for
two or three months, are suddenly called
upon, whenever a Recess is in con-
templation, to pass three or four Bills
through all their stages in as many days.
At the invitation of Lord CRAwFord
(Lord SALISBURY perfunctorily protest-
ing) they entered upon one of these
legislative spasms this afternoon, and
within less than an hour gave a second
reading to two Bills, and a third read-
ing to two others, besides listening
politely while Lord NEwTon (with him
Lord LAMINGTON) bewailed the sad fate

According to Sir RoßERT HoRNE the
price of a best quality worsted suit, as
made by a high-class tailor in this

eighteen guineas, and is still rising,

THE Great Eastern have inaugurated

goats—which is to traverse their system
for two months. The contents will be

who are interested in the breeding of
the lesser live-stock, apple-growing, etc.

he contrasted the activity of
the police in apprehending

criminals, Mr. ShortT gave
the figures of the motor-car

The rural districts, it may
be safely assumed, already

intensive culture applied to

[MAy 26, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PERFECT SCULLERY.
I was more than interested in the
article “About Bathrooms" which ap-
peared in the columns of Punch of
March 31st last, because I too always
smoke a pipe in a hot bath, to which I
add the habit of reading, not books—
they are too sacred to risk—but news-
papers. I also frequently indulge in
a further luxury at this time, a cup of
coffee, which rests on the sponge and
soap bridge between sips. Of course
the soap sometimes falls into the coffee,
and if this is undetected in time a
slight frothing at the mouth occurs, but
no really serious harm ensues.
I tried the effect of pictures round
the bath—pictures with a shiver in
them that made me pull the water up
closer round my neck. But I found
that they were being ruined by the
steam, so I removed them and am now
looking for some undraped but respect-
able statuettes that will give the same
result. - -
I have not tried the rich rug stunt.
The only rug we possess which might
be so described is a Persian one, and is
on our cat at present. When she has
done with it I intend to spread it over
the only part of the bathroom floor
which is permanently dry. And, suffer-
ing as our bathroom does from that
lack of space which the writer on bath-
rooms so justly laments, the “profound
chair" is out of the question.
While his views on bathrooms are
sound it seems evident to me that the
writer of the Punch article lives in pre-
war style—with servants. We don't.
Our last maid left us to be a Waac and
has not been seen since in the precincts
of domestic servitude. I did hear some-
thing about her approaching marriage
to a Colonel of Hussars, but don't know
whether it came off or not..
It seems to me that what is chiefly
wrong with houses, at any rate with
our house, is the scullery. It is smaller
than most bathrooms, and, though it
is anything but bare, the furnishings
of it are not intriguing to one who,
like myself, spends therein such an
undue proportion of the twenty-four
hours.
Our present char comes three days
a week, about eleven o'clock, has a look
round with a duster in one hand till
thirteen o'clock, then lunches and (pro-
bably) has a cigarette. She leaves at
fifteen o'clock. This means that I help
with the washing-up of the breakfast,
tea and dinner things on char days,
and of luncheon things as well on non-
char days. My share of the task is
generally the wiping. This is not such
an engrossing occupation as to prevent
the same time, thoughts worthy to be
committed to paper afterwards. Now,
as a song-writer, I ask how can one get
inspiration while gazing at a row of
saucepans, a cullender, a bottle of metal
paste, one ditto knife polish and a plate-
rack 2 -
If any room in the house should be
luxuriously furnished it is the scullery.
But what is even more important, I
think, is that the whole game of scullery-
ing should be revolutionised. The im-
plements still in use are worthy of the
Stone Age. The rules should be so
framed that there should be little or no
washing-up, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term. -
Let me put before you a pen-picture
of the scullery of my dreams. A cosy
pleasant room, the whole length of the
house in fact, with a south aspect, full
advantage of which is secured by a long
window filled with leaded lights of
opalescent glass (in order that the
Hilary-Tompkins next door, who have
two servants, may not grow too ribald).
On the western wall is a rich mosaic de-
picting Hercules cleansing the Augean
stable, and below this a fountain of
clear limpid water, warmed to at least
twenty over grease-proqf, gushes forth
*and flows in a pellucid stream, between
banks of marble, to the eastern end of
the chamber. At the fountain head
reclines Euphemia, my wife, arrayed
and fructed proper, who leisurely drops
the crockery into the stream. At the
other end of the room, seated in a
“profound chair” by the estuary, where
the waters of the River Plate fall into
the Sink Basin, behold me lazily watch-
ing the cups and platters as they glide
gently down the rippling flood towards
me, dexterously fishing out each fresh
arrival and depositing it in a hot-air
receptacle conveniently placed for its
accommodation.
Such, I say, is the scullery of my
dreams, in which the washing up of a
nine-hole-course dinner would be as
pleasant as a round of golf. No un-
sightly pots, pans, brooms, tins or
other junk pollute the apartment; they
are in the dream ante-chamber, to be
hereinafter described or not, if the
Editor sees fit. [ED.—He does not see
fit.]
Shakspeare and Mr. Charles Chaplin.
Mr. CHARLEs CHAPLIN writes from Los
Angeles protesting against the allega-
tion, made in our issue of March 31st,
that “he does not like SHAKSPEARE.”
Mr. Punch cannot accept responsibility
for a statement quoted from the report
of an interview, but he has no hesitation
in expressing his profound regret for any
wrong that he has inadvertently done
THE GREAT DIWORCE QUESTION.
WHEN I week-end with people I like
them to be tactful. I thought Mrs.
Benham lacked the tact essential to a
hostess when she said, “We breakfast
at half-past nine on Sundays. That
will give us all ample time to get to
church.” She never seemed to contem-
plate the possibility of my having a
Sunday morning indisposition.
Now there is no virtue in compulsory
church-going, but as I was for it I
accepted my fate cheerfully. I walked
with Benham across the park to the
church. He is the adopted Candidate
for the division, and he took the oppor-
tunity of rehearsing to me a speech he
was preparing which showed up Bolsh-
evism in its true colours. Though no
Sabbatarian I have the deepest objec-
tion to political speeches on a Sunday,
and it was really a relief when I reached
the gracious refuge of the church.
The family pew was a little too near
the pulpit, but it was most comfortable.
When the sermon came on I settled
myself in a restful corner to listen to
the Archdeacon. After a moment or
two I felt he was on sound orthodox
lines and needed no supervision of
mine. I leant back and gradually dozed
off.
Then in my sleep I became aware of
a stern voice disapproving of something.
It seemed to me that Benham was at a
public meeting denouncing Bolshevism
to a very lethargic audience. It was
my bounden duty to support my host.
“Hear, hear! Hear, hear!” I said
most emphatically.
I woke up just as the last “Hear’
left my lips. The choir-boys were
sniggering—you can always trust them
to do that. A large curate was eyeing
me as if I were something between a
leper and a dissenter. Mrs. Benham
was looking indignantly down the pew
at me; Benham was tactfully but in-
effectively pretending not to have heard
anything.
I went hot all over. What could I
do? Should I be prosecuted for brawl-
ing in church? Could I possibly explain
to the Archdeacon that I spoke in my
sleep, and therefore was not responsible?
There are some explanations that aggra-
vate an offence.
There came a terrible moment when
the service was over. The Archdeacon
stepped deliberately towards our pew.
I was tempted to bolt through a stained-
glass window. And then, as he came
near, he beamed on me.
“Don’t apologise, my dear Sir, don't
apologise. If you were so moved by
the picture I drew of the inroads the
new Divorce Law would make on the
one from thinking great thoughts at
sanctity of our homes why should you

MAGNANIMOUS MOTTOES.
A writeR in The Evening Standard
calls attention to the latest ornamenta-
tion of the fine old Elizabethan Hall of
Gray's Inn, in the shape of the arms of
Lord BIRKENHEAD, who as a past Trea-
surer of the Inn is entitled to this
armorial distinction in his lifetime.
But, he goes on, “it was not so much
the arms as their motto which attracted
me—the motto of a man who began his
brilliant career as plain Mr. F. E. SMITH.
Now the Latin for ‘smith,' as an arti-
san, is faber (artificer or fabricator
in the primal sense); so, with a fine
democratic courage, Lord BIRKENHEAD
has chosen as his family motto: ‘Faber
wned Fortuna' (Architect of my own
We agree; but it must not be sup-
posed that Lord BIRKENHEAD has an
entire monopoly of this frank spirit.
Other eminent men who have recently
been ennobled or decorated have shown
a similar frankness. Thus it may not
| be known that Lord RIDDELL has
adopted a motto which reveals the
comparatively modest beginnings of
his greatness. Lord RIDDELL was, and
we believe still is, the proprietor of The
News of the World. Now the Latin
for news or newness is novitas (novelty
or unfamiliarity in the primal sense);
so with a noble democratic courage he
has chosen as his family motto: “Saccul-
orum vetustati praestat novitas mundi"
(The news of the world surpasses the
antiquity of the ages). It is rather a
long motto, but it is eminently Cicer-
onian in its cadence.
Then there is the case of Lord North-
cLIFFE, who began his brilliant career
as simple Mr. HARMsworth. Now the
Latin for “harm" is damnum (loss or
sacrifice in the primal sense), and for
“worth” dignus. So, with a fine loyalty
to his antecedents, Lord NorthcLIFFE
has adopted the heroic and pleasantly
alliterative motto: “Per damna ad
dignitatem " (Through sacrifices to
worthiness).
Even more ingenious is the motto
chosen by Lord BEAVERBRook, who
began his coruscating career as a native
of New Brunswick. Now the Latin for
“beaver” is castor (not to be confounded
with the small wheels attached to the
legs of arm-chairs), and in Greek myth-
ology Castor was the brother of Pollux,
who was famed as a boxer. “Boxer”
is a synonym for “prize-fighter";
“prize-fighter" recalls “WELLs”;
“wells” contain “water,” and “water"
suggests “brook.” So Lord BEAVER-
BROOK, with a true allegiance to Canada,
coupled with a scholarly mastery of the
niceties of Classical etymology, has
chosen for his family motto: “E Castore
Pollua,” (Brook from the Beaver).
THE DEVIL IN DEVON.
THE Devil walked about the land
And softly laughed behind his hand
To see how well men worked his will
And helped his darling projects still,
The while contentedly they said:
“There is no Devil; he is dead.”
But when by chance one day in Spring
Through Devon he went wandering
And for an idle moment stood
Upon the edge of Daccombe wood,
Where bluebells almost hid the green,
With the last primroses between,
He bit his lip and turned away
And could do no more work that day.

BUT, MARK My
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE has recently been a notable output of books of
“personalities” and critical appreciations, contemporary,
historical and (for the most part) iconoclastic. One may
therefore say that Mr. HoRACE G. HUTCHINsoN is distinctly
of the movement in compiling his Portraits of the 'Eighties
(UNWIN). This is certainly a volume that anyone can dip
into with instruction and entertainment, even if (to be quite
honest) the former is likely to predominate. The fact
is that one has become so used to the satirical method in
portraiture, in which the attack is all and the subject
emerges only as a beriddled target, that an ordinary pen-
picture, however faithful, is apt to seem heavy by contrast.
Mr. HUTCHINsoN certainly is not of the slingers; he will just
“tell you about" the notable persons of his period, setting
down nothing in malice, omitting little however banal, and
rejecting no aphorism or anecdote as outworn, Perhaps his
nearest approach to the popular method is a very occasional
touch of gentle irony, as when he permits himself to say of
G. W. E. Russell, (to whose Portraits of the Seventies the
present volume is intended as a sequel) that he “used to
drive about London in a carriage picked out in colours that
did not suggest that he sought seclusion.” I have no
space for the barest list of the sitters in Mr. HUTCHINSoN's
crowded picture of a time rich in character, his treatment
intimacy of detail. To mention but one, it is interesting
to compare his General Gordon with the recent present-
ment of him by another hand. If the result is more
creditable to Mr. Hutchinson's kindliness than to his wit,
it may serve as an apt comment on the whole book.
Beauty and Bands (CoNSTABLE) is not, as you might
excusably suppose, a treatise on syncopation or the decline
of Jazz, but takes its title from a verse in the Book of
Proverbs. Really what the story most illustrates is the
extent to which a clever and experienced writer can clothe
a wildly impossible plot with some aspect of reality. Miss
ELLEN THoRNEYCROFT Fowler assuredly does not lack
courage; having thought out a “good situation" (which it
certainly is) she was not going to be put off by any con-
siderations of probability. I can't resist some sketch of it,
even at the risk of spoiling your pleasure. Suppose a lovely
but selfish wife, bored to the point of flight from a well-
intentioned husband, then involved in a railway smash
which disfigures her beauty, destroys her memory and inci-
dentally reforms her character; let her by plausible circum-
stance be mistaken for another traveller in the wrecked
train and under a new name and personality meet her
husband, fall in love with him, but be compelled to reject
his suit by the presumption that his vanished wife may
still be living—as I hinted, the result in sit...ations is enough
to satisfy the most exacting, the only real drawback being

of which aims rather at covering a wide ground than at
that not all Miss Fowler's pleasantly persuasive efforts can

make me believe a word of it. If she had dared a little
more, and inflicted the husband with blindness, impaired
hearing and slight mental decay, I would have stretched
a point and supposed that, during a protracted courtship,
he might never have recognised his own wife. Lacking
these concessions I can only report an entertaining but
preposterous absurdity.
Those of us who read With the Persian Erpedition know
something about the Hush-Hush Army; enough, at any
rate, to whet our appetites for more. Let me then recom-
mend The Adventures of Dunsterforce (ARNoLD) to your
notice, and assure you that it is a most lively account of
as strange an enterprise as any that the War brought
forth. Briefly, the object of General DUNSTERVILLE's
mission was to prevent German and Turkish penetration
in the area of the Caucasus, Baku and the Caspian Sea. In
while the historic fight between Carmania, in Prussian
blue, and Cap Trafalgar, mostly crimson, competes for
lurid splendour with the Mauretania in “dazzle” costume,
staged with a sky to match. Incidentally Mr. ARCHIBALD
HURD has acted as showman for the collection. One might
have found his exposition rather more substantial but for
Sir JULIAN CoRBETT's first volume of Naval Operations,
which has set an uncomfortably high standard in sea
history. Frankly, the deeds of the men of our merchant
fleets, of the Cunarders no less than others, were so magni-
ficent that a book to be worthy of them must be in itself as
modest and unpretentious as they were. This book is not.
The Tall Tilla (CoLLINs), by “LucAs MALET,” has a
strange theme—no less than the deliberate wooing, by a
sensitive unhappy woman, of a more unhappy ghost. Lord
Orley had lived in this odd villa on Primrose Hill a hundred
January, 1918, he set
out from Baghdad with
what he calls “the lead-
ing party.” Continually
hampered by lack of
men, the mission failed
to achieve its original
object; but what it ac-
complished in most
difficult circumstances
was of great value to
the Allies. The condi-
tions at the time when
the author sailed from
Enzeli with his “Dun-
sterforce " to raise the
siege of Baku were de-
lightfullycosmopolitan.
He describes himself as
“a British General on
the Caspian, the only
sea unploughed before
by British keels, on
board a ship named
after a South African

adds, “pick his way through that delirious tangle, and

In A Merchant Fleet at War (CASSELL) it takes nearly a
hundred pictures to illustrate the fighting effort and ex-
periences of the Cunard Steamship Company. Quite a lot
of them are from snap-shot photographs actually taken
while in action with submarines, and where through an
unfortunate oversight these have not been available some-
one with vivid brush and imagination has done wonders to
fill the gap. Certainly such a subject as the passing of the
Lusitania, her decks still packed though her great bulk is
three-quarters gone, the sea crowded with boats and, pre-
sumably, drowning Englishmen, is perhaps a little poignant
to be handled in this fashion; but no one can object to
seeing a U-boat nose-diving at the instance of S.S. Phrygia,
four portraits—Frances herself, the adorable Lady Lucia her
cousin, Charlie Montagu the passionate bounder, and, a little
less definite, Morris Copley the stockbroking husband.
Messrs. HopDER AND SToUGHToN have beaten up various
American magazines and shepherded a few Waifs and Strays
of short stories by the late “O. HENRY " (WILLIAM SYDNEY
PortFR) into a final volume of their excellent edition of
his works. They have also included appreciations by
various American and British critics of the author's
achievement, together with some sparse biographical details.
The stories are of varying value, exercises on a sentimental
motive cloaked by humorous or bizarre exaggeration of
language, with those unexpected but ingeniously plausible
endings which are of the essence of “O. HENRY's" method.
Of the criticisms, English readers will be most affected
by Mr. STEPHEN LEAcock's “The Amazing Genius of
O. HENRY,” an analytical appreciation in the most hand-
some terms, deploring English neglect of this master of
one of the most difficult of art-forms—a neglect which we

have done something of late to remedy.

oDYSSEUS AT THE DERBY.
[Racing men will not need to be reminded that Polumetis (many-
counselled) is named after a common epithet of the hero of the Odyssey.]
At times the pulse of memory is stirred
Out of a chronic state of coma
By just a poignant tune, a rhythmic word,
A whiff of some refined aroma,
And lo! the brain is made aware
Of records which it didn't know were there.
So in a sudden moment I was shot
Back to my boyhood and the highly
Instructive works of HomeR, long forgot,
And with the late Odysseus (wily)
Ploughed once again the wine-red deep
On drawing Polumetis in a sweep.
Oh, “many-counselled ” hero! if a horse
Your attributes may also borrow,
Lend him your cunning round the Derby course,
Teach him a thing or two to-morrow,
That at the end it may be said:
“He did a great performance with his head.”
As you contrived by tricks of crafty skill
Ever to down your foes and flatten 'em,
So may he lie low going up the hill,
Secure the inside berth at Tattenham,
And do a finish up the straight
Swift as your shafts that sealed the suitors' fate
Fortune attend his name, though some deplore
Its pedantry, and I assume it is
Likely, from what I know of bookies' lore,
That on the rails he'll be “Poloometis";

How they pronounce him, if he only wins. O. S.
THE SERENE BATSMAN.
IT is a common fallacy among cricketing coaches and their
pupils that when the young batsman has mastered all the
strokes that can be imparted to him at the nets his educa-
tion is complete. So far from that being the case, it has
barely begun. Under the prevailing system, the psycholo-
gical factor, the most important of all, is entirely neglected.
The most trying moment of a cricketer's life is when he first
steps forth alone from the pavilion of a public ground. In
that moment all that the old pro has taught him of cuts and
drives, forward play and back play, will not prevent his knees
from weakening as he totters to the wicket, whereas the
following hints may enable him to face the occasion with
confidence if not contempt.
Remember that for a public performer a good entrance
is more than half the battle; the first impression on the
spectators is the most lasting.
Nothing looks worse than a batsman hurrying out at a
furtive trot, as if he were going to pawn his bat. When
your turn comes to go in, take care to be just within the
regulation two minutes, but school yourself to emerge from
the pavilion at a leisurely stride with more than a suspicion
of swagger in it. The bat should not be carried as a shy
curate carries a shabby umbrella, but either boldly across
the shoulder, like a rifle, or tucked under the armpit, so that
you may do up your batting-gloves in your progress across
the greensward. An excellent effect will be produced if
you pause half-way and execute a few fancy strokes at an
imaginary ball. Besides, you may not have another oppor-
tunity of displaying your accomplishment.
a good plan to discover that you need a new batting-glove.
This will afford you an excuse for a return journey to the
pavilion, during which your gait will lose nothing in stateli-
ness if you can manage to adopt the goose-step. On your
return to the wicket you will probably find, if the weather
is mild and the grass dry, that the fieldsmen are reclining
on the ground; it will enhance your reputation for non-
chalance and good-fellowship if you can contrive to give one
of them a playful pat with your bat in passing, especially
if he is a total stranger to you and much your senior.
On your second arrival at the wicket, you might get the
wicket-keeper to take his gloves off and adjust the straps of
your pads. This is one of many subtle ways of demoralising
the fielding side and whetting the interest of the onlookers.
After taking middle with such scrupulous exactitude as
to imply that you suspect the umpire's eyesight, take one
of the bails and scratch a block deep enough to plant
something in. Then beckon to the square-leg umpire to
come and replace the bail. In this you will be strictly
within the law, and nobody can suspect you of the surrep-
titious use of a little cobbler's wax.
Your next move should be to summon the other batsman
to a whispered conference in the middle of the pitch. It
doesn't much matter what you say to him; a new funny
story or the plot of a play you saw last week will serve to
make him assume an air of thoughtful attention.
After a chat of about five minutes, you will return slowly
to your crease, there to scrutinise the slip fieldsmen, and
then to gaze all round the ground as if to make sure that
the other side is not playing more than eleven men.
When taking your stance you will do well to give full
effect to some such mannerism as Mr. WARNER's trick of
hitching up the left side of the trousers and tapping the
ground seven times. And just as the bowler is about to
start his run you can disconcert him by suddenly whipping
round to see if they have moved another man over to the
leg side while your back was turned.
As soon as the bowler has covered half his course to the
wicket you should raise your hand to arrest his career.
Then you must stroll about a third of the way up the pitch
and give the ground a good slapping with the face of
your bat.
If you feel so inclined, there is no reason why you should
not repeat this manoeuvre. Nothing is more calculated to
upset a highly-strung bowler. And when the ball does
come down the chances are that it will be a wide, in
which case you will have earned one run for your side.
If, on the other hand, it should happen to knock your
middle stump out of the ground, there is nothing more to
be done, but you will have the satisfactory feeling that your
little turn in the limelight has not been utterly inglorious.

THE RISE AND FALL OF
AM.ATEUR EXAMINER.
THE Nabobs is, I suppose, one of the
best girls' schools in England. Any-
how it is perhaps the most exclusive
unless you have money enough. But,
as the prospectus says, “it commands
an extensive view of the English
Channel,” and I suppose these things
have to be paid for. At all events there
is no doubt that the principal, Miss
Penn-Cushing, has her heart in her
work and is a splendid disciplinarian,
and so I sent my niece Mollie there to
be finished (her mother being in India).
I have an idea at times that it is
Mollie who will finish Miss Penn-
Cushing, but I try to preserve a bene-
volent neutrality combined with a regu-
lar supply of food parcels to my niece.
Miss Penn-Cushing is LL.A. of one
University and LL.B. of another, and,
I think, LL.C. of a third, so that she
ought to be more than a match for six
Mollies.
I have always had the impression
that Miss Penn-Cushing regarded me
as a humble entomological specimen
until the other day when she paid me
a staggering compliment. She herself
AN
her academy, and each class in turn
goes up to her room to receive its daily
dose. Mollie says that when she grows
up she is going to give up English
literature for ever and read something
interesting.
I am glad that the revered Principal
is never present to hear Mollie's blas-
phemies, at which I as an uncle have
to shudder. Since the publication of
The Cambridge History of English
Literature Miss Penn - Cushing has
been steadily absorbing it, to help her
in her daily task, and has apparently
reached the chapter in which is suit-
ably acknowledged the debt of English
literature to Punch.
So at least I judge, for she gave the
girls a long serious talk on humour in
literature, how to detect it and what
should be done about it. One rather
sensitive child began to cry, but Mollie,
who has never kept a secret in her life
and in fact loves to drag her uncle's
skeletons out of cupboards, blurted out,
“Uncle writes for Punch / "
I was somewhat alarmed when I
heard of this, for I did not know how
Miss Penn-Cushing, who keeps all the
girls' uncles in order, might take it.
My fears were groundless, perhaps
invitation to examine Mollie's form in
literature at the forthcoming Christ-
mas examination. I felt uplifted in
spirit; I felt that people were beginning
to understand me. I even entertained
an hallucination that perhaps Mollie
might now treat my intellect with
respect and stop calling me “Old dear.”
Three inches taller I sat down to my
desk and, thanking Miss Penn-Cushing
for the honour paid me, I promised I
would do my best, although it would
be my first appearance in the rôle.
I determined, however, not to allow
this distinction to make me overbearing
to my inferiors at our next speech-day.
I would be affable to ordinary uncles,
common parents and guardians of the
other girls, but I would lead the con-
versation artfully on to other literary
critics and examiners of the past. As
a preparation I read up MATTHEw
ARNoLD.
It is not easy to be an examiner, I
found. I would rather write ten lead-
ing articles than one examination-paper.
It appeared that I had to set themes for
essays as well as questions in litera-
ture. We never learnt literature when
I was young and I didn't know you
could, but I borrowed a text-book from

The result was a crushing letter
from the lady principal. She said that
“The Ten Points of a good Doll"
seemed a preposterous subject for senior
students of literature to write about,
and “My Favourite Elopement in Fic-
tion " would be outside the purview of
any of her girls. She would substitute
instead (with my permission), “The
Debt of Literature (as well as Science)
to DARwiN " and “My Favourite Piece
of Epic Poetry.” In fine, if I did not
really mind, she would herself set all
the questions and I should examine the
answers. She thought that the more
fructiferous course.
How to mark was my chief difficulty.
How many marks should one give a
darling with brown eyes and a musical
laugh (Mollie has brought her to tea
often) who signs herself “Norah
O'Brien,” and winds up delightful irre-
levances about DARWIN and her abhor-
rence of reptiles with a personal appeal
to the examiner. I do not know what
other examiners do in such cases. It
was a beautifully worded and most re-
spectful appeal. I decided to give her
forty for Norah and forty for O'Brien.
Both names have always appealed to ||
Ine.
This made it necessary for me to give
eighty marks to her sister Kathleen, |
who wrote really an excellent essay on
a subject we had stupidly forgotten to
set. It was an excellent subject, and
she has even browner eyes than Norah,
but as an examiner one must be rigid
and impartial.
Eunice came next. This name re-
called dear memories of the past and of
what might have been. But as an ex-
aminer I could not let old dreams weigh
down my impartial scales, so I refused
to give her more than eighty. Finally,
for they are really charming girls and
know far more about literature than I
do, I gave eighty to everybody except
Mollie, and for being Mollie I gave her
eighty-two.
I forgot. There was one perſectly
horrid little girl called Katie de Pin-
nock. She never shared her chocolates
with anyone; the fact was notorious.
She wrote in a copperplate hand senti-
ments like these: “MILTON awes me;
SHELLEY thrills me; BLAKE, the pro-
phet of self-sacrifice, is ever my conso-
lation and my guide. I ask for nothing
beyond.” I gave her nineteen.
And now comes the tragedy. Miss
Penn-Cushing's letter of thanks was
icy. She feared I had been “a thought
nepotic,” and (with my permission) she
would revise my marks.
She dealt me the final blow at our
Speech-Day. “I have decided,” she

[JUNE 2, 1920.
THE ART OF POETRY.
I.
MANY people have said to me, “I
wish I could write poems. I often try,
but ” They mean, I gather, that
the impulse, the creative itch, is in
them, but they don't know how to
satisfy it. My own position is that I
know how to write poetry, but I can't
be bothered. I have not got the itch.
The least I can do, however, is to try to
help those who have.
A mistake commonly committed by
novices is to make up their minds what
it is they are going to say before they
begin. This is superfluous effort, tend-
ing to cramp the style. It is permis-
sible, if not essential, to select a subject
—say, MUD–but any detailed argument
or plan which may restrict the free de-
velopment of metre and rhyme (if any)
is to be discouraged.
With that understanding, let us now
write a poem about MUD.
I should begin in this sort of way:--
Mud, mud,
Nothing but mud,
O my God!
It will be seen at once that we are
not going to have much rhyme in this
poem ; or if we do we shall very soon
be compelled to strike a sinister note,
because almost the only rhymes to
mud are blood and flood; while, as the
authors of our hymns have discovered,
there are very few satisfactory rhymes
to God. They shamefully evaded the
difficulty by using words like road, but
in first-class poetry one cannot do that.
On the whole, therefore, this poem had
better be vers libre. That will take
much less time and be more dramatic,
without plunging us into a flood of
blood or anything drastic like that.
We now go on with a little descriptive
business:—
Into the sunset, swallowing up the sun,
Crawling, creeping, -
The naked flats—
Now there ought to be a verb. That
is the worst of vers libre ; one gets
carried away by beautiful phrases and
is brought up suddenly by a complete
absence of verbs. However at a pinch
one can do without a verb; that is the
best of vers libre:–
Amber and gold,
Deep-stained in mystery
And the colours of mystery,
Inapprehensible,
Golden like wet-gold,
Amber like a woman of Arabia
That has in her breast
The forsaken treasures of old Time,
Love and Destruction,
Oblivion and Decay,
And bully-beef tims,
Tin upon tin,
Old boots, and bottles that hold no more
Their richness in them.
We might do a good deal more of
this descriptive business, bringing in
something about dead bodies, mud of
course being full of dead bodies. But
we had better get on. We strike now
the personal note:–
And I,
I too am no more than a bottle,
An empty bottle,
Heaving helpless on the mud of life,
Without a label and without a cork,
Empty I am, yet no man troubles
To return me.
And why?
Because there is not sixpence on Inc.
Bah
The sum goes down in the West
(Or is it the East 2)
But I remain here,
Drifting empty under the night,
Drifting—
When one is well away with this
part of the poem it is almost impossible
to stop. When you are writing in
metre you come eventually to the
eighth line of the last verse and you
have to stop; but in vers libre you
have no assistance of that kind. This
particular poem is being written for
instructional purposes in a journal of
limited capacity, so it will probably
have to stop fairly soon; but in practice
it would go on for a long time yet. In
any case, however, it would end in the
same way, like this:—
Mud, mud,
Nothing but mud,
O, my God!
That reasserts, you see, in a striking
manner, the original motif, and some-
how expresses in a few words the poig-
nant melancholy of the whole poem.
Another advantage in finishing a long
poem, such as this would be, in the same
way as you began it is that it makes it
clear to the reader that he is still read-
ing the same poem. Sometimes, and
especially in cers libre of an emotional
and digressive character, the reader has
a hideous fear that he has turned over
two pages and got into another poem
altogether. This little trick reassures
him; and if you are writing vers libre
you must not lose any legitimate
opportunity of reassuring the reader.
To treat the same theme in metre
and rhyme will be a much more diffi-
cult matter. The great thing will be
to avoid getting mud at the end of a
line, for the reasons already given. We
had better have long ten-syllable lines,
and we had better have four of them
in each verse. GRAY wrote an elegy
in that metre which has given general
satisfaction. We will begin —
As I came down through Chintonbury Hole
The tide rolled out from Wurzel to the sea.
In a serious poem of this kind it is
essential to establish a locality atmo-
sphere at once; therefore one mentions
important.
has been there. If the reader has been
there too he will like the poem, and if
he hasn't no harm is done. The only
thing is that locally Chintonbury is
probably pronounced Chun'bury, in
which case it will not scan. One can-
not be too careful about that sort of
thing. However, as an illustration
Chintonbury will serve.
It is now necessary to show somehow
in this verse that the poem is about
mud; it is also necessary to organise a
rhyme for ‘Hole' and a rhyme for
‘sea,' and of the two this is the more
I shall do it like this:—
And like the unclothéd levels of my soul
The yellow mud lay mourming nakedly.
There is a good deal to be said against
these two lines. For one thing I am
not sure that the mud ought to be yel-
low; it will remind people of Covent
Garden Tube Station, and no one wants
to be reminded of that. However, it
does suggest the inexpressible bilious-
ness of the theme.
I think “levels” is a little weak. It
is a good poetical word and doesn't
mean anything in particular; but we
have too many words of that kind in
this verse. “Deserts” would do, except
that deserts and mud don't go very well
together. However, that sort of point
must be left to the individual writer.
At first sight the student may think
that “nakedly" is not a good rhyme
for “sea.” Nor is it. If you do that
kind of thing in comic poetry no editor
will give you money. But in serious
poetry it is quite legitimate; in fact it
is rather encouraged. That is why
serious poetry is so much easier than
comic poetry. In my next lecture I
shall deal with comic poetry.
I don't think I shall finish this poem
now. The fact is, I am not feeling so in-
spired as I was. It is very hot. Besides,
I have got hay-ſever and keep on sneez-
ing. Constant sneezing knocks all the
inspiration out of a man. At the same
time a tendency to hay-fever is a sign
of intellect and culture, and all the
great poets were martyrs to it. That
is why none of them grew very lyrical
about hay. Corn excited them a good
deal, and even straw, but hay hardly ever.
So the student must finish this poem
as best he can, and I shall be glad to
consider and criticise what he does,
though I may say at once that there
will be no prize. It ought to go on for
another eight verses or so, though that
is not essential in these days, for if it
simply won't go on it can just stop in
the middle. Only then it must be
headed “MUD : A Fragment.”
And in any case, in the bottom left-
hand corner, the student must write:

ELIZABETH'S TIP FOR THE DERBY.
“TALKIN' o' the Derby,” began Eliza-
beth.
As a matter of fact I was not talking
of the Derby or even thinking of it at
the moment. I had just been telling
Elizabeth that the omelette which she
had served us at dinner was leathery,
and her remark struck me as irrelevant.
“Master thinks the omelettes would
be lighter if you fried them in more
butter,” I continued. Of course Master
had thought nothing of the kind. But
nowadays complaints must be conveyed
to domestics in this indirect way.
Elizabeth ignored the omelette. “I'm
goin' to win fifty pounds at least,” she
exclaimed, and in her excitement broke
the cup she held—I mean to say the
cup came in two in her hand as she
Elizabeth may not have charm but
she certainly has simplicity. “You
don't mean to say,” I cried, a light
breaking on me, “that you got your
next month's wages in advance just to
ut it all on a horse?”
“That I did,” she replied complacent-
ly. “You see, my young man ses that,
if you put it on some time before'and,
you get a better price, so I thort I’d
give it to 'im to put on at once... 'E
promised 'e wouldn't waste a minnit
over it.”
“But this is most foolish of you—to
trust your money to an entire stranger,”
I expostulated.
“’E isn't a stranger—'e's my young
man,” corrected Elizabeth, tossing her
head.
Who Never Came Back.” He romped
out of Elizabeth's existence on the Sun-
day preceding the Derby.
“I waited for 'im four-an'an-'arf 'ours,
an' 'e didn't turn up,” she informed me
next day.
“Perhaps he was prevented from
keeping the appointment,” I suggested
to comfort her, though I felt the out-
look was gloomy.
... She shook her head. “I’ll never see
'im no more. I know 'em,” she said,
drawing on the depth of her experience
of young men who do the vanishing
trick. “An' my money gone too. It's
'eartbreakin'. But I might 'ave known
that that there 'orse was a bad sign.”
“What horse?” I asked, bewildered.

spoke. “I’ve got a bit on
an 'orse for the Derby.”
I felt slightly shocked.
It is always surprising to
discover a latent sporting
instinct in one's domestics,
unless they are highly
placed and dignified do-
mestics like butlers or
head-footmen; but in a
cook-general it seems pe-
culiarly low.
“I shouldn't bet if I
were you,” I advised; “I
think—er—Master thinks,”
I added involuntarily—
“that you might lose
money at it.”
“But I'm goin' to win
money this time,” an-
nounced Elizabeth trium-
phantly; “my young man

“And what was the
name of the horse?” I
inquired as she drifted
dismally to the door.

beth mournfully.

“Which young man?" I inquired.
Elizabeth, I ought perhaps to explain,
is uncertain about her young men. She
never has any lack of them ; but they
are like ships that pass in the night
(her night out as a rule) and one by one
they drift off, never stopping to cast
anchor in her vicinity. You know what
I mean. Elizabeth can't keep a young
man. Perhaps she lacks the charm
which BARRIE describes as “a sort of a
bloom on a woman.” Or if she has any
of that bloom it must be swamped in
the moist oleaginous atmosphere of
washing-up which seems to cling per-
manently about her.
“It's a new young man,” said Eliza-
beth in answer to my question, “an'

stages of paying her attention are
agreeable to everybody. Elizabeth, feel.

way that God's in His heaven and all's

going about her duties. She does un-

the brasses every week—indeed you
have only to step into the hall and glance
at the stair-rods to discover the exact
stage of her latest" affair.” I remember
that, when one ardent swain “in the fly-

she cleaned the entire house down in
her enthusiasm, and had actually got
to the cellars before he vanished out

AMERICA AGAIN.
A SITUATION of extreme international
delicacy has recently arisen. We under-
stand, with regard to the impending
strike of Italian organ-grinders and ice-
cream merchants in the Metropolis, that
Signori Rimbombo Furioso and Fagiuolo
Antico, representing the Amalgamated
Society of Itinerant Instrumentalists
and the National Union of Refrigerated
Tuck Sellers, have lately been invited to
a conference with Dr. MACNAMARA, and
their economic grievances are now under
the consideration of the MINISTER of
LABOUR. These, briefly, are as follows:
(1) The high price of sugar.
(2) Restricted hours and insufficient
emoluments.
(3) Undue interference by the police.
(4) Inadequate supplies of monkey
nuts.
It now appears that in order to make
a bid for the large Italian vote in the
forthcoming Presidential elections in
paganda compaign is raging on the
other side of the Atlantic, and that an
enormous amount of spurious sympathy
is being manufactured on behalf of the
purveyors of rotary music and frozen
confectionery in Soho. Beautiful Italian
girls are daily besieging the British
Embassy at Washington with placards
bearing such inscriptions as–
SHOULD HOKEY POKEY SUFFER 2
ENGLAND COERCES HER TRAVEL-
LING OFGANISTS.
AMERICANS HELP THE DUMB APE I
The agitation is the more uncalled for
since, as a matter of fact, both Signor
Furioso and Signor Antico, like most of
their compatriots in this country, are
pronounced Irredentists and filled with
aspirations for a larger Italy, so that
they have little or nothing in common
with anti-Imperialistic America. Never.
theless, so bitter is the feeling which
has been aroused that large subsidies are
being sent overseas and Black Hand
police. All over the outer suburbs
organ-grinders are refusing to move on,
and insist on playing well into the
early hours of the morning. Deleteri-
ous substances of an explosive nature
are being mingled with the ice cream,
or else it is being supplied in such a
watery condition that it is impossible for
customers to lick it out of the receptacle
without ruining their shirt fronts and
waistcoats. Monkeys are being trained
to give violent manifestations of fero-
city, and, should the present heat-wave
continue, rabies is anticipated.
The latest development is a rumoured
suggestion from the U.S.A. Govern-
ment that a representative should be
sent over to take part in the Conference,
and the names of Mr. Joe DEMPSEY
and Mr. CHARLEs CHAPLIN have been
put forward as possible mediators.

PRACTICAL ZOOLOGY.
THERE is nothing which distinguishes
your true Briton so much as the syste-
matic study of the ways of wild animals,
and there is no kind of instruction which
an English child so eagerly accepts.
“The addax or Nubian antelope,”
how frequently one may hear a father
say to his small son in the schoolroom,
“has horns very similar to those of the
Indian antelope, but is a larger animal.”
| “Yes, father,” responds the boy brightly,
“it has a tuft of long hair on the fore-
head and large broad hoofs, adapted for
treading on fine and loose sands.”
But it is easier perhaps to make
these nice points in natural history in
the comparative calm of the home than
in the more frenzied atmosphere that
reigns in the Zoological Gardens them-
selves. It is for that reason that I
have put together the few notes which
follow, hoping that they may assist
the reader to adopt a definite system
in dealing with this great national in-
stitution and educate the young mind
on a reasoned and scientific plan.
Take the order of visiting the cages
first. I do not complain of your natural
wish to begin with the giraffe, because
it has such an absurdly long neck and
may possibly mistake Pamela's straw-
and because you will be able to see the
hippopotamus on the way. As a matter
of fact you will find that the giraffe is
not standing near the bars at all, but
close to its stable, where it is mincing
and bridling exactly like a lady in a
Victorian novel, and as for the hippo-
potamus you cannot see the pretty pink
part of him because he is giving his
famous imitation of a submarine. But
never mind that. Your difficulty now
will be, “What shall we do next 2 ''
and in order to assist you I have con-
structed a logical order for visiting the
various cages. Here it is:—
1. The lions, because you can hear
them already roaring most horribly
fiercely. -
2. The sea-lions, because they are
saying “Ock, ock.”
3. The lions, because the tiger may
be roaring too this time.
4. The Elephant House. No, Pamela,
I don't know why he is swaying about
like that.
5. The lions, because Tony did not
really see the black panther, which was
asleep in one corner of its cage.
6. The Monkey House. I suppose
We must.
7. The lions, to wait there till they
are fed.
that you may not have much time to
visit the Mappin Terraces, and it is of
course very important that you should
go there because of the bears. The
bears by rights should be fed on um-
brellas, because they suck the stick and
the ribs of the frame for all the world
as if they were pieces of asparagus, and
tear the silk part very carefully into
tiny little shreds. But umbrellas are
very expensive just now and the keeper
does not think they are very good for
the bears either. It is better to give
them oranges, but oranges are expen-
sive too, so you must make quite cer-
tain that you do not waste them on the
grizzlies which are not on the Mappin
Terraces at all. It is no use giving an
orange to a grizzly bear, because it goes
down with one quick motion, like the
red into the right-hand top pocket.
But if you give it to one of the Hima-
layan bears he opens it and scoops out
all the inside and guzzles it up and
then sits down and licks his paws ex-
actly like a Christian, and while he is
doing that the other Himalayan bear
comes up and is so annoyed at not
having an orange too that he lies down
and groans with rage and flaps himself
with his paws. So you have to get
another orange.

“Paper-making by machinery, my

complicated process. I won't puzzle
you with all the details, but roughly the
idea is to pulp up the-er—rags and
so on in a huge sort of er—bowl, and
then to roll it out thin in the rolling-

Margaret thought this over. “It

said Margaret gratefully. “Write and

I.
ON CHARIVAR
AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT AT EPSOM.
IAM not attending the Derby this year.
Nor was it my original intention to go
last year, but since my beneficent em-
ployers, unasked, offered me a day off,
Selina insisted we ought to go. It was
a national institution, a sight everyone
should see once in a lifetime, and so
forth. I protested it was an extrava-
gance; that to be married was really
more than we could afford, let alone
race-meetings. But Selina was firm.
She would pay, if necessary, out of the
house-keeping money. Besides it need
cost nothing. We might win enough
money to cover our expenses.
Thus the idea of betting was intro-
duced. Gambling in all forms is against
my principles; and how I came to give
in on the point I scarcely know. From
the way Selina argued one might have
supposed that a bet on the Derby was
a prudent investment, something in
the nature of a life-insurance which no
careful husband would neglect to make.
So I yielded, merely stipulating that
our stake was not to exceed one pound;
and this amount fortunately satisfied
Selina's conception of recklessness.
So upon the appointed day we found
ourselves at the famous Heath, or is it
the Downs? The selection of a horse
to bear our fortunes to victory was not

said Margaret gratefully. “Write and

AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT AT EPS0M.
IAM not attending the Derby this year.
Nor was it my original intention to go
last year, but since my beneficent em-
ployers, unasked, offered me a day off,
Selina insisted we ought to go. It was
a national institution, a sight everyone
should see once in a lifetime, and so
forth. I protested it was an extrava-
gance; that to be married was really
more than we could afford, let alone
race-meetings. But Selina was firm.
She would pay, if necessary, out of the
house-keeping money. Besides it need
cost nothing. We might win enough
money to cover our expenses.
Thus the idea of betting was intro-
duced. Gambling in all forms is against
my principles; and how I came to give
in on the point I scarcely know. From
the way Selina argued one might have
supposed that a bet on the Derby was
a prudent investment, something in
the nature of a life-insurance which no
careful husband would neglect to make.
So I yielded, merely stipulating that
our stake was not to exceed one pound:
and this amount fortunately satisfied
Selina's conception of recklessness. .
So upon the appointed day we found
ourselves at the famous Heath, or is it
the Downs? The selection of a horse
to bear our fortunes to victory was not
made without anxious debate, since
Selina's choice was based upon the
colour scheme of the jockey's coats,
and mine on the romantic associations
of the animals' names. In the end wé
compromised on a horse called Grand
Parade.
Next, equally momentous, we selected

for the moment I am unable to pay
you. Most absurd. My losses have
been rather more than I calculated, and
I have unfortunately disbursed all my
available cash. You need be under
no apprehension, however; if you will
kindly give me your address you shall
have a cheque by the first post to-
morrow." -
I tried to recall what one did to
welshers. I seemed to remember that
one raised a hue-and-cry, that one
tarred and feathered them, and rode
them on a rail to a pond. I am,
however, constitutionally timid about
making my voice heard in public, and
I was as short of tar and feathers
as he was of ready cash. I had there-
fore no alternative but to draw out my
pocket-case and present him with a
card.
“Ah, thanks,” he said, and with a
neat little silver pencil he scribbled on
the back a hieroglyph of some sort,
doubtless to jog his memory. Then he
wished me good-day with many apolo-
gies and, politely taking off his hat to
Selina, sauntered leisurely in the direc-
tion of the railway-station.
I confess that this contretemps some-
what dashed my spirits. Nor was my
chagrin lessened by observing, during
the remainder of the afternoon, my
corpulent friend, notwithstanding the
closeness of his eyes to each other,
paying off regularly, at the end of each
race, a host of customers with the great-
est good grace, enlivened by coarse
jocularities. I followed the rest of the
sport with little zest, and my cup of
enjoyment was not filled to overflow-
ing when, possessing first-class return
tickets, we had to stand, Selina as well
as myself, in a crowded third-class
smoker. -
Selina however preserved both her
spirits and her confidence. Book-
makers, she had heard, were, as a class,
most honourable. Their losses could
not be recovered by law, but they re-
garded them as debts of honour. There
were exceptions, of course, but the
gentleman in grey was not one of them.
Something told her so. I should see
that she was right.
At breakfast next morning we scanned
our post for a letter in an unfamiliar
handwriting. There was none.
“It was really Father early to expect
one,” said Selina.
On the following morning, however,
amongst others there lay a letter in a
strange writing, addressed moreover in
precisely the same style as the de-
scription of me on my visiting card.
“What did I tell you?” said Selina.
“Well?” she asked, as I tore open
the envelope and read the letter.
“It is a demand from the railway for a
first-class fare from Epsom to London.
They state that I was detected travel-
ling without a ticket. Ridiculous. I
shall pay no attention to it.”
In the evening, however, as I started
home from the City, I thought better.
It would save trouble if I looked in at
London Bridge.
“You have come to pay?” said the
chief clerk, as I showed him the note.
“Indeed I have not,” said I. “On
the contrary the Company should re-
fund me the difference between first
and third-class fare.”
“Do you deny, then, that you trav-
elled back from Epsom without a
ticket 2 ”
“Indeed I do.”
“You will not deny, perhaps, that
this is the card you handed the in-
spector with a promise to pay ?”
I took the proffered card. I could
not deny it, for the card was mine. I
turned it over. There, faintly legible
on the back in pencil, was the hiero-
glyph that the bookie had scrawled
on it.
I explained to the clerk. I also ex-
plained to Selina when I got home.
She, however, sticks to her original
contention. She was not deceived.
Fundamentally the man was honest.
Only the expenses of his wife's long
illness had caused him to deviate from
the path of probity.
METHODIC MADNESS.
(By our Medical Correspondent.)
The newspapers have recently de-
voted a certain amount of space to the
American millionaire who, while con-
fined in a psychopathic ward of a pri-
vate lunatic asylum, by his clever finan-
cial manipulations added in the course
of six weeks five hundred thousand
pounds to a fortune “conservatively
estimated at three million pounds.”
In spite of this achievement the mis-
guided millionaire pleaded earnestly for
his release. But the verdict of the
New York Sheriffs' Court was adverse.
The expert “alienists” admitted that
he possessed an extraordinary memor
and undoubted genius, but held that he
was none the less insane. Accordingly
he is to remain in the psychopathic
ward to which he was consigned “at
the request of his aged mother.” A
simple sum in addition establishes the
fact that, if the patient maintains his
present average, he will considerably
more than double his fortune in a year.
Yet none of the newspaper commen-
tators have realised the tremendous
possibilities underlying this achieve-
ment.
solvency, and here is an infallible remedy
ready to hand. Lord FISHER's panacea
for our discontents was to “sack the
lot"—to dismiss all our rulers and ad-
ministrators. But he had only a glim-
mering of the truth. Our cry should
rather be, “Lock up the lot.” Experi-
ence has taught us that if complete
latitude is given to eccentrics and in-
competents, if, in the words of Professor
Soddy, F.R.S., the destinies of the coun-
try are entrusted to people of archaic
mental outlook, the result is bound to
be disastrous and chaotic. But if you
treat them as lunatics, there is a strong
presumption of their mending their
ways and proving valuable factors in
the economic reconstruction of the
Empire and the world. -
Grave evils call for drastic treat-
ment, and in view of the hectic con-
dition of the Stock Exchange and the
“vicious circle " round which indus-
trialism is now unhappily revolving I
cannot but think that the temporary
seclusion of the Ministry in a psycho-
pathic ward might be fraught with
economic consequences of the utmost
importance. Even if they were only
able to reduce our indebtedness at the
same rate as that attained by the Amer-
ican millionaire, their combined efforts
would represent a magnificent total.
Perhaps it would be wiser to proceed
tentatively and not commit ourselves
for more than six weeks to start with.
It is just conceivable that the treatment
might stimulate extravagance instead
of economy. Financial thrombosis is
not unknown as one of the obscurer
forms of megalomania. Still, as I have
said, the experiment is worth making.
In other spheres of activity the results
achieved are most encouraging. For
example, an extremely outré Cubist who
was recently consigned to a psychopathic
ward at the instigation of his grand-
mother, developed a remarkable talent
for painting in the manner of MARCUs
STONE, while a neo-Georgian composer
under similar treatment has produced a
series of études indistinguishable from
the pianoforte music of STERNDALE
BENNETT, though he had previously far
outstripped the most unbridled and
exacerbated aberrations of SCRIABINE in
his latest phase.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLow Room.”
GENTLEMEN of the Press having been
tactfully requested not to give away
this awesome mystery, I am barred by
the fastidious sense of honour which
distinguishes our profession from spoil-
ing your pleasure in this matter—a
course which otherwise I should natur-
ally have preferred.
Not that I have any too clear idea of
what it was all about or why an inno-
cent gentleman should be apparently
going to be guillotined for it. For there
was no question of anyone having been
murdered, the only tangible crime be-
fore the Court that I could see being
the abstraction of some scientific papers.
However don't imagine that this vague-
ness will deprive you of the pleasures of
shock. Only don't go thinking about
it. Remember Rosamund and her Pur-
ple Jar.
I think I am free to tell you that a
young journalist possessing (character-
istically) “fantastic humour and ex-
uberant gaiety,” a famous amateur de-
tective to boot, outwits all the official
police, robs the law of its prey and
finds a long-lost mother for himself.
If this doesn't excite you sufficiently
you can extract fun from subsidiary de-
tails. It is always diverting to the un-
spoilt soul when the principal lady goes
to turn up one lamp and the other
promptly glows instead; or when, a
particularly obvious and commonplace
knock assaulting the ear, she exclaims
in tragic accents, “There's someone at
the door;" or when the detective drags
from the bottom of the lake a pair of
the driest of dry old boots.
Or, if you are superior to this kind of
thing, you can amuse yourself by de-
ducing from the practice before you the
famous Rules for Revolvers, which, mu-
tatis mutandis, are as old as the Aris-
totelian unities and, for all I (or, pro-
bably, you) know to the contrary, were
laid down at the same time by the same
hand.
Rule 1. “All Innocent Characters ex-
pecting murderous assault from Par-
ticularly Desperate Villains will provide
themselves with revolvers. Before re-
tiring for the tragic night they will,
grasping the revolver firmly in the right
hand, place it carefully (as Professor
LEAcock would direct) on the revolver-
stand. The P.D.W. will then know
what to do about it. (Note: P.D.W.'s do
not carry revolvers. They don't need to.)
Iłule 2. “I.C.'s actually attacking
P.D.W.'s will on no account fire, but, ad-
vancing stealthily, will offer their pistol-
wrist to the enemy, who will at once
lock it in a deathly grip. After a brief
the P.D.W. will, on the word ‘Four,”
put on another beard and have the I.C.
thrown into prison.” And so forth.
I have no serious fault to find with
these tactics. On the contrary. But
I rather think that in the first Act an
incident was introduced (no doubt in
the spirit of the little girl's explanation
d propos of her riddle, “That was just
put in to make it more difficult”), which
was not quite cricket as it is played
by the best people in these stage
shockers.
But I am on dangerous grounds. Let
me say that Mr. HANNAFoRD BENNETT

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ALTHough Madeline of the Desert (UNwiN) is published in
the First Novel series, it by no means follows that Mr.
ARTHUR WEIGALL can be considered a beginner in author-
ship, his various activities already including some volumes
on Egyptology that have made for him a wide circle of
appreciative readers. You will therefore be correct in
guessing that the Desert of the title is Egyptian; also that
the story is one in which the setting and the local colour
are treated with expert knowledge and an infectious
enthusiasm. Of Madeline herself I should say at once
that nothing in her life, as shown here, became her like
the beginning of it. Her entrance into the tale, arriving
out of the desert to consult the recluse, Father Gregory,
whose nephew she afterwards marries, does very strikingly
achieve an effect of personality. Madeline was a product
of Port Said and, when we first meet her, an adventuress
of international reputation, or lack of it. Then Robin
rescues, marries and educates her. It was the last pro-
cess that started the trouble. Madeline took to education
more readily than a duck to water; and the worst of it
was that she was by no means willing to keep the results
and her conclusions therefrom to herself; indeed she devel-
oped the lecturing habit to an extent that almost (but not
quite) ruined her charm. Mr. WEIGALL is so obviously
sincere in all this that, though I cannot exonerate him from
a charge of using Madeline as the mouthpiece of his own
sociological and religious views, I must acknowledge his
good intentions, while deploring what seems to me an
ordinary; its quality in the portrayal both of place and
character is of the richest promise for future stories, in
which I hope the author will give us more pictures of the
land he understands so well.
I certainly admit that the publishers of The Strangeness
of Noel Carton (JENKINs) have every justification for
speaking of it as “a new note in a novel.” Indeed that
clever writer, Mr. WILLIAM CAINE, has here sounded as new,
original and (for all its surface humour) horrible a note as
any I have heard in fiction for some time. My trouble is
that I can hardly indicate it without giving away the whole
business. Very briefly the tale is of one Noel Carton, who
has married beneath him for not quite enough money to
gild a detestable union, and, being an unstable egoist and
waster, presently seeks consolation (and pocket money) by
writing a novel founded in part on his own position. One
may note in passing that Mr. CAINE seems to have but a
modest idea of the mental equipment required for such a
task. Still I suppose he knows, and anyway that isn't the
point. The point is that, once Noel has got himself properly
projected into his novel, all sorts of the queerest and most
bogie coincidences begin to occur. Again to quote the puff
preliminary, “as the book develops the reader has a sus-
picion which becomes almost a certainty, until the great
and astounding climax is reached; ” concerning which you
may justly remark that no reader with a certainty would
regard its verification as “astounding.” But this takes
nothing from the craft with which, on looking back, you see
the climax to have been prepared. I could hardly call the
tale altogether pleasant, but it is undeniably new and

artistic error. But, all said, the book is very far from being
vastly original.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The good Sioux glories in his scalps, and Mr. Isa Ag F.
MARcosson, of Louisville, must surely be the Great Chief
of interviewers. Interviewing, he tells us, is, after all, only
a form of reporting, and so are history, poetry and romance.
What, he asks, were MoMMsFN and GIBBON, WoRDsworth
and KEATs but reporters, and I can only answer, What
indeed? To have been found worthy of tonsure by Mr.
MARcosson it is necessary to be very eminent, and to win
his highest praise it is essential also to be a good “imparter,"
though he has a kind of sneaking admiration for the pale-
face who insists on handing him a written statement and
declines to speak. Such a one was Sir Edward CARson.
Hanging to Mr. MARcossos's girdle are the chevelures of
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, Lord HAIG, Marshal Foch, Sir JAMEs
BARRIE and Mr. Roosevelt, to name no more. Naturally
Adventures in Interviewing (LANE) is full of side-lights on
the recent war. How could it be otherwise when so many

novel. Love is not neglected, for a peer's son, deaf and

uses them to put her a leading question and understand
her version of “But this is so sudden. However --
There is a people's army; a rose-water revolution with the
King accepting it as all in the day's dull work; a fight or

though he duly falls in love with her, the innocence of
her soul keeps their passion on the highest plane. What
is more, when Alam, as such young gentlemen in fiction
generally do, changes his mind Miss DART provides a
happy ending, without even a suicide to spoil it, and with-
out inconsistency either in her own point of view or in
that of her characters. I don't really believe that Devon-
shire people say that they like things “brave and well”
quite as often as Miss DART makes hers, and I wish she
had not so great a fondness for the word “such " that she
must invent phrases as weird as “though he had not sought

Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTTs arranged for family reading, will
certainly please a great many people.

There is both ingenuity and originality in this story, and I
should be doing the author and his readers a great disservice
if I disclosed the details of the plot. Anyone with a bent
for treasure-hunting will be missing a fine opportunity if he
refuses to have a day (or a night) with Mr. GRAHAM's hounds.

“UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE"
["A Skilled Labourer," writing to The Times,
speaks of “the extremists” among the working
classes as “cherishing a belief that the intelli-
gence of educated persons is declining.”]
Doubtless, my Masters, you are right
As to the lore which they delight
To teach at Cambridge College;
Contented with a classic tone,
Those useful arts we left alone
By which we might have held our own
Against the Newer Knowledge.
Even if I could still retain
The ethics which my early brain
Imbibed from ARISTOTLE,
It would not serve me much to speak
His views on virtue (in the Greek)
When buying table claret (weak)
At ten-and-six the bottle.
| Or when my tailor claims his loot
Of twenty guineas for a suit
Of rude continuations,
I must remain his hopeless thrall,
Nor would it move his heart at all
Could I from JUVENAL recall
Some apposite quotations.
If I engaged a working-man
To mend a leaky pot or pan
Or else a pipe that's porous,
He would not modify his fees
For hours and hours of vacant ease
Though out of ARISTOPHANES
I said a funny chorus.
I am a failure, it appears;
I cannot cope with profiteers
Nor with enlightened Labour;
Too late I see, on looking back,
Where lies the blame for what I lack;
Why was I never taught the knack
Of beggaring my neighbour 2 O. S
A CONNOISSEUR'S APPREGIATION.
SHARP RISE of GREAT BRITAIN IN THE
ESTIMATION OF U.S.A.
THE first-class carriage was empty.
I threw my coat into a corner and
settled myself in the seat opposite.
Just as the train started to move, the
door was flung open and a tall lean
body hurled itself into the compartment
and dropped on my coat. He was
followed instantaneously by a leather
bag which crashed on to the floor.
“Say, these cars pull out pretty
slick.”
My intelligence at once conjectured
that this was an American, one of the
thousands who have lately taken ad-
vantage of the exchange to spy out the
nakedness of our land.
I must admit that I understand
American only with great difficulty. I
try to guess the meaning of each sen-
I can interpret. I surmised somehow
that his speech referred to the bag on
the floor.
So I answered, civilly enough, “I
hope your bag is undamaged. Excuse
me, I will relieve you of my coat.” So
saying, I pulled it from beneath him
and with a single movement flung it
on the rack over my own head.
The stranger spoke again after some
moments. He appeared to have spent
the interval in repeating my words to
himself, as though to grasp their mean-
ing. Yet, heaven knows, I speak
plainly enough.
This time he said, “Guess my grip 's
O.K. But I ain't plunkin' my bucks
on the guy that says the old eountry's
in the sweet and peaceful.”
After this most extraordinary and un-
intelligible communication he began to
feel his pockets and his person all over,
as though searching for something. I
felt myself at liberty to resume my
study of The Spectator.
However, I was not to be left alone.
Again he addressed me. “Guess I
gotta hand it to you.”
“I beg your pardon,” I observed,
lowering my paper.
“You’ve got 'em all whipped blocks,”
he went on, his absurd smile still per-
sisting. “You're a cracker jack, you're
a smart aleck. You 've done to me
what the fire did to the furnishing
shack. You've dealt me one in the
spaghetti joint. Oh, I gotta hand it to
Oll.
I could understand little of the words,
but I gathered from his manner that he
was congratulating me on something in
the extravagant but interesting fashion
of the North-American tribes.
“You sure put the monkey-wrench
on me,” he continued. “You make me
feel like I couldn't operate a pea-nut
stand. I*m the rube from the back-
blocks, sure thing. I ain't going to
holler any—not me. I'm real pleased
to get acquainted. Shake.”
I took his hand with as little self-
consciousness as possible, not yet hav-
ing been able to understand what praise-
worthy act I had accomplished. I must
admit none the less that I felt vaguely
pleased at his encomiums.
“There was a guy way back in
Nevada used to have a style like
yours. They called him Happy Cloud
Sim, and he had a hand like a ham.
See that grip 2 Well, Sir, Sim 'ud
come right in here, lay his hand some-
wheres about, and that grip 'ud vanish
into the sweet eternal. You could
search the hull of the cars from caboose
to fire-box and nary a grip. He was
an artist. Poor Sim, he overreached
himself in Albany, trying to attach a
ringing a bell and shedding tickets all
along the sidewalk. The sleuths just
paper-chased him through the burg.
He was easy meat for the calaboose
that Fall.”
I was at a loss to understand the
relevance of this extremely improbable
narrative. It did not appear, on the
face of it, complimentary to connect
me with a declared thief and gaol-bird.
Still it was my duty to be courteous to
one who was for the time a national
guest.
“A most interesting story,” I re-
marked, “and one which has the further
advantage of conveying a moral lesson.”
“But you got Sim beat ten blocks,”
he resumed. “The way you threw
your top-coat up made Sim look like a
last year's made-over. I never set eyes
on a dry-goods clerk as could fix a
package slicker. I'll have a lil some-
thing to tell the home town.”
He looked out of the window. “Guess
this is Harrow,” he remarked, “and
we're pulling into the deepo. I may
as well have my wad back.”
So saying he put his hand into the
folds of the coat over my head and
withdrew a roll of notes fastened with
a rubber band. This roll he then
stuffed into his hip-pocket. I began to
see the meaning of his insinuations.
“If you think,” said I indignantly,
“that I saw you drop your notes
and deliberately rolled them up in the
coat ; :
“Nix on that stuff,” he retorted
jovially. “I know them dollar-bills;
they kinder skin theirselves off the
wad and when you come to pay the bar-
tender they've hit the trail and you
stand lonesome with a bitter taste in
your mouth, like Lot's wife.”
The train stopped; the man stepped
out with the unnecessary haste of his
kind.
“Well, I'm pleased to have met you,”
he concluded, still smiling amiably
through the window; “if ever you
strike Rapid City, Wis., you'll find me
rustling wood somewheres near the
saloon. I'd like to have got better
acquainted, but I promised the folks
I'd stop off here and get wise as to
how boys is raised in your country.
They sure grow up fine men. I reckon
we're way behind the times in Rapid
City - ?
The train passed out leaving me
speechless with indignation.
It took me some moments to recover
my normal balance. Then I confess I
was delighted to notice that the fellow,
in his enthusiasm over the alleged
lightness of my fingers, had left his
precious “grip" behind him.
It travelled with me to my destina-
tence from the unimportant wordswhich

give you a month's notice, to take effect
as from four o'clock this afternoon. You
have good qualities. You are honest
and temperate and, to some extent, not
bad looking—in the evening, anyway.
Your idea of keeping household ac-
counts is atrocious, but, on the other
hand, you look rather nice in a ham-
mock on a hot summer day. But that
is all I can say for you. You have not
given me the wifely devotion I expected.

ing extracts from some beastly revue,

Again, you invariably put our child in

last piece of cake or having an egg for

you, but I hate favouritism, and I won't
play second fiddle to Christopher or
anyone else.

phrase in its formal sense only), not
being satisfied that you do all that was
promised in the advertisement, I have
decided to return you without further
liability and ask for a refund of the

thank you. You may go.'"
There was a few moments' ominous
quiet, and then Cecilia went over the
top with a roar of artillery and the
rattle of machine guns. John put up
a defensive barrage. Cecilia raked him
with bombs and Lewis guns. He re-
plied with heavy stuff. The air grew
thicker and thicker.
“Shush!” I shouted through the din
of battle. “Man and wife to wrangle like
this! Think of your good name. Think
of the servants. Think of the child.”
Cecilia caught the last phrase and
the noise subsided.
“Yes,” she said, breathless but calm,
“there's the hitch in your plans, Master
John—the child. If I go I take Chris-
topher with me.”

how comic poetry is written.
Comic poetry, as I think I pointed
out in my last lecture, is much more
difficult than serious poetry, because
there are all sorts of rules. In serious
poetry there are practically no rules,
and what rules there are may be shat-
tered with impunity as soon as they
become at all inconvenient. Rhyme,
ſor instance. A well-known Irish poet
once wrote a poem which ran like this:
- “Hands, do as you're bid,
Draw the balloon of the mind
That bellies and sags in the wind
Into its narrow shed.”
This was printed in a serious paper;
but if the poet had sent it up to a
humorous paper (as he might well have
done) the Editor would have said, “Do
you pronounce it shid 2", and the poet
would have had no answer. You see,
he started out, as serious poets do, with
every intention of organising a good
rhyme for bid—or perhaps for shed—
but he found this was more difficult
than he expected. And then, no doubt,
somebody drove all his cattle on to
his croquet-lawn, or somebody else's
croquet-lawn, and he abandoned the
struggle. I shouldn't complain of that;
what I do complain of is the deceitful-
ness of the whole thing. If a man can't
find a better rhyme than shed for a
simple word like bid, let him give up
the idea of having a rhyme at all; let
him write— -
Hands, do as you're Told,
Ol'
Into its narrow HUT (or even HANGAR).
That at least would be an honest con-
fession of failure. But to write bid
and shed is simply a sinister attempt
to gain credit for writing a rhymed
poem without doing it at all.
Well, that kind of thing is not allowed
in comic poetry. When I opened my
well-known military epic, “Riddles of
the King,” with the couplet,
Full dress (with decorations) will be worn
When General Officers are shot at dawn,
the Editor wrote cuttingly in the mar-
gin, “Do you say dorn ?”
The correct answer would have been,
of course, “Well, as a matter of fact I
do; ” but you cannot make answers of
that kind to Editors; they don't under-
stand it. And that brings you to the
real drawback of comic poetry; it means
constant truck with Editors. But I must
not be drawn into a discussion about
them. In a special lecture—two special
lectures Quite.
The lowest form of comic poetry is,
of course, the Limerick; but it is a
It is more difficult to finish a Limerick
than to finish anything in the world.
You see, in a Limerick you cannot
begin —
There was an old man of West Ham
and go on
Who formed an original plan,
finishing the last line with limb or hen
or bun. A serious writer could do that
with impunity, and indeed with praise,
but the more exacting traditions of
Limerical composition insist that, hav-
ing fixed on Ham as the end of the first
line, you must find two other rhymes
to Ham, and good rhymes too. This is
why there is so large a body of un-
completed Limericks. For many years
I have been trying to finish the follow-
ing unfinished masterpiece:—
There was a young man who said “Hell ?
I don't think I feel very well—”
That was composed on the Gallipoli
Peninsula; in fact it was composed
under fire; indeed I remember now
that we were going over the top at the
time. But in the quiet days of Peace
I can get no further with it. It only
shows how much easier it is to begin a
Limerick than to end it.
Apart from the subtle phrasing of
the second line this poem is noteworthy
because it is cast in the classic form.
All the best Limericks are about a young
man, or else an old one, who said some
short sharp monosyllable in the first
line. For example:—
There was a young man who said “If–
Now what are the rhymes to if? Look-
ing up my Rhyming Dictionary I see
they are:—
cliff hieroglyph hippogriff
skiff sniff stiff tiff whiff
Of these one may reject hippogriff at
once, as it is in the wrong metre. Hiero-
glyph is attractive, and we might do
worse than :-
There was a young man who said “If
One murdered a hieroglyph—”
Having, however, no very clear idea of
the nature of a hieroglyph I am afraid
that this will also join the long list of
unfinished masterpieces. Personally
I should incline to something of this
kind:—
There was a young man who said “If
I threw myself over a cliff
I do not believe
One person would grieve—”
Now the last line is going to be very
difficult. The tragic loneliness, the
utter disillusion of this young man is so
vividly outlined in the first part of the
poem that to avoid an anticlimax a
really powerful last line is required. But
there are no powerful rhymes. A serious
poet, of course, could finish up with
like that. But we are limited to skiff,
sniff, tiff and whiff. And what can
you do with those ? Students, I hope,
will see what they can do. My own
tentative solution is printed, by arrange-
ment with the Editor, on another
page (458). I do not pretend that it
is perfect; in fact it seems to me to
strike rather a vulgar note. At the
same time it is copyright, and must
not be set to music in the U.S.A.
I have left little time for comic poetry
other than Limericks, but most of the
above profound observations are equally
applicable to both, except that in the
case of the former it is usual to think
of the last line first. Having done that
you think of some good rhymes to the
last line and hang them up in mid-air,
so to speak. Then you think of some-
thing to say which will fit on to those
rhymes. It is just like Limericks, only
you start at the other end; indeed it
is much easier than Limericks, though,
I am glad to say, nobody believes this.
If they did it would be even harder
to get money out of Editors than it is
already. -
We will now write a comic poem
about Spring Cleaning. We will have
verses of six lines, five ten-syllable lines
and one six-syllable. As a last line for
the first verse I suggest
Where have they put my hat?
We now require two rhymes to hat.
In the present context flat will ob-
viously be one, and cat or drat will be
another. Our resources at present are
therefore as follows:–
Line 1–
2— . .
. flat.
3— —
. cat or drat.
1, 4- . .
6—Where have they put my hat?
As for the blank lines, wife is certain
to come in sooner or later, and we had
better put that down, supported by life
(“What a life!"), and knife or strife.
There are no other rhymes, except rife,
which is a useless word. º
We now hold another parade:—
Terumti-um ti—umti-umti –wife,
Terumti-umti-umti—umti-flat;
Teroodle—oodle—oodle —What a life
Terumti-oodle—umti-oodle—cat (or drat);
Toroodle—umti-oodle—umti-knife(or strife);
Where have they put my hat?
All that remains now is to fill in the
umti-oodles, and I can't be bothered
to do that. There is nothing in it.

DON'T you ever know the impulse,
when you are idly turning the pages
of a telephone directory, to ring up
some total stranger and engage him in
light conversation ? -
I do, quite intensely. In moments of
ennui, when there is really nothing to do
in the office, the fear of discovery alone
restrains me. I'm not sure that I can
rely on the professional secrecy of the
girl at the exchange. Has she strength
of mind to refuse a righteously indig-
nant subscriber who demands to know
(with imprecations) what number has
been talking to him 2
I could take her into my confidence,
I suppose. Only the thing oughtn't to
be elaborately premeditated; it should
be sudden and spontaneous, the matter
of a happy moment. You get your
number and say:—
“Hullo ! Is that Barefoot and Hum-
page, the architects? Can I speak to
Mr. Barefoot—or Mr. Humpage?”
“Mr. Humpage speaking. Who is
that, please ?”
“Well, I want you to design me a

“To design you a what?”
“A cathedral. C–A–T-H– but I
expect you heard me that time. A
massive structure, you know, chiefly
Ely, and—well, probably you'll know
what I mean. Now, as to details --
“Who are you?”
“I ? Oh, I'm a collector of these
buildings in a small way. But about
this one we're discussing. Something
in the pre-Raphaelite manner, do you
think — with arpeggios dotted about
here and there?”
Of course I don't know what Mr.
Humpage would say at this point.
Therein would lie the fascination of
these experiments — to discover just
what different people would say at that
kind of point.
Take Mr. Absalom, for instance, who
is described in the Directory as a com-
mission agent. How would he express
himself, I wonder, if I were to ring
him up and request him to dispose, on
the most advantageous terms, of my
commission in the Army 2
Messrs. Wheable Brothers too. Just
the people I've been looking for.
“You're the sand and gravel con-
tractors, aren't you?” I should begin.
“Well, I know of some sand that badly
wants contracting.”
“I beg your pardon 2"
“Perhaps I had better explain. You
see, I always spend my holidays at
Pipton-on-Sea. This year, in fact, I'm
going there in two or three weeks' time.
Earlier holidays—asplendid movement,
what? See railway posters. In June
the point is that at Pipton there's a
belt of about two miles of sand, even
at high-tide—several hundred yards,
anyhow—and it does spoil the bathing
so. Now if you could arrange to have
this sand contracted to half or a third
of its present width 2 Perhaps you'll
quote me terms. Thank you so much."
Then there's the Steam Packet Com-
pany at a neighbouring port. One
might ask them to supply half-a-dozen
small packets of steam for the un-
gumming of envelope-flaps.
I find also in the Directory two or
three gentlemen with the surname of
“George.” I could profess to be an
earnest Liberal opponent of the PRIME
MINISTER, accustomed to refer to him
by that disrespectful abbreviation —
“Oh, is that Mr. George? Well, Sir,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, June 1st.—Tempted by the
fine weather a good many Members had
evidently determined that the country
was good enough for them and that
Westminster could wait. But Wiscount
CURzoN was not of their number. Was
it not on the glorious
First of June, a hun-
dred and twenty-six
years ago, that his
great - great - great -
grandfather won vic-
tory for his country
and immortal fame for
himself 2 On such an
anniversary he was
obviously bound, no
matter at what per-
sonal inconvenience,
to show a like public
spirit. Accordingly, -
with a full sense of H
responsibility, he ad-
dressed to the appro-
priate Minister this
momentous question:
“Whether any fried
fish shops are now the
property or under the
control of the Ministry
of Munitions; and if
so how many?” The
House paused in awed
anticipation of the
reply, but breathed
again when Mr. HoPE
announced that “No
fried fish shops are
now nor, so far as is known, were
ever conducted by the Ministry of
Munitions.”
No other episode of Question-time
rose to this high level. Next in im-
portance to it were Mr. BALDw1N's
revelations on the subject of “con-
science-money.” It seems that in one
particular instance it cost the Treasury
eleven shillings to acknowledge the
receipt of half-a-sovereign; but that
was because the dilatory tax-payer in-
sisted that the depth of his remorse
could only be adequately exhibited by
a notice in the “agony-column.” In
ordinary cases no charge is incurred.
Any conscientious Sinn Feiner who
may have been fearing lest the recent
destruction of Inland Revenue offices
in Ireland should prevent the authori-
ties from sending out the usual demand-
notes, may now forward his contribution
direct to the Treasury without hesita-
tion. Mr. BALDw1N is doubtless relying
upon the wide adoption of this practice,
for he stated that, although the damage
might cause delay in the collection, it
was not expected that the ultimate yield

resisting a proposal to hand over the
coastguards to the Board of Trade, sur-
prised the House with the apparently
reactionary statement that “we do not
want to run the Navy in water-tight
compartments.”
Commander BELLAIRs, enforcing the
point that adminis-
tration must depend
upon policy, recalled
the fact that in his
time “the Mediter-
ranean outlook” had
given way to “the
North Sea outlook,”
and expressed the con-
fident belief that we
should next have “the
Pacific outlook.” Well,
let us hope we may.
At any rate the House
agreed with the FIRST
LORD that the best
way to ensure it was
to keep the Navy
strong and efficient,
for by half-past eight
it had passed all the
Votes submitted to it.

ment lasted only half-an-hour, and had

Captain CoI,IN Coote proposed to hand

that these bodies must be given serious
responsibilities which would compel
them to unite. He wanted, as he said,
to “infuse blood into their veins” at

The idea of providing a probably Sinn
Fein Parliament in Dublin with sub-
marines and aeroplanes did not appeal
to the FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY,

inspired another of Sir Edward CAR-

that any form of Home Rule must lead
ultimately to separation.
Thursday, June 3rd.—Sir HAMAR
GREEN wood, who took his seat on
Tuesday, answered Irish questions for
direct and forceful as ever, but his
matter, unhappily, consisted chiefly in
the admission of unpleasant facts re-
garding recent attacks upon the police,
with the invariable addition that “no
arrests have been made.”
The hon.baronet who sits for Notting-
ham is so much impressed with the
necessity for economy that he ought to
be known as Rees angustae. But he has
no luck. Mr. FISHER offered the “frozen
face” to his complaints that the State
is giving free education at the Ministries
to ex-Service men; and Mr. SHORTT was
no more sympathetic to his plea that the
new policewomen should be abolished.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, looking delight-
fully cool in a new grey suit, made
a welcome reappearance after some
weeks' absence. He gave a version of the
KRASSIN negotiations—which, accord-
ing to his account, had followed exactly
the course marked out by the Supreme
Council in Paris and San Remo–very
different from that presented in a section
of the Press, and he implied that the
alleged perturbation of French public
opinion only existed in the imagination
of “certain newspapers which are try-
ing to foment ill-feeling between two
countries whose friendliness is essential

the other hand, he cannot reduce them
overmuch lest the Bill should cease to

PERCE MURGATROYD, MASTER
BRICKLAYER.
BY ONE who kNEw HIM.
By the untimely death of the late
Mr. Percival Murgatroyd we suffer the
irreplaceable loss of our youngest and
perhaps most talented master brick-
layer. The story of his life is yet an-
other example of genius triumphing over
adversity. Perce Murgatroyd was born
in a mean street. His father was a poor
hardworking physician. Lacking the
influence necessary for the introduction
of his boy to some lucrative commercial
calling he contrived at great self-sacri-
fice to educate him for the Civil Service.
The long hours of grinding toil and
the complete lack of sympathy at home
could not extinguish the divine fire of
genius in the youthful Murgatroyd.
Exhausted and hungry as he often was
at the end of the day's work, he devoted
his leisure to the study of bricks and
mortar, and out of his scanty pocket-
money he bought for himself first a
trowel and later a plummet.
When I first made his acquaintance
he was already, at the age of twenty-
five, assisting a bricklayer's helper, and
was fairly launched on a career of un-
broken success which was to culminate
in a master bricklayership at the record
age of thirty-eight.
Some of the finest things Murgatroyd
did are to be found in and around
Tooting, a quarter which is becoming
known as Murgatroyd's London; but
there is scarcely a district which does
not cherish some gem from his trowel.
At Wanstead Flats, during some re-
parations to “Edelweiss Cottage,”
there was discovered under the plaster
a party-wall which proved to be a
genuine Murgatroyd. It is one of his
early works, executed with his studied
reserve of power, and is marred only by
suggestions of the conventional haste
of the early Georgian School, from
which Murgatroyd had not in those
days completely broken away. It is
also worth while to make a pilgrimage
to Walham Green, where all that is
best and most typical of the Master—
that effect he obtained of deliberate

This habit of his was the primary
cause of his premature end. Emerging
from some such fit of abstraction he
became aware that it was after twelve.
Convivial spirit that he was, he hurried

displaying remarkable agility as he de-

I HoPE William likes it, for he brought
it on himself. As soon as the sad event
was announced to me I discussed the
matter most seriously with Araminta.
“A situation of unparalleled gravity has
arisen,” I said, “with regard to the
wedding of William. It is going to be
carried out at Whittlehampton in top-
hats. Picture to yourself the scene.
Waterloo Station full of lithe young ath-
letes of either sex arrayed for sports on
flood and field, carrying their golf-clubs,
their diabolo spools and their butterfly
nets, and there, in the midst of them, me
with my miserable coat-tails, the June
sun glaring on my burnished topper,
and in my hands the silver asparagus-
server or whatever it is that I am going
to buy for William. I tell you it isn't
done. They will come round and mock
me. They will titter at me through
their tennis-racquets.”
“Couldn't you wear a common or
| Homburg hat and carry your other in
a hat-box 2" she suggested in that
bright helpful way they have.
“Amongst the severe economic con-
sequences of time recent great war,” I
replied coldly, “was, if you will take the
trouble to remember, the total loss of
my top-hat box.”
“Well, why not a white cardboard
box, then 2''
“No power on earth shall induce me
to stand on Waterloo Station platform
dandling a white cardboard box,” I
cried. “Waterloo indeed It would
be my Austerlitz, my Jena. I should
never dare to read the works of “Man
about Town' again. Besides, what
about my morning-coat 2"
“Well, I could pin the tails of it up
inside if you like. Or what about wear-
ing an overcoat 2"
“Your first suggestion makes me
despair of women's future position in
the economic sphere. The second I
would consider if I could settle the
hat problem.”
| And still thinking hard I rang up
William.
“I suppose you couldn't possibly
cancel this wedding of yours?” I asked
when I had explained the impasse.
Self-centred as usual, he flatly declined.
“Honestly, I don't see the difficulty
at all,” he went on. “I expect you'll
look a bit of a mug anyhow, and pro-
bably there'll be lots of people on the
platform dressed in morning-coats and
top-hats."
“Nobody leaves London on a Satur-
day morning wearing top-hats,” I as-
sured him, “nobody. If I were coming
in to London it would be quite a dif-
ferent matter. I might be an officer in
going out—no. Look here, why not make
it a simple country wedding — sports
coats and hayseed in the hair, and all
that sort of thing?”
“Spats and white vest-slips will be
worn by all the more prominent guests,”
he replied firmly.
“Well, hang it, have the thing in
London, then,” I implored, “and I'll
promise to add the price of the return-
fare to the cost of your wedding pre-
sent.”
“Thebride's parents reside at Whittle-
hampton, and the wedding will take
place from the home of the bride,” he
answered.
“You got that little bit out of The
Morning Post,” I said. “Couldn't you
persuade the bride's parents to take a
house in London 2 There's one just
opposite us at only about thirty pounds
a week. Stands in its own grounds, it
does, and there's a stag's head in the
hall. There's nothing like a stag's
head for hanging top-hats on.”
It was no good. . You know what
these young lovers are. Immersed in
their own petty affairs, they can pay
no proper attention to the troubles of
their friends.
William rangoff and left me once more
a prey to harrowing despair. There
were only three nights before the
calamity took place, and I had terrible
nightmares on two of them. In one I
attended the wedding in a bowler hat
and pyjamas, with carpet slippers and
spats. In the other my top-hat was on
my head and my vest-slip was all right,
but I tailed off into khaki breeches and
trench boots. On the third day a gleam
of light broke and I rang up William
again.
“I haven't quite settled that little
hat problem I was talking to you
about,” I told him. “Look here—can
you lend me your old top-hat-box 2"
“Haven't got one,” he replied. “In
the chaos consequent upon Armageddon
it somehow disappeared.”
I breathed a sigh of relief. s
Happily the morning of the wedding
was cloudy and dull. I wore my oldest
squash hat and coat and went to
Whittlehampton carrying my present
in my hand. As the train arrived the
sun broke through the clouds, and I
also emerged from my chrysalis and
attended the ceremony in all the pano-
ply that William's egotism had de-
manded. If it had not been too late to
get into the list you would have seen
this entry amongst the wedding gifts:—
“Mr. Herbert Robinson : Leather
hat-box.”
Perhaps if it had been a very full list
it would have gone on :-
As I explained to William, it is cus-
tomary to give useful rather than
ornamental gifts nowadays, but I could
not refrain from adding a small senti-
mental tribute. EvoB.

HOW TO PACIFY IRELAND.
(By a Student of anti-Coalition Political
Psycho-Analysis.)
THE announcement that a child of
ten years old, recently described by the
Willesden magistrate as “a remarkable
example of a child kleptomaniac,” has
been handed over to an eminent spe-
cialist in psycho-pathology, has not
yet received the attention that it un-
doubtedly demands. It is true that, in
the beautifully alliterative phrase of one
of our contemporaries, “with the ex-
ception of a penchant for petty pecula-
tions” the young offender “has always
been a model girl, industrious and
truthful,” thus justifying the belief of
the eminent specialist, that he could
the child is mother to the woman, and
those of us who have been gradually and
conscientiously convinced of the total
inadequacy of the Government's policy
towards Ireland, cannot but recognise
in this experiment an example which
might be profitably followed in dealing
with what—with all due deference to
Hibernian susceptibilities—we are re-
luctantly driven to call the irregular
conduct of certain sections of Irish
society.
With the exception of a penchant for
petty pin-pricks at the expense of the
police, Ireland's behaviour has been
exemplary in its industry and humanity.
So averse were a large number of her
sons from the employment of violence
in any form that they refused to parti-
the enemy that threatened our common
Empire. So magnanimous was their
charity that they found it impossible to
credit the harsh and unchristian allega-
tions levelled at the KAISER and his
countrymen. But it could hardly be
expected that so high-spirited and
energetic a race could indefinitely pur-
sue a course of inaction. The relentless
logic which has always been a distin-
guishing feature of the Celt has impelled
them, since the cessation of formal
hostilities, to express their disapproval
of a war waged in their interests by in-
dulging in demonstrations—if so harsh
a term may be permitted — directed
against the régime which has secured
them immunity from invasion, devasta-
tion and conscription, and at the same
time afforded them exceptional oppor-
tunities for amassing wealth.
It must be reluctantly admitted
that some of these ebullitions have
bordered closely on what we may be
forgiven for describing as indecorum.
But the motive was undoubtedly a
generous instinct of self-assertion. Ever
since the days of CAIN, the first great
self-expressionist, there have always
been richly-organised natures to whom
even fratricide is preferable to the dull
routine of agricultural life.
None the less it is at least arguable
that an indefinite extension and ex-
pansion of the conduct now prevalent in
the Sister Isle might be fraught with
consequences not altogether conducive
to the longevity of the minority. And
while sad experience has proved the
futilityof legislative panaceas there still
remain the fruitful possibilities inherent
in an application of the principles of
psycho-pathological treatment based
on the discoveries of FREUD. For our
own part we are convinced that herein
lies the only solution of Ireland's dis-
content.
Therefore let the Government at once
withdraw all troops and munitions of
war from Ireland, disband the R.I.C.
and invite the leaders of the Sinn Fein
movement and of the I.R.B. to submit
to a course of psychiatric treatment
conducted by an international board
of specialists, from which all repre-
sentatives of the belligerent Powers
should be excluded, with possibly the
exception of America. It seems in-
credible that such an offer should be
refused. If it is we can only patiently
acquiesce in the optimistic view of the
famous Celtic chronicler, GIRALDUs
CAMBRENSIs, that Ireland will be ulti-
mately pacified just before the Day of
Judgment—via paulo ante diem judicii.

FIRE BRIGADE.
THE ENGINE’s AFIRE.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FROM what is known of the tastes of Sir IAN EIAMILTON
it might have been supposed that he wrote his Gallipoli
Diary (ARNOLD) lest his pen-hand should lose its cunning
while wielding the sword. Indeed he tells us of a rumour
among his officers “that I spend my time composing poetry,
especially during our battles.” But that he did not write
for the sake of writing must be clear to anyone who reads
the book, even if the author had not declared his motive in
the preface. Here he admits that, though “soldiers think of
nothing so little as failure,” it was in fact the thought of pos-
sible failure that determined him, at the very start, to pre-
pare from day to day his defence. Perhaps this is not quite
the attitude of one who stakes all upon the great chance.
In another significant passage of self-revelation he tells us
how, on a tour of inspection in Egypt, he met RUPERT
BRookE, “the most distinguished of the Georgians.” “He
looked extraordinarily handsome . . . stretched out there on
the sand, with the only world that counts at his feet.”
Whether in ordinary times the world of art is or is not
the “only world that counts,” I cannot say, but I am
certain that to a soldier entrusted with an enterprise of so
great moment the only world that should have “counted”
at that hour was the world of war. If the chapter
which describes the failure that followed the landing in
Suvla Bay exposes the incapacity of some of his officers to
inspire their men with that little more energy which would
have ensured a great victory, it seems also to expose a
certain want of compelling personality in the High Com-
pretence to judge, and in any case judgment has been passed
on them already. The interest of the diary lies in its appeal
as a human document. It is the apologia of a man who, for
all his criticism, often apparently justified, of the authorities
at home (there are passages which he must surely have sup-
pressed if Lord KITCHENER had still been living), sets down
scarce a word in malice and but few in bitterness of spirit;
who appreciates at its high worth the devotion and gal-
lantry of his officers and men; who, whatever qualities he
may have lacked for his difficult task, reveals himself as
loyal at heart and generous by nature.
Miss RUTH Holt Boucicault (a name with a double
theatrical association) has written, in The Rose of Jericho
(PUTNAM), a novel of American stage life which I should
suppose comes as near to being a true picture as such
stories can. She derives her title from the convenient
habit of the desert rose of detaching itself from uncongenial
or exhausted soil, subsiding into a compact mass and
travelling before the wind to more profitable surroundings.
It will be admitted that the author has at least hit upon a
picturesque metaphor for a touring company, which on
this analogy becomes a very garden of (Jericho) roses.
Actually, however, she no doubt intended it to apply more
to the disposition of her heroine, and in particular to her
power of transferring her young affections, flower, leaf and
root, from one object to another, with undiminished enthu-
siasm. Sheelah's capacity for being off with the old and
on with the new is almost preternatural; her progress from
stage-child to leading lady is accompanied by such various
essays in unconventional domesticity that the reader may

mand. But of the military questions here raised I make no
well experience a sense of confusion, or at least feel some

difficulty in sustaining the first freshness of his sym-
pathy. The story is at times almost startlingly American,
as when the original betrayer of the heroine is excused on
the ground that, being English, his morality would naturally
not rise to native level (I swear I'm not laughing—see
page 168); and so full of the idiom of the Transatlantic
stage as to be a perfect vade mecum for visiting mimes from
this side. For the rest, vivacious, wildly sentimental and
obviously written from first-hand experience.
By calling her Potterism (CoLLINs) “a tragi-farcical
tract '' Miss Rose MACAULAY disarms our criticism that she
conducts too heavy a discussion from too light a platform. I
don't think the author of What Not is likely to write any-
thing dull, anything I shan't be pleased to read. She has
a keen eye, a candid soul, a sharp-pointed pen. She is
deliciously modern. And she dislikes Potterism, which is
than in “A Picked Eleven,” one of the most entertaining,
and at the same time human, short stories that I have ever
read. Further, his tales are essentially of the friendly order,
and the public will be in fault if they do not also prove
profitable, since we have none too many writers capable of
getting such deft results with the same economy of means.
In most stories constructed on the Enoch Arden principle
one of the husbands or wives (whichever it may be of whom
there are too many) is usually a very nasty person. Miss
SoPHIE Cole, in The Cypress Tree (MILLs AND Boon), makes
all three of her entangled characters quite attractive; in
fact, though I fear she would not wish me to say so, I
really liked the unsuccessful competitor better than the
winner. Books made up of the little homely things
which might happen to anybody and distinguished by their
pleasant atmosphere have been Miss Cole's speciality in
sentimental lack of precision in
thought. It is much more (or
much less) than this, but I get
the definition by inverting a
phrase of her dedication. Potter,

without abating a jot of her

they both when up at Oxford

do not thereby escape being
Potterites. They cling to mater.

an aristocratic clergyman, a wo-

(this last an admirable study)
do in varying degrees contrive
to avoid the deadly infection.
This tract needed writing. I
have a feeling that it could

cellent reading as it is. . . .

An honourable man steals it

baby for holding it, so you can
see how really baleful its influ-
ence must have been when you
consider that they were both
Miss Cole's characters. A very
little of the occult will excuse a
good deal of improbability, and
the small amount that has crept
into The Cypress Tree does not
spoil the effect of a truly
“nice" tale.
As an admirer of the Spud

Mr. ARNOLD PALMER derives the title of My Profitable

which the poet, apparently when launching her wares,
concludes,

which I take to be the pleasantest way in the world of
calling them pot-boilers. But whether they were so in-
tended or not, there can be no question of the very agree-
able dexterity that Mr. PALMER brings to the composition
of his tales. Save for a few experiments (which I should
call the least successful in the collection) his formula is
not the episodical “slice of life,” with crumbly edges. His
choice is for the well-made, with usually some ingenious
little twist at the finish, and (so to speak) a neatly tied bow
to end all. As an instance of this kind I commend to your
notice the admirably shaped little yarn called “Two-
Penn'orth." Mr. PALMER fias a pretty wit (perhaps here
can be confidently recommended. But sound and whole-
some as the preaching is it seems to me more suitable for a
tract than for a novel. Moreover it is not easy to feel full
sympathy with a hero who is frankly called an Adonis, who
“played a good bat at cricket,” and also in a strenuous
rugger match “dropped a beauty through the Edinburgh
sticks." Altogether the picture suffers from the prodigious
amount of paint that has been spent on it; yet I am con-
fident it will afford edification to many people whose tastes
I respect but cannot share.

I.—THE RESPONSIBILITIEs of GENIUs.
By Miss Dinkie Devereur, the renowned Film Favourite.
The Editor of The Weekly Newsbag has kindly asked me
to write an article on the duty which we denizens of Flicker-
land owe to the public. This, it happens, is a subject that
has long given me “furiously to think,” as a witty French-
man once said in French. It may be of interest, by the
way, to state that I am myself partly of Gallic extraction,
my mother having been a Lyons girl before she was en-
abled to open a tea-shop of her own ; and, although born
and bred in what I am proud to call my native country, I
can even now act just as fluently in a French film as in an
all-British production.

remain so without constant effort. The strenuous nature of
my labours indeed necessitates frequent periods of recu.
peration, which I seek either in my Highland fastness, or
on my Californian peach-farm, or amid the lotus-bushes of
my villa on the Riviera. This, then, is one of my first duties
to the public—to preserve that Heaven-sent talent which,
in the words of mighty MILtoN, “is death to hide.” (MIL-
ToN, I may say, is my favourite poet next to GEoRGE R.
SIMs, and “Odont" is my favourite mouth-wash.)
But the intervals between pictures are not all play. When
I receive notice of a forthcoming production in which my

aries of a financial nature are successfully negotiated), I

In order to prepare for this momentous undertaking I used
to visit Whiteridge's Stores daily and devote an hour or so
to travelling in the elevators; only thus could I hope to
attain the proper perspective. The attendants of course
knew me well and used to ply me with gifts of choco-
lates, etc.; but after a time I was compelled to refuse these
touching offerings because my chauffeur has a tendency
to biliousness.

ANOTHER DOG DISPUTE.
As far as was revealed by the torn
remnants of posters adhering to Farmer
Pyke's barn, the only event of im-
portance in Little Spudsey since the
letting by auction of fifty-seven acres
of summer keeping in April, 1918, was
the Rural District Council Election in
March, 1920. Conspicuous mention
was made of Pyke, Cluttrel and Gedge,

Independent. I was endeavouring to
discover his fate when old William
Trimble doddered along.
“Marnin', Mr. Lomax,” he said;
“you be back at last 2"
I could not deny the fact.
“There be only Hosea Bennett an’
George Riley to coom now, an' the toll
'll be complete.”
“Where are they now?” I asked.
“George be in India, or leastways 'e

an' th' question which on 'em really
owns th' Yarkshire tarrier 'll have to
be settled once an' for all. Yon election
hinged on it.”
“I’m afraid I've forgotten the de-
tails, William,” I confessed lamely.
“You’ll surely remember th’ little
Yarkshire tarrier as strayed into th’
village in the summer o' '14,” said
William. “ Hosea claimed it as his’n
by right of hollering it first, but George
rackened him givin' it a bit o' bacon-
rind from 'is lunch med 'im th’ rightful
owner. It stayed a few days wi' Hosea,
then George 'ticed it away, an' generally
it hung to the one as happened to have th’
biggest bone. Feeling ran high atween
them till, after the harvest 'ad bin got
in, Mr. Gedge, at The Chequers, axed
George what about j'ining up.
“‘What, an' give Hosea a free run
wi' th' tarrier?' said George. “Not

Gedge 'e says, “Hand th' dog to me.
I'll howd it wi'out fear nor favour, an'

“So Hosea jºined the Infantry an'
George went into th’ Yeomanry. There
was some friction when George first

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PRISCILLA DIALOGUE.
THERE is probably some way by which
a young female child can be led through
easy stages of Socratic dialogue to
the idea of ultimate truth in morals as
well as art. There is probably, some
way of talking to such a child without
being badly scored off. But I do not
seem to have the gift. This is the more
unfortunate because the thing usually
happens before I have finished my
breakfast, and nothing is quite so dam-
aging to my self-esteem as to be soundly
snubbed in my own house before the
day's work has begun.
Mind you I do not honestly believe
that my logic is at fault. I believe that
there is usually a flaw in the reasoning
of the child. But you cannot very well
say to an infant of three, “You are now
being guilty of an undistributed middle
or a petitio elemchi or whatever it is."
She would do what I have heard even
older women do in like circumstances.
She would change the subject at once.
Perhaps the MonTEssoRI system . . .
But let us take a typical case.
I found her sitting at a large table
by the dining-room window, in a high
. that left her red shoes eighteen
inches from the ground, a complete
doll's tea service in front of her and a
small stuffed lamb on her right-hand
side. The tea-pot appeared to contain
real water and the sugar-basin real
sugar, and although she was supremely
busy watering and sugaring and re-
arranging her cups and jugs and spoons
she greeted me with the composure of an
experienced châtelaine. Our conversa-
tion went something like this:—
She. Will you have any cup of tea?
I (having drunk a small cup of water
with a very little real sugar and a large
quantity of real grit in it.) Thank you.
How delicious ! But I must go and have
my breakfast now.
She (taking no notice at all and offer-
ing me a small fragment of moist toast).
Will you have any piece of cake?
I. Thank you. What lovely plum-
cake'
She (with infinite scorn). Ho! that
isn't plum-cake. There isn't any plums
in it. It's choclat cake. *
I (humiliated). Oh, well, I don't
think I will have any more tea, thank
Oll.
She (coldly). I'm going to give my
lamb tea now.
[The method of giving tea to a lamb,
in case it is not generally known,
is to plaster the lamb's nose with
spoonfuls of sugar and then lick
off the sugar with one's tongue.
At least that is the way Priscilla
does it.]
table.) What a funny way to give your
lamb tea, Priscilla.
She. My lamb says he likes having
his tea like this. (A longish pause.)
Please will you draw me a picsher ?
I. What kind of a picture ?
She. A picsher of a house.
I. What kind of a house?
She (in one long breath). A purple
house with a yellow roof and blue
curtains and a green door and rose-trees
with red roses and hollyhocks and a
dear little pussy-cat and a motor-car
coming up the drive.
[This is erecuted in coloured crayons
with a rapidity born of hunger
and long practice, and passed to
the Hanging Committee for in-
spection.]
She (examining it critically). Ho!
that isn't a door.
I. Yes, it is, Priscilla. It's a very nice
door.
She. It isn't a door.

[After all, when is a door not a
door 2 I finish the joinery job
and carry on with my bacon.]
She (suddenly). There isn't any sun.
[I sketch in the regulation pattern
of circular sun, with eyes, a nose
and a smile complete.]
She. That isn't a sun. It hasn't any
hair.
I. The sun doesn't have any hair,
Priscilla.
She (decisively). Nurse has hair.
[This really seems unanswerable.
Having amended Phoebus Apollo
I start in with my marmalade.
After a lapse of a few minutes a
low hammering is heard from
somewhere on the floor at the far
side of the table.]
I. Whatever are you doing, Priscilla 2
She. Sooing my horse.
[She is discovered beating the
wheels of a grey wooden flat-
backed animal on a stand with
a hammer procured from heaven
alone knows where.]
I. Well, don't hit him on the wheels,
anyhow. (A pause, subdued noises and
a sigh.) What are you doing now,
Priscilla 2 -
She. Sooing him on his back.
I. Doesn't that hurt him 2
She. It hurts him very much, but he
doesn't say any fing.
[I come round to give veterinary
advice.]
I. Don't you love your horse, Pris-
cilla 2
She. Yes, he's my friendly horse.
I. Well, don't bang him about like
that; all the paint's coming off him.
[The carpet is in fact bestrewn with
small flakes of grey paint from
It hasn't any
She (derisively). Ho! that isn't paint.
That's snorts. .
I(helplessly). Whateverdo you mean?
She. That's snorts. Snorts from his
mouf. White snorts.
I. But why is your horse snorting
from his mouth, Priscilla 2
She. He's snorting from his mouf
because I'm sooing him on his back.
Well, there you are, you know; what
is one going to do about it? There is a
sort of specious plausibility about these
replies after all; I am no farrier, but I
should think it quite likely that if you
shoed a cart-horse long enough on the
back with a large enough hammer he
would snort white snorts from his
mouth; and it's no use telling the girl
that she can't jump from realism to
romance in that disingenuous manner.
Besides she might start hammering the
wheels again. Or else she would say
that her horse said he was snorting,
and who am I to contradict a British
horse? I used to consider myself pretty
good at what are called back-answers
and I still believe that with a little
practice I could hold my own in White-
chapel or the House of Commons, but
there are subtle transitions about Pris-
cilla's method of argument with which
only a Prime Minister could cope. It
carries too many guns for me. It
cramps my style. -
A CORNISH COTTAGE.
BESIDE the clock two spaniels stand,
Two china spaniels golden-spotted;
On a lace d'oyley (contraband)
Beams a red-faced geranium (potted).
Framed portraits rest on woollen mats,
Black-bearded smugglers with their
spouses;
The gentlemen wear bowler hats,
The ladies sport their Sunday blouses.
Two pictures decorate the wall,
Vesuvius spouting sparks and ashes,
The brig Calypso in a squall,
Full-sailed despite the lightning
flashes.
Without, the dark Atlantic flings
Against the cliff its booming surges,
And, as a shell, the snug room rings
With its reverberating dirges.
Against the door the night winds rave
Like outcast dogs, their lot deplor-

Triumphant over wind and wave
Rises my landlord's lusty snoring.

Counsel. “OH, ABOUT six MonTHs."
LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.
BILLINGSGATE.
IN order to see Billingsgate properly
in action it is necessary to get up at
half-past four and travel on the Under-
ground by the first train East, which
is an adventure in itself. The first
train East goes at three minutes past
five, and there are large numbers of
people who travel in it every day; by
Charing Cross it is almost crowded.
It is full of Bolshevists; and I do not
wonder. One sits with one's feet up
in a first-class carriage, clutching a
nice cheap workman's ticket and trying
hard to look as if, like the Bolshevists,
one did this every day.
On arriving at the Monument Station
one walks briskly past the seductive
announcement that “THE MONUMENT
Is Now OPEN,” and plunges into a
world of fish. I have never been able
to understand why fish is so funny. On
the comic stage a casual reference to fish
is almost certain to provoke a shout of
laughter; in practice, and especially in
the mass, it is not so funny; it is like the
humour at a distance, and in the flesh
extraordinarily dull.
Over the small streets which sur-
round the market hangs a heavy pall
of fishy vapour. The streets are full
of carts; the carts are full of fish. The
houses in the streets are fish-dealers'
places, more or less full of fish. The
pavements are full of fish - porters,
carrying fish, smelling of fish. Frag-
ments of conversation are heard, all
about fish. Fish lie sadly in the gutters.
The scales of fish glitter on the pave-
ments. A little vigorous swimming
through the outlying fisheries brings
you to the actual market, which is even
more wonderful. Imagine a place like
Covent Garden, and nearly as big, but
entirely devoted to fish. In the place of
those enchanting perspectives of flower-
stalls, imagine enormous regiments of
fish-stalls, paraded in close order and
groaning with halibut and conger-eel,
with whiting and lobsters and huge
crabs. Round these stalls the whole-
sale dealers wade ankle - deep in fish.
Steadily, maliciously, the great fish slide
off the stalls on to the floor; steadily
up on their small counters, or cast them
through the air on to other counters, or
fling them into baskets in rage or morti-
fication or sheer bravado.
The dealers are men with business-
faces, in long white coats, surprisingly
clean. Every now and then they stop
throwing crabs into baskets or retriev-
ing halibut from the floor, and make
little entries in long note-books. I do
not know exactly what entries they
make, but I think they must all be in for
some competition, and are making notes
about their scores; one man I watched
had obviously just beaten the record
for halibut-recovery. He recovered so
many in about a minute that the tops of
his boots were just beginning to show.
When he had done that he made such
long notes in his book about it that
most of the halibut slid on to the floor
again while he was doing it. Then he
began all over again. But I expect he
won the prize.
Meanwhile about a million fish-
porters are dashing up and down the
narrow avenues between the fish-stalls,
porting millions of boxes of fish. Nearly

all of them, I am glad to say, have been

in the army or have had a relative in
the army; for they are nearly all wear-
ing the full uniform of a company cook,
which needs no description. On their
heads they have a kind of india-rubber
hat, and on the india-rubber hat they
have a large box of fish weighing about
six stone–six stone, I tell you. This
box they handle as if it was a box of
cigars. They pick it up with a careless
gesture; they carry it as if it was a
slightly uncomfortable hat, and they
throw it down with another careless
gesture, usually on to another box of
fish; this explains why so many of
one's herrings appear to have been
maimed at sea.
When they have finished throwing
the boxes about they too take out a
note-book and make notes about it all.
This, it seems, is to make sure that they
are paid something for throwing each
box about. I don't blame them. It
must be a hard life. Yet if I thought
I could pick up six stone of salmon and
plaice and throw it about I should sign
on at Billingsgate at once. It is true
they start work about five; but they stop
work, it seems, about ten, and they
earn a pound and over for that. Then
they can go home. Most of them, I
imagine, are stockbrokers during the
rest of the day.
And they are a refined and gentle-
manly body of men. I hope the old
legend that the fish-porter of Billings-
gate expresses himself in terms too
forcible for the ordinary man is now
exploded; for it is a slander. In fact
it is a slander to call him a “porter; ”
at least in these days I suppose it is
libellous to connect a man falsely with
the N.U.R., if only by verbal implica-
tion. But, however that may be, I
here assert that the Billingsgate fish-
porter is a comparatively smooth and
courteous personage, and, considering
his constant association with fish in
bulk, I think it is wonderful.
At the far end of the market is the
river Thames; and on the river Thames
there is a ship or two chockful of fish.
Fish-porters with a kind of blasé ani-
mation run up and down a long gang-
way to the ship with six-stone boxes of
fine fresh whiting on their heads. These
boxes they pile up on a chute (carefully
noting each box in their note-books),
after which an auctioneer auctions the
boxes. This is the really exciting part
of the show. The dealers or the dealers'
agents stand round in a hungry ring
and buy the boxes of fish as they slide
down the chute. The dealers seem to
detail a less cultured type of man for
this purpose, and few of the bidders
come up to the standard of refinement
of the fish-porters. But the auctioneer

their Christian names. He can tell at
a glance whether it is Mossy Isaacs or
Sam Isaacs. He is a very clever man.
They stand round looking at the
boxes of fish, and when one of them
twitches the flesh of his nose or faintly
moves one of his eyelashes it means
that he has bought six stone of whiting
for thirty shillings. That is the only
kind of sign they give, and the visitor
will be wise not to catch the auctioneer's
eye, or blow his nose or do any overt
action like that, or he may find that he
has bought six stone of salmon and
auction of fish it is true to say that a
nod is as good as a wink; in fact it is
Worse. -
The dealers are silent motionless
men; but nobody else is. Everybody
else is dashing about and shouting as
loud as he can. As each box of fish is
sold the porters dash at it and shout at
it (of course in a very gentlemanly way)
and carry it off in all directions. It is
quite clear that nobody knows who has
bought it and where it is going. The
idea of the whole thing is to impress
the visitor with the mobility of fish, and

understands them, and he knows all

doubt when the visitors have gone away
they settle down and decide definitely
whom the fish belongs to.
It is now about half-past six. Fish
is still rushing in at one end from the
ship and is rushing in at the other
from the railway-vans. The porters are
throwing the fish at the dealers' stalls
(registering each hit in their note-books),
and the dealers are throwing it on to
the floor or throwing it at each other
or trying to throw it at a retailer, who
always puts on a haughty air and passes
on to the next stall, till he too gets en-
tangled in the game and finds that he
has bought twenty-four stone of whit-
ing at twopence a pound; then he throws
it at some more porters, and the porters
dash outside and throw it at the carts,
and the carts clatter away to Kensing-

pence a pound, and the circle of fish

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 7th-" Has the right
hon. gentleman any experience of Sun-
day School treats?” asked Mr. INSKIP
after the MINISTER of TRANSPORT had
announced that the railway companies,
while conceding reduced fares for these
outings, could not extend the facilities
to more than one adult for every ten
children. Sir ERIC GEDDEs admitted
that his experience was “many years
ago.” There must have been “giants
in those days” among the Sunday
School teachers if one of them was able
to “moderate the transports” of ten
little ERICs.
The PRIME MINISTER had discarded
the jaunty grey suit which he wore last
week, and in his “blacks” looked rather
like a Scottish elder. Nevertheless, when
requested by Mr. MACCALLUM Scott to
interpret the articles of the “Auld Kirk”
he declined to rush in where Mr. BonAR
LAw had feared to tread, and contented
himself with the remark that this was
“a very dangerous question for a mere
Southerner.”
The negotiations with M. KRASSIN
caused many inquiries. Mr. WILLIAM
SHAw, for example, sought a guarantee
that the Bolshevists should not be al-
lowed to pay for the goods they might
now order with the stores that they
had seized from His Majesty's Govern-
ment. One is reminded of PHIL MAY's

ters philosophically,

Tuesday, June 8th.-The prevalent
belief that Mr. CHURCHILL is always
spoiling for a fight, and is mainly re-
sponsible for all the wars now going on
in various parts of the world, is, I am
ready to believe, entirely erroneous.
But there is no doubt of his desire to
“see red "so far as His Majesty's Army
is concerned. The report that the
Government intended to spend three
millions in putting our soldiers back
into the traditional scarlet inspired a
multitude of questions to the WAR SEC-
RETARY this afternoon. Mr. CHURCHILL
declared it to be grossly exaggerated.
Nevertheless, in political circles it is
believed that at the next election the
Government can rely with confidence
upon the nurserymaids' vote.
In resisting the proposal to make
a levy on capital Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
covered the ground so exhaustively
that, as Sir F. BANBURY subsequently
observed, the chief complaint to be
made of his speech was that it was not
delivered three months before, when it
would have saved the money-market
great anxiety and prevented much de-
preciation of capital. For, according
to the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer,
a levy on war-wealth was never really
practicable, and even if it had been
would have had no effect upon the
amount of the floating
debt, his most press-
ing problem. But, if
so, why not have said

You Don't MIND our
gation Bill passed through the usually
serene atmosphere of the Upper House,
but not without encountering a certain
number of “bumps.” Lord MoNTAGU,
calling to mind the nursery saying, “if
pigs could fly,” was alarmed by the
possibility that “air-hogs” might inter-
ſere with the amenities, and might even
endanger the lives, of earth-bound citi-
zens by flying over them at unduly low
altitudes. He suggested two thousand
feet as a minimum. Lord LONDONDERRY
resisted the Amendment on the ground
that it was difficult to gauge the height
at which aircraft flew, and thought few
airmen would care to risk the penalties
provided in the Bill—a fine of two hun-
dred pounds and six months' impris-
onment—by indulging a taste for for-
bidden stunts.
At first blush you would hardly think
it necessary to include the City Corpo-
ration among the local authorities who
may establish aerodromes. The “one
square mile” does not offer much en-
couragement to the airman who wishes
to make a safe landing. But you never
can tell what may happen. The “Old
Lady of Threadneedle Street,” who is
said to be contemplating an upward ex-
tension of her premises, may perhaps
welcome aeroplanes to her hospitable
| roof, and thereby give a new significance
to “banking” in the aviator's vocabu-
lary.
In the Commons the anomalous posi-
tion produced by President WILson's
of Armenia, although his country has
refused to accept the mandate for its
administration, elicited from Mr. BonAR
LAw the curious explanation that the
invitation to delimit was addressed to
Mr. WILsoN “in his personal capacity.”
But when Mr. BottomLEY sought fur-
ther light on this phrase Mr. LAw was
unable or unwilling to supply it. He
did, however, vouchsafe the information
that, whatever America might do, this
country would not add Armenia to its
existing share of “the white man's
burden.”
Thursday, June 10th.-It seems a
pity that since Count DE SALIs left
Montenegro and made his famous
secret report the British Government
has had no representative in that dis-
tracted country. In the absence of
official information the most diverse
descriptions of its present state gain
currency. According to Lord SYDENHAM
the Serbians, who wish to incorporate
Montenegro in the new Jugo-Slavia,
are taking every step to intimidate
their opponents (described as ninety
per cent. of the population) and have
incidentally imprisoned a number of
ex-Ministers. Lord CURzoN agreed
that this was quite probable, inasmuch
as ex-Ministers bore a considerable ratio
to the whole population, but otherwise
challenged Lord SYDENHAM's allega-
tions. His own information (source
not named) was that the Montenegrin
majority was in favour of Yugo-Slav
pression that all statements emanating
from the Black Mountain should be
taken cum grano DE SALIs.
In the Commons Mr. BonAR LAw
was taking a day off, and, as usually
happens when the PRIME MINISTER is
in charge, “a certain liveliness” pre-
vailed. The renewed offensive of Gen-
eral WRANGEL incited the Bolshevist
sympathisers to start one on their own
account. An attempt to move the ad-
journment was nipped in the bud by the
SPEAKER. Colonel WEDGwood made a
gallant effort to usurp the functions
of the Chair by declaring that the
matter was both definite and urgent;
but Mr. LowTHER replied that unfor-
tunately the decision rested with him
and not with the hon. Member.
The House then settled down to
business, and gave a Third Reading to
two Bills, and a Second Reading to
five others. On the Women, Young
Persons and Children (Employment)
Bill Mr. BARNEs took exception, not
unnaturally, to a clause permitting “the
employment of women and young per-
sons in shifts up to ten o'clock at night,”
and Major BAIRD undertook to consider
the withdrawal of this equivocal piece
of draftsmanship.

THE FUTURE OF APSLEY HOUSE.
- CoNFLICTING STATEMENTs.
THE possibility of a super-dancing-
saloon being erected on the site of
Apsley House is, we fear, likely to be
relegated to the limbo of lost oppor-
tunities.
It will be remembered that a few
weeks ago London in general and the
West-End in particular was excited and
delighted by the announcement that
Apsley House had been sold to an in-
fluential syndicate and would shortly
be converted into a massive and
monumental block, forty storeys high,
crowned with the dancing-saloon and
including a concert-hall with the most
powerful organ in the world, and a
swimming-bath with salt water con-
veyed by a special pipe from Brighton.
It will also be remembered that Mr.
Chumpley Swope, the chairman of the
syndicate, issued a powerful manifesto
in which he explained the purely hu-
manitarian motives of the enterprise
—to obliterate the militaristic associa-
tions of the site; to replace an un-
sightly building by a fabric which would
be one of the architectural glories of
London, and simultaneously to cheer
the patients in St. George's Hospital
with the sounds of harmony by night.
Unhappily the realisation of these
beneficent and artistic designs seems
likely to be indefinitely postponed, to
judge from the authoritative statements
made to our representative by Mr.
Doremus Pomerene, architect to the
owners, and by Mr. Chumpley Swope
himself.
“There never was any idea,” said
Mr. Pomerene, “in the minds of the
present owners, Mr. Otis Flather and
Mr. Virgil Onderdonk, of converting the
site of Apsley House to the uses of a
super-dancing-saloon. Mr. Flather is
a convinced opponent of the dancing
mania and President of the Anti-Tar-
antulation League, while Mr. Onder-
donk has always been a profound ad-
mirer of the great Duke of WELLINGTON.
Subject to the approval of the present
Duke it is our intention to re-erect
Apsley House on the Playing Fields at
Eton, and utilise the site for the build-
ing of flats for the New Poor.”
“The erection of a Neo-Georgian
super-dancing-saloon on the Piccadilly
frontage of Apsley House,” said Mr.
Chumpley Swope, “has long been the
dearest dream of my heart. My first
negotiations with Messrs. Shumway
and Prudden were conducted for the
express purpose of facilitating the real-
isation of this project. Moreover, when
Mr. Flather joined me in the purchase
of the entire site his representative, Mr.

plans and expressed his cordial ap-
proval thereof.
“Eventually my friends and I ac-
cepted offers made to us by Mr. Flather
whereby the entire site was vested
in him, subject to an agreement that
the Piccadilly frontage to a depth of
two hundred kilowatts should be re-
served for the erection of the dancing-
saloon, the concert-hall and the swim-
ming-bath.
“Owing however to the difficulties
connected with the laying of the pipe
from Brighton and the unaccountable
and irrational hostility displayed by the
Governing Body of St. George's Hos-
pital the plan of erecting this Temple
of Terpsichore has fallen into abeyance
and the West-End is threatened with
the loss of an educational asset of in-
that negotiations have been opened with
the Dean and Chapter of WESTMINSTER
and that I do not altogether despair of
obtaining an alternative site and making

fying and humanising London.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PERSISTENCE OF THE MILITARY.
IN pre-war days, when one's health was tested at the
order of a verbally polite but fundamentally distrustful in-
surance company, the examination was a pleasant affair,
conducted by a benign old gentleman who behaved like
one's own family physician.
Now all that is changed. I lately took the liberty of
offering to bet a Company that I would not live for ever, in
spite of my present rude health. In reply I was invited
“to meet our medical advisers at our office."
I arrived obediently at the appointed time and was
ushered into a room in which sat behind a table two elderly
gentlemen of ultra-military appearance. When, later, they
addressed each other as “Colonel” and “Major” I knew
that they were civilian dug-outs militarised by the War.
Colonel drew himself up and spoke to me in a C.O. voice:
“Well, what is the general state of your health 2"
I felt that it was up to me to play the old war-game,
even if it ruined my chance of getting insured. I therefore
started to enumerate the various minor ailments from which
I suffered.
“To begin with,” I explained, “I’ve sprained my wrist
rather badly and—”
“That won't prevent your holding a rifle,
Colonel severely.
“Then,” I continued, “sometimes I have a headache."
“Ah,” said Major, “and I suppose when you run uphill
your heart palpitates like a pea in a drum ?"
“Yes," I replied quickly, “it does do that. How did you
know 2 ''
Major laughed a laugh such as HINDENBURG himself
might have delivered. It was cold and mirthless and must
have hurt his face.
“Come,” said Colonel sharply, “let’s have no more of
this humbug. Drink and smoke less and keep yourself fit;
and don't come whining before us, complaining of this and
that. A few route marches will soon set you up."
“But, seriously,” I objected, “my health is not of the
best and I feel I ought to warn you that there are slight
disabilities in my constitution which * >
“Which make you,” interjected Major, “of course unfit to
do your duty.” His voice was like steel wire and I hated
him.
“Very well, then,” I answered calmly, “I will say no more.”
“You’d better not,” roared Colonel. “It's no use your
thinking you can impose on us. I've marked you down
A1. I'm sick to death of you fellows who try to get behind
a doctor directly your comfort is threatened. That disposes
of your case. About—turn ' "
Mechanically I left their presence. . . .
I don't know what the Insurance Company will make
of it when they find all their candidates passed as first-class
lives. Somebody ought to tell these doctors that the War
interrupted
is over.
ANOTHER POST-OFFICE HOLD-UP.
OUR post-office is to be found taking cover in one corner
of the village's general shop. Poetically it may be described
as between the lard and the lingerie. In prose the most
interesting thing to be said of it is that I was there this
morning.
It was while I was buying a box of matches that the
thought came to me that I might as well enjoy myself
thoroughly and have some stamps as well. There was
quite a crowd in the shop at the time, and we both moved
to the postal counter together. She, however, got in the
“One stamp, please,” she demanded, and went on, “You'll
never guess what I want it for.”
“Isn't it for a letter, then 2" asked the post-mistress, as
if, for instance, stamps might be used for holding down the
butter while the bread is rubbed against it.
“Yes, but who to ? That's the point. Our George!”
To me there did not seem much in this to cause a sensa-
tion, but it did. Question and answer flew backwards and
forwards as thick as reminiscences at a regimental dinner.
“Not young George 2"
“Yes, old George. We had a letter from him last week.
First we'd heard for six years.”
“Lordy, lordy,” said the post-mistress, “it only seems
yesterday that he went away. I remember '' and she
proved it by doing so for ten minutes with a volubility that
would have made the fortune of a patter comedian. At
the first sign of a pause I found the courage to ask for my
stamps, but quite in vain. The conversation was only
getting its second wind.
“Young George, to be sure |
all about him.”
I gathered that George was in the best of health and in
America, was unmarried and umpired out in a recent base-
ball match and wanted ” [“A dozen stamps, please."
This from me..]—a photograph of the old people and his
brothers and sisters. From this the transition was easy to
an uncle of the post-mistress's who went—” [“A dozen
stamps."]—to foreign parts. He always was a rolling stone,
he was. Never gathered no moss. On the other hand, there
were no flies on him. Did very well for himself, he did, and
when he died * *
But it was at this point that the moisture from the
margarine cask against which I had been leaning began to
make its presence felt, and, stampless, I left the shop.
At the edge of the village I met our policeman.
“Go quickly,” I implored him ; “there's a hold-up at the
post-office.” - -
Perhaps “quickly” is not quite the right word, but, at
any rate, he went. I doubt if he will get promotion over
the job, but I am sure he too will like to hear about our
George, if there's anything left to say by the time he gets
there. -
And how is he? Tell me

You have a magic feeling that you never could mistake;

THE PARADISE OF BARDS.
(From an Oxford Correspondent.)
CoNSIDERABLE resentment has been
caused in various centres of poetic ac-
tivity by the preference recently ex-
pressed by the PRIME MINISTER for the
products of Welsh minstrelsy. In a
letter addressed to HUw MENAI, the
working South Wales miner poet, Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE declares that he has
read his poems with the “greatest de-
light.” If the PREMIER had merely
said “great delight” no untoward con-
sequences would have ensued, but thein-
vidious use of the superlative threatens
to embroil the whole country in that
internecine war recently predicted by
the Editor of The Athenaeum in his
gloomy survey of Neo-Georgian litera-
ture.
Meetings of protest have been held in
Hampstead, at Letchworth, Stratford-
on-Avon and the Eustace Miles Restaur-
ant, but the most remarkable and orderly
of these demonstrations was that which
took place at Boar's Hill on Saturday
last, under the presidency of the PoET
LAUREATE. Boar's Hill, we need not
the fashionable intellectual suburb of
Oxford, and has been called the “Para-
dise of Bards.” Dr. BRIDGEs in a
brief opening address, speaking more in
sorrow than in anger, dealt with the
statistical side of the question. He
pointed out that of the residents at
Boar's Hill one in every six was a true
poet, and three out of every five were
masters of the art of prosody. There
were no miner poets on Boar's Hill.
Their motto was Majora camamus.
Professor GILBERT MURRAY, who
followed, laid stress on the perfect
harmony which reigned amongst the
residents, in spite of the fact that all
schools of poetry were represented,
from the austerest of classicists to
the most advanced exponents of Neo-
Georgian vers libre. They were a
happy family, linked together by a
common devotion to the Muses, and in
their daily output of verse showing a
higher unit of production than that
recorded of any other community in
either hemisphere.
Mr. John MASEFIELD moved the only
resolution, which was carried unani-
mously, to the effect that Mr. FISHER,
requested to convey to the PRIME
MINISTER the regret of the meeting
that he should have overlooked the
paramount claim of Boar's Hill to be
regarded as the Parnassus of Great
Britain. In Murray's Guide to Oxford-
shire it had been spoken of as “a health
resort for jaded students,” but that
was an obsolete libel. Constitutionally
vigorous and daily refreshed by draughts
from the pellucid springs of the Pierides,
they led a life of exuberant health, as
the vital statistics of the neighbourhood
would abundantly show. On Boar's
Hill people began to write poetry earlier
and continued to do so later than in
any other spot in the British Isles.
Sir ARTHUR Evans, in proposing a
vote of thanks to the Chairman, made
the gratifying announcement that Mr.
MASEFIELD was already engaged on a
companion poem to his “Reynard the
Fox,” commemorating the genius loci
under theinspiring title of “TheSticking
of the Pig.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
RECENT developments have given an unexpectedly topical
interest to a new book by Professor PAUL MILIUKov, LL.D.,
entitled Bolshevism ; an International Danger (ALLEN AND
UNwiN). The whole question of the de facto Government
of Russia is so fiercely controversial that it is not to be
expected that such a work should escape violent criticism
- from those for whom that Government can do no wrong,
though the writer justly claims that (however obvious his
own views) he has striven to be strictly fair to those of the
enemy. The scheme of his work has been “to trace the
evolution of Bolshevism from an abstract doctrine to a
practical experiment.” One may excusably find the history
a grim and menacing one. In the course of it Professor
MILIUkov. tells again the tragedy of the great betrayal
(which it will do no one harm to ponder upon just now),
when the Commander of the 1st corps of the Siberian
Army reported: “A brilliant success crowned our efforts ...
there remained before us only a few fortifications, and the
battle might soon have taken the character of a complete
destruction of the enemy.” But the work of M. LENIN had
been too thorough; instead of a victory that might have
ended the War and saved thousands of lives, we saw this
already triumphant army, equipped through British in-
dustry, melt into a disorganised rabble. Nor is the writer
less interesting on other aspects of his theme; in particular
an exposition of the notorious Third International and a
survey of the present-moment activities of Bolshevist pro-
paganda, notably in our own country. No one who wishes
to read and keep for reference a clearly written and
understandable survey of the most urgent problem in
modern politics need go further than this short but highly
the letter, he was acting in the spirit of those orders on the
The March to Paris and the Battle of the Marne, 1914
(ARNoLD), by Generaloberst ALEXANDER voN KLUCK, is
more of a soldiers', indeed a staff-officers', book than any
that has appeared here from the other side. It deals ex-
clusively with the operations of the German right wing,
Von KLUck's own (first) army and his liaison with the
second (Von BüLow's), during the move forward to the
Grand Morin, the allied counter-offensive and the establish-
ment of the line of the Aisne—that is from the twelfth of
August to the twelfth of September. The principal army
orders are given textually. An admirable map illustrates
each day's routes and billets for his first line and second
line troops, his cavalry and the extreme right of the second
army. Von KLuck's explanation of his breach of the
Supreme Command's orders and the manoeuvre which
exposed him to MANoURY's stroke was that, while ignoring
information available; that a pause to fulfil them literally
would have given the enemy time to recover; that defective
intelligence kept him ignorant of the fact that the German
left and centre had been definitely held by the French (if
he had known this he would not, he says, have crossed the
Marne). An examination of the frontispiece portrait sug-
gests that this fighting General would easily find excellent
reason for disobeying other people's orders and maintain
an obstinate defence of his own decisions once made, how-
ever disastrous in result. Notes by the historical section
(military branch) of the Committee of Imperial Defence
point out inaccuracies and contradictions which the lay
reader would be unlikely to discover for himself. He will
however, if I mistake not, appreciate a soldierly narrative,
unspoiled by “political” parentheses or underestimation of
opponents, of what was undoubtedly a great military feat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I have found in Lighting-up Time (Cobden-SANDERSON)
that all too rare thing, a theatrical novel of which the
vitality does not expire towards the end of the fourth
chapter. Obviously Mr. Ivor BRowN knows the life of
modern stageland, one would say, with the intimacy of
personal experience. More important still, he commands
an easy style and a flow of genial, not too esoteric, humour
that combine to keep the reader chuckling and curious to
the last page. His title is characteristic, Lighting-up Time
symbolising here that period in the career of an actress
when her possibly waning attractions need the illumination
of a judicious boom. The two main characters are Mary
Maroon, the leading lady, and Peter Penruddock, the astute
publicity agent who engages to set her upon her financial
and artistic pedestal. Peter, in other words, is Mary's tide,
taken at the flood in chapter one, and leading her, very
divertingly, on to fortune. Both the tour of Stolen or
Strayed and the company that present it are admirably
true to life, while Mr. Brown has even been able con-
vincingly to suggest the atmosphere of theatrical Oxford,
it is because the publishers have put his picture on the
paper cover. He looks much too stalwart and sophisti-
cated to be toying with such gossamer fantasies.
I doubt whether the complications which attend the devolu-
tion of dead men's property were created for the confusion
of survivors or for the convenience of novelists. In the case
of The Lost Mr. Linthwaite (HopDER AND SToUGHToN),
Mrs. Byfield had married Mr. Byfield, or at least she thought
she had, and Mr. Byfield had died, supposedly intestate.
Previously Mrs. Byfield had married Mr. Melsome, or again
she thought she had, and Mr. Melsome had disappeared and
was assumed to be dead, leaving nothing behind him except
a brother as vile as himself. The following discoveries
were made by her in due sequence: That Mr. Melsome was
not dead and that therefore she was not Mrs. Byfield but
Mrs. Melsome, that Mr. Melsome was already married when
he purported to marry her, and that therefore she was not
Mrs. Melsome but Mrs. Byfield; and that a solicitor's clerk
was absconding with the bulk of the Byfield estate, which,
when in due course
his mummers de-
scend upon that
home of lost co-
medies and impos-
sible revues. If I
have a complaint
against the book it
is that a tale of
such pleasant irony
hardly needed the
general pairing-off
with which the au-
thor rings down his
curtain; but for this

have more easily

These are what Mr.

very aptly calls the

plot, which thick.

from first page to

handling of them
by the evil but tal-
ented Melsome
brothers, the acci-
(MILLS AND Boon),
and they embrace a variety of subjects, ranging from
crocuses in Kensington Gardens to corpse-boats on the
Tigris. They are all, whether sentimental, satirical or
pathetic, fiction of the lightest type. Such literature was
minently readable during the War—most of Mr. Dion
LAYTON CALTHROP's bits have to do with somebody's “bit”
—when a touch of conventional pathos and pretended
cynicism and a generous padding of humour, real or forced,
provided sufficient relaxation from the strain of anxious
hours. But the wisdom of republishing them in book form
in these sober days of peace is open to question. When
Mr. CALTHROP talks satirically of “perfect officials” or of
an earnest young American aviator who writes letters home
in a United States dialect that was never heard on land or
sea outside Bayswater, or of the war-time adventures of
one Mr. Mason, skipper, and Mr. Smith, his mate, he is
tolerably amusing. When he becomes serious, as in “The
Prayer of the Classical Parson" and “When the Son Came
Home,” his limitations become increasingly apparent. Yet
it is in this vein that he gives us what is by all odds his
best bit, “The Chevalier of Carnaby Row.” When he
writes of Cupids and fauns and Columbines and rose-leaves

FLETCHER tells his story well, but up to the very last
moment I was looking and hoping for a surprise and was sus.
pecting those legalities of being a deception invented to make
the surprise all the greater. A first-class adventure, in my
opinion spoilt by the sacrifice of originality to technicality.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ART OF POETRY.
III.
IN this lecture I shall deal with the
production of Lyrics, Blank Verse and
(if I am allowed) Hymns (Ancient and
Modern).
First we will write a humorous lyric
for the Stage, bearing in mind, of course,
the peculiar foibles, idiosyncrasies and
whims of Mr. Alf Bubble, who will sing
it (we hope). Mr. Bubble's principal
source of fun is the personal appearance
of his fellow-citizens. Whenever a new
character comes on the stage he makes
some remark about the character's
“face.” Whenever he does this the
entire audience rolls about on its seat,
and cackles and gurgles and wipes its
eyes, and repeats in a hoarse whisper,
with variations of its own, the uproari-
ous phrasing of Mr. Bubble's remark.
If Mr. Bubble says, “But look at his
face 1" the audience, fearful lest its
neighbours may have missed the cream
of the thing, splutters hysterically in
the intervals of eye-wiping and cough-
ing and choking and sneezing, “He
said, “What a face l’” or “He said, “Did
you see his face?’” or “He said, ‘Is it
a face 2'"
All this we have got to remember
when we are writing a lyric for
Mr. Bubble. Why Mr. Bubble of all
people should find so much mirth in
other men's faces I can't say, but there
it is. If we write a song embodying
this great joke we may be certain that
it will please Mr. Bubble; so we will
do it.
Somebody, I think, will have made
some slighting remark about the
Government, and that will give the
cue for the first verse, which will be
political.
We will begin:- -
Thompson . . . .
Idon't know why the people in humor.
ous lyrics are always called Thompson
(or Brown), but they are.
Thompson, being indigent,
Thought that it was time he went
Into England's Parliament,
To earn his daily bread . . . .
That is a joke against Parliament,
you see—Payment of Members and all
that ; it is good. At the same time it
is usual to reserve one's jokes for the
chorus. The composer, you see, re-
serves his tune for the chorus, and, if
the author puts too much into the
verse, there will be trouble between
their Unions.
Now we introduce the face-motif:—
Thompson's features were not neat;
When he canvassed dahn our street
Things were said I won't repeat,
And my old moth-ah said:—
metre and rhyme; I don't know how
that has happened; it ought not to be.
Now we have the chorus:—
“Oh, Mr. Thompson,
It isn't any good;
I shouldn't like to vote for you,
So I won't pretend I should ;
I know that you're the noblest
Of all the human race . . . .”
That shows the audience that face
is coming very soon, and they all get
ready to burst themselves.
“I haven't a doubt, if you get in,
The Golden Age will soon begin—
But I Don't LIKE-your FACE.”
At this point several of the audience
will simply slide off their seats on to the
floor and wallow about there, snorting.
The next verse had better be a love-
Verse.
Thompson wooed a lovely maid
Every evening in the shade,
Meaning, I am much afraid,
To hide his ugly head . . . .
Head is not very good, I admit, but
we must have said in the last line, and
as we were mad enough to have rhymes
in the first verse we have got to go on
with it.
But when he proposed one night—
Did it by electric light—
Mabel, who retained her sight,
Just looked at him and said:—
Now you see the idea?
“Oh, Mr. Thompson,
It isn't any good;
I shouldn't like to marry you,
So I won't pretend I should ;
I know that you have riches
And a house in Eaton Place . . .
(Here all the audience pulls out its
handkerchief)
I haven't a doubt that you must be
The properest possible match for me,
But I Don'T LIKE-your FACE.”
I have got another verse to this song,
but I will not give it to you now, as I
think the Editor is rather bored with
it. It is fortunate for Mr. Bubble that
he does not have to perform before an
audience of Editors.
Having written the lyric the next
thing to do is to get a composer to com-
pose music for it and then you get it
published. This is most difficult, as com-
posers are people who don't ever keep
appointments, and music publishers
like locking up lyrics in drawers till the
mice have got at the chorus and the
whole thing is out of date.
By the time that this song is ready
Mr. Bubble may quite possibly have
exhausted the face-motif altogether
and struck a new vein. Then we shall
have wasted our labour. In that case
we will arrange to have it buried in
somebody's grave (Mr. Bubble's for
choice), and in 2000 A.D. it will be dug
up by antiquaries and deciphered. Even
Manuscript in time. I ought to add that
I myself have composed the music for
this lyric, but I really cannot under-
take to explain composing as well as
poetry.
The serious lyric or Queen's Hall
Ballad is a much easier affair. But
I must first warn the student that
there are some peculiar customs at-
taching to this traffic which may at
first sight appear discouraging. When
you have written a good lyric and in-
duced someone to compose a tune for
it, your first thought will be, “I will
get Mr. Throstle to sing this, and he
will pay me a small fee or royalty per
performance;” and this indeed would
be a good arrangement to make. The
only objection is that Mr. Throstle, so
far from paying any money to the
student, will expect to be paid about
fifty pounds by the student for singing
his lyric. I do not know the origin of
this quaint old custom, but the student
had better not borrow any money on
the security of his first lyric.
For a serious or Queen's Hall lyric
all that is necessary is to think of some
natural objects like the sun, the birds,
the flowers or the trees, mention them
briefly in the first verse and then in the
second verse draw a sort of analogy or
comparison between the natural object
and something to do with love. The
verses can be extremely short, since in
this class of music the composer is
allowed to spread himself indefinitely
and can eke out the tiniest words.
Here is a perfect lyric I have written.
It is called, quite simply, Evening:—
Sunshine in the forest,
Blossom on the tree,
And all the brave birds singing
For you—and me.
Kisses in the sunshine,
Laughter in the dew,
And all the brave world singing
For me—and you.
I see now that the dew has got into
the second verse, so it had better be
called quite simply The Dawn.
You notice the artistic parallelism of
this lyric; I mean, “The brave birds
singing" in one verse and “The brave
world singing "in the next. That is a
tip I got from Hebrew poetry, especially
the Psalms: “One day telleth another;
and one night certifieth another,” and so
on. It is a useful trick to remember, and
is employed freely by many modern
writers, the author of “The King's
Regulations,” for example, who in
Regulation 1680 has the fine line:–
“Disembarkations are carried out in a
similar manner to embarkations.”
That goes well to the Chant in C major
by Mr. P. HuMPHREYs.
But I am wandering. It is becoming
This verse, you notice, is both in
clear to me now that I shall not have time
a lyric like this may become an Old

of work is a good refrain or central idea;

the others.

II.--THE MIDDLE-CLAss MoTHER.
By Lady Wi Fitzermine, Leader of Society's Revels.
ARE we growing dull 2 That is a question which in
these pip-inducing times of peace one is frequently con-
strained to ask; and in the view of many, I fear, there can
be but one answer. -
During the late lamented War it was almost impossible
for any rightly constituted woman to experience the pangs
of boredom. When one wasn't making things vibrate in the
hospitals of France and Flanders there was always abund-
ance of excitement on the Home Front—flag-days, tableaux,
theatricals, dances and other junketings in aid of this or
that charity. And when the supply of charities threatened
to run dry it was always a simple matter to invent new
ones. All you had to do was to organise a drawing-room
meeting, put the names of the Allied nations in one hat
and of the more or less recognised necessaries of life in
another and draw out one paper from each receptacle.
You there and then registered a new charity out of the
result and advertised some thrillingly expensive form of
entertainment in support of the Society for the Supply of
Chewing-gum to the Czecho-Slovakians, or any other equally
pathetic cause.
In those days a charity began at an At Home and usually
ended at the Coliseum or the Albert Hall—or (in a few
unfortunate cases) in the Bankruptcy Court. Nowadays,
however, people are deplorably sceptical on the subject of
new appeals to the pocket, and many folk find time hanging
of what I may call the organising class to break down the
walls of this growing prejudice, which, if not checked in
time, threatens to add seriously to the general volume of
unrest. Hence it is necessary to scrap a good many of our
old ideas and to realise that for all essential purposes the
exotic form of charity is played out. To-day a Society
woman who wishes to maintain her position as arbiter
elegantiarum must tap other sources of inspiration and
supply.
It is in these circumstances that I confidently fall back
upon the Middle-Class Mother. After all, who was always
the chief financial support of my wartime enterprises?
The Middle-Class Mother. It was to her heart that the cry
of the Croat, the moan of the Montenegrin, the ululation of
the Yugo-Slav made its most effective entry. It was she
who lavished her husband's pay or profits on the entrancing
vision of the Countess of Bustover as Britannia or of Lady
Aaronson as England's Girlhood. So I have determined
that she shall now have a show to herself, and we shall
see whether she will subscribe to her own charity as whole.
heartedly as she did to those of our suffering Allies.
Without a doubt the Middle-Class Mother is a very
deserving institution and has done extremely good work in
the past, which I regret that the space at my disposal does
not permit me to particularise. I must perforce content my-
self with announcing that on her behalf a grand Zoological
Fancy Dress Ball will be held next month at Valhalla, which
will be converted for the occasion into a realistic repre-
sentation of a Bear Garden. I myself am appearing as
Queen of the Polar Bears, and by way of augmenting the
takings I propose to sell hugs at a guinea per head. The
whole of the proceeds, after the expenses have been deducted,
will go to the Middle-Class Mothers' Mutual Criticism
Society, an animated body of which I have the privilege
to be founder and hon, president. -
MAIDEN'S BOWER ROCKS, SCILLY.
It was an earl's daughter, she lived in a tower
(Ding-dong, ding-a-dong-dey),
And she was as fair as the loveliest flower
That nods in the girdle of May.
The floor of her bower was strewn with green rushes;
Full many knights' banners hung waving above ;
And round her young minstrels stood singing like thrushes
Brave ballads of lovers and love,
Dove-
Wooings and cooings of love.
But over their harping and over their singing,
When twilight came mantled in lilac and grey,
Would sound the sweet clangour of chapel-bells ringing
“Ding-dong, ding-a-dong-dey,”
From over the hills and away.
It was an earl's daughter, she lived in a tower
(Ding-dong, ding-a-dong-dey),
But the salt sea arose in a terrible hour
And smothered her singing in spray.
It changed her to rock, and she lies in her chamber,
Her faithful stone minstrels all crouched by her side;
Above her, weed banners of crimson and amber
Wave slow in the sweep of the tide,
Glide
Hither and yon on the tide.
Yet down through the fathoms of twilit green water
Where eerie lights glimmer and strange shadows sway,
The steamer bells ring to the earl's little daughter,
“Ding-dong, ding-a-dong-dey,”

GETTING FIXED.
“Now mind, my boy, what you've
got to do is to tell all your friends you
are out looking for a job, and they'll
give you introductions. Nothing like
'em ; a friend at court, you know, and
all that.” This was from one of the
friends to whom I had applied for a post.
The advice was all he had to offer me.
I acted on it, and found my friends
only too ready to give the required
introductions. With alacrity they min-
uted me on from one to another till I
felt as if “passed to you, please " had
been scrawled all over me. But I
persevered, and eventually weeded out
from my list of introductions half-a-
dozen that were addressed to solid men,
high up in the City, who might be
counted on not to miss the chance of a
good thing. That is how in the early
days of the Peace I was disposed to re-
gard a demobilized young officer who
had worn red tabs.
The first name on my selected list
was John Pountney, of the firm of
Laurence, Pountney & Co. My wife's
uncle had been at school with John
Pountney's brother, who unfortunately
had no connection with the firm. But
no matter; I filled up a form in the
outer office—“Nature of Business, per-
introduction attached. John Pountney
saw me. He did all the talking in
quite an affable manner, told me of his
son's experiences in the War, deplored
the high price of petrol and his wife's
difficulties in obtaining servants, and
then : “Well, let's get to business.
So you would like good employment in
the City? What can you do?”
I began: “Well, Sir, when I was
on the Staff ” He interrupted:
“Now, don't go on to say that you can
organise;" and he shook a finger at me
playfully and was off once more with
an anecdote about an officer in his son's
regiment.
Eventually I found myself being
bowed out in a rather dazed condition.
Only one thing emerged at all clearly
out of the whole interview; and I took
from my pocket a sheet of paper, on
which I had jotted down my most
telling qualifications, and with a stub
of blue pencil regretfully but firmly
biſfed out item No 1, Organising
Ability.
I next approached the firm of Wal-
brook Bros., armed with a letter from
a man who had once belonged to the
same golf-club as the senior Walbrook
brother.
“I can't read your friend's name,”
said this magnate, “but whoever he
sort of man who might be useful in
my business. What can you do?"
and he leaned back patiently in his
chair, finger-tips to finger-tips, but
with all the appearance of one ready to
pounce at my first weak statement.
“For the best part of four years," I
began, “I have been living in Frie

He pounced. “Ah, French ' I thought
so. Now if you had said Spanish, or
even Russian . . . "
He frowned as the thought crossed
his mind that I might yet say either of
them. But I didn't, and he was free to
expatiate on the alleged advantages of
Spanish and a sound commercial educa:
tion. The end was that I found myself
once more in the street, this time
erasing the word “Languages" from
my dwindling list.
And so it went on. Mr. Hall, of the
firm of Copt and Basing Hall, begged
me not to speak of any capacity I might
possess for controlling men. (Item
No. 3: Disciplinary Power and Habit of
Command.) He himself was able to do
all the controlling that his staff would
be likely to require. Mr. Throgmorton,
managing director of the firm of Capel
Sons and Threadneedle, Ltd., hoped at
the outset that I would not speak of my
mathematical proficiency. Many men

ematics. He feared I might be one of
them from the fact that I had begun to
speak of (item No. 4) the tabulation and
co-ordination of statistics.
After a week of this sort of thing I
had acquired nothing but experience,
and my experience now gave me an
idea. I drew up a new list of important
firms to which I had received no intro-
ductions at all, and selected one which
I knew was presided over by a man of
almost world-wide fame. Taking my
courage and nothing else in my hands,
I entered the inquiry-office.
“Slip, please,” I said briskly to the
youth behind the counter, and he
handed me the customary form. Dis-
regarding the spaces to be filled in, I
scribbled diagonally across the paper
the name of the great man, and wrote
underneath : “Have called in passing,
and cannot stay many minutes.”
This I signed and handed to a mes-
senger, remarking in a hurried and
off-hand manner, “Say that, if he's
engaged, I'd rather come another day,
as I don't want to miss the 12.5 to
I had no desire to catch it either;
but Hatfield is where the great man
lives. This was my ingenious method
of getting through the outer defences,
and it worked. The youth behind the
counter supposed I must be a personal
friend (did I mention that I have an
“air” and a power of controlling 2 . . .
Ah, yes, item No. 3), and sped the
messenger on his way. Not only so,
but my message must have deceived
the great one himself, for I was ad-
mitted to the Presence immediately.
He stood before me, holding my slip
in his hand, with a puzzled frown on
his face. The frown deepened as he
failed to recognise me.
“You need have no fear,” I said; “I
have no letter of introduction.” And I
smiled pleasantly at him.
His look of apprehension vanished,
and I continued, unfolding my blue-
pencilled list of accomplishments:—
“Listen : I am no organiser; my
knowledge of French may be dismissed
as negligible (this from the man with
whom Jeanne Vincent had deigned to
fess no power of controlling my fellow-
men; my mathematical ability isn't
worth a rap, and, as to statistics, I
neither tabulate nor co-ordinate them
with any degree of readiness.” There-
upon I bowed, with hands extended, as
who should say, “You behold me;
that's the sort of man I am.”
He smiled faintly. “Excuse me,
but what can you do?”
“That,” said I, “is for you to dis-
cover. If, when I shall have worked in
your office for say three months "-he
started—“you are una&e to find any
use for me, then you are not the kind
of man I take you for.” And I drew
myself up, striking what I hoped was a
dignified attitude.
He stared at me for some seconds.
“You have references?” he asked.
“Of course,” I answered, “but I
know enough not to produce them till
they are called for.”
Then he pressed a bell. “I am
going,” he said, “to introduce you to

cations which I think may be useful

THE ESSENTIALS OF GOLF.
“Do you know anything about
golf?" I asked Pottlebury by way of
making conversation with a compara-
tive stranger, and immediately after-
wards knew I had made a mistake. I
should have inquired, “Do you golf?”
or “Are you a golfer 2" and no evasion
would have been possible.
“I should think I do,” he replied.
“I suppose there's hardly a course
between here and Strathpeffer that I
haven't visited. English and Scottish,
I know them all.”
“And which is your favourite course?”
“That is a difficult question,” he re-
marked judicially. “Only last night
I was arguing about the comparative
merits of Westward Ho! and St. An-
drews. Both are easily accessible from
the railway, but if you take your car
the latter is to be preferred. You get
your life bumped out of you on those
North Devon roads.”
“I wasn't thinking of the travelling
facilities,” I observed coldly.
“No, of course. It's what you find
travelling aside, there is much to be said
for Sandwich. The members' quarters
are comfortable—very comfortable.”
I must have made a disparaging ges-
ture, for he immediately continued:—
“But, if it's only lunch you want, I
advise those Lancashire clubs round
Southport. They know how to lunch
in those parts—Tweed salmon, Welsh
mutton and Whitstable oysters.”
“No doubt your judgment is correct,”
I replied, “but I x -
“And at one of them they keep a
real French chef who knows his busi-
ness. I wouldn't wish for a better
cuisine anywhere.”
“There are other things,” I remarked
loftily, “besides those you mention.”
“Exactly; that's why I like to see a
good bridge-room attached and enough
tables to accommodate all comers. They
have that at Spotworth. You can often
get a game of poker as well.”
“But don't you see,” I exclaimed,
“that all these things are mere acces-
sories and circumstances 2"
“That is true,” he murmured; “they
are but frames as it were of the human
equal a crowd of jolly good fellows in
the smoking-room. I've had some ex-
cellent times down at Bambury—stayed
yarning away to all hours. Some of
the best fellows I ever met belonged to
that club.”
“You don't talk at all like a golfer,"
said I.
Pottlebury laughed. “I was for-
getting. If it's whisky you want you
can't beat Dornoch and Islay. . We've
nothing in England to touch them.
Why, I've met some of the keenest
golfers of the day at Islay—nothing

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 14th.-As an Ulster
Member, Mr. LINDSAY protested against
the availability of return-tickets, be-
tween Ireland and England having been
reduced from six months to two. Sir
ERIC GEDDEs explained that the change
had been made to stop the illicit traffic
in return-halves, though he hastened to
disclaim any suggestion that Members
of Parliament were concerned in it.
The grievance is probably not of large
dimensions. It is difficult to under-
stand why anyone leaving Ireland in
these days should want to go back
there.
The PRIME MINISTER did not seem to
favour the suggestion, pressed upon him
from many quarters, that the Govern-
ment should cause an estimate to be
made of the national income, and then
limit public expenditure to a definite
proportion of that amount. A private
person may cut his coat according to
his cloth, but the Government, he
argued, is unfortunately obliged by cir-
cumstances to reverse the process.
Even so the taxpayer may be forgiven
for thinking that the State costume
still bears some superfluous trimmings.
When economy is proposed, however,
it is not always popular. Sir John
BUTCHER, in protesting against the
Government's proposal to sell the
Brussels, the late Captain FRYATT's
ship, was expressing a wide - spread
feeling. But Colonel LESLIE WILSON
disarmed criticism by pointing out that
if all British vessels with heroic asso-
ciations were to be kept as exhibition-
ships a large proportion of the British
mercantile marine would be laid idle.
A few years ago the General Manager
of one of the English railways—the
late Sir GEoRGE FINDLAY, I think—de-
clared that he could look after the whole
of the Irish railways and have three
days a week left for fishing. Nowadays,

the best part of two days has been
occupied in deciding whether in the
new scheme for the government of
Ireland they should be administered
by the Central Council or the two Par-
liaments, and under the compromise
eventually reached they will be more ||
or less subject to all three authorities.
The debate was chiefly remarkable
for the evidence it provided that the
Ulstermen are developing into the
strongest of Home Rulers—almost Sinn
Feiners, according to one of their critics
—where their own province is con-
cerned.
Tuesday, June 15th.-Mr. CHURCHILL

and pipeclay would entail extra labour
and expense upon the private soldier.

under consideration brought protests
from Scottish Members, who evidently
thought that their own national warriors
should have a monopoly of this form
pointed out that the Irish Guards were
already provided with bagpipes, and
Lt.-Commander KENworthy horrified
the Scots by declaring that the pipes
were not an indigenous product of their
country, but had been imported from
Ireland many centuries ago.
Further progress was made with the
Government of Ireland Bill. A pro-
posal to strengthen the representation
of the minority in the Southern Parlia-
ment was sympathetically received by
Mr. LoNG, who thought, however, that
the Government had a better method.
As that consists in a proposal to exact
the oath of allegiance from every candi-
date for election and to give the KING
in Council power to dissolve any Parlia-
ment in which more than half the
members have not taken the oath, it is
sufficiently drastic. Having regard to
the present disposition of the Sinn
Feiners there seems to be mighty little
prospect of a Parliament in Dublin
before the date known in Ireland as
“Tib's Eve.”
Wednesday, June 16th.-In both
Houses Addresses were moved praying
His Majesty to appoint two additional
Judges of the King's Bench Division.
The motions met with some opposi-
tion, principally on the score of
economy, and it was suggested that
no additions to the Bench would be
required if the existing Judges resumed
the old practice of sitting on Saturdays.
This drew from the Lord CHANCELLOR
the interesting information that the
Judges devoted their Saturdays to
reading “the very lengthy papers that
were contained in their weekly dossier.”
It is no doubt the great length of
these documents that accounts for the
peculiar shape of the bag that Mr.
Justice —'s attendant was carrying
when I met him at Sandwich a few
Saturdays ago.
Lord BIRKENHEAD soothed the econo-
mists by pointing out that the new
Judges would probably more than earn
their salaries of five thousand pounds
a year. In accordance with the pre-
vailing tendency court-fees are to be
raised, and at Temple Bar as in Savile
Row our suits will cost us more.

duced a debate of extraordinary ferocity.
Young Tories like Mr. ORMSBY-GoRE
vied with old Liberals like Mr. Asquit H
(on whom the phosphates, plus the
Louth, election, had a wonderfully
tonic effect) in denouncing the iniquity
of an arrangement by which (as they
said) the principles of the League of
Nations were being thrown over, and
this country was revealed as a greedy
monopolist. Thus assailed both by
friend and foe Mr. BonAR LAw required
all his cool suavity to bring the House
back to a sense of proportion, and to
convince it that in securing a supply
of manure for British farmers the Gov-
ernment were not committing a crime
against the comity of nations.
Answering questions for the Irish
Government in these days is rather a
melancholy business, but the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL for IRELAND resembles Dr.
Johnson's friend, in that “cheerfulness
will keep breaking in.” Thus he excused
the Government's non-interference with
the Sinn Fein “courts,” whose writ
now runs over half Ireland, on the
ground that for all he knew they might
be voluntary courts of arbitration; and
hope that he would at least take steps
to protect the British public from the
criminals “transported" by sentence
of these mysterious tribunals he blithely
disclaimed responsibility, and said he
was quite content that they should be
out of Ireland.
Considering the counter-attraction of
the Ascot Gold Cup, Mr. BALFour had
a surprisingly numerous audience for
his discourse on the League of Nations.
His enumeration and analysis of the
League's various enemies were in his
happiest vein of philosophical humour.
His conclusion was that the League
had much less to fear from its avowed
foes than from its fanatical friends, who
were already attempting to put upon it
tasks for which it was unfitted, and
even to supply it with an International
Police Force. Its proper weapons were
not armies and aircraft, but Delay and
Publicity.
This formula, so reminiscent of Wait
and See, did not prevent Mr. Asquith
from hinting in the politest manner
that the League was not likely to pre-
vent the wars of the future unless it
made some effort to stop those now in

Viviana Smith was born in Battersea.
At twelve years old she ran about the
streets with holes in her stockings and
played a complicated game with chalk
squares and a stone. She had the
accent of London streets, which is the
only accent that can pierce through the
noise of London traffic. But she had
hair the colour of marsh-marigolds, a
Vorticist mouth and patent enlargeable
eyes. In the street she made eyes at
errand-boys, and at school she made
eyes so large that there was no room
to dot them.
At the age of seventeen she went in
for the Purple Pomegranate film com-
petition, and was selected from five
hundred thousand candidates to be a
motion-picture star. She starred some.
At the beginning she played in roman-
tic comedy films with woodland scenery
and rustic bridges and pools where she
tickled for trout. She tickled so well

when Major O'NEILL expressed the
that one could almost hear the trout
progress.

secret patent was being taken out of the

arriving in motor-cars and going up
flights of steps with their faces turned
to the audience and going down flights
of steps with their faces turned to the
audience and getting into motor-cars
again. They never missed a step. There
is something about this feat which
holds a cinema audience spellbound.
Later she rode on untamed mustangs
and fell over cliffs gagged and bound,
and sometimes she was even promoted
to slide or twirl into a bakehouse and
tumble with a talented cast of actors
and actresses into a large trough of
dough. When they had wiped the
dough off they all came back into the
bakehouse one after another and tum-

she made him giddy. He had seen her

her beautiful lips ripple into a thousand
artless expressions of grief and joy. He
did not know whether he loved her

and fell over cliffs gagged and bound,

One day Viviana met Ignatius Vava-
sour, the poet. For two years he had
worshipped her afar on the screen. He
had seen her in so many reels that
she made him giddy. He had seen her
in Youth's Yodelling May-tide Hour,
length five reels, and in Hate's Hideous
Hand of Crime, length six reels, and
in Gertie Flips the Flap-jack over,
length seven reels and a half. He had
never heard her speak, but he had seen
her beautifullips ripple into a thousand
artless expressions of grief and joy. He
did not know whether he loved her
most when she was tripping through
a silvan glade, with meadow-sweet in
her hand, or when she was gliding
gracefully over Niagara Falls in a tar-
barrel; when she was cracking the
door of a strong room with a jemmy
or when she was getting the dough out
of her hair with a rake. But as soon
as he had seen her out of the pictures
he knew that he loved her best as she
was. He knew that he could not live
without her. He told her so.
“But, Mr. Vavasour,” she protested.
“Call me Iggie,” he cried.
“But you have only known me such
a short time,” she said. “You have
seen me, you say, a hundred times on
the films, and Idaresay you admired me
immensely, but tell me this, Iggie, Is

he exclaimed.

to drink. He even had thoughts of
standing for Parliament. But he soon
found that the sorrow gnawing at his
heart was one that politics could never
assuage nor alcohol drown, not at least
at the present price of green Char-

One day as he slouched miserably
along the pavement he saw the adver-
tisement of a lecture outside the door
of an institute. “The Ideal in Philo-
sophy and Art,” said the placard; and,
scarcely knowing what he did, Ignatius
went in. But the lecturer had barely
begun to expound his theme, which he
did in the following forcible words:“The

wild light flashed in the poet's eyes

IMPORTUNITY.
WHEN the club secretary first wrote
and told me that it was proposed to
acquire two pictures (one Naval and one
Military), which were to hang in the
club as worthy reminders of the Great
War to future generations—when he
wrote and told me this, and suggested
(apparently as an afterthought) that a
cheque from me would further the pro-
ject, I was content to keep the matter
in view.
When he wrote, some months later,
and told it me all over again, accom-
panying the afterthought on this occa-
sion with a printed subscription form,
I took the trouble to reply, letting him
know that I was keeping the matter
in view.
When he wrote a third time, afford-
ing me a glimpse of the guileless faith
he had in me, I felt genuinely sorry for
the poor chap.
He said there were many possible
reasons to account for the non-arrival
of my cheque. I might, for example,
be abroad, somewhere out of reach of
postal facilities, or perhaps the cheque
had been lost in the post. Of one thing
only he was sure—there had been no
parsimonious intent on my part.
I was able in some sort to relieve
his mind of anxiety by mentioning that
I was still a resident at the address in
Cheshire under which I last wrote to
him. I even assured him that, so long
as my tailor did not forsake his present
attitude of friendly remonstrance, it
was improbable that I should proceed
abroad. Nor had I as yet any reason
to suspect that great public institution,
the post. The fact was that I still had
the matter in view.
As regards the pictures, I said that I
had a friend who was in love with the
daughter of an A.R.A., and who, in
telling me about a financial controversy
between himself and his prospective
father-in-law, had let slip the informa-
tion that a slump in artists' prices was
imminent. In view of this I suggested
that the agreement with the artists
commissioned by the club should for
the present be a verbal one and elastic
in its wording.
In the last part of my letter I re-
viewed the history of my own connec-
tion with the club, covering a period of
five years. I recalled the epoch-mak-
ing day when I received my first letter
from Mr. Secretary—a letter acquaint-
ing me of the fact that I was a full-
blown member—all but, at least. What
was thirty guineas? And each year
since then, I reminded him, I had dis-
bursed a further ten guineas without a

I pleaded a moral right to dispose of
the balance. I suggested that seventy-
three pounds nine shillings and two-
pence three - farthings (waiving the
question of interest) might be sufficient
to buy a third War picture, the interior
of a Government office during the tea-
hour, or something of that sort. I begged
that he would lay the matter before the
Committee.
I am not very hopeful about my
letter. Probably he has spent that
seventy-three pounds odd already on
stationery and postage-stamps.
I think that, if it finds its way into
print, I may send him half the proceeds
of this article. No harm in keeping
the matter in view, at all events.
MUSICAL NOTES.
(By our Modernist Critic).
A CERTAIN amount of dissatisfaction
has been expressed with the Negro
Rhapsody by Mr. JoHN Powell, per-
formed by the New York Symphony
Orchestra at their concert last week.
According to the analytical programme
the composer has sought inter alia to
depict “the degenerative frenzy of a
Woodoo orgy" and “the physical im-
pulses of the adult human animal,” cul-
minating in “a flood of primal sensual-
ism.” Yet, if the Press is to be believed,
the performance fell lamentably short in
the epileptic quality so finely displayed
by many of the coloured Jazz-band
players now in London. None of the
audience had to be removed; The Morn-
ing Post only speaks of the “becoming
picturesqueness of design " of the Rhap-
sody; while The Times' critic did not
care much for it because it took too
long to get to business, and adds that
he was not very sure what its business
exactly was. This, in view of the ex-
tremely explicit statement of the com-
poser's aim given in the programme,
seems to us most unjust.
Here is a gifted composer with high
and serious aims—for what could be
more instructive or spiritual than a
musical rendering of “the degenerative
frenzy of a Voodoo orgy"?—and the
musical critics either evade the issue
by talking vaguely of picturesqueness
or deny that he means business. Verily
the lot of the composer is hard. Quite
symphonist who had composed a re-
markable orchestral Fantasy dealing
with the psychology of members of the
N.U.R. engaged in the railway trans-
port of fish and milk. I have not heard
the music, because unfortunately it has
not yet been performed, but I have
read the programme, and nothing more
stimulating can be imagined than the
final section, in which a terrific can-
nonade of milk-cans is combined with
a marvellous explosion of objurgation
from the fish-porters on strike. Yet
if it were to be performed The Morning
Post would probably dismiss it with
a few polysyllabic platitudes and The
Times affect ignorance of what it was
all about !
In view of the misconceptions and
misinterpretations to which serious
composers are subject, we are not sur-
prised to hear that a society has been
formed for the purpose of giving “silent
auditions” of modern masterpieces. No
orchestra nor any instrument will be
employed, but each member of the
audience will be provided with a full
score. The first hour will be devoted
to the study of the music; the audience
will then write down their impressions
for half-an-hour; subsequently the com-
poser will expound his aims from the
platform ; and the price of admission
will be returned to the student whose
impressions accord most closely with
the composer’s “programme.” In this
way the cost of concert-giving will be
considerably reduced, and it is also
hoped that the consumption of sedative
tablets, which has reached formidable
dimensions amongst frequenters of
symphonic concerts, will be rendered
unnecessary.
Our only criticism of this admirable
scheme is this—that the number of
amateurs who can read a modern full-
score at sight is still somewhat limited.
The view that “heard melodies are
sweet, but those unheard are sweeter"
might be quoted in support of “silent
auditions" were it not for the unfortun-
ate fact that KEATs, who expressed it,
is now completely out of fashion with
our emancipated Georgians.
But the
broad fact remains that the forces of
reaction are by no means crushed.
The Handel Festival has been revived
at the Crystal Palace; and Handel-
worship is anathema to the Modernist,
as redolent of roast-beef, middle-class
respectability and religious orthodoxy.

pared his oratorios to mothers'-meet-

AT THE PLAY.
“DADDALUMs.”
THIS is a play about a Northampton
shoe-manufacturer of Scottish nation-
ality. There is, of course, nothing quite
like leather, and I can well believe
that the lucrative properties of the boot
trade (notwithstanding its alleged as-
sociation with atheistic principles) must
at one time or other have attracted
this prehensile race; yet I doubt if
Northampton, home of the cobbling
industry, ever encouraged a Scot to
penetrate its preserves. Mr. Louis ANS-
PACHER, who wrote the play, may have
some inside knowledge denied to me,
though his name does not vividly indi-
cate a Scots origin; but
it is certain, if his Wallace
Craigie really came from
over the border, that he
was no true Scot, for
his dialect showed ob-
vious traces of Sassenach
pollution.
I have a mind that
moves slowly and I hate
to be hustled at the open-
ing of a play. I hate an
author to plunge me into
a whirl of movement and
a medley of characters as
if he assumed that I was
intimate with circum-
stances known only to
himself and his cast. I
want to be told, very
quietly, where I am, and
if he does not tell me I
become peevish. But,
even if I hadn't been put
off at the start, I don't
think my sympathies
would ever have been
very deeply engaged. I
soon saw that, whatever happened to
anybody, I should easily bear up. Mr.
Louis CALVERT did all that was humanly
possible to correct my indifference, but
his Daddalums (as you might gather
from such a name) was not one of those
heroic figures whose struggles against
the perversity of fate are apt to melt even
the cold hearts of the gods (Olympian).
This old cobbler, suddenly grown rich,
whose one ambition was to make his
son “Tammas” a gentleman (as he un-
derstood the term), at any cost to the
boy's soul, was asking for trouble from
the beginning. And when he got it I
was far less sorry for the old fool than
I was pleased at the chances which this
turn of fortune gave to the versatility
of Mr. CALVERT.
But the interest of the play lies not
so much in the plot—worked out me-

conclusion—as in the character of this
lovable oldboot-maker, whose single aim
in life was to give his son the best that
money could buy. His heart, I think,
began by being fairly large, but got con-
tracted through specialising in this pas-
sion. Snobbery is alien to his nature, but
he becomes a snob for Tammas's sake.
Stubborn and domineering with others,
he is as putty in the boy's hands. He
has no use for his other child—a girl.
She, like himself, must be sacrificed if
it suits the young gentleman—as it did.
I won't say that any very nice psy-
chological subtlety was needed for the
portrayal of a character whose ruling
motive was so clearly advertised, but it
had its lights and shadows, responsive

to changing conditions, and Mr. CAL-
vERT was quick to seize them all.
The boy's part was too unsympa-
thetic to be played easily. But he had
one saving virtue; he never practised
his snobbery on the old man who
encouraged it. He still called him
“Daddalums,” and that, I take it, was
what the papers would call an “acid
test” of his piety. As his fortunes de-
clined Mr. LISTER rose to the occasion.
The tighter the corner the better he
coped with it.
Mr. HENDRIE's Fergus McLarnie,
whose people must have migrated to
Northampton from the neighbourhood
of Thrums, was an admirable crony;
but he insisted too much and too de-
liberately on a Scottish accent that
made for obscurity. In a broader vein

MR. ERNEST HENDRIE.
(like myself) found no difficulty in ap-
preciating. Miss EDYTH OLIVE, as the
hero's neglected daughter, acted with
a very nice self-repression, which was
all that could be expected of her rather
colourless part.
The first-night audience was very
warm in its appreciation. Yet I must
doubt whether a play that is chiefly
concerned with the highly-developed
paternity of a boot-manufacturer will
make a very poignant appeal to the
sentiment of the public. -
For one thing they may find the love-
interest too sketchy. Of the boy's two
fiancées one was impossible, and the
other (Rose) just a perfunctory phantom
that flitted vaguely from time to time
across the stage. She
must have known it was
a play of father and son,
where girls didn't really
count. Poor Rose, so un-
assertive! How modestly
she kept herself in the
background in that last
scene where Tammas,
having “dreed his weird”
(as they would say in
Northampton) and re-
deemed his past, comes
back from Canada, flings
himself into his father's
arms, remains there lis-
tening to a sustained ex-
position of parental loy-
alty, and only after a
considerable interval re-
marks the presence of his
future wife. She took it
very well, but if I know
anything of the British
public it won't be so
easily pleased. O. S.

The Secret Corps (MURRAY) is the title of a book on
espionage, before and especially during the War, every page
of which I have read with the greatest possible entertain-
ment—the greatest possible, that is, for anyone at home.
To get the real maximum out of Captain FERDINAND
TUchy's astonishing anecdotes one would, I suppose, need
to be under a table in Berlin while they were being perused
| by the ex-chiefs of Intelligence on the other side. It is a
book so stuffed with good stories and revealed (or partly
revealed) mysteries that I should require pages of quotation
to do it anything like justice. It can certainly be claimed
for Captain Tuohy that he writes of what he himself knows
at first hand, and that his knowledge, like that of another
expert, is both extensive and peculiar, gleaned as it was
from personal service in Russia, Poland, Austria, Belgium,
France, England, Italy, Salonica, Palestine, Mesopotamia
and several neutral States. Still, absorbing as his book is,
it suffers perhaps from being what its publishers call “the
first authentic and detailed record.” One feels now and
then that posterity (which gets all the good things) may
score again in the revelation of yet more amazing details
for which the hour is not yet. Meanwhile, here to go on
with is a fund of thrilling information that will not only

it becomes too widely known) ensure your popularity as
One after Another (HUTCHINsoN), by Mr. STACY AUMONIER,
is a tale of social progress: of the steps—I imagine this is
where the name justifies itself—by which the son and
daughter of a Camden Town publican rise to higher or at
least more brilliant things. You might suppose this plan
to promise comedy, but the fact is otherwise. Really it is
an angry book, and though there is laughter in places it is
mostly angry laughter, with a sting in it. . Somehow,
whether speaking in his own person or through the voice
of his hero, Mr. AUMONIER gives me here (perhaps unjustly)
the impression of having a grievance against life. Yet it
cannot be said that Tom and Laura Purbeck found their
climb from Camden Town unduly arduous, since in a com-
paratively short time one has made a position and pots of
money as a fashionable house-decorator, and the other is a
famous concert star and the wife of a marquis. I think my
impression of unamiability must be derived from the fact
that the entire cast contains not one really sympathetic
character. Old Purbeck, who ruled his bar like an autocrat
and believed in honest alcohol (and fortunately for himself
died some years ago), comes nearest to it. Laura, of whom
the author gives us spasmodic glimpses, is vividly interest-
ing, but repellent. Tom, the protagonist, I found frankly
dull. Perhaps I have dwelt overmuch on defects. Cer-
tainly the story held my attention throughout, even after
my disappointment at finding nobody to like in it.

MAURICE BARING of course has no empty scruples of this
kind, and R.F.C. H.Q. 1914—1918 (BELL AND SoNs), though
it has plenty of statistics in it and technical details as well,
is in the main a delightfül jumble of stunts and talks and
quotations from Mr. MAURICE BARING and other people,
culinary details, troubles about chilblains and wasp-bites,
and here and there an excellently written memoir of some
friend who fell fighting. The main historical fact is, of
course, that our airmen from small beginnings reached a
complete ascendancy at the end of 1916, and then suffered
a set-back, reaching their own again when the mastery of
the Fokker was overcome. The author himself was liaison
officer and interpreter at H.Q., and stuck to General
TRENCHARD throughout, although he was urgently re-
quested to go to Russia. Scores of eminent people make
brief appearances in his book, and the following is a fair
sample of his method:—“January 3rd, 1917.-An Army
Commanders' Conference took place at Rollencourt. My

it is unlikely that there will be keen competition among
public schools to claim the original of St. Lucian's; and I
do not think that tender-hearted mothers need fear that
their own children will be beset by the temptations which
Brant had to encounter, for in his hectic career he was un-
fortunate enough to have card-sharpers, whisky-drinkers
and other unusual types of boyhood among his fellow-pupils,
and with such company it is not to be wondered at that
he was more often in than out of trouble. But, since he
helped to solve the mystery which was perplexing St.
Lucian's, it would seem that whatever happened to his
soul he contrived to keep his head. Boys with a taste for
amateur detective work might derive enjoyment from this
tale, and to them I recommend it.
Stephen Manaton, heir to great possessions, found that
his wealth and worldly position were slipping away from

Africans are, it seems, that they finished “further East"
when the cease-fire sounded (I wonder if this will go unchal-

author of course being solely responsible for letting us know
this last. Their terrible fights, not only at Delville Wood,
but even more at Marrière Wood and Messines, are beyond
question amongst the greatest feats of arms of the War, and
on the last two occasions their stand in the face of odds went
far to save the Allied cause in the black months of 1918.
Since, as the author joyously notes, Dutch and English ele-
ments in the South African forces lived and died on the field
like brothers, we may all agree with him, politics or no poli-
tics, that there has been something fundamentally right for
once about the Empire's treatment of their country. This
alone would give the book importance and interest outside
the Southern dominions to which it is first addressed. In
Capetown and Pretoria it will be the history of the War.

Tempest, the tomboy, the extremely unworthy recipient of
the good conduct prize at Miss Merridew's academy, has her

folk: an editor and assistant editor for whom I blush ; an
emporium owner who is kinder and wealthier and stupider
than he is diverting; an assistant schoolmistress, a surgeon,
a Futurist painter, a bishop. None of these worthy people
commands my respect or laughter. The high spirits seem
not entirely genuine. A casual lapse into Brummagem,
I take it.

MR. Asquith's recent success in
spotting the winner of the Derby is
believed to have inspired Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE with an idea of combining his
present policy of always going one, if
not two or three, better than the Old
Man with a public demonstration of the
extent to which the crude Puritanism
of his youth has been mellowed by
sympathies more in keeping with his
later political alliances. He is credited
with the intention of putting to appro-
priate use his peculiar gifts of non-
committal prophecy and persuasive
casuistry, and at the same time making
sure of a profitable holiday in the open
air by “doing" the Sussex Fortnight,
beginning with the Goodwood meeting,
in the capacity of Downy Dave, a race-
course tipster.

0N THE EATING OF ASPARACUS.
THERE were twenty-three ways of
eating asparagus known to the ancients.
Of these the best known method was
to suspend it on pulleys about three
feet from the ground and “approach
the green " on one's back along the
floor; but it was discontinued about
the middle of the fourth century, and
no new method worthy of serious con-
sideration was subsequently evolved, till
the August or September of 1875, when
a Mr. Gunter-Brown wrote a letter to
the A.A.I. (The Asparaſſus Absorbers'
Review and Gross Feeders' Gazette),
saying that he had patented a scheme
more cleanly and less unsightly than
the practice of tilting the head back-
ward at an angle of forty-five degrees
and lowering the asparagus into the
expectant face, which is shown by stat-
istics to have been the mode usually
adopted at that time. -
necessary to the method he advocated,
consisted of a silver or plated tube, into
which cach branch of asparagus, except
the last inch, was placed, and so drawn
into the mouth by suction, the eater
grasping the last uneatable inch, to-
gether with the butt end of the tube,
in the palm of his hand. Asparagus
branches being of variable girth, a rub-
ber washer inserted in the end of the
tube furthest from the eater's mouth
helped to cause a vacuum.
The inventor claimed that the edible
portion of the delicacy became detached
if the intake of the eater was strong
enough, but he overlooked the fact that
the necessary force caused the asparagus
to pass through the epiglottis into the
ocsophagus before the eater had time to
enjoy the taste (as was proved by ex-
periment) and so all sense of pleasure
was lost.
More prospective marriages have been
marred through the abuse of asparagus
at table than through mixed batling at
Tunbridge Wells. For instance, though
the matter was hushed up at the time,
it is an open secret among their friends
that Miss Gladys Devereux broke off
her engagement to young Percy Gore-
Mont on account of his gaucherte when
assimilating this weed at a dinner party.
It seems that he simply threw him-
self at the stuff, and that one of the
servants had to comb the melted butter
out of his hair before he could appear
in the drawing-room.
The case of the Timminses, too, pre-
sents very sad features, though the
marriage was not in this case abandoned,
the high contracting parties not having
once encountered a dish of asparagus
simultaneously during the engagement.
Yet it is more than rumoured that when,
at the end of the close season, asparagus
may be hunted, there is considerable
friction in the Timminses' household,
because Mrs. Timmins plays with a
straight fork, while Timmins affects the
crouching style.
Happily, however, a light at last ap-
pears to be shining through the dark-
ness. Under the auspices of the Vege-
table Growers' Association (Luxury
Trades section) an asparagus eating con-
test has been arranged to take place in
the Floral Hall early in July. As the
entrants to date include a contortionist
and at least three well-known war-
profiteers it is confidently expected that
some startling methods will be exhi-
bited which may revolutionise aspara-
gus eating in this country.

ſº
I sure HoPE YOU ’RE FEELING FULL OF PEP
Excurse ME, VICAR, BUT
I'M PRACTISING A FEw PHRASEs so THAT IN CASE 1 MEET ANY OF THIS AMERICAN INVASION I CAN MAKE THEM FEEL AT HOME.”
A NOTE ON CHESTERFIELDS.
IN the Soviet Republic of Russia, I
am told, no one can lay claim to the
|
title of worker unless his hands are
hardened and roughened by toil, and
LENIN and TROTSKY have to take their
turns at the rack, like the commonest
| executioner.
In England we are not
nearly so particular about the manual
test, and, besides feeling quite kindly dis-
posed towards professional footballers,
tea-tasters and the men who stand on
Cornish cliffs and shout when they see
the pilchard shoals come in, we still
give a certain amount of credit to mere
brain-work as well.
There is, however, a poisonous idea
prevalent,especially amongst the women
of this country, that a fellow is not
working with his brain unless he is
walking rapidly up and down the room
with wrinkles on his forehead, or sit-
ting on a hard chair at a table with a
file of papers in front of him. But
there is no rule of this sort about the
birth of great and beautiful ideas in the
vidual taste and habit. I know a man,
a poet, who thinks best on the Under-
ground Railway, and that is the reason
why he said the other day, “Give me
to gaze once more on the blue hills,”
to the girl in the booking-office, when
what he really wanted was a ticket (of
a light heliotrope colour) to St. James's
Park. Lord BYRON, on the other hand,
composed a sorrowful ditty on the deca-
dence of the Isles of Greece whilst
shaving; but the invention of the safety-
razor and the energetic action of M.
WENIZELos will most likely render it
unnecessary for anyone to repeat such
a performance. As for the people who
have a sudden bright idea whilst they
are dressing for dinner, they may be
dismissed at once, for they nearly always
go to bed by mistake and, when they
wake up again extremely hungry, they
have forgotten what it was.
Most experts are really agreed that a
recumbent or semi-recumbent position
is the best for creative thought, and
another friend of mine, also a maker of
verses, has patented the very ingenious
the mantelshelf, so that, when he sits
back in his armchair, he can manage his
Pegasus without having his feet con-
tinually slipping off the marble surface
into the fender.
Much may be said too for a seat in
a first-class railway carriage, when you
have the compartment all to yourself
and the train is going at sixty miles an
hour or more. But England is hardly
spacious enough for a really sustained
inspiration; and the result of being
turned out suddenly at Thurso, N.B., or
Penzance is that some opening flower
of the human intellect fails to achieve
its perfect bloom, and as likely as not
your golf clubs are left in the rack.
There is also, of course, an influential
school which believes strongly in the
early morning tea hour, and people
who ought to know tell me that Mr.
WINston CHURCHILL plans new uni-
forms for the Guards as well as the
campaign in Mesopotamia with pink
pyjamas on, and that the PRIME MIN-
1stER can never be persuaded to get
up for breakfast until he has hit on a

human brain. It is all a matter of indi-

are subsequently translated by his posse
of interpreters into Russian, Italian,
Bohemian and Erse.
For my part, however, I swear by a
Chesterfield sofa, a large one, on which
you can lie at full length, as I am lying
now ; the most comfortable thing there
is on earth, I think, except perhaps a
truss of hay, when one has been riding
for about six consecutive hours in an
army saddle. But there are disadvan-
tages even about a Chesterfield sofa.
It is, to begin with, in the drawing-
room; and in the drawing-room one is
not so entirely immune from the trivial
incidents of everyday life as I like to be
when I am having brain-waves. Doors
are opened and this creates a draught,
and it is not the slightest use attempt-
ing a real work of imagination when
people will come in and ask if I am
lying on The Literary Supplement of
The Times (as if it were likely), or the
anti-aircraft gun that the children were
playing with after lunch. For this
reason I have had to invent an even
| better thing than the ordinary Chester-
field sofa, and since it will be, when
made, the noblest piece of scientific up-
holstery in the world I will ask the
printer to write the next sentence in
italics, please:
It is a Chesterfield sofa enclosed on
all four sides. Thank you.
The marvels of this receptacle for
human thought will dawn upon the
reader by slow degrees. Try to imag-
ine yourself ensconced there, having
climbed up by the short flight of steps
which will be attached to it, enisled and
remote amidst the surging traffic that
sweeps through a drawing-room. In-
stead of making a rapid bolt to escape
from callers and probably meeting them
full tilt in the hall, you simply stay on,
thinking. You have nothing to fear
from them, unless they are so inquisi-
tive and ill-mannered as to come and
peep over the edge. With plenty of

DEDICATIONS.
MR. CoMPTON MACKENZIE has found
it necessary to state publicly in a dedi-
cation that his books have not been
written by his sister.
The following extracts are taken from
possible future dedications by various
authors:—
Mr. H. G. WELLs to the Bishop of
LoNDON.
As I have seen it stated in various
journals that you are the author of my
book, The Soul of a Bishop, I hereby
take the opportunity of informing your
Lordship most definitely and emphati-
cally that you are not. That book
and also The Passionate Friends were
written without any assistance from
the episcopal bench. To avoid future
misunderstanding I may say that all
my books are written by myself. If at
any time it is suggested that any pub-
lication of your Lordship has been
written by me, I shall be glad if you
will immediately issue a contradiction.
Mr. BERNARD SHA IV to the Editor of
“The Morning Post.”
You have not written my books. You
have not written my plays. Any state-
ment to the contrary is an infamous
falsehood. No one else, dead or alive,
could ever have written anything which
I have written. When I have become an
imbecile, which is not likely to happen
yet, as I am a vegetarian and do not read
your rag, it will be time enough for other
people to lay claim to my work. Nor
have I ever assisted you in conducting
that which you call a paper, nor have
I ever written an editorial for its col-
umns. Please let this matter have your
futile attention.
Miss DAISY ASHFoRD to Lord
HAL DANE.
If I did not believe your Lordship to
be really innosent I should be very
vexed with you. But let me explain.
I have heard it said in reliable quarters
that you are the auther of The Young
Visiters. Oh, my Lord ' my Lord! I
thought everybody knew by now that
no one helped me even to spell a word.
I have read your Lordship's books with
pleasure and of course realise their
promise. But it is all very diferent
stuff from The Young Visiters. Please
in the future disclaim all credit for
giving me my idears, and in return I
can assure you that your skemes for
the better education of the people shall
have my enthoosiastic suport.
Mr. A RNoLD BENNETT to The Man
in the Street.
The last thing that I wish is that you
have laboured to explain you to your-
self. That my explanation has pleased
you is shown by the fact that you buy
my books. But you have commenced
to give yourself airs, my man, and it is
time you were put in your place. My
books are so much to your taste that
you have been led to believe yourself
the author. Now please understand
my books are written for you and not
by you. You merely exist—thanks to
me—and pay. I have been told that I
once wrote a book called The Old Wives'
Tale. If so, that was in earlier days,
and you have long since forgiven me.
And do you not owe me something for
The Pretty Lady? Have I not shown
you that your love is both sacred and
profane? As I have enough to contend
with from those who care for literature
I hope any further word from me on
this subject will be unnecessary.
Mrs. FLORENCE BARCLAY to Lord
FISHER.
The phenomenal success of our re-
cent volumes has, I understand, led a
certain section of our public to believe
that you are the author of several of
my books. In particular it has been
stated that The Rosary was written by
your Lordship. As you know, I have
a great respect for the aristocracy, and
I do not suggest that you have de-
liberately put yourself forward as the
author of my books. You will, how-
ever, understand me when I say that
only your Lordship could express all
that I feel about the matter. The
mixing up of our identities is probably
explained by the fact that we are both
stylists and seekers for the not juste.
Will you please assist me in making it
clear that we work independently 2 As
I am staying in a country parsonage
and it is our custom to read one
another's letters over the breakfast-
table, I shall be glad if any reply you
may wish to make should be sent to
the Editor of The Times.
Sir AIRTHUR CoMAN Doy LL to Sir
OLIVER LODGE.
Our common concern with the life
beyond has become so well known that
our interests in this present life are in
danger of becoming involved. In a
volume of Sherlock Holmes stories re-
cently purchased abroad I find you
described as the author, and another
book assures me that I have written
extensively on the Atomic Theory.
You will, I am sure, see the harm which
I am likely to suffer through such mis-
takes. Nor does the confusion end
here. I find that my novel, The Hound
of the Baskervilles, is now stated to be
by Sir CoNAN LoDGE, and another book
of mine, The Lost World, to be by Sir
self described as “The Principal of
Birmingham University,” and yourself
as the well-known detective of Baker
Street. May I solicit your aid in help.

fusion of our respective genii? My
best wishes to you and the good work.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DOG'S LIFE.
THE life of a public man is a dog's
life. I don't know why a dog's life
should be the type and summit of un-
pleasantness in lives; for myself I
should have thought it was rather a
good life; no clothes to buy and no
shortage of smells; but there it is. The
reason is perhaps that a dog spends
most of his day just finding a really
good smell and being diverted from it
by something else, a loud whistle in
front or a motor-bicycle or another
smell. He rushes off then after the
has not yet been demobilised, and a
lady whose first-born son would like to
be President of the Board of Trade as
soon as it can be arranged. Meanwhile
eople begin to drift into the room.
The Private Secretary drifts in with a
despatch-case, full of new smells and
some old ones; and the valet drifts in
to say that the bath is still prepared,
and a haircutter and a man from the
shirt-makers, and the Secretary of the
Fish-Friers, who has looked in for a
quiet talk about the situation.
When they are all ready for their
quiet talks the public man decides that
tary's Secretary rings up and says that
the PRIME MINISTER can see the public
man for ten seconds at one minute
past eleven. It is now clear that the
Bottle-Washers and the Fish-Friers and
the PRIME MINISTER are going to clash
pretty badly, and a scene of intense
confusion takes place. The public man
runs about the room in his shirt-sleeves
smelling distractedly at the papers on
the floor and on the bed and everywhere
else. Some of the papers he throws at
the Private Secretary and tells him to
write a memorandum about them, and
go and see the War Office about them
whistler or the motor-bicycle
or the new smell, missing all
kinds of good smells on the
way and never getting the
cream of the old one. And
that is like the day of the
public man.
He sits up in bed in the
morning, having his breakfast
and thinking over the smells
he is going to have during the
day. There is an enormous
choice. The whole of the bed
is covered with papers; there
are tables on either side of the
bed covered with papers, letters
and memoranda, and agenda
and minutes and constituents'
grievances, and charitable ap-
peals and ordinary begs. When
he moves his foot there is a
great crackling, and the surface
papers float off into the air and
are waſted about the room.
Each paper represents a differ-
ent smell. He is going to make
aspeech to the Bottle-Washers'
Union at 11 A.M. and he is read-
ing the notes of his speech; but
before that he has got to in-
troduce a deputation of Fish-
Friers to the Hoxie SECRETARY
at ten and he is trying to find
out what the Fish-Friers are

and have six copies made of

ever, he just throws on the
floor or hides away in a dress.
ing-gown where the Private
Secretary won't find them;
this is the only way of making
sure of a permanent supply of
good crises. A crisis about a
lost document is far and away
the most fruitful kind of crisis.
Meanwhile the valet pursues
the public man about the room
with spats and tries to attach
them to his person. If he can
attach both spats before the
Fish-Friers' man really gets
hold of him he has won the
game. The Fish-Friers' man
keeps clearing his throat and
beginning, “The position is
this "; and the Private
Secretary keeps saying in a
cold dispassionate voice, “Are
you going to the Lord Mayor's
lunch 2" or “How much will
you give to the Dyspeptic
Postmen's Association 2" or
“What about this letter from
Bunt, 2 ''
The public man takes no
notice of any one of them, but
says rapidly over and over
again, “Where are my spec- |
after. But the telephone-bell
keeps on ringing and the papers keep
on floating away, and the papers about
the Fish-Friers keep mixing themselves
up with the papers about the Bottle-
Washers, and the valet keeps coming
in to say that the bath is prepared or
the hosier has come, so that it is all
very difficult.
All his family ring him up, and all
the people who were at the meeting
last night and were not quite satisfied
with the terms of the Resolution, and
all the people who are interested in
Fish-Frying and Bottle-Washing, and
all the people who want him to make
a speech at Cardiff next year, and
several newspapers who would like to
interview him about the Sewers and
it is time he got up ; he leaps out of
bed and rushes out of the room and
shaves and baths and does his exercises
very very quickly. Then he rushes
back and has a talk with the HoME
SECRETARY on the telephone while he is
drying his ears. When his ears are
nice and dry he rings off and ties his
tie, meanwhile dictating a nasty letter
to The Times about the Scavengers
(Minimum Wage) (Scotland) No. 2 Bill.
In the middle of this letter two new
crises arise—(1)The HoMESECRETARY's
Private Secretary's Secretary rings up
and says that the Fish-Friers' depu-
tation is postponed till 11 A.M. because
of a Cabinet Meeting about the new
war. (2) The Assistant-Secretary to
tacles?" or “What have you
done with the brown socks 2 " He is
playing for time. If he can put them
off for a little more, some new crisis may
occur and he will be able to say that he
is too busy to deal with them now.
The Private Secretary knows this and
continues to say, “Are you going to the
Lord Mayor's lunch 2". The Fish-
Friers' man doesn't know it, and crawls
about excitedly on the floor looking for
the spectacles under the bed. When
he is well under the bed the public man
tells the Private Secretary to ring up
the Bottle-Washers and the Fish-Friers
and the PRIME MINISTER and arrange
things somehow, and rushes out of the
room. He is hotly pursued by the valet
and the hosier and the hairdresser, but

luck he will now get clear away. In
the hall, however, the cook meets him
in order to give notice, and by the time
he has dealt with that crisis the Private
Secretary has had three wrong numbers
and given it up, and the Fish-Friers'
man has bumped his head and given it
up. They give chase together and catch
the public man just as he is escaping
from the front-door. The Private Sec-
retary starts again about the Lord
Mayor's lunch, and the Fish-Friers'
man starts again about the position.
The public man knows now that he
is done, so he drives them into the taxi
and says he will talk to them on the
way to the PRIME MINISTER. The taxi
dashes off, leaving the hosier and the
hairdresser and the valet wringing their
hands in the hall.
The only thing the public man can
do now is to invent a new crisis for the
Private Secretary, who is still saying
in a cold dispassionate voice, “Are you
going to the Lord Mayor's lunch 2"
So he thinks of one of the letters he
has hidden in his dressing-gown and
tells the Private Secretary that he must
have that letter for the Bottle-Washers'
place where there is no Underground
and no 'bus, and pushes the Private
Secretary out. He has disposed of the
Private Secretary for the day.
But the Fish-Friers' man's throat is
practically clear by now and he gets to
work at once. The public man pays no
attention but prepares in his mind his
opening sentences to the PRIME MINIS-
TER. In the Park he sees two other
public men walking and he takes them
into the cab. Each of them has dis-
covered some entirely new smells and
starts talking about them at once very
fast. The public man promises to go
and try them all immediately. When
he gets to the PRIME MINISTER’s he
rings up and cancels the Fish-Friers
and the Bottle-Washers. When he has
done that the Assistant-Secretary to the
PRIME MINISTER’s Principal Private
Secretary's Secretary comes out and
says that the PRIME MINISTER has been
called away suddenly to Geneva.
The public man then goes off after the
new smells. A dog's life. A. P. II.

“THAT REMINDs ME–I NEveR PostED THAT LETTER."
POPULAR CRICKET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I enclose a cut-
from Le Radical, one of the leading
Mauritius papers, and on behalf of the
lovers of our national game in the
island venture to ask for information
regarding the last match recorded:—
“Londres, 14 mai, 4 hres P.M.–Mary-
le-bone a battu Nottingham par 5
wickets; Lancashire a battu Leich-
ester; Sussex a battu Warrick. En
second lieu un joueur du Sussex a abattu
H. Wilson par 187 wickets.”
We are much perturbed at the strange
developments that are evidently taking
place in the game at home. Was this
match, we want to know, a single-
wicket game between the Sussex player
and H. WILSON ? If so how did he
beat him by 187 wickets?
An ex-captain of the Cambridge eleven
living here is of the opinion that, in
order to make cricket more popular, the
numbers of the opposing sides are being
increased, and that this match must
have been between a team of, say, a
couple of hundred Sussex players and
one of a like number captained by
H. WILSON, and that only some dozen
when the match ended. If this is the
correct interpretation we should be
very grateful for the rules, plan of the
field, etc., as we are most anxious to
move with the times in this little out-
post of Empire.
I fear however that we shall have
some difficulty here in raising two
teams of more than a hundred-a-side.
We presume that, as a match of
eleven-a-side takes two or three days to
finish, about six or eight weeks are
allotted to this new game.
- Any help that you can give us, Sir,
will be much appreciated.
Yours faithfully, M. C. C.

THE NEW COURTIERSHIP.
(With profound acknowledgment to the
writer of the article on “Heroine Wor-
ship" in “The Times” of June 24th.)
WHILE thrones and dynasties have
rocked or fallen in the great world up-
heaval of the last six years, there re-
mains one form of monarchy which has
proved impervious to all the shocks of
circumstance—the monarchy of genius.
If proof be demanded of this assertion
we need only point to the wonderful
manifestations of loyalty evoked in the
last week by the advent of the Queen
of the Film World and her admirable
consort. The adoration of MARY Pick-
Ford has been compared with that of
nesday last has probably done even
more to heal the wounds inflicted on
our gallant Allies by the disastrous
policy of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE than the
heroic efforts of The Times to maintain
the Entente in its integrity.
The parallels and contrasts with MARY
QUEEN of Scots need not be further
laboured.
been laid on the rare felicity of a union
which links the name of Mary with
that of Douglas. The annals of British
chivalry contain no more romantic or
splendid entries than those associated
with Sir JAMEs Dougi,As, alternately
styled the “Good” and the “Black,”
hero of seventy battles and the victor
in fifty-seven, peerless as a raider,
But far too little stress has
AGRIPPINA, Queen Pickford the First
may “endure her felicity with fortitude.”
Conspicuous grandeur has its penalties
as well as its privileges, but the chivalric
instinct is still alive in our midst; and
all of us who are not perverted or de-
based by the malign “wizardry" of the
Prix E MINISTER will spring to the de-
fence of MARY “the Sweetheart of the
World,” and Douglas “tender and
true,” in their hours of peril. In that
high emprise the gentlemen of the world,
however humble, stand, as of old time,
side by side and shoulder to shoulder.
THE BATTLE OF THE MOTHERS.
WE were sitting in the smoking-
MARY QUEEN of Scots,
and not without some
show of reason, for the
appeal which her acting
makes is always to the
sense of chivalry which,
in however sentimental
a form, is characteristic
of our race.
But the noble adula-
tion which the latest of
our royal visitors in-
spires is deeper and
more universal than
that prompted by the
charm and the misfor-
tunes of her namesake.
MARY QUEEN OF Scots,
as the evidence of con-
temporary portraits
conclusivelyestablishes,
was not conspicuous
for her personal beauty.
In the “Queen busi-
ness” she was a failure,
and her prestige is
largely if not entirely
posthumous. Her char-

Ill? Not he. He
never was better in his
life. He had merely
been on a motor tour
with his mother.
“Do you mean to
say,” someone inquired
—an equally elderly
member—almost with
anger, certainly with a
kind of outraged sur-
prise, “that you have a
mother still living?”
“Of course I have,”
said the Man of God.
“My mother is not only
living but is in the pink
of condition.”
“And how old is
she?” the questioner
continued.
“She is ninety-one,”
acter has been impugned by historians;
even her most faithful champions have
not pronounced her impeccable.
Centuries were necessary to raise
MARY QUEEN of Scots to her some-
what insecure pinnacle of devotion ; by
the alchemy of a machine centuries have
been shortened to days and nights in
the meteoric career of Miss PICKForp.
Yet merit has joined fortune in high
cabal. Handicapped by a somewhat
uneuphonious patronymic, MARY PICK-
Ford has established her rule with-
out recourse to any of the disputable
methods adopted by her predecessor.
At home in all the “palaces” of both
hemispheres, she owes her triumphs to
the triple endowment of genius, loveli-
ness and gentleness. Moreover, in the
highest sense she is truly an ambassa-
dress of our race, for the kiss which she
so graciously bestowed on Mlle. SUz-
who crowned a glorious career by his
mission to Palestine with the embalmed
heart of BRUCE, and his death in action
against the Moors. His illustrious
namesake is now conducting a “raid "
on our shores of a purely educational
and humanitarian nature, and our
welcome, while it expresses the rare
and momentous influence of the film, is
no mere gratitude for pleasure afforded;
it is rather the recognition of a human
touch tending to make the whole Eng-
lish-speaking world kin.
The visit is not unattended by risks,
for the ardour of enthusiasm imposes a
corresponding strain on the endurance
of this august and inimitable pair. But
there can be no doubt as to the absolute
sincerity and spontaneity of these mar-
vellous demonstrations of loyal affec-
tion. We can only hope that, to borrow
the noble phrase of the Roman Senate
said the Archdeacon proudly.
Most of us looked at him with won-
der and respect—even a touch of awe.
“And still motoring !” I commented.
“She delights in motoring.”
“Well,” said the angry man, “you
needn't be so conceited about it. You
are not the only person with an aged
mother. I have a mother too.”
We switched round to this new
centre of surprise. It was more in-
credible that this man should have a
mother even than the Archdeacon. No
one had ever suspected him of anything
so extreme, for he had a long white
beard and hobbled with a stick.
“And how old may your mother
be?” the Archdeacon inquired.
“My mother is ninety-two.”
“And is she well and hearty?”
“My mother,” he replied, “is in rude
health—or, as you would say, full of

can still read the smallest print without
glasses.”
We murmured our approval.
“And more,” the Archdeacon went
on, “she can thread her own needle.”
We approved again.
“That's all very well,” said the other,
“but sight is not everything. Can your
“She can hear all that I say to her,”
replied the Archdeacon.
“Ah! but you probably raise your
voice, and she is accustomed to it.
Could she hear a stranger? Could she
hear me 2"
Remembering the tone of some of his
after-lunch conversations I suggested
that perhaps it would be well if on
occasions she could not. He glowered
down such frivolousness and proceeded
with his cross-examination. “Are you
trying to assure us that your mother is
not in the least bit deaf 2"
“Well,” the Archdeacon conceded,
“I could not go so far as to say that
her hearing is still perfect.”
The layman smiled his satisfaction.
“In other words,” he said, “she uses
a trumpet?”
The Archdeacon was silent.
“She uses a trumpet, Sir? Admit it.”
“Now and then,” said the Arch-
deacon, “my dear mother has recourse
to that aid.”
“I knew it !” exclaimed the other.
“My mother can hear every word. She
goes to the theatre too. Now your
mother would have to go to the cinema
“My mother,” said the Archdeacon,
“would not be interested in the cine-
ma” (he pronounced it ki, néma); “her
mind is of a more serious turn.”
“My mother is young enough to be
interested in anything,” said the ather.
“And there is not one of her thirty-
eight grandchildren of whose progress
she is not kept closely informed.”
He leaned back with a gesture of
triumph.
“How many grandchildren did you
say?” the Archdeacon inquired. “I
didn't quite catch.”
“Thirty-eight,” the otherman replied.
Across the cleric's ascetic features a
happy smile slowly and conqueringly
spread. “My mother,” he said, “ has
fifty-two grandchildren. And now,” he
turned to me, “which of us would you
say has won this entertaining contest ?”
“I should not like to decide,” I said.

mothers—no Solomon. My verdict is
that both of you are wonderfully lucky

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WE have had to wait four years for the concluding
volumes of The Life of Benjamin Disraeli (MURRAY), but,
as the engaged couple said of the tunnel, “it was worth it,”
for in the interval Mr. BUCKLE has been able to enrich
his work with a wealth of new material. This includes
DIsrAELI's correspondence with QUEEN VICTORIA during
his two Premierships, and the still more remarkable letters
that he wrote to the two favoured sisters, ANNE, Lady
CHESTERFIELD, and SELINA, Lady BRADFord, during the
'ast eight years of his life. To one or other of them he
wrote almost every day, and from the sixteen hundred letters
that have been preserved Mr. Buckle has selected with
happy discretion a multitude of passages which throw a
vivid light upon the political events of the time and upon
DISRAELI's own character. Whereas the first four volumes
of the biography might be likened to a good sound Burgundy,
thanks to these letters the last two sparkle and stimulate
like a vintage champagne. As we read them we seem to
reason but to discover the sun,” is the begetter of the third
group, “Egypt and the Egyptians,” the first letter of which
will not, I imagine, be reprinted and framed by the P. and O.
Brilliant word-pictures of things seen, thumbnail sketches
of odd characters, clever records of remembered speech,
intelligent comment from a well-defined point of view—
these you will have expected, and will get.
Lady DoRoTHY MILLs, who has already made some suc-
cess as a holder of the mirror up to a certain section of
ultra-smart society, continues this benevolent work in her
new novel, The Laughter of Fools (DUCRworth). It is a
clever tale, almost horridly well told, about the war-time
behaviour of the rottenest idle-rich element, in the disor-
ganised and hectic London of 1917-18. Perhaps the obser-
vation is superficial; but, just so far as it pretends to go,
Lady DoRothy's method does undoubtedly get home. Her
heroine, Louise, is a detestable little egoist, whose vanity
and entire lack of moral render her an easy victim to the
vampire crowd into which she drifts. The “sensation"
scenes, night club orgies, dope parties and the like will
be present at the scenes

says that “Disraeli,

letters to Lady BRAD-

student these volumes will be almost as fruitful a field as
BURRE; for myself, I have found them more fascinating
than any novel. *.
It seems a great pity that Mr. KIPLING's Letters of Travel
(MACMILLAN) contains nothing later than 1913. It would
have been particularly interesting to see how far the events
of the great tragedy might have modified or aggravated his
scorn against those who do not see eye to eye with him.
In the pre-war KIPLING, as we have him here, “Labour "
is always the enemy, “Democracy” the hypocritical cant
of cranks and slackers. What do they know of England
who only KIPLING know? Well, they know one side of it,
and a fine side. The first sheaf of letters—“From Tideway
to Tideway (1892)"—describes a tour through America and
Canada, with a rather too obvious bias against the habits
and institutions of the former, but with so eloquent a pre-
sentation of the dream and fact of imperial pioneering ser-
vice that it might draw even from a Little Englander,
“Almost thou persuadest me!” “Letters to the Family"
deals with the Canada of 1907, a very different entity from
the Canada of to-day after the later Imperial Conferences
and five years' trial of war, but none the less interesting to

shrewdly written tale.
To The Diary of a U-Boat Commander (HUTchINson)
“ETIENNE" adds an introduction and some explanatory
notes. In one of these notes we are told that the Diary
was left in a locker when the Commander handed over his
boat to the British. We are all at liberty to form any
opinion we like on the use made of this Diary and I am
not going to reveal mine. For, after all, it is the book
itself—however produced—that matters, and even those of
us who are getting a little shy of literature connected with
the War will find something original and intriguing in this
Diary. With what seems to me unnecessary frankness the
publisher refers to the Commander's “incredible exploits
and adventures on the high seas.” For my own part my
powers of belief in regard to the War are almost unlimited,
and the only thing that really staggers me here is the men-
tality of the diarist. From the record of his purely private
life, which is also exposed in these pages, I gather that
he was as unfortunate in love as in war; but he seems to
have loved with a whole-hearted passion that goes far to
redeem him. I must add a word of praise for Mr. FRANR

AN OPEN LETTER TO FRANCE.
Mr. Punch had kissed the lady's hand and she had smiled upon him very graciously, for they were old friends.
“I have brought you a letter from myself,” he said.
“Shall I read it while you wait?” said Madame la France.
“Please, no. I never read my contributors' compositions in their presence. It is embarrassing to both sides.
And I want you to take your time over this one, and consider carefully whether it is suitable for publication in your
Press. I have enclosed a stamped and addressed envelope, to be utilized in the event of your deciding to return
my communication with regrets. In any case I propose to publish it in my own paper, The London Charivari."
[Here begins the letter : —
“NEAREST AND DEAREST OF ALLIES,-You and I (I speak for my country, though I have not been asked
to do so) have gone through so much together that it would be an infinite pity if any misunderstanding were
suffered to cloud our friendship for want of a little candour on my part. No Entente can retain its cordiality
without mutual candour; and hitherto the reticence has been all on our side.
“Not when your splendid courage and your noble sacrifices gave us a theme; then we were always frankly
loud in our admiration; but when we reflected upon what I may venture to call your faults and failings. Whatever
we may have thought about them during all those terrible years, you will find in our public statements no note of
criticism and not a single word that did not breathe a true loyalty. You too were generous in your praise of us'
when we won battles; and at the end, with your own Foch for witness, you were quick to recognise what part
we played in those great Autumn days that brought the crowning victory. But it almost looks as if your memory
of our brotherhood in arms were beginning to fail; as if we, who were then hailed as your “glorious Ally,’ were
about to resume our old name—it has already been revived in some quarters—of ‘Perfide Albion.’
“Oh, I know that the best of France is loyal to us; that her true chivalry understands. But what of
your public that is all ear for the so-called Echo de Paris, with its constant incitement to jealousy and suspicion
of England 2 What of your second-rate Press and its pin-pricking policy, connived at, if not actually encouraged,
by your Government?
“Of course I recognise that you never really liked the idea of all those British soldiers making themselves
at home in your country, though they did it as nicely as it could be done, and made hosts of friends in the
process. I can believe that we should not have been too well pleased at having a like number of French troops

trenches or claimed heavy damages for any injury they might have done to our roads in the course of defending
the Metropolis from our common enemy. But we certainly should not have been depressed when we found that
they needn't stay any longer. Still I hope we should have registered on the tablets of our hearts a permanent
record indicating that we appreciated their friendliness in coming to our support.
“But I am told that the secret of the present attitude of our French critics is that they cannot forgive
us for having used the soil of France in order to defend our own. Is this quite fair or even decent? Let me
refresh their memory of the motive that brought us into this War. The true motive was not to be found
in the duty imposed upon us by Germany's breach of the Belgian Treaty, though that in itself furnished us
with an unanswerable reason. The true motive was our desire to help you. We had nothing in those days to
fear for ourselves. We knew that our Fleet was strong enough to protect our own shores. We had not yet
appreciated the submarine menace; we did not recognise what your loss of the Channel ports might mean for us.
We entered the War because we could not look on and see you overwhelmed.
- “You complain, again, that, in contrast to yourselves, we have got all we wanted out of the War. As a
fact we wanted nothing; but let that pass. You point to the destruction of the German Fleet as if it were a
private gain for us and us alone, and not the removal of a danger to the whole world. And what of the German
armies—now in process of reduction to a mere police force? Did you derive no advantage from the overthrow of a
system which was always a greater menace to you than the German Fleet ever was to us? And, though we did
not pretend to be a military nation, had we not some little share in that achievement?
“And what of your revamche 2 How do the German Colonies, which we have freed and now hold in trust—how
do these compare with your solid recovery of Alsace-Lorraine? No, you have not come badly out of Armageddon.
“Oh, you have suffered, that we know; you have suffered even more than we, who at least were spared
the ravaging of our lands. And never for a moment do we forget this. But you too must not forget that where
the soil of France suffered most there thickest lie our English dead, who fought for England's freedom, yes, but
for your freedom too. And it is we who stand by you still, pledged to be once more at your side if the same
peril ever come again; though America, for whom nothing was once too good, should fail you in your need.
“There, I have said what I wanted to say; what your best friends here have been thinking this many a
day. . For your best friends are not, as you might imagine, to be found in a certain section of our Press who
for their own political or private ends are prepared to encourage all your suspicions if so they may injure the
good name of our statesmen who meet you in council for the common cause. Your best friends are the men
who deplore those suspicions; who beg you, as I do here, to get them swept away as being unworthy of a great
nation and a great alliance. -
“For this end, Believe me, dear Madame, to be at your service as always,
- “puſhCIb.”
Here ends the letter.]
“And now, dear lady,” said Mr. Punch, “let me say that, if there is anything in this letter which seems—but
only on the surface—to be inconsistent with my profound devotion to your person, it is the first word of the
kind that I have put on paper since our friendship began. All through the War and the hardly less trying times
of Peace that have followed it I have not once swerved from my loyalty to you. Accept, I beg of you, the
renewed assurance of my affection the most sincere, and, for token, this latest of a series in which you will find
many proofs of the love I bear you—my

trenches or claimed heavy damages for any injury they might have done to our roads in the course of defending
the Metropolis from our common enemy: But we certainly should not have been depressed when we found that
they needn't stay any longer. Still I hope we should have registered on the tablets of our hearts a permanent
record indicating that we appreciated their friendliness in coming to our support.
“But I am told that the secret of the present de of our French critics is that they cannot forgive
us for having used the soil of France in order to defend our own. Is this quite fair or even decent ? Let me
refresh their memory of the motive that brought us into this War. The true motive was not to be found
in the duty imposed upon us by Germany's breach of the Belgian Treaty, though that in itself furnished us
with an unanswerable reason. The trug motive was our desire to help you. We had nothing in those days to
fear for ourselves. We knew that our Fleet was strong enough to protect our own shores. We had not yet
appreciated the submarine menace; we did not recognise what your loss of the Channel ports might mean for us.
We entered the War because we could not look on and see you overwhelmed.
“ You complain, again, that, in contrast to yourselves, we have got all we wanted out of the War. As a
fact we wanted nothing; but let that pass. You point to the destruction of the German Fleet as if it were a
private gain for us and us alone, and not the removal of a danger to the whole world. And what of the German
armies—now in process of reduction to a mere police force ? Did you derive no advantage from the overthrow of a
system which was always a greater menace to you than the German Fleet ever was to us? And, though we did
not pretend to be a military nation, had we not some little share in that achievement ?
And what of your revanche ? How do the German Colonies, which we have freed and now hold in trust—how
do these compare with your solid recovery of Alsace-Lorraine? No, you have not come badly out of Armageddon.
“Oh, you have suffered, that we know; you have suffered even more than we, who at least were spared
the ravaging of our lands. And never for a moment do we forget this. But you too must not forget that where
the soil of France suffered most there thickest lie our English dead, who fought for England's freedom, yes, but
for your freedom too. And it is we who stand by you still, pledged to be once more at your side if the same
peril ever come again; though America, for whom nothing was once too good, should fail you in your need.
There, I have said what I wanted to say; what your best friends here have been thinking this many a
day. For your best friends are not, as you might imagine, to be found in a certain section of our Press who
for their own political or private ends are prepared to encourage all your suspicions if so they may injure the
good name of our statesmen who meet you in council for the common cause. Your best friends are the men
who deplore those suspicions; who beg you, as I do here, to get them swept away as being unworthy of a great
nation and a great alliance.
For this end, Believe me, dear Madame, to be at your service as always,
Punch."
Here ends the letter.]
" And now, dear lady,” said Mr. Punch, “let me say that, if there is anything in this letter which seem's—but
only on the surface-to be inconsistent with my profound devotion to your person, it is the first word of the
kind that I have put on paper since our friendship began. All through the War and the hardly less trying times
of Peace that have followed it I have not once swerved from my loyalty to you. Accept, I beg of you, the
renewed assurance of my affection the most sincere, and, for token, this latest of a series in which you will find
many proofs of the love I bear you—my
One Hundred and fifty-Eighth Volume."

THINK not I hold your love, my Susan, lightly;
Think not that my so firm affection fails,
Or that I deem your face has grown unsightly
That drew me swooning to the altar-rails;
Fear not that those pure ardours, O my sweet, wane
Which still recall the sun's meridian rays,
lſ round the links I recommend that we twain
Should go our several ways.
It is a game, this golf—ah, what a pity!—
Where true love's course is seldom smoothly run;
Where constant deviations from the pretty
Sunder the tracks that rightly should be che;
You on the sea-beach, I amid the heather,
Traversing totally divergent scenes—
Only by mere chance should we come together
Save on the tees and greens.
Rapture, I grant, would follow each reunion
That marked our eighteen separate journeys' ends;
After the horrid gaps in our communion
Meetings like these would make a fair amends;
Dut there's a risk that we might both be minded
To interchange salutes in lovers' wise,
And such a spectacle ere now has blinded
Or, on the other hand, there might be quarrels
If you should underestimate your score;
If, with a woman's sketchier sense of morals,
You made it twelve in lieu of twenty-four;
Your legend might arouse derisive laughter
Or in a peevish moment I might let
Fall some expression which for ever after
Both of us would regret.
Besides, the language of profound displeasure
In which I tell my clubs that they're to blame
Might shatter your ideal (and you, my treasure,
Possibly say the like when off your game);
Defore each other, ever since our bridals,
We've said no word a saint might not repeat;
And we should loathe it if we caught our idols
Ending in putty feet.
What if the links without you will be lonely?
What if the parting cuts you like a knife?
We'll keep our mutual respect—the only
Sound basis of the perfect wedded life;
Though (as I mentioned) I shall sadly miss you,
I know the hazards, and I think it best
We should not stake our all upon the issue

THE LEGEND OF HI-YOU.
I
IN the days of Good King Carraway
(dead now, poor fellow, but he had a
pleasant time while he lasted) there
lived a certain swineherd commonly
called Hi-You. It was the duty of
Hi-You to bring up one hundred and
forty-one pigs for his master, and this
he did with as much enthusiasm as the
work permitted. But there were times
when his profession failed him. In
the blue days of summer Princes and
Princesses, [ords and Ladies,
Chamberlains and Enchanters
would ride past him and leave
him vaguely dissatisfied with
his company, so that he would
remove the straw from his
mouth and gaze after them,
wondering what it would be
like to have as little regard
for a swineherd as they. But
when they were out of sight he
would replace the straw in his
mouth and fall with great dili-
gence to the counting of his
herd and such other duties as
are required of the expert pig- :
tender, assuring himself that if
a man could not be lively with
one hundred and forty - one
companions he must indeed be
a poor-spirited sort of fellow.
Now there was one little black pig for
whom Hi-You had a special tenderness.
Just so, he often used to think, would
he have felt towards a brother if this
had been granted to him. It was not
the colour of the little pig nor the
curliness of his tail (endearing though
this was), nor even the melting expres-
sion in his eyes which warmed the
swineherd's heart, but the feeling that
intellectually this pig was as solitary
among the hundred and forty others as
2’
º
was the name which he had given to
it) shared their food, their sleeping
apartments, much indeed as did Hi-You,
but he lived, or so it seemed to the
other, an inner life of his own. In
short Frederick was a soulful pig.
There could be only one reason for
this: Frederick was a Prince in dis-
guise. Some enchanter—it was a com-
mon enough happening in those days—
annoyed by Frederick's father, or his
uncle, or even by Frederick himself,
had turned him into a small black pig
until such time as the feeling between
them had passed away. There was a
Prince Frederick of Milvania who had
disappeared suddenly; probably this
was he. His complexion was darker
now, his tail more curly, but the royal
bearing was unmistakable.
It was natural then that, having
little in common with his other hundred
and forty charges, Hi-You should find
himself drawn into ever closer com-
panionship with Frederick. They would
talk together in the intervals of acorn-
hunting, Frederick's share of the con-
intelligible at first, but as the days
went on seeming more and more
charged with an inner meaning to
Hi-You, until at last he could interpret
every variation of grunt with which his
small black friend responded. And in-
deed it was a pretty sight to see them
sitting together on the top of a hill, the
world at their feet, discussing at one
time the political situation of Milvania,
at another the latest ballad of the coun-
tryside, or even in their more hopeful
moments planning what they should
do when Frederick at last was re-
stored to public life. -
II.
Now it chanced that one
morning when Frederick and
Hi-You were arguing together
in a friendly manner over the
new uniforms of the Town
Guard (to the colours of which
Frederick took exception) King
Carraway himself passed that
way, and being in a good hu-
mour stood for a moment list-
ening to them.
- “Well, well,” he said at last,
“well, well, well.”
In great surprise Hi-You
.." looked up, and then, seeing that
it was the King, jumped to his
* - feet and bowed several times.
“Pardon, Your Majesty,” he stam-
mered, “I did not see Your Majesty. I
was—I was talking.”
“To a pig,” laughed the King.
“To His Royal Highness Prince
Frederick of Milvania,” said Hi-You
proudly. -
“I beg your pardon,” said the King;
“could I trouble you to say that
again?”
“His Royal Highness Prince Fred-
erick of Milvania.”
“Yes, that was what it sounded like

last time.”

“Frederick,” murmured Hi-You in
his friend's ear, “this is His Majesty
King Carraway. He lets me call him
Frederick,” he added to the King.
“You don't mean to tell me,” said
His Majesty, pointing to the pig, “that
this is Prince Frederick 2''
“It is indeed, Sire. Such distressing
incidents must often have occurred
within Your Majesty's recollection.”
“They have, yes. Dear me, dear
me.”
“Humph,” remarked Frederick,
feeling it was time he said some-
thing. -
“His Royal Highness says that
he is very proud to meet so distin-
guished a monarch as Your Ma-
Jesty.”
“Did he say that ?” asked the
King, surprised.
“Undoubtedly, Your Majesty.”
“Very good of him, I'm sure.”
“Humph,” said Frederick again.
“He adds,” explained Hi-You, “that
Your Majesty's great valour is only
excelled by the distinction of Your
Majesty's appearance.”
“Dear me,” said the King, “I thought
he was merely repeating himself. It
seems to me very clever of you to under-
stand so exactly what he is saying.”
“Humph,” said Frederick, feeling
that it was about acorn time again.
“His Royal Highness is kind enough
to say that we are very old friends.”
“Yes, of course, that must make a
difference. One soon picks it up, no
doubt. But we must not be inhos-
pitable to so distinguished a visitor,
Certainly he must stay with us at the
Palace. And you had better come along
too, my man, for it may well be that
without your aid some of His Royal
Highness's conversation would escape
us. Prince Frederick of Milvania—dear
me, dear me. This will be news for her
Royal Highness.”
So, leaving the rest of the herd to
look after itself, as it was quite capable
of doing, Frederick and Hi-You went
to the Palace.
Now Her Royal Highness Princess
Amaril was of an age to be married.
Many Princes had sought her hand, but
in vain, for she was as proud as she was
beautiful. Indeed, her beauty was so
great that those who looked upon it
were blinded, as if they had gazed upon
the sun at noonday—or so the Court
Poet said, and he would not be likely
to exaggerate. Wherefore Hi-You was
filled with a great apprehension as he
walked to the Palace, and Frederick, to
whom the matter had been explained,
was, it may be presumed, equally stirred
within, although outwardly impassive.
And, as they went, Hi-You murmured
to his companion that it was quite all
not eat them, the which assurance
Frederick, no doubt, was peculiarly glad
to receive.
“Ah,” said the King, as they were
shown into the Royal Library, “that's
right.” He turned to the Princess. “My
dear, prepare for a surprise.”
“Yes, Father,” said Amaril dutifully.
tically, throwing out a hand, “is a
Prince in disguise.”
“Which one, Father ?” said Amaril.
“The small black one, of course,
said the King crossly; “the other is
merely his attendant. Hi, you, what's
your name?”
The swineherd hastened to explain
that His Majesty, with His Majesty's
unfailing memory for names, had gra-
ciously mentioned it.
“You don't say anything,” said the
King to his daughter.
Princess Amaril sighed.
“He is very handsome, Father,” she
said, looking at Hi-You.
“Y-yes,” said the King, regarding
Frederick (who was combing himself
thoughtfully behind the left ear) with
considerable doubt, “there is perhaps
a certain elusive charm about him
which an untrained eye might miss,
but we must remember that appear-
ances in this case are only temporary.
The real beauty of Prince Frederick's
character does not lie upon the surface,
or anyhow—er—not at the moment.”
“No, Eather,” sighed Amaril, and
she looked at Hi-You again.
Now the swineherd, who with in-
stinctive good breeding had taken the
straw from his mouth on entering the
Palace, was a well-set-up young fellow,
such as might please even a Princess.
There was silence for a little while
in the Royal Library, until Frederick
realised that it was his turn to speak.
“Humph " said Frederick.
“There!" said the King in great
good humour. “Now, my dear, let me
tell you what that means. That means
that His Royal Highness is delighted
to meet so beautiful and distinguished
a Princess.” He turned to Hi-You.
“Isn't that right, my man?”
“Perfectly correct, Your Majesty.”
“You see, my dear,” said the King
complacently, “one soon picks it up.
“Humph '" said Frederick again.
“What did that one mean, Father?”
asked Amaril.
“That meant—er—that meant—well,
it's a little hard to put it colloquially,
but roughly it means"—he made a ges-
ture with his hand—“that we have—
er—been having very charming weather
lately.” He frowned vigorously at the
swineherd.
“Exactly, Your Majesty,” said
Hi-You. “Charming weather for
the time of year.”
“For the time of year, of course,”
said the King hastily. “One nat-
urally assumes that. Well, my dear,”
he went on to his daughter, “I’m
sure you will be glad to know
that Prince Frederick
has consented to stay with
us for a little. You will
give orders that suitable apartments
are to be prepared.”
“Yes, Father. What are suitable
apartments?”
The King pulled at his beard and
regarded Frederick doubtfully.
“Perhaps it would be better,” the
Princess went on, looking at Hi-You,
“if this gentleman—”
“Of course, mydear, of course. Natur-
ally His Royal Highness would wish to
retain his suite.”
“Humph ' " said Frederick, mean-
ing, I imagine, that things were look-
ing up.
III.
Of all the Princes who from time to
time had visited the Court none en-
deared himself so rapidly to the people
as did Frederick of Mulvania. His com-
plete lack of vanity, his thoughtfulness,
the intense reserve which so obviously
indicated a strong character, his power
of listening placidly to even the most
tedious of local dignitaries, all these
were virtues of which previous royal

on set occasions Prince Frederick could
make a very pretty speech. True, this
was read for him, owing to a slight
affection of the throat from which, as the
Chancellor pointed out, His Royal High-
ness was temporarily suffering, but it
would be couched in the most perfect
taste and seasoned at suitable functions
(such, for instance, as the opening of the
first Public Baths) with a pleasantly
restrained humour. Nor was there any
doubt that the words were indeed the
Prince's own, as dictated to Hi-You
and by him put on paper for the Chan-
cellor. For Hi-You himself never left
the Palace.
“My dear,” said the King to his
daughter one day, “have you ever
thought of marriage?”
“Often, Father,” said Amaril.
“I understand from the Chancellor
that the people are expecting an an-
nouncement on the subject shortly.”
“We haven't got anything to an-
nounce, have we ?”
“It's a pity that you were so hasty
with your other suitors,” said the King
thoughtfully. “There is hardly a Prince
left who is in any way eligible.”
“Except Prince Frederick,” said
Amaril gently.
The King looked at her suspiciously
and then looked away again, pulling at
his beard.
“Of course,” went on Amaril, “I
don't know what your loving subjects
would say about it.”
“My loving subjects,” said the King
grimly, “have been properly brought
up. They believe — they have my
authority for believing—that they are
suffering from a disability of the eye-
sight laid upon them by a wicked en-
chanter, under which they see Princes
--> - -
as—er—pigs. That, if you remember,
was this fellow Hi-You's suggestion.
And a very sensible one.”
“But do you want Frederick as a
son-in-law 2 ”
present shape he is perhaps not quite—
not quite—well, how shall I put it?”
“Not quite,” suggested Amaril.
“Exactly. At the same time I think
that there could be no harm in the an-
nouncement of a betrothal. The mar-
riage, of course, would not be announced
until ; :
“Until the enchanter had removed
his spell from the eyes of the people 2
“Quite so. You have no objection
to that, my dear?”
“I am His Majesty's subject,” said
Amaril dutifully.
“That's a good girl.” He patted the
top of her head and dismissed her.
So the betrothal of His Royal High-
ness Frederick of Milvania to the Prin-
cess Amaril was announced, to the great
joy of the people. And in the depths
of the Palace Hi-You the swineherd
was hard at work compounding a potion
which, he assured the King, would
restore Frederick to his own princely
form. And sometimes the
Princess Amaril would help &
him at his work.
IV.
A month went by, and then
Hi-You came to the King with
news. He had compounded
the magic potion. A few drops sprinkled
discriminately on Frederick would re-
store him to his earlier shape, and the
wedding could then be announced.
“Well, my man,” said His Majesty,
genially, “this is indeed pleasant hear-
ing. We will sprinkle Frederick to-
morrow. Really, I am very much in
your debt; remind me after the cere-
mony to speak to the Lord Treasurer
about the matter.”
“Say no more,” begged Hi-You.
“All I ask is to be allowed to depart
in peace. Let me have a few hours
alone with His Royal Highness in the
form in which I have known him so
long, and then, when he is himself again,
let me go. For it is not meet that I
should remain here as a perpetual re-
minder to His Royal Highness of what
he would fain forget.”
“Well, that's very handsome of you,
very handsome indeed. I see your point.
Yes, it is better that you should go.
\\But, before you go, there is just one
thing. The people are under the im-
pression that —er — an
enchanter has-er—well,
you remember what you
; yourself suggested.”
“I have thought of
that,” said Hi-You, who
seemed to have thought of everything.
“And I venture to propose that Your
Majesty should announce that a great
alchemist has been compounding a
potion to relieve their blindness. A few
the water of the Public Baths, and all
those bathing therein will be healed.”
“A striking notion,” said the King.
“Indeed it was just about to occur to
me. I will proclaim to-morrow a public
holiday, and give orders that it be cele-
brated in the baths. Then in the even-
ing, when they are all clean—I should
say ‘cured '-we will present their
Prince to them.” -
So it happened even as Hi-You had
said, and in the evening the Prince, a
model now of manly beauty, was pre-
sented to them, and they acclaimed him
with cheers. And all noticed how low-
ſº
ingly the Princess regarded him and
how he smiled upon her.
