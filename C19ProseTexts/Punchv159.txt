TIMON.
About a month ago we lost our dog.
I can't describe him, although I have
tried from time to time; but Elaine, my
wife, said I should not speak in that
fashion of a dumb animal. He stands
about two hands high, is of a reseda-
green shade, except when in anger, and
has no distinguishing marks except the
absence of a piece of the right ear,
which was carried off by a marauding
Irish terrier. IIe answers with a growl
to many names, including that of Timon.
He will also answer to a piece of raw
meat, andther dog or a postman.
I do not know if dogs can be said to
have a hobby; if so, Timon's hobby is
postmen. He studies them closely. In
fact I should not be surprised if he
comes to write a monograph on them
some day.
As soon as one of them has daringly
passed the entrance gates of Bellevue,
Timon trots forth like a reception
committee to meet him. He studies
the bunch of communications that the
visitor bears in his hand. If they are
all right-cheques from publishers,
editors and missing-heir merchants,
invitations to tea and tennis or dinner
and dominoes, requests for autographs
—Timon nods and allows the postman
to pass unscathed. On the other hand,
if the collection includes rejected manu-
scripts, income or other tax demand
notes, tracts or circulars, then I hear the
low growl with which Timon custom-
arily goes into action, and the next
moment the postman is making for the
neighbouring county and taking a four-
foot gate in his stride.
Consequently it is to be anticipated
that if the Olympic Games are ever
held in our neighbourhood the sprint
and the hurdles will be simply at the
mercy of our local post-office. They
take no credit for it. It is simply prac-
tice, they say.
But, to return to the main subject,
we have lost Timon. One month has
passed without his cheery presence at
Bellevue. Reckless postmen have made
themselves free of the front garden and
all colour has gone out of life.
We have done everything to win him
back. We have inserted numerous ad-
vertisements in the agony columns of
the newspapers: “If this should catch
the eye of Timon,” or “Come back,
Timon. All will be forgiven;" but ap-
parently we have yet to find his favourite
newspaper.
We began with the well-known can-
ine papers, trusting vainly that he
might happen to glance through them
some day when he was a bit bored or
hadn't an engagement. After that we
went through The Times, The Morning
Post (he's strongly anti-Bolshevik), The
Daily News (his views on vivisection
are notorious) and other dailies, and
then took to the weeklies.
We had strong hopes for a time that
The Meat Trade Review would find him.
Timon is fond of raw meat. But failure
again resulted. We have now reached
Syren and Shipping and The Iron-
mongers' Gazette and
::: ::: × --- :-
I must stop here to inform you of
the glad news. Elaine has just hurried
in to tell me that Timon has replied
and will be back to-morrow.
How did we catch his eye? Well,
of course we should have thought of it
before. It was The Post Office Gazette.

THE ROMANCE OF B00KMAKING.
A-VISIT TO MESSRs. PRYCE UNLtd.
(With acknowledgments in the right
quarter.)
A GIGANTIC commissionaire flings
wide the doors for us and, passing rev-
erently inside, we are confronted by the
magnificent equestrian statue of Mr.
Bookham Pryce, the founder of the firm.
This masterpiece of the Post-Cubist
School was originally entitled, “Niobe
Weeping for her Children,” but the
gifted artist, in recognition of Mr.
Pryce's princely offer of one thousand
guineas for the group, waived his right
to the title.
On the left we see the Foreign De-
partment. Here we watch with rapt
attention the arrival of countless busi-
ness telegrams from all parts of the
world. We choose one or two at ran-
dom and see for ourselves the ramifica-
tions of Pryce's far-flung booking ser-
vice. This one from China : “Puttee
fifty taels Boko Lanchester Cup;" an-
other from distant Siberia, emerging
from the primeval forests of that won-
drous land of the future: “Tenbobski
Quitter Ebury Handicap." . Bets are
accepted in all denominations from
Victory Bonds to the cowrie-shells of
West Africa.
Passing up the marble staircase and
leaving the Home Department on our
right we arrive at the Stumer Section.
Here a small army of ex-Scotland Yard
detectives are engaged in dealing with
mala-fide commissions—attempts on
the part of men of straw to make credit
bets, or telegrams despatched after a
race is over.
Where shall we go next? We ask
a courteous shopwalker, who in flawless
English advises us to try the Winter
Gardens, where a delightful tea is
served at a minimum cost. Here, whilst
sipping a fragrant cup of Orange Pekoe,
we can watch the large screen, on which
the results of all races are flashed within
ten seconds of the horses passing the
winning-post. At one time, in fact, it
was nothing unusual for Pryce's to
have the results posted before the horses
had completed the course, but in deſer-
ence to the prejudices of certain purists
this practice was abandoned.
Follows a hurried visit to the Library
and Museum, where we gaze enthralled
at the original pair of pigeon-blue trou-
sers with which Mr. Bookham Pryce
made his sensational début on the Lin-
coln course in the spring of 1894. We
might linger here a moment to muse
over the simple beginnings of great
men, but time is pressing and we are
all agog to visit the Bargain Basement.
An express lift flashes us downwards
in a few seconds and behold we are in
the midst of rows of counters groaning
under bargains that even the New Poor
can scarce forbear to grasp.
Here, for example, is one-hundred-to-
eight offered against Pincushion for
the Gimcrack Stakes. This wondrous
animal's lineage and previous perform-
ances are carefully tabulated on a card
at the side, and, remembering the form
he showed at Gatwick, one wonders, as
the man in the street would say, how
it is done.
Or look at Tom-tom, which left the
others simply standing in a field of
forty-four at Kempton Park, and carry-
ing eight-stone-seven. Here he has a
paltry four-pound penalty for the Wor-
cester Welter Handicap, yet one can
have seven to one about him.
How the House of Pryce can offer
such bargains is a mystery to the old
school of red-necked bookmakers, whose
Oxford accent was not pronounced.
They fail to see what courtesy, urbanity
and meat-teas at three shillings per
head can do in the way of stimulating
business.
From the Bargain Basement we
wander at will through the remaining
departments, making inquiries here
and there from the expert assistants,
technically known as laymen, without
being once importuned to make a bet.
And when at length, refreshed and
pleased with a delightſul aſternoon, we
pass again through the portals of the
House of Pryce, we make for home, con-
firmed supporters of the modern per-
sonal touch, which has transformed a
drab business into a veritable romance.

ELIZABETH GOES TO THE SALES.
“ARE you goin' to the Summer Sales
this year, 'm 2" inquired Elizabeth, sud-
denly projecting herself on the horizon
of my thoughts.
I laid down my pen at once. It is
not possible to continue writing if
Elizabeth desires to make conversation
at the same time.
“Certainly I shall, if I hear of a sale
of cheap crockery,” I replied pointedly;
“ours badly needs replenishing.”
The barbed arrow did not find its
mark. It may require a surgical opera-
tion to get a joke into a Scotsman, but
| only the medium of some high explosive
could properly convey a hint to Eliza-
beth.
“'Oo wants to go to sales to buy
things like pots?” asked Elizabeth
scornfully.
“People who are always getting their
pots broken,” I replied in italics.
| “Well, everyone to their tastes,” she
| commented casually. I began to won-
der if even trinitrotoluol could be in-
effective at times. “Wot I mean by
sales is buyin' clothes,” she continued;
“bargins, you know.”
“Yes, I know,” I answered ; “I’ve
seen them—in the advertisements. But
I never secure any.”
“Why don't you, then?”
“Because of all the other people,
Elizabeth. Those who get the bargains
seem to have a more dominant nature
than mine. They have more grit,
determination—”
“Sharper elbows is wot you mean,”
put in Elizabeth. “It's chiefly a
matter of 'oo pushes 'ardest. My I
love a sale if only for the sake o' the
scrimmage. A friend o' mine 'oo's
been separated from 'er 'usband becos
they was always fightin' told me she
never misses goin' to a sale so that
she'll be in practice in case 'er and 'er
old man make it up again.”
“I’m not surprised that I never get
any bargains,” I commented, “although
I often long to. Look at the advertise-
ment in this newspaper, for instance.
Here's a silk jumper which is absurdly
It's a lovely Rose du Barri

tricot and costs only
“’ Oo's rose doo barry trick-o when
'e's at 'ome?” inquired Elizabeth.
I translated hurriedly. “I mean it's
a pink knitted one. Exactly what I
want. But what is the use of my even
hoping to secure it 2."
“I’ll get it for you,” announced
Elizabeth.
“You ! But how 2 ''
“I’ll go an' wait an hour or two
afore the doors open, an' when they
do I don't 'arf know 'ow to fight my
way to the counters. Let me go, m'm.
I'd reelly like the outin'."
I hesitated, but only for a moment.
What could be simpler than sending an
emissary to use her elbows on my
behalf 2 There was nothing unfair in
doing that, especially if I undertook
the washing-up in her absence.
Elizabeth set out very early on the
day of the sale looking enthusiastic.
I, equally enthusiastic, applied myself
to the menial tasks usually performed
by Elizabeth. We had just finished a

tinned fruit (oh, what a blessing is a
can-opener in the absence of domestics!)
when she reappeared. My heart leapt
at the sight of a parcel in her hand.
“You got it after all!" I exclaimed.
O thrice blessed Elizabeth ! O most
excellent domestic! For the battles she
had fought that day on my behalf she
should not go unrewarded.
“I'm longing to try it on," I said as
I tore at the outer wrappings.
“Well, I orter say it isn't the one
you told me to get,” interposed Eliza-
beth. -
I paused in unwrapping the parcel,
assailed by sudden misgivings. “Isn't
this the jumper, then 2"
“Not that pertickler one. You see,
it was like this: there was a great 'orse
of a woman just in front o' me an' I
couldn't move ahead of 'er no'ow, try
as I would. It was a case o' bulk, if
you know what I mean, an' elbows
wasn't no good. An' 'ang me if she
wasn't goin' in for that there very

a good fight for it, 'm, I did indeed.
We both reached it at the same time,
got 'old of it together, an’—an'—
when it gave way at the séams I let 'er
'ave it,” said Elizabeth, concluding her
simple narrative. It sounded convinc-
ing enough. I had no reason to doubt
it at the moment.
“The beast !” I said in the bitterness
of my heart. “Is it possible a woman
could so far forget herself as to behave
like that, Elizabeth 2"
“But there's no need for you to be
disappointed, as I got a jumper for you
arter all,” she continued. She took the
final wrappings off the parcel and drew
out a garment. “There!" she remarked
proudly, holding it aloft.
The Old Masters, we are told, dis-
covered the secret of colour, but the
colour of that jumper should have been
kept a secret—it never ought to have
been allowed to leak out. It was one
of those flaming pinks that cannot be
regarded by the naked eye for any
length of time, owing to the strain it
puts on the delicate optic nerve. Bands
of purple finished off this Bolshevist
creation.
“How dare you ask me to wear that?”
I broke out when I had partially re-
covered from the shock.
“Why, wot's wrong with it? You
said you wanted a pink tricky one.
It's pink, isn't it?”
“Yes, it is pink,” I admitted faintly.
“An' it's far trickier nor wot the
other was."
“You had better keep the jumper
for yourself," I said crossly. “No doubt
it will suit you better than it would me.”

[JULY 7, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON WITH THE DANCE.
I HAVE been to a dance; or rather
I have been to a fashionable restaurant
where dancing is done. I was not in-
vited to a dance—there are very good
reasons for that; I was invited to dinner.
But many of my fellow-guests have in-
vested a lot of money in dancing. That
is to say, they keep on paying dancing-
instructors to teach them new tricks;
and the dancing-instructors, who know
their business, keep on inventing new
tricks. As soon as they have taught
everybody a new step they say it is un-
fashionable and invent a new one.
This is all very well from their point
of view, but it means that, in order to
keep up with them and get your money's
worth out of the last trick you learned,
it is necessary during its brief life of
respectability to dance at every avail-
able opportunity. You dance as many
nights a week as is physically possible;
you dance on week-days and you dance
on Sundays; you begin dancing in the
afternoon and you dance during tea in
the coffee-rooms of expensive restau-
rants, whirling your precarious way
through littered and abandoned tea-
tables; and at dinner-time you leap up
madly before the fish and dance like
variety artistes in a highly-polished
arena before a crowd of complete
strangers eating their food; or, as if
seized with an uncontrollable craving
for the dance, you fling out after the
joint for one wild gallop in an outer
room, from which you return, perspiring
and dyspeptic, to the consumption of
an ice-pudding, before dashing forth to
the final orgy at a picture-gallery, where
the walls are appropriately covered with
pictures of barbaric women dressed for
the hot weather.
That is what happened at this dinner.
As soon as you had started a nice con-
versation with a lady a sort of roaring
was heard without ; her eyes gleamed,
her nostrils quivered like a horse plan-
ning a gallop, and in the middle of one
of your best sentences she simply faded
away with some horrible man at the
other end of the table who was probably
“the only man in London who can do
the Double Straddle properly.” This
went on the whole of the meal, and it
made connected conversation quite diffi-
cult. For my own part I went on eat-
ing, and when I had properly digested
I went out and looked at the little
victims getting their money's worth.
From the door of the room where
the dancing was done a confused up-
roar overflowed, as if several men of
powei ſul physique were banging a
number of pokers against a number of
saucepans, and blowing whistles, and
occasional catcalls, and now and then
beating a drum and several sets of
huge cymbals, and ceaselessly twanging
at innumerable banjoes, and at the
same time singing in a foreign language,
and shouting curses or exhortations or
street cries, or imitating hunting-calls
and the cry of the hyena, or uniting
suddenly in the war-whoop of some
pitiless Sudan tribe.
It was a really terrible noise. It hit
you like the back-blast of an explosion
as you entered the room. There was
no distinguishable tune. It was simply
an enormous noise. But there was a
kind of savage rhythm about it which
made one think immediately of Indians
and fierce men and the native camps
one used to visit at the Earl's Court
Exhibition. And this was not sur-
prising. For the musicians included
one genuine negro and three men with
their faces blacked ; and the noise and
the rhythm were the authentic music
of a negro village in South America,
and the words which some genius had
once set to the noise were an exhor-
tation to go to the place where the
negroes dwelt.
To judge by their movements, many
of the dancers had in fact been there,
and had carefully studied the best in-
digenous models. They were doing
some quite extraordinary things. No
two couples were doing quite the same
thing for more than a few seconds, so
that there was an endless variety of
extraordinary postures. Some of them
shuffled secretly along the edge of the
room, their faces tense, their shoulders
swaying like reeds in a light wind, their
progress almost imperceptible; they did
not rotate, they did not speak, but
sometimes the tremor of a skirt or the
slight stirring of a patent-leather shoe
showed that they were indeed alive and
in motion, though that motion was as
the motion of a glacier, not to be mea-
sured in minutes or yards.
And some in a kind of fever rushed
hither and thither among the thick
crowd, avoiding disaster with mar-
wellous dexterity; and sometimes they
revolved slowly and sometimes quickly
and sometimes spun giddily round for
a moment like gyroscopic tops. Then
they too would be seized with a kind
of trance, or it may be with sheer
shortness of breath, and hung motion-
less for a little in the centre of the room,
while the mad throng jostled and flowed
about them like the leaves in Autumn
round a dead bird.
And some did not revolve at all, but
charged straightly up and down; and
some of these thrust their loves for ever
before them, as the Prussians thrust
the villagers in the face of the enemy,
and some for ever navigated themselves
backwards like moving breakwaters to
protect their darlings from the precipi-
tate seas.
Some of them kept themselves as
upright as possible, swaying slightly
like willows from the hips, and some of
them contorted themselves into strange
and angular shapes, now leaning peril-
ously forward till they were practically
lying upon their terrified partners, and
now bending sideways as a man bends
who has water in one ear after bathing.
All of them clutched each other in a
close and intimate manner, but some,
as if by separation to intensify the joy
of their union, or perhaps to secure
greater freedom for some particularly
spacious manoeuvre, would part sud-
denly in the middle of the room and,
clinging distantly with their hands, exe-
cute a number of complicated side-steps
in opposite directions, or aim a series
of vicious kicks at each other, after
which they would reunite in a passion-
ate embrace and gallop in a frenzy
round the room, or ſall into a trance
or simply fall down. If they fell down
they lay still for a moment in the fear-
ful expectation of death, as men lie who
fall under a horse; and then they would
creep on hands and knees to the wall
through the whirling and indifferent
crowd.
Watching them, you could not tell
what any one couple would do next.
The most placid and dignified among
them might at any moment fling a leg
out behind them and almost kneel in
mutual adoration, and then, as if
nothing unusual had happened, shuffle
onward through the press; or, as though
some electric mechanism had been set
in motion, they would suddenly liſt a
foot sideways and stand on one leg.
Poised pathetically, as if waiting for
the happy signal when they might put
the other leg down, these men looked
very sad, and I wished that the Medusa's
head might be smuggled somehow into
the room for their attitudes to be im-
perisbably recorded in cold stone; it

fury. Bodies buffeted one from behind,
and while one was yet looking round
in apology or anger more bodies buffeted
one from the flank. It was like swim-
ming in a choppy sea, where there is no
time to get the last wave out of your
mouth before the next one hits you.

8 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 7, 1920.
THE KING'S MESSENGER.
IN Paris Geraldine's mother sug-
gested that, as I was paying a visit to
London, I could bring Geraldine out
with me on the return journey. She
also suggested that I might bring out
a new hat for her (Geraldine's mother)
at the same time. Though being in
love neither with Geraldine's mother
nor with Geraldine's mother's hat I
had to take kindly to both, to further my
dark designs with regard to Geraldine.
In London I inspected the hat, com-
plete in box. It was immediately ob-
vious that it and I could never make
the journey to Paris together. The sight
of me carrying a hat-box at the early
hour of 8 A.M. on Victoria Station would
have put Geraldine off. Geraldine is
very pretty, but she is like that.
On reflection, the transport of the
hat from London to Paris seemed to
me to be a matter eminently suited to
the machinery of our Foreign Office.
Though the Foreign Officer is as formid-
able as a Bishop in his own cathedral,
he is, to those who persist in knowing
him personally, a man much like one-
self, fond of his glass of beer, ready to
exchange one good turn for another.
It happens that I have assisted the
F.O. to make peace much as I have
helped the W.O. to make war. In the
sacred precincts I reminded my friend
of this fact, and impressed upon him
that the consolidation of the entente
between Geraldine and myself was one
of the most urgent political matters of
the day. He was undiplomatic enough
to ask how he could help . . .
I don't want you to lose your awe of
Diplomatic Bags, but there have been
occasions when the Secret and Confi-
dential Despatch consists of little more
than a personal note from one strong
silent man to another, touching on such
domestic subjects as, say, a relative's
hat. It was eventually, if arduously,
arranged that in this instance the
despatch should consist of the hat
itself . . .
My fascinating manner of greeting
Geraldine on Victoria Station did not
betray the fact that I had seen that
arch-villain, George Nesbitt, installed
in our train, looking terribly important.
George doesn't want to marry any girl;
every girl therefore wants to marry
George. I managed to hustle Geraldine
into our carriage and get her locked in
without her seeing George. But George
had seen her, and, not knowing that he
doesn't want to marry any girl and
thinking that he wants to marry every
girl, he firmly convinced himself (I have
no doubt) that he was passionately in
love with Geraldine as he travelled down
to Folkestone in his lonely splendour.
On the Channel boat . . . but per-
haps it is fairer to all parties to omit
that part. -
At Boulogne I became inextricably
mixed up with the Customs' people;
Geraldine meanwhile got inevitably
associated with George Nesbitt. She
would, of course. Indeed, when at last
I scrambled to the Paris train, with the
cord of my pyjamas trailing from my
kit-bag, there was Geraldine installed in
George's special carriage, very sympa-
thetically studying George's passport,
wherein all Foreign Powers, great, small
and medium-sized, were invited in red
ink to regard George as It.
George informed me that, being a
King's Messenger, he was afraid he
dare not trust me, as a mere member
of the public, to travel in the same car-
riage as the Diplomatic Bag. I said I
must stay with them and keep an eye
on Geraldine. George said that he
would do that. In that case, I said, I
..would stay and keep an eye on the
Diplomatic Bag. Geraldine being at
one end of the carriage and the bag
being at the other end George could
not very well keep an eye on both.
The possibility of George's eyes wan-
dering apart when he was off his guard
made a fleeting impression on Ger-
aldine in my favour. I stayed.
George then set about to make the
most of himself. Geraldine abetted.
Geraldine is a terror. I became more
determined than ever to marry her,
George and the KING notwithstanding.
George however got going. “For a
plain fellow like myself” (he knows
how confoundedly handsome he is) “it
has been some little satisfaction to be
selected as a Special Courier.”
I explained the method of selection
as I guessed it. “He forced his way
into the F.O. and in an obsequious
tone, which you and I, Geraldine, would
be ashamed to adopt, begged for the
favour of a bag to carry with him. If
the KING had known about it he would
rather have sent his messages by post.”
“The general public,” said George
to Geraldine, “is apt to be very noisy
and tiresome on railway journeys, is it
not 2 '' -
Geraldine acquiesced. She doesn't
often do that, but when she does it is
extremely pleasant for the acquiescee.
I pressed on with my explanation des-
perately. “I can hear poor old George
pleading in a broken voice that he had
to get to Paris and dared not go by
himself. So they listened to his sad
story and gave him a bag to see him
through, and it isn't George who is
taking the bag to Paris, but the bag
which is taking George.” To prevent
him arguing I told Geraldine that you
can tell a real K.M. by his S.lver
Greyhound badge, which he'll show
you if you doubt him, just as you can
tell a stockbroker by his pearl tie-pin,
which you can see for yourself. This
put George on his mettle.
“To think that to me are entrusted
messages which may alter the map of
Europe and change the history of the
world! But I mustn't let my conceit
run away with me, must I?” Posi-
tively I believe Geraldine at that began
to play with the idea of doing what
George said he mustn't let his conceit
do. Anyhow I had half-an-hour to
myself while she listened to the inner
histories of European Courts and flirted
with the Bearer of Despatches. I was
left gazing at the bag.
There was only one bag, but it was
very bulky. The contents were a tight
fit; something round, about a yard in
diameter, about a foot and a half in
depth.
“Are you looking after this bag of
yours properly, George 2 " I asked.
“We shall be very angry with you if
you go and lose it.” Something inde-
finable but intensely important in my
tone caught Geraldine's attention.
“That is between me and the F.O.,”
said George irritably.
“When I was talking to them about
it—” said I.
“What have you to do with the
Foreign Office?" asked Geraldine.
“Little enough,” I said modestly.
“I have my own business to see to.
But the F.O. have always wanted to
have something to do with me. So I
gave them the job of looking after your
mother's hat. Had I known that they
would send it along by any Tom, Dick
or George who happened to drop in
and offer to take the bag 1 p.
George snatched the bag, examined
it hastily and then tried to conceal it
behind his own luggage. But Geraldine
knows enough about hats to be able to
spot a hatbox, when put to it, through
all the heavy canvas and all the fancy
labels in the world. So there was
nothing more to be said about it; and
there was little more to be done about
it except for George to go on doing
special messenger with it. The inner
histories died down and, after a brief
silence, George affected to go to sleep.
I only woke him up once and that
was to ask whether he cared to look
after the rest of my luggage for me.
When we got to Paris I explained to
George that I had not meant to hurt
his feelings; there was no fellow I
would more gladly entrust my odd jobs
to. Indeed Geraldine and I should want
him to officiate in a similar capacity at
the coming ceremony.
A very satisfactory conclusion. I
got Geraldine; Geraldine got her full

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, June 28th.-Less than thirty
years ago, the prophets of ill foresaw
ruin for the British shipping trade if
the dock labourers got their “tanner.”
The “tanner” has now become a florin,
and this afternoon the Peers passed
without a dissentient voice the Second
Reading of a Bill to enable Port and
Harbour authorities to pay it.
They were much more critical over
the Increase of Rent Bill, and at the
instance of Lord MIDLETON defeated by
a two to one majority the Government's
proposal to deprive landlords of the
power to evict strikers in order to pro-|:
and he had no intention of using force to
compel her. WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN,
he considered, was not worth any more
bloodshed.
In that case the Govern-
vide accommodation for men willing to |º
work. But the Government got a little
of their own back on the clause author- *
ising an increase of rent on business|º
premises by forty per cent. Lord SALIS-
BURY wanted seventy-five per cent. and
haughtily refused Lord Astor's sport-
ing offer of fifty, but on a division he
was beaten by 25 to 23.
In the Commons Sir FREDERICK HALL
complained that slate and slack were still
being supplied to London consumers
under the guise and at the price of coal.
What was the Government going to do
about it? Mr. BRIDGEMAN replied that
control having been removed the Gov-
ernment could do nothing, and con-
sumers must find their own remedy—a
reply which drove Sir FREDERIck into
such paroxysms of indignation that the
SPEAKER was obliged
to intervene.
Mr. KILEY's gloomy
vaticinations as to the
disastrous effect of the
Plumage Bill on
British commerce met
with no encourage-
ment from Sir Robert
HoRNE. In his opin-
ion, I gather, our
foreign trade is quite
safe, and the Bill will
not knock a feathe
out of it. ... *
To Wiscount CUR-
zoN's inquiry whether
the Allies were going
to proceed with the
trial of the Ex-KAIs ER -ºf-
the PRIME MINISTER
at first replied that he
had “nothing to add." '

The intellectual development of our
domestic animals evidently proceeds
apace. We have all heard of the learned
pig, but that the cow also should be
deemed capable of conducting actuarial
calculations does, I confess, surprise
IIle.
Having heard the latest feat of the
Sinn Feiners in kidnapping a British
General, the House evidently considered
that it had better hurry up with the
Government of Ireland Bill. Clauses
51 to 69 were run through in double-
quick time. Only on Clause 70, pro-
viding for the repeal of the Home Rule
Act of 1914, did any prolonged debate
arise. Captain WEDGwood BENN pleas-
antly described this as the only clause
in the Bill that was not nonsense, and
therefore moved its omission. He was
#|answered by the PRIME MINISTER, who
declared that no Irishman would now
be content, with the Act of 1914, and
defended the present Bill on the curious
ground that it gave Ireland as much
self-government as Scotland had ever
asked for. Sir Edward CARson's plea
that it was a case of “this Bill or an
Irish Republic" was probably more
convincing. In a series of divisions the
“Wee Frees" never mustered more
than seventeen votes. The author of
the Act of 1914, Mr. Asquith, was not
present at the obsequies.
Tuesday, June 29th.-The establish-
ment of a “National home” for the
Jewish race in Pales-
tine aroused the ap-
prehensions of Lord
SYDENHAM and other
Peers, who feared that
the Moslem inhabi-
tants would be ex-
ploited by the Zion-
ists, and would en-
deavour to re-establish
Turkish rule. Lord
CURzoN did his best
to remove these im-
pressions. Authority
in Palestine would be
exercised by Great
Britain as the Man-
datory Power, and the
Zionists would not be
masters in their “nat-
ional home,” but only
a sort of “paying
guests." The confi-
dence felt in Sir HER-
BERT SAMUEL's abso-
lute impartiality as
between Jews and
Arabs was such that
a high authority had
prophesied that with-

l'aces.
In the Commons Mr. BALDw1N ex-
plained that the Inland Revenue
Authorities were taking all possible
steps to collect income-tax in Ireland
despite the obstacles placed in their
way by the local authorities. Where-
upon Sir MAURICE DocKRELL, in his
richest brogue, summarised the Irish
situation as follows: “Is not the diffi-
culty that they do not know which

A Bill “to continue temporarily the
office of Food Controller” was read a
first time. The House would, I think,
be sorry to part with Mr. McCURDY,
whose replies to Questions are often
much to the point. He was asked this
afternoon, for example, to give the
salaries of three of his officials, and this
would involve three or four times that
amount.
Wednesday, June 30th.-The Lords
discussed, in whispers suitable to the
occasion, the Official Secrets Bill. As
originally drawn it provided that any
person retaining without lawful autho-
rity any official document should be
guilty of a misdemeanour. But, thanks
to the vigilance of Lords BURNHAM and
RIDDELL, this clause, under which every
editor in Fleet Street might have found
himself in Holloway, was appreciably
softened. Even so, the pursuit of
“stunts” and "scoops” will be a de-
cidedly hazardous occupation.
The Press Lords were again on the
alert when the Rents Bill came on, and
objected to a clause giving the LoRD

all from an office in Whitehall. By
the Ministry of Mines Bill it is pro-
posed to treat the mines in much the
same way. Sir ERIC GEDDEs' scheme
has yet to run the gauntlet of Parliamen-
tary criticism. Sir Robert HoRNE's had
its baptism of fire this afternoon, and
a pretty hot fire it was. Miners like
Mr. BRACE cursed it because it did not
go all the way to Nationalisation; coal-
owners like Sir CLIFFord Cory, because
it went too far in that direction. The
voice of the mere consumer, who only
wants coal cheap and plentiful, was
hardly heard. The second reading was
carried, but by a majority substantially
less than the normal.

Irish opinion, as ex-
pressed by Lords DUN-

bably cause the seeth-
ing pot to boil over.

their salaries would not exceed seven

THREE EXCEPTIONAL MEN.
“If these men are types, how London
has changed ' " I said to myself. But
can they be? I fear not; I fear that
“exceptional" is the only word to use.
Yet it was very remarkable to meet
them all on the same day, Friday,
June 25th.
The first was on an omnibus. A big
man with a grey beard who was alone
on the seat. Several other seats had
only one passenger; the rest—mine
among them—were full. At West-
minster came up a youth and a girl
who very obviously were lovers. Owing
to the disposition of the seats they had
to separate, the girl subsiding into the
place beside the big man immediately
in front of me. At first he said nothing,
and then, just as we were passing the
scaffolding of the Cenotaph, he did
something which proved him to be very
much out of the common, a creature
apart. Reaching across and touching
the youth on the shoulder, he said,
“Let me change places with you. I
expect you young people would like to
sit together.”
That was exceptional, you will agree.
He was right too; the young people
did like to sit together. I could see
that. And the more the omnibus rocked
and lurched the more they liked it.
The second exceptional man was a
taxi-driver. I wanted to get to a cer-
tain office before it shut, and there were
very few minutes to do it in. The
driver did his best, but we arrived just
too late; the door was locked.
“That 's a bit of hard luck,” he
said. “But they're all so punctual
closing now. It's the daylight-saving
does it. Makes people think of the
open-air more than they used.”
As I finished paying him—no small
affair, with all the new supplements—
he resumed.
“I'm sorry you had the journey for
nothing,” he said. “It's rough. But
never mind—have something on Com-
rade for the Grand Prix” (he pronounced
“Prix” to rhyme with “fix”) “in France
on Sunday. I'm told it's the goods.
Then you won't mind about your bad
luck this afternoon. Don't forget—
Comrade to win and one, two, three.”
After this I must revise my opinion
of taxi-drivers, which used not to
be very high : especially as Comrade
differed from most racehorses of my
acquaintance by coming in first.
The third man perhaps was more
unexpected than exceptional. His un-
expectedness took the form not of bene-
volence but of culture. He is a vendor
of newspapers. A pleasant old fellow
with a smiling weather-beaten face, grey
moustache and a cloth cap, whom I have

known for most of the six years during
which he has stood every afternoon
except Sundays on the kerb between a
lamp-post and a letter-box at one of
London's busiest corners. I have bought
his papers and referred to the weather
all that time, but I never talked with
him before. Why, I cannot say; I sup-
pose because the hour had not struck.
On Friday, however, we had a little con-
versation, all growing from the circum-
stance that while he was counting out
change I noticed a ſat volume protrud-
ing from his coat pocket and asked him
what it was.
It was his reply that qualified him to
be numbered among Friday's elect.
“That book?” he said—“that 's Bar-
chester Towers.”
I asked him if he read much.
He said he loved reading, and par-
ticularly stories. MARIE CoRELLI,
OUIDA, he read them all; but TROLLOPE
was his favourite. He liked novels in
series; he liked to come on the same
people again. -
“But there's another reason,” he
added, “why I like TRollope. You see
we were both at the Post Office.”
Some day soon I am going to try him
with one of Mr. WALKLEY's criticisms.

PRISCILLA PAINTS.
“THERE was a lot of men in the
boat,” said Priscilla from behind the
table, where she sat daubing with little
energetic grunts.
“Oh, there were, were there?” I
answered from behind The Times.
Confident of arousing my enthusiasm
in the end, she continued to issue tan-
talising bulletins about the progress of
the great work.
“It was an all-colour boat,” she told
me, “purple and yellow and green."
“A very nice kind of boat too,” I
agreed.
“And the biggest man of all
got any body at all.”
I suggested weakly that perhaps the
biggest man of all had left his body
behind on the table at home. The
suggestion was scorned.
“No, he hadn't never had any body
at all, this man,” she replied. And
then, as my interest seemed to be flag-
ging again, “They all had very rosy
faces; and do you know why they had 2"
“I don't, I'm sure.”
“Because they'd eaten up all their
greens.” *
Wanquished at last, I went over to
visit the eupeptic voyagers. Seven in
all, they stood in their bright boat on
a blue sea beneath a round and burning
sun. Their legs were long and thin,
their bodies globular (all save one), and
their faces large. They were dressed
apparently in light pink doublets and
hose, and on his head each wore a huge
purple turban the shape of a cottage
loaf, surmounted by a ragged plume.
They varied greatly in stature, but their
countenances were all fixed in the same
unmeaning stare. Take it all in all, it
was an eerie and terrible scene.
“I don't quite see how the boat
moves along, Priscilla,” I said; “it
hasn't any oars or sail.” -
It was a tactless remark and the
artist made no reply. I did my best
to cover my blunder.
“I expect the wind blew very hard
on their feathers,” I said, “and that
drove them along.”
“What colour is the wind 2'' in-
quired Priscilla.
She had me there.
I did not know.
“It was a brown wind,” she decided,
impatient at my lack of resource, and
slapped a wet typhoon of madder on
the page. There was no more doubt
about the wind.
“And is the picture finished now 2"
I asked her.
“No, it isn't finished.
drawn the pookin yet.”
The pookin is a confusion in the mind
of Priscilla between a pelican and a
hadn't
I confessed that
I haven't
toucan, because she saw them both for
the first time on the same day. In this
case it consisted of an indigo splodge
and a long red bar cutting right through
the brown wind and penetrating deeply
into the yellow sun.
“It had a very long beak,” observed
Priscilla.
“It had,” I agreed.
I am no stickler for commonplace
colours or conventional shapes in a
work of art, but I do like things to be
recognisable; to know, for instance,
when a thing is meant to be a man and
when it is meant to be a boat, and when
it is meant to be a pookin and when it
is meant to be a sun. The art of Pris-
cilla seems to me to satisfy this test
much better than that of many of our
modern maestri. Strictly representa-
tional it may not be, but there are none
of your whorls and cylinders and angles
and what nots.
But I also insist that a work of art
should appeal to the imagination as
well as to the eye, and there seemed
to me details about this picture that
needed clearing up.
“Where were these men going to,
Priscilla 2 " I asked. -
“They was going to Wurvin,” she
answered in the tone of a mother who
instructs her child. “And what do you
think they was going to do there?"
“I don't know.”
“They was going to see Auntie Isabel.”
“And what did they do then 2"
“They had dinner,” she cried enthusi-
astically. “And do you know what they
did after dinner ?”
“I don't.”
“They went on the Front to see the
fire-escape.”
It seemed to me now that the con-
ception was mellow, rounded and com-
plete. It had all the haunting mystery
and romance of the sea about it. It
was reminiscent of the Ancient Mariner.
It savoured of the books of Mr. Con RAD.
It reminded me not a little of those
strange visitations which come to quiet
watering-places in the novels of Mr.
H. G. WELLs. When I thought of those
seven men—one, alas, disembodied—
so strangely attired yet so careful of
elementary hygiene, driven by that
fierce typhoon, with that bird of portent
in the skies, arriving suddenly with the
salt of their Odyssey upon their brows
at the beach of the genteel and respec-
table Sussex town, and visiting a per-
haps slightly perturbed Auntie Isabel,
and afterwards the fire-escape, I felt
that here was the glimpse of the wild
exotic adventure for which the hearts of
all of us yearn. It left the cinema
standing. It beat the magazine story
to a frazzle.
“And who is the picture for, Pris-
cilla?" I asked, when I had thoroughly
steeped myself in the atmosphere.
“It's for you,” she said, presenting
it with a motley-coloured hand; “it’s
for you to take to London town and
not to drop it.”
I was careful to do as I was told,
because I have a friend who paints Ex-
pressionist pictures, and I wished to
deliver it at his studio. It seems to
me that Priscilla, half-unconsciously
perhaps, is founding a new school of
art which demands serious study. One
might call it, I think, the Pookin
School. — Dvor.
WHEN CHARL, COMES OVER.
IT is said that Mr. CHARLEs CHAPLIN,
a prominent citizen of Los Angeles, Cal.,
has employed the greater part of the
last few days in mopping his brow, sigh-
ing with relief and exclaiming “Gee!”
Mr. CHAPLIN declares that missing
the boat for England recently was the
narrowest escape from death he has
ever enjoyed. But for having been thus
providentially prevented from visiting
his native land in the company of Miss
MARY PICKFoRD and Mr. Douglas
FAIRBANKs (better known as “MARY "
and “Doug.” respectively) he would
have come back to the dear homeland
all unprepared for what would surely
have happened to him no less than it
happened to his illustrious colleagues
in the film world.
Since his promised visit to our shores
cannot long be delayed, he has already
begun elaborate preparations for travel-
ling in safety. He is growing a large
beard and is learning to walk with his
toes turned in. A number of his teeth
will be blackened out during the whole
of his European tour, and his hair will
be kept well-ironed and cropped short.
He has engaged a complete staff of
plain-clothes pugilists to travel with
him everywhere and to stand on guard
outside his bathroom door. They will
also surround him during meal-times
to prevent admirers from grabbing his
food to hand down to their children as
heirlooms.
He is being measured for a complete
outfit of holeproof clothing, and his
motor will be a Ford of seventeen
thicknesses, with armoured steel win-
dows, and fitted with first-aid acces-
sories, including liniment, restoratives
and raw steak. His entourage will in-
clude a day doctor, a night doctor, a
leading New York surgeon and a squad
of stretcher-bearers.
It has been suggested to him that a
further precaution would be not to ad-
vise the Press of the date of his arrival;
but that he considers would be carry-
ing his safety-first measures to a foolish
extreme.

WHATEvER else may be said about Mr. ARTHUR CoMPtoN-
RICKETT as a novelist, it can at least be urged for him that
he displays no undue apprehension of the too-facile laugh.
For example, the humorous possibilities (or perils) in the
plot of The Shadow of Stephen Wade (JENKINs) might well
have daunted a writer of more experience. Stephen Wade
was an ancestor, dead some considerable time before the
story opens, and—to quote the old jest—there was no com-
plaint about a circumstance with which everybody was well
satisfied. The real worry over Stephen was twofold: first,
that in life he had been rightly suspected of being rather
more than a bit of a rip, and secondly that his grandson,
Philip, the hero of the story, had what seemed to him good
cause for believing that Stephen's more regrettable tendencies
were being repeated in himself. Here, of course, is a theme
capable of infinite varieties of development; the tragedies
of heredity have kept novelists and dramatists busy since
fiction began. The trouble is that, all unconsciously, Mr.
CoMPTON-Rickett has given to his hero's struggles a
fatally humorous turn. Philip's initial mistake appeared to
be the supposition that safety could be secured by flight.
But it has been remarked before now that Cupid is winged
and doth range. Philip dashed into the depths of Devon-
shire, only to discover that even there farmers have pretty
daughters; seeking refuge in the slums he found that the
exchange was one from the frying-pan to the fire. In short,

there was no peace for him, till the destined heroine . . .
Well, you can now see whether you are likely to be amused,
edified, or bored by a well-meaning story, told (I should
add) with a rather devastating solemnity of style.
M. HENRI Doxieller, the author of Behind the Scenes at
German Headquarters (HURST AND BLACKETT), must also be
accounted among the prophets, for he foretold the invasion
of Belgium. Before the War he edited a newspaper in
Charleville, and when the Ardennes had been “inundated
by the enemy hordes" and the local authorities had with-
drawn to Rethel, he stayed in Charleville and acted as
Secretary to the Municipal Commission. This organisation
was recognised by the Germans, but to be secretary of
it was still a dangerous post, and M. MAURICE BARR3s in
eloquent preface tells us of some of the sufferings that M.
DoMELIER had to endure while trying to carry out his diffi-
cult duties. The French who remained in Charleville had
more than ample opportunities of seeing both the Ex-KAIseſ:
and self-possession, it is plain that Mary loves the busy
managing director; but Jim's feelings are more difficult to
fathom. In fact he is so long in mentioning his passion
that it is quite a relief when, on the last page but one, what
publishers call the “love interest” suddenly strengthens and
their engagement is announced, very suitably and to her
entire satisfaction, to the charwoman at the foundry.
Open the Door won the two hundred and fifty pounds
prize offered by Messrs. MELRose, and without troubling
to inquire into the merits of its rivals I wholeheartedly
commend the award. For some curious reason its length
(one hundred and eighty thousand words—no less) is in-
sisted upon by the publishers, but as a matter of fact Miss
CATHERINE CARswell's novel would have been even more
remarkable if it had been of a less generous bulk. Her style
is beyond reproach and she has nothing whatever to learn
in the mysteries of a woman's heart. The principal scenes
are placed in Glasgow, and the Bannermann family are laid
and his eldest son, and
M. Doxieller writes
of them with a pen
dipped in gall. No
book that I have read
puts before one more
poignantly the mis-
eries which the in-
habitants of invaded
France had to bear dur-
ing “the greatagony.”
For the most part they
bore them with a cour-
age beyond all praise;
but some few, giving
way under stress of
physical suffering or
moral temptation, for-
got their nationality;
and these M. Dome-
LIER makes no pre-
tence to spare. I think
that even those of us
who have definitely
made up our minds re-

stark before us. Mrs.
Bannermann was so
intent on the next
world that for all
practical purposes she
was useless in this.
Having been left a
widow with two sons
and two daughters,
she was incapable of
managing the easiest
of them, let alone such
an emotional com-
plexity as Joanna. It
is upon Joanna that
Miss CARswell, has
concent rated her
forces; but she is not
less happy in her anal-
ysis of the many lovers
who fell into the net of
this seductive young
woman. Indeed I
have not for many a
day read a novel of
garding the Hun and
want to read no more about him will welcome this book.
For if it is primarily an indictment of Germans and
German methods, it is hardly less a tribute to those who
held firm through all their misery and never gave up hope
during the darkest days.
I have before now met (in books) heroes who wore
dungaree and had as setting an engineer-shop or a foundry,
but never one who equalled Jim Robinson (Hutchinson) in
the strictness of his attention to business. Jim is the
managing director of Cupreouscine, Limited, a firm which
deals in a wonderful copper alloy which he himself has
invented, and the book tells the story of his long and losing
fight against the other directors, who are all in favour
of amalgamation with another and much larger concern.
Sketched in so few words the book's subject sounds un-
attractive, but Miss USA L. SILBERRAD has a genius for
making “shop" as interesting in her novels as it usually is
in real life, and Jim's plans and enterprises and the cir-
cuitous ways of the other directors provide material for
quite an exciting story. When I say “other directors,” Mary
Gore, representing a brother on the board of Cupreouscine
and backing Jim through thick and thin to the limit of her
powers, must be excepted. In spite of her gracious reserve
which the psychology
seemed to me to be so thoroughly sound.
I hope “Miss M. E. FRANcis" will take it as a compli-
ment when I say that Beck of Beckford (ALLEN AND UNwiN)
should form part of the holiday equipment of all of us whose
brows are not too exalted to enjoy it. In her unostentatious
way Miss FRANCIs knows how to provide ample entertain-
ment, and she has nothing to learn in point of form. When
we are introduced to the Becks they are proud and poor,
having impoverished themselves in the process of removing
a blot from their escutcheon. Sir John is a working farmer,
and Lady Beck does menial duties with an energy that
most servants of to-day would not care to imitate. The
apple of their old eyes is their grandson, Roger, and the
story turns on his struggle between pride and love. No true
Franciscan need be told that he comes through his struggle
with flying colours. So quietly and easily does the tale run
that one is apt to overlook the art with which it is told.
But the art is there all the time.

A CRICKET MANNERISM.
A writeR commented recently in an
article in Punch on the advantage to
a cricketer of some harmless manner-
ism, giving as an instance Mr. P. F.
WARNER's habit of hitching up the left
side of his trousers and patting the
ground seven times with his bat. This
homely touch reminded me irresistibly
of Rankin. Not that Rankin resembles
Mr. WARNER even remotely in any other
way. But Rankin has a mannerism,
one which is fairly harmless, too, as a
general rule. If on one occasion, of
which I will tell you, it had unfortunate
results, there was then a combination
of circumstances for which Rankin was
not entirely responsible. That much I
now feel myself able to admit. At the
time I could see nothing good about
Rankin at all.
Rankin resides in our village of Little-
borough, and is by trade what is known
as a jobbing gardener. On Thursdays he
is my gardener, on Wednesdays Mrs.
Dobbie's gardener, and so on. On
Saturday afternoons he plays cricket.
Or at least he dresses in (among other
garments) a pair of tight white flannel
trousers and a waistcoat, and joins the
weekly game.
Recently we met in deadly combat
the neighbouring village of Smallwick.
Away into the unchronicled past runs
the record of these annual contests.
Each village hints that it has gained
the greater number of victories; each
is inclined in its heart to believe that
the other one has actually done so—
because, as I suppose, the agony of de-
feat leaves a more lasting impression
than the joy of victory. But I digress.
We have not even got to Rankin's
mannerism yet.
Rankin's mannerism is the habit of
plunging his hands into his trouser
pockets. A very ordinary one, you will
say; but not when carried to the extent
to which Rankin carries it. It is useless
for Rankin to field at short slip, for in-
stance. The only time he did so a catch
struck him sharply in the lower chest
(and fell to the ground, of course) before
he had time to take his hands out of his
pockets. When he is batting he crams
one hand into his pocket between each
delivery. As he wears a large batting
glove and his trousers are very tight
(as I mentioned before) this is a matter
of some difficulty. In fact we usually
attribute the smallness of his scores to
its unsteadying effect.
How he ever survived five years of
military service without being shot for
persistently carrying his hands in his
pockets while on parade, to the detri-
ment of good order and military discip-
line, I can never understand. Surely
some Brass-hat, inspecting Rankin's
regiment, must have noticed that Ran-
kin's hands were in his pockets when
he should have been presenting arms ?
I can only presume that they all loved
Rankin, and love is blind. Well, he is
quite a good chap. I like him myself.
We now come to the day of the
Smallwick v. Littleborough match.
Smallwick lost the toss and went out
to field, and, as one of their players had
not arrived, Rankin went with them as
a substitute. * -
We lost three wickets for only ten
runs, and then I went in. It was one
of my rare cricket days. I felt, I knew,
that I should make runs—not much
more than twenty, of course, but then
twenty is a big score for Littleborough.
And I felt like twenty at least.
Rankin was fielding at deep long-on,
close to the tent; but they had no one
at square leg, which is my special direc-
tion on my twenty days. Presently the
bowler offered me a full pitch on the
leg side. I timed it successfully, and
had no doubt of having added four to
my score, when, to my astonishment,
I saw a fieldsman running from the
direction of the hedge. The next mo-
ment he had brought off a very credit-
able catch.
It did not dawn on me at first that
this was their eleventh man, arrived at
that moment. When it did, I could not
help laughing to think that he should
imagine he could rush in like that while
his substitute was still fielding. Then
I heard the bowler appeal to the umpire,
and to my horror I heard the umpire
(their umpire) say “Out.”
“But they can't have twelve men
fielding,” I cried. “The substitute is
still there.”
“You're out, Sir,” said the umpire
haughtily. “The substitoot has already
retired. 'E's standing there watching
the game with 'is 'ands in 'is pockets.”
A Self-Starter.
“Born of an Iris moter and a Scots father,
in Chicago, U.S.A., Mr. 's ability for the
stage developed very early.”
New Zealand Paper.
“Within the square of spectators were
paraded about two thousand Girl Guides. It
delighted the eye to see the companies march
with precision and smartness, while the ear
was charmed and the marital spirit stirred by
the music of the pipes and drums.”
Scotch Paper.
So that 's the idea.
“Soon we could make out the Sultan's
Palace, from which the tired 'Hunter of the
East' was now unwinding his ‘nose of light.’”

PHILOSOPHERS.
WE are all different, and often our
differences are of the widest. Some
men can be knocked prostrate by the
most trifling disappointment, while
others can extract comfort or even
positive benefit from what looks like
complete disaster—such as the Cam-
bridge youth I met last week, raving
about TURNER's “Fighting Téméraire.”
“But I didn't know you were inter-
ested in pictures,” I said.
“Oh, yes, I've always been, in a
way,” he replied; “but it wasn't till
the rain ruined the first day of the
Varsity match that I ever had a real
chance to get to the National Gallery,
and when it came down like blazes
again on Tuesday I went back there.
Did you ever see such painting 2 And
the pathos of it too! And then that
frosty morning scene in the same room
Why, TURNER was too wonderful.”
How some of the other dampened
enthusiasts tided over their loss I can
only guess; but this ardent one re-
minded me of the Shipwrecked Ento-
mologist, and I placed him on a niche
somewhere near that radiant soul.
And who was he 2
Well, he was the curator of his own
department in some Indian museum—
I think at Calcutta—and when the time
came for his holiday he took a passage
for Japan on a little tramp steamer.
Everything went well until a few hours
out of Shanghai, when a typhoon began
to blow with terrific force. The ship
was driven on the coast of Korea, where
she set about breaking up, and only
with the greatest difficulty did the pas-
sengers and crew get to shore, bruised
and saturated, without anything but
their clothes and what their pockets
could hold. Some lives were lost, but
my man was saved. - *
It was a desolate part, with nothing
but the poorest huts for shelter, dirty
and verminous, so that the discomforts
of the land were almost equal to the
perils of the sea. -
Naturally, on his return to Calcutta
the curator was plied with questions.
How did he feel about it? • Wasn't it
an awful experience? If ever a man
deserved sympathy it was he. And so
forth. But he wouldn't rise. -
“Sympathy?”hesaid. “Good Heavens!
I don't want sympathy. Why, I had
the time of my life. Do you know that
during the night in that Korean hovel
I found five absolutely new kinds of
bug.” E. W. L.

there was no peace for him, till the destined heroine . . .
Well, you can now see whether you are likely to be amused,
edified, or bored by a well-meaning story, told (I should
add) with a rather devastating solemnity of style.
M. HENRI Doxieller, the author of Behind the Scenes at
German Headquarters (HURST AND BLACKETT), must also be
accounted among the prophets, for he foretold the invasion
of Belgium. Before the War he edited a newspaper in
Charleville, and when the Ardennes had been “inundated
by the enemy hordes" and the local authorities had with-
drawn to Rethel, he stayed in Charleville and acted as
Secretary to the Municipal Commission. This organisation
was recognised by the Germans, but to be secretary of
it was still a dangerous post, and M. MAURICE BARR3s in
eloquent preface tells us of some of the sufferings that M.
DoMELIER had to endure while trying to carry out his diffi-
cult duties. The French who remained in Charleville had
more than ample opportunities of seeing both the Ex-KAISER
and self-possession, it is plain that Mary loves the busy
managing director; but Jim's feelings are more difficult to
fathom. In fact he is so long in mentioning his passion
that it is quite a relief when, on the last page but one, what
publishers call the “love interest” suddenly strengthens and
their engagement is announced, very suitably and to her
entire satisfaction, to the charwoman at the foundry.
Open the Door won the two hundred and fifty pounds
prize offered by Messrs. MELRose, and without troubling
to inquire into the merits of its rivals I wholeheartedly
commend the award. For some curious reason its length
(one hundred and eighty thousand words—no less) is in-
sisted upon by the publishers, but as a matter of fact Miss
CATHERINE CARswell's novel would have been even more
remarkable if it had been of a less generous bulk. Her style
is beyond reproach and she has nothing whatever to learn
in the mysteries of a woman's heart. The principal scenes
are placed in Glasgow, and the Bannermann family are laid
and his eldest son, and
M. Dom ELIER writes
of them with a pen
dipped in gall. No
book that I have read
puts before one more
poignantly the mis-
eries which the in-
habitants of invaded
Francehadtobeardur,
ing “the greatagony.”
For the most part they
bore them with a cour-
age beyond all praise;
but some few, giving -
way under stress of
physical suffering or
moral temptation, for-
got their nationality;
and these M. Dome-
LIER makes no pre-
tence to spare. I think
that even those of us
who have definitely
made up our minds re-

stark before us. Mrs.
Bannermann was so
intent on the next
world that for all
practical purposes she
was useless in this.
Having been left a
widow with two sons
and two daughters,
= | she was incapable of
# managing the easiest
of them, let alone such
an emotional com-
plexity as Joanna. It
is upon Joanna that
Miss CARswell, has
concent rated her
forces; but she is not
less happy in her anal-
ysis of the manylovers
who fell into the net of
this seductive young
woman. Indeed I
have not for many a
day read a novel of
garding the Hun and
want to read no more about him will welcome this book.
For if it is primarily an indictment of Germans and
German methods, it is hardly less a tribute to those who
held firm through all their misery and never gave up hope
during the darkest days.
I have before now met (in books) heroes who wore
dungaree and had as setting an engineer-shop or a foundry,
but never one who equalled Jim Robinson (HUTCHINsoN) in
the strictness of his attention to business. Jim is the
managing director of Cupreouscine, Limited, a firm which
deals in a wonderful copper alloy which he himself has
invented, and the book tells the story of his long and losing
fight against the other directors, who are all in favour
of amalgamation with another and much larger concern.
Sketched in so few words the book's subject sounds un-
attractive, but Miss USA L. SILBERRAD has a genius for
making “shop" as interesting in her novels as it usually is
in real life, and Jim's plans and enterprises and the cir-
cuitous ways of the other directors provide material for
quite an exciting story. When I say “other directors,” Mary
Gore, representing a brother on the board of Cupreouscine
and backing Jim through thick and thin to the limit of her
powers, must be excepted. In spite of her gracious reserve
which the psychology
seemed to me to be so thoroughly sound.
I hope “Miss M. E. FRANCIs" will take it as a compli-
ment when I say that Beck of Beckford (ALLEN AND UNWIN)
should form part of the holiday equipment of all of us whose
brows are not too exalted to enjoy it. In her unostentatious
way Miss FRANCIs knows how to provide ample entertain-
ment, and she has nothing to learn in point of form. When
we are introduced to the Becks they are proud and poor,
having impoverished themselves in the process of removing
a blot from their escutcheon. Sir John is a working farmer,
and Lady Beck does menial duties with an energy that
most servants of to-day would not care to imitate. The
apple of their old eyes is their grandson, Roger, and the
story turns on his struggle between pride and love. No true
Franciscan need be told that he comes through his struggle
with flying colours. So quietly and easily does the tale run
that one is apt to overlook the art with which it is told.
But the art is there all the time.
“You can greet an acquaintance while you are cycling by smiling
and nodding your head or by waving. Which you do depends on the
depth of your acquaintanceship.”—Home Notes.
And not, as you might think, on your proficiency as a cyclist.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 14, 1920.
A CRICKET MANNERISM.
A writeR commented recently in an
article in Punch on the advantage to
a cricketer of some harmless manner-
ism, giving as an instance Mr. P. F.
WARNER's habit of hitching up the left
side of his trousers and patting the
ground seven times with his bat. This
homely touch reminded me irresistibly
of Rankin. Not that Rankin resembles
Mr. WARNER even remotely in any other
way. But Rankin has a mannerism,
one which is fairly harmless, too, as a
general rule. If on one occasion, of
which I will tell you, it had unfortunate
results, there was then a combination
of circumstances for which Rankin was
not entirely responsible. That much I
now feel myself able to admit. At the
time I could see nothing good about
Rankin at all.
Rankin resides in our village of Little-
borough, and is by trade what is known
as a jobbing gardener. On Thursdays he
is my gardener, on Wednesdays Mrs.
Dobbie's gardener, and so on. On
Saturday afternoons he plays cricket.
Or at least he dresses in (among other
garments) a pair of tight white flannel
trousers and a waistcoat, and joins the
weekly game.
Recently we met in deadly combat
the neighbouring village of Smallwick.
Away into the unchronicled past runs
the record of these annual contests.
Each village hints that it has gained
the greater number of victories; each
is inclined in its heart to believe that
the other one has actually done so—
because, as I suppose, the agony of de-
feat leaves a more lasting impression
than the joy of victory. Dut I digress.
We have not even got to Rankin's
mannerism yet.
Rankin's mannerism is the habit of
plunging his hands into his trouser
pockets. A very ordinary one, you will
say; but not when carried to the extent
to which Rankin carries it. It is useless
for Rankin to field at short slip, for in-
stance. The only time he did so a catch
struck him sharply in the lower chest
(and fell to the ground, of course) before
he had time to take his hands out of his
pockets. When he is batting he crams
one hand into his pocket between each
delivery. As he wears a large batting
glove and his trousers are very tight
(as I mentioned before) this is a matter
of some difficulty. In fact we usually
attribute the smallness of his scores to
its unsteadying effect.
How he ever survived five years of
military service without being shot for
persistently carrying his hands in his
pockets while on parade, to the detri-
ment of good order and military discip-
line, I can never understand. Surely
some Brass-hat, inspecting Rankin's
regiment, must have noticed that Ran-
kin's hands were in his pockets when
he should have been presenting arms ?
I can only presume that they all loved
Rankin, and love is blind. Well, he is
quite a good chap. I like him myself.
We now come to the day of the
Smallwick v. Littleborough match.
Smallwick lost the toss and went out
to field, and, as one of their players had
not arrived, Rankin went with them as
a substitute. -
We lost three wickets for only ten
runs, and then I went in. It was one
of my rare cricket days. I felt, I knew,
that I should make runs—not much
more than twenty, of course, but then
twenty is a big score for Littleborough.
And I felt like twenty at least.
Rankin was fielding at deep long-on,
close to the tent; but they had no one
at square leg, which is my special direc-
tion on my twenty days. Presently the
bowler offered me a full pitch on the
leg side. I timed it successfully, and
had no doubt of having added four to
my score, when, to my astonishment,
I saw a fieldsman running from the
direction of the hedge. The next mo-
ment he had brought off a very credit-
able catch.
It did not dawn on me at first that
this was their eleventh man, arrived at
that moment. When it did, I could not
help laughing to think that he should
imagine he could rush in like that while
his substitute was still fielding. Then
I heard the bowler appeal to the umpire,
and to my horror I heard the umpire
(their umpire) say “Out.”
“But they can't have twelve men
fielding,” I cried. “The substitute is
still there.”
“You’re out, Sir,” said the umpire
haughtily. “The substitoot has already
retired. 'E's standing there watching
the game with 'is 'ands in 'is pockets.”

MY RAT.
HE visits me at least once every day.
His favourite time is the hour of tea,
when the family and staff may be ex-
pected to be at home; but sometimes he
honours us with an additional call at
the luncheon hour. He emerges from
his deep hole beneath an ivy root, takes
the air up and down the paths of my
rockery, glances in at the drawing-room
window, passes on to the back premises,
and so home.
There is nothing furtive about his
movements. His manner is that of one
who has purchased the mansion and its
appurtenances but does not wish to
disturb the sitting tenants. It is his
duty to see that the premises are pro-
perly cared for, but for the present he
has no desire to take possession. It is
beautiful weather and the simple life
out-of-doors contents him.
He is a brown rat. I write of his sex
with confidence because his urbanity
is that of a polished gentleman of the
world; no feminine creature could ever
display it. A female rat who had bought
the house would eagerly try to get in
and drive us forth. But not so my rat.
He discharges the function of a land-
lord as considerately as he can ; after
all, even a landlord must be allowed the
rights of inspection of his own property.
At first I regarded him as merely
an ordinary intrusive brown rat. I
laid down poisonous pills composed of
barium carbonate and flour. He did
not take offence; he understood our
human limitations. He showed by a
jaunty cock of the eye that all to under-
stand is all to pardon. His daily visits
continued without abatement.
It has been suggested to me that we
should await his regular calls with
dogs, blood-thirsty terriers. I cannot
take so scurvy an advantage of his
confidence.
* * +: : ::
I have sinned. The fault is less mine
than that of the High Court of Parlia-
ment. I was bidden to study the
penalties laid down for those who do
not proceed to the destruction of their
rats. When I weighed my landlord rat
against five treasury notes I confess
that in an hour of meanness I per-
mitted the notes to tip the scale. I
prepared phosphor paste and laid a trail
of this loathsome condiment upon the
path trodden every afternoon by my rat.
He came as usual on the day after
that on which I had basely planned his
murder—Heaven forgive me!—that I
might escape a trifling fine, and he
deigned to partake of my hospitality.
Twenty-four hours later, when duty
summoned him once more at the hour
of tea, his eye was dim and he staggered
Jack (to movice in difficulties with the tide). “THE NExT TIME You sportsMEN TAKEs
AN ouTiN' TRY A NUMBER Twº NTY-SEVEN BUs.”
slightly in his gait. He was still able
to go his rounds, but since that tragic
afternoon I have seen him no more.
My family eyes me with suspicion.
They look for the rat, which no longer
arrives at his accustomed hour. My
cook has given notice. I alone bear the
burden of the fatal secret.
× >k :: : >k
Saved ' What care I for five paltry
pounds now that our rat has recovered
from his indisposition and has hastened
to re-visit his property? The phosphor
paste, like arsenic, has added bright-
ness to his eye and brought a beautiful
lustre to his smooth brown coat. He
has softened in his manner and tends
towards friendship. There is less of
the grand air, less assertion of the vast
gap which yawns between the landlord
and the tenant. Presently, if I con-
tinue to prove worthy of his condescen-
sion, my rat will eat phosphor paste
out of my hand.
From the obituary notice of an
octogenarian:-
“He was a keen chronologist, and possessed
a valuable collection of shells.” "

Picked up, no doubt, on the sands of
time.

[JULY 14, 1920,
THE LITTLE HORSE.
[The following fragment is taken from the play, David Lloyd George,
which we understand may some day be produced at the Lyric Opera
House, Hammersmith, as a companion-piece to Abraham Lincoln.]
THE scene is laid in the House of Commons, where Sir
FREDERICK BANBURY has moved the rejection of the Poets
and Verse (Nationalisation) Bill.
Sir FREDERICK BANBURY is speaking.
But it stands to reason,
If you propose to pay them just the same
Whether they write a little or a lot,
They won't write anything. There will not be
Sufficient stimulus. It's human nature,
And human nature is unchangeable.
Do you imagine, Sir, that KEATs or SHELLEY
Would have produced such valuable work,
So large an output, if this precious Bill
Had been in operation at the time?
We should have had no SHAKsp EARE. And, besides,
It means the death of British poetry,
Because we can't continue to compete
With foreign countries.
A Labour Member.
Nor I am not a manufacturer,
- But earned my bread these five-and-forty years,
Sweating and sweating. I know what sweat is . . .
An Hon. Member.
You're not the only person who has sweated.
Labour Member.
At any rate I sweated more than you did.
Mr. SPEAKER.
I do not think these constant interruptions
Are really helping us.
Labour Member. So you may take it
That what I utter is an honest word,
A plain, blunt, honest and straightforward word,
Neither adorned with worthless flummery
And tricks of language—for I have no learning—
Nor yet with false and empty rhetoric
Like lawyers' speeches. I am not a lawyer,
I thank my stars that I am not a lawyer,
And can without a spate of parleying
Briefly expound, as I am doing now,
The whole caboodle. As for this here Bill,
So far as it means Nationalising verse,
We shall support it. On the other hand,
So far as it means interferences
With the free liberty of working-men
To write their poitry when and how they like,
We will not have the Bill. So now you know.
Mr. Asquith.
It was remarked, I think by ARISTOTLE,
That wisdom is not always to the wise;
To which opinion, if we may include
In that august and jealous category -
The President of the Board of Ululation,
I am prepared most freely to subscribe.
When was there ever since the early Forties
A more grotesque and shameless mockery
Of the austere and holy principles
Which Liberalism like an altar-flame
Has guarded through the loose irreverent years
Than this inept, this disingenuous,
This frankly disingenuous attempt
To smuggle past the barrier of this House
An article so plainly contraband
As this unlicens'd and contagious Bill—
I am not a lawyer
Mr.
A Bill which, it is not too much to say,
Insults the conscience of the British Empire?
I will not longer, Sir, detain the House;
Indeed I cannot profitably add
To what I said in 1892.
Speaking at Manchester I used these words:—
“If in the inconstant ferment of their minds
The KING's advisers can indeed discover
No surer ground of principle than this;
If we have here their final contribution
To the most clamant and profound conundrum
Ever proposed for statesmanship to solve,
Then are we watching at the bankruptcy
Of all that wealth of intellect and power
Which has made England great. If that be true
We may put FINIs to our history.
But I for one will never lend my suffrage
To that conclusion.” [An Oration.
DAVID LLoyd GEORGE. Mr. SPEAKER, Sir,
I do not intervene in this discussion
Except to say how much I deprecate
The intemperate tone of many of the speakers—
Especially the Honourable Member
For Allways Dithering—about this Bill,
This tiny Bill, this teeny-weeny Bill.
What is it, after all 2 The merest trifle!
The merest trifle—no, not tipsy-cake—
No trickery in it ! Really one would think
The Government had nothing else to do
But sit and listen to offensive speeches.
How can the horse, the patient horse, go on
If people will keep dragging at the reins?
He has so terrible a load to bear,
And right in front there is a great big hill.
The horse is very tired, and it is raining.
Poor little horse ! But yonder, at the top,
Look, look, there is a rainbow in the sky,
The promise of fair weather, and beyond
There is a splendidly-appointed stable,
With oats and barley, or whatever 'tis
That horses eat, while smiling all around
Stretch out the prairies of Prosperity,
Cornfields and gardens, all that sort of thing.
That's where the horse is going. But, you see,
The horse has got to climb the great big hill
Before he gets there. Oh, you must see that.
Then let us cease this petty bickering;
Let us have no more dragging at the reins.
What is this Bill when all is said and done 2
Surely this House, surely this mighty nation,
Which did so much for horses in the War,
Will not desert this little horse at last
Because of what calumniators say—
Newspaper-owners—I know who they are—
About this Bill! No, no, of course it won't.
We will take heart and gallop up the hill,
We will climb up together to the rainbow;
We will go on to where the rainbow ends—
I know where that is, for I am a Welshman.
It is a field, a lovely little field,
Where there are buttercups and daffodils,
And long rich grass and very shady trees.
Hold on a little, and the horse will get there,
Only, I ask you, let the horse have rein.
That is my message to the British nation:
“Hold on Hold fast! But do not hold too tight !”
[An Ovation. A Division is taken. The Ayes have it.

WORD CHAINS.
Sheila Davies and her brother had
cycled over to play tennis. They sat,
with John and myself, on the steps and
watched the rain falling.
“As a matter of general interest,”
said Arthur Davies to me, “when a
man invites his friends and neighbours
over to play tennis and it pours with
rain all the time, what is the correct
thing for him to do?”
“As a matter of general interest,” I
answered, “the good host will send the
ladies to play the piano, if any, and to
“That's not a bad notion,” said
John, “and then he needn't have a
wash until to-morrow.”
“I suggest,” continued Miss Davies,
“that we play at Word Chains.”
Davies buried his face in his hands
and groaned.
“It sounds fine,” I said gallantly.
“What is it 2 ''
“Well, it's really a sort of mind
exercise. They recommend it in those
courses, you know,” said Miss Davies,
“er—“it stimulates a logical sequence
in reasoning and quickens the mental
processes.’”
“Jolly good, Alan. However did you
guess it? Has he won 2" he asked
Miss Davies.
“Of course not,” said she:
haven't begun yet.”
I sat down again hurriedly.
“Then,” continued Miss Davies, “we
take turns, starting with the word
‘margarine' and making a chain, each
word being connected in some way
with the one before it. And whoever
can get to the word ‘hippopotamus'
first has won.”
“One hippopotamus 2" asked John.
“WON,” said Miss Davies sweetly.
.. We
talk scandal, whether there is
any or not. He will himself con-
duct the men of the party to the
billiard-room or the smoking-
room and offer them cigarettes
and whisky—if any.”
“Ah,” said Davies, “then it
isn't usual just to keep them
sitting miserably on the steps
watching the net float away ?”
John, on whose steps we were
sitting, felt the need of speech.
“I have often wondered,” he
said, turning to Miss Davies,
“how your brother ever got into
such a nice. family as yours.
How do you keep so cheerful
with it always about?”
“One gets used to it in time,”
said Miss Davies.
“I suppose so,” said John.
“After all, we have the same
sort of family disaster in Alan,
but we manage to bear up.”
Davies rose.
“You and I don't seem popular
here,” he said to me. “Will you
conduct me to the billiard-room
or the smoking-room 2 I am in
need of a wash.”
“As a matter of general inter-
est,” said John to Miss Davies,
“is it the correct thing to wash
before setting out to visit friends,
or can it be left until some hours
after arrival?”
THE NEW RIVER “BELLE.” -
Society Gossip Note. “I also saw the Honourable Pamela
Puntah, attended by a gorgeous creation in tangerine orange
and cornflower blue, with hat and handkerchief to match.”
[It was remarked that at Henley the men's river attire
quite outshone the ladies'.]
Her brother groaned again.
“I'll just give you an easy
example," went on Miss Davies
enthusiastically, “and then we'll
begin. Take the words fire'
and “nigger.' A good chain would
be ‘fire—coal—black—nigger.’
Do you see?”
John and I made sounds ex-
pressing that we thought we did.
Davies just went on groaning.
“Very well,” said Miss Davies,
“we'll begin. Now don't forget.
We start with ‘margarine' and
try to get to ‘hippopotamus.’
The great thing is to keep the
word ‘hippopotamus' in your
mind all the time and keep try-
ing to work towards it. Are you
ready ? Right ! I'll start with
‘grease.’”
“Greece?” said John, looking
startled.
“Yes, margarine — grease,”
explained Miss Davies.
“Oh, I see,” said John, “er—
oil.”
I thought seriously for a mo-
ment.
“Salad,” I said, looking round
for approval.
“Splendid,” said Miss Davies.
“Now you, Arthur.”
“I refuse— Oh, all right,”
he said. “Where have we —
‘salad '—er—' lobster.'”
Miss Davies sighed heavily.
“If you two are going to sit here
thinking of clever remarks to make
about each other I shall go home. For
goodness' sake let's pretend we are
enjoying ourselves.”
“I am enjoying myself,” said John
plaintively; “I’ve been wanting to say
what I really think of your brother for
years.”
“Well, don't do it now. Things are
miserable enough without having dis-
cussions on Arthur. Let's all have a
game at something, shall we ?”
“Splendid idea,” said her brother.
“What about tennis 2'"
“We might get into bathing togs and
play polo,” I suggested.
“Is that what they say about it 2"
asked John fearfully.
“But it makes a splendid game,”
added Miss Davies eagerly. “Let me
explain it to you and you'll see. First
of all we think of a word, such as–
er—“margarine.’”
“Why?” asked John.
“It's part of the game, of course,”
said Miss Davies indignantly.
“Oh, I see—of course. How stupid
of me !” said John.
“Then we think of another word
quite different, such as n >
“‘Hippopotamus,' " I suggested.
“That's right,” said Miss Davies.
I stood up and bowed.
“Well, I'm hanged ' " said John.
Do you catch the idea, as it were 2
We seemed to fall into the way of it
in a moment. Once we had tried
we progressed at a tremendous rate.
Perhaps we are all very clever, or
perhaps it was really easier than it
seems in the telling, but looking back
the conversation seems to have been
simply brilliant.
Well, here's an idea of how we went
on, anyway, and you can judge for your-
selves (Davies, you remember, has just
snapped out “Lobster"):—
Miss Davies (quick as lightning).

this.)

and surprises, excitements and joys. The Fund (the Hon.
Treasurer of which is the Earl of ARRAN, 18, Buckingham
Street, Strand, London) must not now be restricted because
lodgings and railway fares are dearer. Last year the sum
asked for each child was just half what is now required;
but the increase is necessary. Yet even with the increase
it is not great, considering the good that it can do | In

ES S E N C E O F P A R L | A M E N T.
Monday, July 5th.-When the Ger-
mans left Peking after the Boxer Re-
bellion they took with them the astro-
nomical instruments which had hung
for centuries on its walls. How the
Celestial equivalent of Old Moore has
managed to translate the message of the
stars without their assistance I cannot
imagine; but the Chinese Government
does not appear to be worrying, for,
though it was specifically provided at
“A GENEROUS TEAPOT.”
CoLONEL WEDGwood.
Versailles that the instruments should
be returned, China has omitted to sign
the Peace Treaty.
There are the makings of a great
statesman in Sir John REES. Some
apprehension having been expressed
lest France should prohibit the im-
portation of silk mourning crêpe and
so injure an old British industry, he was
quick to suggest a remedy. “Would it
not be possible,” he asked in his most
insinuating tones, “to have a deal be-
tween silk and champagne 2 " And the
House, which is not yet entirely com-
posed of “Pussyfeet,” gave him an
approving cheer.
A certain General GoLovin having
published statements reflecting on Mr.
CHURCHILL's conduct of the campaign
in North Russia last year, that section
of the House which is always ready to
take the word of any foreigner as against
that of any Englishman, particularly
of any English Minister, at once as-
sumed that the charges were correct.
The SECRETARY OF STATE For WAR was
in his place, with the light of battle in
his eye, ready to meet his enemies in
the gate. But by the time Mr. BonAR
LAW had done with them there was
not much left of the charges. So far
as the statements were true, he said,
they merely repeated what was already
familiar to the House. Everybody
knew that the Government was help-
ing the anti-Bolshevik forces last year.
But the story that Mr. CHURCHILL had
taken his orders from Admiral Kolt-
CHAK was both untrue and absurd.
He had simply carried out the policy
of the Government, a policy which,
though some hon. Members did not
seem to appreciate it, had now been
altered. "
Committee on the Finance Bill saw
the annual assault on the tea duty.
“We are going to drop this duty directly
we are in a position to do so,” said Com-
mander KEN worTHY, with his eye on
the Treasury Bench. “Who are we?”
shouted the Coalitionists; and it pre-
sently appeared that “we” did not in-
clude Sir DonALD MACLEAN, but did
include Colonel WEDGwood, who, as
becomes one of his name, was all for a
generous tea-pot.
Undeterred by his failure over tea,
Commander KEN worTHY next attacked
the duty on films, complaining inter
alia, “Mr. CHAPLIN is taxed twenty
pounds for every thousand feet.” Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN defended the tax on gen-
eral grounds, but wisely avoided Mr.
CHAPLIN's feet, over which it is notori-
ously easy to trip.
The debate on the beer duty shattered
one more illusion. It is an article of
faith with the “Wee Frees '' that Sir
GEORGE YoUNGER is the power behind
the scenes, and that Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
is a mere marionette, who only exists to
do his bidding. Yet here was the auto-
crat confessing, qué brewer, that the
latest addition to the beer duty was the
biggest surprise of his life.
Tuesday, July 6th.-The LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR's request for leave of absence in
order that he might attend the Spa
Conference was granted. Lord CREwe's
remark, that it was “a matter of regret
that the Government had to depend
upon the noble and learned lord for
legal assistance,” might perhaps have
been less ambiguously worded. At any
rate Lord BIRKENHEAD thought it neces-
sary to allay any possible apprehensions
by adding that he would be accom-
panied by the ATToRNEY-GENERAL.
The gist of Mr. CHURCHILL's compre-
hensive reply to allegations of waste at
Chilwell was that there were not enough
sheds to cover all the stores, and that
to build additional accommodation
would cost more than it would save.
There was a pleasant Hibernian flavour
about his admission that the goods, “if
they remained in their present condition,
would, of course, deteriorate.”
Who says that D.O.R.A. has out-
lived her usefulness? The HoME SECRE-
TARY announced that the sale of choco-
lates in theatres is still verboten, so
the frugal swain, whose “best girl"
has a healthy appetite, may breathe
again.
Mr. CLYNES, usually so cautious, was
in a reckless mood. First he tried to
move the adjournment over the GoLo-
VIN revelations, and was informed b
the SPEAKER that a report of doubtful

Next, on the Finance Bill, he shocked
his temperance colleagues by boldly
demanding cheaper beer. But, although
he received the powerful support of
Admiral Sir R. HALL, he failed to soften
the heart of the CHANCELLOR, who de-
clared that he must have his increased
revenue, and that the beer-drinker must
pay his share of it.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN turned a more
sympathetic ear to the bark of another
sea-dog, Admiral ADAIR, who sought a
reduction of the tax on champagne, and
mentioned the horrifying fact that even
City Companies were abandoning its

Member that this was becoming “a rich
man's Budget from top to bottom.”
Wednesday, July 7th.-Never was
Lord HALDANE's power of clear think-
ing employed to better advantage than
in his lucid exposition of the Duplicands
and Feu-duties (Scotland) Bill. I would
not like to assert positively that all the
Peers present fully grasped the mo-
mentous fact that a duplicand was a
“casualty” and might be sometimes
twice the feu-duty and sometimes three
times that amount; but they under-
stood enough to agree that it was a
very fearful wild-fowl and ought to be
restrained by law.
After this piquant hors-d'auvre they
settled down to a solid joint of national
finance, laid before them by Lord MIDLE-
ToN. I am afraid they would have
found it rather indigestible but for the
sauce provided by Lord INCHCAPE, who
was positively skittish in his comments
upon the extravagance of the Govern-
ment, and on one occasion even in-
dulged in a pun. In his view the
Ministry of Transport was an entirely
superfluous creation, solely arising out
of the supposed necessity of finding a
new job for Sir ERIC GEDDEs. I sup-
pose the PRIME MINISTER said, “Here's
a square peg, look you ; let us dig a
hole round it.”
The Lord CHANCELLOR's reply was
vigorous but not altogether convincing.
His description of the Government as
a body of harassed and anxious econo-
mists did not altogether tally with his
subsequent picture of the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER “always resisting
proposals for expenditure made by his
colleagues in the Cabinet.” Despite
his eloquence the Peers passed Lord
MIDLEToN's motion by 95 votes to 23.
The Commons made good progress
with the Finance Bill, though there was
a good deal of justifiable criticism of its
phraseology. The SECRETARY of THE
TREASURY admitted that there was one
clause of which he did not understand
a word, but wisely refused to specify
it. Colonel WEDGwood advanced the
remarkable proposition that “the work-
ers in the long run pay all the taxes,”
but did not jump at Captain ELLIOTT's
suggestion that in that case it would
save trouble if the CHANCELLoR were to
levy all the taxes on the working-classes
direct. When asked to extend further
relief to charities Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
sought a definition of “charity.” Would
it apply, for example, to “the association
of a small number of gentlemen in dis-
tress obeying the law of self-preserva-
tion in the face of world-forces which
threaten to sweep them out of exist-
ence” 2 I seem to hear Mr. Wilkins
Micawber reply, “The answer is in the
affirmative.”
Thursday, July 8th.-In the absence
of the LoBD CHANCELLOR the Gas
Regulation Bill was entrusted to the
UNDER - SECRETARY For AIR. The
mingling of gas and air has before now
been known to produce an explosion,

threatened that there would be a general
strike of Members of Parliament unless
their salaries were increased; but Mr.
BonAR LAw seemed to be more amused
than alarmed at the prospect. The
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER was
asked point-blank whether he was
satisfied with the reduction in the
bureaucracy during the last six months,
and replied that he was not, and had
therefore appointed Committees to in-
vestigate the staffs in seven of the
Departments. The number is unfortu-
nately suggestive.

If an unnecessary amount of heat
was engendered by the debate on
General DYER's case the fault must be
partly attributed to the INDIAN SECRE-
TARY's opening speech. “Come, Mon-
tagu, for thou art early up " is a line
from one of the most poignant scenes
in SHAKSPEARE; but early rising, at
Westminster as elsewhere, is not always
conducive to good temper.

ious, and Mr. BonAR LAw did his level
best to keep his followers in the Gov-
ernment Lobby. But Sir A. HUNTER-
WESTON's reminder that by the instruc-
tions issued by the civil authority to
General DYER he was ordered “to use
all force necessary. No gathering of
persons nor procession of any sort will
be allowed. All gatherings will be fired
on,” confirmed them in the view that
the GENERAL was being made a scape-
goat. No fewer than 129 voted against
the Government, whose majority would
have been very minute but for the
assistance of its usual foes, the “Wee
Frees" and Labourites.

A RETURNING circumnavigator re-
ports that the passengers on the boat
—a Japanese liner—coming from Yoko-
hama to Honolulu were apprised of the
fact that they were to have two Thurs-
days, one immediately following the
other (and you can have no notion
how long a second Thursday can be),
owing to the crossing of the imaginary
but very boring line which divides the
two hemispheres. The official notice
came from the captain's own hand.
The ship had an American purser and
an American chief steward, and there
were many English on board, but the
gallant little commander preferred to
tackle the linguistic problem unaided.
On Wednesday, therefore, the board
had this announcement pinned to it:—
“As she will be crossed the meridian
of 180 to-morrow, so to-morrow again.”
Could, after the first blow, anything
be clearer?
Meanwhile from Siam come the glad
tidings that the British residents in
Bangkok are to have a new paper.

“HULLOA, Melhuish,” I said, “after
all you had ideal weather for your Mid-
summer Night's Dream yesterday."
“Ideal,” said Melhuish moodily.
“Really, if you'd picked the day it
couldn't have been better. You want
peculiar atmospheric conditions for a
pastoral, don't you? Just enough sun,
not too much wind, temperature con-
genial for sitting out-of-doors. You had

Melhuish nodded.
“Your garden must be looking like
fairyland too now with the roses out
and the trees in all their full summer
greenery.”
He nodded again.
mer began in real earnest. We got in
extra gardeners, worked like niggers
ourselves, and when the turf was in per-
fect condition and the thyme was
coming up on Titania's bank we fixed
the date and billed the county.
“After that we all got nervous and
went about consulting weather fore-
casts. Old Moore prophesied heavy
rains. The Daily Mail said a cyclone
from New York was on the way. The
weather - glasses jumped about and
seemed to know their own minds even
less than usual. Three days before the
date thunderstorms were reported all
over the country and a fowl was struck
by lightning. But not a drop of rain
came to our village.
“At the dress-rehearsal the night

of rain. They're the only arrange-

it's going to be a nightmare instead of
a dream if they have to be carried out.

make a wise decision. He'll notify us
and the boy - scouts will notify the
audience. All we've got to do is not
to grouse.'
“Cocklewhite said he would phone
me the position of his leech at 9 A.M.,
and Lysander promised to report any
change in the condition of the seaweed.
I set our glass and Titania and I got
up at half-hour intervals during the
night and tapped it. It refused to budge
either way.

I sighed regretfully.

looked so awfully like

Melhuish suddenly
got excited. “Looked

It rained several drops.

At breakfast Cockle-

leech was dead, and he
had strong suspicions
it had died from atmo-
spheric pressure. Al-
most at the same
moment Lysander sent
word that his seaweed
had gone clammy dur-
ing the night. Half-
an-hour later came a
clap of thunder and the
drops of rain I men-
tioned. I needn't go
on. You can guess the
rest.”
Melhuish paused.
“But the perform-
ance came off, didn't
it?” I said,
“Yes, in the Parish
huish as Titania in the most idyllic
surroundings I can imagine.”
“You wouldn't have seen us in an
idyllic surroundings,” said Melhuish.
He had relapsed into moodiness again.
I could see there was something serious.
“What happened, old friend?" I said
gently.
“We began rehearsing during that
glorious spell of sunshine in the spring,
when the garden was a carpet of daffo-
dils and it was a sheer joy to play about
out-of-doors. Then the weather broke
for a time and we migrated to the Parish
Hall. You know our Parish Hall ?”
“Quite well. A little tin place on the
left from the rectory.”
“That's it. It's got a platform on
trestles at one end and a paraffin lamp
in the middle. The Vicar placed it at
our disposal when there wasn't a
Women's Institute or a choir practice,
and on chilly nights he had the ‘Bea-
trice stove' lit for us. Then the Sum-
before the performance we debated the
weather prospects until the moon rose.
Lysander said his bit of seaweed which
he brought from Bognor was as dry as
parched peas and he would back it
against any fool barometer. Cockle-
white, our prompter, said he didn't want
to depress the company, but he had a
leech in a bottle of water which rose for
fine weather and sank for wet, and he
was bound to tell us it was like lead
at the bottom at the present moment.
Hermia pointed to the heavens, ‘Red
sky at night shepherds' delight,' she
quoted. There was no getting away
from the swallows; they were nose-
diving to a bird. ‘Hang swallows,'
Oberon said; “put your trust in mos-

Fair Skipper. “WIND GETTIN' Up NicELY—what?”
HARDING AND COX.
(Being an inquiry into the two Candidates for the
Presidency of the United States of America.)
I wish I knew some facts regarding
The private life of Mr. HARDING;
I wish that I had simply stocks
Of anecdotes of Mr. Cox.
In U.S.A. (where both are resident
And each one hoping to be President)
Their favourite hymns, their size in boots,
Their views on liquor and cheroots
Are known to all; not JULIUS CAESAR
Is quite so much renowned as these are.
In England, where they do not dwell,
No one appears to know them well.
One cannot say if Cox's liver
Keeps well upon the Swanee River,
Nor whether HARDING finds, when glum,
Any relief in chewing gum.
It may be that they both have good rows
Of dental ornaments like Woodrow’s,
The waist of TAFT, the Roosevelt eye
For pinking hippopotami.
It may be HARDING had some flickers
Of CLEvel,AND's spirit whilst in knickers,
And Cox while yet a puling babe
Dreamed tiny dreams of LINcolN (ABE);
And both, although they knew they'd catch it,
Cut fruit-trees with a little hatchet:
Both may have been, when glorious youths,
Too proud to fight or tell untruths.
I cannot say. I know they wrangle
On points I dare not disentangle,
That one of them 's a Democrat
And t'other's not. And that is that. Evoe.

moment advertising the most undesirable article in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A STORY ABOUT A CLOCK.
OUR move-in took place in no furtive
or clandestine fashion; our installation
of ourselves in our semi-detached was
performed well under the eye of the
neighbouring public. Our furniture
waited on the public thoroughfare until
our new home was ready to receive it.
Small children played games on our
sofa; enthusiastic acquaintances played
tunes on our piano. In a word, our
move-in was a local festival; everyone
took part. This is the sad tale of the
man who took the most expensive part
—the clock.
If the hard choice had been put to
Diana, my wife, to say which she could
least sorrowfully part with, me or the
clock, the clock would have stayed. If
I had been put to the same dismal
alternative as to Diana or the clock,
Diana would have gone. In fact, directly
the clock was safely in Diana had gone
out. That was all she cared about ;
small children might play on the sofa,
enthusiastic acquaintances might play
on the piano, and I might toil unremit-
tingly with everything else, for all Diana
cared. So, the clock being in, out she
went upon her lawful or unlawful pur-
poses. As she departed she said some-
thing about my seeing to the clock.
I remembered that later on, but I re-
membered it wrong. This is how I
did it.
The man sat a little on my own
special chair (at that time on the pave-
ment) before he came in. I asked him
what he was sitting there for. He got
up and came inside. Then I asked him
what he had come in for, and he
said, “The clock.” I looked at the
clock and it had stopped. I gave it a
shake, and it still stopped. He said it
was no good shaking it; that only an-
noyed it. He said he had come to look
after it. He then took off his hat and his
coat, moved the fingers about, put his
ears to it to hear its heart beating, and
asked me what I had been doing to it.
I said I hadn't been doing anything
to it; he watched me doing things
to everything else, and adopted an ex-
pression as if to say he didn't believe
me. He gave me the feeling that I was
a very interfering person, and that he
didn't want to have anything more to
do with me. He said he should have
to take the clock away. I asked him
when he would bring it back. He said
he didn't know. He appeared to take
a pessimistic view of it. I asked him
cheerfully if he would ever bring it
back. He gave me a contemptuous
look and, without another word, went,
taking the clock with him.
When Diana came back she asked
where the clock was. I said it had
gone. “Gone where?" asked Diana.
I said I didn't know; the man had
taken it. “What man 2" asked Diana.
I was trying to move the sofa at the
moment and I was inclined to be short-
spoken. I said that the man who had
taken it was, no doubt, the man whom
Diana had gone forth to find and bid
take away our clock. Diana said that,
if the man had said that she had said
that he might take our clock away,
the man was a liar. Had the man said
that she had said he might take the
clock away? The answer was in the
negative.
Then the truth emerged. The man
had stolen our clock. I had assisted the
man to steal our clock, helping him to
lift it off its perch and handing him
his bowler hat as he left.
It all sounds incredible, doesn't it 2
But you will admit, I am sure, that it
is a thing which could quite easily hap-
pen to anyone. Isn't it?
To be quite frank, I have improved
the story a bit. The clock wasn't
really stolen.
Was the man really taking it away to
repair it? No; to tell you the truth
he didn't actually take it away at all.
In fact, I might as well own that no
man ever came into the house while I
was shifting the furniture in from the
street. And, if you want to know, I
never had a clock . . . nor a wife . . .
nor a house. -
The mere fact of my pretending that
there are such things as semi-detacheds
for people to move into these days
ought to have put you wise from the
start that the whole tale was a fabri-
cation. —
CURES WORTH MAKING.
(By our Medical Expert.)
The Times, in its daily summary of
“News in Advertisements" recently
called attention to the appeal of an
invalided officer who “will be glad to
give a hundred pounds to any doctor,
nerve specialist or hospital that can
cure him of occupation neurosis and
writer's cramp.” A careful study of
other newspapers shows that offers of
handsome remuneration for cures are
not confined to those who have suf-
fered from the War, but are made by
civilians and officials of the highest
position in public life. We append a
few outstanding examples of the splen-
did opportunities now provided to
psycho-pathological specialists —
A Cabinet Minister of massive phy-
sique, perfect self-confidence and im-
movable determination, who has had
varied experience in different business
callings and (up to a certain point) un-
varying success, offers five thousand
pounds to any professor of deportment
or member of the Old Nobility in re-
duced circumstances who will impart
to him suavity of manner, tact and
diplomatic courtesy, the lack of which
constitutes the sole obstacle to his
achieving immortality. If the instructor
can succeed in making him (the Cabinet
Minister) really beloved the honorarium
will be doubled.
An Editor of thirty years' experience
as a journalist, first-rate linguist, deeply
versed in geography, Central European
politics, etc., will give five hundred
pounds to any mental specialist, regis-
tered or unregistered, who will cure
him of an irresistible temptation on
all occasions, with or without provoca-
tion, to utilise every incident, occur-
rence, calamity or disaster as a means
of assailing and undermining the posi-
tion of the Coalition Government in
general and the PRIME MINISTER in
particular.
A Member of Parliament, formerly
attached to one of His Majesty's ser-
vices, is prepared to offer fifty pounds
to any phrenologist who without in-
flicting undue pain will reduce or re-
move the Bump of Curiosity which at
present impels him without rhyme or
reason to bombard Ministers with irre-
levant questions contrary to the public
interest and calculated to produce the
maximum amount of irritation even
amongst Members who sit on the same
side of the House.
A Peer of great wealth, striking
physiognomy, affectionate disposition
and wonderful general knowledge will
pay the sum of twenty thousand pounds
to any psychiatric practitioner who
succeeds in eliminating from his system
the microbe of filmolatry, the ravages
of which have latterly threatened to
infect his monumental mind with his-
trionic monomania highly deleterious
to the best interests of the community.
A neo-Georgian poet, disciple of
FREUD, pacificist and vegetarian, will
gladly pay five pounds to any psycho-
pathic suggestionist who will extirpate
from his subconsciousness the lingering
relics of an antipathy to syncopated
rhythms which retard his progress to-
wards a complete mastery of the tech-
nique of amorphous bombination.
Another “Substitute.”
“For the first time on record snow has
fallen at Albany, Western Australia.
The Food Ministry announces that this sur-
plus will therefore be available for home jam-
making.”—Provincial Paper.
“The Roman poets, all of them inveterate
Cockneys, talk of the joys of the country, of
purling streams and lowing kine and frisking
lamps.”—Weekly Paper.
And their verses occasionally smell of
them.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Rescue (DENT) is a story in the authentic manner of Mr.
Joseph CoNRAD at his unapproachable best. If it is true,
as one has heard, that the book was begun twenty-five
years ago and resumed lately, this explains but does nothing
to minimize a fact upon which we can all congratulate our-
selves. The setting is the shallow seas of the Malay coast,
where Lingard, an adventurer (most typically CoNRAD)
whose passion in life is love for his brig, has pledged him-
self to aid an exiled young Rajah in the recovery of his
rights. At the last moment however, when his plans are
at point of action, the whole scheme is thwarted by the
stranding of a private yacht º certain persons
whose rescue (complicated by his sudden subjection to the
woman of the party) eventually involves Lingard in the loss
of fortune and credit. Perhaps you can suppose what Mr.
CoNRAD makes of a theme so congenial; how the tale moves
under his hand in what was once well called that “smoky
magnificence” of atmosphere, just permitting the reader to
observe at any moment so much and no more of its direction.
Of the style it would now be superfluous to speak. It has
been given to Mr. ConBAD, working in what is originally a
foreign medium, to use it with a dignity unsurpassed by
any of our native craftsmen. Such phrases as (of the pru-
dent mate remonstrating with Lingard): “What he really
wanted was to have his existence left intact, for his own
cherishing and pride; ” or again, “The situation was too
complicated to be entrusted to a cynical or shameless
hope,” give one the quick pleasure of words so delicately
and deftly used as to seem newly coined. Rescue, in short,
is probably the greatest novel of the year, one by which
its author has again enriched our literature with work of
profound and moving quality.
I was inclined to flatter myself that nothing in the plot
of The Silver Tea-shop (STANLEY PAUL) could possibly take
me by surprise, but I found towards the end that Miss
E. EveRETT GREEN had contrived to slip in the real villain all
unsuspected while I, as she meant me to, was staring hard
at the supposed one, so that there I must acknowledge myself
defeated. With a stolen invention, an old gentleman found
shot in his room, and a son under a vow to avenge his
father, the story provides plenty of thrills, and the “Silver
Tea-shop” itself has the fascination that business ventures
in books often exercise. It seems to be run on such lavish
lines for the prices charged that I found myself looking
hungrily for its address. I wish the author had not re-
ferred to her hero as having “mobile digits” and burdened
her ingenuous story with anything so important as a pro-
logue. By making the villain's deserted offspring not one
baby girl only, or even twins, but triplets, Miss EveRETT
GREEN provides waitresses all of one family for the “Silver
Tea-shop,” and that, though a happy arrangement, is a little
too uncommon to add to the likelihood of an unconvincing tale.
When a book is succinctly labelled Love Stories (DoRAN),
at least no one has any right to complain that he wasn't
warned beforehand of the character of its contents. As a
matter of fact, human nature being what it is, I have little
doubt that Mrs. MARY Roberts RINEHART has hit upon a
distinctly profitable title. Indeed I believe that this has
already been proved in the Land of Freedom, from which the
work comes to us, where (I am given to understand) the
vogue of sentimental fiction is even greater than with our-

selves. What the name does nothing to indicate is that the
stories are almost all of them laid in or about hospital wards.
For some, perhaps most, of the author's admirers this may
serve only to increase the charm; for others, who prefer
their romance unflavoured with iodoform, not. Undeniable
that she has a smiling way with her, and a gift of sympa-
thetic enjoyment that carries off the old, old dialogues, even
imparting freshness to the tale of the patient in extremis
who persuades his attractive nurse into a death-bed mar- |
riage, treatment that the slightest experience of fiction
should have warned her to be invariably curative. Perhaps
the best of the tales is “Jane,” which tells very amusingly
the results of a hospital strike that in actual life would, I
imagine, have provided little humorous relief. By this time
you may have gathered that what matters about Mrs.
RINEHART is not what she says but the way that she says it ;
upon which hint you can act as fancy dictates.
I very distinctly feel that “KATHARINETYNAN" could have
made a first-rate novel of Denys the Dreamer (CoLLINs) and
labour, but here it is perhaps out of place. His Mr. Tre-
venna, the mystical parson, friend of smugglers and of
everyone who suffered from laws (unrighteous or righteous),
is a great figure; and I shall not soon forget either his
correspondence with Lady Evangeline Walrond or his super.
human kindliness of heart. If you want to get at the true
flavour of Cornwall you have only to open The North Door.
A young clerk in an insurance office, who wanted to go as
a missionary to India, is the hero, if there is one, of Mrs.
ALICE PERRIN's latest novel, The Vow of Silence (CAsselſ).
I have never read a book about India which made such an
ambition seem more courageous, for it gives such a hot and
thirsty picture of that country when Harold Williams
at last reaches it that it is positively uncomfortable to
read it in Summer weather. Harold and his brother and
sistermissionaries live in a state of stuffy discomfort which
soon undermines his health and leaves him no defence
against the charms of Elaine Taverner, who has a
large cool drawing-room and dainty frocks, and a young
soldier lover and an old scholar husband, and all the other
have had plenty over for a good second if she had taken the
trouble. But her fluent -
pen runs away with
her down paths that
lead nowhere in parti-
cular, instead of de-
veloping her main
characters and situa-
tions to an intelligible
and satisfactory point.
Denys is of a gentle
Irish family that has
come down to very
small farming. He

from afar), and of a
great port that is to rival Belfast. Unexpected, not to say
incredible, assistance comes from a Jew money-lender and
his wife. The portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Aarons are the
best things in the book, and I hope Mrs. IIINKSoN will
make a novel about these two admirable people some day
soon. Denys makes his own and his patron's fortune and
I am sure lives happily ever after with Dawn, who is the
palest wraith of a girl, owing to the shameful neglect of her
author, who is too busy putting large sums of money into
the pockets of the principal puppets. Indeed, for a West
Coast of Ireland story a demoralising amount of money
is going about.
The principal scenes of The North Door (CoNSTABLE) are
laid in the Cornwall of some hundred-and-thirty years ago,
and I welcome Dr. GREVILLE MACDoNALD as an expert in
the Copnish language and character. Cornwall, as all
readers of fiction know, has during the last few years been
attacked again and again by novelists, and most of them
would do well to study Dr. MACDONALD's romance and most
thoroughly to digest it. In form, however, he will have
little to teach them, for his book is very indifferently con-
structed. It may seem ungrateful in these rather skimpy
days to complain of a surfeit of matter, but there is stuff
in this book for two if not three novels. One cannot blame
Dr. MAcDoNALD for his indignation at the miseries of child-
story—in some hands
it might have been a great one; as it is, Mrs. PERRIN
seems for once to have missed her opportunity.
If the publisher of About It And About had told me on
the wrapper that Mr. D. WILLOUGHBY has an excellent
fund of literary reminiscence, on which he draws for the
modelling of a very pretty epigrammatical style, I should,
after reading the book, have agreed with him heartily.
What Mr. T. FISHER UNw1N does say about these short
essays, which embrace most of the subjects on which people
have violent opinions, is that the author's “point of view
is that of the natural historian making an unprejudiced
examination.” An unprejudiced man, I take it, is a man
whose sentiments are the same as mine, and I happen to
disagree with Mr. WILLough BY as profoundly as possible on
several of the themes he has chosen. On fox-hunting, for
instance, which he considers a more decadent sport than
bull-fighting; and on Ulster, which he attacks bitterly by
comparison with the rest of Ireland, for cherishing anti-
quated political animosities and talking about the Battle of
the Boyne. But will Mr. WILLoughby not have been hear-
ing of “the curse of CROMwFLL"? Let us rather agree to
be impatient with Yorkshire for her absurd tranquillity
with regard to WILLIAM THE FIRST. I repeat that Mr.
WILLough BY has a very clever style, but, bless his heart,
he is as bigoted as I am myself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 21, 1920,
THE GRASSHOPPER.
Th; Animal Kingdom may be divided
into creatures which one can feed
and creatures which one camot feed.
Animals which one cannot feed are
nearly always unsatisfactory; and the
grasshopper is no exception. Anyone
who has tried feeding a grasshopper
will agree with me. -
Yet he is one of the most interesting
of British creatures. The Encyclopædia
Britannica is as terse and simple as
ever about him. “Grasshoppers,” it says,
“are specially remarkable for their sal-
tatory powers, due to the great develop-
ment of the hind legs; and also for their
stridulation, which is not always an
attribute of the male only.” To trans-
late, grasshoppers have a habit of
hopping (“saltatory powers”) and
chirping (“stridulation").
It is commonly supposed that the
grasshopper stridulates by rubbing his
back legs together; but this is not the
case. For one thing I have tried it
myself and failed to make any kind of
noise; and for another, after exhaustive
observations, I have established the
fact that, though he does move his back
legs every time he stridulates, his back
legs do not touch each other. Now it is
a law of friction that you cannot have
friction between two back legs if the
back legs are not touching; in other
words the grasshopper does not rub
his back legs together to produce strid-
ulation, or, to put it quite shortly, he
does not rub his back legs together
at all. I hope I have made this point
quite clear. If not, a more detailed treat-
ment will be found in the Paper which
I read to the Royal Society in 1912.
Nevertheless I have always felt that
there was something fishy about the
grasshopper's back legs. I mean, why
should he wave his back legs about
when he is stridulating 2 My own
theory is that it is purely due to the
nervous excitement produced by the
act of singing. The same phenomenon
can be observed in many singers and
public speakers. I do not think my-
self that we need seek for a more
elaborate hypothesis. The Encyclo-
paedia Britannica, of course, says that
“the stridulation or song in the Acri-
diidae is produced by friction of the
hind legs against portions of the wings
or wing-covers,” but that is just the sort
of statement which the scientific man
thinks he can pass off on the public
with impunity. Considering that stri-
dulation takes place about every ten
seconds, I calculate that the grass-
hopper must require a new set of wings
every ten days. It would be more in
keeping with the traditions of our
public life if the scientific man simply
confessed that he was baffled by this
problem of the grasshopper's back legs.
Yet, as I have said, if a public speaker
may fidget with his back legs while he
is stridulating, why not a public grass-
hopper ? The more I see of science
the more it strikes me as one large
mystification.
But I ought to have mentioned that
“the Acridiidae have the auditory
organs on the first abdominal segment,”
while “the Locustidae have the auditory
organ on the tibia of the first leg.” In
other words one kind of grasshopper
hears with its stomach and the other
kind listens with its leg. When a scien-
tific man has committed himself to that
kind of statement he would hardly have
qualms about a little invention like the
back-legs legend.
With this scientific preliminary we
now come to the really intriguing part
of our subject, and that is the place of
the grasshopper in modern politics.
And the first question is, Why did Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE call Lord NorthcLIFFE
a grasshopper ? I think it was in a
speech about Russia that Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE said, in terms, that Lord
NoFTHCLIFFE was a grasshopper. And
he didn't leave it at that. He said that
Lord NonTHCLIFFE was not only a
grasshopper but a something something
grasshopper, grasshopping here and
grasshopping there—that sort of thing.
There was nothing much in the accusa-
tion, of course, and Lord NorthcLIFFE
made no reply at the time; in fact, so
far as I know, he has never publicly
stated that he is not a grasshopper;
for all we know it may be true. But
I know a man whose wife's sister
was in service at a place where there
was a kitchen - maid whose young
man was once a gardener at Lord
North CLIFFE's, and this man told me
—the first man, I mean—that Lord
NorthCLIFFE took it to heart terribly.
No grasshoppers were allowed in the
garden from that day forth ; no green
that was at all like grasshopper-green
was tolerated in the house, and the
gardener used to come upon his Lord-
ship muttering in the West Walk: “A
grasshopper! He called me a grass-
hopper—ME—a GRASSHOPPER ' " The
gardener said that his Lordship used to
finish up with, “I’ll teach him; ” but
that is hardly the kind of thing a lord
would say, and I don't believe it. In
fact I don't believe any of it. It is a
stupid story.
But this crisis we keep having with
France owing to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's
infamous conduct does make the story
interesting. The suggestion is, you see,
that Lord NoFTHCLIFFElaylow for along
time, till everybody had forgotten about
the grasshopper and Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
thought that Lord NorthcLIFFE had
forgotten about the grasshopper, and
then, when Mr. LLoyd GEoRGE was in
a hole, Lord NorthcLIFFE said, “Now
we'll see if I am a grasshopper or not,”
and started stridulating at high speed
about Mr. LLOYD GEoRGE. A crude
suggestion. But if it were true it would
mean that the grasshopper had become
a figure of national and international
importance. It is wonderful to think
that we might stop being friends with
France just because of a grasshopper;
and, if Lord NorthcLIFFE arranged for
a new Government to come in, it might
very well be called “The Grasshopper
Government.” That would look fine in
the margins of the history-books.
Yes, it is all very “dramatic.” It is
exciting to think of an English lord
nursing a grievance about a grasshopper
for months and months, seeing grass-
hoppers in every corner, dreaming about
grasshoppers . . . But we must not
waste time over the fantastic tale. We
have not yet solved our principal prob-
lem. Why did Mr. LLoyd GEorge call
him a grasshopper—a modest friendly
little grasshopper? Did he mean to
suggest that Lord NorthCLIFFE hears
with his stomach or stridulates with
his back legs?
Why not an earwig, or a black-beetle,
or a wood-louse, or a centipede 2 There
are lots of insects more offensive than
the grasshopper, and personally I would
much rather be called a grasshopper
than an earwig, which gets into people's
sponges and frightens them to death.
Perhaps he had been reading that nice
passage in the Prophet NAHUM : “Thy
captains are as the great grasshoppers,
which camp in the hedges in the cold
day, but when the sun ariseth they flee
away, and their place is not known
where they are.” I do not know. But
The Encyclopædia has a suggestive
sentence: “All grasshoppers are veget-
able feeders and have an incomplete
metamorphosis, so that their destruc-
tive powers are continuous from the
moment of emergence from the egg until
death.” A. P. H.

“FRENCH LEAVE.”
THE Mandarins of the Theatre, who
are no wiser than other mandarins (on
the contrary), have been long repeating
the formula that the public won't look
at a War play. If I'm not mistaken
it will for many moons be looking at
Captain REGINALD BERRELEY's French
Leave. He labels it a “light comedy.”
That's an understatement. It is, as a
matter of fact, a very skilful, uproarious
and plausible farce, almost too suc-
cessful in that you can't hear one-third
of the jokes because of the laughter at
the other two-thirds (and a little be-
cause of the indistinct articulation of
one or two of the players). Of course
when I say “plausible "I don't exactly
mean that any Brigade IIeadquarters
was run on the sketchy lines of General
Archibald Iroot's, or that the gallant
author or anybody else who was in the
beastly thing ever thought of the Great
War as a devastating joke, but rather
that if it be true, as has been rumoured,
that not all generals were miracles of
wisdom and forbearance; that British
subalterns and privates sometimes put
on the mask of humour; that Venus
did wander, as the observatories punc-
tually reported she did occasionally
wander, into the orbit of Mars —
then French Leave is a piece of artisti-
cally justifiable selection. Its absurdity
seems the most natural thing in the
world and its machinery (rare virtue!)
does not creak.
Itooty Tooty's brigade then was rest-
ing—if in the circumstances you can
call it resting. The rather stodgy Bri-
gade-Major's leave being due, his wife
has come over to Paris to wait for him.
The leave being cancelled (and you could
see how desperately overworked Head-
quarters was) there suddenly appears
what purports to be a niece of the billet
landlady's, a Mdlle. Juliette, of the
Paris stage, with a distinctly coming-on
disposition (and frock). The uxorious
Brigade-Major, weakly consenting to
the deception, suffers the tortures of the
damned by reason of the gallantries of
the precocious Staff-Captain and the
old-enough-to-know-better Brigadier.
There is marching and counter-march-
ing of detached units in the small hours;
arrival of the Brigade Interpreter with
Intelligence's reports; sorrowful con-
viction in the Brigadier's mind that
Juliette is Olga–Olga Thingummy, the
famous German spy. Confusions; ex-
plosions; solutions.
That's a dull account of a bright
matter. The players were not, with
the exception of Miss RENEE KELLY, of
the star class and (I don't necessarily
say therefore) were almost uniformly
admirable. I suppose the honours must
go to Mr. M. R. MoRAND's excellently
studied Brigadier—the most laughter-
compelling performance I have seen on
the “legitimate” for some years. But the
Mess Corporal (Mr. CHARLEs GROVEs),
the Staff-Captain (Mr.HENRY KENDALL),
the Brigade-Major (Mr.HYLTONALLEN),
the Interpreter (Mr. GEORGE DE WAR-
FAz) and the Mess Waiter (Mr. ARTHUR
RIscoe)—all deserve mention in des-
patches. As for the “business” it
was positively inspired at times, as
when the Mess Corporal retrieved the
red-hat (which the passionate Brigade-
Major had kicked in his jealous fury)
with an address which would have
done credit to the admirable GRock.
Miss RENEE KELLY had her pretty and
effective moments, but somebody should
ask her (no doubt in vain) to be less
tearful in the tearful aud just a little
less bright in the bright parts—a little
less fidgetty and fidgetting and out of
key, in fact.
I should say in general that author
and producer (Mr. EILLE NorwooD)
would do well to watch the serious
passages—always the danger-points in
farce. As nobody on our side of the

III.-ARE we going to THE Dogs 2
By Vice-Admiral (Retd.) Sir Boniface Bludger, K.C.B.
I was standing the other day at the window of the only
Club in London where they understand (or used to under-
stand) what devilled kidneys really are, musing in post-
prandial gloom on the vanished glories of this England of
ours. “Ichabod / " I cried aloud to the unheeding stream
of Piccadilly wayfarers; and echo answered, “Bod.”
What is wrong with us? Or what is wrong with me?
Are we actually going to the dogs, or is it merely that the
Club kidneys are going to the devil? JEREMIAH or Mrs.
Gummidge—which am I? Let the facts attest and let
posterity decide; thank Heaven I shall not be there to hear
the verdict.
After our half-baked victory over the Hun the popular
watchword was “Reconstruction.” We have now enjoyed
a year and more of this “building-up" process, and the net
result is that houses for those that lack them are as scarce
as iced soda-fountains in the Sahara.
In this work of restoration, we were told, our women
voters and legislators would play a leading part. What
part are they in truth playing? Their main object appar-
ently is still further to embitter the Drink question, although
if they would only put a little more bitter into our national
beverage they might help to lubricate matters. Is it not a
significant fact that the slackness evidenced in every phase
of industry manifests itself at a time when it becomes more
and more difficult to get a decent drink? In this respect
our progress is not so much to the dogs as to the cats, who
sneak along on the padded paws of Prohibition.
The crazy conditions to be observed in the industrial
world are well matched by the state of anarchy that pre-
vails in the sphere of the arts. Take music, for example.
I do not lay claim to more than a nodding acquaintance
with Euterpe, and at a classical concert, I am afraid, the
modding character of the relation becomes especially marked.
To me the sweetest music in the world is the roar of a
fifteen-inch gun on a day when the visibility is good and
plentiful. But I do know enough to be able to say that the
wild asses who with their jazz-bands “stamp o'er our heads
and will not let us sleep” (slightly to amend my old friend
FITzGERALD) are nothing less than musical Trotskys.
Music was once regarded as the staple nourishment of
the tender passion, and in my younger days the haunting
strains of “The Blue Danube” assisted many a budding
love affair to blossom. Dut these non-stop stridencies of
the modern ballroom, even if they left a man with breath
enough to propose, would effectually prevent the girl from
catching the drift of the avowal. You can't roar, “Will you
be mine?” into a maiden's ear as if you were conversing
ſrom the quarterdeck, and if you did she'd only think you
were ecstatically emulating the coloured gentleman in the
orchestra with the implements of torture and the misguided
WOlce.
I will pass over in the silence of despair such other
symptoms of national decadence as zigzag painting, whirl-
pool poetry, cinema star-gazing and the impossibility of
procuring a self-respecting Stilton (which assuredly is not
“living at this hour"). Nor can I trust myself to speak of
the spirit of Bolshevism that seems to animate our so-
called Labour Party, though I comfort myself with the
conviction that this doctrine will not wash, any more than
will its authors.
I will conclude these few reflections by drawing attention
to the manners of the modern girl, who is so busily engaged
in kicking over the traces that formerly kept her in her
proper place. Nowadays flappers who should still be in the
schoolroom consider themselves called upon to teach their
grandmothers how to conduct their lives; and, to complete
the chaos, the grandmothers are eagerly lapping it up, and
in the matter of dress and deportment are even bettering
the instruction. Si vieillesse sarait /

CONVERTED CASTLES.
RURAL. England, I learn, is rapidly
changing hands—not for the first time,
by the way, but we cannot go into that
just now. Excellent treatises on feudal
tenure, wapentake, the dissolution of
the monasteries and the enclosure of
common lands may be picked up dirt
cheap at any second-hand bookshop in
the Charing Cross Road with the words
“Presentation Copy” erased from the
flyleaf by a special and ingenious pro-
cess. What is happening now is that
farmers are buying up the big estates
in pieces, and Norman piles or Eliza-
bethan manors are beginning to be too
expensive to maintain, what with coal
and the rise in the minimum wage of
along with an empty bottle that I want
to get rid of I do not throw it down
into an area, where it would make a
most horrible crash, but softly into the
thick shrubs of the Crescent Gardens.
This brings me back to the country
again.
There will not be enough of the new
rich to purchase a castellated mansion
apiece, partly because of the Excess.
Profits Duty, which is crippling this
kind of enterprise, and partly because
so many baronial seats, romantic and
picturesque in their way, are terribly
under-garaged. On the other hand
you cannot expect a farmer who hap-
pens to be buying the fields round ||
Badgery Mortimer to have any use for
a dungeon keep or the haunted picture-
too. In the state-saloon, with a few
trifling alterations, such as the intro-
duction of a geyser and a sink, will live
Mrs. Ponsonby-Smith, who will sniff a
little at the Jeffries in their attic.suite
and the Mutts who live in the moat.
But Mrs. Jeffries will have compensa-
tions, because the air is really so much
more bracing, my dear, on the higher
ground, and on fine days one can walk
about the roof and peep through the
boiling-oil holes, while as for the Mutts
they are protected, at any rate, from
those bitterly piercing east winds and
have an excellent view of the draw-
bridge.
A further advantage of residing at
Soping Hall will be that you can do all
your shopping and pay your calls with-
vassals and one thing
and another.
“The stately homes of Eng-
land
How beautiful they stood
Before their recent owners
Relinquished them for
good,” -
as the poet justly ob-
serves. And even if
there is enough money
to keep up the castle
without the broad acres
(though as a matter of
fact an acre is not any
broader than it is long)
there is no fun in hav-
ing a castle at all when
the deer park has been
divided into allotments
and the Dutch garden
is under swedes.

come to visit you in ex-
pensive motor-cars they-
will have the privilege
of passing through the
great iron gates on the
main road and up the

his haversack from the
Second Crusade.
I am quite aware that

nounced “Mumsie") Castle, and The

In London the difficulty of dealing
with huge houses has been solved in a
very subtle manner by turning them
into a couple of maisonettes apiece, so
that under the portico of what used to
be 105 Myrtle Crescent you discover two
perfectly good doors, marked 105A and
105B. Into the letter-box of the door
marked 105A the postman invariably
puts the letters intended for 105B, and
vice versé, but, as these are always
letters addressed to the last tenant but
two, it does not really very much matter.
Both are desirable maisonettes, though
the tenants of 105A have the sole en-
joyment of the lincrusta dadoes in the
original dining-room. In some cases
there are as many as three maisonettes,
and the notice on the area gate says,
“105c. Mrs. Orlando Smith,” where
it used to say simply “No Bottles.”
I never really understood that notice
myself, for whenever I am walking
gallery in the west wing. No, there
is only one thing to do and that is to
break these places up into a number of
self-contained homes.
HISTORIC FLATs To LET
is the house-agents'advertisement which
I seem to see, and what you will actually
find will be a sort of concentrated ham-
let where modern improvements are
mixed with ancient grandeur and the
white-haired seneschal is kept on to
operate the electric lift.
Let us take, for instance, the case of
Soping Hall. There will be none of
that untidy straggling arrangement
about it which detracts so largely from
the beauty of Soping Barnet, Little
Soping and Soping Monachorum. In
Soping Hall the billiard-room will be
the village club, the armoury the black-
smith's shop, the housekeeper's room
the place where you buy buttons and
balls of string and barley-sugar, the
cellars the village tavern, and very nice
becomes really infec-
tious and every county insists on a
legislative assembly of its own it may
be necessary to turn some of these
great houses into Parliament chambers,
and the rural civil service will also no
doubt insist on having offices compar-
able with the vast hotels which their
parent bodies occupy in London. But
this will not account for nearly all the
ancestral seats, and, in calling the at-
tention of the Minister of Health and
Housing to this little memorandum of
mine, I would specially urge him to
note how it will solve some of the most
difficult problems which confront him
to-day.
There will be a rush upon these
potted villages, and that will ease the
situation in towns and free a number
of cottages for agricultural labourers
too. There will be a rush, not only
because of the advantages which I have
already enumerated, but because all the
people who live in Soping Hall will be
able to put “Soping Hall" on their note-

TIPS EOR UNCLES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am writing to
you about uncles because you are in a
way a kind of general uncle. Uncles
are much more useful than aunts, be-
cause uncles always give money and
aunts mostly give advice. Only, as
the Head always says when he jaws our
form, “I regret to see in this form a
serious deterioration"—I meaninuncles.
They come down here and trot us round
and say what a luxurious place it is
compared with the stern old Spartan
days. They know something, though.
They ask us to have meals with them
at an hotel. They take care not to face
a luxurious house-dinner. And while
we dine they tell yarns about the hard-
ness of the old days and how it tough-
ened a fellow. And then, because about
1870 it was the custom to tip a boy five
bob, they fork out five bob and tell you
not to waste it. -
If the Head had any sense—only you
can't expect sense from Heads—he'd
put up a notice at the school gates:
“Parents, Uncles and Friends are re-
spectfully reminded that the cost of tuck
has increased three hundred per cent.
since 1914.” Why, old Badham, my
bedroom prefect, who was a fag in 1914,
turned up the other day and declared
that then he could buy four pounds of
strawberries for a bob, and that a fag
could get enough chocolate for two bob
to give him a week in the sick-room.
Yet we have uncles coming down in
trains(fare fifty percent.extra), smoking
cigars (costing two hundred per cent.
extra), cabbing it up to school (a hun-
dred-and-fifty per cent. extra) and then
tipping as if the old KAISER was still
swanking in Potsdam.
Now Sutton minor, who has a posi-
tive beast of a house-master and is prac-
tically a Bolshevist, says that we ought
to go on strike against the tipping
system and demand a regular living
wage from relations. He says that if
a scavenger gets four quid a week a
fellow who has to tackle Greek aorists
ought to get eight quid a week.
But I'm afraid a strike might aggra-
vate uncles. It's no use upsetting the
goose that lays the silver eggs, so I
thought it better to write to you, point-
ing out that there was one luxury still
at pre-war prices and that uncles should
never miss a chance of indulging in it,
and whenever high prices bothered them
they should write us a bright cheerful
letter enclosing a postal order—they're
still quite cheap.
Chalmers major, who has read this
and leads a sad life, having only aunts,
says that the only hope for him is in
fixing a standard tip of 9s. 11; d. or,
better still, 19s. 11; d., that women
couldn't help giving.
So hoping that all uncles will put
their hands to the plough—l mean in
their pockets—and then the bitter ery
of the New Poor will cease in our
public schools,
Yours respectfully, BRUCE TERTIUs.

THE STATE AND THE SCREEN.
(By a Student of Film Politics.)
GREAT satisfaction has been evinced
in film circles over the conferment of a
signal honour on Signor PAVANELLI, the
outstanding Italian screen luminary.
The rank of Chevalier of the Crown of
Italy is equivalent to a knighthood in
this country, and PAVANELLI's elevation,
is a gratifying proof of the paramount
position which the cinema is assuming
in Italian national affairs. But grati-
fication is sadly tempered by the de-
lorable lack of State recognition from
which film-artists suffer in this country.
The joint co-starring Sovereigns of the
Screen, though acclaimed by the popu-
lace with an enthusiasm unparalleled
in the annals of adoration, were allowed,
to depart from our shores without a
single official acknowledgment of their
services to humanity. No vote of con-
gratulation was passed by the Houses
of Parliament; no honorary degree was
conferred on them by any University;
no ode of welcome was forthcoming
from the pen of the PoET LAUREATE.
The discontent caused by the indif-
ference of the Government to the wishes
of the people is fraught with formidable
possibilities. Already there are serious
rumours of the summoning of a Special
Trade Union Congress to discuss the
desirability of direct action as a means
of compelling the Government to aban-
don their attitude of hostility to the
only form of monarchy which the work-
ing-classes can conscientiously support.
It is further reported that Lieutenant-
Commander -KEN worTHY, M.P., will
seize the first opportunity to move the
impeachment of Dr. BRIDGEs. The in-
dignation in Printing House Square has
reached boiling-point, and it is reported
that the authorities are only awaiting
the delivery of a huge consignment of
small pica type to launch a fresh and
final onslaught on the Coalition.
The provocation has undoubtedly
been intense. It was proved in an
article of studied moderation and ex-
quisite taste that the time had come to
revise our estimates of bygone grandeur
and substitute for the devotion to a
Queen of tarnished fame and disastrous
tendencies the spontaneous and chival-
rous worship of her beneficent and pros-
perous namesake. Yet in spite of this
dignified and convincing appeal no in-
vitation was sent to the one person
whose presence at the recent proceed-
ings at Holyrood would have lent them
a crowning lustre. The action or in-
action of the Lord CHAMBERLAIN is
inexplicable, except on the assumption
that Queen PICKFoRD's engagement to
attend the Spa Conference would have
rendered it impossible for her to accept
the invitation to Edinburgh. None the
less the invitation should have been
sent. Besides, the resources of aviation
might have surmounted the difficulty.
In any case this deplorable oversight
has knocked one more nail in the coffin
of the PRIME MINISTER.

shot. Hodgson again used his favourite
spoon.”—Provincial Paper.

pose. -

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 12th.-Wiscount CUR-
zoN's complaint about “crawling" taxi-
cabs was ostensibly based upon the ob-
struction thus caused to more rapidly

moving traffic. But I fancy that it was
really due to an inherent belief that the
motor-car is a noble creature, only
happy when exceeding the speed-limit
and dashing through police - controls,
and that to compel the poor thing to
crawl is “agin natur’" and
ought to be dealt with by the
R.S.P.C.A.
As usual much of Question-
time was devoted to Russian
affairs. Colonel WEDGwooD
wanted to know whether the
Cabinet had approved a mes-
sage from Mr. CHURCHILL to
the late Admiral KolchAK, ad-
vising him how to commend his
Administration to the PRIME
MINISTER, who was described
in the telegram as “all-power-
ful, a convinced democrat and
particularly devoted to ad-
vanced views on the land
question.” Mr. LAw, while
provisionally promising a Blue-
book on Siberia, declined to
pick out a single message from
a whole bunch.
The news that the Soviet Gov-
ernment had accepted the British condi-
tions with regard to the resumption of
trade and had thereupon been requested
to conclude an armistice with Poland
did not seem particularly welcome to
any section of the House. Those whom
Mr. STANToN in stentorian whispers
daily describes as the “Bolshies "
evidently feared that the request had
been accompanied by a threat, while
others were horrified at the idea of re-
cognising the present régime in Russia,
and drew from Mr. LAw a hasty dis-
claimer. The House as a whole would,
I think, have liked to learn how you
can do business with a person whom
you do not recognise?
The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer
refused to accept Mr.GEORGETERRELL's
proposal to reduce the Excess Profits
Tax from sixty per cent. to forty, but, in
reply to Sir G. YoUNGER—who “ has
such a way wid him "–promised that
next year he would make the reduction.
He admitted that it was in many ways
an unsatisfactory tax, but the Govern-
ment could not afford to part with it
unless a substitute was provided. Some.
body suggested “Economy,” and Sir F.
BANBURY proved to his own satisfaction
that the present estimates could be re-
duced by a hundred-and-fifty millions.
But unexpected support for the Gov-
ernment came from Mr. Asquith, who
as the original sponsor of the tax felt
it his duty to support it.
There was a perfect E.P.D.mic of
criticism, but it was brilliantly count-
ered by Mr. BALDwiN, who declared that
the CHANCELLOR, far from leading the
country down the rapids, “was the
one man who had seized a rock in mid-
stream and was hanging on to it with
hands and feet.” The Amendment was
rejected by 289 to 117, and the clause
as a whole was passed by 202 to 16.
THE LIMPET OF THE EXCHEQUER.
MR. BALDw1N PORTRAYs HIs chIEF “HANGING TO A ROCK

Tuesday, July 13th.-Lord O'HAGAN

outvote the Government a few days ago
on a motion excusing them of extrava-
gance. Yet that did not prevent him

to-day from saying that the War Office
should be more generous in their finan-
cial treatment of the Territorial Force,
and particularly of the Cadet Corps.
Naturally Lord PEEL did not
refrain from calling attention
to this inconsistency—com-
mon to most of the financial
critics of the Administration—
but nevertheless he made a
reply indicating that the grants
for the Territorial Force were
being revised, presumably in
an upward direction, since
Lord O'HAGAN expressed him-
self grateful.
The Commons, like the Lords,
are all for economy collectively,
if not individually. General
cheers greeted Mr. BonAR
LAw's announcement that all
war-subsidies—save that on
wheat—were to be brought to
an end as soon as possible, but
then there were similar cheers
for those Members who urged
the substitution of ex-service

The House enjoyed the unusual ex-
perience of hearing from Lieut.-Com-
mander KENworTHY an apology—and
a very handsome one too—for some-
thing that he had said in debate about
Colonel CROFT. It was accompanied
by a tribute to his military efficiency
which made that gallant warrior blush.
It only now remains for the Leader of
the National Party to reciprocate by
rescuing from the Naval archives some
equally complimentary reference to the
services of Lieut.-Com-
mander KEN worTHY.
A new sport has been
invented by Colonel

in sending two tele-
grams simultaneously

gets there first. At

by twenty minutes. Mr.
ILLINGWoRTH excused
himself from giving an
immediate explanation
on the ground that he
had not had time to
check the facts. No
doubt he hopes that in
the interim other Mem-

GUINNEss's example

—Lord MILNER must
have thought he was
back in the era of
“Chinese Slavery”when
he found himself as-
sailed on all sides be-
cause the Chief Native
Commissioner in Kenya
Colony (late British
East Africa) had issued
a circular instructing
the chiefs to influence their followers
in the direction of honest toil. Lord Is-
LINGTON described this as “perilously
near forced labour; ” His Grace of
CANTERBURY facetiously suggested that
the chiefs' idea of influence would be
the sjambok; and Lord EMMoTT talked
of “Prussianism.”
Taught by past experience Lord MIL-
NER did not make light of the accusa-
tions, but set himself to show how little
real substance they contained. The
Chief Native Commissioner was “not
a Prussian "; on the contrary the local
white population thought him too great
an upholder of native privileges. But
he was very keen on getting the black

this circular, which was open to mis-
interpretation. An explanatory docu-
ment would be issued shortly.

escence he starts again. Just now he
is once more nearing the imaginary line
that separates proper from impropa-
Gandhism.
The House was delighted to see Mr.
DEVLIN and Mr. MACVEAGH back in
their places. A little honest Irish ob-
struction would be a refreshing change
after the feeble imitations of the Ken-
worthies and Wedgwoods. But the
SPEAKER could not accept the pro-
position that a speech delivered three
weeks ago, in which an Irish official
was alleged to have prophesied some
dreadful things which as a matter of
fact had not happened, could be re-
garded as “a definite matter of urgent
public importance.”
It is unfortunate that the PRIME
MINISTER was unable to get back from
Spa in order to assist in the final sup-
pression of his famous land-duties.
Most of the speeches delivered were
made up of excerpts from his old orations
of ten years ago—that almost prehistoric
era known as the Limehouse Period—
and it would have been an object-lesson
in political gymnastics to see him ex-
plaining himself away.

Sir H. GREENwood gave particulars
of the Sinn Fein raid on the Dublin

highly improbable that postal officials
had anything to do with it.

TWENTY YEARs on.
WE were sitting in the verandah,
l?rnest and I. On the greensward before
us Ernest Junior and James Junior
(I am James) disported themselves as
became their years, which were respec-
tively 1; and 13. In the middle dis-
tance, or as middle as the size of our
lawn permits, might be seen the mothers
of Ernest Junior and James Junior deep
in conversation, discussing, perhaps,
the military prowess of their lords,
though I rather fear I caught the word
“jumper” every now and then.
A loud difference of opinion between
James II. and Ernest II. as to the
possession of a wooden horse momen-
tarily disturbed the peaceful scene. It
was left to Ernest and myself to settle
it, our incomparable wives being still
completely engrossed with the subject
of our military prowess (or of jumpers).
When quiet reigned once more Ernest
said, “Have you ever looked twenty
years on 2"
“Practically never,” I answered. “It
is too exhausting.”
“It is exhausting, but with my usual
energy I do it all the same,” said Ernest,
who is as a fact the world's champion
lotus-eater. “Last night I was pictur-
ing a little scene in the year 1940.
Shall I tell you of it?” And with-
out waiting for my assent he pro-
ceeded :-
“The scene is laid in an undergradu-

Junior are discovered in néglige atti-

something like this:—
“Ernest Junior. What are you going
to do with yourself in the Wac.”
“James Junior. I shall go abroad, in
spite of my choice of objectives being
so terribly restricted.
“Ernest Junior. Why restricted 2
“James Junior. Well, I wouldn't say
this to anybody else, but to tell you the
truth it is impossible for me to go to
either France, Belgium or Italy. You
see my dear old father was in these
countries during the first Great War,
and if I were so much as to mention
them he'd never stop talking. If I
were to say that I proposed spending
a fortnight in the Ardennes it would
let loose such a flood of reminiscence
that I should hardly get away before
next term begins.
“He gets a little confused too at times.
He told me the other day a long story
about the relief of Ypres, and he also
boasted of having himself captured a
large number of Turks on the Somme.
“And it isn't only that. My mother
was a W.A.D. in France, you know.
And when the old man had done talk-
ing of Ypres and the Somme she'd
begin about Rouen and Etaples.”
I laughed, but without mirth, for 1
did not really think this at all funny.
And after all I might have said just
the same about Ernest, if only I'd
thought of it first.

POINTS OF VIEW.
THE manager had seen to it that the
party of young men, being very obviously
rich, at any rate for this night, had
some of the best attendance in the res-
taurant. Several waiters had been told
off specially to look after them, the
least and busiest of whom was little
more than a boy—a slender pale boy,
who was working very hard to give
satisfaction. The cynic might think—
and say, for cynics always say what
they think—that this zeal was the re-
sult of his youth; but the cynic for
once would be only partly right. The
zeal also had sartorial springs, this
eventful day being the first on which the
boy had been promoted to full waiter-
hood, and the first therefore on which
he had ever worn a suit of evening dress;
which by dint of hard saving his family
had been able to obtain for him. Wearing
a uniform of such dignity and conscious
that he was on the threshold of his
career, he was trying very hard to make
good and hoping very fervently that he
would get through without any drops
or splashes to impair the freshness of
his new and wonderful attire.
The party of young men, who had been
at a very illustrious English school to-
gether and now were either at a uni-
versity or in the world, were celebrating
an annual event and were very merry
about it. For the most part they had,
between the past and the present, as
many topics of conversation as were
needed, but now and then came a lull,
during which some of them would look
around at the other tables, note the
prettier of the girls or the odder of the
men and comment upon them; and it
chanced that in such a pause one of the
diners happened for the first time to
notice with any attention the assiduous
young waiter. Although not old enough
to have given any thought to the anom-
aly of youth (though lowly) attending
upon youth (though gilded) at its meals
in this way—not old enough indeed to
have pondered at all upon the relations
of Capital and Labour or of the domi-
neering and the servile—he had reflected
a good deal upon the cut and fit of
clothes, and there was something about
the waiting-boy's evening coat that out-
raged his critical sense. Nor did the
fact that the other's indifferent tailoring
throw the perfection of his own into
such brilliant contrast—the similarity
between the livery of service and the
male costume de lure fostering such
comparisons — make him any more
lenient. -
“Did you ever see,” he asked his
neighbour, “such a coat-collar as that
waiting Johnnie's 2 I ask you. How
can anyone, even a waiter, wear a thing
like that ? Don't they ever see them-
selves in the glass, or if they do can't
they see straight? Why, it covers his
collar altogether.”
His companion agreed. “And the
shoulders! You'd have thought that
in a restaurant like this the manage-
ment would be more particular. By
George, that's a jolly pretty girl com-
ing in Look—over there, just under
the clock, with the red hair.” And the
waiter was forgotten. Only, however,
by his table critics, for at that moment
a little woman who had made friends
with the hall-porter for this express
purpose was peering through the win-
dow of the entrance, searching the room
for her son. She had never yet seen
him at his work at all, and certainly
not in his grand waiting clothes, and
naturally she wanted to.
“Ah!” she said at last, pointing the
boy out to the porter, “there he is At
that table with all the young gentlemen.
Doesn't he look fine? And don't they
fit him beautifully 2 Why, no one
would know the difference if he were
to sit down and one of those young
gentlemen were to wait on him.”

PIGLETS.
WHILE waiting for proof-sheets of
my book on The Dynamic Force of
Modern Art I thought I might get a
certain amount of amusement out of a
little correspondence with my neigh-
bour, Mr. Gibbs, small farmer and
dairyman, between whom and myself
letters had passed a short time ago on
the subject of a noisy cow, since re-
moved from the field below the study
window of the house that has been
lent me by my friend Hobson. With
this end in view I wrote to Mr. Gibbs
as follows:—
MY DEAR MR. GIBBs, The field of
the uproarious cow has, I notice, sud-
denly become tenanted again, this time
by what appears to be a school, herd
or murrain of swine. Their number
seems to vary. Sometimes I count
ten younglings, sometimes as many as
thirteen, and once I made it as much
as fourteen.
Did you know they were there, or
are they a crop 2 Or is the field suffer.
ing from swine fever, of which they are
the outward manifestation ? Anyhow,
whether they are friends of yours or
have merely just happened, as it were,
they are distinctly intriguing.
My wife was remarking to me only
yesterday how nice some pork would
be as a change from the eternal verities,
beef and mutton, and I told her that if
she would look out of my window she
would see the pork running about,
simply asking for it. There are so
many of these piglets that I don't
think the old sow would miss one.
Swine can't count, can they 2
But apart from food values they
interest me as subjects for the Cubist,
the Vorticist and other exploiters of
dynamic force in the Art of to-day (I
fancy I told you in a previous letter
that I am engaged upon a tome on this
subject).
Figure to yourself, mom ami, what
delightful rhomboidal figures WYNDHAM
LEWIS and his school would make of
these budding porkers with the sleek
torso and the well-poised angular snout,
and, having visualised their treatment
of the theme, compare it with the
painted effigies of such animals by
GEORGE: MoRLAND, which were merely
pigs, Sir, and nothing more. No sym-
bolism, no force. You get me—what?
But looking at these piglets from a
more intimate point of view, don't you
think (if they should happen to be
yours, and you have any influence with
their parents) that something should be
done about their faces? They have
such a pushed-in appearance. Can this
be normal? If so, it must seriously
interfere with their truffling. But per-
haps this is not good truffle-hunting
country. I'm sorry if this is so, as I
could do with a nice brace of truffles
now and again.
Remember me kindly to our mooing
friend, and believe me, dear Mr. Gibbs,
Yours sincerely,
ARTHUR K. WILKINson.
How this early touch of Spring has
got into the blood, to be sure.
To this letter Mr. Gibbs replied thus:—
DEAR SIR,-i cant make much of
your letter except a riglemerole about
pigs and dinamite and pictures but
what they have to do with one another
i dont know if you want some pork
why dont you say so strait out like mr
Hobson does i shall be killing one this
week shall i send you a nice leg and
remain Yours obedient
HENRY GIBBs.
My reply, given in the affirmative,
resulted in the arrival of a succulent-
looking joint with a bill for leg of pork
special 5 lbs. at 2s. per lb. 11s.
As the price too was rather special I
returned the bill with the following:—
MY DEAR MR. GIBBs, What a rap-
turous piece of pork I Lovely in life,
and oh, how beautiful in death. I
count the hours till 7.30 to-morrow.
I am truly sorry you couldn't read
my letter with comfort. I have derived
great pleasure from yours. You appear

netic orthography which is very re-
freshing and seems to bear the same

pork was delicious.

NOCTURNE.
Of course I suppose I ought to be
grateful for the opportunity of having a
front seat at one of Nature's romances,
but I imagine she reaps more applause
at matinées than at soirées. I know
that I But judge for yourself.
The dramatis persona were corn-
crakes, neighbours of mine. The hero-
ine—a neat line in spring birdings—I
labelled “Thisbe,” and she had evidently
inspired affection of no mean degree in
the hearts of two enthusiastic swains,
Strong-i'-th'-lung and Eugène. I know
all this because Thisbe's home is a
small tuft of grass not distant from my
bedroom, and her admirers wooed her
at long range from opposite corners of
my field.
Now, as a cursory study of ornith-
ology will tell you, the corncrake's
method of attracting his bride is by
song, and the criterion of excellence in
C.C. circles is that the song shall be
protracted, consistent and perfectly
monotonous. To those who are un-
acquainted with his note I would
describe it as rather similar to the
intermittent buzzing noise which an
inexperienced telephone operator lets
loose when she can't think of a wrong
number to give you. It has also points
of resemblance to the periodic thud of
the valve of a motor-tube when one is
running on a deflated tyre. But there
is no real standard of comparison. As
a musical feat it is unique, and I for
one am glad it is.
It was night. Eugène was in pos-
session of the stage when I began to
take an interest in the romance. I
cannot say for how long he had sere-
naded his divinity before I became
conscious of his lay, but I do know that
thereafter he put in one and a half hours||
of good solid craking before he desisted.
I then felt grateful for the silence, rolled
over and prepared to get on with my
postponed slumber. - - -
But Strong-i'-th'-lung decreed other-
wise. With a contemptuous snort at his
rival's performance he opened his epic.
He was splendid. For one and three-
ninths hours he descanted on the glories
of field life, on the freshness of the night,
on the brilliance of the June foliage; for
the next two hours he ardently pro- |
claimed the surpassing beauty of Thisbe's
eye, the glossiness of her plumage, the
neattless of her claw, and he wound up
with a mad twenty minutes of piercing
monotony as he depicted the depth of
his devotion for her.
When he ceased, in a silence which
was almost deafening, I could visualise
Thisbe dimpling with satisfaction and
undoubtedly filled with tenderness to-
ward a lover capable of expressing him-
the practically accepted suitor.
self so eloquently. I turned over with
a sigh of relief and closed my eyes in
pleasurable anticipation of rest.
But Eugène felt it necessary to reply.
I think his intention was to crake dis-
belief of his rival's sincerity, to throw
cold water on his burning professions,
perhaps even to question the excellence
of his intentions. But his nerve was
obviously shaken by his competitor's
undoubtedly fine performance, and he
craked indecisively. At 4.30 A.M. I dis-
tinctly heard him utter a flat note. At
4.47 he missed the second part of a bar
entirely. Thisbe's beak, I must believe,
curled derisively; Strong-i'-th'-lung
laughed contemptuously, and at 5.10A.M.
Eugène faltered, stammered and fled
from the field defeated.
The sequel I have had to build up on
rather fragmentary data, but it appears
that Eugène fled as far as Pudberry
Parva, and endeavoured to cool his dis-
comfiture in a dewy hayfield.
To him there came an old crone, the
“father and mother” of all corncrakes,
who comforted him, cossetted him, and
from a fund of deep experience offered
him hints on voice production. She also
gave him of a nostrum of toadwort and
garlic, which mollified his lacerated
chords, and she prescribed massage of
the throat by rubbing against a young
beech stem. -
Within two days Eugène was back in
my field. In tones that ſeigned to falter
he craked a few bars to open the per-
formance. Strong-i'-th'-lung at once
rose full of pitying confidence and craked
for two and a half hours the song of
It was
a good song, and . Thisbe seemed
pleased, though I fancy she rather
resented the note of assurance which he
imparted to his ballad.
Then Eugène came on. Bearing well
in mind all the instruction of his recent
benefactress, he commenced at 11.45 P.M.
such a masterpiece as has never before
been heard in the bird world. His con-
sistency of period was masterly, his
iteration superb and his even monotony
incomparable. Crake succeeded crake
with dull regular inevitability. So far
as I know he carried his bat. He was
still playing strongly when I fell on a
troubled sleep about 5.30. . . .
The next day, walking through the
field, I put up two birds which flew
away together. One was Thisbe. And
the other? Well, not Strong-i'-th'-lung.
I stumbled across him a little later,
dead without a wound.

should MILLIONAIRES READ HOMER"
THE recent discovery of a London
millionaire, who not only lives in a
small suburban villa, where his wife
dispenses with servants, goes to bed at
7.30 P.M. and rises at 3 A.M., but reads
HoMER in the Greek, has caused a
sensation.
His endeavours to prove to a doubting
world the truth of a favourite British
adage is admirable; and his modest
establishment only bears out what the
millionaires keep on telling us, that,
owing to high taxation and the abnor-
mal cost of luxuries, they must really
be reckoned as poor men. But his
study of HomeR provokes a difference
of opinion.
Our representative, in interviewing
a venerable sociologist on the subject,
was told that the study of Greek for
millionaires is, within proper limits,
comparatively harmless, but that Ho-
MER contains the elements of danger.
“It is in HoMER's apotheosis of
heroism in human combat that the
peril lies,” he said. “Having regard
to the part played in the past by finan-
ciers in the wars between civilised
nations, the security of the League of
Nations will be threatened if the mil-
lionaires of to-day come under the spell
of that great poet, who, with all his ex-
cellent qualities, directed his genius so
persistently to the praise of warfare.”
One of the millionaire class was next
approached, and was asked what he
thought of millionaires reading HoMER.
“Why not 2" he asked. “Some mil-
lionaires are great readers. I am one
myself. There are not half-a-dozen of
OPPENHEIM's I haven't read; and I like
HALL CAINE—and ETHEL DELL's not
bad. Who is this HoMER 2 If he's
any good I may as well order him.”
“Well, HoMER was a poet, you know,
a—”
“I've no use for poetry,” said the
millionaire. -
“A Greek poet, who lived—”
“Greek. A Greek, did you say?”
A shrewd look came into his eyes.
“Some of the cutest devils I know are
Greeks.” He pulled down a shirt-cuff
and took a diamond-studded pencil from
his waistcoat pocket. “How do you
spell it? With an H2" -

Double Life (GRANT RICHARDs) is a story that unblush-
ingly bases its appeal on the love of almost everyone for a
fairy-tale of good fortune. The matter of it is to show how a
lady amateur, wife of a novelist, herself hardly knowing one
end of a horse from the other, might make forty thousand
pounds in a year on the Turf, without even her own
husband so much as suspecting her activities. The thing
isn't likely, is indeed a fantasy of the wildest improbability;
but, told with the zest imparted to it here by Mr. GRANT
RICHARDs, it provides first-rate fun. Some danger of
monotony there was bound to be in what is really a varia-
tion upon a single theme. Though the author cunningly
avoids this, I think it might justly be observed that he has
made Olivia's plunges almost too uniformly successful. But
perhaps not; after all, while you are handling fairy-gold,
why be niggardly of it? . The heroine's introduction to
horse-racing comes about through the unconscious agency
of her husband, who takes her with him on a visit to New-
market in search of local colour for a “sporting ” novel.
The resulting situation reaches its climax in what is the
best scene of the book, when Geoffrey, returning from a race
that he has visited alone, but upon which Olivia, unknown
to him, has risked thousands, recounts its progress in the
best manner of realistic fiction, wholly ignorant of the
true cause of what seems such flattering agitation in the
listener. Altogether a happy if not very subtle story
which I am glad that Mr. GRANT RICHARDs could persuade
himself to publish.
To write, as Mr. R. W. CHAMBERs has written, fifty-two
novels, many of them excellent and all readable, while still
on the right side of sixty, is an achievement of intelligent
industry that entitles any novelist, at the latter end, to take
matters a little easily. The Moonlit Way (APPLETON) has
neither the imaginative qualities of The King in Yellow, the
humour of In Search of the Unknown, nor the adventurous
tang of Ashes of Empire, but it is a good live story that will
carry the reader's interest to the last page. Mr. CHAMBERS
is at his best when dealing with spies and secret service
agents and scheming chancellors and the other subter-
ranean apparatus of war and diplomacy; at his least
interesting when depicting affluent young America on its
native heath of New York bricks and mortar. The Moonlit
Way deals with all these things and more. We are whisked
from the Bosphorus to the Welland Canal on the heels of
Germany’s “War in the United States,” and French Secret
Service officers, German saloon keepers and Sinn Fein revo-
lutionaries jostle one another for a place in our interest.
The novel-reading public knows that it is quite safe in buy-
ing any story by Mr. CHAMBERs, and, if it does not expect
too much of The Moonlit Way, it will not be disappointed.
Lately, volumes of individual memorial to dead youth
seem to have become less frequent. Perhaps there was a
suggestion that the making of them, or rather their publica-
tion for the eyes of strangers, was in danger of being over-
done. However this may be, I think that, quite apart from
the appeal of circumstance, there would always have been
a welcome for such a bright-natured book as one, that
Father Ron ALD KNox has put together, mostly from diaries

and letters, about Patrick Shaw-Stewart (CoLLINs). Eton
and Balliol will agree that there could be no biographer
better fitted to record the life, as happy seemingly as it was
fated to be short, of one who combined success with popu-
larity at both these places, was caught by the War on the
threshold of a wider career, served his country with very
notable distinction and was killed in the winter of 1917.
Though he met death in France, the most of SHAw-
STEwART's war-service was on the Eastern front ; in
particular he saw more than most soldiers of the whole
Gallipoli adventure, to which he went as a member of that
amazing company—surely the very flower of this country's
war contribution—the Hood Battalion of the R.N.V.R.
Here he was the comrade of many of those whom England
has especially delighted to honour: RUPERT BRooke,
DENIs-BRowNE, CHARLEs LISTER and others, all of whom
figure in these vivid and most attractive letters; from which
also one gathers an engaging picture of SHAW-STEwART
himself, a generously admiring, humorous and entirely inde-
pendent young Tory in a band of brilliant revolutionaries.
In fine a book (despite its theme of promise sacriſiced) full
war-student it is in its unassuming way very attractive.
Captain KERMIT Roosevel.T made many friends while
serving as a Captain with the Motor Machine-Gun Corps
in Mesopotamia, and here he reveals himself as a keen
soldier and a pleasant companion. In style he is perhaps |
a shade too jerky; his frequent failure to make his con-
nections gives one a sense of being in the hands of a rather
rambling guide. But the important points are that he is
an engaging rambler, and that he can describe his experi-
ences both of war and peace with so clear a simplicity that
they can be easily visualized. When the American Army
arrived in France Captain Roosevelt naturally wished to
join it, and his last chapter is called “With the First
Division in France and Germany.” But for us the main
interest of his book lies in the work he did with the British
in Mesopotamia, and to thank him for this would seem to
be an impertinence.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT's Prom the Log of the Welsa
(CHATTo) deals with some vague period before the War
(dates are most carefully concealed), when the versatile
of laughter and a sin-
gularly charming char-
acter-study of one who,
in his biographer's
phrase, was assuredly
“not one of the passen-
gers of his generation."
Miss ELLA Sykes,
after going with her
brother and a camera
on his special mission
to Kashgar during the
earlier days of the War,
has detailed in charming
fashion, under the title

them they have given me a good deal of information, with a
lot of really capital photographs, about a country—Chinese
Turkestan—that one may have just heard of before, though
it is impossible to be sure. Resisting a burning desire to
pass on newly-acquired learning to the first listener, I will
be content to say that a more readable volume of its kind
has not come my way for a long time, and incidentally the
country itself seems surprisingly desirable. For one thing
it is free from the mosquitoes that spoil so many books of

the yaks, that one had supposed to be fearsome beasts, are

charmingly ingenuous pride of possession, his shrewd,
humorousand excessively didactic utterances about painters,
pictures, architecture and female beauty, his zeal for water-
colour sketching and his apparently profound contempt of
other exponents of the craft. Nothing could be less like (I
thank Heaven) the ordinary yachtsman's recollections of his
travels, and I get an impression that Mr. BENNETT was not
ill-pleased to leave most of the work and the technical
knowledge to his skipper.

Outraged Batsman. “JARGE,

Ol Do BELIEVE You 'M Bowlis' DELIBERATE AT Moi GAMMY LEG.”
Jarge (feeling that something ought to be said). “WHY, WILLYUM, O1 THoughT THEY was Born GAMMY."
ELIZABETH GOES ON HOLIDAY.
“PLEASE, 'm, may I go for my 'oli-
days a week come Thursday?” asked
Elizabeth, She was evidently labour-
ing under some strong excitement, for
she panted as she spoke and so far for-
got herself in her agitation as to take
up the dust in the hall instead of sweep-
ing it under the mat.
“But you promised to go on your
holiday when we have ours in Sept-
ember,” I protested, aghast. (You will
shortly understand the reason of my
dismay.) “I don't see how I can pos-
sibly manage --
“I'm sorry, 'm, but I must take 'em
then,” interposed Elizabeth with a
horrid giving-notice gleam in her eye
which I have learnt to dread. “You
see, my young man is 'avin' 'is 'olidays
then an’—an’”—she drew up her lank
form and a look that was almost human
came into her face—“'e's arsked me
to go with 'im,” she finished with in-
effable pride.
I am aware that this is not an unusual
arrangement amongst engaged couples
in the class to which Elizabeth belongs;
nevertheless I felt it was the moment
for judicious advice, knowing how ephe-
meral are the love-affairs of Elizabeth.
No butterfly that flits from flower to
flower could be more elusive than her
young men. Our district must swarm
with this fickle type.
“Do you think it right to go off on
a holiday with a stranger?” I began
diffidently.
“’Im! 'E isn't a stranger,” broke in
Elizabeth. “'E's my young man.”
“Which young man?”
“My new young man.”
“But don't you think it would be
better if he were not such a new young
man—I mean, if he were an old young
man—er—perhaps I ought to say you
should know him longer before you go
away with him. It's not quite the
thing
“Why, wot's wrong with it?” de-
manded Elizabeth, puzzled. “All the
girls I know spends their 'olidays with
their young men, an' then it doesn't
cost them nothink. That's the best of
it. But it's the first time I've ever
been arsked,” she admitted, “an' I
wouldn't lose a charnce like this for
anythink.”
Further appeal was useless, and with
a sigh I resigned myself to the inevit-
able; but when, ten days later, Eliza-
beth departed in a whirl of enthusiasm
and brown paper parcels I turned de-
jectedly to the loathsome business of
housework.
It is a form of labour which above
all others I detest. My métier is to
write—one day I even hope to become
a great writer. But what I never hope
to become is a culinary expert. Should
you command your cook to turn out a
short story she could not suffer more in
the agonies of composition than I do
in making a simple Yorkshire pudding.
My household now passed into a
condition of settled gloom. My nerves
began to suffer from the strain, and I
came gradually to regard Henry as less
of a helpmate and more of a voracious
monster demanding meals at too fre-
quent intervals. It made me peevish
with him.
He too was far from forbearing in
this crisis. In fact we were getting
disillusioned with each other.
One evening I was reflecting bitterly
on matters like washing-up when Henry
came in. Only a short time before we
should have greeted each other cqrdially
in a spirit of camaraderie and affection,
Now our conversation was something
like this:—

Henry (gruffly). Hullo, no signs of
dinner yet! Do you know the time?
Me (snappily). You needn't be so
impatient. I expect you've gorged your-
self on a good lunch in town. Anyhow
it won't take long to get dinner, as we
are having tinned soup and eggs.
Henry. Oh, damn eggs. I'm sick of
the sight of 'em.
You can see for yourself how unre-
strained we were getting. The thin
veneer of civilisation (thinner than ever
when Henry is hungry) was fast wearing
into holes.
The subsequent meal was eaten in
silence. The hay-fever from which I
am prone to suffer at all seasons of the
year was particularly persistent that
evening. A rising irritability engen-
dered by leathery eggs and fostered by
Henry's face was taking possession of
me. Quite suddenly I discovered that
the way he held his knife annoyed me.
Further I was maddened by his manner
of taking soup. But I restrained myself.
I merely remarked, “You have finished
your soup, I hear, love.”
Henry, though feeling the strain, had
not quite lost his fortitude. My hay-
fever was obviously annoying him, but
he only commented, “Don’t you think
you ought to see a doctor about that
distressing nasal complaint, my dear?"
I knew, however, that he was longing
to bark out, “Can't you stop that ever-
lasting sniffing? It's driving me mad,
woman.”
How long would it be before we
reached that stage of candour? I was
brooding on this when the front-door
bell rang.
“You go,” I said to Henry.
“No, you go," he replied. “It looks
bad for the man of the house to answer
the door.”
I do not know why it should look bad
for a man to answer his own door, un-
less he is a bad man. But there are
some things in our English social system
which no one can understand. I rose
and went to open the front-door. Then
my heart leapt in sudden joy. The light
from the hall lamp fell on the lank form
of Elizabeth.
“You’ve come back ' " I exclaimed.
“I suppose you didn't expect to see
me inside of a week,” she remarked.
“I didn't ; but oh, Elizabeth, I'm so
glad to see you,” I said as I drew her
in. Tears that strong men weep rose to
my eyes, while Henry, at this moment
emerging from the study, uttered an ejac-
ulation of joy (it sounded like “Thank
God!”) at the sight of Elizabeth.
“An' 'ow 'ave you got on while I've
bin away?” she inquired, eyeing us both
closely. “Did everythink go orf orl
right?”
I hesitated. How was I to confess

IV.—WHAT's WRoNG with the DRAMA2
13 y Marcus P. Brimston, the gifted producer of “Shoo,
Charlotte '''
I HAVE been invited to say a few words to readers of The
Sabbath Scoop on the alleged decay of the British drama.
There is indeed some apparent truth in this allegation. On
all sides I hear managers sending up the same old wail
of dwindling box-office receipts and houses packed with
ghastly rows of deadheads. No “paper" shortage there,
at any rate.
Sometimes these unfortunate people come to me for
counsel, and invariably I give them the same admonition,
“Study your public.”
There is no doubt that, with a few brilliant exceptions
(among which my own present production is happily en-
rolled), the playhouses have recently struck a rather bad
patch. Useless to lay the blame either on the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequER or on the weather. Give the play-
going public what it wants and no consideration of National
Waste or of Daylight Saving will keep it from the theatre.
And that brings me to my point. Whence comes the
playgoing public of to-day, and what does it want?
From the commercial point of view (and in the long run
as in the short all art must be judged by its monetary
value) the drama depends for its support on what used to
be known as the better-dressed parts of the house. Now-
a-days the majority of the paying patrons of these seats
come from the ranks of the new custodians of the nation's
wealth. These people, who have the business instinct very
strongly developed, insistently and very rightly demand
value for their money; and the problem is how to give
them value as they understand the meaning of the word.
My friend Mr. ARTHUR Collins gives it to them in sand;
but that is a shifting foundation on which to build up a
prosperous run.
Those who, like myself, have studied closely the tastes
and intelligence of this new force that is directing the des-
tiny of the modern theatre must have come to the conclu-
sion that the essential factor in dramatic success is “punch,”
or, as our cross-Atlantic cousins would term it, “pep.”
The day of anaemic characterisation and subtle dissection
of motives is past. The audience (or the only part that
really counts) has no desire to be called upon to think; it
can afford to pay others to do its thinking for it. There is
much to be said for this point of view. The War and its
effects (especially the Excess Profits Duty) have imposed
on us all far too unany and too severe mental jerks; in the
theatre we may well forget that we possess such a thing as
a mind. -
As a charming and gifted little actress said to me only
yesterday, “We want something a bit meatier than the dry
old bones of IBSEN's ghosts.” Well, I am out to provide
that something; my present success certainly does not lack
for flesh.
In producing Shoo, Charlotte / I have taken several hints
from that formidable young rival of the articulate stage
known as the Silent Drama. There effects are flung at the
spectator's head like balls at a cocoanut ; if they fail to
register a hit it is the fault of the shier, not of the nut. My
aim throughout has been to throw hard and true, so that
even the thickest nut is left in no doubt as to the actuality
of the impact. Shoo, Charlotte / makes no high-sounding
| attempt at improving the public taste. As the dramatic
critic of The Sabbath Scoop pithily remarked, it is just “one
long feast of laughter and lingerie,” and its nightly triumph
is the only vindication it requires.
The fundamental mistake of the British drama of to-day
lies, in my humble opinion, in its perpetual striving after
the unexpected. The public, such as I have described it,
fights shy of novel situations; it isn't sure how they ought
to be taken. But give it a play where it knows exactly
what is going to happen next and you are rewarded with
the delighted applause that comes of prophecy fulfilled.
The thrill or chuckle of anticipation is succeeded by the
shudder or guffaw of realisation. Father nudges Mother
and says, “Look, Emma, he 's going to fall into the flour-
bin.” He does fall into the flour-bin, and Father slaps his
own or Mother's knee with a roar of triumph. After all,
the old dramatic formulae were not drawn up without a
profound knowledge of human nature.
Let managers take a lesson from these few observations
and they will no longer go about seeking an answer to the
riddle, “Why did the cocoanut shy?”
THE BEST LAID SCHEMES.
[A contemporary declares that the side-car stands unrivalled as a
matchmaker. It would seem, however, that opinion on the subject is
not unanimous.]
WE motored together, the maiden and I,
And I was delighted to take her,
For, frankly, I wanted my side-car to try
Its skill as a little matchmaker;
Though up to that time I had striven my best,
I'd more than a passing suspicion
The spark I was anxious to light in her breast
Still suffered from faulty ignition.
We started betimes in the promptest of styles
For scenes that were rustic and quiet:
I opened the throttle: we ate up the miles
(A truly exhilarant diet);
Till sharply, as over a common we went,
Gorse-clad (or it may have been heather),
The engine stopped short with a tactful intent
To leave the young couple together.
'Twas instinct (I take it) directing my course
That named as my first occupation
A fruitless endeavour to track to its source
The cause of this sudden cessation ;
And so I had tinkered with tools for a space
Ere I thought of my favourite poet,
And said to myself, “Lo the time and the place
And the loved one in unison ; go it.”
I might have remembered man seldom appears
Alluring in look or in manner
With a smut on his nose, oleaginous ears
And frenziedly clutching a spanner;
Though down by the cycle I fell to my knees
And ported my heart for inspection,
I only received for my passionate pleas
A cult and conclusive rejection.

WAYS AND MEANS.
I HAVE read somewhere that when
and/or if railway fares are increased it
will cost a man travelling with his wife
and two children (the children being
half-fares) as much as twenty pounds
to take third - class return tickets to
St. Ives.
Presumably this refers to the Cornish
St. Ives, and to show how serious the
problem will be for quite large families
I need only refer my readers to the
well-known poetical riddle which is
generally supposed to refer to the
Cornish St. Ives too. It will be seen
cricket-cap on the back of your head
and covered your beard or what not
with one hand; but a constant succes-
sion of people all demanding the same
thing would most certainly cause the
booking-clerk to give way. It might
occur to him besides that, since so many
people insisted on giving their wrong
ages for the pleasure of fighting in war-
time, they had a perfect right to do the
same for the pleasure of travelling in
peace-time; and in the case of the women
his reputation for gallantry would be
imperilled if he had the impudence to
doubt their word.
off just before the terminus, which hurts,
the same objection arises as in the under-
the-seat method; and in any case you
are practically certain to be spotted not
only by the officials of the railway com-
pany concerned but with axle-grease.
It is of course possible to travel with-
out concealment and without a ticket
either, merely discovering with a start
of surprise when you are asked for it
that you have lost the beastly thing.
But this involves acting. It involves
hunting with a great appearance of en-
ergy and haste in all your pockets, your
reticule, your hatband, the turn-ups of
your trousers, The Rescue (for you cer-
at once that in the case of a
septuagamist going to or
returning from St. Ives with
his family the cost will be
vastly greater, even if no
special luggage rates are
leviable for the carriage of
excess cats.
Fortunately there is a
much nearer St. Ives in
Huntingdonshire, and if I
was going to St. Ives at all,
with or without encum-
brances, I should certainly
choose that one. As a mat-
ter of fact the Huntingdon-
shire St. Ives is a very pleas-
ant place indeed, with a lot
of red - and - yellow cattle
standing about, if one may
take the authority of the
County Card Game in these
matters. It is almost as
pleasant as Luton, where
there is a fellow in a blue
smock with side-whiskers
and a reaping-hook, and
Leicester, which consists
solely of a windmill and a
house where RICHARD III.

whole of your note - case,
which proves that you can-
not have been going to stay
at the “Magnificent” after
all, and the envelopes of all
the old letters which you
were taking down to the sea
in the hopes of answering
them there; and even after
that you have to give the
name and address of some-
body you don't like (say
Sir ERIC GEDDEs) to satisfy
the inspector.
On the whole I think the
best way is the one which I
mean to adopt myself at
the earliest opportunity.
Let us suppose that you are
going to Brighton. At Wic-
toria Station you will pur-
chase (1) a return ticket to
Streatham Common, (2) a
platform ticket. The plat-
form ticket entitles you to
walk on to the platform
from which the Brighton
train starts, and, when it is
just moving out and all the

But we are not taking about RAM-
SAY MACDONALD and the County Card
Game; we are talkirg about Sir ERIC
GEDDEs and his railway fares, and talk-
ing pretty sharply too. What is to be
done about this monstrous imposition?
And how are we going to show the
Government that you cannot play about
with ozone as you can with margarine
and coal? If only all passengers were
prepared to act in concert it would be
easy enough to bring Sir ERIC to his
knees. . The best and simplest plan
would be for everybody to ask at the
booking-office for a half-fare, stating
boldly that his or her age was exactly
eleven years and eleven months. It
might not sound very convincing, of
course, even if you had a red-and-black
take up this strong and reasonable line?
I doubt it, and we must turn to the con-
sideration of other economical devices.
One plan which I do not honestly
recommend is travelling under the seats
of the railway compartment, like Paul
Bultitude in Vice Versa. I say this partly
because the accommodation under the
seats is not all that it ought to be,
and even where there is no heating ap-
paratus a tight fit for large families,
and partly because you have to face the
possibility that your tickets may be
demanded on the platform at the other
end. Nor do I favour the method in-
variably adopted by people in cinema
plays, which is to sit on the buffers or
the roofs, or conceal yourself among
the brakes or whatever they are under-
neath the carriages. Unless you drop
tickets have been looked at, you will
leap on board. This brings you to
Brighton, and all you have to do there
is to accost the man who takes the
tickets in a voice hoarse with fury.
“Look here,” you will say, “I had an
important business engagement at
-Streatham Common, worth thousands
and thousands of pounds to me, and
one of your fool porters told me a wrong
platform at Victoria. What are you
going to do about it?” Now you might
think that the porter would reply,
“Come off it, Mister; you don't kid me
like that,” or make some other disap-
pointing and impolite remark; but not
a bit of it. Bluster is the thing that
pays. First of all he will apologise,
and then he will fetch the station-mas-
ter, and he will apologise too, and after

back to Streatham Common, probably
the one the KING uses when he goes to
the seaside. But you will of course
refuse to be pacified and wave it away,
saying, “Useless, absolutely useless.
Now that I am in this awful hole I shall
spend the night here. But I shall cer-
tainly sue your Company for the amount
of the business that I have lost.”
That is what I mean to do, and with
slight variations the ruse can be ap-
plied to almost any non-stop run. Now
that I have given the tip I shall hope
to find quite a little crowd of disap-
pointed business men round the station
exits at holiday time when and or if
railway fares are increased.

THE HYDE PARK Mox UMENT.
DEAR SIR,--The experience of the
Parisian scavenger who recently dis-
covered a crocodile in a dustbin en-
courages me to write to you on a similar
subject. I note with profound dismay
the proposal to turn Hyde Park into a
Zoological Garden. At least this is not
an unfair deduction from the scheme to
instal a huge python in the neighbour-
hood of Hyde Park Corner. I do not
profess to know much about snakes, but
I believe the python is a most danger-
ous reptile, and I see it stated that the |
pythons which have just arrived at
Regent's Park are “large and vigorous,
-
already active and looking for food.”
Surely this monstrous suggestion,
threatening the safety of the peaceful
frequenters of the Park, calls for a na-
tional protest. Can it be that the
PREMIER is at the back of this, as of
every invasion of our rights?
Yours faithfully, MATERFAMILIAs.
P.S.–My son says it is a pylon,
not a python, but that only makes it

STRANGE ExPERIENCE of A HERMIT.
DEAR SIR,-My grandfather, who
died in the 'fifties, used to tell a story of
a hermit who lived in Savernake Forest,
an extraordinarily absent-minded man
with a beard of such colossal dimen-
sions that several of the feathered deni-
zens of the forest took up their abode
in its recesses. This curious pheno-
menon was, I believe, commemorated
in verse by an early-Victorian poet, but
I have not been able after considerable
research to trace the reference. I have
the honour to remain,

DEAR SIR,--The following verses,
though not strictly relevant to the
crocodile incident, commemorate an
occurrence illustrating the extent to
which piscine intelligence can be de-
veloped in favourable circumstances:--

It began to protest
On the ground that the speed was illegal.”

And she said she would, at once.
Eh, well, well! I must not linger
On those glorious halcyon days;

I contested Market Sleeping

THE INCOHERENTS.
The reply of the Soviet Government to the Spa Conference was described by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE as “incoherent ; the sort of
document that might be drawn up by a committee composed of Colonel WEDGwood, Commander KENworTHY, Lord Robert CECIL,
Mr. BottomLEY and Mr. THOMAs.” It is understood that these hon. Members intend to hold an indignation meeting to discuss
means—if any—of refuting this charge.
Monday, July 19th-Opinions may
differ as to the wisdom of the Peers in
reopening the DYER case, but the large
audience which assembled in the gal-
leries, where Peeresses and Indians vied
with one another in the gorgeousness
of their attire, testified to the public
interest in the debate. At first the
speakers made no attempt to “hot up”
their cold porridge. In presenting
General DYER's case Lord FINLAY was
strong without rage. In rebutting it the
UNDER-SECRETARY FOR INDIA proved
himself a grave and reverend SINHA,
without a trace of the provocativeness
displayed by his Chief in the Commons.
Not until the LoRD CHANCELLOR inter-
vened did the temperature begin to rise.
His description of the incident in the
Jullianwallah Bagh was only a little
less lurid than that of Mr. MonTAGU.
The Peers would, I think, have liked a
little more explanation of how an officer
who admittedly exhibited, both before
and after this painful affair, “discretion,
sobriety and resolution,” should be re-
garded as having on this one day com-
mitted “a tragic error of judgment upon
the most conspicuous stage,” and may
have wondered whether, if the stage had
been less conspicuous, the critics would
have been more lenient.
For as long as I can remember the
French have been partant pour la Syrie.
Now they have got there, with a man-
date from the Supreme Council, and
have come into collision with the Arabs.
As we are the friends of both parties
the situation is a little awkward. Mr.
ORMSBY-GoRE hoped we were not going
to fight our Arab allies, and was sup-
ported by Lord WINTERTON, who saw
service with them during the War. A
diplomatic speech by Mr. BonAR LAw,
who pointed out that the French were
in Syria on just the same conditions as
we were in Mesopotamia, helped to
keep the debate within safe limits.
Tuesday, July 20th.--The Lords con-
tinued the DYER debate. Lord MILNER
confessed that he had approached the
subject “with a bias in favour of the
soldier,” and showed how completely he
had overcome it by finally talking about
“Prussian methods"—a phrase that
Lord SUMNER characterised as “facile
but not convincing.” Lord CURzoN
hoped that the Peers would not endorse
such methods, but would be guided by
the example of “Clemency” CANNING.
The Lords however, by 129 to 86, passed
Lord FINLAY's motion, to the effect that
General DYER had been unjustly treated
and that a dangerous precedent had been
established.
The FIRST CoMMIssionER of WoRKS
was inundated with questions about the
pylon and explained that it had been
designed by Sir FRANK BAINEs entirely
on his own initiative. Its submission
to the Cabinet had never been contem-
plated, and its exhibition in the Tea
Room was due to an hon. Member, who
said that a number of people would be
interested. Apparently they were.
Asked if the scheme might be re-
garded as quite dead, Sir ALFRED Mond
replied that he certainly thought so.
In fact, to judge by his previous answer,
it was never really alive.
There is still anxious curiosity re-
garding the increase of railway fares,
but when invited to “name the day.”
Mr. BonAR LAw remained coy. Sug-
gestions for postponements in the in-
terests of this or that class of holiday-
maker finally goaded him into asking

sarcastically, “Why not until after
Christmas?” Whereupon the House
loudly cheered.
Wednesday, July 21st.—Tactful man,
Lord DESBorough. In urging the Gov-
ernment to call a Conference to con-
sider the establishment of a fixed date
for Easter he supported his case with
a wealth of curious information, some
of it acquired from the Prayer-book
tables, as he said, “during the less in-
teresting sermons to which I have
listened.” You or I would have said
“dull" tout court, and in that case we
should not have deserved to receive, as
Lord DESBoRough did, the almost en-
thusiastic support of the Archbishop of
CANTERBURY.
In spite of this Lord ONSLow, for the
Government, was far from encouraging.
He quite recognised the drawbacks of
the movable Easter, and agreed that
it was primarily a matter for the
Churches. But he feared the Noncon-
formists might dissent, and displayed a
hitherto unsuspected reverence for the
opinion of the Armenians. Besides,what
about the Dominions and Labour? And
with Europe in such a state of unrest
ought we to throw in a new apple of
discord? With much regret the Gov-
ernment could not see their way, etc.
Whereupon Lord DESBoRough, who
seems to be easily satisfied, expressed
his gratitude and withdrew his motion.
In an expansive moment Mr. MoRTAGU
once referred to Mr. GANDHI as his
“friend.” He did so, it appears, in the
hope that the eminent agitator would
abandon his disloyal vapourings. But
the friendship is now finally sundered.
Mr. GANDHI has been endeavouring to
organise a boycott of the PRINCE of
WALES’ visit to India, and, as Mr.
MonTAGU observed more in sorrow than
in anger, “Nobody who suggests dis-
loyalty or discourtesy to the Crown can
be a friend of any Member of this
House, let alone a Minister.”
If anyone were to take exception to
the accuracy of some of the PRIME
MINISTER’s historical allusions in his
post-Spa oration he would doubtless
reply, “I don't read history; I make it.”
He was tart with the Turks, gratulatory
to the Greeks, peevish with the Poles
and gentle to the Germans. The Ger-
man CHANCELLOR and Herr von SIMONs
were described as “two perfectly honest
upright men, doing their best to cope
with a gigantic task.” Their country
was making a real effort to meet the
indemnity; it was not entirely respon-
sible for the delay in trying the war-
criminals, and even in the matter of
disarmament was not altogether blame-
worthy. The Bolshevists also were han-
dled more tenderly than usual. Their
reply was “incoherent" rather than
“impertinent”—it might have been
drawn up by a Wedgwood-KENworthy-
CECIL-BottomLEY-Thomas syndicate.
Still they must not be allowed to wipe

A well-informed speech was made by

the Foreign Minister of the first Labour

Bolshevist propaganda will induce the
British proletarian to embrace a creed
under which he would be compelled to

BRYcE and HALDANE, who declared
themselves its friends, were about as

SYDENHAM was frankly sceptical of the
success of a body that had, and could
have, no effective force behind it; and
Lord CURzoN was chiefly concerned to
dispel the prevalent delusion that the

Foreign Office.
The Commons had an equally un-

figured appropriately as the pièce de

endeavour to furnish some lighter re-

The latest news from Belfast suggests
that in the expression of brotherly love
Queen's Island has little to learn from
Nauru. -
A SCENE AT THE CLUB.
I NEVER liked Buttinbridge. I con-
sidered him a vulgar and pushful fellow.
He had thrust himself into member-
ship of my club and he had forced his
acquaintance upon me.
I was sitting in the club smoking-
room the other day when Buttinbridge
came in. His behaviour was character-
istic of the man. He walked towards
me and said in a loud voice, “Cheerioh,
old Sport 1"
I drew the little automatic pistol
with which I had provided myself in
case of just such an emergency, took a
quick aim and fired. Buttinbridge gave
a convulsive leap, fell face downwards
on the hearthrug and lay quite still. It
was a beautiful shot—right in the
heart.
The room was fairly full at the mo-
ment, and at the sound of the shot
several members looked up from their
newspapers. One youngfellow—I fancy
he was a country member recently de-
mobilised—who had evidently watched
the incident, exclaimed, “Pretty shot,
Sir!” But two or three of the older
men frowned irritably and said, “Sh-
sh-sh !”
Seeing that it was incumbent upon
me to apologise, I said, in a tone just
loud enough to be audible to all pre-
sent, “I beg your pardon, gentlemen.”
Then I dropped the spent cartridge
into an ash-tray, returned the pistol to
my pocket and was just stretching out
my hand to touch the bell when old
Withergreen, the doyen of the club,
interposed.
“Pardon me,” he said, “I am a
little deaf, but almost simultaneously
with the fall of this member upon the
hearthrug I fancied I heard the report
of a firearm. May I claim an old man's
privilege and ask if I am right in pre-
suming a connection between the two
occurrences, and, if so, whether there
has been any recent relaxation of our
time-honoured rule against assassina-
tion on the club premises?”
Shouting into his ear-trumpet, I said,
“I fired the shot, Sir, which killed the
member now lying upon the hearthrug.
I did so because he addressed me in a
form of salutation which I regard as
peculiarly objectionable. He called me
Old Sport,' an expression used by
bookmakers and such.”
“Um Old Port 2" mumbled old
Withergreen.
“OLD Sport,” I shouted more loudly.
Then I stepped to the writing-table, took
a dictionary from among the books of
reference, found the place I wanted and
returned to the ear-trumpet.
“I find here,” I said, for the benefit
of the room at large, for all were now

listening, though with some impatience,
“that in calling me a ‘sport' the de-
ceased member called me a plaything,
a diversion. If he had called me a
sportsman, which is here defined as
one who hunts, fishes or fowls,’ he
would have been not necessarily more
accurate but certainly less offensive.”
At this point there stood up a mem-
ber whom I recognised as one of the
committee. “I am sure, Sir," he said,
“that all present are agreed that you
fired in defence of the purity of English
speech, and that the incident was the
outcome of an unfortunate attempt to
relieve the financial embarrassment of
the club by relaxing our former rigorous
exclusiveness. Speaking as one of the
committee, I have no doubt that the
affair will be dismissed as justifiable
homicide.”
Having bowed my acknowledgments
I rang the bell. When the waiter
appeared I bade him “Bring me a
black coffee and then clear away the
remains of Mr. Buttinbridge.”

of Buttinbridge yelling, “Wake up, old

THE PEGULIAR CASE OF TOLLER.
Toller first floated into public notice
on the fame of Rodman, who by an
irony of fate is now all but forgotten.
Rodman, it may be remembered, was a
promising young poet during the first
decade of this century. Out of a scan-
dalous youth whose verses made their
appearance in slim periodicals that ex-
pired before their periodicity could be
computed, he was evolving into a repu-
table poet who was given a prominent
position facing advertising matter in
the heavy magazines when he met with
his regrettably early end. Apart from
his poems he left no literary remains,
except a few letters too hideously un-
grammatical for publication. The sole
materials for a biography lay in the
memory of Toller, who by a stroke of
luck happened to have known him
intimately.
By an equal piece of good fortune
Toller had taken a course of mind train-
ing and his memory was exceptionally
retentive. His Life of IRodman achieved
instant success, a far greater than Rod-
man's Collected Works. The undomes-
ticities of a poet's life naturally excite
greater interest in the cultured than his
utterances on Love, Destiny and other
topics on which poets are apt to dis-
course. Toller, until then a struggling
journalist, became all at once a minor
literary celebrity, much in demand at
conversaziones and places where they
chatter. Sympathy for Rodman aroused
curiosity which only Toller could sat-

isfy. His memory, continually stimu-
lated by questions, gained further in
strength. The more he was asked the
more he remembered, and so on in a
virtuous circle. His Rodmaniana pro-
vided him with a comfortable income.
He removed from Earl's Court to lux-
urious chambers off Jermyn Street, from
which he poured out article after article
on the deceased poet.
Then suddenly, without warning, pro-
bably from overstrain, his memory gave
way. Everything in the past, Rodman
included, vanished from his mind. A
greater calamity one could not conceive.
It was as though a violinist had lost a
hand, a popular preacher his voice. His
livelihood was gone. Much as his babble
about Rodman had bored me I could not
but feel some sorrow for him, fallen from
-
his little pinnacle of fame and affluence.
Judge, then, of my surprise when I
passed him about a fortnight ago fault-
lessly dressed and wearing an air of
great prosperity. He showed of course
not the smallest recollection of me.
“How does Toller manage to live?”
I asked Cardew, who knows him better
than I do.
“He still writes,” was the reply.
“What—without a memory 2”
“Yes, he finds it an advantage. You
see, since the fusion of the old parties
and the formation of new ones, the pos-
session of a memory is often a source
of considerable embarrassment to a
leader writer. Toller now does the
political articles for a prominent morn-
ing paper. The proprietors consider
him a wonderful find.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BUCKLER'S.
To acquire an estate is, even in these
days of inflated prices and competitive
house-hunters, an easy matter com-
pared with finding a name for it when
it is yours. It is then that the real
trouble sets in.
Take the case of my friend Buckler.
A little while ago he purchased a pro-
perty, a few acres on the very top of a
hill not too far from London and only
half-a-mile from his present habitation,
and there he is now building a home.
At least the plans are done and the
ground has been pegged out. “Here,” he
will say, quite unmindful of the clouds
emptying themselves all over us—with
all an enthusiast's disregard for others,
and an enthusiast, moreover, who has
his abode close by, full of changes
of raiment—“here," setting his foot
firmly in the mud, “is where the dining-
room will be. Here," moving away a
few yards through the slush, “is the
billiard-room.” Then, pointing towards
the zenith with his stick, “Above it "
—here you look up into the pitiless sky
as well as the deluge will permit—“are
two spare rooms, one of which will be
yours when you come to see us.” And
so forth.
He then leads the way round the
place, through brake fern wetter than
waves, to indicate the position of the
tennis-courts, and in course of time
you are allowed to return to the dry
and spend the rest of the day in bor-
rowed clothes.
Everyone knows these Kubla Khans
decreeing pleasure domes and enlarging
upon them in advance of the builders,
and never are they so eloquent and un-
mindful of rain and discomforts as when
their listeners are poor and condemned
to a squalid London existence for ever.
But that is beside the mark. It is
the naming of these new country seats
that leads to such difficulties.
That night at dinner the question
arose again.
“As it is on the top of the hill,” said
a gentle wistful lady, “why not call it
‘Hill Top 2 I'm sure I've seen that
name before. It is expressive and
simple.”
“So simple,” said Buckler, “that my
nearest neighbour has already appro-
priated it.”
“I suppose that would be an objec-
tion,” said the lady, and we all agreed.
“Why not,” said another guest, “call
it “The Summit” or, more concisely,
just Summit” ”
“Or why not go further,” said a
frivolous voice, “and suggest hospit-
ality too—and Buckler's hospitality is
notorious—by calling it “Summit-to-
Eat ' 2" -
Our silence was properly contemptu-
ous of this sally. -
“If you didn't like that you might
call it “Summit-to-Drink,’” the frivolous
voice impenitently continued. “Then
you would get all the Americans there
too.”
The voice's glass having been re-
plenished (which, I fancy, was its inner
purpose) we became serious again.
“As it is on the top of the hill,” said
the first lady, “there will probably be
a view. Why not call it, for example,
Bellevue '2 “Bellevue' is a charming
word.”
“A little French, isn't it 2 " someone
inquired.
“Oh, yes, it's French,” she admitted.
“But it's all right, isn't it? It's
quite nice French.”
We assured her that, for a French
phrase, it was singularly free from im-
propriety.
“But of course,” she said, “there's
an Italian equivalent, ‘Bella Vista.'
“Bella Vista' is delightful.”
“I passed a “Bella Vista' in Surbiton
yesterday,” said the frivolous voice," and
an errand-boy had done his worst with
it with a very black lead pencil.”
“What could he do?” the gentle lady
asked wonderingly, with big violet eyes
distended.
“It is not for me to explain,” said
the frivolous voice; “but the final vowel
of the first word dissatisfied him and he
substituted another. The capabilities
of errand-boys with pencil or chalk
should never be lost sight of when one
is choosing a name for a front gate.”
“I am all at sea,” said the lady plain-
tively. Then she brightened. “Is there
no prominent landmark visible from the
new house?” she asked. “It is so high
there must be.”
Our hostess said that by cutting down
two trees it would be possible to see
Windsor Castle.
“Oh, then, do cut them down,” said
the lady, “and call it ‘Castle View."
That would be perfect.”
During the panic that followed Imade
a suggestion. “The best name for it,”
I said, “is ‘Buckler's.' That is what
the country people will call it, and so
you may as well forestall them and be
resigned to it. Besides, it's the right
kind of name. It's the way most of
the farms all over England once were
named—after their owners, and where
the owner was a man of character
and force the name persisted. Call it
“Buckler's' and you will help everyone,
from the postman to the strange guest
who might otherwise tour the neigh-
bourhood for miles searching for you
long after lunch was finished.”
“But isn't it too practical ?” the first
lady asked. “There's no poetry in it.”
“No,” I said, “there isn't. The poetry
is in its owner. Any man who can stand
in an open field under a July rainstorm
and show another man where his bed-
room is to be in a year's time is poet
enough.” E. W. L.
TO ISIS.
Isis, beside thine ambient rill
How oft I've snuffed the Berkshire
breezes,
Or, prone on some adjoining hill,
Thrown off with my accustomed skill
The weekly fytte of polished wheezes;
How oft in summer's languorous days,
With some fair creature at the pole, I
Have thrid the Cherwell's murmurous
ways
And dared with lobster mayonnaise
The onslaughts of Bacillus Coliº
Once—it was done at duty's call—
Mylabouring oarexplored thy reaches;
They said I was no good at all
And coaches noting me would bawl
Things about “angleworms and
breeches;"
But oh! the shouts of heartfelt glee
That rang on thine astonished marges
As we bore (rolling woundily)
Full in the wake of Brasenose III.
And bumped them soundly at the
barges.
That night on Oxenford there burst
A sound of strong men at their revels,
And stroke, in vinous lore unversed,
Retired, if you must know the worst,
On feet that swam at different levels,
Nor knew till morning brought its cares
That, while the cup was freely flowing,
He'd scaled a flight of moving stairs
And commandeered his tutor's chairs
To keep the college bonfire going.
Immortal youth it was that bound
Us twain together, beauteous river;
And, though these limbs just crawl
around
That once would scarcely touch the
ground,
And alcohol upsets my liver,
Still, in a punt or lithe canoe
I can revive my vernal heyday,
Pretend the sky’s ethereal blue,
The golden kingcups' cheery hue,
Spell my, as well as Nature's, May-
day.
The evening glows, the swallow skims
Between the water and the willows;
The blackbirds pipe their eveninghymns,
A punt awaits at Mr. Tims'
With generous tea and lots of pillows,
And of all girls the first, the best
To play at youth with this old fossil;
Then Isis, as we glide to rest
Upon thy shadow-dappled breast,
We'll pledge thee in a generous was-
sail. ALGOL.

ScARGATE.-This famous Yorkshire
Spa is now in a condition of hectic ac-

tions. A recent analysis of the waters
shows that the proportion of sapid ova-
loid particles and sulphuretted trinitro-
toluene is larger than ever. Lieutenant
Platt-Stithers' stincopated anthropoid
orchestra plays four times daily—in the
early morning and at noon for the re-
lief of the water-drinkers, and in the
afternoon and evening in the rotating
Jazz Hall. Special attractions this
week include cinema lectures daily on
the domestic life of the Solomon Is-
landers by Mr. Nicholas Ould ; a recital
on the Bolophone on Thursday by Mr.
Tertius Quodling, and, at the Grand
Opera House, Pope Joan and The Flip-
Flappers. On Saturday the Stridcar
Golf Club will hold a series of compe-
titions in rational fancy dress for the
benefit of the Phonetic Spelling Asso-
ciation.
FALLALMoUTH.—Visitors to this ro-
mantic resort are offered a wide field
of entertainment and moral uplift. The
steamer excursions embrace trips up
the lovely river Fallal to Gongor, famous
for the prehistoric remains of the shrine
of Saint Opodel.doc, and to beauty spots
in the harbour like Glumgallion, Tre-
henna and Pangofflin Creek. There are
also excursions in armed motor-char-à-
bancs to Boscagel, Cadgerack and Flap-
perack. To-day visitors can view the
gardens at Poljerrick, where many
super-tropical plants, including man-
eating cacti, are growing in the most
unbridled luxuriance. There is a fine
sporting nine-hole golf-course on the
shingle strand at Grogwalloe, where
the test of niblick play is more severe
than on any links save those of the
Culbin Sands near Nairn. Among other
attractive features are the brilliant dis-
plays of aurora borealis over the Bay,
which have been arranged at consider-
able cost by the Corporation in conjunc-
tion with the Meteorological Society.
Borecayſ BE.—The demand for bath-
ing-machines and tents continues to in-
crease, though the shopkeepers are com-
plaining of a decreasing spending power
on the part of the visitors and a disin-
clination to pay more than a shilling a
head for shrimps. The practice of dis-
pensing with head-gear is also much
resented by local outfitters, but other-
wise the situation is well in hand. On
Monday last Mr. Silas Pargeter, an old
resident, caught a fine conger-eel, weigh-
ing fifty-six pounds, which he has pre-
sented to the Museum. As Borecambe
is a good jumping-off ground for the Lake
District there are daily char-à-banc
excursions to the land of Wordsworth
and RUskIN, each passenger being sup-
plied with a megaphone and a pea-
shooter. —

THE chime of country steeples,
The scent of gorse and musk,
The drone of sleepy breakers
Come mingled with the dusk;
A ruddy moon is rising

The misty hills grow dimmer,
The last lights blink and die;
Oh, land of home and beauty,
Good-bye, my dear, good-bye!

MY DROMEDARY.
I see by The Times that dromedaries
are on sale at sixty-five pounds apiece.
In these days, when commodities of
all kinds are so expensive, one cannot
afford to overlook bargains of whatever
nature they may be. And it seems to
me that a dromedary at sixty-five
pounds is really rather cheap.
For after all sixty-five pounds to-day
is little more than thirty pounds in pre-
war times. Considering their trifling
cost I am surprised that more people
do not possess dromedaries. Most of
my neighbours during the past two
years have built garages, but not one,
so far as I am aware, has built a drome-
dary-drome.
I think I shall buy one of these attrac-
tive pets if my pass-book encourages
me. Cheaper than a motor-car and
far more intelligent and responsive to
human affection, a dromedary will add
distinction to my establishment and
afford pleasant occupation for my
leisure. It brings no attendant annoy-
ance from the Inland Revenue authori-
ties; there are no tiresome registration
fees or regulations as to the dimensions
of a number-plate.
As long as I can remember I have
lived in a state of uncertainty as to
whether a dromedary has two humps
and a camel one, or a camel two humps
and a dromedary one. With one of
these exotic quadrupeds tethered only
a few yards away from the kitchen door
that condition of doubt need not exist
in the future for more than a few mo-
ments. In a good light it should be
perfectly easy to count the humps or
hump. Then again a dromedary will
come for a walk on a fine evening with-
out involving one in a dog-fight. It will
provide quiet yet healthful exercise for
the two children. If it turns out that
the type possesses two humps it will
be able to convey Edgar and Marigold
at one and the same time, thus saving
delay and inconvenience.
It will be a protection to the house.
When we have gone to bed the faithful
creature will lie on guard in the hall,
and no amount of poisoned liver thrust
through the letter-box will assuage its
ferocity or weaken its determination to
protect the hearth and home of its
master against marauders. For the
dromedary is not only a strict tee-
totaler and non-smoker, but a lifelong
vegetarian. Famous for its browsing
propensities, a dromedary about the
garden will save untold labour and
expense, keeping the lawn trimmed
and the hedges clipped. And indoors
its height will serve me admirably in
enabling me, while seated on its hump
or one of its humps, to attend in com-
fort to a little whitewashing job which
will not brook further postponement.
I will look at my pass-bookto-morrow.

They galloped and they rolled,
They leapt into the air for fun
And felt so brave and bold;
And when they'd done their gallopings
They'd grown four splendid pairs of

The Sun-God fetched them in again
To draw his car of gold;
But you can still see very plain
Where each one leapt and rolled;
For from each hoof-mark, every one,
There sprang a little golden sun,
And that same little golden flower
People call Colt's Foot to this hour.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Not every regiment has the good luck to find for chroni-
cler one who is not only a distinguished soldier but a
practical and experienced man of letters. This fortune is
enjoyed by The Gold Coast Regiment (MURRAY) in securing
for its historian Sir HUGH CLIFFoRD, K.C.M.G., from whose
book you may obtain a vivid picture of a phase of the
Empire's effort about which the average Briton has heard
comparatively little. The very strenuous compaigns of the
G.C.R., the endurance and achievements of its brave and
light-hearted troops, and the heroism and fostering care of
its officers, make an inspiring story. Almost for the first
time one gains some real idea of the difficulties of the East
African campaign, that prolonged tiger hunt, in which
every advantage of mobility, of choice of ground, ambush
and the like lay with the enemy; and over very tough
physical obstacles, as, for example, rivers so variable that,
in the author's incisive phrase, they “can rarely be relied
upon, for very long together, either to furnish drinking-
water or to refrain from impeding transport.” It is inter-
esting to note that Sir HUGH, while giving every credit to
the remarkable personality of the German commander,
entirely demolishes the theory, so grateful to our sentimen-
talists, that the absence of surrenders on the part of the
enemy's black troops was due to any devotion to Won
LETTow-Vorbeck as leader; the explanation being the
characteristic German dodge of creating from the natives a
military caste so highly privileged, and consequently un-
popular with their fellows, that surrender, involving return
to native civilian life, became a practical impossibility.
Much the best part, and a good best, of Sir Harry
(CoLLINs) is the opening, which is not only delightful in
itself but contains almost the sole example of a chapter-long
letter (of the kind usually so unconvincing in fiction) in
which I have found it possible to believe as being actually
written by one character to another. The explanation of
which is that this one is supposed to be sent to his wife by
the new Vicar of Royd, himself a successful novelist, on a
visit of inspection to his future parish. The efforts of Mrs.
Grant, at home, to disentangle essential facts from the
complications of the literary manner form as pleasant and
human an introduction to a story as any I remember. The
story itself is one highly characteristic of its author, Mr.
ARCHIBALD MARSHALL, both in charm and truth to life, as
also in one minor drawback, of which I have taken occasion to
speak before. Nothing could be better done than the picture
of the household at Royd Castle, the boy owner, Sir Harry,
sheltered by the almost too-encompassing care of the three
elder inmates, mother, grandmother and tutor. When the
fictionally inevitable happens and an Eve breaks into this
protected Eden there follow some boy-and-girl love-scenes
that may perhaps remind you—and what praise could be
higher?—of the collapse of another system on the meeting
of Richard and Lucy. I will not anticipate the end of a
sympathetically told story, which I myself should have
enjoyed even more but for Mr. MARSHALL's habit (hinted at
above) of following real life somewhat too closely in the
matter of non-progressive discussion. How I should like
him to lay his next scene in a community of Trappists!
The Haunted Bookshop (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is a daring,
perhaps too daring, mixture of a browse in a second-hand

bookshop and a breathless bustle among international
criminals. To estimate the accuracy of its technical details
the critic must be a secret service specialist, the mustiest
of bookworms and a highly-trained expert in the science
and language of the American advertising business. Speak-
ing as a general practitioner, I like Mr. CHRIstoph ER MoRLEY
best when he is being cinematographic : he hits a very
happy mean with his spies and his sleuths, giving a nice
proportion of skill and error, failure and success, to both.
There is a strong love-interest which will be made much of
and probably spoilt by the purchasers of the film-rights;
and, though strong men will doubtless applaud hoarsely
and women will weep copiously, as the bomb in the book-
shop throws the young lovers into each other's arms, I feel
that the book gives a more attractive portrait of Titania
Chapman, the plutocrat's daughter, than ever can bematerial-
ised in the film-man’s “close-up.” I am afraid that Mr.
MoRLEY will not thank me for praising his brisk melodrama
at the cost of his ramblings in literature. But, if he has
stories about people who live in big country houses, a
subject that seems to have a particular attraction for the
large and ungrudging public which lives in villas. We have
already several novelists who tell them very ably, and I feel
that some one among them has served as Miss ELLA MAc-
MAHON's model. The tale deals with the affairs of a showy
fickle cousin and a silent constant cousin who compete for
the love of the same delightful if rather nebulous young
woman, and moves to its dénouement against a background
of the great War, which Miss MACMAHoN has very sensibly
decided to view entirely from the home front. It contains
some fine thinking and some bad writing (the phrase tell-
ing of the middle-aged smart woman who “waved her foot
impatiently" gives a just idea of the author's occasional
inability to say what she means), some quite extraneous
incidents and some scenes very well touched in. The peo-
ple, with a few exceptions, are of the race which inhabits
this sort of book, and, as we have long agreed with our ||
novelists that “the county" is just like that, I don't see
the knowledge, he lacks
the fragrance; not to put
too fine a point on it, he
is long-winded and tends
to bore in his disquisitions
upon books and bookish-
ness; which is no proper
material for a novelist. The
story is all about America
and is thoroughly Ameri-
can; inevitably therefore
there is some ambitious
word-coining. The only
novelty which sticks in my
memory and earns my
gratitude is the title for
the female Bolshevik, to ||
wit, Bolshevixen.
Wayward and capricious
heroines who marry young
are entitled, I think, to a -
certain amount of intro-
spective treatment by their
authors. Without some
knowledge of their mental
working it is not very easy

for the reader to have patience with them. I was intro-
duced to Anne (HEINEMANN) when she was fifteen, and in
the act of snatching a loaf of bread from a baker's cart and
running away with it merely to annoy the baker; and, as
she had large blue eyes and two young men as self-appointed
guardians, I was prepared for a certain amount of heart
trouble later on. One of these heroes she married at the age
of seventeen, and, after various innocent but compromising
vagaries (including a flight to Paris after the death of her
son in order to study art), she followed the other one, still
innocently, to Ireland, because he had been in prison and
she was sorry for him. Both these guardians discharged
their duty to Anne at least as well as OLGA HARTLEY, who
chronicles but does not explain ; and this is a pity, for
with a rather different treatment she might have made her
heroine a very likeable person. Looked at from another
point of view, Anne may be taken as a mild piece of propa-
ganda against divorce. I am glad it didn't come to that,
of course, but I do feel that a cross-examining K.C. would
have discovered a good deal more about Anne's soul for me
than I learnt from the writer of her story.
John Fitzhenry (MILLS AND Boon) is one of those pleasant

tisement,” but when he made two golfers also flash “trium-

The Golden Bird of Miss DoRothy EASTON (HEINEMANN)
is indeed lucky to set out on its flight with a favouring pat
from Mr. John GALsworthy. He asserts that these short
studies of people and things in England and France are
very well done indeed; that moreover, though the short
sketch may look, and the bad short sketch may be, one of
the easiest of literary feats, the good short sketch is in fact
one of the most difficult. Now who should know this if
not Mr. GALsworthy, and who am I that I should presume
to disagree? As a matter of fact I don't. Quite the con-
trary. But naturally I shall get no credit for that. I will
only add that Miss EASTON has not a majority mind, that
she sees the sad thing more easily than the gay, that I like
her work best in her more objective moods, and that, like so
many writers of perception, she finds the quintessence of
England's beauty in happy Sussex.

82 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 4, 1920.
BADLY SYNGED.
THE scene is the morning-room of the
Smith-Hybrows' South London resi-
dence. It is the day following the final
performance of the Smith-Hybrows'
strenuous season of J. M. SYNGE drama,
undertaken with the laudable intention
of familiarising the suburb with the
real Irish temperament and the works
of the dramatist in question.
Mrs. Smith-Hybrow is seated at the
breakfast-table, her head buried behind
the coffee urn. She is opening her
letters and “keening" softly as she
rocks in her chair.
Mrs. Smith - Hybrow (scanning a
letter). Will I be helping them with the
sale of work? It's little enough the
like of me will be doing for them the
way I was treated at the last Bazaar,
when Mrs. McGupperty and Mrs. Glyn-
Jones were after destroying me with
the cutting of the sandwiches. And
was I not there for three days, from the
rising of the blessed sun to the shining
of the blessed stars, cutting and cutting,
and never a soul to bear witness to the
destroying labour of it, and the two
legs of me like to give way with the
great weariness (keens)? I'll have no
call this year to be giving in to their
prayers and beseechings, and I won't
care the way the Curate will be after
trying to come round me, with his eyes
looking at me the way the moon kisses
the drops of dew on the hedgerows
when the road is white.
[Opens another letter, keening the
while in a slightly higher key.
Enter Gertrude Smith-Hybrow.
She crosses to the window and
stares out.
Gertrude. There are black clouds in
the sky, and the wind is breaking in
the west and making a great stir with
the trees, and they are hitting one on
the other. And there is rain falling,
falling from the clouds, and the roads
be wet.
Mrs. S.-H. It is your mackintosh
you will be wanting when you are after
going to the Stores.
Gertrude (coming to the table and
speaking with dull resentment). And
why should I be going to the Stores
the way I have enough to do with a
meeting of the League for Brighter
Homes and a luncheon of the Cubist
Encouragement Society 2 Isn't it a
queer hard thing that Dora cannot be
going to the Stores, and her with time
enough on her hands surely 2
[Sits in her place and begins keen-
ing. While she has been speaking
Dora has entered hurriedly, but-
toning her jumper.
Dora (vigorously). And is it you,
Gertrude Smith-Hybrow, that will be
talking about me having time on my
hands 2 May the saints forgive you for
the hard words, and me having to cycle
this blessed day to Mrs. Montgomery's
lecture on the Dadaist Dramatists,
and the méringues and the American
creams to be made for to - night's
Tchekoff Conversazione. Is it not
enough for a girl to be destroyed with
the play-acting, and the wind like to be
in my face the whole way and the rain
falling, falling? "
[Sits in her place and keens.
Mrs. S.-H. (after an interval of keen-
ing). Is it your father that will be miss-
ing his train this morning, Dora Smith-
Hybrow?
Dora (rousing herself and selecting
an egg). It is my father that will be
missing his train entirely, and it is his
son that would this minute be sleeping
the blessed daylight away had I not
let fall upon him a sponge that I had
picked out of the cold, cold water.
Gertrude. It is a flapper you are, Dora
Smith-Hybrow.
Dora. It is a flapper you will never
be again, Gertrude Smith-Hybrow,
though you be after doing your queer
best to look like one.
Mrs. S.-H. Whisht ! Is it the time
for loose talk, with the wind rising,
rising, and the rain falling, falling, and
the price of butter up another three-
pence this blessed morning 2
[They all three recommence keen-
ing. Enter Mr. Smith-Hybrow
followed by Cyril.
Mr. S.-H. (staunching a gash in his
chim). Is it not a hard thing for a man
to be late for his breakfast and the rain
falling, falling, and the wind rising,
rising. It's destroyed I am with the
loss of blood and no food in my stomach
would keep the life in a flea.
[Sits in his place and opens his
letters savagely. Cyril, a cada.
verous youth, stares gloomily into
the depths of the marmalade.
Cyril (dreamily). There's gold and
gold and gold—caverns of gold. And
there's a woman with hair of gold and
eyes would pick the locks of a man's
soul, and long shining hands like pale
seaweed. Is it not a terrible thing that
a man would have to go to the City
when there is a woman with gold hair
waiting for him in the marmalade pot
—waiting to draw him down into the
cold, cold water 2
Dora. Is it another spongeful you
are wanting, Cyril Smith-Hybrow, and
myself destroyed entirely waiting for
the marmalade 2
[Cyril blushes, passes the mar-
malade, sits down languidly and
selects an egg. Mrs. S.-H. pours
out the coffee and resumes her
keening.
Mr. S.-H. (glaring at her). Is it not
a nice thing for the wife of a respect-
able City stockbroker to sit at the
breakfast-table making a noise like that
of a cow that is waiting to be milked 2
Mrs. S.-H. (hurt). It is keening I
all In.
Gertrude (passing him “The Morning
Post"). Is it not enough that the price
of butter is up another threepence this
blessed day, and the wind rising, rising,
and the rain falling, falling?
Mr. S.-H. It is destroyed we shall all
be entirely.
-Cyril (gazing into the depths of his
egg). There was a strange queer dream
I was after having the night that has
gone. It was on the rocks I was . .
Mr. S.-H. (glaring at the market
reports). It is on the rocks we shall
all be.
Cyril. . . . . on the rocks I was by
the sea-shore . . .
Dora (slightly hysterically). With
the wind rising, rising?
Cyril (nodding). . . . and the rain
falling, falling. And a woman of the
chorus drove up in a taxi, and the man
that had the driving of it was eating
an orange. The woman came and sat
by the side of me, and the peroxide in
her hair made it gleam like the pale
gold coins that were in the banks be-
fore the Great War (more dreamily).
Never a word said she when I hung a
chain of cold, cold sausages about her
neck, but her eyes were shining, shin-
ing, and into my hands she put a tin
of corned beef. And it is destroyed I
was with the love of her, and would
have kissed her lips but I saw the
park-keeper coming, coming out of the
sea for tickets, and I fled from the
strange queer terror of it, and found
myself by a lamp-post in Hackney
Wick with the wind rising, rising, and
the rain falling, falling.
[He stops. The others stare at
him and at one another in piteous
inquiry. The women begin kecn-
ing. Mr. S.-H. seizes the re-
maining egg and cracks it vici-
ously.
Mr. S.-H. (falling back in his chair).
Damnation |
[The air is filled with a pungent
matter-of-fact odour. Dora, hold-
ing her handkerchief to her nose,
rushes valiantly at the offender
and hurls it out of the window
on to a flower-bed. The SYNGE
spell is broken.
Mr. Punch begs to thank the seven
hundred and forty-three correspondents
who have so thoughtfully drawn his
attention to the too familiar fact that
“there's many a slip 'twixt the Cup
and the LIPTON.”

AMONG the literary and artistic trea-
sures of American collectors the manu-
script of LAMB's essay on Roast Pig is
eminent. I have seen this rarity, which
is now in the strong room where Mr.
PIERPONT MoRGAN keeps his autographs
safe equally from fire and from theft–
if not from the desire to thieve. Much
did I covet in this realm of steel, and
LAMB's MS. not least. The essay occu-
pies both sides of large sheets of fools-
cap, written in a minute hand, with very
few corrections, both the paper and
the time occupied in transcription, if
not also in actual composition, being,
I should guess, the East India Com-
pany's. It is not, I imagine, the first
draft, but the first fair copy after all the
changes had been made and the form
was fixed; and its author, if he is in
any position to know what is going for-
ward on a planet which he left some
six-and-eighty years ago, must have
been amused when he heard that so
much money—thousands and thousands
of dollars—had been given for it at
auction the other day.
Reading the essay again, in the faded
ink on the yellowing paper, I realised
once more that everything that can be
said about little pigs, dead and ripe for
the eater, had been said here and said
finally. But the living? That very
evening I was to find little live pigs
working for their maintenance under
conditions of which I had never dreamed,
in an environment less conducive, one
would suppose, to porcine activity than
any that could be selected.
It was at Coney Island, that aston-
ishing permanent and magnified Earl's
Court Exhibition, summer Blackpool
and August-Bank-Holiday-Hampstead-
Heath, which New York supports for its
beguilement. In this domain of switch-
backs and chutes, merry-go-rounds and
shooting -galleries, dancing - halls and
witching waves, vociferous and crowded
and lit by a million lamps, I came sud-
denly upon the Pig Slide and had a new
conception of what quadrupeds can do
for man.
The Pig Slide, which was in one of
the less noisy quarters of Luna Park,
consisted of an enclosure in which stood
a wooden building of two storeys, some
five yards wide and three high. On the
upper storey was a row of six or eight
cages, in each of which dwelt a little
live pig, an infant of a few weeks. In
the middle of the row, descending to
the ground, was an inclined board, with
raised edges, such as is often installed
in swimming - baths to make diving
automatic, and beneath each cage was a
hole a foot in diameter. The spectators
and participants crowded outside the en-
closure, and the thing was to throw balls,
which were hired for the purpose, into
the holes. Nothing could exceed the
alert and eager interest taken by the
little pigs in the efforts of the ball-
throwers. They quivered on their little
legs; they pressed their little noses
against the bars of the cages; their
little eyes sparkled; their tails (the only
corkscrews left in America) curled and
uncurled and curled again: and with
reason, for whereas, if you missed—as
was only too easy—nothing happened,
if you threw accurately the fun began,
and the fun was also theirs.
This is what occurred. First a bell
rang and then a spring released the
door of the cage in mediately over the
hole which your ball had entered, so
that it swung open. The little pig
within, after watching the previous in-
firmity of your aim with dejection, if not
contempt, had pricked up his ears on
the sound of the bell, and now smiled
a gratified smile, irresistible in infec-
tiousness, and trotted out, and, with the
smile dissolving into an expression of

ALL alone I went a-walking by the London Docks one day,
For to see the ships discharging in the basins where they
lay;
And the cargoes that I saw there they were every sort and
kind,
Every blessed brand of merchandise a man could bring to
mind;
There were things in crates and boxes, there was stuff in
bags and bales,
There were tea-chests wrapped in matting, there were
Eastern-looking frails,
There were baulks of teak and greenheart, there were stacks
of spruce and pine, -
There was cork and frozen carcasses and casks of Spanish
wine, -
There was rice and spice and cocoa-nuts, and rum enough
was there - - -
For to warm all London's innards up and leave a drop to
spare; -
But of all the freights I found there, gathered in from far
and wide, - -
All the smells both nice and nasty from the Pool to Barking-
side,
All the harvest of the harbours from Bombay to Montreal,
There was one that took my fancy first and foremost of
them all;
It was neither choice nor costly, it was neither rich nor
l'are
And, in most ways you can think of, it was neither here
nor there, -
It was nothing over-beautiful to smell nor yet to see—
Only bags of stuffy nitrate—but it meant a lot to me.
I forgot the swarming stevedores, I forgot the dust and din,
And the rattle of the winches hoisting cargo out and in,
And the rusty tramp before me with her hatches open
wide,
And the grinding of her derricks as the sacks went overside;
I forgot the murk of London and the dull November sky—
I was far, ay, far from England, in a day that's long
gone by.
I forgot the thousand changes years have brought in ships
and men,
And the knots on Time's old log-line that have reeled away
since then, -
And I saw a fast full-rigger with her swelling canvas spread,
And the steady trade-wind droning in her royals overhead,
Fleecy trade - clouds on the sky - line—high above the
Tropic blue—
And the curved arch of her foresail and the ocean gleaming
through ;
I recalled the Cape Stiff weather,
seemed to freeze,
And the trampling, cursing watches and the pouring,
pooping seas,
And * on spar and jackstay, and the cracking, volleying

And the tatters of our voices blowing down the roaring

ROSES ALL THE WAY.
FIRED by an Irish rose-grower's pictures of some of his
beautiful new seedlings we are tempted to describe one or
two of our own favourite flowers in language similar to
his own. This is an example of the way he does it:-
“LADY MAUREEN STEwART (Hybrid Tea).--A gloriously-finished
globular slightly imbricated cupped bloom with velvety black scarlet
cerise shell-shaped petals, whose reflex is solid pure orangey maroon
without veining. An excellent bloom, ideal shape, brilliant and non-
fading colour with heavy musk rose odour. Erect growth and flower-
stalk. Foliage wax and leathery and not too large. A very flori-
ferous and beautiful rose. 21s. each.” -
Why not also these?— - -
DAVID (Hybrid Tory-Lib.).—A gloriously-finished true-
blue-slightly-imbricated-with-red-flag coalition rose whose
deep globular head with ornate decorative calyx retains its
perfect exhibition-cross-question-hostile-amendment sym-
metry of form without blueing or burning in the hottest
Westminster sun. Its smiling peach and cerise endear-
ments terminating in black scarlet shell-shaped waxy Berlin
ultimata are carried on an admirably rigid peduncle. Equally
vigorous in all parts of Europe. Superbly rampant. Not
on sale.
AUSTEN (Tea and most other things).-This bottomless-
cupped bank-paper-white-edged-and-rimined - with - tape-
pink-margin bloom, the reflex of whose never-fading demand
notes is velvety black thunder-cloud with lightning-flash
six-months-in-the-second-division veinations, has never been
known to be too full. It is supported by a landlordly stalk
of the utmost excess - profits - war - profits - minor-profits
rigidity. A decorative, acquisitive and especially captivat-
ing rose, and already something more than a popular
favourite. 18s. in £1.
SIR THOMAs (Ceylon and India Tea),—This true sport
from the British bull-dog rose has a slightly globular
double-hemisphere-popular greatly-desiring-and-descrving-
to-be-cupped bloom whose pearly preserved-cream flesh is
delicately flushed and mottled with tinned salmon and dried
apricot. Rich golden and banking-account stamina, foliage
deep navy blue with brass buttons and a superb fragrance
of western ocean. Its marvellous try-try-try-again florifer-
ousness in all weathers is the admiration of all beholders.
Price no object. -
From a weather forecast :—
“General Outlook.-It appears probable that further expressions will
arrive from the westward or north-westward before long, and that
after a temporary improvement the weather will again become um-
settled, with much cloud and occasional rain.”—Evening Paper.
In which event further expressions (of a sultry character)
may be expected from all round the compass.

QUEEN'S COUNSEL.
The Fairy Queen shook her head in
answer to my question. “No," she
said, “I have no favourite flower.”
She had dropped in after dinner, as
was her occasional habit, and at the
moment sat perched on a big red carna-
tion which stood in a flower-glass on
the top of my desk.
“You see,” she continued, floating
across to where I was sitting and lower-
ing her voice confidentially, for there
were a good many flowers about—“you
see it would never do. Just think of
the trouble it would cause. Imagine
the state of mind of the lilies if I were
to show a preference for roses. There's
always been a little jealousy there, and
they're all frightfully touchy. The
artistic temperament, you know. Why,
I daren't even sleep in the same flower
two nights running.”
“Yes, I see,” I said.
very awkward.”
I lapsed into silence; I had had a
worrying day and was feeling tired and
a little depressed. The Queen fluttered
about the room, pausing a moment on
the mantel-shelf for a word or two
with her old friend the Dresden china
shepherdess. Then she came back to
the desk and performed a brief pas seul
on the shining smooth cover of my
pass-book. My mind flew instantly to
my slender bank-balance and certain
recent foolishnesses.
“Talking of favourites,” I said—
“talking of favourites, do you take any
interest in racing 2"
Instantly the Queen subsided on to
my rubber stamp damper, which was
fortunately dry.
“Oh, yes,” she replied, “I take a
great interest in racing. I love it. I
can give you all sorts of hints.”
I thought it was a pity she hadn't
called a week or two earlier. I might
have been a richer woman by a good
many pounds.
“And there are so many kinds,”
continued the Queen earnestly. “Now
in a butterfly race it's always best just
to hold on and let them do as they like.
It's not a bit of use trying to make
them go straight. Rabbits are better in
that way, but even rabbits are a little
uncertain at times. Full of nerves.
But have you ever tried swallow-
racing 2" she went on enthusiastically.
“It's simply splendid. You give them
their heads and you never know where
you may get to. But, anyway, it
doesn't really matter in the least after-
wards who wins; it's only while it's
happening that you feel so thrilled,
isn't it 2 ''
I didn't acquiesce very whole-heart-
edly. I'm afraid my thoughts were
“It must be
with my lost guineas. It had rather
mattered aſterwards, I really had been
very foolish.
“You look depressed,” said the Fairy
Queen. “Can I help you? I'm really
extremely practical. You know, don't
you,” she leaned forward and looked
at me earnestly, “that I should be de-
lighted if I could assist you with any
advice 2''
I hesitated. Just before she came I
had been anxiously considering as to
how I was going to make one hundred
pounds do the work of two during the
next few weeks; but somehow I didn't
quite like to mention such material
matters to the Queen; it didn't seem
suitable.
I looked up and met her kind eyes
fixed on mine with an expression of the
gentlest interest and solicitude.
“I wonder,” I said, still hesitating,
“whether you know anything about
stocks and shares?” "
“Stocks and shares,” she repeated
slowly, looking just a little vague and
puzzled. And then—“Oh, yes, of
course I do, if that's all you want to
know.” -
I felt quite pleased now that I had
really got it out.
“If you could just give me a useful
hint or two I should be tremendously
grateful,” I said. Already thousands
loomed entrancingly beforeme. Already
I saw myself settled in that darling
cottage on the windy hill above Dac-
combe Wood. Already
“I think I had better get a pencil
and paper,” I said. “My memory 's
dreadful."
But the Fairy Queen shook her head.
“I’ll write it down for you,” she
said, “and you can read it when I'm
gone. That's so much more fun. But
I don't need paper.”
She drew a tiny shining implement
from her pocket and, picking up a
couple of rose-petals which had fallen
upon the table, she busied herself with
them for a moment at my desk, her
mouth pursed up, her brows contracted
in an expression of intense seriousness.
“There,” she said, “that 's that. And
now show me all your new clothes.”
We spent quite a pleasant evening
over one thing and another, and I
forgot all about the rose-leaves until
after she had gone; but when I came
back to my empty sitting-room they
shone in the dusk with a soft radi-
ance which came, I discovered, from
the writing on them. It glowed like
those luminous figures on watches
which were so entrancing when they
first appeared. I had never realised
before that they were fairy figures.
I spread the petals out on my palm,
feeling quite excited at the prospect of
making my fortune by such means,
though I was a little anxious as to how
I was going to make use of the infor-
mation I was about to acquire.
“I will ask Cousin Fred,” I decided
(Cousin Fred being a stockbroker), and
I smiled a little to myself as I thought
how amazed and possibly amused my
dapper cousin would be when he learnt
the source of my knowledge. He might
even refuse to believe in it—and then
where should I be 2
I needn't have troubled. When I
unfolded my rose-petals this is what I
read :-
“Socks.-The white ones are much
the best and have by far the sweetest
scent. -
Shares.—Always go shares.” R. F.
HEART OF MINE.
(Being a rather hysterical contribution
from our Analytical Novelist.)
Friday.—I suppose one never realises
till one is actually dead how nearly dead
one can be without actually being it.
You see what I mean 2 No. Well, how
blithely, how recklessly one rollicks
through life, fondly believing that one
is in the best of health, in the prime of
condition, and all the time one is the
unconscious victim of some fatal in-
firmity or disease. I mean, take my
own case. I went to see my doctor in
order to be cured of hay fever. He ex-
amined my heart. He made me take
off my shirt. He hammered my chest;
he rapped my ribs with his knuckles
to see if they sounded hollow. I don't
know why he did this, but I think he
was at one time attached to a detective
and has got into the habit of looking
for secret passages and false panels and
SO On.
Anyhow, he suspected my chest, and
he listened at it for so long that any
miscreant who had been concealed in
it would have had to give himself away
by coughing or blowing his nose.
After a long time he said, “Your
heart's dilated. You want a complete
rest. Don't work. Don't smoke. Don't
drink. , Don't eat. Don't do anything.
Take plenty of exercise. Sit perfectly
still. Don't mope. Don't rush about.
Take this before and after every meal.
Only don't have any meals.” I laughed
at him. I knew my heart was perfectly
sound, much sounder than most men's.
I went home. I didn't even have the
prescription made up.
Saturday-Now comes the tragic
thing. That rery night I realised that
he was right. There is something
wrong with my heart. It is too long.
It is too wide. It is too thick. It is
out of place. It would be difficult to
say exactly where the measurements

Sunday.—The way it beats! Some-
times very fast and heavy and em-

tunately my watch has a second-hand,
so that I can time it—forty-five to the
half-minute, ninety-five to the full
minute. Then I know that the end is
very near ; everyone knows that the
normal rate for a healthy adult heart is
seventy-two. Then sometimes it goes
very slow, very dignified and faint, as
when some great steamer glides in at
slow speed to her anchorage, and the
engines thump in a subdued and pro-
found manner very far away, or as when
at night the solemn tread of some huge
policeman is heard, remote and soft and

Monday.—How was it, I wonder, that

And now what am I to do? I am a
doomed man. With a heart like this
I cannot last long. I have resigned
my clubs; I have given up my work.
I can think of nothing but this dull
pain, this heavy throbbing at my side.
My work—ha! Yesterday I met another
young doctor at tea. He asked me if
there was any “murmur.” I said I did
not know—no one had told me. But
after tea I went away and listened.
Yes, there was a murmur; I could hear
it plainly. I told the young doctor.
He said that murmurs were not con-
sidered so important nowadays. What
matters is “the reaction of the heart
to work.” By that test I am doomed
indeed. But the murmur is better.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, July 26th.-When the Peers
were about to discuss the Law of Pro-
perty. Bill, which seeks to abolish the
distinction between land and other
property, Lord CAVE dropped a bomb-
shell into the Committee by moving to
omit the whole of Part I. Lords HAL-
DANE and BUCKMASTER were much upset
and loudly protested against the pro-
posal to cut out “the very heart
and substance of the measure.” The
LoRD CHANCELLOR was less perturbed
by the explosion and was confident
that after further discussion he could
induce the CAVE-dwellers to come into
line with modern re- -
quirements. Thirty-four
clauses thus disappeared
with a bang ; and of the
hundred and odd remain-
ing only one gave much
trouble. Objection was
taken to Clause 101,
granting the public full
rights of access to com-
mons, on the grounds in-
teralia that it would give
too much freedom to gip-
sies and too little to
golfers. Lord SALISBURY,
who, like the counsel
in a famous legal story,
claimed to “know a little
about manors,” was sure
that only the lord could
deal faithfully with the
Egyptians, but, fortified
by Lord HALDANE's assur-
ance that the clause gave
the public no more rights
and the lords of the
manor no less than they
had before, the House
passed it by 42 to 29.
Mr. BRIDGEMAN, for
the Board of Trade, bore
the brunt of the early
questioning in the House of Commons.
He sustained with equal imperturba-
bility the assaults of the Tariff Re-
formers, who asserted that British toy-
making—an “infant industry” if ever
there was one — was being stifled by
foreign imports; and those of the Free
Traders, who objected to the Govern-
ment's efforts to resuscitate the dyeing
trade.
The alarming rumours in the Sunday
papers about the PRIME MINISTER's
state of health were effectually dis-
pelled by his appearance on the Front
Opposition, a little weary-looking, no
doubt, but as alert as ever to seize the
weak point in an adversary's case and
to put his own in the most favourable
light. From the enthusiasm of his an-
nouncement that the Soviet Govern-
ment had accepted our invitation to
attend a Conference in London, one
would have thought that the Bolshev-
ists had agreed to the British proposals
unconditionally and that peace—“that
is what the world wants"—was now
assured. -- - - -
Abhorrence of the Government of
Ireland Bill is the one subject on which
all Irishmen appear to think alike. It
is, no doubt, with the desire to preserve
that unanimity that the PRIME MINIs-
TER announced his intention of pressing
the measure forward after the Recess
“with all possible despatch.”
But before that date it looks as if
Irishmen would have despatched one
David. “You KNow THE RHYME, GRANDMAMMA, THAT SAYS –
‘THIS LITTLE PIG WENT TO MARKET,
AND THIS LITTLE PIG STAYED AT Home'?”

another. The little band of Nationalists
had handed in a batch of private-notice
Questions arising out of the disturbances
in Belfast. Their description of them as
the outcome of an organised attack upon
Catholics was indignantly challenged
by the Ulstermen, and the SPEAKER had
hard work to maintain order. The con-
test was renewed on a motion for the
adjournment. As a means of bringing
eace to Ireland the debate was abso-
lutely futile. But it enabled Mr.
DEVILIN to fire off one of his tragical-
comical orations, and Sir H. GREEN wood
to disclaim the accusation that he had
treated the Irish problem with levity.
“There is nothing light and airy about
me,” he declared; and no one who has
heard his pronunciation of the word
“Belfast " would doubt it.
Before and after this melancholy
interlude good progress was made with
the Finance Bill, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
made several further concessions to the
“family-man.” - -
Tuesday, July 27th.-The Lords re-
jected the Health Resorts and Watering |
Places Bill under which local author-
ities could have raised a penny rate for
advertising purposes. Lord South-
wARK's well-meant endeavour to sup-
port the Bill by reminding the House
that Irish local authorities had enjoyed
this power since 1909 was perhaps the
proximate cause of its defeat, for it can
hardly be said that the last few weeks
have enhanced the reputation of Ireland
as a health resort.
. Mr. HARMsworth ut-
terly confounded the cri-
tics of the Passport Office.
Its staff may appear pre-
posterously large and its
methods unduly dilatory,
but the fact remains that
it is one of the few public
departments that actu-
ally pays its way. Last
year it spent thirty-seven
thousand pounds and
took ninety - one thou-
sand pounds in fees. “See
the world and help to pay
for the War” should be
the motto overits portals.
It is, of course, quite
proper that soldiers who
wreck the property of
civilians — albeit under
great provocation –
should receive suitable
punishment. But a sailor
is hardly the man to press
for it. Lieutenant-Com-
mander KENworTHY re-
ceived a much-needed
lesson in etiquette when
Major JAMESON gravely
urged, in his penetrating
Scotch voice, that soldiers in Ireland
should be ordered not to distract the
prevailing peace and quiet of that coun-
try, but should keep to their proper
function of acting as targets for Sinn
Fein bullets.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN dealt very gingerly
with Sir ARTHUR FELL's inquiry as to
whether “any ordinary individual can
understand the forms now sent out by
the Income Tax Department?” Fear-
ing that if he replied in the affirmative
he would be asked to solve some par-
ticularly abstruse conundrum, he con-
tented himself with saying that the
forms were complicated because the
tax was complicated, and the tax was
complicated because of the number and
variety of the reliefs granted to the tax-
payer. It does not seem to have oc-

curred to him that it is the duty of the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER to
make the tax simple as well as equitable.
Is it conceivable that he can have for-
gotten ADAM SMITH's famous maxims
on the subject, and particularly this:
“The time of payment, the manner of
payment, the quantity to be paid, ought
all to be clear and plain to the contri-
butor, and to every other person " ?
The House did not rise till half-past
one this morning, and was again faced
with a long night's work. In vain Sir
DoNALD MACLEAN protested against the
practice of taking wee sma' Bills in the
wee sma' oors. Mr. BoNAR LAW was
obdurate. He supposed the House had
not abandoned all hope of an Autumn
recess. Well, then, had not the poet
said that the best of all ways to lengthen
our days was to steal a few hours from
the night?
The Report stage of the Finance Bill
was finished off, but not until the
Government had experienced some
shocks. The Corporation tax, intended
partially to fill the yawning void which
will be caused some day by the dis-
appearance of E.P.D.—on the principle
that one bad tax deserves another—was
condemned with equal vigour, but for
entirely different reasons, by Colonel
WEDGwood and Sir F. BANBURY. They
“told" together against it and had the
satisfaction of bringing the Govern-
ment majority down to fifty-five.
The champions of the Co-operative
Societies also put up a strong fight
against the proposal to make their
profits, for the first time, subject to
taxation. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN declined,
however, to put them in a privileged
position as compared with other traders,
but carried his point only by sixty-one
votes.
Wednesday, July 28th.-In spite of
the limitation of Questions the Member
for Central Hull still manages to ex-
tract a good deal of information from
the Treasury Bench. This afternoon
he learned from Mr. LONG that the
Board of Admiralty was not created
solely for the purpose of satisfying his
curiosity; and from Mr. KELLAway
that the equipment of even the most
versatile Under-Secretary does not in-
clude the gift of prophecy.
At long last the House learned the
Government decision regarding the in-
crease in railway fares. It is to come
into force on August 6th, by which time
the most belated Bank-Holiday-maker
should have returned from his revels.
Mr. BonAR LAw appended to the an-
nouncement a surely otiose explana-
tion of the necessity of the increase.
Everybody knows that railways are
being run at a loss, due in the main to
the increased wages of miners and rail-
way-men. Mr. Thomas rather weakly
submitted that an important factor was
the larger number of men employed,
and was promptly met with the retort
that that was because of the shorter
hours worked.
Cheered by the statement of its
Leader that he still hoped to get the
adjournment by August 14th the House
plunged with renewed zest into the final
stage of the Finance Bill. Mr. Bot-
ToMLEY, whose passion for accuracy is
notorious, inveighed against the lack of
this quality in the Treasury Estimates.
As for the war-debt, since the Govern-
ment had failed to “make Germany
pay,” he urged that the principal burden
should be left for posterity to shoulder.
These sentiments rather shocked Mr.
Asquith, who, while mildly critical of
Government methods, was all in favour
of “severe, stringent, drastic taxation.”
MR. BONAR LAW PACKS HIS TRUNKS.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN repeated his now fa-
miliarlecture to the House of Commons,
which, while accusing the Government
of extravagance, was always pressing
for new forms of expenditure. In the
study of economy he dislikes abstrac-
tions—except from the pockets of the
taxpayer.
“Company's water is on to the house and
cowshed.”—Advert. in Daily Paper.
Now we know why our water is some-
times contaminated with milk.
“One of the most striking of the collection
of exhibits of fascinating interest [at the
Imperial War Museum] is the Air Force map
for carrying out the British plan for bombing
Berlin. Specimens of the bombs, weighing
3,000 pounds each, are also included in this

THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.
I west into the morning-room with
a worried frown upon my brow. Kath-
leen was doing the accounts at the
table.
“Kathleen,” I said, “it’s Veronica's
birthday on Wednesday and—”
“What did you say seven eighths
were 2" said Kathleen. “I asked you
last week.”
“I can't possibly carry complicated
calculations in my head from week to
week,” I said; “you should have made
a note of it at the time. It's Veronica's
birthday on Wednesday, and what do
you think she wants?”
But Kathleen was enthralled by the .
greengrocer's book. “Have we really
had eight cabbages this week 2 " she
said. “We must, I suppose. Green-
grocers are generally homest; they live
so near to nature. Well, now,” she
shut up her books, “what were you
saying, dear?”
I sighed, cleared my throat and began
again. “It's Veronica's birthday on ,
Wednesday, and what do you think she
wants 2 She wants,” I said dramatic-
ally, “a “frush ’ from the bird-sinop in
the village. The ones that hang in
cages outside the door.”
“Well,” said Kathleen, “why not ?”
“Why not ?” I became more than
serious. “A daughter of ours has de-
manded for a plaything a caged bird.
Psychologically it is an important oc-
casion. Now or never must she learn
to look upon a caged bird with horror.
What I am thinking of is the psycho-
logical effect upon the child's character.

“You needn't worry about Veronica's
psychology,” said Kathleen. “Veron-
ica's psychology is in the right place.”
“You misunderstand the meaning of
the word,” I said loftily. “IIowever,
if you wish to wash your hands of
Veronica's training, if you refuse to
cope with your own child, I must take
it upon myself.”
“Do,” said Kathleen sweetly; “I’ll
listen.”

It was Veronica's birthday. We were
outside the bird-shop. The thrushes
in cages hung around the door.
Veronica liſted grave blue eyes to me
trustingly. “You promised me a frush,
darlin’,” she said.
Veronica is small for her name and
has a disarming habit of introducing
terms of endearment into her conver-
sation.
“You didn't quite understand me,” I
said gently. “I said I'd think about it.”
“Yes, but that means promising,
doesn't it? Finking about it means pro-
mising. I fought you meant promising.

VADE MECUMS.
I HAVE invented a new sort of
patience. It is called Wade Mecums.
The rules are quite simple and all the
plant you need for it is a “Wade Mecum”
traveller's handbook and a complete
ignorance of all languages but your
own. Get one of these fascinating
little classics, a passport and a single
to Boulogne, and you can begin at
Once.
The game consists in firing off (in
the local lingo) every single phrase that
occurs in the book. The only other
rule in the game is that the occasion
for making each remark must be rea-
sonably apposite. You need not keep
to the order in the book and no points
are awarded for pronunciation, provided
that the party addressed shows by word
or deed that he (or she) has understood
you. By way of illustration I will give
some account of my first experiments
in this enthralling pastime.
As it happened I was able to start at
once—too soon, in fact, to be altogether
comfortable. We had scarcely put
out from Folkestone before I got my
chance. The sea was distinctly rough,
but I just had time to open my Wade
Mecum at page 228 (sub-heading, “On
embarking and what happens at sea "),
and to read to a passing French
steward the first sentence that caught
my eye. It was as follows: “The wind
is very violent; the sea is very rough ,
the waves are very high , the rolling of
the vessel makes iny head ache; I am
very much inclined to be sick.”
After that I made no more progress
till we reached Boulogne; but from
the steward's subsequent actions I
judged that he had understood; so I
was one up.
My Wade Mecum, like most of its
kind, was unfortunately compiled many
years ago and had never been brought
up to date. This, of course, saved me
the expense of having to hire aero-
planes or even motor-cars, but it landed
me in quite a number of difficulties at
the opposite extreme, as you will see.
For instance, in order to polish off
the heading, “Of what may happen on
the road,” I was compelled to obtain a
carriage. Judge then my joy when, on
reaching a carriage builder's, I dis-
covered a whole section tucked away
in a corner of the book dealing exclu-
sively with that very topic. I can
think of no other conceivable circum-
stances under which I could have said,
“The wheels are in a miserable state;
the body is too heavy; the springs are
too light; the shafts are too short; the
pole is too thin; the shape is altogether
old-fashioned, and the seats are both
high and uncomfortable.”
Yet now I said it all—in two halves,
it is true, and in two different shops;
but still I said it all. The first half
cost me three front teeth, which fell
out while the outraged carrossier was
ejecting me; the second cost me a
large sum of money, because somehow
or other I found -I had bought the
vehicle in question. This I fancy must
have been occasioned by my turning
over two pages at once, so that I sup-
pose I really said, “Mr. X., you are an
honest man; I will give you ten thou-
sand francs, but on condition that you
furnish splinter-bars and traces also for
that price.” - º
Still one must pay for one's pleasures,
and once en route I made short work
of the “What-may-happen-on-the road”
section. The sentence from which I
anticipated most trouble was this:
“Postilion, stop. A spoke of one of the
wheels is broken ; some of the harness
is undone; a spring is also broken and
one of the horses' shoes is come off.”
I got out all this (without having to
tell a lie too) and was just looking
feverishly through the book to find
phrases to describe the ricketty state of
every other part of the vehicle when
the off hind-wheel came in half, the
front axle snapped and the carriage
rolled over on its side stone dead.
When I came to myself I found that I
was comfortably seated in a ditch, my
driver beside me and my Wade Mecum
still open in my hand; so I had the
gratification of being able to continue
the conversation where I had left off.
“We should do well,” I read, “to get
out.” -
I will not detain you long over the diffi-
culties that I had with the “Society”
section. But I feel I ought to mention
the business of the Countess, if only to
put intending players on their guard.
There is a puzzling phrase which occurs
in answer to the observation, “Pray
come nearer the fire; I am sure you
must be cold.” The proper answer is,
“No, I thank you. I am very well placed
here beside the Countess.” It took me
a month to find a Countess, two to
meet her in the drawing-room of a
mutual friend, and four to recover from
the hole which the irascible little Count
made in me when we met next morning
on the field of honour.
So I pass sadly and with tears of
chagrin to my ultimate defeat. I met
my Waterloo, my friends, in the section
labelled “The Tailor.” Requests within
reason I can comply with, for the fun
of the thing. Eatables and drinks,
suites of rooms and carriages, when
ordered on the lavish scale of my Wade
Mecum, are not exactly cheap now-a-
days. But it's about the limit when
one's Mecum expects one to squander
the savings of a lifetime in ordering
several suits of clothes at once. And
yet there it was as large as life, the
accursed sentence that made me shut
the book with a snap and come home:–
“These coats fit me well, though the
cut is not fashionable. I shall require
also three pairs of trousers, three nan-
keen pantaloons and four waistcoats.”
If anyone feels inclined to try my
patience—and theirs—I should like to
mention that I have a nice annotated
Mecum and a good second-hand carri-
age for disposal at a very moderate
figure. -
A VICTIM OF FASHION.
LIKE everybody else that one knows,
Kidger is an ex-service man. During
the last year of that war on the Con-
tinent some time ago he had the acting
rank of captain, as second in command
of a six-mangle army laundry.
When I knew him in pre-war days
he was an amiable character, with only
two serious weaknesses. One of these
was an exaggerated fastidiousness about
clothes, and the other an undue defer-
ence to the dicta of the Press. A leader
in The Tailor and Cutter would make
him thoughtful for days. This fatal
concern about clothing amounted to a
mania where neckwear was concerned.
In pre-war days he wore the ordinary
single, perpendicular variety of collar,
with sharp turn-over points, starched
and white to match his shirts.
Before leaving England to join his
laundry, Kidger, with a magnificent
gesture, abandoned his fine collection
of collars to his aunt, bidding her con-
vert them to some patriotic end. The
fond lady, however, fearing lest any-
thing should befall her nephew if a hot
sector of the line moved up to the
laundry, preserved them carefully, and
Kidger was very glad to reclaim them
on his demobilisation.
One unfortunateday Kidger's morning
paper contained one of those Fashions
for Men columns, where he learned that
the best people were wearing only soft
collars, as they couldn't stand being
cooped up in starch after the freedom
of uniform. Kidger felt that as an ex-
army man it was up to him to maintain
any military tradition, and he immedi-
ately bought several dozen soft white
collars with long sharp points. The fel-
low in the shop said they were correct.
A week later another expert men-
tioned in print that no man who had
any self-respect wore collars with sharp
COrnel'S.
Kidger is not a manual worker. He
reduced his cigarette allowance and
bought some round - cornered ones,
white as before. And then his aunt
directed the poor fellow's attention to

| a paragraph by an authority signing
himself “The Colonel,” which stated
that none but the profiteer was wealing
white collars, and that you might know
the man who had done his bit by the
fact that he wore a blue one with
slightly rounded corners, accompanied
by a self-coloured tie of a darker shade,
tied in a neat butterfly bow.
This was a blow to Kidger, but he
resigned from his golf club and laid in
some haberdashery in accordance with
“The Colonel's '' orders. Recommend-
ations would be too mild a word. I
saw the paragraph—most peremptory.
But in a rival paper “Brigadier”
mentioned only three days later that
none but the most noxious bounder and
tout would be found dead in a blue
collar with a white shirt. Kidger saw
the truth of this at once; he had re-
ceptivity if not intuition. After a try-
ing interview with his banker he bought
several blue shirts.
Then the General who contributes
“Sartorial Tips" to several leading
journals remarked that, since all kinds
of people were wearing coloured shirts
and collars, the man who desired to
retain or achieve that touch of dis-
tinction which means so much must
at any cost wear white ones; and that,
further, Society was frowning on the
slovenly unstarched neck-wear of the
relapsed temporary gentleman.
Kidger began to show signs of neur-
asthenia. His stock of pre-war collars
was exhausted, or rather eroded. His
faithful aunt, however, remembered a
neglected birthday and gave him a
dozen new ones, of the up-and-down
model, to save IXidger's delicate neck.
These, with his nice butterfly-bow ties,
looked really well, and Kidger recovered
his old form. -
I warned him to keep to the police
and Parliamentary news in the papers,
but his eyes would wander. The result
was that he learned from “Brigade
Major " that the wearing of a butterfly
bow with a double event collar was a
solecism past forgiveness or repent-
ance, and that its smart appearance
was the deadly bait which caught the
miserable bumpkin who ignorantly
fancied that a man could dress by the
light of nature.
Kidger collapsed. His aunt volun-
teered to sell her annuity and help
him, but the innate nobility of the man
forbade him to accept this useless
sacrifice.
His medical attendant tells me that
he is now allowed to read only poetry,
wearing a sweater meanwhile, and
that arrangements are being made for
him to join a sheep-farming cousin in
Patagonia, where collars are despised
and newspapers invariably out of date.

EDWARD AND THE B.O.F.
It was the first Sunday of the season,
and the select end of Folkesbourne
revealed in each carefully curled ger-
anium leaf, in each carefully-combed
blade of grass, the thought and labour
expended by the B.O.F. (Borough of
Folkesbourne).
Upon the greensward stood orderly
rows of well-washed chairs, each with
B.O.F. neatly stencilled upon its back.
On this day, however, and at this hour
(12.30 P.M.) scarce a B.O.F. was visible;
each was hidden by a well-dressed
visitor. And between the orderly rows
of well - dressed visitors paraded or-
exerting authority and restoring dis-
cipline. Edward turned at the sound of
a stern voice. Possibly he might have
put out histongue—you never know with
Edward. But, what was worse, far
worse, he saw me. With a glad cry of
“Daddy” he rushed to me and, regard-
less of the fact that his front was
covered with green slime, the result of
going ventre'd pierre over the rocks, he
flung his arms round my legs.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I RATHER wish that the publishers of Invincible Minnie
(HopDER AND Stoughton) had not permitted themselves to
print upon the wrapper either their own comments or those
of Miss ELISABETH SANXAY Holding, the author. Because
for my part, reading these, I formed the idea (entirely
wrong) that the book would be in some way pretentious
and affected; whereas it is the simple truth to call it the
most mercilessly impersonal piece of fiction that I think I
ever read. There is far too much plot for me to give you
any but a suggestion of it. The story is of the lives of two
sisters, Frances and Minnie; mostly (as the title implies) of
Minnie. To say that no one but a woman would have
dared to imagine such a heroine, much less to follow her,
through every phase of increasing hatefulness, to her horrid
conclusion is to state an obvious truism. It is incidentally
also to give you some idea of the kind of person Minnie
is, that female Moloch, devastating, all-sacrificing, beyond
restraint . . . As for Miss Holding, the publishers turned
out to be within the mark in claiming for her “a new voice.”
I don't, indeed, for the moment recall any voice in the least
like it, or any such method; too honest for irony, too de-
tached for sentiment and, as I said above, entirely merciless.
Towards the end I found myself falling back on the old fright-
ened protest, “People don't do these things.” I still cling
to this belief, but the fact remains that Miss Holding has a
haunting trick of persuading one that they might. Minor
faults, such as an irritating idiom and some carelessness of
form, she will no doubt correct; meanwhile you have cer-
tainly got to read—“to suffer” would be the apter word—
this remarkable book, whose reception I await with curiosity.
A much misunderstood man is Count BERNSTORFF, for-
merly German Ambassador at Washington. While we
were all supposing him to be a bomb-laden conspirator,
pulling secret strings in Mexico or Canada or Japan from
the safe protection afforded to his embassy, really he was
the most innocent of men, anxious for nothing but to keep
unsophisticated America from being trapped by the wiles of
the villain Britisher. One has it all on the best of authority
—his own—in My Three Years in America (SKEFFINGTON).
Of course awkward incidents did occur, which have to be
explained away or placidly ignored, but really, if the war-
lords at home had not been so invincibly tactless in the
matter of drowning citizens of the United States, this simple
and ingenuous diplomat might very well have succeeded,
he would have us believe, in persuading President WILSON
to declare in favour of a peace-loving All-Highest. As an
essay in special pleading the book does not lack ingenuity,
and as an example of the familiar belief that other peoples
will shut their eyes and swallow whatever opinions the
Teuton thinks good to offer them, it may have interest for
the psychologist. For the rest it is a very prosy piece of
literature, only saved occasionally in its dulness by the un-
conscious crudity of the hatreds lurking beneath its mask
of plausibility. One of these hatreds is clearly directed
against Ambassador GERARD, to whose well-known book
this volume is in some sort a counter-blast. Neither a
historian seeking truth nor a plain reader seeking recrea-
tion will have any difficulty in choosing between them.
Mr. D. A. BARKER, in The Great Leviathan (LANE), doesn't
merely leave you to make the obvious remark about his
having taken Mr. H. G. WELLs's loose, tangential and, for
a beginner, extraordinarily dangerous method as a model,

his experiences while
but rubs it in (stout fellow!) by transplanting his hero to
India, seemingly in order to have excuse for writing, a
passage which one would say was obviously inspired by
that gorgeous description of the jungle in The Research Mag-
nificent. Mr. BARKER has enough matter for two (or three)
novels and enough skill in portraiture to make them more
coherent and plausible than this. The theme is old but
freshly seen. Tom Seton, resolved to avoid risking for his
beloved the unhappiness which his mother had found in
the bondage of marriage, offers her—indeed imposes on
her—a free union. How the pressure of The Great Levia-
than (Mrs. Grundy—well, that's not perhaps quite the
whole of the idea, but it will serve) drove her into the
shelter of a formal marriage with a devoted don, I leave
you to gather. I don't think the author quite succeeds in
making Mary's defection inevitable, nor do I see the signi.
ficance of the apparently quite irrelevant background of
Indian philosophy and intrigue. But here's a well-written
who believe in telling you all about their characters and
leaving you to pass judgment on them yourself, without
expert assistance. It is a fine impartial method which
succeeds in representing life and the indecisiveness of
human nature very well; but such books somehow lack the
glow of more partisan writings. In A Mouse with Wings
(CoLLINs) she tells the story of a woman's life from the
time of her engagement until her son is a young man
and she herself married again. Olga is a splendid creature,
but, as Miss LESLIE cleverly lets you see for yourself, the
belief in her own principles and their application, which is
the essence of her character, alienates her husband and
makes something like a ninny of Arnold, her son. A Mouse
with Wings is not only the sobriquet of Beryl, the cheerful
young Suffragette whom he loves, but has its application also
to poor Arnold, who finds the courage to face life and a way
out of it fighting in France. It is a nicely-written book
with a little air of distinction, but, in case anyone should
book, with sound posi-
tive qualities outweigh-
ing the defects of inex-
perience.
Captain ALAN Bott
(“Contact”) has a liter-
ary gift of a high order,
the gift of getting the
very last thrill out of
telling his tale in the
simplest and most
straightforward way.
In Eastern Nights
(BLAckwooD) he de-
scribes his adventures
as a prisoner of the
Turks, first in Damas- | *
cus and Asia Minor
and finally in Constan-
tinople. The narrative,
blame me for hushing
it up, I ought to men-
tion that both Olga and
Beryl would probably
have admired Arnold a
great deal more had
he “found himself” by
way of Conscientious
Objection.

I can testify that Mr.
ZANE GREY's The Man

yarn told with con-

just that undercurrent
of sentiment which

of the British public
completely off its feet.

attractive captivity, nevertheless offers a most vivid picture
of the social fabric of the Near East and in particular of the
attitude of the mélange of Oriental peoples that comprised
the Turkish Empire towards the War in which they found
themselves taking part, most of them with reluctance and
all inefficiently. Apathy rather than calculated brutality
was chiefly responsible for the hardships suffered by the
prisoners of war of all nations who were unfortunate enough
to fall into Turkish hands. From the point of view of an
officer determined to escape, however, the prevalence of
this quality was not without its advantage. Most of the
officials (Turks and Germans excepted) with whom Captain
Bott and his fellow-officers had to do were pro-Ally at
heart and ready enough to assist an escaping prisoner if
they did not happen to be too timid. And even the Turk
was amenable on occasion to baksheesh. Altogether a
most fascinating book, Eastern Nights is likely to win wide
appreciation not alone for its literary merit but as a stirring
record of the courage and resource, under desperate and
trying conditions, of the Empire's soldiers.
Miss HENRIETTA LEslip belongs to the school of novelists
tures befall them. To escape from being kidnapped by
some superb scoundrels they were hustled off to Milt Dale's
home in the forest, and there they had for a long time to
remain. Milt was one of nature's gentlemen, but as his
boon companion was a cougar (whose uninviting picture is
to be seen upon the paper cover), this forest home had its
slight inconveniences. Mr. GREY, however, writes of it so
admirably that he almost persuades me to be a camper-out,
provided always that I may live in a cavern and not in a
caravan. Cowboys, bandits, Mormons and other vigorous
characters keep things moving at a terrific pace. But stir-
ringly full of incident as this tale is, Mr. GREY never forgets
that it is love that really makes the world go round. He is
in short a born storyteller, with a style by no means to be
despised, and I see no reason why his popularity should not
continue to wax here, and ultimately to rival its American
magnitude.

IN DEFENCE OF DOROTHY.
I was greatly pained to read, the
other day, in one of our leading dailies
a most violent and uncalled-for attack
on a popular favourite. Perhaps I
should say one who was popular, for,
alas, favourites have their day, and no
doubt this attack was but to demolish
the reputation of the setting star and
enhance that of a rising one. Still it
was unnecessarily churlish; it criti-
cised not only the colour of her com-
plexion, the exuberance of her presence,
but her very name was held up to ridi-
cule, the fault surely of her god-parents.
There has been, not unnaturally,
quite a sensation in her circle over
this attack; Papa Gontier and Maman
Cochet clasped each other's hands in
sympathy and said, “What will people
say next of us, a respectable and time-
honoured old couple, if they flout pretty
popular little Dorothy Perkins?” “Of
course, if people who live in a brand-
new red-brick villa choose to invite
Dorothy into their garden, one can't
expect her to look her best; but, after
all, there's only that languishing Stella
Gray who can stand such a trial as that,
and perhaps the stout Frau Druschki.”
“She, poor thing, is quite out of favour
just now—hardly mentioned in polite
society. Quite under a cloud; in fact
a greeting from Teplitz is the only
one she gets.” “Now William Allen
Richardson (there's a ridiculous long
name, if you like ') was saying only
yesterday how grateful we should all
feel to dear Dorothy, who never seems
to mind the weather and cheers us up
when all else fails.” “I must say I
don't feel quite sure of William's sin-
cerity, he is so very changeable, you
know, and does not really care to be
seen in Dorothy's company.”
Pretty little Mme. Laurette Messimé
was quite hanging her head about it
all. “I live in harmony with all my
neighbours,” she simpered. “Ah, yes,”
flaunted Lady Gay, in that unblushing
manner of hers, “that's very easy to
do for colourless people.” At this
Caroline Testout turned quite pale and
stuttered, “Well, Dorothy does scream
so.” “Hush, hush, my children,” said
the deep voice of the venerable Marshal
Nicl. Though yellow with extreme old
age the old gentleman bore himself
proudly and his dress was glossy and
clean. “We all have our place in the
world. Let carping critics say what
they please, whether it is Dorothy in
her gay gown or Liberty in her revolu-
tionary wear, our showy American
cousins, our well-beloved Scotch rela-
tions, or our Persian guests—they are
all welcome, all beautiful.” “Hear,
hear !” murmured the other roses.

Many Admirers.
No sooner was I in my earliest teens
and had made up my mind as to the
best cigarettes, than proposals began
to be a matter of daily occurrence, so
that whenever I saw the fifth footman
or the third butler stealthily approach-
ing me I knew that he was conceal-
ing a billet dour. Sometimes they were
very flattering. Here is one, written
in the big boyish hand of a Prince of
the Blood:—
My beautiful, there is no one like you.
They want me to marry the daughter of a
royal house, but if you will say “Yes” I will
defy them. We will be married by the Arch-
bishop, who marries and buries so beautifully;
but I shall never need burying, because those
who marry you never die.
Poor boy, I had to send him a nega-
tive by the fifteenth groom in the third
phaeton, drawn by a pair of dashing
chestnuts which another of my unsuc-
cessful adorers had given me. I noticed
that when they got back to Grosvenor
Square the chestnuts had turned to
greys.
The Sage of Chelsea.
THOMAS CARLYLE loved to have me
trotting in and out of his house in
Cheyne Row, and we had endless talks
on the desirability of silence. “Yon
wee Meg,” he used to say, for he re-
fused to call me “Margot,” declaring it
was a Frenchified name—“yon wee
Meg is the cleverest girl in Scotland—
and the wittiest.” -

bably bores you too, only you daren't
admit it.
What would have happened I cannot
imagine had not dear old CARLYLE
offered me a draw of his pipe, while re-
marking laughingly, “She's a wonder,
is Meg; she'll lead the world yet.”
One day he asked me what I thought
of his writing.

I asked him once what he really
thought of Mrs. CARLYLE, but he
changed the subject.
Bismarck.
It was in Berlin, when I was seven-
teen, that I met BISMARCK. It was at
the Opera, where, being a young English
girl, I was in the habit of going alone.
The great Chancellor, who was all un-
conscious that I had penetrated his
identity, watched me for a long while
between the Acts and then overtook me
on my way home and in French asked
me to supper.

And glistening array.
Oh, blithesome was KING SolomoN

When lo! a humble shepherdess
Stood silent in his way; .
Then stepped down kingly SolomoN,
And proud and great stepped he,
And there he kissed the shep-

Kissed one and two and three.
Then proudly turned the peasant-
maid—
Pale as a ghost was she—
“For all ye are KING SoLoMon,
What make ye here so free?”
Oh, lordly laughed KING SoLoMon,
“Shalt be my queen,” quoth he:
“These kisses pledged KING SolomoN
And sealéd him to thee.”
Then on went splendid SoLoMon
And all his glittering band,
And the wondering white peasant-
irl
He led her by the hand;
But in that place sprang flower-
stems
All green, for kingly pride,
With the small white kisses hanging
down
With which he sealed his bride.

Ursula came into the study, carrying
something that had once been a photo-
graph, but which the ravages of time
had long since reduced to a faded and
almost indecipherable problem.
“Dear,” she said, “you know this
portrait of Clara's boy, the one in the
sailor suit, from my writing-table? I
was looking at it just now * *

“Nothing—much,” said Ursula; but
from the tone of her voice experience
taught me that sentiment was only
just out of sight. “I was wondering

“Good.”
“And then I thought that, as he was

would be interesting to compare this

“It would,” I assented grimly. Per-

quest is that in the meantime you

“No. This is a matter of principle,
and I am speaking for your own good.
Fifteen years ago that photograph, un-
framed and in the first flush of youth,
was casually deposited on your writing-

it out of your hand for a moment while

life. This speckled travesty, this photo-
graphic mummy, is but one example
out of many. I do not know whether
other homes resemble ours in the same
tendency towards the mausoleum. But
I strongly suspect it.”
“What things are there besides
this?” broke out Ursula, suddenly de-
fensive. “Tell me a list of them.”
“You forget, sweetheart, that as a
professional literary man my time,
especially in the morning, has a certain
commercial value, but I will endeav-
our to do as you ask. You would of
course justly repudiate any comparison
between your own artistic setting and
those Victorian houses wherein the
‘drawing-room book' reposed always
in the same sacred corner. Yet in
the matter of derelict articles we are
millionaires, we are beset by squatters.”
I could see that Ursula was im-
pressed, though she tried to conceal the
fact. “Professional literary men seem
to be strangely under the dominion of
one word,” she began coldly.
At that moment a bell tinkled.
“Eliza ’’ cried Ursula; “and I'm not
dressed.” As she fluttered from the
room I had a distinct impression that
she was not sorry for an excuse to
break off the interview.
I re-settled myself at my desk, smiling
a little cynically. How long would the

glance towards the mantelpiece, beside
which Ursula had been standing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SQUISH.
(Being some notes on a bye-path in politics.)
THE Board of Agriculture has been biding its time. . In
the fierce light of publicity which has been beating of late
upon Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL and Sir
ERIC GEDDEs the attempt of this rustic Ministry to assert
itself has passed almost unnoticed. Our gaze has been
fixed upon the London railway termini, upon Warsaw and
upon Belfast; we have been neglecting Campden (Glos.).
Yet in that town, I read, “the Ministry of Agriculture has
completed arrangements for a commercial course in the
State Fruit and Vegetable College to instruct students in
the manufacture of preserved fruit products.”
* I have considered the last part of the sentence quoted
above very carefully in the light of the Rules and Regula-
tions governing procedure in State Departments, Magna
Carta, the Habeas Corpus Act and the Constitutions of
Clarendon, and have come to the conclusion that it means
“making jam.” I am very sure, as the PRIME MINISTER
would say, that things are about to happen in preserved
fruit products; things will become very much worse and
very much sterner in jam. And if in jam why then also
in jelly and in marmalade. Even at this moment in the
offices of the Board of Agriculture there are a number of
clerks, I suppose, sitting with schedules in front of them,
something like this:— -
No. of can- ; No. of can- | No. of can- Nº. Nº. *
olidates in didates didates 11da tilda
… i - i. - trained, full, but Toral
training awaiting fully but not 1\ot
in training in trained full trained
1. Jam
2. Jelly . . .
3. Marmalade.
ToTAL
The perfect beauty of schedules framed upon this model
is only to be apprehended by those who realise that when
they are filled in and added up correctly the figure at the
base of the vertical “Total” column on the right is identi-
cal with the figure on the right of the horizontal “Total”
column at the base. It is the haunting magic of this fact
that gives to Government clerks the wistful far-away look
which they habitually wear.
It is not a good schedule this, of course—not a complete,
not an exhaustive one. After a month or so it will be dis-
covered with a cry of astonishment that no record has
been kept of the number of candidates who are being
trained in jam or jelly (combined) but not in marmalade, in
jelly and marmalade (combined) but not in jam, and in jam
and marmalade (combined) but not in jelly. And so a new
and a greater schedule will have to be compiled. But even
after that for a long time no one will notice that nothing
has been said about the number of candidates who are being
trained in jam and jelly and marmalade all combined and
mashed up together, as they are at a picnic on the sands.
Of the many debatable issues raised by this new Govern-
ment project, in so far as it affects the spheres of jelly and
jam, I do not propose to speak now ; I prefer to confine my
attention for the moment to the fruit product which touches
most nearly the home breakfast-table—namely, marmalade.
There are three schools of thought in marmalade. There
are those who like the dark and very runny kind with large
segments or wedges of peel. There are those who prefer
a clear and jellified substance with tiny fragments of peel
enshrined in it as the fly is enshrined in amber. And
there are some, I suppose, who favour a kind of glutinous
yellow composition, neither reactionary nor progressive, but
something betwixt and between. There can be very little
doubt which kind of marmalade the State Marmalade
School will produce.
And then, mark you, one fine day the President of the
Board of Agriculture will turn round and issue a communiqué
to the Press like this :—
“Preferential treatment in the supply of sugar for the
purpose of conducting the processes of manufacture of fruit
products will henceforward be given to those who possess
the Campden diploma for proficiency in the conduct of the
above-named processes.”
And where is your freedom then 2 Cooks and housewives
will be condemned either to make State marmalade or to
make no marmalade at all. Personally I am inclined to
think that the President of the Board of Agriculture will
go further than this. I think that encouragement will be
given to those who take the State Marmalade course to
follow it up with a subsidiary or finishing course of wasp
treatment.
And in wasp treatment also there are three schools.
There is what is called the CHURCHILL school, which hits
out right and left with an infuriated spoon. Then there is
the MoWTAGU school, which takes no provocative action,
but sits still and says, “They won't sting you if you don't
irritate them ; "it says this especially when they are flying
round somebody else's head. And lastly there is the
Medium school, which, choosing the moment when the
wasp is busily engaged, presses it down gently and firmly
into the marmalade, so that the last spoonfuls of the dish
are not so much a fruit product as a kind of entomological
preserve. The last way, I think, will be the State way of
dealing with wasps, and a reward will probably be offered
for the stings of all wasps embalmed on Coalition lines.
The electorate has stuck to the Government through the
Peace Treaty, through Mesopotamia, through Ireland and
through coal. Can it stick to them, is what I ask, through
marmalade 2 Evoe.
MENS CONSCIA MALI.
THE lightning flashed and flickered, roared the
thunder,
Down came the rain, and in the usual way
Pavilionward we sped to sit and wonder
Was this the end of play.
In scattered groups my comrades talked together,
Their disappointment faded bit by bit,
So soothing can it be to tell the weather
Just what you think of it.
But I–I sat aloof as one distressed by
A painful tendency to droop and wilt;
Though none suspected it, I was oppressed by
A conscience charged with guilt.
I watched the pitch become a sodden pulp, a
Morass, a sponge, a lake, a running stream,
What time a sad repentant Mea culpa
Was all my musing's theme. -
Mine was the cricket sin too hard to pardon
In one whose age should carry greater sense;
On Friday night I'd watered all the garden,
Thus tempting Providence.

‘untrammelled to pork out their own salvation.’”—Canadian Paper.
And why not the Irish people too?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COUNTER-IRRITANT.
Most men have a hobby. Timbrell-
Timson's is to bear on his narrow
shoulders the burden of Middle Europe.
He calls it Mittel-Europa. Lately he
has been sharing his burden with me.
“You know,” he said, frowning—he
always frowns, because of the burden—
“I am rather uneasy about the Czecho-
Slovaks.”
“I’m not too comfortable about them
myself,” I said truthfully.
“There seems to be a certain lack of
stability about their new constitution,”
said T. - T., “a–a—a—what shall I
say?”
“A—er—um—a,” I put in.
“Exactly; just so,” said T.T. He
then got into his stride and gave me
twenty minutes' Czecho - Slovakism
when I was dying to discover whether
HoBBs had scored his two-millionth
I'll n.
As T-T talked my mind wandered
away into regions of its own—Aunt
Jane's rheumatic gout, my broken nib-
lick, the necessity for getting my hair
cut. But sub-consciously I reserved a
courteous minimum of attention for
T.-T., and said, “H'm " and “Hal” with
decent frequency. He went on and on,
shedding several ounces of the burden.
I decided that Aunt Jane ought to have
a shot at Christian Science.
“. . . very much the same plight as
the Poles,” said T.-T., emerging from a
cloud of Czecho-Slovakism and pausing
to clear his meagre throat.
I felt it was up to me. “Of course,”
I said, “the Poles don't strike one as
being—er—very—that is—”
“Precisely. They are not,” said T.T.,
as I knew he would. “But I am very
relieved to see that M. Grabski—”
This was something new and sounded
amusing. “Grabski?” I said. “What's
happened to dear old—I mean, I thought
M. Paderewski was "
“I am referring to the recent Spa
Conference,” said T.T. severely.
“Of course, how silly of me,” I mur-
mured.
T-T. gave me another twenty minutes
of Poland. Then he released me, with
a final word of warning against putting
too much faith in M. Daschovitch. I
promised I wouldn't.
T-T. shook me cordially by the hand
and said, “It has been a pleasure to
talk to such a sympathetic listener.”
What led me to revolt was T.-T.'s
hat-trick. Three evenings in succession
he unloaded on me chunks of the burden.
Probably he thought the third time
made it my own property.
I asked advice from Brown, a man
of commonsense. -
“During the Great War,” said Brown,
“I went down with pneumonia. They
painted my chest yellow, and, when I
asked the Sister why, she said it was a
counter-irritant. That's what you want
to use now, my lad. Stand up to your
little friend and beat him at his own
game.” -
“But how 2 " I said. “I can’t. What
he doesn't know about the gentle Czéch
isn't worth a cussovitch.”
“Cultivate a counter-burden,” said
Brown, “and make him eat it as he has
made you eat his.”
When I left Brown it was decided
that I was henceforth to be an authority
on Mittel-Afrika. The next evening I
was purposely unoccupied in a corner
of the smoking-room when T.-T. came
in, frowning and bowed down by his
burden, to which apparently I had
brought no relief.
“Well, to-day's news from Mittel-
Europa is hardly ” he began.
“Scarcely glanced at it,” I said. “I
was so busy with the news from Mittel-
Afrika–Abyssinia, in fact.”
T-T. looked surprised, partly, no
doubt, because he knew as well as I
did that Abyssinia is nowhere near the
middle of Africa. Then he gained bal-
ance and reopened with the remark that
“The ineradicable weakness of the
Czecho-Slovak is 1 *
“Just what I feel about the Ethio-
pians,” I said.
“Of course there is in the Czecho a
fundamental — ” began T.-T. once
In Ore.
“Not half so fundamental as in the
Abyssinians,” I said promptly.
T-T. was puzzled but obstinate. The
burden, I think, was rather bad that
evening. He tried me with Grabski
and got as far as saying that he had
little respect for that gentleman's ante-
cedents.
I broke in by comparing Grabski's
antecedents with the antecedents of
Blumbu, the Abyssinian Deputy Under-
Secretary of the Admiralty, much to the
detriment of the latter. Then I launched
out into a long and startling erposé of
what I called the Swarthy Peril. I
told T.-T. that the Ethiopians ate their
young, and warned him that, unless he
was careful, they would soon be over here
devouring his own spectacled progeny.
I told him about the Ethiopic secret
plans for the invasion of Mexico as a
stepping-stone to the subjugation of
Mittel-Amerika. I hinted that Abys-
sinian spies were everywhere—that
even one of the club waiters was not
above suspicion. -
For thirty-five minutes I held T.T.
in his chair (may the Abyssinian gods
forgive me!). * the first three
minutes he forgot hºſs burden and never
a word spake he. -
Then I released him with a final
warning against putting any faith at all
in Gran'slam, the Abyssinian Assistant
Foreign Secretary, and as we parted I
said gratefully, “It has been a pleasure
to talk to such a sympathetic listener.”
I don't think T.-T. really believes
even now in the Swarthy Peril, but the
counter-irritant has done its work.
ANOTHER GARDEN OF ALLAH.
[The Metropolitan Water Board announces
an advance in the Water Rate.]
I CANNOT fill the bounteous cup
Munificently as of yore
Because the water's going up
(It didn't at Lodore);
No longer now can I regale
The canine stranger with a pail
Drawn from my cistern's store.
Let Samuel the sunflower die,
Let Gerald the geranium fade,
And all the other plants that I
Have hitherto displayed;
The virgin grass within my plot
May call for water—I will not
Preserve a single blade.
Henceforth let Claude the cactus dress
My garden beds, who bravely grows
Without a frequent S.O.S.
To water-can and hose.
I've cast these weapons to the void
And permanently unemployed

I've run an Anti-Waste Campaign;
On every tap the legend reads:
“Teetotalers, abstain ' "
While on each bath and tub of mine
I've drawn freehand a PLIMsoll line,
Impressionist but plain.
When upward mount my chops and

I fain must bend beneath the blow;
I have to pay the price for these
Whether I will or no.
But here at least, by dint of thought,
I feel that I can bring to naught
The rise in H2O.
You'll find that I shall keep in check
The gross expense of water when

THIS IS THE SHRIMPTON Counier Fort FEBRUARY 12 THAT
THE BEGINNER.
Six months ago Maurice Gillstone's
flat was the home of unrest. Maurice
was one of those authors who tire of
their creations before completion. He
would get an idea, begin to write and
then turn to some other theme.
It made the domestic atmosphere
difficult. You would go to call on the
Gillstones and find them plunged in
despair. Maurice would gaze at you
with a wild unseeing eye, pass his
hand through his dishevelled hair,
mutter “The inspiration has left me,”
and fling himself into a chair and
| groan. Mrs. Maurice would burst into
tears.
The flat was strewn with fragments
of manuscripts. Plays, novels, poems
(none finished) littered the rooms in pro-
fusion; a brilliant but isolated Scene I.,
stray opening chapters of novels, de-
tached prologues of mighty epics.
“His beginnings are wonderful,”
Mrs. Maurice would wail between her
sobs; “keen critics and men of the
most delicate literary taste rave over
them; but if he can't finish them,
what's the use 2"
It was very sad.
Then John Edmund Drall, the in-
ventor of the non-alcoholic beverage
which is now a household word and an
old friend of the Gillstones, came along
and tried to cure Maurice of his literary
defect by the sort of ruse one would
employ on a jibbing horse. He sent
Mauriee a bottle of his Lemonbeer and
asked him to write an appreciation of
that noxious fluid.
“I have asked Maurice,” Drall con-
fided to me, “to scribble a testimonial
to Lemonbeer. It will kind of break the
spell, and it wouldn't be Maurice if he
didn't turn out a perſect gem of literary
composition. I know my Lemonbeer
is really good and I know that Maurice
is extremely appreciative. Maurice is
under a spell. It must be broken. If
he can write a complete testimonial he
will easily finish all those beginnings
of his.” The idea seemed sound.
Well, Maurice drank the Lemonbeer
and, in spite of an increasing tendency
to swoon, did begin to write a gem of a
testimonial. He had, however, written
but the first four words of it when he
fainted. These words were “Lemon-
beer is the best . . .”
Maurice would do anything for a
friend, and, as I say, had actually
written “Lemonbeer is the best . . .”
after drinking a whole bottle of it.
It was Drall's advertisement manager
who said that in point of selling power
this testimonial was unsurpassed. “The
finished completeness of the composi-
tion,” he said, “shows sheer genius.
Just four words. A word added or sub-
tracted would ruin it.”
When Maurice came to and learnt
how brilliant he had been he simply
put on his hat and walked round to a
Film Agency to say that he was pre-
pared to write—and complete—any
number of masterpieces. Since that
day he has never looked back.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 2nd.—The rain that
drenched the Bank-holiday-makers had
its counterpart inside the House of
Commons in the shower of Questions
arising out of Mr. CHURCHILL's article
on the Polish crisis in an evening news-
paper. Members of various parties
sought to know whether, when the
WAR SECRETARY said that peace with
Soviet Russia was only another form
of war and apparently invited the
co-operation of the German militarists
to fight the Bolshevists, he was ex-
pressing the views of the Government;
and if not, what had become of the
doctrine of collective responsibility ?
The PRIME MINISTER manfully tried
to shield his colleague from the storm,
but the effort took all his strength and
ingenuity, and more than once it seemed
as if an unusually violent blast would
blow his umbrella inside out. His
principal points were that the article
did not mean what it appeared to say;
that if it did it was not so much an
expression of policy as of a “hanker-
ing"—(“HANKERING. An uneasy crav-
ing to possess or enjoy something"—
Dictionary); that he could not control
sion, even in a newspaper hostile to the
Government, so long as they were con-
sistent with the policy of the Govern-
ment ; and that he was not aware of
anything in this particular article that
“cut across any declaration of policy
by His Majesty's Government.”
This does not sound very convincing
perhaps, but it was sufficient to satisfy
Members, whose chief anxiety is to get
off as soon as possible to the country,
and who voted down by 134 to 32 an
attempt to move the adjournment.

troduced a Bill “to make provision for
the restoration and maintenance of
order in Ireland.” Earlier in the sit-
ting the PRIME MINISTER had declined
Mr. DE WALERA's alleged offer to accept
a republic on the Cuban pattern, and
had reiterated his intention to pass the
Home Rule Bill after the Recess.
Mr. T. P. O'Connor is a declared
opponent of both these measures, but
that did not prevent him from con-
trasting the lightning speed of the
House when passing coercion for Ire-
land with its snail-like pace when ap-
proaching conciliation. In fifty years
it had not given justice to Ireland; it
was to be asked to give injustice to
Ireland in fewer hours.
Tuesday, August 3rd–That genial
optimist Lord PEEL commended the
Ministry of Mines Bill as being calcu-
lated to restore harmony and goodwill
among masters and men. According
to Lord GAINFORD the best way to
secure this result is to hand back the
control of the mines to their owners,
between whom and the employés, he
declared, cordial relations had existed
in the past. Still, the owners would
work the Bill for what it was worth,
and hoped the miners would do the
same. Lord HALDANE said that was
just what the miners had announced
their intention of not doing unless they
were given a great deal more power
than the Bill proposed. But this lack
of enthusiasm in no way damped Lord
PEEL's ardour. Indeed he observed
that he had “never introduced a Bill
that was received with any sort of en-
thusiasm.” Mollified by this engaging
candour the Peers gave the Bill a
Second Reading.
I am glad to record another example
of Government economy. To Mr. GIL-
BERT, who desired that more sandpits
should be provided in the London parks
for the delectation of town-tied child-
ren, Sir ALFRED MoRD reluctantly but
sternly replied that “in view of the

considerable expenditure involved" he
did not feel justified in adding to the
existing number of three.
Dumps suggest dolefulness, but the
debate on the action of the Disposals
Board in disposing of the accumula-
tions at Slough, St. Omer and else-
where was decidedly lively. Mr. HoPE
led off by attacking the recent report
of the Committee on National Expendi-
ture, and declared that its Chairman,
though a paragon of truth, was not
necessarily a mirror of accuracy. The
Chairman himself (Sir F. BANBURY),

measure.
It was another day of rather small
beer in the Commons. There were,
however, one or two dicta of note.
Thus Sir BERTRAM FALK, who was con-
cerned because Naval officers received
no special marriage allowance, was spe-
cifically assured by Sir JAMEs CRAIG
that the Admiralty will not prevent
men from marrying. I understood,
however, that it will not recognise a
wife in every port.
Sir HAMAR GREEN wood made as good
a defence of the Bill as was possible in
the circumstances. But neither he nor
anybody else could say how courts-
martial, which are “to act on the
ordinary rules of evidence,” will be suc-
cessful in bringing criminals to justice
if witnesses refuse to come forward.
Mr. T. P. O'CoNNOR re-delivered the
anti-coercion speech which he has been
making off and on for the last forty
years. Mr. DEVLIN was a little more
up-to-date, for he introduced a reference
to the Belfast riots and drew from the
seated for the nonce upon
the Opposition Bench, replied
with appropriate vigour in a
speech which caused Sir GoR-
DoN HEwART to remark that
the passion for censorious-
ness was not a real virtue,
but which greatly pleased the
Labour Party, in acknow-
ledging whose compliments
Sir FREDER Ick severely
strained the brim of his tall
hat.'
After these star-turns the
“walking gentlemen " had

Mr. Asquith denounced the

more harm than good. Crom-
wellian treatment needed a
CRoMwFLL, but he did not see
one on the Treasury Bench.
“CROMwFLL yourself!” re-
torted the PRIME MINISTER.
The only unofficial supporter
of the Bill, and even he “no
great admirer,” was Lord
HUGH CECIL; but neverthe-
less the Second Reading was
carried by 289 to 71.
The House afterwards gave
a Second Reading to the Cen-
sus (Ireland) Bill, on the prin-
ciple, as Captain ELLIOTT caus-
|tically observed, that if you
can't do anything with the
people of Ireland you might
at least find out how many
of them there are.

remaining stages of the Coer-
cion Bill were passed under
the “guillotine.” Mr. DEVLIN
declared that this was not

any longer; but it is only fair ||
to say that he had not then

tract would shortly be invited and that,
whoever secured it, the efficiency of the

It was nearly eight o'clock before
the Ministry of Mines came on. Lord
SALISBURY thought it would be im-
proper to consider so important a
measure after dinner; Lord CRAwFord
thought it would be still more improper
to suggest that the Peers would not be
in a condition to transact business after
that meal. He carried his point, but
at the expense of the Bill, for Lord
SALISBURY, returning like a giant re-
freshed, induced their Lordships to
transform the Minister of Mines into
a mere Under-Secretary of the Board

the present state of Ireland was due to

disease so clearly he ought to have been
ready with a remedy, but could suggest
nothing more practical than the hold-
ing of mass meetings to organise Brit-
ish public opinion.
Meanwhile the Commons were en-
gaged in rushing through with the aid
of the “guillotine” a Bill for the re-
storation of order in the distressful
country. Mr. BoNAR LAw, usually so
accurate, fell into an ancient trap, and

ROAD CONDITIONS FOR CHARABANCS.
THE following road information is
compiled from reports received by the
Charabanc Defence Association:—
The Lushborough road is good and
free from obstruction as far as Great
Boundingley, but from Chatback to
Wrothley the conditions are unfavour-
able. The bridge one mile south of the
former place has been occupied by a
strong force of unfriendly natives, and
several cases of tarring have been re-
ported. There is, however, an alterna-
tive route rid Boozeley, but great
caution is advised in passing through
Wrothley, passengers being recom-
mended to provide themselves with a
good supply of loose metal before enter-
ing the village, where most of the houses
are protected with iron shutters. Hel-
mets should not be removed before
reaching Cadbridge, where there is no
danger of retaliation.
Bottles may be discharged freely all
along the Muckley road as far as Rud-

of snipers has not yet been dislodged.

It would be humiliating to the whole
charabanc confraternity if they were to
yield their pre-eminence in this branch
of education to a small rural com-
munity. -
Thanks to the vigilance of the well-
armed patrols of the Charabanc Defence
Association the main roads in East
Anglia are almost clear of the enemy.
Caution must still be observed in pass-
ing through Garningham at night. One
of the hardiest “charabankers” was
recently prostrated in that village by a
well-aimed epithet from the oldest in-
habitant. A writer in a Norwich paper
recently described the area within ten
miles of Whelksham as “a paradise for
baboon-faced Yahooligans.” But these
futile ebullitions of malice are powerless
to check the triumphal progress of the
charabanc in the Eastern Counties.
But no route at present offers more
favourable or exhilarating opportunities
to the high-minded excursionist than
the main Gath road from Scrapston to
Kinlarry. Excellent sport is afforded
just outside Stillminster, where Sir John
Goodfellow's greenhouses are within
easy bottle-throw of the road and fur-
nish a splendid target. On the whole,
however, it is thought advisable to
abstain from saluting the neighbouring
hospital for shell-shock patients with
a salvo of megaphones, local opinion
being adverse to such manifestations.

The Ealing trains run fast;
I stand at Gloucester Road and see
A many hurtling past;
They go to Acton, Turnham Green,
And stations I have never seen,
Simply because my lot has been
In other places cast.
The folk on Ealing trains who ride
They, pitying, bestow
On me a look instinct with pride;
But I would have them know
That, while on Wimbledonian plains
My humble domicile remains,
I HAVE No USE FOR EALING TRAINs,
Though still they come and go.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
(Written after reading Mr. FRANcis W.
GALPIN’s “Old English Instruments
of Music.”)
I AM no skilful vocalist ;
I can't control my mezza gola ;
I have but an indifferent fist
(Or foot) upon the Pianola.
But there are instruments, I own,
That fire me with a fond ambition
To master for their names alone
Apart from their august tradition.
They are the Fipple-Flute, a word
Suggestive of seraphic screeches;
The Poliphant comes next, and third
The Humstrum—aren't they perfect
peaches 2
About their tone I cannot say
Much that would carry clear con-
viction,
For, till I read of them to-day,
I knew them not in fact or fiction.
As yet I am, alas! without
Instruction in the art of fippling,
Though something may be found about
It in the works of LEAR or KIPLING.
And possibly I may unearth
In LECKY or in LAURENCE OLIPHANT
Some facts to remedy my dearth
Of knowledge bearing on the Poli-
phant.
But, now their pictures I have seen
In GALPIN's learned dissertation,
So far as in me lies I mean
To bring about their restoration.
Yet since I cannot learn all three
And time is ever onward humming,
My few remaining years shall be
Devoted wholly to humstrumming.
That, when my bones to rest are laid,
Upon my tomb it may be written:
“He was the very last who played
Upon the Humstrum in Great
- Britain.”
THE SPIDER.
LATELY we had occasion to consider
the place of the grasshopper in modern
politics. Now let us consider the place
of the spider in our social life.
It seems to me that the spider is the
most accomplished and in some ways
the most sensible insect we have in
these parts. In my opinion a great deal
too much fuss has been made about the
bee. She is a knowing little thing, but
the spider is her superior in many ways.
Yet no one seems to write books or edu-
cational rhymes about the spider. It
is really a striking example of the well-
known hypocrisy and materialism of
the British race. The bee is held up to
the young as a model of industry and do-
mestic virtue—and why? Simply be-
cause she manufactures food which we
happen to like. The spider is held up
to the young as the type of rapacity,
malice and cruelty, on the sole ground
that he catches flies, though we do not
pretend that we are fond of flies, and
conveniently ignore the fact that, if the
spider did not swat that fly, we should
probably swat it ourselves.
The real charge against the spider is
that he doesn't make any food for us.
As for the virtue and nobility of the bee,
I don't see it. The only way in which
she is able to accumulate all that honey
at all is by massacring the unfortunate
males by the thousand as soon as she
conveniently can, a piece of Prussianism
which may be justified on purely mate-
rial grounds, but is scarcely consistent
with her high reputation for morality
and lovingkindness. If it could be shown
that the bee consciously collected all
that honey with the idea that we should
annex it there might be something to
be said for her on moral grounds; but
nobody pretends that. Now look at the
spider. We are told that as a commer-
cial product spider-silk has been found
to be equal if not superior to the best
silk spun by the Lepidopterous larvae,
with whom, of course, you are familiar.
“But the cannibalistic propensities of
spiders, making it impossible to keep
more than one in a single receptacle . . .
have hitherto prevented the silk being
used . . . for textile fabrics.” So that
it comes to this: if spiders are useless
because they eat each other, the bees
do much the same thing (only whole-
sale), but it makes them commercially
useful. The bee therefore we place upon
a pinnacle of respectability, but the
spider we despise. Faugh the hypo-
crisy of it makes me sick. My children
will be taught to venerate the spider
and despise the bee.
For, putting aside the question of
moral values, look what the spider can
do. What is there in the clammy,
not to say messy, honey-comb to be
compared with the delicate fabric of
the spider's web 2 Indeed, should we
ever have given a single thought to
the honey-comb if it had had no honey
in it 2 Do we become lyrical about
the wasp's comb? We do not. It is a
case where greed and materialism have
warped our artistic perceptions. The
spider can lower itself from the draw-
ing-room ceiling to the floor by a silken
thread produced out of itself. Still
more marvellous, he can climb up the
same thread to the ceiling when he is
bored, winding up the thread inside
him as he goes, and so making pursuit
impossible. What can the bee do to
equal that 2 And how is it done? We
don't even know. The Encylopædia
Britannica doesn't know; or if it does
it doesn't let on. But the whole tedi-
ous routine of the bee's domestic potter-
ing day is an open book to us. Ask
yourself, which would you rather do,
be able to collect honey and put it in a
suitable receptacle, or be able to let
yourself down from the top floor to the
basement by a silken rope produced out
of your tummy, and then climb up it
again when you want to go upstairs,
just winding up the rope inside you?
I think you will agree that the spider
has it. It is hard enough, goodness
knows, to wind up an ordinary ball of
string so that it will go into the string-
box properly. What one would do if
one had to put it in one's bread-box I
can't think. When my children grow
up, instead of learning
“How doth the little busy bee . . .”
they will learn—
How doth the jolly little spider
Wind up such miles of silk inside her,
When it is clear that spiders' tummies
Are not so big as mine or Mummy's 2
The explanation seems to be,
. They do not eat so much as me.
That will point the moral of moderation
in eating, you see. There will be a lot
more verses, I expect; I can see cram
and diaphragm and possibly jam com-
ing very soon. But we must get on.
The spider is like the bee in this
respect, that the male seems to have a
most rotten time. For one thing he is
nearly always about two sizes smaller
than the female. Owing to that and
to what The Encyclopædia Britannica |
humorously describes as “the greater ||
voracity” of the female (there is a lot of
quiet fun in The Encyclopædia Britan- |
nica), he is a very brave spider who
makes a proposal of marriage. “He
makes his advances to his mate at the
risk of his life and is not infrequently
killed and eaten by her before or after " |
they are engaged (“before or after" is
good). “Fully aware of the danger he
pays his addresses with extreme cau-
tion, frequently waiting for hours in her
vicinity before venturing to come to
close quarters. Males of the Argyopidae
hang on the outskirts of the webs of the
females and signal their presence to her
by jerking the radial threads in a peculiar
manner.” This is, of course, the origin
of the quaint modern custom by which
the young man rings the bell before at-
tempting to enter the web of his beloved
in Grosvenor Square. Contemporary
novelists have even placed on record
cases in which the male has “waited
for hours in her vicinity before ventur-
ing to come to close quarters; ” but too
much attention must not be paid to
these imaginative accounts. If I have
said enough to secure that in future a

little more kindliness and respect will
be shown to the spider in the nurseries
of this great Empire, and a little less
of it wasted on the bee, I have not
misspent my time.
But I shall not be content. Can we
not go further? Can we not get a little
more of the simplicity of spider life
into this hectic world of ours? In
these latitudes the spider lives only for
a single season. “The young emerge
from the cocoon in the early spring,
grow through the summer and reach
maturity in the early autumn. The
seres then pair and perish soon after
the female has constructed her co-
coon.” How delicious! No winter; no
bother about coal; no worry about the
children's education; just one glorious
summer of sport, one wild summer of fly-
catching and midge-eating, a romantic,
not to say dangerous wooing, a quiet
wedding in the autumn, dump the family
in some nice unfurnished cocoon—and
perish. Is there nothing to be said for
that? How different from the miser-
able bee, which just goes on and on,
worrying about posterity, working and

bee's. A. P. H.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ANNIVERSARY.
It began as quite an ordinary day.
I read my paper at breakfast and
Kathleen poured out the coffee. She
wore that little frown between her eye-
brows that means that she is thinking
out the menu for lunch and dinner and
hoping that Nurse hasn't burnt Baby's
porridge again. This is married life.
Then I started in a hurry for the
office, hurling a “Good-bye, dear"
through the open window as I passed.
The 9.15 leaves little time for affection.
That too is married life.
It was the sweetbriar hedge that
made me decide to miss the 9.15. It
clutched hold of me suddenly and told
me that the sky was very blue and the
woods very green, and that the office
was an absurd thing on such a day.
I went slowly back home round the
outside of the garden wall. Someone
was singing in the garden. I stopped
and whistled a tune. A face appeared
over the wall — rather an attractive
face.
“Hello! ” it said: “ someone I knew
a long time ago used to whistle that
tune outside my garden.”
“Hello!” I said; “come out for a
walk 2 ''
“I can't come out at the bidding of
young men on the highway. It isn't
done.” -
“Never mind. Come out.”
“Have I ever been introduced to
ou ? ''
“Introductions went out years ago.
Come by the side gate.”
She came. She held a shady hat in
her hand and walked on tip-toe.
“Sh!” she cautioned ; “no one must
see me. I have a reputation, you know.
I don't want the Vicar to denounce me
from the pulpit on Sunday in front of
Baby.” -
“I will be quite frank with you,”
she went on, holding out her left hand
with a dramatic flourish; “I am married
—I have a husband.”
I gave a hollow groan ; then, with a
manly effort, I mastered my emotion.
“I hope he's nice to you,” I said.
“No, he isn't. He grouches off to
the office in the morning and grouches
back in the evening and reads news-
papers. He's just grouched off now.”
“The callous brute!” I hissed through
my teeth. -
“There's worse than that,” she said
darkly.
“No 1 ''
“Yes. To-day, to-day is an anni-
versary, and he forgot it." The manner
was that of Madame BERNHARDt.
“Anniversaries,” I said reassuringly,
“are difficult to remember. They accu-
mulate so." - - - -
*
--
“Are you defending him?” she pro-
tested.
“Er—no,” I said hastily. “The
man's an unmitigated scoundrel. He
ought to be divorced or something.
What anniversary was it?”
“Our wedding-day,” she said with a
sob in the voice.
“Heavens !” I said.
tardly ruffian' "
“You wouldn't forget your wedding-
day, would you?”
“Never !" I said hoarsely.
“You're quite rather nice,” she
sighed.
“You’re adorable,” I said readily.
“How lovely My husband never
says things like that.” And she leant
against my shoulder.
We got on rather well after that.
We had lunch in an inn garden, where
you could smell lavender and sweet
peas and roses and where there were
box hedges turned under magical spells
into giant birds. We discovered a
stream in a wood with hart's-tongue
fern growing along its banks. I picked
her armfuls of wild roses.
“It's to make up,” I said, “because
your brute of a husband forgot your
wedding-day.”
“I'd love to be married to you,” she
said brazenly.
I turned aside to brush away a bitter
tear. - . . . - .
It was almost dusk when we got back
to the side gate.
“Good-bye,” she whispered. “Go
away quickly; I believe that's the
Vicar coming down the road." .
Then she shut the gate with gentle
swiftness in my face. I walked round
to the front door. She was in the hall.
“Hello!” she said; “I hope you had
a good day at the office?”
“Thanks,” I said; “pretty rotten.”
“I've had a lovely day,” she said;
“I picked up such a nice young man
in the high road. He's taking me out
to-night. He's just going to ring up
for seats.”
Without a word I went to the tele-
phone. -
The Right Order of Things at Last.
“A Gentleman would be pleased to Recom-
mond his Hutler in whose service he has been
three years.”—Daily Paper.
“Oh, the das-
“To AMERICANs IN LONDON.—The --
Cornwall, offers you comfortable home while

Republican prejudices respected.
There was a hard-swearing old sailor
Whose speech might have startled a

But he frankly avowed
That the charabanc crowd
Would not be allowed on a whaler.
THE PATIENTS’ LIBRARY.
Though a West-End physician of
repute, he must, I think, have had a
course of American training, if rapidity
of action be any indication thereof.
Scarcely had the maid ushered me
into his study and I had taken a seat
than he came forward brusquely, looked
at me with the glowering eye of the
Second Murderer, grasped a large piece
of me in the region of the fourth rib
and barked, “You’re too fat.”
Having been carefully bred I re-
frained from retaliation. I did not tell
him that his legs were out of drawing
and that he had a frightfully vicious
nose. But before I had time to explain
my business he had started on a series
of explosive directions: “Eat proper
food. Plenty of open air. Exercise morn-
ing, noon and night and in between.
Use the Muldow system. You need a
tonic.”
He turned to his table and was, I
suppose, about to draw a cheque for
me on the local chemist's when I decided
to say my little piece.
“Excuse me, Sir,” said I mildly, “I
am not a patient.”
The combination fountain-pen and
thermometer almost fell from his hand.
“I am,” said I, “the sole proprietor
and sole representative of the Physi-
cians' Supply Association. I gave your
maid my card. I have called with a
thrilling offer of magazines for your
waiting-room." -
“What dates?” said he, a gleam of
interest in his dark eye. -
“All pre-war,” said I proudly; “none
of them are later than 1900 and some
go back to 1880.”
“Not B.C. 2” said he, with a look in
which hope and disbelief were mingled.
“No,” said I. “All are A.D. ; but
they include two Reports of Missions
to Deep Sea Fishermen in 1885–very
rare. I'm sure they would match
splendidly the Proceedings of the Royal
Commission on Aniline Dyes which you
have in the waiting-room.” -
“No,” said he firmly. “I have one
of the most important practices in
Harley Street. I likewise possess one
of the finest collections of old magazines
in the profession. That blue-book on
Aniline Dyes is barely fifty years old.
It was left me by my father, and I
retain it simply through affection for
him in spite of its modernity. But
the rest go back to the Crimean vintage
and earlier. When you have some-
thing really old, come to me. But"—
and he threw in a winning smile in his
best bedside manner—“not till then."
I am now in search of a young
practitioner who is merely starting a
collection. -

IF sorrow's crown of sorrow is as the poet says, it should
be equally true that there is enough satisfaction in remem-
bering unhappier things to ensure success for The Crisis
of the Naval War (CAssell), the large and dignified volume
in which Admiral of the Fleet Viscount JELLIcoe of SCAPA,
G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O., reminds us how near the German
submarines came to triumph in 1917, and details the various
ways by which their menace was overcome. It is a solid
book, written with authority, and addressed rather to the
expert than to the casual reader; but even the latter indi-
vidual (the middle-aged home-worker, for instance, remem-
bering the rationed plate of beans and rice that constituted
his lunch in the Spring of 1917) can thrill now to read of the
precautions this represented, and the multiform activities
that kept that distasteful dish just sufficiently replenished.
I have observed that Viscount JELLICoE avoids any approach
to sensationalism. His book however contains a number
of exceedingly interesting photographs of convoys at sea,
smoke-screens, depth-charges exploding, and the like, which
the most uninformed can appreciate. And in at least one
feature of “counter-measures,” the history of the decoy or
mystery ships, the record is of such exalted and amazing
heroism that not the strictest language of officialdom can
lessen its power to stir the heart. Who, for example, could

“hotel-child,” through her detached and observant youth
to a womanhood austere, remote, inspired only by the wor-
ship of essential beauty, is told with an exquisite rightness
of touch that is a continual delight. Mr. HERGESHEIMER
has above all else the gift of suggesting atmosphere and
colour (ought I not in mere gratitude to bring myself to
say “color” 2); his picture of Linda's amazing mother and
the rest of the luxurious brainless company of her hotel
existence has the exotic brilliance of the orchid-house, at
once dazzling and repulsive. Later, in the course of her
married life, inspiring and inspired by the sculptor Pleydon
(in whose fate the curious may perhaps trace some echo of
recent controversy), the story of Linda becomes inevitably

less vivid, though its grasp of the reader's sympathy is
never relaxed. In fine, a tale short as such go nowadays,
but throughout of an arresting and memorable beauty. The
state of modern American fiction has, if I may say so with-
out offence, been for some time a cause of regret to the
judicious; let Mr. HERGESHEIMER be resolute in refusing
to lower his standard by over-production, and I look to see
him leading a return towards the best traditions of an
honourable past.
It is not an impossible conception that Sniping in France
(HUTchinson) will still be available in libraries in the year
2020 A.D., and I can imagine the title then catching the
eye of some enthusiastic sportsman, whose bent for game
sailors of Spain, and of Spaniards, in particular the Valen-
cians and Catalonians. Signor IBANEz' method is distinctly
discursive; he gives, for instance, six-and-twenty consecutive
pages to the description of the inmates of the Naples
Aquarium and is always ready to suspend his story for a
lengthy disquisition on any subject, person or place that
interests him. This puts him peculiarly at the mercy of his
transliterator, who has a positive genius for choosing the
wrong word and depriving any comment of its subtlety,
any well-made phrase of its distinction. Even plain
narrative such as the following is none too attractive :—
“The voluminous documents would become covered with
dust on his table and Don Esteban would have to saddle
himself with the dates in order that the end of the legal
is stronger than his knowledge
of history. Feeling that here is
a new class of shooting for him
to try his hand at, he will hasten | A
to acquaint himself with the
details and will discover that
the first of the essentials is a
European war in full blast.
Whether or not he will see his
way to arrange that for himself,
I don't know and, since I shall
not be present, I don't care.
But in any case he will be ab-
sorbed in an eminently scientific
and indeed romantic study of

will be left not a little impressed

plain soldier-man and his rooted dislike of all “specialists,”
becoming very heated in the small hours of the morning
about the paragraph on page 97, in which a division un-

band of “careless and ignorant tourists.”

ostensibly a yarn about spies and submarines, its hero a
gallant Spanish captain, Ulysses Ferragut, scion of a long
line of sailormen. And there can be no doubt of the proper
anti-German sentiments of this stout fellow, even though
his impetuous passion for Freya Talberg, a Delilah in the
service of the enemy, did make him store a tiny island with
what the translator will persist in calling combustibles,
meaning, one supposes, fuel. But more fundamentally it
is an affectionate song of praise of the Mediterranean and
the dwellers on its littorål, especially the fiery and hardy
own, thus appealing to a well-known instinct of boyhood,
but rendering the whole business of a more than Mere-
dithian obscurity to the uninitiate. I have hitherto for-
otten to say that the particular volume before me is called
The War Lord of Mars (METHUEN). I may add that it
closes with the heroic Carter hailed as Jeddak of Jeddaks,
which sounds eminently satisfactory, though without con-
veying any definite promise of finality.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FROM SPA AND SHORE.
GROGTown.—All available accommo-
dation has been monopolised by Glas-
borough visitors, among whom , this
resort is becoming more alarmingly
popular every year. Sixty charabancs
arrived on Monday and the Riot Act
was read several times before the pas-
sengers could be induced to desist from
their badinage of the residents, most
of whom have since retired behind the
wire-entanglements at Kelrose. The
municipal orchestra was subjected to a
brisk fusillade of rock-cakes on Saturday
night; the conductor and several of the
instrumentalists suffered contusions,
and their performances have since been
discontinued. This has not unnatur-
ally given rise to a certain amount of
dissatisfaction amongst the visitors, but
otherwise there has been no recrudes-
cence of rioting. A company of the
Caithness Highlanders, with machine-
guns, are now encamped on the links,
and sunshine is all that is needed to
complete the success of the season.
KEGNEss-On Tuesday the Mayor
presented a jar of whisky, fifty years
old, to the winning charabanc team
in the bottle-throwing competition, and
the subsequent scenes afforded much
diversion. A notable feature at present
is a large whale, which was washed
ashore in a gale about six months ago.
The oldest inhabitants declare that
they have never known anything like
it, and it is certainly an unforgettable
experience to be anywhere within a
mile of this apparently immovable dere-
lict. Excursions to all surrounding
places out of nose-shot are extremely
popular, and the beach is practically
deserted save by a few juvenile natives
engaged in the blubber industry.
MUDHALL SPA.—Without the least
reflection on chalybeates and the rest,
it must be allowed that the most popu-
lar beverage in Mudhall at present is
that which draws its virtue from a cereal
and not a mineral source. Hilarity is
rife at all hours, and the effort to enlist
a body of local volunteers to control
the exuberance of anti-Sabbatarian
“charabankers” is meeting with un-
expected support. The casualties in
the daily collisions between the Hydro-
pathic League and the Anti-Pussy-Foot-
Guards are steadily increasing and now
compare favourably with those of any
other Midland health-resort.
“A Boylston (Massachusetts) farm labourer
is said to havt bees identified as one of the heirs
to a £400,000 estate at Dundte, for whom
starches have betn made for years, but mothing
is known at Dundee of such an estate.”
Daily Paper.
But this lucid paragraph should help
to clear up the mystery.
AMONG THE PEDESTALS.
THE rumour that a number of Lon-
don's statues are to be moved to make
room for new has caused many a marble
heart to beat faster; and on making
a round of calls I gathered that Sir
ALFRED MoRD has few friends in
stone or bronze circles. Not the least
uneasy is George IV. in Trafalgar
Square. Uneasiness of body he has al-
ways known, riding there for ever with-
out any stirrups; but now his mind is
uneasy too. “If they take Father
from Cockspur Street,” he argued very
naturally, “why not me?”
A few of the figures feel secure, of
course, but very few. Nelson on his
column has no fears; Nurse Cavell is
too recent to tremble; so is Abraham
Lincoln. But the others ? They are
in a state of nervous suspense, wonder-
ing if the sentence of banishment is to
fall and resenting any disturbance of
their lives. “J”y suis, j'y reste” is their
motto.
Abraham Lincoln gave me a hearty
welcome and extended an invitation
that is not within the power of any
other graven image in the city. “Take
a chair,” he said. - -
I did so and am thus, I suppose, the
first Londoner to put that comfortable
piece of furniture to its proper use.
“How do you like being here?” I
asked.
He said that he enjoyed it. The only
blot on his pleasure was the fear that
the Abbey might fall on him, and he
therefore hoped that The Times' fund
was progressing by leaps and bounds.
His immediate neighbours, on the
contrary, exhibited no serenity what-
ever, and I found Canning and Palmer-
ston shivering with apprehension in
their frockcoats. The worst of it was
that I could say nothing to reassure them.
Here and there, however, a desire for
locomotion was expressed. Dr. John-
son, in the enclosure behind St. Clement
Danes, is very restive. I asked him if
he would object to removal. “Sir,”
said the Little Lexicographer (as his
sculptor has made him), “I should de-
rive satisfaction from it. A man cannot
be considered as enviable who spends all
his time in the contemplation, from an
unvacatable position, of a street to
the perambulation of which he devoted
many of his happiest hours.”
I ventured to agree.
“Nor,” continued the sage, “is it a
source of contentment to a man of in-
tegrity to observe an unceasing pro-
cession of Americans on their way to
partake of pudding in a hostelry that
has made its name and prosperity out
of a mythical association with himself
and be unable to correct the error.”
“Are you in general in favour of
statuary 2” I made bold to ask.
“Painting,” said he, “consumes labour
not disproportionate to its effect; but
a fellow will hack half a year at a block
of marble to make something in stone
that hardly resembles a man. Look
around you; look at me. The value of
statuary is owing to its difficulty. You
would not value the finest head cut
upon a carrot.” -
But one effect of this General Post
among the statues is good, and it should
delight, Mr. AsquitH. Cromwell, now
outside Westminster Hall, is to be
moved into the House. E. W. L.
FLOWERS’ NAMES.
MARIGoLDs.
As MARY was a-walking
All on a summer day,
The flowers all stood curtseying
And bowing in her way;
The blushing poppies hung their
heads
And whispered MARY's name,
And all the wood anemones
Hung down their heads in shame.
The violet hid behind her leaves
And veiled her timid face,
And all the flowers bowed a-down,
For holy was the place.
Only a little common flower
Looked boldly up and smiled
To see the happy mother come
A-carrying her Child.
The little Child He laughed aloud
To see the smiling flower,
And as He laughed the Marigold
Turned gold in that same hour.
For she was gay and innocent—
He loved to see her so—
And from the splendour of His face
. She caught a golden glow.
An Optimist.

Harnessed to a little shay.

Round the nigger minstrels' song.

Starved and ugly, mean, unkempt,
I have dreams by you undreamt,

AT THE PLAY.
“THE UNRNOWN.”
MR. SomeRSET MAUGHAM, who re-
cently intrigued and perhaps just a little
scandalised the town with a most en-
gagingly flippant and piquant farce all
about an accidentally bigamous beauty,
certainly shows courage in launching so
serious a discussion as The Unknown.
And in the silly season too. I see that
in a quite unlikely interview (but then
all modern interviews are unlikely) he
defends his right to discuss religion
quite openly on the stage. Of course.
Why should anybody deny that religion
is to the normally constituted mind,
whatever its doxy, an absorbingly inter-
esting subject; or that the War hasn't
made a breach in the barriers of British
reticence? Whether to the point of
making a perfectly good married Vicar
(anxious to convict a doubting D.S.O.
of sin) ask in a full drawing-room con-
taining the Vicaress, the Doctor and the
D.S.O.'s fiancée, mother and father,
“For instance, have you always been
perfectly chaste?”—I am not so sure.
Nor whether the War has really added
to bereaved Mrs. Littlewood's bitter
“And who is going to forgive God?"
any added force. f that kind of ques-
tion is to be asked at all it might have
been asked, and with perhaps more jus-
tice, at any time within the historical
period. For the War might reasonably
be attributed by the Unknown Defend-
ant thus starkly put upon trial to man's
deliberate folly, whereas . .
No doubt, however, Mr. MAUGHAM
would say the shock of war has (like
any other great catastrophe) tested the
faith of many who are personally deeply
stricken and found it wanting, while the
whisper of doubt has swelled the more
readily as there are many to echo it.
So Major John Wharton, D.S.O., M.C.,
having found war, contrary to his ex-
pectation of it as the most glorious
manly sport in the world, a “muddy, mad,
stinking, bloody business,” loses the
faith of his youth and says so, not with
bravado but with regret. The Vicar,
with dignity and restraint, but without
much understanding and not without
some hoary clichés; his wife, with
venom (suggesting also incidentally
sound argument for the celibacy of the
clergy); the old Colonel and his sweet
unselfish wife, with affection ; and
Sylvia, John's betrothed, with a strange
passion, defend the old faith, Sylvia to
the point of breaking with her lover
and getting her to a nunnery—a busi-
ness which will in the end, I should
guess, lay a heavier burden upon the
nuns than upon John. The indecisive
battle sways hither and thither. It is

Mrs. Littlewood—a very fine interpre-
tation of an interesting character. Mr.

Colonel to his military repertory. This
actor always plays with distinction and
with an ease of which the art is so
cleverly concealed as perhaps to rob
him of his due meed of applause from
the unperceptive. Lady TREE made a
beautiful thing of the character of Mrs.
Wharton, whose simple unselfishness
was the best of all Mr. MAUGHAM's
arguments for the defence. Mr. R. H.
HIGNETT nobly restrained himself from
making a too parsonic parson, yet kept
enough of the distinctive flavour to ex-
cite a passionate anti-clerical behind

THE MYSTERY.
George and I are two ordinary
people. He studies the Weather Re-
ports every day; I do occasionally.
He thinks he understands meteorology;
I don't. But lately I felt that I must
have some explanation of the weather,
so I asked George to explain it.
He said, “Certainly ; it's quite
simple. Take wind. Wind is caused
by differences of pressure.”
“What is pressure? Who is pressing
what 2 ” -
“Pressure is what the barometer
tells you—not the thermometer; you
must keep the thermometer out of this.
Suppose it is very hot in London—”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” -
“Well, suppose it is very hot at a
place A p >
“I thought we were keeping the
thermometer out of this.”
“It comes in indirectly. But don't
keep interrupting. If it is very hot
at the place A, the air at A rises. You

“ No.”
“Obviously it does.

“Well, the result of that is that
there is less pressure at A. In other
words, there is more room for the air
to move about. When that happens
the air at the place B–"
“Where is that ?”
“Oh, anywhere. I told you to think
of two places, A and B.”
“No, you told me to think of a

because it is very hot there.”
“Well, this is another place, where

what we call wind.” -
“I see.”
“No, you don't. It isn't quite so
simple as that. Now, the atoms of air
rushing from B to A don't go straight
there, but they travel in—in sort of
circles.” -
“Why do they do that 2"
“Well, the fact is that these atoms
are so keen to get over to A, where
there is plenty of room, that they jostle
each other, and that makes them go
round and round. If they go round
and round against the clock, like that,
they are called cyclones, or depressions,
or low-pressure systems. If they go
with the clock, like that, it is an anti-
cyclone.”
“Oh ”
“What do you mean—“Oh '2"
“What I said ; but go on.”
“Now suppose this air—"
“Which air 2 ”
“The air from B. Suppose it is
travelling in a cyclone x -
“But isn't a cyclone a low-pressure
thingummy?”
“Yes.”
“And didn't you say that B was a
high-pressure place?” -
“Yes.”
“Then how does the air coming from
B manage to be low-pressure stuff?”
“I see what you mean. There is an
explanation, but it would take too long
to hazard it now. Suppose the air is
coming from B in an anti-cyclone,

“All right. I'll suppose that.”

“Well, the whole thing started with
it being very hot at A, you remember,
so that the air rose. If it had been
hotter still at B just then the air would
have risen at B instead, and it couldn't

been a frightful muddle.”

THE TRANSMIGRATION OF BOWLES.
LITTLE Mr. Bowles was very happy
as long as he was only second mechanic
at the garage of Messrs. Smith Brothers,
of High Street, Puddlesby. It was
when he became a member of the
Puddlesby Psychical Society that his
troubles began. Up till then he had
been as sober and hard-working a little
man as ever stood four foot ten in his
shoes and weighed in at seven stone
four. But above all he was an expert
in rubber tyres; he knew them, I had
almost said, by instinct.
The Puddlesby Psychical Society be-
lieves in the Transmigration of Souls.
As I am not a member myself I'm
afraid that that is all I can tell you
friend Sir Hugh the Hairy, who, how-
ever, did not seem particularly struck
with the suggestion, but made a counter-
proposal of maces on horseback at the
neighbouring lists in three days' time.
Before our hero knew what he was
about he found that he had agreed. He
got through a deal of heavy thinking
on his way home to his castle, but had
fortunately completed his plan of cam-
paign before he arrived, for the esquire
of his enemy was awaiting him there,
demanding to know the details of the
coming contest. He made the condi-
tions suggested by Sir Hugh, merely
adding that the maces must be smooth
and not knobbed, as was customary in
the better-class combats of that day.
He then began to make his prepara-
hole till there be no more breath in thy
vile bodie. Blow me hard and leally.
Blow an thou burst in ye blowinge.”
Whereupon the trusty varlet blew.
Thus it fell out that when the trumpet
sounded and the Black Baron of Beau-
maris, his foe, rode forth from his sable
pavilion, armed cap-à-pie in a suit of
highly-polished steel and bestriding a
black and rather over-dressed charger,
he saw through the chinks of his lowered
visor an object which he would un-
doubtedly have mistaken for a diminu-
tive observation balloon if he had lived
a few centuries later. In short, Sir
Bowles, having been sufficiently in-
flated by his now exhausted esquire,
had inserted his valve-pin into the tube
(which he had tucked away and laced
about it. It is a little
difficult at first sight,
perhaps, to see the
connection between
Transmigration and
rubber tyres, but if
you will have patience
I think I can promise
to show you that at
least.
One night our Mr.
Bowles came home
late from a meeting
of the P.P.S., fell
asleep at once and
had what he regarded
as a “transmigratory
experience in a retro-
gressive sense.” The
world was not the
world he knew. He
perceived that it was
sundown on the 8th
of August, 1215, that
he was no longer plain
Bowles, but rather Sir
Guide (after ascent of a hundred-and-twenty steps). “THESE, SIR, ARE THE
FAMoUs GARGoyLES I MENTIONED.”

up like an association
football), and now
emerged upon the lists
with a feeling of ela-
tion that he had not
experienced for several
days.
They approached
each other. It was
with some difficulty
that our hero wielded
his mace, owing, first,
to the inflated condi-
tion of his right arm,
and, secondly, to the
unaccustomed weight
of the weapon. His
hold also upon his
curvetting steed was
a little precarious, and
he hoped that no one
in the crowd would
notice the string that
tied his legs together
beneath the horse's
belly.
\
Bors the Bowless, Knight of the Artful
Arm, and known to his intimates as
“The Fire-eater”; that he had just been
challenged to fight his seven hundred
and forty-seventh fight, and (for the
seven hundred and forty-seventh time)
he had accepted. He soon added to the
stock of his information the fact that,
as the challenged party, he had the
choice of time, place and weapons.
He was naturally a little perturbed
at first, for the most formidable warrior
that he ever remembered fighting was
his little sister, whose hair he had pulled
when they were children, and the big-
gest thing he had ever killed was un-
doubtedly the hen that he had run over
on the Boodle Road. He felt inclined,
therefore, in the first flush of terror, to
propose as the time 1925, as the place
Puddlesby Football Field, and as the
weapon, motor-tyre valve pins, at two
hundred yards. He even got as far
as mentioning these conditions to his
tions. At first he was considerably
depressed by the entire absence of all
rubber, until dire necessity compelled
him to find a serviceable substitute in
the shape of untanned ox-skins. These
he carefully sewed together with his
own knightly hands, coating the stitches
over with pitch and resin. He was a
good workman and did not fail to be
ready in time.
When the hour of combat arrived he
vanished into the painted pavilion re-
served for him at one end of the lists, ac-
companied only by his faithful esquire.
Hastily he donned his suiting of re-
inforced ox-hide, which covered the
whole of his person from head to foot,
and hung stiffly in folds all round him.
Then, holding out a metal tube which
was attached to the front of the cos-
tume, he presented it to his esquire,
saying in the vernacular of those stout
times—
“Ho, varlet ! Blow me down yon
If the Baron was surprised at what
he saw he made no sign, but, riding
straight at his strange antagonist, he
dealt him a mighty blow on the left
side of the head, which had quite an
unlooked-for result. The string which
attached our hero's legs held, it is true,
but he naturally lost his balance, and,
being knocked to the right, disappeared
temporarily from the Baron's view.
But the force of his swing was such
that, at the moment when he was head
downwards under the horse, he still had
enough way on to bring him up again
on the other side. No sooner had he
regained a vertical position than the
Baron repeated the blow on the same
spot and with the same result.
Then the same thing happened again
and again; and indeed Sir Bowles might
have revolved indefinitely, to the intense
delight of the distinguished audience,
had not the string broken at the thirty-
fourth revolution.

Now the involuntary movements of
our hero had accelerated at every turn,
and when finally he parted company
with his trusty steed he was going
very fast indeed. Falling near the edge
of the lists, he found touch, first bounce,
in the Royal Box, whence some offici-
ous persons rolled him back again into
the field of play. -
It must not be supposed that poor
Sir Bowles was comfortable during
these proceedings. The rather ingeni-
ous apparatus whereby he had hoped
to catch a glimpse of his adversary had
got out of order at the first onslaught,
and he was in total darkness. More-
over, he soon discovered that the
haughty Baron was taking all sorts of

round the lists; in short, was playing
polo with him. -
But apart from the physical and
mental discomfort of his situation he

So was Bowles. He was just saying
to himself, “Thank heaven I thought

made his hair stand on end.
His enemy was fumbling at the
lacing of his tunic!
Then poor little Sir Bowles gave
himself up for lost and almost swooned
away. He felt the Baron undo the
lace and pull out the tube. There was
a perplexed pause . . .
And just as the Baron was pulling
out the valve pin little Mr. Bowles
woke with a shriek.
I suppose it was the fact that he had
come straight from a symposium on
transmigration that made little Bowles
imagine he had been recurring to a
previous existence. I myself should
have thought that the rules of the
game required the reincarnation of Sir
Bors to be a rather more bloodthirsty
and pugnacious person than our hero;
and the sequel seems to prove that
little Bowles thought the same. I think
he felt he was not quite the man for
this sort of rough work, even in the
retrospect of dreams. Anyway, shortly
after his painful experience he with-
drew his subscription from the Pud-
dlesby Psychical Society and ceased
for ever to assist at their séances.

CHANGES IN CLUB-LAND.
(By a Student of Manners.)
THE Roman satirist sang of poets
reciting their verses in the month of
August. If he were alive now he would
find as fruitful a subject in the reno-
vations and decorations of Clubland.
Clubs are strange institutions; they go
in for Autumn not Spring cleaning.
Happily all Clubs are not renovated
at the same time, otherwise the desti-
tution of members would be pitiful to
contemplate. Even as it is the tem-
porary accommodation offered by their
neighbours is not unattended by serious
drawbacks. The standard of efficiency
in bridge and billiards is not the same;
the cuisine of one Club, though admir-
able in itself, may not suit the diges-
tions of members of another; the op-
portunities for repose vary consider-
ably. In short, August and September
are trying months for the clubman
who is obliged to remain in London.
But by October Pall Mall is itself again,
and we are glad to be able to state that
in certain Clubs the amenities and com-
forts available will be greatly enhanced.
For example the Megatherium, which
is now in the hands of the decorators,
is being painted a pale pink outside, a
colour which recent experiments have
shown to exert a peculiarly humanising
and tranquillising influence on persons
of an irritable disposition.
tuous dormitory is being erected on the
top floor, where slow music will be dis-
coursed every afternoon, from three to
seven, by a Czecho-Slovak orchestra. A
roof-garden is being laid out for the
recreation of the staff, and the velocity
of the numerous lifts has been keyed up
to concert pitch. Steam heat will be
conveyed from the basement to radia-
tors on every floor, and each room is
being provided with a vacuum-cleaning
apparatus, a wireless telephonic outfit
and an American bar. The renovation
of the library is practically complete,
the obsolete books which cumbered its
shelves having been replaced by the
works of DELL, BARCLAY, WELLs, ZANE
GREY and BENNETT. Three interest-
A sump-

Club may be given with due reserve-
the first, that in the near future women
will be admitted to membership; the
second, that Lord Ascliffe has obtained
a complete control of its resources;
and the third, that its name will be
shortly changed to “Alfred's,” on the
analogy of “Arthur's.” .

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, August 9th.-In an atmo-
sphere of appropriate gloom the House
of Lords discussed the latest Coercion
Bill for Ireland. Even the LoRD CHAN-
CELLOR could say little more for the
measure than that it might possibly
enable some of the persons now in cus-
tody to be tried; and most of the other
Peers who spoke seemed to think that
it would be either mischievous or use-
When Viscount CURzoN renewed his
anti-charabancs campaign and Sir
ERIC GEDDES was doing his best to
maintain an even mind amid the con-
tradictory suggestions showered upon
him, the Ministerial eye was caught by
the red gleam from Colonel WEDG-
wooD's shirt-front. At once the old rail-
way instinct reasserted itself. Recog-
nizing the danger-signal and hastily
cramming on his brakes, Sir ERIC
observed that it would be “a great

“I think it would be a calamity if we did anything to prevent the economic use of charabancs.”—Sir Eric Groors.
A week ago the Peers decided by a
very small majority—28 to 23—that
there should be no Minister of Mines, but
only an Under-Secretary. Lord PEEL
now sought to induce them to change
their minds. His principal argument
was that a Minister would only cost
five hundred pounds a year more than
a Secretary and would secure the “har-
mony in the coal-trade" now so con-
spicuously lacking. The Peers evi-
dently thought this too good to be true,

less. The only confident opinion ex-
pressed was that of the elderly Privy
Councillor, who from the steps of the
Throne ejaculated, “If you pass this
Bill you may kill England, not Ireland.”
But despite this unconventional warn-
ing the Peers took the risk.
The event of the day in the House of
Commons was Colonel WEDGwood's tie.
Of ample dimensions and of an ultra-
scarlet hue that even a London and
South-Western Railway porter might
envy, it dominated the proceedings

Tuesday, August 10th. — As Lord
Great Chamberlain, and therefore offi-
cial custodian of the Palace of West-
minster, Lord LINcoLNSHIRE mentioned
with due solemnity the regrettable in-
cident of the day before. Lord CURzoN
thought the offender (the Right Hon.
A. CARLISLE) should be allowed to ex-
plain his behaviour, and suggested that
he should himself address to him a suit-
able letter. Several noble lords—antici-
pating, no doubt, that, whatever else
came of it, the correspondence would fur-
nish lively reading—said “Hear, hear.”

There was a big assemblage in the
Commons to hear the PRIME MINISTER's
statement on Poland. The Duke of
York was over the Clock, flanked by
the Archbishop of CANTERBURY on
one side and Messrs. KAMENEFF and
KRASSIN (who sound, but do not look,
like a music-hall “turn") on the other.
Some facts bearing, more or less, on
the situation were revealed at Question-
time. Mr. CHURCHILL denied that he
had ever suggested an alliance with the
Germans against Bolshevism, and, as
we are keeping the Watch on the Rhine

with only thirteen thousand men—just
three thousand more than it takes to
garrison London—perhaps it is just as
well. He has, I gathered, no great
opinion of the Bolshevists as soldiers.
In his endeavour to describe the dis-
gust of our troops in North Russia at
being ordered to retire before “an enemy
they cordially despised ” he nearly dis-
located his upper lip. -
For two-thirds of his speech the
PRIME MINISTER was the sober states-
man, discussing with due solemnity the
grave possibilities of the Russo-Polish
crisis. The Poles had been rash and
must take the consequences. We
should not help them unless the Bol-
shevists, not content with punishment,
threatened the extinction of Poland's
independence.
Then his mood changed, and for a
sparkling quarter of an hour he chaffed
the Labour Party for its support of the
Soviet Government, an unrepresenta-
tive self-appointed oligarchy. To make
his point he even sacrificed a colleague.
LENIN was an aristocrat, TROTSKY a
journalist. “In fact"—turning to Mr.
CHURCHILL —“my right honourable
friend is an embodiment of both.”
A brief struggle for precedence be-
tween Mr. Asquith and Mr. ADAMSON
ended in favour of the Ex-PREMIER,
who doubted whether the best way to
ensure peace was to attack one of the
parties to the dispute, and proceeded
to make things more or less even by
vigorously chiding Poland for her aggres-
sion. Mr. CLYNEs, while admitting
that the Labour Party would have to
reconsider its position if the indepen-
dence of Poland was threatened, still
maintained that we had not played a
straight game from Russia.
Later on, through the medium of
Lieut.-Commander KENworTHY, com-
munication was established between
the Treasury Bench and the Distin-
guished Strangers' Gallery. Mr. LLOYD
GEORGE read the terms offered by the
Soviet to the Poles, and gave them a
guarded approval.
Wednesday, August 11th.-A Bill to
prohibit ready-money betting on foot-
ball matches was introduced by Lord
GAINFord (who played for Cambridge
forty years ago) and supported by Lord
MEATH, “a most enthusiastic player”
of a still earlier epoch. The Peers could
not resist the pleading of these experts
and gave the Bill a second reading; but
when Lord GAINFord proposed to rush
it through goal straightaway his course
was barred by Lord BIRRENHEAD, an
efficient Lord “Keeper.”
A proposal for the erection at the
public expense of a statue of the late Mr.
Joseph CHAMBERLAIN furnished occa-
sion for the PRIME MINISTER and Mr.
Asquith to indulge in generous praise
of a political opponent. Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE (with his eye on the Sovietists)
pointed out that, as this was “essentially
a Parliamentary country,” we did well
to honour “a great Parliamentarian";
and the Ex-PREMIER (with his eye on
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE) selected for special
note among Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's char-
acteristics that he had “no blurred
edges.” -
A humdrum debate on the Consoli-
dation Fund Bill was interrupted by
the startling news that France had
decided, in direct opposition to the
policy announced yesterday by the
PRIME MINISTER, to give immediate
recognition to General WRANGEL. Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE expressed his “surprise
and anxiety” and could only suppose
that there had been an unfortunate
misunderstanding. To give time for its

More Headaches for the Historian.
Messrs. KAMENEFF and KRAssIN, the
Soviet envoys, were in the Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery during the PRIME
MINISTER's speech on Poland last week.
Hence these tears:—
“In conversation they seem to betray only a
limited acquaintance with English, but every
word of Mr. Lloyd George's utterance seemed
intelligible to them. Not only did they follow
him with eager interest, but often with ani-
mated comment.”—Evening Standard.

during the whole of the Premier's speech.” .

“Krassin could follow every word of Lloyd
George. His colleague doesn't speak or under-
stand English, so Krassin every few minutes
leaned over and whispered a translation into
the other's ear.”—Star.
“The Soviet envoys, especially M. Krassin,
seemed somewhat restless, and appeared to
take more interest in the scene than in the
speech, but this I heard attributed to their
difficulty in following the words of the Prime
Minister.”—Pall Mall Gazette.
BLEWITT ON REAL PROPERTY.
229th ed., folio, 2 vols. (Sour and
Tarwell, 85s.).
ALL persons interested in this en-
trancing subject will welcome the new
edition of Mr. Blewitt's famous work.
The book is one which should be found
on every shelf throughout the country,
and is undoubtedly, in its combination
of erudition and artistic merit, one of
the masterpieces of English literature.
It has been well described by a more
competent critic as one which “it is
difficult to take up when once you have
put it down,” and in this judgment
most readers will, we believe, concur.
It seems needless for us to say any-
thing about so well-known a work, and
to say anything new is, we believe,
impossible. Mr. Blewitt is invariably
happy in his choice of subject, and
in this treatise on Real Property his
sparkling wit, his light style and clear-
ness of expression do ample justice to
the perennial freshness of his subject.
The reader is swiftly carried from situ-
ation to situation and thrill follows
thrill with daring rapidity. The plot is
of the simplest, but worked out with
surprising skill, while the events are
related with that vivid imagination
which the subject demands. Who is
there that does not feel a glow of exal-
tation and rejoice with the heir when
he comes, upon reversion, into the pro-
perty from which he has been so long
excluded ? Mr. Blewitt treats this inci-
dent with a sense of romance and pic-
turesqueness of language reminiscent
of the ballad of “The Lord of Lynn.”
In its facts the ballad bears a striking
resemblance to those so graphically
described by our author, but in point
of execution lacks the true breath of
poetic inspiration which pervades Mr.
Blewitt's book.
Nor is his work wanting in pathos.
There are few who will not sympathise
with the hero when he discovers that
the life-estate of the fair widow whom
he adores with all the fierce yearnings
of his passionate soul is subject to a
collateral limitation to widowhood. Mr.
Blewitt's silence on the disappointment
which embittered his spirit and the
|
doubts which tormented his mind is
more eloquent than any soliloquy of
Hamlet.
It is not however in description but
in characterisation that Mr. Blewitt is
pre-eminent. We know of nothing in
works of this nature to equal the skilful
psychological analysis, the sympathy
of treatment and the fidelity to nature
with which the author draws line by
line the character of Q. The description
of him as seised in fee simple is a touch
of genius. We can remember nothing

THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.
A South INDIAN LovESONG.
WHEN the long trick's wearing over and a spell of leave
comes due -
The most 'll go back to Blighty to see if their dreams are
true;
There's some that 'll make for the Athol glens and some
for the Sussex downs, -
There's some that'll cling to the country and some that'll
turn to towns; -
But I know what I'll do, and I'll do it right or wrong,
I'll just get back to the Blue Mountains, for that's where
I belong.
Athol's a bonny country and Sussex is good to see,
But it's long since I left Blighty and I'm not what I used
to be ; - -
And May in Devon's a marvel and June on Tummel's fine,
And that may be most folk's fancy, but it somehow isn't
mlne ;
For I know what I like, and the Land of Heart's Delight
For me is just on the Blue Mountains, for that's where I
feel right.
So I'll pack my box and bedding in the old South Indian
mail
And wake to a dawn in Salem ghostly and grey and pale,
And over by Avanashi and the levels of Coimbatore
I'll see them hung in the tinted sky and I won't ask for
more ;
For I'll know I'm happy and I'll make my morning prayer
Of thanks for the sun on the Blue Mountains and me to be
going there.
The little mountain railway shall serve me for all I need,
Crawling its way to Adderly, crawling to Runnymede;
And the scent of the gums shall cheer me like the sight of
a journey's end,
And the breeze shall say to me “Brother" and the hills
shall hail me “Friend,”
While the clear Kateri River sings lovesongs in my ear,
And I'll feel “Now I'm home again! Ah but I'm
welcome here.”
Clear in the opal sunset I shall see the Kundahs lie
And the sweep of the hills shall fill my heart as the roll of
the Downs my eye;
And I'll see Snowdon and Staircase and the green of the
Lovedale Wood,
And the dear sun shining on Ooty, and ol, but I'll find it
ood ;
For ; 'll have what I wanted, and all the worrying done,
Because I'm back to the Blue Mountains and they and I
al‘e One.
There's peace beyond understanding, solace beyond desire
For minds that are over-weary, for bodies that toil and tire,
And over all that a something, a something that says,
“You know,
It's the one place of all places where the gods meant you
to go.”
Well, the gods know what they know, and I wouldn't say
them nay,
And Blighty of course is Blighty, but it's terribly far away,
So I'll get back to the Blue Mountains, and the betting is,
I'll stay. H. B.

WHAT TO DO WITH OUR BOYS.
As a sufferer from the prevailing complaint, house-famine,
I have started a Correspondence Bureau, ostensibly for
advising parents as to the pursuits their offspring should
take up, but really for propaganda purposes, the object
being the assuagement of this terrible evil.
Consequently my replies to inquiries are all moulded to
this end.
For instance, one mother wrote from Surbiton —
“My second son, Algernon, wishes to become a house
and estate agent. Do please tell me if you think this
quite a fitting avocation for one whose father is a member
of the Stock Exchange.”
I replied, “Quite. There is no nobler, and incidentally
there are few more lucrative occupations outside Bradford,
unless it be that of a builder, in which the scope is abso-
lutely unlimited. I am enclosing a copy of last week's
Builder and Architect, in which you will find some great
thoughts expressed. Pray let Algernon read it. It may
be the means of inducing him to perform great deeds for
England's sake.”
Another fond parent wrote:—
“Can you advise an anxious mother as to a career for
her only son, John William ” He is at present eight and
a-half years old, has blue eyes and fair hair and is a per-
fect darling, so good and obedient, but he is firmly resolved
to be a lift-man when he grows up.”
I answered her soothingly thus:—
“John Willie is rather young to have made a final de-
cision, I think. Let his youthful aspirations run through
the usual stages, liftman, engine-driver, bus-conductor,
sailor, etc. At fifteen or so he will have left these behind,
and for the next few years will probably settle down to the
idea of being nothing in particular, or else a professional
cricketer. Then he will suddenly, for good or evil, make
his choice. Neither his blue eyes nor his fair hair give any
clue as to what that choice will be, but I should let him
keep both, as they may be useful to him.
“If he should determine upon a career involving manual
work, I should take steps to have him initiated into the Art
and Mystery of Bricklaying. At the rate we are moving
the working-hours would probably be about eight per week,
with approximately eight pounds per day salary, by the
time he arrives at bricklaying maturity. -
“It is difficult to say yet whether he would have to
graduate in Commerce before being eligible, but probably
it would be necessary, as the best bricklayers, I'm told,
always carry a mortar-board, and there is a sort of caucus
in these plummy professions nowadays that is anxious to
keep outsiders from joining their ranks. But the country
needs bricklayers, and will go on needing them for years.
Let John Willie step forward when he is old enough.”
To the mother who asked if I considered that her young-
est boy would be well advised to adopt the Housebreaking
profession I wrote:–
“To which part of this profession do you refer? If to
the Burgling branch I would ask, ‘Has he the iron nerve,
the indomitable will, above all has he the brain power for
this exacting craft 2 Can he stand the exposure to the
night air, the exposure before an Assize jury, and the
rigours of the Portland stone quarries?' If so, let him
take a course of illustrated lectures at the cinema.
“If you refer to the other branch, the mere pulling down
of houses, I say, ‘No! A thousand times, no!' He should
be taught that there is a crying need for a constructive,

not a destructive policy. Let him adopt one; buy him
drawing-paper and a tee-square at once, and teach him that
the noblest work of creation is (unless it be a bricklayer or
builder) an architect. Though the War is over we must
still keep the home fires burning. This implies chimneys,
and chimneys imply houses, and few there be that can
plan houses that will both please the eye and pass the local
authorities.”
Lady Jubb wrote from Toſtley Hall, Blankshire, to say
that her elder son (seventeen) had no ideas for the future
beyond becoming Master of the Barchester when he grew
up, but that she was anxious that he should try for some
more lucrative post, official preferred.
I replied thus:—
“So your son looks no higher than a Mastership of Fox-
hounds. Well, well, I suppose that so long as there are such
things as hounds he, as well as another, may take on the job
of Master.
“But I thoroughly approve of your desire that he should
try for something higher in life, especially for some official
post; and what official post is or can be superior to that
of a Borough Surveyor? Can you not persuade him that
this great office is what one chooses to make it, and that,
as an autocrat, the M.F.H., is hardly to be compared to the
B.S., for, whereas the former can at the most scorch the
few people foolish enough to remain within ear-shot, the
latter can with a breath damn a whole row of houses and
blast the careers of an army of builders with a word." '
And so the propaganda proceeds.
If my efforts result in even one house being erected I
shall, I think, have earned my O.B.E., though I would
rather have the house.

No buttons to be polished, no army boots to wear,
And nobody to tick you off because you grow your hair.
It's great to sleep beneath a roof that keeps the rain outside,
To eat a daintier kind of grub than quarter-blokes provide,
To rise o' mornings when you wish and when you wish

Intent on getting nowhere and foot-slogging back again,

A TASTE OF AUTHORITY.
I HAVE often wished I were an ex-
pert at something. How I envy the
man who, before ordering a suit of
clothes from his tailor, seizes the prof-
fered sample of cloth and tugs at it in
a knowledgable manner, smells it at
close quarters with deep inhalations
and finally, if he is very brave, pulls out
a thread and ignites it with a match.
Whereupon the tailor, abashed and dis-
comfited, produces for the lucky expert
from the interior of his premises that
choice bale of pre-war quality which
of teas. I snatched a handful of that
which he specially recommended and
began the ceremony. I took a little into
the palm of my left-hand and gazed at
it earnestly; I rubbed it lightly with
my fingers; I picked up a strand and
bit through the leaf slowly with the
front teeth. Just after biting I passed
the tongue behind the front teeth and
along the palate, completing the act of
deglutition.
So far as I could judge it was very
good tea, but it would never do to
accept the first sample offered; I must
let the shopman see that he was up
nauseating, but the man was obviously
impressed. At the conclusion of my
performance I assumed a look of satis-
faction. “Give me five pounds of that,”
said I with the air of a conqueror.
Next time I met Rottenbury I told
him of my success.
“Oh, Jorkins put you up to the trick,
did he 3 ''
“He did. He taught me to titillate,
to triturate, to masticate, to deglute—
everything.”
“And with what result 2 ”
“With the result that I have in my
possession five pounds of the finest tea
he was keeping for his own
use.
I confided this yearning of
mine to Rottenbury the other
evening. Rottenbury is a
man of the world and might,
I thought, be able to help me.
“My dear fellow,” he said,
“in these days of specialis-
ation one has to be brought
up in the business to be an
expert in anything, whether
cloth or canaries or bath-
room tiling. Knowledge of
this kind is not gained in a
moment.”
“Can you help me?” I
asked.
“As regards tea, I can,”
he replied. “Jorkins over
there is in the tea business.
If you like I'll get him to
put you up to the tricks of
tea-tasting.”
“I should be awfully glad
if you would,” said I. “We
never get any decent tea at
home.”
Jorkins appeared to be a
man of direct and efficient
character. I saw Rottenbury
speak to him and the next
moment he was at my elbow.
“Watch me carefully,”
said Jorkins, “and listen to
what I say. Take a little

“Yes.”

with the front teeth, thus. Just after
biting pass the tip of the tongue be-

palate, completing the act of degluti-
tion. Sorry I must go now. Good
day.”
§ow I felt I was on the right track.
I practised the thing a few times before
a glass, paying special attention to the
far-away poetical look which Jorkins
wore during the operation.
At the tea-shop the man behind the
counter willingly showed me numbers
against one of the mandarins of the
trade. So I said with severity, “Please
don't show me any more common stuff;
I want the best you have.”
The man looked at me curiously
and I saw his face twitching; he was
evidently about to speak.
“Kindly refrain from expostulating,”
I went on ; “content yourself with
showing me your finest blend.”
He went away to the back of the
shop, muttering; clearly he recognised
defeat, for when he returned he carried
a small chest.
“Try this,” said he, and I knew that
he was boiling with baffled rage.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
To review one of Mr. E. F. BENsoN's social satires always
gives me somewhat the sensations of the reporter at the
special sermon—a relieved consciousness that, being pre-
sent on business, my own withers may be supposed pro-
ſessionally unwrung. Otherwise, so exploratory a lash . . .
I seldom recall the touch of it more shrewd than in Queen
Lucia (HUTCHINsoN), an altogether delightful castigation of
those persons whom a false rusticity causes to change a
good village into the sham-bucolic home of crazes, fads
and affectation. All this super-cultured life of the Rise-
holme community has its centre in Mrs. Lucas, the acknow-
ledged queen of the place (Lucia = wife of Lucas, which
shows you the character of her empire in a single touch);
the matter of the tale is to tell how her autocracy was
threatened, tottered and recovered. I wish I had space to
quote the description of the Lucas home, “converted" from
two genuine cottages, to which had been added a wing at
right-angles, even more Elizabethan than the original, and
a yew-hedge, “brought entire from a neighbouring farm and
transplanted with solid lumps of earth and indignant snails
around its roots.” Perhaps, apart from the joy of the
setting, you may find some of the incidents, the faith-
healer, the medium and so on, a trifle obvious for Mr.
BENson. More worthy of him is the central episode—
the arrival as a Riseholme resident of Olga Bracely, the
operatic star of international fame. Her talk, her attitude
towards the place, and the subtle contrast suggested by her
between the genuine and the pretence, show Mr. BENson at
his light-comedy best. In short, a charming entertainment,
in speaking of which you will observe I have not once so |
much as mentioned the word “Cotswolds.” -
Michael Forth (CoNSTABLE) will doubtless convey a won-
derful message to those of us who are clever enough to
grasp its meaning; but I fear that it will be a disappoint-
ment to many admirers of Miss MARY Johnston's earlier
books. Frankly I confess myself bewildered and unable to
follow this excursion into the region of metaphysics; indeed
I felt as if I had fallen into the hands of a guide whose
language I could only dimly and dully understand. All of
which may be almost entirely my fault, so I suggest that ||
you should sample Michael for yourselves and see what
you can make of him. Miss Johnston shouldered an
unnecessarily heavy burden when she decided to tell the
story of her hero in the first person, but in relating Michael's
childhood in his Virginian home she is at her simplest
and best. Afterwards, when Michael became intent on
going “deeper and deeper within,” he succeeded so well
that he concealed himself from me.
Because I have a warm regard for good short stories and
heartily approve the growing fashion of publishing or ||
republishing them in volume form, I am the more jealous
that the good repute of this practice should be preserved
from damage by association with unworthy material. I'm
afraid this is a somewhat ominous introduction to a notice
of The Eve of Pascua (HEINEMANN), in which, to be bru-
tally frank, I found little justification for even such lon-
gevity as modern paper conditions permit. “RICHARD !
DEHAN" is admittedly a writer who has deserved well of
the public, but none of the tales in this collection will do

anything to add to the debt. The best is perhaps a very
short and quite happily told little jest called, “An Im-
pression,” about the emotions of a peasant model on seeing
herself as interpreted by an Impressionist painter. There
is also a sufficiently picturesque piece of Wardour Street
medievalism in “The Tribute of the Kiss,” and some
original scenery in “The Mother of Turquoise." But be:
yond this (though I searched diligently), nothing; indeed
worse, since more than one of the remaining tales, notably
“Wanted, a King” and “The End of the Cotillion,” are so
preposterous that their inclusion here can only be attri-
buted to the most cynical indifference.
It may be my Saxon prejudice, but, though most of the
ingredients of Irish Stew (SKEFFINGTON) are in fact Irish,
and though Mrs. DoRothea CoNYERs is best known as a
novelist who delights in traditional Ireland and traditional
horses, I am bound to confess that I enjoyed the adven-
tures of Mr. Jones, trusted employé of Mosenthals and Co.,
better than Mrs. ConyERs' stage Irishmen. “Our Mr.
Jones" is neither a Sherlock Holmes not an Aristide Pujol,
neither a Father Brown nor a Bob Pretty, but nevertheless
he is an engaging soul and we could do with more of him.
“putting it on.” Mr. Evarts understands, sentimentalises
less than most interpreters; seems to know a good deal.
The story loses no interest from being set in the American
hinterland of a few decades ago. All real animal lovers
should get this book—they should really.
If it be true art, as I rather think someone has said it is,
to state what is obvious in regard to a subject while
creating by the manner of the statement an impression of
its subtler features, then Mr. PERCY BRowN, in writing
Germany in Dissolution (MELRose), has proved himself a
true artist. For in Germany about the time of the Armistice
and during the Spartacist rising certain things happened
which got themselves safely into the newspapers, and these
he sets forth, mostly in headline form. Beyond this Ger-
many was a seething muddle of contradictions and cross-
purposes, which, it is hardly unfair to say, are capably re-
flected in his pages. Mr. BRowN is a journalist of the
school that does not stick at a trifle, a German prison, for
instance, when his dear public wants news. His crowning
achievement was to persuade Dr. Solf, when Foreign
Minister, to send through the official wireless an account
of an interview with himself, which would, as he (Solf)

much ever seems to
if Mrs. CoNYERs would refrain from trying to spell Eng-
lish as the Irish speak it. If the reader knows Ireland
it is unnecessary and merely makes reading a task. If
the reader does not know Ireland no amount of phonetic
spelling will reproduce a single one of the multitudinous
brogues that fill Erin with sound and empty it of sense.
On the whole Mrs. CoNYERs' public will not be disap-
pointed with her latest sheaf of tales. But it is Mr. Jones
who will give them their money's worth.
I was, I confess, a little sceptical—you know how it is—
when I read what Messrs. HopDER AND STOUGHToN's official
reviewer said of Mr. HAL. G. Evarts' The Cross-Pull: “The
best dog story since The Call of the Wild,” etc., etc. Well,
I certainly haven't seen a better. Mr. Evarts' hero, Flash,
is a noble beast of mixed strain—grey wolf, coyote, dog.
The Cross-Pull is the conflict between the dog and the
wolf, between loyalty to his master and mistress whom he
brings together and serves, and the wolf whose proper busi-
ness is to be biting elks in the neck. Happier than most
tamed brutes he is involved as chief actor in a round up of
some desperate outlaws, among whom is his chief enemy,
and he is fortunate enough to serve the state while pursuing
to a successful end his bitter private quarrel. Brute Brent
gets and deserves the kind of bite which was planned by a
far-seeing providence for the elk . . . You can tell when
an author really loves and knows animals or is merely
come of it all, and we are left at the end about as wise as
we started. All the same, much of the book's detail is
interesting, however little satisfaction it offers as a whole.
Ann's First Flutter (ALLEN AND UNwiN) will not arouse
any commotion in the dovecotes of the intellectually elect,
but it provides an amusing entertainment for those who
can appreciate broad and emphatic humour. Mr. R. A.
HAMBLIN has succeeded in what he set out to do, and my
only quarrel with him is that I believe him to have a
subtler sense of humour than he reveals here. Ann was a
grocer's daughter, and after her attempt to flutter for her-
self had failed she married Tom Bampfield, a grocer's son.
Tom had literary ambitions, and was the author of a novel
which his father thought pernicious enough to destroy his
custom. Strange however to relate, the novel failed to de-
stroy anything except the author's future as a novelist, and
when Tom did succeed in making some pen-money it was by
means of a series of funny articles in The Dry Goods Gazette
—articles so violently humorous that the author's father
thoroughly appreciated them. Mr. HAMBLIN's fun, let me
add, is never ill-natured. Even bilious grocers will not
resent his jovial invasion of their kingdom.

AN APOLOGY TO THE BENCH.
Humbly addressed to T. E. S.
IF ever, where you hold the Seat of Doom,
I stand, my Lord, before you at the Bar,
And my forensic fame, a virgin bloom,
Lies in your awful' hands to make or mar,
Let it not prejudice my case, I pray,
If you should call to mind a previous meeting
When on a champion course the other day . .
I gave your Lordship four strokes and a beating.
I own it savoured of contempt of court,
Hinted of disrespect toward the Bench, -
That I should chuckle when your pitch was short
Or smile to see you in the sanded trench :
But Golf (so I extenuate my sin)
Brings all men level, like the greens they putt on ;
One common bunker makes the whole world kin,
And Bar may scrap with Beak, and I with Sch-TT-N.
Nor did I give myself superior airs;
I made allowance for defective sight;
“The bandage which impartial Justice wears
Leaves you,” I said, “a stranger to the light;
Habituated to the sword and scales,
If you commit some pardonable blunder,
Iſ " (I remarked) “ your nerve at moments fails
With grosser ironmongery, where's the wonder?”
So may the Law's High Majesty o'erlook
My rash presumption; may the memory die
Of how I won the match (and further took
The liberty of mopping up the bye);
Remember just a happy morning's round,
Also the fact that this alleged old fogey
Played at the last hole like a book and downed
The barely human feat of Colonel Bogey. O. S.

expect to see a general use of her lively methods; and as a matter of fact
I have been able already, through the use of a patent futurist reading-

FROM “FIRST AID to LITERATURE.”
By Edmund Gosse.
. . . Not the least interesting and delicate of my duties
as a confidential adviser were connected with a work of
reminiscences which created some stir in the nineteen-
twenties. How it came about I cannot recollect, but it was
thought that my poor assistance as a friendly censor of a
too florid exuberance in candour might not be of disservice
to the book, and I accepted the invitation. The volume
being by no means yet relegated to oblivion's dusty shelves
I am naturally reluctant to refer to it with such particu-
larity as might enable my argus-cyed reader to identify it
and my own unworthy share therein, and therefore in the
following dialogue, typical of many between the author and
myself, I disguise her name under an initial. Quis custo-
diet 2 It would be grotesque indeed if one whose special
mission was to correct the high spirits of others should
himself fail in good taste.
Mrs. A. (laying down the MS. with a bang). I see nothing
but blue pencil marks, and blue was never my colour.
Why are you so anxious that I should be discreet? In-
discretion is the better part of authorship.
EDMUND (earnestly). It is your fame of which I am
thinking. If you adopt my emendations you will go down
to history as the writer of the best book of reminiscences
in English.
Mrs. A. (with fervour). I don't want to go down to
history. I want to stay here and make it. And you (with
emotion)—you have cramped my style. I can't think why
I asked you to help.
EDMUND. Everyone asks me to help.
I am the Muses' amicus curiae.
Mrs. A. Oh, blow Latin (Lighting two cigarettes at once)
What's the good of reminiscences of to-day, by me, without
anything about L.G. 2

sonable. There are occasions when reticence is imperative.

It is my destiny.

FROM “A WEEK IN LovELY LUCERN.E.”
By D. Lloyd George.
. . . I do not say that the mountains hereabout are not
more considerable than those of our own beloved Wales,
but as material to be employed in perorations they are far
inferior. There is not the requisite mist (which may symbo-
lise ignorance or obstinacy or any temporary disturbance or
opposition), later to be dispelled by the strong beams of the
sun (representing either progress generally or prime-minis-
terial genius or pure Coalitionism). Other local features I
felt, however, I might find rhetorically useful, such as THoR-
wALDSEN's Lion, so noble, so—so leonine, but doomed ever
to adhere to the rock, how symbolic of a strong idealist un-
able to translate his ameliorative plans into action The
old bridge too, uniting the two sides of the city, as one can
attempt to link Radicalism and Coalitionism—how long
could it endure ? And so on. One's brain was never idle.
It was while we were at Lucerne that Lord RIDDELL
and I had some of our most significant conversations. I
set them down just as they occurred, extenuating nothing
and concealing nothing.
Lord RIDDELL (with emotion). You are in excellent
form to-day. Lucerne now has two lions—one of them
free. .
DAVID (surprised). I free ? (Sadly) You forget that
GIoIITTI is coming. -
Lord RIDDELL. But that is nothing to you.
with your Italian and he will soon go.
DAVID. You are a true friend. You always hearten me.
Lord RIDDELL (with more emotion). But you are so
wonderful, so wonderful! And now for to-day's amusements.
Where shall we go? Up Mount Pilatus or to WILLIAM
TELL's Chapel?
DAVID. There is something irresistible to a Welshman in
the word chapel. Let us go there. And WILLIAM TELL,
was he not a patriot? Did he not defy the tyrant? I am
sure that in his modest conventicle I can think of a
thousand eloquent things. Let us go there.
Lord RIDDELL. My hero! my dauntless hero!

Mabel. “WELL, THEN, LET ME TELL You A story About Tiro LiTTLE Boys.”
THE RABBITS GAME.
“DoN'T forget to say “Rabbits' to:
morrow,” said Angela. Angela is aged
nine and my younger sister; I am
thirteen and my name is Anne.
We both looked inquiringly at Father,
| and, as he didn't seem to remember,
| Angela in pained surprise began to
explain.
“If you say “Rabbits' before
you say anything else on the first day
of a month you get a present during
the month, but you mustn't say any-
thing else first, or you won't.”
It all came out in one breath and,
though it looks clear enough now,
Father was very stupid.
“I dislike rabbits,” he said, “and I
am very busy; your Mother will prob-
ably be glad of them for the servants.”
The rebuke in Angela's eyes was
severe. “We haven't got any rabbits,”
she said; “we are only going to say
Rabbits' to-morrow morning when we
wake up and we thought you might
like to do the same.”
“Oh, I should,” said Father; “thank
you very much, I won't forget.” And he
wrote “Rabbits" down on his blotting-
paper. “Now go and tell your Mother;
she would like to say “Rabbits' too, I
know.”
That seemed to terminate the inter-
view, so we left him; but altogether it
was not very satisfactory. You see,
when we had “Bon-jour-Philippines,”
Father used to provide the presents;
at least that was some time ago; we
haven't had any “Bon-jour-Philippines”
lately. The last time we did, Jack,
that is my brother at Oxford, found one
and split it with Father, and the next
morning he said, “Bon-jour-Philippine”
first and then asked for a present.
Father asked him what he wanted, and
he gave Father a letter that he had
had that morning. Father got very
angry and said that it was a disgrace
the way tailors allowed credit to young
wasters nowadays. He didn't say it
quite like that, it was rather worse, and
Mother said, “Hush, dear; remember
the children,” and Father said that they
were all as bad and in the conspiracy
to ruin him, and he went out of the
room and banged the door.
Mother told Jack that he should have
chosen a better moment, and Jackowned
he had made a mistake and said that
he ought to have got it in before Father
had looked at the paper and seen the
latest news of LLoyd GEORGE. I don't
quite know what he meant, but Father
often talks about LLOYD GEORGE, and
he must be a beast.
I asked Jack later if he got his pre-
sent, and he said that he had, but—and
here he copied Father's voice so well
that I had to laugh—“It is the very
last time, my boy; when I was at
Oxford I used to consider my Father,
and I would have worked in the fields
and earned money sooner than have
given him bills to pay.” Jack said
that he knew one of the dons at Oxford
who knew Father, and from what he
said he thought that Father must have
spent as long in the fields as NEBUchAD-
NEzzAR did.
I remembered all this as I went to
find mother about “Rabbits,” and I
wasn't quite sure that we should get
our present even if we did say it, so I
told Angela, and she had a brilliant
idea. “We will make Father say
‘Rabbits’ and give him a present our-
selves, and he is sure to give us some-

thing in return.” Angela is younger
than I am, but she often thinks quite
clever things like that, and they come
in very useful sometimes.
We went to the summer-house in
the garden to make plans. First we
thought what would be the best pre-
sent to give Father. Last Christmas
we gave him a pipe, and he said that
it was just what he wanted; it cost
ninepence and was made like a man's
head, and you put the tobacco in a hole
in his hat.
Father lit it at once after breakfast,
but two days after I saw Jakes the
gardener smoking it. We thought at
first that he had stolen it, and I went
to Father, but he said that Jakes had
thirteen children, and when a man was
in trouble like that you ought to give
up what you valued most to try to
make that man happy, and that Jakes
was awfully pleased when he gave him
the pipe.
You see that made it very difficult,
as we had to get something that Father
would like and Jakes too, as he still
had thirteen children; and then I re-
membered that Mrs. Jakes had once
looked at a woollen jumper that I had
on, and said that it would be just the
thing for her Mary Ann, who had a deli-
cate chest, and Jakes would be sure to
like what Mrs. Jakes liked, or else he
wouldn't have married her. Of course
a jumper wasn't really the sort of thing
that Father could wear, but I thought
he might wrap his foot up in it when
he next had gout, and besides Ishouldn't
be wanting it much more myself, as the
summer was coming on.
Angela said that she thought that
would do well, and she wouldn't mind
giving Father her jumper next month
if he said “Rabbits,” and it would do
for Mrs. Jakes' next little girl.
So that was decided, and then we had
to arrange the plan. The most import-
ant thing was for us to wake before
Father, so that we could wake him and
remind him before he had time to say
anything else, and Angela remembered
that Ellen, that's the housemaid, had
an alarm clock, which she used to set
at a quarter to six each morning. We
waited until Ellen had gone down-
stairs and then took it and hid it in
Angela's bed.
Next morning the clock went off.
We were both rather frightened, and
it was very cold and the room looked
funny, as the blinds hadn't been pulled
up, but we put our dressing-gowns on.
Then Angela said that she had heard
that if you woke a person who was
walking in their sleep they sometimes
called out, so I took a pair of stockings
from the basket that had just come back
from the wash to hold over Father's

mouth while we woke him. They were
waiting to be mended and had a hole
in them, but that didn't matter much,
as I screwed them up tight, and then
we went into Father's room. The
were both asleep, and Father had his
mouth open all ready for the stockings,
which was very lucky, as I was won-
dering how I could get them in.
We crept up to the bed, and I know
I shivered, and I think Angela did too,
as I was holding her hand. Then she
called out “Boo" as loud as she could,
and I stuffed the stockings into Father's
mouth, and then they both woke up,
and everything went wrong.
Mother thought the house was on
fire and screamed, and it made Angela
begin to cry. I quite forgot to tell
Father to say “Rabbits,” and just
pressed the stockings further into his
mouth.
Father" struggled and made awful
noises, and when he did get the stock-
ings out the things he said weren't a
bit like “Rabbits,” and the only thing
that he did say that I could write down
here was that he thought he was going
to be sick. The rest was dreadful.
We were both sent back to bed, and
that morning as a punishment we were
not allowed into the dining-room until
Father and Mother had finished their
breakfast; and Angela, who often thinks
quite clever things, said that we had
better not do “Rabbits" again for a
good long time. But after all it didn't
matter much as the weather got a great
deal colder, and I wore my jumper a
lot, and so did Angela.

Fluttering in the April breeze,
Spread tracts of blossom, green and

Curtseying to the golden light—
The broken laugh of Dame's Delight.

FIRST LOVE AND LAST.
[It is pointed out by a contemporary that
the dressmaker's waxen model has quite lost
her old insipid air. The latest examples of the
modeller's art show the “glad eye” and features
with which “any man might fall in love.”]
IN the days when I started to toddle
I loved with a frenzy sublime
A dressmaker's beauteous model—
I think I was three at the time;
She was fair in the foolish old fashion,
And they found me again and again
With my nose in an access of passion
Glued tight to the pane.
But I thought they were gone past
returning
Till Time should go back on his tracks,
Those days of a child's undiscerning
But fervent devotion to wax ;
Could a heart, though admittedly restive,
Recapture that innocent mood
At sixty next birthday? I'm blest if
I thought that it could.
But Art, ever bent on progression,
Has taken the model in hand,
And brought in the line of succession
A figure more pleasingly planned ;
Her eyes with the gladdest of glances,
Her lips and her hair and her cheek
Can puncture like so many lances
A bosom of teak.
HARD TIMES FOR HEROINES.
“Oh, Bertram,” breathed Eunice as
she glided into his arms, “if Ernest
knew, what would he think?”
At this point of my story I admit
that I was held up. I myself couldn't
help wondering how Ernest would re-
gard the situation. He was a perfectly
good husband and, personally, I pre-
ferred him to Bertram the lover. I
might get unpopular with my readers,
however, if they suspected this, so I
continued:—
“Ernest can never appreciate you as
I do, dearest,” Bertram whispered
hoarsely : “he is cold, hard, indiffer-
ent x *
Again I paused. If Eunice had been
the really nice girl I meant her to be
she would have asked Bertram what on
earth he meant by saying such things
about her husband, and would have
told him the shortest cut to the front-
door. In which case she might never
have got into print.
The fact is the poor heroine of fiction
has a hard time of it nowadays. Some-
one ought to write a treatise on “How
to be Happy though a Heroine,” or
uphold her cause in some way. Twenty-
five years ago she lived in a halo of
romance. Her wooers were tender,
respectful and adoring; she was never ||
without a chaperon. Her love-story
was conventional and ended in wedding
bells. To-day—just see how her posi-
tion has altered. Generally she begins
by being married already. Then her
lover comes along to place her in awk-
ward predicaments and put her to no
end of inconvenience, very often only
to make her realise that she prefers her
husband after all. Or, on the other
hand, the modern writer does not mind
killing off, on the barest pretext, a
husband who is perfectly sound in
wind and limb and had never suffered
from anything in his life until the lover
appeared. The poor girl will tell you
herself that it isn't natural.
Then there is the compromising
situation. Magazine editors clamour
for it—in fiction, I mean. We find the
heroine flung on a desert island, with the
one man above all others in the world
that she detests as her sole companion.
It is rather rough on her, but often still
more rough on other people, as it may
necessitate drowning the entire crew
and passengers of a large liner just in
order to leave the couple alone for a
while to get to know each other better.
And not until they find that they care
for one another after all does the rescue
party arrive. It will cruise about, or
be at anchor round the corner, for
weeks and weeks, so that it can appear
on the horizon at the moment of the
first embrace. This situation is so
popular at present, that it is surprising
that there are enough desert islands to
go round.
Again, the lonely bungalow episode
is pretty cheerless for the heroine. She
accepts an apparently harmless invita-
tion to spend a week-end with friends
in the country. . When she arrives at
the station there is no one to meet her.
After a course of desert islands this
ought to arouse her suspicions, but she
never seems to benefit by experience.
At the bungalow, reached in a hired
fly and a blinding snowstorm, she finds
the whole household away. The four
other week-end guests, her host and
hostess and their five children, the
invalid aunt who resides with the
family, the three female servants and
the boot-boy who lives in—all have
completely vanished. The only sign
of life for miles is the hero standing on
the doorstep looking bewildered and
troubled, as well he might, for he
knows that he must spend the night
in a sinowstorin to avoid compromis-
ing the heroine. -
And when the family return next
morning and explain that they went out
to look at the sunset, but were held up
at a neighbour's by the weather, nobody
seems to think the excuse a little thin.
The heroine can never hope for a
tranquil existence like other people. I
read of one only recently who, just
because she strongly objected to the
man her parents wanted her to marry,
was flung with him on an iceberg that
had only seating capacity for two.
And when the iceberg began to melt—
writers must at times manipulate the
elements—it meant that she must
either watch the man drown or share
the same seat with him. The rescue
party held off, of course, until the
harassed girl was sitting on his knees,
and then received the pair as they slid
down, announcing their engagement.
What do I intend to do with Bertram
and Eunice 2 I am undecided whether
to place them in the vicinity of a
volcano, which, unknown to Bertram,
has eruptive tendencies, or to send
them up in an aeroplane and break the
propeller in mid-Atlantic just as the res-
cue party (including the husband)
What 2 Do I understand anything
about aeroplanes? Certainly not; but
I know everything about heroines.
EVIDENCE.
“WHAT's all this I hear about the
Abbey 2” said my friend Truscott when
I met him yesterday.
Truscott has just returned from New
Zealand and is for the moment a little
behind the times. But he can pick up
the threads as quickly as most men.
“It's in a bad way,” I told him.
“All kinds of defects in the fabric, and
there's a public fund to make it sound
again. You ought to subscribe.”
“It may be in disrepair,” he replied,
“but it isn't going to fall down just
yet. I know ; I went to see it this
morning." •
“But how do you know?” I asked.
“You may guess; you can't know.”
“I know,” he said, “because I was
told. A little bird told me, and there 's
no authority half so good. Do you re-
member a few years ago a terrific storm
that blew down half the elms in Ken-
sington Gardens 2 " .
I remembered. I had reason; for
the trunks and branches were all over
the road and my omnibus from Church
Street to Piccadilly Circus had to make
wide detours.
“Well,” Truscott continued, “ some-
one wrote to the papers to say that
two or three days before the storm all
the rooks left the trees and did not
return. They knew what was coming.
Birds do know, you know, and that's
why I feel no immediate anxiety about
the Abbey.”
“Explain,” I said.
“Well,” he continued, “when I was
there this morning I watched a sparrow
popping in and out of a nest built in a
niche in the stonework over the north
door.”

THOUGHTS ON “THE TIMES.”
(FROM A TRAIN.)
REALLY the news is very bad this
morning. On the front page there are
two Foreign crises and a Home one.
On the next page there is one Grave
Warning and two probable strikes. On
every other page there is either a poli-
tical murder or a new war. It is
awful . . .
Yet somehow I don't feel depressed.
I rather feel like giggling. An empty
smoker in the Cornish express—empty
once how they eat. And it is so much
easier to decide which is the sister and
which the fiancée of the young man
when they are all stationary at a table.
When you only see them rushing about
passages in ones it takes days.
All the usual families will be there,
I suppose — the Bradleys and the
Clinks, old Mrs. Puntage and the kids
—if they can afford it this year .
Very likely they can't. I can't, cer-
tainly. But I'm going.

“In diplomatic circles no
one is attempting to conceal
that the situation is extremely
grave.” Now which situation
is that ? That must be one
of these world-plots. Don't
really see how civilisation can
carry on more than a week or
two now. Lucky I only took
a single, perhaps. It was only
two pounds, but I
enough for a return. Never
shall have enough, probably—
but no matter. If the world
is coming to an end, might as
well be in a good part of it at
the time. . it would be
sickening to be snuffed out
with an unused return-ticket
pink perhaps. How jolly the country
looks! Superficial, of course; the har-
vest's ruined; no wheat, no fruit. And
unemployment will be very bad. And
the more people there are unemployed
the more people will strike . . . Sounds
funny, that ; but true . Hope
they've given us the usual table in the
coffee-room, that jolly window-table in
the corner, where one can look across
the bay to the cliffs and the corn-fields
and the hills . . . Only there's no
corn, I suppose, this year . . . And one
has a good view of the rest of the room
there . . . can study the new arrivals
at dinner, instead of having to wait till
afterwards. Dinner is much the best
time to study them; you can see at
Europe were decided in a few hours,
have issues of such gravity engaged the
attention of the British race. . . .”
Dreadful. I shall get some tennis to-
morrow. I shan't be called. I shall
get up when the sun is on my face and
not before. I shall dress very, very
slowly, looking at the sea and the
sands and the sun, not rushing, not
shaving properly, not thinking, not
washing a great deal, just sort of falling
into an old coat and some grey flan-
nels. . . . Then I shall just sort of
fall downstairs—about half-past nine,
and give the old barometer a bang.
Then breakfast, very deliberate, but
cheerful, because the glass went up
when I banged it—it always goes up at
in one's pocket.
On the sands after lunch—build a
few castles and dams and things for
the children—at least, not altogether for
the children, not so much as they think,
anyhow. Tea at the farm, with plenty
of cream, possibly an egg . . . No eggs
this winter, I see; some question of
non-unionists. Then a little golf before
dinner—and perhaps a little dancing
afterwards. Coffee, anyhow .
Then The Times arrives, all wrapped
up, just as one is explaining about
the seventh hole. It is all stiff and
crinkly, and one spends a long time re-
arranging it, flattening out the folds . . .
And one never reads it. That's the
best of all. A. P. H.

The Cheerful One. “CoNGRATULATIONs, old chap, on HINDING Your GAME AGAIN.”
Club Grouser. “FINDING MY GAME!
PRONE.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
SIR,--I am an architect (of forty-
three years' standing) and I like to
keep au courant with everything in the
world of building (or of being about to
build). Consequently anything new in
constructional material interests me,
and in this connection I would like to
ask you what is or what are Prone? I
have only seen it (or them) mentioned
once, and from the context I gather
that the word “prone" stands for the
plural of “prone" (as “grouse" is the
plural of “grouse,” and as “house"
might well stand for the plural of
“house" nowadays, considering the
shortage of dwellings), and that it (or
they) is (or are) used either as a floor
covering or otherwise in connection
with working on the floor or ground.
My reason for so thinking is con-
tained in the following interesting item,
culled from a well-known daily news-
paper:—
“There is in Londom one man at least who
* hard every day and has to lay prone to
0 lt.
He may be seen daily in the cloisters of
Westminster Abbey re-cutting the names on
the flagged gravestones which have been worn
by countless pilgrims' feet. He has picked
out many illustrious names, and others are to
follow.”
The sex and species of this hard-
worker preclude the motion of any ovi-
parous act, and I take it that one “lays
prone " as one lays a mat or strip of
carpet, for the purpose of facilitating
labour that is done on the knees or
stomach. If I am right I should like
to get my builder to order some for his
workmen absolutely at once.
Anything which would help to defeat
the Trade Unions in their fight against
speeding-up would be a blessing, espe-
cially to the architectural world, so
perhaps you will be good enough to
enlighten me on the nature of Prone,
and where obtainable.
Believe me, Yours very gravely,
ONESIMUs STONE (F.R.I.B.A.).

“Other great American short story writers

Of lake and stream and river:

Big salmon-flies the scoffer buys,
Long rods and wading stockings;
Unpicturesque he walks in Esk
With unbelief and mockings.
“A river-horse O-ho, of course !”
And shouts with ribald laughter;
He does not see in his cheap glee
The kelpie trotting after.
The storm comes chill from off the hill:
An eerie wind doth holloa ;
And near and near by surges drear
The water-horse doth follow.

Yea, to my mind 'tis little short of tragic .
That men no longer buy your potent spheres of magic!
Scarce less detested than the Bulgar bullet

And what of Calomels and Soda Sals?

Whose world-wide influence must have been terrific
Since first it found its footing in the Line?
The British Tommy took it by the million—
Why should it fail to sell now he has turned civilian 2
It is not base ingratitude that blinds him
To recognition of an ancient debt,
But rather that the sight of these reminds him
Of painful days which he would fain forget,
When life was one long round of guards and drills,
Marches, patrols, fatigues and sick parades—and pills.
Yet hear me, maker of the potent pilule:
Although my days of soldiering are o'er, .
I'm fondly trusting that, when next I'm ill, you i
Come to my rescue as you came of yore;
Meanwhile you'll understand that I, for one,

GEORGE, JANE AND LENIN.
Now that Soviet rule in England is
apparently so imminent it seems to me
that we ought to consider a little more
closely the application of its practical
machinery. The morning papers reach
this village at three o'clock in the after-
noon, so that nobody is in to read them,
and when one comes back in the even-
ing one is generally too lazy, but a
couple of rather startling sentences
about the coming Communist régime
have recently caught my eye. .
“The people of England, like the
people of Russia,” runs the first, “will
soon be working under the lash.” And
the second, so far as I remember, says,
“Our rations will no doubt be reduced
to half a herring and some boiled bird-
seed, which is all the unhappy Russians
are getting to eat.”
Before these changes fall suddenly
upon us I think we should ponder a
little on the way in which they will
affect our urban and agricultural life.
Take the House of Commons. A
very large and symbolic knout might
occupy the position of the present mace,
and from time to time the SPEAKER
could take it up and crack it. As this
needs a certain amount of practice it will
be necessary to select a fairly horsey
man as Speaker, and the Whips, who
will follow the same procedure, should
also be skilled practitioners. I see no
difficulty in applying the same method
to commercial and factory life in gen-
eral, still less to the packing of the
Underground Railway and the loading
of motor-omnibuses and trams.
It is rather when we come to scat-
tered rural communities that the system
seems likely to break down. Take the
case of George Harrison in this village.
When I first met George Harrison, and
he said that he thought the weather
was lifting, he was carrying a basket
of red plums which he offered to sell
me for an old song. On subsequent
occasions I met him—
1. Driving cows. (At least I sup-
pose he was driving them ; he was sit-
ting sideways on a large horse doing
nothing in particular, and some of the
cows were going into one field and
some into another, and a dog was biting
their tails indiscriminately.) -
2. Clearing muck and weeds out of
the stream.
3. Setting a springe for rabbits.
4. Delivering letters, because the
postman doesn't like walking up the
hill.
Now I maintain that there would
be insuperable difficulties in making
George carry out all these various ac-
tivities under the lash. Anyone, I sup-
pose, under a properly constituted
Soviet régime might be detailed as
George Harrison's lasher, Mr. SMILLIE,
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON, Lord CURzoN,
Mr. CLYNEs or the Duke of Northum-
BERLAND. Can you imagine Mr. CHES-
TERTON walking about on guard duty
in a rabbit warren while George Harri-
son set springes in accordance with the
principles laid down by the Third Inter-
nationale for rabbit-smaring 2 or the
Duke of Northumberland standing in
gum-boots in the middle of a stream
and flicking George Harrison about the
trousers if he didn't rake out old tin
cans at forty to the minute as laid down
by the Moscow Code? Now I ask you.
And then there is this half a herring
and boiled bird - seed arrangement.
George Harrison has a sister of eighteen
who kindly comes in to do cooking and
housework for us every day. She thinks

us frightfully queer, and if we bought
some herrings and bird-seed and asked
her to cook them for us I have no doubt
she would oblige, but, though she doesn't
much care what we eat, there are a lot
of things she doesn't eat herself, and
fish is one of them. Porridge, which, I
suppose, is a kind of bird-seed, is another.
Not that Jane calls it eating, by the
way. She calls it “touching,” and there
are any number of things that she doesn't
fancy touching. She will touch enor-
mous platefuls of bacon or sausages or
almost any derivative of the domestic
pig, and the same applies to puddings
and cake. But beef and mutton she
does not touch, nor margarine, and we
have to be almost as careful that Jane
Harrison has plenty of the right things
to touch as about the whole of the rest
LUCERN.E.
O, every dog must have its day
And ev'ry town its turn;
For fair is fair. . . and, anyway,
Let's talk about Lucerne.
Lucerne is in Switzerland, and I am
in Lucerne. The moment I heard that
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE was coming to
Lucerne I felt that a new importance
was added to Switzerland, to Lucerne,
to me and, if I may say so, to Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE. But I felt that, if I
didn't do something about it, Lucerne
and Mr. LLoyd GEORGE would get away
with all the credit and my part in the
affair would be overlooked.
The question arose as to what to call
that “something” 2. After a great deal
of thought I decided to try you with
a short and simple “Lucerne,” one of
and to have at last a little uninter-
rupted holiday. Probably he counts
on the difficulty of getting at him there,
having regard to that terrible bit of the
journey Bern—Luzern, which covers
sixty miles, takes three hours and in-
volves twenty-four stops, even if you
take the mid-day express. There is a
train in the afternoon (its number is
5666, and I warn you against it) which
takes four hours, though it only stops
twenty-four times also. The sinister
fact is that all the trains on this route
stop as often as they can, which I
attribute to that general wave of idle-
ness which is to-day spreading over
Europe. But number 5666 is worse
than others; or else it is getting old
and tired. I notice that among the
trains doing the return journey there is
of the family.
Now here again I
think it would be quite
possible to induce the
people of England in
our large industrial cen-
tres to ration them-
selves on boiled herring
and bird-seed. We
should not use those
names, of course. The
advertisements on the
hoardings would say:—

vest of THE SEA

no number 5666; I sup-
a. pose it has just as much
** as it can do to get there
--- and that it never does
return.
The PREMIER was not
far out to count on this
protective element, and
it is still the fact that,
if you approach Luzern
carelessly, it is ninety-
nine to one that you
will spend the best years
of your young life on
that particular stretch
of railway. But nowa-
days there is a back
way round, by Basel.
Be quite firm in asking
for your ticket. If the
ticket man says, “You
mean Bâle?” or, “You
mean Basle?” say," No,
I don't. I mean Basel.”
--
º
But propaganda of that sort would
have no effect on Jane. She would
simply say that she never cared to
touch herrings and that she did not
fancy hemp-seed. “
When I consider the cases of George
and Jane I am bound to believe either
that the Russian moujiks (if this is still
the right word) are more docile and
tractable than ours, or else that the
Soviet régime will need a great deal of
adaptation before it can be extended
to our English villages. Or, of course,
it may be possible that some of the
minuter details of M. LENIN's adminis-
tration have not been fully revealed to
me. I shall find out about this no doubt
when I return to London. In the
meantime I am banking on George and
Jane, whatever the Council of ACTION
may do. Evof.

my reasons being that, if you get down
to the hard facts, there is no such
place.
Try (as the G.P.O. suggests to dis-
appointed envelopes)—try
LUZERN.
Now don't let us have any argument
about it, please. It makes no differ-
ence how long you have called the place
“Lucerne" or how many of you there
are. It is no good saying that English
people and French people call it
“Lucerne " and as victors the Entente
have the right to impose their wishes;
and it is no good quoting authorities at
me. Luzern calls itself Luzern, and,
to satisfy myself that it is not mistaken
on the point, I have obtained com-
plete corroboration from the Amtliches
Schweizerisches Kursbuch, an authority
whose very name is enough to make
your Bradshaw look silly and shut up.
The avowed object of the PREMIER is
to get away from people and politics
You have me and my friend, Amtliches
Schweizerisches Kursbuch, behind you.
Stick firmly to your point, and by ap-
proaching Luzern from the North you
will approach it by a real express which
only takes two hours to do its sixty
miles and hardly stops at all to take
breath. So that finishes with Berm, as
to the spelling of which, though you
would personally like to see some more
“e's,” you now repose confidence in
me. Would you like me to quote my
authority? . All right; I won't
say it again if it frightens the children.
In the old days of Peace, Luzern was
full of honeymoon couples, and, when
Peace and honeymoons and all that
sort of monsense were put a stop to, it
became full of German interned pris-
oners of war. It boasts many first-
class hotels. One of them is patronised
by the Greek ex-Royal Family. A little
unfortunate; but still you cannot ex-
pect to come and enjoy yourself in
Switzerland without the risk of running

into an ex-Royal Family every corner
you go round, and, what is more, a
Royal Family that wouldn't be ex- if it
wasn't for you. It is a very good hotel,
and I recommend it for anyone who
proposes just to pop over here.
Get hold of L. G. while he is not busy
and explain to him how thoroughly mis-
guided all his policies are, especially as
to the Near East. My idea is to group,
according to subject and side, all those
who intend to get hold of the PREMIER,
while he is alone, and to have a quiet
chat with him. I have my eye on a
large hangar on the other side of the
Lake, which was built to house a diri-
gible and ought to hold the bulk of those
who want a word about Ireland, a place
they could put right in five minutes if it
was left to them. Deputations which
have some idea of declaring strikes,
general strikes and international strikes,
if matters are not arranged to their
liking, will be received between the
hours of ten and twelve, and two and
four, at the Kursaal. Saturday after-
noons and Sundays will be reserved for
quiet walks. I am mapping out some
interesting routes, marking with a red
dot the spots where the PREMIER is
likely to stop and admire the view, and
where you can approach him quietly
from behind and involve him in an argu-
ment about Russia before he has time
to get away.
Image a PREMIER arrived at the end of
all the beautiful sights to be seen locally,
inured to all the magnificent scenery
around him, and no longer attracted
by the novelty of life abroad, longing,
it may be, for just one touch of home.
Then is the moment for the little sur-
prise I am keeping for him up my
sleeve. “Come along to a place close
by,” I shall say to him, for I see my-
self with the whole business well in my
hands now ; “come along to a village
I know, whose very name will make
you feel at home.”
Just outside Luzern we stop at
Meggen, but it's not that. Kussnacht
gets us well abroad again, and there is
nothing particularly homely about Im-
mensee, Arth-Goldau, Steinen, Schwyz
or Brunnen. In fact I can see my
PREMIER getting suspicious and won-
dering what new political move this
may be, when suddenly there will burst
upon his astonished gaze–
FLUELLEN.
Let us leave him there, alone with
his emotions, into which it would be
impertinent to probe. I may tell you
quietly apart that there is a differ-
ence of opinion between me and Amt-
liches Schweizerisches Kursbuch about
this name. He wants to ration the
l's, but, having been there and heard
the name pronounced, I have refused
to be taught how to spell a good Welsh
name by a darned foreigner. If we are
going to have any nonsense about it I
have said that I shall stand out for the
proper, full and uncorrupt spelling :
FLLEw ELLYN.
“‘That,' declared Mr. Lloyd George amid
loud cheers, ‘is one of the most formidable
challenges ever given to democracy. Without
hesitation every Government must accept
that challenge.” ‘’Certainly we will,’ retorted
the Prime Minister.”—Frening Paper.
No wonder Mr. LLoyd GEORGE wants
a holiday if he has begun to talk to
himself.
“A telegram from Paris says: It is an-
nounced here that an agreement has been
concluded between France, Great Britain and
Italy regarding the delimitation of the open
golf championship.”—Provincial Paper.
It will be noticed that America seems
once more to have held aloof from the
councils of the Allies.

“TO HIM THAT HATH . . .”
It was Butterington who first put
me up to the idea. I asked him a
simple question about the habits of the
Sigalion Boa, a certain worm in whose
ways I was taking an interest at the
time, and he at once replied that he
himself was not in the fur line.
“Whenever,” he went on, “I re-
quire information on any subject I
apply to my bank. Why don't you do
the same 2''
This opened up an entirely new pros-
pect. To me my bank was an insti-
tution which kept my accounts, issued
money and, on occasion, lent it. It
never entered my head that it was also
ready to perform the functions of an
inquiry office and information bureau.
Previous communications from me
had always begun, “Sir, with reference
to my overdraft "-you know the sort of
thing one generally writes to banks; ex-
postulating, tactful, temporising letters.
This time however I addressed them
in different vein. Rejecting all mention
of overdrafts as being in doubtful taste,
I wrote:—
SIR,--I shall be greatly obliged if
you will kindly inform me, at your early
convenience:
(1) Whether it is a fact that the
African rhinoceros has no hair on the
hind legs?
(2) Whether, in the case of my back-
ing Pegasus in the first race, ‘any to
come ' on Short Time in the fourth, and
Short Time not starting, I am entitled
to my winnings over Pegasus 2
(3) Whether, after perusing seventeen
favourable reports from mining engi-
neers and eighty-seven enthusiastic
directors' speeches, I am justified in
assuming that gold actually does exist
in the Bonanzadorado mine?
Yours faithfully,
THESIGER Cholmon DELEY BEAUCHAMP.
After some delay they answered as
follows:–
SIR,-We have much pleasure in re-
plying to the queries contained in your
favour of the 27th ult.:—
(1) Yes; (2) Yes; (3) No.
Assuring you always of our best en-
deavours in your service,
We remain, Yours faithfully,
per pro The Cosmopolitan Bkg. Corpn.
C. O. SHINE.
So far so good. The Bank's manner
left nothing to be desired, and its
replies were certainly to the point. I
began to think of Mr. C. O. Shine as
my personal friend and speculated as
to whether his first name were Claude
or Clarence.
During the following week, whenever
I became curious on any subject, I
made notes of fresh queries to pro-
pound. After accumulating a sufficient
number I again wrote to the Bank. I
forget the exact points upon which I
required information; one of them, I
fancy, was the conjectured geologic age
of the Reichardtite strata. Anyhow I
got no answer to any of them.
Instead, three days later, I received
the following letter:—
SIR,-We regret to announce that,
owing to a clerical error in this office;
your account was last month ...}
credited with a chequefor £13,0975s.10d.
which was made payable to another
client of the same name.
Adjustments have now been made
which reveal a balance on your account
of £11011s. 3d. in our favour. We trust
that you will find it convenient to cover
this overdraft at an early date.
With reference to your letter of the
19th inst. containing assorted inquiries,
we beg to intimate that we can in
no circumstances undertake to advise
clients on general matters which lie
outside the scope of our interests.
Yours faithfully,

CHARLEs O. SHINE.
And this time C. O. S. did not even
“remain " in the plural.
I at once showed Butterington this
offensive communication.
“Well,” said he, “of course they
won't answer communications unless
you have a balance.”
That is the way rich men talk.
“I am never without one,” I replied
with dignity, “on one side or the other.”
“There you differ from your name-
sake, whose balance is clearly always
on the right side. Hence that first
kindly letter, addressed to you in error.”

AT THE PLAY.
“HIS LADY FRIENDS.”
THE humours of the average farce
are so elemental that in the matter of
its setting there is small need to worry
about geographical or ethnical con-
siderations. Of course, if its locale is
French you may have to modify its free-
dom of thought and speech, but with
a very little accommodation to national
proprieties you can either transplant the
setting of your play or you can leave
it where it was and make use of the
convention that for stage purposes all
Frenchmen have a perfect command of
our tongue and idiom. But to take a
frankly English novel by an
English writer, adapt it, as
Messrs. NYITRAY and MAN-
DEL have done, for the Am-
erican stage with an American
setting, and then bring it over
here and produce it with only
one or two actors in the whole
cast to illustrate the purity
of the American accent, is
perhaps to presume rather
too much on our generous
lack of intelligence.
However we have got
Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY back
again and that is what really
matters. As a philanderer
protesting innocence in the
face of damnatory facts we
know him well enough; but
here we have him innocent
and ingenuous as an angel,
yet hard put to it to convince
anyone but himself of his
uilelessness. A millionaire
(dollars) with a wife of eco-
nomic disposition, who de-
clines to spend his money
for him, he feels drawn to
a course of knight-errantry
and rides abroad in search of
damsels in pecuniary distress, with the
avowed object of “spreading a little
sunshine.”
This quest, as you will easily under-
stand, was not a very difficult one for
a man prepared to be imposed upon
by just any adventuress, and in the
neighbourhood of his various business-
branches, San Francisco, Washington,
Boston, he soon found a ready channel
for the employment of his superfluous
wealth. The natural affection, how-
ever, which his generosity inspired was
not utilised by him, and you must try
to believe that, in spite of the most
sinister appearances, he remained a
faithful husband.
With the methods by which he ap-
peased his wife's suspicions I will not
trouble you, partly because I could
not follow them myself, owing to the

obscurity of the plot at its most critical
moment. Enough that all ends well
with her firmly-expressed resolution
that in the future she will herself do all
the necessary squandering.
Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY as James
Smith was irresistible in most of the old
ways and a few new ones. The play
would have gone poorly without him,
in spite of the piquancy of Miss JoAN
BARRY as a flapper, the fourth and
final recipient of his chaste bounty.
Miss JEssie BATEMAN as Mrs. James

end with the turning of the worm.

contrast with the Smiths, the wife in
this case spending the money which
the husband hadn't got—Miss ATHENE
SEYLER, who was meant for better
things, gave a certain distinction, but
perhaps “pressed" a little too much.
Mr. JAMES CAREw, who played Edward
Early, was conspicuous as the sole
male representative of the American
language in this American play. The
fleeting visions that we had of Miss MonA
HARRIsoN as a refractory and venal
cook excited general approval. The
three protégées of James Smith were
only faintly distinguishable in their
rather crude banality.
The fun of the farce differed from
that of most farces in depending less
upon situations than upon dialogue.
The First Act, with the situations still
to come, was the best. I have not had

the good fortune to read Miss EDGIN-
ToN's novel, but one might be permitted
to assume, from the excellence of much
of the wit, that, whatever the play may
in other respects have lacked of subtlety
or refinement, such defect was no fault
of hers. What Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY
himself thought of it all Icannot say, but
the play did not begin to compare, either
for irony or singleness of motive, with
the last two in which he figured, The
Naughty Wife and Home and Beauty.
He clearly enjoyed his own part, but it
was rather noticeable that in his brief
speech at the fall of the curtain he con-
fined himself to a personal acknowledg-
ment of the public's sympathy with
him in his illness and their
loyalty throughout his career,
and made no reference to the
play or its authors. O. S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THose who appreciate the short story of quality will be
pleasantly stirred by the announcement of Island Tales
(MILLS AND BooN), a posthumous volume containing what
is probably the last writing of the late JACK LONDON. I
can say at once that these seven stories show his art
in one aspect of its best. Not here the LoNDoN, whom
some of us might prefer, of the strenuous adventure-tale,
with whom there was no respite till, at the end of anything
up to a hundred sinew-cracking pages, we won through to
the appointed end. That South Sea atmosphere, so insidi-
ously appealing to the literary temperament (from STEVEN-
son to STAcpoolE you can see it at work) has steeped these
tales in the lotus-leisure of perpetual afternoon, so that the
action of them tends to become overlaid by slow reflective
talk, old memories and the sense of ancient things. Most
notable is this in the first, where the actual romance, quick,
human and haunting, does not so much as show its face till
after forty pages of old-time local colour. Perhaps of all
the seven I myself would prefer the last—“The Kanaka
Surf,” a slight intrigue, but a perfect epic of such bathing
as, I suppose, can be understood nowhere but on these
enchanted coasts. To read it is to realise what a loss we
suffer in one who could put such jewelled loveliness on to
the printed page—and what another loss in not seeing the
original for ourselves. I suppose no tribute to the power
of genius could be more eloquent.
After the German Revolution of 1918, KARI, KAUTSKY, a
prominent Socialist, was appointed by the new Government
to examine and edit the documents in the Berlin Foreign
Office relating to the outbreak of the War. His work was
completed in time for the Peace Conference and would, he
believes, if published at that time, have convinced the Allies
that the new German Government ought not to be made
responsible for the sins of the old one. But it would also
have shown that the old Government was the main insti-
gator of the War, and that the German people, having
danced to the tune, even if they did not call for it, deserved
to pay the piper. For that reason, perhaps, the German
Government withheld Herr KAUT'sky's revelations. Now
he has published them on his own account, under the title,
The Guilt of William Hohenzollern (SREFFINGTON). A
more damning indictment has never been drawn. From
the moment of the ARCHDUKE's assassination the KAISER
and his advisers determined to make it the pretext for de-
stroying Serbia, and crushing Russia and France if they
dared to interfere. BISMARCK once said that “never are so
many lies told as before a war, during an election and after
a shoot.” His own manipulation of the Ems telegram was
venial compared to the manner in which the German diplo-
matists, egged on by their ruler—whose marginalia on the

despatches furnish the most amusing reading in the volume
—used all the arts of chicanery to deceive Europe as to
their real intentions and to defeat the efforts of England—
on whose neutrality they confidently counted—to secure a
peaceful settlement. Though primarily addressed to the
German proletariat, Herr KAUTSKY’s book has its value for
all of us—“lest we forget.”
On page 103 of The White Hen (MILLs AND Boos) we
read that the Duke laughed softly. “It is just like a
romance,’ he sighed happily;” which was precisely where,
without intending it, the Duke placed his ducal finger upon
the weak spot in the whole business. Because if ever a
story was “like a romance,” and like nothing else on earth,
and filled with characters each and all pledged to preserve
its unreality at all costs, here is that tale. The plot, of
that they are very different people from those who live
about the borders of Manchester or London; a character
like Mrs. Flitch, for instance, who is angelic to behold but
a spiteful gossip at heart, is, alas! to be found anywhere.
And where the dialect does crop out it does not seem
to be dependent on suburban soil for its raciness. I don't
doubt the accuracy of Mr. Riley's Yorkshiremanship, but
I do think he has under-estimated the difficulty of localis-
ing the peculiar genius of villadom.
Though billed by her publisher as a merciless analyst,
Mrs. MoRDAUNT is really (if you want to fling this kind of
title about) an eclectic synthetist or synthetic symbolist.
Her wicked people are prodigiously wicked, wickedness
personified, in fact; her good folk are noble-hearted without
stint or measure. I don't personally think that anybody
which there is a generous allow-
ance, turns chiefly upon the
problem, when is a white hen
less a hen than a jewel casket?
Answer, when she has swal-
lowed,andiserroneously thought
to have retained, a famous dia-
mond, upon which an impover-
ished but noble (see above)
French family had depended for
the dot that should enable their
daughter to wed a plutocratic
but otherwise detestable suitor.
I take it you will hardly need
telling that this is the mo-
ment chosen by Romance, un-
der the expert guidance of Miss
PHYLLIS CAMPBELL, to bring
along an even more wealthy
young American, mistaken (of
course) for his own chauffeur
and working such havoc upon
the heart of the heroine that,
when the latter accidentally
recovered the diamond from its
feathered cache,shevery sensibly
decided to say nothing about it.
Whereupon, because the other
characters,especially an unpleas-
ant Duchess, were unaware that,
as the shop announcements say,
“Poultry was Down Again,” L
much profitable confusion resulted, though nothing to im-
pugn the justice of the ducal verdict quoted above. So
that, if your taste jumps with that of his Grace, you also
can “sigh happily;” otherwise you will perhaps omit the
adverb–and select a story less exclusively romantic.
There is a spirit of Yorkshire and a spirit, I suppose,
characteristic of Suburbia, and on the outskirts of certain
large manufacturing towns there must exist a formidable
blending of these two. To express the double flavour of
this essence requires, I should say, a subtler and more
elaborate method than Mr. W. RILEY has attempted to use
in A Yorkshire Suburb (JENKINs). He has imagined for
the purpose of these sketches an architect, Murgatroyd,
who in planning most of the houses in the locality has
attempted to express in brick and stone the characters of
their several occupants. This is a device which becomes
rather monotonous as the book proceeds, besides imposing
a series of strains which neither architecture nor credulity
can easily bear. Since these are rather superior suburbanites,

dialect is for the most part absent, and it is hard to feel,
could be quite so completely and
gratuitously evil as good-looking
Charles Hoyland in The Little
Soul (HUTCHINsoN); or, being
so, could possibly be recom-
mended, still less engaged, as
tutor to a sensitive youth; or,
being so engaged, tolerated for
two days. He certainly could
not hold down his job long
enough to corrupt his pupil,
Anthony Clayton, by exchanging
souls with him under the nose
of mad but perceptive Mrs.
Clayton and sane sister Diana.
This conspicuously chaste Diana
is an attractive person, and so
is the recklessly charitable Dr.
McCabe, her appropriate mate,
who first had to fly the country
through helping a chorus-girl
out of a difficulty and then (more
or less) won the War by revolu-
tionising bacteriology or some-
thing like that. However, Mrs.
MoRDAUNT interests because she
is so palpably interested herself.
The scenes of Lure of Com-
traband (JARROLDs) are laid in
the Devonshire of some hun-
dred years ago. It is, as its
title suggests, a tale of smuggling, and it contains an
account of a hand-to-hand fight between the hero and the
villain which I advise all members of the National Sporting
Club to read. They may be shocked by the tactics of the
villain, but at the same time they will see what a bout of
fisticuffs meant in those days. Mr. J. WEARE GIFFARD is
a master of atmosphere, and I, at any rate, lived happily in
his Appledore, and imagined myself drinking prime (and
cheap) French brandy in the Beaver Inn; while Lieu-
tenant Perkins, who commanded the “preventive men,” sat
in his tall-backed chair by the fireplace and kept his eyes
and ears open to detect anything that was suspicious. But
he was not foolish enough to ask many questions about
the French brandy. An excellent yarn, simply and straight-
forwardly told. =
“A photograph of the Olympic games at Antwerp was transmitted
resterday to Paris, a distance of 200 miles, over a telephone wire. It
is in the nature of an experiment, and if it succeeds Messrs. Cook hold
out promises of further day trips to the Continent.”—Daily Paper.
Intending trippers must, of course, be proficient in the
tight-rope wire.

MR. SMILLIE’S LITTLE ARMAGEDDON.
SHALL she, the England unafraid,
That came by steady courage through
The toughest war was ever made
And wiped the earth with WILLIAM Two
(Who, though it strikes us now as odd,
Was, in his way, a sort of little god)–
Shall she that stood serene and firm,
Sure of her will to stay and win,
Cry “Comrade 1" on her knees and squirm
To lesser gods of cheaper tin,
Spreading herself, a corpus vile,
Under the prancing heels of Mr. SMILLIE 2
Humour forbids! And even they
Who toil beneath the so-called sun,
Yet often in an eight-hours' day
Indulge a quiet sense of fun—
These too can see, however dim,
The joke of starving just for SMILLIE's whim.
And here I note what looks to be
A rent in Labour's sacred fane;
The priestly oracles disagree,
And, when a house is split in twain,
Ruin occurs—ay! there's the rub
Alike for Labour and Beelzebub.
And anyhow I hope that, where
At red of dawn on Rigi's height
He jodels to the astonished air,
LLOYD GEORGE is bent on sitting tight;
Nor, as he did in THOMAs' case,
Nurses a scheme for saving SMILLIE's face.
Why should his face be saved 2 indeed,
Why should he have a face at all?
But, if he must have one to feed
And smell with, let the man install
A better kind, and thank his luck
That all his headpiece hasn't come unstuck.
O. S.
A WHIFF OF THE BRINY.
As I entered the D.E.F. Company's depôt, Melancholy
marked me for her own. Business reasons—not my own
but the more cogent business reasons of an upperling—had
just postponed my summer holiday; postponed it with a
lofty vagueness to “possibly November. We might be
able to let you go by then, my boy.” November What
would Shrimpton-on-Sea be like even at the beginning of
November? Lovely sea-bathing, delicious boating, enchant-
ing picnics on the sand 2 I didn't think. Melancholy tatooed
me all over with anchors and pierced hearts, to show that I
was her very own, not to be taken away.
I clasped my head in my hands and gazed in dumb agony
at the menu card. A kind waitress listened with one ear.
“Poached egg and bacon—two rashers,” I murmured.
While I waited I crooned softly to myself:-
“Poor disappointed Georgie. Life seems so terribly sad.
All the bacon and eggs in the world, dear, won't make you
a happy lad.”
When the dish was brought I eyed it sadly. Sadly I
raised a mouthful of bacon to my lips . . .
Swish ' ' ' The exclamation-marks signify the suddenness
with which the train swept into the station. I leapt down
on to the platform and drew a long breath. The sea! In
huge whiffs the ozone rolled into my nostrils. I gurgled
with delight. Everything smelt of the dear old briny: the
little boys running about with spades and pails; the great
basketsful of fish; the blue jerseys of the red-faced men
who, at rare intervals, toiled upon the deep. At the far end
of the platform I saw the reddest face of all, that of my
dear old landlord. I rushed to meet him . . .
Ah me, ah me! The incrusted-papered walls of the
depôt girt me in again. I took another mouthful of bacon
—a larger one .
Bang! Someone was thumping on the door of my
bathing-machine. What a glorious scent of salt rose from
the sea-washed floor! “Are you coming out?” asked a
persuasive voice. “No, no, no!” I shouted joyously. “I
am going in.” What a dive! I never knew before how
superlatively graceful my dives could be. Away through
the breakers with a racing stroke. Over on my back,
kicking fountains at the sun. In this warm water I should
stay in for hours and hours and . . .
Pah That horrible incrusted paper back again ' I
bolted the remaining rasher . . .
The boat rocked gently in a glassy sea. They were
almost climbing over the gunwale in their eagerness to be
caught. Lovely wet shining wriggly fellows; all the varieties
of the fishmonger's slab and more. In season or out, they
didn't care; they thought only of doing honour to my line.
No need in future for me to envy the little boys on the river-
bank who pulled in fish after fish when I never got a bite.
How delightfully salt the fish smelt! And the sun drew
out the scent of salt from the gently lapping waves. It was
all so quiet and restful. Almost could I have slumbered,
even as I pulled them in and in and . . .
The waitress must have giggled. Once again the in-
crusted paper leered at me in all its horrible pink incrusti-
ness. There was no bacon left on my plate. But the
delicious scent of salt still lingered. Alas, my holiday was
over ! I must speed me or I should miss the train to town.
“Good-bye!” I shouted to the manageress and shook her
by the hand. She seemed surprised. “Such a happy time,”
I assured her. “I wish I could have it all over again.”
She said something which I could not hear. Sea-bathing
tends to make me a little deaf.
“If I have forgotten anything—my pyjamas or my shav-
ing strop—would you be so kind as to send them on ?
Good-bye again.”
Something fluttered to the floor. The manageress stooped.
I was just passing through the portals.
“You have forgotten this,” she called.

ING THE HARVEST.”
“Do coxie IN, ADolph Us; YoU ’RE DELAY-
THE ART OF POETRY.
IV.
Good morning, gentlemen. Before
I pass to the subject of my lecture to-
day I must deal briefly with a personal
matter of some delicacy. Since I began
this series of lectures on the Art of
Poetry I notice that the new Professor
of Poetry at Oxford, Mr. W. P. KER, in
what I think is questionable taste, has
delivered an inaugural lecture on the
same subject under the same title. On
the question of good taste I do not wish
to say much, except that I should have
thought that any colleague of mine,
even an entirely new Professor in a
provincial university, would have re-
cognised the propriety of at least com-
municating to me his intention before
committing this monstrous plagiarism.
However, as I say, on that aspect of
the matter I do not propose to dwell,
though it does seem to me that decency
imposes certain limits to that kind of
academic piracy, and that those limits
the Professor has overstepped. In these
fermenting days of licence and indisci-
pline persons in responsible positions at
our seats of learning have a great burden
of example to bear before the world,
and if it were to go forth that actions
of this type may be taken with im-
punity by highly-paid Professors then
indeed we are not far from Bimetallism
and the breaking-up of laws.
Now let us glance for a moment at
the substance of the lecture. I should
have been glad if Professor KER had
had the courtesy to show it to me before
it was delivered, instead of my having
to wait till it was printed and buy it in
a shop, because I might have induced
him to repair the more serious errors and
omissions in his work. For really, when
you come to analyse the lecture, what
thin and bodyless stuff it is. Let me
at once pay tribute to my colleague's
scholarship and learning, to the variety
of his citations. But, after all, anyone
can buy a Quotation Dictionary and
quote bits out of Swinburn E. That
surely—(see FRIEDRICH's Crime and
Quotation, pp. 246-9)—is not the whole
task of a Professor of Poetry.
Such a man, if he is to earn his pay,
must be able—
(a) to show how poetry is written:
(b) to write poetry;
and it is no good his attempting (a) in
the absence of (b). It is no good teach-
ing a man to slope arms if you are un-
able to slope arms yourself, because a
moment will come when he says, “Well,
how the dickens do you slope them : ”
It is no good professing lawn-tennis
and saying, “Top-spin is imparted by
drawing the racquet up and over,” and
so on, if, when you try to impart top-
spin yourself, the ball disappears on to
the District Railway. Still less is it
useful if you deliver a long address to
the student, saying, “H. L. Doherty
was a good player, and so was RENSHAw,
and I well remember the game between
McLough LIN and WILDING, because
..WILDING hit the ball over the net more
often than McLough LIN did.”
Those students who have attended
my lectures more regularly than others
—and I am sorry there are not more of
them—will do me the justice to remem-
ber that I have put forward no theory
of writing which I was not prepared to
illustrate in practice from my own work.
My colleague, so far as I can discover,
makes one single attempt at practical
assistance; and even that is a minor
plagiarism from one of my own lectures.
He makes a good deal of play with what

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
he calls the principle and influence of
the Italian Canzone, which simply means
having a lot of ten-syllable lines and
a few six-syllable ones. Students will
remember that in our second lecture we
wrote a poem on that principle, which
finished :—
Teroodle—umti-oodle—umti-knife (or strife)
Where have they put my hat?
That lecture was prepared on May 27th;
my colleague's lecture was delivered on
June 5th. It is clear to me that in the
interval—by what discreditable means
I know not — he obtained access to
my manuscript and borrowed the idea,
thinking to cloak his guilt by specious
talk about the Italian Canzone. The
device of offering stolen goods under a
new name is an old one, and will help
him little; the jury will know what to
think.
Apart from this single piece of (second-
hand) instruction, what contribution
does he make to the student's know-
ledge of the Art of Poetry? He
makes no reference to comic poetry at
all; apparently he has never heard of
the Limerick, and I have the gravest
doubts whether he can write one,
though that, I admit, is a severe test.
I am prepared however to give him a
public opportunity of establishing his
fitness for his post, and with that end
I propose to put to him the following
problems, and if his answers are satis-
factory I shall most willingly modify
my criticisms; but he must write on
one side of the paper only and number
his pages in the top right-hand corner.
The Problems.
(1) What is the metre of:—
“And the other grasshopper jumped right
over the other grasshopper's back.”
(2) Finish the uncompleted Limerick
given in my Second Lecture, beginning:
There was a young man who said “Hell !
I don't think I feel very well."
(3) In your inaugural lecture you
ask, “Is it true, or not, that the great
triumphs of poetical art often come
suddenly 2” The answer you give is
most unsatisfactory; give a better one
now, illustrating the answer from your
own works.
(4) Write a Ballade of which the
refrain is either—
(a) The situation is extremely grave;
Or
(b) The Empire is not what it was;
- Ol'
(c) We lived to see Lord BIRRENHEAD.
NotE.—Extra marks will be given
for an attempt at (b) because of the
shortage of rhymes to was.
(5) What would you do in the follow-
ing circumstances? In May you have

sent a poem to an Editor, ending with
the lines—
The soldiers cheered and cheered again—
It was the PRINCE of WALEs.
On July 20th the Editor writes and
says that he likes the poem very much,
and wishes to print it in his August
number, but would be glad if you could
make the poem refer to Mr. or Mrs.
Doug LAs FAIRBANKs instead of the
PRINCE. He must have the proof by the
first post to-morrow as he is going to
press. Show how you would recon-
struct your last verse.
(6) Consider the following passages—
(i) I love little pussy,
Her coat is so warm,
And if I don't hurt her
She'll do me no harm.
(ii) Who put her in 2
Little Tommy Green.
(a) Carefully amend the above so
that they rhyme properly.
(b) Do you as a matter of principle
approve of these kinds of rhyme 2
(c) If not, do you approve of them in

THE PRIVILEGES OF MARGOTISM.
[Something was said in Punch last week about the advantage to the
reminiscencer of being his (or her) own JoHNsoN and Boswell too.
Mrs. Asquith's recent adventures with the descendants of some of her
late friends, of whose fair fame they are not less jealous than she,
suggest certain of the pitfalls incident to this double rôle, particularly
when the autobiographer is remote from his (or her) journals. Since
however an inaccuracy always has a day's start and is never com-
pletely overtaken, while in course of time the pursuit ceases altogether,
the greatest danger is not immediate but for the future. Let us
imagine a case.] -
FROM “THE MARGoTIST's REM.INIsceNCEs.”
By the Author of Statesmen I Hate Influenced; My Won-
derful Life; The Souls' Awakener; The Elusive Diary,
etc., etc.
One of my dearest friends in the early nineteen hundreds
was Mr. Sadrock. I have known eleven Prime Ministers
in my time and have assurances from all, signed and wit-
nessed, that but for me and my vivacious encouragement ||
they would never have pulled through; but with none was
I on terms of such close communion as with Mr. Sadrock,
who not only asked my advice on every occasion of im-
portance, but spent many of his waking hours in finding
rhymes to my name. Some of his four-lined couplets in
my honour could not be either wittier or more charming as
compliments.
He often averred that no one could amuse him as I did.
He laughed once for half-an-hour on end when I said, “It
takes a Liberal to be a Tory; ” and on another occasion
when I said, “The essence of Home Rule is, like charity,
that it begins abroad.” Nothing but the circumstance
that he was already happily married prevented him from
proposing to me.
Mr. Sadrock is now to many people only a name; but
in his day he was a force to compare with which we have
at this moment only one statesman and he is temporarily
out of office.
The odd thing is that if the ordinary person were to be
asked what Mr. Sadrock was famous for, he would probably
reply, For his devotion to Hoxii:R and the Established
Church. But the joke is that when I was with him in
1902 he was frivolous on both these subjects. It was, I
remember, in the private room at the House of Commons
set apart for Prime Ministers, to which, being notoriously
so socially couth, I always had a private key—the only one
ever given to a woman—and he was more than usually
delightful. -
This is what was said:— -
Mr. SAD Rock (miring himself an eſſ noſ/). Will you join
me 2
Myself. No, thank you. But I like to see you applying
yourself to Subsidiary Studies to the Art of Butler.
Mr. S.ADRocK (roaring with laughter). That's very good.
Some day you must put your best things into a book.
MysłLF. You bet.
Mr. SAD isock. I wonder why it is that you make me so
frank. It is your wonderful sympathetic understanding, I
suppose. I long to tell you something now.
Mrs.ELF (affecting not to care). Do. I am secrecy itself.
Mr. SAD RocK. Would it surprise you to know that I am
privily a Dissenter? Do you know that I often steal away
in a false beard to attend the services of Hard-Shell Baptists
and Plymouth Brethren? -
MYSELF. I hope I am no longer capable of feeling any-
thing so démodé as surprise.
Mr. SADRock. And that I prefer Itobert Elsmere to the
Iliad 2
MYSELF. May I print those declarations in my book?
Mr. S.411:00 K. Some day, yes, but not yet, not yet.
MR. SADROCK AND NoNconForMITY.
To the Editor of “The Monday Times.”
SIR,--I find it necessary, in the interests of truth and of
respect for the memory of my uncle, Mr. Sadrock, to con-
test the accuracy of the Margotist's report of conversations
with him in 1902. To begin with, my uncle died in 1898,
four years before the alleged interview. She could there-
fore not have talked with him in 1902; and the locale of
this meeting, the Prime Minister's room, becomes peculiarly
fantastic. Secondly, no member of his family—and they
saw him constantly—ever heard him utter anything re-
sembling the sentiments which the Margotist attributes
to him. Mr. Sadrock was both an undeviating Churchman
and a devotee of HoMER to the end of his life.
I am, etc., THEoPHILU's SADRock.
THE MARGotist's REPLY.
SIR,--I have read Mr. Theophilus Sadrock's letter and
am surprised by its tone. If Mr. Sadrock did not make
use of the words that I attribute to him how could I have
set them down 2. Because I was writing unobserved all the
time he was talking, and I could produce the notes if they
were, to others, legible enough for it to be worth while; sur-
reptitious writing must necessarily be indistinct at times.
As for the question of time and place, that is a mere quibble.
Mr. Sadrock was alive when we had our talk, and I am
sorry if I have misdated it. The talk remains. May I add
that it is very astonishing to me to find people with the
effrontery to suggest that they knew their illustrious rela-
tives better than strangers could. Everyone is aware that
the last place to go to for evidence as to a man is to his
kith and kin. When my book appears there will be a few
corrections; but in the main I stand by the motto which
I invented for CHAMBERLAIN one evening: “What I have
written I have written.” I am, Yours, etc.,
The Woop. THE MARGotist.
FROM “SADRock: A DEFINITIVE BIOGRAPHY.”
I’ublished in 1940.
Before leaving our consideration of Sadrock's Homeric
studies it is however necessary to point out that late in life
he made a very curious recantation. In a book of memoirs,
published in 1920, by one who was in a position to acquire
special information, it is stated in his own words that
Sadrock preferred Robert Elsmere to the Iliad; while
during the same conversation he confessed to a passion for
the services of Dissenters, which, he said, he often
frequented incognito. No biographer can disregard such
admissions, and we must revise our opinion of the great
statesman accordingly. E. W. L.

THE REVOLT OF YOUTH.
WE publish a few selected letters
from the mass of correspondence which
has reached us in connection with the
controversy initiated by “A Bewildered
Parent" in The Morning Post : —
A LEGUMINoUs LAUDATION.
SIR,--I confess I cannot share the
anxiety of the “Bewildered Parent"
who complains of the child of two and
a-half years who addressed her learned
parent as “Old bean.” As a convinced
Montessorian I recognise in the appel-
lation a gratifying evidence of that self-
not appeal for your sympathy, I merely
wish to describe my position, the diffi-
culties of which might no doubt be
paralleled in hundreds of other house-
holds. I have three children whose
characteristics may be thus briefly
summarised:— -
(1) Pamela, aged nineteen, is an
ultra-modern young woman. She hates
politics of all shades, but adores Scria-
BINE, STRAVINSKY and BENEDETTo
CRoCE. She smokes cigars, wears male
attire and has a perfect command of
the art of ornamental objurgation.
(2) Gerald, aged twenty-three, is war-
weary; resentful of all authority;
only endure my companionship on the
conditions that I smoke (which makes
me ill); that I emulate the excesses of
her lurid lingo (which makes mesquirm),
and that I paint my face (which makes
me look like a modern Messalina, which
I am not). Gerald is prepared to accept
me as a “pal,” provided that I play
David to his Saul by regaling him on
Sunday mornings with negroid melodies,
which he punctuates with snorts on
the trombone. If he knew that I went
to early morning service all would be
at an end between us. Finally, An-
thony wants me to remain as I was
and really am. So you see that I have
expression which cannot begin
too young. Moreover there
is nothing derogatory in the
phrase; on the contrary I am
assured on the best authority
that it is a term of endearment
rather than reproach. But, above
all, as a Vegetarian I welcome
the choice of the term as an in-
dication of the growth of the
revolt against carnivorous bru-
tality. If the child in question
had called her parent a “saucy
kipper” or “a silly old sausage”
there would have been reason-
able ground for resentment. But
comparison with a bean in-
volves no obloquy, but rather
panegyric. The bean is one of
the noblest of vegetables and is
exceptionally rich in calories,
protein, casein, carbo-hydrates,
thymol, hexamyl, piperazine,
salicylic dioxide, and perman-
ganate of popocatapetl. This a
learned parent, if his learning
was real, ought to have recog-
nised at once, instead of fool-
ishly exploiting a fancied griev-
ance. Yours farinaceously,

to lead not a dual but a triple
life, and am only spared the
necessity of making it quadruple
by the fact that my husband is
fortunately dead. As Pamela
gracefully remarked the other
day, “It was a good thing for
poor father that he went West
to sing bass in the heavenly
choir before we grew up.” In
conclusion I ought to admit
that my future is not without
prospects of alleviation. Pamela
has just announced her engage-
ment to an archdeacon of pro-
nounced Evangelical views;
Gerald is meditating a pro-
longed tour in New Guinea with
a Bolshevist mission; Anthony
contemplates neither matrimony
nor expatriation.
I am, Sir, Yours respectfully,
A MIDDLE-AGED MoTHER.
THE CRY OF THE CHILD
AUTHOR.
SIR,-As a novelist and dra-
matist whose work has met with
high encomiums from Mr. J. L.
GARVIN, Mr. C. K. SHORTER,
Mr. JAMEs Doug LAs and Lord
HowARD DE WALDEN, I wish to
impress upon you and your
SIR,--Some sixty years ago I was
rebuked by my father for addressing
him as “Governor.” Thirty years later
I was seriously offended with my own
son for calling me an “old mug.” He
in turn, though not by any means a
learned man, has within the last few
weeks been irritated by his school-boy
son derisively addressing him as an
“old dud.” The duel between fathers
and sons is as old as the everlasting
hills, and the rebels of one generation
become the fogeys of the next. I have
no doubt that in moments of expansion
the young MARCELLUs alluded to his
august parent as “faba antiqua.”
Yours faithfully, SENEx.
A TRIPLE LIFE.
SIR,-As a middle-aged mother I do
“bored stiff" by any music save of the
syncopated brand, and he divides his
time between Jazz-dancing with the
dismal fervour of a gloomy dean and
attending meetings of pro-Bolshevist
extremists.
(3) Anthony, aged twenty-six, is a
soldier, a “regular"; restrained in
speech, somewhat old-fashioned in his
tastes. This summer he spent his
leave fishing in Scotland and took with
him two books—the Life of Stonewall
Jackson and the Bible. It is hardly
necessary to add that Gerald is not on
speaking terms with him.
As for myself, while anxious to keep
in touch with my wayward brood, I
find the strain of º my-
self to their varied requirements almost
more than I can stand. Pamela can
readers the hardships and restrictions
which the tyranny of parental control
still imposes on juvenilegenius. Though
I recently celebrated my seventh birth-
day, my father and mother have firmly
refused to provide me with either a
latch-key or a motor-bicycle. Owing
to the lack of proper accommodation
in my nursery my literary labours are
carried on under the greatest difficulties
and hampered by constant interruptions
from my nurse, a vulgar woman with
a limited vocabulary and no aspirates.
I say nothing, though I might say
much, of the jealousy of adult authors,
the pusillanimity of unenterprising pub-
lishers, the senile indifference of Parlia-
ment. But I warn them that, unless the
just claims of youth to economic and
intellectual independence are speedily

SAND SPORTS.
Two or three hundred yards behind
the sandhills, which seem to be de-
serted but are really full of sudden hol-
lows, with émbarrassing little bathing
tents in them, the village sports have
just been held. They took place in a
sloping grass field kindly lent for the
occasion by Mr. Bates. This means
that you paid a shilling to enter the
field, whereas on other days you can
picnic in it or play cricket in it without
paying anything at all. Mr. Bates is
a kind of absentee landlord so far as
we are concerned, for he is the butcher
at Framford, four miles away, and only
brings the proceeds of his butchery to
us on Tuesdays and Fridays, which is
the reason why on Mondays and Thurs-
days one usually has eggs and bacon
for dinner.
It was an interesting afternoon
for many reasons, most of all per-
haps because many of the visitors
saw each other for the first time in
clothes—in land clothes, I mean—and
it is wonderful how much smarter some
of them looked than when popping red
or brown faces, with lank wisps of hair
on them, out of the brine. -
Some of the athletic events were
open, like the Atlantic Sea, and some
close, like the Conferences at Lympne,
but very few of the visitors competed
in any of them. I don't think any of
us fancied our chances overmuch, but
personally I was a little bitter about the
three-mile bicycle race, because there
were three prizes and only three com-
petitors. I am past my prime at this
particular sport, but as it happened one
of the three broke his gear-chain some-
where about the seventh lap, and it was
a long time before he mended it and
rode triumphantly past the finishing
flag. I felt then that I had missed
what was probably my first and last
chance of securing an Olympic palm.
The whole affair struck me as being
very well managed; dull events, like
the high jump and putting the shot,
being held quietly in a corner by the
hedge, whilst the really interesting
things, like the sack race and the egg
and spoon race, went on in the middle.
We used potatoes instead of eggs, but
whether there was a system of handi-
capping according to the weight and age
of the potatoes I was unable to deter-
mine. I do feel confident, however,
that that girl with the yellow hair and
the striped skirt to whom the first
prize was quite incorrectly awarded by
the judges had put some treacle——
But there, I will be magnanimous.
The postman was a great success.
He had acquired a light suit of over-
alls, on which he had painted three large
red stars, using, I hope, Government
red ink, and with black cheeks and a
floured nose footed it solemnly to the
music of the Framford Comrades'
Band. He also ran underneath the
lath at the high jump and tumbled
down in trying to put the shot. All
round the field children could be heard
asking, “What is he doing, Mummy?"
and, when they were told, “Hush,
dears, he's doing it for a joke,” their
eyes danced and they tried for a moment
to control their emotion and then broke
into shrieks of laughter. All the diffi-
cult open events which were not won
by a young man in puce-coloured shorts
were won by a friend of his in a yellow
shirt. I have an idea that these two

young men came from Framford and
go round doing this kind of thing and
getting prizes for it, just as Mr. Bates
goes round selling his beef.
Amidst all this fun and frolic, if you
went up to the top of one of the sand-
hills and looked across the blue bay to
the little seaport opposite, you saw that
it was also emptied of its folk this pious
afternoon and was in fact holding aquatic
revels. Little fishing-boats with brown
sails were turning about a given mark.
There were rowing races and diving
competitions and a greasy pole and
very probably a comic man dressed up
as a buoy.
I have pondered deeply over these
twin feasts, and it has occurred to me
that, whilst land sports and water
sports are both of them very good
things in their way, neither expresses
the real genius of a maritime resort,
and also that we visitors, if we are too
shy to enter with gusto into the local
games, ought to provide some suitable
entertainment in return. I have com-
piled therefore a programme of a Grand
Beach Gala for next week, and have
had a notice put up in the post-office
window inviting entries. Not many
people buy stamps at the post-office,
but, as you get bacon and spades and
buckets and jam there, it is a pretty
popular emporium, and I think my list
of events should prove an attractive
one. It runs as follows:—
1. Pebble and Tent Competition.—
Fathers of families only. To be run
if possible at low tide on a wet and
windy day. Competitors to leave start-
ing post in ordinary attire, enter tent,
emerge in bathing costume, strike tents,
sprint over shingle to the sea, swim to
a given point, return, pitch tents, dress
and run to winning-post.
FIRST PRIZE, a ham sandwich, with
real sand.
2. Sock Race.—Under ten. Com-
petitors to start barefooted in rock-
pools and race at the sound of a dinner-
bell to nurses, have feet dried, put on
shoes and stockings and run to row of
buns at top of beach. First bun down
wins. Points deducted for sand in
socks.
3. Hundred Yards Paddle Dash.-
To be run along the edge of surf. Han-
dicap by position. Tallest competitor
to have deepest station. Open to all
ages and sexes. Feet to be lifted clear
of the water at every stride. Properly
raced this is a fine frothy event, pro-
ductive of the greatest enthusiasm, espe-
cially if the trousers come unrolled.
4. Sand Castle Contest.—Open to all
families of eight. Twenty minutes time
limit. Largest castle wins. Moats must
contain real sea-water.
5. Impromptu Picnic.—Ladies only.
Materials must be collected from the
village shops, brought down to beach
and spread out at winning flag. For
the purpose of this competition the
sports must take place on a Thursday,
when the weekly visit of the green-
grocer coincides with one of the bi-
weekly visits of the baker from Fram-
ford. Eggs and butter must be obtained
at the Mill Farm, and you can do the
rest at the post-office.
6. Fifty Yards Hat Race.—Under
five. Fathers to be seated in a row on
beach. Competitors to remove fathers'
hats, run twenty-five yards, fill hats
with sand, return and replace hats.
In order to prevent any ill-feeling
that might arise from the thought that
I had practised any of these races in
private beforehand I have elected to
be the judge. Evor.

THE ROOM AT THE BACK.
[A story of the supernatural, which should not be read late at night
by persons of weak nerves.]
OUTwARDLY, “Chatholme" was as all the other villas in
Dunmoral Avenue, which were just detached enough to
allow the butcher's boy to squeeze himself and his basket
—and perhaps the cook—between any two of them, and
differed from each other in nothing but names, numbers
and window-curtains.
And the interior of the house, when the Pottigrews took
possession of it, seemed equally commonplace. There is
no need to show you all over it, but if you intend to peruse
this narrative, in spite of the warning above, it is desirable.
that you should at least inspect the ground-floor.
On one side of the hall, which was faintly illumined in
the daytime by a fanlight, was the drawing-room; on the
other side was the dining-room, and behind the dining-room
was a smaller room with a French-window looking on to
the back-garden, which probably was described by the
Mr. Pottigrew, he described the remarkable and alarming
seizure he had just experienced.
He had turned his arm-chair to the French-window, he
said, with the intention of enjoying a quiet smoke, and
no sooner had he seated himself and leaned back than an
indescribable feeling of suffocation had crept upon him,
and at the same time he had been aware of a curious loss
of control over his jaws, so that he had been unable to
prevent his mouth opening to its widest extent. When he
had tried to rise to his feet an invisible force had seemed
to be holding him down, and it was only by a tremendous
effort of will that he had managed to keep his senses and
struggle to the door.
He resolutely refused to see a doctor, but, deciding that
the attack was a warning that he had been overdoing
it, he retired forthwith to bed. By the morning he felt so
well that he prescribed for himself a few quiet days by the
sea. And so he packed his bag and took himself off by an
early train to Brighton.
That afternoon was marked by another disagreeable occur-
house - agents as the
“morning-room,” but
was by Mr. Pottigrew
designated his “study.”
Prosaic enough, you
will say. And yet there
was that about the
ground-floor of “Chat-
holme” which was any-
thing but matter - of-
fact, as the Pottigrews
began to discover be-
fore they had been in
residence many days.
Mrs. Pottigrew was
the first to “sense”
something out of the
ordinary. She was of
Manx origin, and there-
fore peculiarly sensi-
tive to “influences; ”
one of those uncom-
fortable people who
cannot visit such places
“OH, MIUMMY, will. YoU GET THE TwoPENCE BACK ?”
rence. After the way
of her kind, Mrs. Pot-
tigrew's Aunt Charlotte
was attracted by the
idea of using a room
from which normally
the female members of
the household were ex-
cluded. So she took
her needlework into the
study and prepared to
spend a quiet hour or
so in the armchair
facing the French-win-
dow.
Hardly had she settled
‘. . . down when she too ex-
| perienced the same feel-
ing of suffocation and
the same involuntary
opening of the jaws
which Mr. Pottigrew
had described. She
struggled against it,
as Hampton Court or the Tower without vibrating like
harp-strings.
Mr. Pottigrew, however, was of the duller fibre of which
cyclists rather than psychists are made; and when, on
his return from the City one afternoon, his wife tried to get
him to appreciate a certain eeriness in the atmosphere of
the new home, he sniffed it dutifully, and declared that
he could detect nothing but a confounded smell of onions.
“That's because they won't remember to shut the kitchen
door,” Mrs. Pottigrew explained, “But—”
“Well, it can't be the drains, because they've just been
tested,” said Mr. Pottigrew impatiently. And, like a stout
materialist, he muttered, “Imagination " " as he strolled
away to the sanctuary of his study, little guessing how his
own imagination was about to be stimulated.
(Look here—this is where the creepy business begins.
If, on consideration, you feel you'd rather read about cricket
or politics or something, I'll excuse you.)
A little later, as Mrs. Pottigrew was crossing the hall,
she was stopped short by a strange, gasping choky sound
which came from the study. There followed the crash of a
chair being overturned; the door opened and her husband
staggered out with scared eyes in a face as white as marble,
and beads of sweat on his brow.
} When a stiff brandy had restored the power of speech to
but, lacking the will-power of her robust nephew-by-marri-
age, she was overcome by unconsciousness. When she
came to, a little dazed and faint, a few moments later, she
was disinayed to discover that her expensive dental-plate
—a full set—was lying on the floor, shattered beyond repair.
Not being a person of vivid imagination, she attributed
her transient illness to intense sympathy with Mr. Potti-
grew, and resigned herself to a diet of slops until she could
be furnished with new means of mastication.
Next day, a Saturday, came the climax. Early in the
evening an urgent telegram summoned Mr. Pottigrew back
from Brighton. Hastening home, he was received by a
wife distraught.
“What did I tell you?” she wailed. “Send for Sir
CoNAN Doyle. Poor dear Aubrey ! The doctor is upstairs
with him.”
Mr. Pottigrew hurriedly ascended to the bedroom of his
son and heir, a fine healthy youth, just of an age to ap-
preciate his father's cigars. (This, of course, is a pre-
Budget story.)
The young fellow lying upon the bed smiled bravely as
his father entered, but Mr. Pottigrew was shocked to see
that he smiled with toothless gums. A grave professional-
looking man rose from the bedside and beckoned Mr.
Pottigrew out of the room.

[SEPTEMBER 1, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO BUILD A HOUSE.
THE only way to build a house pro-
perly is to employ an architect to build
it for you. All the best houses are
built by architects—any architect will
tell you that. But of course you will
always be allowed to say that you built
it, so it will come to the same thing.
The walls of an architect's office are
covered with drawings of enormous
public buildings which the architect
has erected in every capital of Europe.
There are also a few of the statelier
hoſhes of England which he has put up
in his spare time.
While you are waiting you compare
these with your own scheme of the six-
roomed villa you propose to build.
At last you are ushered into the pre-
sence and unless a stove-pipe protrud-
ing from your waistcoat pocket suggests
that you are travelling in somebody's
radiators you will probably be asked
to sit down, and may even be given a
cigarette. There is no difficulty in
opening your business. The architect
can see at a glance what you have come
for and says quite simply, “You want
to build a house 2"
“I do,” you reply.
“How many reception rooms?"
This rather staggers you. You had
not intended to have any reception
rooms at all. You never give receptions.
All you wanted was a dining-room and
a drawing-room, and a study with a
round window over the fire-place. '
But it is evidently impossible to con-
fide this to the architect. All you can
do is to reply as naturally as you can :—
“About half-a-dozen.”
“Eight reception rooms,” says the
architect. “And how many bedrooms?”
“I don't really know; about one
each.” -
“Twenty bedrooms,” suggests the
architect (there are three in your
family). “And did you say a garage to
hold two cars 2"
By this time you realise that you are
engaged in a game something like
auction bridge and so far your opponent
has done all the over-calling.
“Double two cars " you cry ex-
citedly,
“Five cars,” rejoins the Architect.
“Six cars' "
“Garage to hold six cars,” repeats
the Architect, confessing defeat. “You
are, of course, aware that a house on
this scale will cost you at least twenty
thousand pounds 2 " . -
“Of course,” you reply, and you
honestly think it would be cheap at the
price.
After this the only thing to do is to
get away as quickly as possible. It
would be pure bathos to suggest any
of your wife's labour-saving devices, or
introduce the subject of that circular
bath-room with a circular bath hanging
by chains from the ceiling and a spirit-
stove under it—your pet invention.
Recall a pressing engagement, shake
the architect firmly by the hand and
promise to come and see him next
Tuesday about details. In the interval
you can compose a letter at your leisure,
informing him that in view of the high
cost of materials, etc., etc., you have
decided to postpone the building of
your house, but you desire to build at
once a gardener's cottage (so that the
gardener can be getting the grounds
into order) containing one dining-room,
one drawing-room, one study (with one
round window), three bedrooms, one
circular bathroom (with one circular
bath) and one tool-shed to hold one tool.
Even so you will probably have to
make concessions. Your window will
be hexagonal and your bath square.
But your worries are over. The archi-
tect will choose a builder and between
them they will build your house during
the next six years, which you will spend
in lodgings. It is a long time to wait,
certainly, but you will find plenty of
amusement in occasionally counting
the number of bricks that have been
laid since last time. And then in 1926,
as you smoke your pipe in your study
and gaze out of your hexagonal window,
you will not covet the Paradise of ADAM,
the first gardener.
RHYMES, OF THE UNDERGROUND.
Adolphus Minns resides at Kew
And does what people ought to do.
In boarding trains his instincts are
To “let 'em first get off the car,”
Then “hurry up" himself to enter,
And “pass along right down the centre.”
Though nigh his destination be
No selfish “door-obstructor’’ he ,
Rather than bear such imputation
He'll travel on beyond his station.
His unexceptionable ways
|E'en liftmen have been known to praise—
A folk censorious and, as such,
Not given to praising over-much.
Small need have they to shout a grim
“No smoking in the lift " at him,
Or ask if he's the only one
For whom the lift is being run.
Adolphus Minns, who lives at Kew,
Does all that people ought to do—
Retires to bed before eleven,
Is up and shaved by half-past seven—
And, when he dies, he'll go to Heaven.
Perhaps he's gone; I've never met
His like at Kew or elsewhere yet.
THE DISSIMULATION OF SUZANNE.
THE telephone bell rang just as I was
beginning breakfast.
“What is your number, please ?”
asked an imperious voice.
In an emergency I never can re-
member my own number.
“Just hold on a minute while I look
it up,” I begged. Feverishly I turned
over the leaves of the telephone direc-
tory and, cutting with a blunt finger the
page containing the small advertisement
that keeps my name before the public
eye, at last found and transmitted the
desired information.
“Don’t go away,” said the voice
again, this time with a shade of weari-
ness in its tone. “Chesterminster
wants you.”
I wasn't going away, because before
Suzanne left me to visit her relatives in
Middleshire I had vowed that nothing
would induce me to do so. But Chester-
minster wanted me. What should that
portend ?
“Tell them,” I declaimed into the
mouthpiece while I instinctively posed
for the camera, “that I feel greatly
honoured by their invitation and in
other circumstances I should have
been delighted to come forward as their
Candidate. The Parliamentary history
of Chesterminster constitutes one of
the most romantic chapters in the
chronicles of England; but just now I
am busy writing verses for next week's
| Back Chat, so—" *
“If you will keep on talking to your-
self you won't get connected,” inter-
rupted the voice. “You're thr-r-rough,
Chesterminster.” -
“Are you Chelsea niner-seven-double-
seven 2'' inquired a new voice, a little
more distant but not so haughty.
“No, nine—I mean niner-double-
seven-seven,” I replied.
“Same thing,” said the voice of
Chesterminster. “Stokehampton wants
Oll.
“Tell them "I began, but my
oratory was drowned by a rapid succes-
sion of small explosions, and out of
this unholy crepitation emerged a still
small voice which said, “Is that you,
darling?” Then I suddenly remem-
bered that Stokehampton is Suzanne's
relatives' nearest town of call. -
“They want you to come to-morrow
for the week-end,” said Suzanne. “I
lied to them and said you were busy
working, but they said you can have
the library to yourself whenever you
want it, and spoke so nicely about you
that I couldn't refuse to ring you up.
Besides, I want you to come, and the
figs and the mulberries are in splendid
form.”

Heaven is a garden full of fig-trees and
mulberry - bushes at the appropriate
season of the year. But it was raining
hard, and I abominate week-ends; and
Suzanne's relatives are well-meaning
folk who always want to arrange your
day for you.
“No, Suzanne,” I said, “emphati-
cally, no. I can't think of a convincing
excuse at the moment, so you'd better
say I'll be delighted to come. But to-
morrow morning you'll get a wire from
me announcing that I'm sick of the
palsy—no, malaria, which they know
I sometimes get—and that'll give you
a good ground for returning yourself
“Then they didn't spot anything?”
“No,” said Suzanne—“no, I don't
think so.”
After dinner that night I was playing
billiards with Toby, who is Suzanne's
aunt's nephew-by-marriage. We had
the room to ourselves.
“Dull part of the world this,” he re-
marked. “By the way, what about
that malaria of yours?” -
“What about it?” I observed shortly.
“Comes and goes rather suddenly,
doesn't it 2"
“Very,” I agreed. “It's one of the
suddenest diseases ever invented.”
“‘Invented ' is a good word,” said
boy arrived. Before anybody could dis-
cover whom the wire was addressed to,
Suzanne snatched it from the boy, tore
it open, placed her hand in the region
of her heart and exclaimed, ‘Oh, how
provoking ! Poor Percival's—' then
she turned it the right way up, looked
unutterably foolish and meekly handed
it over to Aunt Lucy. It was from the
old lady's stockbroker and referred to
some transaction or other in Housing
Bonds.” -
“And what did Aunt Lucy say?”
I asked. -
“Oh, she just looked the least little
bit surprised,” replied Toby, “but she
to-morrow. Your three minutes
is up. Good-bye.”
With the inspiration still fresh
upon me I wrote out the telegram
and rang for Evangeline.
“Evangeline,” I said, “I may
possibly be detained in bed to-mor-
row morning. In case that should
happen"—she never betrayed even
a flicker of the eye, although she
could, an she would, tell Suzanne
some damning tales of late rising
during her absence—“please send
this telegram off before breakfast;
that is, before your breakfast.”
Evangeline curtseyed and with-
drew. I had spent my leisure mo-
ments during the week teaching
her the trick, as a surprise for Suz-
anne on her return.
Next morning, as I lay in bed
thinking out the subject of my next
Message to the Nation, I was grati-
fied to notice that the rain had
ceased and the sun was shining
genially. I thought of Suzanne and
the refreshing fruit in Suzanne's
relatives' attractive gardens. Should
I go after all? I rang the bell.
“Has that wire gone yet?” I
asked.
“Indeed I took it these two hours
back,” replied Evangeline.
I looked at my watch and grunted.

LATION, “YAH-YAH-YAH-SHR-R-RUP!”
didn't utter. Suzanne had to em-
brace the muddiest of all the cocker
ups to hide her flaming cheeks.”
“Well, what happened then 2"
“Then? Oh, then the telegraph-
boy fished out another wire from
his wallet. I took it, glanced at the
envelope and handed it to Suzanne.
This time she read it very gingerly
before exclaiming in a highly un-
emotional voice: “Oh, how pro-
voking ! Poor Percival's got one
of his sudden attacks of malaria
and can't come. So, if you don't
mind, Aunt Lucy, I'll catch the
eleven-fifteen back.' Aunt Lucy
was very sympathetic and went up
to help her with her packing, which
was accomplished in a surprisingly
short time; as a matter of fact she
had practically done it all before
breakfast. Just as she was going
to drive off to the station up came
another telegraph-boy. That was
your second wire, and Suzanne
didn't seem any too pleased to re-
ceive it. I'm not at all convinced,”
concluded Toby, “that your wife
would make her fortune on the
stage.”
“Do you think Aunt Lucy sus-
pects?” I asked.
“Bless you, no. The dear old
thing has the heart of a child.”
“Bring me a telegram-form,” I com-
manded, “and some hotter hot water.”
So, having wired to Suzanne: “Mal-
aria false alarm only passing effects of
overwork coming by the one-thirty
PERCIvaL,” I found myself at tea-time
being nursed back to health on mul-
berries-and-cream administered by the
solicitous hands of Aunt-by-acquisition
Lucy.
“Well,” I said to Suzanne a little
later as we strolled in the direction of
the fig-trees, “how did it go off—my
first wire, I mean 2'' -
“Oh, I think I did it very well,” she
replied; “I gave a most realistic ex-
hibition of wifely concern, and the car
had just come to take me to the station
when your second wire arrived.”
Toby. “You're a bit of an inventor,
aren't you?”
“What do you mean? Are you ven-
turing to imply—”
“I imply nothing. I merely state
that this morning Suzanne came down
to breakfast in her travelling-clothes.
And that wasn't all.”
“Wasn't it?” I inquired weakly.
“Tell me the worst.”
“All through breakfast,” continued
Toby with relish, “she was restless and
off her feed, and appeared to be listening
for something. Afterwards nothing
could induce her to leave the house, and
I myself caught her surreptitiously
studying the time-table. Every time a
step was heard coming up the drive she
started to her feet. At last a telegraph-
Maybe, but I have my doubts. Su-
zanne's aunt insisted on my staying
a week as a preventive against a nervous
breakdown, and the tonic with which
she herself dosed me several times a
day was the most repulsive beverage
I had ever tasted, effectually ruining
the savour of figs and mulberries. Can
it be that Aunt Lucy is not only of
a suspicious but also of a revengeful
nature ?
Suzanne ridicules my doubtings and
declares that she could make her aunt
swallow anything. I wish she could
have made her swallow my tonic.

sphere of Godalming in 1919. It would, of course, be utterly
beyond my scope to give in barest outline any list of the
wild and whirling events that begin when Captain Hugh
Drummond selects the most encouraging of the answers to
his “Bored ex-soldier” advertisement and meets the writer,
a cryptic but lovely lady, in the Carlton lounge, (Judging
by contemporary fiction, what histories could those walls
reveal!) After that the affair almost instantly develops
into one lurid sequence of battle, murder, bluff and the
kind of ten-minutes-here-for-courtship which proves that
there is a gentler side even to the process of tracking crime.
As usual, though less in this business than most, because
of the engaging humour of the hero, I experienced a mild
sympathy for the arch-villains; and indeed they might
well feel some bitterness when, after being described as
the master-intellects of the age, the author required them
to conduct their most secret affairs in a lighted ground-
floor room with the curtains undrawn. Most of them turn
out to be Bolshevists, or at least in the receipt of Soviet
subsidies—though I see a well-known Labour Daily reviewed
the plot as unconvincing. Odd l Anyhow, a rattling story.
I am aware that, in confessing to an entire ignorance of
any one of the so-called Books of Artemas, I place myself
in a minority so small as to be almost beneath notice. This
certainly is how the publishers regard the matter if one may
judge by their ecstatically jubilant, “Artemas has written
a novel ! 7s. 6d. net,” on the wrapper of A Dear Fool
W. Well, I have read the novel carefully, even
trust generously, with the unhappy result that (knowing
how elusive and individual a thing is laughter) I can hardly
bring myself to say how dull I found it. But the fact
remains. It is all about nothing—a preposterous little
plot for the identification, at a wildly inhuman reception,
of an anonymous dramatist, revealed finally as the journalist
hero who was nearly sacked for writing the play's only bad
notice. In my day I have met both editors and critics;
even dramatists. I don't say they were all pleasant people;
many of them were not. But—here is my point—prac-
tically every one of them had at least sufficient of our
common humanity to prevent them from behaving for one
instant as their representatives do in this book. Let us
charitably leave it at that. Probably the next man I meet
will have invited apoplexy over his enjoyment of the same
pages that moved me only to an irritated bewilderment.
You never can tell.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I rather think that The Man with the Rubber Soles
(Hodder AND Stoughton) is Sir ALEXANDER BANNERMAN's
firstling, at least as far as fiction is concerned. If so,
many others will share my hope that it may prove to be
the eldest of a large family. For the author has not merely
the knack of telling a good mystery story in a way that
keeps one interested until the last page is turned; he tells
it in a curiously dry matter-of-fact way that makes really
startling adventures seem the sort of thing that might hap-
pen to anybody. The story concerns the pursuit of a gang
of men who are engaged in importing forged Treasury notes
on a large scale and uttering them through skilfully or-
ganised agencies. The police and various civilians between
them—there is no super-sleuth to weary us with his
and settling down to plant potatoes and tobacco in pros-
perity and peace. -
From the title, Brute Gods (HEINEMANN), you may guess
that Mr. Louis WILKINson's new novel does not deal with
homely topics in a vein of harmless frolic. In recommend-
ing this very serious work of an expert author and observer,
I am bound to make some reservation. Unsophisticated
youth, if such there be in these days, should be kept away
from the affair between Alec Glaive and Gillian Collett.
Alec, a mere boy, was in a dangerously unsettled condition
when the lady crossed his path. His mother had upset a
not too happy family by eloping with a literary poseur; the
egoism of his father had been rendered even more oppres-
machine-like prowess—run the
thing to earth, partly by skill
and partly by good luck, and the
civilians in particular have a
stirring time doing it. Bombs,
automatic pistols, even soldiers
and a submarine, assist quite
naturally in sustaining the in-
terest. And a pleasant little
romance is really woven into the
plot, not just pushed in any-
how. Altogether The Man with
the Rubber Soles is a most excel-
lent story of its kind, a real
novel because plot and treat-
ment are alike new, and one can
safely prophesy that when Sir
ALEXANDER BANNERMAN pro-
duces his nextling he will find
a large and appreciative circle
of readers waiting to welcome it.
Three things charmed me
particularly about Henry Eliza-
beth (HURST AND BLACKETT),
whose remarkable second name
was due to the fact that he was
born in the same year as the
Virgin Queen and that his father
had hoped that he too would be
a girl. In the first place he
became the greatest swordsman
of his age and I was thus able
to add him to my fine collection
of Elizabethan heroes who have
achieved this honour. What

sive and his sarcasm even more
acid thereby; and a Roman
Catholic priest, intent on se-
curing a convert for his Order,
had been plying his young mind
with too exciting conversations
and too refreshing wines. Apart
from external circumstances,
Alec was tending to quarrel with
humanity at large, and so he
went the whole hog, more in
search of a desperate ideal than
by way of impetuous sin. Mr.
WILKINson treats the affair
with deliberate, cold-blooded,
even cynical analysis; and his
portrayal of the snobbery and
humbug of the upper-middle
class, social and intellectual, in
which his creatures move is
searching and disturbing. But,
I ask myself, are people really
like that ? Or rather are there
enough of these unnaturals, ex-
tremists, moral Bolshevists or
whatever you like to call them,
to justify their presentation as a
modern type? Always an op-
timist, I think not ; and I
notice that the author gives a
no less clever and a much more
convincing impression of the
normal, settled and pleasant
characters who are incidental
to the plot. Make for yourself

where all costume novels are merged I do not know. It
must be rather like the irresistible force and the immovable
object. In the second place H. E. (no one could better
deserve these formidable initials) was given the job of clear-
ing Lundy Island of its piratical tenants, and I happened to
have Lundy Island just opposite me as I read the book. It
is not often that a reviewer has the chance of checking
local colour with so little pains. And in the third place
Mr. JUSTIN HUNTLY McCARTHY informs me, on page 101,
that his hero will “gaze one day upon rivers to which the
Thames should seem little better than a pitiful rivulet.”
As Henry never gets further from his native Devon than
London in the course of this novel I take it that this is a
delicate allusion to the possibility of a sequel. I hope it is
so, and that I shall hear of Henry in days to come, after a
trip or two with RALEIGH or DRAKE, rebuilding his manor

[SEPTEMBER 8, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A COUP FOR “THE DAILY TRAIL.”
WE all knew at the office that
Micklebrown had gone to Cocklesea for
his holiday. If anyone had offered
him a free pass to the Italian lakes or
any other delectable spot Micklebrown
would have declined it and taken his
third return to Cocklesea. Like Sir
WALTER RALEIGH when he started for
South America to find a gold-mine,
Micklebrown had an object in view.
He hoped to discover a topaz in
Cocklesea. We knew the reason for
this optimism. We had been shown
the lizard-brooch, a dazzling thing of
gold and precious stones, which Mickle-
brown had picked up last Bank Holiday
on the cliff at Cocklesea and presented
to his fiancée, Miss Twitter, after in-
quiry at the police-station had failed to
discover its owner.
Most people would have been satisfied
to leave well alone, but Micklebrown
is a man who hankers after the little
more. The lizard's tail was composed
of topaz stones, and from its tip one
topaz was obviously missing. “My
firm impression is that I did the damage
when I trod on it,” Micklebrown said.
“You see I put my foot right slap on
the thing. I can't get it out of my head
that that topaz stuck in the mud and
it's sticking there to this day. Any-
way I go to Cocklesea for my holiday
to look. I know the very identical
spot.” He closed his eyes the better
to visualize it. “You go up a little
path behind the mixed-bathing boxes,
turn sharp to the right at the top of
the cliff, past two pine-trees and a
clump of gorse, go a trifle inland
through a lot of thistles until you
come on three blackberry bushes; the
topaz should be ten inches south-west
of the middle one.”
“The colour 'll be a bit washed out,
won't it?” young Lister said; “we’ve
had a lot of rain since Bank Holiday.”
Micklebrown's lip curled but he said
nothing. Only to us, his intimates,
did he confide that he had no expecta-
tion of finding the topaz on the surface;
he expected to search through several
strata of mud, and he was taking a
magnifying-glass and a gravy-strainer
with him. . . .
* We heard nothing further until I
had a postcard from him saying that
the rain had caused the blackberries so
to multiply that he found it impossible
to identify the particular bush near
which he had stepped on the lizard; he
was therefore making a general search
over the area. After that we followed
the tale in The Daily Trail:—
SEASIDE VISITOR’s STRANGE CoNDUCT.
Much curiosity has been aroused at
Cocklesea by the behaviour of a visitor
who spends his days on the cliff bur-
rowing in the earth in all weathers.
Speculation is rife as to the object of his
occupation. It is generally concluded
that he is the victim of shell-shock.
RoMANTIC DISCLosURE By CockLESEA
CLIFF BURRoweR.
In conversation with our representa-
tive yesterday Mr. Micklebrown, whose
burrowing on the cliff at Cocklesea
has been observed with such interest,
indignantly denied the imputation of
shell-shock. Mr. Micklebrown, it ap-
pears, is spending his vacation at Cockle-
sea in the hope of recovering a topaz
which formed part of a valuable piece
of jewellery which he had the good
fortune to pick up on the cliff on Bank
Holiday. Being anxious to notify his
discovery without delay to the police
(who however failed to trace the owner)
and being bound to catch the return
steamer, Mr. Micklebrown had no op-
portunity to prosecute a search at the
time. He therefore determined to visit
Cocklesea again at the earliest oppor-
tunity to do so.
In the meanwhile Miss Rosalind
Twitter, Mr. Micklebrown's fiancée, is
the happy possessor of the ornament.
Interviewed by a correspondent, Miss
Twitter, a winsome dark-eyed brunette
in a cretonne chemise frock, said, “Yes,
it is quite true that I sleep with it
under my pillow. I hope Dinky (Rosa-
lind's pet name for her lover) will find
the topaz; he is a dear painstaking
boy. I have never had such a lovely
piece of jewellery in my life and I am
going to be married in it.” (Photo of
Miss Twitter on back page. Inset (1)
The brooch; (2) Mr. Micklebrown.)
SEARCH FoR Missing TopAz AT
CockLESEA.
Owing to the publicity given to his
story by The Daily Trail hundreds of
willing hands assisted Mr. Micklebrown
in his search yesterday. Pickaxes,
shovels and wooden spades were being
freely wielded on the cliff. Miss Twitter
writes to us: “Every moment I expect
a telegram from Dinky that the topaz
is found. I can never begrateful enough
to The Daily Trail for the interest it
has taken in my brooch.”
DRAMATIC SEQUEL to SEARCH For
CockLESEA ToPAz.
As a result of the wide circulation of
The Daily Trail the brooch picked up
by Mr. Micklebrown on the cliff on
Bank Holiday has been claimed by
Miss Ivy Peckaby, of Wimbledon. Miss
Peckaby identified the brooch from the
photograph which appeared in our issue
of Friday. Conversing with our repre-
sentative, Miss Peckaby, a slim, golden-
haired girl in hand-knitted cerise jumper
with cream collar and cuffs, said, “I
jumped for joy when I recognised my
darling brooch on your picture page. I
must have lost it at Cocklesea on Bank
Holiday, but I didn't miss it until two
Sundays afterwards. I shall never for-
get what I owe to The Daily Trail.”
Questioned as to the missing topaz
Miss Peckaby sighed. “It has always
been missing,” she said. “You see,
Clarence” (Miss Peckaby's affianced
husband) “bought the brooch second-
hand; he is going to have another
topaz put in when he can afford it; but
topazes are so dreadfully dear.” (Photo
of Miss Peckaby recognising her brooch
on the back page of The Daily Trail.)
LAST CHAPTER IN CockLESEA Romance.
FREE GIFT OF A Topaz BY THE DAILY TRAIL.
Yesterday Miss Ivy Peckaby was the
happy recipient of a topaz at the hands
of a representative of The Daily Trail.
The stone, which is of magnificent
colour and quality, is the free gift of
The Daily Trail. The Daily Trail is
also defraying the entire cost of setting
the gem in Miss Peckaby's brooch.
(Photo on back page of Miss Peckaby
acknowledging The Daily Trail's free
gift of a topaz. Inset: The topaz.)
I have heard nothing further from
Micklebrown.

THE HUMAN CITY AND SUBURBAN.
THE idea and the name for it were
the invention of the ingenious Piggott.
I am his first initiate, and with the
zeal of the neophyte I am endeavouring
to make his discovery more widely
known. The game, which is healthy
and invigorating, can be carried on in
any of the remoter suburbs, where the
train-service is not too frequent. All
that is required is a fairly long and
fairly straight piece of road, terminat-
ing in a railway-station, and a suffici-
ency of City men of suitable age and
rotundity.
The scheme is based on the Herd
instinct—on the tendency of most crea-
tures to follow their leader. For ex-
ample, if you are walking down to your
early train, with plenty of time to spare
as you suppose, and you observe the
man in front of you looking at his
watch and suddenly quickening his
steps, first to a smart walk, then to a
brisk jog-trot, it is not in human nature,
however you may trust your own watch,
not to follow suit. This is precisely
what Piggott led me to do one morning
about six weeks back.
When, on reaching the station ten

minutes too early, I remonstrated with
him, he apologised.
“I am sorry,” he said; “I didn't
know you were behind me. I was really
pace - making for “Flyaway'— there,
over there.” And Piggott pointed to a
stoutish man with iron-grey whiskers
mopping his forehead and the inside of
his hat, and looking incredulously at
the booking-hall clock.
“But that is Mr. Bludyer, senior
partner in Bludyer, Spinnaway &
Jevons,” I said.
“It may be,” replied Piggott. “But
I call him Flyaway. I find it more
convenient to have a stable-name for
each of my racers.” And he proceeded
to expound his invention to me.
Like so many great inventors he had
stumbled upon the idea by chance one
morning when his watch happened to
be wrong; but he had developed the
inspiration with consummate art and
skill. It became his diversion, by means
of the pantomime that had so success-
fully deceived me—by dramatically
shooting out his wrist, consulting his
watch, instantly stepping out and pre-
sently breaking into a run—to induce
any gentleman behind him who had
reached an age when the fear of missing
trains has become an obsession to ac-
celerate his progress.
“It is amazing,” he said, “how many
knots you can get out of the veriest old
tubs. This morning, for instance,
Flyaway has taken only a little over six
minutes to cover seven furlongs. That's
the best I have got out of him so far,
but I hope to do better with some of
the others.”
“You keep more than one in train-
ing?” I questioned.
“Several. If you like I will hand
some over to you. Or, better still,” he
added, “you might prefer to start a
stable of your own. That would intro-
duce an element of competition. What
about it 2 '' -
I accepted with alacrity. The very
next day I made a start, and within a
week I had a team of my own in train-
ing. The walk to the station, which
formerly had been the blackest hour of
the twenty-four, I now looked forward
to with the liveliest impatience. Every
morning saw me early on the road,
ready to loiter until I found in my wake
some merchant sedately making his
way stationwards to whom I could set
the pace. I always took care, how-
ever, not to race the same one too fre-

quently or at too regular intervals, and
I take occasion to impress this caution
on beginners.
In the train on the way to the City
Piggott and I would compare notes,
carefully recording distances and times,
and scoring points in my favour or his.
It would have been better perhaps had
we contented ourselves with this modest
programme. Others will take warning
from what befell. But with the am-
bition of inexperience I suggested we
should race two competitors one against
the other, and Piggott let himself be
overpersuaded.
I entered my “Speedwell,” a promi-
nent stockjobber. Handicapped by the
frame of a Falstaff, he happily har-
bours within his girth a susceptibility
to panic, which, when appropriately
stimulated, more than compensates for
his excess of bulk. The distance fixed
was from the Green Man to the station,
a five-furlong scamper; the start to be
by mutual consent.
Immediately on our interchange of
signals I got my nominee in motion.
This is one of Speedwell's best points:
he responds instantly to the least sign,
to the slightest touch of the spur, so to
speak. Another is staying power. Be-
fore we had gone fifty yards I had got
him into an ungainly amble, which he
can keep up indefinitely. Though never
rapid, it devours the ground.
Piggott was not so lucky. At the
last minute he substituted for the more
reliable Flyaway his Tiny Tim, a dapper
little solicitor, not more than sixty, who
to the timorousness of the hare unites
some of her speed. In fact, in his excess
of terror he sometimes runs himself to
a standstill before the completion of the
course. He suffers, moreover, from short
sight and in consequence is a notori-
ously bad starter. On the morning in
question he failed for several minutes
to observe Piggott's pantomime, and
Speedwell had almost traversed half the
distance while Tiny Tim still lingered
in the vicinity of the starting post.
Only by the most exaggerated gestures
did Piggott get him off. Once going,
however, he took the bit in his teeth
and went like the wind. Soon I caught
the pit-pat of his footfall approaching.
I pulled Speedwell together for a su-
preme effort. But there were still two
hundred yards to cover as his rival drew
abreast. A terrific race ensued. Scared
at the spectacle of the other's alarm,
each redoubled his exertions. Neck and
neck they ran. Could Tiny Tim last 2

suddenly took fright and bolted. Inex-

[SEPTEMBER 8, 1920.
WEDDING PRESENTS.
ALL day long I had been possessed
by that odd feeling that comes over one
unaccountably at times, as of things
being a little strange, interesting—
somehow different, so that I was not
at all surprised to find the Fairy Queen
waiting for me when I entered my flat.
It was a warm evening and she sat
perched on the tassel of the blind,
lightly swaying to and fro in the tiny
breeze that came dancing softly over
the house-tops.
I saw her at once—one is always
aware of the presence of the Fairy
Queen.
I made my very best curtsey and
she acknowledged it a little absent-
mindedly.
“I want your advice this time,” she
said.
I smiled and shook my head depre-
catingly.
“But how . . . 2” I began.
“It's about Margery and Max,” she
continued.
I was much astonished.
“Margery and Max,” I echoed slowly.
“But surely there's no need to trouble
about them. It's a most delightful
engagement. They're blissfully happy.
I saw Margery only yesterday . . .”
“Oh, the engagement's all right,”
said the Queen. “As a matter of fact
it was I who really arranged that affair.
Of course they think they did it them-
selves—people always do—but it would
never have come off without me. No,
the trouble is I don't know what to
give them for a wedding present. You
see I'm particularly fond of Margery;
I've always taken a great interest in
her, and I do want them to have some-
thing they'll really like. But it's so
difficult. They have all the essential
things already: youth, health, good
fortune, love of course; and I can't go
giving them motor-cars and grand-
father clocks and unimportant things
of that kind. Now can I ?”
I agreed. As it happened I was in a
somewhat similar predicament myself,
though from rather different causes.
“Can't you think of anything 2" she
asked a little petulantly, evidently
annoyed at mry inadequacy. I shook
my head.
“I can't," I said. “But why not
find out from them 2 It's often done.
You might ask Margery what Max
would like and then sound him about
her.”
The Queen brightened up. “What
a good idea!" she said. “I’ll go at
once.” She's very impulsive.
She was back again in half-an-hour,
looking pleased and excited. Her cheeks
were like pink rose-leaves.
“It's all right about Max,” she said
breathlessly. “Margery says the only
thing he wants frightfully badly is a
really smashing service. He 's rather
bothered about his. So I shall order
one for him at once. I'm very pleased;
it seems such a suitable thing for a
wedding present. People often give
services, don't they 2 And now I'll
go and find Max.” And she was off
before I could utter a sound.
But this time when she returned it
was evident that she had been less
successful.
“It's absurd,” she said, “perfectly
absurd ' " She stamped her foot, and
yet she was smiling a little. “I told
him I would bestow upon Margery any-
thing he could possibly think of that
she lacked. That any quality of mind
or heart, any beauty, any charm that
a girl could desire, should be hers as a
gift. I assured him that there was
nothing I could not and would not do
for her. And what do you think? He
listened quite attentively and politely—
oh, Max has nice manners—and then
he looked me straight in the eyes and
‘Thank you very much,' he said; “it’s
most awfully kind of you. I hope you
won't think me ungrateful, but I'm
afraid I can't help you at all. There's
nothing—nothing. Margery—well, you
see, Margery's perfect.’ I was so an-
noyed with him that I came away with-
out saying another word. And now
I'm no further than I was before as
regards Margery. Mortals really are
very stupid. It's most vexing.”
She paused a minute, then suddenly
she looked up and flashed a smile at
me. “All the same it was rather dar-
ling of him, wasn't it 2 " she said.
I nodded. “I wonder . . . ,” I began.
“Yes 2" interjected the Queen
eagerly.
“. . . I wonder whether you could give
her that, just that for always 2"
“What do you mean 2" said the
Queen.
“I mean,” I said slowly, “the gift
of remaining perfect for ever in his
eyes.”
The Queen looked at me thought-
fully. “He’ll think I'm not giving
her anything,” she objected. -
“Never mind,” I said, “she 'll know.”
The Queen nodded. “Yes,” she said
meditatively, “rather nice—rather nice.
Thank you very much. I'll think about
it. Good-bye.” She was gone. R. F.

NEW RHYMES FOR OLD CHILDREN.
THE CENTIPEDE.
THE centipede is not quite nice;
He lives in idleness and vice;
He has a hundred legs;
He also has a hundred wives,
And each of these, if she survives,
Has just a hundred eggs;
And that's the reason if you pick
Up any boulder, stone or brick
You nearly always find
A swarm of centipedes concealed;
They scatter far across the field,
But one remains behind.
And you may reckon then, my son,
That not alone that luckless one
Lies pitiful and torn,
But millions more of either sex—
100 multiplied by x– -
Will never now be born.
I daresay it will make you sick,
But so does all Arithmetic.
The gardener says, I ought to add,
The centipede is not so bad;
He rather likes the brutes.
The millipede is what he loathes;
He uses fierce bucolic oaths
Because it eats his roots;
And every gardener is agreed
That, if you see a centipede
Cof versing with a milli—,
On one of them you drop a stone,
The other one you leave alone—
I think that's rather silly.
They may be right, but what I say
Is, “Can one stand about all day
And count the creature's legs?”
It has too many, any way,
And any moment it may lay
Another hundred eggs;
So if I see a thing like this'
I murmur, “Without prejudice,”
And knock it on the head;
And if I see a thing like that”
I take a brick and squash it flat;
In either case it 's dead.

(l) and (-). There ought to be two pictures
here, one with a hundred legs and the other
with about a thousand. I have tried several
artists, but most of them couldn't even get a
hundred on to the page, and those who did
always had more legs on one side than the
other, which is quite wrong. So I have had
to dispense with the pictures.

Mary settled her shoulders against
the mantel-piece, slid her hands into
her pockets and looked down at her
mother with faint apprehension in her
eyes.
“I want,” she remarked, “to go to
London.”
Mrs. Martin rustled the newspaper
uneasily to an accompanying glitter of
diamond rings. Mary's direct action
slightly discomposed her, but she replied
amiably. “Well, dear, your Aunt Laura

Her mother started. “What do you
mean?” she inquired sharply.
Mary rose languidly. “However,"
she added graciously, “I will put that
right for you next week. I have several
sketches that will do.”
Mrs. Martin's face registered inquiry,
incredulity, indignation and apoplexy
in chronological order; then the garden
gate clicked and a young man walked
across the lawn. Mary looked down at
her mother and spoke quietly.
“I think it is time you knew that
I wrote those articles. One writes
about what one sees, and as long as I
remain here I shall see Mudford.”
“Pardon me,” began the young man,
continued abstractedly, “to live

Mrs. Martin glanced up at her
daughter as if discrediting the
authorship of this remark. “I
don't know what you are think-
ing of, child,” she said tartly,
“but you appear to me to be
talking nonsense. Your father
and I have no idea of leaving
Mudford at present.”
“I want,” Mary went on in
the even tone of one hypnotised
by a foregone conclusion, “to go

Mrs. Martin's gesture as she
rose expressed as much horror
as was consistent with majesty.
“My dear Mary,” she said
coldly, “let me dispose of your
outrageous suggestion before it
goes any further. You appear
to imagine that because you
have been earning a couple of

Mrs. Martin, “will you kindly

Here Mary interposed. “My

her.
“Then you...?" he queried.

her mother with a glance.

'E IT's 'EE AGAIN IN THE ZAME PLACE I shall 'Ave to give 'EE out.”
MOVEMENT IN THE MONEY MARKET.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--I have been
spending my holiday at a watering place,
a place that fully deserves its epithet.
My London daily has been my only
entertainment, and towards the evening
hours I have found myself wandering
about the less familiar beats of it. I
have become an intimate of the City
Editor, and I hasten to inform you, Mr.
Punch, that he has introduced me to a
side of the Gay Life which I have been
missing all these years. I will set out
the tale of it, even at the risk of making
your readers blush. -
It appears that recently a feeling
spread in the Market (and that all these
goings-on should take place in a market
adds, in my view, to their curiousness)
that a crisis had been reached in mone-
tary restrictions and things might be
eased a bit. Apparently there is a
circle of people in the know, and by
them it was immediately appreciated
what this “relaxation” implied. The
first overt sign of something doing was
a “heavy demand for money,” a need
which I too, for all my quiet domes-
ticity, have felt from time to time. No
doubt the fast City set were filling their
pockets before commencing a course of
“relaxation.” The next development
was that the Market was approached
from all sides with “applications for
accommodation.” I can picture the
merry parties rolling up in their thou-
sands, booking every available house,
flat or room, and even paying very
fancy prices for the hire of a booth for
a house-party.
It may give you some idea of the
nature of their “relaxation” when I say
that our old friend the Bank of England
seems to have so far forgotten herself as
to start making advances to the Govern-
ment. My City Editor, who is possibly
a family man, cannot bring himself to
give details; he just states the fact,
merely adding the significant comment
that “the usual reserve of the Bank is
rapidly disappearing.” The effect of
this example is appearing in the most
respectable quarters. “All attempts
are now failing,” he reports, for example,
“to keep the Fiduciary Issue within
limits.” Reluctantly he mentions a
“considerably freer tendency in Dis-
count circles.”
Further he records a tendency to
over-indulgence in feasting. I read of
figures (I hardly like to quote this bit)
becoming “improperly inflated.” Will
you believe me when I add that a sec-
tion of those participating in the beano,
whose one fear was, apparently, that it
would all end only too soon, actually
were heard expressing the apprehension,
to quote verbatim, “that they would
deflate too rapidly.” “The whole tone
of the Market,” says my City Editor,
“became distinctly cheerful,” and he
pauses to comment on the one redeem-
ing feature: “War Loan remaining
steady, 84}; middle.”
And thence to the shocking climax:
Trade Returns were unable to balance
properly, and Money (to be absolutely
outspoken and no longer to mince
matters) got tight.
After this I was not surprised to read
of “Mexican Eagles rising on the an-
nouncement of the new Gusher.” Nor
a little later to find the announcement,
“Stock Exchange Dull.” A very nat-
ural reaction.

0N RUNNING DOWN TO BRIGHTON.
WHEN I consulted people about my
nasal catarrh, “There is only one thing
to do,” they said. “Run down to
Brighton for a day or two.”
So I started running and got as far
as Victoria. There I was informed that
it was quite unnecessary to run all the
way to Brighton. People walked to
Brighton, yes; or hopped to Kent; but
they never ran. The fastest time to
Brighton by foot was about eight hours,
but this was done without an overcoat
or suit-case. Even on Saturdays they
said it was quicker to take the train
than to walk or to hop. - • ,
Brighton has sometimes been called
London by the Sea or the Queen of
Watering Places, but in buying a ticket
it is better to say simply Brighton, at
the same time stating whether you
wish to stay there indefinitely or to be
repatriated at an early date. I once
asked a booking-clerk for two sun spots
of the Western coast, and he told me
that the refreshment-room was further
on. But I digress.
One of the incidental difficulties in
running down to Brighton is that the
rear end of the train queue often gets
mixed up with the rear end of the tram
queue for the Surrey cricket ground,
so that strangers to the complexities
of London traffic who happen to get
firmly wedged in sometimes find them-
selves landed without warning at the
“Hoval" instead of at Hove. To avoid
this accident you should keep the right
shoulder well down and hold the
shrimping-net high in the air with the
left hand. If you do get into the train
the best place is one with your back to
the window, for, though you miss the
view, after all no one else sees it either,
and you do get something firm to lean
up against. It was while I was
travelling to Brighton in this manner
that I discovered how much more
warm this summer really is than many
writers have made out.
Around Brighton itself a lot of legends
have crystallized, some more or less
true, others grossly exaggerated. There
is an idea, for instance, that all the
inhabitants of this town or, at any rate,
all the visitors who frequent it, are
exceedingly smart in their dress. Almost
the first man whom I met in Brighton
was wearing plus 4 breeches and a
bowler hat. It is possible, of course,
that this is the correct costume for
walking to Brighton in. Later on I
saw a man wearing a motor mask and
goggles and a blue-and-red bathing
suit. Neither of these two styles is
smart as the word is understood in the
West End.
Then there is the story that prices,
especially the prices of food, are exceed-
ingly high in Brighton. After all, the
cost of food depends everywhere very
much upon what you eat. I see no
reason for supposing that the price of
whelks in Brighton compares unfavour-
ably with the price of whelks in other
great whelk-eating centres; but the
price of fruit is undeniably high. I
saw some very large light-green grapes
in a shop window, grown, I suppose,
over blast furnaces, and when I asked
what they cost I was considerably sur-
prised. Being afraid, however, to go
out of the shop without making a pur-
chase, I eventually bought one.
But these things are all by the way.
It was when I reached the sea-front at
Brighton that I made the tremendous
discovery which is really the subject of
this article. I realised the secret of

Brighton's charm. It can be stated
very simply. It lies in the number of
things one needn't do there.
At little seaside resorts, such as
Cockleham, there are a very limited
number of things that people do, and
as soon as one gets to Cockleham an
irresistible inclination seizes one not to
do them to-day. If anybody says it is
a good day for bathing you say it is
better for boating. And if they agree
you wonder if, after all, golf . . . And
so you preserve your independence and
feel rested and stave off for a little
while the evil day. But only for a
little. Very soon, for lack of alterna-
tive suggestions, you are bound to be
dragged in and do something.
But at Brighton the number of things
to do is so enormous and so varied that
you can spend days and days in not
doing them. On the pier alone there
are something like a hundred compli-
cated automatic machines which you
needn't work; there are fishing-rods
which you needn't hire, and concerts
to which you needn't listen. The sea
is full of rowing boats and motor-
launches which you needn't charter,
and the land is full of motor-brakes
which you needn't board. You needn't
mixed-bathe nor go and watch the pro-
fessional divers, nor the fish in the
Aquarium, nor the people with Norman
profiles arriving in motor-cars at the
hugest hotels. You can simply sit still
on the beach and discuss which of these
exciting things you won't do first. And
while you sit still on the beach you can
throw pebbles into the sea. No one has
ever thrown as many pebbles into the
sea in his life as he wanted to, because
someone keeps saying, “Well, you must
decide; ” but at Brighton you can
throw more than in any seaside place
that I know. And, now I come to
think of it, I wonder that there is no
charge for throwing pebbles into the
sea at Brighton. I should have thought
a low wall with turnstile gates and
three or four shies a penny . . . but I
leave this commercial idea for the Town
Council to work out.
When I had thrown a great many
pebbles into the sea I began to nerve
myself for the struggle of returning.
Over that struggle I prefer, as the say-
ing is, to draw a veil. Suffice it to say
that it is harder to run up to Brighton
than it is to run down. But whilst I
was running up I made a curious and
interesting discovery. I found that the
spell of Brighton had cured my cold.
I had lost it in the soothing excitement
of wondering what not to do next. This
is the true panacea. EvoB.
RHYMES OF THE UNDERGROUND.
THE story has been told to you
Of good Adolphus Minns of Kew,
Whose virtuous ways have won renown
From Barking Creek to Acton Town.
Now with that hero's blameless life
Contrast the conduct of his wife:
Avoidance of egregious sins
Is not the way of Mrs. Minns.
That lady, I regret to say,
While bent on shopping every day,
Makes no attempt to get it o'er
Between the hours of ten and four.
To harassed booking-office clerks
She makes irrelevant remarks,
And tenders, to the crowd's despair,
A pound-note for a penny fare,
Or, what perhaps is even worse,
Starts fumbling in a baggy purse.
She'll step aboard a Highgate train,
Then check and double back again,
And ask a dislocated queue
If she is right for Waterloo.
The liftmen, who, you recollect,
Spoke of Adolphus with respect,
Are pessimistic, even for them,
About the fate of Mrs. M.
Where Gertrude Minns will go when she
Departs this life is not for me,
Or you, or liftmen, to decree.
And, any way, we needn't fret;
She shows no sign of dying yet.

A MUCH
NIMROD.
NIMRoD he was a hunter in the days of long ago,
Caring little for things of state, little for things of show;
When the unenlightened around him squabbled for wealth
or fame
NIMRod fled to the forests and gave himself up to Game.
I've never been told what jungles old NIMRod called his
own,
Or studied the “Sportsman's Record" he scratched on a
shoulder-bone;
I haven't heard what he shot with nor even what game he
slew,
But I know he was fore-forefather to fellows like me and
you.
He stood to the roaring tiger, he stood to the charging gaur;
His was the love of the hunting which is more than the lust
of war;
He knew the troubles of tracking, the business of camps
and kits,
And the pleasure that pays for the pain of all—the ultimate
shot that hits.
Now I've nowhere seen it stated, but I'm certain the thing
occurred,
That when NIMRod came to his death-bed he sent his rela-
tives word,
And said to his sons and his people ere his spirit obtained
release,
“You follow the trails I taught you and your ways will bring
you peace."
Wherefore—as now and to-morrow—when the souls of men
were sick, -
When wives were fickle or fretful or the bills were falling
thick,
When the youth was minded to marry and the maiden with-
held consent,
Heeding the words of NIMRod, they packed their spears and
went—
Went to the scented mornings, to the nights of the satin
In OOn
That can lap the heart in solace, that can settle the soul in
tune;
So they continued the remedy NIMRoD of old began–
The healing hand of the jungle on the fevered brow of man.
Then—as now and to-morrow—mended and sound and sane,
Flushed by the noonday sunshine, freshed by the twilight
rall),
Trailing their trophies behind them, armed with the strength
of ten,
Back they came from the jungle ready to start again.
Ye who have travelled the wilderness. ye who have followed
the chase,
Whom the voice of the forest comforts and the touch of the
lonely place;
Ye who are sib to the jungle and know it and hold it good—
Praise ye the name of NIMROD, a Fellow Who Understood.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE PRUDE's FALL.”
THOUGH the hero is French and takes
up his residence in an English cathe-
dral town in order to rectify our British
prudery and show us how to make
love, there is practically nothing here
that is calculated to bring a blush to
the cheek of modesty. It is true that
from time to time Captain le Briquet
kisses various outlying portions of his
“ange adoré,” but it is all very decorous
and his ultimate intentions are strictly
respectable.
You see, he was really just playing a
game. Big game was his speciality
(Africa) and this one was to be as big
as an elephant. It consisted in the
correction of a flaw which he had
found in the object of his worship,
the lovely young Widow Audley,
who had refused in his very presence
to receive a woman, an old friend of
hers, who had preferred love to re-
putation. He, the gallant Captain,
proposed to amend this error. By
his French methods he would re-
duce the Widow to such a state
of helplessness that she would con-
sent to become his mistress. The
fact that he happened to be a
bachelor, and perfectly free to marry
her, should not be allowed to stand
in the way of his scheme. He
would explain that the exigencies
of his vocation as a hunter of big
game demanded a greater measure
of liberty than was practicable
within the bonds of matrimony.
He would be “faithful but free.”
In the course of a brief month
the interval between the First and
cond Acts, for we are not per-
mitted to see how he does it) she
has become as putty in his hands.
She consents to be his mistress, and is
indeed so determined to adopt this in-
formal style of union that when he
produces a special marriage licence she
is indignant at such a concession to the
proprieties. But once again the Cap-
tain proves irresistible with his French
methods and all ends well.
Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER was the
life and soul of the play, which would
have been a dullish business without
him. His reappearances were always
hailed as a joyous relief to the prevailing
depression. Even Dean Carey—most
delightful in the person of Mr. GILBERT
HARE-became at one time a gloomy
Dean; and Miss LILIAN BRAITH waite,
who played very tenderly in the part
of Mrs. Westonry (the lady who had
lost her reputation), could not hope to
be very entertaining with her reminis-
cences of a lover whom we had never
had the pleasure of meeting.
Captain le Briquet .
Sir Nevil Moreton, Bart.
Mrs. Audley again (treated naturally
and with a pleasant artlessness by Miss
EMILY BRooKE) did not take very kindly
to the conquest of her scruples and gave
little suggestion of the rapture of surren-
der. Further, the authors paid a poor
compliment to English gentlemen by
providing the Captain with a dull boor
for his rival. The contrast was a little too
patent. Even so Mr. FRANKLIN DYALL
might perhaps have made the rôle of
Sir Nevil Moreton appear a little less
impossible. But, however good he may
be in character parts or where melo-
drama is indicated, he never allowed us
to mistake him for a British Baronet.

gloom was the Dean's wife, played with
the most attractive grace and humour
by Miss NINA Boucicault.
A note of piquancy was given to Mr.
DU MAURIER's part by his broken
English. “Broken" is perhaps not quite
the word, unless we may speak of a
torrent as being broken by pebbles in
its bed. There were momentary hesi-
tancies, and a few easy French words,
such as pardon 2 pourquoi donc 2 c'est
permis 2 alors, were introduced to flatter
the comprehension of the audience; but
for the rest his fluency—and at all
junctures, even the most unlikely—was
simply astounding. Few people, speak-
ing in their native tongue, can ever have
commanded so facile an eloquence.
What chance had a mere Englishman
against him 2 -
. The action of The Prude's Fall was
supposed to take place in 1919, but its
atmosphere was clearly ante-bellum.
Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER,
Anyhow there was no sign of the
alleged damage done to our moral stan-
dards by the War. But nobody will
quarrel on that ground with Mr. BESIER
and Miss EDGINTON, the clever authors
of this very interesting play. And if
we have to be taught how to behave by
a Frenchman, to the detriment of our
British amour propre, there is nobody
who can do it so nicely and painlessly
as Mr. DU MAURIER.
“WEDDING BELLs.”
I BEGIN to suspect that the possible
situations of marital farce are becoming
exhausted. Certainly we have lost the
power of being staggered by the emer-
gence of an old wife out of the past. But
Mr. SALISBURY FIELD, who wrote
Wedding Bells for America, is not
content with a single repetition of
this ancient device; he must needs
give us these intrusions in tripli-
cate, showing how they affect the
career of (1) the hero, (2) his man-
servant, (3) a poet-friend. True he
only produces two old wives; but
one of them, being a bigamist,
was able to intrude “in two
places" (as the auctioneers say).
The wife of Reginald Carter (Mr.
OweN NAREs), having first run
right away from him and then ap-
arently divorced him for desertion
(I told you the play was American),
turns up on the eve of his marriage
to another. He has barely re-
covered from his failure to keep his
future wife in ignorance of his past
when he has to start taxing his
brains all over again in order to
keep his past wife in ignorance of
his future. -
The First Act went well enough
and was full of good words—not
very subtle perhaps, but the kind
that invites intelligent laughter. Later
the play degenerated into something
too improbable for comedy and not
boisterous enough for pure farce.
The two most disintegrating elements
were furnished by a love-sick poet (a
figure that should have been vieur jeu
in the last century) and an English
maid who could never have existed
outside the imagination of an American.
I make no complaint of the fact that
in a chequered past she had married
both Carter's man-servant and the anti-
quated poet; but I do complain that
her Cockney accent was imperfectly
consistent both with her rustic origin
(an apple-cheeked lass, we were told,
from somewhere in Kent) and her situa-
tion as maid to a very smart American.
You will naturally ask what Mr.
Owen NAREs was doing in this galley;
and I cannot tell you. I can only say
that he was very brave about it all. In

a sense it was a serious performance,
the only one of its kind in the play; yet
not serious enough to serve as a foil for
the general frivolity, for he was con-
stantly bringing his own high sentiments
into ridicule, and so burlesquing the
OweN NAREs that we love to take
seriously.
On the other hand, Miss GLADYs
Cooper, as Rosalie, his late wife, was
untroubled by high sentiment; she was
content to be wayward and unseizable,
confident in the obvious power of her
charm to retrieve him from the very
altar-rails. Her own heart never seemed
to come into the question, and her mo-
tive in setting herself to recover him
was not much clearer than her reason
for deserting him.
Some of the minor characters gave
good entertainment. There was a dude
(is that what they call them now in
America?) who dressed very perfectly
and said a great many funny things
all well within the range of his own,
and our, intelligence. Mr. DEveRELL
played the part with admirable restraint.
And we could ill have spared the hu-
mours of Carter's man Jackson (Mr.
WILL WEST), whose wide experience in
matrimony, resulting in an attitude
alternately timorous and prehensile to-
wards female society in the servants'
hall, was the source of many poignant
generalisations. Miss EDITH EVANs, as
a mother-in-law manquée, showed a
touch of real artistry; and Mr. GEORGE
CARR had no difficulty in getting fun
out of the part of a Japanese house-
boy, almost the only novelty which we
owed to the American origin of the play.
When Carter was turned down by
a clergyman who refused to perform
the marriage rites for a divorced man,
there was something very attractive
(to a golfer) in his protest against these
“local rules.” This was one of many
good things said; but the play had its
dull times too, and there were one or
two lapses made in the pursuit of the
easy laugh. For instance:–
Carter. “Do you believe in God?”
Wills. “Good God!” (laughter).
[Carter here kneels down to get something
from under the sofa.
Wills. “Are you going to pray?" (laughter).
Personality, of course, counts for
much, and both Miss GLADYs Cooper
and Mr. Owen NAREs have enough
admirers to ensure a success for this
rather moderate farce. But not a
triumph, I fear; for, after all, the play
counts for something too and, though
all the Faithful may be trusted to put
in one appearance, I doubt if many out-
side the ranks of the Very Faithful
will turn again at the sound of these
Wedding Bells. O. S.

THE famous commanders of old

But their names, as recorded in song,
As a rule were excessively long—

Those polysyllabic old days,
And the names that confounded the

Were monosyllabic—like Foch ;
But for brevity minus alloy
Give me Generalissimo OI.

For MILTIADEs, plucky old bean,
Or the names of the heroes of Troy;
But there's plenty of room for an Oi.

But in action a regular peach—

Whose name is so tunefully brief.

And no murmur, no drotoroi

THE BRITISH TARPON.
By our Piscatorial Erpert.
I HAVE read with great interest, tem-
pered by a little disappointment, the
article of Mr. F. A. MitchELL-HEDGEs
on “Big Game Fishing in British
Waters,” in The Daily Mail of Septem-
ber 1st. He tells us of his experiences
in catching the “tope,” a little-known
fish of the shark genus which may be
caught this month at such places as
Herne Bay, Deal, Margate, Ramsgate,
Brighton and Bournemouth, where he
has captured specimens measuring
7 feet long within two hundred-and-
fifty yards of the shore.
Personally I have a great respect for
the tope and for the topiary art, but
I cannot help regretting that Mr.
MITCHELL - HEDGEs has omitted all
mention of another splendid fish, the
stoot, which visits our shores every year
in the late summer and may be caught
at places as widely distant as Bar-
mouth and Great Yarmouth, Porthcawl
and Kylescue.
The stoot, be it noted, is a cross be-
tween the porpoise and the cuttle-fish;
hence its local name of the porputtle.
It is a clean feeder, a great fighter and
a great delicacy, tasting rather like
a mixture of the pilchard, the anchovy
and the Bombay duck.
For tackle I recommend a strong
greenheart bamboo pole, like those used
in pole-jumping, about eighteen feet in
length, and about three hundred yards
of wire hawser, with a Strathspey four-
some reel sufficiently large to hold it.
Do not be afraid of the size of the
hook. The stoot-fisher cannot afford
to take any risks. I do not wish to
dogmatise, but it must be big enough
to cover the bait. And the stoot is ex-
tremely voracious. Almost anything
will do for bait, if one remembers, as I
have said above, that the stoot is a
clean feeder. At different times I have
tried a large square of corridor soap, a
simulation pancake, three pounds of
tough beefsteak or American bacon, or
a volume of Sir HENRY Howorth's
History of the Mongols, and never with-
out satisfactory results.
On arriving at the feeding ground of
the stoot, cast your line well out from
the boat with a small howitzer. You
wait anxiously for the first bite; sud-
denly the hawser runs taut and there
is a scream from the reel. But do not
be afraid of the reel screaming. In the
circumstances it is a very good sign.
Plant the butt of your rod or pole firmly
in the socket fitted for the purpose in
all motor-stooter boats and let the fish
run for about a parasang, and then
strike and strike hard. The battle is
now begun. Be prepared for a series
of tremendous rushes. You will see
the stoot's huge bulk dash out of the
water; you will hear his voice, which
resembles that of the gorilla. This
may go on for a long time: if the stoot
be full-grown it will take you quite
an hour to bring him alongside the
boat. Then comes the problem of how
to get him in — the hardest of all.
The gaff, if possible a good French
gaffe, is indispeñsable, but the kilbin,
a marine life-preserver resembling a
heavy niblick, is a handy weapon at this
stage of the conflict. Strike the fish
on the head repeatedly—but never on
the tail—until he is paralysed and then
grasp him firmly by the metatarsal fin
or, failing that, by the medulla oblong-
ata, but keep your hands away from
his mouth. The teeth of the stoot
are terribly sharp and pyorrhoea is not
unknown in this species.
Having got the fish on board you
will need a spell of rest. An hour's
battle with a stoot is the most sudorific
experience that I know, even more so
than my contests with red snappers at
Mazatlan, in Mexico, or bat-fish off the
coasts of Florida. A complete change
is necessary,
I have already spoken of the eating
qualities of the stoot, which exceed
those of the tope. One is enough to
provide sustenance for a small coun-
try congregation. Cooked en casserole,
or filleted, or grilled and stuffed with
Carlsbad plums, it is delicious.
And lastly it lends itself admirably
to curing or preserving. Bottled stoot is
in its way as nutritious as Guinness's.

THERE was a haughty maiden
Who lived in London Town,
With gems her shoes were laden,
With gold her silken gown.

In all the scented East,
Where the hot and spicy wind is,
No lady of the best -
Can vie with me,” said None-so-pretty
As down she walked through London
City. - -
“Our walls stand grey and stately;
Our city gates stand high ;
Our lords spend wide and greatly;
Our dames go sweeping by ;
Our heavy-laden barges -
Float down the quiet flood
Where on the pleasant marges
Gay flowers bloom and bud.
Oh, there's no place like London City,
And I'm its crown,” said None-so-pretty.
The fairies heard her boasting,
And that they cannot bear;
So off they went a-postin
For charms to bind her there.
They wove their spells around her,
The maiden pink and white;
With magic fast they bound her,
And flowers sprang to sight -
All white and pink, called None-so-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Miss SHEILA KAYE-SMITH continues to be the chronicler
and brief abstractor of Sussex country life. Her latest
story, Green Apple Harvest (CASSELL), may lack the bril-
liant focus of Tamarisk Town, but it is more genuine and of
the soil. There indeed you have the dominant quality of
this tale of three farming brothers. Never was a book more
redolent of earth; hardly (and 1 mean this as a compliment)
will you close it without an instinctive impulse to wipe your
boots. The brothers are Jim, the eldest, hereditary master
of the great farm of Bodingmares; Clem, the youngest, living
contentedly in the position of his brother's labourer; and
Bob, the central character, whose dark and changing
fortunes make the matter of the book, as his final crop of
tragedy gives to it the at first puzzling title. There is too
much variety of incident in Bob's uneasy life for me to
follow it in detail. The tale is sad—such a harvesting of
green apples gives little excuse for festival—but at each
turn, in his devouring and fatal love for the gipsy, Hannah,
in his abandonment by her, and most of all in his breaking
adventures of the soul, now saved, now damned, he remains
a tragically moving figure. Miss KAYE-SMITH, in short,
has written a novel that lacks the sunshine of its pre-
decessors, but shows a notable gathering of strength.
Would you not have thought that at this date motor-cars
had definitely joined umbrellas and mothers-in-law as
themes in which no further humour was to be found 2
Yet here is Miss JESSIE CHAMPION writing a whole book,
The Ramshackle Adventure (Hodder AND Stoughton),
all about the comical vagaries of a cheap car—a history
that, while it has inevitably its dull moments, has many
more that are both amusing and full of a kind of charm
that the funny-book too often conspicuously lacks. I
think this must be because almost all the characters are
such human and kindly folk, not the lay figures of galvanic
farce that one had only too much reason to expect. For
example, the owner of the car is a curate, whose wife is sup-
posed to relate the story, and George has to drive the Bishop
in his unreliable machine. Naturally one anticipates
(a little drearily) upsets and ditches and episcopal fury,
instead of which—well, I think I won't tell you what
happens instead, but it is something at once far more
probable and pleasant. I must not forget to mention that
the cast also includes a pair of engaging lovers whom
eventually the agency of the car unites. Indeed, to pass
over the lady would display on my part the blackest
ingratitude, since among her many attractive peculiarities
it is expressly mentioned that she (be still, O leaping
heart!) reads the letter-press in Punch.
Mrs. EDITH MARY MooRE has devoted her great abilities to
proving in The Blind Marksman (Hodder AND SToughton)
how shockingly bad the little god's shooting became to-
wards the end of last century. She proves it by the frus-
trated hopes of Jane, her heroine, who in utter ignorance
of life marries a man whose pedestrian attitude of mind is
quite unfitted to keep pace with her own passionate and
eager hurry of idealism. She becomes household drudge to
a master who cannot even talk the language which she
speaks naturally, and discovers in a man she has known
all her life the lover she should have married, only to lose

him in the European War. Here you have both Jane and
the ineffective husband—for whom I was sincerely sorry,
because he asked so very little of life and didn't even get
that—badly left, and the case against Cupid looks black.
Mrs. MooRE does what she can for him by blaming our
Victorian ancestors and their habits of mind; but I think it
is only fair to add that, delightful as Jane is, she was not
made for happiness any more than the people who enjoy
poor health have it in them to be robust, and that, true as
much of the author's criticism is, she has not been able to
give The Blind Marksman, for his future improvement, any
very helpful ideas as to how he is to shoot.
The Devil, in so far as I have met him in fiction, has
usually been a highly successful intriguer on behalf of any-
one prepared to make the necessary bargain. Sir RoNALD
Ross, however, to judge from the rather confused mediaeval
happenings in the Alps which are faithfully described in
The Revels of Orsera (MURRAY), has rather a low opinion
of the intelligence of Mephistopheles. Anyhow, a cer-
which all presently become suitors for the hand of Becky.
This in effect is the story—under which thimble will the
heart of the heroine be eventually found?—a problem that,
in view of the obviously superior claims of young St.
Cloud over his two elderly rivals, will not leave you long
guessing. An element of novel complication is however
furnished by the device of making St. Cloud at first engaged
to Ray's daughter, who, subsequently retiring into the
Franciscan sisterhood, left her fiancé free to become the
rival of her widowed father. (As the late DAN LENo used
to observe, this is a little intricate '). For the rest, as I
have said, an agreeable, very feminine story of mingled
sentiment, commerce and ecclesiastical interest, the last
predominating.
It is possible that The Sea Bride (MILLs AND Boon) may
be too violent to suit all tastes, for Mr. BEN AMES WILLIAMs
writes of men primitive in their loves and hates, and he
describes them graphically. The scenes of this story are
set on the whaler Sally, commanded by a man of mighty

dying dwarf as her knight.
If the plot of The Revels of Orsera is a little unsatisfying
the elaboration of scenic description and mediaeval pageantry
is conscientious in the extreme, and the laughter which
followed the malicious pranks of Gangogo, the professional
jester of the tourney, must, if I am to take the author's word
for it, have made the glaciers ring. There is a great deal
in the way of philosophy and psychology that is very
baffling in this book, but of one thing I feel certain, and
that is that the Elemental Spirits of the Heights, to whom
frequent allusion is made, must find the winter sports of a
later age a sorry substitute for the rare old frolics of the
fifteenth century.
It can at least be claimed for Mrs. MARGARET BAILLIE
SAUNDERS that she has provided an original setting and
“chorus” for her new novel, Becky & Co. (HUTchINson).
Tales of City courtship have been written often enough,
but the combination here of a millinery establishment
and a community of Little Sisters of St. Francis under one
roof in the Minories, gives a stimulating atmosphere to a
story otherwise not specially distinguished. Becky was, as
perhaps you may have guessed, head of the millinery busi-
ness, next door to which was housed the firm of Ray, St.
Cloud dº Sliggany, leather-dressers, the three partners in
story. I am going to keep
my eye on Mr. WILLIAMs, chiefly because he can write
enthrallingly, but partly to see if he will accept a word of
advice and be a little more sparing in his use of those
little dots . . . which are the first and last infirmity of
writers who have no sense of punctuation.
When a young man sets out to London to make money
for his relations he usually (in a novel) writes a book which
sells prodigiously—quite an easy thing to do in a novel.
Mr. John WILBERFoRCE, however, avoids the beaten track
in The Champion of the Family (FISHER UNwiN). Jack
Brockhurst, the champion in question, became a member
of the Stock Exchange, and, if you will accept my invitation
and follow his fortunes, I can promise you a fluttering time.
Mr. WILBERFoRCE's name is unknown to me, and I judge
him more experienced in the mysteries of the Stock Ex-
change than in the art of fiction; but I like his constructive
ability and I like his courage. He does not hesitate to
make his champion a prig, which is exactly what a youth
so idolised by his family would be likely to become. But,
though a prig by training, Jack was not by nature a bore,
and his relations (especially his father and sister) are de-
lightful people. Altogether I find this a most promising
performance.

THE PRODIGIES.
WE—Great-aunts Emily and Louisa—had in our inno-
cence been telling a few old fairy stories at bedtime to those
three prococities whom our hosts call their children.
We knew that they talked Latin and Greek in their sleep
and were too much for their parents in argument, but we
thought that at least, at the story hour
We were stopped by Drusilla. “I don't think much of
the moral of that one,” she remarked. “It would seem to
illustrate the Evil Consequences of Benevolence ' "
“But she came alive again,” said Evadne, the youngest,
in extenuation. -
“And the wolf was killed,” we ventured in defence of
our old story. -
“Still,” persisted Drusilla, “ you couldn't call it en-
couraging.”
“Then in the other case,” went on Claude thoughtfully,
“considering that she had been left in sole charge of the
house and had no business to go out and leave it to the
mercy of burglars, what moral are we to draw from the fact
that she married a Prince and lived happily ever after-
wards 2 ”
“Most of them have that sort of moral,” said Drusilla.
“And they are every one of them devoid of humour, ex-
cept of the most obvious kind—no subtlety.”
“When I was your age,” said poor Louisa gently, “I
used to laugh very heartily over the adventures of Tom
Thumb.”
Claude seemed touched. “There are some capital situ-
ations in certain of them,” he conceded, “which might be
quite effectively treated.”
“How 2" we asked weakly.
It was Drusilla, the most alarming of the children, who
finally undertook to sketch us out an example.
After a short meditation, “Something like this,” she said.
“The situation, of course, you have met with before, but as
remodelled you might call it—
THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE ;
OR,
THE BAD FAIRY FOILED.
A certain King and Queen had one daughter, to whose
christening they invited a large company, forgetting as
usual a particularly important and bad-tempered Fairy, who
signified her annoyance in the usual manner.
The attendants of the little Princess (having read their
story-books) were preparing dolefully enough to fall asleep
for a hundred years, when the Fairy, with a contemptuous
sniff, remarked that the spell would not take effect for some
time yet.
They breathed again and had almost forgotten the affair
by the time the Princess had grown up. But the Fairy had
so arranged it that the spell fell upon the Princess at the
time when she was engaged in making her choice of a
husband from among the suitors who had arrived at her
father's Court.
The Princess was now bewitched in this way—that good
men appeared bad, ugly men handsome, and vice vers(i.
The Fairy had hoped that she would thus make a mess of
her matrimonial affairs and live unhappily ever after.
But she had reckoned without the disposition of the
Princess, a kind good girl with an overpowering sense of
duty. When pressed to choose, she replied firmly, “I will
have no other than Prince Felix.”
To her his ugliness seemed pathetic and his character
evidently needed reformation so urgently that she longed
to be at the job. No one wondered at her choice, for he
was, of course, the most handsome and excellent of men.
Ultimately the Fairy broke her spell in a fit of exaspera-
tion, but without any gratifying result. The Princess seemed
happier than ever and would sometimes say to a slightly
puzzled friend —
“Hasn't Felix improved wonderfully since I married
him 2 ” -
“From 1910 to 1916 he was Viceroy in India, governing the
Dependency through very critical years and enjoying general esteem,
as was made clear in 1912, when an attempt was made to assassinate
him at Delhi.”—“Daily Mail’’ on Lord Hardinge.
It sounds like a succès d'estime.

THE COAL CUP.
IT seems to me that we all take a
great deal of interest in the miners
when they strike, but not nearly enough
when they hew. And yet this business
of hacking large lumps of fuel out of a
hole, since civilisation really depends
on it, ought to be represented to us
from day to day as the beautiful and
thrilling thing that it really is. Yet if we
put aside for a moment Mr. SMILLIE's
present demands, we find the main topics
of discussion in the daily Press as I
write are toughly these :-
(1) The prospects of League Foot-
ball and the Cup Ties,
(2) Ireland.
(3) The prevalence
amongst blue-eyed cats.
(4) Mesopotamia.
(5) The Fall of Man.
(6) The sale of The Daily Mail, whose
circulation during the coming winter is
for some reason or other supposed to
be almost as important to the children
of England as their own.
Of all these topics the first is, of
course, by far the most absorbing, and
almost everyone has remarked how the
love of sport, for which Britons are
of deafness
famous, is growing more passionate than
ever. It is not only cricket and foot-
ball, of course ; only the other day
there was a shilling sweepstake on the
St. Leger in our office and, from what
I hear of the form of Westmorland in
the County Croquet Championship dur-
ing the past season—but I have no
time to discuss these things now.
The point is that, whilst this excite-
ment over games grows greater and
greater, the country is suffering, say
the economists, from under-production
and the inflation of the wage-bill. This
means that everyone is trying to do
less work and get more money for it,
a very natural ambition which nobody
can blame the miners from sharing. I
suppose that if they all stopped mining
and we had to depend for warmth on
wrapping ourselves up in moleskins,
the molliers, or whatever they are called,
would strike for a two-shillings rise as
well.
The worst of it is that under-produc-
tion, say the economists again (there is
no keeping anything from these smart
lads), sends prices up. Obviously then
there is only one thing to do: we must
take advantage of the prevailing passion
and make mining (and other industries
too for that matter) a form of sport.
The daily papers should find very little
difficulty in doing this.
WHO HEWS HARDEST?
CLAIM BY A LANARKSHIRE COLLIER
would do very well for the headings of
a preliminary article; and the claim of
the Lanarkshire collier would, I am
sure, be instantly challenged. After a
few letters we might have a suggestion,
say from Wales, that no team of eleven
miners could hew so hard and so much
as a Welsh one. And from that it
would be only a short step to the for-
mation of district league competitions
and an international championship.
Or the old-time system under which
cricketers were matched for a stake by
sporting patrons might be revived, and
we should have headlines in the evening
Press after this fashion –

hewing of coal is not a spectacular
affair. You cannot pack sixty thousand
spectators into a mine to watch a hew-
ing match, and even if you could the
lighting is bad; but that is just where
the skill of the reporters would come
in. After all, we do not most of us see
the races on which we bet: nor the Golf
Championship, nor even BECKETT and
WELLs. But there would be articles
on the correct swing whilst hewing, and
the proper stance, and how far the toes
should be turned in ; the chances of
every team would be discussed; the
current odds would be quoted, and, who-
ever won, the consumer would score,
whilst the strongest hewers would be-
come popular heroes and be photo-
graphed on the back-page standing
beside their hews. -
I admit that the South of England
and London in particular would have
very little share in these competitions,
and we should depend for local interest
mainly upon the promising young colts
from the Kentish nurseries. But we
could find out from our dealers where
our coals came from and follow from afar
the fortunes of our adopted teams; and
Cabinet Ministers, at any rate, could
distribute their patronage and their
presence with tact over the various
areas involved.

supersede trade unions, would soon be

SEVEN WHITEBAIT.
HERE and there in the drab routine
of modern existence it is still possible to
catch an occasional glimpse of romance
and courageous living, and in the
volume which lies before us as we
write we are given a generous measure
of peril and adventure in faery seas
forlorn. From Whitebait to Kipper:
The Story of Seven Lives, is the vivid
record of a family of herrings, set down
(posthumously, it would seem) with re-
freshing simplicity by Walter Herring,
the youngest and perhaps the most bril-
liant of the family. The story begins
with the early childhood of Walter,
John, Isabel, Margaret, Rupert, Stéph-
anie and little Foch, the last of whom
was so named because he was born on
the anniversary of the Armistice. (As
a matter of fact they were all born on
the same day, but for some reason which
is not explained only one of them was
called Foch.)
You, reader, are one of those ignorant
people who do so much discredit to our
Public Schools. You fondly think that
the whitebait is a special kind of fish,
that there are father whitebaits and
mother whitebaits and baby whitebaits.
You are wrong. There are only baby
whitebaits. At least there are baby
herrings and baby pilchards, and these
are called whitebait because they are
eaten by the mackerel and because
they look white when they are swim-
ming upside down.
Anyhow Walter and John and Isabel
and Margaret and Rupert and Stéphanie
and little Foch began life as whitebait.
They used to charge about the Cornish
seas with whole platefuls of other white-
bait, millions of them, and wherever they
went they were pursued by thousands
of mackerel, who wanted to eat them.
One day John felt that the moment was
very near when he would be eaten by
a mackerel, and he was quite right.
Isabel felt the same thing, but she was
wrong. She jumped out of the water
and was eaten by a sea-gull. When
the fishermen saw Isabel leaping into
the air they came out and caught the
mackerel in a net. They also caught
Margaret with a lot of other whitebait,
and she was eaten by a barrister at
“Claridge's.”
There were now four of the family
who had not been eaten by anyone. It
is extraordinary when you come to
think of it that any herring ever con-
trives to reach maturity at all. What
with the mackerel and the seagulls and
the barristers, everybody seems to be
against it. However, Walter, Rupert
and Foch succeeded. Stéphanie just
missed. Walter and Rupert and Foch
had jolly soft roes, a fact which is
recorded in a cynical little poem by the
precocious Foch, believed to be the
only literary work of a whitebait now
extant. We have only space here to
quote the opening couplet:-
The herrings with the nice soft rows
Are gentlemen; the rest are does.
The survivors of the family had now
to choose a career. From the beginning
it seems to have been recognised that
Stéphanie at least would have to be con-
tent with a humbler sphere than her
more gifted brothers. She had a hard
roe and was rather looked down upon.
But she was an independent little thing ||
and her pride revolted at a life of subjec-
tion at home; so while still a girl she
went off on her own and got mixed up
with some pilchards who were just being
caught in a net. Stéphanie was caught
too and became a sardine. She was
carefully oiled and put in a tin, and she
was eaten at a picnic near Hampton
Court. But there is every reason to
suppose that she was eaten happy,
since in those less exacting circles
nobody seemed to mind about her hard
roe, which had been a perpetual bug-
bear to her in the herring world.
Meanwhile the remaining three had
decided on a career. They were de-
termined to be fresh herrings. This is
of course the highest ambition of all
herrings, though sadly few succeed in
attaining it. One herring in his time
plays many parts (SHARspeARE); he
can seldom say with confidence what
exactly he will be to-morrow; but he
can be fairly certain that it won't be a
fresh herring. Of our three survivors
Rupert alone was to win the coveted
distinction. He grew to be a fine boy
and was eaten at Hammersmith, where
his plump but delicate roe gave the
greatest satisfaction. It was not eaten
in the ordinary humdrum way, but was
thickly spread on a piece of buttered
toast, generously peppered,and devoured.
And when his “wish” was placed on
the kitchen-range, swelled rapidly and
burst with a loud report, his cup of
happiness was full.
Little Foch, alas, failed to fulfil his
youthful promise and became a com-
mon bloater. Worse than that, he was
bloated too thoroughly and was almost
impossible to eat. Even his lovely roe,
the pride of his heart, became so salt
that the Rector of Chitlings finally re-|
jected it with ignominy, though not ||
before he had consumed so much of it
that he had to drink the whole of his
sermon-water before he began to preach.
But it was Walter, Walter the
chronicler, Walter the clever, the
daring, the ambitious, leader in every
escapade, adviser in every difficulty,
who was to suffer the crowning humili-
ation. Walter became a kipper. If
there is one thing that a herring cannot
stand it is to be separated from his roe.
Walter's roe was ruthlessly torn from
him and served up separate on toast,
with nothing to show that it was the
glorious roe of Walter. It was eaten
at the Criterion by a stockbroker, and
it might, have been anybody's roe.
Meanwhile the mutilated frame, the
empty shell of Walter, was squashed
flat in a wooden box with a mass of
others and sold at an auction by the
pound. It broke his heart. A. P. H.

Coustry gossips, nodding slow
When the fire is burning low,
Or chatting round about the well
On the green at Ashlins Dell,
With many a timid backward glance
And fingers crossed and eyes askance,
Still tell about the Midmas Day
When Marget Malherb went away.
“After Midmas Day shall break,
Maidens, neither brew nor bake:
See your house be sanded clean;
Wear no stitch of fairy green;
Go barefoot; wear nor hose nor shoon
From rise of sun to rise of moon;
For the Good People watch and wait
Waiting early, watching late,
For foolish maids who treat with
SCOlin
The mystic rites of Midmas Morn.”
Marget Malherb tossed her head,
“I fear no fairies' charms,” she said
For she'd new slippers she would
Weal’
To show her lad the pretty pair,
Soft green leather, buckled red—
“I fear no fairies' charms,” she said.
She drew them on and laughed in
SCOrn,
And out she danced on Midmas Morn.
Nevermore was Marget seen;
But when her lover sought the green
A Fairy Ring was all he found–
A Fairy Ring on the weeping ground;
And by the hedge a flower grew,
Long and slender, filled with dew,
Green and pointed, ribboned red :
And still you'll find them as I've
said.
And Marget comes, so gossips say,
To wear her shoes on Midmas Day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DIFFERENCE OF CLASS.
It is without doubt the most expen-
sive hotel on the front, and the palatial
dining-room in which we have just
lunched is furnished and decorated in
that sumptuously luxurious style to
which only wealth, untrammelled by art,
is able to attain. Personally I cannot
afford to take my meals at such places,
and I know that the same holds good
of my fellow-guest, Charteris. Charteris
was the best scholar of our year at
Oriel, and since his demobilisation he
and his wife have been living in two
has excited them greatly, for they con-
tinue to stare up at us with a hostile
concentration that renders them quite
unconscious of the frantic efforts of |.
the small child who accompanies them
to tug them towards the beach. After
a moment they exchange a few more
quick words, and the man leaves his
companion and makes his way towards
us. Ascending the hotel steps with an
air of great determination he comes to
a halt before the couple opposite.
“’Ere, I've bin lookin' for you,” he
begins accusingly.
The Rolls-Royce owner takes the
eye. For the moment the object of
this serious charge is too taken aback
to be capable of speech.
“‘Ran over my child's bloon,'" re-
peats the other inexorably. “Leastways
your chauffer did. An' when we 'ollered
out to yer to stop you just rushed on
like a runaway railway-train.”
Rolls-Royce, conscious of the curious
aze of the entire company, pulls him-
self together and regards his accuser
unfavourably.
“First I've 'eard of it,” he growls.
“Where was the balloon anyway? In
the road, I spose 2"
rooms, except during the periods
when their son joins them fol
his holidays from Winchester.
But our host is still possessed
of an obstinate wealth which
even the War has done little to
diminish, and, as he himself puts
it, is really grateful to those of
his old friends who will help
him in public to support the
ignominy.
At the moment, having finished
lunch, we have betaken ourselves
to wicker-chairs in the porch,
and Charteris and our host being
deep in a golf discussion I ven-
ture once more to turn a covert
attention to the exceedingly
splendid couple who have just
followed us out from the dining-
room. I noticed them first on
my arrival, when they were just
getting out of their Rolls-Royce,
and the admiration which I
then conceived for them was
even further enhanced during
lunch by a near view of the
lady's diamonds and of the
Cinquevalli-like dexterity shown
by her husband in balancing a
full load of peas on the concave
side of a fork. At present the
man, somewhat flushed with
champagne, is smoking an enor-
mous cigar with a red-and-gold

“Yes, it was in the road,”
retorts the other defiantly,
“where it's got every right to
be. Road's there for the con-
venience of bloon-fliers just as
much as for motor-cars. More.”
“Look 'ere, that's enough of
it,” says the car-owner harshly.
“If the balloon got run over
it's yer own fault for letting it
go in the road.”
“That's a nice way to talk,”
suddenly comes in shrill tones
from the woman below, who
has edged her way to the foot
of the steps. “We don't go
buyin' balloons for you to run
over in yer cars. We're respect-
able people, we are, an' we work
for our livin'.”
“Drivin' about in a car like
an express train, runnin' over

roborates her husband bitterly.

band round it, while the lady, her dia-
monds flashing in the sunshine, leans
back in her chair and regards with
supercilious eyes the holiday crowds
that throng the pavement below.
Following her glance my attention is
suddenly arrested by the strange be-
haviour of two passers-by, who have
stopped in the middle of the pavement
and, after exchanging some excited com-
ments, are staring fixedly towards us.
From their appearance they would seem
to be a typical husband and wife of the
working-class on holiday, and it occurs
to me that, given the clothes and the
diamonds, they might well be occupy-
ing the wicker-chairs of the couple op-
posite. Evidently the sight of some-
body or something in the hotel porch
cigar from his mouth and gazes in as-
tonishment at the accusing apparition
before him.
“A hour ago,” pursues the newcomer
relentlessly, “you was driving along
the front here in a whackin' great car.
It ain't no good denyin' it, 'cos I took
the number.”
“What d'ye mean—denying it?” ex-
claims Rolls-Royce. “Who's denying
anythink?"
“It ain't no good tryin' to deny it,”
retorts the other. “An' it ain't no good
denyin' wot you did neether, 'cos I've
got my missus 'ere to prove it.”
“What I did?” echoes the astonishe
man. “What did I do?” -
“Ran over my child's b'loon,” states
the accuser, fixing him with a pitiless
with an impatient movement.
“Not on yer life,” he snaps. “They
won't get a cent out o' me.”
“Ho, won't we!” exclaims his accuser
hotly. “We’ll soon see about that.
We're English people, we are—we
don't allow people to go about destroyin'
our b'loons.”
“No wonder they're so rich,” cries
the woman at the bottom of the steps
in satirical tones. “That's the way
to get rich, that is—destroyin' other
people's prop’ty an' then refusin' to
pay for it. Anybody could get rich
that way.”
Reflections on the feasibility of this
novel financial scheme are cut short by
the appearance at the top of the steps
of the hotel porter, who touches the

“Come on, you're not allowed up

“Ho, ain't I?” retorts the man de-
fiantly. “Is this Buckingham Pallis’ ”
“You can't come up 'ere unless you've

“So I 'ave got bisness 'ere,” declares
the other. “Bisness c'nected with my

“An' we don't leave 'ere till it's

pavement. “’Alf-a-crown that balloon

This is altogether too much for the
owner of the Rolls-Royce.
“'Alf-a-crown 2" he explodes and
turns indignantly to the company.
“’Alf-a-crown for a child's balloon, and
then they go on strike.”
Derisive cheers and counter-cheers
go up from the crowd below as the
incensed balloon-owner bursts forth
into an impassioned defence of his in-
alienable right as a free-born Briton to
strike or to buy half-crown balloons as
the spirit moves him. Simultaneously
the lady in the diamonds rises and,
producing a coin from her gold bag,
holds it with a superb gesture at arm's
length beneath his nose. For a moment
or two he pays no attention to her,
then takes the coin impatiently with
the air of one brushing aside an irri-
tating interruption and continues his
harangue.
“Come on,” puts in the porter;
“you've got yer 'alf-crown. S'pose
you move on.”
“Got me 'alf-crown, 'ave I?” he
retorts. “Wot about my rights as a
man 2 Does 'alf-a-crown buy them 2"
No one venturing to solve this social
problem he turns slowly and, glaring
over his shoulder at Rolls-Royce, de-
scends the steps.
“I’m an Englishman, I am,” he con-
cludes from the pavement. “No one
can't close my mouth with 'alf-crowns.”
For a brief space he stands scowling
up at the porch as though challenging
all and sundry to perform this feat,
then, taking his wife by the arm, moves
off with her and the still insistent
child towards the beach. The crowd
on the pavement, regretfully convinced
that the entertainment is at an end,
disperses slowly. Rolls-Royce, seem-
ingly unconscious of the interest of
Charteris and our host, who are looking
at him covertly as at some zoological
specimen, relights his cigar and sits
glowering across the road, and silence
falls upon the scene—a silence broken
at last by the lady in the diamonds,
who has resumed her languid pose in
the wicker-chair.
“'Orrible people !” she observes, ad-
dressing the occupants of the porch
generally. “Nice state o' things when
you can't even be safe from 'em in yer
own 'otel. You don't seem to be able
to get away from these low-class people

FASHION AND PHYSIQUE.
THE heightened stature of women was
a favourite topic in anthropometric
circles long before the War. It seems,
however, that they are not going to
rest content with their present standard
of altitude, but are invoking the re-
sources of Art to render it even more
conspicuous. We do not speak rashly
or without book. The Evening News
announced on September 8th that
“Women are to be taller this autumn.”
Nature may be in the Fall, but women
are on the rise. The mode by which
this effect of elongation—so dear to
Art—is to be attained is described in
detail by the Paris correspondent of
our contemporary as follows:–
“A fluffy and very high head-dress
will be worn this autumn. The effect is
obtained by the aid of pads, and adds
some inches to a woman's stature . . .
Another type of coiffure is being adopted
by some hairdressers, who leave the
hair flat and smooth round the face,
and only make a sort of bird's-nest, of
the ends, which stand well up so as to
lengthen the profile in an upward
direction.”
Nothing, however, is said about the
relation of fashion to the physique of the
sterner sex. To correct this omission
Mr. Punch has interviewed a number
of West-End tailors, hatters, hosiers
and bootmakers. The results of this
inquiry may be briefly summarised.
Heads are to be larger this autumn,
and to keep pace with the extraordinary
development of brain amongst our in-
surgent youth, as evidenced by the
correspondence in The Morning Post,
it has been found necessary to make
a radical change in the stock sizes of
hats. But, where there has been no
cranial distension, provision will be
made to remedy the defect by the in-
sertion of a cork sheath, by the aid of
which a head of undersized circum-
ference will be able to wear a No. 8
hat. Again, to meet the needs of cus-
tomers in whom the temperature of
the cranial region is habitually high, a
hat has been devised with a vacuum
lining for the insertion of cold water.
The “Beverley” nickel-plated refriger-
ating helmet, as it is called, has already
found a large sale amongst Balliol
undergraduates.
As a result of the revival of the “Apes
v. Angels” controversy, in which Canon
BARNEs has taken so prominent a part,
and Mr. BottomLEY has declared him-
self as a whole-hearted supporter of
DARwin (vide his article in The Sunday
Pictorial), hands will be supple and
boneless this autumn, as in fashionable
portraits. This reversion to the pre-
hensile type of hand, so noticeable in
the chimpanzee, has its drawbacks,
and the rigidity necessary for certain
manual functions, such as winding up
a motor or opening a champagne bottle,
will be furnished by gloves of a stiffer
and stronger fabric, ranging from simu-
lation leatherette to chain-mail.
Owing to the continued over-crowd-
ing of trains, tubes and motor-buses,
elbows will be more prominent and
aggressive than ever, and tailors are
building a type of coat calculated to
relieve the strain on this useful joint
by a system of progressive padding,
soft inside but resembling a nutmeg-
grater at the point of contact with the
enemy.
It only remains to be added that in
consequence of the publication of the
Jewish Protocol and other documents
gº to revolutionary and anarchical
emitic activities, noses will be worn
straighter and d la Grecque, and for
similar reasons feet will be shorter and
with more uplift in the instep.
A Hot Spell.
From a story for boys:–
“The heat was so intense that we, were
perspiring from every paw."

WHAT A RELIEF IT IS To
THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE ROCK, SCILLY.
“OLD woman, old woman, old woman,”
said I, -
“'Tis a mighty queer place to be
building a home
In the teeth of the gales and the
wash of the foam,
With nothing in view but the sea and
the sky;
It cannot be cheerful or healthy or
dry.
wº don't you go inland and rent a
snug house,
With fowls in the garden and blos-
soming boughs,
Old woman, old woman, old woman 2"
said I.
“A garden have I at my hand
Beneath the green swell,
With pathways of glimmering sand
And borders of shell.
There twinkle the star-fish and there
Red jellies unfold;
The weed-banners ripple and flare
All purple and gold.
And have I no poultry? Oh, come
When the Equinox lulls;
The air is a-flash and a-hum
With the tumult of gulls;
They whirl in a shimmering cloud
Sun-bright on the breeze;
They perch on my chimneys and
crowd
To nest at my knees,
And set their dun chickens to rock on
the motherly
Lap of the seas.”
“Old woman, old woman, old woman,”
said I,
“It sounds very well, but it cannot
be right;
This must be a desolate spot of a
night,
With nothing to hear but the guille-
mot's cry,
The sob of the surf and the wind sough-
ing by.
Go inland and get you a cat for your
knee
And gather your gossips for scandal
and tea,
Old woman, old woman, old woman,”
said I.
“No amber-eyed tabby may laze
And purr at my feet,
But here in the blue summer
days
The seal-people meet.
They bask on my ledges and romp
In the swirl of the tides,
Old bulls in their whiskers and pomp
And sleek little brides.
Yet others come visiting me
Than grey seal or bird;
Men come in the night from the sea
And utter no word.
Wet weed clings to bosom and hair;
Their faces are drawn;
They crouch by the embers and stare
And go with the dawn
To sleep in my garden, the swell flow-
ing over them
Like a green lawn.”
PATLANDER.
Labour Leaders on the Links.
Under a photograph in a London
evening paper runs the following
legend:—
“Mr. John Hodge and another official of the
Iron and Steel Founders Union enjoy a game
of golf after the Trade Union Congress at
Portsmouth adjourns for the day. Our picture
shows Mr. John Hodge Putting.”
Some idea of the forceful and unconven-
tional methods of our Labour leaders
may be gathered from the attitude of
Mr. John Hodge, whose club is raised
well over his shoulder.

THE TAXATION OF VIRTUE.
“I shall wait,” said Peter, “till they
send me the final notice.”
“Being his wife,” said Hilda to me,
“I am in a position to know that he
will not. In another week he will pay,
saying that the thought of income-tax
has affected his nerves and that he can
bear it no longer. He wobbles like this
for six weeks twice a year, and mean-
while his family starves.”
“Under our system of taxation,” Peter
retorted, “the innocent must suffer.”
“It falls alike on the just and the
unjust,” I interposed. “How else would
you have it?”
“Naturally I would have it fall on
the unjust alone,” he replied.
“Why not on the just alone?” I
asked, suddenly aware of the birth of
an idea.
“Of course you want exemption.”
“You miss my point. You grant that
taxation is necessary 2”
“For the sake of argument,” said
Peter, “I grant that, with reservations.”
“Since then there must be taxes, why
not have taxes that it would be a plea-
sure to pay? The current taxes are
not a pleasure to pay.”
“I grant that,” said Peter, “without
reservations.”
“Now there is only one sort of tax
that I can imagine anybody paying
gladly, and that would be a tax on his
virtues.”
“Still hankering after your own ex-
emption,” growled Peter.
“Leave me out of account. Take, by
preference, yourself. You have virtues
and are proud of them.”
Hilda intervened, as I had anticipated.
“The pride is admitted,” said she, “but
as for the assessment value of the
virtues
“Never mind that. You are proud of
your virtues"—I turned to Peter again
—“yet you are sometimes troubled,
like the rest of us, by a fear that you
may not really possess them after all.
But the assessment of your virtues by
the Board of Inland Revenue would
prove their existence to yourself and to
all the world.”
“Except his wife,” said Hilda.
“Her evidence would not be accepted.
If you had paid taxation for the pos-
session of a virtue, the receipt would be
a guarantee that you did possess that
particular virtue, and it would conse-
quently be a source of profound moral
satisfaction to you. You would pay
with pleasure. Besides, it is a poor
kind of virtue that will not abide a
test. The tax would be a test. Sup-
pose that five pounds was levied upon
you for honesty. If you refused to pay
how could you ever again claim to be
honest ? You would be marked as not
valuing your honesty at five pounds.
No, you would pay and pay readily.”
My words were addressed to Peter,
but Hilda seemed the more interested.
“It sounds well, but how would you
raise the money 2” she asked.
“That would depend on the virtue,”
I replied. “The sobriety tax, for ex-
ample, would be levied on anyone who
had not for some years been convicted
of drunkenness.”
“But how about the virtues that you
don't get fined for not having—truth-
fulness, unselfishness, kindheartedness
and all those 2"
“I admit that would be difficult.
Can you suggest anything?” I asked
Peter.
“No,” he answered. “I'm not en-
couraging your rotten idea anyhow.”
“Could the revenue officials feel peo-
ple's bumps?” inquired Hilda reflec-
tively.

“I'm afraid,” I said, “people wouldn't
stand it. Fancy Peter x -
“I’ve got it,” said Hilda. “The
revenue officials would attribute a vir-
tue to the taxpayer, and if he wanted
to escape taxation they would require
him to prove to them that he lacked
the virtue in question.”
“They would like doing that,” mut-
tered Peter.
“You have found the solution,” I
said to Hilda. “If you impute to a
person a virtue he does not possess he
probably denies that lie has it, but he
is really flattered and his denial is not
sincere. He would be willing to pay
on it; he would rather pay than not.”
At this point Peter grew tired of re-
fraining from comment. “I don't want
you to suppose,” he said, “that I am tak-
ing any interest in your fatuous scheme,
but doesn't it occur to you that under
your system it would be simply ruinous
to have any virtues at all, and that the
only people who would flourish would
be those who had no virtues and were
not ashamed of it 2 ''
“For one thing,” I replied confidently,
“the taxes would be graduated in the
ordinary way in accordance with means.
The slightest flicker of a conscience
in Park Lane would be more heavily
mulcted than the most blameless life in
Bermondsey. But the main point is
that under my system taxation would
become the measure of a man's moral
worth, and people who did not pay
taxes would simply out of it. All
the plums would go the highly-taxed
men. Their tax receipts would be cer-
tificates of character, and the more they
earned the more the Treasury would be
able to get out of them. So far from
dodging taxation, people would scramble
to pay it.” -
“But how,” asked Hilda, “would you
make the tax receipt a trustworthy
testimonial 2 Your rich man with one
virtue would have a better receipt than
your poor one with ten.”
“The virtues taxed would be shown
on the receipt,” I replied. “Besides,
poor and virtuous men would, as I have
suggested, get an abatement on their
virtue taxes, and the amount of the
abatement would be shown on the re-
ceipt. So it could easily be seen what
proportion a man was paying on his
wealth and what on his virtues.”
“Look here,” said Peter, aroused at
last, “do you convey that the tobacco
duty would be paid by people who
didn't smoke 2''
“It would amount to that,” I an-
swered, “assuming that abstention from
tobacco were counted a virtue.”
“There may be something in it after
all,” said Peter.
NEW RHYMEs FOR OLD CHILDREN.
THE CHAMELEoN.
THE chameleon changes his colour;
He can look like a tree or a wall;
He is timid and shy and he hates to
be seen,
So he simply sits down in the grass and
goes green,
And pretends he is nothing at all.
I wish I could change my complexion
To purple or orange or red;
I wish I could look like the arm of a
chair .
So nobody ever would know I was
there
When they wanted to put me to
bed.
I wish I could be a chameleon
And look like a lily or rose; -
I'd lie on the apples and peaches and
pears,
But not on Aunt Margaret's yellowy
chairs—
I should have to be careful of those.
The chameleon's life is confusing;
He is used to adventure and pain;
But if ever he sat on Aunt Maggie's
cretonne
And found what a curious colour he'd
one,
I don't think he'd do it again.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THAT TEA INTERVAL.
BEForf, the last ball of 1920 is bowled and the last wicket
in a first-class match falls (as will most probably happen at
the Oval this very afternoon, September 15th), I should like
to let the Gods of the Game know how I propose to spend
the following winter in their interests, so that when the
season of 1921 is with us the happiness of the cricket
spectator may be even greater than it has been in the one
now expiring. -
I am going to devote the time to invention. With every
grain of intellect and ingenuity that I can scrape together
I am going to devise a means of humanising the tea
interval.
Once upon a time I was so rash as to ridicule this inter-
ruption. I drew attention to the fact that the ancient
heroes of the game had been able to dispense with it.
ALFRED MYNN needed no Asiatic stimulant between lunch
and the close of play. Even such wholehearted moderns
as HoRNBY and SHREwsBURY and GRACE managed to do
well without the support of Hyson or Bohea. For more
than a century cricket and tea were strangers and cricket
did not suffer. And so on. But the attacks were futile: the
tea interval became an institution; and nothing now, one
realises, can ever occur to separate the gallant fellows from
their cups and saucers.
That being accepted, the problem is how to make the
interval at once less harmful to the match and more tolerable
to the lover of cricket; and it is on this problem that I have
been working and intend to work through the arid football
months. What has to be done is (a) to get the interval
abbreviated; and (b) to keep the players on the field. It is
the length of it and the empty pitch that are so depressing
to the spectator, and it is the return to the pavilion that is
so detrimental to the rhythm of the game. Neither of the
batsmen ever wants the interruption, and I have often
noticed a reluctance in certain members of the fielding side.
As for the watchers, they never fail to groan.
Still, as I have said, it is now recognised that the craving
for tea is as much a part of the present-day game as the
six-ball over, and the time has passed for censuring it.
But something can be done to regulate it; and I have based
my efforts towards a solution on the argument that, if a
cricketer is not called in from the game to read his tele-
gram, but (as we have all seen so often) the telegram is
taken out to him, surely the precious fluid that he so pas-
sionately desiderates can be taken out to him too. At pre-
sent, therefore, all my thoughts are turned upon the con-
struction of some kind of wheeled waggon, such as is in
use at a well-known restaurant in the Strand, on which
fifteen cups (two for the umpires) and an urn and sugar and
milk can be conveyed, with the concomitant bread-and-
butter, or shrimps or meringues, or whatever is eaten with
the tea, on a lower shelf. This could be pushed on to the
ground at 4.15 and pushed back again at 4.20 without any
serious injury to the match. That is my idea at the
moment; but I am a poor mechanic and should be glad
if some properly qualified person—someone with a HEATH
RobiNSON mind—would take the work over. E. W. L.
IN THE MOVEMENT.
How I came to be able to understand the language of
trees is a secret. But I do understand it. It is my
peculiar privilege to overhear all kinds of whispered con-
versation—green speech in green shades—as I take my
rest underneath the boughs on a country walk. Some day
I shall set down fully the result of these leaves-droppings,
but at the moment I want to tell only of what I heard some
blackberry bushes saying last week.
“From what I hear,” said the first bush, “the cost of
everything's going up by leaps and bounds.”
“How is that 2" asked one of its neighbours.
“It's due, I understand,” the first bush replied, “partly
to scarcity of labour and partly to profiteering.”
“I don't see why we shouldn't participate,” said another
bush. “Here we are, covered with fruit, and it's all just as
free as ever it was. That's absurd, after a big war. The
duty of a war is to make things dearer and remove freedom."
“Of course,” said the others.
“‘Your blackberries will cost you more -—that should be
our motto,” said the first bush. “We must be up to date."
:: :: :: ::: : ::: ::: s:
A few days later, after one of our infrequent post-bellum
gleams of sunshine, I met the Lady of the White House
and all her nice children returning from a day's black-
berrying. They showed me their baskets with a proper
pride, and I was suitably enthusiastic and complimentary.
“But do look at our poor hands and arms and our torn
frocks!" said the lady. “We’ve picked blackberries here
year after year, but we’ve never been so badly scratched
before. It's extraordinary. I can't account for it.”
I could, though.
THE MOON-SELLER.
A MAN came by at night with moons to sell;
“Moons old and new,” he cried ;
I hurried when I heard him call for me;
He set his basket on the wall for me
That I might see inside
And watch the little moons curl up and hide.
Each one he touched rang softly like a bell;
He pointed out to me
Great harvest moons with russet light in them,
Pale moons to gleam where snowsgrow white in them,
Red moons for victory, -
And steadfast moons for men in ships at sea.
The man who came with many moons to sell
Opened his basket wide;
Showed me the filmy crescent moons in it,
And the piled discs (like silver spoons) in it
That push and pull the tide,
And small sweet honey-moons to give a bride.
“This moon,” he said, “you will remember well;
Its price is wealth untold ; ”
Took a camp-moon he vowed he stole for me
And softly wrapped to keep it whole for me.
I heaped his feet with gold;
He changed, and said the moon might not be sold.
Then I was angry that with moons to sell
He thought he had the right
To keep that one. Those who were lent to us
Had written the brief notes they sent to us
When it shone out at night.
I caught it to my heart and held it tight.

THE LANGUAGE DIFFICULTY.
“THE jolly part about an island
where there are no towns and no rail-
ways,” said Willoughby, “is that you
have thrills of excitement as to where
you will sleep next night or eat your
next meal. Now when we land at
Lochrie Bay to-morrow it will be nearly
lunch-time; but shall we get lunch 2"
“I can answer that,” replied Mac-
Fadden, whose grandfather was a Scots-
man, and who was once in Edinburgh
for a week; “the map shows it is only
five miles to Waterfoot, and there's
sure to be an hotel there. Those little
Scots inns are all right.”
“Yes,” chimed in Sylvia, “and very
likely there'll be nothing to eat when
“Not I,” I replied. “You’ve got us
in the muddle, now get us out. Wire
and say it's for to-morrow.”
“And then,” said my practical wife,
“we shall get to-day's hot lunch cold
to-morrow, and a rapacious Scotch-
woman will charge us for it twice
over.”
“I wish you would say ‘Scots,' not
‘Scotch,’” complained MacFadden.
“Sorry, Kiltie,” rejoined Hilda; “and
perhaps one of you two will deal with
the Scots woman.”
“Leave her to me and none of you
interfere,” answered MacFadden. “Wil-
loughby is no good at a job that needs
tact. He's not half as loyable as I am
either. Is he, Molly? We'll send the
wire at once. Come on.”
and answered hastily, “No, I won't!"
at which Willoughby sighed audibly.
“What I wanted to ask you was
whether perhaps you could be so kind
as to give us a bit of bread and cheese
or something," said Mac ingratiatingly.
“Of course one doesn't expect a proper
lunch in these places without ordering
it beforehand.”
“And those that order beforehand
dinna come,” she replied with some as-
perity. “A pairty of six ordered for yes-
terday; then they telegraphs to say
they mean to-day, and now they're no
here and the time lang gone by. I
thocht ye were the pairty at first.” -
“What a shame!” murmured Mac-
Fadden sympathetically.
“Ay, if they had turned up they should
we get there. I am think-
ing of you three men, of
course,” she added hastily;
“we girls don't want
much.”
“As for me,” said Wil- ||
loughby, looking at Syl-
via, whom he has adored
dumbly for years, “very
little satisfies me. I'm
like the fellow who said, “a
crust of bread, a bottle of
wine and you.' You know
the chap, MacFadden.”
“Isn't it wonderful how
he remembers his OMAR 2 ''
remarked Mac enthusias-
tically. -
“I don't know much
poetry,” said Willoughby,
whose tastes are sporting ||
rather than literary, “but
I always liked that bit.”
“But lunch,” I inter-
posed, “is the pressing
question. There's sure to
be an hotel at Waterfoot,
Mistress. “You seen. To HAVE BEEN IN A Good MANY situ ATIons.

hae had their lunch, and
paid for it too,” said the
good lady grimly. “Twa
days they should hae paid
for. But if ye like ye can
eat their lunch for them ;
it's cauld but guid.”
So we ate heartily, paid
reasonably and went away
on good terms with our-
selves and the lady.
Walking up the steep
hill from the hotel I was
just behind Willoughby
and Sylvia. He was push-
ing the two bicycles and
explaining something elab-
orately. -
“Awfully sorry about
that silly woman, Sylvia,”
he said, “but it's only their
rotten way of talking Eng-
lish. You see, when she
says, “Will you be Mrs.
Willoughby?" she really
means, “Are you?'' It's
not the same as when an
as you say. Send a telegram there,
asking for lunch for six. If there's no
hotel, no reply and no lunch. If there
is we get our reply and our lunch.
Willoughby can wire, because he learned
all about telegraphs in the army.”
Within two hours came the reply. I
opened it.
“Will supply luncheon for six, 1.15
to-day.”
“Can you remember what your wire
said, Willoughby 2” I asked mildly.
“Rather. ‘Can you provide lun-
cheon for six at 1.15.-Willoughby.’”
“Exactly. Can't you see, you silly
ass, how you've muffed it? Read this.”
Willoughby read, while Sylvia and
Molly looked over and giggled.
“Hang it all ! I suppose I ought to
have said to-morrow,” he sighed. “Here,
Thompson, you and Hilda, as the mar-
ried couple of the party, ought to deal
with these beastly emergencies.”
Next day the steamer dropped us
into the ferry-boat off Lochrie Bay, and
our bicycles, more frightened than hurt,
but much shaken, were hurled in after
us. After five miles on a primitive
road we arrived at the hotel very late.
MacFadden, assuring us that if we
only kept quiet he would see us through
in spite of any Scots innkeeper, led the
way.
The landlady, a dour woman, ap-
peared.
“Good morning, Madam,” began Mac
politely.
“Will you be Mr. Willoughby 2” she
replied.
“No," said Mac truthfully, assuming
a puzzled expression.
“Weel, then,” resumed the lady, ad-
dressing Sylvia, who happened to be
close behind, “will you be Mrs. Wil-
loughby?”
Molly sniggered; Sylvia reddened
Englishman says it. If I said, ‘Will
you be Mrs. Willoughby 2” that would
be different; it would mean -
“Yes," interrupted Sylvia rather
breathlessly, “that, Tommy dear, would

a plain answer. I should say 1 :

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
REALLY I think that Rhoda Drake (MURRAY) must be the
most preposterously startling story that I have read for
this age. It makes you feel as if you had had a squib
exploded under your chair at a temperance meeting. After
beginning placidly about persons who live in South Ken-
sington (and are so dull that the author has to fill up with
minute descriptions of their drawing-rooms), somewhere
towards three-quarters through its decorous course it
plunges you head over ears into such tearing melodrama
as is comparable only to Episode 42 of “The Adventures
of the Blinking Eye" at a provincial cinema. I am left
asking myself in bewilderment whether Mr. C. H. DUDLEY
WARD, D.S.O., M.C., can have been serious in the affair.
As I say, practically all the early characters are of little
or no account, including Rhoda herself. Indeed, nobody
looks like mattering at all, and the whole tale has, to be
frank, taken on a somewhat soporific aspect, when lo!
there enters a lady with a Russian name, no back to her
gown and green face-powder. If I said of this paragon
that she made the story bounce I should still do less than
justice to her amazing personality. Really, she was a
herald of revolution, whose remarkable method was to
invite anyone important and obstructive to her house and
make them discontented. It was the work of half-an-hour.
Whether the process was hypnotic, or whether she actually
put pepper in the ice-pudding, I could not clearly make out.
But the dreadful fact remained that, let your patriotism be
ever so firm, you had but to accept one of green-powder's
little dinners and next morning you were as like as not to
hurl a stone into 10, Downing Street. As for the end—l
But no, I will stop short of it.
Frankly, what pleased me most about Affinities (HopDER
AND SToughton) was its attractive get-up; pleasant, cherry-
pie-coloured boards, swathed in a very daintily-drawn
pictorial wrapper, the whole, as cataloguers say, forming an
ideal birthday present for a young lady, especially one at all
apt to discover, however harmlessly, the affinities that
give these five tales their title. As for the stories them-
selves, really all that need be said is to congratulate Mrs.
MARY Roberts RINEHART on the ingenuity with which she
can tell what seems an obvious intrigue yet keep a sur-
prise in reserve. I suppose it is because they come to
us from America that certain of the episodes turn upon
incidents in the Suffrage struggle, tale-fodder that our own
militant novelists have long happily discarded. Of the
others I think I myself would award the palm to one
called “The Family Friend,” a genially cynical little comedy
of encouraged courtship, of which the end seems to be
visible from the beginning, but isn't. Altogether, what I
might call a Canute; in other words a book for the deck-
chair, not too absorbing to endanger your shoes, however
close you read it to the advancing wave.

I think I should best describe the characteristic quality
of Four Blind Mice (LANE) as geniality. The scene of it
is Burmah—astonishing, when you consider the host of
novels about the rest of India, that so few should employ
this equally picturesque setting—and it is quickly appar-
ent that what Mr. C. C. Low Is doesn't know at first hand
about Rangoon is not likely to be missed. The tale itself is
a good-humoured little comedy of European and native
intrigue, showing how one section of the populace strove
as usual to ease the white man's burden by flirtation and
gossip, and the other to get the best for themselves by un-
limited roguery and chicane. The whole thing culminates in
a trial scene which is at once a delightful entertainment and
(I should suppose) a shrewdly observed study of the course
of Anglo-Burmese justice. I think I would have chosen
that Mr. Lowis should base his fun on something a little
less grim than the murder and mutilation of a European,
a bare chronicle of names and places. Undoubtedly his book
should be read with great deliberation, constant reference
to the maps and a lively recollection of personal experiences
on the spot; but the civilian reader may still be content
to skim the text and save himself for the photographs.
These, mostly taken from the air and of exquisite technical
quality, form an amazing series, in themselves worth the
heavy price. And who minds heavy prices when the pro-
ceeds are pledged to the service of wounded officers?
“Rather an anti-climax,” I thought when I opened The
Happy Foreigner (HEINEMANN) and found that it purported
to tell the experiences of an English chauffeuse in France
after the Armistice; but I know now that, in any place
where ENID BAGNoLD happened to be, there would not be
any anti-climax about. In a style so daring and vivid that

The Story of the Fourth Army in the Battles of the Hun-
dred Days (Hodder AND STOUGHToN) is printed on pages
the size of a copy of Punch, and with its accompanying case
of maps it costs eighteen-pence to go through the post. It
boasts a hundred full-page photographs, also sketches,
charts, maps, panoramas and diagrams ad lib., a foreword
by General Lord RAWLINSON and ten appendices; so really
it seems that the much-abused word “sumptuous” may for
once be fairly applied. The author, Major-General Sir A.
MontgoMERY, who himself helped to “stage” the battles he
writes about, has built up a record which is in some sense
unique, for I think it is possible from this book to trace
precisely where any unit of the Fourth Army was placed, and
what doing, at any given hour during the whole of the victory
march from Amiens to the Belgian frontier. Apart from any-
thing else it is pleasant to have a book that deals only with
the days of victory; but it must be admitted that, to gain a
completeness of detail so entirely satisfactory to those most
nearly concerned, the writer has had to sacrifice something
of human interest, for many of his pages are little more than
the rebuilding of his fortunes. This book is not “about
the War,” but all the same it is one of the best books
about the War that I have read.
From a Common Room Window (OweN) will be a slight
refreshment to those who are weary of realistic studies of
schoolmasters and schoolboys. “ORBILIUs,” during what
I take to have been a long career as a teacher, has not
allowed his sense of humour to wither within him. In a
note to his slender volume of sketches he says, “School-life
is largely a comedy. When a schoolmaster ceases to recog-
nise this it is time for him to “bundle and go.’” He has
been in the main a keen and sympathetic observer, and
though his remarks upon headmasters are a little severe—
personally I should hate to be called “a meticulous peda-
gogue"—I do not think that a little criticism of these poten-
tates will do them the smallest harm. In “The Castigator”
“ORBILIUs" gives a laughable sketch. The inventor of a
flogging machine is soundly beaten by his own instru-
ment, and he would be a sombre man indeed who could
read it without a desire to witness such a chastening per-
formance. By no means the least merit of this book is
that it contains no new theories about education.

THE ASHES.
[A final salutation to the M.C.C. team, from one who is destined to
perish in the event of a coal strike.] º
O SHIP that farest forth, a greater Argo,
- Unto the homeland of the woolly fleece,
Soft gales attend thee! may thy precious cargo
Slide over oceans smoothed of every crease,
So as the very flower, or pick,
Of England's flanneled chivalry may not be sickl
And thou, O gentle goddess Hygieia,
Hover propitious o'er the vessel's poop ;
Keep them from chicken-pox and pyorrhoea,
Measles and nettle-rash and mumps and croup;
See they digest their food and drink,
And land them, even as they leave us, in the pink
Thou, too, whose favour they depend so much on
(Fortune, I mean) in this precarious game,
Oh let there be no blob on their escutcheon,
Or, if a few occur, accept the blame;
Do not, of course, abuse thy powers;
We'd have the best side win, but let that side be ours.
Summer awaits them there while we are wheezing
By empty hearths through bitter days and black;
Yet we rejoice that, though we die of freezing
And cannot get cremated, all for lack
Of coal to feed our funeral pyres,
Still “in our ashes [yonder] live their wonted fires.”

THE MINISTRY OF ANCESTRY.
“As you are aware,” said a prominent official of the
Ministry of Ancestry, “although our department has only
been in existence for a few months the profits have enabled
the Government to take twopence off the income-tax and
to provide employment for thousands of deserving clerks
dismissed, in deference to public opinion, from other Gov-
ernment offices.” - -
“Yes. Could you tell me how this brilliant scheme came
‘into being 2"
“The Chinese knew and practised it for centuries. Here
the credit for its re-discovery must be assigned to Sir
Cuthbert Shover, who, owing to handsome contributions
to necessary funds, combined, of course, with meritorious
public service during the War, was offered a baronetcy.
He refused it for himself, but accepted it for his aged
father, thereby becoming second baronet in three months.
He deplored the fact that his grandfather was no longer
eligible for the honour. Then we saw light. Why should
the mere accident of death prevent us from honouring a
man if his family were prepared to contribute towards the
country's exchequer 2 But these letters will give you a
clearer insight into the working of the department.”
The first letter was addressed to Miss Cannon, at Maid-
Stone :-
“DEAR MADAM, We have no hesitation in advising you
to have a bishop in your family. Few purchases give greater
satisfaction. If, as you say, your late maternal grand-
father was curate of Slowden, and was, as far as you are
aware, a man of exemplary character, we could make him
a bishop without delay. Your home being in Kent, it
occurs to us that the see of Carlisle would suit the Right
Reverend Prelate best. The cost of the proceedings, in-
cluding a pre-dated Congé d'Elire, would be eight hundred
guineas. An archbishopric would be slightly more expen-
sive and, in our opinion, less suitable.”
“Amazing,” I said.
“But so simple. Here is a letter from a man who
wants to have had forbears in the Navy. We say:—
“Naturally it would have been an advantage for your
son, whom you destine for the Navy, to have had rela-
tions in that service. But it is not too late to remedy
this defect.
“‘By virtue of the powers conferred upon us by Act of
Parliament (Ancestry Act, 1922), we are prepared to give
your sometime great-great-uncle William, who, according
to family tradition, always wanted to go to sea, a com-
mission in the Navy, and the rank of lieutenant, together
with appointment to any ship of the line—with the exception
of the Victory—which fought under Lord NELsoN. The
making out the commission will be put in hand on the
receipt of your cheque for three hundred guineas.’”
“Do you always give satisfaction ?”
“Occasionally we have to disappoint people.
instance, this letter to a lady at Plymouth:=
“‘We feat we cannot grant your request to reserve a
berth on the Mayflower for your delightful ancestress, Mrs.
Patience Loveday. The Mayflower is already overcrowded,
and, owing to some ill-feeling raised in America, we decided
to resign all interest in the vessel. Should you desire
some other form of Puritan distinction how would you like
to provide yourself with a non-juring clergyman as an
ancestor? We could present any suitable departed member
of your family to a Crown living, and supply you with an
order of ejectment, dated the anniversary of St. Bartholo-
mew's Day, 1662.’” -
“Judging from the address on this letter, X. O'Finny,
Esq.,' your jurisdiction extends to Ireland 2"
“Yes, Mr. O'Finny wants some persecuted ancestors.
We offer to supply him with a member of his family con-
demned to be beheaded by order of QUEEN ELIZABETH,
price one thousand, which includes a replica of the Great
Seal of England; or, to have another member shot by
order of CROMwFLL, at half the price; or a sentence of
hanging in '98. This would be three hundred only. We
advise him to take the complete set at a reduction, and
have no doubt we shall come to terms.”
“Have you anything more expensive?” I asked timidly.
“Rather. Here is our answer to Lord–better not give
the name, perhaps; the creation is recent. He wished for
a Crusader, but we explained that the Crusades were not
under Government. We offer to introduce his family name
into our authorised supplement to the Domesday Book for
five thousand pounds. I call it cheap at the money. Now
what can we do for you?”
“I must think it over,” I stammered.
“Do. You will come back. Pair of Colours, now, for
a great-great-grandfather. How would that suit you ?
Only five hundred. Or a place at Court in the Regency 2
Or, if you wish good business connection, a directorship
of the East India Company 2 The whole of the past lies
before you. Give your children a fair start in life, that is
what we say. Money is good, education is better, but
distinguished ancestry is best of all.”

Horrified Sister (to small artist). “MABEL, You 'RE surely NoT sucKING Your BRUSH when You 'RE PAINTING TOADSTools?”
KINGS AND QUEENS.
THERE are thirty-six of them in
all, ranging from WILLIAM I., who is
“severe,” toVICTORIA,who is just “good.”
I first made their acquaintance in child-
hood, when my grandmother gave them
me with the laudable object of teaching
me history. Each is a little wooden
block signifying a monarch. On one
side there is a portrait showing the face,
collar and upper portion of torso of the
monarch in question; on the other side
there is written a single word summing
up his whole character.
By means of these royal blocks I was
brought up to a sound historical sense
based on religion and morality. At the
age of seven I could and did boast that
I knew the innermost souls of all the
monarchs of England. I could say their
dates by heart, often doing so during
sermon time on Sundays, with a grace
and ease that only lifelong acquaintance
with royalty could have bred. I was
even able to triumph through that
tricky period between the death of ED-
wARD III. and the accession of ELIZA-
BETH, I wonder if the late Lord AcToN
was as learned at that age: I am sure
he could not say his dates backwards.
I could.
It has always surprised those who
have endeavoured to teach me history
that my youthful brain should be so
strongly grounded in the historical tra-
dition of over half a century ago. Yet
all the historians of modern England
could not shake me in my faith. To me
QUEEN VICTORIA was no “panting little
German widow,” as our latest searcher
after truth has affirmed, but the august
lady who listened entranced to the
beautifur poems of Lord TENNYsoN and
invented electricity and the tricycle.
In consequence I was considered a
counter-revolutionary, if not bourgeois.
My essays were deemed dangerously re-
actionary. At Oxford I once found my
tutor burning one. This shows the
value the authorities attach to my work.
It is too dangerous to live; it is burnt.
I venture to think, however, that my
work, based as it is on the most respect-
able principles, will survive long after
my tutors have subsided into a perma-
nent state of death in life. Like SHAK-
speARE and the present Government I
am for all time.
It is easy to see how I came to ac-
quire this stability of thought, owing
as I do my early training to the kings
and queens of England, who are nothing
if not stable. They are my acknowledged
guardians and to them I turn in all
difficulties. Only a year ago they came
to my aid in a most awkward predica-
ment. It was my lot to fill up army
forms; of what variety I cannot re-
member save that they were of a jaun-
dicy colour and connected with the
men's demobilisation. On these docu-
ments I was expected to enter, besides
the usual details as to religion and
connubial felicity, the character of each
man in a single word. I at once mar-
shalled my wooden royalties before me
in chronological order and proceeded to
deal with the squadron in rotation.
The first name on my list was that of
the disciplinary sergeant-major. It was
with a glow of pride that I registered
him with WILLIAM I. as “severe.” The
designation of Tonks, the Mess waiter
(whom we had discovered on the night
the bomb fell on the aerodrome making
a home and a house of defence in the
cookhouse stove), as “heroic" was dis-
tinctly happy. It was perhaps unfor-
tunate that the quartermaster-sergeant,
an austere man from Renfrew, should
have found, on perusing his demobilisa-
tion card, that he was to be handed
down to posterity as “avaricious.” I
was also sorry to find the padre, usually
so broad-minded, in a nasty temper
about the character given to his bat-
man, who was, he assured me, the only
pious man in the squadron and in
private life a dissenting minister. “Dis-
solute" certainly was on the face of
things inappropriate, but then it was

no fault of mine that the merriest of
English monarchs should have appeared
at the moment when I was filling up
the papers of a minister of religion.
The light that my wooden monarchs
throw on history is both interesting
and, to a modern, precious. For in-
stance, the designation of the first
Angevin king as “patriotic” will sur-
g. many readers of the late Bishop
TUBBs. “Patriotic” is a wide term and
may be applied to almost anything from .
after-dinner flag-wagging to successful
juggling with Colonial stocks and shares;
yet there are few who would have de-
scribed it as the besetting virtue of
HENRY I. But it was; his little block
says so. -
John, again, was “mean.” I am sorry,
for, though in some respects blame-
worthy, he had many agreeable traits.
His views on the honesty of his baron-
age are most entertaining. He was
something of a wit, a good judge of food
and wine, and would have made an ex-
cellent Fellow of an Oxford college. It is
much to be regretted that he was mean.
Poor HENRY WI. is “silly.” This is
a hard judgment on the pioneer of the
movement against low backs in evening
frocks, but doubtless he was silly in
other things.
Some of my monarchs had the most
excellent characters. Edward I. was
“just,” GEoRGE IV.“courteous,”OLIVER
CRoMwell, “noble"—a sad blow for
the White Rose Club. Our younger
monarchs were particularly attractive
persons, and it is a pity that they did
not live long enough to display their
qualities. Edward VI. was “amiable,”
while Edward W., like all with expecta-
tions from their uncle, was “hopeful.”
Poor child ! he had need to be.
I am pained however that CHARLEs II.
was “dissolute.” It was what HENRY
VIII. dissolved the monasteries for
being—the impertinent old polygamist!
For my part I love CHARLEs for the
affection that he bore little dogs, for
the chance saying on Sussex hills that
this England was a country well worth
fighting for. Alas! that he should have
been dissolute.
Best of all my friends is GEORGE III.
He is portrayed with a jolly red nose
and a mouth that positively yawns for
pudding. His character, which is his
chief glory, is “benevolent.” Who
would not rejoice to have been the ob-
ject of his regal philanthropy 2 SAMUEL
Johnson himself did not hesitate to ac-
cept the bounty of this kindly monarch,
though, while his predecessor reigned,
the great lexicographer had defined a
pensioner as “a state hirelmg” paid
“for treason to his country.”
Such are my friends the kings and
queens of England. Happy the child

who has such majesty to be his guardian
spirit. To him life will be a pomp, where
vulgar democracy can have no part, and
death a trysting-place with old comrades
—the child for whom
“The kings of England, lifting up their swords,
Shall gather at the gates of Paradise.”
A HOME FROM HOME.
(An actual incident.)
My fancy sought no English field,
What time my holiday drew near;
I felt no fond desire to wield
The shrimping net of yesteryear;
I found it easy to eschew
All wish to hear a pierrot stating
His lust to learn the rendezvous
Of flies engaged in hibernating.
Beyond the Channel I would range
(I called it “cross the rolling main")
And there achieve the thorough
change
Demanded by my jaded brain;
It might be that an alien clime
Would jog a failing inspiration,
Buck up a bard and render rhyme
Less difficult of excavation.
A thorough change? Ah, barren quest,
Foredoomed to fail ere half begun
Though left behind, my England
pressed
In hot pursuit of me, her son;
London was brought again to view
By hordes of maidens out for pillage,
When from the train I stepped into
A flag day in an Alpine village.

WIRE AND BARBED WIRE.
THIs was the telegram that, after
much hesitation, I had written out at
the side desk in the post-office and
carried to the main desk to despatch —
Pactolus, London.
St. Vitus carburetter stammer tyre scream
Sanguine.
You will observe that it is unintellig-
ible. Decoded, it meant that I, whose
betting pseudonym is Sanguine, wished
to invest with Messrs. Lure, commis-
sion agents (not bookmakers, no, not
for a moment), whose telegraphic ad-
dress is “Pactolus, London,” a sum of ten
pounds (carburetter) on a horse called
St. Vitus to win (stammer), and twenty
pounds (tyre) for a place (scream). I
had done this for various reasons, none
really #." but chiefly because every
paper that I had opened had urged me
to do so, some even going so far as to
dangle a double before me with St. Vitus
as one of the horses. Nearly all had
described St. Vitus as a nap, setting
up the name not only in capitals but
with a faithful asterisk beside it.
Having an account with Messrs. Lure
and a liking now and then to indulge
in a little flutter over a gee (I am choos-
ing my words very º I had
decided, after weighing the claims of
all the other runners, to take the advice
of the majority and back the favourite,
although favourites acclaimed with stri-
dency by the racing experts of the Press
in unison have, I knew, a way of fail-
ing. In betting on races, however,
there are two elements that are never
lacking : hope against hope and an
incomplete recollection of the past.
Having written out the telegram I
took it to the main counter, to the sec-
tion labelled “Telegrams,” and slipped
it under the grating towards the young
woman, who, however, instead of deal-
ing with it, continued to tell an adjacent
young woman about the arrangements
that she and a friend had made for their
forthcoming holidays at Herne Bay.
The nature of those who have little
flutters on gees is complex. The ordin-
ary man, having written out his tele-
gram, on whatever subject it may be
—whether it announces that he will
arrive before lunch and bring his clubs
with him, or . that, having important
business to detain him at the office, he
will not be home to dinner—gets it
through as soon as possible. He may
be delayed by the telegraph girl's de-
tachment, but he would not be deterred.
He would still send the telegram. But
those who bet are different. They are
minutely sensitive to outside occur-
rences; always seeking signs and in-
terpreting them as favourable or un-
favourable as the case may be ; and
refraining from doing anything so de-
cisive as to call the girl to order. Their
game is to be plastic under the fingers
of chance; the faintest breath of dubiety
can sway them. I had been in so man
minds about this thirty pound bet, whic
I could not really afford, that there was
therefore nothing for it, after waiting
the two minutes that seemed to be
ten, but to tear up the message, in the
belief that the friendly gods again had
intervened. For luck is as much an
affair of refraining as of rushing in.
I therefore withdrew quietly from
the conversation and scattered the
little bits on the floor as I did so. But
I did not leave the office. Instead, I
went to the side desk again and wrote
another telegram, which, with the neces-
sary money (an awful lot), I pushed
through the grating, where the girls
were still talking. My second tele-
‘gram had no reference to horses—I
had done with gambling for the day—
but ran thus:—
Postmaster-General, London.
Suggest you remind telegraph clerk on duty
at this hour at this post-office that she per-
haps talks a shade too much about Herne Bay
and gives public too little consideration.
The girl, having ceased her chatter,
took the telegram and began feverishly
to count the words. Then her tapping
pencil slowed down and her brows con-
tracted; she was assimilating their
meaning. Then, with a blush, and a
very becoming one, she looked at me
with an expression of distress and said,
“Do you really want this to go?”
“No,” I said, withdrawing the money.
“I’m sorry I was not more atten-
tive,” she said. -
“That's all right,” I replied. “Tear
it up.”
And I came away, feeling, with a
certain glow of satisfaction not unmixed
with self-righteousness, that I had done
something to raise the post-office stand-
ard and to ensure better attention. But
the joke is that, if I had myself received
better attention, I should have lost
thirty pounds, for St. Vitus was un-
placed. This story must therefore re-
main without a moral. E. W. L.

Of murder and of arson.

I hold no brief for SMILLIE
Or for the miners' claims;
I disapprove most highly
Of many of their aims;
But when I see the Wizard
Enthroned in Asquith's stead,
It cuts me to the gizzard
And dyes my vision Red.
I hold no brief for madmen
On revolution bent,
For bitter or for bad men
On anarchy intent;

To foster and to prop them

THE HANDY MAN.
THE men I most admire at the pre-
sent time, though I take care not to tell
them so to their faces, are the men who
can do everything. By this I don't
mean people of huge intellectual attain-
ments, like Cabinet Ministers, or tre-
mendous physical powers, like Tarzan
of the Apes. It must be very nice to
be able to have a heart-to-heart talk
with KRASSIN or to write articles for
the Sunday picture-papers, and very
nice also to swing rapidly through the
tree-tops, say, in Eaton Square; but
none of these gifts is much help when
the door-handle comes off. I hate that
sort of thing to happen in a house.
In the Victorian age, of course, which
door, and he came in and pointed this
out. “It is not much use having elec-
tric-bells,” he said, “that don't ring.”
I might have argued this point. I
might have said that to press the button
of a bell that does not ring gives one
time to reflect on whether one really
wants the thing one rang for, and,
thereafter on the whole vanity of human
wishes, and so inculcates patience and
self-discipline. It is quite possible that
an Eastern yogi might spend many
years of beneficial calm pressing the
buttons of bells that do not ring. But
I replied rather weakly, “No, I sup-
pose not.” º -
“I’ll soon put that right for you,”
he said cheerily, and about five minutes
later he asked me to press one of the
the kitchen were blunt and went and
fetched some kind of private grindstone
and sharpened them, and then told me
that the apple-trees ought to be grease-
banded, which I thought was a thing
one only did to engines. And, when he
had brought a hammer and some nails
and put together a large bookcase which
had collapsed as soon as The Outline of
History was put on to it (I should like
to know whether Canon BARNEs can
explain that), I was obliged to ask him
to stop, in case the tramping men
should see him and strike immediately
for fear of the dilution of labour.
But what impressed me most was
the part he took next day in the Rail-
way Carriage Conference, which curi-
ously enough was on the subject of
was one of specialisa-
tion based upon peace
and plenty, one simply
sent for a door-handle
replacer and he put it
right. But nowadays
the Door - handle Re-
placers' Union is pro-
bably affiliated to an
amalgamation which is
discussing sympathetic
action with somebody
who is striking, so no-
thing is done. This
means that for weeks
and weeks, whenever
one tries to go out of
the room, there is a loud
crash like a 9-2 on the
further side and a large
blunt dagger clutched
melodramatically in the
right hand, and nobody

strikes. There were
several people in the
carriage, and they were
talking about what they
had done during the
railway strike last year,
and what they would
do if such a thing hap-
pened again. I said I
should like to be a
station-master if poss-
ible, because they had
top-hats and grew such
beautiful flowers. Only
four or five trains seem
to stop at our station
during the day, and if
there was a strike I
suppose the number
would be reduced to
one or two. And I
thought it would be
rather nice to spend
the day wearing a top-
hat and watering the
nasturtiums in the little
rock - gardens behind
a thing like a broken door-handle as
soon as look at it. He always knows
which of the funny things you push or
pull on any kind of machine to make it
go or stop, and what is wrong with the
cistern and the drawing-room clock.
Such a man came into my house the
other day. I call it my house, but it
really seems to belong to a number of
large people who walk in and out and
shift packing-cases and splash paint
and tramp heavily into the bathroom
about 8.30 A.M. when I am trying to get
off to sleep. They have also dug a
large moat right through the lawn and
the garden-path, which rather spoils
the appearance of these places, though
it is nice to be able to pull up the draw-
bridge at night and feel that one is safe
from burglars. Anyhow, whether it is
my house or theirs, the fact remains
that the electric-bells were wrong. The
man of whom I am speaking lives next-
buttons, and there was a loud tinkling
noise. It seemed a pity that at the
moment when the bell did happen to
ring there should be nobody to come
and answer it.
“Whatever did you do to them 2 "I
asked.
“It only needed a little water,” he
said, and I had hard work to suppress
my admiration. The very morning
before, feeling that I ought to take a
hand in all this practical work that was
going on about the place, I had filled
a large watering-can that I found lying
about and wetted some things which
someone had stuck into the garden. I
have a kind of idea that they were
carrots, but they may have been maiden-
hair ferns. Somehow it had never
occurred to me for a moment to go and
water the electric bells.
Almost immediately afterwards this
man discovered that all the knives in
the platform. Watering, I said, was
quite easy when once one got into the
swing of it.
But the man who could do everything
seemed to know everything too, and he
told me that station-masters were much
too noble to strike. There were two
kinds of station-masters, he said, both
wearing top-hats, but one kind with
full morning-dress underneath it and
the other with uniform. But neither
kind struck.
Slightly nettled at his superior know-
ledge, I asked him, “What did you do
during the Great Strike?”
“Oh, I had rather fun,” he said;
“I controlled the signals at London
Bridge.”
If all the truth were known I expect
that he is quite ready for Mr. SMILLIE's
strike; that he has a handy little pick
in his bedroom and knows of rather a
jolly little coal-mine close by. EvoB.

The Woman. “I Do wish You Two would walk ProPERLY.”
FLOWERS' NAMES,
- Fool's PARSLEY. .
IN the village of Picking's Pool
Lived Theobald, the village fool;
He had been simple from his birth
But kindly as the simple earth,
And in his heart he sang a song
Of “Ave, Mary" all day long.
On Good Friday the people came
To honour the rood of Christ His shame;
They scattered flowers and leaves and
In OSS
About the foot of the humble cross
And, when they knelt and prayed and
wailed,
Theobald saw the Mother, veiled
And bowed in a mother's agony.
“She suffers more than the Christ,”
said he.
Theobald searched the fields and lanes
To find a solace for MARY's pains:
All the flowers were plucked and gone
Save a little dull Parsley, sere and wan;
And Theobald wreathed it in simple
guise; -
“It mourns like her,'
made wise.
said the Fool
When Holy Saturday morning broke
Back to the shrine went the village folk;
And lo! on the weeping Mother's brow
A chaplet of flowers was gleaming now;
And Theobald smiled secretly
To think he had soothed her agony.
And ever since Theobald crowned his
Queen
Fool's Parsley has flowered amongst
its green.
HEADGEAR FOR HEROES.
A contemporary, having heard of the hat
specially designed for M. CLEMENCEAU, has
decided that the bowler, the topper, the Hom-
burg, the straw, the cloth cap and all other
styles at present more or less in vogue leave
much to be desired, and has therefore inaugu-
rated a search for the ideal male headdress.]
The SMILLIE.—A Phrygian model,
executed in red Russia leather. Special
features are the asbestos lining, the
steam vents and the water-jacket, which
combine to minimise the natural heat
of the head. Embellished with an her-
aldic cock's-comb gules, it is a striking
conception.
THE PREMIER.—A semi-Tyrolean type
in resilient chamois, which can be
readily converted to any desired shape,
with or without extra stiffening. Its
adaptability and the patent sound-proof
ear-flaps make it particularly suitable
for travellers. . Detachable edelweiss
and leek trimming. -
THE ERic.—An adaptation of the
cap of maintenance in a special elastic
material, warranted not to burst under
pressure of abnormal expansion of the
head of the wearer. Practically fool-
proof.
THE WINNIE.-A fore-and-aft derived
from a French model of the First Em-
pire period, the severity of which is
mitigated by the addition of little bells.
A novelty is the mouthpiece in the
crown, which enables the hat to be
used as a megaphone at need. An
elastic loop holds a fountain-pen in
position. The whole to be worn on a
head several sizes too big for it.
THE CoNAN.—A straw bonnet of bee-
hive shape. Medium weight. In a
diversity of shades. The special pug-
garee of goblin blue material is designed
to protect the wearer from moonstroke
without obscuring the vision.
THE WARNER.—An easy-fitting crown
carried out in harlequin -flannel sur-
mounts a full brim of restful willow-
green. Garnished with intertwined
laurel and St. John's-Wort, and decor-
ated with the tail feather of a Surrey
fowl, it makes a comfortable and dis-
tinguished headdress for a middle-aged
gentleman.

John (very virtuously). “PINcHLNG."
A SHIP IN A BOTTLE.
IN a sailormen's restaurant Rotherhithe way,
Where the din of the docksides is loud all the day,
And the breezes come bringing off basin and pond
And all the piled acres of lumber beyond
From the Oregon ranges the tang of the pine -
And the breath of the Baltic as bracing as wine,
In a fly-spotted window I there did behold,
Among the stale odours of hot food and cold,
A ship in a bottle some sailor had made -
In watches below, swinging South with the Trade,
When the fellows were patching old dungaree suits,
Or mending up oilskins and leaky seaboots,
Or whittling a model or painting a chest,
Or yarning and smoking and watching the rest.
In fancy I saw him all weathered and browned,
Deep crows'-feet and wrinkles his eyelids around;
A pipe in the teeth that seemed little the worse
For Liverpool pantiles and stringy salt-horse;
The hairy forearm with its gaudy tattoo -
Of a bold-looking female in scarlet and blue; -
The fingers all roughened and toughened and scarred,
With hauling and hoisting so calloused and hard,
So crooked and stiff you would wonder that still
They could handle with cunning and fashion with skill
The tiny full-rigger predestined to ride
To its cable of thread on its green-painted tide
In its wine-bottle world, while the old world went on
And the sailor who made it was long ago gone.
And still as he worked at the toy on his knee
He would spin his old yarns of the ships and the sea,
Thermopylae, Lightning, Lothair and Red Jacket,
With many another such famous old packet,
And many a bucko and dare-devil'skipper
In Liverpool blood-boat or Colonies' clipper;
The sail that they carried aboard the Black Ball,
Their skysails and stunsails and ringtail and all,
And storms that they weathered and races they won
And records they broke in the days that are done.
Or sometimes he'd sing you some droning old song,
Some old sailors' ditty both mournful and long,
With queer little curlycues, twiddles and quavers,
Of smugglers and privateers, pirates and slavers,
“The brave female smuggler,” the “packet of fame
That sails from New York and the Dreadnought 's her
name,” - -
And “all on the coast of the High Barbaree,"
And “the flash girls of London was the downfall of he.”
In fancy I listened, in fancy could hear
The thrum of the shrouds and the creak of the gear,
The patter of reef-points on topsails a-shiver,
The song of the jibs when they tauten and quiver, s
The cry of the frigate-bird following after,
The bow-wave that broke with a gurgle like laughter.
And I looked on my youth with its pleasure and pain,
And the shipmate I loved was beside me again.
In a ship in a bottle a-sailing away
In the flying-fish weather through rainbows of spray,
Over oceans of wonder by headlands of gleam,
To the harbours of Youth on the wind of a dream.

THE BEN AND THE BOOT.
WHITHER in these littered and over-
crowded islands should one flee to
escape the spectacle of outworn and
discarded boots? I should go to a
mountain-top and amongst mountain-
tops I should choose the highest. I
should scale the summit of Ben Nevis.
Yet it is but a few days since I saw
on that proud eminence the unmistak-
able remains of an ordinary walking
boot.
It reposed on the perilous edge of a
snowdrift that even in summer curves
giddily over the lip of the dreadful gulf
over which the eastern precipice beetles.
There is ever a certain pathos about
discarded articles of apparel : a baby's
outgrown shoe, a girl's forgotten glove,
an abandoned bowler; but the situation
of this boot, thus high uplifted towards
the eternal stars, gave to it a mystery,
a grandeur, a sublimity that held me
long in contemplation.
How came it there 2
The path that winds up that grey
mountain is rough ; its harsh stones
and remorseless gradients take toll of
leather as of flesh. Yet half a sole and
a sound upper are better than no boot,
and what climber but would postpone
till after his descent the discarding of
his damaged footgear?
Could it be, I asked myself, the relic
and evidence of an inhuman crime?
Was it possible that some party of
climbers, arriving at the top lunchless
and desperately hungry, had sacrificed
their plumpest, disposing of his clothes
over the cliff, but failing to hole out
with this tell-tale boot ?
But no, I bethought me of the price
of leather. They would have reserved
the boots, even at the risk of suspicion.
Moreover, no one would ever reach
that exacting altitude in a state of
succulence.
A glow of sympathy, a thrill of ap-
preciation swept through me as I real-
ised what was at once the worthiest
and the likeliest explanation.
Who shall plumb the depths of the
affection of a true pedestrian for his
boots, the companions and comfort of
so many a pilgrimage? Who but the
climber, the hill-tramp, knows the pang
of regret with which he faces at last
the truth that his favourite boots are
past repair, the sorrow and self-re-
proach with which he permits them to
be consigned to Erebus 2
I saw it all. As the Roman veteran
hung upon the temple wall of Mars the
arms he might no longer wield, so
hither came some lofty-minded climber,
bearing in devoted hands his outworn
and faithful boot, to leave it sadly and
with reverence in this most worthy
resting-place, here to repose at the end
of all the roads it had trod, on the
highest of all the native hills it had
climbed. W. K. H.

How odd it is that our Papas
Keep taking us to cinemas,
But still expect the same old scares,
The tiger-cats, the woolly bears,
The lions on the nursery stairs
To frighten as of old !
Considering everybody knows
A girl can throttle one of those
While choking with the other hand
The captain of a robber band,
They leave one pretty cold.
The lion has no status now;
One has one's terrors, I'll allow,
The centipede, perhaps the cow,
But nothing in the Zoo;
The things that wriggle, jump or
crawl,
The things that climb about the wall,
And I know what is worst of all—
It is the earwig–ugh!
The earwig's face is far from kind ;
He must have got a spiteful mind:
The pincers which he wears behind
Are poisonous, of course;
And Nanny knew a dreadful one
Which bit a gentleman for fun
And terrified a horse.
He is extremely swift and slim,
And if you try to tread on him
He scuttles up the path;
He goes and burrows in your sponge
And takes one wild terrific plunge
When you are in the bath;
Or else—and this is simply foul—
He gets into a mice hot towel
And waits till you are dried,
And then, when Nanny does your
€al'S,
He wrrriggles in and disappears:
He stays in there for years and years
And crprawls about inside.
At last, if you are still alive,
A lot of baby ones arrive;
But probably you've died.
How inconvenient it must be
There isn't any way, you see,
To get him out again ;
So, when you want to frighten me
Or really give me pain,
Please don't go on about that bear
And all those burglars on the stair;
I shouldn't turn a tiny hair
At such Victorian stuff:
You only have to say instead,
“THERE IS AN EARwig IN You R BEd,”
And that will be enough.

MY RIGHT-HAND MAN.
ON glancing the other day through
the only human column of my news-
paper—that headed “Personal”—I was
much intrigued by the advertisement
of a gentleman who styled himself a
“busy commercial magnate,” and who
announced his urgent need of a “right-
hand man.” The duties of the post
were not particularised, but their im-
portance was made clear by the state-
ment that “any salary within reason."
would be paid to a really suitable person.
No, I did not think of applying for
the post myself; a twelve months'
adjutancy to a dyspeptic Colonel had
long cured me of the desire to bottle-
wash for anyone again, however lavish
the remuneration. But, I thought to
myself, it must evidently be a profitable
notion to employ a right-hand man, or
why should this magnate person be so
airy on the subject of salary? Would
it not then payme to engage somebody
in a similar capacity? Increased pro-
duction, in spite of Trade Union econo-
mics, is emphatically a need of the
moment. With a right-hand man at
my right hand (when he wasn't at
my left) I could, I felt sure, increase

my own output enormously; and I
began to plan out my daily work under
the reconstruction scheme.
I will call him “Snaggs”; that will
save me the trouble of having to write
“my right-hand man” every time I
want to refer to him; but when he
enters my service such economy of
labour will not, of course, be necessary.
Snaggs, then, will arrive punctually at
nine every morning—no, on second
thoughts he will sleep in, in case an
inspiration that needs recording arrives
after I have gone to bed. (I shrink
from estimating how much wealth I
have lost through going to sleep on my
nocturnal inspirations, which the most
thorough search next morning never
avails to recapture; but a speaking-
tube, with alarm attachment, running
into Snaggs's room will alter all that.)
His first duty of the day will be to
wade through all the newspapers and
cut out any paragraphs that may serve
as pegs for an article or a set of verses.
My own difficulty in this respect has
always been that I can never manage to
get through more than one paper in a
working morning, and not all of that ;
invariably my attention gets caught by
some long and instructive but (for my
purposes) hopelessly unsuggestive dis-
sertation on Pedigree Pigs or The Co-
operative Movement in Lower Papua,
and I consequently overlook many of
those inspiring little “stories” that in-
form us, for example, that a disting-
uished physician advocates the use of
tomato-sauce as a hair-restorer.
By the timre I have finished break-
fast, I reckon, Snaggs will have found
me subjects for at least a dozen effu-
sions, neatly arranged with a few
skeleton suggestions for the treatment
of each. I shall first decide which are
to be handled in prose and which in
verse, and in the case of the latter shall
jot down a few words and phrases that
will obviously have to be dragged in as
line-endings. Then I shall put Snaggs
on to the purely mechanical drudgery
of finding all the possible rhymes to
these words (e.g., fascinate, assassinate,
pro-Krassinate—you know the sort of
thing that's called for), and by the
time he has catalogued them all I
shall have dashed off most of the prose
articles, which Snaggs will then pro-
ceed to type while I am engaged in
the comparatively simple task of piec-
ing together the verse jigsaws. In this
way I should easily be able to earn an
ordinary week's takings in a morning.
The next task will be the placing of
this material, and that is how Snaggs's
afternoons will be spent. I have always
had an unnecessarily tender feeling for
editors, and often, after laboriously giv-
ing birth to an article, have concealed

it in a drawer rather than run the risk
of boring anyone with its perusal.
Snaggs, however, will be fashioned of
more pachydermatous material and will
daily make himself such a nuisance that
they'll give him an order, and possibly
a long contract, to get rid of him. Dy
a proper system of book-keeping he
will also save me from the occasional
blunder of sending the same article to
the same paper twice.
My wife, to whom I have submitted
this brain-wave, says that the first job
to employ Snaggs on will be calling on
the Bank Manager to arrange about
the overdraft which neither of us has
so far had the courage to moot. But
that, I am afraid, would inspire him
with foolish doubts as to the stability
of his princely salary. Perhaps it will
be best if, before actually engaging
Snaggs, I convert myself into a limited
company, “for the purpose of acquiring
and enlarging the business and good-
will of the private enterprise known as
Percival Trumpington-Jones, Esq.” A
sufficient number of shares will be
issued to guarantee Snaggs at least his
first year's screw; that done, the pro-
position should be practically gilt-edged.
So who's coming in on the bargain-
basement floor 2

AT THE PLAY.
“THE DAISY.”
I IMAGINE that the authors who
founded this play on a Hungarian orig-
inal regarded it as an ambitious piece
of work. If so, they were right in the
sense that they have attempted some-
thing very much beyond their powers.
In the view of the gentleman who ad-
dressed us at the fall of the curtain (I
understand that he was one of the
authors) it offered magnificent oppor-
tunities (I think “magnificent” was
the word) for the brilliant gifts of two
of the actors. Certainly it covered a
good bit of ground, what with this
world and the next; for it started with
roundabouts on the Heath, and got as
far away as the Judgment Day (Hun-
garian style?)—and fourteen years after,
I may have a contemptibly weak
stomach for this kind of thing, but I
confess that I don't care much for a
representation of the Judgment Day
in a melodrama of low life. Of course
low life has just as much right as any
other sort of life to be represented in a
Judgment Day scene; but it ought to
behave itself there and not introduce
back-chat.
I should explain that it was a special
Suicide Court, and that the object of
The Magister, as the Presiding Judge
was named in the programme, was to
inquire into the record of the delin-
quent and, if his answers were satisfac-
tory, to allow him to revisit the scenes
of his earthly life in order to repair any
little omissions that he might have
made in the hurry of departure. Un-
fortunately the leading case was a bad
example of suicide. It had not been
deliberate; he had simply killed him-
self impromptu in a tight corner to
avoid arrest for intended murder.
Worse still, when he returned to
earth after a lapse of fourteen years'
purgatory (between the sixth and
seventh scenes), for his record was a
rotten one and he had shown no signs of
penitence, the revenant made very poor
use of his hour. Returning to his wife
whom he had brutalised, he found that
she had taught their girl-child to regard
him as a paragon of virtue, and most of
his limited time was spent in correcting
this beautiful legend. You see, at the
time of his death he had had no chance
of making the child realise how bad he
was, for the excellent reason that she
had not yet been born, so he seized this
opportunity of making good that omis-
Slon.
As a practical illustration of the kind
of man he really had been, he struck
the child violently on the arm. We all
saw him do it and we all heard the
smack, but the child assured us that
she had not felt anything. This I sup-
pose was the author's way, ingenuous
enough, of reminding us that it was a
case of spirit and not of flesh, what-
ever our eyes and ears might persuade
us to think of it. -
Already in a previous scene there had
been the same old difficulty. While
the man lay dead on his bed his spirit
had been summoned by a Higher Power
(indicated in a peep-show), and his
corpse sat up, displacing the prostrate
form of the widow, who had to take up
a new position, without however ap-
pearing to notice anything. It was
still sitting up when the curtain fell,
“The Daisy” (Mr. CAINE).

(Sympathetic appreciation of her ignorance
on part of audience.)
“WHAT MADE
and incidentally was caught in the act
of resuming its recumbent position
when the curtain rose again for the
purpose of allowing the actors to receive
our respectful plaudits.
Behind me I heard an American lady
suggest that if they could somehow dis-
tinguish the spirit from the body it would
be better for our illusions. To which
her neighbour expressed the opinion
that they would eventually manage to
do that feat. I await, less hopefully,
this development in stage mechanism.
Meanwhile Mary Rose has much to
answer for.
The play began promisingly enough
with a scene full of colour and human-
ity, of humour and pathos. We were
among the roundabouts, whose florid
and buxom manageress, Mrs. Muscat (ad.
mirably played by Miss SUzANNE SHEL-
DoN), was having a quarrel of jealousy
with her assistant and late lover, “The
Daisy,” who had been seen taking
notice of Another. The dumb devotion
of this child, Julia (Miss MARY MER-
RALL), who could never find words for her
love—she said little beyond “Yuss” and
“I dunno"—was a very moving thing;
and the patient stillness with which
she bore his subsequent brutality held
us always under a strange fascination.
For the rest it was an ugly and sordid
business, relieved only by the coy con-
fidences of the amorous Maria (played
by Miss GLADys GoRDON with a nice
sense of fun). Mr. HENRY CAINE, as
“The Daisy,” presented very effectively
the rough-and-ready humour and the
frank brutality of his type; but he per-
haps failed to convey the devastating
attractions which he was alleged to
have for the frail sex; and his sudden
spasms of tragic emotion seemed a little
out of the picture.
Apart from the painful crudity of the
scene that was loosely described as
“The Other Side,” the play abounded
in amateurisms. For one thing there
was too much sermonising. It began
with an obtrusive homily on the part
of an inspector of police, who went out
of his way to admonish Julia about
the danger of associating with “The
Daisy.” Another instance was that of
the bank-messenger, a person of such
self-possession and detachment that he
contrived to deliver a moral address
while holding one foiled villain at the
point of his revolver and gripping the
other's wrist as in a vice.
Nothing again could have been more
naïve than the innocent home-coming
of the domestic carving-knive, freshly
sharpened, from the grinder's just in
time to be diverted to the objects of a
murderous enterprise.
Altogether, it was rather poor stuff,
unworthy of the talent of many of its
interpreters and of the trouble that
Miss EDITH CRAIG had spent over its
scenic effects. Perhaps the audience
had been led to expect too much, for
“The Daisy,” far from being the “wee,
modest " flower of RoHERT BURNs, had
been at some pains to draw preliminary
attention to its merits. . S.

ScILLY.
THE bells of Cadiz clashed for them
When they sailed away;
The Citadel guns, saluting, crashed for them
Over the Bay;
With banners of saints aloft unfolding,
Their poops a glitter of golden moulding,
Tambours throbbing and trumpets neighing,
Into the sunset they went swaying.
But the port they sought they wandered wide of,
And they won't see Spain again this side of
Judgment Day.
For they're down, deep down, in Dead Man's Town,
Twenty fathoms under the clean green waters.
No more hauling sheets in the rolling treasure fleets,
No more stinking rations and dread red slaughters;
No galley oars shall bow them nor shrill whips cow them,
Frost shall not shrivel them nor the hot sun smite,
No more watch to keep, nothing now but sleep—
Sleep and take it easy in the long twilight.
The bells of Cadiz tolled for them
Mournful and glum :
Up in the Citadel requiems rolled for them
On the black drum ;
Priests had many a mass to handle,
Nuestra Señora many a candle,
And many a lass grew old in praying
For a sight of those topsails homeward swaying—
But it's late to wait till a girl is bride of
A Jack who won't be back this side of
Kingdom Come,
But little they care down there, down there,
Hid from time and tempest by the jade-green waters;
They have loves a-plenty down at fathom twenty,
Pearly-skinned silver-finned mer-kings' daughters.
At the gilt quarter-ports sit the Dons at their sports,
A-dicing and drinking the red wine and white,
While the crews forget their wrongs in the sea-maids'
songs -
And dance upon the foc'sles in the grey ghost light.

A WAY OUT OF THE PRESENT UNREST.
“A PENNY for your thoughts,” I said
to Kathleen. - -
“I like that,” said Kathleen indig-
nantly. “A penny was the market value
of my thoughts in 1914. Why should
butter and cheese and reels of cotton
go up more than double and my thoughts
stay the same?”
“Twopence,” I offered.
“I said more than double,” she re-
marked coldly.
I plunged.
“Donel ” -
“I’ll put it in the collection bag for
you next Sunday,” I added hastily.
“Well, I was thinking of Veronica's
future. I was wondering what she
was going to be.”
“When we went to the Crystal
Palace,” I said gently, “I rather
gathered that she wanted to be the
proprietor of a merry-go-round. They
were dragons with red-plush seats.”
“She might go into Parliament,”
said Kathleen dreamily; “I expect
women will be able to do everything
by the time she's grown up. She
might be a Cabinet Minister. I don't
see why she shouldn't be Prime Min-
ister.” / - - - -
“Her hair's just about the right
length now,” I said. “And perhaps
she could give me congenial employ-
ment. I wouldn't mind being Minister
of Transport. There's quite a good
salary attached. But of course she may
have ideas of her own on the subject.”
Feeling curious, I went in search of
Veronica. I found her at a private
dance given by the butterflies and
hollyhocks at the other end of the lawn.
When she saw me she came to meet me
and made her excuses very politely.
“We've just been wondering what
i. 're going to be when you've stopped
ing a little girl,” I said.
“Sixpence,” I said.
“Me?” said Veronica calmly. “Oh,
I'm going to be a fairy. You don't
want me to be anything else, do you?”
she added anxiously.
Even the Prime Minister's
seemed suddenly quite flat.
“Oh, no,” I said. “I think you've
made a very good choice.” But she
was not quite satisfied.
“I shall hate going away from you,”
she said. “Couldn't you come too?”
“Where 2 ”
“To Fairyland.”
“Ah!” I said, “that takes some
thinking about. Could we come back
if we didn't like it 2." -
“N-no, I don't fink so. I've never
heard of anyone doing that. But you'll
love it,” she went on earnestly.
“You'll be ever so tiny and you can
draw funny frost pictures wiv rain-
post
bows and fold up flowers into buds and
splash dew - water over everyfing at
night and ride on butterflies and help
the birds to make nests. Fink what
fun to help a bird to make a nest'
You'll love it !”
“Is that all?" I said sternly. “Are
you keeping nothing from me? What
about witches and spells and being
turned into frogs? I'm sure I remem-
ber that in my fairy tales.”
“Oh, nothing that matters,” she
said quickly. “You can always tell a
witch, you know, and we'll keep out
of their way. An' if a nasty fairy
turns you into a frog a nice one will
always turn you back quite soon. It's
all right. You mustn't worry about
that. There won't be any fun if you
don't come too, darlin’,” she ended
shamelessly.
I considered.
“Veronica,” I said at last, “is there
such a thing as Ireland in Fairyland?
Is there an exchange that won't keep
steady ? Is there any labour trouble?”
She shook her head.
“I've never heard of any fing that
sounded like those,” she said; “I’m
sure there isn't.”
“That decides it,” I said. “We'll
all come. As soon as you can possibly
arrange it.”
She heaved a sigh of relief and ran
off to tell the glad news to the butter-
flies and hollyhocks. -
So that's settled.
I think we've made a wise decision.
After all, what's a witch or two, or
even a temporary existence as a frog,
compared with a coal strike?
THE WAIL OF THE WASP.
WHEN that I was a tiny grub,
And peevish and inclined to blub,
Mother, my Queen,
My infant grief you would assuage
With promise of the ripe greengage
And purple sheen
. Of luscious plums,
“When Autumn comes.”
The Autumn days are flying fast;
Across the bleak skies overcast
- Scurries the wind;
Where are those plums of purple hue,
Mother? I only wish that you
Had disciplined
My pampered youth
To face the truth.
The time for wasps is nearly done,
And what is life without the sun,
Mother, my Queen 2
Dull stupor numbs your royal head;
Torpid my sisters lie—or dead;
Come, let me lean
Back on my sting
And end the thing.

Golfer (very much off his gante). “ONE Round NEARER THE GRAVE.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Not for a long time have I got so great a pleasure from
any collection of short sketches as now from Miss ANNE
Douglas SEDGwick's Autumn Crocuses (SECKER). Not only
has the whole book a pleasant title, but each of these
stories is happily called after some flower that plays a part
in its development. I am aware of the primly Victorian
sound of such a description applied to art so modern as
that of Miss SEDGwick. You know already (I hope) how
wonderfully delicate is her almost passionate sensibility to
the finer shades of a situation. It is, I suppose, this quality
in her writing that makes me still have reminiscent shivers
when I think about that horrible little bogie-tale, The
Third Window; and these “Flower Pieces” (as 1860
might have called them) are no whit less subtle. I wish
I had space to give you the plots of some of them;
“Daffodils,” for instance, a quite unexpected and thrilling
treatment of perhaps the oldest situation of literature; or
“Staking a Larkspur,” the only instance in which Miss
SEDGwick's gently smiling humour crystallizes definitely
into comedy; or “Carnations,” the most brilliantly written
of all. As this liberty is denied me you must accept a plain
record of very rare enjoyment and take steps to share it.
Chief among the Secrets of Crewe House (Hodder AND
Stoughton), now divulged to the mere public, are the
marvellous efficiency and superhuman success achieved by
the British Enemy Propaganda Committee, which operated
in Lord CREwe's London house under the directorate of Lord
NorthcLIFFE. “What is propaganda?” the author asks
himself on an early page, and the right answer could have
been made in four letters: ADvT. It is endorsed by the
eulogistic manner in which the Committee's work is written
up by one of them, Sir CAMPBELL STUART, K.B.E., and
illustrated by photographs of Lord NoFTHCLIFFE (looking
positively Napoleonic) and of the sub-supermen. As in all
great achievements, the main principle was a simple one. A
good article is best advertised by truth; and it was the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth which the
Committee, with admirable conciseness and no little in-
genuity, so promulgated that it could no longer escape
notice even in the Central Empires. Not the least of the
Committee's difficulties and achievements was to get the
truth of our cause and policy so defined as to be susceptible
of unequivocal statement by poster, leaflet, film and gramo-
phone record. Sir CAMPBELL STUART perhaps tends to
underrate the rival show, the German propaganda organi-
zation, whose work, if it did Germany little good, has done
and is still doing colossal harm to us. Also he tends to
forget that Lord HAIG and his little lot in France at any
rate helped the Committee to effect the breakdown of the
German moral in 1918 and so to win the war.
. I feel that Miss MARGARET SYMONDs had a purpose in
writing A Child of the Alps (FISHER UNWIN), but, unless
it was to show how mistaken it is, as Basil, the Swiss
farmer, puts it, “to think when thou shouldst have been
living,” it has evaded me. The book begins with a romantic

marriage between an Englishwoman of some breeding and a
Swiss peasant who is a doctor, and tells the history of their
daughter until she is about to marry Basil, her original
sweetheart. I cannot be more definite or tell you how her
first marriage—with an English cousin—turned out, because
Linda's own account of this is all we get, and that is some-
what vague. A great many descriptions of beautiful scenery,
Swiss and Italian, come into the book, and a great many
people, some of them very individual and lifelike; but the
author's concentration on Linda gives them, people and
scenery alike, an unreal and irritating effect of having been
called into being solely to influence her heroine, and that
lessens their fascination. Yet it is a book which makes a
distinct impression, and once read will not easily be for-
gotten. It seems a strange comment to make on a new
volume of a “First Novel Library,” but A Child of

ing character. He has certain rude virtues which command
respect and other qualities, not in themselves virtues—such
as clan conceit and an intensely narrow provincialism—that
beget the virtues of industry, honesty and frugality. But to
the philosopher and student of character all types are inter-
esting, and Mr. ERVINE’s skill lies in his ability not merely to
draw his Ballyards hero to the life but to interest us in his
unsuccessful efforts to become a successful writer. It is
merely clan conceit that drives him forward in the pursuit
of this purpose, for circumstances have clearly intended him
to carry on the grocery business in which the family have
achieved some success and a full measure of local esteem.

The main object of the
characters in The Courts of
Idleness (WARD, Lock) was
to amuse themselves, and
as their sprightly conver-
sations were often punctu-
ated by laughter I take it
that they succeeded. To
will admit, is a figure simply
bursting with every kind of possibility. Fortunately, more-
over, MARGARET and H. DE WERE STACPoole have shown
themselves not only fully alive to all the humorous chances
of their theme, but inspired with an infectious delight in
them. It is, for example, a singularly happy touch that the
wild oats that Uncle Simon tries to retrieve are not of to-
day but from the long-vanished pastures of mid-Victorian
London. Of course such a fantasy can't properly be ended.
Having extracted (as I gratefully admit) the last ounce of
entertainment from him, the authors simply wake Uncle
Simon up and go home. As a small literary coincidence I
may perhaps add that it was my fortune to read the book in
the very garden (of that admirable Shaftesbury inn) which,
under a transparent disguise, is the scene of Uncle Simon's
restoration. Naturally this enhanced my enjoyment of a
sportive little comedy, which I can most cordially commend.

hundred pages of such entertainment tend to create a sense

interlude, in which we are given at least one stirring war-
incident. I imagine that Mr. YATEs desires to show that,
although certain people could frivol with the worst, they
could also fight and die bravely. The second part, “How
others left the Courts only to return,” introduces a new set
of people but with similar conversational attainments. Mr.

MICHAELMAS AND THE GOOSE.
(Lines written under the threat of a Coal-strike).
YoU for whose Mass by immemorial use,
When Autumn enters on his annual cycle,
We offer up the fatted goose
Mid fragrant steam of apple-juice,
Hear our appeal, O Michael !
Sir, do not try our piety too sore,
Bidding us sacrifice—a wrench how cruel!—
Her whom we prize all geese before—
The one that lays that precious ore,
Our priceless daily fuel.
Her output, as it is, shows want of will
To check the slackness growing rife and rifer;
And it would fall far lower still
(Being, indeed, reduced to mil)
If they should go and knife her.
Yet there are men who press the slaughterers' claim
In sympathetic language, talking loosely;
Among them Mr. Gosli NG—shame
That anyone with such a name
Should cackle so ungoosely
Not in your honour would that bird be slain
If they should kill her—and the hour is critical—
But for their own ends, thus to gain
An object palpably profane
(That is to say, political).
Defend her, Michael ! you who smote the crew
Of Satan on the jaw and stopped their bluffing;
So, if you see her safely through,
We'll give you thrice your usual due
Of other geese (with stuffing). O. S.
BRIDGE CONVENTIONS.
The game of Auction Bridge may be divided into three
species. There is the one we play at home, the second
which we play at the Robinsons', and the third that is
played at the high table at my club.
The three games are peculiarly distinct, but I have only
recently discovered, at some expense, that each one has
its particular conventions. At home, if I venture a light
no-trump, and Joan, sitting on my right, exclaims well
out of turn, “Oh father,” we all know that Joan has the
no-trumper, and the play proceeds accordingly.
At the Robinsons' it is different. Suppose I make a
call of one spade and the elder hand two hearts, and my
partner (let us suppose he is Robinson) passes, and I say
“Two spades,” and the elder hand says “Three hearts,”
and Robinson bellows “No,” I at once realise that it
would be extremely dangerous to call three spades.
These two typical forms of convention are quite clear and
seldom lead to any misunderstanding. But the high table
at the club is different, and, if I might say so with all
diffidence, the conventions there are not so well defined.
In fact they may lead to terrible confusion. I speak
with confidence on this point because I tried them a few
days ago.
Three disconsolate monomaniacs wanted making up, and
I, dwelling upon the strong game I had recently been
playing at home, threw precaution to the winds and made
them up. My partner was a stern man with a hard blue
eye and susceptible colouring. After we had cut he in-
formed me that, should he declare one no-trump, he wished
to be taken out into a major suit of five; also, should he
double one no-trump, he required me to declare without
fail my best suit. He was going to tell me some more
but somebody interrupted him. Then we started what ap-
peared to be a very ordinary rubber.
My partner perhaps was not quite at his best when it
was my turn to lead; at least he never seemed particularly
enthusiastic about anything I did lead, but otherwise—
well, I might almost have been at the Robinsons'. Then
suddenly he doubled one no-trump.
I searched feverishly for my best suit. I had two–four
diamonds to the eight; four hearts to the eight. A small
drop of perspiration gathered upon my brow. Then I saw
that, whereas I held the two, three, five of hearts, I had
the two, three, six of diamonds. Breathing a small prayer,
I called two diamonds. This was immediately doubled by
the original declarer of no-trumps. My partner said “No,”
my other opponent said “No,” and I, thinking it couldn't
be worse, switched into my other best suit and made it two
hearts. The doubler passed and I felt the glow of pride
which comes to the successful strategist. This was frozen
instantly by my partner's declaration of two no-trumps.
If Mr. SMILLIE were suddenly transformed into a Duke I
am certain he would not look so genuinely horror-struck
as my partner did when I laid my hand upon the table.
Yet, as I pointed out, it was his own beastly convention,
so I just washed my hands of it and leaned back and
watched him hurl forth his cards as Zeus hurled the
thunder-bolts about. -
Then, of course, the other convention had to have its
innings. My partner went one no-trump and I began to
look up my five suit. In the meantime the next player on
the declaring list doubled the no-trump. This was very
confusing. Was he playing my partner's convention and
asking his partner for his best suit 2 I hesitated; but
orders are orders, so, having five spades to the nine, I
declared two spades. My left-hand enemy said “No”; my
partner said “No”; and the doubler—well, he doubled
again. This time my partner, being Dummy, hurled down
all his thunder-bolts—thirteen small ones—at once. When
it was all over he explained at some length that he did not
wish ever to be taken out of an opponent's double. I
expect this was another convention he was going to tell
me about when he was interrupted in the overture to the
rubber. Anyway he hadn't told me, and I at some slight cost
—five hundred—had nobly carried out his programme.
When eventually the final blow fell and we, with the aid
of the club secretary, were trying to add up the various
columns of figures, the waiter brought up the evening
papers. I seized one and, looking at the chief events of
the day, remarked, "STEVENSON is playing a great game.
My late partner said, “Ah, you're interested in billiards.”
I admitted the soft impeachment. “Yes,” he said dreamily,
“a fine game, billiards; you never have to play against
three opponents.”
I have now definitely decided that playing my 2 handicap
game at the Robinsons' and my plus 1 in the home circle
is all the bridge I really care about.
Another Impending Apology.
“Man’s original evolution from the anthropoid apes . . . becomes a
reasonable hypothesis, especially when we think of the semi-naked
savages who inhabited these islands when Julius Caesar landed on our
shores, and our present Prime Minister.”— Church Family Newspaper.
“The contemplated aerial expedition to the South Pole will start
in October. Aeroplanes and airships will be used, and the object of
the trip is to study magnetic wages.”—Irish Paper.
Incidentally it is expected a new altitude record may be
achieved.

THE SNAIL.
THE life of the snail is a fight against
odds,
Though fought without fever or
flummox;
You see, he is one of those gasteropods
Which have to proceed on their
stomachs.
Just think how you'd hate to go round
on your own,
Especially if it was gummy,
And wherever you travelled you left on
a stone
The horrid imprint of your tummy!
Wherever you hid, by that glutinous
trail
Some boring acquaintance would
follow ; -
And this is the bitter complaint of the
snail
Who is pestered to death by the
swallow.
But remember, he carries his house on
his back,
And that is a wonderful power;
When he goes to the sea he has nothing
to pack,
And he cannot be caught in a shower.
After all there is something attractive
in that :
And then he can move in a minute,
And it's something to have such a very
small flat
That nobody else can get in it.
But this is what causes such numbers
of snails
To throw themselves into abysses:–
They are none of them born to be
definite males
And none of them definite misses.
They cannot be certain which one of a
pair -
Is the Daddy and which is the
Mummy;
And that must be even more awful to
bear
Than walking about on your tummy.

SEPTEMBER IN MY GARDEN.
THERE are few things I find so
sorrowful as to sit and smoke and reflect
on the splendid deeds that one might
have been doing if one had only had
the chance. The PRIME MINISTER feels
like this, I suppose, when he remembers
how unkind people have prevented him
from making a land fit for heroes to
live in, and I feel it about my garden.
There can be no doubt that my garden
is not fit for heroes to saunter in ; the
only thing it is fit for is to throw used
matches about in ; and there is indeed
a certain advantage in this. Some
people's gardens are so tidy that you
have to stick all your used matches
very carefully into the mould, with the
result that next year there is a shrub-
bery of Norwegian pine.
The untidiness of my garden is due
to the fault of the previous tenants.
Nevertheless one can clearly discern
through the litter of packing - cases
which completely surrounds the house
that there was originally a garden there.

THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
PUNCH, OR
done about this, so I bought a little
book on gardening, and, turning to
September, began to read.
“September,” said the man, “marks
the passing of summer and the advent
of autumn, the time of ripening ruddy-
faced fruits and the reign of a rich and
gloriously-coloured flora."
About the first part of this statement
I have no observation to make. It is
probably propaganda, subsidised by the
Meteorological Office in order to per-
suade us that we still have a summer;
it has nothing to do with my present
theme. But with regard to the ripen-
ing ruddy-faced fruits I should like to
point out that in my garden there are
none of these things, because the previ-
ous tenants took them all away when
they left. Not a ruddy-faced fruit re-
mains. As for the rich and gloriously-
coloured flora, I lifted the edges of all
the packing-cases in turn and looked
for it, but it was not there either. It
should have consisted, I gather, of
“gorgeously-coloured dahlias, gay sun-
flowers, Michaelmas daisies, gladioli and
other autumn blossoms, adding bright-
ness and gaiety to our flower-garden.”
“Gaiety” seems to be rather a strong
point with this author, for a little further
on he says, “The garden should be gay
throughout the month with the follow-
ing plants,” and then follows a list of
about a hundred names which sound
like complicated diseases of the internal
organs. I cannot mention them all,
but it seems that my garden should be
gay throughout with Lysimachia cleth-
roides, Kniphofia nobilis and Pyrethrum
uliginosum. It is not. How anything
can be gay with Pyrethrum uliginosum I
cannot imagine. An attitude of rever-
ent sympathy is what I should have
expected the garden to have. But that
is what the man says.
Then there is the greenhouse. “From
now onwards,” he writes, “the green-
house will meet with a more welcome
appreciation than it has during the
summer months. The chief plants in
flower will be Lantanas, Campanula
pyramidalis, Zonal Pelargoniums,” and
about twenty more. “Oh, they will, will
they?" I thought, and opened the green-
house door and looked in. Against the
wall there were two or three mouldering
peach-trees,andall overtheroof and floor
a riot of green tomatoes, a fruit which
even when it becomes ruddy-faced I do
not particularly like. In a single large
pot stood a dissipated cactus, resem-
bling a hedgehog suffering from mange.
But what was even more bitter to
me than all this ruin and desolation
was the thought of the glorious deeds I
might have been doing if the garden
had been all right. Phrases from the
book kept flashing to my eye.
Mistress. “So IT's THE CHAUFFEUR THAT’s GoING To BE THE LUCKY MAN, MARY 2
I was UNDER THE IMPREssion THAT THE BUTLER was THE FAvourtED on E.”
Cook. “THAT was so, MUM ; BUT MR. WILLough BY LET ME SLIP THROUGH His
FINGERs.”
“Thoroughly scrub the base and sides
of the pots, and see that the drainage-
holes are not sealed with soil.” How
it thrilled the blood
“Damp the floors and staging every
morning and afternoon, and see that
the compost is kept uniformly moist.”
What a fascinating pursuit !
“Feed the plants once a week with
liquid manure.” It went like a clarion
call to the heart.
And here I was condemned to ennui
and indolence when I might have been
sitting up all night dosing the Zonal
Pelargoniums with hot beef-tea and
taking the temperature of the Campan-
ula pyramidalis. Even with the ruddy-
faced fruits there would have been plenty
to do.
“Wooden trays with open lath bot-
toms made to slide into a framework
afford the best means of storing apples
and pears. The ripening of pears may
be accelerated by enclosing them in bran
or dry clean sand in a closed tin box.”
It did not say how often one was to
clean out the cage, nor whether you
put groundsel between the bars.
I told the man next door of my
SOrrows.
“Well, there's plenty to do,” he said.
“Get a spade and dig the garden all
over.”
Dig it all over indeed when I ought
to be plucking nosegays of Lysimachia
clethroides and Pyrethrum uliginosum
to put in my buttonhole I prefer to
dream my dreams. Evoe.

[SEPTEMBER 29, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CABMAN AND THE COIN.
“WE must wait a minute or two for
Sir Charles,” said our hostess. “Every-
one elseis here,” and she beamed around
the room.
The various mauvais quart d'heure
dialogues that this speech had inter-
rupted were resumed, most of them
switching on to the question of punc-
tuality. And then a cab was heard to
stop outside and after a minute or so,
presumably spent in financial trans-
actions, the bell rang and the knocker
knocked.
“That's Sir Charles,” said our
hostess; “there he is; ” and a few
moments later the guest we all awaited
so fervently was in the room, full of
apologies. -
“Never mind why you're late,” said
our hostess, “I’m sure you couldn't
help it. Now we'll eat,” and once
again a dozen Londoners fell into ark-
approaching formation and moved to-
wards repletion.
The party was familiar enough, after
certain solvents of speech had been
applied, for conversation to become
general; and during the entrée we were
all listening to Sir Charles telling the
famous story of the eminent numisma-
tist who, visiting the British Museum,
was taken for a thief. By way of
making the narration the more vivid
he felt in his pocket for a coin with
which to illustrate the dramatic crisis,
when his expression became suddenly
alarmed and fixed. -
“Good heavens!” he said, fumbling
nervously all over his clothes, “I’ve
given it to the cabman. Of all the
infernal idiocy! I knew I should. I
had a presentiment that I should get it
muddled up with my other money and
give it away.”
“What was it 2 " he was asked.
“Was it something very valuable?”
“Was it a rare coin 2 ”
Murmurs of sympathy made a low
accompaniment.
“It was a goldmohur,” said Sir
Charles. “A very beautiful coin of
the Moguls. I keep it as a kind of
mascot. I've had it for years, but left
it behind and it reached me from India
only this morning. Having come away
without it I sent a cable for it to be
forwarded on. And now ! It's the
rottenest luck.”
“What was it worth 2'' our hostess
asked.
“Not very much. Thirty pounds
perhaps. But that isn't it. The money
is nothing—it's the sentimental asso-
ciations that make the loss so serious.”
“Well,” said a practical man, “you
needn't despair. Ring up Scotland Yard
and ask them the best thing to do.”
“Did you take the cabman's num-
ber ?” some one asked.
“Of course he didn't,” our hostess
replied. “Who ever does a thing like
that 2 ”
“As a matter of fact,” said Sir Charles,
“I sometimes do. But this time, of
course, I didn't.” He groaned. “No,
it's gone for ever. The cabman will
see it's gold and sell it. I wouldn't
trust your modern taxi-chauffeur with
anything.”
“If you would feel any happier,” said
our hostess, “do telephone now.”
“No,” said Sir Charles, “no. It's no
use. A coin like that would never be
surrendered. It's too interesting; even
a cabman would realise that. Umbrellas
they'll take back, of course—umbrellas
and bags, but not a goldmohur. He'll
either keep it to show his pals in public-
houses or have it fixed up as a brooch
for his wife.”
As Sir Charles finished speaking and
once more turned gloomily to his
neglected plate the knocker was heard
again to knock, and then one of the
maids approached her mistress and
spoke to her in low tones.
Our hostess brightened. “Now,
Sir Charles,” she said, “perhaps you'll
revise your opinion of our taxi-drivers.
Tell Sir Charles what it is,” she said to
the maid.
“If you please,” the maid began,
“there's a cabman at the door. He
says he brought a gentleman here
and ” Here she faltered.
“Go on, Robins,” said her mistress.
“If you please, I don't like to,” said
the girl. “It's so—so * *
“I should like to hear it exactly,”
said Sir Charles.
“Well,” said the maid with a burst
of courage, “he says there's a gentle-
man here who—who bilked him—who
passed a piece of bad money on him in
the dark. Here it is,” and she handed
Sir Charles the goldmohur. “And he
says if he doesn't get an honest shil-
ling in exchange for it he'll have the
law on him.” E. W. L.
THE KNELL OF THE NAVY.
Spooner is a remarkable fellow. His
duties on board this ship are to fly once
a week off the deck, revolve twice round
the masts and sink thankfully down
into the water, where we haul him out
by the breeches and hang his machine
up to dry on the fo'c's'le. By per-
forming these duties four times a month,
he leads us to believe he is preparing
the way for the ultimate domination
of Air Power. We of the Navy are
obsolete, and our hulls are encrusted
with the Harwich barnacle.
The argument proceeds on these lines:
One day there will be another war—
perhaps to-morrow. We of the Navy,
coalless and probably by that time rum-
less as well, will rush blindly from our
harbours, our masts decked with Jolly
Rogers and our sailors convulsed with
hornpipe, to seek the enemy. But, alas,
before the ocean spray has wetted our
ruby nostrils we shall find ourselves
descended upon from above and bombed
promiscuously in the middle watch.
It will be all over inside a nautical
second. The sky will be black with hos-
tile aircraft, and there will be lead in the
stew and bleeding bodies in the bilge.
Hollow laughter will sound from the
bridge, where the Captain will find the
wheel come away in his hand, and the
gramophone will revolve eternally on
a jazz rune because no one will be alive
to stop it. When all these things occur
we of the Navy will know that our day
is past and done.
Why our Mr. Spooner is such a re-
markable fellow is because he can sit
deep in an easy-chair and recite these
things without turning a single hair on
his top lip. Of course he realises that
the work of the Navy must go on—
until the crash descends. But it is
rather unsettling for us. It seems to
give us all a sort of impermanent feel-
ing. Quite naturally we all ask what
is the use of keeping up the log and
painting the ship 2 Why isn't all the
spare energy in the ship bent to polish-
ing up our boat-drill? or why aren't the
people who can afford it encouraged to
buy unsinkable waistcoats? The Ad-
miralty must know all about it if they
are still on speaking terms with the Air
Ministry. It's a beastly feeling.
Yesterday a formation of powerful
aeroplanes, which Spooner called the
“Clutching Hand,” came out from the
land and flew round us, and simply
prodded us with their propellers as we
lay defenceless on the water.
The bogey is undoubtedly spreading.
The Admiral came aboard this after-
noon to inspect our new guns. He
yawned the whole time in his beard
and did not ask a single question. We
suppose he realises that the whole busi-
ness is merely a makeshift arrangement
for the time being and not worth both-
ering about as long as the brass is pol-
ished and the guns move up and down
easily.
Well, as far as we are concerned it
only remains for Number One, who has
a brother in the Air Force, to cancel
his winter order with Breezes, the naval
tailors, and we shall all go below and
pack our trunks and get ready to hand
the ship over to Spooner. If the Navy
of the future must be under water there
is no particular reason why we should
be there too.

I.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, You continue to
ask me what I am doing, and why, and
when I am going to sign the Peace, like
everyone else, and return to honest work.
The answer is in the negative. Though
I am very fond of peace, I don't like
work. And, as for being honest, I tend
rather to politics. Have I never told
you that I take a leading part on the
Continent in the great Class War now
raging? And, by the way, has anyone
let you know that it is only a matter of
time before the present order of society
is closed down, the rule of the prole-
tariatestablished and people like Charles
set on to clean the streets or ruthlessly
eliminated 2
LENIN began to worry about you as
long ago as 1915, and you know what
happens to people when LENIN really
starts to worry about them. He wasn't
satisfied that enough violent interest
was being taken in you; the mere Social-
ists he regarded as far too moderate and
enteel. As for their First and their
Second International—he wanted some.
thing thoroughgoing, something with a
bit of ginger to it. So at the Zimmerwald
Congress on the 5th September of that
year all the out-and-outs unanimously
declared war to the knife agin the Gov-
ernment, whatever and wherever the
Government might be. How many
long and weary years have you waited,
Charles, to be told what Zimmerwald-
ianism might be—a religious tendency,
a political aspiration, a valvular disease
of the appendix or something to do
with motor-cars? Ah, but that is as
nothing to the secrets I am going to
let you into, to force you into, before I
have done with you.
It was not until well into 1918 that
I myself began to worry about LENIN.
He had left Switzerland by that time,
having got tired of the jodelling Swiss
and their infernally placid mountains.
When the revolution broke out in
Russia he felt it was just the thing for
him, and his German backers felt he
was just the man for it. So LENIN,
whose real name isn't LENIN, went
into partnership with TROTSKY, whose
real name isn't TROTSKY, and set up in
business in Moscow. But the thing
was too good to be confined to Russia;
an export department was clearly called
for. It was when they began in the
“off-licence" trade, in the “jug-and-
bottle” business, that they ran up
against your Henry.
With the view of upheaving Switzer-
land, LENIN and Co. sent a Legation to
its capital, the principle being, no doubt,
that before you cut another people's
throat you must first establish friendly
relations. This Legation arrived in
May, 1918, when we were all so occu-
pied with the War, making returns and
indents and things, that it hoped to
pass unnoticed. But there was some-
thing about that Legation which caught
the eye; it had not the Foreign Office
look about it—smart Homburg hats,
washleather gloves, attaché-cases with
majestic locks, spats . . . there was
something missing. It looked as if it
might be so many Anarchists plotting
a bomb affair.
And that's what it was. I suppose
you will say I am inventing it when I
tell you that it used to sit round a table,
in the basement of an Italian restau-
rant, devising schemes for getting rid of
people (especially people like Charles)
en bloc, that it didn't provide the Italian
restaurant-keeper with as much money
as he thought he could do with; that the
Italian restaurant-keeper came round to
see us after dark; wouldn't give his name;
came into the room hurriedly; locked the
door behind him ; whispered “H'st |!”
and told us all about it. It requires an

Italian to do that sort of thing pro-
perly; but this fellow was better than
the best. I couldn't go to a cinema
for months afterwards because it lacked
the thrill of real life.
We were so impressed with his per-
formance that we asked him his trade.
He dropped the sinister, assumed the
bashful and told us that he was an
illusionist and juggler before he took to
restaurant-keeping and sleuthing. He
juggled four empty ink-pots for our
entertainment and made one of them
disappear. Not quite the way to treat
a world-revolution ; but there ! This
was all in the autumn of 1918, when
we were naturally a bit above our-
selves. -
Switzerland has four frontiers—Ger-
man, Austrian, Italian and French.
LENIN's Legation had opened up,
modestly and without ostentation as
becomes a world's reformer, a distri-
buting office on each one of the four.
Somehow I could never work myself
up to be really alarmed at jolly ANNA
BALABANOFF, but I fancy she has done as
much harm since as most people achieve
here on earth. Her job was to work
into Italy; but in those days, when war
conditions still prevailed, she couldn't
do much more than stand on the shores
of the Lake of Lugano and scowl at
the opposite side, which is Italian. Do
you remember the lady's photograph in
our daily Press? If so you will agree
with me that even that measure was
enough to start unrest in Italy. . . .
Charles, my lad, let us break off there
and leave you for a week all of a tremble.
In the course of these Sensational Revel-
ations we are going to see something of
the arrangements made for the break-
up of the old world, which, with all its
faults, we know we still love. The pro-
cess of reconstruction is not yet defined,
and will probably not be attempted in
our time. In any case, when things
arrive at that stage, there will be no
Charles and, I am still more sorry to
say, no Henry.

it, I for one am not prepared to be

removal from a Bolshevist Disposals

Boards are; one's body might lie out in

were being passed round the Moscow

death about it, and now I am going to

flesh creep and your blood run cold. No
use your telling me you don't care what

you can be left in peace for the present.

But as I wait I mark a woeful change.
Time was when wrathfully I should have heard
Loud jubilation mock my hope deferred;
For who, first in the bathroom, fit and young,
Would, as he washed, refrain from giving tongue,
Nor chant his challenge from the soapy deep,
Inspired by triumph and renewed by sleep?
Then how is this? Here have I waited long,
Yet heard no crash of surf, no snatch of song.

Does this decorum mean that we grow old 2
I knew you, James, as clamorous in your bath
As porpoises that thresh the ocean-path;
Oh! as you bathed when we were happy boys,
You drowned the taps with inharmonious noise;
Above the turmoil of the lathered wave
How you would bellow ditties of the brave!
How, wilder that the sea-mew, through the foam
Whistle shrill strains that agonised your home.
In the brimmed bath you revelled; all the floor
Was swamped with spindrift; underneath the door
The maddened water gushed, while strong and high
Your piercing top-note staggered passers-by.
But now I hear the running taps alone,
A faint and melancholy monotone;
Or just a gentle swirl when sober hope
Searches the bath's profound to salve the soap.
Sadly I kick the unresponsive door;
Youth, with its blithe ablutions, is no more.

IN A GOOD CAUSE.
AMONG the minor charitable organisations of London not
the least admirable and useful is the Santa Claus Home at
Highgate, which the two Misses CHARLEs have been
administering with such devotion and success since 1891.
Its modest aim is to keep open twenty beds for small
children suffering from hip and spinal disease, and to give
them such treatment as will prevent them becoming hope-
less cripples; and this purpose hitherto has been fulfilled

THE RETURN FROM THE HOLIDAY.
“SED REvocab E GRADUM . . .
. Hoc opUS, HIC LABOR, EST."
THE SHRIMP TEST.
AT last we have an explanation of a
good deal of the social and industrial
unrest of recent months. Since April
there has been a serious shrimp short-
age.
"How far this is responsible for dis-
satisfaction among the miners and other
workers it is impossible to say; but
in other circles of society this shrimp
shortage has been responsible for much.
From golf - courses this summer has
come a stream of complaint that the
game is not what it was. Sportsmen,
again, have gone listlessly to their task
and have petulantly wondered why the
bags have been so poor. House-parties
have been failures. In many a Grand
Stand nerves have gone to pieces. Un-
doubtedly this grave news from the
North Sea is the explanation. What can
one expect when there are no shrimps
for tea 2
For the eating of shrimps is more
than a mere assimilation of nourish-
ment, more even than the consumption
of an article of diet which is beneficial
to brain tissues and nerve centres.
After all, the oyster or the haddock
serves equally well for those purposes.
But before one eats a shrimp a certain
deftness and delicacy of manipulation
are needed to effect the neat extraction
of the creature from its unpalatable
cuticle. Not so with the haddock.
Shrimp-eating is something more
than table deportment; it is a test of
sanqfroid and savoir faire, qualities so
necessary to the welfare of the nation.
The man who can efficiently prepare
shrimps for seemly consumption, chat-
ting brightly the while with his fair
neighbour and showing neither mental
nor physical distress, can be relied upon
to comport himself with efficiency whe-
ther in commerce or statecraft.
Watch a man swallow an oyster, and
how much more do you know of him
after the operation than you knew be-
fore? But put him in a Marchioness's
drawing-room and set a shrimp before
him, and the manner in which he
tackles the task will reveal the sort of
stuff he is made of.
The shrimp test is one before which
physically strong men have broken
down, while the seemingly weak have
displayed amazing fortitude.
In these days, when it behoves every
man among us to be at his best, we
view this famine in shrimps with grave
concern, and we trust that the Board
of Agriculture and Fisheries is alive to
the significance of this crisis.

RAINY MORNING.
As I was walking in the rain
I met a fairy down a lane.
We walked along the road together;
I soon forgot about the weather.
He told me lots of lovely things:
The story that the robin sings,
And where the rabbits go to school,
And how to know a fairy pool,
And what to say and what to do
If bogles ever bother you.
The flowers peeped from hedgy places
And shook the raindrops from their
faces,
And furry creatures all the way
Came popping out and said “Good-
day.”
But ºn we reached the little bend
Just where the village houses end
He seemed to slip into the ground,
And when I looked about I found
The rain was suddenly all over
And the sun shining on the clover.

Enlightened Yokel (explaining the picture in a hoarse whisper). “THE BLEw BE THE ZEE, JEM, AN' THE YALLER BE THE cons,
sure NUFF.
AN' THE BIT o' BRowN IN THE conneR-BUST ME, THAT MUST BE TH' ol' GEYSER 'ERSELF ' "
MIRIAM'S TWO BABIES.
THAT last morning at Easthaven,
Miriam, alone of us three, preserved
her equanimity. I had arisen with the
lark, having my own things to pack, to
say nothing—though nothing was not
the only thing I said—of Billie's pram
and Billie's cot and Billie's bath. I
wished afterwards I had let the lark
rise by himself; if I do heavy work
before breakfast I always feel a little
depressed (“snappy” is Miriam's crude
synonym) for the remainder of the
day.
Å. to Billie, his first farewells went
off admirably. He blew a kiss to the
lighthouse, that tall friend who had
winked at him so jovially night after
night. And it was good to see him
hoisted aloft—pale-blue jersey, goldi-
locks and small wild-rose face—to hug
his favourite fisherman, Mr. Moy, of
the grizzled beard and the twinkling
yes.
But when the time came for Billie to
say good-bye to the beach he refused
point-blank.
“Billie wants to keep it,” he voci-
ferated.
Miriam, woman-like, was all for com-
promise. Billie should fill his pail with
pretty pebbles and take them to London
in the puffer-train. I demurred. The
fishermen already complained that the
south-easterly gales were scouring their
beach away. Moreover, as I explained
to Miriam, ere long it would devolve
upon me to carry the dressing-case,
Billie himself and—as likely as not—
the deck-chairs and the tea-basket.
Why increase my burdens by a hundred-
weight or so of Easthaven beach 2
It ended by her admitting I was per-
ſectly right, and—by Billie filling his
pail with pretty pebbles.
I still had that feeling of depression
when we returned to our rooms for an
early luncheon (there's nothing I so
detest); after which we discovered that
Miriam thought I had told the man to
call for the luggage at 12.45, while I
thought that Miriam had told the man
to call for the luggage at 12.45.
And then we had to change twice,
and the trains were crowded, and
Miriam insisted on looking at The
Daily Dressmaker, and Billie insisted
on not looking at Mother Goose.
At Liverpool Street station I kept
my temper in an iron control while
pointing out to quite a number of taxi-
men the ease with which Billie's pram
and Billie's cot and Billie's bath could
be balanced upon their vehicles. But
the climax came when, Miriam having
softened the heart of one of them, we
were held up in a block at Oxford
Circus, and Billie, a propos of nothing,
drooped his under lip and broke into a
roar—
“Billie wants the sea-side | Billie
wants Mr. Moy!”
I suppose Miriam did her best, but
he was not to be quieted, and old ladies
in omnibuses peered reproaches at me,
the cruel, cruel parent. I frowned
upon Miriam.
“Will nothing stop the child?”
“There's a smut on your nose, dear,”
was all she replied. I rubbed my nose;
I also ground my teeth. . . . -
I was still wrestling on the pave-
ment with the pram, the cot and the
rest of it, when Billie's cries from
within the house suddenly ceased. Had
the poor little chap burst something?
I hurried indoors and found him—all
sunshine after showers—seated on the
floor with rocking-horse and Noah's
ark and butcher's shop grouped around
him.

something Miriam had just said.

I reached my study and collapsed
into a chair. What a day! But little
by little, shelf upon shelf, I became
aware of the books I had not seen for
a whole month: LAMB, my Eliza-
bethans, a row of STEvenson. I did
not want to read; it was enough to
feast one's eyes on their backs, to take
down a volume and handle it—my old
green-jacketed BRowNING, for instance.
And the small red MEREDITHs all needed
rearranging.
A little later I turned round to see
Miriam standing in the doorway. Re-
morse seized me; I put an arm about
her, with—“Tired, old thing?”
She looked down at my books and,
half-smiling, she looked up again.
“He’s quite good now he's got his
toys,” she said, and kissed me.
WERY PERSONAL.
Just to see what it looks like with
my name in it, I have been making a
diary of my doings (some real, some
imaginary) in the approved language
of the Society and Personal column.
I am Mr. James Milfly. This is how
it looks:—
“Yesterday was the fortieth birthday
of Mr. James Milfly. He passed it
quietly at the office and at home. No
congratulatory messages were received
and no replies will be sent.”
“Among the outgoing passengers on
the paddle steamer Solent Tortoise, on
Tuesday, was Mr. James Milfly. He
returned to the mainland the same
evening, and will be at Southsea four
days longer, after which, unless he can
think of an adequate excuse, he will
return to town.”
“Mr. James Milfly, who recently
sustained a laceration of the finger
while cleaning his safety razor after
use, passed another good night. The
injured memberis healing satisfactorily,
and no further bulletins will be issued.”
“The performance of The Bibulous
Butler at the Corinthian Theatre last
night was witnessed by Mr. James
Milfly and party, who occupied two
seats in the eighth row of the pit.”
“Mr. James Milfly is a guest for the
week-end at Acacia Lodge, Clumpton,
the residence of his old friend, Mr.
Albert Purges. Excellent sparrow-
shooting was enjoyed after tea on
Saturday in the famous home coverts
from which the lodge derives its title.”
“Among those unable to be present
at the Duchess of Dibdale's reception
on Friday was Mr. James Milfly, no
invitation having reached him.”
“Mr. James Milfly has been granted

at the society's recent show.”
“Maria, Mrs. Murdon, is visiting
her son-in-law, Mr. James Milfly. Her
stay is likely to be a lengthy one.”
“Mr. James Milfly will spend the
greater part of to-morrow in London.
No letters will be forwarded.”
Try this for yourself. You have no
idea what a sense of pomp and well-fed
importance it gives you.

AT THE PLAY.
“A NIGHT OUT."
EveRYBody except myself seems to
recall the fact that the late farce of this
name, adapted from L'Hôtel du Libre
Echange, ran for five hundred nights
before it expired. Some restorative
music has now been applied to it and
the corpse has revived. Indeed there
are the usual signs of another long run.
The trouble is that nearly all the cast
at the Winter Garden Theatre seem to
think that, if the play is to run, they
must run too. They don't keep still
for a moment, because they dare not.
Even Mr. LESLIE HENsoN, whose fun
would be more effective if he didn't try
so hard, feels that he must be at top
pressure all the while with his face
and his body and his words. Yet he
could well afford to keep some of his
strength in reserve, for he is a born
humourist (in what one might perhaps
call the Golliwog vein). But, whether
it is that he underrates his own powers
or that he can't contain himself, he
keeps nothing in reserve; and the others,
less gifted, follow his lead. They per-
sist in “pressing,” as if they had no
confidence in their audience or their
various authors or even themselves.
One is, of course, used to this with
singers in musical comedy, who make
a point of turning the lyrics assigned
to them into unintelligible patter. Per-
haps in the present case we lost little
by that, though there was one song (of
which I actually heard the words) that
seemed to me to contain the elements
of a sound and consoling philosophy.
It ran something like this:—
For you won't be here and I won't be here
When a hundred years are gone,
But somebody else will be well in the cart"
And the world will still go on.
Mr. LESLIE HENSON, as I have hinted,
allowed himself—and us—no rest. His
energy was devastating; he gave the
audience so much for their money that
in the retrospect I feel ashamed of not
having paid for my seat. One's taste
for him may need acquiring; but, once
acquired, there is clearly no getting away
from it. Perhaps his most irresistible
moment was when he laid out six
policemen and then meekly surrendered
to a female constable who led him off
by the ear.
Mr. FRED LESLIE (a name to conjure
with !) was almost fiercely emphatic
in the part of Paillard, and I preferred
the relatively quiet methods of Mr.
AUSTIN MELFord, who did without
italics. Mr. RALPH Roberts was droll
as a waiter; and it may have been my
fault that I found Mr. DAVY BURNABY
rather unfunny in the part of Matthieu.
* Or, alternatively, soup.
Of the ladies, two could sing and
two, or even three, could act (Miss
LILY ST. John could do both); nearly
all had good looks and a few of them
were pleasantly acrobatic.
The scene of the Hotel Pimlico, with
an alleged private sitting-room on one
side, an alleged bedroom on the other,
and a hall and staircase in the middle,
was extraordinarily unconvincing. The
partition walls came to an end at quite
a long distance from the front; and,
with the general company spreading
themselves at large over the whole
width of the foreground, it was very
difficult to entertain any illusion of
that privacy which is of the essence of
the cabinet particulier. I say nothing
of the bedroom, whose tenancy was
frankly promiscuous. -
The fun, of course, is old-fashioned;
if one may say it of a French farce, it is
Victorian. Apart from a few topical
allusions worked in rather perfunctorily
there is scarcely anything said or done
that might not have been said or done
in the 'eighties. But for a certain type
of Englishman there is a perennial at-
traction in feeling that at any moment
the proprieties may be outraged. That
they never actually are outraged does
not seem very greatly to affect his
pleasure. He can always console him-
self with easy conjecture of the wicked-
ness of the original. So there will never
be wanting a public for these Nocles
Parisianae.
Let us hope that somehow it all
helps to keep the sacred flame of the
Entente burning. Wire MILLERAND !

BETTERING THE BANYOROS.
(By a Student of Anthropology.)
SIR JAMES FRAZER's luminous résumé
of the investigations of the MACRIE
Expedition amongst the Banyoros has
only one defect. He omits all reference
to the subsequent and even more fruit-
ful visit of the Expedition to the adjoin-
ing Noxas tribe, whose manners and
customs are of extraordinary interest.
This remarkable race are noted not
merely for their addiction to the dance,
but for the kaleidoscopic rapidity with
which the dances themselves are changed
from season to season. Only a few
years ago the entire tribe were under the
spell of the Ognat, which in turn gave
place to the Tortskof and the Zaj, the
last named being an exercise in which
violent contortions of the body were
combined with the profoundest melan-
choly of facial expression. Curiously
enough the musicians who are em-
ployed at these dances are not of indi-
genous stock, but of a negroid type and
are imported from a distance at high
salaries.
The literary gifts of this singular tribe
are on a par with their saltatory talent,
but are at present mainly occupied in the
keeping of personal records, led therein
by a chieftainess named Togram, in
which the conversations, peculiarities,
complexions and dresses of their friends
are set down and described with ferocious
bonhomie. The tablets containing these
records are then posted up in conspic-
uous places of resort, with the most
stimulating and entertaining results.
It is noteworthy that the ruler of the
country is not chosen from the danc-
ing or Bunihugoro section of the com-
munity, but from the powerful Renim
clan, who devote themselves intermit-
tently to the task of providing the
country with fuel. The chieftain wields
great power and is regarded with rever-
ence by his followers, but is in turn
expected to devote himself entirely
to their interests, and if he fails to
satisfy is promptly replaced by a more
energetic leader. As the great bulk
of the community yield allegiance to an
hereditary sovereign of strictly defined
powers this interesting country offers
the agreeable spectacle of a state in
which the dulness of constitutional
government is happily tempered by the
delights of industrial dictatorship.
T0 CERTAIN CAUTIOUS PROPHETS.
(Suggested by the almost invariable
form of the last sentence in the Weather
Report.)
YE watchers of the wind and rain,
Forgive me for becoming nettled
By your monotonous refrain:
“The further outlook is unsettled.”
When, on a bright and sunlit morn,
I rise refreshed and finely fettled
Your cue is not to cheer but warn :
“The further outlook is unsettled.”
They are too rare, these halcyon days,
When earth's a paradise rose-pet-
alled, -
For you to chill us with a phrase:
“The further outlook is unsettled.”
Too often have I shirked the goal
At which (as Scotsmen say) I ettled,
Discouraged by your words of dole:
“The further outlook is unsettled.”
For instance, lately I resigned
A trip to Shetland to be shettled;
Your menace made mechange my mind:
“The further outlook is unsettled.”
Henceforth I'm going to defy
You and your breed, inert, unmettled,
Who chant that sad Cassandra cry:
“The further outlook is unsettled."
Ay, if I held untrammelled sway
I'd have you bottled up and kettled
Like djinns, until you ceased to say:
“The further outlook is unsettled.”

PIGS.
“Pigs pays,” said Mrs. Pugsley.
“So I have heard.”
“Pigs always pays; but Pugsley's
pigs pays prodigious.”
I rejoiced with her.
“Took 'em up sudden, he did; and
now that interested! You'd never think
that pigs 'ld twine themselves round a
man's heart, so to speak, would you ?”
“ No.”
“That's how it is with Willum.

his only joy. In partnership with Uncle
Eliover them. First time Uncle Eli took
to anything wholesome in his life. When
Willum loses a pig he's that low that
he puts on a black tie. Wonnerful!"
Farmer Dodge scratched his head.
“Well, I've been asked to loan out
most things in my time, but never pigs
before. Where be taking them 2"
“Home.”
“That's a matter of better than two
miles. Have 'ee thought of the wear
and tear and the loss of good lard 2
No, Uncle Billy, I won't fly against
the will of Heaven. If pigs had been
meant to go for walks they'd have had
legs according. Their legs bain't for
walking; they 'm for hams.”
Uncle Billy drew near and explained.
Farmer Dodge grinned.

females in their place is meat and

for he'll eat his own size in meal any

Diadem lost—I should say Diadem's
lost to us.” Uncle Billy lifted his hat
reverently. “Theginger one is Comrade
—a fine name.”
“Why, 'tis a little sow.”
“And what better comrade than a
blessed female, my loving dear, and
who'd know that better than me?”
It was. I knew Willum,
otherwise Uncle Billy, and
something about his tastes.
I had the pleasure of meet-
ing him on the foreshore
that afternoon. No doubt
he was studying pigs; but
the title of the book he had
in his hand was Form at a
Glance. -
‘Pig form, I presume,”
said I politely.
“Now then, Missie, don't
go giving me away. All's
lovely at home. Me and
Uncle Eli has clubbed to-
gether to buy Bodger's
racing tips. Bodger's got

Bridegroom (twenty minutes late, excitedly, to Verger). “DoN'T TELL ME

“Don’t you go mixing
me up with the pigs, Wil-
lum ; I won't have it.
What's the name of that
perky black one?”
“Mount Royal,” said
Uncle Billy. “I’m a KING's
man and like to respect
they set over me. Royal
just means one of the
KING's family.”
The parade was dis-
missed; the herd returned
to its home and Uncle
Billy paid the cost of wear
and tear.
He sat smoking that
evening in a state of bliss-
ful content. All had gone
well; the dreaded black
moment was over. Mrs.
Pugsley knitted furiously
in silence.
“Now what might you
be turning over in that
mind of yours?” asked
where. Anyway we agreed when we
married to keep our purses in the same
drawer, and mine's bulging.”
“You are a brave man, Uncle Billy.
What about the day she will want to
see your pigs 2 "
“A thought that wakes me at night.
We keep 'em out in the country, I'd
have you know. There, why take a
fence before you come to it? There'll
be wisdom given.” -
Apparently there was, but the address
from which the wisdom came was in-
distinct.
“Willum,” said Mrs. Pugsley one day,
“to-morrow I'm coming to see they
pigs of yours; bless their fat sides' "
“You shall, my tender dear,” said
Uncle Billy. “Yes, to-morrow noon
you'll see the blessed things.”
Almost at dawn he presented himself
at Farmer Dodge's and astonished that
good man by asking to be allowed to
hire a few pigs for the day.
luxury is what you like but can do
without.”
In the end Uncle Billy drove a bar-
gain by which he secured the use of
six pigs for a few hours and paid three
shillings per pig. For three-and-six he
also hired the help of a boy to drive
them ; as he remarked, he could have
had more than another pig for that
money, but it would be warm work for
him alone.
The inhabitants of the houses on the
terrace of the little sea-side town where
the Pugsleys lived were thrilled at noon
by the arrival of a small herd of swine.
The animals looked rather tired but
settled down contentedly in the front-
garden of No. 3.
Mrs. Pugsley, hearing their voices,
came to the door.
“Why, Willum, I was just making
ready to come out with you to go and
see them.”
“My tender dear,” he said with emo-
Uncle Billy.
“Pigs.”
“Couldn't do better.”
“And their names. Maybe you won't
christen any more until after the
Cesarewitch.”
She folded up her knitting and went
to bed, leaving Uncle Billy as if turned
to stone. When he recovered he sought
out Uncle Eli and said:—
“Eli, she's known all along. She
knowed when I was driving they brasted
pigs here in the heat. She's never
been took in at all. And that's a
woman. That's what married me.”
“It would be wrong to enter upon political
questions in these pages, but there can be no
harm in suggesting that prayer should be
made as much for our rulers at Westminster
as for people in Ireland. The Collect, with
certain alterations, for Those at Sea would
seem especially suitable."

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
UNDENIABLY ours is an age in which fond memory fills
not only the heart of man but the shelves of the circulating
libraries to a degree bordering upon excess. But, let
reminiscences be even more frequent than they are, there
would yet remain a welcome for such a book as Mr. W. H.
MALLock's attractive Memoirs of Life and Literature
(CHAPMAN AND HALL). The reason of this lies not more in
the interest of what is told than in the fact that these
memories have the advantage of being recalled by one who
is master of a singularly engaging pen. Nothing in the
book better displays its quality of charm than the opening
chapters, with their picture of an old-world Devonshire,
and in particular the group of related houses in which the
boyhood of the future anti-socialist was so delightfully
spent. Gracious homes have always had a special appeal
to the author of The New Republic, as you are here re-
minded in a score of happy recollections. Then comes
Oxford, and that meeting with Sw1NBURNE in the Balliol
drawing-room that seems to have been the common ex-
perience of memoir-writers. Some entertaining chapters
give a cheerful picture of London life when Mr. MALLock
entered it, and Society, still Polite, opened its most exclusive
doors to the young explorer. The rest of the book is
devoted to a record of friendships, travel, an analysis of the
writer's literary activities, and a host of good stories.
Perhaps I have just space for one quotation—the prayer
delivered by the local minister in the hall of Ardverike:
“God bless Sir John; God bless also her dear Leddyship;

The Victorians used to talk, perhaps do still, about the
lure of the stage; but I am inclined to suppose this was
as nothing beside the lure of the stage-novel. All our
writers apparently feel it, and in most cases their bones
whiten the fields of failure. But amongst those of whom
this certainly cannot be said is Mr. HoRACE.A. VACHELL,
whose new book, The Fourth Dimension (MURRAY), has
both pleased and astonished me by its freedom from those
defects that so often ruin the theatrical story. For one
thing, of course, the explanation of this lies in my sustain-
ing confidence that I was being handed out the genuine
stuff. When a dramatist of Mr. VACHELL's experience says
that stage-life is thus and thus, well, I have to believe him.
As a fact I seldom read so convincing a word-picture of
that removed and esoteric existence. The title (not too
happy) means the world beyond the theatre, that which so
many players count well lost for the compensations of
applause and fame; and the story is of a young and pheno-
menally successful actress, Jess Yeo, in whom the claims of
domesticity and the love of her dramatist husband are
shown in conflict with the attractions of West-End stardom
and photographs in the illustrated papers. Eventually—
but I suppose I can hardly tell that without spoiling for
you what goes before the event. Anyhow, if I admit that
the ending did not inspire me with any sanguine hope of
happiness ever after, it at least put a pleasant finish on an
attractive and successful tale.
In the Mountains (MACMILLAN) is one of those pleasant
books of which the best review would be a long string of
quotations, and that is a very complimentary thing to say
about any novel. Written in diary form, on the whole
successfully, it tells little of doing and much of being, and
a great deal more of feeling than of either. It is scarcely

necessary after that to add that it is discursive. As a
matter of fact I found that for me that half of its charm
which did not lie in being whisked off, as it were by magic,
to sit in the sunshine of Switzerland lay in its author's
reflections upon subjects quite unconnected with her story,
and as far apart from each other as LAw's Serious Call and
the effect of different kinds of underclothing on the outward
demeanour of the wearer. From the human document
point of view it is as a picture of the convalescence of a
soul sick with grief that In the Mountains deserves atten-
tion. I cannot imagine that anyone who has ever got well
again after sorrow will fail to recognise its truth. The little
mystery and the slender love-story which hold the discur-
siveness together are just sufficient but so slight that they
shall not even be hinted at here. For the rest the book is
The title of Gold Must be Tried by Fire (MAcMILLAN)
might be called axiomatic for the precise type of fiction
represented by the story. Because, if gold hadn't to be tried
by fire, you might obviously marry the hero and heroine
on the first page and save everybody much trouble and
expense. Mr. RICHARD AUMERLE MAHER, however, knows
his job better than that. True, he marries his heroine early,
but to the wrong man, the Labour leader and crook, Will
Lewis, who vanishes just before the entrance of the strong
but unsilent hero, only to reappear (under an alias) in time
to get shot in a strike riot. Mr. MAHER's book comes, as
you may already have guessed, from that great country
where they have replaced alcohol by sugar, and where (per-
haps in consequence) heroines of such super-sentimentality
as Daidie Grattan have no terrors for them. Personally I

Peregrine in Love (Hod-
DER AND STOUGHTON) is a
story whose sentimental
title does it considerably
less than justice. It gives
no indication of what is
really an admirably viva-
cious comedy of courtship
and intrigue, with a colonial
setting that is engagingly
novel. Miss C. Fox SMITH
seems to know Victoria

long affection ; her pen-

the reader is a twofold interest, half in seeing what will
be to most an unfamiliar place under expert guidance, half
in the briskly moving intrigue supposed to be going on
there. I say “supposed,” because, to be frank, Miss Fox
SMITH's story, good fun as it is, hardly convinces like her
setting. You may, for example, feel that you have met
before in fiction the lonely hero who rescues the solitary
maiden, his shipmate, from undesirable society, and falls
in love with her, only to learn that she is voyaging to meet
her betrothed. At this point I suppose most novel-readers
would have given fairly long odds against the betrothed in
question keeping the appointment, and I may add that
they would have won their money. Not that Peregrine was
going to find the course of his love run smooth in spite of
this; being a hero and a gentleman he had for one thing to
try, and keep on trying, to bring the affianced pair ºl.
and thus provide the tale with another than its clearly pre-
destined end. Of course he doesn't succeed, but the attempt
furnishes capital entertainment for everybody concerned,
and proves that Mr. Punch’s “C. F. S." can write prose too.
Wellver under his wing it
became obvious enough that he was bent on reconstruct-
ing his own life as well as moulding Boone's. McCalloway,
when the seal of his past is broken, turns out to be
Sir Hector Dinwiddie, D.S.O., K.C.B., a tradesman's son
who was generally believed to have killed himself in Paris.
I must assume that Mr. CHARLEs NEVILLE BUck intended
us to recognise in Sir Hector a certain General whose name
acquired a painful notoriety not so long ago. The reader
may form what opinion he likes of the good taste of all
this, but there can be no question that the author has
drawn a fine character. At the outset his style is so
jumpy that the story is difficult to follow, but presently
its course grows clearer and I fancy that you will follow it
keenly, as I did, to the end.

LESSONS FROM NATURE.
To AN AUTUMN PRIMROSE.
“If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What man has made of man 2"
Wordsworth.
SYMBoI, of innocence, to Tories dear,
Whom I detect beside the silvan path
Doing your second time on earth this year
That I may cull a generous aftermath,
Let me divine your reason
For thus repullulating out of season,
Associated with the vernal prime
And widely known as “rathe,” why bloom so
late 2 -
Was it the lure of so-called “Summer-time,”
Extended well beyond the usual date?
Our thanks for which reprieve
Are SMILLIE's, though they didn't ask his leave.
Rather I think you have some lofty plan,
Such as your old friend Wordsworth loved to
sing ;
That for a fair ensample set to Man
You duplicate your output of the Spring;
That in your heart there lodges
Dimly the hope of shaming Mr. Hodges.
Ah! gentle primrose by the river's brim
Like Peter Bell (unversed in woodland lore),
He'll miss your meaning; you will be to him
A yellow primrose—that and nothing more;
He'll read in you no sign
Of Nature's views about the datum-line. O. S.
THE MINERS’ OPERA.
About a week ago, when they took Titterby away to the
large red-brick establishment which he now adorns, certain
papers which were left lying in his study passed into my
hands, for I was almost his only friend. It had long been
Titterby's belief that a great future lay before the librettist
who should produce topical light operas on the GILBERT
and SULLIVAN model, dealing with our present-day economic
crises. The thing became an idée fire, as the French say,
or, as we lamely put it in English, a fixed idea. There can
be no doubt that he was engaged in the terrible task of
fitting the current coal dispute to fantastic verse when
a brain-cell unhappily buckled, and he was found destroying
the works of his grand piano with a coal-scoop.
Most of the MS. in my possession is blurred and undeci-
pherable, full of erasures, random stage-directions and
marginal notes, amongst which occasional passages such
as the following “emerge” (as Mr. SMILLIE would say):—
“Secretary. The fellow is standing his ground,
He's as stubborn and stiff as a war-mule.
Minister. A
Means will be found
If we look all around
To arrive at a suitable formula.
Chorus. Yes, you've got to arrive at a formula.”
Difficult though my task may be I feel it the duty of
friendship to attempt to give the public some faint outline
of this fascinating and curious work. Scenarios, dramatis
personae and choruses had evidently caused the author
inordinate trouble, for at the top of one sheet I find —
“ACT I.
Interior of a coal-mine. Groups of colliers with lanterns
and picks (2 tongs). Enter Chorus of female consumers.”
Then follows this note:—
“MEM. Can one dance in coal-mine 2 Look up coAL
in “Ency. Brit.” Also cellAR FLAP;”
and later on, at the end of a passage which evidently de-
scribed the dresses of the principal female characters intro-
duced, we have the words:—
“BRITANNIA. 2 jumper, bobbed hair.
ANARchy. 2 red tights.”
Nothing in this Act survives in a legible form, but in Act II.
we are slightly more fortunate:—
“Scene.—Downing Street (it begins). Enter mired Chorus
of private secretaries, female shorthand writers and re-
presentatives of the Press, followed by Sir Robert
Honx E, Mr. RoPERT WILLIAMs and Mr. SMILLIE.”
What happens after this I can only roughly surmise, but
most probably Mr. SMILLIE proves false to Britannia and
flirts for some time with Anarchy, egged on by Mr. WILLIAMs
and urged by Sir Robert HoRNE to return to his earlier
flame. At any rate, after a little, the handwriting grows
clearer, and I read :-
“Mr. SMILLIE (striking the pavement with his pick).
We mean to strike.
Chorus. “He means to strike, he means to strike,
Rash man! Did ever you hear the like
Of what he has just asserted?
Living is dear enough now, on my soul,
What will it be when we can't get coal?
PRIME MINISTER (entering suddenly).
This strike must be averted.”
There seems to have been some doubt as to how the
PRIME MINISTER’s entrance should be effected, for at this
point we get the marginal note: “ ” From door of No. 10.
2 On wings. 2 Trap door. 2 Riding St. Bernard Dog.”
But the difficulty was evidently settled, and the Chorus
begins again:—
“Oh, here is the wizard from Wales—
The wonderful wizard from Wales,
The British Prime Minister,
MR. WILLIAMs. Subtle and sinister.
Chorus. Oh, no! That is only your fancy.
Disputes he can manage and check;
All parties respond to his beck.
MR. WILLIAMs. He talks through the back of his neck
Chorus. When he talks through the back of his neck
We call it his neck-romancy.”
Of the arguments used by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE after this
spirited encouragement no record remains but the following
passage:–
“My dear Mr. SMILLIE,
We value you highly
Howe'er so ferociously raven you.
We must find a way out,
And we shall do, no doubt,
If we only explore every avenue.
Chorus. Yes, please, do explore every avenue.

Apparently they have, for later on we get—
“PRIME MINISTER. Then why should you want to strike
When the Government saves your faces?

And the Chorus of course chimes in :-
“They can get more pay when they like
On the larger output basis.”
And there is a note at the side: “Chorus to wave arms up-
wards and outwards, indicating increased production of coal.”
It seems to have been at some time after this, and pro-
bably in Act III., that Titterby went, if I may put it so
vulgarly, off the hooks. I think he must have got on to
the conference between the mineowners and the represen-
tatives of the miners, and struggled until the gas became
too thick for him. At any rate, after several unreadable
pages, the following unhappy fragment stands out clear:-
“Mr. SMILLIE still stands irresolute, running his fingers
through his hair.

Nothing more has been written, and it must have been
at this point, I suppose, that Titterby got up and assaulted
his piano. It all seems very sad. Evoe.

THE LITTLE MOA
(and how much it is).
I HAVE been reading a lot about
Polynesia lately, and the conclusion
has been forced upon me that dining out
in that neighbourhood might be rather
confusing to a stranger.
Imagine yourself at one of these
Antipodean functions. Your host is
seated at the head of the table with a
large fowl before him. Looking pleas-
antly in your direction he says:—
“Will you have a little moa 2"
Not being well up in the subject of
exotic fauna you will be tempted to
make one of the following replies:—
(1) (With Alice in Wonderland in
your mind) “How can I possibly have
more when I haven't had anything at
all yet?”
(2) “Yes, please, a lot more, or just
a little more,” as capacity and appetite
dictate. -
(3) “No, thank you.”
The objection to reply No. 1 is that
it may cause unpleasantness, or your
host may retort, “I didn't ask you if
you would have a little more moa,” and
thus increase your embarrassment.
No. 2 is a more suitable rejoinder,
but probably No. 3 is the safest reply,
as some of these big birds require a lot
of mastication.
In the event of your firing off No. 3,
your host glances towards the hostess
and says—
“Oo, then " (pronounced “oh-oh").
To your startled senses comes the
immediate suggestion, “Is the giver of
the feast demented, or is he merely
rude 2''
Just as you are meditating an excuse
for leaving the table and the house, your
hostess saves the situation by saying
sweetly, “Do let me give you a little
oo,” playfully tapping with a carving-
knife the breastbone of a winged crea-
ture recumbent on a dish in front of her.
It gradually dawns upon you that
you are among strange birds quite out-
side the pale of the English Game Laws,
and that you will have to take a sport-
ing chance.
While you are still in the act of
wavering the son of the house says,
“Try a little huia.”
If you like the look of this specimen
of Polynesian poultry you signify your
acceptance in the customary manner;
otherwise, in parliamentary phrase-
ology, “The Oos have it.”
For my own part I fancy that, unless
or until some of these unusual fowls
are extinct, I shall not visit Polynesia,
but rest content with Purley. Our
dinner-parties may be dull, but at least
one knows one's way about among the
dishes.

THE CONSPIRATORS.
II.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The Third Inter-
national is not a Rugby football match.
it is a corporation of thrusters whose
prospectus announces that it will very
shortly have your blood, having first ac-
quired exclusive rights in your money.
Have you two acres and a cow 2 Have
you seven pounds three and threepence
in the Post-Office Savings Bank? Have
you any blood 2 Very well, then : THIS
CONCERNS YOU.
There was a meeting of shareholders
in Moscow as recently as July last.
The Chairman said: “Gentlemen—Ibeg
your pardon, Comrades, I am happy
to be able to report promising develop-
ments. Our main enterprise in Russia,
for technical reasons with which I will
not now trouble you, is not for the mo-
ment profit-producing ; but we have
been able to promote some successful
ventures abroad. In all parts of the
civilised world—and Ireland—we may
anticipate a distribution of assets in the
near future.” And among those assets
to be parcelled out are, I may say, your
acres, your cow, your savings and your-
self.
There followed a meeting of the
Executive Committee (I wish they
would avoid that tactless word “execu-
tive,” don't you?). Simple and brisk
instructions were drafted for foreign
agents, bidding them get on with it and
not spare themselves, or in any case not
spare anyone else. These were inscribed
on linen, which was folded over, with
the writing inside, and neatly hemmed.
Shortly afterwards a number of earnest
young men wearing tall collars and an
air of exaggerated innocence sought to
cross various frontiers and were sur-
prised and offended when rough and
rude officials stole their collars and set
about taking them to pieces.
I hate to speak slightingly of anyone,
but these world-revolutionaries have no
business to be so young. According to
my view a professor of anarchy and as-
sassination ought to be a man of middle-
age with stiff stubble on his chin. He
has no business to be a pale and per-
spiring youth, tending to long back hair
and apt to be startled by the slightest
sound when he is alone. And what a
lot of them write poetry, and such poetry
too ! That is the manner of the man
who is going to seize your house and
usurp your cow, while you will be
lucky if you are allowed a place on a
perch in your own fowl-house.
We had an opportunity of seeing
them in procession when a consignment
of these world-revolutionaries drove off
in state from Berne about the time of
the Armistice. I told you, last week,
that we had a Legation of them, very
kindly lent by the Moscow manage-
ment, and I also told you that our
Italian juggler had let us into the secret
of their midnight lucubrations, of which
we had duly informed the officials inter-
ested in such matters. We had front
places when the motor lorry called for
them and the military escort arrived to
assist all the passengers to take, and
keep, their seats. Into the lorry were
packed the Minister Plenipotentiary
and Envoy Extraordinary, the Chargé
d'Affaires, the First Secretary, the
Second Secretary, the Third Secretary,
the Legal and Spiritual Advisers and
the Lady Typist. Their features were
not easy to distinguish; when the Bol-
shevists assume dominion over us they
will not nationalize our soap. One
or two fell out, but were carefully re-
placed by willing hands and bayonets;
and so home.
Now that is a sight you don't often
see: a Diplomatique Corps being re-
turned to store in a motor lorry. The
disappointing thing about them was
that, for all their fiery propaganda and
for all their drastic resolutions, never
a one of them produced so much as
a squib-cracker. The only people to
derive any excitement from the affair
were the small children, who took it
for a circus.
The best they could do for us was a
general strike. What all this had to do
with trades or unions nobody seemed
to know, least of all the workers. But
there was an attractive sound about
the then novel phrase, “Direct Action,”
and it gave a sense of useful business
to that otherwise over-portly word,
“Proletariat.” And the local politicians,
promised good jobs in LENIN's millenn-
ium, made great use of the phrase,
“Dictatorship of the Proletariat.” Thus
many an honest workman joined in
under the belief that it meant an
extra hour's holiday on Saturdays, an
extra hour in bed on Mondays and an
extra bob or two of wages.
While it lasts, even a bloodless revo-
lution can be very tiresome ; almost as
disquieting as a general election. Every-
body who isn't revoluting is mobilised
to keep the revolution from being mo-
lested. There are no trams, because the
drivers are demonstrating; no shops,
because the shopmen are mobilised; no
anything, because everyone is out watch-
ing the fun. So you go into the square
to watch also. You see little groups of
revolutionaries looking sullen and la-
boriously class-hating. You see a lot of
soldiers looking very ordinary but try-
ing not to. The riff-raff scowl at the
soldiers, who are ordered out to shoot
at them. The soldiers scowl at the riff-
raff at whom they are ordered not to
shoot. And, for some reason which the
experts have not yet fathomed, it always
pours with rain.
When we had succeeded in persuad-
ing the soldier who was posted to guard
our hotel that we were not the prole-
tariat and might safely be let pass, we
found a gathering of inside-knowledge
people discussing the situation. The
Government ought to have known all
about it long before—how the Bolshev-
ists were stirring up trouble. “They
did,” said we ; “we told them.” There
was a silence at this, but a smile on the
face of the audience which we at first
mistook for incredulity. We referred
darkly to our private information, de-
rived, as I told you in my last, from the
Italian juggler. “Did he do juggling
tricks with your ink-pots too?" asked the
French element. “How much money
did you give him 2" asked all the other
elements. “And I suppose he also told
you,” said the Italian officer, “that he
had no conſidence in his own people
and that the British alone enjoyed his
respect 2"
At this moment the Americans came
in and asked us to quit arguing and
attend while they told us how they had
unearthed the great plot. . . . When
together we reckoned up the Italian
juggler's net takings we realised that it
is an ill revolution which brings no
one any good.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MYSTERY OF THE APPLE-PIE BEDS.
(Leaves from a holiday diary.)
I.
AN outrage has occurred in the hotel.
Late on Monday night ten innocent
visitors discovered themselves the pos-
sessors of apple-pie beds. The beds were
not of the offensive hair-brush variety,
but they were very cleverly constructed,
the under-sheet being pulled up in the
good old way and turned over at the top
as if it were the top-sheet.
I had one myself. The lights go out
at eleven and I got into bed in the dark.
When one is very old and has not been
to school for a long time or had an
apple-pie bed for longer still, there is
something very uncanny in the sensation,
especially if it is dark. I did not like it
mind. But the Barkers had two, and
the Barkers are a respected middle-
aged couple, and nobody could possibly
make them apple-pie beds who did not
know them very well. That shows you
it can't have been me—I—me—that
shows you I couldn't have done it. I
have only spoken to them once.
They say Mr. Barker was rather
annoyed. He has rheumatism and
went to bed early. Mrs. Barker dis-
covered about her bed before she got
in, but she didn't let on. She put out
the candle and allowed her lord to get
into his apple-pie in the dark. I think
I shall like her.
They couldn't find the matches. I
believe he was quite angry. . . .
IV.
I suspect Denys and Joan. They
unanswerable problem is, who could
have dared to make the Barkers' apple-
pie beds? And the answer is, nobody
—except the Barkers.
And there must have been a lady in
it, it was so neatly done. Everybody
says no man could have done it. So
that shows you it couldn't have been
me—I—myself. . . .
VI.
I suspect Mr. Winthrop. Mr. Win-
throp is fifty-three. He has been in
the hotel since this time last year, and
he makes accurate forecasts of the
weather. My experience is that a man
who makes accurate forecasts of the
weather may get up to any devilry.
And he protests too much. He keeps
coming up to me and making long
speeches to prove that he didn't do it.
at all. My young
brother-in-law, Denys,
laughed immoderately
in the other bed at my
flounderings and im-
precations. He did
not have one. I sus-
pect him. . . .
II.
Naturally the hotel
is very much excited.
It is the most thril-
ling event since the
mixed foursomes. No-
thing else has been dis-
cussed since breakfast.
Ten people had beds
and about ten people
are suspected. The
really extraordinary
thing is that numbers
of people seem to sus-
pect me ! That is the
worst of being a pro-
fessional humourist;
zºzºr-º-o-º-º-
*
“RIGHT-O.
IF YEit wants A FIGHT I'M READY.
AN' As we 'VE ONLY ONE PAIR
o' GLovEs, AN' You 'RE THE YoUNGEST, I'LL BE A SPORT AN' LET YOU WEAR 'EMI.”
But I never said he
did. Somebody else
started that rumour,
but of course he thinks
that I did. That comes
of being a professional
humourist.
But I do believe he
did it. You see he is
fifty-three and doesn't
dance, so he had the
whole evening to do it
111.
To-night we are go-
ing to have a Court
of Inquiry. . . .
VII.
We have had the
inquiry. I was judge.
I started with Denys
and Joan in the dock,
as I thought we must
have somebody there
and it would look
better if it was some-
everything is put down to you. When I
was accompanying Mrs. F. to-day she
suddenly stopped fiddling and said hotly
that someone.had been tampering with
her violin. I know she suspected me.
Fortunately, however, I have a very
good answer to this apple - pie bed
charge. Eric says that his bed must
have been done after dinner, and I was
to be seen at the dance in the lounge
all the evening. I have an alibi.
Besides I had a bed myself; surely
they don't believe that even a pro-
fessional humourist could be so bursting
with humour as to make himself an
apple-pie bed and not make one for his
brother-in-law in the same room | It
would be too much like overtime.
But they say that only shows my
cleverness. .
III.
Then there is the question of the
Barkers. Most of the victims were
young people, who could not possibly
are engaged, and people in that state
are capable of anything. Neither of
them had one, and they were seen slip-
ping upstairs during the dance. They
say they went out on the balcony—a
pretty story. . . .
V.
I suspect the Barkers. You know,
that story about Mrs. B. letting Mr.
B. get into his without warning him
was pretty thin. Can you imagine an
English wife doing a thing of that kind?
If you can it ought to be a ground for
divorce under the new Bill. But you
can't.
Then all that stuff about the rheu-
matism—clever but unconvincing. Mr.
Barker stayed in his room all the next
morning when the awkward questions
were being asked. Not well; oh, no!
But he was down for lunch and con-
ducting for a glee-party in the drawing-
room afterwards, as perky and active
as a professional. Besides, the really
body in the family. The first witness
was Mrs. Barker. Her evidence was
so unsatisfactory that I had to have
her put in the dock too. So was Mr.
Barker's. I was sorry to put him in
the dock, as he still had rheumatics.
But he had to go.
So did Mr. Winthrop. I had no
qualms about him. For a man of his
age to do a thing like that seems to me
really deplorable. And the barefaced
evasiveness of his evidence! He simply
could not account for his movements
during the evening at all. When I
asked him what he had been doing at
9.21, and where, he actually said he
didn't know.
Rather curious—very few people can
account for their movements, or anyone
else's. In most criminal trials the wit-
nesses remember to a minute, years
after the event, exactly what time they
went upstails and when they passed
the prisoner in the lounge, but nobody

seems to remember anything in this
affair. No doubt it will come in time.
The trial was very realistic. I was
able to make one or two excellent ju-
dicial jokes. Right at the beginning I
said to the prosecuting counsel, “What
is an apple-pie bed 2" and when he had
explained I said with a meaning look,
“You mean that the bed was not in
apple-pie order 2 " Ha, ha! Everybody
laughed heartily. . . .
VIII.
In my address to the jury of matrons
I was able to show pretty clearly that
tke crime was the work of a gang. I
proved that Denys and Joan must have
done the bulk of the dirty work, under
the tactical direction of the Barkers,
who did the rest; while in the back-
ground was the sinister figure of Mr.
Winthrop, the strategical genius, the
lurking Macchiavelli of the gang.
The jury were not long in considering
their verdict. They said: “We find,
your Lordship, that you did it yourself,
with some lady or ladies unknown.”
That comes of being a professional
humourist. . . .
IX.
I ignored the verdict. I addressed
the prisoners very severely and sen-
tenced them to do the Chasm hole from
6.0 A.M. to 6.0 P.M. every day for a
# week, to take out cards and play out
| every stroke. “You, Winthrop,” I
| said, “with your gentlemanly cunning,
your subtle pretensions of righteous-
ness—” But there is no space for
that. . . . -
X. -
As a matter of fact the jury were
quite right. In company with a lady
who shall be nameless I did do it. At
least, at one time I thought I did. Only
we have proved so often that somebody
else did it, we have shown so conclusively
that we can't have done it, that we find
ourselves wondering if we really did.
Perhaps we didn't.
If we did weapologise to all concerned
—except, of course, to Mr. Winthrop.
I suspect him. A. P. H.

Pamela's father, in one armchair, is making a praiseworthy

British Finance.” In another armchair Pamela's mother
is doing some sort of mending. Pamela herself, stretched
upon the hearthrug, is reading aloud interesting extracts
from a picture-book.

Dicky.
Her Father. What sort of dicky?

He spreads his wings out widely (you see them, not the dark)
And you hear the fairies whispering, “Hush! hush!” “I’ll
tell you!” “Hark!”
The bird is black and feathery, but his feet are made of gold;
He chiefly comes in summer-time, for fairies hate the cold;
And if the nights are velvet-dark and full of summer airs
He lingers till the sun creeps up and finds him unawares.
And so you'll see in summer-time, when all the dew is wet,
The footprints of his golden claws maybe will linger yet;
The little golden flower-buds will gleam like golden grain,
And if you pick and cherish them perhaps you'll dream again.

“HAvH. YoU EveR BEEN UP IN AN AEROPLANE, GRANDPA 2"
**-
<
“No, MY BOY—NOT YET.”
HONOURS EASY.
I.
Not very long ago the following
advertisements appeared in the same
column of The Southshire Daily Gazette:
“Lost, a pure black Pekinese dog, wearing a
silver badge marked “Cherub.’ Handsome
reward offered. F. B., Grand Hotel, Bright-
bourne.”
“Found, a black Pekinese, wearing a silver
badge marked “Cherub." No reward required.
The Limes, Cheviot Road, Brightbourne.”
II.
On the same morning the paper was
opened and scanned almost simultane-
ously by Mrs. Frederick Bathurst in
the sitting-room which she and her
husband occupied at the Grand Hotel,
and by Mr. Hartley Friend in the
morning-room at “The Limes.”
“Oh, Fred,” exclaimed Mrs. Bathurst,
“Cherub has been found. He 's all
safe at a house called ‘The Limes,’ in
Cheviot Road. Isn't that splendid?”
“Very good news,” said her husband.
“I told you not to worry.”
“It’s a direct answer to prayer,”
said Mrs. Bathurst. “But—”
“But what?” her husband inquired.
“But I do wish you had taken my
advice not to offer any reward. You
might so easily have left it open.
People aren't.so mercenary as all that.
It stands to reason that anyone staying
at an hotel like this and bringing a
dog with them—always an expensive
thing to do—and valuing it enough to
advertise its loss, would behave pro-
perly when the time came.”
“I don't know,” Mr. Bathurst replied.
“Does anything stand to reason 2 The
ordinary dog-thief, holding up an animal
to ransom, might be deterred from re-
turning it if no mention of money was
made. You remember we decided on
that.”
“Oh, no, I don't think so. You
merely had your way again, that was
all. I was always against offering a
reward. And the word ‘handsome' too.
In any case I never agreed to that.
You put that in later. Another thing,”
Mrs. Bathurst continued, “I knew it
in some curious way—in my bones, as
they say—that the fineness of Cherub's
nature, its innocence, its radiant friend-
liness, would overcome any sordidness
in the person who found him, poor dar-
ling, all lost and unhappy. No one
who has been much with that simple
sweet character could fail to be the
better for it.” -
Mr. Bathurst coughed.
“That is so 2" his wife persisted.
“Well,” said Mr. Bathurst, after
helping himself to another egg, “let us
hope so, at any rate.”
“It's gone beyond mere hope,” said
his wife triumphantly. “Listen to
this; ” and she read out the sentence
from the second advertisement, ““No
reward required.' There,” she added,
“isn't that proof 2 I'll go round to
Cheviot Road directly after breakfast
and say how grateful we are, and bring
the darling back.”
III.
Meanwhile at “The Limes " Mr.
Hartley Friend was pacing the room
with impatient steps.
“I do wish you would try to be less
impulsive,” he was saying to his wife.
“Anything in the nature of business
you would be so much wiser to leave
to me.”
“What is it now?” Mrs. Friend asked
with perfect placidity.
“This dog,” said her husband, “that
fastened itself on you in this deplorable
way—whatever possessed you to rush
into print about it?”
“Of course I rushed, as you say.
Think of the feelings of the poor woman

kind thing to do.”
“‘Poor woman' indeed I assure
you she's nothing of the sort. One
would think you were a millionaire to
be ladling out benefactions like this.
No reward required.' Fancy not even
asking for the price of the advertise-
ment to be refunded !”
“But that would have been so
squalid.”
“‘Squalid ' ' I've no patience with
you. Justice isn't squalor. It's—it's
justice. As for your “poor woman,'
listen to this.” And he read out the
Bathurst advertisement with terrible
emphasis on the words “Handsome
reward offered.” “Do you hear that
— handsome '2''
“Yes, I hear,” said his wife amiably;
“but that isn't my idea of making
money.”
“I hope you don't suppose it's mine,”
said her husband. “But there is such
a thing as common sense. Why on
earth the accident of this little brute
following us home should run us into
the expense of an advertisement and a
certain amount of food and drink I'm
hanged if I can see.”
“Well, dear,” said his wife with the
same amiability, “if you can't see it I
can't make you.”
IV.
A few minutes later the arrival of “a
lady who's come for the Peek” was
announced.
“No,” said Mr. Friend as his wife
rose, “leave it to me. I'll deal with
it. The situation is very delicate.”
“How can I thank you enough,” be-
gan Mrs. Bathurst, “for being so kind
and generous about our little angel?
My husband and I agreed that nothing
more charmingly considerate can ever
have been done.”
At this point Mrs. Friend followed
her husband into the room, and Mrs.
Bathurst renewed her expressions of
gratitude.
“But at any rate,” she added to her,
“you will permit me to defray the cost
of the advertisement 2 I could not allow
you to be at that expense.”
Before Mrs. Friend could speak her
husband intervened. “No, madam,”
he said, “I couldn't think of it. Please
don't let the mention of money vulgar-
ize a little friendly act like this. We
are only too glad to have been the
means of reuniting you and your pet.”

brated epigrams, preferring to throw in
her lot (platonically) with a young and
penniless social reformer, we took no
notice of those who feared a scandal
(“scandals are not what they were,” as
she said), nor of the girl's assertion
that she had no use for the alleged
romance of marriage. We were con-
fident that the little god whose image,
with bow and arrow, stood in the garden
of Dahlia's ancestral home, would put
things right for us in the end. Yet we
were not greatly annoyed when he made
a mess of his business and married her
to the wrong man; for in the mean-
time such strange things had been
allowed to occur and the right man
had proved such a disappointment that
we didn't much care what happened to
anybody.
It was the rejected lover, Mortimer
Jerrold, who conceived two bright ideas
for conquering her independence of
mind, apparently for the benefit of his
rival. First he contrived to get Harold
Glaive, the young socialist, selected as a
candidate for Parliament, hoping (if I
read the gentleman's motive rightly)
that his probable failure would touch
the place where her heart should have
been. This scheme did not go very
well, for he was chosen to contest the
seat held by Dahlia's own father (which
caused a lot of trouble), and in the
result beat him.
Meanwhile Jerrold had had an alter-

native brain-wave. He thought that
if he pinched the latchkey of Dahlia's
Bloomsbury flat, broke in at night, and
made a show of assaulting her modesty
he could prove to her that she was only
a poor weak woman after all. Nothing,
you would say, could well have been more
stupid. Yet, according to Mr. HASTINGs
TURNER's showing (and who were we
to challenge his authority ?) it came off.
We were, in fact, asked to believe that
a girl who had protested her freedom
from all sense of sex was suddenly made
conscious of it by the violence of a man
whose advances, when decently con-
ducted, had left her cold; and from that
moment developed an inclination to
marry him. An assault by a tramp or
an apache would apparently have served
almost as well for the purpose. If this
is “Every Woman's Privilege” it is
fortunate that so few of them get the
chance of exercising it.
Miss MARIE LöHR herself came very
well out of a play that can hardly add
to the author's reputation. Her per-
sonality lent itself to a part which
demanded a blend of feminine charm
with a boyish contempt for romance.
And she had a few good things to say.
It was not Mr. HALLARD's fault if he
failed to win our perfect sympathy for
a hero whom the heroine addressed as
“Spats.” As for Mr. BASIL RATHBONE,
who played the part of Harold Glaive,
I cannot imagine why he took it on.
Apart from his timorous declaration of
love, conveyed on a typewriter, there
was no colour in it, and nothing what-
ever to show why his passion petered out.
I think that the author, in his surprise at
the success of Harold's rival, must have
forgotten all about it. Mr. HERBERT
Ross was excellent as Dahlia's father,
a pleasantly futile baronet under the
thumb of a sour-tongued managing
female, an old-fashioned part in which
Miss HELEN Rous has nothing to learn.
Miss WANE FEATHERSTON, as the lady
who finally absorbed the baronet, did
her little gratuitous piece all right.
I cannot get myself to believe that
all these intelligent actors are under
any illusion as to the merits of the
comedy. With the best wishes in the
world for the success of Miss MARIE
LöHR's enterprises, I am bound to re-
gard it as yet another instance of a play
where the attractions of the leading
part have a little deranged the judgment
of the actor-manager.
“THE CROSSING.”
Mr. ALGERNoN BLAckwood and Mr.
BERTRAM Forsyth (assisted by Mr.
DoNALD CALTHROP) present to us in
The Crossing a certain Mr. Anthony
Grimshaw, a princely egotist of the
poetic-idealist type who gets up on the
hearth-rug and says to his family, “I
am a humanitarian before everything,”
and things like that, and then wonders
why his wife is estranged from him.
He has a daughter, Nirie, who is not old
enough to know how bad all this is, and
together they hear the wind singing
glees without words (or in Volapuk,
but anyway not intelligible to us poor
normals), a thing Mr. ALGERNoN BLACK-
wood has been doing or pretending to
do for years without once taking me in.
Anthony is run over and (as we say)
dies. After an extraordinarily tiresome
conversation in the morning-room with
his friend and his son and his mother
(who are also what people call dead) it
dawns upon him that something odd
has happened to himself also. His wife
and two children, after his (so-called)

death, become blissfully happy and set
to work to finish his book, that being,
as they think, his wish. Well, I won-
der. At any rate in death (as we say)
he was not divided—from his egotisms.
One knows well enough, alas, how
the temptation to spiritual drug-taking
has grown as the result of the accumu-
lated sorrows of these past years, but
it is not well that such a treatment
of the eternal question should be taken
seriously. Is this sort of thing really
better than the harp-and-cloud theory?
It is not. One looked in vain for any
trace of real vision, any true sense of the
height and depth of the problem.
Mr. MARSHALL struggled quite man-
fully with the part of Anthony, and of
course he had his moments. I hope
so good a player is not developing the
“actor's pause,” of which I detected
signs. Miss IRENE RookE had nothing
in particular to do and did it very well.
Mr. HUBERT HARBEN as the impenitent
profiteer from Lancashire, Anthony's
brother-in-law, was better suited than
I have seen him for some time, and
provided the very necessary relief. The
precocious children infuriated me, but
that is purely temperamental. The
actors who played the parts of those who
had “crossed " were wrapped in such
an atmosphere of gloom, to the strains
of such meretricious music that (on the
evidence) I can only advise people to
defer their crossing as long as possible;
a thing they will doubtless do, even if
they have a friendlier feeling to the new
religion than I can command. . . . I
am afraid I proved a bad sailor. T.

(With grateful acknowledgments to “The

WE had quite a hectic time at the
Philharmonic — I nearly wrote the
Phillemonade—concert last night, what
with two Czechs, Dabgik and Ploffskin,
slabs of WAGNER, and Carl Walbrook's
Humorous Variations, “The Quangle
Wangle,” conducted by Carl himself.
If the honest truth be told, we sat down
to the Variations with no more pleasur-
able anticipation than one sits down with
in the dentist's chair, preparatory to the
application of gags, electric drills and
other instruments of odontological tor-
ture. (Strange, by the way, that no
modernist has translated the horrors
of the modern Tusculum into terms of
sound and fury!) But we were most
agreeably surprised to find ourselves
following every one of the forty-nine
Variations with breathless interest. Mr.
Walbrook is indeed a case of the de-
formed transformed. We found hardly
a trace of the poluphloisboisterous pom-
posity with which he used to camou-
flage his dearth of ideas. His main
theme is shapely and sinuous, and its
treatment in most of the Wariations
titillated us voluptuously. But, since
it is the function of the critic to criticise,
let us justify our rôle by noting that the
scoring throughout tends to glutinous-
ness, like that of the pre-war Carlsbad
plum; further, that a solo on the muted
viola against an accompaniment of six-
teen sarrusophones is only effective if
the sarrusophones are prepared to roar
like sucking - doves, which, as LEAR
would have said, “they seldom if ever
do.” Still, on the whole the Wariations
arrided us vastly.

experience to hear the Bohemians, the

playboys of Central Europe, interpreted
in the roast-beef-and-plum-pudding
style of the Philharmonic at its beefiest
and plummiest. Dabgik survived the
treatment fairly well, but poor Ploffskin
was simply stodged under. But they
were in the same boat with RICHARD
the Elder, whose Venusberg music was
given with all the orgiastic exuberance
of a Temperance Band at a Sunday-
School Treat, recalling the sarcastic
jape of old HANs RichTER during the
rehearsal of the same work: “You play
it like teetotalers — which you are
not.” Yet the orchestra were lavish
of violent sonority where it was not
required; the well-meaning but unfor-
tunate Mr. Orlo Jimson, who essayed
the “Smithy Songs” from Siegfried,
being submerged in a very Niagara of
noise. WAGNER's scoring no doubt is
“a bit thick,” but then he devised a
special “spelunk” (as BAcon says) for
his orchestra to lurk in, and there is
no cavernous accommodation at the
Queen's Hall.
II.
Though fashion considers September
as an unpropitious time for the produc-
tion of novelties, the scheme arranged
for the patrons of the Philharmonic Con-
cert last night, under the direction of
Sir Henry Peacham, was successful in
bringing together an audience of emi-
nently respectable dimensions. The
occasion served for the launching under
favourable circumstances of what con-
stituted the chief landmark of the pro-
gramme—a set of orchestral variations
with the quaint title of “The Quangle
Wangle,” from the prolific pen of
Mr. Carl Walbrook. It is satisfactory
to be able to record the gratifying fact
that this work met with cordial accept-
ance. In the interests of serious art,
the borrowing of a title from one of the
works of a writer so addicted to levity
as Edward LEAR may perhaps be depre-
cated, but there can be no doubt of the
ingenuity and sprightliness with which
Mr. Walbrook has addressed himself
to, and accomplished, his task. If we
cannot discover in his composition the
manifestation of any pronounced indi-
viduality or high artistic uplift, it none
the less commands the respect due to
the exhibition of a vigorous mentality
combined with a notable mastery of
orchestral resource and mellifluous
modulation. At the conclusion of the
performance Mr. Walbrook was con-
strained to make the transit from the
artistes' room to the platform no fewer
than three times before the applausive
zeal of the audience could be allayed.
The remainder of the scheme was
copious and well-contrived. Pleasur-
able evidence of the friendly interest
shown in the fortunes of the Czecho-
Slovakian Republic was forthcoming
in the performance of two works by
composers of that interesting race—
Messrs. Dabgik and Ploffskin — of
which it may suffice to say that the
temperamental peculiarities of the
Bohemian genius were elicited with
conspicuous brilliancy under the inspir-
ing direction of Sir Henry Peacham. In
a vocal item from Siegfried, Mr. Orlo
Jimson evinced a sympathetic appreci-
ation of the emotional needs of the situ-
ation which augurs favourably for his
further progress, and the powerful
support furnished him by the orchestra
was an important factor in the enjoy-
ment of his praiseworthy efforts. An
almost too vivacious rendering of the
Venusberg music brought the scheme to
a strepitous conclusion. It may, how-
ever, be submitted that so realistic an
interpretation of the Pagan revelries
depicted by the composer is hardly in
accordance with the best traditions of
the British musical public.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE long-promised Herbert Beerbohm Tree (HUTCHINsoN),
than which I have expected no book with more impatience,
turns out to be a volume full of lively interest, though
rather an experiment in snap-shot portraiture from various
angles than a full-dress biography. Mr. MAX BEERBOHM
has arranged the book, himself contributing a short memoir
of his brother, which, together with what Lady TREE aptly
calls her Reverie, fills some two-thirds of it with the more
intimate view of the subject, the rest being supplied by the
outside appreciations of friends and colleagues. If I were
to sum up my impression of the resulting picture it would
be in the word “happiness.” Not without reason did the
TREES name a daughter FELICITY. Here was a life spent
in precisely the kind of success that held most delight for
the victor—honour, love, obedience, troops of friends; all
that Macbeth missed his exponent enjoyed in flowing mea-
sure. Perhaps TREE was never a great actor, because he
found existence too “full of a number of things”; if so he
was something considerably jollier, the enthusiastic, often
inspired amateur, approaching each new part with the zest
of a brief but brilliant enthusiasm. I suppose no popular
favourite ever had his name associated with more good
stories and wit, original and vicarious. Despite some enter-
taining extracts from his commonplace book I doubt if this
side of him is quite worthily represented; at least nothing
here quoted beats Lady TREE's own mot for a mendacious
newspaper poster—Canard d la Press. Possibly we are still
to look for a more official volume of reference; meantime the
present memoir gives a vastly readable sketch of one whose
passing left a void perhaps unexpectedly hard to fill.
In the prefatory chapter of Our Women (CAssell)
Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT coyly disclaims any intention of
tackling his theme on strictly scientific principles. The
warning is perhaps hardly necessary, since, apart from the
duty which the author owes to his public as a novelist
rather than a philosopher, the title alone should be a suffi-
cient guide. One would hardly expect a serious zoologist, for
instance, in attempting to deal with the domesticated fauna,
to entitle his work Our Dumb Friends. The book is divided
in the main between adjuration and prophecy. As a result
of their emancipation from economic slavery, Mr. BENNETT
expects women—women, that is to say, of the “top class,”
as he calls it—to adopt more and more the rôle of pro-
fessional wage-earners; but at the same time he insists
that they do not as yet take themselves seriously enough
as professional housekeepers. How the two functions are
to be combined it is a little difficult to see, but apparently
women are to retain a profession as a stand-by in case they
fail to marry or to remain married. At the same time
Mr. BENNETT takes it for granted that woman will never
relinquish her position as a charmer of man, or even the
use of cosmetics and expensive lingerie. Speaking neither
as a novelist nor as a philosopher, I cannot help feeling
that Mr. BENNETT is too apt to consider the things he
particularly likes about women to be eternal, and those
that he does not like so much to be susceptible of alteration
and improvement. Anyhow, it looks as if Our Men were
going to have rather a thin time.

Shall Plant (Hodder AND Stoughton). She might equally
well have called it The Successes of a Naughty Child.

ant insubordinations of Patuffa (whom I suspect of having
been encouraged by her too challenging name) both at home
and at the various schools from which she either ran away
or was returned with thanks. This is all mildly attractive
if only from the vivacity of its telling; but I confess to
having felt a mild wonder whether a child's book had not
got on to my table by error—when the grown-ups suddenly
began to carry on in a way that placed all such doubts at
rest. There was, for example, a Russian lady, godmother
of Patuffa, who escaped from somewhere and established
herself, with others of her kind, in an attic in Coptic Street.
My welcome for this interesting fugitive was to some extent
shaken by a realisation that she was (so to speak) a refugee
from the other side and, in a sense, a spiritual ancestress
of Bolshevism. Miss HARRADEN would however object,
and justly, that the clean-purposed conspirators of the
earlier revolution had little in common with the unsavoury
individuals who at present obscure the Russian dawn.
Soon after this, Patuffa's papa begins to go quite dreadfully
ever dropping into mere mawkishness. A great pity, I
think, that it was not published rather as based on childish
memories than as the actual printed script of a prodigy.
Moon Mountains (HURST AND BLACKETT) is a story which
with the best will in the world I found it impossible to regard
wholly seriously. The greater part of the scene is laid in
Darkest Africa, where the father of the hero, Peter (my hope
that the Peter habit had blown over appears to have been
premature), disappears at an early stage. The subsequent
course of events reminds me of the words of the musical-
comedy poet, popular in my youth, who wrote, “It were
better for you rather not to try and find your father, than
to find him "-well, certainly better than to find him as
Peter found his. Perhaps it would not be unfair to suppose
that Miss MARGARET PETERSoN had at this point her eye
already firmly fixed upon her big situation. Certainly the
course of Peter is rather impatiently and spasmodically
off the rails, even to
the extent of wishing |
to elope with her
governess and even-
tually losing all his
money and shooting
himself. There was
also a famous violinist
—well, you can see
already that Patuffa's
vernal experiences
were on generous lines.
It is to the credit of
all concerned that she
and her story retain
an appreciable charm

ditions.

dyeing blue of white chickens and searches among Californian
lilies and pine-trees for the soul of a hog unseasonably de-
funct. But, since this most uncharitable age refuses to
believe anything just because it is told it should, the peace-
ful pages of The Diary of Opal Whiteley (PUTNAM) are unfor-
tunately fussed over with a controversy that no one who
reads them can quite escape. Miss WHITELEY's diary is pre-
sented with every circumstance of solemn asseveration as the
unaided work of a child of seven, only now pieced together
by the writer after quite a number of years. If you care
to throw yourself into the argument you will certainly find
heaps of reasons for thinking unkind thinks, as the writer
would say, of the truth of this claim, particularly in the
completeness with which every incident is carried through
various stages to its literary finish; but, if you will be ruled
by me, you will try to forget anything but the book itself,
with its quite charming pictures of many animals and one
little girl, their understanding friend. The quaint idiom
in which the diary is supposed to have been written (or, of
course, was written) adds to the delight of a rather uncommon
feeling for nature at its simplest, while the scrapes for which
the small heroine receives (or, you may say, is alleged to
receive) well-deserved punishment preserve the book from
its kind; and if you have no rooted objection to characters
all of whom behave like persons who know they are in a
book there is no reason why you should not find it at
least passably entertaining.
Mr. F. BRETT YouNG's manner of presenting The Tragic
Bride (SECKER) is not free from affectation, and this is the
more irritating because his literary style is in itself admir-
ably unpretentious. But having recorded this complaint
I gladly go on to declare that his tale of Gabrielle Hewish
has both charm and distinction. I protest my belief in
Gabrielle both in her Irish and English homes, but my
protest would have been superfluous if Mr. BRETT Young
had not almost super-taxed my powers of belief. So also
with Arthur Payne ; he is a fascinating lad, and the battle
between his mother and Gabrielle for possession of him was
a royal struggle, fought without gloves yet very fairly.
All the same I caught myself doubting once or twice
whether any boy could at the same time be so human
and so inhuman. It is to Mr. BRETT YouNg's credit that
these doubts do not interfere with one's enjoyment of his
book, and the reason is that he is first and last and all the
time an artist.

And, if at first you don't succeed,
If you should hear the critics croak,
“As to your heroine's choice, you err,”
Just hand her to the other bloke—
That's what they did with MARIE
LöHR.
So shall creative art suggest
A world where people may revise
Their silly past, and realise
Those second thoughts which are the
best ;
Where, having seen the larger light,
A perfect liberty to hedge
And swap the wrong man for the right
Is “Every Woman's Privilege.”
O. S.
YET ONE MORE PLAN FOR IRELAND.
FEELING rather lonely because almost
everybody had entered for the great
Irish Problem Competition in the morn-
ing and evening press except myself, I
sat down and wrote the following solu-
tion, which I posted immediately to the
Editors of The Times and of The West-
minster Gazette :-
“SIR”—I began indignantly, for I
noticed all the best competitors begin
like that. In these Bolshevistic days I
should have preferred of course to have
started off with “Comrade”or “Brother,”
or even, since I was writing from the
heart of the country, have opened with
“Eh bor,” as people do in dialect novels,
but, fearing I might be disqualified, I
began, as I say, “Sir," and went on,
much as the other statesmen did :—
“In all the lengthy annals of this
Government, vacillation between weak-
ness and tyranny has never proved so
disastrous as it is proving in Ireland to-
day, and the conduct of that unhappy
country's affairs is now plunged in a
chaos so profoundly chaotic that it has
become a gross misuse of language to
call them affairs at all. Out of all this
welter and confusion two salient facts
are seen to emerge:–
“(1) No two Englishmen are agreed
upon a settlement that will at the same
time satisfy the just aspirations of Ire-
land and preserve the integrity of the
British Empire. -
“(2) No two Irishmen are either.
“At the same time the number of same
and carefully considered plans for the
government of Ireland was never so
great as it is to-day. When will our
incompetent Cabinet perceive that the
only way of warding off the stain of
perfidy which dogs their footsteps and
threatens to overwhelm them is to make
use of all these plans ? I put aside for
the moment the most violent proposals
of the extremists on either side, such as
that of the annexation of England by the
Sinn Fein Empire and that of the de-
portation of all Irishmen to the Andaman
Islands and the re-colonisation of the
country with correspondents to the daily
press; but between these two extremes
there surely lie innumerable solutions
which both can and ought to be em-
ploye'. I will only name here a few
of them :—
Asquith autonomy.
Dominion Home Rule.
DUNRAVEN autonomy.
GREY autonomy.
Red autonomy.
Government by Dhail Eireann.
Government by Dhail Ymaill.
Administration by the L.C.C.
Clan warfare. -
“And there are infinite shades and
variations of all these. -
“Every one of the policies I have
named, and as many more as possible,
should now be adopted at once, one
after the other, I suggest, for quarterly
eriods and in alphabetical order.
“But let there be no mistake. They
must be strictly enforced. It must be
impossible for Irishmen to come to
England in the future and say to her,
as they have so often said in the past,
‘You made us promises which, when
we leant on them, proved a broken
reed and turned to dust and ashes in
our mouths.'
“One of the bitterest reproaches that
is hurled, and hurled justly, at British
maladministration is that through all
the seeming variations of misgovern-
ment there has been in fact no change.
Dublin Castle remains where it did.
This must be altered at once. The site of
Dublin Castle must be moved every three
months. There must be infinite change,
and it must be infinitely thorough and
infinitely systematic, so that, side by
side with the continuous grievances of
all dissatisfied parties, will be the cer-
tain assurance that those grievances
will in strict rotation be remedied.
“The objection will, of course, be
raised that these continual changes
of government will involve a certain
amount of disorder; that one system
will scarcely be working before it is
superseded by another; that the rapid
alterations in the personnel of the judi-
cature, civil service and police will be
inconvenient; that everything, in fact,
will be in a muddle. But by how much
is not well-organised muddle to be pre-
ferred to unsystematic anarchy 2 And
as each type of government recurs in
due course will it not be found to work
more simply and satisfactorily 2
“To those who shrug their shoulders
and say that a series of kaleidoscopic
changes in Irish administration would
never be approved by the good sense
of the British electorate I can only
urge that it is precisely this attitude
of intolerance towards and ignorance
of Irish psychology which has rendered
our behaviour to Ireland for so many
centuries a by-word not only throughout
Europe but the whole civilised world
and the United States of America.
“I am, Sir, yours, etc.”
Through some accident or other,
either because I have not followed
exactly the prescribed rules of the com-
petition, such as writing on one side of
the paper only, or addressing it from
the National Liberal Club, or obtaining
the signature of five witnesses, my solu-
tion has not yet appeared in The Times
or in The Westminster Gazette either.
Feeling it a pity, however, that any
helpful suggestion should be lost at a
time when never in the annals of Irish
misgovernment has vacillation vacil-
lated so vacillatingly as it does to-day,
I have repeated my strong but simple
proposals here.
–
“Clever forgeries of Fisher notes are in
circulation in St. Pancras.
Last night, during the busy period, a num-
ber of publications in the Kentish Town dis-
trict were victimised.”—Evening Paper.
We had no idea that Kentish Town
was such a literary centre.
“Even Paris seems willing this season to
add a few inches to the length of skirts, and
six to eight inches is becoming the accepted
length for street wear. This is an excellent
length, not so long as to endanger the chic of
the costume, nor so short as to be unbecoming
in either sense of the word.”—Fashion Paper.
We refrain from any speculations as to
the previous length of these skirts be-
fore the “few inches” were added.

IN THE PockUT.”
ELIZABETH OUT WITTED.
“AN' when I dies they give me
fifteen pounds on the nail an' no
waitin’,” said Elizabeth triumphantly,
as she explained her latest insurance
scheme.
“On what nail?” I asked distrust-
fully. I could not understand why
Elizabeth felt justified in paying six-
pence per week for a benefit fraught
with so little ultimate joy to herself.
But she is the sort of girl that can
never resist the back-door tout. She
is constantly being persuaded to buy
something for which she pays a small
weekly sum. This is entered in a book,
and the only conditions are that she
must continue paying that sum for the
rest of her natural lifetime.
On these lines Elizabeth has “put
in " for many articles in the course of
her chequered career. She has had
fleeting possession of a steel engraving
of QUEEN VICTORIA, a watch that never
would go—until her payments ceased
—a sewing-machine (treadle), a set of
vases and a marble timepiece. The
timepiece, she explained, was destined
for “the bottom drawer,” which she
had begun to furnish from the moment
a young man first inquired which was
her night out.
As all these things were taken from
her directly her payments fell off, I
thought I had better give her the
benefit of my ripe judgment. “I
shouldn't buy anything on the instal-
ment plan, if I were you,” I advised.
“Some people seem to be made for the
system, but you are not one of them.”
“But I 'aven't told you wot I'm
buyin' now,” she said excitedly, putting
a plate on the rack as she spoke. I
ought to say she meant to put it on
the rack; that it fell two inches short
wasn't Elizabeth's fault.
“It was cracked -afore,” she mur-
mured mechanically as she gathered up
the fragments. “Yes, I pays a shillin'
a week an' I gets a grammerfone.”
“A what?” I gasped.
“A grammerfone — to play, you
know.”
“Where will it play ?” I asked
feebly.
“’Ere,” she said, waving a compre-
hensive hand; “an' it won't 'arf liven
the place up. My friend 'as 'ers goin'
all day long.”
I stifled a moan of horror, for I am
one of the elect few who loathe gramo-
phones, even at their best and costliest.
“Elizabeth,” I cried, tears of anguish
rising to my eyes, “let me implore you
not to get one of those horr–I mean,
not to be imposed on again.”
“I’ve got it,” she announced. “I
meantersay I've paid the first shillin'
an' it's comin' to-morrow. I 'ave it a
month on trial.”
The month certainly was a trial—
for me. Ours is not one of those old-
fashioned residences with thick walls
that muffle sound, and where servants
can be consigned to dwell in the bowels
of the earth. Every noise which arises
in the kitchen, from Elizabeth's bad-
inage with the butcher's boy to the
raucous grind of the knife-machine,
echoes through the house vid the study
where I work.
Thus, although Elizabeth kept the
kitchen-door shut, I found myself com-
pelled for one-half of the day to consider
an insistent demand as to the ultimate
destination of flies in the winter-time.
The rest of the day the gramophone
gave us K-K-K-Katie. (Elizabeth had
only two records to begin with.)

I became unnerved. My work suf-
fered. It began to trickle back to me
accompanied by the regrets of editors;
and to writers the regrets of editors
are the most poignant in the world.
The situation was saved by the most
up-to-date tout of the whole back-door
tribe. He persuaded Elizabeth to go
in for Spiritualism. Do not misunder-
stand me. You can be a Spiritualist
and also keep a gramophone, but, if
you are Elizabeth, you cannot keep
the two running at the same time if
you must pay a shilling per week for
each. When she sought my opinion I
strongly advised the séances, which I
said were cheap at the price ; indeed
I thought they were when the gramo-
phone departed.
It was now Elizabeth's turn to be-
come unnerved. She has a mind that
is peculiarly open to impressions, and
communion with the spirits unbalanced
her. She justified her expenditure of
a shilling weekly by placing the utmost
faith in them.
“I 'ad a message from them there
spirits larst night,” she informed the
one day, “an' they tell me I must
change my 'abitation.”
“What do you mean?" I asked,
startled.
“I put a message through, arskin'
them when I should get a settled young
man, an' they told me that the fates
are agen me in my present dwellin',
so if you'll ploase take my notice
from--—"
I will not go through the sickening
formula. Every housewife must have
heard it several times at least in the
past year or so. I accepted Elizabeth's
resignation and began to concentrate
on newspaper announcements. . But I
took an utter dislike to the spirits and
listened with cold aloofness when Eliza-
beth began, “I was talkin' to the spirit
of my young man larst night—"
“I didn't know you had the spirit of
any young man,” I interrupted.
“Yes, I 'ave. I mean Ned Akroyd,
'oo was drownded.”
Now I have never believed in the
alleged drowning of the said Ned. The
news—conveyed to Elizabeth by his
mate—that he had fallen from a ferry-
boat near Eel Pie Island seemed uncon-
vincing, especially as it happened shortly
after Elizabeth had lent him fifteen-
and-six.
“I 'ad quite a long talk with 'im,”
she went on. “Next time I'm goin' to
arst 'im about the fifteen-and-six 'e
borrowed, an' see if I can't get it back
some'ow.” -
How the spirit would have considered
this proposition is still uncertain, for
Elizabeth never returned to the séances.

THE CONSPIRATORS.
III.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Essential to that
millennium which our restless revolu-
tionaries are after is your head on a
charger and my head on a charger; pro-
vided both heads are present it may
be the same charger for all they care.
When you think of the importance
which we of the detested middle classes
attach to our heads and the regrettable
violence we might exhibit towards who-
ever called at our houses to collect them,
then it seems to me you must confess
to a sneaking admiration for the bravery
of the turbulent minority in attacking
so big a problem.
But when you get the inside details
of their schemes you find that dis-
cretion is not only the better part but
the whole of their valour. For arms
you find incendiary speeches; for am-
munition, viperish propaganda, and
for epoch - making action you have
nothing. In that “nothing” lies their
main ingenuity and strong hope. If
they can prevail on the masses to do
nothing, at the right moment, and to
go on doing nothing till there is nothing
left, then, say they, they will have
civilisation under; and if our heads
don't fall off of their own accord
then a thousand willing hands will be
stretched forward to pull them off.
You ask me how I know all this.
Close the doors so that we cannot be
overheard, and I will tell you. I buy
their continental newspaper—“organ ”
they prefer to call it, being rather
proud of the noise—and there I read
all that I want to know. It costs a
halfpenny a day, runs to six pages, is
well printed and brightly composed and
contains no advertisements. There is
generally a picture in thick black lines
in the centre of the first page. Blood
being the easy thing for the printer to
“feature,” the picture generally deals
with the cutting off of heads. If it
refers to the past, you and I are cutting
off the worker's head, severing from a
fine muscular body a noble head with
a halo to it. If it refers to the future,
the worker is having our heads off,
severing from a fat and uncontrolled
corpus a most unpleasant excrescence
in a very shiny top-hat.
To run a daily newspaper of that
“make-up,” without advertisements
and for subscribers of whom the larger
number, like myself, omit to pay their
half-penny, is not easy business. In
fact it is not business at all. The
question being raised as to where the
money came from, the producers tried
to allay our suspicion by making a great
show of an appeal for help. The pub-
lished results, which I give you in
their English equivalent, were much
as follows:–

The grand total of sixteen pounds,
nine shillings and eight-pence three-
farthings shows a magnificent spirit,
but wouldn't keep much more than a
couple of square inches of the front
page alive for more than one day.
Reverting, then, to the more pressing
question of the removal of our heads,
who is paying for the operation ?
He is a heavy-built octopus sort of
man of about forty-seven; a red cheery
complexion, rather more fat than mus-
cle, long grey hair tending to curl at
the extremes, and followed about by a
lady who acts as his secretary, calls
him “Master” and adores the ground
he walks on. They are married, but
not, I should hasten to add, to each
other; none of your dull orthodox prac-
tices for them. About his profile there
is an undeniable something which
makes his head a suggestive model for
sculpture. It is framed in a large,
white, soft silk collar, which falls grace-
fully over the lapels of the coat and is,
I am told, of a mode much worn among
the élite of the anarchist and atheist
world.
I've a friend here in the law-and-order
business who thought that, having re-
ported all the movements of this Master
of the Black Arts, he might find it
worth while to make his acquaintance
in the flesh. Indirect enquiry elicited
that the desire to get into touch, was
reciprocated, the attentions of the police
being insufficient to satisfy his sense
of importance. So the meeting was
arranged, and I was allowed to come
along too.
We were received in great state in a
special suite of the local hotel de luxe.
The Lady Secretary was there, over-
flowing with “Masters” and “Sirs,”
and obsessed by the fear that her idol
might not do himself justice in our
presence. A very touching instance of
human devotion: the fifth instance in
his case, I believe.
This is the gentleman who finances
the propaganda of destruction; we
asked him if that was not so, and he
answered, “Why, of course.” Had we
any fault to find with his protégé, the
admirable halfpenny daily 2 e had
noticed that its news was punctual and
exact. Then of what did we complain 2
“Of a certain exaggeration in the
leading articles,” said I, rubbing the
back of my neck and wondering how
long it would be there to rub and I to
rub it.
“But what newspaper leaders are
not exaggerated 2" he asked.
“Your editors should not be paid to
twist everything into an irritant,” I
protested.
“Of which of your great English
dailies is the editor not paid to twist,
as you put it 2" he asked.
knew that I had right on my side
and he had not. But still somehow I
seemed to be in the wrong all the way.
So my friend took the matter in hand.
He didn't argue. He just drew his chair
up to the Master's and asked him to
tell us all about himself, how he came
by his great ideals, what was the future
of the world as he foresaw it and how
he meant to arrange the universe when ||
at length he took over?
The Master, gently smiling his ap-
preciation of this recognition of his
Ego, gave voice.
To the lady it was all, of course,
above criticism : sublime, adorable. To
me the frankness of it and the im-
pudence of it was, I confess, amusing.
The world is out of joint; how good 'twill be
When Heaven is sacked and leaves the job
to me !
An agreeable, if wrong-headed, crank,
was my summary.
And this or something like it was my
friend's:– “b. U.S.A. of Eng, parents,
9.5.78; tinned meat business, Chicago;
6 months' h.l. for frauds in connection
with packing ; went to Mexico, but left
to avoid prosecution for similar frauds
on larger scale; prison in Belgium,
France, and England in connection
with illegal dealings in rifles (? for
Germany); apparently liable to more
prison in U.S.A. for crime unknown, if
returns there; won't say where he gets
his money from, but doesn't seriously
pretend it is his own.”
And when I came to go back over
the Master's two hours' chat about
himself, those are about the facts it all
boiled down to.
Yours ever,
(To be continued.)

THE KORBAN BATH.
[Korban—“It is a gift"—Hebrew (or some
such language).] - -
WITH some reluctance I return to
the subject of baths. I went into the
matter of bathrooms pretty carefully a
few months ago, but since I have been
in this hotel I see that there are one
or two aspects of hotel bathing which
still require attention. -
To begin with, there is the question
of the Korban or free bath. It is, of
course, a scandal that a bath should be
an extra, and an eighteen-penny one at
that. After all, what is the bathroom
The beginner at the game contents
himself with less complicated ruses.
Sometimes he has his bath late at
night, when the sentries have been
taken off; but, as the lights go out en
masse at eleven, even this operation has
to be carefully timed. There is nothing
much gloomier than a bath by candle-
light, except perhaps a bath in the dark.
Hundreds, however, of both sorts are
endured in this hotel.
. The more brazen or the more timid
simply walk into the bathroom fully
dressed during the day, carrying a num-
ber of dirty golf-balls in their hands,
and towels in their pockets and sponges
extremely courteous, not to say gallant,
old gentleman was severely lectured
by a lady for digging himself in on the
mat and maintaining his position there
till she emerged. She stated with, I
think, considerable force that she had
passed the age when a lady likes to be
seen coming out of a bathroom with
disordered locks; she also said that he
was ruining her chance of a Korban
bath by drawing attention to the fact
that there was somebody inside.
He replied with equal force that,
whenever he considerately withdrew
from the mat in order to let a lady
escape unseen, some less scrupulous
for 2 We are not charged extra for
smoking in the smoking-room or
drawing in the drawing-room; why
should we be bled for bathing in
the bathroom? At the same time
this practice does provide the
visitor with the wholesome sport
of Korban bathing. The object of
the game is, of course, to have as
many baths as possible which are
not put down in your bill; and
many are the stratagems which
are employed.
The true sportsman attempts
the feat just before dinner, because
at that time there are sentries
posted in every corridor. Osten-
sibly they are maids waiting to
assist any lady who has a crisis
while dressing, but no real pre-
tence is made that they are there
for any other purpose than to
charge you for as many baths as
possible. On my corridor there
is a post of no fewer than three
sentries, and it is extremely diffi-
cult to evade them. The only
thing to do is to get to know three
nice ladies on the same floor and
arrange for them to have a dress-
ing crisis simultaneously and go
on having it for about a quarter-
of-an-hour.
“NEveR You MIND IF 'E DID say YoU ’D Got A NECK
LIKE A CAMEL. 'TAIN'T NEARLY As LoNG As ALL THAT."
combatant (usually one of his
own daughters) immediately
rushed the position, and he was
not going to be had in that way
again, though as a matter of fact,
while they were arguing the mat-
ter out; somebody actually did
this, so he was.
Now what is the way out of
this dilemma 2 The only solution
I see is the Sponge System, by
which every competitor puts
down a sponge, as one puts down
a ball at the first tee. In this
way definite claims can be staked
out in rotation without conges-
tion of the avenues of approach.
I hope this system will be gener-
ally adopted next summer and, if
it is used in conjunction with my
Progress Indicator (which shows
by a moving needle what stage
the person bathing has reached),
it ought to work very smoothly.
But there must be no hanky-
panky, no sharp practice with
caddies ; every sponge must be
put down by one of the players
in person. And there must be
none of that regrettable collusion
between husband and wife which
has brought such discredit on the
present system.
This needs a good deal of organi-
sation. However smoothly the opera-
tion begins, one of the dressing crises
nearly always collapses too soon, and
the sentry catches you on your return
journey.
For the lady visitor the problem is
comparatively simple. I should men-
tion that it is a perfectly legitimate
manoeuvre to get your bath put down
to somebody else if you can do it; and
the crack lady-player usually wraps
herself in an unobtrusive bath-wrap,
shrouds her head, modestly conceals
her face, slips into a friend's room to
borrow some Crème-Limon and, after
an interval, rushes noisily out of the
friend's room to her bath, which, with
any luck, is charged to her friend's
account.
up their sleeves, and issue later fully
dressed with clean white golf-balls in
their hands. It is generally thought,
however, that this device is just a little
—I mean it's not exactly—you know
what I mean.
The Korban Bath Rules will probably
remain unwritten for many a day, but I
earnestly hope that before next summer
the traditions and etiquette of bath-
warfare as between individual hotel-
visitors will be codified and issued in
an intelligible form. At the moment
the most extraordinary confusion pre-
vails, and no one can tell whether any
particular stratagem will be hailed with
applause as a bold and legitimate
operation of war or universally con-
demned as a barefaced piece of bath-
hoggery. Recently, for example, an
There was a very bad case of this
the other day. A certain wife used to
entrench herself in the bathroom early
and remain in it till her husband—a
heavy and persistent sleeper—arrived.
When you rattled angrily at the door-
knob she said very sharply, “Who is
that?”—in itself a sufficiently disturbing
thing. Even in the present days of

WHEN AND IF.
(It is rumoured that Mr. BALFour is
shortly going to the House of Lords.)
WHEN BALFour goes to the Lords—
For the Upper Chamber's adorning—
The Lower House, if it has any nous,
Will have solid reason for mourning;
For he has no axes to grind;
His strategy injures no man,
And his keen sword play in the thick
of the fray
Is a joy to friend and foeman.
When BALFour goes to the Lords,
To strengthen that gilded muster,
'Twill be sad and strange if he has to
change
The name he has crowned with lustre;
For already there’s “B. of B.,”
A baron of old creation;
And Whittingehame is an uncouth name
For daily pronunciation.
If BALFour goes to the Lords,
Will the atmosphere, I wonder,
With the placid balm of its dreamful
calm
Bring his nimble spirit under?
Or will he act on the Peers
Like an intellectual cat-fish,
Or startle their sleep with the flying leap
Of a Caribbean bat-fish 2
If BALFour goes to the Lords—
But can the Commons spare him 2
Besides I'm sure that a coronet's lure
Is the very last thing to ensnare him;
And I'd rather see him undecked
With the gauds that merely glister,
In the selfsame box with PITT and Fox
And GLADSTONE–a simple Mister.
Still if he goes to the Lords,
Whatever his style and title,
For the part he has played in his
country's aid
'Twill be but a poor requital;
For he never once lost his nerve
When the outlook was most alarming,
And always remained, with shield un-
stained,
Prince ARTHUR, the good Prince
Charming.

PRISCILLA FAILS TO QUALIFY.
“So it runned out of its little grassy
place and went all round the garden,”
said Priscilla, emerging suddenly in
pink from under the table.
“What are you playing at now,
Priscilla?” I inquired.
“I’m a little pussy-cat.”
“And what is this?” I asked, point-
ing to the waste-paper basket which
she had planted beside my chair.
“It's the pussy-cat's basket of milk.
It's to drink when she's firsty,” she
explained.
I sighed. It did not appear to me
that the child's education was proceed-
ing upon proper lines. I had been
reading portions of the diary of Miss
OPAL WHITELEY, written when she was
seven years old, a work which has just
lifted for America the Child-authoress
Cup. I had hoped to find in Priscilla
some faint signs that the laurels lost
by Miss DAisy Ashford might be
wrested back. The latest feature in
nursery autobiography, so far as I
could gather, was to have a profound
objective sympathy with vegetables
and a faculty for naming domestic ani-
mals after the principal figures in class-
ical mythology. If you have these
gifts you get published by The Atlantic
Monthly, with a preface by Wiscount
GREY. But I doubted whether Priscilla
had them. I thought I would try.
“Priscilla,” I said, “be a little girl
again and tell me what flower you like
best.”
“Woses.”
“What do the roses say to each
other when you aren't there?”
“Oh, they don't say any fing,” she
said with great contempt.
This was bad. -
“Priscilla,” I continued, “what do
you call the dog next-door?”
“Bill,” she said; “but it's runned
away.”
“There you are ' " I exclaimed, turn-
ing to the child's mamma. “Bill, in-
deed ' If she were being properly edu-
cated she would be calling it Jupiter
Agamemnon Wilcox by now. Does she
ever speak to you at all of the star-
gleams amongst the cabbage-leaves?”
“I don't think there are any star-
gleams amongst the cabbages in this
garden,” she replied. “Only slugs.”
“I don't care,” I said; “the fact
remains that Priscilla ought to be con-
stantly wondering what the cabbages
do say to each other when they have
lonesome feels at night."
“Priscilla,” I began again, “in about
three years you will be seven years old
and quite a big girl. “What will you
play at then 2"
“Oh, I san't play at all,” she said.
“I sall go visiting and sopping.”
“Anything else?”
“Oh, yes, I sall have a knife.”
“A pocket-knife?”
“No, not a pocket-knife, a knife to
cut meat wiv, of course.”
I had forgotten this goal of maidenly
desires.
“And won't you go long walks in the
big woods with me and tell me the
names of all the flowers and what they
are thinking about?"
“Yes,” she replied rather doubtfully.
“Are there beasts in the woods?”
“Only rabbits, I think.”
“We must be very careful, then, 'cos
they're very wild creatures, aren't
they?”
“Oh, not very wild.”
“Will you buy a gun at the gun-sop
and soot them and we take them home
and eat them 2"
Bless the child, I thought, there
seems to be no getting her away from
this eating business.

Now, I thought, we shall perhaps
have something about the lullaby songs
of the trees and the willow that does

“Are there fiss in the lake?” inquired
Priscilla.
“Yes,” I said, “beautiful shining fish.”
“And sall we catch the fiss and put
them on the fire 2''
“I suppose we might,” I admitted.
“And will they sizzle?”

looked up.

FOR OURSELVES ALONE.
OUR hostess had taken us over to “Sheltered End,” the
pleasant country home of Mrs. Willoughby Brock, to play
tennis. As however there was only one court and quite a
number of young and middle-aged people were standing near
it with racquets in their hands and an expression on their
faces in which frustration and anticipation fought for supre-
macy, it followed that other beguilements had to be found.
My own fate was to fall into the hands of Mrs. Brock, whose
greatest delight on earth seems to be to have a stranger to
whom she can display the beauties of her abode and enlarge
upon the unusual qualities of her personality. She showed
and told me all. We explored the estate from the dog-kennel
to the loggia for sleeping out “under the stars;” from the
pergola to the library; from the sundial to the telephone,
* the only one for miles; ” and as we walked between the
purple and mauve Michaelmas daisies in her long herbaceous
“Oh, no,” said the Vicar; “please don't let me drive you
away. As a matter of fact, since there are so many here I
won't stay myself. But I wonder,” he addressed Mrs.
Brock, “as I am here, if I might use your telephone for a
moment 2 '' - -
“Of course,” said she.
“Thank you so much,” he replied; “yes, I know where
it is,” and with a genial and courtly salutation he moved
off in the direction of the house. . -
“Such a true neighbour !” said Mrs. Brock. “Ah! and
here is another,” she went on. And along the same path,
where the Michaelmas daisies were thickest, I saw a massive
woman in white, like a ship in full sail, bearing down upon
us, defending her head from the gentle September sun with
a red parasol. “This,” Mrs. Brock hurriedly informed me,
“is Lady Cranstone, who lives in the house with the green
shutters at the end of the village. Such a dear person 1
She's always in and out. The widow of the famous scientist,

was that some peo-
ple have the gift of
attracting friends
and others not ; and
what a strange thing
it is that where one
person has to toil to
make a circle others
are automatically
surrounded by nice
creatures; and asked
me if I had any views
as to the reason, but
did not pause for the
reply.
It was a warm
mellow day—almost

senses, although
nearly the last, ac-
cording to the calen-
dar—and Mrs. Brock

you know.”
I didn't know ; but
what does it matter?
By this time the
dear person was
within hailing dis-
tance, but she flew
no signals of cordial-
ity; her demeanour
rather was austere
and arrogant. Mrs.
Brock hurried to-
wards her to assist
her to her moorings,
and I was duly pre-
sented.
“I didn't intend
to come in again
to-day,” said Lady
Cranstone, whose
features still success-
fully failed to give to
the stranger any in-
dication of the be-
nignity that, it was
suggested, irradiated
her being.
“But you are al-
ways so welcome,”
in a monologue that I could enjoy the garden almost without
interruption. For a two and a half years' existence it cer-
tainly was a triumph. Here and there a reddening apple
shone. The hollyhocks must have been ten feet high.
“Ah! here comes the dear Vicar,” said Mrs. Brock suddenly,
and, rising up from a rose which I was inhaling (and I wish
that people would grow roses, as they used to do years ago,
nose-high), I saw a black figure approaching.
“He is such a charming man,” Mrs. Brock continued,
“and devoted to me.”
“Good afternoon,” said the Vicar. “How exquisite those
delphiniums are ' " he added after introductions were com-
plete; “such a delicate blue! I should not have intruded
had I known you had a party"—he waved his hand to-
wards the single tennis-court, around which the wistful
racquet-bearers were now (as it seemed) some thousands
strong, “but it is always a pleasure"—he turned to me—
“to be able to walk in this paradise on a fine day and
appreciate its colour and its fragrance. I find Mrs. Brock
so valuable a parochial counsellor too.”
“I think,” I said, not in the least unwilling to be tactful,
“I will see what the rest of our party are doing.”
said Mrs. Brock. “Lady Cranstone,” she continued to me,
“is kindness itself. She makes all the difference between
loneliness and—and content.”
Lady Cranstone picked a rose and pinned it in her mon-
umental bosom. “I don't know that I had anything in
particular to say,” she remarked. “I chanced to be passing
and I merely looked in; but since I am here perhaps you
would allow me to use your telephone * >
Mrs. Brock beamed her delighted acquiescence and the
frigate sailed on. “You’ve no idea,” said Mrs. Brock, “what
a friendly crowd there is in these parts. I don't know how
it is, but this little place of mine, modest though it is, and
unassuming and unclever as I am, is positively the very
centre of the district. It's like a club-house. How strange
life is! What curious byways there are in human sympathy!"
This being the kind of remark that is best replied to
with an inarticulate murmur, I provided an inarticulate
murmur ; and I was about to make a further and more
determined effort to get away when a maid-servant ap-
proached with a card.
Mrs. Brock took it and read the name with a little cry of
satisfaction. “Lord Risborough,” she said to me. “At

THE PASSING OF ALFRED.
Alfred is dead and with him has gone
John's last efforts at making and train-
ing pets. It has simply been one dis-
appointment after another. There was
Charles the monkey. Charles could
write his own name with a pen and
digest the creamiest shaving-stick with-
out making a lather. There was Joey,
the billy-goat, such an entertaining
fellow, who could pick up and set down
anything with his horns from a basket
to a dustnan. And then there was
Livo–immortal Livo. There never
was such a down-at-heel and unscrupul-
ous young ruffian of a mongrel terrier as
Livo, nor one that more completely con-
vinced people that he was a gentleman
of blood and a pure-souled spiritualist.
Of course there were heaps of other
pets as well, but just as they seemed
about to reach that stage of human in-
telligence so earnestly desired by their
young master they all suddenly died,
even as Alfred, the last of a long list,
gave up the ghost yesterday. '
Alfred was a trout. Not your ordinary
fly-jumping kind of trout, because there
is never anything ordinary about John's
pets. Alfred, for instance, had not lived
in water for three months. He simply
had no use for the stuff, and, as for
jumping at a fly, his nerves were far
too good for that sort of thing.
His attachment to John was com-
plete.
one else and the presence of his eight-
year-old master in the long grass was
sufficient to bring him erect on his tail,
where he would wag his fins and make
strange noises in cordial welcome. In
many respects he was the most superior
pet John has ever had. He could affect
boredom and his exhibition of the glad
eye was considered by John's eldest
sister to be positively deadly. It is, in
fact, true to say that his keen desire to
adopt as many human habits as pos-
sible often led us to mistake him for
one of ourselves. -
John, however, was not quite satis-
fied with his pupil until one bright
morning last week when Alfred dis-
played the first signs of having acquired
the Directional Wriggle. Strange as
it may sound, this very human trout
actually wriggled after John for a dis-
tance of five yards. Three days later
he pursued his master to the village
post-office and beat him by a short gill.
Yesterday, however, Alfred excelled
himself. John had left early for the
stream, and being in a hurry took
advantage of the thin plank crossing.
Now the plank is very slippery and had
been placed over the spot where the
stream is deepest. John crossed it
carefully enough, but looking back for
He would take food from no | . .
a second he suddenly noticed that Alfred
was following him. Before he could
raise his voice in protest the trout had
mounted the plank and was wriggling
across it. Then, horror of horrors' in
the middle of the plank the wretched
fish suddenly lurched, lost its foot-
ing, plunged into the water and was
drowned.
FLOWERS' NAMES.
WHAT THE FAIRIES WEAR.
IF only you walk with an open ear
And watch with an open eye,
There's wonderful magic to see and hear
By silently passing by;
In meadows and ditches, here and there,
You'll find the clothes that the fairies
Wear. - -
You can see each golden and silvery
frock -
In Lady's Mantle and Ladysmock;
There's Lady's Garter (which, I sup-
pose, . -
They wear with the cowslips called
Hose-in-hose);
The solemn fairies who ride on owls
Shroud their faces with Monkswood
cowls;
And there's other things besides fairy
dresses— -
There's Lady's Mirror and Lady's
Tresses. . - -
Bachelors' Buttons must be for elves
Who have to do up their clothes them-
selves; . . . .
And the tailor fairies use Fairy Shears,
Long cutting-grasses that grow by
meres;
And they mend their things with the
Spider-stitches,
Faint white flowers that you find in
ditches,
And Shepherd's Needle, which you'll
see plain
In every meadow and field and lane;
And when they've used them they grow
again.
If only you walk with an open ear
And watch with an open eye,
There's wonderful secrets to see and
hear
By silently passing by;
In meadows and ditches, here and there,
You'll find the clothes that the fairies
Wear;
And if you look when they think you've
gone
Perhaps you'll see them trying them on.

ROBBERY IN COURT.
THERE would seem to be some need
for watchfulness in our Courts of Justice
lest the customs and privileges which
to so great an extent have made them
what they are should be allowed to
lapse.
A great sensation was caused through-
out the legal profession the other day
when it was reported in the Press that
a witness, in giving evidence, made the
following remark:—“It goes in one ear
and out of the other. Perhaps that
is because there is nothing to stop it.”
The report stated that laughter fol-
lowed, and, if that was indeed the case,
then we have no hesitation whatever
in characterising it as a most unseemly
outburst. -
If witnesses are to be permitted with
impunity to snatch out of the Judge's
mouth the jokes which naturally arise
out of their evidence, our whole judicial
system will be imperilled. In offering
an explanation as to why “it goes in
one ear and out of the other,” the
witness committed a grave breach of
etiquette. That explanation, if made
at all, should have been made by the
Judge in the first place. Or if, after
due opportunity had been given, his
Lordship showed no desire to avail
himself of the opening, then the privi-
lege should have fallen to the examining
counsel. If he in turn waived it, it
should have been open to counsel on
the other side to snap up the chance.
We fail to understand how such a
remark, coming from a witness, could
have been allowed to pass without
rebuke from the Judge or protest from
the counsel, or some attempt at least
to maintain order on the part of the
usher.
THE CHANTRY.
GREY dust lies on his battered face;
The glories of his shield are dim;
Half vanished are the words of grace
Beseeching pity and peace for him
Along the Purbeck rim.
His hands are folded palm to palm
(Some fingers lacking on the right),
And at his peakéd feet the calm
Old lion shows he fell in fight,
As best became a knight.
The ivy shakes its tattered leaves
Where once he saw the painted pane; ,
The brooding, scurrying spider weaves
Where cloth of damask dyed in grain
Will never hang again.
With missal propped upon his helm
For him no drowsy chantor pleads;
But blackbirds in the darkening elm
Sing plain-song, and the Abbey meads
Retell their daisy-beads.

Prospective Maid. “WELL, THAT’s A BIT INQUIsITIVE, AIN'T IT, MUM 2 I DIDN'T Ask You why You R LAST GIRL LEFT You.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM as a rule very strongly against the form of pedantry
that hastens to cry “imitation " whenever a new writer
finds himself impelled to a theme of the same character as
that already associated with an old-established practitioner.
But in the case of The Lost Horizon (METHUEN) I find
myself overwhelmed. Consciously or unconsciously Mr. G.
CoLBY BoFLEY has produced a story that in matter and
treatment is so palpably a reflection of Joseph CoNRAD
that the likeness simply refuses to be ignored. It is in its
way a good story enough—an affair of adventure in South
America and on the high seas, with a generous sufficiency of
oaths and blood-letting; a tale moreover that gives evidence
(in spite of that distressing echo) of being written by one
who takes his craft with a becoming dignity of purpose.
One peculiarity of the Master has not only been borrowed
by Mr. BoFLEY, but exaggerated to his own undoing: I
mean the trick of introducing a character or group of char-
acters so clogged and obscured by the adhesions of the
uncommunicated past that not till this has been gradually
flaked from them do they emerge as figures in whom it is
possible to take an intelligent interest. In the present
instance this process is delayed for more than half the book.
As for the intrigue, that concerns a group of cut-throat
Europeans, who, having been ruinously involved in a South
American revolution, are now further plunged into the plots
of a scoundrelly African magnate and his conspiratorial
gang. For myself, I parted from them all with a feeling of
regret that they had not explained themselves earlier as the
entertaining villains that they turned out to be.
Manhood End (HURST AND BLACKETT) is the title, not
very cheery, that Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY has given to her
latest novel, a simple and quite human story of country
vicarage life, told sympathetically, but in too many words
for so slight a theme. The publishers are at the wholly
superfluous pains of urging you as a preliminary to read the
“turn-over of cover.” Don't! All you will find there is a
synopsis of the plot, just sufficient to destroy the slender
thread of your interest in its development. And I must
record a protest against the entirely unneeded Prologue, in
which total strangers sit round at a churchyard picnic on
the graves of the real protagonists, and speculate as to their
history. The tale itself is placed in Sussex (why this
invidious partiality of our novelists?), the actors being for
the most part clerical. The main interest is centred in
the matrimonial trials of the Rev. Frederick Rainbird,
whose bride, having married him in haste, repented at
leisure, eloped with the promising brother of a neighbouring
parson, repented more, returned to domesticity, ran away
again, and so on, da capo. Perhaps really these simple but
not short annals have a flavour that I have failed to convey.
Mrs. DUDENEY writes easily, but should avoid the snares
of originality. To say of her heroine's morning appearance
at the breakfast table, that she “stood in the tangle of a
delicious coffee smell,” may convey an impression, but at a
ruinous expense of style.
Michael Winter, hero of The Black Knight (HUTCHINson),
by Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick and CRosBIE GARSTIN, had led a
nice easy life till his father's nefarious schemes crashed,
bringing down in a common ruin half the small investors
in the country. Left penniless, he changes his disgraced

name and goes out to Canada to make good. There, on the
prairies, he puts in some hard honest work. But, in his
haste to be rich, the Black Knight, as they do in chess,
after moving straight, moved obliquely. In order to make
a coup out of a Wall Street cinch he helped himself to the
money of the bank of which he was cashier. Other people
who shall be nameless have done this sort of thing
before, and, after returning the “borrowed " cash, have
enjoyed a stainless prosperity. But Michael, through a
motor-car accident, just failed to put it back in time, and
had to do two years. But he had made a fortune, and on
emerging from prison returned to Europe to enjoy it.

Parisian environment and marries her. By chance she
learns the secret of the source of his wealth and leaves him.
statement of fact on page 301, sever, lines from the bottom,
which corroborates that on page 279, also seven lines from
the bottom, with Weathershaw's dramatic accusation, you
will understand what I mean and you will be left in con-
siderable doubt (as I was) of what the author means. Does
he suggest that Sir Cheville was never murdered at all?
After so much excitement that would be a sad pity.
The publishers of The Amorous Cheat (CHATTo AND
WINDUs) generously label it “an enthralling story of
domestic and stage life.” To which my comment must be,
that the domesticity supplied by the hero's family and
their quite uninteresting hesitations between town and
suburban residence are entirely nebulous and illusive, that
the stage as background has no significance one way or
In order to appease her
scruples and recover her he
signs away his goods for the
benefit of his father's cre-
ditors. What might have
been a too sugary conclusion
is saved by a pleasant touch
of corrective irony in the very
last line, where his wife ex-
presses a very human satis-
faction on finding that her
best necklace was not in-
cluded in the noble sacrifice.
I hope I shall not be sus-
pected of flattering Mr.
Punch's “PATLANDER" if I
admire the excellence of the
Canadian section, obviously
contributed by Mr. CRosBIE
GARSTIN, who has knocked
about most of the world
marked red on the maps.
Here his humour and vitality
are at their keenest. The
rest of a well-told tale I
attribute to Mrs. ALFRED
SIDGwick, with the exception
of a pugilistic episode, for
which I imagine that the
male fist was called in to
supplement her proper in-
experience.
I do believe that I have
caught a detective napping; a STRUCTIONs.

other, but that the impro-
priety upon which (I must
say frankly) the appeal of
the book seems to depend is
given without stint, in a
measure that certainly may,
for some readers, justify the
publishers' epithet. You will
understand therefore that I
experience a little natural
hesitation about suggesting
the intrigue. It is certainly
of the simplest—a mere ques-
tion as to whether Edward
and Vivian, casual acquaint-
ances of a restaurant, shall
or shall not spend a sequence
of week-ends together. The
lady is described as on the
stage, but she might as well
belong to a guild of art-
needlework. Edward is the
only question of importance,
and the week-ends; if you
ponder the significance of the
title you can probably guess
the rest. To be honest I
ought to add that Mr. BASIL
CREIGHTON wields an easy-
flowing pen, and that at
least one chapter certainly
is wickedly entertaining, in
the style of what we used to
call “Continental" humour.
To sum up, not a novel for
real private detective, one of the great infallibles of fiction.
Mr. J. S. FLETCHER's Exterior to the Evidence (HopDER
AND STOUGHToN) is one of those thrills in which any of the
characters might have committed the murder and there is
every reason, at times, to suspect that they have all had a hand
in it. Over the moorland there ran a path, and at a spot
known as Black Scar it came perilously near the edge of a
forty-foot drop, with rocks at the bottom. Over this precipice
went Sir Cheville Stanbury at midnight, a very odd cir-
cumstance considering his life-long familiarity with the path.
Weathershaw, the great detective called in to investigate the
matter on behalf of one of the suspects, took a line of his
own and eventually hit upon someone you and I would
never have thought of. We have this excuse, that we had
no idea of his existence until he was hit upon; but no more
had Weathershaw. Now I am not going to give away the
secret of this enticing affair, but I must dispute the detec-
tive's identification, on the last page but one, of the man
responsible for Sir Cheville's death. If you compare the
family reading or for the fastidious. The others may
even be enthralled.
The Diary of a Sportsman Naturalist in India (LANE)
contains an excellent collection of sporting anecdotes, and
dip where you may you will find none of them trivial or
tiresome. Mr. E. P. STEBBING states that his purpose in
selecting material from his note-books was “to emphasize
the necessity which exists of affording protection to the
game and other animals of India,” and, shy as some of us
are of purposeful books, there is no reason to be scared by
this one. In the first place Mr. STEBBING's purpose is one
which will generally be commended, and in the second he
achieves it in an absolutely unobtrusive manner. To sports-
men, and especially to those who have enjoyed the good
fortune of shooting in India, this volume will be extremely
welcome. The only cumbrous thing about it is its title.
Add that Mr. STEBBING is as profuse in his illustrations as
he is happy in his choice of subjects.

FALLING PRICES.
(With grateful acknowledgments to the Commercial
Statistician of “The Times.”)
SAD is the sight, but not so strange,
When the dead leaf to earth declines:
I have observed this annual change
As one of Autumn's surest signs;
But oh, how very odd it is
To mark the falling prices of commodities. .
One had supposed the boom of War
(Still raging with the desperate Turk),
Whose closure seemed past praying for,
Would carry on its hideous work
And swell for years and years -
The bulging waistcoats of our profiteers.
But lo! a lot of useful wares
Within my modest range have come;
Trousers, I hear, are sold (in pairs)
At three-fifteen—a paltry sum ;.
And you can even get
Dittos as low as thirteen pounds the set.
I can afford a further lump
Of sugar in my cocoa —yes,
And cocoa too is on the slump,
Its “second grade" now costs me less;
And green peas (marrowſat.)
Are down to fourpence. I can run to that.
And, though my coffers, sadly thinned,
May not command a home-killed ham,
And though the fees for pilchards (tinned)
And eggs (to eat) and strawberry-jam
Are still beyond my means
(The same remark applies to butter-beans);
Yet milk (condensed) and salmon (“pink"),
And arrowroot and pines (preserved)—
All “easier,” I am glad to think
These, and a soul not yet unnerved,
Shall keep me going strong,
Now that the price of boots is not so long.
O. S.
GONE AWAY!
It seems to me that our local Hunt wants waking up.
In some places, I believe, there are still people who
“cheerily rouse the slumbering morn” by hunting the fox
or the fox-cub, and, if one cannot let slumbering morns lie,
there is no jollier way of rousing them. But in our village
we hunt the 8.52. Morning after morning, if you watch
from a high place, you can see our bowlers and squash hats
just above the hedgerows bobbing down to the covert side.
That one bobbing last is me.
As we trudge homeward under the star-lit skies all our
racy anecdotes are of the fine fast runs we have had with
the 8.52, the brave swinging of the tail carriage, the heavy
work over the points, the check and find again at East
Croydon main . . . . Those who arrive early at the meet in
the morning (but, as I have hinted, I am not one of these)
stroll about the platform, I am told, talking of the rare
old times when the 8.52 used to be the 8.51, pulling out
their watches every now and then and saying to the
station-master, “She's twenty-five seconds late,” for all
season ticket-holders have special permission from the rail-
way company to put trains into the feminine gender. This
is a slight compensation for having to pay again when
they are challenged and can only pull out a complimentary
pass to the Chrysanthemum Show.
As for myself, no one can say that I lack the sporting
spirit, and if I am late in the field it is because there is
not enough noise and bustle about our Hunt. It needs, I
submit, the romantic colour and pageantry that fire an
Englishman's blood and rouse him irrevocably from his
marmalade.
In this connection, as we say so charmingly at our
office, I have laid certain preliminary proposals before
Enderby and Jackson. A lot of the sportsmen who hunt
the S.52 in our village do so in motor-cars, which is hardly
playing the game. Of the stout-hearted fellows who follow
on foot, both Enderby and Jackson pass in front of my
house and may be discerned dimly through a gap in the
hedge, which was probably made for that purpose by the
previous tenant. Or it may have been because the gate-
latch sticks and he did not jump well. Enderby asserts
that my house is mine minutes from the station, and Jackson
says it is six, and therein lies the whole difference between
optimism and pessimism. All I know is that, if I gather my
hat, coat, Times, stick, pipe, tobacco and matches and put as
many as possible of them in appropriate places just after
Enderby has passed the gap, I catch the 8.52 nicely. If I
do these things just after Jackson has passed I catch it
nastily, just about the rear buffers. My proposal is that
Enderby and Jackson should encourage me a little by
wearing scarlet coats, so that I can see them twinkling
more brightly through the gap in my hedge, and if they
will do this I will promise to provide them both with hunt-
ing horns. I have pointed out that a “View halloo” from
Enderby, followed by a stirring
“Tantivvy, Tantivvy, Tantivvy;
Tra la, Tra-la, Tra-la”
from Jackson, will, if any power on earth can do it, bring
me from my toast in time for my train in the morning.
I have explained to them that nothing can be pleasanter
or more beautiful for the baker, the butcher and the grocer
to look at every morning than Enderby and Jackson dressed
in pink, with a despatch-case in one hand and a hunting-
horn in the other. There must be other sportsmen situated
as I am, and I should like to see all the little lanes stream-
ing with pink coats; and it would be very nice too if they
all brought their dogs to see them off, as some do already.
I am quite prepared to admit that neither Enderby nor
Jackson sees eye to eye with me in this matter. They argue
that ample notice is given of the imminent arrival of the
8.52 by the express train which passes through the cutting
at 8.43, and is popularly known as “the warner.” I have
replied that I cannot hear express trains when I am eating
toast, and that the only warner I recognise is PLUM WARNER,
who cannot by any stretch of language be called an express
train. There the matter rests at present, and I suppose in
a few days I shall miss the 8.52 again. -
Happily I have now found out what to do when this
occurs. Enderby and Jackson believe that the next train
is the 10.15; but that is their narrow-minded parochialism.
They are quite wrong. About ten minutes after the 8.52
has gone away another perfectly good train steals panting
from the undergrowth. When one has missed the 8.52 one
cannot wait on the platform till 10.15, nor, on the other
hand, having waved an airy good morning to the butcher,
the baker and the grocer as I trotted along, can I very
well go back and undo it. And then the derision at home,
the half-drunk stirrup-cup of coffee standing tepid and for-
lorn. But, as I say, the 9.5 is a perfectly sound train. It
is quite true that it goes to Brighton, but the weather has
been very warm of late. I hate these splits in the local
Hunt, but there it is. Evoe.

August 4th, 1914.—Declaration of
War. I hereby take a solemn oath not
to relax my efforts to win this struggle
for England, even if it costs me my
last drop of ink.
Began my series of powerful articles
by calling for KitchENER, of whom I
now, if guardedly, approve. Lunched
at the Carlton and dined at the Ritz
to let all the world see that I am not
downhearted. * * *
Spent the morning at the War Office,
showing everyone how the work there
ought to be done. Then to Downing
Street to put things right there.
Lunched at Claridge's with six Lead-

I have been wondering to-day if any
other military journalist could possibly
know such a lot of the Smart Set, and
so intimately as I do. I am extra-
ordinary lucky in having all these nice
people to fall back on when I am worn
out with War-winning and Tribunal
duties.

Wrote a wonderful article on the
importance of dressing up some one to
look like HINDENBURG and dropping
him at night by parachute from an
aeroplane into the German lines near
Head-Quarters. It would have to be a
biggish man who can speak German
well—Mr. CHESTERTON perhaps, but I
have never met Mr. CHESTERTON, as he
seems never to lunch or dine at the
Ritz; or even Lord HALDANE. Once
safely landed (my article goes on to
explain) he would make his way to Ger-
man H.Q., being mistaken for the real
HINDENBURG, kill him and then issue
orders to the Army which would quickly
put the Germans in our power. Strange
that no one else has thought of this.

It is very awkward to be the only
man in London who has the truth in
him. Relieved some of my embarrass-
ment by a glass or two of remarkable
1794 brandy. , , ,
WINSTON came to Carryon Hall to
dine and we discussed his future. I
mapped out the next six months for
him very carefully, and he promised to
follow my counsel; but I am afraid that
Lady RANDOLPH may interfere.

on all criminals to cease their labours
during the War, in order to release the

which was very tiring, lunched at the

CHECK BY THE QUEEN.
I HAD never before seen the Fairy
Queen in such an agitated condition.
She came dashing in, her cheeks glow-
ing, her eyes aflame, her tiny form
positively quivering with indignation
and excitement.
In her hand she held a small scrap of
paper, which she waved about in a
frantic manner just in front of my nose.
“Look,” she said, “ look My Press
Agency sent it me this morning. Did
you ever hear of such a thing? It's
outrageous, it's incredible, it's . . . . .
Oh, don't sit staring there as if it didn't
matter. Can't you say something—
suggest something 2"
“Your Majesty,” I said humbly, for
one has to be a little careful when
dealing with incensed Royalty, “I
haven't been able to read it yet.”
“Oh, I'm so sorry,” she said with
quick contrition; “I'm afraid I'm apt
to get a little carried away when I'm
upset. But surely this is more than
anybody could be expected to stand,
mortal or immortal.”
She settled down on the desk in front
of me, spreading out the crumpled bit
of paper on the blotter and holding the
ends down with her little hands.
“There,” she said—“read it.”
this is what I read:—
“M–'s FAIRY RING DESTROYER.
After prolonged experiments we have suc-
ceeded in producing a preparation which
checks the growth of unsightly rings on
Lawns, &c. Two pounds of the Destroyer
per square pole is sufficient for a single dress-
ing. Full particulars with each consignment.”
And

“Unsightly said the Queen in a
trembling voice. “Do you see that 2"
and she pointed to the offending word
with a tiny forefinger. “‘Prolonged

ren;ember now that I have had com-
plaints from some of our Garden Settle-
ments about discomfort; but of course
I never dreamed of anyone doing it on

in her bright eyes—“that it's really
true that human beings are beginning
to get tired of us? That we're "—she
dropped her voice and I saw that she
could hardly get out the next words—

Her falling tears made tiny marks
on the blotting-paper.
“Of course not,” I said stoutly. “On
the contrary, you're coming in stronger
than ever.

fashionable crazes, like motor-scooters
and cinema stars and indiscreet me-
moirs.” I hardly knew what I was
saying, it was so dreadful to see her
cry.
Why, one might almost
“Oh, I hope not,” she said, half-
laughing and hastily dabbing her nose
with a ridiculous atom of swansdown
which she produced from a minute
reticule.
“As to these gentlemen,” I continued,
pointing contemptuously to the an-
nouncement, “we’ll very soon settle
them.” I seized a sheet of paper and
began scribbling away as hard as I
could go.
The Queen amused herself meanwhile
by balancing on the letter-scales. She
seemed almost happy. I heard her
murmur to herself, “Dear me. Two
ounces. I shall have to start dieting.
No more honey ; :
“There,” I said presently, “send
them that, and we shall see what we
shall see.”
This is what I had written —
“We, Titania, Queen of Fairyland,
Empress of the Kingdom of Dreams,
Grand Dame of the Order of Absolute
Darlings, etc., etc., beg to draw the
attention of Messrs. M to the en-
closed paragraph, impinging gravely on
the ancient and indisputable rights and
prerogatives of ourselves and our loyal
subjects, which appeared in their recent
seed catalogue. We feel that the inclu-
sion of the aforesaid paragraph must be
due to some oversight, since Messrs.
M– can hardly be unaware of the fact
that it is only owing to the co-operation
of ourselves and our subjects that they

shall be obliged to take steps accord-
ingly, in which case Messrs. M are
warned that the whole of next year's
flower crop may prove an utter and
complete failure. Given under our
Royal Hand and Seal. TITANIA R.”
The Queen seemed very pleased when
I read it over to her.
“It's perfectly splendid,” she said,
clapping her hands. “How silly of
me not to have thought of it; but I
was so distracted. Won't it make them
sit up 2 And of course we could do it
easily, though it would be rather dread-

him ill. Extraordinary, isn't it? But
—don't tell anyone—I never quite
understand myself what they are or
where they split, though it certainly
does sound very uncomfortable.”
I reassured her on that point.
“Oh, then that's all right,” she said;
“and I don't think even he would ever
have thought of ‘impinging'; it's lovely,
about me, radiant and shining. I shut
isn't it? Thank you very much indeed,”
she added, as she folded up the paper
and slipped it under her girdle. “You

I opened them she was gone.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CONSPIRATORS.
IV.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, The other even-
ing I was sitting at an open-air café
whose coffee is better than its social
reputation. To be exact it is a low
haunt. I always go there and have
a cup of coffee in a glass when I am
wondering what to do next and feeling
it is about time something was happen-
ing. One of my acquaintances came
and sat down at my table. To confess
the truth he has once been a pickpocket,
the sort of professional who followed
the trade in the old dull days of peace
for the excitement it furnished. He
has since served in the Foreign Legion,
and says that now he cannot bring
himself to return to his normal work,
since by contrast it is so very tame.
For a time he was stranded, but now
“I am now a Young Socialist,” said
my friend with great pride. The Young
Socialists are the worst communists
there are.
“Really?” said I; “the last time we
had a chat you were an ardent German
Monarchist.”
He produced his Matriculation card;
it wasn't in his proper name, but, as he
explained, one name is as good as an-
other and he has had so many from
time to time that now he cannot rightly
say which is his own. I asked him
to elaborate the Young Socialists' pro-
gramme of murder and sudden death, a
subject which, as a proposed victim,
had a morbid fascination for he. He
said he knew nothing about that ; their
everlasting talk bored him and he never
attended the public meetings. It was
the committee work which interested
him.
door for the committee assembled inside.
And, when he thought the friendship
was sufficiently advanced, he poured
forth his inmost heart to that door-
keeper. He said that Young Socialism
was to him the breath of life, and the
tragedy was that he was always kept
on the outskirts of it. He said he would
give anything to take part in a com-
mittee meeting, or anyhow to hear the
great ones at it; and, to make this
sound plausible, he expounded a scheme
of Young Socialism of his own, which
was far more drastic and bloodthirsty
than anything that had yet occurred
to any committee.
The door-keeper didn't believe there
could be anybody who really cared all
that much for communism; for his part
he kept the door because there was
money to be made easily that way. At
the next committee meeting he made
the international con-
spiracy business provides
him with just the sport
he was looking for.
After a little conver-
sation about pocket-pick-
ing, as it used to be in
the good old days, he
asked me if I was inter-
ested in communist plots.
I said I was interested
in anything. He looked
round the café to see that
all was well, leant across
the table and asked me ! : º ſº */ #4% % -

more money and made it
more easily, and my friend
was safely locked up in
the cupboard before the
committee arrived. What
with the heat inside, the
thought that the door-
keeper might be more cun-
ning than had appeared
and a persistent desire to
sneeze, he questioned all
# the time whether he was
*|the right man in the right
place. The committee
meanwhile did little more
than vote its own salaries
from the central fund and
quarrel amongst itself who
should be treasurer.
Later proceedings of the
committee, as noted in the
He grew suspicious; why was I so
interested 2 There is always a lot of
whispering and mutual suspicion about
on these occasions. I told him of these
letters I was writing to you on the sub-
ject. This made him more than sus-
picious; positively hostile. Who was
this Charles? he wanted to know. I
told him all about you; explained that
you were a good friend of mine; quite
all right—one of us.
He rather took to the description of
you, dropped all signs of doubt or
anxiety and wondered if we couldn't
get hold of you to come and take coffee
with us one evening? You may rest
assured, Charles, that there is now one
café in Central Europe where you are
regarded as a first-class fellow, even
though your acquaintance has yet to be
made; bon camarade; not above picking
a pocket or two yourself in a moment of
enthusiasm. You must come here and
show yourself one day. You need have
no fear. We never pick each others'
pockets; it isn't considered etiquette.
He told me about the first committee
meeting he attended. He wasn't a
member of the committee at the time,
a fact which put difficulties in the way
of his attending the meeting, as it was
held behind closed doors. All the doors
were closed and locked, including the
cupboard door. He was in the cup-
board. I wondered what they would
have done to him if they had found him
there. He told me he had had plenty
of time to wonder that himself when he
had once got himself locked in.
“Begin at the beginning,” said I.
It was a question, first, of getting
round the door-keeper. He made friends
with that door-keeper, took him out to
supper, gave him a kirsch with his
coffee and a cigar with his kirsch. He
told the door-keeper that he was the
most distinguished door-keeper he had
ever met. He encouraged him to go
through his ailments and his grievances
and was visibly distressed by the recital.
He got in the habit of sitting with the
door-keeper while he was keeping the
cupboard, were more interesting. When
the question turned on finding some-
one trustworthy and competent to
take secret instructions to comrades in
France and England, my friend very
nearly burst forth from his shelf to
say to them, “I'm your man "
He restrained himself, however, and
thought out a more elaborate scheme
than that.
He secured a front seat at the next
public meeting of the section, applauded
vigorously when the President referred
to the need of more briskness in France
and England and asked for a private
interview after the meeting was over.
In a few well-chosen words he offered
his services to run messages over the
frontier. Off his platform the President
was quite a practical man and, though
he didn't use these words, he indicated
to my friend as follows: “If you are a
genuine blackguard the police won't let
you go ; if you are not a genuine black-
guard you are not really one of us."
My friend said that that would be all

right, and they agreed to meet later on.
He then went to the police and ex-
plained that he was about to be en-
trusted with important letters to carry
over the frontier, if they would afford
the necessary facilities. The police also
were practical and, without wishing in
any way to hurt his feelings, raised the
question of his being genuine. Genuine
was, of course, the very last thing he was
claiming to be, but he understood what
they meant, said that that would be all
right and arranged a later appointment.
He then called on the President and
found him duly suspicious.
“I’ve had a talk with the police,”
said my friend, “and I've told them all
about you and your messages, and they
are going to give me the facilities and
I am going to give them the messages.”
This was the first occasion on which
the President had had to handle the
plain truth, and he didn't know what
to do or say next.
“Give me some dud messages, of
course,” said my friend, and the Presi-
dent, thinking what a bright young
Socialist this was, complied.
He then went back to the police.
“I’ve had a talk with the President,”
said he, “and I’ve told them all about
you and your interest in the messages,
and here the messages are; and you
needn't worry to read them because
they are dud.”
The police had also got so unused to
the truth from such quarters that they
were taken aback when they met it.
“And now have I your full confi-
dence?” said he, and they said that he
might take it that he had. He then
went back to the President.
“Good morning, Mr. President,”
said he. “I have given your messages
to the police and told them they are
dud messages, so that now I have their
full confidence and can move about as I
like. Give me the real messages and
I'll be getting on with my journey.”
Throwing precaution to the winds,
the President wrote out the real mes-
sages in full and handed them to him.
“Come, come, come,” said he, “you
must be more careful than that,” and
he told him what he ought to do to
make sure. He did it.
My friend then proceeded to the
frontier, where, by arrangement, he
was arrested. In the inside pocket of
his inside coat a bundle of messages
were found. The police nodded at him.
“Yes,” they said, “here are the
messages all right. We don't know
that they help much, but we suppose
that we mustn't blame you.”
“Come, come, come,” said my friend,
“if you doubt me, search me.” They did
so, and, written on linen and sewn into
the lining of his coat, they found some
more messages, which really did help
them. Yours ever, HENRY.

“YEs, A NicE LITTLE BUs.
MIGHT BE capsized—what?”
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SH00KER.
John Antony Grunch was one of the
mildest, most innocent men I ever knew.
He had a wife to whom he was devoted
with a dog-like devotion; he went to
church; he was shy and reserved, and
he held a mediocre position in a firm
of envelope-makers in the City. But
he had a romantic soul, and whenever
the public craving for envelopes fell off
—and that is seldom—he used to allay
his secret passion for danger, devilry
and excitement by writing sensational
novels. One of these was recently
published, and John Antony is now
dead. The novel did it.
Yet it was a very mild sort of
“shocker,” about a very ordinary murder.
The villain simply slew one of his
typists in the counting-house with a
sword-umbrella and concealed his guilt
by putting her in a pillar-box. But it
had “power,” and it was very favour-
ably reviewed. One critic said that “the
author, who was obviously a woman,
had treated with singular delicacy and
feeling the ever-urgent problem of female
employment in our great industrial
centres.” Another said that the book
was “a brilliant burlesque of the fashion-
able type of detective fiction.” Another
wrote that “it was a conscientious
analysis of a perplexing phase of agri-
cultural life." John thought that must
refer to the page where he had de-
scribed the allotments at Shepherd's
Bush. But he was pleased and sur-
prised by what they said.
What he did not like was the inter-
pretation offered by his family and his
friends, who at once decided that the
work was the autobiography of John
Antony. You see, the scene was laid
in London, and John lived in London;
the murdered girl was a typist, and
there were two typists in John's office;
and, to crown all, the villain in the
book had a boar-hound, and John him-
self had a Skye-terrier. The thing was
as plain as could be. Men he met in
the City said, “How's that boar-hound
of yours?” or “I like that bit where
you hit the policeman. When did you
do that?” “You,” mark you. Oldfriends
took him aside and whispered, “Very
sorry to hear you don't hit it off with
Mrs. Grunch ; I always thought you
were such a happy couple.” His wife's
family said, “Poor Gladys' what a life
she must have had " His own family
said, “Poor John what a life she must
have led him to make him go off with
that adventuress!" Several people
identified the adventuress as Miss
Crook, the Secretary of the local
Mothers' Welfare League, of which
John was a vice-president.
The fog of suspicion swelled and
spread and penetrated into every cranny
and level of society. No servants would
come near the house, or if they did they
soon stumbled on a copy of the shocker
while doing the drawing-room, read it
voraciously and rushed screaming out
of the front-door. When he took a
parcel of washing to the post-office the
officials refused to accept it until he
had opened it and shown that there
were no bodies in it.
The animal kingdom is very sensitive
to the suspicion of guilt. John noticed
that dogs avoided him, horses neighed
at him, earwigs fled from him in horror,
caterpillars madly spun themselves into
cocoons as he approached, owls hooted,
snakes hissed. Only Mrs. Grunch re-
mained faithful.
But one morning at breakfast Mrs.
Grunch said, “Pass the salt, please,
John.” John didn't hear. He was read-
ing a letter. Mrs. Grunch said again,
“Pass the salt, please, John.” John was
still engrossed. Mrs. Grunch wanted
the salt pretty badly, so she got up and
fetched it. As she did so she noticed

that the handwriting of the letter was
the handwriting of A Woman. Worse,
it was written on the embossed paper of
the Mothers' Welfare League. It must
be from Miss Crook. And it was. It
was about the annual outing. “Ah,
ha!” said Mrs. Grunch. (I am afraid
that “Ah, ha!” doesn't really convey
to you the sort of sound she made,
but you must just imagine.) “Ah, ha!
So that 's why you couldn't pass the
salt | "
Mad with rage, hatred, fear, chagrin,
pique, jealousy and indigestion, John
rushed out of the house and went to the
office. At the door of the office he met
one of the typists. He held the door open
for her. She simpered and refused to go
in front of him. Being still mad with
rage, hatred, chagrin and all those other
things, John made a cross gesture with
his umbrella. With a shrill, shudder-
ing shriek of “Murder!” the girl cantered
violently down Ludgate Hill and was
never seen again. Entering the office,
John found two detectives waiting to ask
him a few questions in connection with
the Newcastle Pig-sty Murder, which
had been done with some pointed instru-
ment, probably an umbrella.
After that The Daily Horror rang
up and asked if he would contribute
an article to their series on “Is Bigamy
Worth While?”
Having had enough rushing for one
day John walked slowly out into the
street, trying to remember the various
ways in which his characters had com-
mitted suicide. He threw himself over
the Embankment wall into the river, but
fell in adinghy which he had not noticed;
he bought some poison, but the chemist
recognised his face from a photograph
in the Literary Column of The Druggist
and gave him ipecacuanha (none of you
can spell that); he thought of cutting
his throat, but broke his thumb-nail
trying to open the big blade, and gave it
up. Desperate, he decided to go home.
At Victoria he was hustled along the
platform on the pretence that there is
more room in the rear of trains. Finally
he was hustled on to the line and elec-
trocuted.
And everybody said, “So it was true.”

ERNEST EXPERIMENTS.
THERE is no doubt that Ernest was
to blame. I know, of course, that he
meant well. But a passion for fresh
air, unless it is checked in time, is
bound to lead one into all sorts of
trouble.
You see, Ernest suffers so from
theories. He has theories about eating,
sleeping and waking, talking and think-
ing; but those on fresh air are the
worst (or perhaps I ought to say the
best) of all. Not that we, who constitute
his family, would object to his theories
if he didn't get us involved in them as
well; but that is exactly what does
happen. There was, for example, the
camping-out proposition.
It began with Mother sitting at a
table one evening in the early autumn
and jotting down figures. Her brow
was troubled. “We really can't afford
a holiday this year, girls,” she said,
“ though I suppose we shall have to.
What with the price of everything just
now and ” She then went on to
speak with hostility of things like the
Government and Sir ERIC GEDDEs,
though she is a peaceable woman as a
rule.
Whereupon Ernest, who was at the
open window engaged in a little quiet
biceps-training (we won't allow him to
do the more rowdy muscular exercises
in the living-room), remarked, “But
why should we be subjected to these
eternal trammels of civilisation ? Isn't
the open country man's rightful herit-
age?”
“I see the prices have gone up at
the select boarding-house where we
stayed last year and met such nice
people,” went on Mother, ignoring
Ernest. “It's five guineas a week
each now.”
“Monstrous,” put in Ernest again.
“Five guineas a week just to breathe
the pure air of Heaven.”
“Oh, they give you more than that,”
said Mother, “though I suspect the
meat isn't English.”
Ernest laughed sardonically. “Now
let me tell you of my plan,” he said,
taking a newspaper cutting from his
ocket. “Here is my solution to the
holiday problem, and it certainly doesn't
cost five guineas a week. Why not
adopt it 2 ”
“Why, it's an umbrella,” commented
Mother, feeling for her glasses. “But
surely you don't expect it to rain all the
time 2''
“That is not an umbrella, it is an
illustration of a portable tent,” ex-
plained Ernest. “The canvas folds
up and can be carried in the pocket,
while the pole also folds and is con-
vertible into a walking-stick by day.

“It may be all right for throwing off
the shackles of convention,” remarked
Mother, “but nothing would induce me
to undress in a thing like that.”
“But when it's erected it's perfectly

“So am I,’” said Mother, “and I like
room to turn round. No, Ernest, I am as
fond of fresh air as anyone—you know
I always have my bedroom window open
at least two inches at night—but air is
not everything. Give me a comfortable
bed and good catering if I am to go on
holiday and enjoy it. You can please
yourself.”
That is the mistake Mother made.
Ernest ought not to be allowed to
please himself. He doesn't know what
is good for him. And, when he de-
parted on his walking tour accompanied
by his tent, his sponge-bag, a copy of
OMAR KHAYYAM, but very little else,
Mother felt uneasy.
“What will happen if you get your
feet wet?” she asked. “I'm sure you
ought to take more things with you,
Ernest.” -
“What more do I want 2" he de-
manded, “‘A loaf of bread beneath the

“A loaf of bread indeed!” echoed
Mother. “Fiddlesticks! Mind you get
at least three good meals a day.” She

to spend our holidays and told him to

It was the hour of dinner at the
Select Boarding Establishment (sep.
tables, 3 mins. sea, elec. lt., mod.) where
we had spent ten days of our entirely
select holiday. Everyone was assem-
bled in the lounge hall waiting for the
gong to announce the meal. Mother,
basking her soul in the atmosphere of
gentility, was chatting with the half-
sister of a bishop, who was just re-
marking that Mother must call on her
in town, when a strange fracas was
heard at the back of the hall; a mo-
ment later a strange figure thrust itself
in our midst and looked wildly round.
“Ernest!” murmured Mother faintly.
She was a wise woman to know her
own child under the circumstances.
Perhaps she identified the tent-pole to
which he was still clinging. Otherwise
he was scarcely recognisable. His hair
was wild and unkempt, his clothing torn
and damaged. His boots clung to his
feet by the uppers only and were held
together by fragments of a sponge-bag.
“Mother!" said Ernest, singling her
out from amongst the gay throng. The
moment was dramatic.
“I—I was arrested,” went on Ernest.
He spoke in a purely conversational
tone, but it's surprising how far the
human voice will carry at times. Every-
body about the place, including the
lift-boy and the Belgian waiter, seemed
to hear that remark.
“Arrested 2" whispered Mother in
reverberating tone-waves.
“Yes. How was I to know that I
had pitched my tent on private pro-
perty and was unwittingly trespassing?
They would have prosecuted me if I
hadn't—”
“You had better come up to my
room and explain there,” interposed
Mother; and we followed her, a broken
woman, to the lift. People fell aside
to make a passage for us.
Mother held up until she got to her
own room. Then she sat down and
cried. “Why did you disgrace us like
this?" she asked at last of Ernest.
“Was it necessary for you to come
here 2''
“I had to,” said Ernest apologeti-
cally. “You see I hadn't any money."
Mother looked up quickly. “But
what of the extra ten pounds I insisted
on your taking with you in case of
emergency?"
Ernest appeared slightly shame-
faced. “Well, when those fatuous
asses hauled me up for trespassing they
left me in the charge of a gamekeeper
while they 'phoned for the police. I
induced the chap to let me go, and I
had to square him with a tenner."
There was a long pause. Mother's
mind seemed to be working at some
abstruse calculation. Then she dried her
eyes and looked up with the triumphant
smile of the woman who gets the last
word and wins her point.
“And so, Ernest,” she said, “it did
cost you five guineas a week to ‘breathe
the pure air of Heaven' after all."
PRAWLING'S THEORY.
(By a Student of Jargon.)
By the courtesy of Professor Praw-
ling, F.R.S., who has supplied us with
the MS. of his recent lecture before the
Psycho-Economical Society, we are in
a position to give our readers a full
account of that masterly and epoch-
making address, of which, strange to
say, no adequate notice has so far ap-
peared in any newspaper.
Professor Prawling's credentials, we
may premise, are of a nature to inspire
the utmost confidenze. His father,
Theodore Prawling, was the inventor
of the speedle, that remarkable imple-
ment, fully described by Punch in the
early seventies, which rendered possible
the emulsification of all gelatinoid sub-
stances and revolutionised the mar-
malade industry. He is duly com-
memorated by the fine statue which is
one of the principal features of Dundee.
His son, however, has even greater

OF THE ROAD.”
claims on our respect and admiration.
Educated at the High School, Crieff,
and the Universities of Glasgow, Upsala,
the Sorbonne and Princeton, he is gene-
rally recognised in the United States
as the foremost authority on Paedo-
logical Gongorism and the cognate
science of Mendelian Economics.
. The problem with which he grapples
in his latest contribution to these fas-
cinating studies may be tersely summed
up in a single sentence: Can a healthy
metabolism be superinduced on an
economic system already showing
symptoms of extrinsic conglucination ?
Professor Prawling is of opinion that
it can, but only if and when the evils of
co-partnership and co-operation have
been neutralized by a diastolic synthesis.
To compute exactly the extent to which
these evils have been developed he has
devised a syncretic abacus, in which,
on the principle of the spectroscope,
the aplanatic foci are arranged in
fluorescent nodules each equidistant
from the metacentre. With a frank-
ness that cannot be too highly com-
mended, Professor Prawling admits
that this instrument is founded on
BENTHAM's Panopticon. But the devia-
tions from BENTHAM and the ex-
pansions of his machine are far more
remarkable than the resemblances to it.
Prawling—if he will allow us the fam-
iliarity—is not a utilitarian. His aim
is to re-establish our textile pre-emin-
ence by reconciling monistic individual-
ism with the fullest solidarity of the
social complex. He is meticulously
careful in stressing the point that the
demarcations arrived at by the use of
his abacus are not absolute, but con-
ditioned by EINSTEIN's theory of rela-
tivity. The ancillary industries, each
moving in its orbit, whether jurassic
or botulistic, must be placed on a con-
tractual basis with liberty of prefer-
ential retaliation. Thus the whole in-
dustrial polyphony is linked up by
enharmonic modulations, and throm-
bosis—or, at any rate, conglucination
—of the central ganglia of commerce
is reduced to negligible dimensions.
At this juncture it is well to point out
in the interests of clarity that regurgita-
tion can only be avoided by a rigorous
adhesion to the canon of CRITTENDEN–
that the unit of nutrition must vary
inversely with the square of dilution.
It will thus be seen that by the
logical application of a few simple and
easily apprehended principles Professor
Prawling has built up a great edifice of
practical economics, which, whether we
regard it in its subliminal or its prag-
matic aspects, cannot fail to have influ-
ence on the dynamics of International
Industrialism.
One word more. The conglucination
theory appeals with especial force to
Punch, because it reminds him of the
kindred and remarkable speculation on
Snooling discussed by him many years
ago. The new theory, like the old,
deserves to be treated “in no spirit of
sedentary sentimentalism, but in its
largest and most oleaginous entirety.
It is no plan for fixing hat-pegs in a
passage, nor is it a mode of treating
neuralgia with treacle.” How true and
appropriate this is. Mutatis mutandis
we may add the further statement
that it is “the truest and tenderest
thesis that can occupy the most calcu-
lating cosmopolite.” The corporate
pursuit of a granulated conglucination
is perhaps the highest achievement of
which the present generation is capable.
More Impending Apologies.
“Cardinal Dubois, Archbishop of Rouen, has
been translated, as most of us expected, to the
Archbishopric in Paris. Being a very distin-
guished man of letters, the Académie Française
would like to include him among the Immorals,
but, alas ! they are ‘full inside.’”

HEADLINING.
THE thrilling incident of the stray
cat at “Chez Nous" is never likely to
get into the newspapers. On the other
hand, lots of incidents which do get in
never deserve to. It's all a question
of head-lining, which is the bluff by
which the public is induced to read
matter it would otherwise skip.
The affair began while I was in the
City. I learnt afterwards that Marjorie
(my wife) was crooning to her needles
the unmetrical jumper lullaby, “Six
purl, eight plain; then the same all
over again.” Anyhow she was knitting,
when she suddenly found herself look-
ing into the wistful eyes of a tortoise-
shell cat which had appeared—merely
appeared. - -
As she told me, she softly exclaimed,
“A cat l” (right first time); then,
because it looked so wistful, she directed
the maid to set before the creature a
saucer of milk. In fact—
HOMELESS IXLACK-AND-TAN.
LUCKY CHANCE CALL.
TOOTING GOOD SAMARITAN.
When I arrived home, Marjorie ran
into the hall to give me one of her
smooth evening kisses. I stepped for-
ward to exchange it for one of my
stubbly ones when—
“Oh, Jack,” said Marjorie, “you've
trodden on her ' "
“‘Her,’” I said. “Who’s ‘her’?”
“The dearest little tortoiseshell stray
cat,” replied Marjorie. “You really
might have been more careful.”
“I say, that's rather unfair,” I said.
“I stagger home tired to the teeth
after a particularly thin day in the
City, followed by a sardine-tin journey,
and my own wife turns on me in favour
of the first outcast cat that comes along.
It's enough to drive a man to dope."
Or, as the headlines would have it —
NEAR 13REAKING-POINT.
STRAIN OF 13 USINESS LIFE.
ORIGIN OF THE DI: U.G. HABIT.
After a bath and a change I felt
better, and came down to dinner hum-
ming a sentimental ballad in Marjorie's
honour. But the word “love" died
on my lips when I saw that in the lap
of Marjorie's pretty pink gown reposed
the stray cat. The colour-clash and
the misapplication of caresses which
should have been my monopoly threw
me back with a jerk to a state of
bearishness. - -
“Surely you're not going to keep
that animal?" I asked.
“Of course I am, as long as she likes
to stay," said Marjorie. “She's very
fond of me, aren't you, pussy 2 Fonder
than my husband, I 'spect.”
“I know these stray cats,” I said.
“Stiff with microbes. Tribes of mangy
lovers prowling round the house. A nest
of kittens in my top-hat. I know.”
“Poor li'l pussy,” cooed Marjorie.
“Don’tum listen to the big coarse man.”

Marjorie said coldly that she didn't
know I had such a temper. I said
hotly that I didn't know she could be
so infantile. - - -
We went on discovering things we
hadn't known about each other:—

Dinner was an ordeal. I felt miles
apart from Marjorie. A great gulf filled
with black-and-yellow cat lay between
us. Once only the topic of the beast
arose (on the subject of fish-bones) and
just as I was becoming big and coarse
again the maid entered with the joint.
She must have heard what I said.

Still, the meal itself was a cheering
one, and, after Marjorie had risen, the
sentimental ballad mood gained on me
again. After all, what was a stray cat
compared with one's marriage vows?
If the dear girl wanted to keep the
thing we would have it vetted, definitely
named, and warned as to followers.
Marjorie's voice interrupted my
amiable planning. “Puss, puss,” she
called. } joined her and stated my
decision to relent.
“But she's vanished,” said Marjorie.
She had. And she has never come
back. Ah! those stray cats.

SAY wot 'on RIBLE LANGWIDGE, BUT 'AppEN Your Missis AIN'T

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is certainly this to be said of Mr. HUGH WALPole
—that, having devised a tale of gloom, he allows no weak
consideration for his readers' feelings to deter him from
making the worst of it. I write, having but now emerged,
blinking a little at the familiar sunlight (yet oddly in-
vigorated too), from a perusal of the four-hundred-and-seventy
pages of his Captives (MACMILLAN). Of course I have nothing
like space to detail for you its plot. Summarised, it tells the
life of a young woman, Maggie Cardinal, whom one may
briefly call the bemused victim of religions—and relations.
You never knew any well-intentioned heroine who had such
abysmal luck with both. Her clergyman father, a bad
hat, who spared us his acquaintance by expiring on the
first page; her semi-moribund aunts in their detestable
London home; the circle of the Inner Saints, with their
intrigues that centred in the ugly little meeting-house; the
seaside parish with its spiritually-dead atmosphere, in
which Maggie's hopeless married life is spent—all these
and more are realised with an art that is almost devastating
in its unforced effect. Sometimes I hoped that such uni-
versal drabness was too bad to be true; one caught touches
of manipulation, times in which these poor Captives seemed
bound less by the chains of circumstance than by the wires
of Mr. WALPoLE. The queer result was that I found my-
self believing in his compellingly human characters, but
protesting that such unbroken misfortune could not, or
need not, have encompassed them. To take an example,
when Maggie's “tipsy” uncle was shown into the Vicarage
drawing-room on her “At Home day,” no other guests had
yet arrived. Surely therefore (save for peremptory orders
from Mr. WALPoLE) she might somehow have removed
the culprit to another room, or at least denied herself
to subsequent callers, who included (of course) the most
influential and scandal-mongering of the parish ladies.
That is the kind of rather piled-up agony that made me
suspect Mr. WALPoLE of letting his fortitude get at times the
better of his commonsense. But he has written a big book.
Mr. E. F. BENsoN, of whom it might justly be said that
he produces not books but libraries (and the quality of his
output under these circumstances remains for me amongst
the literary wonders of the age), has been at it again.
Hardly have I finished laughing over Queen Lucia, when I
find him claiming a wholly different interest with a volume
of personal recollections called Our Family Affairs (CAsselſ).
By its theme and treatment this is work standing naturally
a little outside criticism; but I can say at once that Mr.
BENsoN has never written with a more sympathetic charm
than in these pictures of the childhood of himself and his
sister and brothers; of the various scholastic and ecclesiasti-
cal homes to which the increasing dignities of that rather
alarming parent, the Archbishop, transported his family;
and (quite the best and most attractive portrait in the col-
lection) of the mother whom all of them united to adore.
There is an actual photograph of her here, taken at the age
of twenty, which goes far to explain how she came to be
the heroine of the story; the lurking gaiety and laughter of
it quaintly foretelling the great ecclesiastical lady who, on
one occasion when the Archbishop was absent, could an-

nounce to her enraptured children that family prayers should
be remitted, “as a treat l” Schooldays at Wellington;
Cambridge; some topical memoirs of the Georgian régime
in Athens, and (what will interest many readers most of all)
the history of the origin of that famous lady, Dodo—these
are but a selection from the contents of a volume that
should find hosts of friends.
The Girl in Fancy Dress (HopDER AND SToUGHTON) was so
very much disguised in one way and another that Anthony,
the hero, when he asked her to marry him, even for the second
time, was taking considerable risks. The speed of the affair
must also have been bewildering. Cynthia, the heiress, arrives
on a Thursday to stay with his people, but, having tumbled
out of a motor-car into a wet ditch on her way, she is
dressed, rather like a stage coster-girl, in garments borrowed
from a cottager. Naturally, as of course a nursery-governess
is much more likely than an heiress to look like that,
Anthony's people mistake her for a poor country cousin
middle. Nay, but was not the primitive romance a gentler
combat, itself, between Martin Conisby and Lady Joan Bran-
don, marooned, solitary, upon the Island where they did find
(and lose) a treasure even greater than Black Bartlemy's 2
After having “consorted with pirates and like rogues.”
and having “endured much of harms and dangers, as battle,
shipwreck, prison and solitude,” it seemed we had sighted
happiness at last. But even at the very end things took
an ill turn and our Martin, our dear Martin, is left stranded
and in sorry plight. Yet must there be a sequel to this.
Had he been left to die on the Island he could not have
told us his story thus far; moreover his last word is that
the tale is yet to finish. May I be there to hear!
I rather think that the lady who elects to write under
the name of O. Douglas did less than justice to the peculiar
quality of her own gifts in calling her last story Penny
Plain (Hodder AND Stoughton). Because really such con-
fectionery as this, covered inches deep with the sweetest
who is also expected,
and Cynthia, discover-
ing that her host and
hostess and their dreary
daughters intend the
heiress to marry An-
thony and, worse than
that, that he has called
her “the goose with the
golden eggs,” fosters
the mistake and does
her best to pay them
all out. She leaves on
the following Tuesday,
but before that Anthony
has taken her to one
dance as a peasant girl
and she has talked to
him at another dis-
guised as a green
domino, and he has
proposed to her as his
cousin and withdrawn
his declaration when he
finds she isn't. Next he

the plot (which really

small Scottish town,
where lives a family of
bo o k - child re n,
mothered by an elder
sister named Jean, all of
them rich in char-r-rm
but poor in cash. To
this town comes, first,
a pleasant single lady
with a lord for her
brother; secondly an
aged man full of money;
and, because the family
(and the tale) is what it
is, Jean, in fewer chap-
ters than you would
easily credit, has clasped
and then comes his final meeting with her in her proper per-
son, which brings about a satisfactory ending for everyone
but Cynthia's other lover. I don't say that all these things
couldn't have happened; I only say that as a rule they
don't. Apart from that, the bright bustling action of
Mrs. J. E. BUCKRose's story has a cheerful charm of its
own, and Cynthia, as poor relation of one of the anxiously
best families in a little country town, provides some
amusing situations—for the reader.
If the shade of Robert Louis STEvenson is jealous of
its rights and its copyrights, Mr. JEFFERY FARNOL may
look to be hauled up before the Recording Angel, on his
arrival, in the matter of his Black Bartlemy's Treasure
(SAMPsoN Low), which he might just as well have called
Black Bartlemy's Treasure Island and have done. Never was
such frank adoption of ideas; and yet no God-fearing, adven-
ture-loving Englishman will regret it. For all my devotion
to R. L. S. I heartily enjoyed this elaboration of his idea,
split me (to quote the thorough-going language of it)—split
me crosswise else! There are forty-seven chapters and a
bloody fight in every one of them, save in the dozen set
apart for an interval of refreshment and romance in the
the young lord to her breast and is saying the correct things
to the family lawyer of the aged man concerning the respon-
sibilities of being his heiress. So there you have it. I
doubt whether anything even temporarily unpleasant so
much as suggests itself; for “O. Dougi,As” has apparently
discovered that, in a world still struggling with stale peace-
bread, her pink sugar-cakes are not only cheerful to cook
but likely to prove highly remunerative.

Upon that tale of woe?
You know the tale—in Punch, I mean—
Pathetic every word; -
Three wormlets fought to stand between
Pa and the Early Bird.
You sorrowed for their non-success
(By use of triple strength
They saved their father's life—ah

But not his total length). -
You thought, of course—I know you

That Father left his hole,
A briskly virtuous annelid,
To take an early stroll.
Well, now just go and read a book

You'll find that you've been sold.
It's not my own, it's DARw1N's firm
Authority I cite:
There never is an early worm ;
Pa had been out all right. -
He swaggered forth at eventide
And stayed till dawn next day;
For I will not attempt to hide
That worms behave that way.
So pious folk like you and me
Should not be filled with woe
At thought of Father's tragedy;
His morals were so low.

PEOPLE WE ADMIRE.
THE HERO WHO KEEPS UP HIS ARMY EXERCISES, STRIKE OR NO STRIKE.
A LETTER TO THE BACK-BLOCKS.
DEAR GINGER,--So you have bought
a very promising little gold-mine from
a rollicking Irish nobleman called Pat-
rick Terence O'Ryan, who is retiring
on Mayo to take up the paternal estates.
H-m!—have you? And you think you
yourself will be retiring home presently
on the proceeds of the said mine? H-m
again. There is a certain familiarity in
your description of the gentleman. Tell
me, has this Hibernian philanthropist
a slight squint, a broken nose and a
tendency to lisp in moments of excite-
ment 2
I think I see you nod.
Ginger, I once bought a mine from
that man. His name was Algernon
Maddox Cholmondely then, and he was
homeward bound to assume the ances-
tral acres in Flint. He escorted me
down the hole and displayed visible
gold sparkling all along the reef. A
week after he had gone I found that
he had put it there with a shot-gun—
an old “salter's '' trick, but new to me
at the time. You are not likely to be
seeing Patrick Algernon Terence Mad-
dox O'Ryan-Cholmondely again, but, if
you should, remember me to him, please
—with the business end of a pick-axe.
Always delighted to keep in touch with
old friends.
Ginger, you never can tell. This is
not an original remark. One of our
brainy boys—George Bernard, unless I
err–thought of it before I did; went
away into the wilderness, wrapped his
grey-matter in wet Jaeger bandages,
subsisted on a diet of premasticated
grape-nuts and produced this aphorism.
And there's a world of truth in it, my
son. You certainly never can.
One fine morning last August (yes,
there was one), I stepped out of my
diggings in an obscure Cornish fishing-
village to find a gentleman busily en-
gaged strangling a lady on the cliff side.
He had her by the throat and was
gradually forcing her over the edge.
Once in Bristol I interposed in a
slogging contest between husband and
wife and was very properly chastised
for my interference, not only by the
happy pair but by the entire street,
who had valuable bets laid on the event.
That, you say, should have been a lesson
to me. But you know me, Ginger, im-
petuous, chivalrous, brave; I simply
couldn't stand there and watch a de-
fenceless woman—moreover a good-
looking woman—foully done to death
like that. I flung myself upon the
villain—that is to say I spoke to him
about it.
“Oh, dash it, old bean,” I said, “draw
it mild !”
Somebody shouted something behind
me, but I didn't catch its purport for
the sufficient reason that at that mo-
ment the long-suffering cliff gave way
and we all went overboard, all three of
us, he, she and it—me.
Fortunately the drop wasn't terrific
—not more than four feet or so—and
the tide happened to be in at the time,
which was very decent of it. My first
thought as I came to the surface—or,
at any rate, one of my first thoughts—
was “What of the woman 2'' I struck
out for the poor creature. At the same
moment she struck out for me, and,
what is more, she got me too, clean
between the eyes—a straight left-
hander.
“Out of my way, fathead!” she hissed

and went on for the shore under her
own steam at about forty knots an
hour. I was washed up myself, along
with a quantity of other jetsam, a few
minutes later, to be met by a small
furious man with a heliotrope com-
plexion and white spats who wagged
bunches of typescript under my nose
and informed me that I had absolutely
ruined about twenty million feet of the
Flickerscope Company's five-reel para-
lyser, “The Smuggler's Bride.”
Of course you say that you saw what
was coming all along. Of course you
did. But wait a moment.
Yesterday afternoon I was strolling
down a certain fashionable street when
a loud explosion occurred in a near-by
shop and a cloud of acrid grey smoke
came rolling out. Being by nature as
inquisitive as a chipmunk I was on the
point of shoving my head round the
door-jamb to see what was up when
caution prompted me to turn round.
Yes, there they were, of course, a tall,
thin youth winding away at a cine-
camera like an Italian at a barrel-organ,
| and beside him a heavy-weight Israelite,
dancing a war-dance, waving bunches
of typescript and howling at me to
stand clear. I had very near ruined a
further mile or two of film.
I sprang out of range, and then, wish-
ing to atone for my previous blunders and
prove that I really had no malevolent in-
tentions towards a struggling industry,
I went round and assisted the caracol-
ing producer in stemming the crowd.
Among others I stemmed a pushful
policeman. I didn't notice he was a
policeman until he was biting the dust,
with my stick between his legs. How-
ever an instantaneous application of
palm-oil made it all right between us,
and he squatted half-stunned on the
kerb, nursing his brow with one hand,
my five bob with the other and took no
further interest in the proceedings. And
very interesting they were, too.
Three masked men dashed out of the
shop laden with booty and were pursued
by a fourth, whom they knocked on the
head and left lying for dead on the
pavement. Most realistic. The crowd,
led by me, cheered like mad. Then
the thieves jumped into a waiting car
and were whirled away. That done,
the photographer and his step-dancing
friend leapt into a second car and were
whirled away also. Once more we
cheered. I made a short speech to
the effect that everything was all right
with the British Cinema business and,
after leading a few more cheers for
myself, came home.
“Well,” you say, “all very jolly and
so on, but what about it?”

spending a meditative winter in gaol.
The charge is that I did aid and abet
a peculiarly ingenious gang of desper-
adoes to blow a jeweller's safe, knock
the jewelier on the head and get safely
away with the stuff. I am even ac-
cused of obstructing the police. An
inspector has been round to see me this
morning and he tells me there is prac-
tically no hope. He advises me, as
between friends, to make a clean breast
of it, return the boodle, betray my ac-
complices, plead mental deficiency and
trust to the clemency of the Court. It's
pretty rough, after making all arrange-
ments for spending a cheerful Christmas
in Algiers, to have it changed to cold
porridge in Parkhurst or Princetown.
Of the two I hope it'll be Parkhurst,
for Princetown, so habitués tell me, is
no place for a growing lad when the

WE may not have coal, but we can

most typically English thing that there
is. The old Anglo-Saxons had them

called them a silly name like that, when
“conferences” would have done just

had their notions and stuck to them.
They would have called Parliament a
moot; in fact they did. They called it

The advantages of having a con-
ference about everything are almost too
numerous to explain. For one thing,
suppose Smith is coming to see you at
2.30 P.M. “It's no use his waiting
now,” you say. “I've got a conference
at 3. Tell him to come back at 5.30.”
And when he comes back at 5.30 of
course the conference is still going on,
so you don't have to see him at all.
There is nothing again that makes
you feel so deliciously important as
being at a conference. You may be a
leader of quite an insignificant body
of workers, like the Nutcracker-Teeth
Makers' Union, but you rub shoulders
at a conference with men whose names
are a household word throughout the
whole of Great Britain, amongst those
who have houses. The distinguished
and the undistinguished lay their heads
together; the spat-wearing get their
feet mixed with the non-spat-wearing;
though there is rather a fake, mind
you, about this spat-wearing business,
for it may simply mean that the uppers
are very badly worn, or that only that
very bright pink pair of socks came
home from the wash this week, or even
that there are no socks underneath at all.
But anyhow, at a conference, Tom,
Dick and Harry hobnob with Bob,
James and George, and all are equal,
except perhaps the chairman, who has
two more pens in front of him and
a much larger ash-tray. Mr. BEVIN
and Sir ERIC GEDDEs smile affably
across at each other, and the PRIME
MINISTER and Mr. CRAMP find out how
much they have in common, such as
love of poetry and pelargoniums. The
mine-owner offers the miners' repre-
sentative a cigarette, and the miners'
representative says to the mine-owner,
“Many thanks, old boy; but I'll have
one of my own.” And after it is over
they all go out and stand arm-in-arm in
a long row to be photographed for the
papers, and are read next morning from
left to right. It is the ambition of
every properly constituted Englishman
to wake up some morning and find that
his portrait is being read from left to
right; but how few succeed.
words above that.
The total output of conferences in
this country during one year has never
been computed yet, but it is supposed
to exceed that of any country in the
world, except Red India. If there were
to be a strike of conferents or con-
ferees, whatever they are called, in
England, it is impossible to say what
would happen. But it might be possi-
ble to lay down a datum line—a shilling
extra for the first million words above
two hundred and fifty million per shift,
and two shillings more for every million
Fortunately this
will never be necessary, for people who
confer are so fond of conferences that
they will never down chairs.
And no wonder. Only a very strong
man can hew coal, and only a very
reckless one can make a speech, but
almost anyone can confer if he has a
large enough ash-tray; and there seems
no reason why more people shouldn't
confer. Everybody is interested in
conferences, whatever they are about,
and the British public ought to be
admitted to this kind of thing. One
is always reading in the paper that the
sound commonsense or the traditional
sense of fair play of the great British
public will support the miners in any
just claim; but this claim is not just or
just isn't, or something of that sort.
But how do they know what the great
British public will feel about it? They
aren't there, are they? There ought to
be representatives of the G.B.P. on all
these conferences. They ought to be
chosen from a rota, like jurymen. Very
likely one of them would have found
out what a datum line is, anyway.
There's a man who comes up in the
train with me in the morning who
thinks he knows, but unfortunately he
gets out at Croydon so we haven't found
out yet.
By having a lot more conferences
and having a lot of representatives from
the public on them all, and paying them
well for it, one could practically settle
the unemployment problem for the
winter. If the Government can only
be brought to see that this is the only
statesmanlike course, and the sole course
consistent with the Anglo-Saxon sense
of justice, and capable of leading to a
satisfactory Exploration of Avenues,
Finding of Bridges and Discovery of
Ways Out, we may all achieve our life's
ambition some day and open the morn-
ing paper to find that we are being read
at last from left to right. “Mr. Robert
WILLIAMs, Mr. LLOYD GEORGE, Mr.
J. H. THOMAs, Lord RIDDELL," and so
on and so on, till you come at last to
“J. Smith, Esq., R.B.P.,” smiling the
widest of all. R.B.P.'s, I think, should
wear a distinguishing mark—a single
spat perhaps. Evoe.
MORE SECRET HISTORY.
[According to a report in a daily paper, at
the recent Peace Conference held at Spa, where
the delegates were royally entertained in the
matter of hotel accommodation, meals, etc.,
the cigar bill (which has been sent in to the
League of Nations and sent out again)
amounted to three thousand two hundred
pounds. What the delegates could not smoke
they seem to have taken away with them.]
'Tis sweet in darkish times like these
to see a
Rent in the veil which keeps the
public blind,
And thus obtain a pretty shrewd idea
Of what goes on behind ;
To note how quite an innocent report'll
Reveal apparent trifles which befall,
Proving that men whom we supposed
immortal
Are human after all.
But here, while I can hardly call you
blameful
For smoking “free” cigars with so
much zest,
Frankly I feel 'twas little short of
shameful
To go and pinch the rest.
I can forgive your huge hotel expenses;
Your beef was rightly of a super-cut;
A modicum of wine does whet the
Senses;
But those cigars—tut, tut!
For there's a finer aid to meditation,
Much more appropriate, in my humble
View,
When Nation nestles cheek by jowl
with Nation,
And far, far cheaper too.
So, if you'd really slay Bellona's bow-
wows,
Might I suggest your vicious ways
should cease,
And that in future you conduct your
pow-wows
Over the pipe of peace.

THE CONSPIRATORS.
V.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Let me remind
you that the Bolshevist conspirator
has to stir up conflagrations in other
countries without leaving his own.
Passports and things are put in to
make it more difficult when he comes
to getting his inflammable material and
directions for use over the frontier.
So he has to invent a way over the
who turned him out was a patriotic and
fervent admirer of the wine of the
country.
Our Little Man had no vulgar idea
of getting the secret out of him by
making him drunk. If there was a
secret it wouldn't be in the door-keeper.
But he and that door-keeper got to
drinking together and the door-keeper
did all the paying; the drinking and
the paying went on by progressive de-
grees till the door-keeper had no money
him a safe. Our Little Man then
divulged that he was in reality a com-
mercial traveller in safes; if the door-
keeper would get his employer to buy
one of his safes the Little Man would
forgive him his debt by way of com-
mission. He felt sure that the Head of
the Office had a weakness for precau-
tions.
astic, said he should just think he had!
The Little Man felt he was getting
warm. The door-keeper put the deal
obstacles.
The first prize is awarded to
the following: Secret instruc-
tions are printed in Arabic and
the pages containing them are
bound up in a five hundred
page book in that language. The
courier, an Oriental, carries this
book openly in his hand when
he presents himself at the fron-
tier. It is ten to one that an
innocent - looking book, thus
carried, will not be suspected;
a hundred to one against there
being an official capable of read-
ing it; five hundred to three
against that official trying one
of the guilty pages, if he is there
and duly suspicious. Yet, with
a hundred and sixty-six thou-
sand chances against it, our
Little Man got hold of those
instructions.
The Sherlock Holmes of fiction
is a gaunt figure, with a hatchet
face, spare of flesh. Our Little
Man is a chubby lad, standing
about four foot ten in his stock-
inged feet, rubicund and corpu-
lent, and he wears a mackintosh
with a very mackintoshy smell
in all weathers. He never did a
day's work, and he never means
to try, but he is a genius at get-
ting it out of others. Some say
he is of Swiss origin, some say
he is American, and some say
that surely he must be Chinese;
he was never certain himself un-
til Czecho-Slovak was invented,
and he plumped for that. He

through and prevailed upon his
master to instal a really safe safe
in the office, instead of the old
one. You had only to look at it
to see it was impregnable by
fire, water or the King's Ene-
with the Little Man.
The drinking (by both) and
the paying (by the door-keeper)
were resumed. When the debt
was again large enough the
Little Man imposed new terms.
This time he wanted to see the
Head of the Office himself, to
put further deals through. The
door-keeper thought deeply, but
into the presence, and startled
it by pointing to the safe and
offering to do burglar on it any
night of the week. The Head
was manifestly concerned.
“We have here,” said the
Little Man, producing two for-
midable slabs of steel hinged
together and leaving room be-
tween them when locked for a
wad of papers only—“we have
here a special strong box exactly
suited for the storage of your
bank-notes. Put them in this
box, and the box in the safe,
and then you really are ahead of
your enemies.”
The Head bought. He gave
the Little Man less money than
he had spent on the strong box,
and the Little Man gave him
less keys than he was entitled to.
has the degree of Master of Arts; what
arts I don't know; probably the black
ones. His inner knowledge of the hu-
man species seems to give him plenty
to laugh at. He notices everything,
forgets nothing, and there is never a
weakness in a man but he is on to it.
He made up his mind that those secret
instructions were passing and set about
to find how they passed and what they
were. He was too lazy to begin at
the beginning, so he began at the end.
He called in person, as a commercial
traveller, at the suspected office of
destination, and in the short time avail-
able ascertained that the door-keeper
and only a still almighty thirst left. The
Little Man left him with his thirst for
a few days, until it became intolerable,
and the door-keeper insisted that some-
thing simply must be done about it.
The Little Man regretted that he could
not give the necessary money to finance
further orgies, but he would gladly
advance it. Four nights got the door-
keeper well in his debt, and our Little
Man then began to talk about repay-
ment. The door-keeper said he had no
money; the Little Man said he must
get it. Off whom? His employer.
How was the door-keeper to get his
employer's money off him 2 By selling
The drinking and the debt were re-
sumed, and, when it came to a question of
settlement for the third time, the Little
Man pointed out to the door-keeper that,
if he hadn't the money to repay, then
he must steal it. He now divulged
that he was not really a broker, but a
breaker of safes and strong boxes. He
handed the door-keeper a key of his
employer's safe. In the safe would be
found the strong box. In the strong box
would be found some notes of high value,
unless he was very much mistaken.
So the door-keeper went and opened
the safe and returned. And the Little
Man opened the strong box, and he was

very much mistaken. There was never a
note there; just half-a-dozen pages torn
out of a book printed in Arabic.
He was so angry that he gave the
strong box one on the lid for itself, with
the result that he couldn't lock it again.
However, he said he had a friend who
could lock or unlock anything, and he
left the doorkeeper drinking, for the
first time at the Little Man's expense,
while he took off the box to be repaired
by his friend. The latter happened to be
in the next room with a camera. The
pages were photographed; the Little
Man returned to the door-keeper with
the strong box, now capable of being
re-locked ; the door-keeper returned to
the office and put back the strong box,
locked, into the safe, which he also
locked, and was wiping the sweat off his
forehead and congratulating himself
that no one was the worse, when he was
startled to find a policeman had been
watching him all the time.
But he proved to be a very amenable
policeman. He said he would take no
action before he and the door-keeper
had had time to talk it over next day.
By the time that talk came the photo-
graphs had been developed, printed and
translated. But the policeman did
not wish to bore the door-keeper with
the tiresome details. To put it quite
shortly the policeman thought it was
a most excellent crime, worthy of repe-
tition at intervals.

WORKING FOR PEACE.
(Ertracts from the Diary of Mr. John
Robert Boffkins, Trade Union Leader.)
Monday.—Rose with a heart over-
flowing with love towards my fellow-
men. Industrial strife must cease.
Strikes are a barbarous and futile
method of redressing wrong. Rather
think that an increase in wages of two
shillings a day would appeal to our
members. Must inquire.
Tuesday.—Have confirmed myopinion
that a two-shillings' increase would ap-
peal to our members. They all seem
enthusiastic over the suggestion. They
appear to be under the impression that
the idea is their own. It is not. It is
mine. If it materialises I shall be most
popular. But I am all for peace. A
strike is out of the question. I shall
spare no effort to prevent one.
Wednesday. — Presented formal de-
mand to employers to-day. Told our
members they must be firm to the
bitter end. The two-shillings' increase
is their strict due, and, if we present a
united front, the grasping capitalist will
be brought to his knees. Am working
night and day for peace.
Thursday.—Pointed out to the em-
ployers that a strike is inevitable unless
they give way. We can make no con-
cession. My whole energies are con-
centrated on preventing a strike. Told
our members that unless they remain
firm the employers will crush them.
A strike would be a national calamity
and might spell ruin to the country.
Friday.—The possibility of a strike
looms larger. Can nothing be done to
prevent it? Informed the employers
that we declined to abate one iota of
our claim. “All or nothing" is our
motto. Also refused to go to arbitration.
Warned the employers that a strike
means starvation for women and chil-
dren. The prospect appals me.
Saturday.-The employers, who seem
to be determined on a strike, have
offered the men two shillings if they
will consider the question of working
five days a week instead of four. We
refused their offer and demanded that
our claim should be conceded uncon-
ditionally by noon, failing which our
members would cease work.
Later.—The strike has commenced.
Heaven knows that I did everything to
prevent it which human being could do.
The capitalists seem to have made up
their minds to force civil war and all its
horrors upon the country. The spec-
tacle of little children starving causes
me acute distress.
A GUIDE TO GREATNESS.
[Mr. Jacob EpstEIN maintains in The Daily
Mail that a man to be a creative genius must
lead an orderly domesticated life.]
I courTED the Muse as a stripling,
Immured in a Bloomsbury flat,
And yearned for the kudos of KIPLING
For fees that were frequent and
fat ;
But editors, far from discerning
The worth of the pearls that I placed
At their feet, had a way of returning
The same with indelicate haste.
But, espousing, a year or two later,
The sweetest and neatest of wives,
I found, after peeling a tater
Or imparting a polish to knives,
I could scribble with frenzy and passion,
That the breaking of coal would in-
spire,
In a truly remarkable fashion,
My soul with celestial fire.
Serenity reigns in the household;
I've cancelled my grudge against
Fate;
My lyrical efforts are now sold
At a simply phenomenal rate;
And, whether I'm laying the lino
Or bathing the babes, I regard
The job as a cushy one: I know
The way to succeed as a bard.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Tuesday, October 19th.-A start was
made with half a hundred Questions,
and, considering that most of them had
been in cold storage since before the
Recess, it was surprising how fresh
they remained. Persia and Mesopo-
tamia—not to mention Ireland—are
still unsettled; the Turkish Treaty is
not yet ratified; the cost of living con-
tinues to rise, and the ratio of un-
employment has alarmingly advanced,
especially in the case of ex-service men.
These last are to be found work in
the building trades, with, it is hoped,
the assistance of the trade unions, but,
if that hope is disappointed, then with-
out it. The country requires half-a-
million houses built.
“Here are men who
could assist,” said the
PRIME MINISTER,” and
we propose that they
should be allowed to
assist.”
Over a prospect al-
ready sufficiently
bleak there broods the
shadow of the coal-
strike. Sir Robert º
HoRNE, in presenting
the case for the Gov-
ernment, was admir-
ably clear but, perhaps
naturally, a little cold.
Only when the new
lighting arrangement
had flooded the House
with artificial sun-
shine did the Minister
warm up a little and
hint that a way of
peace might yet be
found.
I wonder if it was
by accident or artifice that Mr. BRACE
began his plea for the miners with
the admission that they had only
dropped the demand for the reduction
of fourteen shillings and twopence in
the price of domestic coal when they
discovered that “the money was not
there.” Anyhow the laughter that en-
sued served to put Members into a
good temper and to cause them to lend
a friendly ear to his suggestion that the
two shillings advance, though in his
view only “dust in the balance,” should
be “temporarily" conceded, pending
the establishment of a tribunal which
should permanently settle the condi-
tions of the mining industry. The in-
crease of output which everyone desired
would then be brought about.
Most of the speakers who followed
seemed to think that Mr. BRACE had
sown the seed of a settlement. It was
left to the PRIME MINISTER, who evi-

dently did not relish the task, to awaken
the House from its beautiful dream. He
pointed out that to accept the proposal
would be to give the miners what they
had originally claimed, without any
guarantee that the greater output would
be forthcoming. If it were not forth-
coming and the two shillings were
taken away, what would happen 2 “A
strike,” cried someone. “Precisely,”
said Mr. LLoyd GEORGE: only it would
have been provoked by the Govern-
ment instead of by the miners. He was
not prepared to do business on those
lines.
And so the debate came to an end
rather than a conclusion.
Wednesday, October 20th. The Peers
plunged into the morasses of the Irish
Question. Lord CREwe asked for an
official inquiry into the alleged “re-
prisals" and particularly instanced the
attacks upon the creameries. Rather
than that Ireland should be “pacified"
by such methods as these he would see
her engaged in civil war, “fairly con-
ducted on both sides.” From these
words it may be gathered that his lord-
ship's knowledge of civil war is happily
not extensive.
Furnished with a voluminous brief
from the Irish Office, Lord CURzoN
made a long reply, the purport of
which was that many of the reprisals
were bogus, many were actions under-
taken in self-defence, while the rest were
generally due to men “seeing red "
after their comrades had been brutally
murdered. The Government did not
palliate such cases, and had instituted
inquiries and taken disciplinary action
against the offenders, when known ;
GET out wid YEz AND LET THE LADY PAss.”
but they were not prepared to set up
a public inquiry such as Lord CREwe
had demanded. It would only substi-
tute “a competition in perjury” for
the present “competition in murder"—
a somewhat infelicitous phrase by
which, as he subsequently explained,
he did not mean to imply, as Lord
PARMooR suggested, that police and
rebels were engaged in a murderous
rivalry.
Simultaneously the House of Com-
mons was engaged upon an identically
similar debate. Mr. ARTHUR HENDER-
son was as lugubrious as Lord CREwe
in presenting the indictment and dis-
tinctly less adroit in selecting his facts.
His theory was that the Government
had provoked the Sinn Fein outrages
- by its treatment of the
people. Why, women
had been prevented
from taking their eggs
to market !
Sir HAMAR GREEN-
wood spoke from the
same brief as Lord
CURzoN, but threw far
more passion and vig-
our into its recital.
There had been some
reprisals, he admitted,
but they were as no-
thing compared to the
horrors that had pro-
; voked them; and he
protested against the
notion that “the
heroes of yesterday"
—the R.I.C. is mainly
recruited from ex-ser-
vice men—had turned
into murderers. As
for the creameries, he
had never seen a tittle
of evidence that they
had been destroyed by servants of the
Crown, and he warned the House not
to believe the stories put out by the
propaganda bureau of the Irish Repub-
lican Army. He was still a convinced
Home Ruler—an Ulster hot-gospeller
had accused him of being a Sinn Feiner
with a Papist wife —but the first thing
to do was to break the reign of terror
and end the rule of the assassin. That
they were doing, and there was no case
for Mr. HENDERSON’s “insulting reso-
lution.”
The Opposition for the moment
seemed stunned by the CHIEF SECRE-
TARY's sledge-hammer speech. No one
rose from the Front Bench and Lieu-
tenant-Commander KENworTHY had to
overcome his modesty and step into
the breach. Later on, Lord Robert
CECIL, on the strength of information
supplied by an American journalist,
supported the demand for an inquiry.

Harassed Secretary. “I say, You NEEDN'T MAKE BUNKERs, You KNow.”
So did Mr. Asquith, on the ground
that it would be in the interests of the
Government of Ireland itself; but this
argument was obviously weakened by
Mr. BonAR LAw's reminder that in 1913
and 1914 Mr. Asquith himself had
deprecated inquiries in somewhat simi-
lar circumstances. The Government
had a very good division, 346 to 79; but
there were many abstentions.
Thursday, October 21st.—It was, no
doubt, by way of brightening an
unutterably gloomy week that Mr.
L'EstraNGE MALONE, who has not
hitherto been known as a humourist,
invited the Government to intercede at
Washington for the release of the
notorious JAMEs LARKIN, now languish-
ing in an American gaol. Inasmuch as
LARKIN had been convicted for having
advocated the overthrow of the United
States by violence, Mr. HARMsworth
did not think H.M. Government were
called upon to intervene. Mr. MALONE
understood from this that the Govern-
ment had no sympathy with British
subjects in foreign lands, and so he got
another laugh.
Commander BELLAIRs thought it
would be a good idea if the League of
Nations, pending the discharge of its
more important functions, were to offer
rewards for world-benefiting discoveries
such as a prophylactic against potato-
blight. Sir John REEs saw his chance
and took it. “Does the League,” he in-
quired, “declare to win on Phosphates,
Peace or Potatoes?”—thus supplying
proof positive that he owes his precise
pronunciation to past practice with
“prunes and prisms.”
It was rather impudent of Mr. ADAM-
son, who has just been instrumental in
throwing out of work some hundreds of
thousands of his fellow-citizens, to ini-
tiate a debate on unemployment. Most
of the speakers endeavoured to throw the
blame on “the other fellow"—the Gov-
ernment on the trade unions, the trade
unionists on the employers, and the em-
ployers on the Government. A welcome
exception was Mr. HoPKINSON, who
boldly blamed the short-sighted selfish-
ness of some of his own class. Employés
would not work their hardest to “make
the boss a millionaire.” As a fitting finale
to an inconclusive debate the PRIME
MINISTER announced that in order to
force a settlement of the coal-strike
the railwaymen—Mr. THOMAs, appar-
ently, dissenting—had threatened to
join the unemployed.

THE REWIWAL OF OLLEND0RFF.
FROM the memories of my mid-Vic-
torian childhood, before the instruction
of a governess had reached a point at
which the plunge was made into a pre-
paratory school, three names emerge
with remarkable distinctness. “Little
Arthur,” from whom I derived my
earliest knowledge of the History of
England; “Henry,” by whom I was
grounded in the rudiments of the dead
Latin tongue (but who must be care-
fully distinguished from JAMES HENRY,
the Virgilian, who in turn had nothing
whatever to do with HENRY JAMEs the
novelist), and OLLENDoRFF, the illustri-
ous author of a series of manuals for the
teaching of living foreign languages.
OLLENDoRFF, I fear, is not even the
shadow of a name to the present gener-
ation. There is no mention of him
in The Encyclopædia Britannica or in
Chambers. Even in his own country
he seems to have lapsed into obscurity,
and in MENDEL's voluminous Conversa-
tions-Lexikon there is only a brief refer-
ence to the Ollendorffian method, but
no account of the man or his history.
Yet he must have existed; OLLENDoRFF
cannot have been a mere symbol. And
as students of SHAKSPEARE have endea-
voured to reconstruct the man from his
plays so I feel sure that the character
of OLLENDoRFF, his interests and poli-
tics, might very well be reconstructed
from a study of his dialogues. One
must admit that his Teutonic patrony-
mic is an obstacle to his revival, but
that difficulty can be surmounted by
the adoption of an alias. For example,
by the omission of one of the “f's" and
the transposition of one other letter
his name, read backwards, becomes
Frondello, which is at once euphonious
and void of all racial offence.
The Ollendorffian method, it may be
noted for the benefit of the ignorant,
did not merely depend on the employ-
ment of question and answer; it aimed
at conveying information drawn from
the homely affairs of daily life and the
relations between persons belonging to
different trades and occupations. “Have
you,” OLLENDoRFF would ask, “the hat
of the gardener's son 2" And when
this had been duly and correctly trans-
lated into German or French the pupil
proceeded to the answer, “No, but I
have the boots of the grocer's brother-
in-law.”
I think OLLENDoRFF built better than
he knew; or perhaps he did know. A
strong vein of Socialism runs through
all his examples, which seem to show a
lively appreciation of the Communistic
principle. To him there was nothing
wrong or dangerous in this mutual
interchange and enjoyment of property.

thinking that, at a time when so much
depends on the fusion of classes, a new

brought up to date so as to meet the

rich, the old aristocracy and the new
plutocracy, would be fraught with the
most salutary results.
The following are some crude sugges-
tions of the lines on which the revision
might be carried out :—
“Have you the leathern waistcoat

“Have you the smooth-running auto-

“No, but I have the loan of the push-
bicycle of my former under-gardener's
uncle.”
“Are you going to marry the beau-
tiful daughter of the shoemaker 2"—
“Yes, and her brother has just become
engaged to the widow of my cousin the
marquis.”

AT THE PLAY.
“THE ROMANTIC AGE.”
I HoPE that Mr. ALAN MILNE is a good
enough critic to agree with me in think-
ing that this is the best play he has so
far given us. Not that the idea of it is
as new as that of his Mr. Pim or his
Wurzel-Flummery, but because, without
sacrificing his lightness of touch and his
sense of fun, he has, for the first time,
produced a serious scheme.
People will tell you that his Second
Act was the weak spot in the play;
that the others were brilliant, but that
this one, for its first half, was tedious
and delayed the action. They will say
this because they are familiar with
A. A. M.'s humour, but not with his
sentiment. Yet it was in this middle
Act that he gave us the best passage of
all, in presenting the philosophy of his
pedlar, which had in it something of the
dewy freshness of the early morning
scene in the wood (“morning's at seven,”
as Pippa–not Mr. Pim—said en pas-
sant). There was no real delay in the
action here, for the pedlar was pro-
viding the hero with the argument
without which he could never have
persuaded the lady to yield; could never
have made her understand that Romance
is not confined to the trunk-and-hose
period, or any age, so named, of chivalry,
but is to be found wherever there is a
true companionship of hearts. Unfor-
tunately the effect of this passage was
a little spoilt by what had just gone
before—a rather slow and superfluous
scene with the village idiot—and some
of the audience imagined that the author
was still marking time. .
Mr. MILNE has an individual manner
so distinct that he can well afford to
acknowledge his debt to Sir JAMEs
BARRIE. As in Mary Rose, so here
(though there are no supernatural forces
at work) we have the sharp contrast
between commonplace life, as lived by
the rest, and the life of Fairyland, as
coming within the vision of one only.
And we were reminded too of the
Midsummer-madness that overtook the
company in Dear Brutus. I won't say
that it wasn't natural enough for
Melisande, under the fascination of a
moonlit Midsummer Eve, to imagine,
when she chanced upon a gentleman in
fancy dress of the right period, that
at last she had realised her dream of a
hero of romance; but she was stark
Midsummer-mad to suppose, when she
met him early next morning with his
costume unchanged, that he would keep
it on till he came to tea with the family,
and then, still wearing it, waft her off
to Faerie.
But not even BARRIE has ever made
a better scene than that which showed
us the disillusionment of the visionary
when she is confronted with her blue-
and-gold hero of romance now trans-
formed into a plain Stock Exchange
man, his air of banality enhanced by
the last word in golf suitings. The
humour of this scene, in which she
made conventional conversation with-
out any real effort to conceal her sense
of the bathos of the situation, was very
perfect. The relatively simple humour
of the match-making mother—not so
simple, all the same, as its spontaneity
made it appear—had the distinction
which one expects of Mr. MILNE; but
this was far the funniest feature in the
play.
Mr. ARTHUR Won TNER (to himself). “WELL,
I Don't THINK MUCH OF YOUR TASTE IN
CLOTHES.”
It would have been an easy matter
to make cheap fun, as MARK TwAIN did
in A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,
out of the popular view of the Age of
Romance, but A.A.M. avoided that
obvious lure. Indeed, in his natural
anxiety not to be taken too seriously in
his first attempt to be serious, he rather
tended to make light of his own theory
of modern romance, laying a little too
much stress at the end on the culinary
aspect of conjugal felicity.
I am not sure that Mr. ARTHUR
WoNTNER (to whom my best wishes
for his new managership) quite realised,
in his doublet and long hose, my idea
of a figure of mediaeval romance. In
fact I am free to confess that I dis-
agreed with Melisande and preferred
him in his golf-clothes. But perhaps
that was part of the idea, and Mr.
MILNE meant me to feel like that.
Miss BARBARA. HoFFE's Melisande—a
difficult part, because she was the only
other-worldly person in the play and
the only one in desperate earnest—was
very cleverly handled. In her most
exalted moments of poetic rapture she
was never too precious, and when called
upon for a touch of corrective humour
was quick to respond.
Miss LoTTIE WENNE laid herself
out in her inimitable way for a
broad interpretation of the visionary's
very earthly mother; indeed once or
twice she almost laid herself out of
the picture; but she still remained
irresistible. As a pair of light-hearted
young lovers Miss DoRothy TETLEy.
and Mr. John WILLIAMs played really
well in parts that were not nearly so
easy as they looked. And there
was the dry humour of Mr. BROMLEy-
DAvenport, as the father (I fear he
must have missed the romance of twin
souls) and the open-air charm of Mr.
NICHOLSON's performance as Gentleman
Susan, the pedlar. In a word, my
grateful compliments embrace as good
a cast as ever caught—and held—the
spirit of an author.
“PRIscILLA AND THE PROFLIGATE.”
When you have been jilted by Cyn-
thia at the church-door and, two days
afterwards, in a fit of pique marry
Priscilla at sight (of course you can't
always get a Priscilla to consent to this
arrangement; but Mr. Bensley Stuart
Gore had a young ward at school who
wanted her freedom ; so that was all
right), you may think to persuade the
Faithless One that you have given solid
proof of your indifference to her. But
you mustn't dash off to Africa an hour
after your wedding with the declared
intention of being eaten by wild men or
wilder beasts, because, if you do that,
you give your scheme away and Cynthia
will have the satisfaction of knowing
that she has driven you to desperate
courses. Yet that is what Mr. Bensley
Stuart Gore did (he was the “Profligate”
of the title, though he never gave any
noticeable sign of profligacy).
After this strain on my credulity I
felt prepared for anything, and was
not in the least surprised to find him,
six years older and still intact, on the
terrace of the Hotel Casa Bellini, by
the dear old shores of Lake Maggiore,
which, as the programme advised me,
is in Italy. It seemed, too, the most
natural thing in the world that the
author, Miss LAURA WILDIG, should
have collected Priscilia and Cynthia
(the latter in tow of a third-rate
millionaire husband whom she loathed)
at the same address.
It was at this juncture that Mr.

Diner. “I SAY, wait ER, I’ve AskED THREE TIMEs For PotAtoes.”
Waiter (still under the influence of military discipline). “BE.G PARDON, SIR, BUT I'M Told of F To concBNTRATE on THE cabbagº.”
Bensley Stuart Gore was inspired with
a Great Thought. In order to set
Priscilla free (I ought to say that he
hadn't recognised her) he would elope
with Cynthia. How Priscilla set out
to frustrate this noble sacrifice and
secure her husband for herself; how
she bribed the caretaker to lock him up
with her in the “Bloody Turret” of
an adjacent ruin; how subsequently, at
2 A.M., in the public lounge of the hotel,
she tried to work upon his emotions by
appearing in a black night-dress (surely
this rather vulgar form of allurement
is démodé by now even in the suburbs,
or, anyhow, is not so freshly daring as
she seemed to think it), I will leave
you to imagine. Even Miss IRIs Hoey's
nice soft voice and pleasant calineries
could not quite carry off this rather
machine-made trifle. If anything saved
it, it was the acting of Mr. FRANK
DENTON as Jimmy Forde. Starting as
Bensley’s “best man,” he missed the
wedding ceremony through going to the
wrong church, but after that he stuck
close to his friend for the remainder of
the plot, and greatly endeared himself
to the audience by the excellent way
in which he played the silly ass.
As for Bensley himself, you might
| have thought that he had a sufficiently
chequered career, yet Mr. CYRIL RAY-
Mond got very little colour out of the
part. For the rest, Mr. H. DE LANGE, as
the millionaire, got a certain amount out
of the subject of his wife's indigestion,
which was a sort of leit-motif with
him; but most of the colour seemed
to have gone into the scenery, admir-
ably designed and painted by Mr.
McCLEERY and Mr. WALTER HANN.

Never heed his usual tale

But read these lines and really learn
The proper kinds of logs to burn.
Oak logs will warm you well
If they're old and dry;
Larch logs of pine woods smell,
But the sparks will fly.
Beech logs for Christmas-time,
Yew logs heat well;
“Scotch" logs it is a crime
For anyone to sell.
Birch logs will burn too fast,
Chestnut scarce at all;
Hawthorn logs are good to last
If cut in the Fall.
Holly logs will burn like wax,
You should burn them green;
Elm logs like smouldering flax,
No flame to be seen.
Pear logs and apple logs,
They will scent your room;
Cherry logs across the dogs
Smell like flowers in bloom.
But Ash logs, all smooth and grey,
Burn them green or old;
Buy up all that come your way,
They're worth their weight in gold.

THE PRIVATE FILM.
My attention has been drawn to the
most recent and perhaps the most ter-
rible development of the Cinema by an
advertisement, from which I take the
following extracts:—
“HAVE YOUR OWN FILM TAKEN.
THE Most MoDERN METHOD of GAINING
PUBLICITY.
To Members of Parliament, Mayors,
Lecturers and other Public Men and
Women.
“The Cinema has become the cheapest,
the surest and most rapid road to pub-
licity. It is estimated that a third of
the population attend the Cinema once
a week. Messrs. Mump and Gump
have therefore fitted up a special studio
for film work, in which you can now
have your own film taken, represent-
ing you in any action you may desire.
This method of publicity is specially
recommended to Members of Parlia-
ment. For instance one can be filmed
writing a letter, which can be closed
down and handed to a messenger, which
action can be followed by the letter itself
being thrown on the screen. . . Think
what this means to a prospective Can-
didate when he goes to a constituency
where he is unknown. He takes with
him twenty or more films. Your con-
stituents must see and know you before
you can hope for their vote. The Cinema
introduces your personality and your
policy.
“Your film will cost you—
First reel . . . . Three guineas.
Each extra reel. One guinea.”
The more I see of business-men the
less they seem to me to know about
business. I never read an advertise-
ment without thinking, “How much
better I (or even you) could have done
that l” Yet they will tell you that it
is their advertisements which make the
money. It only shows . . . However.
Messrs. Mump and Gump, for instance,
have scarcely skimmed the surface pos-
sibilities of their brilliant notion. This
invention is going to make politics tol-
erable at last. No man minds being
in the House of Commons; it is being
in his constituency which is so dreadful.
And now he need never go there.
For instance, when the constituency is
tired of the letter-film, he can be filmed
making a speech, which can be taken
down and handed to a typist, which
action can be followed by the speech
itself being thrown on the screen—in
instalments. The constituency will
enjoy this, because it will take much
less time to read it than it would to
listen to it, and they can argue out loud
about the meaning of Early English
phrases like Datum-line and Functional
Representation. In fact they can go on
arguing during the Whips of Sin which
will follow.
As for the public man, it won't take
him two minutes to be filmed making the
speech, unless, of course, he has any very
complicated gestures; and it won't take
him any time at all to compose it,
because the private secretary will do
that; and the private secretary will be
able to make sure that his joke about
JERo BoAM is not turned into a joke
about JEHoshAPHAT at the last minute,
or simply shelved in favour of a perora-
tion on rainbows. After the speech
the M.P. can be filmed opening a flower-
show and, if necessary, writing a cheque
to the local hortiphilist society, which
cheque can be thrown on the screen
amid loud applause, but need not, of
course, go any further.
There is one other point, but it is
rather a delicate matter: Messrs. Mump
and Gump say to the prospective Candi-
date, “Your constituents must see and
know you before you can hope for their
vote.” Are they quite right 2 I have
seen a good many Candidates in my
time, and I can think of some to whom
I should have said, “Your constituents
must never see you if you hope for a
single vote.” I mean, when one looks
round the present House of Commons,
one really marvels how . . . But per-
haps I had better not go on with that.
The point is that a Candidate of that
kind never need be seen by his con-
stituents now. A handsome young
private secretary, uniformed and be-
ribboned, and the film does the rest.
Then I rather resent the assumption
that Members of Parliament, Mayors,
Lecturers and Actors are the only
people who require publicity. I should
have thought that those who spend
their time writing things in the public
Press, which are read by the public (if
anybody), might have had at least the
courtesy title of Public Man. Anyhow,
I am going to have three guineas'
worth. The only question is, what sort
of picture will most thoroughly “get"
my personality before a third of the
population once a week 2 The moment
when I am most characteristic is when
I am lying in a hot bath, and to-morrow
is Sunday; but I doubt if even a sixth
of the population would be really keen
on that. I don't mind writing a letter
or two, only, if it meant an extra reel
every time I decided to write it to-
morrow instead, it would be rather a
costly advertisement.
Really, I suppose, one ought to be
done At Work in His Study; but
even that would require a good deal of
faking. Ought one, for instance, to
remove the golf-balls and the cocoa-cup
(and the rhyming dictionary) from The
Desk? Then I always write with a
decayed pencil, and that would look so
bad. Messrs. Mump and Gump would
have to throw in a quill-pen. And I
have no Study. I work in the drawing-
room, when the children are not play-
ing in it. To go into The Study I
simply walk over to my table and put ||
up a large notice: “THE STUDY. Do
NOT SPEAK To M.E.. I AM THINKING."
Do you think that had better be in the
film ?
Or I wonder if a Comic would be
more effective—a Shaving reel or a
Dressing reel? It is the small inci-
dents of every-day life that one should
look to for the key to the character of
a Public Man; and once a whole third
of the population had seen for them-
selves what pain it gives me to put
links and studs and all those things in
a clean shirt, they would understand
the strange note of melancholy which
runs through this article.
But of course an author should have
several different reels corresponding to
the different kinds of work which he
wants to publicitise. (That is a new
word which I have just invented, but
you will find it in common use in a
month or two.) People like Mr. BELLoc
will probably require the full politician's
ration of twenty or more, but the or-
dinary writer might rub along with
four or five. -
When his Pug, Wog and Pussy is on
the market there will be a Family reel,
in which he is pretending to be a tree
and the children are climbing it. And
when he has just published The Cruise
of the Cow; or, Seven Hours at Sea, he
will be seen with an intense expression
tying a bowline on a bight or madly
hauling on the throat - halyard—at
Messrs. Mump and Gump's specially-
equipped ponds. And for his passionate
romance, The Borrowed Bride But
I don't know what he will do then.
And even now we have not exhausted
the list of Public Men. There are clergy-
men. Don't you feel that some of those
sermons might be thrown on the screen
—and left there 2 A. P. H.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
How you regard Miss MAY SINCLAIR's latest story, The
Romantic (CoLLINs), will entirely depend upon your attitude
towards the long-vexed question of the permissible in art.
If you hold that all life (which in this association generally
means something disagreeable) is its legitimate province and
that genius can transmute an ugly study of morbid patho-
logy into a romance, you will admire the force of this vivid
little book; otherwise, I warn you frankly, you are like to be
repelled by the whole business. The title, to begin with, is
an irony as grim as anything that follows, in what sense
you will find as the story reveals itself. The Romantic is
a picture—what do I say? a vivisection—of cowardice,
seen through the horrified eyes of a woman who loved
the subject of it. The scene is the Belgian battle-
fields, to which John Conway, being unfitted for active
service, had taken out a motor-ambulance, with Charlotte
Itedhead as one of his drivers. All the background of this
part of the tale is wonderfully realised, a thing of actual
and unforgetable experience. Here gradually the first
tragedy of Conway is made clear, though shielded and
ignored as long as possible by the loyalty of fellow-workers
and the obstinate disbelief of the girl. Perhaps you think
I am making too much of it all; treacherous nerves were
the lot of many spiritually noble men in that hell. But
httle by little conviction of a deeper, less understandable,
AND I ou GHT TO KNOW SOMETHING
horror creeps upon the reader, only to be explained and
confirmed on the last page. To be honest, The Romantic
is an ugly, a detestably ugly book, but of its cleverness
there can be no question.
It would appear that Mr. A. E. W. MASON is another of
those who hold that the day of war-novels is not yet done.
Anyhow, The Summons (Hodder AND Stoughton) shows
him dealing out all the old familiar cards, spies and
counter-spies, submarines and petrol bases and secret ink.
It must be admitted that the result is unexpectedly
archaic. Perhaps also Mr. MASON hardly gives himself a fair
chance. The “summons" to his hero (who, being familiar
with the Spanish coast, is required when War breaks out
to use this knowledge for submarine-thwarting) is too long
delayed, and all the non-active service part of the tale
suffers from a very dull love-interest and some even more
dreary racing humour. Archaic or not, however, Hillyard's
anti-spy adventures, in an exquisite setting that the author
evidently knows as well as his hero, are good fun enough.
But the home scenes had (for me at least) a lack of grip
and conviction by no means to be looked for from a writer
of Mr. MASON's experience. His big thrill, the suicide of
the lady who first sends by car to the local paper the story
of her end and then waits to confirm this by telephone
before making it true, left me incredulous. I'm afraid The
Summons can hardly be said to have found Mr. MAsoN in
his customary form.

“To write another person's life-history in the first person,
and yet give to it the verisimilitude of a genuine autobio-
graphy, would under ordinary circumstances be a difficult if
not impossible undertaking.” So Mr. C. E. GouldsBURY tells
us in a note to Reminiscences of a Stowaway (CHAPMAN AND
HALL), and most of us will cordially agree with him. But, after
reading this volume of reminiscences, I think you will also
agree that Mr. GouldsBURY has acquitted himself admira-
bly of a most difficult task. The man into whose skin, if I
may so express it, he has temporarily tried to fit himself
was Mr. ALEXANDER Douglas LARYMoRE, who started his
adventurous career as a stowaway in an “old iron tub,” and
eventually became Inspector-General of Jails in India. For
nearly forty years Mr. GouldsBURY was Mr. LARYMoRE's
intimate friend, and has had sufficient data at his disposal
to do justice to what was a remarkably full and interesting
life. Possibly those of us who retain a tender spot in our
hearts for stowaways may regret that Mr. LARYMoRE grew
tired of the sea; but his adventures were as numerous and
tical fiction was a description of an opéra-bouffe Labour
Government in action, addresses himself, in The Monster
(HEINEMANN), to a more serious theme. His monster is the
factory system, and if I say that this witty novel will pro-
vide the ignorant and comfortable with instruction as well
as entertainment I hope I shan't have done him any harm.
The author, while making his points against the system,
notes truly enough that the risen ranker, the one who had
been through the dreadful mill, with its ninety-hour working
week for children, became the hardest master during that
wonderful period of the Manchesterising of England which
laid the train for the explosions of our present discontents.
He reminds us also of that admirable speech, made about
every ten years for the last hundred or so in the House
with the same fervour and conviction, to the effect that
any change in conditions or wages would surely mean the
complete ruin of the country. A comforting speech, that
Perhaps Mr. BLEACKLEY, presenting three generations from
Peterloo to the Jubilee of QUEEN VICTORIA, covers too much
amusing on land as on |
||
water, and they are
also valuable for the
strong light they throw
on the India of some

Good luck to him.
I did not take the pub-

commendation, how-
ever alluring it was

leave it at that. Meanwhile, however, the thing has con-
tinued to spread, till on the wrapper of Tarzan the Un-
tamed (METHUEN), which now at last finds me out, its
publishers are able to number its devotees in millions. Well,
of course the outstanding fact about such popularity is that
in face of it any affectation of superiority becomes simply
silly. One has got to accept this creation of Mr. EDGAR
Rice BURRoughs as among the definite literary phenomena
of our time. In the immediate spasm before me Tarzan
(who is, if you need telling, a kind of horribly exaggerated
Mowgli after a diet of the Food of the Gods) is represented as
placing himself at the disposal of the British forces in East
Africa, and attacking the Germans with man-eating lions.
The rather chastening feature of which was my own unex-
pected enjoyment of the idea. Even, for one disconcerting
moment, like the persons in the admonitory anecdotes who
taste opium “just for fun,” I began to feel that perhaps . . .
However it passed, and the temptation has not returned.
Meanwhile the real nature of Tarzanism, whether some
sinister possession or simply the age-long appetite for the
monstrous, just now a little out of hand, remains as far
from solution as ever.
Mr. HoRACE BLEACKLEY, whose last excursion into poli-
sibly in a so-called mystery book the author ought to have
his readers guessing all the time, but if I was not perpetually
engaged in this rather exhausting pursuit I was, at any rate,
intrigued. Pengard, who is also Sylvester, and yet is neither
the one nor the other, may be too much for your saner
moments of credulity. But Mr. STRAUs tells his queer story
so plausibly and with so light a touch that even though you
may affect to scoff at his dashing improbabilities you cannot
escape their attraction. Indeed Mr. STRAus's adventure
into fields hitherto strange to him has been so successful
that I am inclined to ask him to continue cultivating them.

“Now mind, you know, if I kill you it's nothing, but if
you kill me, by Jingo, it's murder.” This remark was

THE POET LAUREATE AND HIS GERMAN FRIENDS.
“Prisoners to a foe inhuman, Oh, but our hearts rebel ;
Defenceless victims ye are, in claws of spite a prey.

Nor trouble we just Heaven that quick revenge be done
On Satan's chamberlains highseated in Berlin ;
Their reek floats round the world on all lands neath the sum :
Tho' in craven Germany was no man found, not one
With spirit enough to cry Shame!—Nay but on such sin
Follows Perdition eternal . . . and it has begun.”
The PoET LAUREATE, in “The Times,” November 4th, 1918.
“The letter [of reconciliation from Oxford Professors, etc., to their
fellows in Germany’) is written . . . with the recognition that we
have both of us been provoked to ‘animosities’ which we desire to
put aside . . . The commonest objection was that the action was
‘premature’—my own feeling being that of shame for having vainly
waited so long in deference to political complications, and that shame
was intolerably increasing . . . It is undiscerning not to see that
at a critical moment of extreme tension they [the German Professors]
allowed their passion to get the better of them.”
The PoET L-4 URE., TE, in “The Times,” October 27th, 1920.
[The author of the following lines fears that he has failed to do
full justice to the metrical purity of the Master's craftsmanship.]
SUCH people as lacked the leisure to peruse
My scripture, one-and-a-quarter columns long
In The Times, may like me, as having the gift of song,
To prosodise succinctly my private views.
Did I cry Shame! in November, 1918,
On those who never cried Shame! on the lords of hell?
Rather the shame is mine who delayed to clean
My soul of a wrong that grew intolerable.
What if our German colleagues, our brothers-in-lore,
Preached and approved for years the vilest of deeds 2
Yet is there every excuse when the hot blood speeds;
We too were vexed and wanted our fellows' gore,
Saying rude things in a moment of extreme tension
Which in our calmer hours we should never mention.
Dons in their academic ignorance blind,
With passions like to our own as pea to pea,
Shall we await in them a change of mind 2
Shall we require a repentant apology 2
Or in a generous spasm anticipate
The regrets unspoken that, under the heavy stress
Of labour involved in planning new frightfulness,
They have been too busy, poor dears, to formulate?
Once I remarked that on German crimes would follow
“Perdition eternal’’; Heaven would make this its care,
Nor need to be hustled, with plenty of time to spare.
Those words of mine I have a desire to swallow,
Finding, on further thought, which admits my offence,
That a few brief years of Coventry, of denied
Communion with Culture—used in the Oxford sense—
Are ample for getting our difference rectified.

If not to recant in prose his patriot rhymes?
I stamp my foot on my wrath's last smouldering ember,
And for my motto I take “Lest we remember.” O. S.
THE SUPERFECTION LAUNDRY.
I LET myself into my flat to find a young woman sitting
on one of those comfortless chairs designed by upholsterers
for persons of second quality who are bidden to wait in
the hall.
“You want to see me?” I inquired. “Yes; what is it?”
“I have called, Madam, to ask if you are satisfied with
your laundry.”
“Far from it,” I said. “It is kind of you to ask, but why?”
“Because I wish to solicit your custom for the laundry
I represent.”
“What faults do you specialise in?” I inquired.
“I beg your pardon, Madam?”
“Will you send home my husband's collars with an edge
like a dissipated saw 2"
The young woman's face brightened with comprehension.
“Oh, no, Madam,” she replied. “We exercise the great-
est care with gentlemen's stand-up collars.”
“Will you shrink my combinations to the size of a doll's?"
An expression of horror invaded her countenance. “The
utmost precaution,” she asserted, “is taken to prevent the
shrinkage of woollens.”
“Is it your custom to send back towels reduced to two
hems connected by a few stray rags in the middle?”
The young woman was aghast. “All towels are handled
as gently as possible to avoid tearing,” she replied.
“How about handkerchiefs 2 " I asked. “I dislike to
find myself grasping my bare nose through a hole in the
centre.” -
The suggestion made my visitor laugh.
“Are you in the habit of sewing nasty bits of red thread,
impossible to extricate, into conspicuous parts of one's
clothing?” - -
“Oh, no, Madam,” she asseverated; “no linen is allowed
to leave our establishment with any disfiguring marks."
“You never, I suppose, return clothing dirtier than when
it reached you?” I proceeded.
Suppressed scorn that I could believe in such a possibility
flashed momentarily from her eyes before she uttered an
emphatic denial. -
“Nor do you ever perhaps send home garments belonging
to other people while one's own are missing?”
“Never, I can assure you, Madam.”
“Does the man who delivers the washing habitually turn
the basket upside down so that the heavy things below
crush all the delicate frilly things that ought to be on top?"
She seemed incapable of conceiving that such perverted
creatures could exist.
“Do they never whistle in an objectionable manner
while waiting for the soiled clothes?”
“Whistling on duty is strictly forbidden, Madam.”
“Well, all these things I have mentioned my laundry does
to me, and even more, and when I write to complain they
disregard my letters.”
“We rarely have complaints, Madam, and all such receive
prompt attention. I can give references in this street—in
this block of flats even.”
“Well,” said I, “if you like to give me a card I am willing
to let you have a trial.” -
The young woman opened her bag with alacrity and
handed me a card.
“The Superfection Laundry,” I read with amazement.
“Surely there must be some mistake?”
“Are you not Mrs. Fulton 2" asked the young woman.
“No, you have come a floor too high. Mrs. Fulton lives
in the flat below me.”
“I must apologise for my call, then ; I was sent to see
Mrs. Fulton. But all the same may we not add you to the
list of our customers ?”
“Impossible,” I said.
“May I ask your reasons, Madam?”
“Because the laundry I employ at present is the Super-
fection.” -

It is extraordinary how many things
one ought to get hold of in the country.
Sometimes it is a wood-chopper and
sometimes a couple of hundred cab-
bages, and sometimes a cartload of
manure, and sometimes a few good
hens. I find this very exhausting to
the grip. -

They. To watch your house.
I. I do not wish to inflict pain on a
good dog. What kind of a dog ought
it to be 2
They. Well, a mastiff.
I. Isn't that rather a smooth kind of
dog? If I have to get hold of a dog, I
should like one with rather a rougher
surface. -
They. Try an Irish terrier.
I. I have. They fight.
They. Not unless they're provoked.
I. Nobody fights unless he is pro-
voked. But more things provoke an
Irish terrier than one might imagine.
The postman provoked my old one so
much that it bit the letters out of his
hand and ate them.
They. Well, you didn't get any bills,
then.
I. Yes, I did. Bills always came
when the dog was away for the week-
end. He was a great week-ender,
and he always came back from week-
ends with more and more pieces out of
his ears until at last they were all
gone, and he couldn't hear us when we
called him.
They. Well, there are plenty of other
sorts. You might have a Chow or an
Airedale or a boar-hound.
I. Thank you, I do not hunt boars.
Besides, all the dogs you mention are
very expensive nowadays. In the War
it was quite different. You could col-
lect dogs for practically nothing then.
My company used to have more than
a dozen dogs parading with it every
day. They had never seen so many
men so willing to go for so many long
walks before. They thought the Mil-
lennium had come. A proposal was
made that they should be taught to
form fours and march in the rear. But,
like all great strategical plans, it was
stifled by red tape. After that—
They. You are getting away from
the point. If you really want a good
cheap dog
I. Ah, I thought you were coming to
that. You know of a good cheap dog?
They. The gardener of my sister-in-
law's aunt has an extremely good cheap
dog.
# And would it watch my house?
They. Most intently.
That is how Trotsky came to us.
Nobody but a reckless propagandist
would say that he is either a mastiff or
a boar-hound, though he once stopped
when we came to a pig. I do not mind
that. What I do mind is their saying,
now that they have palmed him off on
me, “I saw you out with your what-
ever-it-is yesterday,” or “I did not
know you had taken to sheep-breed-
ing,” or “What is that thing you have
tied up to the kennel at the back?"
There seems to be something about the
animal's tail that does not go with its
back, or about its legs that does not go
with its nose, or about its eyes that does
not go with its fur. If it is fur, that is
to say. And the eyes are a different
colour and seem to squint a little. They
say that one of them is a wall-eye. . I

they are very handsome eyes in their
own different lines, and my opinion is
that he is a Mull-terrier; or possibly a
Rum. Anyhow he is a good dog to get
hold of, for he is very curly.
The village policeman came round to
the house the other day. I think he
really came to talk to the cook, but I
fell into conversation with him.
“You ought to be getting a licence
for that dog of yours,” he said.
“What dog?” I asked. -
“Why, you've got a dog tied up at
the back there, haven't you?” he said.
“Have I?” said I. .
And we went out and looked at it
together. Trotsky looked at me with
one eye and at the policeman with the
other, and he wagged his tail. At least
I am not sure that he wagged it;
“shook” would be a better word.
“Where did you get it?” he inquired.
“Oh, I just got hold of it,” I said
airily. “It's rather good, don't you
think?” -
He stood for some time in doubt.
“It's a dog,” he said at last.
I shook him warmly by the hand.
“You have taken a great load off
my mind,” I told him. “I will get a
licence at once.” -
This will score off them pretty badly.

EUCLID IN REAL LIFE.
IF it was not for the paper-shortage
I should at once re-write EUCLID, or
those parts of him which I understand.
The trouble about old EUCLID was that
he had no soul, and few of his books
have that emotional appeal for which
we look in these days. My aim would
be to bring home his discoveries to the
young by clothing them with human
interest; and I should at the same
time demonstrate to the adult how
often they might be made practically
useful in everyday life. When one
thinks of the times one draws a straight
line at right angles to another straight
line, and how seldom one does it EU-
cLID's way . . . every time one writes
a T . . .
Well, let us take, for example—
Book III., PROPosition 1.
PROBLEM.–To find the centre of a
given circle.
Let ABC be that horrible round bed
where you had the geraniums last year.
This year, I gather, the idea is to have
it nothing but rose-trees, with a great
big fellow in the middle. The question
is, where is the middle? I mean, if
you plant it in a hurry on your own
judgment, everyone who comes near
the house will point out that the bed is
all cock-eye. Besides, you can see it
from the dining-room and it will annoy
you at breakfast.
CoNSTRUCTION.—-Well, this is how
we go about it. First, you draw any
chord AB in the given bed ABC. You
can do that with one of those long
strings the gardener keeps in his shed,
with pegs at the end.
Bisect AB at D.
Now don't look so stupid. We've
done that already in Book I, Prop. 10,
you remember, when we bisected the
stick of nougat. That's right.
Now from D draw DC at right angles
to AB, and meeting the lawn at C. You
can do that with a hoe.
Produce CD to meet the lawn again
at E.
Now we do some more of that bisect-
ing; this time we bisect EC at F.
Then F shall be the middle of the
bed; and that's where your rose-tree
is going.
Proof???—Well, I mean, if F be not
the centre let some point G, outside
the line CE, be the centre and put the
confounded tree there. And, what's
more, you can jolly well join GA, GD
and GB, and see what that looks like.
Just cast your eye over the two tri-
angles GDA and GDB.
Don't you see that DA is equal to
DB (unless, of course, you've bisected
that chord all wrong), and DG is com-
mon, and GA is equal to GB-at least
according to your absurd theory about
G it is, since they must be both radii.
Radii indeed! Look at them. Ha, ha!
Therefore, you fool, the angle GDA
is equal to the angle GDB.
Therefore they are both right angles.
Therefore the angle GDA is a right
angle. (I know you think I'm repeat-
ing myself, but you'll see what I'm
getting at in a minute.) -
Therefore—and this is the cream of
the joke—therefore—really, I can't
help laughing—therefore the angle
CDA is equal to the angle GDA / . That
is, the part is equal to the whole—
which is ridiculous.
I mean, it's too laughable.
So, you see, your rose-tree is not in
the middle at all. -
In the same way you can go on
planting the old tree all over the bed
—anywhere you like. In every case
you'll get those right angles in the
same ridiculous position — why, it
makes me laugh now to think of it—-
and you'll be brought back to dear old
CE.
And, of course, any point in CE ex-
cept F would divide CE unequally,
which I notice now is just what you've
done yourself; so F is wrong too.
But you see the idea 2 -
What a mess you've made of the
bed |
Book I., PROPosition 20.
THEOREM.–Any two sides of a triangle
are together greater than the third side.
Let ABC be a triangle.
D
B C
CoNSTRUCTION. – You know the
eleventh hole 2 Well, let B be the tee,
and let C be the green, and let BC be
my drive. Yes, mine. Is it dead 2
Yes.
Now let BA be your drive. I'm
afraid you've pulled it a bit and gone
into the road by the farm. -
You can't get on to the green by the
direct route AC because you're under
the wall. You'll have to play further
up the road till you get opposite that
gap at D. It's a pity, because you'll
have to play about the same distance,

But we won't rub it in. Do you notice
anything odd about these triangles?
No? Well, the fact is that AD is equal
to AC, and the result of that is that the
angle ACD is equal to the angle ADC.

greater than its part, the angle ACD–
you must admit that 2 (Look out,

And therefore the angle BCD
Oh, well, I can't go into it all now or it
will mean we shall have to let these
people through; but if you carry on on
those lines you'll find that BD is greater
than BC.
I mean you've only got to go back to
where you played your third and you'll
see that it must be so, won't you ?
Very well, then, don't argue.
But BD is equal to BA and AC, for
AD is equal to AC; it had to be, you
remember.
Therefore—now follow this closely—
the two sides BA and AC are together
greater than the third side BC.
That means, you see, that by pulling
your drive out to the left there you
gave yourself a lot of extra distance to

THE CONSPIRATORS.
VI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, I was talking
to the Editor the other day about this
correspondence of ours which we are
conducting in the public Press, thus
saving the twopenny stamps and avoid-
ing the increased cost of living which
is hitting everyone else so hard.

victorious and content they were to be
made to believe by advertisement that
with a little trouble they could become
even more victorious and more content.
The KAISER and Imperialism had been
disposed of; it only remained to get rid
of Capitalism and Charles. The sub-
terranean campaign was developed, and
that is what our conspirators have since
been so brisk and busy about.
* That was the programme; but it is
turned up they were always just on their
way to England; either they had a poor
sense of direction or, being bad sailors,
were afraid of the crossing. There was
never any knowing in what corner of
the earth they would next be appear-
ing; in fact the only country which
those Chinese Bonds seemed to have
successfully avoided was China.
The first time we heard of them, I
will admit that we were thrilled. They
gave a touch of reality to an otherwise

been saying since 1918,” I re- |
plied; “but the question is i-
what to do about it 2 When
you get down to it, the word
‘Bolshevist’ is but the Russian
for ‘advanced Socialist,’ and
there is nothing to prevent

vanced or retarded. How then
are you going to put a stop to
Bolshevism 2" -
“I was thinking of the cor-
respondence,” the Editor re-
plied.
So I stopped talking to him
and sat down to write my last
letter to you on the subject.
To resume: In the summer
of 1918 the German War Lords
began to have their doubts of
a Pax Germanica and saw signs
rather of a Wash-out Ger-
manicum. Things looked ill
with them, so they consulted |
their doctor, a certain person
who called himself “Dr. Help-
us” by way of a jest. He
proved more successful as a
business man, however, than
he was as a humourist. He
advised that the “War of
World Conquest" was not
likely to produce a dividend,
because its name was against
it. Cut out “Imperialism”;
substitute another word, with
just as many syllables and no
less an imposing sound, “Pro-
letariat"; call the thing “Class
Warfare”; advertise it thor-

over-hairy and unconvincing
narrative of conspiracy. The
second time we were told of
them we were pleasurably
moved. So it was true, after
all, about those Chinese Bonds?
The third time we heard of
them we were satisfied; the
fourth time we heard of them
we were indifferent ; the fifth
time bored, the sixth time irri-
tated, the seventh time infuri-
ated, and the eighth time we
said to our informant, “Now
look you here. We appreciate
the excitement of your myster-
ious presence and the soothing
effects of your hushed voice,
and as long as you care to go
on revealing your secrets we
will listen. You may speak of
finance and you may even
touch upon British bank-notes
forged by the Soviets; you
may go so far as to divulge
some new forms of script in-
volved, getting as near as even,
say, Japanese Debentures; but
if you so much as mention
China or its Bonds to us again
we will wrap you up in a parcel
and post you to Moscow with
a personal note of warning to
LENIN as to your inner know-
ledge and the dangerous pub-
licity you are giving it.”
For ourselves we wrote many
a learned-treatise on the sub-
ject and sent many a thousand
memos home to those authori-
ties near to whose hearts the
oughly and attract to it all the political
egoists of disappointed ambition in the
various countries of the enemy, and the
German War Lords would find it no
longer necessary to crush all existing
nations, since all existing nations would
then set about to crush themselves.
The idea was voted excellent, and the
trial run in Russia gave complete satis-
faction.
But not all countries were so imme-
diately susceptible to the idea of a World
Revolution. Victory hath its charms
and does not predispose a people to com-
plain; so where the Masses (invested
with a capital “M” to flatter their

And so at last to the Chinese Bonds.
Oh, those Chinese Bonds ! How
some people abroad have learned to
curse the very mention of them these
last many months! I don't know where
that tiresome man, LITVINoFF, first got
them from, but my poor friends, whose
business all this is, were running after
them at least ten months ago. Some-
times they were in Russia, sometimes
they showed up in Denmark, sometimes
they got scent of them in Germany, and
I am told it is the merest fluke that the
Bonds did not come to Switzerland for
the winter sports. And wherever they
welfare of those Bonds should be. And
after many months of this correspon-
dence someone in the what-d'you-call-
it office suddenly sat up and took notice
and wrote to us as follows: “His
Majesty's Principal Secretary of State
for Thingummy has the honour to
| inform you that rumours have reached
his ears concerning the existence of
certain bonds, alleged to be Chinese,

acies or the conspirators you may now,

in making these frank statements as to
the working of, and against, the Conspi-
rators, I personally draw no pecuniary
benefit of any sort, not a sovereign, not
a bob, not a half-penny stamp. It is
perhaps better, however, to anticipate

that my frankness is being paid for at
so many pence per line.

THE CAGE.
'HE stood in the packed building, a
small lonely figure, pathetic in the
isolation that shut him off from the
warm humanity of the watching crowd.
He felt weak, ill, but he struggled
to bear himself bravely. He could not
move his eyes from the stern white
face that seemed to fill all the space in
front of him. About that cold mina-
tory figure, which was speaking to him
in such passionless even tones, clung
an atmosphere of awe; the traditional
robes of office lent it a majesty that
crushed his will.
He knew he was being addressed,
and he strove to listen. His brain was
a torrent of thoughts. And so his life
had come to this. It was indeed the
final catastrophe. That was surely what
the voice meant—that voice which went
on and on in an even stream of sound
without meaning. Why had he come
to this—in the flower of his life to lose
its chiefest gift, Liberty?”
Up and down the spaces of his brain
thought sped like fire. The people
behind—did they care? A few perhaps
pitied him. The others were indifferent.
To them it was merely a spectacle.
Suddenly into his mind crept the
consciousness of a vast silence. The
voice had stopped. The abrupt cessa-
tion of sound whipped his quivering
nerves. It was like the holding of a
great breath.
He gathered his forces. He knew
that the huge concourse waited. A ques-
tion had been put to him. It seemed
as if the world stood still to listen.
He moistened his lips. He knew
what he had meant to say, but his
tongue was a traitor to his desire.
What use now to plead 2 The sound-
lessness grew intolerable. He thought
he should cry aloud. -
And then—
“I will,” he said, and, looking side-
ways, caught the swift shy glance of
his bride.

• THE SPONGE.
THE sponge is not, as you suppose,
A funny kind of weed ;
He lives below the deep blue sea,
An animal, like you and me,
Though not so good a breed.
And when the sponges go to sleep
The fearless diver dives;
He prongs them with a cruel prong,
And, what I think is rather wrong,
He also prongs their wives.
For I expect they love their wives
And sing them little songs,
And though, of course, they have no
heart -
It hurts them when they're forced to
part—
Especially with prongs.
I know you'd rather not believe
Such dreadful things are done;
Alas, alas, it is the case;
And every time you wash your face
You use a skeleton.
And that round hole in which you put
Your finger and your thumb,
And tear the nice new sponge in two,
As I have told you not to do,
Was once his osculum.
So that is why I seldom wash,
However black I am,
But use my flannel if I must,
Though even that, to be quite just,
Was once a little lamb. A. P. H.
HOW TO MISS THE MISSING LINK,
WE understand that an expedition
will shortly leave the United States for
Central Asia in search of the Missing
Link. “Aeroplanes, motor cars, camels,
mules and all means of locomotion
found suitable will be used by the an-
thropologists, archaeologists and other
scientists” taking part.
We predict that an enterprise so
opposed to all the traditions of explora-
tion is doomed to failure. We cannot
doubt that the Missing Link possesses
a sense of smell keen enough to detect
a camel or a Ford car while yet afar
off. His regrettable elusiveness is more
likely to be established than overcome
when he beholds mules and anthro-
pologists, attended by aeroplanes and
motor-cars, and possibly whippet-tanks,
motor-scooters and phrenologists. Even
if there are only nine or ten of each
variety it will be enough to ensure that
the adventurers miss the Link after all.
Another aspect of the expedition
should be borne in mind. The pro-
gress through the jungle of such vehicles
and personnel would cause something
like consternation among the larger
fauna, whose limited intelligence might
reasonably fail to distinguish the pro-
cession from a travelling menagerie. In
these days of unrest is it right, is it ex-
pedient, thus to stir up species hatred?
It would be indeed deplorable if the
present quest were to be followed by a
search party got up to trace the missing
Missing Link expedition.
Surely the old methods of the explorer
are still the best. Simply equipped
with an elephant-rifle and a pith helmet,
let him plunge into the bush and be
lost to sight for a few years. Whereas
the Missing Link may be relied on to
remain resolutely beneath his rock at
the sight of a sort of a Lord Mayor's
Show wandering among the vegetation,
the spectacle of a simple-looking trav-
eller in the midst of the lonely forest
would rather encourage the creature to
emerge from its place of retreat.
Then nothing would remain but for the
explorer to advance with out-stretched
hand (preferably the left), and exclaim,
“The Missing Link, I presume?"

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, October 25th.-Sir PHILIP
LLOYD-GREAME, the newest recruit on
the Treasury Bench, already answers
Questions with all the assurance of the
other LLoyd G. His readiness in re-
ferring the inquisitive to other Depart-
ments and in declining to go beyond

somewhere behind the SPEAKER's chair
there must be a school for Under-Secre-
taries where the callow back-bencher
is instructed in the arts and crafts re-
quired in the seats of the mighty.
For this purpose I can imagine no
better instructor than the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL, who combines scrupulous
politeness with an icy precision of lan-
guage. Take, for example, his treatment
of Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING's defiant
inquiry if it would now be “compatible
with the dignity of the Government.”

“it cannot be compatible with anyone's

This week was to have been devoted,
de die in diem, to getting on with the
Government of Ireland Bill. But the
malignant sprite that has hithertofoiled
every effort to pacify Ireland again in-
tervened, and the House found itself
called upon to discuss the Emergency
Powers Bill. The measure is a peace-
time successor to D.O.R.A. (who in the
opinion of the Government is getting
a little passée) and, perhaps naturally,
met with little approval. Mr. Asquith,
while admitting that something of the
kind might be required, took exception
to the vagueness of its drafting. “What
is ‘substantial '2" he inquired. “Ask
SOMETHING “substanTIAL."
Mr. WILL Thorne.
them another ' " Mr. WILL THoRNE
joyfully interjected. “What is ‘sub-
stantial '2" repeated the Ex-PREMIER;
whereupon the Coalition with one voice
replied, “WILL THORNE.”
With consummate skill the PRIME
MINISTER managed to get the House
out of its hostile mood and to satisfy
the majority, at any rate, that the
measure was neither provocative nor
inopportune, but a necessary precau-
tion against the possibility that “direct
action” on the part of extra-Parlia-
mentary bodies might confront the
country with the alternatives of starva-
tion or surrender.
Tuesday, October 26th.-In these
troublous times the House gladly seizes
the smallest occasion for merriment.
There was great laughter when Colonel
YATE, the politest of men, inadvertently
referred to Sir ARCHIBALD WILLIAMson
as “the right honourable gent,” and it
broke forth again when, in his anxiety to
make no further slip, he addressed him
tout court as “the right honourable.”
There are some fifty thousand British
soldiers in Ireland, costing over a
million pounds a month. But Mr.
CHURCHILL took the cheery view that
after all they had to be somewhere,
and would cost nearly as much even in
Great Britain.
They would cost a good deal more
in Mesopotamia, where we have a
hundred thousand troops (British and
Indian), and the cost is two and a half
millions a month. Sir WILLIAM Joy N-
son-Hicks could not understand why
we should spend all this money “merely
to hand the country back to the rebels."
Mr. CHURCHILL said he had heard no-
thing about handing the country back
to the rebels; from which it may be
inferred either that he is not admitted
into all the secrets of the Cabinet or
that he draws a distinction between
“rebels” and “persons who object to
British rule.”
The Press campaign in favour of a
nickel three-halfpenny coin has not suc-
ceeded. In Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's opinion
it would not be a coin of vantage.
Among his objections to it may be the
extreme probability that the present
Administration would promptly benick-
named (I will not say nickel-named)
“the Three-half-penny Government.”
Owing to a number of concessions
announced by the HoME SECRETARY
the Emergency Powers Bill had a fairly
smooth passage through Committee.
Objections were still raised to making
an Emergency Act permanent—it does
sound rather like a contradiction in
terms — but the ATToRNEY-GENERAL
skilfully countered them by pointing
out that it was only the framework of
the machinery, not the regulations, that
would be permanent. One can imagine
the bold bad baron who set up a gallows
to overawe his villeins comforting ob-
jectors with the remark that after all it
was merely a framework—quite useless
without a rope.

A LITTLE difference of opinion on the
moral aspect of strikes which has been
ventilated in The Daily News has caused
one correspondent to write: “Let us
suppose that Mr.SILAs HockING regards
the serial rights of one of his novels as
worth £250. Suppose I offer him £100.
What does he do? He withholds his
labour; and quite right too!”
But does this analogy go far enough?
It would be a simple matter, for which
we might easily console ourselves, if
the author in question merely withheld
his own labour. But if he followed
modern strike tactics he would
do more.

Thursday, October 28th.-There being
no Labour Party in the House of Lords
the Emergency Powers Bill passed
through all its stages in a single sitting.
Even Lord CREwe did not challenge its
necessity in these troublous times, but
Lord AsKWITH was a little alarmed
at the possibility that “an unreasoning
Home Secretary"—as if there could
ever be such a monster!—might be over-
hasty to issue Orders in Council, and so
exacerbate an industrial dispute.

and there was much amusement when

As the PRIME MINISTER is popularly
supposed to be not averse from appear-
ing in the limelight, especially when
there is good news to impart, it is
pleasant to record that he left to Sir
RoBERT HoRNE the congenial task of
announcing that an agreement had
been reached with the Miners' Federa-
tion, and that the coal-strike was on
the high road to settlement. The
terms, as stated, seemed to be satisfac-
tory to all parties, and the only mys-
tery is why the negotiators should have
required the stimulus of a strike before
they could arrive at them.

Mr. W. W. JACOBS would ad-
dress mass meetings at the Docks,

embark on a resolute thirst-strike.
At the same time daily newspapers
would compete in offering solutions of
the problem. One would say, “For
goodness' sake give him the extra pal-
try one hundred and fifty pounds and
let the country get on with its work;”
and another would suggest a compro-
mise at one hundred-and-fifty guineas,
conditional upon the author's output.
Far from the simple withholding of
his labour by a single novelist, such a
turmoil would ensue as would not only
shake our intellectual life to its found-
ations, but would keep the PRIME
MINISTER engaged in the exploration
of interminable vistas of avenue.

YER own FICE Is A LUMP UGLIER."
A STRIKE IN FAIRYLAND.
THE fairies were holding a meeting.
“They grumble when we send the rain,” said a Rain-fairy,
“and they grumble when we don't.” .
“And we get no thanks,” sighed a Flower-fairy. “The
time we spend getting the flowers ready and washing their
faces and folding them up every night!”
“As for the stars,” said a Star-fairy, “we might just as
well leave them unlit for all the gratitude we get, and it's
such a rush sometimes to get all over the sky in time. They
don't even believe in us. We wouldn't mind anything if they
believed in us.”
“No,” agreed a Rainbow-fairy, “that's true. I take such
a lot of trouble to get just the right colours, and it has to be
done so quickly. But I wouldn't mind if they believed in us.”
“I wonder what they'd do,” said the Queen, “if no one
believed in them 2 ”
“They'd go on strike,” said the Brown Owl (he was
head of the Ministry of Wisdom). “They always go on
strike if they don't like anything.”
“Then we'll go on strike,” said the Queen with great
determination.
They all cheered, except the Flower-fairies.
“But the flowers,” they said, “they'll get so dusty with
no one to wash them, and so tired with no one to fold them
up at nights.”
“I hadn't thought of that,” said the Queen. “When
they go on strike,” she said to the Brown Owl, “how do
things get done 2"
The Brown Owl considered for a moment and everyone
waited in silence.
“Of course there are sometimes blacklegs,” he began.
“I don't know what blacklegs are,” said the Queen
cheerfully, “but we'll appoint some.” And she did.
“Is that all ?” said the Queen.
“Someone ought to have a sympathetic strike with us,"
said the Brown Owl. “They always do that.'
So a fairy was sent off to the Court of the Birds to
request a sympathetic strike. -
“Is that all?” said the Queen.
“You ought to talk more,” said the Brown Owl. “They
talk ever so much.”
“Yes, but they can't help it, can they?” said the Queen
kindly.
And so the strike began that evening.
None of the birds sang except one little blackleg Robin,
who sang so hard in his efforts to make up for the rest
that he was as hoarse as a crow the next morning. The
blackleg fairies had a hard time too. They hadn't a minute
to gossip with the flowers, as they usually did when they
flew round with their acorn-cups of dew and thistledown
sponges and washed their faces and folded up their petals
and kissed them good-night.
“But what's the matter?” said the flowers sleepily.
“We 're on strike,” said one of the other fairies im-
portantly; “not for ourselves, but for posterity.”
The Brown Owl had heard them say that.
Meanwhile the rest of the fairies sat silent and rather
mournful, awaiting developments.
Then a Thought-fairy flew in. Thought-fairies can see
into your heart and know just what you think. They get
terrible shocks sometimes.
“I've been all over the world,” she said breathlessly,
“and it's much better than you think. All little girls
believe in us and She paused dramatically.
“Yes?” they said eagerly.
“All fathers of little girls believe in us.”
The Queen shook her head.
“They only pretend,” she said.

THE opening RUN.
THE rain-sodden grass in the ditches is dying;
The berries are red to the crest of the thorn;
Coronet-deep where the beech-leaves are lying
The hunters stand tense to the twang of the horn;
Where rides are refilled with the green of the mosses,
All foam-flecked and fretful their long line is strung;
You can see the white gleam as a starred forehead tosses,
You can hear the low chink as a bit-bar is flung.
The world's full of music. Hounds rustle the rover
Through brushwood and fern to a glad “Gone away!”
With a “Come along, Pilot l”—one spur-touch and over—
The huntsman is clear on his galloping grey;
Before him the pack's running straight on the stubble—
“Toot-toot-too-too-too-oot / " “Tow-row-ow-ow-ow !”

And glittering away on the brown of the plough.
The front rank, hands down, have the big fence's measure;
The faint-hearts are craning to left and to right;

The grey takes the lot like a gull in his flight;
There's a brown crumpled up, lying still as a dead one;
There's a roan mare refusing, as stubborn as sin;
While the breaker flogs up on a green underbred one
And smashes the far-away rail with a grin.
The chase carries on over hilltop and hollow,
The life of Old England, the pluck and the fun;
And who would ask more than a stiff line to follow
With hounds running hard in the Opening Run? W.H.O.

IN PRAISE OF THE PELICANS.
THE pelicans in St. James's Park
On every day from dawn to dark
Pursue, inscrutable of mien,
A fixed unvarying routine.
Whatever be the wind or weather
They spend their time in peace together,
And plainly nothing can upset
The harmony of their quartet.
Most punctually by the clock
They roost upon or quit their rock,
Or swim ashore and hold their levée,
Lords of the mixed lacustrine bevy;
Or with their slow unwieldy gait
Their green domain perambulate,
Or with prodigious flaps and prances
Indulge in their peculiar dances,
Returning to their feeding-ground
What time the keeper goes his round
With fish and scraps for their nutrition
After laborious deglutition.
Calm, self-sufficing, self-possessed,
They never mingle with the rest,
Watching with not unfriendly eye
The antics of the lesser fry,
Save when bold sparrows draw too near
Their mighty beaks—and disappear.
Outlandish birds, at times grotesque,
And yet superbly picturesque,
Although resignedly we mourn
A Park dismantled and forlorn,
Long may it be ere you forsake
Your quarters on the minished Lake ;
For there, with splendid plumes and
hues
And ways that startle and amuse,
You constantly refresh the eye
And cheer the heart of passers-by,
Untouched by years of shock and strain,
Undeviatingly urbane,
And lending London's commonplace
A touch of true heraldic grace.
RING IN THE OLD.
THERE is a shabby-looking man who
(I read it in The Times) rings the bell
of London hospitals, asks to see the sec-
retary, presumes (as is always a safe
thing to do) that the establishment is
grievously in need of funds, and without
any further parley hands to the startled
but gratified official bank-notes to the
tune of five hundred pounds. He then
vanishes without giving name or ad-
dress. This unknown benefactor is
dressed in top-boots, riding breeches of
honourable antiquity, a black coat green
with age and a “Cup Final" cap. At
the same time (this too on The Times'
authority) there is an oddly and obso-
lescently attired lady going about who
also makes London hospitals her hobby.
She begins by asking the secretary if
she may take off her i. and, receiv-
ing permission, takes them off, places
her feet on an adjacent chair and hands
him two thousand pounds. .
The result of the activities of these
angelic visitants is that all the other
hospital porters have had instructions
from their eager and hopeful secretaries
to be careful to be polite to any and
every person, even though he or she
should be in rags, who expresses the
faintest desire to enter on business;
more than polite—solicitous, welcom-
ing, cordial; while all the secretaries
are at this moment polishing up their
smiles and practising an easy manner
with ladies in last century costumes who
put sudden and unexpected requests.
these curious occurrences entirely to
hospital servants, seems to me to lose
a great opportunity. Surely the con-
sequences will be more wide-reaching
than that? To my mind we may even
go so far as to hail the dawn of the
golden age for old clothes; for in the
fear that shabbiness may be merely
a whimsical disguise or the mark of
a millionaire's eccentricity the whole
world (which is very imitative and very
hard up) will begin to fawn upon it,
and then at last many of us will enter
the earthly paradise. -
But the gentleman who puts ease
before elegance and the lady who pre-
fers comfort to convention have got to
work a little harder yet. They must
not fold their hands at the moment
under the impression that their labours
are done. The support of hospitals is
humane and only too necessary, and
all honour to them for their generosity;
but other spheres of action await ex-
ploration.
I had hoped that the War was going
to reform ideas on dress and make
things more simple for those whose
trouser-knees go baggy so soon and re-
main thus for so long ; but, like too
many of the expectations which we used
to foster, this also has failed. It is
therefore the benign couple who must
carry on the good work. Let them, if
they really love their fellow-creatures,
go to a wedding or two (having pre-
viously given a present of sufficient
value to ensure respect) and display
their careless garb among the guests,
and then in a little while old garments
would at these exacting functions be-
come as fashionable as new and we
should all be happier.
I was asked to a wedding last week,
and should have accepted but for the
great Smart Clothes tradition. If The
Times' hero and heroine were to be-
come imaginatively busy as I suggest,
I could go to all the weddings in the
world. (Heaven forbid!) Receptions,
formal lunches, the laying of stones,
the unveiling of monuments, private
views—these ceremonies, now so full
of terrors for any but the dressy, could
be made endurable if only the gentle-
man in the black coat green with age
and the lady with the elastic sides
would show themselves prominently
and receive conspicuous attentions.
And then, if any more statues were
needed for the police to keep their
waterproofs on, one of them should be
that of an unknown philanthropical
gentleman who wears venerable top-
boots, and another that of a philan-
thropical lady who would rather be
without any boots at all, and the inscrip-
|tion on the pedestals would state that
The Times, in limiting the effect of
their glorious achievement was this:
They made old clothes the thing.

THE OLD BEER FLAGON.
(Many old English flagons are adorned
inside with grotesque figures of animals.)
WITHIN my foaming flagon
There crawls on countless legs
A lazy grinning dragon
That wallows in the dregs;
Of old I saw him nightly
Look up with friendly leer,
As if to hint politely, -
“I share your taste in beer!"
Through merry nights unnumbered
(From Boxing Day to Yule)
He'd greet me, ere I slumbered,
From out his amber pool;
But now he is beginning
To look a trifle strange;
His smile, once wide and winning,
Has undergone a change.
No more, as pints diminish
...(I wish the price grew less)
He hails me at the finish
With wonted cheeriness;
For, as I drain my mellow
Allowances of ale,
He seems to sigh, “Old fellow,
Will Pussyfoot prevail?”
Commercial Candour.
“Cleaning and pressing suites, $3. Dyeing
and pressing suits, $6. Clothes returned
looking like now.” -

importance of eliminating all unavoidable
expenditure in Municipal undertakings."

ECHOES OF THE COAL STRIKE.
“WHAT’S THE RID SHOUTING ABOUT 2 THERE AIN'T No RACING.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
“Two households, both alike in dignity. . . .” I ask
you, could the novel, of which this quotation is the text,
have been written by anyone but Mr. John GALsworthy 2
Actually indeed the disputants belong to two branches of
the same family, that grim tribe of Forsytes, whom you
remember in The Man of Property, and of whose collective
history the present book is a further instalment (not, I
fancy, the last). Ishould certainly advise anyone not already
familiar with the former work to get up his Forsytes therein
before attacking this ; otherwise he may risk some dis-
couragement from the plunge into so numerous a clan,
known for the most part only by Christian names, with
their complex relationships and the mass of bygone hap-
penings that unites or separates them. This stage of the
tribal history is called In Chancery (HEINEMANN), chiefly
from the state of suspended animation experienced by the
now middle-aged Soames (“Man of Property”) with regard
to his never-divorced runaway wife Irene. Following the
ruling Forsyte instinct, Soames wants a son who will keep
together and even increase his great possessions, while
continuing his personality. The expiring generation, repre-
sented by James, is urgent upon this duty to the family.
You may imagine what Mr. GALsworthy makes of it all.
These possessive persons, with their wealth, their hatred
and affections and their various strongholds in the more
eminently desirable parts of residential London, affect one
like portions of some monstrous stone-fronted edifice, im-
pressive but repellent. I have some curiosity to see, with
Mr. GALsworthy's help, how the Forsyte castle stands
the disintegration of 1914-18.
What with the scientists who explain things on the
assumption that we know nearly as much as they do and
those who explain things on the assumption that we know
nothing, it is very difficult for you and me to persevere in
our original determination to learn something. But I have
always felt that Sir RAY LANKESTER is one of the very few
who do understand us, and I feel it still more strongly now
that I have read his Secrets of Earth and Sea (METHUEN).
He is instructive but human; he does not take it for granted
that we know what miscegenation means, but he does
credit us with a little intelligence. And he realises how
many arguments we have had about questions like “Why
does the sea look blue?” Personally I rushed at that
chapter, though I must say that I was a little disappointed
to find that the gist of his answer was “Because water is
blue.”... You see, if you had a tooth-glass fifteen feet high
and filled it with water—— But you must find out for
yourself. Then I went on to the chapter on Coal, and
discovered that “it is fairly certain that the blacker coal
which we find in strata of great geological age was so pro-
duced by the action of special kinds of bacteria upon peat-
like masses of vegetable refuse.” I wonder if Mr. SMILLIE

know; that. It might help him to a sense of proportion.
The 3.uthor is constantly setting up a surprising but stimu-
lating relation between the naturalist's researches and the
problems of human life, as when he observes that “the
*colour bar' is not merely the invention of human prejudice,
but already exists in wild plants and animals,” and in his
remarks on mongrels and the regrettable subjection of the
males of many species. There are chapters on Wheel
Animalcules, Vesuvius, Prehistoric Art—everything—and all
are admirably illustrated. A fascinating book.
The Diary of a Journalist (MURRAY) is a volume of which
the title is its own sufficient description, save that it leaves
unsuggested the interest that such briskly written and
comprehensive comments as these of our old friend, Sir
HENRY LUCY, must command. His book differs from most
of those in the flood of recollections that has lately broken
upon us in being a selection from “impressions of the
moment written without knowledge of the ultimate result.”
worth it. Catherines, whether they marry or are given in
marriage, or do anything else, are really stationary; and,
since the persons of a story, if it is to be worth telling,
must move in some direction, Mr. HILTON will be well
advised in future to choose a different type of heroine. I
want to say too that I don't believe that it is either so
easy or so profitable to become a well-known pianist “not
in the front rank” as he seems to imagine it is. I wish I
could think that no one else would believe him.
It seems rather a bright idea of C. NINA BoyLE to
dedicate “to Thea and Irene, whose lives have lain in
sheltered ways,” a seven-shilling shocker about ways that
are anything but sheltered. Perhaps the sheltered in general,
and THEA and IRENE in particular, will take it from me that
the villainies of Out of the Frying Pan are much larger than
life or, at any rate, much more concentrated, and that
pseudo-orphans like Maisie usually have a better chance
of getting out of frying-pans into something cool than

minster to Bouverie Street, and round half the stately (or, at
least, interesting) homes of England. Of them all—not
forgetting DISRAELI and the peacocks and a new W. S.
GILBERT-my personal choice would be for the mystery
of the Unknown Guest, who not only took a place,
but was persuaded to speak, at a private dinner given by
Sir John HARE at the Garrick Club, without anyone ever
knowing who he was or how he came there. A genial
lucky-bag book, which (despite unusually full chapter head-
ings) would be improved by an index to its many prizes.
Mr. JAMEs HILTON is very young and very clever. If, as
he grows older, he learns to be clever about more interesting
things he ought to write some very good novels. Catherine
Herself (UNWIN) has red hair, but then she has a rather
more red-haired disposition than most red-haired heroines
have to justify it, so this is not my real objection to the
book. My quarrel is that, though I cannot call it an ugly
story without giving a false impression, it is certainly a
quite unbeautiful one, and at the end of its three hundred
and more pages it has achieved nothing but a full-length
portrait of an utterly selfish woman. Mr. HILtoN has
dissected her most brilliantly; but I don't think she is
such a father and mother would have been such a darling.
Perhaps Professor KARL PEARSoN will explain.
The Hon. William Toppys (pronounced “Tops"), brother
of Lord Topsham, left Devonshire and retired to an island in
the Torres Straits. There he married a Melanesian woman
and became the father of a frizzy-haired and coffee-
coloured son. It is a little strange to me, who think of
Mr. BENNET CoPPLESTONE as Devonian to the tip of his
pen-finger, that the Hon. William is not rebuked for so
shamelessly deserting his native county. Instead he is
almost applauded for his wisdom, and this despite the fact
that he quite spoilt the look of the family tree with his exotic
graft. For in the course of time his son, insularly known as
Willatopy, inherited the title and became twenty-eighth
(no less) Baron of Topsham. Mr. CoPPLESTONE does not
realise the vast difference between light comedy and broad
farce, but apart from this substantial reservation I can
vouch that his yarn of Madame Gilbert's Cannibal (MURRAY)
is deftly spun. Should you decide to follow the famous
Madame Gilbert when she visits the island where the
twenty-eighth baron lived you will witness a lively and
unusual entertainment.

BEFORE THE CENOTAPH.
November 11TH, 1920.
Not with dark pomp of death we keep their day,
Theirs who have passed beyond the sight of men,
O'er whom the autumn strews its gold again,
And the grey sky bends to an earth as grey;
But we who live are silent even as they
While the world's heart marks one deep throb ; and
them, - -
Touched by the gleam of suns beyond our ken,
The Stone of Honour crowns the trodden way.
Above the people whom they died to save
Their shrine of sleep is set; abideth there
No dust corruptible, nought that death may have ;
But from remembrance of the days that were
Rises proud sorrow in a resistless wave
That breaks upon the empty sepulchre. D. M. S.
OUR INVINCIBLE NAVY.
PRIZE-MONEY. -
THE really intriguing thing about Naval prize-money is
the fact that no one knows exactly where it comes from.
You don't win it by any definite act of superlative daring—
I mean to say, you don't have to creep out under cover of
darkness and return in the morning with an enemy battle-
ship in tow to qualify for a modicum of this mysterious
treasure. You just proceed serenely on your lawful occa-
sions, confident in the knowledge that incredible sums of
prize-money are piling themselves up for your ultimate
benefit. I suppose the authorities understand all about
it; nobody else does. One just lets it pile. It is a most
gratifying thought.
During the more or less stormy times of the First Great
War, we of the Navy were always able to buttress our
resolution with golden hopes of a future opulence denied
to our less fortunate comrades in the trenches. Whenever
the struggle was going particularly badly for us—when, for
instance, a well-earned shore-leave had been unexpectedly
jammed or a tin of condensed milk had overturned into
somebody's sea-boot—we used to console each other with
cheerful reminders of this accumulating fruit of our en-
deavours. “Think of the prize-money, my boy,” we used
to exclaim ; “meditate upon the jingling millions that will
be yours when the dreary vigil is ended;" and as by magic
the unseemly mutterings of wrath would give place to purrs
of pleasurable anticipation. Even we of the R.N.V.R.,
mere temporary face-fringes, as it were, which the razor of
peace was soon to remove from the war-time visage of the
Service—even we fell under the spell. “Fourteen million
pounds!” we would gurgle, hugging ourselves with joy in
the darkness of the night-watches.
In the months immediately following demobilisation I
was frequently stimulated by glittering visions of vast
wealth presently to be showered upon me from the swel-
ling coffers of a grateful Admiralty. During periods of
more or less temporary financial embarrassment I would
mention these expectations to my tailor and other rest-
less tradespeople of my acquaintance. “Fourteen millions
—prize-money, you know,” I would say confidentially;
“may come in at any time now.” I found this had a
soothing effect upon them.
As the seasons rolled by, however; as summer and winter
ran their appointed courses and again the primrose pranked
the lea unaccompanied by any signs of vernal activity on
the part of the Paymaster-in-Chief, these visions of mine
became less insistent. I was at length obliged to confess
that another youthful illusion was fading; prize-money
began to take its place in my mind along with the sea-
serpent and similar figures of marine mythology. I was
frankly hurt; I ceased even to raise my hat when passing
the Admiralty Offices on the top of a bus.
That was a month or two ago; everything is all right
again now. I once more experience the old pleasing thrill
of emotion when riding down Whitehall. I have come to
see how ungracious my recent attitude was.
A chance meeting with Bunbury, late sub-Loot R.N.V.R.
and a sometime shipmate of mine—Bunbury and I had
squandered our valour recklessly together aboard the Tyne
drifters in the great days when Bellona wore bell-bottoms—
sufficed to bring me head-to-wind.
In the course of conversation I referred to the non-
fulfilment of our early dreams; I spoke rather bitterly.
“And there are fourteen millions somewhere belonging
to us,” I concluded mutinously.
Bunbury regarded me with pained surprise. “Really,
old sea-dog,” he said, “this won't do. Never let the
engine-oil of discontent leak into the rum-cask of loyal
memories, you know. Now listen to me. Two years ago
you and I wore the wavy gold braid of a valiant life; we
surged along irresistibly in the wake of NELsoN ; we kept
the watch assigned. Does not your bosom very nearly
burst with pride to call those days to mind? It does.
What then 2 Has it never once occurred to you that the
last remaining link between us and the stirring past is
this very prize-money you are so eager to soil with the
grimy clutch of avarice? Don't you realize that this alone
exists to keep our memory green in the minds of our old
leaders at Whitehall 2 Picture the scene as it is. Someone
mentions the word ‘prize-money.' Immediately the Lords
of the Admiralty reach for their record files and begin
turning over the pages. They come upon the names of
John Augustus Plimsoll—yourself—and Horatio Bunbury
—me. 'Ah,’ they exclaim fondly, “two of our old gun-
room veterans—when shall we look upon their like again?’
Then they get up and go out to lunch.
“A month or so later the same thing occurs; once more
our names leap out from the type-written page. 'Brave
boys,' they murmur, ‘gallant lads! What should we have
done without them in the dark days? They shall have
their prize-money this very—why, bless my soul, if it isn't
one o'clock ' ' º
“Surely,” pursued Bunbury earnestly, “you appreciate
the fine sentimental value of this one last tie 2. As long
as our prize-money is in the keeping of the Service we can
still think of it with intimate regard; we can still call our-
selves BEATTY's boys and hide our blushes when the people
sing “Rule, Britannia.’ You must see that this is the only
large-hearted way of looking at the matter.”
“Bunbury, old sailor,” I said, swallowing a lump in my
throat, “you have done me good; you have made me feel
ashamed of myself.”
::: :k :k ::: :: ::: :
There can be no doubt that Bunbury is right. I am so
convinced of it that when next my tailor inquires anxiously
what steps are being taken for the distribution of prize-
money I shall put the matter to him just as Bunbury put
it to me. He is certain to understand.

Stout Gentleman (overhearing political discussion). “Look HERE, MY GooD FELLow—I've BEEN LISTENING To YoUR ARGUMENTs;
AND LET ME TELL You we 'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.” -
Politician. “LUMME, GUv'Nort, You'd BETTEIt coni E IN THE MIDDLE of IT THEN.”
UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.
I THINK the time has come for me to
follow the example of so many other
people and offer to the world a few
pen pictures of prominent statesmen of
the day. I shall not call them “Shav-
ing Papers from Downing Street,” nor
adopt the pseudonym of “The Man
with the Hot Water (or the Morning
Tea),” nor shall I roundly assert that
I have been the private secretary, the
doctor, the dentist or the washerwoman
of the great men of whom I speak.
Nevertheless I have sources of informa-
tion which I do not mean to disclose,
except to say that heavy persons who
sit down carelessly on sofas may un-
knowingly inflict considerable pain,
through the sharp ends of broken
springs, on those beneath.
I shall begin naturally with Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE.
There is probably no statesman of
whom such widely different estimates
have been formed as the present Prime
Minister of Great Britain. I have heard
him compared with THEMISTocLEs, with
MAccHIAvelli, with MIRABEAU (I think
it was MIRABEAU, but it may have been
one of those other people beginning
with “M” in French history. Almost
everybody in French history began with
an “M,” like the things that were drawn
by the three little girls in the well),
and even with the younger PITT. I
have heard him spoken of as a charla-
tan, as a chameleon, as a chatterbox,
and, by a man who had hoped that the
KAIs ER would be hanged in Piccadilly
Circus, as a chouser. Almost all of
these estimates are thoroughly fallaci-
ous. Let us take, for instance, MAC-
CHIAveLLI. It was the declared opinion
of MAccHIAveLLI that for the establish-
ment and maintenance of authority all
means may be resorted to and that the
worst and most treacherous acts of the
ruler, however unlawful in themselves,
are justified by the wickedness and
treachery of the governed. Has Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE ever said this? He
may have thought it, of course, but
has he ever said it 2 No. When one
considers that besides this dictum MAC-
cHIAvelli wrote seven books on the art
of war, a highly improper comedy, a life
of CASTRUccio CASTRACANI (unfinished,
and can you wonder 2), and was very
naturally put to the torture in 1513, it
will be seen how hopelessly the parallel
with Mr. LLoyd GEORGE breaks down.
Let us turn then to the younger
PITT. I have read somewhere of
the younger PITT that he cared more
for power than for measures, and was
ready to sacrifice great causes with
which he had sincerely sympathised
rather than raise an opposition that
might imperil his ascendency. That
is just the kind of nasty and long-
winded thing that anybody might say
about anybody. It was by disregarding
this kind of criticism that the younger
PITT kept on being younger. But apart
from this, does Mr. LLOYD GEORGE
quote HoRAce in the House? Never,
thank goodness. How many times did
WILLIAM PITT cross the English Chan-
nel? Only once in his whole life. That
settles it.
The predominant note—I may almost
say the keynote—of the PRIME MIN:
1stER's character is rather a personal
magnetism such as has never been
exercised by any statesman before or
after. When he rises to speak in the
House all eyes are riveted on him as
though with a vice until he has fin-
ished speaking. Even when he has

finished they sometimes have to be
removed by the Serjeant-at-Arms with
a chisel. His speeches have the moral
fervour and intensity of one of the
Minor Prophets—NAHUM or AMos, in
the opinion of some critics, though I
personally incline to MALACHI or HA-
BAKRUK. This personal magnetism
which Mr. LLoyd GEORGE radiates in
the House he radiates no less in
10, Downing Street, where a special
radiatorium has been added to the
breakfast-room to radiate it. Imaginean
April morning, a kingfisher on a woody
stream, poplar-leaves in the wind, a
shower of sugar shaken suddenly from
a sifter, and you have the man.
It has been said that Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE has quarrelled with some of
his nearest friends; but this again is a
thing that might happen to anybody.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE may have had
certain slight differences of opinion
with Lord NorthcLIFFE, but what
about HENRY VIII. and Wolsey 2 and
HENRY W. and Falstaff 2 and HENRY II.
and THOMAS A BECKET 2
Talking of THOMAS A BECKET, rather
a curious story has been told to me,
which I give for what it is worth. It
is stated that some time ago Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE was so enraged by attacks in
a certain section of the Press that he
shouted suddenly, after breakfast one
morning in Downing Street, “Will no
one rid me of this turbulent scribe 2"
Whereupon four knights in his secre-
tarial retinue drew their swords and
set out immediately for Printing House
Square. Fortunately there happened
to be a breakdown on the Metropolitan
Railway that day, so that nothing un-
toward occurred.
I sometimes think that if one can
imagine the eloquence of SAvonARola
blended with the wiliness of ULYsses
and grafted on to the strength and firm-
ness of OLIVER CROMwFLL, we have the
best historical parallel for Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE. It ought to be remembered
that the grandfather of OLIVER CROM-
WELL came from Wales and that the
PROTECTOR is somewhere described as
“Oliver Cromwell alias Williams.”
Something of that old power of dis-
pensing with stupid Parliamentary
opinion seems to have descended to
our present PRIME MINISTER. There
is one difference, however. OLIVER
CROMWELL's famous advice to his fol-
lowers was to trust in Divine Provi-
dence “and keep your powder dry.”
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE puts his powder
in jam. K.

THE whale has a beautiful figure,
Which he makes every effort to spoil,
For he knows if he gets a bit bigger

That is why he insists upon swathing
His person with layers of fat.
You have seen a financier bathing?
Well, the whale is a little like that.
At heart he's as mild as a pigeon
And extremely attached to his wife,
But getting mixed up with religion
Has ruined the animal's life.
For in spite of his tact and discretion
There is fixed in the popular mind
A wholly mistaken impression
That the whale is abrupt and unkind.
And it's simply because of the prophet
Who got into a ship for Tarshish
But was thrown (very properly) off it
And swallowed alive by “a fish.”
Now I should not, of course, have con-
tested
The material truth of the tale
If the prophet himself had suggested
That the creature at fault was a
whale.
But the prophet had no such sus-
picion,
And that is convincing because
He was constantly in a position
To see what the miscreant was.
And this is what punctures the bubble,
As JonAH, no doubt, was aware:
“A fish” was the cause of the trouble,
But the whale is a mammal. So

THE LIGHT FANTASTIC.
“DANCERs are born, not made,” said
John.
“Some are born dancers,” corrected
Cecilia, “others achieve dancing.”
“Well, I'm not going to have it thrust
on me anyway,” retorted John. “I never
have liked dancing and I never shall.
I haven't danced for years and years
and I don't intend to. I don't know
any of these new-fangled dances and I
don't want to.”
“Don’t be so obstinate,” said Cecilia.
“What you want doesn't matter.
You've got to learn, so you may as well
give way decently. Come along now,
I'll play for you, and Margery will show
you the steps.”
“If Margery attempts to show me
the steps I shall show her the door.
I won't be bullied in my own house.
Why don't you make your brother
dance, if somebody must?” said John,
waving his arm at me.
“Come on, Alan,” said Margery; “we
can't waste our time on him. Come and
show him how it's done.”
“My dear little sister,” I said sweet-
ly, “I should simply love it, but the fact
is—I can't.”
“Can't,” echoed Margery. “Why
not ? ''
“I hate to mention these things,”
I explained, “but the fact is I took part
in a war that has been on recently, and
I have a bad hip, honourable legacy of
same.”
“Oh, Alan,” said Margery, “how can
you ? Your hip's absolutely fit, you
know it is. You haven't mentioned it
for months.” -
“My dear Margery,” I said, draw-
ing myself up, “I hope your brother
knows how to suffer in silence. But
if you suppose that because I don't
complain Great heavens, child,
sometimes in the long silent watches
of the night * *
“Well, how about tennis, then 2"
said Margery. “You've been playing
all this summer, you know you have.”
“All what summer ?” I asked.
“That's a good one," said John ;
“I bet she can't answer that.”
“Don’t quibble,” said Margery.
“Don’t squabble,” said Cecilia.
“Yes, stop squibbling,” said John.
“I’m not quabbling,” said I.
John and I leaned against each other
and laughed helplessly. -
“When you have finished,” said Ce-
cilia with a cold eye, “perhaps you will
decide which of you is going to have
the first lesson.”
“Good heavens,” said John tragically,
“haven't they forgotten the dancing
yet?”
“We may as well give way, John,”
I said; “we shall get no peace until
we do.”
“I suppose not,” said John dismally.
“Very well, then, you're her brother;
you shall have first go.”
He waved me politely to Margery.
“Not at all,” I said quickly.
“Brothers-in-law first in our family—
always.” - -
“Could we both come together?”
asked John. -
“No, you can't,” said Margery.
“Then we must toss for it,” said
John, producing a coin.
“Tails,” I called.
“Tails it is,” said John, walking
across the room to Margery.
And the lesson commenced.
“Chassée to the right, chassée to the
left, two steps forward, two steps back-
ward, twinkle each way y -
“Five shillings on Twinkle, please,”
I interrupted.
Margery stopped and looked at me.
“You keep quiet, Alan,” shouted
Cecilia, cheerfully banging the piano.
“I shall never learn,” said John
miserably from the middle of the room,
“not in a thousand years.”
“Yes, you will,” encouraged Margery.
“Just listen. Chassée to the right,
chassée to the left, two steps forward,
two steps back, twinkle each way x -
“Take away the number you first
thought of,” I suggested, “and the
answer's the Louisiana Glide.”
“To finish up,” said Margery, “we
grasp each other firmly, prance round,
two bars . . .”
“That sounds a bit better,” said John.
“. . then waltz four bars,” continued
Margery, “and that's all. Come on,
In O.W.
They came on . . . .
“Good,” said Margery as they finished
up; “he's doing it splendidly, Cecilia.”
John beamed complacently.
“I got through that last bit rather
well,” he said; “'pon my word, there's
more in this dancing than I thought. I
quite enjoyed that twinkling business.”
“Have another one,” I suggested.
“Don’t mindif I do,” said John. “May
I have the pleasure?” with a courtly
bow to Margery.
They re-commenced.
“That's right,” said Margery; “now
two forward.” -
“I must have a natural genius for
dancing,” said John, conversing easily;
“I seem to . . . Do we twinkle next?”
“Yes,” said Margery.
“I seem to fall into it naturally.”
“Look out !” shrieked Margery.
I don't know exactly what happened;
I rather think John got his gears mixed
up in the twinkling business. At any
rate, one of his feet shot up in the air,
he made a wild grab at nothing and
tripped heavily backwards into the
hearth. The piano was drowned in
general uproar.
John arose with difficulty from the
ashes and addressed himself haughtily
to Cecilia.
“I can understand that these two,”
he said, waving a black but con-
temptuous hand at Margery and my-
self, “should scream with delight.
Their whole conception of humour is
bound up with banana-skins and
orange-peel. But may I ask why you
should have hysterics because your
husband has fallen into the fireplace?”
“‘You seemed to fall into it so
naturally,’” I quoted in a shaky voice.
“Darling,” sobbed Cecilia, “I am
trying—please—if only you would take
that piece of soot off your nose—”
She dabbed her eyes and wept help-
lessly.
John rubbed his nose quickly and
walked to the door.
“If you want my opinion of danc-
ing,” he said bitterly, “I think it's a
low pagan habit.”
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star,’” sang
Margery. -
“Bah!" said John, and banged the
door. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GENF AND THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
“Genf,” like “Genève,” is the Swiss
for “Geneva.” It was selected, nearly
two years ago, as the seat of the League
of Nations. In a few days the League
arrives; and I doubt if any person, firm,
company, corporation or league, having
provided itself with a seat, ever waited
so long before it came and sat upon it.
You will remember a learned treatise
of mine in these pages on the subject of
Lucerne, written in August last, when
our PRIME MINISTER came and sat there.
Imakemy living by writing up the towns
of Switzerland as one by one they get
sat on. As there are not more than half-
always brimful of International Unions,
Leagues, Congresses and Conferences.
The lake is navigated in the season by
a fleet of sizeable steamers, and one of
these, a two-hundred tonner, used to
call every morning of the season at
the little pier outside my house to take
me to business, and brought me back
again every evening. By the pier rests
an old, old man whose only duty in life
it is to catch the hawser as it is thrown
from the incoming liner. Twice a day
for four months that hawser was thrown
for the old man to catch, and twice a
day for four months he missed it. I
spoke to him about this on the last
do in similar circumstances. Stepping
out of the station exit it will hurry off
to its hotel. But when Leagues go to
hotels they buy the darned things
outright. I don't know what they do
about notices on the walls; alter some
and remove others, no doubt. The in-
ternational delegates will be requested
to ring once for the political expert,
twice for the military expert and three
times for the naval expert. If my old
man gets the last-named job they will
have to ring rather more than three
times if they want him to come up at
once and discuss schemes for read-
justing the various oceans. . . . -
As to the other usual decorations of
a -dozen eligible
towns in Switzer-
land, and as we shall
have exhausted two
of them in less than
half a year, the liv-
ing I make is a pre-
carious one; in
other words I shall
soon be dead. Well,
well! A short life and
a merry one, say I.
You must admit a
touch of subtle mer-
riment in that word
“Genf.”
To get to Geneva
you provide your-
self with a passport,
a book of rail and
steamer tickets, a
ticket for a seat in
the Pulman car, a
ticket for a berth in
the sleeping-car and
a ticket for the re-
gistration of your
luggage. In short,
by the time you are
in France you will

the notice will be
removed, which in-
forms all concerned
that the manage-
ment will not be held
responsible for valu-
ables, unless these
be deposited in the
office safe, though
this will not be in-
tended to indicate
that the new man-
agement has doubts
as to the safety even
of its own safe.
The “ Hôtel Na-
tional,” which is the
hotel in question,
was in process of
complete reconstruc-
tion when the pur-
chase took place, A
bathroom has been
annexed to every
room. Presumably
every international
delegate will have a
suite allotted to his
nation. The question
have had pass through your hands one
passport and eleven tickets; and the
first thingyou will doupon settling down
into the French train is to compete and
intrigue to get a twelfth ticket for your
lunch. You will find that this useless
ticket will follow you all the way to
Geneva and will always assert itself
when you are accosted by a ticket in-
spector. I even know a traveller who
arrived eventually at the Swiss frontier
with no other paper of identity or justi-
fication; for a passport which should
have given his name, address, motive
for travelling, shape of mouth, size of
nose and any other peculiarities, he
could only tender documentary evidence
of his having eaten the nineteenth lunch
of the first series of the day before.
Two things catch the eye about
Geneva. In the first place it is on a
lake, and in the second place it is
which nothing can depress. Next
season he means to try again. As he
will be out of a job in the interval I am
plotting to secure for him the post of
naval expert to the League.
Turning from the lake to the in-
ternational delegates, who abound in
Geneva, it is to be noted that the last
lot here were the International Congress
of Leagues of Women. Their main
agendum was to pronounce their com-
plete independence of men. One of
these delegates went for a row on the
lake and fell in. She was pulled out
again by a man.
You will find that Geneva was nomi-
nated as the seat of the League in the
Peace Treaty of Versailles. Ever since,
the people of Geneva have been busy con-
jecturing what the League of Nations
will do upon its arrival in Geneva. It
will do exactly what you and I would
I ask myself is this, Will he put himself
in the room and his secretaries in the
bathroom, or himself in the bathroom
and the secretaries in the room ? And
the answer I make to myself is as fol-
lows: The delegate will appoint the
room to be his room and the bathroom
to be his bathroom and will leave his
secretaries to make the best of things
out in the corridor. The suggestion
you will probably make is that there
are more suites of rooms than nations;
that I must leave you to work out for
yourself. The number of suites of rooms
is ascertainable, but no one seems able
to inform me how many nations there
are. Personally every time I pick up
a newspaper I seem to discover a new
one. However that may be, the nations
are now all formed into their League,
and may the best one win the Cup
Final, say Il F. O. L.

FOR THE CHILDREN.
Mr. Punch comes once more, hat in hand, to beg for help
in a good cause. This time he asks the generous aid of his
readers on behalf of the Victoria Home at Margate, of which
Her Majesty the QUEEN is Patroness. This Home cares
for invalid children, from very little ones of only a few
months old, to boys of twelve years and girls of fifteen.
There is room for between fifty and sixty of them and they
stay, on an average, for the best part of a year, during
which they receive careful medical attention, and have all
their needs tended, body and mind. Many of them have
lost a leg or an arm and nearly all have some bandaged
limb, yet, with these disabilities, they contrive to learn the
duties of a loyal Scout and are very proud of their uniform.
The cost of drugs, of surgical dressings and all house-keep-
ing necessaries has risen enormously and the Home is
compelled to plead for further help. Mr. Punch invites his
readers to send for a report and see for themselves the very
touching pictures which it gives, in an admirable set of
photographs, of the life of these children in their happy
surroundings.
All communications and gifts should be addressed to the
Secretary of the Victoria Home for Invalid Children, at
75, Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road, S.W.

THE NEW JOURNALISM,
[“In New York Mr. Harding leads by a figure something like the
circulation of The Daily Mail. Pennsylvania gives him a majority
which appears equal to the circulation of The Evening News. It is
phenomenal.”—The Evening News.]
THE method which is being used just now by some of
Mr. Punch's contemporaries to draw attention to their cir-
culations does not, it will be seen, tend to numerical nicety,
though doubtless it has its advantages from the advertising
point of view. The following items of news are intelligently
anticipated. * * *
The licences cancelled in one district in Scotland, as a
result of the recent local veto poll, total exactly half the
number of quires of “returns” of last week's Pawkiesheils
Gazette. It is insignificant.

An analysis of the miners' votes in the Lancashire coalfield
proves that there were as many men in favour of rejecting
the Government proposals as would have provided ten readers
for each copy sold (not merely printed) of the last issue of
The Chowbent and Chequerbent Chronicle. It is magnificent.

It is estimated that, if three more distinguished statesmen
and another woman of letters can be prevailed upon to write
piquant reviews of Mrs. Asquith's autobiography, the sale
of the work will probably greatly exceed the numbers of
copies of the latest Blue Book issued by H.M. Stationery
Office. It is unthinkable.

It is confidently expected that, if the protests against a
certain cinema plot can be sustained for a few days longer,
as many people will go to see the show in the first week as
there are feet in the film—without counting those who
will sneak round for a free view of “The Stage Door of the
Diadem Theatre.” It is good business.

At that price they must have been very plain cooks.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 1st.—In response
to a renewed demand for the Admir-
alty's account of the Battle of Jutland
the PRIME MINISTER made the remark-
able statement that it was very difficult
to get “an official and impartial ac-
count,” but he added that the Govern-
ment were willing to publish all the
reports and despatches on the subject
and leave the public to judge.
Who shall decide, when Admirals disagree?
Why, JULIAN Corbett, or the great B.P.
Owing to the unexpectedly rapid
passage through Committee of the
Government of Ireland Bill last Friday,
the way was cleared for a number of
British measures. Although dealing
with the most diverse subjects they
were alike in one respect—without ex-
ception they incurred the hostility of
Sir F. BANBURY. Whether it was a
proposal to reduce the dangers of em-
ploying women in lead processes or to
give married women in Scotland the
same privileges as their English sisters
(including the duty of supporting an
indigent husband), or to hold an Em-
pire Exhibition, or to set up Juvenile
Courts, the hon. baronet found reason
for opposing them all.
Once or twice he secured the support
of Sir John REEs, but for the most
part he was Athanasius contra mundum,
maintaining his equanimity even when
Mr. Hogg|E advised him to “marry a
“ATHANASIUS CONTRA MUNDUM.”
SIR FREDERick BANBURY.
Scotswoman,” or Lady Astor expressed
her regret that he had not women, in-
stead of bankers, for his constituents.
The Government had no reason to
complain of his activity, which may
indeed have prevented the intrusion of
more dangerous critics; for despite his
efforts every Bill went through.
Tuesday, November 2nd.—The most
striking thing in Lord Loreburn's
speech upon Irish affairs seemed to me
to be his uncompromising declaration
“No supporter of Mr. Asquith.”
LORD LOREBURN.
that he was “no supporter of Mr.
Asquith.” He endorsed, however, his
former chief's demand for an inde-
pendent inquiry into the reprisals, but
his motion was defeated by 44 to 13.
Ever since Sir W. JoyNsoN-Hicks
defeated Mr. CHURCHILL at Manchester
he has felt it his duty to keep on his
track. Convinced that our policy in
Mesopotamia is due to the WAR MIN-
IsTER's megalomania he is most anxious
to bring him to book. The prospect of
a Supplementary Estimate for the Army
seemed likely to furnish the desired
occasion. But when he pressed Mr.
CHURCHILL on the subject the alleged
spendthrift airily replied that there was
no hurry; “I do not immediately re-
quire money.”
The gloom of the daily Irish cate-
chism was a little brightened by an
interchange of pleasantries between
Mr. STANTON and Mr. JACK Jon Es. On
this occasion the latter had rather the
best of it. “Golliwog ' " he shouted in
allusion to his opponent's luxuriant
chevelure. Mr. STANTON could think of
no better retort than the stereotyped
“Bolshiel" and when Mr. Jon Es re-
joined with “You ought to be put into
Madame Tussaud's "Mr. STANTON was
reduced to silence. But is it not a
scandal that these entertaining come-
dians should only get four hundred
a year?
On the Agriculture Bill Sir A. GRIF-
FITH - BoscAweN was faced with an
urgent demand for a separate Wages
Board for Wales. First he wouldn't; it
would be “an exceedingly inconvenient
and expensive arrangement.” But the
Welshmen were so insistent that he
changed his mind, and when the vigilant
Sir FREDERICK BANBURY challenged the
new clause on the ground that it would
impose a fresh charge on the Exchequer
Sir ARTHUR was able to convince the
SPEAKER that, though there would be
“additional expenditure,” there would
be no “fresh charge.” Such are the
nice distinctions of our Parliamentary
system.
Wednesday, November 3rd.—When
Mr. CHURCHILL, some sixteen years
ago, crossed the floor of the House, his
manoeuvre was regarded as a portent,
and men talked of “a sinking ship.”
It cannot be said that Lord HENRY
BENTINCR's sudden appearance among
the Labour Members created anything
like the same sensation, even though he
was joined a little later by Mr. Oswald
Mosley. Lord HENRY has always de-
rived his political opinions rather from
his heart than his head, and has lately
developed a habit of firing explosive
Questions at Ministers from his eyrie
behind their backs. They will probably
find his frontal attackslessdisconcerting.

covery after an experience of barely as
many weeks. From his new perch he
inquired this afternoon if Government
cement was being sent abroad, to the
detriment of British builders. Dr.
ADDIsoN contented himself with pro-
fessing ignorance of any such transac-
tion. A less serious Minister might
have replied that the Government
needed all their cement to mend the
cracks in the Coalition.
News that the coal-strike was over
reached the House during the evening.
Mr. BRIDGEMAN, always cautious, “un-
derstood " that the men had been
“recommended " to go back to work.
Mr. ADAMSON, fresh from the Confer-
ence, was much more downright. “The
strike,” he said, “has been declared off,
and the men return to
work.” So that 's that.
Thursday, November
4th. — Lord SALIS-
BURY's complaint that
the Government's pol-
icy in Egypt was
shrouded in more than
Egyptian darkness
brought a spirited re-
ply from Lord CUR-
zoN, who declared that
every stage in the ne-
gotiations had been Ž
fully revealed in the /
Press. If no definite 4
decision as to the fu- º
ture government of
the country had been
published that was
simply because the
Cabinet had not yet
had time to make up
its collective mind.
Judging by Lord MIL-
NER's subsequent ac-
count of his Mission,
it would appear that
the process will be long and stormy.
The Mission went to Cafro to sound
the feeling of the Nationalists, but for
all practical purposes they limight as
well have stopped in London, where
they ultimately interviewed ZAGHLUL
PAshA and his colleagues, and obtained
information which materially altered
and softened their previous views. The
best Nationalists were not anti-British,
but simply pro-Egyptian. Lord MIL-
NER's final appeal, that his piece should
not be hissed off the stage before it had
been heard, sounded a little ominous.
Mr. L'EstraNgE MALONE is not very
popular in the House of Commons just
now. When he rose to address a “Sup-
plementary" to the WAR MINISTER he
was so persistently “boo-ed” that the
SPEAKER had to intervene to secure
him a hearing. Mr. LowTHER probably
repented his kindness when it appeared
that Mr. MALONE had nothing more
urgent to say than that Mr. CHURCHILL
would be better employed in looking
after the troops in Ireland than in re-
viewing books for The Daily Mail.
For the third day in succession Mr.
T. P. O'ConnoR essayed to move the
adjournment in order to call attention
to what he called “the policy of fright-
fulness” in Ireland. This time the
SPEAKER accepted the motion, but the
ensuing debate was of the usual incon-
clusive kind. Mr. DEVILIN gave another
exhibition of stage-fury. He objected
to the word “reprisals” being used for
the “infamies” going on in Ireland,
declared that the Government were
responsible for all the murders and pro-
phesied that the present CHIEF SECRE-
“Old Mother Goose was delighted when she saw what a fine bird her son had
provided her with.”
WALES AND SIR. A. GRIFFITH-BoscAWEN.
TARY, “with all his outward appearance
of great masculinity,” would fail, as
BALFour and CROMwFLL–the House
enjoyed this concatenation—had failed
before him.
In points of detail Sir HAMAR GREEN-
wood conceded a little more to his
critics than on some former occasions.
He undertook to consider whether the
Government should compensate the
owners of creameries or other property
wrongfully destroyed; and he admitted
that some constables had exceeded their
duty, nine of them being actually under
arrest on various charges. But on the
main point he was adamant. Quoting
the remark of a police-sergeant at Tralee,
“They have declared war upon us and
I suppose war it must be,” the CHIEF
SECRETARY said in his most emphatic
tones, “War it will be until assassina-
tion stops.”
STUTTFIELD AND THE REDS.
Stuttfield was nothing of a NERo.
He would never have fiddled while
Rome burned. He would have been
more likely to imagine that Rome was
burning when there was really nothing
more going on than a bonfire. He is
one more example of the pernicious
influence of sensational literature upon
a nervous temperament.
It all began through Stuttfield find-
ing a copy of The Daily Blast in a rail-
way carriage last June. This journal
is printed on white paper, but the ten-
dency of its contents is ruddy—that is
to say, it has “Red” leanings. It was
a revelation to Stuttfield.
“Are people
allowed to say such
things?” he asked me
in horror.
“My dear fellow, no
one takes itseriously,”
I said. “Don't you
worry.”
But Stuttfield did
worry. The Daily
Blast had the same
effect upon him as a
snake has upon a rab-
bit ; it terrified him,
yet he could not run
away from it. In fact
he became a regular
subscriber and con-
tinued so despite some
; rumours that it was
# supported financially
; by the Rougetanians
—rumours which re-
quired, and received,
a great deal of ex-
planation.
Then, through the
offices of his man-ser-
vant, he obtained a
copy of The Volcano.
The Volcano appears to be in advance
of The Daily Blast in its ideals, and im-
mensely so in their expression. But
here again I assured Stuttfield that no
one took them seriously. “I don't sup-
pose they take themselves seriously,”
I assured him. “They want to sell
The Volcano, that 's all.”
“Yes,” said Stuttfield, “but they do
sell it, and people read it.”
“I expect the circulation's about
two thousand a week,” I said consol-
ingly. But Stuttfield, as I could see,
was not consoled.
I met him at intervals after that,
and on each occasion he seemed to be
more obsessed with the notion that
the “Reds” would overwhelm us all
shortly.
“Russia is Red,” he whispered; he
always whispers now for fear of being
overheard by a Red agent, though

there was not very much risk of that
in St. James's Street. “And what
about India and China 2 ”
“Red, black and yellow—the Zingari
colours,” I said ribaldly, and Stuttfield
left me in disgust. -
Then I heard from a friend that he
had sold his cottage at Redhill. This
was a bad sign, and I went to see him.
I found him much worse.
“You’ve taken an overdose of The
Volcano,” I said.
He seized my arm with trembling
fingers.
“The Red Revolution is upon us,”
he hissed.
I laughed. “Don’t you worry about
the Red Revolution. You come out to
lunch.”
He would hardly be persuaded. Clubs
and restaurants would be attacked first,
he thought. If we lunched together it
had better be in an eating-house in Ber-
mondsey. “I have a disguise,” he said,
and disclosed a complete proletarian
outfit.
“Well, I haven’t,” I said. “Not that
these clothes of mine will lead anyone
to mistake me for a capitalist. But, so
far as lunch goes, hadn't we better be
killed by a Red bomb at the Fitz than
by tripe in Bermondsey 2”
Stuttfield could not but admit the
sense of this, so we started out.
It is widely recognised that Flag
Days, however admirable their objects,
have been a little overdone. But it was
sheer bad luck that brought Stuttfield
face to face with a flag-seller just as we
were entering the Fitz. She came at
him with a determined aspect and began
“The Red Cr—”
It was enough. Poor Stuttfield was
across the pavement and into a taxi
before I could stop him. There was
nothing for me to do but follow him.
“Where are we going?” I asked.
“Waterloo,” he answered through
blanched lips. I could get uothing more
from him.
At Waterloo he sprang out, leaving
me to pay the cab, and disappeared into
the station. I followed as quickly as I
could, but he was nowhere to be seen.
“Where would he go to hide from the
Reds?” I asked myself. Suddenly I
had an idea about his destination.
I was right. In the foremost carriage
I found him. I tried to persuade him
to come out, but he clung to the rack.
So I left him. I have not seen him since.
I hope he feels safe in the Isle of
Wight. -

Client. “OH, THAT MUST BE THE AGENT who's BEEN worſty ING ME To INsu RE MY LIFE."
THE MOTHER-IN-LAW MYSTERY.
IN a provincial paper I find the fol-
lowing passage:–
“Counsel stated that the prisoner's mother
was in court. Later he informed the Judge
that he had made a mistake; it was the pris-
oner's mother-in-law. A general laugh through-
out the court followed this ‘correction.’”
We have here in a nutshell the case
for traditional communal humour, and
once again we are set to wondering why
—except possibly to allay some whim-
sical twinges of self-respect—drama-
tists ever try to invent new jokes at all.
Even more are we set to wondering why
this particular joke never fails.
In the present case the injustice
done to an honourable class of women
—that is to say, those who provide
lovers with their loves (for that is how
these relationships begin) — was the
greater because no doubt, when the
laughter had subsided a little, every eye
sought for the lady in question. Nor-
mally we have not the opportunity of
visualising the butt at all. It is enough
that she should be mentioned. Nor
would any grotesque details in her cos-
tume or physiognomy make the joke
appreciably better. It requires no such
assistance; it is rich enough without
them; to possess a married daughter
is all that is necessary to cause gusts
of joyful mirth.
That it is not the lady herself who
is funny could—no matter how Gothic
her figure—be proved in a moment
by placing her in the witness-box and
asking her to state her relationship to
the prisoner's wife. She would say, “I
am her mother,” and nothing would
happen. But if the question were,
“What is your relationship to the pris-
oner?” and she replied, “I am his
mother-in-law,” sides would split. Simi-
larly one can imagine that if the hus-
band's reply to the counsel's question,
“Who was with you?” had been, “My
wife was with me,” there would have
been no risible reaction whatever; but
if the reply had been, “My wife's mother
was with me,” the place would have
been convulsed. Of course the true
artist in effect would never say, “My
wife's mother,” but “My mother-in-
law.” It is the “in-law " that is so
exquisitely amusing and irresistible.
But both would be the same person:
the gravest thing on earth, it might be,
in every other respect—even sad and dig-
nified—but ludicrous because her daugh-
ter happened to have found a husband.
To inquire why the bare mention of
the mother of a man's wife should
excite merriment is to find oneself in-
stantly deep in sociology—and in some
of its seamiest strata too. While ex-
ploring them one would make the odd
discovery that, whereas the humour
that surrounds and saturates the idea
of a wife possessing a maternal relative
is inexhaustible, there is nothing laugh-
able about the mother of a husband.
A wife can talk of her husband's mother
all day and never have the reputation
of a wit, whereas her husband has
but to mention her mother and he is
the rival of the Robeys.
As for fathers-in-law, low comedians
would starve if they had to depend on
the help that fathers-in-law give them.
Fathers-in-law do not exist. Nor do
brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, except
as facts; but the joke is that they can
be far more interfering (interference
being at the root of the matter, I take
it) than anyone in the world. It is
the brother-in-law who knows of ab-
solutely safe gilt-edged investments
(which rarely succeed), and has to be
helped while waiting for something to
turn up; it is the sister-in-law who is
so firmly convinced that dear Clara
(her brother's wife) is spoiling the chil-
dren. But both escape; while many
really charming old ladies, to whom
their sons-in-law are devoted, continue
to be riddled by the world's satirical
bullets.
What is to be done about it? Nothing.
Only the destruction of the institution
of marriage could affect it. E. W. L.

advertisement columns of the daily
papers and note the recurrence, in the
announcements of impending concerts,
of names of a strangely outlandish and
exotic form. In a single issue I have
encountered KRISH, ARRAU, Kou Ns and
DINH GILLY. The Christian names of
some of these eminent performers are
equally momentous and perturbing, e.g.,
JASCHA, KofZA and UTT.
My grounds for perturbation are not
imaginary or based on the hallucina-
tions of a hypersensitive mind. They
are prompted and justified by the
notorious facts, established by the

leading psycho-analysts, that, just as
mellifluous and melodious names exer-
cise a mollifying influence on the ac-
tivities of the sub-conscious self, so the
possession or choice of strange or fer-
ocious appellations incites the bearer, if
I may be permitted to use so common-
place a term, to live up to his label.
It is therefore with all the force at my
command that I entreat and implore
singers, players and dancers to think,
not once but twice or thrice, before they
yield to the fascination of the unfamiliar
and adopt artistic pseudonyms calcu-
lated to intensify the “urges” of their
primitive instincts. It is not too much
to say that a singer who deliberately
assumes the name of Pongo, Og or
Botuloffsky runs a serious risk, in vir-
tue of the inherent magic of names, of
developing qualities wholly unfitted for
the atmosphere of a well-conducted
concert-hall. -
I believe that the question of estab-
lishing a censorship of artists' names
has been seriously considered by Dr.
ADDIsoN, in view of its bearing on pub-
lic hygiene, and that he estimates the
cost of staffing the new department as
not likely to exceed seven hundred and
fifty thousand pounds a year. Still, in
these days when State economy is so
needful, it would be better if the desired
effect were attained by the pressure of
enlightened public opinion rather than
by the operations of even so inexpensive
a department as that contemplated by
the MINISTER of HEALTH.
IN FLANDERS FIELDS.
THESE famous verses, which origin-
ally appeared in Punch, December 8th,
1915, being the work of a Canadian
officer, Lieut.-Colonel McCRAE, who
fell in the War, have been subjected
to so many perversions—the latest in
a letter to The Times from a Minister
of the Crown, where the closing lines
are misquoted as follows:
“If ye break faith with those of us who died,
We shall not sleep, though poppies bloom in
fields of France ''-
that Mr. Punch thinks it would be
well to reproduce them in their correct
form:—
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.
AT THE PLAY.
“FEDORA.”
IT may or may not be well that the
War has modified our estimate of the
value of life; but it is a bad thing for
the legitimate drama. And in the case
of Fédora the bloody régime of LENIN
has so paled our memory of the terrors
of Nihilism that SARDou's play seems
almost further away from us than the
tragedy of Agamemnon. In our callous
incapacity to be thrilled by the ancient
horrors of forty years ago we fall back
on the satisfaction to be got out of the
author's dexterity in the mechanics of
his craft.
And here the critic's judgment is also
apt to be more cold-blooded. He recog-
nises the crude improbability of certain
details which are essential to the tragic
development of the play. The death of
Count Vladimir (accented on the first or
second syllable according to the tempo-
rary emotion of the speaker) was due to
the discovery of a letter in an unlocked
drawer where it could never possibly
have been thrown, being an extremely
private letter of assignation. The death
of Fédora, again, was the direct result of
a letter which she despatched to Peters-
burg denouncing a man who proved, in
the light of fresh facts learned a few
minutes later, to be the last (or last
but one) that she would wish to injure.
It is incredible that she should not
have hastened to send a second letter
withdrawing her charge; “instead of
which " she goes casually off on a
honeymoon with his brother, and ap-
parently never gives another thought
to the matter till it is fatally too late.
However, I am not really concerned
at this time of day with the improba-
bilities of so well-established a tragedy,
but only with the most recent interpre-
tation of it. And let me say at once
that, for the best of reasons, I do not
propose to compete with the erudition
of my fellow-critics in the matter of
previous interpreters, for Ibring a virgin
mind to my consideration of the merits
of the present cast.
Fédora is the most exhausting test
to which Miss MARIE LöHR has yet put
her talent. The heroine's emotions are
worked at top-pressure almost through-
out the play. At the very start she is
torn with passionate grief for the death
of her lover and a still more passionate
desire to take vengeance on the man
who killed him. When she learns the
unworthiness of the one and the justifi-
cation of the other those emotions are
instantly exchanged for a passionate
worship of the late object of her ven-
geance, to be followed by bitter remorse
for the harm she has done him and
terror of the consequences when he
comes to know the truth. And so to
suicide.
I will confess that I was astonished
at the power with which Miss LöHR
met these exigent demands upon her
emotional forces. It was indeed a re-
markable performance. My only re-
servation is that in one passage she
was too anxious to convey to the
audience the intensity of her remorse,
when it was a first necessity that she
should conceal it from the other actor
on the stage. It was nice and loyal
of Mr. BASIL RATHBONE to behave as
if he didn't notice anything unusual,
but it must have been as patent to him
as to us.
Of his Loris I cannot say too much
in admiration. At first Mr. RATHBONE
seemed a little stiff in his admirably-
fitting dress-clothes, but in the last
scene he moved through those swift
changes of emotion—from joy to grief,
from rage to pity and the final anguish
and horror—with extraordinary imag-
ination and resource. . .
Of the others, Mr. ALLAN AYNEs-
worth, as Jean de Sirier, played in
a quiet and assured undertone that
served to correct the rather expansive
methods of Miss ELLIs JEFFREYs,
whose humour, always delightful, af-
forded a little more relief than was
perhaps consistent with the author's
designs and her own dignity as a great
lady in the person of the Countess Olga.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I Do not think that even the most phlegmatic of English-
men could read Francis and Riversdale Grenfell: a Memoir
(NELSON) without a quickening of the pulses. This is not
to suggest that Mr. John BUCHAN has sought to make an
emotional appeal—indeed he has told the tale of these
devoted brothers with a simplicity beyond praise—but it is
a tale so fine that it must fill the heart, even of those who
were strangers to them, with joy and pride. I beg you to
read the memoir for yourselves, and see how and why it
was that these twin brothers, from Eton onwards, radiated
cheerfulness and a happy keenness wherever they went.
“Neither,” Mr. BUCHAN writes, “could be angry for long,
and neither was capable of harshness or rancour. Their
endearing grace of manner made a pleasant warmth in any
society which they entered; and since this gentleness was
joined to a perpetual glow of enthusiasm the effect was
triumphant. One's recollection was of something lithe,
alert, eager, like a finely-bred greyhound.” Those of us
who were not personally acquainted with FRANCIs and
RIVERSDALE GRENFELL will, after reading this Memoir and
the Preface by their uncle, Field-Marshal Lord GRENFELL,
seem to know them intimately. FRANCIS won the first
W.C. gained in the War, but when he read the announce-
ment of it in The Gazette his brother was already killed
and his joy of life was quenched. “I feel,” he wrote to his
uncle, “that I know so many who have done and are
doing so much more than I have been able to do for
England. I also feel very strongly that any honour
belongs to my regiment and not to me.” In that spirit he
met his death a few months later. In work and sport, in
war or peace, the twins were ardent, generous and brave,
and their deaths were as glorious as their lives were
gracious and radiant. The profits of Mr. BUCHAN's book
are to be devoted to the funds of the Invalid Children's Aid
Association, in which the brothers were deeply interested.
There are certain tasks which, like virtue, carry their
reward with them. No doubt Miss ELEANour SINCLAIR
RoHDE would be gratified if her book, A Garden of Herbs
(LEE WARNER), were to pass into several editions—as I
trust it will—and receive commendation on every hand—as
it surely must—but such results would be irrelevancies.
She has already, I am convinced, tasted so much delight in
the making of this, the most fragrant book that I ever read,
in her delving and selecting, that nothing else matters.
Not only is the book fragrant from cover to cover, but it is
practical too. It tells us how our ancestors of not so man
generations ago—in Stuart times chiefly—went to the herb
garden as we go to the chemist's and the perfumer's and
the spice-box, and gave that part of the demesne much of
the honour which we reserve for the rock-garden, the herb-
aceous borders and the pergola. And no wonder, when from
the herbs that grow there you can make so many of the
lenitives of life—from elecampane a sovran tonic, and
from purslane an assured appetiser, and from marjoram a
pungent tea, and from wood-sorrel a wholesome water-
gruel, and from gillyflowers “a comfortable cordial to cheer
the heart,” and from thyme an eye-lotion that will “enable
one to see the fairies.” Miss RoHDE tells us all, inter-

mingling her information with mottoes from old writers

she says nothing as to how lovage got its pretty name, we
are told that “lovage should be sown in March in any good

iconoclastic, almost violently individual. Plot, I fancy, sel-
dom troubles Mr. Douglas greatly; it happens, or it does
not. Meanwhile he is far more concerned in fitting a double
meaning (at least) to the most simple-sounding phrase. To
sum up, They Went is perhaps not for idle, certainly not
for unintelligent, reading; for those who can appreciate
quality in a strange guise it will provide a feast of unfamiliar
flavours that may well create an appetite for more.
That clever writer, Mr. A. P. HERBERT, would lightly
describe his story, The House by the River (METHUEN), as
a “shocker." But there are ways and ways of shocking.
He might wish to show us the embarrassments of a fairly
respectable member of the intellectual classes, living in a
highly respectable environment, when he finds that he has
committed homicide; and he might make the details as grue-
some as he liked. But there was no need to shock the
sensitive when he made his choice of the circumstances
in which the poet, Stephen Byrne, inadvertently throttles
MARTYRS of scIENCE –THE INVENTOR OF Top FEE.
his housemaid. It is a
fault, too, that his scheme
only interests him so far
as it concerns Stephen and
his society, and that the
horror of the tragedy from
what one may loosely call
the victim's point of view
does not seem to affect
him at all. Otherwise,
even for the sake of brev-
ity, he could not so flip-
pantly refer to the body,
sewn in a sack and thrown
into the river, as just
“Eliza.” He may argue
that he never thought of
the corpse as a real one
and that the whole thing
was merely an experiment
in imaginative art ; but
his details are too well
realised for that, and so
is his admirable picture
of the society of Ham-
merton Chase, W., a thin
ſº
|
To my mind, amongst the least forgettable books of the
present year will be that to which Mr. SEToN GoRDON, F.Z.S.,
has given the title of The Land of the Hills and the Glens
(CAssell). Mr. GoRDON has already a considerable repu-
tation as a chronicler of the birds and beasts (especially
the less approachable birds) of his native Highlands. The
present volume is chiefly the result of spare-moment
activities during his service as coast-watcher among the
Hebrides. Despite its unpropitious title, I must describe
it without hyperbole as a production of wonder and delight.
Of its forty-eight photographic illustrations not one is short
of amazing. We are become used to fine achievement
in this kind, but I am in-
clined to think Mr. GoRDON | º
goes one better, both in i | ||Pr" | ||
the “atmosphere” of his º | • ?
mountain pictures and in -
his studies of birds at
home upon their nests.
To judge, indeed, by the
unruffled domesticity of
these latter, one would
suppose Mr. GoRDON to
have been regarded less
as the prying ornithologist
than as the trusted family
photographer. I except
the golden eagle, last of
European autocrats,whose
greeting appears always
as a super-imperial scowl.
Chiefly these happyresults
seem to have been due to
a triumph of patient cam-
ouflage, concerning which = <
the author suggests the
interesting theory that
birds do not count beyond
unity, i.e., if two stalkers enter an ambush and one sub-
sequently emerges, the vigilance of the feathered watchers
is immediately relaxed. Should this be true, I can only
hope that Mr. GoRDON will get in another book before the
spread of higher education increases his difficulties.
I should be inclined to call Mr. NorMAN Douglas our
only example of the romantic satirist, though, unless
you have some previous knowledge of his work, I almost
despair of condensing the significance of this into a para-
graph. For one thing the mere exuberance of his imagina-
tion is a rare refreshment in this restricted age. His latest
book, with the stimulating title of They Went (CHAPMAN
AND HALL), is an admirable example of this. Certainly no
one else could have created this exotic city with its painted
palaces and copper-encrusted towers, a vision of sea-mists
and rainbows; or peopled it with so iridescent a company
—the strange princess; the queen, her mother; the senile
king who should have been (but wasn't) her father; Theo-
philus, the Greek artist; the philosophic old Druidess, and
the dwarfs who “chanted squeaky hymns amid sacrifices
of mushrooms and gold-dust.” Perhaps this random quota-
tion may hint at the fantastic nature of the tale; it can
give no idea of the intelligence that directs it, mocking,
disguise for a riverside neighbourhood easy to recognise.
I could never get myself quite to believe that Stephen's
friend, Egerton, accessory after the fact, would so long and
so tamely have borne the suspicion of it; but for the rest
Mr. HERBERT's study of his milieu shows a very intimate
observation. If his Stephen, in whom the highest poetic
talents are found tainted with a touch of coarseness, may not
always be credible, the passion for self-expression which
leads him on to versify his own experience in the form of
a mediaeval idyll, and so give himself away, is true to life.
But my final impression of Mr. HERBERT's book—he will
perhaps think I am taking him too seriously—is that his
many gifts and notably his humour, whose gaiety I prefer to
its grimness, are here exercised on a rather unworthy theme.

Personally we think the Editor was a little too complaisant.

HOW TO WITALISE THE DRAMA.
A hint of what might be dome by follow-

[“More than one actor-manager during the
past few months has been searching round
frantically in his efforts to find a new play.”
The Times.]
Oh, have you marked upon the breeze
The wail of hunger which occurs
When starved theatrical lessees
Commune with hollow managers?
“Where is Dramatic Art?” they say;
“Can no one, no one, write a play?”
I cannot think why this should be, , ,
This bitter plaint of sudden dearth;
To write a play would seem to me,
Almost the easiest thing on earth.
Sometimes I feel that even I
Could do it if I chose to try.
What! can this Art be in its grave
Whose form was lately so rotund,
Whose strength was as a bull's and
gave
No sign of being moribund?
I'm sure my facts are right, or how
Do you account for Chu Chin Chow 2
As for the gods, their judgment shows
No loss of flair for grace or wit;
We see the comic's ruby nose
Reduce to pulp the nightly pit,
Whose patrons, sound in head and

Still love the loftiest type of Art.
Nor should the playwright fail for lack
Of matter, if with curious eyes
He follows in our Pressmen's track,
Who find the source of their supplies
In Life, that ever-flowing font,
And “give the public what they want.”
If authors, moving with the times,
Would only feed us, like the Press,
On squalid “mysteries,” ugly crimes,
Scandals and all that carrion mess,
I see no solid reason why
Dramatic Art should ever die.
O. S.
UNAUTHENTIG IMPRESSIONS.
II.-MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL.
IF it be urged that a few trifling in-
accuracies have crept into the sketch
which is here given of a great states-
man's personality I can only say,
“Humanum est errare,” and “Homo
sum: humani nihil alienum a me puto.”
These two Latin sentences, I find, in-
variably soothe all angry passions; you
have only to try their effect the next
time you stamp on the foot of a stout
man when alighting from an Under-
ground train.
Of all the present-day politicians, and
indeed there are not a few, upon whose
mantelpieces the bust of NAPOLEoN
Bon APARTE is displayed, Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL is probably the most assid-
uous worshipper at the great Corsican's
shrine. How often has he not entered
his sanctum at the War Office, peering
forward with that purposeful dominat-
ing look on his face, and discovered a
few specks of dust upon his favourite
effigy. With a quick characteristic
motion of the thumb resembling a stab
he rings the bell. A flunkey instantly
appears. “Bust that dust,” says the
WAR MINISTER. And then, correcting
himself instantly, with a genial smile,
“I should say, Dust that bust.”
But NAPoleoN's is not the only head
that adorns Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL's
room. On a bookshelf opposite is a
model of his own head, such as one
may sometimes see in the shop windows
of hatters, and close beside is a small
private hat-making plant, together with
an adequate supply of the hair of the
rabbit, the beaver, the vicuna and similar
rodents, and a quantity of shellac. Few
days pass in which the WAR MINISTER
does not spend an hour or two at his
charming hobby, for, contrary to the
general opinion, he is far from satisfied
with the headgear by which he is so
well known, or even with the Sandring-
ham hat of The Daily Mail, and lives
always in hopes of modelling the ideal
hat which is destined to immortalise
him and be worn by others for centuries
to come. The work of a great states-
man lives frequently in the mindful brain
of posterity, less frequently upon it.
Other mementos which adorn this
remarkable room at the War Office are
a porcelain pot containing a preserve
of Blenheim oranges, a framed photo-
graph of the Free Trade Hall at Man-
chester, a map of Mesopotamia with
the outpost lines and sentry groups of
the original Garden of Eden, marked by
paper flags, and a number of lion-skin
rugs of which the original occupants
were stalked and killed by their owner
on his famous African tour. In his
more playful moments the WAR MIN-
IsTER has been known to clothe him-
self completely in one of these skins
and growl ferociously from behind a
palm at an unwelcome intruder.
Of the man himself perhaps the most
distinguishing characteristic is dynamic
energy. Whether other people's energy
is ever dynamic I do not know, but
undoubtedly Mr. WINstoN CHURCHILL's
is; he dominates, he quells. He is like
one of those people in the papers with
zig-zags sticking out all over them
because they have been careful to wear
an electric belt. He exudes force. Some-
times one can almost hear him crackle.
As a politician it is true he has not
yet tried every office; he has not, for
instance, been Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, though his unbounded success
in the Duchy of Lancaster amply shows
what his capabilities as a Chancellor
are. But as a soldier, a pig-sticker and
a polo-player he is rapidly gaining pre-
eminence, and as an author and jour-
nalist his voice is already like a swan's
amongst screech-owls. (I admit that
that last bit ought to have been in Latin,
but I cannot remember what the Latin
for a screech-owl is. I have an idea that
it increases in the genitive, but quite
possibly I may be thinking of dormice.)
Anyhow, to return to Mr. CHURCHILL's
room ; whilst the floor is littered with
volumes that have been sent to him for
review, his desk is equally littered with
proofs of essays, sermons, leaders and
leaderettes for the secular and Sunday
Press. As a novelist he has scarcely
fulfilled his early promise, but it is on
record that he was once introduced to
a stranger from the backwoods, who
asked ignorantly, “Am I speaking to
the statesman or the author 2 ''
“Not or, but and,” replied the SECRE-
TARY OF STATE FOR WAR, with a simple
dignity like that of St. AUGUSTINE.
To poetry he is not greatly attached,
preferring to leave this field of letters
to his staff. When asked for his
favourite passage of English verse he
has indeed been known to cite a single
line from Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc's Modern
Traveller— -
“That marsh, that admirable marsh ' "
which is far from being Mr. BELLoc's
most mellifluous effort.
We feel bound to ask what is most
likely to be the next outlet for Mr.
CHURCHILL's ebullient activity. Re-
membering that bust upon his mantel-
piece it is hard to say. There are some
who consider that, prevented by the
sluggishness of our times from the
chance of commanding an army in the
field, he may turn his strategic mind
at last to the position of Postmaster-
General. If he does there can be no
man better fitted than he to make our
telephones hum. -

SOURCES OF LAUGHTER.
“It will have to be a great deal
funnier than that before it's funny,"
said George.
This represented the general opinion,
though Edna, who has a good heart,
professed to find it diverting already.
Unfortunately she has no sense of
humour. - -
Jerry, the writer, claimed exemption
on the ground of being the writer,
though he did not see why his article
should not remove gravity (as they say
in The Wallet of Kai Lung) from other
people quite as effectually as the silly
tosh of A. and B. and C., naming some
brilliant and successful humorists.
The company then resolved itself into
a Voluntary Aid Detachment.
When they met again at tea Edna
made the suggestion of a sprinkling of
puns.
“We’ve got rather beyond that, I
think,” said the victim with dignity.
“I'm not so sure,” said George
cruelly, “that you can afford to neglect
any means. Some people laugh at them
even now, in this twentieth century,
in this beautiful England of ours.”
“And I can tell you why,” broke in
Raymond eagerly. He took from his
pocket a well-known Manual of Psycho-
logy and whirled over the pages.
“Meanwhile,” said George learnedly,
“BERGsoN may be of some assistance
to you. He knows all about laughter.
He analysed it.”
“Why couldn't he leave it alone?”
said Allegra uneasily.
“He defines laughter,” said George,
“as “a kind of social gesture.'”
“It isn't,” said Allegra rashly. “At
least,” she added, “that sort of thing
isn't going to help Jerry. Do give it
up.”
“Well, then, here's something more
practical,” said George. “Listen. “A
situation is always comical when it
belongs at one and the same time to
two series of absolutely independent
events, and can at the same time be
interpreted in two different ways.'”
“I should think,” said Edna brightly,
“that might be very amusing.”
She remarked later that it made it
all seem very clear, but even she showed
signs of relief when Raymond inter-
rupted, having found his place.
“Here we are!” he exclaimed. “The
book says that the reason a pun
amuses you x -
“It doesn't amuse me,” said most of
the company.
“But it does—it must amuse you.
It's all down here in black and white.
Listen. The reason a pun amuses you
is as follows: “It impels the mind
to identify objects quite disconnected.

Pat. “YE MAY well, say THAT, SoBR.
AN HOUR OF UT NOW WILL DO MORE GOOD
IN FIVE MINUTES THAN A MonTH OF UT would Do IN A WEEK AT ANNY OTHER TIME."
This obstructs the flow of thought;
but this is too transient to give rise to
pain, and the relief which comes with
insight into the true state of the case
may be a source of keen pleasure.
Mental activity suddenly obstructed
and so heightened is at once set free,
and is so much greater than the occa-
sion demands that—'”
“And is that why we laugh at
things?” said Allegra sadly.
The heavy silence which followed
was broken by the voice of Mrs. Purkis,
the charlady, who “comes in to oblige,”
and was now taking a short cut to the
front gate, under Cook's escort, by way
of the parsley bed. This brought her
within earshot of the party, who were
taking tea on the lawn.
When Mrs. Purkis could contain her
mirth so as to make herself understood,
her words were these: “I dunno why,
but when I see 'im stand like that,
staring like a stuck pig, I thought I'd
died a-larf'n. I dunno why, but it
made me larf - ?
She passed, like Pippa.
“Listen to her,” said Allegra in bitter
envy. “She doesn't know why.”
And Allegra burst into tears.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE BLOATER SHOW.
THE last time I was at Olympia—
as everybody says at the door—it was
a Horse Show. But this time it is much
the same. There they stand in their
stalls, the dear, magnificent, patient
creatures, with their glossy coats and
their beautiful curves, their sensitive
radiators sniffing for something over
the velvet ropes. Panting, I know they
are, to be out in the open again; and
yet I fancy they enjoy it all in a way.
It would be ungrateful if they did not;
for, after all, the whole thing has been
arranged for them. The whole idea of
the Show is to let the motors inspect the
bloaters—and not what you think. (You
don't know what bloaters are 2 Well,
I can't explain without being rude.)
All the year round they can study ad
nauseam their own individual bloaters;
but this is the only occasion on which
they have the whole world of bloaters
paraded in front of them for inspection.
Now only can they compare notes and
exchange grievances.
And how closely they study the
parade Here is a pretty limousine, a
blonde; see how she watches the two
huge exhibits in front of her. They
are very new bloaters, and one of them
—oh, horror!—one of them is going to
buy. He has never bought before; she
knows his sort. He will drive her to
death; he may even drive her himself;
he will stroke her lovely coat in a fami-
liar, proprietary fashion; he will show
her off unceasingly to other bloaters till
she is hot all over and the water boils in
her radiator. He will hold forth with
a horrible intimacy and a yet more
horrible ignorance on the most pri-
vate secrets of her inner life. Not one
throb of her young cylinders will be
sacred, yet never will he understand
her as she would like to be understood.
He will mess her with his muddy boots;
he will scratch her paint; he will drop
tobacco-ash all over her cushions—not
from pipes; cigars only. . . .
There—he has bought her.
tragedy. Let us move on.
Here is a little coupé—a smart young
creature with a nice blue coat, fond of
town, I should say, but quite at home
in the country. She also is inspecting
two bloaters. But these two are very
shy. In fact they are not really bloaters
at all; they are rather a pair of nice-
mannered fresh herrings, not long mated.
The male had something to do with that
war, I should think; the coupé would
help him a good deal. The lady likes
her because she is dark-blue. The other
one likes her because of something to
do with her works; but he is very
reverent and tactful about it. He seems
to know that he is being scrutinised,
It is a
for he is nervous, and scarcely dares to
speak about her to the groom in the
top-hat. He will drive her himself; he
will look after her himself; he will
know all about her, all about her moods
and fancies and secret failings; he will
humour and coax her, and she will
serve him very nobly.
Already, you see, they have given her
a name—“Jane,” I think they said;
they will creep off into the country
with her when the summer comes, all
by themselves; they will plunge into
the middle of thick forests and sit down
happily in the shade at midday and
look at her; and she will love them.
But the question is Ah, they
are shaking their heads; they are edging
away. She is too much. They look back
sadly as they go. Another tragedy. . . .
Now I am going to be a bloater my-
self. Here is a jolly one, though her
stable-name is much too long. She is
a Saloon-de-Luxe, and she only costs
£2,125 (why 5, I wonder — why not
6?) I can run to that, surely. At
any rate I can climb up and sit down
on her cushions; none of the grooms is
looking. Dark-blue, I see, like Jane.
That is the sort of car I love. I am
like the lady herring; I don't approve
of all this talk about the insides of
things; it seems to me to be rather
indecent—unless, of course, you do it
very nicely, like that young herring.
When you go and look at a horse you
don't ask how its sweetbread is arranged,
or what is the principle of its liver.
Then why should you : . .?
Well, here we are, and very comfort-
able too. But why does none of these
cars haye any means of communication
between the owner and the man next to
the chauffeur? There is always a tele-
phone to the chauffeur, but none to
the overflow guest on the box. So that
when the host sees an old manor-house
which he thinks the guest hasn't no-
ticed he has to hammer on the glass
and do semaphore; and the guest thinks
he is being asked if he is warm enough.
Otherwise, though, this is a nice car.
It is very cosy in here. Dark and quiet
and warm. I could go to sleep in here.
:k ::: :: :: ::
What? What's that? No, I don't
really want to buy it, thank you. I
just wanted to see if it was a good
sleeping-ear. As a matter of fact I
think it is. But I don't like the colour.
And what I really want is a cabriolet.
Good afternoon. Thank you. . . .
A pleasant gentleman, that. I wish
I could have bought the Saloon. She
would have liked me. So would he, I
expect. -
Well, we had better go home. I
shan't buy any more cars to-day. And
we won't go up to the gallery; there is
nothing but oleo-plugs and graphite-
grease up there. That sort of thing
spoils the romance.
Ah, here is dear Jane again! What
a pity it was Hallo, they have
come back — the two nice herrings.
They are bargaining—they are beating
him down. No, he is beating them up.
Go on—go on. Yes, you can run to
that—of course you can. Sell those oil
shares. Look at her—look at her | You
can't leave her here for one of the
bloaters. He wavers; he consults.
“Such a lovely colour.” Ah, that's

THE PREMIER'S METAPHORS.
SoME time ago the PREMIER beheld
the sunrise upon the mountains, and
now he has plunged his thermometer
into the lava to discover that the stream
is cooling—indicating comfort, let us
hope, to any who may be buried beneath
it. Only by an oversight, we under-
stand, did he omit to mention in his
speech at the Guildhall that the chamois
is once more browsing happily among
the blooming edelweiss.
But in continuing his lofty metaphors
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE will find himself
confronted by no small difficulty when
dealing with the glacier. What can he
say that the glacier is doing? It must
do something. A glacier is of no rhe-
torical value if it merely stays where it
is. One may take in hand the ice-axe
of resolution and the alpenstock of en-
terprise and pull over one's boots the
socks of Coalition, but the glacier re-
mains practically unchanged by these
preparations. It would be of little use
to declare that its uneven surface is
being levelled by the steam-roller of
progress and its crevasses filled in by
the cement of human kindness, because
the Opposition Press would soon get
scientists, engineers and statisticians to
establish the absurdity of such a claim.
And to announce that the glacier is
getting warmer would create no end of
a panic among the homesteads in the
valley. Unless he is very, very careful
Mr. LLOYD GEORGE may make a grave
slip in negotiating the glacier.
Then the “awful avalanche” has not
yet been dealt with. A few helpful
words on the direction this is likely to
take and the safest rock to make for
when it begins to move might be wel-
comed by the PREMIER's followers. He
may argue that it is folly to meet trou-
ble half-way, but on the other hand, if
he does not speak on this subject soon,
the opportunity may disappear. Let
him avoid the glacier if he chooses; he
cannot (so we are informed) escape the
avalanche. *

THE SAYINGS OF BARBARA.
THE man who sets out to expose
popular fallacies or to confound time-
honoured legends is bound to make
enemies.
The latest legend I have been privi-
leged to explore is not the product
of superstition and slow time, but a
deliberately manufactured growth of
comparatively recent origin. It is con-
cerned with Barbara, not the impersonal
lady who figures in the old logic-book
doggerel, but an extremely live and
highly illogical person to whom for
half a decade I have had the honour to
be father. It is also concerned with
Barbara's Aunt Julia and, in a lesser
degree, with Barbara's mother. -

room with Suzanne (who besides being
Julia's sister is Barbara's mother and
my wife) and Barbara (whose relation-
ship all round has been sufficiently
indicated). The drawing-room door was |
open, and so was that of my study on
the opposite side of the passage, where
I was coquetting with a trifle of work.
The conversation, which I could not
help overhearing, was confined for the
most part to Julia and Barbara, and ran
more or less on the following lines:–
Julia. Where's Father, Babs 2
Barbara. In the libery.
Julia. Working hard, I suppose?
Barbara. Yes.
Julia. Or do you think he's sleep-
“You ought to hear what your
daughter has been saying about you,”
said Julia. -
“Oh, and what does Barbara say?"
I asked.
“She says that when Father sits in
that stuffy little room of his he usually
writes in his sleep. She really does
take the most amazing notice of things,
and the way she expresses herself, is
quite weird.”
“So Barbara, says I write in my
sleep?”
“Yes, you heard her, didn't you,
Suzie 2 Oh, and did I tell you that the
other day, during that heavy thunder-
storm, she said that the angels and the

that she supposed the angels would

“Come here,

Barbara, who at her

had been granted the
privilege of taking tea
in the drawing-room,
stuffed the better half of
a jam sandwich into her
mouth and came.
“Do you see those

“The biggest and

“Yes. Now tell me
—don't you think that
people ought always to

be especially careful not
liant flashes of humour or of uncanny
intelligence to issue from Barbara's lips,
and her failure during these periods to
sustain her reputation I was content to
explain on the assumption that I came
within the category of casual visitors.
But I have now lived in my own home
for over a year, and Barbara and I have
become very well acquainted. She talks
to me without restraint, and at times
most engagingly, but seldom, if ever,
does she give utterance in my hearing to
a jeu d'esprit that I feel called upon to
repeat to others. Nevertheless until a
few days ago I was still constantly be-
ing informed—chiefly by Barbara's aunt
and less frequently by her mother—of
the “killing” things that child had been
saying. I grew privately sceptical, but
had no proof, and it was only by acci-
dent that I was at last enabled to prick
the bubble.

aunt is Suzanne's sister) had come to
father's probably asleep half the time

sits in is just a weeny bit too comfy for

Barbara. I've eated up all those

Julia. Perhaps we'll find some more
presently. Do you think Father writes
in his sleep?
Barbara. Yes, I fink he does.
Julia. Listen to her, Suzie. I expect
really he only dreams he's working.
Don't you, Babs?
At this point I thought it advisable,
for the sake of preserving the remnants
of my parental authority, to come in to
tea. Julia was handing Barbara a
packet of chocolate, and greeted me
with an arch inquiry as to whether I
had been busy writing. I replied with
a hearty affirmative.

WHEN the docks are all deserted and the derricks all are still,
And the wind across the anchorage comes singing sad and
shrill,
And the lighted lanthorns gleaming where the ships at
anchor ride
Cast their quivering long reflections down the ripple of the
tide,
Then the ships they start a-yarning, just the same as
sailors do
In a hundred docks and harbours from Port Talbot to Chefoo,
Just the same as deep-sea sailormen a-meeting up and down
In the bars and boarding-houses and the streets of Sailor-
town.
Just the same old sort of ship-talk sailors always like to
hear—
Just the same old harbour gossip gathered in from far and
near,
In the same salt-water lingo sailors use the wide world
round,
From the shores of London river to the wharves of Puget
Sound,
With a gruff and knowing chuckle at a spicy yarn or so,
And a sigh for some old shipmate gone the way that all
men go,
And there's little need to wonder at a grumble now and then,
For the ships must have their growl out, just the same as
sailormen.
N. S.
And they yarn along together just as jolly as you please,
Lordly liner, dingy freighter rusty-red from all the seas,
Of their cargoes and their charters and their harbours East
and West,
And the coal-hulk at her moorings, she is yarning with the
best,
Telling all the same tales over many and many a time she's
In .* that's something creaky now because she's got
Liºn broken sailorman when drink has loosed his
And . *ient heart keeps turning to the days when he
was young.
Is it but the chuckling mutter of the tide along the buoys,
But the creak of straining cables, but the night wind's
mournful noise, -
Sighing with a rising murmur in among the ropes and spars,
Setting every shroud and backstay singing shanties to the
stars?
No, the ships they all are yarning, just the same as sailors do,
Just the same as deep-sea sailors from Port Talbot to Chefoo,
Yarning through the hours of darkness till the daylight
comes again,
"But oh! the things they speak of no one knows but sailor-

during the War.” “Were you there?”
smartly interjected General CROFT.
The Government of Ireland Bill hav-
ing been recommitted, Sir Worthing-
ToN Evans explained the Government's
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 8th-To allay
the apprehensions of Sir John REEs
the PRIME MINISTER informed him that
the League of Nations can do nothing
except by a unanimous de-
cision of the Council. As the
League already includes thirty-
seven nations, it is not ex-
pected that its decisions will
be hastily reached. Now, per-
haps, the United States may
think better of its refusal to
join a body which has secured
the allegiance of Liberia and of
all the American Republics
save Mexico.
The daily demand for an
impartial inquiry into Irish
“reprisals” met with its daily
refusal. The PRIME MINISTER
referred to “unfortunate inci-
dents that always happen in
war.”—the first time that he
has used this word to describe
the situation in Ireland—and
was confident that the sufferers
were, with few exceptions (Mr.
DEVLIN, who complained that
his office had been raided, being
one of them), “men engaged in a mur-
derousconspiracy." He declined to ham-
per the authorities who were putting
it down. Taking his cue from his chief,
Sir HAMAR GREENwood excused his lack
of information about recent occurrences

expedient for providing the new Irish
Parliaments with Second Chambers.
Frankly admitting that the Cabinet had
been unable to evolve a workable scheme
—an elected Senate would fail to pro-
tect the minority and a nominated
Senate would be “undemocratic"—he
proposed that the Council of Ireland
should be entrusted with the task.
Having regard to the probable com-
position of the Council — half Sinn
Feiners and half Orangemen—Colonel
GUINNEss feared there was no chance
of its agreeing unless most of them
were laid up with broken heads or some
other malady. Sir Edward CARson,
however, in an unusually optimistic
vein, expressed the hope that once
the North was assured of not being
put under the South and the South was
relieved of British dictation they would
“shake hands for the good of Ireland.”
The clause was carried by 175 to 31.
On another new clause, providing for
the administration of Southern Ireland
in the event of a Parliament not being
set up, Mr. Asquith declared that “this
musty remainder biscuit” had reduced
him to “rhetorical poverty.” Perhaps
that was why he could get no more
than ten Members to follow him into
the Lobby against it.
Tuesday, November 9th.-In sup-
porting Lord PARMooR's protest against
the arrest, at Holyhead, of an English
lady by order of the Irish Executive,
Lord BUCKMASTER regretted that there
was no one in the House of Lords re-
sponsible for the Irish Office, and con-
sequently “they were always compelled
to accept official answers.” A strictly
official answer was all he got from
Lord CRAwFoRD, who declared that the
arrest had been made under the autho-
rity of D.O.R.A., and gave
their Lordships the surely oti-
ose reminder that “conditions
were not quite simple or nor-
mal in Ireland just now.”
Mr. SHORTT has formed his
style on the model of one of
his predecessors in office, who
used to be described as the
Quite-at-Home Secretary, and
he declined to share Colonel
BURN's alarm at the preva-
lence of revolutionary speeches.
Hyde Park, he reminded him,
had always been regarded as a
safety-valve for discontented
people. Even Mr. L'EstraNGE
MALONE's recent reference to
Ministers and lamp-posts did
not at that moment disturb
him.
The new Ministry of Health
Bill had a rather rough pass-
age, and, if the voting had
been in accordance with the
speeches, it would hardly have secured
a second reading. Particular objection
was raised to the proposal to put the
hospitals on the rates. Mr. MYERs,
however, was sarcastic at the expense
of people who thought that “rates and

would encourage the Socialistic fallacy
that the people of England were
divided into two classes—the leisured
class and the working class; whereas
everybody knew that most of the
“leisured class" had no leisure and
many of the “working-class” did no
work.
Wednesday, November 10th. — The
Peers welcomed Lord BUxton on his
advancement to an earldom, and then
proceeded to discuss the rights of the
inhabitants of Heligoland. Having
been handed over to Germany against
their will in 1890, they hoped that the
Treaty of Versailles would restore
them to British nationality. On the
contrary the Treaty has resulted in
the island being swamped by Ger-
man workmen employed in destroying
suspension of Mr. FISHER's new Act,
was informed that the PRIME MINISTER
could conceivenothing more serious than
that the nation should decide that it
could not afford to give children a good
education.
Any doubts as to the suitability of
Armistice Day for the Third Reading of
the Government of Ireland Bill were
removed by the tone of the debate.
The possibility that the “Unknown
Warrior” might have been an Irishman
softened the feeling on both sides,
and though Mr. ADAMSON feared that
the Bill would bring Ireland not peace
but a sword, and Mr. Asquith appealed
to the Government to substitute a
measure more generous to Irish aspir-
ations, there was no sting in either of
THE GREAT IDEA.
Perkins has got hold of a brilliant
idea. He explained it to me in the
Tube yesterday.
“Our little world,” he said, “is turned
topsy-turvy.”
“Knocked absolutely sideways,” I
replied.
“Those who were rich in the old
days,” said Perkins, “haven't two six-
pences to rub together, and the world's
workers are rolling in Royces and
having iced méringues with every meal.
What follows 2 ”
“Indigestion,” I said promptly.
“Everybody,” he said, ignoring my
jeu d'esprit, “feels like a fish out of
water, and discontent is rife. The newly-
poor man wishes he had in him the stuff
the fortifications. Lord
CRAw For D considered
that the new electoral
law requiring three years'
residence would safe-
guard the islanders from
being politically sub-
merged, and wisely did
not enter into the ques-
tion of how long the is-

after the fortifications
had disappeared.

were very dangerous things, “whether

Mr. STEwART expressed anxiety lest
under the new arrangements with
Egypt the Sudan water-supply should
be subjected to Egyptian interference.
Mr. HARMsworth was of opinion that
for geographical reasons the Sudan
would always be able to look after its
own water-supply; vide the leading
case of Wolf v. Lamb.
Thursday, November 11th. — The
PRIME MINISTER was in a more aggres-
sive mood than usual. Mr. DEVLIN,
who was noisily incredulous as to the
existence of a Sinn Fein conspiracy
with Germany in 1918, was advised to
wait for the documents about to be pub-
lished. To make things even, an ultra-
Conservative Member, who urged the
while defending his scheme as the best
that could be granted in the present
temper of Southern Ireland, did not
bang the door against further negotia-
tions; and Sir Edward CARson said
that Ulstermen were beginning to re-
alize that the Parliament thrust upon
them might be a blessing in disguise,
and expressed the hope that in working
it they would set an example of toler-
ance and justice to all classes. Barely
a third of the House took part in the
division, and no Irish Member voted for
the Third Reading, which was carried by
183 votes to 52; but, having regard to
the influence of the unexpected in Irish
affairs, this apparent apathy may be a
good sign. After thirty-five years of
acute strife, Hiome Rule for Ireland is,
at any rate, no longer a party question.

through the auricles and ventricles of
his palpitating heart, since transfusion
is such a simple stunt nowadays?”
“And I suppose,” I said, “that you
would bleed him first so as to make
room for the new blood 2"
“There you touch the real beauty
of my idea,” said Perkins. “The ple-
beian sighs for aristocratic blood to
enable him to hold his own in his novel
surroundings; the aristocrat could do
with a little bright red fluid to help him
to turn an honest penny. So it is merely
a case of cross-transfusion; no waste,
no suffering, no weakness from loss of
blood on either side.”
I gasped at the magnitude of the idea.
“I’m drawing up plans,” Perkins
continued, “for a journal devoted to the
matter, in which the interested parties
can advertise their blood-stock for dis-
posal, a sort of “Blood Exchange and
Mart.' The advertisements alone would
pay, I expect, for the cost of production.

A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND.
I.
Percy is a partridge bold
Who in Autumn, so I'm told,
Dwells among the turnip roots
And assists at frequent shoots,
Really I have seldom heard
Of a more precocious bird;
Possibly his landlord's not
What you'd call a first-rate shot,
And his pals, though jolly chaps,
Are not quite so good perhaps;
Still, he thinks their aim so trash
That, I fear, he's getting rash. #.
Even perches on the end
Of the gun my poor old friend
Bill employs for killing game.
True he 's very blind and lame,
And he's well beyond the span
Meted out to mortal man,
And his gout is getting worse
Meaning Bill, of course, not Perce);
till, if he won't mend his ways,
One of these fine Autumn days
I'm afraid there's bound to be
Quite an awful tragedy.
He 'll be shot—I’m sure he will
(Meaning Percy now, not Bill).
II.
Weep, ye lowering rain-swept skies!
In the dust our hero lies.
Weeping-willow, bow thy head!
Our precocious fowl is dead.
Sigh, thou bitter North Wind, for
Perce the Partridge is no more

Just to sit, sedate and steady,

Potman. “WELL, IT was A BoB, BUT THEY MostLY sneakED ouT THROUGH THAT

On the barrel of the gun
Little mischief could be done;
But on that sad morn a whim
Suddenly seized hold of him;
'Twas the lunatic desire
To observe how shot-guns fire;
So he boldly took his stand *
Where the barrel ended, and,
All agog to solve the puzzle, .
Poked his napper up the muzzle.
Well, the weapon at the minute
Chanced to have a cartridge in it,
And it happened that my friend
Bill was at the other end,
Who with calm unflurried aim
Failed (at last) to miss the game.
With the tragic tale of Percy's
Death I meant to close these verses,
But we see quite clearly there, too,
Other ills that Bird is heir to.
He has also lost, you see,
Individuality;
Perce the Partridge, named and
known,
With an ego all his own,
Disappears; and in his place
There remains but “half-a-brace.”

THE CYNOSURE.
AMoNG the passengers on the boat
was a tall dark man with a black mous-
tache and well-cut elothes who spent
most of his time walking the deck or
reading alone in his chair. Every ship
has such recluses, who often, however,
are on the fringe of several sets, although
members of none. But this man re-
mained apart and, being so determined
and solitary, he was naturally the sub-
ject of comment and inquiry, even more
of conjecture. His name was easy to
diseover from the plan of the table, but
we knew no more until little Mrs. King,
who is the best scout in the world,
Lrought the tidings.
“I can't tell you much,” she began
breathlessly; “but there's something
frightfully interesting. Colonel Swift
knows all about him. He met him
once in Poona and they have mutual
friends. And how do you think he de-
scribed him 2 He says he's the worst
liver in India.”
There is no need to describe the sen-
sation created by this piece of informa-
tion. If the man had set us guess-
ing before, he now excited a frenzy of
curiosity. The glad news traversed the
ship like wind, brightening every eye;
at any rate every female eye. For,
though the good may have their reward
elsewhere, it is beyond doubt that, if
public interest is any guerdon, the bad
get it on earth.
Show me a really bad man—dark-
complexioned, with well-cut clothes and
a black moustache—and I will show
you a hero; a hero a little distorted, it is
true, but not much the less heroic for
that. Show me a notorious breaker of
male hearts and laws and—so long as
she is still in business—I will show you
a heroine; again a little distorted, but
with more than the magnetism of the
virtuous variety.
For the rest of the voyage the lonely
passenger was lonely only because he pre-
ferred to be, or was unaware of the agi-
tation which he caused. People walked
for hours longer than they liked or even
intended in order to have a chance of
passing him in his chair and scrutinis-
ing again the features that masked such
depravity. For that they masked it
cannot be denied. . A physiognomist
looking at him would have conceded a
certain gloom, a trend towards intro-
spection, possibly a hypertrophied love
of self, but no more. Physiognomists,
however, can retire from the case, for
they are as often wrong as hand-writ-
ing experts. And if any Lavater had
been on board and had advanced such
a theory he would have been as un-
popular as JonAH, for the man's wicked-
ness was not only a joy to us but a sup-

port. Without it the voyage would
have been-interminable.
What, we all wondered, had he done?
Had he murdered as well as destroyed so
many happy homes? Was he crooked
at cards 2 Our minds became acutely
active, but we could discover no more
because the old Colonel, the source of
knowledge, had fallen ill and was in-
visible. -
Meanwhile the screw revolved, sweep-
stakes were lost and won, deck sports
flourished, fancy-dress dances were held,
concerts were endured, a Colonial Bishop
addressed us on Sunday mornings and
the tall dark man with the black mous-
tache and different suits of well-cut
clothes sat in his chair and passed
serenely from one OPPENHEIM to an-
other as though no living person were
within leagues.
It was not until we were actually in
port that the Colonel recovered and I
came into touch with him. Standing
by the rail we took advantage of the
liberty to speak together, which on a
ship such propinquity sanctions. After
we had exchanged a few remarks about
the clumsiness of the disembarking
arrangements I referred to the man of
mystery and turpitude, and asked for
particulars of some of his milder
offences.
“Why do you suppose him such a
blackguard 2" he asked.
“But surely " I began, a little
disconcerted.
“He’s a man,” the Colonel con-
tinued, “that everyone should be sorry
for. He 's a wreck, and he's going home
now probably to receive his death sen-
tence.”
This was a promising phrase and I
cheered up a little, but only for a moment.
“That poor devil,” said the Colonel,
“as I told Mrs. King earlier in the voy-
age, has the worst liver in India.”

A WACILLATING POLICY.
(A Warning against dealing with Disreputable Companies.)
WHEN the Man of Insurance made his rounds
I “covered "my house for a thousand pounds;
Then someone started a fire in the grounds
At the end of a wild carouse.
The building was burnt; I made my claim
And the Man of Insurance duly came.
Said he, “Always
Our Company pays
Without any fuss or grouse;
But your home was rotted from drains to flues;
I therefore offer you as your dues
Seven hundred pounds or, if you choose,
A better and brighter house.”
I took the money; I need not say
What abuse I hurled at his head that day;
But, when he began in his artful way
To talk of Insurance (Life),
And asked me to take out a policy for
My conjugal partner, my cordium cor,
“No, no,” said I,
“If my spouse should die

THE HAPPY GARDENER.
(Ertracts from a Synthetic Diary d la mode.)
November 11th-Now is the time to plant salsify, or the
vegetable oyster, as it has been aptly named from its crus-
tacean flavour so dear to herbaceous boarders. This may
be still further accentuated by planting it in soil containing
lime, chalk or other calcareous or sebaceous deposits.
Hedgehogs are now in prime condition for baking, but it
is desirable to remove the quills before entrusting the animal
to the oven. But the hedgehog cannot be cooked until he
is caught, and his capture should not be attempted without
strong gloves. Those recently invented by Lord THANET
are far the best for the purpose. It is a moot point among
culinary artists whether the hedgehog should be served en
casserole or in coquilles; but these are negligible details
when you are steeped in the glamour of pale gold from a
warm November sun, and mild air currents lag over the level
leagues where the water is but slightly crimped and the
ºng heron is lost among the neutral tints that envelop
II]. . . .
Though the sun's rays are not now so fervent as they
were in the dog-days, gardening without any headgear is
dangerous, especially in view of the constant stooping. For
the protection of the medulla nothing is better than the
admirable hat recently placed on the market by the benevo-
lent enterprise of a great newspaper. But an effective
substitute can be improvised out of a square yard of linoleum
lined with cabbage-leaves and fastened with a couple of
safety-pins.
As the late Sir ANDREw CLARK remarked in a luminous
phrase, Nature forgives but she never forgets. The com-
plete gardener should always aim (unlike the successful
journalist) at keeping his head cool and his feet warm; and
here again the noble enterprise of a newspaper has provided
the exact desideratum in its happily-named Corkolio de-
tachable soles, which are absolutely invaluable when roads
are dark and ways are foul, when the reeds are sere, when
all the flowers have gone and the carrion-crow from the
vantage of a pollard utters harsh notes of warning to all the
corvine company round about . . . .
Shod with Corkolio the happy gardener can defy these
sinister visitants and ply the task of “heeling over” broccoli
towards the north with perfect impunity.
The ravages of stag-beetles, a notable feature of late
seasons, and probably one of the indirect but none the less
disastrous results of the Land Valuation policy of the PRIME
MINISTER, can be kept down by leaving bowls of caviare
mixed with molasses in the places which they most frequent.
This compound reduces them speedily to a comatose condi-
tion, in which they can be safely exterminated with the
aid of the patent hot-air pistolette (price five guineas) re-
cently invented by a director of one of the journals already
alluded to.
But tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe; and while the king-
fisher turns his sapphire back in the sun against the lemon-
yellow of the willow leaves, and the smouldering russet of
the oak-crowns succeeds to the crimson of the beeches and
the gold of the elms, we shall do well to emulate the serene
magnanimity of Nature and console ourselves with the re-
flection that the rural philosopher, if only assured of a sym-
pathetic hearing in an enlightened Press and provided with
a suitable equipment by the ingenuity of its directors, may
contemplate the vagaries of tyrannical misgovernment with
fortitude and even felicity.
A SARTORIAL TRAGEDY.
[“To be fashionable one must have the waist so narrow that there
is a strain upon the second button when the jacket is fastened."

GARBED in the very height and pink of fashion,
To-day I sallied forth to greet my fair,
Nursing within my ardent heart a passion
I long had had a craving to declare;
Being convinced that never would there fall so
Goodly a chance again, I mused how she
Was good and kind and beautiful, and also
- Expecting me to tea.
And after tea I stood before her, feeling
Now was the moment when the maid would melt,
My buttoned jacket helpfully revealing
The graces of a figure trimly svelte,
But, all unworthy to adorn a poet
Who'd bought it for a fabulous amount,
Just as I knelt to put the question, lo, it
Popped on its own account.
The button, dodging my attempts to hide it,
Rolled to her very feet and rested there,
And when I laid my loving heart beside it
She only smiled at that incongruous pair—
Smiled, then in contrite pity for the gloomy
Air that I wore of one whose chance is gone,
Promised that she would be a sister to me
And sew the button on.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN looking at the title-page of John Seneschal's Margaret
(HopDER AND STOUGHTON) no lover of good stories but will
be saddened by the reflection that the superscription, “by
AGNEs and EGERTON CASTLE,” is there seen for the last
time. The double signature, herald of how much pleasure
in the past, is here attached to a cheerfully improbable but
well-told tale of the after-war about a returned soldier who
was mistaken for his dead fellow-prisoner and hailed as son,
heir and fiancé by the different members of the welcoming
group in the home that wasn't his. The descriptions of
this home, by the way—a house whose identification will
be easy enough for those who know the beautiful North-
Dorset country—are as good as any part of the book. If you
protest that the resulting situation is not only wildly im-
probable but becoming a stock-in-trade of our novelists, I
must admit the first charge, but point out that the authors
here secure originality by making the deception an unin-
tended one. John Tempest, who in the hardships of his
escape has lost memory of his own identity, never ceases
to protest that he is at least not the other John for whom
the members of the Seneschal family persist in taking him
—a twist that makes for piquancy if hardly for added prob-
ability. However, the inevitable solution of the problem
provides a story entertaining enough, though not, I think,
one that will obliterate your memory of others, incomparable,
from hands to which we all owe a debt of long enjoyment.

I read Inisheeny (METHUEN), as I believe I have read
every story by the same hand, at one sitting. Whose was
the hand I will ask you to guess. Characters: one Church
of Ireland parson, drily humorous, as narrator; one lively
heroine with archaeological father, hunting for relics; one
schoolboy; one young and over-zealous R.I.C. officer on the
look-out for concealed arms; poachers, innkeepers, peasants,
etc. Action, mostly amphibious, passes between the main-
land of Western Ireland and a small islet off the coast.
Will the gentleman who said “GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM "
kindly consider himself entitled to ten nuts? I suppose it
was the mention of an islet that finally gave away my simple
secret. Mr. “BIRMINGHAM '' is one of the too few authors
who understand what emotion an island of the proper size
and right distance from the coast can raise in the human
breast. Inisheeny delightfully fulfilled every condition in
this respect; not to mention sheltering an illicit still and
being the home of Keltic treasure. Precisely in fact the
right kind of place, and the sort of story that hardly any-
one can put down unfinished. I am bound to add that,
perhaps a hundred pages from the actual end, the humour
of the affair seems to lose spontaneity and become forced.
But till the real climax of the tale, the triumphant re-
turn of the various hunters from Inisheeny, I can promise
that you will find never a dull page.

robust, sane, straightforward persons. You felt homesick.”
Cornwall is notoriously inhabited by queer people, and the
Pendragon family was not merely queer but hereditarily
rotten and decadent: the old father, who burns a valuable
old book of his own to appease his violent temper; the
granddaughter a kleptomaniac; the son of forty addicted to
hideous cruelties. Unpleasant but well drawn, all of them.
Mrs. C. A. DAwson Scott has powerfully suggested the
atmosphere of the strange and tragic household, mourning
its dead mistress; and she understands the peculiar quality
of the Cornish º: and the Cornish seas. I have not read
her other novels, but, if she will promise to wrestle with
one or two rather irritating mannerisms, I will promise to
look out for her next one. I have no prejudice against the

DRINKwater's romantic morality play can profitably take
up Mr. IRVING BACHELLER's A Man for the Ages (CoNSTABLE)

Democrat. They will forgive a certain flamboyance about
the author's preliminaries. Hero-worship, if the hero be
worthy, is a very pardonable weakness, and they should
certainly admire the skill and humour with which he has
patched together, or invented where seemly, the story of
lanky ABE, with his axeman's skill, his immense physical
strength, his poor head for shopkeeping, his passion for
books, his lean purse and “shrinking pants,” his wit, courage
and resource. A romance of reasonable interest and plausi-
bility is woven round young LINcolN's story. Perhaps
Mr. BACHELLER makes his hero speak a little too senten-
tiously at times, and certainly some of his other folk say
queer things, such as, “What so vile as a cheap aristocracy,
growing up in idleness, too noble to be restrained, with
every brutal passion broad-blown as flush as May?” What

and interesting one.
To few of those who

its incomparable moun-

curred that, once a man

prison as damnable as
any other; possibly even
more damnable by rea-

table mountains. Brit-
ish prisoners of war in-

subtle penetration for
those other prisoners,
interned victims of the

W. RILEY should have chosen it.
Certainly in his story there is an old lady who spends
more of the winter on a lawn than any old lady of my
acquaintance could be induced to, even with rugs and a
summer-house to make up for the comforts of the fireside;
but Miss Barbara and her site really have not so much to
do with the tale as its title seems to imply. The love affairs
of a young officer who, while blind from wounds, fell in love
with his nurse to the extent of becoming engaged to her
and didn't recognise her when they met again, are Mr.
RILEY's real concern. Eric, who is quite as priggish as his
name suggests, falls in love with his sweetheart, as a lady
of leisure, all over again, and goes through agonies of re-
morse on account of his own faithlessness to her as a nurse.
Marion or Constance, for she uses two names to help the
confusion, lets him suffer a while for the good of his soul,
but the happy ending, the promise of which is breathed
from every line of the book, is duly brought about. His
publisher asserts that “there is no living author who writes
about Yorkshire as does Mr. RILEY.” I daresay he is quite
right, but at least as far as the present book is concerned I
don't think that I should have bothered to mention it.

Those—and I suspect they are many—whose first real
necessity he writes sadly; but yet he writes as a very
genial philosopher, permitting himself candidly “just that
little cynicism which helps to keep one tolerant.” He is
of the old and entertaining school of sentimental travellers,
but he is far from being old-fashioned. The story running
through his observations and modern instances is so frail and
delicate a thing that I hesitate to touch it and to risk dis-
turbing its bloom. All readers, save the very young and
the very old, will do well to travel with him, from Charin
Cross (“I have a childlike fondness for trains. I like to be
in them, I like to see them go by ") to the peaceful, almost
happy end, at the mountain refuge by the valley of the
Rhone. They will not regret an inch of the way; and they
will derive some very positive enjoyment from the picture
of that most melancholy hotel where the story is set.

BELLES OF THE BALL.
A FootBALL eleven composed of work-
girls from a Lancashire factory recently
journeyed to Paris to play a team of
French female footballers. With wo-
men forcing an entry into the ranks of
minor professions, such as the Law and
Politics, it is doubtful if even the sacred
precincts of professional football can
now be considered safe, and Mr. Punch
wonders if he may soon find himself
reading in the Sporting Columns of the
Press paragraphs something in the
nature of the following:—
Kitty Golightly, who has the repu-
tation of being one of the fastest young
women seen in London this season, has
now definitely thrown in her lot with
the Tottenham Hotstuff. Her forward
work is likely to cause something in
the nature of a sensation.

The dropping of Hilda Smith from
the League team of Newcastle United
has been much criticised by football
enthusiasts throughout the country.
We are, however, in a position to state
that there has been trouble between
Hilda Smith and the Newcastle Direc-
tors for some time past. It appears that
Newcastle's brilliant full-back objected
to wearing the Newcastle jersey, on the
plea that its sombre colour-scheme did
not suit her complexion. She pointed
out that Fanny Robinson, the New-
castle goal-keeper, wore an all-red jersey
and that, as the shade chosen was
most becoming to anyone with dark
hair, she (Hilda Smith) claimed the right
to wear red also. The Newcastle
Directors replied that under the laws
of the Football Association the goal-
keeper is required to wear distinctive
colours from the rest of the team.
That being so, Hilda Smith would only
consent to turn out in future on con-
dition that she should play in goal, and
as the club management would not
agree to displacing Fanny Robinson
the only thing to be done was to leave
Hilda Smith out of the side entirely.

What would have been a very seri-
ous misfortune to the team chosen to
represent England in the forthcoming
International against Wales has only
just been averted. But for the common-
sense and good feeling of all concerned,
Dolly Brown, the English captain,
might have found herself assisting the
Welsh side instead of her own country's
eleven. Not long ago this brilliant back
became engaged to a Welsh gentleman
from Llanfairfechan and the wedding
had been fixed for Thursday next.
Under the present state of the British
Constitution a married woman takes on
the nationality of her husband, and had
the marriage been solemnized before
the International Match on Saturday
Dolly Brown would have been ineligible
for England and available for Wales.
On this being pointed out to her she
at once consented to postpone her mar-
riage, like the patriotic sportswoman
she is, and in the meantime legislation
is to be rushed through both Houses of
Parliament to alter the absurd state of
the law and retain for England the
services of one of the finest backs that
ever fouled a forward.

The regrettable incident at Stamford
Bridge on Saturday last, when Gertie
Swift was sent off the field by the

example of the misguided policy of the
League management. Gertie Swift was
strongly reprimanded by Mr. G. H.
Whistler, the official in charge of the
match, for an alleged offence. Gertie
Swift retorted. Mr. Whistler warned
her. Gertie again retorted. Mr. Whistler
then ordered Gertie to retire from the
game. Whilst we quite agree that a
referee must exercise a strong control
it is perfectly obvious that no self-
respecting woman player is going to
allow any mere man to have the last
word; and the sooner the Football Asso-
ciation realise this and dispense with
the services of all male referees the
better for the good of the game.

UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.
III.-SIR ERIC GEDDEs.
Which is boyhood's commonest am-
bition, to run away to sea or to be some-
thing on a railway line? And how
few, when they are grown up, find that
they have realised either of these de-
sires! The present Minister of Trans-
port has freely confessed to his inti-
mates that more than once, when he
was floating paper-boats in his bath or
climbing a tree in the garden to look
out for icebergs from the crow's-nest,
he felt in his child's heart that water
was the ultimate quest, the adventure,
the gleam. And yet for many a long
year railways entranced and enslaved
him. Often he would sit for hours, for-
getful of the griddle cakes rapidly being
burnt to a cinder, and gaze at the puffs
of steam coming from the spout of the
kettle or the quick vibrations of its lid,
planning in his mind some greater and
better engine that should be known
perhaps as The Snorting Eric, and be
enshrined in glass on Darlington plat-
form.
Once, when he had bought a small
model stationary engine and the methy-
| lated spirit lamp had by some accident

set fire to the carpet, he was found after
the conflagration had subsided stand-
ing serenely amongst the wreckage.
When challenged as to its cause, “I
cannot tell a lie,” he replied calmly;
“I did it with my little gadget.” A
few months later he and the present
Ambassador of Great Britain at Wash-
ington had &onstructed a double line
of miniature tracks, which connected
all the rooms on the ground floor of
the house and considerably interfered
with the parlourmaid's duties. It was
known to the family as the Great
Auckland Railway. Another favourite
hobby of the young engineer was to
lie on his back and watch the spider
spin her web, comparing the results
with a railway map of Great Britain.
It was seldom that he went to bed
without having learnt at least a page
of Bradshaw by heart.
Going from strength to strength this
apparently dreamy lad had climbed the
giddy rungs of fame until, at the out-
break of war, he stood with the ball at
his feet and the title of Deputy General
Manager of the N.E.R. It was he who
had invented the system whereby the
handle of the heating apparatus in rail-
way carriages could be turned either to
off or on without any consequent in-
filtration of steam, thereby saving
passengers from the peril of death by
suffocation. It was he who, thumping
the table with an iron fist, had insisted
vehemently that caged parrots tra-
velling in the rack should, if capable
of speech, be compelled to pay the full
fare. It was he who effected one of
the greatest economies that the line had
ever known by using rock-cakes which
had served their term of years in the
refreshment-room as a substitute for
the keys which hold the metals of the
permanent way in their chairs.
In the summer of 1914 he was about
to adopt a patent device for connecting
the official notices in compartments
with gramophones concealed under the
seats in such a way that when humour-
ists had by dint of much labour made
the customary emendations, such as “It
IS DANGEROUS TO LEAP OUT OF THE
wiNDows,” “To STOP THE RAIN PULL
Down THE CHAIN" and “To EAT FIVE
PERSONs on LY," a loud and merry peal
of laughter should suddenly hail the
completed masterpiece.
Armageddon supervened, and the rest
of Sir ERIC GEDDEs' career is history.
When a new and sure hand was needed

at the Admiralty, Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
was not long in making the only suit-
able choice. Sir ERIC GEDDEs' bluff
hearty manner, positively smacking,
despite his inland training, of all that
a viking ought to smack of, had long
marked him out as the ideal ruler of
the King's Navy, and his name was
soon known and feared wherever the
seagull dips its wing. Underneath the
breezy exterior lay an iron will, like a
precipitate in a tonic for neurasthenia,
and scarcely had he boarded the famous
building in Whitehall and mounted his
quarter-deck (Naval terms are always
used at the Admiralty, the windows
being called “port-holes” and the stair-
cases the “companion") than victory
began to crown the arms of the Senior
Service.
But peace no less than war finds an
outlet for the energies of the old sea-
dog, and the veriest hint of a railway
strike finds him ready with flotillas of
motor lorries in commission and him-
self in his flag char-à-banc, aptly named
the Queen of Eryx, at their head.
Lever, marlin-spike or steering wheel,
it is all one to the brain which can co-
ordinate squadrons as easily as rolling-
stock, to the man who is now some-
times known as the Stormy Petrol of
the Cabinet. Yet even so the sailor is
strongest in him still. It is not
generally known that Sir ERIC has
already cocked his weather eye at our
inland waterways as an auxiliary line
of defence in case of need. Experience
has taught him that it is even now
quicker to travel, let us say, from
Boston (Lincs.) to Wolverhampton, by
river and canal than by rail, and the
future may yet see Thames, Trent and
Severn churned to foam by motor
barges of incredible rapidity, distribut-
ing the nation's food supplies.
This is one of the things that the
Ministry of Transport has, so to say,
up its sleeve, and is alone a sufficient
answer to those who suggest that this
Ministry has outlived its hour. There
is a grim Norse spirit amongst its
officials, inspired perhaps by their chief-
tain's name, and already the plans for
a first-class Pullman galley are under
way. As LoNGFELLow sings:—
“Never saw the wild North Sea
Such a gallant company
Sail its billows blue;
Never, while they cruised and quarrelled,
Old King Gorm or Blue Tooth Harold,
Owned a ship so well apparelled,
Boasted such a crew.”
“Mr. P. G. H. Fender, the Surrey cricket
captain who has gone out with the M.C.C.
team to Australia, is preparing a book on the
tour, for which he has chosen the title of
* Defending the Ashes.’”—Weekly Paper.
Quite the proper function for a FENDER.

ONCE in a fold of the hill I caught
them—
All by my lone was I–
Out on the downs one night in Autumn,
Under a moonlit sky.
There on a smooth little green rectangle
Sparkled the lines of dew;
Over the court with their wings
a-spangle -
Four little fairies flew ;
Skeleton leaves in their hands for
racquets
(All in a ring around
Brownies and elves in their bright
green jackets
Watched from the rising ground).
Then, as I crept up close for clearer
Sight of the Fairy Queen,
Oberon, throned on a toadstool near her,
Carolled out “Love fifteen.”
Over a net of the fairies' knitting
(Fine-spun gossamer thread)
Smallest of tiny puff-balls flitting
Hither and thither sped.
So for a minute I watched them, shrink.

Low in the gorse-bush shade;
Then, like a mortal fool unthinking,
Shouted aloud, “Well played 1"
Right in the midst of an elfin rally
Sudden I stood alone;
Far away over the distant valley
Fairies and elves had flown.

THE SNIPER.
Brackley is a good fellow, but I loathe him.
How would you like it if you were tied to work and
every now and then a man came up to you in your club
and said, “Old man, do come away with me to the Pyrenees
and shoot jummel,” or “Can't you spare a month, old
fellow, to come stalking ibex in Montenegro with me?”
or “Look here, you're just the chap I want to run over
to Alaska with me for a pot at the grizzlies”?
Just a fortnight ago Brackley came and told me of a
delightful rough shooting he had rented in an obscure
corner of Ireland. According to him it was a congested
snipe area. You could not see the pools for wild-duck. The
honking of wild-geese kept one awake at night. The
drawback to the estate was that you were always tripping
over hares.
“You won't be safe there,” I said to Brackley.
“I’m safe anywhere,” said Brackley. “Work it on
system. In Arabia send the mullah a bottle of brandy.
On the Continent stand the local mayor a bottle of wine.
In Ireland ask the priest up to drink whiskey with you in
the evening. So long as the authorities have their thirst
relieved there's never trouble. Now just come for a fort-
night. There'll be crowds of snipe. I'm told there are
woodcock too.”
I was adamant. -
“Well,” sighed Brackley, “I’ll send you a card to say
how I get on.”
When his postcard arrived it ran —
“To-day—
Ten brace snipe.
One brace partridge.
Nine hares.
“What hol”
Isn't that an aggravating card to get when you are deep
in the most elusive and trying chase of all—the money
hunt 2 -
I wrote Brackley a scornful postcard —
“Go on with your baleful schemes. Wallow in slaughter.
Roll in blood. Devastate the district. As an honest
hard-working Englishman I regard you with utter con-
tempt.”
“Ballinagrub.
Four landrail.
Three wild-duck.
One woodcock.
Three days later Brackley slapped me on the back in our
club.
“What are you doing here?” I said.
the snipe have gone on strike.”
“All your fault,” he grumbled. “About half-an-hour
after I got, your infernal postcard six outsize Republican
soldiers called on me and gave me just ten minutes to get
a car and drive to the station. I told them what a silly
fool you were and that it was one of your wretched jokes;
but you can't expect an Irishman to see a joke. I tried to
explain it; I said that you referred to my exploits as a
sniper; and they replied that sniping was their department
and nobody else's.
“So I decided to come home and arrange for some shooting
in a place where there's a bit of peace. I'm thinking of
going after the ongdu antelopes in Somaliland. You can't
spare three months, can you?”
“Why didn't you face it out?” I said, knowing that
Brackley had spent four years and two months of his life
shooting Huns.
“Not worth while. I could have had a guard, of course.
But you can't expect decent snipe-shooting when there's a
lot of promiscuous firing going on in the district. The snipe
is a peculiarly nervous bird, you know.”

In Public Business the motion was:—
“That in the opinion of this House
Science is better than Sport.”
D. LLoyd GEORGE, Proposer (School
House), said that Science had won the
War, and quoted Wireless Telegraphy
and Daylight Saving to prove this. The
most successful Generals had had a
scientific training. His uncle had met
a General who knew algebra and used
it at the Battle of the Marne. Only
two first-class cricketers had ever been
in the Cabinet. Three scientists had.

H. Asquith, Opposer (Collegers),
said that the speech of the hon.
Proposer was a tissue of fabrications,
as ineffective as they were insincere.
Never in the whole course of his career
had he encountered a subterfuge so
transparent, a calumny so shameless
as the attempt of the Hon. Prop., he
might say the calculated and cynical
attempt of the Hon. Prop., to seduce
from their faith the tenacious acolytes
of Sport by the now threadbare recital
of the dubious and, on his own showing,
the anaemic enticements of Science.
The War had proved that Science was
no good.
This speaker is steadily improving,
but he has a tendency to a “fatal
fluency,” and he must beware of high-
sounding phrases. Also too man
passages in his speech sounded like
quotations.
A. BoxAR LAw, Seconder (Com-
moners), said that the War had proved
that Sport was no good. Gas had been
invented by Science. He pointed out
the importance of astronomy in navi-
gation.

he must not mumble.
E. G. PRETYMAN (Hodgeites) said
that farming was both a science and a
sport. The canal system of Great
Britain had been neglected. -
Some neat little epigrams.
LESLIE Scott (Collegers) said that
his father was a lawyer. Science had
been used in the Russo-Japanese War.
This speaker was not at his best.
Perhaps it was the gooseberries.
LESLIE WILsoN (Hittites) said that
his Christian name was the same as
the previous speaker's—(Laughter)—
but his views were very different.
(Loud laughter.) He would like to
ask the House which had done most
in the War—Tanks or Banks.
The speech of the evening. Witty
and well-argued. But he must not
fidget with his waistcoat-buttons.
W. S. CHURCHILL (Hivites) said that
this was a revolutionary motion. Sport
and Science must stand together. True
sport was scientific and true scientists
were sportsmen. (Applause.) Together
they would stand as an imperishable
bulwark against the relentless tide of
Socialism. Divided they would fall.

A DIFFICULT CASE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-This is one of
those social problems which end by
asking what A should do, only in this
case I want to know what you would
do.
It happened on the first day of my
leave, just after I had, as is my custom
on this day, had my hair cut and other-
wise made beautiful at a place in Bond
Street. (I am afraid this sounds as if
I was a rich man, but really I am a
Naval Officer.)
I was wearing—well, that would not
interest you, but it really was rather a
pleasant suit, with a hat which even
The Daily Mail could not improve
upon. Briefly, I was strolling along
in a perfectly contented frame of mind
when a horse, drawing a van, chose to
fall down right alongside me.
In a moment of rashness and chivalry
—have I said that the horse was being
driven by a girl?—I promptly sat on
the brute's head, an act which I had
always been told is the correct thing to
do, though, I should imagine, discour.
aging for the horse.
In my haste I sat down with my
back to the van, so was unable to gauge
the progress of the refitting work which
was going on.
In an effort to convey to the crowd,
which had, of course, collected, that I
was in no way embarrassed, nay more,
that I was well accustomed to sitting
on horses' heads in the middle of Bond
Street, I lit a cigarette and tried to
look blasé, no easy thing to do in the
circumstances.
Small boys made tactless remarks
about my personal appearance and
eccentric habits, but I ignored them,
feverishly thinking that this adventure
would necessitate an early visit to my
club. I had just decided what brand
of cocktail would best meet the case
when I felt a tap on my shoulder and
looked up at a vast blue expanse which
I realised later was a policeman.
“If you've quite finished with that
there 'orse you're sitting on, young
man,” he said, “the leddy wants to
take it 'ome.”
The crowd chuckled and I rose
hurriedly. Unfortunately, so did the
horse, urged on, possibly by the cries
and kicks of several willing helpers, or
possibly by the sight of his mistress,
who had come up, I hoped, to thank me.
Not only did the horse rise, but he
rose at full speed and without giving
me time to get my foot off the rein on
which I was unwittingly standing.
My leg shot into the air and I lost
all sense of direction for a few seconds.
Then a slight shock, and I found my-
self clasping the “leddy” firmly round
the neck.
At this juncture my aunt appeared.
My aunt, I should explain, is nothin
if not dignified. She is built on the
lines of a monitor, bluff in the bow,
broad in the beam, slow and majestic
of movement. Her lips were moving
feebly when I saw her, but she uttered
no sound, uncertain, I suppose, whether
to intervene or to pretend that I was
in no way connected with her.
Paralysed by her arrival, I saw her
slowly take in the scene. Her eye
wandered from the policeman to me,
from me to the unfortunate girl to
whom I still clung. I could see her
jumping—no, moving ponderously—
towards the wrong conclusion.
Mr. Punch, what would you have
done? An N.O.
[Your first thought should have been
for the girl, whom you had clearly com-
promised in your aunt's eyes.You should
at once have introduced her to that
lady as your long-lost fiancée. Later
in the afternoon you could have called
on your relative and told her that you
had mislaid the girl again—this time
irretrievably.—ED.]
Yours faithfully,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 15th-To induce
the House of Lords to accept a measure
for the compulsory acquisition of land
is analogous to the process of getting
butter out of a dog's
mouth; and it is not
surprising that Lord
PEEL essayed the task
of getting a second
reading for an Acquis-
ition of Lands Bill in
rather gingerly fash-
ion. When one re-
membered a racy cor-
respondence in the
newspapers over cer-
tain Midlothian farms
one could hardly have
been surprised if the
Laird of DALMENY
had reappeared in the
arena, flourishing his
claymore. But, alas!
he still remains in re-
tirement, and it was
left to Lord SUMNER
to administer some
sound legal thwacks
and, in his own words,
to “dispel the mirage
which the noble Vis-
count raised over the
sand of a very arid
Bill.” He did not op-
pose the Second Read-
ing, but hinted that if
ever it emerged from Committee its
own draftsman would not know it
The PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF
TRADE must regard Monday with rather

Questions addressed to his Department
have first place on the Order-paper;
and accordingly he has a lively quarter-
of-an-hour in coping with the contra-
dictory conundrums of Cobdenites and
Chamberlainites. On the whole he treads
the fiscal tight-rope with an imperturb-
ability worthy of BLONDIN. A Tariff Re-
former, indignant at the increased im-
ports of foreign glass-ware, provoked
the query, “Does my hon. friend regard
bottles as a key-industry?” And a Wee
Free Trader who sarcastically inquired
if foreign countries complained of our
dumping cement on them at prices
much above the cost in this country
was promptly told that “that is the
very reverse of dumping.”
Sir DoNALD MACLEAN was rewarded
to-night for all his uphill work as
leader of the Wee Frees before—and
since—Mr. Asquith's reappearance. On
the Financial Resolution of the Ministry
of Health Bill his eloquent plea for the
harassed ratepayers received an almost
suspiciously prompt response from Mr.
BoNAR LAw, who admitted that it was
inconvenient to drive an “omnibus"
measure of this kind through an Autumn
Session, and intimated that thirteen of
its clauses would be jettisoned. An

railway director, had on one occasion
carried out the functions of “shepherd
to a lambing flock.” The right hon.
Baronet, who is known to his intimates
as “Peckham,” will have Mr. PRETY-
MAN to thank if his sobriquet in future
is “Little Bo-Peep.”
Wednesday, November 17th. — The
Lords, having welcomed the Bishop of
DURHAM—a notable addition to the ora-
torical strength of the Episcopal Bench
—proceeded to show that even the lay
peers had not much to learn in the
matter of polite invective. Lord GAIN-
Ford invited them to declare that the
Government should forthwith reduce
its swollen Departmental staffs and in-
cidentally relieve our open spaces from
the eyesores that now
disfigure them. Per-
haps he laid overmuch
stress upon the latter
part of his motion, for
the Ministerial spokes-
man rode off on this
line—Lord CRAwFord
confessing that his ar-
tistic sensibility was
outraged by these “hor-
rible hutments"—and
said very little about
cutting down the staffs.
This way of treating the
matter dissatisfied the
malcontents, who voted
down the Ministry.
The Front Opposition
Bench in the Commons
was almost deserted at
Question - time. Pre-
sently the appearance
of Lieut.-Commander
KENworTHY in unusu-
ally festive attire fur-
nished an explanation.
After forty years of
bachelorship and four
of fighting, WEDGwood BENN is Bene-
dict indeed; and his colleagues were
attending his wedding-festivities.
The SECRETARY To THE ADMIRALTY
has not yet attained to the omniscience
in Naval affairs that his predecessor
acquired in the course of twelve years'
continuous occupancy of the post. But
Sir JAMES CRAIG can handle an awk-
ward questioner no less deftly than
“Dr. MAC.” Witness his excuse for
not replying to a “Supplementary":—
“The hon. and gallant gentleman must
understand that I attach so much im-
portance to his questions that I wish
to be most punctilious in my answers.”
Who could persist after that?
Mr. Bonar LAw stated that the
treaties by which Great Britain and
France were responsible for constitu-
tional government in Greece came to
an end in August last. Consequently
the two Powers have “a completely
free hand” in regard to the Greek
Monarchy. But he begged to be ex-
cused from saying in what manner that
“free hand " would be used if TINo
should think of returning.
Thursday, November 18th.-In the
Lords the Acquisition of Land Bill had
most of its teeth drawn. Lord SUMNER
was the most adroit of the many
operators employed, and he used no
3.S.
The usual dreary duel of Nationalist
insinuation and Ministerial denial in re-
gard to Irish happenings was lightened
by one or two interludes. Mr. JACK
JoNEs loudly suggested that the Gov-
ernment should send for General LU-
AMOR TRIUMPHANs.

DENDoRFF to show them how to carry
out reprisals. “He is no friend of
mine,” retorted the CHIEF SECRETARY,
with subtle emphasis. Later he read a
long letter from the C.-in-C. of the Irish
Republican Army to his Chief of Staff
discussing the possibility of enlisting
the germs of typhoid and glanders in
their noble fight for freedom. The
House listened with rapt attention until
Sir HAMAR came to the pious conclu-
sion, “God bless you all.” Amid the
laughter that followed this anti-climax
Mr. DEvLIN was heard to ask, “Was
not the whole thing concocted in Dublin
Castle 2 " Well, if so, Dublin Castle
must have developed a sense of humour
quite foreign to its traditions. Perhaps
that is the reason why the PRIME MIN-
ISTER, earlier in the ś. expressed
the opinion that “things in Ireland are
getting much better.”

A sombre court-house of Quarter
Sessions, the light with difficulty pene-
trating the dusty panes of the windows.
On the so-called Bench
sits the Bench so-called;
in point of fact there
are half-a-dozen ripe
aldermen sitting on
chairs, in the midst of
which is an arm-chair,
and in it Mr. Augustus
Jones, the Recorder of
Bilbury.
Born in 1873 of rich
but respectable parents;
called, with no uncer-
tain voice, to the Bar in
1894; of a weighty cor-
pulence and stormy vis-
age, Mr. Jones now set-
tles himself in his arm-
chair to hear and deter-
mine all this business
about Absalom Adkins
and the Boots. How
admirably impressive is
Mr. Jones's typically
English absence of hys-
teria, his calm, his rest-
fulness. Indeed, give
Mr. Jones five minutes
to himself and it is even
betting he would be fast asleep.
The Clerk of the Court with awful
dignity suggests getting a move on.
Mr. Blathwayte who, as well as Clerk
of the Court is also Town Clerk of Bil-
bury, was born in 1850 and, having
survived the intervening years, now
demands the production of the prisoner
from below. Looking at this dignitary
one gets the poetic impression of a mass
of white hair, white moustache, white
whiskers, white beard and white wig,
with little bits of bright red face ap-
pearing in between. From a crevice
in one of these patches come the omin-
ous words, of which we catch but a
sample or two: “. . . Prisoner at the
bar . . . for that you did . . . steal,
take and carry away . . . pairs of
boots . . . of our Lord the King, his
crown and dignity.”

nothing in particular. Counsel for the

lines the significant points, forgets that
his pencil is a blue one and licks it. On
a side-table, impervious to their sur-
roundings and apparently unconcerned
with their significance, sit the crucial
boots.
“How say you, Absalom Adkins”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THE LETTERS I NEVER POST.
I MET a philosopher the other day—
he is not a philosopher by profession,
but an architect—who told me that,
when annoyed by the anomalies and
petty red-tape restrictions of life or irri-
tated by incompetence and incivility, or
even when he feels that he can amend
somebody else's error or propose an im-
provement, it is his habit to write a
letter expressing his indigmation or em.
bodying his suggestions.
After remarking that he must be kept
very busy I asked him what kind of
replies he got.
“Oh, I don't get any replies,” he said,
“ because, you see, I don't send the let-
ters; I only write them and then I tear
them up.”
This is how I knew that he was a
philosopher.
I propose to take to philosophy myself.
To A TAXI-DRIVER,
DEAR SIR,-(You must understand,
as must all the people that I address
in these epistles, that by “dear " I do
not necessarily imply any affection. I
employ the word because I am too old
to care about breaking down harmless
conventions; but I might claim in the
present connection that it has more
than one meaning. That indeed you
will see, if you read on, is the main
point of this letter.)—Dear Sir, then,
you may remember me. I am the fare
who hailed you on your rank at the
corner of Fulham Road and Drayton
Gardens last Tuesday evening at a
quarter to six, and told you to drive to ||
the Marble Arch. You put down the
flag and then jumped off the box to
wind up the starter. It failed, and after
several attempts you had to examine
the machinery. I suppose that six
minutes were occupied in this way,
whether because you are a bad me-
chanic or a careless fellow or because
the engine is defective, I cannot say:
all I know is that I was in a hurry and
that the flag was down, but we were not
moving. If you had not put the flag
down I should have got out and taken
another cab; but I felt that that would
be unfair to you. When, however, at
the end of the journey I paid you
without adding any tip, and you re-
ceived the money with an offensive
grunt, I wished that I had been less
considerate.
It is because nothing that I could
have said then, in your horrid hostile
mood, would have convinced you that
there is any injustice to a fare at all in
putting down your flag before you are
properly started, that I am writing this
letter. My hope is that quiet perusal
may demonstrate that the fare has, at
any rate, a grain of logic on his side if
he looks upon himself as defrauded.
We don't, you know, take your cabs
for the joy of sitting in them, or for the
pleasure of watching you struggling
with a crank, but to be conveyed quickly
from place to place. It is wrong to ask
us to pay for the time spent by you in
persuading your engine to behave, and
it is indecent to become abusive when
we act on that assumption. If I had not
been so busy I should have refused to
pay at all and forced you to summon
me; but who has time for such costly
formalities? And I might have had
to lose my temper, which I have not
done (much) since I read an article by
a doctor saying that every such loss
means an abbreviation of life. Life in
a world made fit for heroes may not be
any great catch, but it is better, at any
rate, than passing to a region where
one is apparently liable to be in con-
stant communication with mediums.
One other thing. I have just re-
turned from Paris, where, amid much
that is unsatisfactory and besmirched
by Peace, taxis remain trustworthy and
plentiful. The price marked on the
meter is that which the fare pays, and
any number of persons may ride in the
cab without extra charge. Nothing
exceeds my scorn for the English taxi-
driver who demands another ninepence
for an additional passenger, even though
only a child—nothing except my scorn
for the cowardly official who conceded
this monstrous imposition.
To AN ADMINISTRATOR.
DEAR SIR,-May I implore you to
authorise the instant removal of the
buildings in the St. James's Park lake?
During the War we who find on the
suspension bridge, looking West, the
most beautiful late afternoon view in
London, were content to endure the
invasion. But we have passed the
second Armistice Day, and still the
huts remain, and still there is no water,
and still the enchanted prospect is
denied us. After all, this lake is part
of London, and London ratepayers
should be entitled to their city's beau-
ties as well as its necessities.
To A PRETTY GIRL.
MY DEAR,--I want you to be a little
more merciful. The other day, when
your father, over the eggs and bacon,
was reading out the news from Greece,
with the defeat of VENIZELos, you said
lightly that exile didn't matter very
much because VENIZELos was a very
old man. You then returned to the
absorbing occupation of identifying
Society people, reading from left to
right. Now WENIzELos is fifty-five
years of age, and I cannot allow the
term “very old" to be applied to him
without protest; I am too nearly his
contemporary. “Getting on,” if you
like, “mature,” “ripe,” but not “very
old.” You must keep that phrase for
the people who—well, who are very old.
To A HABERDASHER.
DEAR SIR,-When I came to put on
the collar that I bought from you yes-
terday (I am the tallish customer who
takes sixteen and a half by two and was
in a hurry to get home to dress) I found
that your young man's finger-marks
were on it. Why don't you make your
assistants wear gloves when they han-
dle collars ? - -
To A MINISTER of RELIGION.
YoUR FAR-FROM-SERENE GLooyſINEss,
—Won't you one day be a little cheer-
ful, and wrong? Won't you send out
a lifeboat to the wreck instead of watch-
ing her through your smoked field-
glasses as she sinks? What you seem
to forget is that most people at times
are their own Gloomy Deans: some of us
too often ; and there can be too much of
a good thing. Hopelessness butters no
parsnips and it is a mood not to be
encouraged or the world would be as
bad as we then think it. Gloomy-
deaniness, though salutary for brief in-
tervals, should be sparingly indulged
in; but you are at it all the time. There
is a Chinese proverb which says, “If
you can't smile don't open a shop;"
and, after all, St. Paul's Cathedral is in
a manner of speaking a kind of shop,
isn't it?—the goods, at any rate, should
be obtainable there. The phrase “there
is no health in us" does not constitute
the whole liturgy. Down with facile
optimists by all means, but, my dear

He is shot with a gun and hung up by

MORE NOTES FROM A SYNTHETIC COUNTRY DIARY.
November 20th.-I have been much struck this morning
by a remarkable instance of protective mimicry on the
part of a grey squirrel, which assumes attitudes and adopts
gestures which at a little distance render him almost indis-
tinguishable from a small monkey. WHITE's Selborne throws
no light on this strange phenomenon, which I can only
explain as a result on the animal world of the now fashion-
able Tarzan cult, which so happily reconciles the old hostility
between apes and angels.
Of the habits and customs of the hedgehog mention has
already been made in these notes. It may be added that
the whistle which these interesting creatures emit from time
to time resembles the timbre of a muted piccolo, and their
employment in a mixed orchestra is well worth the con-
sideration of our younger and more enterprising composers.
Another animal which shares with the hedgehog the de-
fensive faculty of rolling itself up in a ball is the “pill
millipede,” a myriopod with seventeen pairs of legs, but
fortunately exempt from the necessity of wearing trousers,
which at present prices would impose an exorbitant demand
on its resources.
As winter draws on the evolutions of birds great and
small are a never-ending source of surprise and delight.
Many hooded crows are now to be seen consorting with the
rooks in the field and swelling the sable multitude that
flies at evensong towards the park trees. And great con-
gregations of plovers, curiously self-sufficing in their ability
to dispense with the services of any feathered parson, lend
colour and subconscious uplift to marshland scenes, which
would otherwise look extremely triste. -
Small indigenous birds, such as titmice, chipmunks, pipits
and squinches, are constantly seen in coveys or even bevies
just now. A party of pipwinks visited my copse yesterday
afternoon, and indulged in delicious morceaua of melody
before the red sun sank starkly below the horizon. . .
As long as the weather remains open I find it a good
plan to plant flowers and shrubs which bloom in the spring.
Proticipation is a cardinal asset in the outfit of the judicious
gardener, and no time should be lost in completing the
spring beds, as the cost of hair-mattresses is going up by
leaps and bounds.
The Plague of Dots.
THERE are decimal dots which we can't do without
In spite of Lord RANDoLPH's historical flout;
There are dots too, with dashes combined, in the mode
Familiar in Morse's beneficent code;
While some British parents good reasons advance
In favour of “dots” as they're managed in France.
But as for the writers disdainful of plots
Who pepper their pages with plentiful dots,
They must not complain if the critics of prose
Disapprove of a practice which savours of pose,
And, searching around for an adequate ºri,
Proclaim it a sign of a brain that is dotty.
From an article on “Back to Germany”:—
“The quiet, old-fashioned restaurants, where in the old days I have

them no more.”—Daily Paper.

AT THE PLAY.
“WILL YOU KISS ME 2''
Even before the era of Prohibition
(there were cocktails in this play)
strange things must have happened in
“God's own country" under the banner
of the Bird of Freedom. But never so
strange as the effects you get on the
stage when very English people play
at being Americans. You have to be
rather young and unsophisticated if such
phrases as “He’s putting it over on us,”
or “I’m not going to stand for that,”
generously peppered about the dialogue
and recited in the purest of English
accents, can persuade you to believe
that you are getting the real local
stuff. At the same time you accept
cheerfully the most farcical con-
ditions on the vague assumption
that all things may be possible
over there.
So, when John W. Brook, of Fifth
Avenue, millionaire, engaged the
services of Alexander Y. Hedge,
plenipotentiary representative of
an Efficiency Company, to intro-
duce economic reforms into his
motherless household during his
temporary absence, we regarded it
as a most reasonable experiment.
And for a time it made excellent
fun. But after a while it began to
wear thin for lack of fresh stim-
ulus, and by the end of the Second
Act there was a general feeling in
the audience that something would
have to be done about it.
The same thought seems to have
occurred to Mr. CYRIL HARcourT,
the author, and he started, a little
late in the day, to introduce an
element of sex-romance into what
so far had been an absolutely
bloodless proposition. But at first
it was with sinister intent that
Brook's elder daughter made advances
to Alexander Y. Hedge. As soon as she
could induce this monster of inhuman-
ity to become a prey to her charm she
would repulse him with scorn, and
then he would have to go.
The children's allowances having been
cut off on the ground that they did
nothing to earn them, she offered her
services as his paid secretary. “Pro-
pinquity” did its work and she was
soon in a position to offer him the
privilege of an experimental kiss, thus
incidentally justifying the dreadful title
of the play.
The first, delivered on the cheek, was
a wash-out; but the second, pressed
home on the lips, had the desired effect.
Then she turned and rent him, telling
him exactly what she thought of his
treatment of the family. He replied
with an eloquent philippic directed at
the vices of a bloated aristocracy (this
was the ante-bellum age, before things
had been made so much safer for demo-
cracy). Almost before the applause of
the gallery had died down, the father
burst upon the scene, furious at the re-
port that this hired commercial had
been making love to his daughter.
Explanations follow which appease
his wrath, and he is further mollified by
the statement that the Master of Effi-
ciency had cut down the expenses of
his ménage by some nineteen thousand
dollars. But why, when his feats of
economy had all the time been the
matter of his offence in the children's
eyes, the announcement of the total
STEPS TOWARD EFFICIENCY.
Horace, the Butler (MR. C. V. FRANCE) lengthens his
stride in obedience to .
Alexander Y. Hedge (MR. DoNALD CALTHROP).
should have favourably affected the
girl's heart I cannot say, and I don't
think anybody else can. Yet the fact
remains that the next moment she
undertakes to marry the object of her
previous loathing.
To have arrived naturally at such an
end would have meant a couple more
Acts, in which the man Hedge might
have had time to live down the evil
effects of his efficiency. But with so
much economy in the air the author
appears to have caught the infection
of it and economised in his processes
to save our time. That is the kindest
excuse I can find for him.
As for the moral, it would seem to
be that, if (as is more than probable)
you have no copy of the works of
ARISTOTLE in your Fifth Avenue library,
and imagine, never having heard of the
happy mean, that virtue lies in one of
two excesses—an excess of idle luxury
or an excess of efficiency—the former
is the one to choose. -
Mr. DoNALD CALTHROP as Hedge
bore the burden of the play with a high
hand that had a very sure touch. It
was extraordinary with what alertness
and confidence he commanded every
situation—except, of course, the absurd
climax which nobody could hope to
handle. Mr. C. W. FRANCE, as the Eng-
lish butler (ex-clergyman) who had
taken a long time to learn how to dis-
figure his aspirates (out of deference to
the American legend), gave a very fresh
and attractive performance. Some of
the best things in the dialogue—not
always very humorous—were given
to little Alice Brook (aged 14), one
of those precocities for which
America has always held the
world's record. I don't know, and
should not think of asking, Miss
ANN TREvoR's age, but she looked
to me a little old for the part of
this child, however precocious.
Miss MARJORIE GORDON played
with intelligence as the elder sister,
but never for a moment suggested
a New York atmosphere. Indeed
she adopted just the mincing kind
of speech which out there is held
to bewray the “Britisher.” The
only performance that made any
real pretence of being American was
that of Mr. TURNBULL as the man-
ager of the Efficiency Company.
Still, after all, local colour is no
great matter so long as you get
some recognisable aspect, though
farcically presented, of human na-
ture; but the trouble with this
play is that while our sense of the
probabilities is never too much
outraged so long as the chief char-
acter is just a piece of inhuman
machinery, the author lapses into
the incredible the moment he tries to
introduce a little humanity into his
scheme. However, I have perhaps
taken things too seriously, instead of
being properly grateful for some very
good entertainment. O. S.

EXCITING EXPERIENCE OF A NEW M.F.H. WHO HAS BEEN ADVISED BY A FRIEND THAT HE SHOULD
ALWAYS, WHEN GOING INTO KENNELS, FILL HIS POCKETS WITH BISCUITS.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
INEVITABLY one's first thought on sighting A Naval
History of the War (Hodder AND Stoughton) is that he
must be a brave skipper indeed who would take out a lone
ship, however excellently found, to cruise such controversial
waters. But Sir HENRY NEwBoLT is an experienced hand,
and, though (so to speak) one finds him at times conscious
of Sir JULIAN CoRBETT on the sky-line, he brings off his
self-appointed task triumphantly. To drop metaphor, here
is a temperate and clearly-written history, midway be-
tween the technical and the popular, of a kind precisely
suited to the plain man who wishes a comprehensive résumé
of the course of the War at sea. For this purpose its
arrangement is admirable, the story being presented first
in a general survey under dates, then in special chapters
devoted to episodes or aspects, e.g., Coronel and the Falk-
lands (that unmatchable drama of disaster and revenge),
the submarines and their countering, and finally Jutland.
Throughout, as I have said, Sir HENRY, having one of the
best stories in the world to tell, is at pains to avoid any-
thing that even remotely approaches fine writing. Only
once have I even detected the literary man, when, in describ-
ing the strange finish of the Königsberg, he permits himself
the pleasure of calling it “the sea fight in the forest.” For
the rest, the “strength and splendour” of England's greatest
naval war are left to make their own impression. I shall
be astonished if such a book, having figured brilliantly as a
present this Christmas, is not treasured for generations as
a work of family reference in hundreds of British homes.
The name of Mrs. BELLoc LowNDEs on the outside would
alone have made me open From the Wasty Deep (HUTCH-
INSoN) with a pleasant anticipation of creepiness, even
without the generous measure of bogies depicted on the
coloured wrapper. Having now read the story, I am bound
to add (and I can only hope that Mrs. LowNDEs will take
my admission for the compliment that it really is) that the
net result has been one of slight disappointment. Briefly,
I continue to prefer the writer as a criminal, rather than a
psychic, “Fat Boy.” After all, once grant your ghost and
anyone can conjure it, with appropriate circumstance, at
the proper moments. Wyndfell Hall was full enough of
ghosts, all ready to appear at the voluntary or involuntary
instance of a young lady named Bubbles, who was one of
the Christmas house-party and the owner of a rather un-
comfortable gift of spook-raising. But beyond making
themselves an occasional nuisance to the guests I couldn't
find that the phantoms did anything practical to help along
such plot as there was. Even the quite palpable fact that
the host was at least a double murderer came to proof by
the ordinary process of law rather than by any supernatural
revelation. Before this I have gratefully owed to Mrs.
LowNDEs the raising of my remaining hairs like quills upon
the fretful porcupine, but the ca'-canny bogies of her present
story are too perfunctory to excuse even a shiver in any but
the most unsophisticated reader.
It may, I suppose, be accounted for righteousness to
Major-General Sir ARCHIBALD ANsoN that in About Others
and Myself (MURRAY) he is so little of an egotist as to
convey scarcely any impression of what manner of man he

is or what he thinks of this or that. Much more clear
from her quoted letters is the character of his grandmother,
who vainly tried to keep the over-gallant First Gentleman
of Europe out of mischief. Our autobiographer gives us a
plain, blunt, not to say bald record of what must have been
an interesting life. He was at Eton under KEATE; a
cadet at Woolwich, where he saw a gunner receive two
hundred lashes; a gunnery subaltern in the Crimea, where
he saw many queer and unedifying things; a successful
administrator in Madagascar, Mauritius and Penang, and
finally Governor of the Straits Settlements, with a K.C.M.G.
and honourable retirement to follow. But he is a man of
action rather than words, and his faculty of observation is
but too often exercised upon such slender matters as that
“Poor Captain Powlett met with a misfortune on the way
Mr. B. BENNION follows the vogue for confidentially de-
scriptive covers in announcing, as a title to his volume of
angling reminiscences, that The Trout are Rising in England
and South Africa (LANE) and suggesting that here is “a book
for slippered ease.” One is certainly warned not to expect
anything very strenuous in its course, and indeed so placidly
flow its waters that few, perhaps, but devotees of the craft
will follow it to the end. Not but what there are meta-
phorical trout in it, too—enticing descriptions of bits of
rivers, for instance—but on the whole they are easy-
going fish that come to bank without showing very much
sporting spirit. Here is no manual of precise information,
though even old fishermen may gather a hint or two; nor
yet a guide-book to the trout-streams of two continents;
not even a collection of good stories, though anyone may

dinner things on the deck of the
gunboat, then went below for
something and, coming up again,
accidentally walked into the mid-
dle of the crockery and glass,
causing considerable destruc-
tion.” Also, I think he quotes
his testimonials — those never
very candid and always very dull
documents—much too freely.
The best of the book is con-
cerned with his administration
work in Penang and district,
where on the evidence he seems
to have kept his end up with
skill and no small zeal for good
government.
The title of Lady (LAURA)
TROUBRIDGE's new novel, O Per-
fect Love (METHUEN), applies to
her W.C. hero only; with his
wife it is a case of O Very Im-
perfect Love. Jean Chartres is a
common product of the age, the
sort of girl that insists on “hav-
ing a good time” and “living her
life” and “being herself” (how
well one knows the jargon!).
Less common, let us hope, is
the woman who would desert
her husband, as Jean did, be-
cause the injuries he had re-

come across some old friends in
it. The author's yarns indeed
are numerous and, on the whole,
as an angler's yarns should be,
picturesque. If he does seem to
enjoy the rather feeble joke or
incident as much as the other
sort, that may be natural in a
book of ease, whether slippered
or not. Indeed one half sus-
pects it is as a book for his own
ease that the writer is mainly
considering it, yet, taken in the
right spirit and especially if you
are an enticer of trout, it may
be for your ease too. Of course,
if you are not an angler and if
your spirit is not right, the
slipper may not fit.
In the course of a long study
of detective fiction I have never
met any sleuths with a gift of
loquacity like that of Messrs.
Corson and Gibbs, who during
the first part of In the Onyx
Lobby (Hodder AND SToUGHToN)
make futile efforts to trace the
murderer of Sir Herbert Binney,
proprietor of Binney's Buns.
Sir Herbert had gone to New
York to persuade his nephew
to become the manager of an
American branch of a Binney
ceived in the War prevented him from giving her the kind of
life for which she craved. Foolish rather than vicious, she
drifts into a relationship which could have had only one
conclusion, if her lover, tiring of platonics, had not prema-
turely pressed his demands. Thoroughly scared by his
violence she runs away and finds sanctuary with the “per-
fect love” of the title. In this happy solution she had
better fortune than she deserved. It is not every woman
who has the good luck, when rushing blindly out of the
House of Peril into the wintry night (in a ball-dress), to
find—what had apparently escaped Jean's memory for the
moment—that her faithful husband's estate is in the imme-
diate neighbourhood. Though Lady TRouBRIDGE's sense of
style is not impeccable she can tell a good tale; her dialogue
rings true and her characters are well observed. The
trouble with most authors of Society novels is that either
they know their subject but can't write, or that they can
write but know nothing of their subject. Lady TRoUBRIDGE
is one of the very few writers in this kind who both know
their world and how to portray it.
Bun factory, and, on returning late at night to his apart-
ment-house, was stabbed to death. Fortunately Miss
CAROLYN WELLs seems to have grown as tired of them as
I did, and they give way to one Pennington Wise (whose
name did not prepossess me in his favour) and his assistant,
Zizi. This couple have the authentic sleuth-touch, and
their detection of those implicated in the murder is a very
ingenious piece of work. There is so much padding in this
book that if Sir Herbert had worn a tithe of it no stabber
could even have scratched him; but with judicious skip-
ping it will wile away two or three idle hours. And, as I
said, the solution is a really skilful piece of work.

THE STANDARD GOLF-BALL.
I Do not want a standard ball,
So many to the pound; -
Whether its girth is trim and svelte
Or built to take an out-size belt,
I hardly seem to care at all
So long as it is round.
But it appears to my poor wit
That we might well contrive
A means by which the merest babe
Would hold his own with MITCHELL (ABE),
If we could have a standard hit
(Especially the drive).
I want a limit made to bar
The unrestricted whack
(A hundred yards I think should be
The length on which we might agree),
And if you pushed the ball too far
You'd have to bring it back.
And I should love a standard lie.
A ball inside a cup
Or latent under sand or whin
Hampers my progress toward the pin;
It would improve my game if I
Could lift and tee it up.
But most, when tongues of golfers wag,
Talking their dreadful shop
Of rotten luck and stymies laid
And chip-approaches, TAYLOR-made—
Oh, then I want a standard gag
To make the blighters stop. O. S.
THE LANGUAGE FOR LOGIC.
“VERY well,” I said, “if Jones is laid up I'll go round
myself.”
Our French visitor chuckled quietly and then shrugged
his shoulders by way of apology.
“Pardon,” he murmured with the most disarming polite-
ness, “but your English language it is so veray funny, and
I 'ave not yet become quite used to it. Is it not that it
lack the accuracy, what you call the logic, of the French”
“Indeed,” I said, without the least interest.
But my wife was all enthusiasm. She clapped her hands
in delighted agreement. “M. du Val is quite right, Dickie,”
she said. “We are a frightfully illogical lot, aren't we? I
mean, the French are able to say just exactly what they
mean.” -
“Your reinforcement, Madame, it completes my victory,”
replied the Frenchman with a graceful gesture. “Voyez,
M'sieu',” he added, turning to me, “you 'ave just said Zat
your friend is laid up, when the unfortunate truth is zat
he is laid down, and because of zat you will encircle, sur-
round, make a tour of your person.”
“There, you see,” said my wife flatly, “it’s all utterly
illogical. Think how logical the French are.”
“Well, let us work it out,” I said in hearty agreement.
“As a start I solemnly declare that the French are not
so logical as they don't think.”
“As they don't think?” repeated my wife in surprise.
“Ah!” I retorted, “you are not so observant as you
might not be. I was merely giving you a little French
idiom, “logically' and ‘accurately done into English.’”
“Mister,” I next asked our ally, “your visit to England,
will she be prolonged 2"
“Who's the lady?” interrupted my wife.
“M. du Val's visit, of course, dear,” I informed her. “You
forget that the French are particularly logical with their
genders.”
“M'sieu' ' " murmured the guest, rather puzzled.
“I asked,” I went on for M. du Val's edification, “because
if you stay long enough you may have the pleasure of
meeting the parents of Mistress my wife. They are coming
to the house of us next month. His father is extremely
anxious to see her daughter, whom he has not seen since
his wedding * *
“Whom in the world are you talking about?” muttered
my wife.
“Monsieur will readily understand,” I said wickedly,
“that I allude to my wife and their parents. I hope they
will bring his brother with them.”
“‘Her,' you should say,” my wife put in with the suspicion
of a snap. “There's only Johnny and me.”
“It was of Johnny I spoke,” I assured her. “And, by
the way, if you haven't heard the latest gossip it may in-
terest you to hear that the young rascal has formed an
attachment, and is very proud of her fiancée. She is an
awfully pretty girl and quite athletic as well—in fact, his
arm is not nearly so small as Johnny's isn't, and his carriage
is perfect. Their eyes are lovely, while a poet would rave
about his sweet nose, her rosebud mouth and their longs
blacks hairs. Their shoes * > -
“Oh, stop!” cried my wife. “You're muddling me all
up. Are you talking about Johnny or x -
“Name of a pipe, my cabbage,” I said, determined to
give her logic with swear-words and endearments as well,
“where has your reasoning gone to ? Any logical French-
man would tell you at once that I wasn't talking about
Johnny, but about her girl. As I was saying, their shoes
have each a dinky Gibson bow on her.” -
“M'sieu',” reflected M. du Val in his polite way, “I begin
to think zat you are getting ze advantage over me.”
“Don’t take any notice of him, Mosseer,” pleaded my
wife indignantly; “he's only pulling your leg.”
“Pulling my ?” The Frenchman cogitated for a
minute; then he understood and smiled in a superior way
again. “All the same,” he murmured quietly, “we French
'ave not all ze illogicalness, n'est ce pas ?” - -
“Not quite all,” I cheerfully agreed. “By the way,
would you like to come with us this afternoon to the great
Review in Hyde Park? Her Majesty the KING will be
there, also the QUEEN and very likely His Royal Highness
Princess MARY—"
“I come wiz muchness of pleasure,” assented our guest
very hurriedly. Then, being a thorough little sportsman,
he added with a bow :- -

IV.-DR. ADDIsoN.
THE ridiculous tradition of govern-
ment by K.C.’s has for some time past.
been broken down, and quite a number
of our present Ministers have never
taken silk in their lives, except from
cocoons in a match-box. There is at
least one business man in the Cabinet,
and even the Lord CHANCELLOR, great
lawyer though he is, is almost equally
renowned as a horseman. “He sits
the Woolsack,” a hard-riding Peer has
said of him, “almost as though he were
part of it.”
Of this tendency to break away from
the Bar Dr. ADDIsoN is one of the plea-
santest examples. We Englishmen
surely owe as much to our great physi-
cians as to our great lawyers, and in
some cases indeed the fees are even
higher. After the Demosthenic periods
and Ciceronian verbosity of some of our
previous rulers Dr. Addison's bright
bedside manner with an ailing or mori-
bund Bill is a refreshing spectacle. The
shrewd face under the shock of white
hair is too well known to need descrip-
tion. The small black bag and the slight
bulge in the top-hat, caused by the
stethoscope, are equally familiar. Nor
is there wanting in Dr. ADDIsoN that
touch of firmness which is so necessary
to a good practitioner and in his case
comes partly, no doubt, from his Lincoln-
shire origin, for he was born in the
county which has already produced such
men as Sir Isa Ac NEwToN, the late
Lord TENNYSON, M. WoRTH of Paris,
the present Governor of South Aus-
tralia and HEREwARD THE WAKE.
None but the robustest of officials is
allowed to direct the affairs of the new
Ministry of Health. The patron saint
of its Chief is St. Pancreas and his eu-
pepsia is reflected in his subordinates.
His junior clerks whistle continuously,
his liftmenyodel, his typists sing. Of his
own official methods I have been privi-
leged to obtain the report of an eye-wit-
ness. Let us suppose that, as frequently
happens, a deputation of disappointed
house-hunters has arrived to see him.
Leader of Deputation. We want houses
and we won't wait. . -
Dr. Addison (tapping his forehead and
glancing significantly at his Private Sec-
retary). Tck, tek! That's very serious.
Shall we feel the pulse?
[Leader of Deputation puts his hand
out. Private Secretary takes out
his watch. Siarty seconds elapse.
Dr. Addison. Do you take much
walking exercise 2
Leader of Deputation. No.
Dr. Addison. Ah, I thought as much.
“After breakfast walk a mile,
After dinner rest awhile.”
What you need is a good sound consti-
tutional every morning. If you see any
houses, of course there is no objection
to your looking at them. But keep on
walking, mind; don't loiter. And come
back to me in a month's time and we'll
see how you are then.
[Exit Deputation, looking slightly
dazed.
Almost equally successful is Dr. AD-
Dison's professional method in dealing
with representatives of the Building
Trades Unions. A bricklayers' leader,
let us say, has expounded at great length
the technical difficulties which prevent
rapidity of construction.
Dr. Addison (softly and suddenly).
Take a deep breath. (Bricklayer takes

it.) Say ninety-nine! (Bricklayer tries
hard.) Where do you feel the pain 2 ~~
Bricklayer. In the shoulders and
arlins.
Dr. Addison. Tck, tck, we must go
easy. Don't take it too quickly, and
we'll have you right again before the
year's out. Try three bricks a day and
come and see me in a month's time.
These, however, are not the only
methods by which Dr. ADDIson has
attempted to remedy the crisis. At his
suggestion a permanent sub-committee
of the Cabinet, called “The Happy
Homes for Heroes' Panel,” was ap-
pointed, and it was during one of its
sessions that the bright idea of Hous-
ing Bonds was originated, I believe by
Sir ALFRED Mond. If the campaign
has not met with the success which it
deserves, the cause is probably to be
found in the slightly unfortunate title
whose assonance suggests to the public
mind the “House of Bondage" in the
Psalms. It would have been better, I
think, to adopt Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBER-
LAIN's suggestion, which was “The
Cosy Cot Combine.”
However, things are not as bad as
they might seem, and outside one large
suburb the other day I observed a gang
of bricklayers actually in operation,
anxiously hovered over by a clerk from
the Ministry, thermometer in hand.
I think I have forgotten to mention in
this brief sketch that Dr. ADDIsoN has
a frame of iron. Since I have said it
of all the other Cabinet Ministers of
whom I have spoken, I ought certainly
to say it of Dr. ADDIsoN too. Like
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, like Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL, like Sir ERIC GEDDEs, the
MINISTER of HEALTH AND Housing has
a frame of iron. All that he really
needs is the concrete. K.

[We print as it reaches us this strange in-
coherent ejaculatory effusion, signed “A Lover

spirit of this valediction it is possible to feel a
certain amount of sympathy, but the author
is clearly inaccurate in including amongst the
bygone glories of the institution which he
deplores places, persons, musical and even
culinary features which are by no means
obsolete. We confess also to grave misgiving
as to the purity of the writer's style, which in
some lines seems to smack more of the debased
Anglo-Italian of Soho than the crystal-clarity
of the Tuscan of Carducci.]

RACING AS A BUSINESS.
[The kind of article which one may confi-
dently look for in the sporting columns of a
penny newspaper at this time of the year.]
FROM the very beginning of the season
I have insisted that our objective should
be “the winter's keep.” Those who
have stuck to me all along and played
my system are on velvet.
During the flat-racing year I have
given a hundred-and-fourteen selections.
Let me just tabulate the results; I like
tabulating, for it fills my column in no
time.
Selections. Wom. Second. Third. Unplaced.
114 5 8 1 100
N.B.-Non-starters neglected.
The above is a statement of which I
may well be proud. I assert with con-
fidence that few sporting journalists
can show anything like this record.
Certain captious correspondents like
“O. T.” and “Disgusted" have pointed
out that my selections during this
period show a loss of £1049s. 11}d. on
a flat stake of £1. All I can say is
that people who bet increasing stakes
are increasing, while people who bet
flat stakes are Well, that disposes
of “Disgusted" and “O. T.” My
readers know that my system is to
have the minimum stake on the losers
and the maximum stake on the winners.
We shall never attain that abstract per-
fection, but we should keep this ideal
before us. I believe in idealism; it pays.
Take yesterday's selections, for in-
stance. Here they are, with results
tabulated :— -

That I consider a highly successful
day's racing, provided your stakes were
proportionally placed ; and here again
I must insist on my principle of maxi-
mum and minimum stakes.
Let us suppose, as naturally most of
my readers did, that a backer went to
the course with a bookmaker's credit
of twenty thousand pounds and a thou-
sand or so spare cash in his pocket.
Being a shrewd man he would place £1
on Breathing Time to win. (I daresay
even “O. T.” and “Disgusted " did me
the honour of following me so far.) On
Taddenham, true to my principles, our
backer would raise his stake to £1 10s.
Aminta I. would carry £2, or £2 10s.
if he were punting. But I cannot too
strongly discourage this habit of making
violent increases in stake; it is almost
gambling. Much better put on only
£2 with a safe bookmaker, such as Mr.
Bob Mowbray, of Conduit Street, whose
advertisement appears elsewhere in our
columns.
To proceed, our backer finds to his
relief that Giddy Gertie is a non-starter
and retires to the refreshment bar for
a bracer. The 2.30 race being run off
he returns to the Ring for the serious
business of the day. After examining
Transformation in the paddock and lis-
tening to the comments of the knowing
ones—“Too thick in the barrel,” “Too
long in the pastern,” “Too moth-eaten
in the coat"—he will exercise caution
and, instead of “putting his shirt" on
Transformation and plunging to the
extent of, say, £5, will put up not more
than £3 10s. and await the result with
calmness. When Transformation is re-
turned unplaced (or, as “O. T.” and
“Disgusted" would say, “also ran ")
our backer is not abashed. Taking full
advantage of his credit he places his
twenty thousand on Likely Case, to-
gether perhaps with the odd thousand
or so in his pocket, being careful, how-
ever, to ascertain that his return ticket
is still safely in his possession.
Our backer is shrewd enough to under-
stand that this is a case for the maximum
stake. Strong in his faith in my prin.
ciple he sees Likely Case win with little
surprise.
Returning to Town that evening he re-
cords his day's dealings in this manner:

I may mention that the official s.p.
of 20 to 1 on Likely Case is distinctly
cramped. On the course it was possible
to obtain more generous terms and lay
only 19 to 1 on.
Thus one sportsman by careful ob-
servance of my principle has stacked
up a goodly array of chips towards his
winter's keep. All this goes to show
that if a man will bet sanely and avoid
“going for the gloves” he can make a
modest competence on the Turf.

In Nurseries, Weight-for-age races
and so on I make it a rule to give only
one selection, but in a struggle of this
importance I expect to receive a little
more latitude. Of these, then, I take
Mayana and Periwig to beat the field.
At the same time I feel strongly that
Wise Uncle's form at Kempton was not
correct, and that he will nearly win, if
he can beat Beatus, who seems to be
let in nicely at 7 st. All the above will
be triers, but it is doubtful whether any
amount of trying will enable them to
beat Avignon, whose chances I am con-
tent to support. I conclude by wishing
my readers a good time over this race.
NEW RHYMES FOR OLD CHILDREN.

THE worms, the worms, the wriggly
worms,
They keep on eating earth,
And always in the grossest terms
Complain about their birth;
They have no eyes, they have no eyes,
They cannot read a book;
I wonder if they realise
What dreadful things they look.
The trowel cuts them quite in half,
It is a bitter cup ;
They give a sour sardonic laugh
And sew the pieces up;
They sew them up and wind away
With seeming unconcern,
But oh, be careful! one fine day
I hear the worm will turn.
And though I don't know what it means,
I know what reptiles are:
They love to make unpleasant scenes
When people go too far;
However calm he seems to be
When only cut in two,
If you go cutting him in three
I don't know what he 'd do !

THE PLACE OF-THE TROMBONE
IN THE BAND.
WHEN I speak of the place of the
trombone in the band I am not referring
to his site or locality. That is for the
conductor to settle. My purpose is to
give an intelligentreply to the oft-quoted
query, “Why the trombone?”
Everybody knows that it is not in the
band for musical purposes. It is not a
musical instrument. The man who could
extract music from a trombone could get
grapes out of a coal-mine.
No, its raison d'étre is mostly critical
and punitive. It is there to see that
the orchestra does its job and to put the
fear of a hectic hereafter into the man
who is out of step with his fellow-con-
DELssoHN's or GLüCKSTEIN's “Wedding
March.” The effect on an orchestra is
immediate and immense. Somewhere
behind each of these stiff shirt-fronts
beats a heart that thrills at every sug-
gestion of romance. It is well known
that, when at intervals during a per-
formance they retire through the man-
hole under the stage, it is to imbibe
another chapter of ETHEL. M. DELL or
of “Harried Hannah, the Bloomsbury
Bride.” And so the lingering embrace
of the lovers sets them tingling and
they tackle the “Wedding March " at
the double. The clarionet (or clarinet)
wipes the tears from his eyes and puts
a sob in his rendering; the cornet un-
swallows his mouthpiece and, getting
his under-jaw well jutted out, decides
perform the marriage ceremony there
and then.
But the trombone introduces the
hard practical note, the necessary cor-
rective. His monotonous grunt is used
to remind the audience of marriage as
it is lived in real life, of the girl at
breakfast in unmarcelled hair, of the
man dropping cigarette-ash on the best
carpet, of double income-tax, of her
family, of his, of her bills for frocks, of
his wandering off to golf or the club,
and a host of other incidentals.
A reaction takes place among the
audience. Men who had been a moment
before estimating the price of a diamond-
ring turn their thoughts to two-stroke
motor-bicycles, and girls decide that
love in a cottage is an over-rated pas-
spirators.
The uninformed
have a vague idea that
the conductor should
do that with his little
stick. But I put it to
you, what use would a
little stick be against a
manlike the big drum?
A meat - axe would
have some point, but
the difficulties of con-
ducting with a meat-
axe will be obvious to
even the least musical.
When the French
horn, in the throes of
aliver attack, sees sup-
plementary spots on
the score and plays
them with abandon,
or when the clarionet
(or clarinet), having
inadvertently sucked
down a fly which in

use language unbefitting a solemn occa-
sion ? Does he pick up his music-stand
and hurl it at the offender ? He does
not. It would be a breach of etiquette.
He simply signals to the trombone,
who promptly turns the exit part of his
instrument on the culprit and gives a
bray that makes the unfortunate man's
shirt-front crumple up like a concertina.
That is discipline.
Then again the trombone is employed
as a sort of brake when in a moment
of excitement the rest of the orchestra
has a tendency to overdo things.
For example, all will remember the
throbbing moment at the end of the
drama, where the hero and heroine,
murmuring “At last !” fall into each
other's arms and move slowly off the
stage whilst the band starts up MEN-
to put a jerk in it; the piccolo pickles
with furious enthusiasm; the 'cello puts
his instrument in top-gear with his left
hand and saws away violently with the
other ; the triangle, who has fallen
perhaps into a Euclidian dream, sits
up and gets a move on ; the stevedore
—no, no, that is the next chapter—the
oboe, the French horn, the kettledrum,

with both feet and let her go.
They try to depict golden lands of
radiant sunshine, where beautiful
couples stroll hand-in-hand for ever
and the voice of the turtle replaces
that of the raucous vendor of the racing

of the audience would be to send them

I was admiring Cripstock's baro-
meter.
“Take it,” he said.
“My dear Cripstock!” I exclaimed,
as I pulled it from the wall.
“My dear fellow!” he replied, in tones
more of gratitude than of generosity.
I have fastened it in my hall at the
regulation distance from the hat-rack
and between the assegais. It will be
nice company for the dinner-gong,
which it faces. I purposely did not
place them side by side, for fear of any
error in tapping.
These delicate contrivances do not
readily settle down in a new home, and
for a week I ignored the barometer.
This may have seemed unfriendly to a
newcomer, yet surely it was kind not
to observe any faults it might display
during its novitiate. When on the Satur-
day morning I scrutinised it for the first
time I saw it pointed to “Stormy.” I
hastened over breakfast in order to get
into the garden in time to fix up the
starboard fence. After working fever-
ishly for three hours, glancing at the
sky at frequent intervals, I heard the
“All clear " signalled from a back
window, the needle having swung round
to “Set Fair.”
There it remained for several days, a
marvel of accuracy. My poor umbrella
began to wear a look of neglect, but
my walking-stick was jubilant. “Set
Fair” it was again on the Friday, and
again I set out with my happy malacca.
On my return wet through I had
another proof of the excellence of my
faithful aneroid. Its needle pointed
imperatively to “Change.” This, in
fact, I had already decided to do, but to
a less careful man the instruction must
have been of inestimable advantage.

MORE HINTS TO SOCIAL CLIMBERS: HOW TO ATTRACT NOTICE.
THE BROWN LADY.
WE were talking of the sex, the dark
and the fair, and “Give me,” he said,
“a brunette every time. But how
seldom one meets them now !"
I expressed surprise at this.
“Yes,” he said, “it is so. Plenty of
women with dark hair, but not dark
skins. The true brunette is very rare.”
“I know one,” I said; “probably the
most perfect brunette in London.”
“Young 2" he asked.
“Yes,” I said.
“Could I—would you take me to
see her?” he asked.
“Certainly,” I said.
“When 2" he asked.
“Now,” I said; “this afternoon. But
we must hurry. Her servants have
orders not to let anyone in after four.”
“You’re sure she won't mind?” he
asked.
“Absolutely,” I said. “My friends
are hers. I've introduced lots of people
to her and she's delighted.”
He smiled blissfully.
Having obtained a taxi I gave an
address in Regent's Park, but told the
driver to stop at a shop on the way.
“She loves sweets,” I explained.
“They all do,” he replied, with the
sententiousness of gallantry, as though
speaking from abysmal depths of know-
ledge. -
“Yes, but she has a more catholic
taste than most,” I said. “She's the
only brunette—or, if it comes to that,
the only blonde—I ever knew with a
weakness for—well, I'll make you
guess.” -
“Preserved ginger?” he suggested.
“No,” I said. -
“American pop-corn ?”
“Not that I know,” I said.
“Tell me,” he replied.
“Condensed milk,” I said.
“Good Heavens !” he exclaimed.
“Condensed milk? That's the oddest
thing I've ever heard.” -
“That's what I'm getting,” I said;
“and it won't injure your chances with
her if you take her a pot of honey.”
“But I don't know her,” he submitted.
“It doesn't matter,” I said; “she's
the most unconventional creature in the
world—just a child of nature.”
“Delicious !” he murmured.
“She's a Canadian, you see,” I added.
“Oh, a Canadian,” he replied, as
though that explained everything. “And,
by the way, what's her name?”
“She lets me call her Winnie,” I said.
“And what do I call her ?” he asked.
“Well,” I said, “if I were you I'd
call her Winnie too. She'd love it."
“This is extraordinarily interesting,"
he replied. “But you know I'm far
too shy to do a thing like that.”
When, however, the time came and
we were shown into Winnie's drawing-
room in Mappin Terrace and the most
adorable brown bear in captivity came
lumbering towards us, he called her
Winnie as naturally as her keeper does
or any of the Canadian soldiers whose
mascot she was, and he held the honey-
pot for her until her tongue had ex-
tracted every drop. She then clawed
at his pocket for more.
“I told you she'd like you,” I said.
“Isn't she a pet 2 And a brunette

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 22nd.—Fortu-
nately or unfortunately, according to
one's point of view, this deponent was
not a spectator of the fight in the
House of Commons this afternoon,
having been himself previously knocked
out by a catarrhal microbe possessing,
as the sporting journals say, “a remark-
A LECTURE TO THE UPPER SCHOOL.

able punch.” He therefore gives the
fracas an honourable miss.
The Tariff Reformers were horrified
to hear from Sir Robert HoRNE that
nearly four hundred thousand pounds'
worth of clocks had been imported from
Germany this year. They were quite
under the impression that when we
wound up the Watch on the Rhine
clocks were included.
They were still more surprised to
learn that without further legislation
it is impossible for British parents,
when purchasing toys for their children,
to be sure that they are not the pro-
ductions of our late enemies. It would
appear that the famous label, “Made in
Germany,” which did so much to ad-
vertise the products of the Fatherland
before the War, has now outlived its
usefulness; but the goods are coming
along just the same.
Tuesday, November 23rd.—Lord BIRK-
ENHEAD's complete recovery from his
recent ear-trouble was attested by the
ease and mastery of his speech in moving
the Second Reading of the Government
of Ireland Bill. Some men in this situa-
tion might have been a little embar-
rassed by their past. But Sir Edward
CARSoN's erstwhile “galloper" neither
forgot nor apologised for his daring
feats of horsemanship, and triumph-
antly produced a letter from his former
chief assuring “my dear Lord Chan-
cellor" that “Ulster” had come round
to the view that “the best and only
solution of the question is to accept
the present Bill and to endeavour to
work it loyally.”
For the rest he minimised the temp-
orary partition of Ireland and laid stress
on the ultimate union to be effected by
the Council of Ireland; magnified the
financial advantages—seven millions is
the sum he reckons Southern Ireland
will ultimately have to play with—and
hinted that they might be further
stretched “if peace were offered to us
by any body which was qualified to
speak for Irish opinion.”
For a time little encouragement came
from the Irish Peers. Lord DUNRAVEN
moved the rejection of the Bill, on the
ground that there could never be per-
manent peace in Ireland until moderate
opinion was behind the law, and that
moderate opinion would not be satisfied
without full financial control. Lord
WILLough BY DE BROKE spoke as an
unrepentant Unionist, and Lord CLAN-
willLAM bluntly declared that the Irish
were one of those peoples who were
unfit to govern themselves and who
had got to be governed.
The Duke of ABERcoRN, as an Ulster-
man, supported the Bill, and Lord HAL-
DANE gave an elegant exhibition of the
military exercise known as “the balance
step without advancing.” It was not
the Bill he would have drafted, and the
Government must pass it on their own
responsibility. Still he thought it
should be given a chance.
In the Commons Sir ARCHIBALD
WILLIAMson gave an account of the re-
markable transmigrations of the Egypt-
ian G.H.Q., which within a few weeks
was located at the Savoy Hotel, the
Abbassiah Barracks and the Eden Hotel.
“Each move was made from motives
of economy.” Sir ALFRED Mond is
understood to be most anxious to know
how this game is played. He can
manage the first moves all right, but
never achieves a winning position.
Wednesday, November 24th.-Those
who were fortunate enough to hear
Wiscount GREY's speech on the Govern-
ment of Ireland Bill speak of it as on
a par with that which he delivered
as the spokesman of the nation on
August 3rd, 1914. To me it did not
appear quite so plain and coherent; but
who can be plain and coherent about
the Irish Question? Lord GREY thinks,
for example, that if the Government
made a more liberal offer to Nationalist
Ireland the pressure of moderate opinion
would put an end to murders and out-
rages. But how would that moderate
opinion be able to overcome the ter-
rorism of the secret societies, which, as
Lord BRYCE told the Peers, have dogged
every Irish patriotic movement since
the eighteenth century and which will
admit no compromise with the hated
invader?
The debate was neatly summarised
by Lord RIBBLESDALE, who said, “We
are all Home Rulers, but each of us
thinks the other fellow's brand is
wrong.”
The state of Ireland was at that
moment being debated in the Commons,
when Mr. Asquith found himself sad-
dled with the introduction of a motion
which, while nominally blaming the
Irish Executive, really accused the sol-
diers and police of attacking the lives
and property of innocent people. Tho
awkwardness of the situation was re-
flected in the terms of his indictment.
At one moment the charge was that
houses and creameries were destroyed
“without discrimination ” between in-
nocent and guilty; at the next the
House was asked to note “overwhelm-
ing evidence of organisation.” His
only suggestion for a remedy was that
we should get into touch with “the
real opinion of the great bulk of the
Irish people,” but he did not indicate
how it was to be done or what the
opinion would be when you got to it.
Sir HAMAR GREENwood is quite clear
that you won't get to it until you have
crushed the murder-gang which is ter-
rorising the great mass of the Southern
Irish people, not excluding “the intel-
lectual leaders of Sinn Fein.”
“The balance step without advancing.”
LoRD HALDANE.
Colonel John WARD cleverly re-
modelled the resolution into a vote of
thanks to the servants of the Crown in
Ireland for their courage and devotion,
and this was eventually adopted by 303
votes to 83.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
first time in its history the House of
Lords gave a Second Reading to a
Home #. Bill for Ireland. Up to
the very last the issue was in doubt,
for Lord MIDLEToN's motion that the
debate should be adjourned for a fort-
night, in order that a more generous
financial scheme might be produced,
attracted two classes of Peers—those
who are resigned to Home Rule, but
want a better brand, and those who
won't have it at any price or in any
shape.
On the steps of the Throne sat the
PRIME MINISTER, whose humility in
going no higher will doubtless receive
favourable comment in Welsh pulpits.
He was accompanied—I will not say
shepherded—by Sir HAMAR GREENwood
and Sir Edward CARson. What signals,
if any, passed between this triumvirate
and the Woolsack I cannot say, but
the fact remains that, after a brief chat
with the LoRD CHANCELLOR, Lord
CURzoN came down heavily against the
motion. An adjournment would be
useless unless it produced peace. But
could Lord MIDLETON guarantee that
even the most complete fiscal autonomy
would satisfy Sinn Fein 2 If later on,
when the Irish Parliaments were in
operation, a demand came from a united
Ireland, the Government would give it
friendly consideration. Lord MIDLE-
ToN's motion having been rejected by
eighty-six votes, and Lord DUNRAVEN's
by ninety, the Second Reading was
agreed to without a division.
In the Commons a final attempt to
defeat the Agricultural Bill was made
by the Farmers' Party. Mr. Court-
HoPE declared that the Bill would
produce only doubt and uncertainty,
whereas the farmer needed confidence,
a plant of slow growth (as we know on
the authority of another statesman),
which would not flourish under bureau-
cratic supervision. Sir F, BANBURY
said the measure must end in national-
isation, and he would prefer national-
isation—cum proper compensation, of
course—straight away. The surprising
statement by a Labour Member, that
the farmers had subsidised the nation
to the extent of forty millions a year
by selling at less than world-prices,
may have helped to placate their
champions, who had not quite realised
what generous fellows they were, for
only a dozen stalwarts carried their
protest into the Division Lobby.

IF Hansard would only introduce a
little brightness into its bald and un-
convincing narrative of Parliamentary
procedure it would provide reading-
matter which would grip the heart and
stir the emotions, winning many new

a sob-artist) on its staff. That is why

it reports a soul-stirring incident in the
following terms?—
“Mr. X. struck out, and unintention-
ally hit an hon. member (Mr. Y.),
who was sitting in close proximity.
Grave disorder having thus arisen, Mr.
Speaker rose and ordered the suspen-
sion of the sitting under Standing Order
No. 21.”
How differently the thing might have
been done if put into competent hands.
Would not something like the follow-
ing (though far short of perfection, we
admit) have been more acceptable to
the general reader?—
Mr. X's erstwhile florid face paled.
An ugly look invaded his features of
normally classic beauty. Flinging off
his braided morning - coat he flew
Parrying with his
right he brought his left well home
with a middle-and-off jab, tapping the
claret—a pretty blow, whose only defect
was that it struck the wrong face.
Other honourable Members hastened
to join the mélée. Pince-nez flew in
every direction, toupées were disar-
ranged, dental plates shook to their
very foundations. The opposition pack
worked well, displaying brilliant foot-
work, tackling low and dodging neatly
the dangerous cross-kicks of their
opponents. The heel-work, while above
the average, was too often below the
belt.
Meanwhile the only lady Member
present sat pale and bright-eyed, a silent
spectator. Her mind, working rapidly,
sensed animpending catastrophe. What
could she do to emphasise the woman's
point of view? At the sight of blood
she nerved herself with a supreme
effort to remain in her place. Then,
springing to action, she tore her dainty
handkerchief into strips with which to
provide the bandages which it seemed
would inevitably be needed.
At last silence reigned. The collar-
studs were collected from the floor of
the House and the few remaining
Members breathlessly awaited the re-
sumption of the sitting.
As the hon. Member apologised every
throat was dry, but most of the eyes
were moist. The gracious acceptance of
the apology moved strong men to weep
aloud until called to order. And there,
in the background, sat she whose
woman's wit had shown the better way.

PUNCH, OR THE
A SIXPENNY-BIT-PLAIN.
THE USES OF GESTURE.
ONE
PENNY—WITH APLOM.B.
“G.B.R.L.”
G.B.R.L.'s are an old - established
convention in my family. Joan and
Pauline (“Porgie" libentius audit) are
exceptional authorities on the animal
world in general; exceptional, at any
rate, for their years, which respectively
total four-spot-six and two-spot-five.
They confound their parents daily with
questions relating to the habits of mar-
mots or the language of kiwis. But
they never talk about “lions,” tout
court. A lion is, er-officio and ipso facto,
a Great-Big-Roarin'-Lion—always has
been : in short, a G.B.R.L.
It reminds me of a man I know who
was made a G.B.E.; but that's another
story, and Joan wouldn't see the joke
of it anyhow, though I know she would
smile politely.
But in this matter of lions, from which
I am tending to digress, the old G.B.R.
convention has just been weighed in the
balance and found wanting. It came
about in this wise. Joan's and Porgie's
Uncle Barney (his nose is rétroussé, if
anything, only he had the misfortune
to be born on St. Barnabas' Day) de-
parted the other day for Afric's sunny
shores—for Algiers, in fact—to nurse a
tedious trench legacy. This, of course,
was a matter of great concern to his
nieces, in whose eyes he is distinctly
persona grata, owing to his command
of persiflage and taste in confectionery.
I went into the nursery on the fateful
morning to break the sad news. My
daughters were at breakfast and I was
just in time to hear Joan's grace, “Thank
God for our b'ekfas'—and do make us
good.” The extremely sanctimonious
tone in which this was delivered, com-
bined with the melodramatic scowl
which marred the usual serenity of
|Porgie's countenance, convinced me
that the morning had commenced in-
auspiciously and that it would be well
to gild the pill which I had to ad-
minister.
“Hallo, stout women,” I said cheer-
fully. Joan looked politely bored but
made no reply.
“Not 'tout winnmin,” said Porgie
heavily and uncompromisingly. Ob-
viously it was too early in the day for
any of that sparkling back-chat for
which my daughters are so justly
famed. So I got down to hard tacks
at once.
“Your Uncle Barney,” I said, “is
going to Algiers to-day.”
I explained that Algiers was in Africa,
where the black men come from. Joan
was mildly intrigued. She opined that
her Uncle Barney would follow the
local customs (as she understood them)
and wear no clothes. I said I doubted
if his medical adviser would approve of
his carrying international courtesy to
such an extreme. Joan was frankly dis-
appointed. So I tried again.
“I expect he'll see some lions in
Africa,” I suggested.
Joan's interest revived. “Great-big-
roarin’-lions,” she corrected me. Porgie
expressed herself, as usual, in precisely
similar terms. -
“Yes,” I said feelingly, “great big
roarers. I expect they'll eat him up
quite soon.”
Joan looked deeply concerned at this
callous prediction, and the corners of
Porgie's mouth drooped ominously.
“I don't like roarin' lions,” said Joan.
“Don’t nike roarin’ nions,” said
Porgie.
“Are they in cages?” suggested Joan
hopefully. This was an excellent idea.
“Of course they are,” I said with
great heartiness.
Joan was not satisfied. “Will they
roar when they see Uncle Barney 2"
she inquired.
This gave me my chance most unex-
pectedly. “I should just think they
will,” I said. “If they see him dressed
like your black men, they'll roar till
the tears pour down their cheeks.”
“I’spect they'd be laughing at him,”
said Joan, gracefully helping me out.
“I 'spect so,” I replied.
“I see,” said Joan comfortably.
“I see,” said Porgie.

KNowING that there was everything
in my appearance to command respect,
I went into the manager's room with
confidence. Lean and brown and middle-
aged, in a tweed coat and grey flannel
trousers, which, though not new, were
well cut, I felt that I looked like one
accustomed to put in and take out sums
from banks. There was no trying for
effect, no effort, no tie-pin. The stick
I carried was a plain ash. The pipe,
which I removed from my mouth, had
no silver mounting. Ah, but it showed
the tiny mother-of-pearl star which
stamped it as a Bungknoll. There was
going to be no difficulty here.
“Good morning,” I said. “I regret
to trouble a busy man over a small
matter, but I wish to cash a cheque
for ten pounds.”
He was a quiet, capable-looking man
with a rather tired expression.
“The cashing of cheques,” he said,
laying down his pipe, “is one item of
our duties.”
“Unfortunately,” I continued, “I
have run short of money. I bought a
rather good print in a shop down the
road and it has left me without any. I
can give a cheque on Bilson's, but the
banks in town close to-morrow and it
would mean waiting three days, so I
hope that you will be able to --
“You can bring someone to identify
you, of course 2" he said, reaching for
a bell.
“I am sorry to say that I am unknown
here. I am all right at the hotel,
but I don't like to ask the people for
money. I have brought only a small
bag, and what with the races and so
forth I might expose myself to a dis-
agreeable refusal.”
“Yes,” he said, “you might. But
I'm afraid I can't cash a cheque for
you without an identification. I'll send
it for collection if you like.”
“But that means waiting for days,
and I haven't a shilling left. I came
here for a week to look at the country
about your town — a beautiful little
town.” I added this diplomatically.
“Do you think so 2 I consider it a
hole. But I don't know much about it
as I'm only here for a week. However,
I'm sorry I can't help you except in
the way I mentioned.”

but it was the one from Mosbyson's

applied twice for payment—“but letters

“Let it go, It's probably a fake.”
“Which one?” I said hotly. “The

“Both. But I can't cash your cheque.”
“But look at the mess I'll be in.
Would you have me pawn my watch?”
“I would not ; neither would I have
you not do so, if you take my meaning.”
“I see,” I said bitterly. “In plain
words you are indifferent to my fate.”
He smiled slightly and reached for a
match to re-light his pipe.
My blood was up. I would not be
defied by this man; at least, not com-
pletely. “Wery well,” I said coldly, “I
will leave my cheque for ten pounds
with you and take only a couple on
account.”
“I couldn't do that either.”
“Well, a pound will have to do then.”
“ No.”
“Then,” I said in despair, “we come

eighteenpence. Ha, ha!”
“And that,” he answered, “would
be equally objectionable.”
I started. “Come,” I said, “you are
| human after all. You can quote at
| random from DICKENs. You read him?”
“I do. When not engaged in busi-
ness pursuits.” He looked anxiously
at the clock.

asked sternly.
“She kept a shop.

“Whom did Mr. Wopsle marry?”
“Nobody. But hadn't you better see

“Not yet. How many glasses of

“Depends on how you count them.
I make it eight.”
“Correct. Look here—have you
thought about the bagman's story—the
first one? He says it is eighty years
since the events he relates took place,
and that would carry it back to 1747.
And yet the traveller damns his straps
and whiskers. Why, if he'd worn
strapped trousers and whiskers in those
days he'd have had a mob after him.”
“Yes, and he wouldn't have been
driving a gig on Marlborough downs.
He'd have been riding with pistols in
his holsters, wrapped in a horseman's
cloak and wearing a plain bobwig.
I've thought of that too.”
“I see you have. But there 's
another—”
“Let me. Can you account for this?
Martin Chuzzlewit left Mr. Pecksniff's

place which is identified as the original
site of Cairo, Illinois—say another

the end of February, when everything
is frozen stiff. But they travelled down

thing it touched.”
“No,” I said jealously, “I have not
thought of that. Wonderful, isn't it,

“I'd like to very much. Thanks.
I'll come.”
“I’ve thought of two more,” I said;
“but I'll go now, as you must be busy,
so good-bye for the present. A bit
before eight.”

the bell. “Oh, Mr. Jounce,” he said to

[DECEMBER 1, 1920.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN UNLIKELY STORY.
I AM hoping very much that this
story will, as Agony Column advertise-
ments put it, meet the eye of a certain
Professor at a certain Academy of Music.
Of course I might tell it to him myself,
as he happens to be my Professor, at
least from 7 to 7.45 on Friday even-
ings; but it is a story which involves a
great deal of explanation and, well—
things on the whole get believed better
in print.
To be quite frank I did begin telling
him at the time, but I saw that the
first two words had destroyed his faith
in the rest of it. I don't really blame
him, for it began with “my cleaner,”
and I don't suppose that he has the
ghost of an idea that, if you teach
cooking, as I do, under the London
County Council, they kindly keep a
charlady to wash up for you and so on,
and they call her a “cleaner.”
The Professor is a very bad listener.
I might have managed to explain to
him what a cleaner is, but I never could
have made him see why she was having
tea with me, so I gave it up.
Really it is so simple. She lives at
Cambridge Heath; I live at Croydon,
which doesn't sound as countrified
but is really so much nicer that no
Croydon people who knew Cambridge
Heathers could help asking them to
tea at least once a year, when the
garden was at its best. My cleaner's
visit is always very delightful, because
she makes the garden seem at least
four times its usual size by sheer ad-
miration ; but this year, just as she
was getting into her stride, it began to
rain, and we had to seek refuge by the
piano.
We sang “Where the Bee Sucks”
and “Annie Laurie” very successfully,
and she at last unthawed to the extent
of remarking that she would give us a
“chune,” though she “hadn't stood up.”
to sing by herself “for donkey's ears.”
Stipulating that someone should help
her out if the need arose, she investi-
gated the inside of the piano-stool where
the music lives, looking for a suitable
song, and made, to her horror, the dis-
covery that among all the odd pages it
contained there was not one that had
ever adhered to a piece called “The
Maxeema,” nor yet to a song which
asks how someone is “Goin' to kee
'em down on the farm now they've
seen gay Paree?”
The painful incident was passed over
at the time, “The Long Trail” being
discovered at the bottom of the pile
and satisfactorily negotiated, and I
forgot all about it until the next Friday
evening, when, just as I was about to
shake the dust of Cambridge Heath off
my shoes, my cleaner, rising from her
scrubbing, wiped her hands on her
apron, produced two large limp sheets
of white paper which resolved them-
selves into the music I ought to have
had and hadn't, and pressed them upon
me with all the eagerness of a more
than cheerful giver.
A kind of panic seized me, for on
Friday evenings I make the Academy of
Music as it were a half-way house on
my way home. Under the cleaner's
kind and beaming glance there was
nothing to do but put them into the
attaché case in which I carry my music
and try to believe that, wonderful man
as he is, even my Professor wouldn't
be able to see inside it when it was
shut, in fact that it only rested with
me to be quite sure that in his presence
I only took out Chopin and not the
gentleman who was interested in farm-
1ng. -
And I managed nicely. I took out
the “Nocturnes” and shut the case up
again before the cleverest (and nicest)
of Professors could have guessed the
company they were keeping, and he
was graciously pleased to nod, instead
of shaking his head, for most of the
three-quarters of an hour. He really
must have been pleased with me, for
at 7.45 he told me that I showed
marked improvement, and then kept
me till 7.49 while he explained that a
flair for the best of music such as I ex-
hibited was both uncommon and, from
a Professor's point of yiew, exceed-
ing enjoyable. At 7.50—he, benign, I
blushful—we approached the attaché-
CaSe. -
“Allow me,” said my Professor,
reaching for it to replace Chopin; but
I snatched it up before he could get it. ||
Like most truly great men he is a
little absent-minded, and he didn't seem
to notice anything, but just held out his
hand in farewell. But when my Pro-
fessor shakes hands it means more than
that; it means benediction, recognition,
salutation—lots of things; for it is
rumoured at the Academy that he never
bestows that honour on any save those
whom he regards as kindred spirits,
acolytes at the altar of Music, per-
sonalities, not pupils.
And then my attaché-case opened
itself quietly, after the manner of
attaché-cases, and laid “’Ow're you
goin' to keep'em?” and “The Maxeema”
right side up, and their names in such
large print too, like an offering at his
wonderful feet. Trembling at the knees
I said:—
“My cleaner gave them to me.”
But he looked at me and went on
looking, and that is why I hope so very
much that he will read this very un-
likely story.

On a most inadequate stipend,
Up in an attic and worn and spent
And wondering how to pay my rent,
And sucking an old clay pipe end,
I'd write to BonAR and Mr. GEORGE,
Or the party Whips that ran 'em,
“ Unless you want me to steal or forge
You must make those Treasury blokes

From AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN's taxes,
For the glory withers that used to be

As the cost of everything waxes.

Equally crave the shilling

In a concord wholly hearty,
Wanting to know if the State will give
An adequate wage upon which to live,
And so does the National Party.
“And the boots of the Labour Members
creak
And a terrible ghastly pallor is
On the Wee Free face as it tries to
speak;
But ah! what a change to each sunken
cheek - -
If you put a bit more on our salaries'
“Shibboleths old to the wind we'd fling
And turn to the task that presses;
Sound reforms would go with a swin
And we might have a chance of length-
ening
Those fearfully short recesses.
“There'd be the chance to show your
tact - -
In welding the hostile sections;
Sworn and sealed in a mighty pact
We'd put on the books the world's best
Act
Abolishing all elections.” Evoe.
* This beautiful opening line is not original.
It is borrowed, with due acknowledgments,
from a once famous music-hall song.
From an article on “History with-
out Tears ”:—
“There is no book that gives one a more
comprehensive idea of the character of the
Byzantine Empire, of the reasons for its decline
and its disappearance, than Scott's ‘Count
Robert of Sicily.'"
Except perhaps Wrongfellow's “King
Robert of Paris.”

I'LL Go IN A HARD HAT NEXT TIME, THough.
A FELLow CAME UP TO ME AT THE MEET AND
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A NEw novel by ANTHoNY HoPE certainly deserves in
these days to be considered a literary event of some im-
portance. His Lucinda (HUTCHINSoN) seems to me both
in plot and treatment equal to the best of his work; as
dignified and yet as lightly handled as anything he has
given us in the past. The plot (which I must not betray)
is excellent. From the moment when Julius, the narrator,
making his leisurely way to the wedding of Lucinda, is
passed by her alone in a taxicab going in an opposite
direction, the interest of the intrigue never slackens. Into
an epoch of rather “over-ripe” and messy fiction this
essentially clean and well-ordered tale comes with an effect
very refreshing and tonic. ANTHONY HoPE's characters
as ever are vigorously alive; in Lucinda herself he has
drawn a heroine as charming as any in that long gallery
that now stretches between her and the immortal Dolly.
In short, those novel-readers who are (shall I say?) begin-
ning to demand the respect due to middle age will enjoy in
these pages the threefold reward of present interest, retro-
spection and a comforting sense that the literary judgment
of their generation is here triumphantly vindicated in the
eyes of unbelieving youth. What could be more pleasant 2
It is a delight to welcome the Life of Mrs. R. L.
Stevenson (CHATTo AND WINDUs), not only for the excep-
tional attraction of the environment in which she lived
for many years, but because under any circumstances she
would have been a remarkable woman. Once, when asked
to write her own life, she refused because it seemed to her
like “a dazed rush on a railroad express; ” she despaired
of recovering “the incidental memories.” So it fell to her
sister, Mrs. WAN DE GRIFT SANCHEz, to undertake the task.
A difficult one, for there was always the fear that the per-
sonality of Mrs. STEveNsoN might seem to be overshadowed
by that of her husband. But the author, in giving us many
interesting details about Robert Louis STEVENsoN, has been
careful to select for the most part only those in which his
wife was closely concerned. “In my sister's character,”
she writes, “there were many strange contradictions, and
I think sometimes this was a part of her attraction, for
even after knowing her for years one could always count
on some surprise, some unexpected contrast which went far
in making up her fascinating personality.” Contradictions
undoubtedly were to be found in her; thus during her
later years Mrs. STEVENsoN intensely desired quietness and
peace, and yet her love for change of scene never seemed
to abate; but she was constant in her devotion as a wife and
in her staunchness as a friend. Some excellent illustrations
are included in this volume, and the only fault I have to
find with it is that it lacks an index.
In selecting his hero for No Defence (HopDER AND
Stoughton) from the mutineers at the Nore, it may be
admitted that Sir GILBERT PARKER displayed a certain
originality. With regard to the clou of his plot, however,
I can hardly say so much. Melodramatic young lovers
have (in fiction) gone to prison and worse rather than
employ a defence involving distress to the ladies of their
choice, from ages untold. Dyck Calhoon did it when he was

wrongly indicted for the killing of Erris Boyne, who was a
traitor in the pay of France and incidentally the father of
the heroine Sheila; though she knew nothing of this and
would have been badly worried if the hazards of a defended
murder case had brought it to light. Do you call the
motive sufficient 2 No more do I. However, Dyck goes
to prison, emerging just in time to join the fleet and
became a successful rebel under the Naval soviets esta-
blished by RICHARD PARKER. Subsequently he takes his
ship into action on the legitimate side, earns the quasi-
ardon of exile on parole in Jamaica, finds a fortune of
§. treasure, quells a black rising, is cleared of the
murder charge (by the wholly preposterous arrival in the
island of the now aged lady who had really done the deed
—exactly like the finale of a GILBERT and SULLIVAN opera)
SELMA LAGERLöF, whose great novel, Gosta Berling, was
awarded the Nöbel Prize, and the Norwegian, KNUT
HAMsuN, whose extremely unpleasant book, Hunger, was
published in this country a score of years ago, few if any of
them have been made accessible to the average English
reader. Now the Gyldendal Publishing Company of Copen-
hagen has undertaken the neglected task of producing
English translations of the best Scandinavian fiction, the
latest of which is Guest the One-Eyed, by the Icelandic
novelist, GUNNAR GUNNARSSON. It is not a particularly
powerful narrative, and is marked by the characteristic
inconsequence that tends to convert the Scandinavian novel
into a mélange of family biographies; yet the author has
been successful in weaving into his chapters some of the
beauty and magic of his native land, lovely and forbidding
by turns, and the charm and simplicity of its people. So
and marries the heroine. A breathless plot, by which,
however, my own pulse re- - *__
mained unquickened. To
be brutally frank, indeed,
the telling seemed to me
wholly lacking in precisely
the qualities of dash and
crescendo required to carry
off such a tale. Costume ro-
mance that halts and looks
backward soon loses my
following.

when he makes Ormarr

strenuous work of ten years
and a promising career as a
great violinist to return to
a pastoral life on his father's

seems neither strange nor
unnatural. So with the per-
fectly villainous Sera Ketill,
who at the culmination of
unparalleled infamies sud-
denly repents and becomes
the far-wandering and well-
beloved Guest, we do not
feel anything strained in the

cularly well arranged (it contains quite a lot of repetitions and
a system of punctuation all its own), but it is of more than
average interest. The author details the training of war-dogs
—literally “all done by kindness"—and records many thrill-
ing exploits and heroisms of his friends. Further, he states
at some length some rather attractive views on dog meta-
physics, of which one need say no more than that, if you
wish to believe that your four-footed pal has a soul to be
saved as well as a body to be patted, here is high authority
to support you. I think what one misses all through these
pages is the dog's own story. Without it one never seems
to get quite to grips with the subject. What were Major's
thoughts and feelings, for instance, when carrying a message

five years produced novel-writers of power and distinction,
but with the single exception of the Swedish authoress,

The question is answered by Mr. DENIs MACKAIL's What
Nect 2 (John MURRAY), which on examination turns out to
be a farcical novel. The story has certain technical weak-
messes, but these are forgotten in the excitements of the
chase, for the main theme is the tracking down of a coarse
capitalist who defrauded the hero of his fortune and did
something very low against England. With the assistance
of a new character in fiction, a super-valet, justice is done
and we are all (except the coarse capitalist and his son)
extremely happy. Mr. MACRAIL has invented some excellent
scenes and he carries them off with gaiety and spirit. In his
second book (and for the answer to What Nert 2 we shall
not, I imagine, have long to wait) he will amend certain
little faults, not the least of which is a tendency to give us
the most significant events in the form of retrospective nar-
rative instead of letting us see them as they occur.

THE DARK AGES.
(Being reflections on the pre-press period.)
[In The Times of December 2nd Lord NorthcLIFFE traces the
history of the English Press from the appearance of the first news:
paper uttered in English—“A Corrant out of Germany," imprinted
at Amsterdam, December 2nd, 1620–and finds some difficulty in
understanding how civilisation got on as well as it did through all
those preceding centuries.]
To-DAY (December 2) we keep, with cheers,
The Tercentenary of the Press!
Probing the darkness of the previous years
I try, but try in vain, to guess
How anybody lived before the birth
Of this the Very Greatest Thing on Earth.
You'd say it must have been a savage life.
Men were content to eat and drink
And spend the intervals in carnal strife
With none to teach them how to think;
They had no Vision and their minds were dense,
Largely for lack of True “Intelligence.”
When a volcano burst or floods occurred
No correspondent flashed the news;
It came by rumour or a little bird,
Devoid of editorial views;
No leader let them know to what extent
The blame should lie upon the Government.
And yet, when no one knew in those dumb days
Exactly what was going on,
Without reporters they contrived to raise
The Pyramids and Parthenon;
CoNFUcIUs preached the Truth, and so did PAUL,
Though neither of them got in print at all.
It sounds incredible that, when in Greece
The poets sang to lyre or pipe,
When HoMER (say) threw off his little piece,
Nobody put the thing in type;
Even in days less barbarously rude
VIRGIL, it seems, was never interviewed.
And how did DANTE manage to indite
His atimirable tale of Hell,
Or BUoNARRoti sculp his sombre “Night”
Without the kodak's magic spell—
No Press-photographer, a dream of tact,
To snap the artist in the very act?
Poor primitives, who groped amid the gloom
And perished ere the dawn of day,
Ere yet Publicity, with piercing boom,
Had shown the world a better way;
Before the age—so good for him that climbs—
Now culminating in the NorthcLIFFE times.
O. S.
How to Brighten the Weather Forecasts.
“Mild and hazy conditions with increasing haze and cloudiness for
an unfavourable change in the weather of heliotrope georgette over
pale blue.”—New Zealand Paper.
We commend this to our own Meteorological Office.
Of the Bishop-designate of Manchester:-
“Head master of an important public school while yet in his
teens . . . a permanent figure in social and religious movements . . .
the author of ‘Men's Creatrix.’”—Provincial Paper.
We knew Canon TEMPLE had had a remarkable career, but
confess that these details had hitherto escaped us.
OUR LUCKY DIPPERS.
FURTHER and final particulars of the drawings from the
Lucky Bag at the Purple City are replete with illustra-
tions of the extraordinary congruity between the prizes and
the age, sex and station of the recipients.
Mrs. Sarah Boakes, who received the colossal equestrian
bronze statue of Lord THANET, weighing three hundred tons
and valued at five thousand guineas, told our representative
that the idea of getting one of the big prizes never entered
into her head, and added, “I did not sleep a wink last
night; the statue was in my mind the whole time.” Mrs.
Boakes, an attractive elderly lady of some seventy-five
summers, is engaged at a laundry at East Putney. The
haulage of the statue to her home at 129, Arabella Road,
S.W. 15, is likely to be a costly affair; but Mrs. Boakes has
made an application for a grant-in-aid to the Ministry of
Health and has received a sympathetic reply from Dr.
ADDIsoN. The cost of reconstructing her house to enable
the statue to be set up in her parlour is estimated at about
£4,500.
Mr. Jolyon Forsyth, who won the African elephant, is
a stoker on the South Western Railway and lives at Wor-
plesdon. He applied to the Company for a day's leave in
order to ride his prize home; but his request was most
unwarrantably refused, and the matter is receiving the
earnest attention of the N.U.R. Mr. Forsyth informed our
representative that his wife keeps a small poultry run, and
hopes that she will be able to make room for the new visitor
without seriously incommoding her fowls. Failing that, he
thinks that employment may be found for the elephant on
the Worplesdon Links, either in rolling the greens or
irrigating them with its trunk. The claims of the animal
to an unemployment allowance are being considered by
Dr. MACNAMARA.
Gladys Gilkes, a bright-eyed child of six, living with her
parents at 345, Beaverbrook Avenue, Harringay, who re-
ceived a Sandringham opera-hat, is enduring her felicity
with fortitude. “I have never been to the opera yet,” she
naïvely remarked to our representative, “but my brother
Bert plays beautifułly on the concertina.”
Great interest has been excited in the neighbourhood of
Tulse Hill by the success of Mr. Enoch Pegler, the winner of
the three-manual electric cathedral organ with sixty-four
stops, the most sonorous instrument of its type yet con-
structed by Messrs. Waghorn and Fogg, the famous organ-
builders of Penge. A special piquancy is lent to the episode
by the fact that Mr. Pegler, who is seventy-nine years of age
and has long been a martyr to rheumatoid arthritis in both
hands, belongs to the sect of the Silentiary Tolstoyans,
who discountenance all music, whether sacred or profane.
Mr. Pegler, it should be explained, authorised his grandniece,
Miss. Hiester Wigglesworth, to put in for the Lucky Bag
in his name, but, on the advice of the family physician, Dr.
Parry Gorwick, the result has not yet been broken to him.
Meanwhile, thanks to the tactful intervention of Sir ERIC
GEDDEs, the instrument has been temporarily housed in the
Zoological Gardens, where daily recitals are given at meal-
times by Dr. CHALMERs MitchELL and other powerful exe-
cutants. Unfortunately the organ was not yet installed at
the time of the recent encounter between a lion and a tigress,
otherwise the fatality would, in the opinion of Sir FREDERICK
BRIDGE, have almost certainly been avoided.
When that my Judith sticks her slender nose
In things whereon a lass doth ill to trench,
An ever-widening breach my fancy shows,
For this is but the thin end of the wench.

UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.
V.—THE SIzzles.
I CANNot help it, but this article has
got to begin with a short historical
disquisition. Many people are puzzled
to know why Lord HUGH CECIL wears
that worried look, and why Lord Robert
also looks so sad. Yet the explanation
is simple enough. It is because nobody
can pronounce their surname. “Cessil,”
says the man in the street (and being
in a street is a thing that may happen
to anybody) as he sees the gaunt care-
worn figures going by. And when they
hear it the sensitive ear of the CECILs
is wrung with torture at the sound.
They wince. They would like to button-
hole the man in the street and explain
to him, like the Ancient Mariner, all
about David Cyssell, the founder of
their line. David Cyssell, it seems,
though he didn't quite catch the Nor-
man Conquest and missed the Crusades,
and was a little bit late for the Wars
of the Roses, was nicely in time to get
a place in the train of HENRY WIII.,
which was quite early enough for a
young man who firmly intended to be
an ancestor. When he died his last
words were, “Rule England, my boys,
but never never, never let the people
call you ‘Cessil,'” and his sons obeyed
him dutifully by becoming Earls and
Marquises and all that kind of thing,
so that the trouble did not arise.
But, of course, if you don't happen
to be the eldest son, the danger is still
there. And it is this danger which has
led Lord HUGH CECIL to withdraw
himself more and more into the com-
pany of ecclesiastical dignitaries, who
are accustomed to pronounce quite hard
words, like chrysoprasus and Abednego
without turning a hair, if they have one,
and Lord Robert CECIL to confine his
attention to the League of Nations,
where all the people are foreigners and
much too ignorant to pronounce any
English name at all.
Personally I hold that, if it were not
for this trouble about hearing their name
said all wrong by people on omnibuses
and even shouted all wrong by news-
paper sellers, one of the CECILs might
become Prime Minister some day. As
it is they wear a look of sorrowful
martyrdom, as if they were perfectly
ready for the nearest stake; and this
look, combined with their peculiar sur-
name, has caused them to be not in-
aptly known as The Sizzles. How very
much better would it have been, my
dear reader, if their great ancestor had
been simply called “David,” so that
they could have had a sunny smile and
not so many convictions.
It is customary in speaking of the
Sizzles to include some mention of their
more famous relative, Mr. ARTHUR BAL-
Four. Very well, then.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
Author. Why, you don't mean to say
there are two ARTHUR BALFou Rs, do
ou?
Editor. I do.
Author. Aren't you thinking of the
two WINSTON CHURCHILLs?
Editor. No, I'm not.
Author. Well, perhaps I'd better
begin again.
Mr. ARTHUR BALFow It.
Born, as one might say, with a silver
niblick in his mouth and possessed of
phenomenal intellectual attainments,
Mr. ARTHUR BALFour (the one on the
other page) was not long in settling
down to his main life-work, which has
been the laying out of University golf
curricula.
[Is that better?—Editor. Much.]
In spite of this preoccupation he
has found time for a remarkable num-
ber of hobbies, such as politics, music
and the study of refrigerating maçhines,
though the effect of all these various
activities is sometimes a little confusing
for those with whom he works. When
consulted on a burning topic of the
hour he may, for instance, be on the
oint of inventing a new type of ice-
bucket, so that the interviewer is forced
to go out quickly and fetch his fur
overcoat before he can talk in comfort.
Or he may be playing, like Sherlock
Holmes, on his violin, and say, “Just
wait till I've finished this sonata.”
And by the time it's finished the
bother about Persia or Free Trade is
quite. forgotten. Or, again, Mr. BAL-
Four may be closeted with Professor
WARDON, Doctor RAY or Vice-Chancellor
MITCHELL at the very moment when
the Nicaraguan envoy is clamouring at
the door.
It is for this reason that Mr. ARTHUR
BALFour has sometimes been called
Mr. Arthur Baffler. Puzzling, however,
though he may be in many of his poli-
tical manifestations, his writings are
like a beacon in the gloom, and some
day these simple chatty little booklets
will surely gain the wide public which
they deserve. “The Foundation of
Bunkers,” “A Defence of Philosophic
Divots” and “Wood - wind and Bras-
sies” should be read by all who are
interested in belles lettres. And his
latest volume of essays deals, I believe,
with subjects so widely diverse and yet
so enthralling as “Booty and the Cri-
ticism of Booty,” “Trotsky's View of
Russian World Policy,” “Quizzical Re-
search'' and “The Freedom of the Tees.”
The real pity is that with all his
many and wonderful gifts Mr. ARTHUR
BALFour has never felt the fiery enthu-
siasm of his Hatfield cousins. He re-
mains, in fact, a salamander among
the Sizzles. K.

against this sadly undemocratic and obscur-
antist doctrine.]
IN days of old, when writers bold
Betrayed the least disparity
Between their genius and an age
When frankness was a rarity,
An odious word was often heard
From critics void of charity,
Simplicity or clarity,
Or vision or hilarity,
Who used to slate or deprecate
The vices of vulgarity.
But now disdain is wholly slain
By wide familiarity
Which links the unit with his age
In massive solidarity;
No more the word is used or heard,
No, no, we call it charity,
Simplicity or clarity,
Or vision or hilarity,
But never slate or deprecate
The virtues of vulgarity.

PRISCILLA PLAYS FAIRIES.
UNREHEARSED dramatic dialogue
comes quite easily to some people, and
so does a knowledge of the ways of the
fairy world, but I am not one of those
people. Also I was supposed to have
a headache that afternoon and to be
recovering from a severe cold. Also I
was reading a very exciting book. I
cannot help thinking therefore that the
fairy Bluebell was taking a mean ad-
vantage of my numerous disabilities in
appearing at all. She rattled the handle
of the door a long time, and when I had
opened it came in by a series of little
skips on her toes, accompanied by wag-
glings of the arms rather in the fashion

the sofa is where the Fairy Bluebell
lived, and I built her a little home with
flowers, and these cushions were the
flowers, and (rather basely) she went
to sleep in it 2
She (with sparkling eyes). Yes, yes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WHITE SPAT.
WHEN it is remembered how large a
part has been played in history by
revolutionary and political songs it is
both lamentable and strange that at
the present time only one of the num-
erous political faiths has a hymn of its
own—“The Red Flag.” The author
of the words owes a good deal, I should
say, to the author of “Rule Britannia,”
though I am inclined to think he has
gone one better. The tune is that
gentle old tune which we used to know
as “Maryland,” and by itself it rather
suggests a number of tired sheep wait-
ing to go through a gate than a lot
of people thinking very redly. I fancy
the author realised this, and he has got
over it by putting in some good power-
ful words like “scarlet,” “traitors,”
“flinch " and “dungeon,” whenever
the tune is particularly sheepish. The
effect is effective. Just imagine if the
Middle Classes Union could march
down the middle of the Strand singing
that fine chorus:–
“Then raise the scarlet standard high,
Beneath its shade we’ll live and die;
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer
We'll keep the Red Flag flying here.”
Well, I have set myself to supply
some of the other parties with songs,
and I have begun with “The White
Spat," which is to be the party-hymn
of the High Tories (if any). I have
written it to the same tune as “The Red
Flag,” because, when the lion finally
does lie down with the lamb, it will
be much more convenient if they can
bleat and roar in the same metre, and
I shall hope to hear Mr. Robert
WILLIAMs and Lord Robert CECIL
singing these two songs at once one
day. am not wholly satisfied with
“The White Spat,” but I think I have
caught the true spirit, or, at any
rate, the proper inconsequence of these
things:—
THE WHITE SPAT.
Air—Maryland.
The spats we wear are pure as snow.—
We are so careful where we go;
We don't go near the vulgar bus
Because it always splashes us.
Chorus. We take the road with trustful hearts,
Avoiding all the messy parts;
However dirty you may get
We'll keep the White Spat spotless
yet.
At night there shines a special star
To show us where the puddles are;
The crossing-sweeper sweeps the floor–
That's what the crossing-sweeper's for.
Chorus. Then take the road, etc., etc.
I know it doesn't look much, just
written down on paper; but you try
singing it and you'll find you're carried
away.
Of course there ought to be an inter-
national verse, but I'm afraid I can't
compete with the one in my model:—
“Look round: the Frenchman loves its
blaze,
The sturdy German chants its praise;
In Moscow's vaults its hymns are sung;
Chicago swells the surging throng.”
This is the best I can do:-
From Russia's snows to Afric's sun
The race of spatriots is one;
One faith unites their alien blood–
“There's nothing to be said for mud.”
Now we have the song of the Wee
Frees. I wanted this to be rather pa-
thetic, but I'm not sure that I haven't
overdone it. The symbolism, though,
is well-nigh perfect, and, after all, the
symbolism is the chief thing. This goes
to the tune of “Annie Laurie”:—
THE OLD BLACK BROLLY.
Air—Annie Laurie.
Under the Old Umbrella,
Beneath the leaking gamp,
Wrapped up in woolly phrases
We battle with the damp.
Come, gather round the gamp !
Observe, it is pre-war;
And beneath the old Black Brolly
There's room for several more.
Shameless calumniators
Calumniate like mad;
Detractors keep detracting;
It really is too bad;
It really is too bad.
To show we're not quite dead,
We wave the old Black Brolly
And hit them on the head.
Then we have the National Party.
I am rather vague about the National
Party, but I know they are frightfully
military, and they keep on having Mass
Rallies in Kensington—complete with
drums, I expect. Where all the masses
come from I don't quite know, as a
prolonged search has failed to reveal
anyone who knows anyone who is
actually a member of the party. Every-
body tells me, though, that there is at
least one Brigadier-General (Tempy.)
mixed up with it, if not two, and at
least one Lord, though possibly one of
the Brigadiers is the same as the Lord;
but after all they represent the Nation,
so they ought to have a song. They
have nothing but “Rule Britannia”
now, I suppose.
Their song goes to the tune of “The
British Grenadiers.” I have written it
as a duet, but no doubt other parts
could be added if the occasion should
ever arise.
THE NATIONAL.
Air—The British Grenadiers.
Some talk of Coalitions,
Of Tories and all that ;
They are but cheap editions
Of the one and only Nat. ;
Our Party has no equals,
Though of course it has its peers,
With a tow, row, row, row, row, row,
For the British Brigadiers.
You have no idea how difficult it
is to write down the right number of
rows first time; however I daresay the
General wouldn't mind a few extra
Ones.
We represent the Nation
As no one else can do;
Without exaggeration
Our membership is two.
We rally in our masses
And give three hearty cheers,
With a tow, row, row, row, row, row
For the National Brigadiers.
There could be a great deal more of
that, but perhaps you have had enough.
Of course, if you don't think the
poetry of my songs is good enough, I
shall just have to quote some of “The
International" words to show you that
it's the tune that matters.
Here you are:—
“Arise! ye starvelings from your slumbers,
Arise | ye criminals of want,
For reason in revolt now thunders,
And at last ends the age of cant."
If people can get excited singing that,
my songs would send them crazy.
Then there is the Coalition. I have
had a good deal of difficulty about this,
but I think that at last I have hit the
right note; all my first efforts were too
dignified. This goes to a darkie tune:–
THE PIEBALD MARE.
Air—Camptown Ladies.
Down-town darkies all declare,
Doo-dah, doo-dah, -
There never was a hoss like the piebald
mare,
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
One half dark and the other half pale,
Doo-dah, doo-dah,
Two fat heads and a great big tail,
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
Chorus. Gwine to run all night,
Gwine to run all day !
I put my money on the piebald
In are
Because she run both way.
Little old DAVE he ride dat hoss,
Doo-dah, doo-dah,
Where'll she be if he takes a toss?
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
De people try to push him off,
Doo-dah, doo-dah,
De more dey push de more he scoff,
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
Chorus. Gwine to run, &c.
Over the largest fence they bound,
Doo-dah, doo-dah, -
Things exploding all around,
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
One fine day dat hoss will burst,
Doo-dah, doo-dah,
But little old DAvi; he'll walk in first,
Doo-dah, doo-dah day !
Chorus. Gwine to run, &c.
Once again, merely written down,
the words do not thrill, but I hope none
of the parties will definitely reject these
hymns till they have heard them actu-
ally sung; if necessary I will give a
trial rendering myself. -

ing charades and had to act L, we

and the people who were acting the
Coalition sang the above song with
really wonderful effect. It is true that
the other side thought we were acting

that must have been because of some-

QUESTIONS.
How did mankind get to all corners
of the earth 2 and what is the cause of
exploding suns? These are among the
questions put by Professor A. W. Bick-
ERTON, of the London Astronomical
Society, and they would be solved, it
seems, if our learned men would only
band themselves together. I have no
wish to hamper the good work, but a
moment's reflection suggests a number
of other questions simply asking to be
answered.
For instance, what happens when an
irresistible force meets Sir ERIC GEDDEs?
And why is it that while we hear of
thousands of people losing their um-
brellas we have never yet heard of a
single casewherea man openly admitted
that he had found one 2
And is there any reason why the
modern novel should not end happily,
instead of the hero and heroine always
marrying at the last moment.
And how does it happen that Thanet
is the best holiday-place in this country
and enjoys more sunshine than any
other resort 2
And could not The Daily Mail ex-
tend the same sunshine privilege to
other parts?
And what makes a music-hall audi-
ence laugh when a comedian changes
his hat and mutters the mystic word,
“Winston ’’ 2
And who is the gentleman referred to?
And why is it that nine-tenths of the
coon-singers on the halls are always
wanting to get back to their dear old
homes? And who is stopping them in
their noble desire? And is there any
explanation why all these singers seem
to have their homes in distant Alabam,
where the roses keep on climbing round
the door, just close to where the cotton
and the corn are growing all the year
round, only later in life to leave the dear
old place to take up music-hall work
here, and then spend the remainder of
their lives telling us of their passionate
determination to get away back to the
old folks 2
And would I be right in my surmise
that very few homes in Wigan have
roses round the door or stand in fields
of growing cotton and corn or reek of
new-mown hay?
And why is it that, when you tell a
man there are so many million stars in
the skies, he will believe you, but the
moment he sees a notice on a gate
bearing the words “Wet Paint” he
puts his finger upon it just to find out
for himself 2
And why did Mrs. Asquith— But
perhaps that will be enough for the
Professor to be going on with.

A NOTE ON THE DRAMA.
[“Hamlet was not a business man.”—Mr. A. B. Walkley.]
HAD he but learned the useful knowledge
And that essential grasp of things
Which training at a business college
(If diligently followed) brings,
We should have had, no doubt,
A Hamlet with the “moody" Dane left out.
He'd not have stalked in gloomy fashion
Nor wanted to soliloquise,
But rather, undisturbed by passion,
He would have sat Napoleon-wise,
Chewing an unlit weed
And talking down the telephone (full speed).
Planning a “book” to suit his players,
He would have sought a theme less grim,
For tragedies are doubtful payers;
Revue would be the stuff for him,
Scanty in dress and plot,
With dancers featuring the Hammy Trot.
He missed one glorious proposition—
The money would have come in stacks
If he had shown the Apparition
For half-a-crown (including tax),
And, though 'twas after eight,
Added a side-line trade in chocolate.
At other stunts we find him lacking;
Thus, when he met Laertes, he
Did not secure a proper backing
Nor nominate the referee;
And, what was even worse,
Did no finessing for a bigger purse.
Had Hamlet made it his endeavour
To seize each chance of lawful gain,
Certain it is that there would never
Have been a doubt that he was sane;
And then perhaps Act Five
Had left some people—one or two—alive.
Christmas and the Children.
With the approach of a Festival that is dedicated to the
joy of children, Mr. Punch makes bold to plead the cause
of the less fortunate among them. The Queen's Hospital
for Children, once known as the North-Eastern Hospital
for Children, is the only one of its kind in this part of
London and serves a poor district with a population of half-
a-million. Its claim upon the generosity of more favoured
Londoners is as strong as its lack of funds at the present
moment is serious. It has one hundred-and-seventy beds,
and during the last year has cared for eighteen hundred
in-patients and sixty thousand out-patients. Mr. Punch is
certain that, if the children of the West-end understood the
suffering and needs of these other children of Bethnal Green,
they would want to help them by forgoing some of their
Christmas toys. Gifts should be addressed to the Secretary,
T. GLENTON-KERR, Esq., Queen's Hospital for Children,
Hackney Road, Bethnal Green, E.2.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Monday, November 29th.-Some time
ago Lord NEwToN was appointed Chair-
man of a Committee on Smoke Abate-
ment. It took enough evidence to fill
a Blue-book a couple of inches thick,
and, at the request of the Government,
furnished an interim report. Supposing,
not unnaturally, that its valuable recom-
mendations would be adopted in the Gov-
ernment's housing schemes the Com-
mittee was disgusted to find that, save
for an emasculated summary in “a dis-
mal journal called Housing,” no notice
was taken of its report. Lord NEWTON is
not a man who can safely be invited to
consume his own smoke, and he made
indignant protest this afternoon. A
soft answer from Lord SANDHURST, who
assured him that the Government, far
from being unmindful of the Committee's
labours, had already equipped some
thousands of houses with central heat-
ing, temporarily diverted his wrath.
Thanks to the Sinn Feiners, the
Public Galleries of the House of Com-
mons were closed. Thus deprived of all
audience save themselves and the re-
porters the most loquacious Members
were depressed. Bombinantes in gur-
gite vasto, their arguments sounded
hollow even to themselves. With an
obvious effort they tried to carry on
what the SPEAKER described—and de-
precated—as “the usual Monday fiscal
debate.” This time it turned upon the

large imports from Russia in 1913.
One side seemed to think that similar
imports would be forthcoming to-day
but for the obstructiveness of the
British Government, while the other
was confident that Russia had nothing
to export save propaganda. The con-
troversy was beginning to pall when
by a happy inspiration Mr. RoNALD

quired if the last egg in Russia had not
been eaten by a relation of the SECRE-
TARY OF STATE FOR WAR.
A long-standing Parliamentary tradi-
tion enjoins that the reply to any Ques-
tion addressed to the CHAIRMAN OF THE
KITCHEN CoMMITTEE should be greeted
with laughter. By virtue of his office
he holds, as it were, the “pass-the-mus-
tard ” prerogative. Members laughed
accordingly when he replied to a ques-
tion relating to the number of ex-Service
men employed by his Committee; but
they laughed much more loudly when
the hon. Member who put the original
Question proceeded to inquire “if his
conscience is now quite clear,” and
Sir J. T. Agg-GARDNER, looking as re-
spectable as if he were Mrs. Grundy's
second husband, declared, hand on heart,
that it was.
The House gave a rather less sten-
torian welcome than might have been
expected to Sir CHARLEs TownshBND,
who was escorted up to the Table by
Mr. BottomLEY and Colonel CROFT.
Perhaps it was afraid that cheers
intended for the defender of Kut might
be appropriated by the Editor of John
Bull.
Encouraged, I suppose, by the empti-
ness of the Ladies' Gallery, it then pro-
ceeded with great freedom to discuss a
proposal for the employment of women
and young persons “in shifts.”
Tuesday, November 30th.-The Ex-
CRowN PRINCE of PRUssIA will be tre-
mendously bucked when he reads the
report of to-day's proceedings, and dis-
covers that there is one person in the
world who takes him seriously. Sir
FREDERICK HALL has been much dis-
turbed by the reports of Hohenzollern
intrigues for a restoration, and begged
the Government to send a protest to
the Dutch Government. But the Fat
Boy of Dulwich quite failed to make
Mr. BonAR LAw's flesh creep.
Mr. BALDw1N is the least perturb-
able of Ministers. Even when Major
Edwards invited him to elucidate the
phrase “a working knowledge of the
Welsh language”—“Does it mean hav-
ing an intimate acquaintance with the
literary works of DAFYDD AP GwilyM
or the forgeries of ‘Iolo Morganwg '2"
—he never turned a hair.
Modesty not having hitherto been
regarded as one of Mr. CHURCHILL's
most salient characteristics I feel it
my duty to record that, on being asked
when he would introduce the Supple-
mentary Army Estimates, he replied,
“I am entirely in the hands of my
superiors.” -

would help to purify the language.
Sir HERBERT SAMUEL is determined, I
gather, to make Palestine a country fit
for rabbis to live in.
The Government of Ireland Bill had
a very rough time in Committee. The
LoRD CHANCELLOR managed to ward
off Lord MIDLETON's proposal to have
one Parliament instead of two—“a
blow at the heart of the Bill”—but
was less successful when Lord ORAN-
MoRE AND BRowNE moved that the
Southern Parliament should be fur-
nished with a Senate. The Peers'
natural sentiment in favour of Second
Chambers triumphed, and the Govern-
ment were defeated by a big majority.
The Office of Works has been lending
a hand to local authorities in difficulties
with their housing schemes. But when
Sir ALFRED Mond brought up a Supple-
mentary Estimate in respect of these
transactions he met with a storm of
indignation that surprised him. “The
road to bankruptcy,” “Nationalisation
in the building trade,” “Socialistic pro-
posals”—these were some of the phrases
that assailed his ears. Fortified, how-
ever, by the support of the Labour Party
—Mr. MYERs declared that his action
had been “the one bright spot in the
whole of the housing policy”—Sir
ALFRED challenged his critics to go
and tell their constituents that they
had voted to prevent houses being
built, and got his Estimate through by
190 to 64.
Thursday, December 2nd.—Thanks
to the free-and-easy procedure of the
House of Lords the Government began
the day with a victory. Lord SHANDON
had moved an amendment, to which the
LoRD CHANCELLOR objected. But he
did not challenge a division when the
question was put. Lord DoNough MoRE,
most expeditious of Chairmen, an-
nounced “the Contents have it,” and
the matter seemed over. But then the
LoRD CHANCELLOR woke up, and said
he had meant to ask for a division.
“All right,” said the CHAIRMAN: “clear
the Bar,” and when the white-wanded
tellers had counted their flocks it ap-
peared that the Government had a
majority of three.
I do not suppose anyone will say of
Lord BIRKENHEAD, as a celebrated
judge is reported to have said of one of
his predecessors, “’Ere comes that 'oly
'umbug 'umming 'is 'orrid 'ymns;” but
he is evidently a student of hymnology,
for he referred to the Government vic-
tory as this “scanty triumph" and for
a long time did not challenge any more
divisions.
In the House of Commons an attack
upon the new liquor regulations—
“pieces of gross impertinence” accord-
ing to Mr. MAcquistEN—found no
favour with the PRIME MINISTER. Mr.
McCURDY announced that he had re-
duced the price of wheat to the millers
and hoped that “in a few weeks” the
consumer might begin to receive the
benefit. The CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER excused the delayinpublishing
the Economy Committee's reports on
the ground that the MINISTER of MUNI-
TIONs was “at sea,” and elicited the
inevitable gibe that he was not the
only one. Sir ERIC GEDDEs, with a
judicious compliment to the motorists
for setting “an extraordinary example
of voluntary taxation,” ; a Second
Reading for his Roads Bill; and Sir
GoRDoN HEwART with some difficulty
induced the House to accept his assur-
ance that the Official Secrets Bill was
meant for the discomfiture of spies and
not the harassing of honest journalists.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-You are fond, in

gade; but the bricklayer has come in
for the thickest of your fire. I hope,
however, that you don't think you have
discovered his and his fellow-workers'
deliberate processes yourself. If so,
permit me to draw your attention to
NED WARD's London Spy, which was
published as long ago as 1699. In that
work is the description of a visit to St.
Paul's Cathedral when it was building.
A passage in this description runs thus:
“We went a little further, where we
observed ten men in a corner very busie
about two men's work, taking so much
care that everyone should have his due
proportion of the labours as so many
thieves in making an exact division of
their booty. The wonderful piece of
difficulty the whole number had to per-
form was to drag along a stone of about
three hundredweight in a carriage, in
order to be hoisted upon the moldings
of the cupola, but they were so fearful
of despatching this facile undertaking
with too much expedition that they
were longer in hauling about half the
length of the church than a couple of
lusty porters, I am certain, would have
been carrying it to Paddington without
resting of their burthen.”
Shall I refrain from remarking that
there is nothing new under the sun ?
I will. Yours, etc., L. W. E.

will be forbidden by the League of
Nations. Meanwhile let us allow our-
selves to be diverted by the motiveless
villainies of crooked cruel “Chinks"
like Wang Fu Chang, who sold opium
at a terrific profit in Mayfair, hung his
servants up by their thumbs and be-
longed to a Society of Elder Brethren,
as to whose activities we were given
no clue, unless indeed their job was
the kidnapping of Younger Sisters for
Wicked Mandarins. -
For Jack Stacey, who opened the
Prologue in Loolong with head in hands
and moaned invocations of the Deity
(a version doubtless of the well-known
gambit, “‘Hell!" said the Duchess”),
had his little daughter kidnapped at
birth or thereabouts (by Wang Fu, as it
happened), and never saw her again till,
after eighteen years of opium-doping—
between the Prologueand the First Act—
he called upon the same Wang Fu (just
before dinner) with a peremptory mes-
sage from a very bad and powerful
mandarin that if little Miss Che Fu
were not packed off to China by eleven
that same evening the Elder Brethren
would be one short by midnight. Che
Fu, I ought to say, passed as Wang's
daughter, but was so English, you know,
to look at that nobody could really be-
lieve it.
Of course Jack didn't recognise her as
his own daughter, but equally of course
we did, and knew that she would be
rescued by her impetuous boy-lover and
restored to her real father; but not
before great business with opium pipes,
pivoting statues of goddesses, inopera-
tive revolvers, gongs, strangulations
(with gurgles), detectives, rows of
Chinese servants each more rascally
(and less Chinese, if possible) than the
last, and over all the polished villainy
of the inscrutable Wang Fu Chang.
Mr. JEFFREY's technique was quite
adequate for this ingenuous kind of
thing. He achieved what I take to be
the supreme compliment of noisy hush-
ings sibilated from the pit and gallery
when the later curtains rose. Perhaps
action halted a little to allow of rather
too much display of pidgin - English
and (I suppose) authentic elementa
Chinese and comic reliefs which filled the
spaces between the salient episodes of
the slender and naïve plot. I couldn't
help wondering how Jack Stacey, whom
we left at 10.45 in a horrible stupor, shut
away in a gilded alcove of Wang Fu's
opium den, could appear at 11.30 at
Lady Handley's in immaculate evening
dress and with entirely unruffled hair,
having in the meantime cut down and
restored to consciousness two tortured
Chinese and heard the true story of his
daughter's adventures. This seems to
be overdoing the unities. And I won-
dered whether the puzzled look on
young Handley's face was due to this
same wonder or to the reflection that
if he had shed one undesirable father-
in-law he had let himself in for another.
For, needless to say, they had all met
in the famous opium scene when Stacey
was naturally not at his best.
Mr. D. LEWIN MANNERING was suit-
ably sinister as Wang Fu; Mr. TARVER
PENNA's Ah Fong, the heroine's cham-
pion, made some very pleasant faces and
gestures and was less incurably Western
than some of his colleagues; Mr. CRONIN

THE BARREL OF BEEF.
WE were dawdling home from the
westward of the flood. Astern of us,
knee-deep in foam, stood the slim
column of the Bishop lighthouse, a
dark pencil mark on the cloudless sky.
To the south the full Atlantic piled the
black reefs with hills of snow. Ahead
the main islands humped out of the
blue sea like a school of basking whales.
I had the tiller and Uncle Billy John
Polsue was forward picking up the
marks and carrying on a running com-
mentary, punctuated by expectorations
of dark fluid. Suddenly something
away on the port bow attracted his
attention. He rolled to his feet, stared
for some seconds and shouted, “Hold
'er on the corner o' Great Minaltel"
a tremor of excitement in his voice.
I did as I was bid and sheeted home.
Billy John fished the conger gaff
from under the blue and silver heap of
mackerel in the well and climbed labor-
iously on to the little half-deck. So
we were after some sort of flotsam, I
could not see what, because Billy John's
expansive back-view obscured the pros-
pect ahead, but from his tense attitude
I judged that it appeared interesting.
He signed to me to come up another
couple of points, took a firm grasp of
the gaff and leaned over the bows.
Then with a creak of straining tackle
and a hiss of riven water a gig was on
us. She swooped out of the blue,
swept by not two fathoms to wind-
ward and with a boat-hook snapped up
the treasure trove (it looked suspiciously
like a small keg) right under our very
noses as adroitly as a lurcher snaps a
hare. She ran on a cable's length,
spun on her heel and slipped away
down the sound, a long lean craft,
leaping like a live thing under her press
of canvas. She seemed full of red-
headed men of all ages and was steered
by a brindled patriarch who wagged
his vermilion beard at us and cackled
loudly. I roared with laughter; I had
seldom seen anything so consummately
slick in my life.
Billy John roared too, but from other
influences. He bellowed, he spat, he
danced with rage. He cursed the gig's
company collectively and singly, said
they were nothing better than common
pirates and that they lured ships to des-
truction and devoured the crews—raw.
The gig's company were delighted;
they jeered and waved their caps. Billy
John trembled with passion.
“Who stole the bar'l o' beef ?” he
trumpeted through his palms. “Who-
stole—the–bar'1–o'—beef ? Hoo
hoo! ”
This last sally had a subduing effect
on the gig's company; they turned

Billy John sat down with a grunt of

grinned. “They dunno who did steal
the bar'l to this day, and each wan do
suspect t'other.”
“St. Martin's islanders ?” I queried.
Billy John shook his head. “Naw,
from St. Helen's, o' course; deddn' you
see their red 'eads? They're all red-
'eaded over on Helen's—take after their

“They're pretty smart, anyhow,”
said I.
Billy John threw up both hands.
“Smart! By dang you've said it! Any-

they don't unnerstand it; but come a

asked.

There was a party of
us over 'ere crabbin'. My brother
Zackariah 'ad married a Helen's wum-
man, and a brear great piece she were
too. They was livin' on Helen's upon
Lower Town beach, and we lodged with
end.
“Wan mornin' before dawn along
comes great Susan in her stockined feet.
“Whist l’ says she, ‘rouse thee out an'
don't make no noise; I think I heerd
a gun from Carnebiggal Ledges.’
“We sneaked out like shadows, got
the boat afloat and pulled away, mufflin'
the oars with our caps. We got a fair
start; nobody heerd us go. It weren't
yet light and the fog were like a bag,
but we got there somehow, and sure
enough there were a big steamer fast
on the rocks. Great Susan were right.
Oh, I tell you teddn guesswork with
they St. Helen's folk; male or female
they got a nose for a wreck, same as
cats for mice. There was a couple o'
ship's boats standing by on her port
side full o' men.
“‘Where in 'ell are we ?' shouts 'er
skipper as we comed nosing through
the fog. 'I ain't seen the sun for two
days.”
“We told en and lay by chattin' and
wonderin' 'ow we was to plunder she,

the boy, and the lad takes 'em off into

Helen's gigs' crews had boarded her
quietly from starboard and was eatin'
through her like a pest o' ants. They'd
come staggering on deck—fathers, sons
and grandfathers—with bundles twice
as big nor themselves, toss 'em into the
gigs and go back for more. As for us,
we stood like men mazed. I tell you,
Sir, a God-fearing man can't make a

lowed by the other gigs loaded that
deep they could hardly swim. Seein'
they hadn't left us nothin' but the bare
bones we pulled in ourselves shortly
after, and my dear life what a sight we
did behold ! Fellows runnin' about in
the fog on the beach, for all the world
like shadows on a blind, cursin', shout-

huntin' high and low, and in the mid-

his bar’l o' beef like a wumman after

“Who did steal it? Do you know?”
I asked. -
Billy John nodded. “I do, Sir. Why,

Cheerful Sportsman. “HULLo, PADRE I
I SEE
YoUR LATE COLLEAGUE HAS GoSE ON AHEAD.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. Joseph HERGESHEIMER, for whose work as a novelist
I have more than once expressed high admiration, has
now brought together seven long-short stories under the
collective title of The Happy End (HEINEMANN). Lest
however this name and the little preface, in which the
writer asserts that his wares “have but one purpose—to
give pleasure,” should lead you to expect that species of
happy ending in which Jack shall have Jill and naught
shall go ill, I think a word of warning may not be wasted.
In only three of the tales is the finish a matter of conven-
tional happiness. Elsewhere you have a deserted husband,
who has tracked his betrayer to a nigger saloon in Atlantic
City, wrested from his purpose of murder by a revivalist
hymn; a young lad, having avenged the destruction of his
home, returning to his widowed mother to await, one sup-
poses, the process of the law; or an over-fed war profiteer
stricken with apoplexy at sight of a boat full of the starved
victims of a submarine outrage. You observe perhaps that
the epithet “happy” is one to which the artist and the casual
reader may attach a different significance. Butlet not any-
thing I have said be considered as reflecting upon the tales
themselves, which indeed seem to me to i. masterpieces
of their kind. Personally my choice would rest on the
last, “The Thrush in the Hedge,” a simple history of how
the voice of a young tramp was revealed by his chance
meeting with a blind and drug-sodden fiddler who had once
played in opera—a thing of such unforced art that its con-
cluding pages, when the discovery is put to a final test,
shake the mind with apprehension and hope. A writer who
can make a short story do that comes near to genius.
If you wish to play the now fashionable game of news-
paper-proprietor-baiting you can, with Miss Rose MACAULAY,
create a possible but not actual figure like Potter and, using
it for stalking-horse, duly point your moral; or, with Mr.
W. L. GEORGE in Caliban (METHUEN), you can begin by
mentioning all the well-known figures in the journalistic
world by way of easy camouflage, so as to evade the law
of libel, call your hero-villain Bulmer, attach to him all the
legends about actual newspaper kings, add some malicious
distortion to make them more exciting and impossible, and
thoroughly let yourself go. Good taste alone will decide which
is the cleaner sport, and good taste does not happen to be
the fashion in certain literary circles at the moment. Of
course Mr. GEORGE, being a novelist of some skill, has pro-
vided a background out of his imagination. The most
interesting episode, excellently conceived and worked out,
is the only unsuccessful passage in Lord Bulmer's life, the
wooing of Janet Willoughby. The awkward thing for Mr.
GEORGE is that he has so splashed the yellow over Bulmer
in the office that there is no use in his pretending that the
Bulmer in Mrs. Willoughby's drawing-room is the same
man in another mood. He just isn't. Incidentally the author
gives us the best defence of the saffron school of journalism
I've read—a defence that's a little too good to believe; and
some shrewd blows above (and, as I have hinted, occa-
sionally below) the belt.

I want to give the epithet “lush " to The Breathless
Moment (LANE), and, although the dictionary asks me as
far as in me lies to reserve that adjective for grass, I really
don't see why, just for once, I shouldn't do what I like
with it. Lush grass is generally long and brightly coloured
—“luxuriant and succulent,” the dictionary says—and that
is exactly what Miss MURIEL HINE’s book is... She tells
the story of Sabine Fame, who, loving Mark Wallance, per-
suaded him to pass a honeymoon month with her before he
went to the Front, though his undesirable wife was still
alive. In allowing her heroine to suffer the penalty of this
action Miss HINE would appear, as far as plot is concerned,
to discourage such adventures. But Sabine is so charm-
ing, her troubles end so happily and the setting of West
Country scenery is so beautiful that, taken as a whole, I
should expect the book to have the opposite effect. The
constitutes himself the annalist of the family, its private
affairs and its professional business in the commerce of
literature and art. The right of the family to its annals,
notwithstanding that its members are little involved in
furious adventures or thrilling romance, is established at
once by the very remarkable character of the Reverend
Thomas Grey. The duty upon you to read them depends,
as the prologue hints, upon whether you are greatly
interested in life and not exclusively intent on fiction.
When I realised that I must expect no more than an
account, without climax, of years spent as a tale that is
told, I accepted the conditions subject to certain terms of
my own. The family must be an interesting one and not
too ordinary; the sons, Thomas (whose creed was “Give
yourself,” and whose application of it was such that it
usually wrecked the person to whom the gift was made),
picture of a tall green wave pro-
pelling a very solid rainbow,
which adorns the paper wrap-
per and as an advertisement
has cheered travellers on the
Tube for some weeks past, has
no real connection with the
story, but perhaps is meant
to be symbolical of the book,
which, clever and well written
as it is, is almost as little like
what happens in real life.
The Uses of Diversity (ME-
THUEN) is the title of a little
volume in which Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON has reprinted a
selection of his shorter essays,
fugitive pieces of journalism,
over which indeed the casual -
reader may experience some
natural bewilderment at find-
Dick the artist, and John the
novelist, must be very much
alive; if the big adventures
were missing the little pro-
blems must be faced; the ques-
tion of sex must not be over-
looked; and of humour none
of the characters must be de-
void, and the historian himself
must be full. Mr. NIVEN failed
me in no particular.
Miss F. E. MILLs YouNG, .
in Imprudence (Hodder AND
Stoughton), is not at the top
of her form, but a meat and
effective finish makes some
amends for a performance
which is, like the wind in a

ate or light. The heroine, Pru-
dence Graynor, was the child of

regard. Many of the papers are The Goat. “Who ARE You?” brother. This battalion was
inspired by the appearance of a | The Man (greatly disturbed). “Who? Me? I–I'M THE New commanded by one Agatha, and
particular book or play. I can GAMEREEPER." it submitted to her orders and
best illustrate what I have said
above by a quotation from
The Goat. “WELL, I'M THE LATE GAMEKEEPER.
oLD BILRs THE sorce RER took To Poaching LATELY, AND I
was Fool, ENOUGH To CATCH HIM AT IT.”
You see, caprices in a way incompre-
hensible to Prudence—and inci-
one of them, in which the
author wrote (à propos of the silver goblets in Henry VIII.
at His Majesty's) that he supposed such realism might be
extended to include “a real Jew to act Shylock.” For those
who recall a recent triumph, this flight of imagination will
now have an oddly archaic effect. It is by no means the only
passage to remind us sharply that much canvas has gone
over the stage rollers since these appreciations were written.
Unquestionably Mr. CHESTERTON, with the unstaled enter-
tainment of his verbal acrobatics, stands the ordeal of such
revival better than most. Even when he is upon a theme
so outworn as the “Pageants that have adorned England
of late,” he can always astonish with some grave paradox.
But for all that I still doubt whether journalism so much
of the moment as this had not more fitly been left for the
pleasure of casual rediscovery in its original home than
served up with the slightly overweighting dignity of even
so small a volume.
In A Tale That Is Told (CoLLINs), Mr. FREDERick Niven
throws himself into the personality of Harold Grey, who
is the youngest son of an “eminent Scottish divine,” and
dentally to me. The Graynors
and also the Morgans were of “influential commercial stock,”
and both families were so essentially Victorian in their out-
look and manner of living that I was surprised when 1914
was announced. The trouble with this story is that too
many of the characters are drawn from the stock-pot. But
I admit that, before we have done with them, they acquire
a certain distinction from the adroitness with which the
author extricates them from apparently hopeless situations.

[DECEMBER 15, 1920.
TO THE LION OF LUCERN.E.
TINo, before you went away
To crouch behind a sheltering Alp,
How strong the limelight used to play
About your bald, but kingly, scalp!
And now, emerging from the shelf
(A site where Kings are seldom happy),
You must be pleased to find yourself
Once more resilient on the tapis.
Over your past (Out, damnéd spots!)
With lavish bucketfuls you paint
The whitewash on to clean its blots
And camouflage the Teuton taint;
From WILLIAM and the family tie
Protesting your unbridled freedom,
“I know you not, old man,” you cry,
“Fall to your prayers—you badly need 'em "
For Athens, to your great content,
Calls you to be her guiding star
(Only a paltry one per cent
Wanted to leave you where you are);
And you've agreed to take it on,
Jumped at the prospect Fate discloses,
And thought, “With VENEZELos gone,
Life will be one long bed of roses.”
But mark the oversight you made,
Forgetting, while you waxed so fat,
That England, whom you once betrayed,
Might have a word to say to that ;
Might, if for love of your fair eyes
Greece should decide again to wobble,
Conceivably withdraw supplies
And cut her off with half an obol.
Roar loud, O Lion of Lucerne !
But lo, upon Britannia's shore
Another Lion takes his turn
And gives a rather louder roar;
Meaning, “It doesn't suit my views
To subsidise two sorts of beano,
And Greece will therefore have to choose
Between her tummy and her TINo.” O. S.
ABOUT GOLF. -
Golf is obviously the worst game in the world. I doubt
indeed whether it is a game at all.
It is played with a ball, about which, though I could say
much, I will say little. I will not decide whether it should
have a heart of oak or a heart of gold, whether it should
go through a 1.6-inch ring or a plate-glass window, whether
it should sink like the German Navy or float like the Brit-
ish. Enough, if not too much, has been said about the
standard ball.
Golf is also played with a number of striking implements
more intricate in shape than those used in any other form
of recreation except dentistry. Let so much be agreed.
Now, quite plainly, the essential idea underlying all games
played with a ball, whether a club, stick, mallet, bat or cue
be added or no, is that some interference should take place
with the enemy's action, some thwarting of his purpose or
intent. In Rugby football, to take a case, where no mallet is
used, it is permissible to seize an opponent by the whiskers
and sling him over your right shoulder, afterwards stamp-
ing a few times on his head or his stomach. This thwarts
him badly. The same principle applies, though in a milder
form, to the game of cricket, where you attempt to beat the
adversary's bat with your ball, or, if you have the bat, to
steer the ball between your adversaries, or at least to make
them jolly well wish that you would.
Even with the baser and less heroic ball games, like
croquet and billiards, where more than one ball is used at
a time, action inimical to the interests of the opponent's
ball is permitted and encouraged. Indeed in the good old
days of yore, when croquet was not so strictly scientific, a
shrewd sudden stroke—the ankle shot, we called it, for,
after all, the fellow was probably not wearing boots—well, I
daresay you remember it; and I have once succeeded in
paralysing the enemy's cue arm with the red; but this
needs a lot of luck as well as strength, and is not a stroke
to be practised by the beginner, especially on public tables.
We come then again to golf, and see at once that, with
the miserable and cowardly exception of laying the stymie,
there is no stroke in this game that fulfils the proper con-
ditions which should govern athletic contests involving the
use of spherical objects with or without instruments of
percussion. -
And yet we read column after column about fierce en-
counters and desperate struggles between old antagonists,
when as a matter of fact there is no struggle, no encounter
at all. Against no other ball game but golf, unless perhaps
it be roulette, can this accusation be laid. Ask a man what
happened last Saturday. “I went out,” he says, rather as
if he was the British Expeditionary Force, “in 41; but
I came home”—he smiles triumphantly; you see the
hospital ship, the cheering crowds—“in 39.” Whether he
beat the other fellow or not he hardly remembers, because
there was in fact no particular reason why the other fellow
should have been there.
Golf matches ought to be arranged, and for my part I
shall arrange them in future, as follows:–
He, Can you play on Saturday at Crump?
I. No, I'm not playing this week.
He. Next week then 2
I. Yes, at Blimp.
He. I can't come to Blimp. -
I. Well, let's play all the same. Your score this week
at Crump against mine next week at Blimp, and we'll have
five bob on it.
I'm not quite sure what his retort is, but you take
my point. It is manifestly absurd to drag the psycho-
logical element into this cold-blooded mathematical pursuit.
After all that England has done and come through in the
last few years, is a man in baggy knickerbockers, with tufts
on the ends of his garters, going to be daunted and foiled
just because a man in slightly baggier knickerbockers and
with slightly larger tufts on his garters has hit a small
white pellet a little further than he has 2 Hardly, I think.
That is why, when I read long letters in the principal
daily papers about the expense of this so-called game, and
calculations as to whether it can be played for less than
twenty-five shillings a time, I am merely amused. In my
opinion, if the relatives of members of golf-clubs cannot
afford to support them, these institutions should either be
closed or the inmates should be provided with some better
game, like basketball. That is what I feel about golf.
All the same, if Enderby really thinks and believes that,
because in a nasty cross-wind I happened to be slicing
badly and didn't know the course and lost a ball at the
twelfth, and he holed twice out of bunkers and certainly
baulked me by sniffing on the fifteenth tee, and laid a
stymie, mark you, of all places at the seventeenth, that I
can't beat him three times out of five in normal conditions
and not with that appalling caddy well, I suppose
one must do one's best to relieve a fellow-creature of his
hallucinations, mustn't one 2 Evoe.

OUR HEAVY-WAITS.
OUR Boxing Correspondent sends us
the following gloomy forecast. We have
pointed out to him that Mr. CochRAN
has recently made a definite contract
for a meeting between DEMPSEY and
CARPENTIER. Our Correspondent replies
that this does not affect his attitude,
and urges us to publish his predic-
tions of further delay. We do so under
protest.
Paris, December 22nd, 1920.-M. DES-
CHAMPs (CARPENTIER's Manager) denies
all knowledge of any agreement with
Mr. CochRAN.
New York, December 24th, 1920.-Mr.
C. B. CochRAN says that DEscHAMPs
must be dotty. He (C.B.) is returning
by the Mauretania to-morrow.
London, April 17th, 1923.−As Mr.
CochRAN and M. DEschAMPs have not
yet come to an agreement the fight for
the World's Heavy-Weight Champion-
ship is indefinitely postponed. Joe
BECKETT meets Bombardier WELLs
to-night at the Circle.
London, April 18th, 1923.−Since the
days of JIM CoRBETT no more polished
exponent of the fistic art has graced
the ring than our Bombardier Billy.
Thunders of applause greeted his ap-
pearance in the “mystic square" last
night. He flashed round his ponderous
opponent, mesmerising him with the
purity of his style, the accuracy of his
hitting, the brilliance of his foot-work.
He held the vast audience spell-bound.
BECKETT won on a knock-out in the
second round.
London, August 11th, 1924.—Mr.
LovAT FRASER in a powerful article
(written entirely in italics) in The Daily
Mail points out the fearful tension the
peace of Europe is undergoing through
the continued differences between
Messrs. CochRAN and DESCHAMPs, and
demands to know what the PREMIER
is doing about it.
London, August 24th, 1924.—Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE, acting under Mr. Lovat
FRASER's orders, has gone to Lympne
(kindly lent by Sir PHILIP SAssoon),
where he will be joined by Mr. CochRAN,
M. DEscHAMPs and M. MILLERAND.
London, September 30th, 1924.—The
whole civilised world will rejoice to
hear that the differences between Mr.
C. B. CochRAN and M. DEsch AMPs
have at last been amicably settled. The
great fight for the world's heavy-weight
championship is fixed to take place at
Olympia on November 17th. DEMPsey
is to receive £100,000, CARPENTIER
£75,000.
London, October 4th, 1924.—It appears
that Olympia was already booked for
November for The Daily Mail's Ideal
Pyjama Exhibition, and Mr. C. B. Coch-
RAN has to-day issued a communiqué to
the Press Association to the effect that
the contest will be held definitely in Sark
(Channel Islands) on December 23rd.
He has hired the entire Cunard and
White Star Fleets for the day, and those
who cannot find standing room on the
island will be provided with seats and
telescopes in the ships' riggings. All
will be welcome at fifty guineas a head.
New York, October 6th, 1924.—DEMP-
SEY denies that he is meeting CARPEN-
TIER on December 23rd. He laughs at
the idea of fighting for £100,000.

a living wage.”
London, October 7th, 1924. — Mr.
C. B. Cochran, in an interview granted
to our reporter yesterday, says that he
has done with fight-promoting for ever
and will in future concentrate on per-
forming seals.
London, October 10th, 1924.—A sensa-
tion was caused at the Circle last night
when an old man jumped unannounced
into the ring and offered to fight anyone
living to a finish for five pounds and a
pint of beer for the sheer fun of the
thing. The disturber, who was obviously
out of his senses, was quickly removed.
His identity has not so far been estab-
lished, but he is thought to be a fighter of
the old school escaped from confinement.
No authoritative announcement has
been made as to who will assume
Mr. CochRAN's extensive boxing en-
gagements, but rumour is busy with
the name of Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY.
New York, January 31st, 1925. —
Mr. W. BRADY, the veteran fight-pro-
moter, has signed up J. DEMPSEY and
GEoRGEs CARPENTIER to meet at Ha-
vana, Cuba, on Easter Monday, 1925.
DEMPSEY will draw £200,000, CARPEN-
TIER 9150,000.
New York, February 8th, 1925.-Fol-
lowing Mr. W. BRADY's announcement,
Mr. TEx Rick ARDs (promoter of the
JEFFRIEs - Johnson contest) has now
come forward, stating that DEMPSEY
and CARPENTIER have signed a contract
with him to fight at Nome, Alaska, on
Shrove Tuesday, for a quarter-of-a-
million each.
New York, February 19th, 1925.-
Mr. C. B. CochRAN, who arrived on the
Aquitania this morning, says that the
two champions have contracted to
meet under his management at Tristan
d'Acunha on Good Friday for half-a-
million each and a percentage on the
popcorn and peanut sales.
New York, March 3rd, 1925.-With
the view of lifting the national depres-
sion consequent on the hitch in the
world's championship arrangements,
Mr. HENRY FoRD, whose successes as
a mediator are celebrated, is labouring
to bring about a conciliatory meeting
between the rival promoters.
New York, July 12th, 1925. — Mr.
HENRY FoRD's efforts, fortified by the
prayers of the Rev. WILLIAM SUNDAY,
have at length borne fruit. Messrs.
BRADY, CochRAN and RICKARDs have
consented to talk matters over. The
White House has been placed entirely
at the disposal of the promoters, their
families, secretaries, legal advisers, etc.

CochRAN and RICKARDs have been taken

THE GREAT FIGHT.
Geneva, July 4th, 1960. – The fight for
the Heavyweight Championship of the
World, held under the auspices of the
League of Nations, took place yesterday
before a gigantic crowd. DEMPsey, who
now wears a flowing white beard, was
wheeled into the ring in a bath-chair.
CARPENTIER, now wholly bald, appeared
on crutches and was seconded by two
trained nurses and his youngest grand-
son. Both champions were assisted to
their feet by their supporters, shook
hands and immediately clinched. In this
clinch they remained throughout the
entire round, fast asleep. At the open-
ing of the second round they attempted
to clinch again, but missed each other,
overbalanced and went to the mat.
Neither could be persuaded to get up,
and consequently both were counted
out.
It is therefore impossible to say who
won or who lost, and the Heavyweight
Championship of the World remains
as open a question as ever.

said Christopher.
“Christopher,” I answered, “girls

“I’m not going to,” said Christopher.

way, of course. -
:: ::: :: :k :k
Christopher and I were sitting by the
fire. We were very peaceful and happy
together, pretending to look at a book
but really doing nothing at all.
Then Dorothy came into the room.
Dorothy is Christopher's cousin and six
years old. Not that her age matters—
six, sixteen or sixty, they are all the
Sarne.
“What are you doing?” inquired
Dorothy.
“Nothing,” murmured Christopher
contentedly.
“I wanted you to come and play with
me.” -
Christopher shuffled uneasily and I
came to the rescue.
“Not now, Dorothy,” I said; “we
are too comfortable. Come and have a
look at this book with us.”
Dorothy looked at me as though she
had just realised my presence.
“I want Christopher to come and
play with me,” she repeated.
Christopher has a fine old-fashioned
idea of a host's duty to his guests. He
stifled a yawn and slid from my knee.
“All right, Dorothy,” he said. “What
shall we play ?”
Dorothy skipped like a young lamb.
“Hide and Seek,” she sang. “I’ll go
and hide. Don't look till I call.”
She danced gaily and triumphantly
out of the room.
Now I don't mind being snubbed and
I certainly shouldn't trouble about a
spot of a child who ought to have been
kept in the nursery. Of course it's
ridiculous even to begin explaining, isn't
it? The thing's obvious. No, I felt
that Dorothy should be taught a lesson:
that is all. I thought it would be good
for her.
“That settles Dorothy,” I said delib-
erately. “Now we can go on reading.”
“But she wants me to go and look
for her,” explained Christopher.
“Then let her want,” I said shortly.
“We can't always be Christopher,
we'll have a game with Dorothy. We'll
stop where we are and let her look for
herself.”
Christopher chuckled. “She’ll be
awfully angry,” he said uncertainly.
“Good l’’ said I.
EWE WICTORIOUS.
“Cooee " " came a voice from the
far-away. We laughed guiltily to our-
selves and settled down in the chair. The
scheme proceeded according to plan.
Aftersundry shrieksandscreeches and
whistles Dorothy grew impatient and
adopted bolder tactics.
“You can't find me,” she called hope-
fully.
I felt that it was time for a little en-
couragement.
“I wonder where she can be?” I said
loudly.
There was a long silence. At last
Dorothy grew desperate. “Look under
the armchair in the hall,” she called.
Christopher and I smiled to ourselves.
Then suddenly we heard her creeping
towards the door. I blame Christopher
for what followed.
“She's coming,” he whispered ex-
citedly. “Let's hide.”
There was no time to think. We
slipped rapidly under the table. A ridi-
culous thing to do, of course; so undig-
nified. I kick myself when I think of
it, but at the time— Well, it was
Christopher's fault for getting excited.
So there we were squashed under the
table when the door opened and Dorothy
appeared.
“I don't believe ” she began, and
then stopped. “Why, they're not here,”
she gasped. And then Christopher spoilt
everything by spluttering. I strangled
him at once and we hoped that
Dorothy hadn't heard. We saw her
legs standing very still by the door.
Then they moved quickly round the
table to the fireplace. Christopher and
I held our breaths and waited. We saw
that Dorothy was pulling our chair
round to face the fire. Then she sat
herself in it and all we could see was
the back of the chair. -
There was a great silence. Christo-
pher and I looked at each other and
decided that something must be done.
I cleared my throat quietly. “Cooee!”
I fluted.
Dorothy began to sing a hymn in a
loud voice.
And then Cecilia came into the room.
Now Cecilia is Christopher's mother
and my sister. You will understand that
neither Christopher nor I would care
to appear ridiculous in front of her. So
we kept quiet.
“Hallo, Dorothy,” said Cecilia; “all
by yourself? Where's Christopher?”
“I’m reading Christopher's book,”
said Dorothy, ignoring the question.
“May I?”
“Of course, dear,” said Cecilia, sitting
down. There was a lot more silence.
It grew very hot and uncomfortable
under the table.
“What shall we do, Uncle?"whispered
Christopher.
“Come on,” I said desperately. We
crawled out and stood up.
“What on earth ” began Cecilia.
I managed a watery smile. “Here
we are,” I said to Dorothy.
Dorothy looked at us in surprise.
“You are untidy,” she said. “What-
ever have you been doing?”
Christopher swallowed indignantly.
“We were playing ‘Hide and Seek' with
you,” he said.
“Oh, I stopped playing a long time
ago,” said Dorothy. “I'm reading
now.” She turned to our book again.
Cecilia began to laugh.
“Come and have a wash, Christo-
pher,” I said in a strangled voice, and
we moved off sheepishly.

LITTLE BITS OF LONDON.
Bond STREET.
I FIND it very difficult to walk slowly
down Bond Street as one ought to do;
I always feel so guilty. Most of the
people there look scornfully at me as
if I belonged to Whitechapel, and the
rest look suspiciously at me as if I
belonged to Bond Street. My clothes
are neither good enough nor bad
enough. So I hurry through with the
tense expression of a man who is merely
using Bond Street as a thoroughfare,
because it is the way to his dentist—as
indeed in my case it is. But recently
I did saunter in the proper way, and I
took a most thrilling inventory of the
principal classes of shops, the results of
which have now been tabulated by my
other with gold-tips and silver-tips,
cork-tips and velvet-tips, rose-tips and
lily-tips. There is only one book-shop,
of course, but there are about nine pic-
ture-places. How do they all exist 2
It is mysterious.
Especially when you consider how
much trouble they take to avoid attract-
ing attention. There are still one or
two window-dressers who lower the
whole tone of the street by adhering
to the gaudy-overcrowded style; but
the majority, in a violent reaction from
that, seem to have rushed to the wildest
extremes of the simple - unobtrusive.
They are delightful, I think, those re-
verent little windows with the chaste
curtains and floors of polished walnut,
in the middle of which reposes deli-
cately a single toque, a single choco-
grocers and a poulterer. There is even
a fish-shop—you didn't know that, did
you? I am bound to say it seemed to
have only the very largest fish, but they
were obviously fish.
Anyone can go shopping in Bond
Street. I knew a clergyman once who
went in and asked for a back-stud. He
was afterwards unfrocked for riotous
living, but the stud was produced. You
can buy a cauliflower in Bond Street—
if you know the ropes. There is a shop
which merely looks like a very beautiful
florist's. There are potatoes in the
window, it is true, but they are “hot-
house” ones; inside there is no trace
of a common vegetable. But if you
ask facetiously for a cauliflower (as I
did) the young lady will disappear below
ground and actually return with a real

twenty-one jewellers (includ-

that glittering display of lux-

vast reserves of solid prosaic

asked for. A man could live

From these figures a firm of Man-
chester actuaries has drawn the start-
ling conclusion that Bond Street is
more used by women than by men. It
may be so. But a more interesting
question is, how do all these duplicates
manage to carry on, considering the
very reasonable prices they charge?
At one point there are three jewellers
in a row, with another one opposite.
Not far off there are three cigarette-
shops together, madly defying each
late or a single pearl. Some of the pic-
ture-places are among the most modest.
There is one window which suggests
nothing but the obscure branch of a
highly-decayed bank in the dimmest
cathedral town. On the dingy screen
which entirely fills the window is written
simply in letters which time has almost
erased, “ — PICTURES.” No-
thing could be less enticing. Yet in-
side, Idaresay, fortunes are made daily.
I noticed no trace of this method at
the Advertisers' Exhibition; they might
give it a trial.
Now no doubt you fondly think that
Bond Street is wholly devoted to
luxuries; perhaps you have abandoned
your dream of actually buying some-
thing in Bond Street? You are wrong.
To begin with, there are about ten
places where you can buy food, and,
though there is no pub. now, there is a
café (with a licence). There are two
Many years ago, they tell me, there
was a butcher in Bond Street. Per-
haps you dealt there. For my part I
was not eating much meat in those
days. But I can imagine his window—
a perfect little grotto of jasper and
onyx, with stalactites of pure gold, and
in the middle, resting on a genuine
block of Arctic ice, an exquisite beef-
sausage. I wish he would come back.
It is difficult to realise that there is
anything but shop-windows in Bond
Street, but I like to think that, up there
in those upper storeys which one never
sees, there does dwell a self-contained
little community to whom Bond Street
is merely the village street, down which
the housewives pass gossiping each
morning to the greengrocer's or the
fishmonger's and never purchase any
pearls at all.
When the butcher comes back I think
I shall join them. A. P. H.

THE SAD CASE OF EL GRECO.
IT was at the National Gallery, situ-
ated on the north side of Trafalgar
Square, that I first made the acquaint-
ance of one DoMENico THEotocoPULI,
a native of Crete, who—probably be-
cause his own people wanted him to
be a stockbroker or something—set up
as a painter in Spain, and was dubbed
by the Dons “El Greco,” as you might
say “Scottie.”
For years I have been rather tickled
by his manner of depicting Popes and
Saints as if they were reflected in elon-
gating mirrors labelled, “Before Dining
at the Toreador Restaurant.” But until
quite lately I hardly ever met anyone
who had even noticed him, so I felt
quite bucked on the old chap's account
when I heard that he was considered
one of the most distinguished of the
Spanish painters, past and present, who
are on view just now at Burlington
House.
And what surprises me is not that
old THEotocoPULI should attract so
much attention in Piccadilly, but that
such lots of people seem never to have
known that he has been exhibiting him.
self all this time in Trafalgar Square.
I'm sure Mrs. Bletherwood didn't,
for one, when she tackled me at the
Chattertons' the other afternoon.
“Of course you've been to Burling-
ton House?” she began, and she was
in such a hurry to get first innings that
she didn't give me time to say that I
hadn't yet, but that I meant to go on
my first free day that wasn't foggy.
“Don’t you love those quaint “El
Grecos' 2" she went on. “He’s quite
a discovery, don't you think? My
daughter Muriel, who hopes to get into
the Slade School soon now, says she
doesn't see how anybody can see people
differently from the way “El Greco” saw
people. And yet I don't know that I
quite like the idea of Muriel seeing me
like that, although she's so clever. . . .”
I could not help thinking that in
Mrs. Bletherwood's case the “El Greco”
treatment would be an admirable cor-
rective to a certain lateral expansion.
“Besides,” she continued in a confi-
dential tone, “I’ve heard or read some-
where that there's just a doubt whether
he distorted people on purpose or be-
cause there was something wrong with
his eyes. If I thought it was astigma-
tism I would insist on taking Muriel to
an oculist. I wonder what you think.”
I raised my teacup suggestively.
Mrs. Bletherwood gasped. “You
don't mean that he ->
“Like a fish,” I said.
“Oh, how too disgraceful!” she ex-
claimed. “Fancy their having his pic-
tures there at all. Such religious sub-
jects too. I shall warn Muriel at once.

Have I done a wrong to Señor

CURES FOR INSOMNIA.
THE following correspondence, clearly
intended for the Editor of The Daily
Ailment, has found its way into our
letter-box. Another example of post-
office inefficiency. -
SIR,-As a regular reader of your
valuable journal I am always deeply
interested in the views of your readers
as expressed in its columns. The recent
letters on the cure of insomnia have
interested me particularly. Although
I have read your paper for many years,
always eaten standard bread, study
most diligently each morning my lesson
on Government wobble and waste, grow
sweet peas, keep fowls, take my holi-
days early (in Thanet) and read the
feuilleton, in short perform all the duties
of an enthusiastic loyal Englishman, I
cannot sleep. Yesterday I decided to
try the remedies suggested by your
readers.
After inviting sleep with “a dish of
boiled onions” I found that I must go
to bed “without having eaten anything
for five hours or so.” This meant sit-
ting up very late, but I found the time
useful for taking “deep long breaths.”
Meanwhile I ran through the names
of my friends alphabetically and emp-
tied the feathers from my pillow, re-
placing them with hops. Sometimes
a hop got mixed up in a “deep long
breath,” which was rather pleasant.
Every few minutes I left my friends'
names to say to myself, “I am terribly
sleepy,” or “I am falling asleep;” this
was wrong, as the boiled onions had
not had nearly five hours. “Relaxing
all my muscles" was rather awkward,
as one hand was filling the pillow with
hops and the other was “holding a wet
sponge,” which would drip water on
the sheets. Another difficulty was
“wafting myself in an imaginary aero-
plane" to bring about “a state of ob-
livion and coma,” which I might per-
haps have done more easily by putting
the hops to another use.
I had to cut out the “recital of the
Litany," partly because my friends'
names had only got as far as George
(Lloyd), and also because, being a Non-
conformist, I don't know it. (I must
learn it now the feuilleton is finishing.)
But the most annoying part of the
business was to find that, after all this
elaborate preparation for sleep, I was
to “take a brisk walk for half-an-hour"
(whatever the weather conditions).
Even this did not work, for by that
time the milkmen and newsboys were
heralding the dawn and kept my brain
too alert.
As a final effort, do you think you
could produce a nightcap model of the
Sandringham, or is it quite impossi-
ble for one who reads your paper to be
anything but wideawake?
THE PERFECT PARTNER.
THERE are, my Mabel, men who vow
The perfect wife is theirs
Because she smoothes the ruffled brow
And drives away their cares;
While there are others hold the view
That she is best who'll pay
Some trivial attention to
Her promise to obey.
Well, let each babble in his turn
About that spouse of his;
Not knowing you, how could they learn
What true perfection is?
Of all your sex you stand most high
By far and very far
Who mid your Christmas gifts can buy
A smokeable cigar.

SIR. D. MACLEAN, MR. Hogg E., M.R.
Monday, December 6th.-" Logic has
never governed Ireland and never will,”
said Lord MIDLEton to-day. It was
certainly conspicuous by its absence
from a good many of the speeches made
in Committee on the Government of
Ireland Bill. Representatives of South-
ern Ireland have been clamouring for
greater financial control, but they quite
changed their tone when Clause 24, en-
abling the Irish Parliaments to impose
a surtax upon residents in Ireland, came
up for discussion. While professing the
greatest confidence in the desire of their
fellow-countrymen to treat them fairly,
Lords DROGHEDA, SLIGO and WICKLow
agreed in thinking that this was too
dangerous a power to entrust to them;
it would breed absenteeism and drive
capital out of the country.
Lord FINLAY, to whom as a Scotsman
logic still makes appeal, was for the
deletion of the whole clause. But the
Irish Peers again objected; for they
desired to preserve for the Irish Parlia-
ments power to remit Imperial taxes,
on the off-chance that some day it
might be exercised. And they carried
their point.

G. LAMBERT, MR. G. R. THORNE, MR. Asquith, MB. AcLAND, GENERAL SEELY.
According to Lieut.-Colonel CROFT
the pencils used by the British Post-
Office are procured from the United
States. As one who has suffered I can
only hope that Anglo-American friend-
ship, already somewhat strained by the
bacon episode, will survive this revela-
tion.
On the strength of a rumour that the
seed of Irish peace had been planted in
Downing Street, Mr. Hogg|E promptly
essayed to root it up in order to observe
its progress towards fruition. The PRIME
MINISTER, however, gave no encourage-
ment to his well-intentioned efforts.
Nor did he satisfy Lieut.-Commander
KENworthy's curiosity as to whether
Father O’FLANAGAN was “a Sinn Feiner
on the bridge,” beyond saying “that is
what we want to find out.”
Tuesday, December 7th. – After a
week's interval for reflection and study
Lord LINcoLNSHIRE moved the rejection
of the Agriculture Bill. Adapting an
old joke of Lord SPENCER's, made in
“another place” a generation ago, he
observed that this was no more an
agricultural Bill than he himself was
an agricultural labourer. He knows
however how to call a spade a spade,
if not something more picturesque, and
he treated the measure and its authors
to all the resources of a varied vocabu-
lary. Possibly his brother peers, while
enjoying his invective, thought that
it had been a little bit overdone, for
of the subsequent speakers only Lord
HINDLIP announced his intention of
voting against the Bill, the others being
of opinion that parts of it were, not ex-
cellent perhaps, but at least tolerable.
In the Commons Wiscount CURzoN
pressed upon the Government the desir-
ability of licensing side-car combina-
tions as taxi-cabs. The idea might, one
feels, appeal to a Coalition Govern-
ment; but Sir John BAIRD for the Home
Office hinted at the existence of “serious
objections.”
Collectively the House has an infan-
tile mind. It went into kinks of laughter
over a question put by Dr. MURRAY
regarding the “daily mail service"
between one of his beloved islands and
the Scottish mainland. The author of
the joke—and small blame to him—
quite failed to appreciate how funny he
had been until his neighbours muttered

in stage - whispers, “Daily Mail 1"
“Daily Mail!” Then awan smile broke
over his own features.
It has been stated in certain news-
papers that Mr. CHAMBERLAIN has re-
fused the Viceroyalty of India in conse-
quence of the weak state of his health,
and that for the same cause he is likely
to vacate shortly the Chancellorship of
the Exchequer. All I can say is that
on the Treasury Bench he betrays no
outward sign of this regrettable debility
when dealing with critics of the Treas-
ury. It is not easy to puncture the as
tripler of Mr. BottomLEY, but two
words from Mr. CHAMBERLAIN did it
this afternoon.
Sir Robert HoRNE got a second read-
have up a certain newspaper for breach
of privilege in endeavouring to dictate
to Members how they should vote. He
obtained leave to move the adjournment
and would doubtless have provided the
peccant journal with a valuable free
advertisement had not Mr. LowTHER,
reckless of his reputation for infalli-
bility, suddenly remembered that mo-
tions for the adjournment were intended
for criticising the Government and not
for rebuking irresponsible outsiders. At
his request the gallant Major withdrew
his motion, and The Daily — lost
its advertisement.
Invigorated by this episode the House
—or what was left of it—resumed the
Report stage of the Ministry of Health
little Bills.” Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING
had another solution for the difficulty
and asked, “Why not pass them all
ad hoc 2" meaning, it is supposed, “en
bloc.”
Well might the PRIME MINISTER re-
mark at Question-time that he welcomed
the attacks of a certain section of the
Press on the “Wastrels” because then
he knew the Government was all right.
Mr. GEORGE LAMBERT made a lively
speech in support of his proposal to
“ration " the Government to a sum of
£808,000,000—the amount Mr. CHAM-
BERLAIN had said would suffice for a
normal year. But his criticisms were
too discursive to be really dangerous,
and his condemnation of “sloppySocial-
ing for the Dyes Bill, a
measure which he com-
mended as being neces-
sary to protect what is
a key-industry both in
peace and war. Dye-
stuffs and poison - gas
are, it seems, inextric-
ably intermingled, and
unless the Bill is passed
we shall be able neither

The CHANCELLOR of

minded the House that

Second Reading; Lord HARRIs believed
that it would make very little difference
one way or the other; Lord RIBBLES-
DALE, as an old-fashioned Free Trader,
would have nothing to do with it; Lord
LovaT was of opinion that as an insur-
ance for our food supply it would not
compare with a Channel Tunnel; and
Lord BUCKMASTER feared that it would
rather strengthen than allay the demand
for land nationalisation. The Govern-
ment approached the division in some
trepidation and were the more rejoiced
when, in an unusually big House, the
Second Reading was carried by 123 votes
to 85.
But for the self-sacrifice of Mr.
SPEAKER the Commons would have
made themselves ridiculous this even-
ing. Major ARCHER-SHEE wanted to
Bill. The debate was remarkable for
the brevity of some of the speeches.
Sir Rowland BLADEs set a good ex-
ample to new Members by making a
“maiden" effort in a minute and a
half. But his record was easily beaten
by Mr. SExton, who found ten seconds
sufficient for expressing his opinion that
the fact that the House was trying to
legislate in the small hours was suffi-
cient proof of the necessity of extending
the laws of lunacy. “Si argumentum
requiris circumspice,” he might have
said as he gazed upon the recumbent
and yawning figures around him.
Thursday, December 9th.-Mr. BonAR
LAw enumerated a portentous list of
measures which the House of Commons
must pass if it wants to enjoy its
Christmas holidays in peace. Lord
HUGH CECIL wanted to know what
was the use of passing “all these foolish
“to see that the population is con-
tented.” That sounds a little like panem
et circenses — a policy which did not
work out cheaply.
Friday, December 10th.-With the
air of one who has something fresh and
strange to impart the PRIME MINISTER
informed the House of Commons to-day
that in regard to Ireland “the Govern-
ment aredetermined on a doublepolicy.”
The novelty presumably consists in
putting those old stagers, conciliation
and coercion, hithertoonly tried tandem-
fashion, into double harness. Martial
law is to be introduced in certain of
the most disturbed districts, and at the
same time such Sinn Fein M.P.'s as are
not “on the run” are to be called into
conference. On the face of it the pros-
pect looks unpromising, but happily
Ireland is essentially the place where
nothing happens save the unexpected.

A writeR in an evening contemporary
complains that one has some difficulty
in finding the notices to jurors in the
newspapers.
We have often thought that more
prominence might be given to the
Law Notices generally. Printed in the
smallest type and abbreviated almost
beyond understanding, they are by no
means the brightest item of news.
Would it not be an advantage to hand
the department over to a smart para-
graphist 2 Readers might then be
entertained by something like the
following:—
Visitors to the Law Courts to-day

the cosiest of our beautiful Courts of
Justice. Here will be continued the
scintillating contest between Sir An-
thony Prius, K.C., and that rising young
barrister, Mr. Terry Blee-Smart, K.C.
It is more than probable that the cross-
examination of the humorous butcher
will continue through most of the day.
The first case on the list in the
Lord Chief's Court to-day is no other
than The King v. The Dean and Chapter
of Mumborough Cathedral. While it is
not expected that his Majesty's engage-
ments will permit him to be present,
an action of this character is fraught
with more than common interest, since
it must be seldom that the Royal House
finds itself in such conflict with the
Church as to resort to the arbitrament
of the law.

THE 0THER HALF.
I was sitting by Anderson's fire the
other day when his telephone bell rang.
He made the usual insincere exclama-
tion of disgust—as insincere as the
horror we simulate when a bundle of
letters is brought into the room, to
have letters and to be called up on the
telephone being really adventures and
therefore welcome; and he then crossed
the room to answer the call.
“Shall I go?” I asked, thinking that
he might prefer to be alone.
“Oh, no,” he said, and I remained.
I was not trying to overhear, but it
couldn't be helped. -
This is the conversation (his half) that
I heard:—
“Yes.”
“Speaking. Who is it?”
“Oh, I'm so glad ' I was getting
horribly nervous. How is he?”
“Good Heavens ! I was afraid he
might be. What do you think?"
“Of course I must trust you.
we must never let my wife know.”
“I’ll think about it and let you
know.”
“Quite likely. I'll go into that and
let you know. She can't be absolutely
alone anyway. There must be another
some time.”
“And what do you propose
now 2 ''
“You’re sure it will be painless?
“I wouldn't have him suffer for any-
thing.” -
“Thank you very much. I shall tell
my wife he died in his sleep. Good-
bye.” - -
'what I wonder, would you have
made of that 2 Some telephone con-
versations are easy to construct, but
this to me was a puzzle. What had
Anderson been up to ? It must be an
awful moment, I have often thought
as I read divorce and other cases, when
a friend is suddenly turned into a wit-
ness; and I had the feeling that that
might be my lot now. Those clever
cross-examining devils, they can get
anything out of you. If Anderson had
known who was ringing him up he
would probably (so I reasoned) have
got me out of the room; but, having
once started, he decided to brazen it out
as the less suspicious way.
As so often happens, however, I was
wrong. This is the whole innocent
conversation:-
“Is that 1260 2''
“Yes.”
“Is Mr. Anderson there 2"
“Speaking. Who is it?”
“Harding, the veterinary surgeon.”
“Oh, I'm so glad ' I was getting
horribly nervous. How is he?”
“He 's worse."

might be. What do you think?"

other ?”
“I’ll think about it and let you know.”
“Perhaps a totally different breed
would be better; not another Peke.
There'd be fewer unhappy associations
then, don't you see?”
“Quite likely. I'll go into that and

THE MOUNTAIN AND THE PROPHETS.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, – At Geneva
there is, and was long before the ar-
rival of the League of Nations, a moun-
tain. There are many mountains in
Switzerland, but Geneva's private
mountain happens to be in France. It
is called “The Salève,” a nasty name,
but not of my choosing. If, being in
Geneva, you want to go up The Salève
(as I personally do not) you have first
to get your passport off the police. The
police are always a little difficult about
passports, but, if you mention the name
of The Salève, you will find them easier.
You have next to obtain the French
visa in order to get out of Geneva;
then the Swiss visa in order to get
back again. Thus provided you have
to compete with a complicated and
long-drawn process of trams and fron-
tier controls; even so you find yourself
at the bottom and not at the top of The
Salève. - -
Being a busy (or shall we say idle?)
man yourself, you will thus understand
the reasons of my policy; if the moun-
tain will not come to MAHOMED then
MAHOMED and the mountain are best
kept apart.
The inhabitants of Geneva have long
been contriving, intriguing, I will even
say complotting, toget me up The Salève.
My doctor, having made me thoroughly
interested in myself, got on to the sub-
ject of exercise; when my banker passed
from the subject of interest on over-
drafts to the advisability of my seeing
the great Geneva view, it was un-
But
doubtedly blackmail; and as for my
dentist—well, you know what dentists
are and what mean advantages they
take. But this one, I think, over-
stepped the limit when he allowed the
crown of my tooth to remind him of
the crown of Mont Blanc.; paused in
fixing the former to descant on the
beauties of the latter; told me that
from The Salève I should get a better
view of the latter than he, where he
was, was getting of the former; asked
me almost simultaneously if he was
hurting me and if I had been up The
Salève, and told me that I must go up
it and (which I took to mean “or”)
that he might have to hurt me.
That was the most critical moment
in the whole Battle of The Salève; the
military critics are unanimous that I
should have then said, “I will go up,”
had I been in a position to say any-
thing at all. Saved by the gag, I have
won the war against the Genevois.
I have taken the standpoint of the
prophet, who, as you know, is not with-
out honour abroad—a prophet with the
policy outlined above. When a prophet
of my sort decides on a policy, and that
policy consists of doing nothing, he
takes a lot of shifting, even on the flat.
And there the matter and I remained,
when there arrived from England, on
or about November 15th, a positive
cloud of prophets, intent on the League
of Nations. The busiest figure among
them is the secretary of one of the
delegates. Pretending to be my best
friend he sought the occasion of a
heart-to-heart with me. I took it he
wanted to discuss Nations; it appeared
he wanted to discuss mountains. I hoped
he was considering them generally in
mass, possibly with the view of making
a League of them. He was thinking
in the particular, and you can guess
what particular. He was beginning to
think of wanting to go up It.
In an effective speech, which brought
tears to my eyes but merely gave him
an opportunity to fill and light his pipe,
I put all the “cons” before him, par-
ticularly the passport part. As a man
speaking with the authority behind him
of a world leagued together, he detailed
all the “pros.” We must act together,
he and I; he would assemble the pro-
phets, I the passports.
I refused to be bullied by him. He
named some major prophets, whom I
should find it more difficult to with-
stand. His propaganda amongst them
apparently began at once. Mark the
sequence of events:—
On Tuesday, November 16th, His
Majesty's Minister-Plenipotentiary and
Envoy - Extraordinary in Switzerland
assembled the British element to dinner.
I have reason to know that he had al-

ready been approached by the secretary.
The Crown of Mont Blanc was freely
discussed and curiosity was aroused as
to the identity, the desirability, even
the approachability of the nearer moun-
tain.
On Wednesday, November 17th, Iran
into Lieut.-Col. His Highness the JAM
SAHIB of NAwan AGAR–“RANJI,” in brief.
He was standing at the entrance of his
hotel in significant meditation. The
entrance of his hotel looks upon The
Salève and past it to the Crown of
Mont Blanc. And that was where he
looked. -
On Friday, November 19th, I found
the Right Hon. G. N. BARNEs walking
along the Quai de Mont Blanc in the
fatal direction. His eyebrows pointed
relentlessly upward.
On Saturday, November 20th, Mr.
BALFour arrived. The secretary began
to talk about a date for our excursion.
On Sunday, November 21st, I became
involved in conversation with Lord
RoBERT CECIL in his room in his hotel.
He moved towards the window, and as
he did so Armenia, Vilna and all the
Powers that want to come into the
League and all the Powers that want
to stay out of the League faded from
his mind, and he called attention to
the Crown of Mont Blanc and fixed
his eagle eye upon the mole-hill in
between.
On Monday, November 22nd, the
secretary came to me and ordered me
to provide passports, duly visaed, for
The Salève party—seven in all, myself
included. I told him that I would ap-
peal direct to the delegates themselves,
with whom I had already done some
defensive propaganda on my own. He
told me it was nothing to do with the
delegates; it was the delegates' ladies.
Fool that I was, I had never thought
of them
That night I wrote in my diary: “At
Geneva there is a mountain. It is called
The Salève—a nasty name for a nasty
mountain. On Saturday I shall be on
the top of it. I always knew that
the League of Nations would make
trouble.”
On Tuesday, November 23rd, I sent
an emissary among the ladies to per-
suade them that the summit of The
Salève was loathsome. The emissary
succeeded in establishing this point by
contrasting it unfavourably with the
Crown of Mont Blanc. The ladies
thanked the emissary cordially for her
most interesting information and said
they would take steps to see the Crown
of Mont Blanc more nearly, even if those
steps had to be up The Salève.
That night I wrote in my diary:

On Wednesday morning, November
24th, I met Mr. BALFour crossing the
Pont du Mont Blanc. He was looking
at It with that dreamy smile of his,
which seems to laugh at the littleness
of man and the futility of his policies.
That finished me.

THE ARRIVAL OF THE MANX BALLET.
THE first visit of the Manx Ballet to
London is undoubtedly the most out-
standing feature in the annals of chore-
graphic and corybantic realism since
the historic première of the Botocudo
Troupe on September 31st, 1919. And
it is all the more welcome as an indica-
tion of the emergence of a native school,
fully equipped in technique and scenic
resource and, above all, imbued from
start to finish with a high sense of
the paramount importance of psycho-
analysis in eliminating all supra-lim-
inal elements from the orchestro-
mimetic drama. -
The most ambitious as well as the
most successful item in the programme
presented on Saturday night at the
Colossodrome was The Cat of Balla-
salla, that wonderful old Manx legend
of the Princess who was turned into
a cat by the enchantments of the
Wizard of Dhoon and subsequently
sentenced to decaudation by the cruel
Scandinavian invader, MAGNUs BAR-
Fod. The scene of the trial in the
great synclinorium of Greeba Castle—
exhibiting contemporaneous carboni-
ferous tuffs, soft argillaceous rocks
with choriambic fossils as well as later
dolerite dykes, amid which the feline
amenities of the Princess were illus-
trated with miraculous agility by Miss
Agneesh Crannoge—compares favour-
ably with the most ambitious enormi-
ties ever perpetrated by the genius of
BAKST, DIAGHILEv, or even CocodRILLO,
the Sardinian neo-Gongorist.
The music, which is chiefly founded on
Manx folk-songs, developed and adapted
by Mr. Orry Poolvash, is richly sug-
gestive of the psycho-analytic basic
aroma which pervades the entire scen-
ario. The absence of a Coda in the
Funeral March which concludes the
ballet is an exquisitely pathetic touch
which could only have occurred to a
composer of genius. The orchestration
is sumptuous and sonorous, the usual
instruments being supplemented by two
Glory Quayle-horns, a quartet of Laxey-
phones with rotating C and C sharp
crooks, a Manx harp with three strings,
and a Miaowola, which gives out the
Death Motive of the Princess at the
various crises of the drama in tones of
sublimated anguish and intensity.
We have only space in this brief pre-
liminary notice to remark that the pro-
gramme includes a humorous extrava-
ganza entitled The Quirks of Quilliam,
in which a grotesque pas de quatre for
the Deemster, the Doomster, the Boom-
ster and the Scrabster, forms the central
episode; and ends with a satiric sketch,
The Golden Calf of Man, apparently
aimed at the extravagance of Lancashire
trippers, who are pursued by demons
into Sulby Glen, and released, to the
sound of sea-trumpets, by the beneficent
intervention of Lord Greeba on their
promising to evacuate the island.

THE news that Mr. STEPHEN LEAcock has published a
fresh series of burlesques will, I do not doubt, add to the
Christmas jollity of a vast crowd of laughter-lovers. The
name of it is Winsome Winnie, and other New Nonsense
Novels (LANE), and I can only describe it in that pet phrase
of the house-agents as “examined and strongly recom-
mended” for the merriest five-shillings' worth that I have
enjoyed this long time. If ever a volume demanded to be
read aloud over the Yule log here it is. Which of the eight
novels is the most irresistible must remain, I suppose, a
matter of individual taste; for myself I found the opening
chapter in the title-tale the funniest thing in the collection,
and that not forgetting the billiard match in the detective
story, a contest that I defy anyone to follow without
tears. To attempt analysis of such happily unforced
humour would be a dark and dreadful task; but I incline to
think that, more than most, the fun of Mr. LEAcock (to be
accurate one should, I suppose, say Dr. LEACOCK) depends
upon the sudden tripping-up of the reader in his moment
of fancied security. The cliché, with its deceptive appear-
ance of solid and familiar ground, conceals an unexpected
trap. Thus Winnie, the thrown-upon-the-world heroine,
asked by the family lawyer how she proposes to gain a
livelihood, replies in consecrated phrase, “I have my needle.”
“Let me see it,” says the lawyer. But I grow pedantic;
far more important than the method of this little book is its
gift of seasonable entertainment, for which we need only
wipe our eyes and be grateful.
In The Royal Artillery War Commemoration Book Messrs.
G. BELL AND SONs have produced a noble volume worthy of
the great record of the Royal Regiment. To the energy
and enthusiasm of Mrs. AMBRose DUDLEY is largely due
the collection of the fine material which Major-General
Sir HERBERT UNIACKE has here set out in fair order and
proportion. Personal diaries dealing with various phases
of the War on all fronts or with the daily routine of batteries
are here interspersed with articles and poems of a more
purely literary quality and with original illustrations, largely
the work of Gunner-officers and extremely well reproduced.
Among the most notable contributors are Brigadier-General
J. H. MoRGAN, Major W. R. BURKHARDt., D.S.O., Major The
Master of BELHAVEN, Captain VICTOR WALROND (the last
two killed in action), Captain GILBERT HolidAY, Captain H.
Asquith, Lieut. Robert NICHOLs, Lieut. GILBERT FRANKAU,
Gunner MEARs, the Hon. NEVILLE LYTTON, Mr. SEPTIMUs
Power, Mr. W. Roth ENSTEIN, Miss LUCY KEMP-WELCH
and Mr. C. CLARK. Punch is represented by several
artists, including Captain E. H. SHEPARD, M.C., and
Lieut. WALLIS MILLs (both of the Regiment), who have
contributed some delightful colour-sketches, very faithfully
observed. Many of the poems, too, that appear in the
volume have been reprinted from the pages of Punch.
There are brief records of those members of the Regiment
who won the V.C., many portraits of “Representative
Artillerymen,” and a Roll of Honour of fallen officers,
numbering 3,507. Lack of space alone prevented the in-
clusion of the names of the 45,442 Other Ranks who gave
their lives for their country. Every Gunner who does not
possess this splendid memorial work should have it given

Like the Regiment, it should go Ubique.
When Mr. Robert CHAMBERs decides to give his neurotic
New York society women a miss, and exploit his more
imaginative and adventurous vein, I always know that I
am in for a late night and an extra large gas bill. Like
the British soldier Mr. CHAMBERs does not carry the word
“impossible” in his vocabulary. Why should he, since he
can give the semblance of reality to the utterly unbelievable?
Then one mutters, “What utter rubbish!” and sends round
to the bookseller to enquire if by any chance there is a
sequel coming out. In The Slayer of Souls (HoDDER AND
Stoughton) Mr. CHAMBERs is at his best and most im-
possible. A race of dreadful magicians, the descendants of
the Old Man of the Mountain, who have been multiplying
and acquiring extraordinary psychic powers in the interior
of China for centuries, come forth to do battle with the
United Secret Service for the souls of men. They have
Pierce's Legacy is a pleasant tale most pleasantly told, and
it is not Mrs. ConyERs' fault, but her misfortune (and ours),
that novels which describe the lighter side of Irish life,
even with the tenderest humour, are more likely just now
to make one sigh than smile. -
I do not know whether The Scar (Hodden AND Stough-
TON) first saw publication in any of our popular dailies, but
from internal evidence I should be strongly inclined to sus-
pect it. At least Miss RUBy M. AYREs has written an
admirable example of the class of tale, beloved of our serial
public, in which new every morning are the tribulations of
the elect, only to vanish with startling suddenness in the
last days of June or December. For example, Mark, the
hero, begins as the misunderstood son of one of those
widower-fathers who in such stories dwell for ever behind
the locked doors of studies, leaving in this instance Mark to
be the victim of an aunt whose lack of sympathy approaches
the pantomimic. All the usual results follow, even to the

THEA CoNYERS gives us once more all that we have learned
to expect of her novels: the friendly, witty, blundering ser-
vants; the hunting society in which wealth and poverty,
breeding and vulgarity, cheerfully rub shoulders; the de-
scriptions of the wistful beautiful West of Ireland in autumn
and winter; and above all the horses. Added to all this
there are Sinn Fein raids, real and imaginary, to bring
things up to date. A rather unconvincing plot, with a
dash of Great Eaſpectations in it, yet offers a situation
which has plenty of amusing possibilities. Honor and Evie
Nutting, two middle-aged spinsters, find themselves the
possessors of eight thousand a year, on condition that they
spend it all. That sounds, of course, a very pleasant
arrangement; but they have been struggling for years to
make ends meet and economy has become a habit. The
end of the first quarter finds them sending Harris, the
English manservant, in haste to buy a frying-pan with the
last unspent three shillings and sixpence. That the Uncle
Pierce of the title should be really a brother, that characters
should change their names without rhyme or reason from
paragraph to paragraph, and that inverted commas should
make their appearance just anywhere—all this, I think,
is the author's clever way of suggesting an atmosphere
of Irish irresponsibility, and it is quite successful. Uncle
need only add that, if you want them, you know where
to go to find them.
Had I been asked to godfather Smith and the Pharaohs
(ARRowsMITH) I should have refused to stand, unless its
name was changed to “Barbara who Came Back,” for the
tale of Barbara is by far the best in this book of short
stories. It would be boastful—as well as untrue—to say
that I have read all of Sir H. RIDER HAGGARD's many
books, but as far as my experience of them goes I find a
delightfully fresh quality in this tale. It may be old-
fashioned and over-sentimental, but in spite of these defects
it has a very definite charm, and its conclusion makes a
curious and legitimate appeal to the emotions. All the
other stories are well up to standard, and it is amazing
that an author who has written so much still shows no
symptoms either of weariness or vain repetition.
Those who appreciate Miss C. Fox SMITH's familiarity
with the ways and moods of sailormen and her flair for the
true sea-tang will welcome the new collection of
which she has brought out under the title, Ships and Folks
(ELKIN MATHEws). Most of these verses have appeared in
Punch, and no further commendation is here needed.

“THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.”
IN AFFECTIONATE MEMORY of F. H. TownsenD.
ONLY a few days before the sudden tragedy which took
from us our colleague of the Punch Staff, he made me a
small request, very characteristic of his kindly heart. It
was that I should put in these pages a notice of The
Christmas Spirit, the illustrated annual published in aid
of the work of Talbot House (“Toc. H.”), in which he had
taken a practical interest. In carrying out his wish I want
not only to plead in behalf of a good cause, but also to
associate this appeal with the memory of one with whom
for over fourteen years I have worked in close and happy
comradeship. - - .
In case any reader of Punch has yet to be introduced to
the idea of Talbot House, let me explain that its purpose
is to carry on in peace-time the work that was done by the
original "Toc. H.,” which from 1915 to 1918, under the
management of the Rev. P. R. CLAYTON, M.C., Garrison
Chaplain, provided the comforts of a club and rest-house at
Poperinghe for soldiers passing to and fro in the deadl
Salient of Ypres. Its objects—I quote from The Christmas
Spirit—are: -
“(1) To preserve among ex-Service men and to transmit
to the younger generation the traditions of Christian Fellow-
ship and Service manifested on Active Service.
(2) To offer opportunities for recreation and the making
of friendships to thousands of men who find life a difficult
salient to hold. -
(3) To provide opportunities for men of all kinds to come
together in the Spirit of Service, to study, to discuss and,
if possible, to solve the problems of their time.
(4) To offer the help and happiness of club life at a low
rate by establishing clubs in many centres throughout the
country as the focus of the brotherhood.”
The noble work done by Talbot House in Poperinghe and
Ypres was gratefully recognised by the scores of thousands
of our troops whose needs it served in those hard days, but
it was only when the War was over that its story was made
known to the public at home in Tales of Talbot House
(CHAtto AND WINDUs), which received a warm welcome in
the review columns of Punch. This was followed recently
by The Pilgrim's Guide to the Ypres Salient (REIACH), a
little book compiled and written, as a labour of love, entirely
by ex-Service men. Besides being actually a nresent-day
uide to the Salient, it contains special articles illustrating
the life that was there lived during the War by various
branches of the service. And now we have the annual of
“Toc. H.”—The Christmas Spirit—to which the PRINCE of
WALEs has #. a foreword and a host of brilliant authors
and artists have freely contributed. Here are RUDYARD
KIPLING, STEPHEN GRAHAM, G. K. CHESTERTON, E. F. BEN-
son, IAN HAY, GILBERT FRANKAU, W. RothenstEIN, “Spy,”
DERw ENT Wood, HEATH Robinson and, of Punch artists,
F. H. TownseND, LEwis BAUMER, G. L. STAMPA, GEORGE |
MoRRow, G. D. ARMoUR, E. H. SHEPARD, “Fougasse,”
WALLIs MILLs and H. M. BATEMAN.
The four contributions of F. H. TownsenD include a
“first study" for a drawing that appeared recently in Punch
and a delightful sketch of “The Christmas Spirit,” as
typified by a St. Bernard dog from whose little keg of
brandy a traveller, up to the neck in snow, is reviving
himself.
Out of the great scheme in whose aid this remarkable
annual has been published have already sprung two Talbot
Houses, one in Queen's Gate Gardens, and one in St. George's
Square. There is still need of a main headquarters in London
and hostels for its branches, more than sixty of them, spread
all over the country. “Toc. H.,’” says its Padre, “is not
a charity. Once opened our Hostel Clubs are self-supporting,
as our experience already proves. In Edinburgh, Liverpool,
Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds, Shef-
field, two thousand pounds will open a house for which our
branches in each of these places are crying out. It is only |
the original outlay, the furniture and the first quarter's rent,
which stands between us and a whole series of such houses
in the great provincial centres. Fifty pounds will endow a
bedroom, where a lad can live cheaper than in the dingiest
lodgings, and know something better of a great city than
that it is a place where all evil is open to him and all good
is behind closed doors. . . . ‘Toc. H.,’ we repeat, is not
another recurrent charity. It is a wise way of helping to
meet our debt of honour; it is a living and growing memorial,
charged with the task of making reincarnate in the younger
world the qualities which saved us.”
Punch ventures to add his voice to this claim upon our
honour and gratitude; and, if I may, I would like to make
appeal to all who loved the work of our friend who is dead,
that they should send some offering to this good cause as
y a personal tribute to the memory of a man who, in his own
form of service, did so much to cheer the hearts of our
fighting men in the dark hours that are over.
Contributions should be addressed to the Rev. P. B.

THE FAIRY TAILOR.
SITTING on the flower-bed beneath the hollyhocks
I spied the tiny tailor who makes the fairies' frocks;
There he sat a-stitching all the afternoon
And sang a little ditty to a quaint wee tune:
“Grey for the goblins, blue for the elves,
Brown for the little gnomes that live by themselves,
White for the pixies that dance upon the green,
But where shall I find me a robe for the Queen 2"
All about the garden his little men he sent, `
Up and down and in and out unceasingly they went;
Here they stole a blossom, there they pulled a leaf,
And bound them up with gossamer into a glowing sheaf.
Petals of the pansy for little velvet shoon,
Silk of the poppy for a dance beneath the moon,
Lawn of the jessamine, damask of the rose,
To make their pretty kirtles and airy furbelows.
Never roving pirates back from Southern seas
Brought a store of treasures home beautiful as these;
They heaped them all about him in a sweet gay pile,
But still he kept a-stitching and a-singing all the while :
“Grey for the goblins, blue for the elves,
Brown for the little gnomes that live by themselves,
White for the pixies that dance on the green,
But who shall make a royal gown to deck the
Queen?” -

THoughTS IN A COLD SNAP.
IT is going to be very cold when I
get up, which will be almost imme-
diately—very cold indeed. It was zero
yesterday; it may be below the line
to-day, twenty or thirty below the
line—even more. A little slam, per-
haps, in spades. There are icicles hang-
ing from the window-frame; and it is a
curious thing, when one comes to think
of it, what a lot of things there are that
rhyme with icicle : tricycle, bicycle,
phthisical, psychical—no, I am wrong,
not psychical . . .
Anyhow, it is going to be very cold.
Some people do not mind the cold.
There are people bathing in the Ser-
pentine at this moment, I suppose, and
apparently nothing can be done about
it. They ju-just break the ice and
ju-jump in. And yet it is not their ice;
it is the KING's. It seems to me that
it ought to be made illegal, this break-
ing of the KING's ice, like the breaking
of windows in Whitehall. These ice-
breakers seem to me as bad as the
people who say, “It's going to be a
nice old-fashioned Christmas, with Yule-
logs and things.” Not that I object to
Yule-logs. I have some in my own
Yule-shed, hand-sawn by myself, though
I am not a good hand-sawyer. When
I get about halfway through, the saw
begins to gnash its teeth and groan at
me. It seems to me that what is
wanted is a machine for turning the
logs round and round while one holds
the saw steady. But there is some-
thing beautiful in burning the Yule-
logs of one's own fashioning that makes
one feel like the sculptor when at last
the living beauty has burst forth under
his chisel from the shapeless stone.
Besides, they are cheaper than coal.
As I say, when people talk of “Yule-
logs and things,” it is not the Yule-logs
that I object to. It is the things. Nasty
cold things like clean shirts and collars
and bedroom door-handles—there ought
to be hot water in bedroom door-handles
—nasty cold things that make one say
“Ugh.” I have a theory that the word
“Ugh " was invented on some such
morning as this. Previously people
had been contented with noises like
“Ouch " and “Ouf ’’ and “Ur-r,”
though they realised how inadequate
they were. And then one day, one very
cold tº day, inspiration came to the
frenzied brain of a genius, and he wrote
down that single exquisite heart-cry
and hurried it off to the printer. People
knew then that the supreme mating of
sound and sense, which we have agreed
to call poetry, had once more been
achieved.
But I have wandered a little from the
Serpentine. Has it ever struck you what
people who bathe in the Serpentine on
days like this are like during the rest of
the year?
Suppose it is a balmy spring morn-
ing, a mild temperate afternoon in early
summer, a soft autumn twilight when
everyone else is happy and content,
what are they doing then? Positively
bathed in perspiration, groaning under
the burden of the sun, mopping their
shining foreheads and putting cabbage-
leavesunder their hats. And then at last
comes the day they have longed for
and looked forward to all through the
twelve-months' heat-wave, a beautiful

day forty degrees below the belt. They
spring out of bed and fling wide the
casement. That is what they intend
to do, at least. As a matter of fact, of
course, it is stuck, and they have to
bash it out with a bolster, sending the
icicles clinking into the basement.
“Delicious !” they say, leaning out
and breathing deep. Then they chip a
piece of ice out of the water-jug with
a hammer, rub it on their faces and
begin to shave.
They shave in their cotton pyjamas,
with bare feet, humming a song. Then
they put on old flannels and a blazer,
wrap a towel round their neck, light a
cigarette, pick up a mattock and stroll
to Hyde Park. When they get there
they feloniously break the KING's ice.
Then they “ugh.” The mere thought
of these people ughing with a great
splash into the Serpentine makes me
feel ill. When I think of them after-
wards sitting lazily on the bank and
letting the blizzard dry their hair,
basking in the snow for an hour or two
and reading their morning paper, and
every now and then throwing a snow-
ball or a piece of “ugh" into the water,
I hate them. Nobody ought to be
allowed to bathe in the Serpentine on
days like this except the swans, who
paddle all night to hold the ice at bay.
I wonder if I could get a swan and
keep it in the water-jug.
Half-past eight? Yes, I did hear,
thank you. I am really going to get
up very soon now.
What I am going to do is to make
one tiger-like leap—tiger-like leap, I say
—for the bathroom door and turn the
hot-water tap full on until the whole of
the upper part of the house is filled with
steam.
I am going to do it this very moment.
I—yes—ugh.
Now I come to think of it a tiger-
like leap would be quite the wrong idea.
I am glad I did not do it. Tigers are
not cold when they leap. “Tiger, tiger,
burning bright.” Tiger, tiger
What did you say? A quarter to

frozen? Are they?

THE way in which he eats and drinks

And, if he doesn't have the pick,
Is very, very rude;
The pig has not a word to say
To subtleties of taste;
He eats whatever comes his way
With admirable haste.
In fact, the pig may well resent
The insult to his line

TAFFY THE FOX.
[Mr. HoRATIo BottomLEY has complained of the war-time efforts
of the PoET LAUREATE, and desires the appointment of a national
bard whose mind is more attuned to the soul of the British nation.
Recent political events are not of course a very inspiring subject for
serious verse, but we have tried to do our feeble best here in faint
imitation of one of the manners of Mr. JoHN MASEFIELD.]
SAFE and snug from the wind and rain
In a thick of gorse with a tranquil brain
The fox had slept, and his dreams were all
Of the wild Welsh hills and the country's call;
He slept all night in the Wan Tun Waste,
He woke at dawn and about he faced,
He flexed his ears and he flaired the breeze
And scratched with his foot some poor wee fleas;
He sat on his haunches, doubted, stood ;
To his left were the lairs of his native wood,
The deep yew darkness of Cowall Itchen;
He flaired, I say, with his nostrils twitching
Till he smelt the sound of the Fleet Street stunt
And over the hillside came the Hunt.
:: zk x -k sk
Over the hillside, clop, clip, clep,
And the dappled beauties, Ginger and Pep,
Live Wire, Thruster, Fetch Him and Snatch Him,
They were coming to bite him and pinch him and
scratch him,
Whimpering, nosing, scenting his crimes,
The Evening News and The Morning Times.
“Yooi ! On to him Yooi there !” Hounds were in;
He slunk like a ghost to the edge of the whin;
“Hark! Holloa Hoick ' " They were on his trail.

The huntsman, Alfred, rode The Mail,
A bright bay mount, his best of prancers,
Out of Forget-me-not by Answers.
A thick-set man was Alf, and hard,
He chewed a straw from the stable-yard;
He owned a chestnut, The Dispatch,
With one white sock and one white patch;
And had bred a mare called Comic Cuts;
He was a man with fearful guts.
So too was Rother, the first whip,
Nothing could give this man the pip;
He rode The Mirror, a raking horse,
A piebald full of points and force.
All that was best in English life,
All that appealed to man or wife,
Sweet peas or standard bread or sales
These two men loved. They hated Wales.

The fox ran on with a mask unpuckered
By Boshale Stump and Uttermost Penny,
Where the grass was short and the tracks were many.
He tried the clay and he tried the marl,
A workman's whippet began to snarl;
Into the Dodder a splash he went,
All that he cared was to change the scent,
And half of the pack from the line he shook
By paddling about in the Beaver Brook.

To find the best way of escape and nab it,
He couldn't get out of this flairing habit;
He felt at his back the fiery breath

He turned once more for the shelter good
Of the Wan Tun Waste and the dark yew wood,
The deep yew fastness of Cowall Itchen
And the scuts and heads of hens in his kitchen.

you've selected such a lot of parts for

we can do with Alan.”
“Ah,” said John ; “Alan | Yes, he's
a problem, certainly. If he had any
voice, now. I'm not sure that we want
him at all. Could he do a clog-dance,
do you think?”
“Don’t worry,” I interrupted; “I’ve
thought of a fine part for me. All the
best concert parties have a chap who
sits in the corner and does nothing but
look miserable. I could do that splen-
didly.”
“That's quite true,” said John ap-
provingly; “it tickles the audience,
you know, to see a fellow looking glum
while everyone else is having hysterics
at the funny—at the humourist. It
isn't as easy as it looks, though, Alan.
I shall keep saying things to make you
laugh, you know. You'll find it jolly
difficult to keep looking miserable once
I get going.”
“Not at all,” I said.
“That is, I
shall do my best to keep serious. I
shall try not to listen to you being
funny.”
John looked at me and considered
whether it was worth following up.
He decided it was not. -
“I daresay he'll do,” he said loftily
to Cecilia; “the fellow has no sense of
humour anyway.”

WINE merchants must be kind men.
So many of those who have sent me
their circulars this Christmas-time have
announced that they are “giving their
clients the benefit of some exceptionally
advantageous purchases which they
have made.”
But it is not the humanity of wine
merchants of which I wish to speak.
It is the intriguing epithets which they
apply to their wines. And I have enter-
tained myself by applying these to
my relatives, an exercise which I find
attended by the happiest results.
“Fine old style, rich,” is, of course,
obvious. It applies to more than one
of my Victorian uncles. “Medium rich"
to a cousin or so. More subtle is
“medium body.” This must be Uncle
Hilary; he takes little exercise now-
adays and his figure is suffering. Soon
he will be “full-bodied " or “full and
round.” “Elegant, high class” is my
Cousin Isabel. “Pretty flavour” also
is hers. “Fresh and brisk” is Aunt
Hannah. And could anything be more
descriptive of Aunt Geraldine than
“delicate and generous”?
For “great breed and style” (used, I
see, of a claret) I should, I fear, be obliged
to go outside the family; and “recom-
mended for present consumption and
for laying down "I only mention be-
cause it leaves me wondering to what
other uses a fine fruity Burgundy could
be put. But here is a noble one: “Of
very high class, stylish, good body and
fine character.” I have tried this on
several relations without being entirely
satisfied about it, and I have finally
decided that I shall keep it for myself.

had merely seized the opportunity to
pick up a parcel.
A Supplementary Estimate of six and
a-half millions for the Navy gave the
economists their chance. Mr. G. LAM-
BERT could not understand why we were
employing more men at the dockyards
than before the War, and suggested that
three or four of the yards might be sold.
This proposal was received with singu-
larly little enthusiasm by most of the
Members for dockyard constituencies;
but Sir B. FALLE (Portsmouth) hand-
somely remarked that Chatham might
well be leased for private enterprise.
The Member for Chatham was not pre-
sent, or he would, no doubt, have re-
turned the compliment.
Wednesday, December 15th.-A less
adventurous Minister than Mr. CHUR-
chILL might have funked the task of
§. to a House of Economists a
Supplementary Army Estimate of forty
millions. But he boldly tackled the
job, and proved to his own satisfaction
that half the liability was a mere
book-entry, and the other half inevi-
table, in view of the Empire's commit-
ments. Sir CHARLEs TownshenD, in
a maiden speech which in the more
flamboyant passages suggested the
collaboration of the EDItoR of John
Bull, announced his intention of sup-
porting the Government “for all I am
worth,” and proceeded to demonstrate
that their policy in Mesopotamia had
been wrong from start to finish.
Thursday, December 16th.-I don't
know whether the current rumours of
the PRIME MINISTER's delicacy are put
about by malignant enemies who hope
that Nature will accomplish what they
have failed to achieve, or by well-mean-
ing friends who desire to convince the
Aberystwith Sabbatarians that Sunday
golf is essential to his well-being. In
his answers to Questions this afternoon
he showed no signs of failing powers.
When Mr. BILLING accused him of
breaking his pledge that there should be
no more secret diplomacy he modestly
replied that that was not his but Presi-
dent WILSON's phrase; and a little later
he informed the same cocksure ques-
tioner that a certain problem was “not
so simple as my hon, friend imagines
most problems are.”
An inquiry about the Franco-British
boundaries in the Holy Land led the
PRIME MINISTER to observe that the
territory delimited was “the old his-
toric Palestine—Dan to Beersheba.” It
was, of course, a mere coincidence that
the next Question on the Paper related
to the destruction of calves, though not
the golden kind.
The quarter-deck voice in which
Rear-Admiral ADAIR thundered for in-
formation regarding the Jutland Papers
so startled Sir JAMES CRAIG that, fear-
ing another salvo if he temporised with
the question, he promptly promised
immediate publication.
Despite a characteristic protest from
Mr. DEVLIN, who, as Mr. BonAR LAw
observed, treats his opponents as if
they were “not only morally bad but
intellectually contemptible,” the House
proceeded to consider the Lords' Amend-

DoN'T FORGET what
AND, BY THE way, I'M GREATLY IN NEED OF A COOK-GENERAL, IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
BUT REMEMBER SHE MUST BE CAPABLE AND PLAIN–NoT LIKE THE HUssIEs You Usually FETCH.”
A FOUL GAME.
IT is Christmas, and here is a nice
little cricket story for the hearth. The
funny thing about it is that it is true.
And the other funny thing about it is
that it was told to me by a huge Rugger
Blue called Eric. (I understand people
can change their names at Confirma-
tion. Why don't they?)
It was in a College match—not, I
gather, a particularly serious one. Eric
and his friend Charles were playing for
Balbus College against Caramel College.
Caramel had an “A” team out, and
Balbus, I should think, must have had
about a “K” team . . . anyhow, Eric
and Charles were both playing. Eric,
as he modestly said, doesn't bat much,
and Charles doesn't bowl much. Eric
said to Charles, “I bet you a fiver you
won't get six wickets.” Charles said
to Eric, “All right; and I bet you a
fiver you won't get a hundred runs.”
Then began a hideous series of in-
trigues. Caramel were to bat first, and
Eric went to the Balbus captain and
said, “There's a sovereign” for you if
Charles doesn't go on to bowl at all.”
“Very well,” said the captain, with
a glance of sinister understanding.
“Wouldn't have anyhow,” he added
as he pocketed the stake.
Then Charles arrived.
* This is a pre-war story.
“Two pounds,” said the captain.
“What for ?” said Charles.
“For ten overs—four bob an over.”
“It's too much,” said Charles; “but
there's a sovereign for you if Eric goes
in ninth wicket down.”
“Very well,” said the captain, with
a glance of devilish cunning. “It's
only one lower than usual. Thank you.”
Acting on intuition and their know-
ledge of the captain, Eric and Charles
then hotly accused each other of bribery.
Both confessed, and it was agreed to
start fair. Charles was to bowl first
change and Eric was to bat first wicket.
The captain said he would want a lot
of bribing to go back on the original
arrangement, especially if it meant
Charles bowling, but he would do it for
the original price; and, as he already
held the money, Eric and Charles had
to concede the point.
By the way, I am afraid the captain
doesn't come very well out of this, and
I'm afraid it is rather an immoral story;
but my object is to show up the evils
of commercialism, so it is all right.
Pallas Athene came down and stood
by the bowler's umpire while Charles
was bowling, and he got five wickets
quite easily. It was incredible. The
Caramel batsmen seemed to be para-
lysed. Then the last man came in, and
the first thing he did was to send up a
nice little dolly catch to Eric at cover-
point. Eric missed it. When I say he
missed it I mean he practically flung it
on the ground. Indeed he rather over-
did it, and the batsman, who was a
sportsman and knew Charles, appealed
to the umpire to say he was really out.
Pallas Athene grabbed the umpire by
the throat, and he said firmly that no
catch had been made.
Then the batsmen made a muddle
about a run and found themselves in
the common but embarrassing position
of being both at the wicket-keeper's end.
The ball had gone to Eric and he had
only to throw it in to Charles, who was
bowling, for Charles to put the wicket
down. But in one of those flashes of
inspiration which betray true genius he
realised that in the circumstances that
was just what Charles would not do.
Direct action was the only thing. So,
ball in hand, he started at high velocity
towards the wicket himself.
He was a Rugger Blue (I told you)
and a three-quarter at that, so he went
fairly fast. However, the batsman saw
that he had a faint hope after all, and
he ran too. It was an heroic race, but
the batsman had less distance to go.
Eric saw that he was losing, and from
a few yards' range he madly flung the
ball at the wicket. He missed the
wicket, but he hit Charles very hard on
the shin, which was something. Ifancy
he must have hit Pallas Athene as

well, for with the very next ball she
gave Charles his sixth wicket.
By this time the game had resolved
itself into an Homeric combat between
the two protagonists, of which the
main bodies of the Balbus and Caramel
armies were merely neutral spectators
—neutral, that is, so far as they had
not been hired out for some dastard ser-
vice by one or other of the duellists.
When Eric went in it was clear that
Juno had come down to help him, for
he made three runs in eight balls with-
out being bowled once. Then Charles
came in. His first ball he hit slowly
between mid-off and cover, and he
called for a run. All unsuspecting,
Eric cantered down the pitch. When
he was half-way Charles seemed to be
seized with the sort of panic which
sometimes possesses a batsman. “No,
no!" he cried. “Go back! go back!"
And he scuttled back himself. Juno
fortunately intervened and Eric just got
home in time. But he realised now
what he was up against. His next ball
he hit towards mid-wicket, and shout-
ing “Come on " " he galloped up the
pitch. Charles came on gingerly, ex-
pecting to be sent back, but Eric duly
passed him ; he then turned round and
just raced Charles back to the wicket-
keeper's end. Charles was only a Soccer
Blue (and a goal-keeper at that), and
Eric won.
“After that,” said Eric with his usual
modesty, “it was easy.” Eyewitnesses,
however, have told me more. Juno
dealt with the Caramel bowlers, but
Eric had to compete with Charles. And
Charles resorted to every kind of devilish
expedient. Nearly all the Balbus bats-
men were bribed to run Eric out, and
whenever he hit a boundary Eric had
to stop and reason with them in the
middle of the pitch. Sometimes he tried
to outbid Charles, but he usually found
that he couldn't afford it. So he col-
lared the bowling as much as possible
and tried not to hit anything but bound.
aries. Juno helped him a good bit in
that way.
When he had made seventy he got
a ball on the knee. Charles ran out
and offered to run for him, but Eric
said he could manage, thank you. Then
Charles went and walked rapidly up
and down in front of the screen; but
Eric wasn't the sort of batsman who
minded that.
At about ninety, Eric's knee was
pretty bad, so he called out for some-
body to run for him—not Charles. Five
of Charles's hirelings rushed out of the
pavilion, but the captain said he would
go himself, as that wasn't fair. Besides,
he had money on Eric himself.
At this point I gather that Pallas
Athene must hºwe deserted Charles al-
together, for he seems to have enter-
tained for a moment or two the ignoble
notion of tampering with the scorer.
I am glad to be able to say that even
the members of the Balbus College “K.”
Team, eaten up as they were by this
time with commercialism, declined to
be parties to that particular wickedness.
With every circumstance of popular
excitement Eric's hundredth run—a
mis-cue through the slips—was finally
made, scored and added up. In fact,
he carried his bat.
“So you were all square,” I said, not
without admiration.
“By no means,” said Eric. “It cost
me forty shillings.”
“And Charles 2"
“It cost him seven pounds.” A.P.H.
“SUGGESTIONS.”
A WARNING.
ENTERING as we are upon the season
of games, it might be well to utter an
urgent appeal to hostesses not to play
“Suggestions.” For “Suggestions,”
though it may begin as a game, is
really a wrangle. Under the guise of
a light-hearted pastime it offers little
but opportunities for misunderstanding,
general conversation, allegations of un-
fairness, and disappointment.
“Suggestions” ought to be played
like this: You sit in a semicircle and
the first player says something—any-
thing—a single word. Let us suppose
it is (as it probably will be in thousands
of cases) “MARGOT.” The next player
has to say what “MARGOT” suggests—
“reticence,” for example—and the next
player, shutting his mind completely
to the word “MARGOT,” has to say
what “reticence" suggests—perhaps
Grimaud, in The Three Musketeers—
and the fourth player has to disregard
“reticence" and announce whatever
mental reaction the name of Grimaud
produces. It may be that he has never
heard of Grimaud and the similarity
of sound suggests only GRIMALDI the
clown. Then he ought to say, “GRIM-
ALDI the clown,” which might in its turn
suggest “melancholy” or “the circus.”
All the time no one should speak but
the players in their turn, and they
should speak instantly and should say
nothing but the thing that is honestly
suggested by the previous word. At
the end of, say, a dozen rounds the
process of unwinding the coil begins,
each player in rotation taking part in
the backward process until “MARGoT"
is again reached.
That is how the game should be
played.
This is how it is played :—
First Player. Let me see; what shall
I say?
Various other Players(together). Surely
there's no difficulty in beginning? Say
anything,” etc., etc.
A Player (looking round). Say—say
“fireplace.”

he had never proposed the game). It

All. Oh, yes, say “MARGoT.”
First Player. Very well, then —
“MARGOT.”
(More laughter.)
Second Player (trying to be clever).
“Reticence.”
(Shouts of laughter.)
Other Players. How could “MARGOT.."
suggest “reticence"?
M. C. Never mind; the point is that
it did. Now then—and please everyone
be silent—now, then, Third Player?
Third Player. “Audacity.”
M. C. I'm afraid you're not playing
quite fairly. You see “reticence" can-
not suggest “audacity.” The First
Player's word not impossibly might.
Could it be that you were still thinking
of that ?
Third Player. I'm sorry. But “reti-
cence” doesn't suggest anything.
Other Players(together). Oh, yes, it does
—“silence,” “grumpiness,” “oysters,"
“Trappists.”
M. C. If a word suggests nothing
whatever to you, you should say,
“Blank mind.”
Third Player. Ah, but I've thought
of something now—“reticule.”
IRoars of laughter.)
M. C. It's all right. That's how
the mind does work. Now, next player.
Fourth Player. Have I got to say
something that “reticule” suggests?
M. C. That's the idea—yes.
A Player. Say “vanity-bag.”
Another Player. Say “powder-puff."
(Roars of laughter.)
M. C. Please, please—either the game
is worth playing or it isn't. If it is
worth playing it is worth playing seri-
ously, and then you can get some very
funny effects—it's a psychological exhi-
bition; but if other players talk at the
same time and try to help it's useless.
Now, next player, please. The word is
“reticule.”
Fourth Player (after a long silence).
“Bond Street.”
Fifth Player. Ah, “Bond Street”!
That's better. That suggests heaps of
things. Which shall I choose? “Choco-
lates " ? No. “Furs"? No. “Dia-
monds”? No. Oh, yes—“Old Masters.”
M. C. (with resignation). But you
know you mustn't select. The whole
point of the game is that you must say

MISPLACED BENEWOLENCE,
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-From your earliest
years you have preached sound and
wholesome doctrine on the duty of man
to birds and beasts. Indeed, I remember
your pushing it to extreme lengths in
a poem entreating people not to men-
tion mint-sauce when conversing with
a lamb. Still, I wonder whether even
you would approve of the title of an
article in Nature on “The Behaviour
of Beetles.” Of course I know that
“behaviour" is a colourless word, still
I am rather inclined to doubt whether
beetles know how to behave at all. I
may be prejudiced by my own experi-
ences, but they certainly have been
unfortunate. They began early—at my
private school, to be precise. I shall
never forget the conversation I had,
when a new boy, with a sardonic senior
who, after putting me º the usual
catechism, asked me what I was going
to be. I replied that I had not yet
decided, whereupon my tormentor, after
looking at my feet, which I have never
succeeded in growing up to, observed,
“Well, if I were you, I think I should
emigrate to Colorado and help to crush
the beetle.” Later on in life I was the
victim of a cruel hoax, carried out with
triumphant ingenuity by a confirmed
practical joker, who with the aid of a
thread caused what appeared to be a
gigantic blackbeetle to perform strange
and unholy evolutions in my sitting-
room. Worst of all, I was victimised
by the presence of a blackbeetle in a
plate of clear soup served me at my
club. I backed my bill, but it was too
late, for I am very shortsighted.
No, Mr. Punch, I am prepared to dis-
cuss the Ethics of Eels, the Altruism
of Adders, the Piety of Pintails, or even
the Benevolence of Bluebottles, but (to
deviate into doggerel)—
“Let LANKESTERs, LUBBocks and
CHEATLES
Dilate with a rapturous bliss
On the noble behaviour of beetles—
I give them a miss.” -
I am, Mr. Punch, with much respect,
Yours faithfully,
PHILANDER BLAMPHIN.
THREE TRAGEDIES AND A MORAL.
THERE was an imperious old Sage
Who upheld the dominion of Age,
But his son, a grim youth,
Red in claw and in tooth,
Shut him up in a chloroformed cage.
There was also a Child full of beans
Who bombarded nine great magazines,
But not one of the nine
Ever published a line,
For the Child was not yet in its teens.
There was thirdly, to round off these
rhymes,
A Matron who railed at the crimes
Of designers of frocks
Who in smart fashion “blocks"
Left middle-age out of The Times.
The moral—if morals one seeks
In an age of sensation and shrieks—
Is this: Even still
Things are apt to go ill
With old, young and middle-aged freaks.

CoME AND HELP BoBBIE—HE's FALLEN INTO THE LUCKY DIP.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
So charged is it with liable-to-go-off controversy that I
should hardly have been astonished to see Mr. H.G.WELLs's
latest volume, Russia in the Shadows (HopDER AND STOUGH-
Ton), embellished with the red label of “Explosives.” Prob-
ably everyone knows by now the circumstances of its
origin, and how Mr. WELLs and his son are (for the mo-
ment) the rearguard in that long procession of unprejudiced
and undeceivable observers who have essayed to pluck the
truth about Russia from the bottom of the Bolshevist pit.
What Mr. WELLs found is much what was to be expected:
red ruin, want and misery unspeakable. The difference
between his report and those of most of his forerunners is
that, being (as one is apt to forget) a highly-trained writer,
he is able to present it with a technical skill that enor-
mously helps the effect. Our author having been unable to
deny the shadow, like everyone else save perhaps the pre-
posterous Mr. LANSBURY, the only outstanding question is
who casts it. The ordinary man would probably have
little hesitation about his answer to that. Mr. WELLs has
even less. He unhesitatingly names you and me and the
French investors and several editors. Well, I have no
space for more than an indication of what you will find in
this undeniably vigorous and vehement little volume. But
I must not forget the photographs. Some of these, of de-
vastated streets and the like, have rather lost their novelty.
Unfortunately, however, for Mr. WELLs as propagandist
he has also included a number of the most revealing por-
traits yet available of the men who are hag-riding a once
great nation to the abyss. I can only say that for me
those portraits put the finishing touch to Mr. WELLs's argu-
ment. They extinguish it. -
The pictorial wrapper of A Man of the Islands (HUTCHIN-
son) is embellished with a drawing of a coffee-coloured lady
in a costume that it would be an under-statement to call
curtailed, also (inset, as the picture-papers say) the portrait
of a respectable-looking gentleman in a beard. In the
printed synopsis that occupies the little tuck-in part of the
same wrapper you are promised “an entrancing picture of
breaking seas on lonely islands and tropical nights beneath
the palms.” In other words Mr. H. DE WERE STACPooDE as
before. Lest however you should suppose the insularity of
this attractive pen-artist to be in danger of becoming over-
done, I will say at once that the six tales from which the
book takes its name occupy not much more than a third of
it, the rest being filled with stories of varied setting
bearing such titles as “The Queen's Necklace,” “The Box
of Bonbons,” and the like—all frankly to be grouped under
the head of “Financial Measures.” This said, it is only
fair to add that the half-dozen Sigurdson adventures—he
was the Man of the Islands, a bearded trader, murderer,
pearl thief and what not—seem to me a group of as rattling
good yarns as of their kind one need wish to meet, every
one with some original and thrilling situation that lifts it
far above pot-boiling status. I could wish (despite any-
thing above having a contrary sound) that Mr. STACPoolE
had given us a whole volume with that South Sea setting
that so happily stimulates his fancy.
Mr. S. P. B. MAIs has not yet extricated himself from
the groove into which he has fallen. It is not a wholesome
groove, and even if it were I should not wish an author of
his capacity to remain a perpetual tenant of it. In Colour
Blind (GRANT RICHARDs) we are given the promiscuous
amours of a schoolmaster, a subject which has apparently
a peculiar attraction for Mr. MAIs. Jimmy Penruddocke,
who tells the story, left the Army and could not find a job
until he was offered a mastership at a public school. The
school rather than Jimmy has my sympathies. There was

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
nothing peculiarly alluring about this philanderer to account
for the devastating magnetism which he exerted upon the
female heart. To describe all this orgy of caresses could
hardly have been worth anyone's time and trouble; certainly
it was not worth Mr. MAIs's. I say this with all the more
assurance because, greatly as I dislike the main theme of
this novel, there are many good things in it. There is, for
example, Mark Champernowne (Jimmy's friend), a finely
and consistently drawn character, and there are descriptive
passages which are vividly beautiful and also some delightful
gleams of humour. I think that when Mr. MAIS's sense of
humour has developed further he will agree with me that a
man who loved as promiscuously as Jimmy and then wrote
over three hundred pages about it could, without much
straining of the truth, be called a cad.
For many reasons I could wish that England were China.
It would be nice, for instance, to address the HoME SECRE-
TARY as “Redoubtable Hunter of Criminals" and to call
for-Chelsea. It is typical of Mr. OHLsoN's care that, though
one would in such a situation nine times out of ten be safe
in backing Art for the double event, he makes so even a
match of it between Hubert and Ralph that he leaves the
heroine ringing the door-bell of the one immediately after
kissing the other. You observe that I was perhaps really
more interested in the contest than my opening words would
suggest, but it was always in a detached story-book way:
except in the case of a mildly unsympathetic secretary,
represented as having spent too much time in the contem-
plation of other persons' affluence, also as owning an
expensive-looking stick that made him long to be as rich
as it caused him to appear. I hate to think that there can
have been anything here to touch a chord in the reviewing
breast, but the fact remains that Mr. Burnham stands out
for me as the only genuinely human figure in the book.
Blessed, no doubt, is the nation or the man without a
history, but blessed too is the biographer who has something

ences of a young lady
named Monique, who married the Secretary to the Chinese
Embassy in Paris and was obliged, after visiting her re-
lations-in-law, to reconcile herself to the introduction of a
second wife into the family, in order that their notions of
propriety might be respected and an heir born to the line.
When she had consented she returned to Paris and wrote
the following cablegram from her own mother's house:
“You have acted as a good son and a faithful husband.
Bring back with you the mother of our (sic) child.” And
so, the author evidently feels, it all ended happily. His
book is an interesting and amusing presentment of an older
civilisation, but if it won't strain the Entente I am bound
to say that I disagree with his conclusions.
I fear it may sound an unkindly criticism, but my abiding
trouble with Broken Colour (LANE) was an § to get
any of the characters, with perhaps one exception, to come
alive or behave otherwise than as parts of a thoroughly
nice-mannered and unsensational story. Perhaps it was
my own fault. Mr. HAROLD OHLson (whose previous book
I liked) has obviously, perhaps a little too obviously, done
his best for these people. It is a tale of two rivalries: that
for the heroine, between the penniless artist-hero and a
pound-full other; and that in the breast of the p.a.h.,
between the flesh-pots of commerce and the world-well-lost-
fleet; yet in himself,
though the writer draws an attractive picture of his
home and religious life, he was only a kindly Christian
gentleman who lectured to a few naval students. This
is not the stuff to turn into a thrilling life-story, yet his
studies on Sea-Power in relation to national greatness
must certainly be reckoned among the prime causes of world-
war. They set the Germans trying to outbuild the British
fleet; more fortunately they were an inspiration to naval
enthusiasts in this country also. Mr. TAYLOR has a pleasant
chapter describing the immediate recognition and welcome
his hero received in England, while it has taken quite a
number of chapters to do justice to all the written tributes
to his genius that the energetic author has collected. Per-
sonally, if ever I had been in doubt about it, I should have
been quite willing to take that genius for granted some time
before the end, and could indeed recommend the volume much
more happily if it were reduced by about half. It will be
valuable mainly as a necessary work of reference.

THE HAPPY HOOTS.
YEs, it is nearly twelve now. In
ten minutes we shall hear the bells—I
mean the hooters. I wonder if there
were hooters when TENNYSON wrote
those popular lines about ringing in the
New Year. Very likely he didn't hear
them if there were, as there's nothing
to show that he ever really stayed up
late enough to see the New Year in.
It's a pity, because the hooters would
have fitted in to that poem most beauti-
fully. The hooting idea is just what is
wanted to give a dramatic contrast to
the sugary ringing business.
“Ring out the false, ring in the true”
doesn't convince somehow ; it's too
impartial. One doesn't say to the foot-
man, “Show the Rector up, please, and
show this blackmailer out,” even at the
Lyceum. One says, “Kick this black-
hearted hound out,” and the footman
realises then that you have something
against the fellow. Just so one doesn't
gather from the above line that the
poet has any strong preference as be-
tween the false and the true, except
that there is no good rhyme to “the
false,” unless you can count “waltz";
but what about—
Hoot out the old, ring in the new ;
Hoot out the false, ring in the true?
Magnificent ' There's some sting in
that; it “gets over,” and it brings the
whole poem into harmony with modern
practice. - -
Come on, we'd better have another
dance before the great moment. I
wonder if TENNYson ever saw the New
Year in at two guineas a head. I don't
expect so. For that matter it's the
first time we've done it at an expensive
public “Revel ” ourselves; but then
this is the first year we've been abso-
lutely bankrupt. Up till now we've
been rather well off, and have cele-
brated cheaply at home. Do you realise
that this is our wedding-day ? I be-
lieve you'd forgotten; women never
remember these things. Yes, it's six
years . . . Six years. And this is the
first year we've been bankrupt. All
the same, as I say, it's the first year
we've come out and had a jolly good
supper. Reckless 2 Yes, I'm afraid
we are. But we've caught it from the
Government . . . However, to-morrow
we'll start a new cheque-book.
Have you made your resolutions yet?
I have. Do you remember this time
last year? You said you'd keep ac-
counts, and I said I wouldn't smoke so
much. And all the year through our
resolution has never wavered. I've got
evidence of that. Look at my diary.
Here we are:—
January 1st.—G. started keeping ac-
counts. Gave up smoking.
And here we are again:-
March 20th-G. started accounts.
March 29th.-Knocked off smoking.
That shows it was no mere flash-in-
the-pan, doesn't it?
And we went on like that. Look at
this:— - -
June 6th-Gave up smoking.
June 7th-Only one pipe since yes-
terday.
June 30th.-Cut myself down to four
pipes a day.
July 1st–9th-G. keeping accounts;
knocked off smoking.
But I wonder why I kept writing it
down. Even in September, you see, I
wasn't taking it for granted:—
September 29th.-Quarter-Day. Not
smoking this quarter. G. began new
system of accounts.
It looks like bragging, doesn't it 2
But I don't think I can have meant it
that way. Still, it is rather marvellous,
when you come to think of it—here we
are, after all these months, twelve of
them, and we still stick doggedly to
the same unswerving resolution. No-
thing can alter it. That's what I call
tenacity of purpose.
You don't think I'm serious 2 But
I am. I'm just as serious as I was
last year. This year I shall give up
smoking. Only I think you ought to
give up your hot-water bottle in sym-
pathy. You won't 2 No, I know you
won't. You're a slave of the bottle,
you see. It doesn't do you any harm 2
Oh, yes it does. It makes your back-
bone flabby, and it makes you suscepti-
ble to colds, and it gives you chilblains,
and, anyhow, it's morally pernicious,
because it's an indulgence . . . If I’d
known you were a hot-water-bottle
woman before we were married . . .
However, we needn't go into that. But
if you won't give up your bottle I
shan't give up smoking after all.
Look, they're opening the windows.
We shall all catch cold. Can you hear
anything?... I can hear those people
eating. What a draught ! Can you
hear anything? I can hear the eaters
quite plainly now. Here comes Father
Christmas. I believe he is going to
give us all gifts.
Can you hear anything yet? I have
been given a diary. What have you
got 2 Another diary 2 Is yours for
1921? So is mine. How dull ! Christ-
mas will be on a Sunday next year, I
see. So will our wedding-day. I hope
you'll remember it this time. And
they have arranged for the Spring to
begin on March 21st. Think of it!
Spring—in less than three months
There they go.
Hoot out, wild hooters, to the wild sky!
What a jolly noise! Much better than
bells, really much more accurate as an ex-
pression of one's feelings. There's a sort
of “faint but pursuing ” note about it.
And that's how I feel, rather. It was
a dreadful year, really, wasn't it?—
that last one, I mean. No money, no
clothes—nothing but rates and dentists
and small accounts respectfully sub-
mitted for our esteemed favour. One
long crisis. . . . But we kept the flag
flying. This year— -
Hallo! somebody's going to recite.
What do you think it will be 2 You'll
never guess. Yes, you're quite right.
Ring out a slowly-dying cause
And ancient forms of party strife.
That sounds like a bit of Government
propaganda. Disgraceful, I call it. If
I was a Wee Free
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners—
That's a hit at somebody, too, I
shouldn't wonder. Somebody must have
written a topical verse for the occasion.
Those people are still eating. I expect
they are doing Hog-money, or whatever .
it is. . º
Are you still as obstinate as ever
about that hot-water bottle? Very well,
then, I shall now have the first smoke
of the New Year. Oh, no; we've got
to do Auld Lang Syne first. I never
can smoke while I'm singing.
“Should auld acquaintance . . .

ELIZABETH'S CHRISTMAS.
“I’ve always thort 'ow I'd love to
'ave a reel nice Christmas,” remarked
Elizabeth—“a jolly proper kind o' one,
you know, 'm.”
“Don’t you find Christmas a pleasant
time, then 2" I inquired.
“Well, you see, 'm, I bin in service
ever since I was turned fifteen, an' you
know wot Christmas in service is. An
extry tip, I will say, but a lot of extry
work to go along with it—and wot
washin' up! Some'ow it orl seems so
different in books an' on the pictures.”
She sighed as she spoke and a look
that was almost human crept into the
arid region of her countenance. A
feeling of compunction swept over me.
Was it possible that this poor simple
girl concealed depths of conviviality in
her nature and a genial disposition
which I, in common with all her former
employers, had carelessly overlooked 2
I will admit that this unexpected phase
in Elizabeth's character touched and
interested me.
“Elizabeth,” I cried in a sudden glow
of enthusiasm, “you shall have your
jolly Christmas–1 will provide it. You
shall have your turkey, plum-pudding,
mince-pies, crackers, mistletoe and all
the rest of it.” Cheeryble in his most
beneficent mood could not have felt
more expansive than I did just then.
“You can invite your friends; we shall
not be at home, so you will have the
place to yourself.”
“Lor!” she ejaculated. “D'ye reerly
mean it, 'm 2"
“I do, Elizabeth. Let me know the
sort of Christmas you've always longed
for and I'll see that you get it.”
She drew up her lank form and her
face shone. “Well, 'm, I don’t know
where you get 'em, but for one thing
I’ve often thort as 'ow I'd like to 'ave
a festlebord.”
“What's that?” I asked, puzzled.
“Is it in the Stores' list 2"
“I don't know, 'm, but there's always
a lot about it in the books. When
the Squire's son comes 'ome repentant
at Christmas-tide they always gathers
round a festlebord and rejoices.”
I began to see light. “You mean a
‘festal board '2'''
“That's wot I sed, 'm.”
“Well, you shall have one, Elizabeth,
I'll see to that. I'd let you have a
Squire's son as well, but unfortunately
the only ones I know are not repentant
—as yet. And now tell me which of
your friends you would like to invite.”
“There's my sister-in-lor 'ud like to
come—'er that I 'aven't been on speak-
in’ terms with for five years—but she
shan't. An' my friend isn't comin'; I'll
see to that arter the things she sed
about me to my young man's cousin–
sorcy baggage! As for my two aunts
they don't set foot under the same roof
as me arter the way * *
“Never mind about the people you're
not inviting,” I broke in ; “we don't
need a list of them. Who do you want
to come 2''
“Well, there's Mrs. Spurge, the
char—a real nice lady, as you know,
'm. Then I'd like to arsk Polly, the
sister of the cook wot lives in the 'ouse
at the corner with red 'air; an' there 's
Mary Baxter. An' isn't it lucky my
sailor-brother will be 'ome for the first
time in ten years? Can 'e come too,
'm 2 'E's been round the world twice.”
“In that case, Elizabeth, he certainly
ought to be invited. He may even have
returned home repentant, so you will
be able to rejoice at the festal board in
proper style.”
“Oh, 'm, isn't it luverly? I won't
'arf have a beano this Christmas. Wot

blithesome Christmas. Henry's aunt,
who invited us, is rich, but she is also
dull, and several times I found myself
rather envying Elizabeth. While Aunt
Jane nodded in her chair, Henry and
I pictured those boisterous revels of
Elizabeth and her friends, their bound-
less mirth, their unrestrained gaiety.
We imagined them too gathered round
the sailor-brother, listening with rapt
delight as he told them stories of the
far-off wonder-lands he had known.
Henry sighed then and said there were
times when he envied the so-called
lower classes their capacity for enjoy-
ment.
When we returned home Elizabeth
greeted us with beaming countenance.
“I'ope you'ad a good time,” she said;
“I know I 'ad.”
“Then it really was as nice as you
thought it would be, Elizabeth 2"
“It was first-rate, 'm. Leastways
orl went well until arter dinner, when
we begins chippin’ each other and ends
in 'avin' a few words. My sailor-
brother started it by chaffin' Polly
about 'er red 'air an' arskin' why she
didn't cut it orf, an’ she told 'im then
that if 'e'd such an objection to red she
wondered 'e didn't cut 'is own nose orf.
Arter that one thing led to another; we
took sides an' ->
“Oh, Elizabeth, you don't mean to
say you quarrelled?" I interrupted sor-
rowfully.
“Oh, no, it wasn't quarrellin', 'm—

ended in Polly an' Mary an' my brother
goin' off early. I was chilly to Mrs.
Spurge owin' to 'er 'avin' said that she
didn't believe my sailor-brother'd ever
been further than Wapping in a coal-
barge. I shouldn't 'ave spoke to 'er
again that evenin’ if the book 'adn't
brought us together again friendly,

“What book?” I asked, bewildered.
“One of yours that I got out of the
study, 'm. Oh, wot a book! Sorter

laughed an' I cried over it, turn about.
So did Mrs. Spurge. You see we read
bits out to each other—kep it up till
three o'clock in the mornin', we did.
It was luverly 1”
“And what was the book called 2 "I
inquired.
“It's called A Christmas Car’l, 'm,
by Mr. DickINGs. Why didn't no-
body tell me about it afore? It's far
better 'n the pictures. “Just like
'eaven,' Mrs. Spurge said.”
“I’m glad you enjoyed yourself,
Elizabeth.”
“It's the 'appiest Christmas I ever
'ad, 'm. That there Mr. DICKINGs is

UNFINISHED DRAWING FOR “PUNCH."
THE FIGURE OF THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SRETCHED ON THE MORNING OF HIS DEATH.
ILLUSTRATE IS NOT KNOWN.
BY THE LATE F. H. TOWNSEND.
THE LEGEND WHICH THIS PICTURE WAS To
MAYBIRDS.
I CAN see some justification for keep-
ing peacocks, especially if you have
shaven lawns and terraces and sun-
dials, though sundials, I imagine, are
rather a nuisance now-a-days, because
of the trouble of having them reset for
summer and winter time. Peacocks at
any rate are beautiful, and, if their voices
are apt in England to become a little
hoarse, that is only because they screech
when the weather is going to be bad.
The pheasant is also a useful and
beautiful fowl. One may put down
bread-crumbs to attract the pheasant
to one's garden when he is alive, or to
one's plate when he is dead.
But I can see no justification what-
ever for keeping maybirds, for they
are neither useful nor beautiful. Per-
haps you do not know what a maybird
is. I have five maybirds. I have them
because people here would keep saying
to me, “Look at the price of fresh eggs,
and how much nicer it is to have your
own.” It is a curious thing about the
country that people are always giving
one disinterested advice in the matter
of domestic economy. In London it is
different. In London people let you
take a twopenny bus ticket to West-
minster instead of walking across the
Park, and go to ruin in your own sweet
way. They rather admire your dash.
But in the country they tell you about
these things. -
So I went to a man and confessed to
him my trouble about fresh eggs.
“I see,” he said: “you want may-
birds.”
“No, I don't,” I said; “I want hens.”
“It's the same thing,” he told me.
“How many would you like?”
“Five,” I said. I thought five would
be an unostentatious number and make
it clear that I was not trying to com-
pete with the wholesale egg-dealers.
He segregated five maybirds and ex-
plained their points to me.
It appeared that one of them was a
Buff Orpington and three were white
Wyandottes and one had no particular
politics. I should say now that it was
an Independent. It has speckles and is
the one that keeps getting into the
garden.
I asked him when the creatures
would begin to enter upon their new
duties, and he said they would do so at
Once.
“What is their maximum egg-laying
velocity ?” I inquired.
“They'll lay about three eggs a day
between them,” he said, “these five
birds.”
“Why between them 2 " I enquired.
But I consented to buy his birds, and
he said if I liked he would run round
to my garden at once and run up a hen-
house and a hen-run for me. “Run”
seemed rather a word with him.
I said, “Yes, by all means.”
He came round that evening and
hewed down an apple-tree under the
light of the moon to make room for
the maybird-run, and in the morning
he brought a large roll of wire-netting,
and the next day he built a wooden
house, and the day after that he brought
his five maybirds, and the day after
that he came round and asked for some
cinders. He sprinkled these all over
the enclosure, and I watched him while
he worked.
“What is that for 2 " I asked.
“They want something to scratch in
when they run about,” he explained.
“Exercise is what they need.”
“They seem to be scratching already,
but they don't seem to be running,” I
said. “Wouldn't it have been better
to put a cinder-track all round the
edge and train them to run races round
it 2 ''
He said that he hadn't thought of
that, but I could try it if I liked. Then
he gave me a bag of food, which he
said was particularly efficacious for
maybirds, and produced his bill.
All this happened about a month ago,
and for the last four weeks the prin-
cipal preoccupation of my household
has been the feeding of these five birds.
I have had to lay a gravel-path from

the aviary to the back premises in order
to sustain the weight of the traffic.
Huge bowls of hot food are constantly
being mixed and carried to them, with-
out any apparent consciousness on their
part of their reciprocal responsibilities.
What I mean to say is that there are
no eggs. The food which they eat re-
sembles Christmas-pudding at the time
when it is stirred, and I have suggested
that a sixpence should be concealed in
it every now and then—sixpence being
apparently the current price of an egg
—in order to indicate the nature of
our hopes.
I have made other valuable sug-
gestions. I have suggested putting an
anthracite stove in their sitting-room,
and papering the walls with illustrations
representing various methods of mass
production, ordinary methods having
failed. I notice that cabbages are sus-
pended by a string across the top of the
parade-ground in order that the birds
may obtain exercise by springing at
them. The cabbages are eaten, but I
do not believe that the birds jump. I
believe that they clamber up the wire
with their claws, walk along the tight-
rope and bite the cabbage off with their
teeth.
Sometimes, as I think I have men-
tioned, the one with speckles escapes
into the garden, and I have several
times been asked to chase it home.
Nothing makes one look more ridiculous
than chasing an independent maybird of
no particular views across an onion bed.
The rest of the animals appear to spend
most of their time in walking about the
run with their hands in their pockets
looking for things on the ground.
But every now and then one or other
of them makes the loud cry which is
usually associated with successful egg-
production; the whole household troops
beaming with anticipation along the
gravel-path; and it is then discovered
that the Buff has knocked one of the
Whites off her perch, or that one of
the Whites has scratched a cinder on
which the Buff had set her eye, or that
the Independent member has made a
bitter speech which is deeply resented
by the Coalition. But there are no
eggs.
About a week ago the corn which
apparently forms a part of the neces-
sary nourishment of maybirds, and is
kept in an outhouse, was attacked by
rats. I was told that I must do some-
thing about this. I buttered some
slices of bread with arsenic and laid
them down on the outhouse floor. The
rats ate the bread and arsenic and went
on with the corn. Unless a great im-
provement is manifested in the New
Year I have decided to butter the may-
birds with arsenic and place them in
the outhouse too. Evoe.

LETTERS I NEVER POSTED.
CONCERNING GOOD RESOLUTIONS.
To THE GIRL AT THE Exchange.
THE New Year is upon us and with
it comes the determination to mend
our bad habits and make serious efforts
to turn over a new leaf. Perhaps you
have already thought of this and have
made some good resolutions; perhaps,
on the other hand, you cannot think of
anything amiss that needs correcting.
In this case will you let me help you?
In every other respect you may be per-
fection, but as an exchange operator,
which is the only capacity in which
(alas!) I know you, you are often lack-
ing. I have no doubt that you are
charming in private life and that we
should get on famously if we met at
dinner; but you have an irritating way
of giving me the wrong number, which
I do most cordially hope you will lose
during 1921. When I protest, you
merely say you are sorry, but what I
suggest is that an ounce of careful list-
ening at first is worth tons of sorrow
later. Kingston doesn't really sound
a bit like Brixton, and yet yesterday,
when I asked for a Kingston number,
you put me at once on to the same
number in the other suburb. Con-
stantly when I say I want 2365 you
give me 2356. - To give you your due
you are always, I will admit, sorry;
but . . .
Another thing. Sometimes, when you
ring me up and I answer, all you do is
to ask, “Number, please,” as though I
had rung you. (It is then that I feel
most that I should like to wring you.)
When I reply, “But you rang me,”
you revert to your prevailing regretful
melancholy and say, “Sorry you were
troubled,” and before I can go deeply
into the question and discover how
these things occur you ring off. Can't
you make an effort during 1921 not to
do this? Let it be a year of gladness.
Sometimes I am perfectly certain you
don't ring up the number I want until
after you have asked me once or twice
if they have answered. Isn't that so?
“I’ll ring them again,” you say with
a kind of resigned adventurousness; but,
knowing as i do that they have been
waiting for my call, I am not taken in.
But what I want to know is—what
were you doing instead of ringing up
at first? I suppose that these secrets
will never be penetrated by the ordin-
ary subscriber outside the sacred pre-
cincts; but I wish you would give me
fewer of such problems to ponder dur-
ing the year that is coming.
P.S.—Have you ever considered, with
proper alarm, what would happen to a
cinema story if a wrong number were
provided by the operator, or if any
delay whatever occurred 2 This should
make you think.
To A RACING Journalist.
I suggest that you should include
among your good resolutions for the
New §. the decision not to allow
your readers to participate in your
special information as to which horse
will come in first. Tell them all you
like about yesterday's sport, but dangle
no more “security tips" before their
diminishing purses. If they must bet
—which of course they must, as betting
is now the principal national industry
—let them at least have the fun of
selecting the “also-ran” themselves.
To MANY AN EDITOR.
In contemplating your 1921 pro-
gramme of regeneration could you not
make a vow to dispense with all head-
lines that ask questions? Probably you
never see the paper yourself and there-
fore have no feeling in the matter, but
I can assure you that the habit can be-
come very wearisome. “Will it freeze
to-day?” “Can Beckett win?” “Will
Hobbs reach his 3,000 runs 2 " “Are
the Lords going to pass the Bill?”
Won't you make an effort to do with-
out this formula? It is futile in itself
and has the unfortunate effect of raising

what surely are undesirable doubts as
to whether journalists are any more
sensible than their readers.
To ONE EDITOR IN PARTICULAR.
No comic hats in 1921, please.
To THE P.M.G.
There is, as everyone (except possibly
Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN and the cynic
who professes to hate letters so much
that he wishes that they cost a shilling
a-piece to send) will agree, one good
resolution which above all others you
should concentrate upon for 1921, and
that is to get back our penny postage.
With so many comparatively unneces-
sary things still untaxed, it never should
have been sacrificed.
To A Pork BUTCHER.
Among the problems of this latter
day of discontents few are more press-
ing than speculating as to why sausages
and pork-pies have so degenerated.
Under the malign influence of Peace,
sausages have become tasteless and
pork-pies nothing but pies with pork
in them; the crust chiefly plaster-of-
Paris, and the meat not an essential
element, soft and seductive and fused
with the pastry, but an alien assort-
ment of half-cooked cubes. I can under-
stand that after a great war a certain
deterioration must set in, but I fail to
see why sausages and pork-pies, if made
at all, should not be made as well as
ever, especially as you get such a long
price for them. Couldn't you—wouldn't
you—try in 1921 to make them with
some at least of the old care?
To A CABINET MINISTER.
Might not a vow against writing for
the papers be rather a nice one to ob-
serve during 1921? It is quite on the
cards that one's duties to the State
(not too inadequately paid for) ought
to be sufficiently exacting to preclude
journalism at all. There's a question
of dignity too, although I hesitate to
drag that in.
To THE CHIEF of THE PolicE.
Couldn't you (I.hope I am address-
ing the right gentleman) arrange that
before 1921 becomes 1922—twelve whole
months—a simple device is made for
taxis by which a square of red glass
can be slipped over one of the lamps at
night to indicate that the cab is free?
I'm sure it wouldn't really be difficult,
and the comfort of London would be
enormously increased.
To A TAXI-DRIVER,
You will perhaps note what I have
just said to the Chief of the Police. If
you had any interest in your work you
would, of course, long since have fixed
up something of the kind for yourself.
But let that pass. All I am suggesting
to you as a 1921 amendment is that
you should bank in a more accessible
part of your clothing. Waiting for
change in this weather (especially with
the flag still down) can be an exas-
perating experience. Won't you make
a resolution during the coming year to
keep your money nearer the surface?

THE BARKER THAT MISSED FIRE.
ON hearing a shuffle of feet in the
porch and the clearing of little throats,
I exclaimed, “Those carols again!” If
between “those " and “carols” I in-
serted another word, I withdraw it.
I went into the hall and barked like
a dog.
I have often said that, if anyone
could earn a hundred pounds a week
on the stage by barking like a dog, I
could. Children like to come to my
house to tea merely for the thrill of
listening to my imitation. I used to
flatter myself that I could bark like a
dog even better than NELsoN KEYs can
imitate GERALD DU MAURIER.
I hardly gave the carol-singers time
even to mention Royal David's city
before I barked. Instantly one pair of
little feet scuttled away towards the
gate; then a voice called, “Don’t be
silly, Alfy; come on back.”
Two small girls stood at the front-
door as I opened it. One of them
smiled up at me and said, “He thinks
he's going to be bit.” She appeared
to be amused by the idea. Down by
the gate was a small muffled figure
carrying a Chinese lantern. “Come on
back, Alfy,” she called again, “and let's
sing to the gentleman. You see,” she
|explained to me in confidence, “he's
ot addleoids and can't sing loud, so we
let him hold the lantern.”
I was beginning to feel sorry that I
had played a trick on such inoffensive
children and was about to assure them
that my savage bull-terrier was safely
locked up in the kitchen when the brave
little lass began chattering again.
“My dad keeps dogs—all sorts,” she
told me, “and sells them to gentlemen.
So I'm used to dogs.” Then she turned
once more to the lantern-bearer and
commanded, “Now come on and sing,
Alfy. It ain't a dog at all; it's only
the gentleman trying to make a noise
like one.” -
“Rod Iron Red Mail Bird, year old; good
breed; 16s.”—Provincial Paper.
We fancy it must be an armour-clad
rooster of this species that, crossed
with a Plymouth Rock, was respon-
sible for the reinforced-concrete chicken
that we met at dinner the other night.
“When once the exchanges of the world
have righted themselves—and that is bound
to come about sooner or later—then will
follow such a reaction in the trade of the
country that will exceed the expectations of
the most sanguinary optimist.”—Trade Paper.
We think this must be intended as a
hit at Trotsky.
NEW RHYMES FOR OLD CHILDREN.
THE OYSTER.
THE oyster takes no exercise;
I don't believe she really tries;
And since she has no legs
I don't see why she should, do you?
Besides, she has a lot to do—
She lays a million eggs.
At any rate she doesn't stir;
Her food is always brought to her.
But sometimes through her open lips
A horrid little creature slips
Which simply will not go;
...And that annoys the poor old girl;
It means she has to make a pearl—
It irritates, you know;
So, crooning some small requiem,
She turns the thing into a gem.
And when I meet the wives of Earls
With lovely necklaces of pearls
It makes me see quite red;
For every jewel on the chain
Some patient oyster had a pain
And had to stay in bed.
To think what millions men can make
Out of an oyster's tummy-ache!

Monday, December 20th.-As the re-
sult of being tossed backwards and
forwards between the two Houses the
Government of Ireland Bill had already
lost most of its awkward corners. The
last two were rounded off to-day, when
the Government secured that Southern
Ireland should have three years, instead
of two, in which to make up her mind
whether to accept or refuse the prof-
fered Parliament, and that in the mean-
time only a joint resolution of both
Houses should prevent the Act from
coming into operation. Lord MIDLE-
ToN pressed hard for a retention of the
Lords' veto, but was thrown overboard
by Lord CREWE, who was greatly im-
pressed by the Lord CHANCELLOR's
reminder that within three years there
must be a General Election.
In the Commons Sir RoPERT HoRNE
performed his customary Monday dance
among the fiscal egg-shells. He de-
clined to give an estimate as to the
number of British workmen unem-
ployed owing to the importation of
German goods—“no man who breathes
could do it"—and judiciously evaded
` acceptance of Sir FREDERICK HALL's
MR. CHURCHILL.
suggestion that one reason why Teuton
manufacturers were snapping up Do-
minion contracts was that their em-
ployés worked eleven hours a day.
The close of one of the longest and
weariest sessions on record finds the
Government in a penitent mood. How
long will it last? The PRIME MINISTER
told one of his supporters that he hoped
next year's programme would be less
exacting, and immediately promised
another measure dealing with dumping
and exchange; and when Sir F. BAN-
BURY helpfully suggested that the surest
way to avoid an Autumn Session would
be to introduce fewer Bills Mr. BoNAR
LAw turned on him with the retort
that “a surer way would be to introduce
none.”
An amusing duel between well-
matched opponents took place over
liquor control. Mr. MAcquistEN, whose
voice, at once insinuating and penetra-
tive, has been likened to a corkscrew,
urged that the bond-fide frequenters of
public-houses should be consulted in the
settlement of the drink regulations. The
present arrangement, in his view, was
like entrusting the regulation of the
Churches to avowed atheists. Lady
AsTor made full use of her shrill treble
in retorting that it was the “victims”
—by which apparently she meant the
wives of Mr. MACQUISTEN's protégés—
who ought to have the last word. She
herself had it in the series of incredulous
“Oh's!”—uttered crescendo on a rising
scale and accompanied by appropriate
gesture—with which she received Mr.
MACQUISTEN's confident assertion that
the working-men's clubs are the enemies
of “the Trade.”
Supplementary Estimates produced
a good deal of miscellaneous informa-
tion. On the Vote for Road Transport
Colonel MILDMAY attacked the system
of tar-spraying and told a melancholy
story of a cow that skidded with fatal
results. He was backed up by Sir F.
BANBURY, who said that he had found
the ideal pavement in soft wood and
awakened memories of an ancient jest
by suggesting that something might
be done if he and the MINISTER of
TRANspoRT were to put their heads
together.

the desecration of the Nelson Column
by the delivery of seditious speeches.
Sir, JoHN BAIRD explained that it was
impossible to know beforehand what sort
of speech was going to be delivered. But
his critic would have none of this paltry
excuse. “Did not the regulations pro-
vide,” he boomed, “that the objects of
the meetings must be specified?” For-
tunately for the Minister, who had nearly
been blown off the Treasury Bench, Mr.
Hogg|E came to the rescue. “Is it not
a fact,” he inquired, “that the monu-
ment was erected to a man who turned
a blind eye to orders?”
The strange case of Lord Rother-
MERE and the Committee on Public
Accounts was further investigated. The
Committee had reported that a certain
stationery contract for the Air Ministry
had been extravagant and improper.
The AIR MINISTER at the time was the
noble Lord who has lately been so elo-
quent about “squander-mania,” but he
has since, in a letter to the Press, de-
clared that he never signed or initialled
the order. Lieut.-Colonel ARCHER-SHEE
and Mr. ORMSBY - GoRE sought the
opinion of the Treasury on the trans-
action, and Mr. BALDw1N replied that
it was certainly usual for a Minister to
be held responsible for his expenditure,
and that if subordinate officials were
thrown over by their chiefs it would be
bad for the Service.
The Lords' amendments to the Com-
mons' amendments to the Lords' amend-
ments to the Government of Ireland
Bill were agreed to. Sir L. WoRTHING-
ToN-Evans thought to improve the oc-
casion by a neat little speech expressing
goodwill to Ireland, and, much to his
surprise, found himself in collision with
the SPEAKER, who observed that this
was not the time for First Reading
speeches.
It was rather hard on Lord PEEL, as
the grandson of the great Sir RoPERT,
to have to sponsor the Dyestuffs Bill.
He frankly described it as “a disagree-
able pill.” Lord EMMoTT and other Peers
showed a strong disinclination to take
their medicine, but Lord MoULTON said
that the chemists—naturally enough—
were all in favour of it, and persuaded
the House to swallow the bolus.
In the course of an eleventh-hour
effort to destroy the Agriculture Bill
Lord LIN colNSHIRE described the PRIME

of his motion.

AT THE PLAY.
“PETER PAN.”
Peter Pan, the play, must by now
have long overtaken the age of Peter
Pan, the boy; but, like him, it never
grows any older. The cast may change,
but that seems to make hardly any
difference. The new Peter (Miss EDNA
BEST) is as good as any of them.
Graceful of shape and lithe of limb, he
is still essentially a boy, the realised
figure of BARRIE’s fancy; a little aloof
and inscrutable; romantic, too, in his
very detachment from the sentiment of
romance that he provokes. Miss FREDA
GoDFREY, the new Wendy, would have
seemed good if we had not known better
ones. To be frank, she looked rather
too mature for the part; she needed a
more childlike air to give piquancy to
her assumption of maternal responsibi-
lities. It was pleasant to see Mr. HENRY
AINLEY unbend to the task, simple for
him, of playing Captain Hook and Mr.
Darling. One admired his self-control
in refusing to impose new subtleties
upon established and sacred tradition.
Of familiar friends, age has not with-
ered the compelling charms of Mr. SHEL-
ToN's Smee, nor, in the person of Mr.
CLEAVE, has custom staled the infinite
futility of Slightly. I was glad, too, to
find Miss SYBIL CARLISLE back in the
part of Mrs. Darling, which she played
most appealingly.
The lagoon scene was cut out this
year; perhaps it was thought that there
is enough lagoon in London just now.
I could more willingly have spared the
business of Mr. Darling and the kennel,
the one blot in the play. My impres-
|sion of this grotesquerie has not changed
since I first saw Peter Pan.
Among new impressions was a feel-
ing that the domestic details of the
First Act are a little too leisurely, so
that I appreciated the impatience of
my little neighbour for the arrival of
Peter Pan, whose acquaintance she had
still to make. Also from the presence
of children in my party I became con-
scious how much of the humour of the
play—its burlesque, for example, of
the stage villain—is only seizable by
children who have grown up. BARRIE
wrote it, of course, to please the eternal
child in himself, but forgot now and
then what an unusual child it was.

BEHIND its pendent curtain folds
We know not what the future holds;
We only know that worlds have gone
Since Chu Chin Chow was first put on.
Mid all our stress and strife and change
This strikes me as extremely strange;
I think when plays go on like this
There ought to be an artistice.
But, when we have another war
After the peace we’ve toiled so for,
And empires break and thrones are bust
And nations tumble in the dust,
And culture, rising from the East,
On tottering Europe is released,
And Chinamen at last shall rule
In Dublin, Warsaw and Stamboul,
Soon as the roar of cannon ends .
And all men once again are friends,
I must fulfil my ancient vow
And go and visit Chu Chin Chow.
ST. CECILIA OF CREMONA.
Punch has no desire to plunge into
the controversy which has arisen over
the employment of women in profes-
sional orchestras, especially as the cause
has already been practically won, and
here, at any rate, the saying, “What
Lancashire thinks to-day England will
think to-morrow,” has failed to justify
itself. The example of Manchester is
not being followed in London, and what
is deemed advisable for the Free Trade
Hall in one city is not to dominate the
policy of the Queen's Hall in the other.
But without going into the argu-
able points of this latest duel of the
sexes, Mr. Punch, already in the last
year which completes his fourth score,
may be allowed to indulge in an old
man's privilege of retrospect and inci-
dentally to congratulate the ladies on
the wonderful and triumphant progress
they have made in instrumental art
since the roaring 'forties. For in the
'forties women, though still supreme
on the lyric stage, had hardly begun
to assert themselves as executants,
save on the pianoforte. Punch well
remembers Liszt-with the spelling
of whose name he had considerable
difficulty—in his meteoric pianoforti-
tude. But the young WILMA NERUDA,
who visited London in 1849, escaped
his benevolent notice. She was then
only ten. It was not until twenty
years later that, as Madame NorMAN-
NERUDA, she revisited London, proved
that consummate skill could be com-
bined with admirable grace in a woman-
violinist, took her place as a leader of
the quartet at the Monday “Pops,”upset
the tyranny of the pianoforte and harp
as the only instruments suitable for the
young person, and virtually created the
professional woman-violinist. Indeed,
she may be said to have at once made
|the fiddle fashionable and profitable for
girls.
On its invasion of Mayfair the
pencil of DU MAURIER furnishes the
best comment. Before 1869, woman-
violinists were only single spies; now
they are to be reckoned in battalions.
And they no longer “play the easiest
passages with the greatest difficulty,”
as was once said of an incompetent
male pianist, but in all departments of
technique and interpretation have fully
earned Sir HENRY WooD's tribute to
their skill, sincerity and delicacy.
When the eminent conductor goes on,
in his catalogue of their excellences, to
say, “They do not drink, and they
do not smoke as much as men,” he
reminds Mr. Punch of two historic
sayings of a famous foreign conductor.
The first was uttered at a rehearsal
of the Venusberg music from Tann-
häuser: “Gentlemen, you play it as if
you were teetotalers—which you are
not.” The other was his lament over
a fine but uncertain wind-instrument
player: “With it is always Quench,
Quench, Quench.”
Mr. Punch is old-fashioned enough
to hope that, whether teetotalers or
not, the ladies will leave trombones and
tubas severely alone, and confine their
instrumental energies mainly to the
nice conduct of the leading strings—
the aristocrats of the orchestra, the
sovereigns of the chamber concert.
From a butcher's advertisement:—
“SPECIAL PRE-WAR Pork, AND BEEF,
SAUSAGES.”—Local Paper.
While all in favour of old-fashioned
Christmas fare, here we draw the line.
“Enough butter to cover 265,000,000 slices
of bread was produced in Manitoba this year.
Of 8,250,000,000 pounds produced, 4,100,000
has been exported.”—Canadian Paper.
Thirty-one pounds of butter to the slice
is certainly the most tempting induce-
ment to Canadian immigration we have
yet noticed.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I cAN'T help thinking that Mr. H. G. HIBBERT has not
chosen altogether the right name for his second volume of
theatrical and Bohemian gossip, A Playgoer's Memories
(GRANT RICHARDs). It is not so unsophisticated as the
title had somehow led me to expect. Indeed “unsophisti-
cated” is perhaps the last epithet that could justly be applied
to Mr. HIBBERT's memories. I fancy I had unconsciously
been looking for something more in the style of my own
ignorant playgoing. “How wonderful she was in that
scene with the broker's man,” or “Do you remember the
opening of the Third Act 2" Not thus Mr. HIBBERT. For
him the play itself is far less the thing than a peg upon
which to hang all sorts of tags and bobtails of recollection,
financial, technical and just not scandalous because of the
discretion of the telling. His book is a repository of
theatrical information, but the great part of it of more
absorbing concern for the manager's-room or the stage-
I rather wonder, however, that Messrs. HEINEMANN did not
suggest to her that these heterogeneous pages would furnish
excellent material for the experiment.
I have discovered that Miss PEGGY WEBLING has quite
a remarkable talent for making ordinary places and people
seem improbable. She achieves this in Comedy Corner
(HUTCHINsoN) by sketching in her scenery quite competently
and then allowing her characters to live lives, amongst it, so
fraught with coincidence, so swayed by the most unlikely
impulses, that a small draper's shop, a West End “Hattery.”
and an almshouse for old actresses become the most extra-
ordinary places on earth, where anything might happen
and nobody would be surprised. Winnie, her heroine, be-
haves more improbably than anyone else, but she is such a
dear little goose that most amiable readers will be quite
glad that she doesn't have to suffer as much as such geese
would if they existed in real life. You can see from this
that it is one of those books that are full of real niceness
and goodwill, and it has besides plenty of plot and lots of
door than, say, the dress
circle. But I must not be
wanting in gratitude for
the entertainment which,
for all this carping, I cer-
tainly derived from it. As
an expert on stage finance,
for example, to-day and
forty years back, Mr.
HIBBERT has revelations
that may well cause the
least concerned to marvel.
And there is an appendix,
which gives a list of Drury
Lane pantomimes, with
casts, for half a century,
including, of course, the
incomparable first one;
but that is not a memory
of this world. A book to
be kept for odd references

over The Happy Highways
(HEINEMANN) was, I think, its almost entire absence
of highway, and the exceedingly unhappy nature of its
confused and uncharted lanes. Indeed, I am wondering
now if the title may not have been an instance of bitter
irony on the part of Miss StoRM JAMEsoN. Certainly a
more formless mass of writing never within my experience
masqueraded as a novel. There are ideas and reflections
—these last mostly angry and vaguely socialistic—and here
and there glimpses of illusory narrative about a group of
young persons, brothers and a girl-friend, who live at Herne
Hill, attend King's College and talk (oh, but interminably)
the worst pamphlet-talk of the pre-war age. It is, I take
it, a reviewer's job to stifle his boredom and push on
resolutely through the dust to find what good, if any, may
be hidden by it. I will admit therefore some vague interest
in the record of how the War hit such persons as these.
Also (to the credit of the author as tale-teller) she does
allow one of the young men to earn a scholarship, and for
no sane reason to depart instantly thereupon before the mast
of a sailing-ship; also another, the central figure, to fall in
love with the girl. The book is in three parts, of which the
third is superfluously specialized as “chaos.” Whether
Miss JAMEsoN will yet write a story I am unable to say;
speed of a half-mile relay race. I am not going to reveal his
mystery except to say that Tien T'ze was a Chinese organ-
isation which perpetrated crimes, and that Donald Craig,
Kyrle Durand—his secretary (female) and cousin—and Bruce
MacIvor, superintendent of the Criminal Investigation De-
partment, were employed in tracking it down and smashing
it to pieces. Never have I met anyone in fiction (let fact
alone) so clever as Kyrle in getting herself and her friends
out of tight places. When Craig and MacIvor were so
beset by Tien Tze that their last hour seemed to have
come I found myself saying, “It is time for Kyrle to
emerge from her machine,” and she emerged. In a novel
of this genre it is essential that the excitement should
never fall below fever-heat, but Mr. Gordon's book does
better than that ; its temperature would, I think, burst
any ordinary.thermometer.

AS WE SEE OTHERS: A CAND ID APPRECIATION OF U.S.A.
THE liner de luce had swung in past Sandy Hook, and the tender had already come alongside with its mail
and Press-gang. There ensued a furious race to interview the most distinguished passenger, and it was by the repre-
sentative of The Democratic Elevator, who got there first, that the Sage, in the very act of recording the emotions
provoked by his first sky-scraper, was abordé.
“Mr. Punch, I guess?” said he. “Pleased to meet you, Sir. And what do you think of the American nation ?”
“Shall I tell you now,” asked Mr. Punch, “ or wait till I've actually seen it 2"
“Right here,” said the interviewer, and drew his note-book.
“Well,” began Mr. Punch, “I think a good deal of it—I mean, I think a good deal about it. And it
nearly always makes me smile. Of course you won't understand why it nearly always makes me smile, because
we don't see fun in the same things. You don't appreciate our humour, and therefore you say that we haven't
any. And if we don't appreciate your humour that proves again that we haven't any. So you'll never under-
stand why it makes me smile, sometimes gently and sometimes rather bitterly, to think about your nation; but
I'll tell you just the same. -
“In the first place, what you call ‘America' is only a small fraction of the American continent, not
even as large as British North America. And in the second place what you call your “nation’—well, some rude
person once said of it that it isn't really a nation at all, but just a picnic. I won't go so far as that, but
I hardly suppose you will be much better pleased if I call it a League of Nations. That is a phrase that you
hate, because your President WILSON loves it. -
“By the way, I must be very careful how I speak of your President, because you're so sensitive on that
subject. You allow yourselves to abuse him as the head of a political party, but if other nations so much as
question his omniscience he suddenly becomes the Head of a Sovereign State. An English Cabinet Minister once
told me how an American gave vent in conversation to the most violent language in regard to the policy of the
President of the day, and when at the end the Englishman very quietly said, ‘I am inclined to agree with you,'
the American turned on him in a fury, saying: 'Sir, I didn't come here to have my country insulted ' '
“However, to return to your League of Nations. In England (where I come from) they are just now re-
viving a play by Mr. IsrAEL ZANG will, in which, if I recall it rightly, he makes out your country to be the
Melting Pot into which every sort of fancy alien type is thrown, and turned out a pattern American citizen, a
member of a United Family. I wish I could believe it. It seems to us that your German, even after passing
through the Melting Pot, remains a German; that your Irishman, however much he Americanises himself for

purposes of political power and graft, remains an Irishman. You never seem to get together as a nation, except
when you go to war, and even then you don't keep it up, for you're not together now, although you're still at
war with Germany. The rest of the time you seem to spend in having Elections and ‘placating’ (I think that's
what you call it) the German interest, or the negro interest, or the Sinn Fein interest.
“And this brings me to the point that makes me smile most of all—when it doesn't make me weep.
Isn't it a pathetic thing that a really great and strong people like you should be so weak and little as to let
your Press sympathise blatantly with the campaign of murder in Ireland; to suffer that campaign to be actively
assisted by American gunmen; to look on while it is being financed by American money, here employed in con-
junction with the resources of that very Bolshevism which you take care to treat as criminal in your own country?
“Isn't it pitiful that you should regard reprisals (hateful though they may be) as worse than the hideous
murders which provoked them; forgetting your own addiction to lynch law; forgetting too (as some of our own
people forget) that the sanctity of the law depends as much upon the goodwill and assistance of the populace as
it does upon the police, and cannot else be maintained 2
“Indeed your memory is not very good. Your Monroe Doctrine, which insists that nobody from outside
shall interfere with your affairs, escapes you whenever you want to interfere with other people's. You even forget,
at convenient times, your own Civil War. Just as there was not a protest made by you against the methods of
our blockade of Germany for which an answer could not be found in some precedent set by you in that War
of North and South, so now the best answer to your sympathy with the preposterous claims of an Irish Republic
is to be found in those four years in which you fought so bloodily to preserve the integrity of your own Union.
“Yet you let men like DE WALERA go at large proclaiming the brutal tyranny of the alien Saxon and
advertising his country as a Sovereign State—all because you have to ‘placate' the Irish interest. I should very
much like to hear what you would think of us if at our Elections we ran an Anti-You campaign and even made
Intervention a plank in our platform (as one of your Parties did) for the sake of ‘placating' the niggers or the
Cubans or the Filipinos or any other sort of Dago in our midst.
“Of course we are told—and of course I believe it—that the ‘best' American sentiment is all right. But, if so,
it must be cherished by a very select few, or they would never tolerate a condition of things so rotten that, unless
your coming President finds some cure for it, you are like to become the laughing-stock of Europe. I am almost
tempted to go into the Melting Pot myself and show you, as none but an American citizen would ever be allowed
to show you, how it is to be done. Unfortunately I am too busy elsewhere, putting my own country right.
“But to conclude—for I see that we are drawing close to the landing-stage—I do hope that in my
desire to be genial I have not been too flattering. No true friend ever flatters. And in my heart, which has
some of our common blood in it (notoriously thicker than water), I cannot help loving your country, and would
love it better still if only it gave me a better chance. Indeed, I belong at home to a Society for the Promotion
of Anglo-American Friendship. More than that"—and here the Sage was seen to probe into a voluminous and
bulging breast-pocket—“I have brought with me a token of affection designed to stimulate a mutual cordiality.”
“Not a flask of whisky?” exclaimed the representative of The Democratic Elevator, suddenly moved to animation.
“No, not that, not that, my child,” said Mr. Punch, “but something far, far better for you; something that
gives you, among other less serious matter, a record of the way in which we in England, with private troubles
of our own no easier than yours to bear, and exhausted with twice as many years of sacrifice in the War of
Liberty (whose colossal effigy I have just had the pleasure to remark), still try to play an honourable part in
that society of nations from which you have apparently resolved, for your better ease and comfort, to cut your-
selves off. Be good enough to accept, in the spirit of benevolence in which I offer it, this copy of my
@nt juniorth and fifty-Ålinth tolume."

BAD LORD BLIGHT.
(A Moral Story for the Middle-aged.)
I
SEATED in the well-appointed library
of Blight Hall, John Blighter, seven-
teenth Earl of Blight, bowed his head
in his hands and gave himself up to
despair. The day of reckoning had come.
Were appearances not so deceptive,
one would have said that Lord Blight
(“Blight,” as he was known familiarly
to his friends) was a man to be envied.
In a revolving bookcase in the middle
of the spacious library were countless
treasured volumes, including a complete
edition of THACKERAY ; outside in the
well-kept grounds of the estate was a
new lawn-mower; a bottle of sherry,
freshly uncorked, stood upon the side-
board in the dining-room. But worldly
possessions are not everything. An
untroubled mind, as SHAKSPEARE knew
(even if he didn't actually say it), is
more to be valued than riches. The
seventeenth Earl of Blight's mind was
not untroubled. His conscience was
gnawing him.
Some people would say, no doubt,
that his conscience was too sensitive.
True, there were episodes in his past
life of which in later years he could
not wholly approve; but is not this the
case with every one of us? Far better,
as must often have occurred to MILTON,
to strive for the future than to regret
the past. Ten years ago Lord Blight
had been plain John Blighter, with no
prospects in front of him. Realising
that he could expect little help from
others, he decided to push for himself.
He began by pushing three cousins
over the cliffs at Scarborough, thus
becoming second heir to the earldom.
A week later he pushed an elder brother
over the same cliff, and was openly
referred to in the Press as the next
bearer of the title. Barely a fortnight
had elapsed before a final push diverted
the last member of the family (a valued
uncle) into the ever-changing sea, the
venue in this case being Whitby, pre-
sumably in order to avoid suspicion.
But all this had happened ten years
ago. The past is the past, as Words-
worth probably said to ColeRIDGE
more than once. It was time for
Lord Blight to forget these incidents
of his eager and impetuous youth.
Yet somehow he could not. Within
the last few days his conscience had
begun to gnaw him, and in his despair
he told himself that at last the day of
reckoning had come. Poor Blight!
It is difficult to withhold our sympathy
from him.
The door opened, and his wife, the
Countess of Blight, came into the
library.
“Blight !” she whispered. “My poor
Blight! What has happened?”
He looked up haggardly.
“Gertie,” he said, for that was her
name, “it is all over. My sins have
found me out.”
“Not sins,” she said gently.
takes.”
“Mistakes, yes—you are right.” He
stretched out a hand, took a letter from
the desk in front of him and gave it to
her. “Read that.” With a groan he
buried his head in his hands again.
She took it and read, slowly and won-
deringly, these words:–
“To lawn-mower as delivered, £5 176.”
Lord Blight looked up with an im-
“Mis-
patient ejaculation.
“Give it to me,” he said in some
annoyance, snatching it away from her
and throwing it into the waste-paper
basket. “Here, this is the one. Read
it; read it quickly; for we must decide
what to do.”
She read it with starting eyes.
“DEAR SIR,--I am prepared to lend
you anything from £10 to £10,000 on
your note-of-hand alone. Should you
wish 11.
“D–n' " said the seventeenth Earl
of Blight. “Here, where is the blessed
He felt in his pockets.
thing?” “I
Ah,
I had it only a
must have
here it is. Perhaps I had better read
it to you this time.” He put on his
spectacles—a present from an aunt—
and read as follows:–
“My Lord, We regret to inform you
that a claimant to the title has arisen.
It seems that, soon after the death of his
first wife, the sirteenth Earl of Blight
contracted a second and secret marriage
to Ellen Podby, by whom he had eleven
sons, the eldest of whom is now asserting
his right to the earldom and estates.
Trusting to be favoured with your in-
structions in the matter, we are, my Lord,
Yours faithfully, -
BILLINGs, BILLINGs dº BILLINGs."
Gertie (Countess of Blight) looked at
her husband in horror.
“Eleven!” she cried.
“Eleven,” said the Earl gloomily.
Then a look of grim determination
came into his eyes. With the air of
one who might have been quoting
KEATs, but possibly wasn't, he said
firmly —
“What man has done, man can do.”
That evening the Countess of Blight
gave orders for eleven spare bedrooms
to be got ready.
II.
On the morning after the arrival of the
eleven “Podbys,” John, seventeenth
Earl of Blight, spoke quite frankly to
Algernon, the eldest.
“After all, my dear Algernon,” he

said, “we are cousins. There is no
need for harsh words between us. All
I ask is that you should forbear to make
your claim until I have delivered my
speech in the House of Lords on the
Coast Frosion Bill, upon which I feel
deeply. Once the Bill is through, I
shall be prepared to retire in your favour.
Meanwhile let us all enjoy together
the simple pleasures of Blight Hall.”
Algernon, a fair young man with a
meaningless expression, replied suitably.
So for some days the eleven “Podbys”
gave themselves up to pleasure. Percy,
the youngest, though hardly of an age
to appreciate the mechanism of it, was
allowed to push the lawn-mower;
Lancelot and Herbert, who had
inherited the Podby intellect, were
encouraged to browse around the
revolving bookcase, from which
they frequently extracted one of
the works of THACKERAY, replacing
it again after a glance at the title-
page; while on one notable occa-
sion the Earl of Blight took Alger-
non into the dining-room at about
11.31 in the morning and helped
him to a glass of sherry and a slice
of sultana cake. In this way the
days passed happily, and confi-
dence between theeleven"Podbys”
and their cousin was established.
It was on a fair spring morn-
ing, just a week after their arrival,
that the Countess of Blight came
into the music-room, where Alger-
non was humming a tune, and
said, “Ah, Algernon, my husband
was looking for you. I think he
has some little excursion to pro-
pose. What a charming day, is .
it not ? You will find him in the
library.” -
As Algernon entered the library,
Lord Blight looked up from the
map he was studying and nodded.
“I thought,” he said, coming
to the point at once, “that it
might amuse you to drive over
with me to Flamborough Head. The
view from the top of the cliff is con-
sidered well worth a visit. I don't know
if your tastes lie in that direction at all?”
Algernon was delighted at the idea,
and replied that nothing would give
him greater pleasure than to accompany
Lord Blight.
“Excellent. Perhaps we had better
take some sandwiches and make a day
of it.”
Greatly elated at the thought of a
day by the sea, Lord Blight went out
and gave instructions to the Countess
for sandwiches to be cut.
“In two packets, my love,” he added,
“in case Algernon and I get separated.”
Half-an-hour later they started off
together in high spirits.
::: ::: : :::
It was dark before the seventeenth
Earl of Blight returned to the house
and joined the others at the dinner-
table. His face wore a slightly worried
expression.
“The fact is, my dear,” he said, in
answer to a question from the Countess,
“I am a little upset about Algernon.
I fear we have lost him.” º
“Algernon 2" said the Countess in
surprise.
“Yes. We were standing at the top
of Flamborough Head, looking down
into the sea, when ” He paused and
tapped his glass. “Sherry, Jenkins,”
he said, catching the butler's eye.
“I beg pardon, my lord.”
“—when poor Algernon stumbled
and—— Do any of you boys know if
your brother can swim?”
Everard, the ninth, said that Algernon
had floated once in the Paddington
Baths, but couldn't swim.
“Ah I was hoping—— But in
any case, coming into the water from
that height Well, well, we must
face our troubles bravely. Another
glass of sherry, Jenkins.”
As they passed through the hall on
their way to the drawing-room, Lord
Blight stopped a moment at the ameroid
barometer and gave it an encouraging
tap. - -
“It looks like another fine day to-
morrow,” he said to Cuthbert, the
second Podby. “The panorama from
the Scalby cliffs is unrivalled. we
might drive over and have a look at it.”
III.
Fortunately the weather held up. A
week later the Podby family had been
thinned down to five, and the seven-
teenth Earl of Blight was beginning to
regain his usual equanimity. His health
too was benefiting by the constant sea-
air and change; for, in order that no
melancholy associations should cast a
gloom over their little outings, he took
care to visit a different health-resort
each time, feeling that no expense or
trouble should be spared in a matter of
this kind. It was wonderful with
what vigour and alertness of mind
he sat down in the evenings to
the preparation of his speech on
the Coast Erosion Bill.
One night after dinner, when
all the “Podby” family (Basil and
Percy) had retired to bed, Gertie
(Countess of Blight) came into her
husband's library and, twirling the
revolving bookcase with restless
fingers, asked if she could inter-
rupt him for a moment.
“Yes?” he said, looking up at
her.
“I am anxious, Blight,” she an-
swered. “Anxious about Percy.”
“So am I, my love,” he re-
sponded gravely. “I fear that to-
morrow"—he consulted a leather
pocket-book—“no, the day after
to-morrow, something may hap-
pen to him. I have an uneasy
feeling. It may be that I am
superstitious. Yet something tells
me that in the Book of Fate the
names of Percy and Bridlington"
—he consulted his diary again—
“yes, Bridlington; the names, as
I was saying, of * * *
She interrupted him with an
impatient gesture. -
“You misunderstand me,” she
said. “That is not why I am
anxious. I am anxious because of some-
thing I have just learnt about Percy.
I am afraid he is going to be—”
“Troublesome 2 " 'suggested Lord
Blight.
She nodded.
“I have learnt to-day,” she explained,
“that he has a horror of high places.”
“You mean that on the cliffs of, as
it might be, Bridlington some sudden
unbridled terror may cause him to hurl
himself * *
“You will never get him to the cliffs
of Bridlington. He can't even look out
of a first-floor window. He won't walk
up the gentlest slope. That is why he is
always playing with the lawn-mower.”
The Earl frowned and tapped on his
desk with a penholder.
“This is very grave news, Gertie.”

he said. “How is it that the boy
comesto have this unmanly weakness?”
“It seems he has always had it.”
“He should have been taken in hand.
Even now perhaps it is not too late.
It is our duty to wean him from these
womanish apprehensions.” *
“Too late. Unless you carried him
up there in a sack——”
“No, no,” protested the Earl vigor-
ously. “My dear, the seventeenth Earl
of Blight carrying a sack! Impossible!”
For a little while there was silence
while they brooded over the tragic news.
“Perhaps,” said the Countess at
last, “there are other ways. It may
be that Percy is fond of fishing.”
Lord Blight shifted uncomfort-
ably in his seat. When he spoke it
was with a curiously apologetic air.
“I am afraid, my dear,” he said,
“that you will think me foolish.
No doubt I am. You must put it
down to the artistic temperament.
But I tell you quite candidly that
it is as impossible for me to lose
Percy in a boating accident as it
would be for—shall Isay?–CARUso
to appear as Hamlet or a violinist
to wish to exhibit at the Royal
Academy. One has one's art, one's
medium of expression. It is at the
top of the high cliff with an open
view of the sea that I express my-
self best. Also,” he added with
some heat, “I feel strongly that
what was good enough for Percy's
father, ten brothers, three half-
brothers, not to mention his cousin,
should be good enough for Percy.”
The Countess of Blight moved
sadly from the room. - -
“Well,” she said as she stopped
for a moment at the door, “we
must hope for the best. Perhaps
Percy will overcome this aversion
in time. You might talk seriously
to him to-morrow about it.”
“To-morrow,” said the Earl, re-
ferring once moretohis diary, “Basil
and I are visiting the romantic scarps
of Filey.” ~ *
IV. -
On the day following the unfortunate
accident at Filey the Earl and Countess
of Blight reclined together upon the
cliffs of Bridlington. -
“If we only had had Percy here !”
sighed the Earl.
“It was something to have got him
as far as the beach,” said the Countess
hopefully. “Perhaps in time—a little
higher every day—” -
The Earl sighed again.
“The need for self-expression comes
strongly upon the artist at a time like
this,” he said. “It is not for me to say
that I have genius—”
“It is for me to say it, dear,” said
his wiſe.
“Well, well, perhaps in my own line.
And at the full height of one's powers to
be baulked by the morbidity, for I can
call it nothing else, of a Percy ‘Podby'ſ
Gertie,” he went on dreamily, “I wish
I could make you understand something
of the fascination which an artist finds
in his medium. To be lying here, at
the top of the world, with the lazy
crawling sea beneath us so many feet
below * >
“Look,” said the Countess suddenly.
She pointed to the beach.
The Earl rose, stretched his head over
the edge and gazed down.
“Percy,” he said.
“Yes. Almost exactly beneath us.”
“If anything fell upon him from
here,” said the Earl thoughtfully, “it
is quite possible that—”
Suddenly the fascination whereof he
had spoken to her came irresistibly
home to the Countess.
“Yes,” she said, as if in a trance, “if
anything fell upon him from here—”
and she gave her husband a thought-
ful push—“it—is—quite—possible—
that—” -
At the word “that ” the Earl reached
Percy, and simultaneously the title
expired.
Poor Blight!—or perhaps, since the
title was never really his, we should
say “Poor Blighter!” It is difficult
to withhold our sympathy from him.

MINCE-MEAT.
(By our Charivariety Artistes.)
IN Scotland on New Year's Eve it is
still considered lucky for a dark man
to enter your house with a bottle of
whisky under his arm.
The mother who last Christmas
found her youngest boy gagged and
bound outside the pantry, from which
a pudding had disappeared, is recom-
mended this year to keep him away
from the Pictures. -
We understand that the pretty little
custom of not giving Christmas-
boxes to rate collectors will again
be carried out this season.
An American Y.M.C.A. leader is
of the opinion that the English
Church has much to learn from
the American. It would be interest-
ing to hear an English clergyman
say, “What ice-cart takes this
hunk of excess baggage to be
his wife?” and the bridegroom's
answer, “Cut the dope, Steve; I'm
the guy.” :: ::
“Robins often enter houses
which are inhabited, during wintry
weather,” states a well-known orni-
thologist. We understand, how-
ever, that, unless openly accused of
Bolshevistic tendencies on account
of the colour of their breasts, they
It is reported that a Glasgow
temperance advocate has invented
an inflammable ginger-ale for use
on Christmas puddings. The more
cautious anti-Prohibitionists take
the view that the stuff should not
be condemned without a trial.
Puddings, we read, should be
stored in large dry cupboards.
Smith Minor is wondering what is
wrong with the time-honoured custom
of storing them in a large roomy boy.
A trade paper advertises mouth-
organs as just the thing for Christmas
festivities. We have always felt that,
if you must take musical instruments
to parties, a mouth-organ in the pocket
spoils the figure far less than a 'cello
does. - :: :
“Souper dansant" is advertised by
many of our best restaurants. Per-
sonally we prefer the kind that keeps
still while we are trying to digest it.

It is just six years ago this Christ-
mas that a Scotsman entered a coffee-
tavern during a fog.
