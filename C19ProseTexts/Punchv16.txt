IDSUMMER is come, and Punch, giving to the world another Volume—his sweet Sixteenth—again holds
his Feast of Roses. And Punch—if the world will only be wise enough to draw up to the Banquet—
has, in these leaves, flowers for all peoples of all countries and all denominations.
The Red Rose, Punch—with “the civility of his knee, his hat, and hand, with all those outward and
visible motions which may express or promote his invisible devotion”—presents to his Mistress, England.
For it was the Red Rose that was first worn in the bosom of BRITANNIA—the Red, Red Rose, significant
of the blood of Britain, healthful and strong and pure, and odorous with the love of home. Punch is fain
to hope that the English Red Rose so abounds in his Volume—his Midsummer Flower-Garden—that no
English man, woman, or child shall vainly want one for button-hole, bosom, cap, or girdle.
The Cinnamon Rose—the Rose canelle—belongs to France, and as its name implies, smells of the
épicier. This Rose, Punch throws to the Gallic Cock, in the forlorn hope that it may somewhat sweeten
him from the dunghill of glory, whereupon he loves to perch, and to the annoyance of rational folk,
unceasingly to cock-a-doodle-doo!
There is a species of Yellow Rose—native of Germany—sulphur-coloured without, and bright scarlet
within. This Rose, being a touching combination of blood and brimstone, Punch sends to the EMPEROR
of AUSTRIA; nor can Punch cull from his whole Rose Garden a fitter flower for the CzAR of Russia, or
King Bombastes of Naples.



## p. (#8) ##################################################

iv - PREFACE.
To his Holiness the Pope, Punch, with much sadness of heart, sends—to take the place of the tiara—
a triple crown of Blush Roses.
To Kossuth, BEM, and all the heroic men of Hungary, Punch sends chaplets of the Ever-green Rose,
“white, single, but very sweet.” And when the Bear shall be driven back to his den, and the Double
Eagle shall be plucked of its feathers, then may Punch next Midsummer add to his gift a shower of Roses
from the Sinan Nile—of flowers of which—indicates that High Priest of the Rose, Thomas MooRE—mattresses
are made for heroes to recline upon.
The Rose with white-and-red stripes, Punch dedicates to the Austrian General, who, borrowing the
knout of Russia, scourges women at the altar of glory !
To the Roman Triumvirate, Punch sends the Eglantine, the Rosa Perla, or Sweet Briar Rose; the
flower that, most beset by thorns, sheds odour still the sweetest. For Oudinot, General of the Army,
and of Broken Promises, there is one Dog Rose, a solitary Rose de Chien. “He’s won it well, and may
he wear it long !”
There is the “Frankfort Rose, full and handsome, but scentless.” To all Assemblies who profess
much in the name of Freedom—who make a great show, yet do nothing—Punch presents this dashing,
scentless flower.
The rich China Rose, being “semi-double,” is offered for the button-hole of Prussia's Monarch.
And, indeed, there is no nation—no individual man—who may not gather the fitting Rose from
Punch's Garden. And whereas, it is written by APULEIUs that a philosopher, being turned by wicked necro-
mancy to an ass, regained his true manhood, by making a meal of certain Roses, so is even the forlornest
case made curable, if brought to Punch's parterre—if medicined with Punch's Flowers.
Ladies and Gentlemen,_open the Volume. That is, unclose the wicket, and enter Punch's Rose
Garden.

THE YOUNG MAN'S ALMAN A.C.K.
TH: fashion varies with every place you visit. For instance, you may keep your hat on at the Casino; but it is scarcely It is a sure sign of a cruel disposition if you see a person standing outside St. George's, Hanover Square, deriving
considered good manners to do so at the opera. You may whistle and join in “God save the Queen," at Jultºn's pleasure in watching, the poor bridegrooms take the fatal leap from their carriages into the church. iie who has.
Concerts; but the same taste is not expected of you at the Philharmonic. Any º: i. .. to º out pity for others, depend upon it, will receive none himself, when his own fate is sealed:
“Bravo, Rouse !” at the Grecian Saloon. but the same exclamation would be considered a little out of place at xeter If you are at a Public Dinner, and find a difficulty in getting any one to wait upon v
Hall. A cigar may be lighted with great effect in the corridor of the Adelphi, when the audience is coining out; to take to the gentleman opposite “LoRd *...* ji. ..". º ººº:
but you would hardly attempt such a thing in the crush-room of Her Majesty's Theatre.
Staring at a lady under her
bonnet, is considered very
much beneath a gentleman.
Never sit next to a baby in
an omnibus, much less between
two babies.
The fewer dignitaries a
young man knows on the
bench, the better it is eventu-
ally for his station in life. Of
all morning calls, none are so
unpleasant to pay as a nuagis-
trates 1
If you peep into the bonnet-
shops, it is a clear proof you
are troubling your head about
things that do not concern
you.
In selecting a Hansom,
always hail the one which has
the smallest horse and the
largest wheels.
When you wake, if you find
your head is “splitting,” the
ouly cure is to have it instantly
soda-ed.
Don't ask the box-keeper
“if he has got a seat 2" but
give him the shilling at once.
If you get leave of absence
to go out on town, recollect a
week means a fortnight, and
that a fortnight is equal to one
month, and two or three days
over ! If any complaint is
made, you have a capital ex-
cuse, by declaring you were
stopt by a revolution on the
vontinent.
Remember, also, to have the
Influenza on the Derby Day;
and it is just as well to have a
grandmother who is danger-
ously ill, about Easter.
Never go into a theatre when
a money-taker says “There
is plenty of standing-room,”
unless you wish to see the
performances from the slips,
over a Black Sea of hats.
If you light your cigar at a
lamp-post, take care it has not
been newly painted.
PLAcks to Br Avoid Ed :-
Bow Street after 12 o'clock at
night, Chancery Lane the first
day of Terin, a halfpenny
Steamer on Whitsun-Monday,
and liolywell Street at all
times.
It is a very bad case when a
young man parts with his
watch, even to prove that
‘‘Time is money.”
How many of the invitations
to breakfast that have been
given over night have been
kept the following morning?
It is astonishing the cluster of white-necked gentlemen you will have round you for the remainder of the evening.
The young man who wishes
- - - to “weed" his friends, will
| 1 || || intº - ---- - - only select those who smoke
lia | | º * - I - - kilºlºº the best cigars.
- - tº - Certain young men, when
they are invited out to a ban,
only go in time for supper.
These are what may be called
the supper-numeraries of so-
ciety.
º A walking-stick has legs, but
- an umbrella has wings. Tºy the
bye, if you are wise you will
take care not to buy a silk
umbrella, for it only flies all
the quicker.
The most certain method of
borrowing £5 is to ask for
£10.
Never trust a play-bill for
two days together, for not an
evening passes but they pro-
mise a great deal more than is
ever performed.
You had not better attempt
to decipher any correspond-
ence when you get home late
after supper, for it is a gram-
matical truth that a person
must master his liquids before
he can go through his letters.
A “rising young man” is
one who rises regularly—not
later than eight o'clock; a
“promising young man” is
one who pays his tailor not
later than a twelvemonth after
he has promised him.
The old pay with money—
the young with compliments.
“Healths” are no longer
complimentary; but a me-
dical man should particularly
refrain from proposing a per-
son's health, for he is sure
to be suspected of wishing
him ill.
Be careful, if you have your
portrait in the Exhibition, not
to stand opposite to it, or else
| you will probably overhear
| remarks that will make you
feel most unpleasantly beside
yourself.
Of all passages in a young
man's life, there is mone so
trying, so solemn, or accom-
panied with so much earnest
feeling, as seeking for the

just at present, but I expect a remittance very shortly.”
“what is enough for one is enough for two,” says the old proverb; but this can scarcely be said to apply to tavern
steaks, which certainly get smaller by degrees, and beautifully less every year.
Never do things by halves, unless it is sending a bank-note by the post, or paying a cabman his demand.
when a cabman says, “Whatever you please, Sir," you may be sure it is not more than an eightpenny fare.
Debt is the young man's Chancery; for, when once he gets into it, it is quite impossible to say when he will
get out again.
| A bad hat, taken to an evening party, frequently comes out the next day as good as new.
Quirk the Contrary.—You often hear of a man “being in advance of his age,” but you never heard of a woman If two omnibusses are racing, never hail the first, unless you have a particular fancy to be run over by the second.

PUNCH'S ALMAN ACK FOR 1849.
THE LADY'S ALMAN A.C.K.
The Woman's Sphrrr.—Blackbeetles, spiders, ants, mice, crossings, long-bearded French-
men, monster dogs, milliners' bills, fast men, and certain gentlemen after dinner, are all so
many objects of Woman's Fear.
THE Brst PARTNERs.-The oldest for whist, the youngest for dancing, and for marriage—
whichever you can.
Thr BEST Vis-A-Wis.—The Parson at St. George's, Hanover Square.
“The Child is Father to the Man,” says Wordsworth; but, as ladies never grow older than
thirty, the Girl must be Grandmother to the Woman.
How to MAKR THE BEst WIN roar.—A young gentleman treading upon a young lady's dress
makes a good sharp Winegar; but a friend being brought in to dinner when there is nothing
but cold meat, produces the most piquart quality, the smallest drop of which makes a woman's
tongue quite smart for hours afterwards.
Colds.-Young ladies should take care not to sit near the piano; for it is a well-known fact
that that instrument has caused more Dreadful Colds than all the thin shoes and draughts in the
world. The most beautiful creatures, who were perfectly well and laughing the minute before,
have no sooner approached Grand Broadwood than they have been suddenly seized with a sore
throat, and have lost in a minute the use of their voice. This complaint is less taking as the
young lady grows older. and rarely has any effect in a family where there are several sisters.
THE VALENTINE.
Little Foot Page. “I say, MARIA, What's A Rhyme to Cupid 1"
Maria. “Why, Stupid RHYMEs to Cupid—Don’t it, STUPID 1”
A N OLD INANCE.-There is a very pretty dance, which young ladies are very fond of leading
their parents, and which is generally played to a very pretty tune, but which has never been
described yet. The following are the principal figures of this popular dance, which, for the want
of a better name, we will call “LA Flint Ation : "–
First Figur R. (Before Supper).-The lady and gentleman meet, take hands, and retire
to a secret corner in the room. They sit, exchange glances, smile, and join in a general round
of conversation. The gentleman makes the first advance, the lady the second. This continues
several times, when Mamma comes forward, and the gentleman goes off to the right, and the
lady to the left, and Mamma is left to go through the Chaine des Dames by herself.
Srcond Figure. (At Supper).-The gentleman hands across chicken, ham, jelly, and trifle,
which are taken by the lady, and empty plates returned. They take wine, and balancez. Bonbons
and crackers are exchanged several times, when Mamma comes across from the other side, and
Daughter glissez out of the room. Gentleman sits opposite to pigeon-pie, and goes down the
middle of the lobster salad and up again.
THIRD SET. (After Supper) –Lady chassez out of the room. Gentleman follows. Grand
galop to Conservatory. Poussette from corner to corner, concluding with a quiet set on
ottoman. , Lady drops her glove ; the gentleman fait la révérence, and pockets the same.
Ditto with bouquet. They join hands, talk, laugh, nod, and whisper to side faces, when Mamma
comes down the centre, and galops across to lady. They dos-à-dos, and the dance is con-
-T
The MAthimonial MARKET.-Buy in the cheapest, and sell in the dearest.
How To MAKE A Bonn E.T.-Take a walk on a fine day down Regent Street. Make 1 long
stop at each bonnet-shop — miss 2 or 3 of the first ; pull up at fourth, and fix your husband's
attention with a good running “Hem ’ ” Drop 1 “ Pet” and 2 “Ducks;” pass your arm
smoothly through his. Fine-draw 2 or 3 sighs, and draw him gently inside. Work several
rounds of open smiles, and run off a long chain of “Loves.” Do not miss a single point,
but take up with a fine snap every “ Not,” and cut it instantly. If there is any difficulty,
knit your brows, and purse your lips, and prepare to cast off after the drochet fashion. Repeat
this at every shop, and by running the same rig the whole length of the street, you will be sure
to have a very pretty bonnet by the time you reach home.
HEAven-born Smugglers.-Every woman is born with a natural taste for smuggling.
This may be accounted for by the spirit of contradiction there is in the sex, which makes them
consider it a duty to oppose the recognised customs of every country.
FEMININE PRover B.-Love me, love my cat.
Courtship.—A lover should be treated with the same gentleness as a new glove. The young
lady should pull him on with the utmost tenderness at first, only making the smallest advance
at a time, till she gradually gains upon him, and twists him ultimately round her little finger;
whereas the young lady who is hasty, and in too great a hurry, will never get a lover to take her
hand, but be left with nothing but her wits at her fingers' ends.

| cluded hy the daughter being poussetted round the Conservatory, and chassezed up to bed. The
gentleman does the caralier seul out of the house, advances to a lantern, sets to a cigar, and
promenades slowly home.
VALUAPLE A Dvice to Trºrchy GENTLeMrN.—Our old grandmother used to say to our old
grandfather, “It's useless quarrelling, my dear, for you know we must make it up again."
FEMALE Extravagance.—The incurable love of “bargains."
“When things get to the worst, they generally take a turn for the better.” This proverb
applies more particularly to a lady's silk dress—when she cannot get a new one.
Ladies' Sports and Pastimes.—The greatest amusement, when you have nothing else to
do, is shopping. It can be indulged also at the very cheapest rate; for you can enjoy a good
hour's entertainment for a yard of ribbon, or run through a bankrupt's stock merely for a paper
of pins.
Another sport—is putting your husband's papers to rights. It is best to be present when
he attempts to look for anything, so to be a witness of his distress and confusion.
LUGGAGE.-A lady who had a steamboat full of luggage, med? an excuse for it by saying
“she was going to Rome, and wouldn't for the world be withºut the Thirty-nine Articles.”

THE SWELL MOBSMAN'S ALMANACK.
JANUARY.-Scating in Parks. Good
eggscuse for tumblin against elderly
coves, wich, if your 'and is found in
their pockits, vy, 'ow can you help it *
Also, ven gents break thro' into Ser-
pentine, pockits must be turned out
or they'll never drie.
Februan Y. – Queen opens Par-
liment. Nuffin to be done in the
line; but pickins a goin' in and out of
Park. , N.B. Forenners ain't no good;
their chains mostly mosaic, and their
fogles fetches next to nothin'. Rowdy
ain't to be expected.
March. – In vindy and dusty
veather, keep to thoroughfares. A deal
to be done in ridicule and ticker line,
as ladies is a keepin' dresses down, and
old coves oldin hats on. Also busses
well filled this month, and may be
recommended.
April. – Greenwich Fair 'ad a
carakter; but, speakin' from eggs-
perience, the rix is more thau its
worth, havin' myself had three months
at Brixun for sixpennuth coppers, a
key, two thinbuls, and some ginger-
bred.
M.A.Y. — Plant about Exeter 'All.
Take old ladies on way to 'All, as they
generally hempties into the plate. The
vite chokers may be ſingured on their
way one, as they mostly brings hoff a
pockitfull.
Jux E.-Hepsom, in course, Has-
cot, and the other races. Beginners
‘nd better work on the ropes, as carridge
business requires fashuilabul exterior
and hassurance. Plate inay be nabbed
heasy, as tigers not so sharp after
luncheon,
July.—Attend "Logical Gardings
regular” on Sundays, and fashumabul
places of worship. Prayer books is
a drug. Hevening parties attended,
and principal the tres, tho' since
they've got so low, nothin' vorth
speakin' of to be done there. Youn
‘ands may be put on, as business tho
triflin' is safe.
August.—Nobilaty begins to leave
town. Steamboats in good order this
month, 'specially Sundays. Beginners
should remember, if cotched may be
ducked.
Septembert.—Waterin' places, if
no objeckshun to travel. If equainted
with forin languages, somethin' con-
siderable may be done in sea-goin'
steamers, as coves, ven sick, takes no
notice whose and is in their pockits.
Octobka.-A werry dull month in
London, and the Prowinces may be
vurked with adwantage. Railway
stashuns 'olds out good prospect for
sharp 'ands, as there is a deal comin'
and goin’ about this time, and werry
slack look-out kept.
Novembert.—Pr'aps the best month
for the old 'uns, which, rememberwen
you've eased a cove in a fogg, never
cut away in an 'urry, or crushers stops
you. Lord Mare's Show used to be
good, but don't draw the crowds it did
some yeres ago.
Dºcrather.—You may keep your
'and in about Pantomime time; but
werry little money in pepul's pockits
this month, by reason of Crismas bills.
By attendin' to the abov', the young
famly man will be able to support
hisself in desency and comfort.

Thixos to REMEMBER. |
Remember that France, Spain, Germany, Italy, are not
England, and behave yourself accordingly.
Remember that losing your temper and losing your keys are
equally inexcusable while travelling.
Remember not to forget anything.
Remember that you're certain of a stoppage in the City.
Remember that a carpet-bag is never full, and a cabman
never satisfied.
Remember the waiters on all occasions.
Remember that foreigners will judge the house from the
brick, so behave like “a brick" on all occasions.
Every traveller
wears coloured
spectacles, and
should allow for
the effect on men,
manners, and land-

Patience is a

THE PHRENOLOGICAL ALMANACK.
JANuanv.–Calculation is brought
into requisition for the purpose of as-
certaining the amount of Christmas
bills; and Comparison, which is always
odious, comes into play for the purpose
of comparing the amount of the bills
with the means of meeting them.
February.-amativeness shows it-
self about valentine's Day, and the
flame of love resorts to Bath (post),
to allay its consuming fires. Adhe-
siveness becomes a prominent organ
with reference to Her Majesty's
head, in the shape of postage stamps.
March. —Inhabitiveness becomes
very faint in this month among those
who are not quite prepared to pay
their rents, and who accordingly quit
their habitations before quarter day :
but Trans may be strongly manifested
in the cerebral organisation of the land-
lord, and prompt him to keep pace
with the movements of his tenant.
Aphil.-About the first of the
month Cautiousness will materially fail;
bills will be accepted on the one hand,
and discounted on the other, with the
utmost laxity.
May.—Tune will be predominant in
this month, when the opera season
will be at its height, and Combative-
ness will be found in some force at the
pit entrance of the opera.
June.-Colour, Form, and Indivi-
duality will be the organs in vogue
during this month, when the Exhibi-
tions of *aintings will be open. Indi-
viduality will have the most powerful
effect, and will send many individuals
to Trafalgar Square to see their own
portraits at the Royal Academy.

this month; and Acquisitiveness, or a
desire for Costs, resumes its playful
influence.
Novemern.-This is the month
when Alimentiveness revels in the
enjoyment of Lord Mayors' dinners,
and the rest of the feasting which
Imitativeness renders common at this
period.
December.—If Self-Esteem and
Approbativeness can fairly assert
themselves in this month, on a review
of the passing year, the Christmas
may be devoted to Mirthfulness, and
will be further sweetened by giving
free vent to the organ of Benevolence.

PUNCH'S ALMAN ACK FOR 1849.
THE FORTUN E-TELLER’S ALMAN ACK.
Todream of a Millstone about your neck, is a sign of what you may expect if you marry an extravagant wife.
when a housekeeper dreams of bell-ringing, and wakes with the sound of it in his ears, it generally indicates that there
is somebody at the door–most probably a “gent” who has been supping at the Cider-cellars.
It is very lucky to dream that you pay for a thing twice over; since afterwards, you will probably take care to have all
your bills receipted.
To dream that you are a Judge, is a sign that you will remaina bachelor. (Nor-Ed.)
to dream of Bagpipes is an
To dream of an Altar denotes some heavy affliction, the next morning you find a speech of Mr. Anstry's in
the newspaper, and get a severe headache in the fruitless attempt to wade through it.
For a person in umembarrassed circumstances to dream that he is arrested is very fortunate; for it is a warning to him
on mo account to accept a bill.
To dream of a Fire isa sign that—if you are wise-you will see that all thelightsin your house are out before you go to bed.
To dream that your nose is red at the tip, is an intimation that you had better leave off brandy-and-water.
To dream of a Bear, fore-
tokens mischief; which your
vision shows you is a Bruin.
To dream of Soap betokens
a combat, in which you may
expect to get lathered.
DIVINATION.
Rules for Thw Hand.–If you have any lines on your hands, in the present state of the railway market, it is a sign
that you had better get them off as soon as possible. A handful of halfpence is a sign of change. A double fist portendeth
a black eye. A close fist is the mark of a universal philanthropist.
Cands.--The Deuce of Clubs is domestie unhappiness, occasioned by keeping married gentlemen away from their
hearths and homes. In Paris, the Deuce of Clubs is conspiracy and rebellion. The Tray of Clubs brings broiled bones
To dream you are eating, is
certain to come true-at
agreeable omen. On the prin-
ciple that dreams are to be
interpreted by contraries, you
may expect to hear music.
if you dream of Beer, it is a
sign that you may expect“ pot-
luck."
To dream of a Boar, fore-
bodes a Railway call.
to dream of a Cab fore-
shows a journey, anda dispute
at the end of it; which will
probably have some reference
to the fare.
To dream of ice is a favour-
able omen to a lady, provided
she relates her dream to an
agreeable young man on pass-
ing a pastry.cook's shop om a
hot day,
If you dream of a Ducking,
it may be presumed that you
will escape one, by having the
prudence mot to venture forth
without your umbrella.
To see Apples in a dream,
betokens a wedding; because,
where you find （Apples, you
may reasonably expect Pairs.
To dream that you are tra-
velling om a railway by the ex-
press train, admonishes you
that you are goingtoo fast, and
intimates that you ought to
‘‘pull up."
To dream that you are ſame,
is a token that you will get
into a hobble.
when a young lady dreams
of a coffin, it betokens that she
should instantly discontinue
tight stays, and always go
warmly and thickly shod in
wet weather.
If you dream of Tears, it is
a sign that you may safely spe-
culate on a fall in blubber.
If you dream of a clock, it
is a token that you will gain
great credit—that is, tick.
when a fashionable young
lady dreams of a Filbert, it is
a sign that her thoughts are
running upon the Colonel.
if you dream of clothes, it
is a warning not to go to law;
for, by the rule of contraries,
you will be sure of a non-
suit.
breakfast.
To dream of a Barber
denotes losses, hairs may
expect to be cut-off.
brenming of walking Bare-
foot denotes a journey-which
will be bootless.
To dream of ſºggs is a sign
that you will discover a mare's
nest.
to dream of having a great
number of serwants is-mad-
neº-.
Dreaming of Larks is omi-
nous of the station-house.
voice of the stans.
March. – Governors are
harassed by opposition, which
proceeds from the unruly por-
tion of Young England. The
frising Generation will tre-
quent Casimos and smoke
cigars, and will not be in by
ten o’clock. They win eneak
openly and advisedly of their
domestic rights, and compass
and imagine imprudent mátri-
mony.
April – the aspect of the
stars on the 1st indicates great
good fortune to speculators in
the Derby sweeps. Jupiten
approaching Leo indicates a
£10,000 prize coming to Mr.
Ibuprºsby, one of these fine
days, but which of them the
planets do not say with perfect
precision.
July.--Mans now enters
Taurus. This pugnacious
planet, in conjunction with the
bull, evidently relates to tre-
land, where some grand rows
originating in some gross
blunder, may, for the thou-
sand and first time, be calcu-
lated on.
August.--Mans now enters
Gaerwr; and awful debates
are occasioned in Parliament
by the spirit of discordseizing
on Messrs. tºrquharat and
Chisholm Anstev,
Decemben. – the malefics
in Arues are stih menacing

and sandwich. The Deuce of Diamonds is, that ladies are very fond then, and they are so dreadfully expensive, The
Queen of Hearts denotes Jºnny Lind. Whatever Spades turn up, take care that you do not put your foot in it.
Tra AND Coffer Ground8.–Among the various grounds on which the future can be predicted, are those of Tea and
Coffee. The sloe-leaf indicates that you have been cheated by your grocer. Grains of sand suggest the propriety of
going toſeºshop for sugar. The form of the moon is a sign that you are consulting your oracle under the influênce
of that planet.

O U R N E W YEAR 2 S C A R O L.
THE daylight lengthens, and the sunshine strengthens,
And things in general also look more clear;
Trade growing brighter as the skies get lighter:
Thus, in its cradle, smiles the new-born Year.
Snowdrops now sleeping, shortly will be peeping
Forth, and the crocus lift its yellow cup;
But faster thriving, sooner still reviving,
The markets are already looking up.
To its meridian, with rise quotidian,
More highly soars the rolling orb of day;
And looms are spinning quicker, mills beginning
With fresh velocity to whirl away.

digger has impressed himself on the recollection as one of the principal
characters. With the actors themselves, this One of Spades was always
regarded as a sure card wherever it was played; and the corpulence
of the performer, enhanced by a multiplicity of waistcoats, was, to use
a technical phrase, one of those “delicious bits of fat” that are
hungered after by the professional appetite.
The exclusion of the Gravedigger from the royal presence will
render it necessary, a fortiori, that Yorick's skull, which was always a
crack bit with the tragedian, should be entirely left out; and the grand
point where Hamlet usually jumps into the newly-dug grave of Ophelia
must be got rid of altogether, or a substitute found, which will enable
the performer to strike his attitude, form his picture, and bring down
his applause in some new manner.
We presume, the benefit of purification will be given to Bor and
Coa, and that MR. Buckstone's by-play, with the piece of bacon—a
literal “bit of ſat’—will be expunged in the same nice spirit that has
dealt with the unfortunate Gravedigger.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TRIAL OF THE HORSE GUARDS CLOCK.
IT having been rumoured that the Horse Guards
Clock was about to be put upon its trial for ob-
taining credit under false pretences, the avenue
to the Court—Bride Court, Fleet Street—was
choked up at an early hour; and MR. CHIEF
JUSTICE PUNCH took his seat upon the Bench,
behind his own counter, at precisely ten.
The prosecution was conducted by MR. BRIEF-
Less, and the Clock appeared in person for its
own defence. -
After opening the pleadings, in a loud voice
MR. BRIEFLEss proceeded to observe, that this
was the most miserable moment of his existence.
His pain arose from being called upon to impugn
E the character of one who had long been looked up
to as a ºff. of correctness and §: he
meant the Horse Guards Clock, Really he felt
it to be an awful sign of the general derangement of the Times,
that the defendant should have been detected, after so many years of
regularity, in going astray. He should not dwell upon this painful
theme, but would proceed to call the witnesses that would prove this
distressing case. -
The first witness called was LoRD DENMAN, who said he had known
the Clock for some years, and had been in the habit of looking up to it
with great respect. Witness had lately observed a marked alteration
in the habits of the Clock. It had stood with its hands joined together,
in, which position it had remained motionless for many hours. At
other times witness had seen the Clock spreading out its hands in oppo-
site directions, as if there were something internally wrong; and this
fact was clearly perceptible by what was depicted on its face.
Cross-examined.—Believed the Clock intended well, and generally
acted well; but had been given to understand that it refused to be
wound up for it, even when its actions were regular. Was not aware
how often this winding-up was required.
Re-examined by MR.BRIEFLEss-Considered the Clock double-faced,
and in future, would not believe it, as he had done formerly. Had
seen the Clock black in the face one minute, when looking one way,
and when looking the other way the face had been deadly pale.
This being the case for the prosecution, the Clock was called upon
for its defence; and after a brief address, in the course of which it
declared it was the first time it had ever stood in that position, or been
known to stand at all, it called several witnesses to character.
LoRD SILIBoy was a clerk in the Treasury, and had frequently
watched the Clock; that is to say, had set his watch by it.
Cross-examined by MR. BRIEFLEss-Watched the Clock because he
had ºf particular to do. He often—like the Clock itself—had
a good deal of time upon his hands. Would not say this was a cause
of any particular sympathy between them. But such was the fact.
After a few other witnesses, whose evidence went to nearly the same
effect, MR. CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH proceeded to sum up, and the Jury
returned a verdict of Guilty, but strongly recommended the Clock to
mercy, on account of its previous character. MR. CHIEF JUSTICE
PUNCH then passed sentence in the following words:–
“You have been convicted by a Jury of your countrymen, upon the
clearest evidence, of an offence of a grave character—that of obtaining
credit under false pretences. There may be some grounds for recom-
mending you to mercy: you have not taken advantage of the recent
revolutions to join in any precipitate movement, it is true; but you have
made a stand against regularity and order, by refusing to move at all.
There is no evidence of any policeman having told you to move on; but
you know it was your duty to have moved on, and therefore that is no
excuse. The sentence of the Court is, that you be bound over to keep
the time for twelve months, and that you be kept to hard labour upon
your own wheel during Her Majesty's pleasure.”
A LIGHT ARTICLE.
THE Electric Light is still in a comparative state of darkness; so we
will, endeavour to throw a little light upon it, and show what there is
in it. First of all, it can be exhibited under the water; which will
enable us to get literally a stream of fire, and we may have burning jets-
d'eau. Anyone who wishes to set the Thames in a state of ignition,
can easily accomplish it by secreting a series of Electric Lights in the
bed of the river. It can be exhibited, also, in a vacuum, which recom-
mends it at once as the best illumination for many of our theatres. It
emancipates no blacks, like Camphine, and respects the snowy purity
of the most delicate muslin and the fairest satin.
There is nothing explosive in its nature, and you may have any
quantity you like without blowing your roof off, or sending your front
parlour into the house opposite. It can be increased unlimitedly; so
that, if placed on the top of St. Paul's, we shall be able, to mimic the
brightest mid-day on the darkest midnight. Curious policemen will
have no necessity to carry any more bull's-eyes, with! which to it;
through keyholes when they hear anybody coming. Fire Offices will be
obliged to lower their rates of insurance, on account of the less danger
of fire; and a November Fog will become a transparent absurdity.
Who knows, we shall have electric matches P and any one who wants
a light for his cigar will have to say, “Could you oblige me with a
little electricity?” - -
Darkness will have to retreat to the Shades, below ; the Arabian
Nights will be the only ones left; and our lamplighters will be super-
seded by practical chemists. Imagine FARADAY running up to the top
of the Nelson, Pillar every morning to turn off the electricity, or
having to ascend all our high monuments at a certain hour, to give each
Light its customary coalscuttle of charcoal! However, one t
benefit is, that the Electric Light is sure to lower the extremely high
prices of the Gas Companies, if it does not extinguish the vile mono:
polies altogether, and number the Gas with the “Light of other days.”
WILLS WITHOUT LAWYERS.
(Wide “Home Made Wills.”—Newspaper paragraph.)
I was a dissolute young blade,
A scapegrace of the worst degree,
And so my slow old uncle made
A Will to disinherit me.
To save the lawyer's fees intent, -
The deed himself he needs must draw,
And, by that precious testament,
He cut off me—his heir-at-law.
At last the old curmudgeon died,
And, lo! the Will, when 'twas perused,
Proved oni signed on its outside-
And so the probate was refused.
The ſin is mine instead of BILL's,
Although I am a worthless whelp:
So here's success to all whose Wills
Are made without a lawyer's help.
THE ADVENTURES OF A CHRISTMAS GOOSE.
YoUR goose leaves Suffolk three days before Christmas Day.
It passes one day on the Railway.
The next day it rests with a few thousands of its plucked brothers at
the Railway Station.
In the evening, the anxious owner, who has rectived a letter
apprising him of the Christmas present, calls to inquire after his goose,
but there are so many persons all engaged upon a similar wild-goose
errand, that he is directed, after waiting till twelve o'clock, to call
again the following day.
The following day is Sunday.
Railway Station.
...Christmas Day passes, and yet there is no Christmas Goose! Who
likes to run five miles on Christmas Day, merely to return with a goose
for his pains?
On Tuesday another pilgrimage is made. A large mountain of geese
are turned over one after another; but the one you want does not
exactly turn up. There must be some mistake.
You write off to your Suffolk friend, and receive an answer with full
particulars. Furnished with these, you travel again on the Wednesday
to the Railway Station, and are informed that your goose, not having
been called, for at the proper time, was put up to auction amongst the
railway jº. and knocked down for one and twopence. This sum is
tendered to you, or you are handsomely allowed the option of selecting
§ one of the unclaimed geese that are F. up in the Goods
Office. You select the finest, as you think, and are agreeably informed
by 'ºvie. when you reach home, that your goose is “as bad as bad
can be.”
Your only remedy is to send it to a poor relation.
Private Note for Country Cousins.
If you wish to make a friend in town a New Year's Gift, you cannot
do better than send him a Christmas-box by the railway, and it will
arrive just in time.
The goose still slumbers at the
Roy AL PATRONAGE.-In consequence of the immense success attend:

Haymarket will continue closed every night that the company performs
before HER MAJESTY at Windsor.

families; and in neighbourhoods where there is much rivalry, we have
observed these families increasing against each other at the rate of one

the laps of certain female impostors were bouncers in reality, being no
babies at all, but children of four or five years of age, sent to sleep for
a time—and perhaps, in the end, sent to sleep altogether—by ºf;
we think, instead of putting their hands, into their pockets, the really
benevolently disposed would prefer putting the impostors themselves
into the hands of the police. Surely the Mendicity. Society is little
better than a Mendacity Society, if it does not interfere to put down
these monstrous and inhuman mockeries, which divert so much true
charity into a wrong channel, at a time when there are but, too many
legitimate objects for all the benevolence the public may be disposed to
exercise.
TRANSATLANTIC RELATIVES.
AN advertisement in one of the Southern American papers states,
at-
“The subscriber has for sale six able-bodied mechanics, which he will dispose of
to the highest bidder, for cash or approved paper, on Saturday next.”
The "mechanics,” the antecedents to the neuter pronoun, relative,
are, it is needless to observe, negro slaves. Who, according to LINP-
LEY MURRAY, is applied to persons, which to animals and inanimate
things. This rule, it seems, is modified by Anglo-American, gram;
marians: who, in their accidence, relates to free and enlightened
citizens, which to animals, inanimate things, and—niggers. Now,
according to the principles of English grammar, the term which, on the
contrary, should be used in s ing of slaveholders, since that is the
pronoun to be employed in reference to brutes.

MR. TXUNUPS PLAN OF TYOMESTIC FINANCIAL
REFORM.
THE following able document, from the pen of MR.DU.NUP,
has been addressed to us, and we give it the benefit of im-
mediate publicity:—
“DEAR SIR,-From the reception you have given to
my former communications, I am sure you will be ready
to listen to my suggestions for economy and retrenchment
uestion upon which I, as a large consumer of other
e's means, if not my own, am well qualified to speak.
“I would suggest to you the $.” of proposing:
to the nation at large, a Family Budget applicable to a
classes of society; and, taking the average income at
five hundred a year, I will proceed to make that sum
my basis; for, in dealing with other people's incomes
I am somewhat expert. ---
“To begin with the Customs, or in other words, the position of the
public as customers, let us take tea—though, by the way, I have not
et taken dinner—and see what is to be done. Your grocer's bill may
º in round numbers, a pound a week, which I would reduce to fifteen
shillings by throwing out the birch from the genuine plant, the sand
from the sugar, and the servants' fingers from both. -
“We will now, if you please, go back to breakfast, where we will
request the milkman to remove his calcareous deposit from his milk-
cans, or, to use a vulgar but forcible expression, we will call upon him
his chalks.’ I will not, however, go further into milk than
-a
peop
will be sufficient for skimming its surface; but, if every family consuming
hours, it will
a pint per diem saves a halfpenny in the º ti
e nation more
give a grand total, which, in round numbers, will save t
than I have leisure to calculate.
“We next come to soap-I mean soft soap-by means of which many
a father of a family finds himself smoothed over into the permission of
little extravagances that he ought to withstand. There is the honey-
soap from his wife, which causes a large outlay in new dresses, and
there are other kinds and qualities of soap, of which he ought to be
able to wash his hands.
“The next. item in my Family Budget may be entitled the Direct
Taxes, consisting as they do of those plain matter-of-fact demands on
the pocket which are made on account of sea-side excursions, visits to
the Opera, and other matters of the kind. The Excise Duties, and all
other duties, sink into insignificance when compared with these very
heavy domestic duties, which involve that most ruinous sort of taxation
which embraces a repeated tax on your good-nature, as well as on your
purse. . It is true that much of this expenditure becomes a portion of
the deferred debt; and, as debt is sometimes said to be a sign of a
country's prosperity, it may be a sign also of the prosperity of an
individual; but I venture to hint that this mode of keeping up national
or individual credit is not likely to prove profitable in the long-run.
I have known this system to terminate sometimes literally in a long run,
by, the debtor finding himself compelled to take a very long run |E º
indeed.
“Financial reformers are in the habit of looking closely at bricks
and timber; but the family reformer, when he turns in that direction,
has no other bricks than Bath-bricks, no other timber than fire-wood
in his eye. The saving in these items cannot be considerable; but in
hops there may be great retrenchment; for the hop duty, or the duty of
giving a hop once or twice a year, involves an outlay that should be
either got rid of or curtailed. -
“In tobacco also there may be retrenchment, or at least in that dear
and unwholesome substitute, the cabbage-leaf, which is in almost every-
body's, mouth., Surely our youth might be satisfied with eating, as a
vegetable, what they madly smoke as a cigar; but, to take the greens in
both shapes, is a proof of viridity indeed.
“In our domestic establishments there is, I think, ample room for
reform; and in the first place I would call attention to those modern
innovations—the Pages—in which we may read the history of so much
useless expenditure. It is not the page alone that is costly, but every
page must be gilt-edged with lace and buttons, for the purpose of out-
shining his contemporary pages, until in time extravagance works its
own cure, and the page falls into a state of dog's-earism that brings
discredit, rather than credit, on the master to whom he belongs.
“Let me now take a glance at the Kitchen department, where I
would at once propose the breaking up of those foreign relations—
commonly called cousins—who add so much to the expenses of our
service... I do not see why this fearful despotism should be allowed to
prevail in our º any more than in our diplomatic and other
official departments, where it has been a ground of much complaint.
. “I would also call your attention to a sort of semi-military occupa-
tion of our establishments by policemen and others, who, in a spirit of
enterprise, deriving encouragement from our Cooks—if not from our
PARRYs and our RossEs—come on voyages of discovery to our larders,
and make a survey of what may happen to hang there from pole to
pole. I have no objection to the Police as a body, but I think you will
agree with me that they might, find a wider and worthier area than
either your area or mine, for their energies. -
“These are a few of my ideas on Family Financial Reform, which
I have placed on paper in humble imitation of MR. RICHARD CoBDEN,
whose great—and chiefly fº. because practical—movement in the
direction of retrenchment, I think it is my duty, your duty, and every-
body's duty to second as ably as we can.
“I have contributed my mite; and though, like most of my contribu-
tions, it is only upon paper, I am sure that your acceptance will give a
value to a document which is drawn in the name of
“Yours, very faithfully,
“J. DUNUP.”
“I CAN'T GET OUT.”
ABD-EL-KADER has written to PRINCE Louis-NAPOLEoN a letter, the
meaning of which is, “I can’t get out.” The Prince's answer has yet
to be printed. As Princes have so rarely the opportunity of com-
mencing their reign with a gracious action, we hope that PRINCE Louis
will avail himself of the present one, and follow up his shake of the
hand with GENERAL CAVAIGNAc by an act still more generous. If the
Prince is so inclined, the subjoined letter is perfectly at his service:–
"DEAR EMIR, -
“The motto of our good Republic is "Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.”
As France wishes even her enemies to acknowledge the truth of these
noble doctrines—as the President wishes every one in his dominions to
be a personal proof of them—I am too happy to send you the inclosed
order for your liberation. Be happy and free.
"In all fraternity,
“Louis-NAPOLEoN.”
We have no doubt, by the time this touching letter is printed, that
the Emir and his family will be on their way to Mecca.
THE WINDSOR PALACE PLAYS.
[By the “Court Newsman.”]
Ast night The Merchant of
Penice, written by WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE, was acted be:
fore HER MAJESTY and
Court, at Windsor Castle,
The actors had been picked
and sifted, for the occasion,
from the various London
theatres. They arrived at an
early hour in a waggon–
severely constructed after the
vehicle of THEspis—and, as
it may be supposed, excited
considerable attention as
they drove through Eton
and Windsor. The actors
were received at the Castle-
gate by the LoRD CHAMBER-
LAIN, and conducted by him
to the Buttery. Beef and ale
were liberally served out to
Tragedy, and Comedy-be-
stowed and enjoyed in the hearly spirit of the Elizabethan times.
The Play began at eight. HER MAJESTY had graciously commanded
the presence of all her Ministers; and there is every reason, to believe
that the effect of the scene will not be lost upon them. Many distin-
guished noblemen who, in the Lords, voted against the Jews' Bill, were
visibly affected by the appeal of Shylock to the feelings of our common
nature, and before the curtain fell, promised LoRD Russell their votes
on the ensuing Session. The CHANCELLOR of the ExchEQUER paid
the deepest attention to the calculations of the Hebrew money-lender;
and it is only reasonable to expect a very marked improvement in the
next Budget of SIR CHARLEs Wood. The sublimity of Portia's speech
in the attributes of Mercy made its way direct to the feelings of
the Home Secretary. Indeed, there can be no doubt that the great
object contemplated by HER MAJESTY in these performances, will be
most successfully achieved, and the Ministry, and the Court in
general, be much benefited by the dramatist and the player.
Q., WHY does a man stop growing tall when he begins to have
whiskers?
A. Because he begins to grow down.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 9
FRANCE's NEW TOY.
Less it! It will pull 'em to
pieces to see what they are
made of. It will discover for
itself what makes the noise in
the drum, the music in the
barrel-organ; what sets the
little fiddler fiddling, and the
old cobbler cobbling. Never
was such a child for destroying
its playthings.
It has just got another. Its
indulgent Fº will keep on
buying it fresh toys when the
old ones are smashed, or battered into ugliness, or flung aside from
weariness. And this last is a very pretty plaything, and it has the same
name as one the child was very fond of many years ago; and France
cried for it very hard, and “would have it; ” and, now she has got it;
and already there is a little half-disappointment that it won't do any-
thing but wag its head, and wave its arms and legs, when the player
pulls the string.
Already the newspapers hint at vague dissatisfaction and half-formed
antagonism. The new Ministry is not brilliant enough. It is neither a
RoBERT Houpin Ministry nor a Robert MacAIRE Ministry. It does
not promise work when no work is to be had, nor public wages, when
the #. is empty. It does not announce the dawn of a new era,
nor the abdication of selfishness, nor the arrival of universal fraternity.
It is not Louis-Philippist, to corrupt electors, nor Red Republican, to
keep Paris in terror of barricades and bayonets, nor Socialist, to
make property tremble and scowl all over France. It is nothing more
nor less than a steady-going Ministry, which seems content with such
miserable aims as to pay its debts, to keep at peace abroad, and to
maintain law and order at home.
Humbugs! Why, any Minister can aim at all that. It is like
M. Jourd'AIN, who discovers that he has been talking prose all his life.
No–France wants a Ministry like a turning-lathe, with an eccentric
chuck in it. She wants a Ministry to amuse her, to astonish her, to
tickle her—whether with fear, admiration, or disgust, matters little.
She wan's a Toy-Ministry, in fact, as well as a Toy-President.
PUNCH*S PATENT EXHILARATING GAS
COMPANY.
(Provisionally Registered.)
MR. PUNCH, in issuing the Prospectus of his Patent Exhilarating
Gas Company, disclaims, in the first place, the intention of puffing him-
self, or blowing his own trumpet, by representing the spirit of his
popular periodical as Exhilarating Gas. . This gaseous substance is no
other than the real, bond fide protoxide of nitrogen, discovered by
DR. PRIEstLY in the last century, but recently patented by Mr. Punch.
Mr. Punch has discovered that, by a graduated admixture with
atmospheric air, it exerts an elevating influence, verging from the out-
rageous merriment excited by a broad joke, to the gentle gaiety
imparted by quiet humour.
Accordingly, Mr. Punch proposes to erect Exhilarating Gas Houses
connected with a grand ramification of pipes, which will diffuse the
gas to any extent and in any direction that may be required.
. . It is recommended that an Exhilarating Gas-pipe should be carried
into each of the principal rooms of every dwelling-house. By turning
a stop-cock, the atmosphere of any room may be impregnated with the
gas to the requisite extent. . Every family will thus be provided with
the means of restoring good humour, when interrupted, in five minutes,
which will be an invaluable boom to the kitchen, the parlour, the
nursery, the domestic hearth, may, also to the conjugal pillow.
All the theatres, of course, will be supplied with the Exhilarating
Gas. If, during a comedy or a farce, the audience, as frequently hap-
pens, do not laugh, the gas will be turned on instantly. he Exhila-
rating Gas will thus prove a real blessing to authors, actors, and
managers.
As necessarily will the Exhilarating Gas be introduced into the
Houses of Parliament, where, in a few seconds, it will restore that
temper which some honourable gentlemen are so apt to lose, and which
is so sorely tried by certain prolix orators.
When we consider the immense influence of buoyant and hopeful
feeling on the commercial world; when we reflect that the panic of 1847
was, as it were, cured in an instant by the mere permission of Govern-
ment to relax the Bank Charter—as the toothache is sometimes arrested
by the sight of the forceps;, when we remember that the resignation of
a Whig Ministry will, simply by a moral influence, occasion an imme-
diate rise of the Funds, we shall see that the Exhilarating Gas will be
indispensable on the Stock Exchange, and in other places in the City
where merchants most do congregate. Combined with the mercantile
atmosphere, it will communicate that liveliness to tallow, that easiness
to indigo, and that briskness to business in general, which are so essen-
tial to national prosperity. - - - -
It is not too much to assert that the Exhilarating Gas, judiciously
employed, would have maintained Louis-PHILIPPE, the Ex-EMPEROR
of Austria, and the Pope, on their respective thrones, and saved the
KING of Prussia and GENERAL CAVAIGNAc a world of trouble. Mr.
Punch commerds it to the Government as an infallible means of pre-
serving order and tranquillity, and to enterprising capitalists as a safe
speculation, in the confident assurance that his Exhilarating Gas will
by no means turn out to be an airy bubble.

yery accomplishment, however trivial, has its Pro-
ſessors in these days; and the manipulation of the
Fan has at length taken its ... among our modern
Arts and Sciences. The following advertisement
giving an air of fashion:—
elegant companion, so indispensable to the distin-
guished, will be imparted by a º who is well skilled in
an exercise so charming and fascinating in the brilliant
society of the continent, particularly of the Court of Spain.
A fortnight's practice would remove that impression of
inaptitude and want of grace, hitherto so apparent in its
use in the most fashionable circles in this country. The lady will be at home
from 12 to 4 on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of each week, commencing
the 10th of January. The lessons are for the select few, at five guineas the course.
For cards of address, &c., &c.
. It seems that a fortnight's fanning is required “to remove the
impression of inaptitude and want of grace,” which no doubt goes very
far to prevent the success, which, on the principle of possunt qui passe
ridentur, none but the confident can realise. There is, it appears," in
the most fashionable circles in this country,” a consciousness of an
inability to grapple with the difficulties of the Fan, which is no less
humiliating to the spirit, than paralytic to the fingers. -
Though the Fan exercise is at present proposed to be limited “to the
select few, at five guineas the course,” we may hope to see it extended
to a more numerous class of our fellow (female) creatures; for when
twopence-halfpenny can place," in every honest hand” a fan, we do not
see why its fascinations should continue the monopoly of the highest
classes of society. , Perhaps, however, as the Fan is not an affair of
everyday use, the skill devoted to teaching it may be applied to some-
thing of more general utility, such as the cotton umbrella, which though
not a very promising instrument of fascination, could ...? be made
to “tell,” if the resources of Art were employed in making the most of
it. We must confess that we had rather see the aids of Science lavished
on something more useful than the Fan, and we should hail with delight
an attempt to bring the practice of the darning-needle to perfection, by
the institution of female classes for teaching the perfect command of
that most excellent weapon. We are convinced that man is more
assailable by the Needle than by the Fan; for if the latter goes to his
eye, the former goes to his heart, or, at all events, to his heel—for the
darning-needle comes home to his stockings—and the heel is, according
to classical authority, the vulnerable point of the hero, who would be
as much in danger from the bodkin as from the Fan, and would perhaps
be getting from the frying-pan into the fire, after all.

THE GLUT OF GOLD.
We trust that we shall hear no more about paying ten per cent: for
money, after the recent news from the far West, where the precious
metal is so abundant, that if any one yentures to ask more than three
per cent, he will be told to “go to California,” as being tantamount
to the recommendation to “Go to Bath.” . -
In the El Dorado lately discovered, it is not, simply the fact that
everything is gold that glitters, but a great deal that does not glitter
turns out to be gold. If the prospects of the place.are realised, we
shall soon learn to despise the humbler metals, and insist on having
our coal-scuttles, our cornets-à-piston, our warming-pans, and our door-
plates of the purest gold. We should strongly advise the CHANGELLOR
of THE ExchequER to take a small piece of ground at California, and
establish an office there for the immediate payment of the National
Debt, all in a lump, for there are plenty of lumps large enough for the
purpose, being dug up every day.
AN EQUESTRIAN PANTOMIME,
Boxing-NIGHT is no longer Boxing-night
at the two great theatres, where George
Barnwell used to murder his old uncle once
every year, amid impatient shouts for the
Pantomime to begin, and premature de-
mands for Tippitywitchet. The good old
times are past when Jane Shore used to
walk about the stage in a table-cloth, and
Gloucester laid bare his withered arm to a
#. from the gallery for Hot Codlins. Even
R. Cooper's London apprenticeship of
|N forty years has come to an end, and he no
longer appears in the double capacity of an
assassin and an apologist, as he alternately
made away with his aged relative on the
stage, and entreated silence from the over-
crowded audience. No more does he rise
from emptying the avuncular pocket in the
fourth act, to announce the readiness of the
M ement to return the money of any lady or gentleman who feels
dissatisfied with the accommodation afforded. No longer does he throw
himself, one moment, on his unsuspecting relative, and throw himself,
the next moment, on the “usual indulgence,” &c. &c., of a “British
audience.”
The Christmas play, and the Christmas pantomime, the farce in
five ac's, followed by the harlequinade in one, have disappeared
rom both of our large theatres, though at Drury Lane the holiday
folks have an entertainment well worthy of their Fº . --The
horsemanship of the Cirque National de Paris, which was the Cirque
Royale, a year ago, and will perhaps be, the Cirque. Imperiale on
its next visit, will in some degree compensate the public for the absence
of the Christmas entertainments of other º and we have certainly
seen actors less intelligent at Drury Lane than the animals who now
strut and fret, or trot and gallop their hour in the sawdust. We only
wonder that the skill andingenuity of FRANgoni and his colleagues have
not been exercised in getting up a regular Equestrian Pantomime,
which we have no *:
the sagacity of their stud
would have been quite
equal to.
The docility of the horse
Pyramus need golittle fur-
ther than it does already,
to bring him into the º:
as Clown, with a look ex-
pressive of “Here weare!”
and his most accomplished
companion, Thisbe, would
have made an admirable
Columbine. The stud
would easily supply a Har-
lequin capable of all the
feats that the human Har-
lequin has ever achieved,
from the twirling round of
the head—a feat, after all,
that is little more... than
an imitation of incipient
staggers-to the leaping
through a window, an
achievement that could be gone through without risk, as the blanket
to catch the animal on the other side could be held with ease by
some of the powerful athlètes of the company. One of the elderly
horses on the establishment—the one, for instance, that is brought
into the circle to be jumped over by the voltigeurs-would be well
adapted for the rôle of Pantaloon. ...And we throw out the hint to
the French troupe, that they may add to the attractions of their very
admirable performances by a horse-pantomime.
BAR RULES.
The Incorporated Law Society have been drawing up a series of
rules as to retainers, general and special, which MR. BRIEFLess declares
he will not submit to. As he has not yet had either a general or special
retainer in any case whatever, it is probable that this magnanimous
resolution may be safely adhered to. -
“But who are the Incorporated Law Society,” he asks, “that they
should draw up rules for the Bar?” Such rules can be no more than
rules nisi, that is, unless the Barrefuse to submit to them. -
However, this series of rules for attornies in their dealings with the
Bar should be retorted by a series of rules for the Baron their dealings
with attornies—such as the following:-
As to Retainers.
A general retainer means nothing more than that the barrister is to
have a brief in every cause of his client's. It does not bind him to be
in Court when the case comes on, or to know anything about it.
Any number of special retainers may be accepted for any number of
causes, though in different Courts, and set down for the same day. The
barrister cannot be in several places at once; but his brief may.
As to Fees.
No fees are to be returned under any circumstances whatever.
Estate in fee is the largest estate known to the law, and he who
abandons such an estate is a fee-simpleton. At the same time, a
barrister's fee is not a fee conditional on his doing the work paid for.
As to the Barrister's Duty in conducting a Case.
This duty is plain and absolute. It is to get averdict–homestly if he
can—but to get it.
. Considerations of truth and falsehood do not enter into addresses tº
juries. Statements in such addresses, may be classed among legal
fictions. Pleadings ought to show colour, but the advocate never,
however shameful his case may be.
It is hoped that every barrister in the Queen's Bench (and elsewhere)
will live within the rules.
The Quadrant Columns.
WILL nobody buy the Quadrant Columns? or must they remain to
remind the classical tourist of the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter,
removed from Italy, in consequence of the recent disturbances? We
admit their apparent uselessness; but surely a suggestive imagination
might picture them as gas-pipes, or mains for the laying on of water, or
ornamental sentry-boxes for the soldiery; to which latter use they might
be converted by cutting away a piece to enable the gallant, fellows to
et in and out. By the way, as nothing, seems too gigantic for the
ungs of M.P.RosPERE, we think one of the Quadrant Columns might
be converted into a monster ophicleide for his especial use. We should
like to hear him play “Blow high, blow low” on such a wondrous
instrument.

JONATHAN’S GOLDEN HARWEST.
(From our American Correspondent.)
ExPECT you have read in some of them Greek and
Roman story-books, that makes the chief part of
the schoolin' of you Britishers, the yarn of JASON
and the Golden Fleece, and also about the Golden
Apples of the Hesperides. The Golden Fleece, I
take it, was great cry, and very little, wool, and
I estimate that the Golden Apples warn’t no ways
comparable to New Town Pippins. Well, however,
I can tell you that American Truth flogs Ancient
Mythology—that’s a fact. We’ve got a real
Golden Chersonesus in California, and a genuine
Pactolus in the river Sacramento. I guess MIDAs
would have giv his ears for our Mormon Diggins,
and old CREsus, would have swopped Lydia for
- San Francisco. ToM TIDLER's ground arn’t mothen
to this here location. There’s not a little gutter flowing into the main
stream but what, with a couple of active niggers, you may scrape ten
thousand dollars-worth of gold out on it, in one week. You’ve onl
got to walk into the bed of the river and pick up the pebbles, whic
is almost pure bullion. . The very, airth of the banks stumps your
March dust, a bushel of which, I’ve heer'd say, is worth a king's
ransom. The Scotch labourers in these fixins saves the very scrapins
of their shoes, and whittles their nails into the melting-pot... I calcu:
late that, a month's diggin at the banks of the Sacramento would
be a better speculation for your physical force Chartists, than the
plunder of the Bank of England.
Well; here we are in a state of excitement that beats any camp:
meetin iever sighted. Young and old off we go, leavin our trades and
callins, our stores, and families, away to California like flocks of
pigeons. Our Golden Fever caps your Railway Mania. By the last
accounts there was to be seen the glorious spectacle of four thousand
of our enterprisin citizens a scratchin and scrapin away in the Sacra-
mento from mornin to night, as fast as so many bears arter wild honey.
The common wages of helps is thirteen dollars a-day; you may get
eight-and-forty, for a bowie-knife, and eighty for a blanket; besides
doin a powerful deal of business with the benighted Ingines in printed
stuffs and ribbons.
The advantages of this, here splendoriferous discovery to our great
country will be inestimable. Icompute that we shall soon see no such
a thing as a cent in all our model Republic. We won't demean our-
selves by a currency of small change under silver. I contemplate that
we are set up with our gold mines to all eternity, and shall have
nothin to do but lay up our heels, enjoyin our cigars and *...".
for everlastin. In course, we shall be masters of the whole world, for
gold is the sinners of war, and our pockets bein chock full on it, will
enable us to lick universal creation.
The Europeans, and especially you Britishers, will be our slaves, and
niggers; we shall chuck our pusses to you and take your manuſacturs,
which you, poor critturs, will come and lay at our feet. We shall
leave you warmint to produce, while we only consume...We shall be a
kinder Aristocracy among the nations of the airth., We shall, knock
our glasses and crockery into an immortal smash, and all eat and drink
out of ; plate...When we go a shootin' we shall load our rifles with
golden bullets. We shall roll and waller in gold, like hogs in a swamp,
or the sea-sarpent among the foaming billers. But you’ll tell me,
perhaps, that gold, in the mean time, may become dirt cheap, and that
we may find ourselves in the end overloaded with yellow rubbish, and
destitute of the rale wealth of nations, which arter all is their indus:
trial produce. You may pint to the example of Qld Spain in proof of
what may come of gold mines. But don't you give us none of your
bark. It won't cure us of our gold fever, mohow, I tell you. You'll
only rile us, and make us wicked ugly, and provoke that dander which,
when riz, is a mixtur of the airthquake and the alligator, with a touch
of the lightnin.
Rather too Personal and Pointed.
An Italian paper º most * against any foreign inter-
vention which would be likely to lead the Pope back to Rome at the
#. of foreign bayonets. We are sure that this is a point which the
ope would not like to press for a moment. There are certain points
in argument, which, it is said, drive a person home very hard. Now
we should think the above point, if enforced against the Pope, would
be one of them.
* ALL A-GROWING...”
QLD PATERFAMILLAs is blest with a very large family, and is always
calling in the assistance of the tailor; so much so, that upon being asked
what he considered the most “growing evil?” he answered, “Boys'
Clothes.”
PORTERS STATISTICS.
If that celebrated porter ATLAs—the Pickford of Antiquity, who
carried the whole world, without even the aid of a knot, upon his
shoulders—should re-appear upon the earth, he would hardly be strong
enough for the place” of porter at the Witham Station of the Eastern
Counties Railway. There is on the spot a meeting of two or three
lines; so that the official in attendance finds himself always in the midst
of a very trying juncture....The impossibility of doing three things at
once will occasion a collision now and then; but we believe the
Directors think of advertising for a sort of human three-in-one to fill
the situation at Witham: his duties being to turn the points, ring the
bell, and work the telegraph. We understand that an individual who
squints is always preferred on this line; for the faculty of looking,two
ways at once is likely to be useful to him in the discharge of his duty.
This accounts for the numerous startling cases of strabismus one meets
with along this line; but as motion is not quite so rapid as vision, it
sometimes happens that the porters are destined to see danger in two
places at once, without the possibility of avoiding
it. A troop of railway acrobats, for the service º
of the economically managed lines, would perhaps \\
be found useful; and if the porters could be trained -
. as Vauxhall DIAvoli, to make rapid descents V-
along the electric telegraph wires from station to |
station, º would be enabled to get from one
post to another in time to be on duty almost at two
places at once.

The Shabby Dog.
Among the workings of conscience that appear from time to time, in
the shape of payments to the CHANCELLOR of the Excheques, there
was on Saturday a case of the return of “$5, from a party who took
with him an article of that value, on leaving a Government Office.
Who could have been the shabby fellow that, on quitting the public
service, carried off some moveable_or_other, from the rºoms of the
department in which he had served? The Government Offices do not
abºund in articles of knick-knackery, that could be very easily carried
away without detection, and we wonder, therefore, how the pilferer
managed to effect his paltry purpose unobserved. Could he possibly
have smuggled a clock under his cloak, or boned an officialinkstand, or
runoff with the scraper, or pocketed the thermometer?—though any of
these suggestions is negatived by the fact of its being a single article
worth five pounds, that the fellow purloined! The affair is certainly
one of the shabbiest that the ammals of a stricken conscience-as read
in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's advertisements—have ever
disclosed.

THE TROOPS OF THE TEMPLE,
THE inhabitant of the Temple little thinks of the vastness of the
arrangements for his comfort, protection, and defence, until Boxing-
day brings whole cohorts to the door of his chambers for the guerdons
that have been won in the course of the past twelvemonth. . The effect
is somewhat like that of the sudden discovery of the warriors in the
Lady of the Lake, at the Royal Italian Opera, when the scene is changed
from a solitude into a sort of camp crowded with soldiery. During the
ordinary portion of the year, the Templar sees little of the array of
retainers—except those retainers, that reach him in his professional
capacity—which start up around him on the arrival of Boxing-day.. . It
is then he discovers that there have been two day watchmen exercising
their watchfulness over him in the day; two night watchmen to protect
him in the night; two day gate-keepers to guard the frontier against
Fleet Street incursionists; two night gate-keepers to sit under the
archway after nine, P.M., and keep each other company; two wardens,
the nature of whose services time may perhaps one day reveal, though
we have not been able, as yet, to solve the mystery; two head porters,
whose office it is to hold their heads above the two under porters, whose
porterage is of the º nature, and consists in carrying a cane.
These are a few of the Temple guardians whom Boxing-day, brings
forth to solicit the exercise of that “seasonable benevolence,” which
consists in emptying one's pocket of one's loose silver, in compliance
with a custom which everybody would vote for the abolition of.
The Templars should, however, consider themselves let off cheaply
with the comparatively small army that is kept up, when there might
be found pretexts for adding considerably to the force engaged in
demanding largess at Christmas-time.
of Hare Court does not suggest the institution of a couple of game-
keepers—that Pump Court is not represented on Boxing-day by a
couple of Pompiers, or Pump-men—that Fig Tree Court has not its
brace of fig-gatherers, to present themselves figged out in full uniform,
for the purpose of receiving the customary gratuities of the season–
and that the Temple Fountain is not represented by a duo of turncocks
at this festive period. . .
We doubt whether it is good policy for this glut of functionaries to
come forth even once a-year; for in these days of retrenchment, when
everybody is crying out for a reduction of our army, and, at all events,
a cutting down of the number of superfluous officers, it is very probable
that the superfluous officers of the Temple may come in for a little
wholesome retrenchment.
THE GOLDEN AGE COME AT LAST.
IT seems that the people at California are digging up gold at such a
rate that we may expect to have the precious metal so precious cheap,
that gold, instead of being a mere mineral, will become a drug in the
market. This really golden opportunity that has just presented itself
to the people of California has embarrassed the Government to an awful
extent, for everybody is running away to dig gold, except the Governor
himself, who, at the date of our last dispatch, was blacking his own
boots, cooking his own dinner, and making his own bed, because all his
servants had taken it into their heads to “run for gold,” leaving him to
enjoy his otium cum dig, while they were engaged on a dig of a more
profitable character. It is horribly º to his unfortunate
Excellency, who would gladly turn excavator on his own account, in a
soil of such unprecedented richness; but a feeling of what is due to
his position prevents him from abdicating his post of trust and honour
for the purpose of securing what might be due to his pocket. Every.
body is clearing his hundreds a-day, except the Governor, who finds
himself “alone in his glory,” and is compelled to do all the official
work by himself, as well as the domestic work of Government House;
for there is not a functionary, from his highest secretary to his lowest
stable-boy, that will stop with him on the Government pay, when the
gold mines present a scale of renumeration so very much above what
the public coffers can furnish. We are daily expecting to hear that the
Governor can stand it no longer, but that he has gone in with the rest
tº: for a share of the golden harvest that is being reaped in
Ornla.
Poor Young Thing.
THE experience of the nursery should cause every father of a family
to make allowance for the French Republic, which must be liable to
convulsions during its period of infancy. When we consider that iſ
has hardly had time to gut its teeth, we ought not to wonder that there
are yet no symptoms of its wisdom-teeth, which, it is to be hoped, will
come by and by.
THE LONG AND SHORT OF I.T.
THE old proverb, says “A miss is as good as a mile;” but when we
look at the extraordinary length of MR. BANVARD's Panorama, we may
say that a Miss-issipi is as good as three miles.
We wonder that the existence

REWARDS OF AUTHORSHIP.
THE papers have been talking about the £600 a year, for ten years
to be paid to MR.M.AcAulay for his History of England. This is cited
as an instance of high remuneration; but the public may not, perhaps,
be aware of the rate received by the writers of Punch for their inspira-
tions and flashes of genius. It is true that the process of paying them
is something like giving change for diamonds, or dissolving pearls in
the drops of a metallic currency; but, nevertheless, attempts are made
to attach something like an adequate money value to the contributors
to this periodical. -
Some of the merely average jokes have brought to their authors a
graceful little compliment in the way of Consols; and an Epigram
has been, not unfrequently, acknowledged by a small parcel of Ex-
chequer Bills. Every one of the writers has affluence secured to him
in his old age, by a judicious investment in the Deferred Annuities:
and it may not, perhaps, be generally known, that a magnificent site
has been already taken—Punch hopes the public will excuse him for
taking a site on this occasion—for erecting a splendid range of build-
ings for the reception of the decayed contributors. The absurdity of
looking for decay in this quarter, for the next century at least, caused
the site to be let on a lease for ninety-nine years, at the expiration of
which period the contingency may possibly happen which it has been
intended to provide against.
SWEARING AND DRUNKENNESS.
According to a recent Police report in the Morning Post, one JAMEs
Johnson alias Robertson was brought before the LoRD MAYOR on
a charge of stealing paper, which he alleged that he had purchased.
The case having been dismissed for want of evidence-
“The prisoner, who was tipsy, and appeared to be overjoyed at the order issued
for his discharge, was then called upon as a witness against the young man whom
he had pointed out as the seller of the paper to him. At first he hesitated to undergo
the ceremony of swearing, but upon being told that it was in the Lond MAvon's
power to commit him if he refused, he seized the Testament, and kissed it with
rapture.”
We have sometimes heard of people swearing when tipsy, but never
before of any one being sworn—at least, before a magistrate-in a state
of intoxication. In vino veritas may be a sound proverb; but for all that,
we really must protest against taking an affidavit from a man in liquor.
MR. Johnson alias Robertson, in spite of his kissing the Testament
with rapture, could scarcely have been aware of the nature of an oath,
nor, we imagine, could the worshipful Court which could administer
one under such circumstances.

CHILD’S PARTIES :
AND A REMONSTRANCE CONCERNING THEMI.
oNDEscENDING SIR, . . . .
As # publication
(which an admirable critic in
the Quarterly Review justly
pronounces to be the wonder
of the age) finds its way to
almost every drawing-room
table in this metropolis, and is
read by the young and old in
every family, I beseech you to
give admission to the remon-
strance of an unhappy parent,
and to endeavour to put a stop
to a practice which * to
me to be increasing daily, and
is likely to operate most inju-
riously upon the health, morals,
and comfort of society in
general.
The awful spread of Juve-
NILE PARTIES, Sir, is the fact
to which I would draw your
attention. There is no end to
those entertainments, and if the custom be not speedily checked, people will be obliged to fly
from London at Christmas, and hide their children during the holidays. I gave mine warning
in a speech at breakfast this day, and said with tears in my eyes that if the Juvenile Party
system went on, I would take a house at Margate next winter, for that, by Heavens! I could
not bear another Juvenile Season in London.
If they would but transfer Innocent's Day to the summer holidays, and let the children
have their pleasures in May or June, we might get on. But now in this most ruthless and
cut-throat season of sleet, thaw, frost, wind, snow, mud, and sore-throats, it is quite a tempting
of fate to be going much abroad; and this is the time of all others that is selected for the
amusement of our little darlings. -
As a first step towards the remedying of the evil of which I complain, I am obliged to look
Mr. Punch himself in his venerable beard, and say, “You, Sir, have, by your agents, caused not
a little of the mischief. I desire that, during Christmas time at least, MR. LEECH should be
abolished, or sent to take a holiday. Judging from his sketches, I should say that he must
be endowed with a perfectly monstrous organ of philoprogenitiveness; he revels in the
delineation of the dearest and most beautiful little boys and girls in turned-down collars and
broad sashes, and in the Almanack, just published, produces a picture of a child's costume ball,
in which he has made the little wretches in the dresses of every age, and looking so happy,
beautiful, and charming, that I have carefully kept the §. from the sight of the women
and children of my own household, and—I will not say burned it, for I had not the heart to
do that—but locked it away privately, lest they should conspire to have a costume ball them-
selves, and little Polly should insist upon appearing in the dress of Ann Bullen, or little
JAçKY upon turning out as an Ancient Briton.” -
An odious, revolting, and disagreeable practice, Sir, I say, ought not to be described in a
manner so atrociously pleasing. The real satirist, has no right to lead the public astray about
the Juvenile Fête nuisance, and to describe a child's ball as if it was a sort of Paradise, and
the little imps engaged as happy and pretty as so many cherubs. They should be drawn, one
and all, as hideous—disagreeable–distorted—affected—jealous of each other—dancin
awkwardly—with shoes too tight for them—over-eating themselves at supper—very unwe
(and deservedly so) the next morning, with Mamma administering a mixture made after the
Doctor's prescription, and which should be painted awfully black, in an immense large teacup,
and (as might be shown by the horrible expression on the little patient's face) of the most
disgusting flavour. Banish, I say, that MR. LEECH during Christmas time, at least; for by a
misplaced kindness and absurd fondness for children, he is likely to do them and their parents
an incalculable quantity of harm.
As every man, Sir, looks at the world out of his own eyes or spectacles, or, in other words,
speaks of it as he finds it himself, I will lay before you my own case, being perfectly sure that
many another parent will sympathise with me. My family, already inconveniently large, is yet
constantly on the increase, and it is out of the question that MRs. SPEc should go to parties,
as that admirable woman has the best of occupations at home, where, she is always nursing
the baby. Hence, it becomes the father's duty to accompany his children abroad and to give
them pleasure during the holidays.
Our own place of residence is in South Carolina Place, Clapham Road North, in one of the
most healthy of the suburbs of this great City. But our relatives and acquaintances are
numerous; and they are spread all over the town and its outskirts. MRS. S. has sisters
married, and dwelling respectively in Islington, Haverstock Hill, Bedford Place, Upper
Baker Street, and Tyburn Gardens; besides the children's grandmother, Kensington Gravel
Pits, whose parties we are all of course obliged to attend. A very great connexion of ours,
and nearly related to a B-r-n-t and M.P., lives not a hundred miles from B-lgr-ve Square.
I could enumerate a dozen more places where our kinsmen or intimate friends are—heads of
families every one of them, with their quivers more or less full of little arrows.
. What is the consequence? I herewith send it to, you in the shape of these eighteen
inclosed notes, written in various styles, more, or less correct, and corrected from Miss
FANNy's, aged seven, who hopes, in round hand, that her dear cousins will come and drink tea
with her on New Year's Eve, her birth-day,+to that of the Governess of the B-r-n-t in
question who requests the pleasure of our company at a ball, a conjuror, and a Christmas
Tree. . SPEC, for the valid reason above stated, cannot frequent these meetings: I am the
deplorable chaperon of the young people...I am
ed upon to conduct my family five miles to
tea at six o'clock. No count is taken of our
personal habits, hours of dinner, or intervals of
rest. We are made the victims of an infantile
conspiracy, nor will the lady of the house hear
of any revolt or denial.
“Why,” says she, with the spirit which
becomes a woman and mother, “you go to
your man's parties eagerly enough: what an un-
natural wretch tº: must be to grudge your
children their P. She looks round,
sweeps all six of them into her arms, whilst the
baby, on her lap begins to bawl, and you are
assailed by seven pairs of imploring eyes, against
which there is no appeal. You must go. . If you
are dying of lumbago, if you are engaged to the
best of dinners, if you are longing to stop at
home and read Macaulay, you must give up all
and go.
And it is not to one or two, but to almost
all. You must go to the Gravel Pits, otherwise
the Grandmother will cut the children out of her
will, and leave her property to her other grand:
children. If you refuse Islington, and accept
Tyburn Gardens, you sneer at a poor relation, and
acknowledge a rich one readily enough. If you
decline Tyburn Gardens, you fling...away, the
chances of the poor dear children in life, and the
hopes of the cadetship for little JACKY. If you
go to Hampstead, having declined Bedford Place,
it is because you never refuse an invitation to
Hampstead, where they make much of you, and
Miss MARIA is pretty, (as you think, though your
wife doesn't,) and do not care for the Doctor in
Bedford Place. And if you accept Bedford Place,
you dare not refuse Upper Baker Street, because
there is a coolness between the two families, and
you must on no account seem to take part with
one or the other.
In this way many a man besides myself, Idare
say, finds himself miserably tied down, and a
helpless prisoner, like GULLIVER in the hands of
the Liliputians. Let us just enumerate a few
of the miseries of the pitiable parental slave..
In the first place, examine the question in a
pecuniary point of view. The expenses of chil-
dren's toilets at this present time is perfectly
frightful.
y eldest boy, GUSTAVUs, at home from DR.
BIRCH's Academy, Rodwell Regis, wears tur-
quoise studs, fine limen shirts, white waistcoats,
and shiny boots; and, when I proposed that he
should go to a party in Berlin gloves, asked me
if I wished that he should be mistaken for a
footman?
My second, AUGUSTUs, grumbles about get-
ting his elder brother's clothes, nor could he be
brought to accommodate himself to GUSTAyus's
waistcoats at all, had not his mother coaxed him
§ the loan of her chain and watch, which latter
the child broke, after many desperate attempts
to wind it up. -
As for the little fellow, ADoIPHUs, his mother
has him attired in a costume partly Scotch, partly
Hungarian, mostly buttons, and with a LOUIs
QUATORze hat and scarlet feather, and she curls
this child's hair with her own blessed tongs,
every night. -
I wish she would do as much for the girls,
though: but no, MonsLEUR FLORIDOR must do
that ; and accordingly, every day this season,
that abominable little Frenchman, who is, I have
no doubt, a Red Republican, and smells of cigars
and hair-oil, comes over, and, at a cost of
eighteenpence par, téte, figs out, my little, crea-
tures' heads with fixature, bandoline, crinoline-
the deuce knows what. -
The bill for silk stockings, sashes, whitefrocks,
is so enormous, that I have not been able to pay
my own tailor these three years.
The bill for flys to 'Amstid and back, to
Hizzlinton and take up, &c., is fearful. The
drivers, in this extra weather, must be paid

THE FORCE OF HABIT.

thing of the kind. This comes from accustoming a
nation to such strong stimulants.

that it is almost frightened out of its life if a fortnight
passes without one.
EDUCATION |
From one of the Rising Generation to another of ditto.
“DEAR CHARLIE,
“Is N'T it abominable that a fellow can’t take up the Times
newspaper, during the holidays, just to see what they’re doing at the
Palace and the Playhouses, without a chance of running bang against
a column or two of “Education’ in the advertisements? It does make
a fellow’s blood run cold to see what gammon is put there, and all to
carry away a chap from the comforts of home, the pantomimes, and the
pleasure of teasing his sister. How they do bait their traps to catch
us! I’ve just run through a few of 'em. One ‘A. B.’ says that for
six guineas a quarter there’s “Education, premises, treatment, diet, &c.,
all first-rate.’ Why, it can't be done: I should be ashamed to learn
anything—'twould be robbing 'em—for the money. Another, for next
to nothing, offers
“" Latin, French, German, Greek, composition, arithmetic, surveying, algebra,
music, drilling, &c.; superior penmanship, salubrious situation, polite deportment,
unlimited diet, excellent library, and a happy home’
—and all at a price that can't come to two-and-sixpence an article, the
unlimited diet and happy home by no means included. There’s a place
at Twickenham, where ‘the pupils enjoy unusual domestic advantages.’
What’s that? Leave, no doubt, for every young gent. to buy his own
cigars, and use his own warming-pan. Here’s another—a beauty:—
“‘The above sum (50 guineas) includes instruction by professors of the first
eminence, in the following accomplishments—the pianoforte, French, drawing in
various styles, dancing, writing, &c., and the use of the globes, together with books,
laundress, dºg. The family arrangements are conducted upon the most liberal
scale, including wine and porter when necessary.”
“I don't say much of the style of this, CHARLIE; but wouldn't old
BUzWIG give it us, if we didn't make better work of our syntax. Do
the wine and porter come in with books, laundress, &c. P. When are they
judged necessary—and when not? Here's another: where—(for £22
per annum)-
“‘The table is supplied with the best provisions, without limitation, and every
domestic indulgence afforded.”
“That is, latch-key at night, and breakfast abed in the morning.
“One 'Omicron’ advertises for a precious rum lot, “Spoiled Boys’
or Wayward Ones.” He is going for Holy Orders, and having—
“In conjunction with other liberal branches of education, closely compared the
phases of the mind, and associated them with the grades of mental capacity, from
the thinking mind to the low idiots, affords PRIVATE TUITION TO Little
BOYS, ladies' school, adults under strict secrecy, enduring those bitter hangers-on
of neglected education, which, however, soon vanish under a right system.’
“Dreadful, isn't it, CHARLIE, to think, that we should be advertised
for in this fashion—all of us, from bright chaps to low idiots—as if
‘Education” was a sort of sleight-of-hand-like a trick of the Wizard
of the North's—and as if, at the smallest charge, even a low idiot could
be set on his legs for a Chancellor of the Exchequer. -
“Do you know what was brought to my mind when I considered
this long line of ‘Education’ bait in the newspaper? Why, Ithought
of that sly, knowing old chap, SLEEK, the miller, who, when he can do
nothing else, squats down upon the bank, and bobs for eels. He looks
|so kind, and smiles so all the time he’s bobbing, and when he's caught
his fish—his young friends—he walks home, skins 'em, cuts 'em to
bits, and makes his dinner off 'em. -

THE NIGHTINGALE THAT SINGS IN THE WINTER,
JENNY LIND
TO
* Rotº puts tº
WHEN the waters are stark, and the crystalline snow
Sparkles keen and unchanged in the morn's ruddy glow,
And the prism-coloured icicles flash in the sun,
The bitter cold stills all the song-birds but one.
Now the limnet, the lark, and the throstle are dumb,
E’en the stout little wren’s gallant heart is o'ercome,
And the Nightingale, warbler so wondrous of tone,
That sings in the winter, is tuneful alone.
Sweetest creature, in song without rival or peer,
Far more inwardly vibrate thy notes than the ear,
For there speaks in that music, pure, gentle, refined,
The exquisite voice of a beautiful º
Of a spirit of earnestness, goodness, and truth,
Of a heart full of tender compassion and ruth,
Ever ready to comfort, and succour, and bless,
sorrow and suffering, in want and distress.
And the Nightingale's name by faint voices is praised,
For poverty aided and Charities raised;
Not more good was the bird in whom childhood believes—
The Redbreast that cover'd the children with leaves.
And in tribute and love to a Memory revered
By her magical voice noble monuments reared,
The high-minded communion with Genius attest,
Which gloriously thrills in the Nightingale's breast.
Now this Nightingale rare, in the winter who sings,
º not yet a seraph, is one without wings;
And her name, which has travell'd as wide as the wind,
Is kind-hearted, generous, dear JENNY LIND.
A WIRE-DRAWN MESSAGE.
THE Electric Telegraph has been complimented lately upon an enormous feat of
sºrength in transmitting, from one corner of America to the other, the President’s
Message. We are ready to admit this Herculean power of carrying a weight,
which no light porter, under the united constitutions of Hercuſſes and Atias,
could possibly have lifted. There was never such a Message, and the strongest
pair of lungs must have been exhausted in delivering it. It occupied six or seven
close columns of the Times, and took the poor Electric Telegraph some six-and-
thirty hours before it got to the end of it. Still, we do
not think the powers of the Telegraph have been properly
tested even by this interminable Message.
There is a feat of strength still more wonderful for it to
accomplish. It has never been submitted yet to the ordeal
of one of MR. ANSTEY's speeches.
through one of these—say the shortest—we will acknow-
ledge that the Electric Telegraph has powers of endurance
to hold up under anything; but then, again, there is a
most serious question, which common sense cannot help
utting to the charitable mind—What has the Electric
:* done to deserve such an unparalleled shock of
cruelty? There is a limit to all things—the American Sea-
Serpent always excepted—and we think the American
Message is the utmost stretch which wire is capable of
yielding to. If it is rash enough to undertake one of The
CHIs Holm speeches, it will certainly require nothing less
than ether or chloroform, together with the magical aid of
MR. Robert Houdin, to sustain it under the tremendous
“Suspension AErienne.”
ANOTHER GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
It is not only at California that a golden harvest is to be
made, but such things may be met with nearer home, and
the newspapers have lately been noticing something of the
kind in the shape of a “Golden Lectureship.” This tit-bit
is quite worthy of any morceau, lying about the new, Tom
Tiddler's ground, where everybody isliterally, as the old song
says, “picking up gold and silver.” The Golden Lecture-
ship requires not even a pickaxe to pick it up; though it
is, to a certain extent, “to be had for --

who thought it ought never to rain good luck unless it
also poured, and who consequently presented himself to
the best thing he could get hold of, as if some witch, like
those in Macbeth, had whispered in his ear, “Hale! all
hale!”—since, we repeat, this celebrated case, we have
heard of nothing so good as Melville with his £2000 a
year looking out for an extra five hundred from the almost
sinecure office of the Golden Lectureship.
THE “TERRIFIC” SENTRY DUTY.
A CoRREspondent, writing, under the signature of
EMERITUs, in the Times, though justly complaining of the
undue privileges of the household troops, adds the remark
that “the night and sentry duty of fondon is indeed
terrific.” We can testify from actual knowledge to the
truth of this observation. Any one who has watched the
gallant fellows during the season, undergoing the fatigues
of an opera campaign, must have remarked the jaded
appearance of the officeria command, after listening from
his box—on these occasions a sort of sentry box—to the
strains of JENNY LIND, while the private soldiers in the
sts, and
vestibule below, occupy the out
lazing coal one-of the
selves to the constant fire—a
manager. -
These duties, however, are nothing to the very severe
service performed at the gates of the Parks, which, we
resume, forms the “terrific” sentry dut
MERITts. We have ourselves, seen a gallant, fellow ex-
posed to the shells—we mean the periwinkle shells—of a
juvenile foe, secreted behind the Nelson Column; and we
have witnessed the embarrassment of the hero to ascertain
the quarter whence the attack proceeded. The duty at the
entrance to the town of Kensington is sometimes very
harassing, particularly in case of collision with the civil or
uncivil power of abuse from the omnibus cads, and others
expose them-
escribed by
who frequent, in a more or less friendly or hostile spirit,
this populous neighbourhood. At Storey's Gate, the
service is frequently terrific indeed, and we have sometimes
observed the most fearful collisions between the trooper on
duty and some determined washerwoman, resolved on
forcing a passage at the point of the clothes-basket.
When we remember that these exhausting achievements
require the soldiery to remain on duty for two consecutive
hours, without any relief, the nature of their exploits is
better capable of being thoroughly appreciated.

DEATH OF AGITATION.
LATELY died in Ireland, after several years of profitable
business, during which he accumulated a handsome fortune in
the most stirring times of his unfortunate country, the cele-
brated disturber of the peace, called AGITATION: The deceased
led a most active life, and there was º a village in
Ireland where he was not known... He had an immense
number of followers, who lived on the spoil he collected on
his route. This monster—for he had but very few attributes
of a reasoning being—was noted for his enormous appetite,
which was truly insatiable. The more he had, the more he
wanted; and the thousands upon thousands he cleared from
his distressed country was the only relief, it, ever, received
from his hands. Where he found happiness, he left discontent,
—and shrieks and fires and tumultuous assemblages and utter
misery, followed his steps, everywhere. He was literally a
trader in the destitution of his countrymen—a wholesale dealer
in rags. The monster is now dead. His effects are sold of
—his race is almost extinct—his one or two disciples have
lately abjured, in shame and poverty, his abandoned cause-
Agitation is now no more! He died without a struggle,
sincerely unregretted by every one. His timely decease be-
ueathes to Ireland the hope that she may enjoy (at last) a
#. New Year.
A Solemn Denial.
THE Legislature of South Carolina, in opposition to the
free movement, has put forth certain resolutions against any
|attempt to meddle with man-selling:—
“We solemnly deny the power of Congress, under the federal compact, to
interfere, directly or indirectly, with the existence of slavery in the district
| | of Columbia, or to prohibit its introduction into any territory acquired by
treaty, or by the joint arms of the separate sovereign and independent
States of this confederacy, or into any portion of this continent.”
Something at once impudent and grim in this solema denial.
: “We solemnly deny” the right of the Police—say pickpockets
—to interfere with us, in our vocation. Or, if they do not
say so, it is only that the stealers of chattels have more shame
than the robbers of human flesh.
“I Know A BANK.”—The Sacramento (in California) is the
safest Bank to draw upon, as not a single draught has yet
been returned “No effects.”
PUNCH AT WINDSOR CASTLE.
THE Court Newsman, with that jealousy which is so frequent among
our brethren of the press, omitted to insert the name of Punch among the
distinguished individuals forming the audience at the Private Theatri-
cals at Windsor Castle. An invitation .."; been forwarded by
GENERAL (Postman) Jones, of the fleet-footed Fleet Street division,
Punch proceeded to the “abode of Royalty,” where he was received in
the archest way, under the great archway, by a Maid of Honour, the
presence of Gold, Silver, and the other Sticks being dispensed with,
it having been understood that all Sticks should be strictly excluded on
the occasion of a play being acted before HER MAJESTY.
Previous to the opening of the doors of the RUBENs Room, Punch
found himself waiting outside as one of a most aristocratic crowd of
ten or twelve, all preparing for the rush, and wearing their orders on
their breasts, as the É. Flay Bill did not contain an intimation,
that “not a single order would on any account be admitted.”
Punch, being anxious to “stand by his order,” like the rest of the
audience, wore on his chest a superb gallery check, from the Treasury
of the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and on the opening of the doors,
every effort was made to give the semblance of a real play to the
Windsor theatricals. Punch himself raised an occasional cry of “Keep
back!”, “Don’t be in a hurry!” “There's plenty of room!” and
on fº. the interior, he endeavoured to keep up the allegory of the
rush by calling out to his friend, LoRD Tom Noppy, “Hollo, ToM!
There's room here!” and by other little acts, that imparted to the
RUBENs Room the air of a regular theatre. - -
Mr. Punch had contemplated various other proceedings of a similar
nature, under the impression that HER MAJESTY wished to fancy
herself in an actual play-house; but upon the intimation being con-
veyed to him that such was not the Royal desire, and that if he per-
sisted in carrying out his intentions, he would be carried out himself, he
evinced his usual loyalty by desisting from the course he had resolved
upon. Had he been permitted to complete his project, he was prepared
with a cry of “Throw him over!” and “Turn him out !” just to give
praisemblance to the whole affair; but as “Turn him out !” and
“Throw him over!” might have been understood in a political sense,
it is perhaps as well that Punch was prevented from uttering these
fearfully portentous, words, in the presence of the QUEEN and her
Ministers. It is understood, however, that at the next representation
some female voices will be employed to ejaculate "Pine-apples, oranges
tea, coffee, or a bill of the play,” as a sort of substitute for the old
familiar shout inviting the public to some of the above luxuries, with
the addition of “Nuts and pears, ginger-beer, porter,”—a cry which, in
any, theatre, and especially in one that may be fairly called a Royal
Victoria Theatre, will have a sound at once characteristic and natural.
How very Absurd.
So high and unreasonable are the expectations raised on the subject
of California, that several laundresses in the suburbs have already
advertised to take in Gold Washing, and we shall soon see the words
“Wanted, a Family's Gold Washing,” as a heading to, newspaper
advertisements. Several persons hearing that the gold in California is
found in quartz, expect to find a number of ready-made tankards, to
satisfy their thirst for gold, immediately on their arrival. Others, who
have heard that the precious metal exists in carats, are taking out a
quantity of carrot-seed in their personal luggage, in order to be pre-
red with what they term their “plant” for working their enterprise.
ut we strongly suspect that the frequent result of a Latin vocative-
namely, Caret-will be the result of the calculations of these enthusiasts.
A JOKE FOR YOUR MONEY.
We see a book advertised under the title of What is Money?...What
is money indeed! Why, in our opinion, money is extremely difficult
to get, and when got, still more difficult to keep.

MISS BENIMBLE'S TEA-AND-TOAST.
M R. PUNCH,--THIs I will say. With the tea

mellering afore the fire, like so much buttered
happiness—the cat upon the rug—and the news-
paper on my lap, to take it up, and, when I like,
to lay it down again—why, Mr. Punch, I don't

don’t know that I’d change my chair with the

lions in it, is flying above the door-lives

Talking of lions, I see at last they’ve pitched
upon the live unicorn. Poor thing! ell, I
knew it would right itself at some time. A great
comfort and a sweet moral to them as may be
backbitten all their days, to come out like the
over-drifted snow at the end.
But it seems what we freeborn Britons call
aumicorn, the misbenighted savages in Kordofan
— says BARON, Wox, MULLER– call A'nasa;
which, no doubt on it, is Arabby for a Neddy.
For, says the Baron—and I write it from my paper—for “It is the
size of a donkey, has a thick body and thin bones, coarse hair, and tail
like a boar. It has a long horn on its forehead, and lets it hang
when, alone, but erects , it immeditly on seeing an enemy.”.
should like to know what this is but our own precious unicorn in a

º: but isn’t it natºral that a donkey
would grow any size that’s been so long taken care of in the
Royal Arms. t has coarse hair, says the Baron. , Hair coarse or
fine’s all a matter of feed, and the British unicorn has had no º
of beans. Wery true, our unicorn always has his horn erect, because
to be in state—whereas the wild unicorn, as
the Baron says, has his horn out of curl when alone, and gets it up
in full fig only when he sees company. Howsomever, I spose they'll
not be long afore they send an A'nasa to the Theological Society, when
an enlightened public will be able to judge atwixt the wild and the
donkey, says the Baron. ..., Very
the rough.
But, Mr. Punch, the unicorn has carried me off of my subject. What
I was f. to say, was this. I’ve long thought it; but I got up this
blessed morning with the motion rivetted in me that I was born to do
something... I know I come into this world with an admission! . But,
Sir, to. º with last night. If I didn't dream I was turned into a
porkipine, I am one this very minute. A porkipine, with every quill
dipped in ink. And then, I thought I did no more than walk over a
white sheet of #ji. big as any table-cloth, and if it warn’t all
printed with widely-circ'lated columns—munders and accidents and all
—my name is not MATILDA: And though I was a porkipine, I thought
I was still myself, and had the perfect, use of my quills, and while
...; was sensible to the last drop of ink. And this brings me to
my letter.
I do think, Mr. Punch, that my habits and feelings—to say nothing
o' my dream-pint me out to myself as a public writer. Yes; that’s
the admission I was born with. But, Sir, to give you my story with
not a bit of warnish.
I am the only daughter of parints that was once repitable, but are
now, unfortunately, no more." Blessed by Providence with a compe-
tent muffin-walk which, as you may know, lasts only four months in the
year, they were always enabled to take themselves and me abroad six
months at least, to beguile ourselves with the artful foreigner...The
Courts we peeped into–but this by-and-by. Still, I may say, if the
younger branches of the EMPEROR NICHOLAs was the first of the
mperial Rushes to know what was crumpets, they owe that blessing of
civilisation—as my dear father would call it—to a freeborn Briton.
You are not the man, Mr. Punch, to ask a lady's age. I am not
the woman, to name it. Still, this I will say. I am old enough to
remember the feelings that fought in my bosom on the trial of QUEEN
CAROLINE., How I wished I was a man, to take a spear and shield, and
go afore Buckingham Palace (over the way) and fling a glove down
under the marble arch. But I was young them. You can't think how
young.
-- I might have married many times, and therefore never have.
“MATILDA’s mind was too strong to bend about a wedding ring.” This
is what my father said, and he was a man that never told an untruth.
Never. Though you’d put him behind his own counter, he couldn't doit.
Well, Mr. Punch, being, in the course of things, left an orphan, with
a small Chancery property, and being of a roving mind, and not having
secrets, from
| what things I’ve brought to light !
a temper that could take up with one room, I give up myself to house-
keeping—that is, to minding other people's houses. At this very
minute I’m in Pimlico. Fourteen rooms, rent £150; water, hard and
soft; taxes next to nothing; never seen a flea since I’ve been here; and
chimneys that don’t know what smoke is.
And in this way, for this past ten years, I’ve been moved about
town-like a Queen on a chess-board—though not always in a square.
The quantity of life I’ve seen in this way is wonderful. The shades of
human feelings, like colours in a ribbin-box, that unroll 'emselves
afore me, are not to be reckoned. In this way I’ve been brought into
a persition with the first people as ever walked; and so a little down the
ladder—though I make it a pint of principle never to have a house on
my hands under £70 per ann., taxes not included.
It isn't for me, Mr., Punch, to boast of what I know. I should
despise myself if Í could be brought somuch as to elude to the perlitical
QUEEN ANNE's time upwards and downwards, as are
in my box. ... But this I may say; that the days of spring panels is
not past. It is not likely that I should have had the run of so man
mansions all, to myself, without rummaging all, the closets, an
sounding all the wainskits. And the upshot of this is, writings and
parchments enuff to make your knees knock together, You don't know
- - You don’t know what may be
hidden in a crust of blue mildoo! I’ve come at writings that’ll turn
the History of England inside out, and make, all the Kings in West:
minster Abbey rattle in their coughings. And these, Mr. Punch, are at
your service.
But, Sir, don't think I have nothing to perpose but mouldy writings
and dead skins of our ansistors. - - - -
us: the life as fresh and as bright as the sprats this minute crying
under me. Mr. Punch, I live on a newspaper. As the bee goes from
rose to lillie—and from lillie to mariegolde—and so on to º and
Londonpride—packing up about her all the honey as she finds; so,
Mr. Punch, do I go about my paper.
When I sets myself down to my tea and toast—(strange fikleness
of human natur !—but I never could like muffins!)—and throws myself
upon the world in print, you’ve no notion how I do expand! You can't
guess the many feelings that fight within me, like a crowd on a boxin
night! Feelings of all sorts, but º like the hop in BAss's ale,
bitterness is uppermost. And for this, the kindest of reasons—to see
what a mess (excuse strong writing)—a mess the men, the lords of the
creation, make of the world they’ve taken all to theirselves, leaving
such a little of it to the women to make up into anything.
It is quite time that these feelings should be poured out in ink.
And so, Mr. Punch—thinking that I’ve seen in a good many of your
works a heart that could feel for a sister—I º in whatever
mansion I may have to keep—(tho’ between ourselves, I like Pimlico
and the nearness to the Pallis so well that Ishan’t let this house in a
hurry—not if I know it)—in whatever mansion, to write to you upon
the world that’s turning round us, that I may, though late, do credit
to the admission I was born with.
Mr. Punch, there is at this minute something serous-awful—in
this house and its round about. It is five in the afternoon. There is
a fog in the street that might be cut like Wenham ice, and packed off
to our unnat'ral enemies. There is a jamming of vehikes and all the
roar of life, and cussing of cabs, with a silver cry of sprats—like the
voice of ope above a tempest—in the street below. And here above
am I, in a drawin-room of somethin like ninety by a hundred: with
appear glass that would take in GoLIAR, over the chimney—and on the
sealing, garlands of roses and apples and pumgrannies in plaster. Here
I sits, like the Empress of RoHINson CRusoe, with the Emperor out.
And in my lap is the “great globe itself” made flat into a newspaper.
What thoughts it opens up! Now I’m in Pimlico, and—now in
Californyl Gold . Nothing but gold! One minute the room I
sit in is a shadow—and now if it isn't luminated, lighted up with the
precious mettle like the furniss of ABEDNEGO!
But, Mr. Punch, with your kind permission—and with your gen'ral
allowance—I’ll give you, next week, my notions of Californy, as it
appears (with other things) in the newspaper. Meanwhile,
Yours to cumand,
MATILDA BENIMBLE.

ANDED at St. Francisco, after a 'tarnal tossin of
five months. This is coming thro’ the small eend
of the Horn, Ireckon, and there ought to be pretty
considerable some on the other side to make up
for leavin' my dry goods store and family fixins in
Bºy.
Traded with a Down-Easter, who is makin'
tracks for the settlements, with 30,000 dollars in
his carpet-bag, for a . pick, scoop, and washin'
trough—givin' 800 dollars for the plunder, and
| glad to get it, as INCREASE. NILEs FLINT, of
Salem, Mass., went 750, and he is a "tarnal old hoss
at a deal.
Swopped my traps and blankets, a quarter cask
of pickled pork, and a demi-john of ſpeach brandy, whichi ad laid in,
for six pounds gimooine gold. Pretty considerable smart tradin.
Toted my tools to HIRAM. K. Dough Boy's boardingshanty, and settled
with him for blankets and board, at 30 dollars per diem. Catawampus
prices here, that’s a fact; but everybody’s got more dust than he knows
what to do with.
Off to the diggins with a party; mighty small potatoes most of 'em:
all sorts and colours, and everlastin ragged—Bay-statesmen, Back:
woodsmen, Buckeyes from Qhio, Hosses from Kentuck, Capel Cod
Whalers, St. Francisco Indians, Leperos from Santa Cruz, Texan
Wolunteers, Philadelphia Quakers, a Latter-day Saint, six Irish
Sympathisers, twelve Yankees, as many Britishers, a squad of Deserters,
a Blackfoot Guide, a Methodist Parson, and a Mormon Elder. A 'tarnal
nigger tried to join us, but got cow-hided.
Struck, diggins, and sot to serious washin'; parson began to, ask
a blessin', but seein’ SILAs T. Forks, of Orangeburgh, N. Ca., helpin'
himself. parson cut it short off, and we went to work, like niggers at
game hoin', agreein’ to dig in company, and share profits. Cotched the
Quaker sunnin’ himself, and takin’ kink out of his back with a Havan:
nah: Convened a meetin', cow-hided. Quaker, and at it again. Gold
lyin' about like earth-nuts, and riddlin' through the water like hail-
storm in a sherry-cobbler.
Sounded the conch for grub, and found nobody got *. , but that
'cute old coon, ZERUBBABEL W. PEABODY, of §: º: who had
brought a bag of biscuit, and some meat fixins. The warmint wouldn't
sell a notion under an ounce of dust, and sacked the whole bilin.
To work again; totted up at sun-down, and found we'd averaged
28 dollars per man. Got back to shanty; but before that darned
HIRAM. K. Dough Boy would let me inside the door, forced to pay down
30 dollars for day's board and lodgin'. So wound up 2 dollars worse
than in the mornin'. Calcilated to camp out in future, cut HIRAM,
and work on my own hook, havin' realised that Socialism ain't no go
in gold diggin'. Asked HIRAM why he didn't go out with his bowie-
knife and washing-pail. HIRAM sniggered, and said he warn’t greedy,
and preferred helpin’ folks in his shanty. HIRAM usen’t to be such a
concarned fool.

WHIST.
PUNCH's recent question—“Will Louis-NAPOLEoN lead up to the
King, or play the deuce?” has created a sensation over all the world;
and rather than keep the whole world waiting for an answer, Punch
will give one himself.
LOUIS-NAPOLEoN will not lead up to the King, but if he should get
out all the knaves, with the assistance of a few trumps, he may perhaps
make the honour he now has in his hands. If, on the contrary, he
tries to win by tricks, the elder hands will probably get the game by
the honours falling to their share in another deal .# the cards. His
best suit to rely upon at present, is Hearts; while his opponents are
rather strong in Qlubs. But much will depend on the next game that
is played; “for, there's the rub.”
thas been since suggested to us by an ingenious Liverpool friend,
that PRINCE LOUIS-NAPOLEON may not only adopt both the courses
suggested in our original query, but that also, before the game is up,
he will have to “Cut for Deal”—in a fishing-boat.
Giving 1848 a Character.
..WHEN we look back at that profligate year 1848, we see nothing but
flights running through it. The flight of Louis-Philippe, the double
flight,of FERDINAND, and the flight of his iron master, METTERNICH;
the flight ºf the poor Pope, and the flights of ministers, ouriers,
citizens, and labour-organizers innumerable. Nothing but a rapid suc-
cession, of flights. Most decidedly Posterity, when she puts on her
spectacles to relate the History of our present age, will write down
the Anno Domini, 1848, as the flightiest year on record.
THE SHELL JACKET.
TH: forebodings that were entertained as to the failure of the Shell
Jacket in the * have, during the late cold weather, been bitterly
justified. Many of the wearers, complain that these jackets are pro-

THE GREATEST SPELL OF LIFE.-Reading the Fonetik Wve.
A NEW FEATURE IN “PUNCH.”
WE can fancy the ſº of the whole world—to whom the features
of Punch are so well known, and by whom they are considered so
perfect—at this announcement. Punch intends to report the Parlia-
mentary Debates of the forthcoming session, without any enlargement
of paper, and without any extra expense to his multitudinous readers.
Punch has always had his baton, and he has now his staff—of Parliamen-
tary reporters. He has too often lent his ideas to his contemporaries—
he will now, for the first and last time, borrow an ideaſrom one of them.
It will be recollected that, a morning, contemporary, the Daily News,
during last autumn, published the daily state of the weather in the
principal towns in the kingdom. That is the model on which Punch
will report the Debates, and remodel the art of Parliamentary reporting.
The only difference between Punch's reports and his contemporaries'
will be, that his will be read, and theirs will not. Here is a specimen:-

CATTLE AND CORPORATION.
GREENHILL's RENTs are near to Smithfield. Lºdgings are let there. With all tenderness for the
Corporation of London, so determined to turn the muck and blood of Smithfield into money, we
should like to accommodate a few, Aldermen and Common Councilmen in some of the kitchens,
parlours, and first-floors on hire. The lodgings-on the faith of an unsophisticated inhabitant—have
these bestial advantages:-
“On the Level with our Kitchens is where they keep a Quantity of Bullocks. And level with the Parlours they keep a
Quantity of Pigs & Calves. And level with our First floºr they keep a Quantity of Sheep. And the Distance of these
Sheds to the Back of Some of Our Houses they are within Sir Inches of each other–And Underneath all of these
sheds there is a large Cavity, of which they slaughter a Quantity of Pigs, Both on Sundays as well. As other Days.”
We should like to take a sufficient number of Corporation worthies, and—according to their intel-
ligence—quarter them; the more stolid with the bullocks; the more stupid with the pigs and
ves; and the more simple with the sheep.
“And what with the Foundation of Our Houses being Decayed By the Rats burrowing between, And the Dreadful
Stench that arises from Those Sheds and Slaughterhouses, Together from the Noise from the Cattle, We cannot
keep our Apartments let long Together. For Our Lodgers Complain and tell us that they cannot sleep for the noise

THE CHATELAINE OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE.
A TALE OF Fashion.
“SIR-If you consider ghost stories appropriate to this season of the year, all I can say is, that
here is a tale of a Haunted House, which is heartily at your service.
“I am, Sir, an octogenarian and a bachelor: and, Sir, probably the latter circumstance may
account for the former. I was lately confined to my bed-room by an attack of the gout, at the
cºmmencement of which, my niece, with a number of grown-up daughters, came to stay at º house.
Well, Sir, no sooner had my visiters arrived, than my house º to be disquieted day and night,
by the most unaccountable noises. They exactly resembled the jingling of chains, and appeared to
run from the bottom to the top of the house, and vice versa, and to pass in and out of the various
rºoms, sometimes over head, and sometimes under. f course, Sir, you are aware that sounds
of this nature are popularly associated with the idea of ghosts and goblins; and at last I began
to say "Eh, what?. Upon my word, Ireally do believe that this house is haunted.”
“I assure you, Sir, that they were a most serious annoyance to me; they distracted my attention
whilst reading the paper, disturbed me at my meals, and, I believe, interfered with my digestion.
But, Sir, when I recovered, and left my room, the whole mystery was explained, and what I sayis,
you will always find it so in similar cases. I then discovered, Sir, that my ghosts were no other
than my guests., The clinking and clanking by which I had been exasperated, proceeded from a sort
of band ºf steel chains, which my niece and pach of the girls had dangling at their waistbands, with
a miscellaneous parcel of keys, cutlery, and other hardware at the end of them. I asked what
the deuce these things were, and was told they were called chatelaines. Chatelaines? Now, Sir,
I do say that these chatelaines are utterly destructive to domestic quiet, and by no means elegant
appendages to costume. They may enable young ladies to dance the Polka in fetters; but such
ſetters will never serve the purpose of binding the hearts of admirers. The next new fashion, Isup:
pose, will be handcuffs instead of bracelets. I do not like to see, and still less to hear, a lady with a
chain, at her waist, swinging about an assortment of marine stores. The appearance is unsightly,

MASQUERADING MENDICANTS.
We are glad to find there is some
chance of the begging profession being
thoroughly done up at last, by the light of
exposure being brought to bear upon it.
The professors of the art of street men-
dicancy can scarcely be called actors,
though perhaps ex-actors is not an inap-
propriate name for them. The most
surprising part of their performance is
that of their “infant prodigies,” whose
assumptions and personations are truly
wonderful. -
... We, have seen a marvellous display of
juvenile talent in a boy, who, in the course
of a single week, has been an orphan
with six little brothers, and sisters, a
pleader for a dying mother and a bed-
ridden father, as well as a poor sailor-boy
just cast ashore in the middle of the
Strand; thus entitling himself to rank
with those actors whose chief merit is
their versatility. -
We must give credit to the professional
mendicants for the attention they devote
to costume, which has evidently become
a study with most of them. There are
public wardrobes, to which the acting, or
exacting, beggars resort for the purpose
of “making up,” and the effect is often
worthy of the skill and taste of the most
accomplished theatrical costumier. The
reduced-clergyman dodge is a highly suc-
cessful branch of the begging profession,
and a seedy clerical suit is understood to
pay much better than an average country
curacy.
An investment in the reduced gent's
togs-as the slang phrase has it among
the fraternity—is far more profitable than
a small investmentin the Reduced Threes;
and there is a speculator in this branch,
with whom many of our readers may be
familiar, who wears a white choker, holds
a few sticks of sealing-wax in his hand,
affects shame at his situation, keeps a
corner of his eye on the look-out for the
police, and clears his ten shillings or a
pound a-day, from the softness of the
heads and hearts of the passengers.
The durability of griefamong this classis
something quite remarkable, for we have
seen the same man with a piece of crape
round his hat for the same wife for six or
seven successive years; and the female
professors are quite as tenacious of the
weeds of their widowhood. “Once a
widow or widower, always a widow or
widower,” appears to be the motto with
these bereaved individuals.
Chicken Hazard.
THE Million are to be disappointed of
their promised poultry. The celebrated

is wanted to keep up the steam. Some
16,000 juvenile cocks and hens are panting
in solitary confinement to throw off the
yolk. If not soon taken out, they must
die the death of the bad and musty. Their
case is almost hopeless; go apparently
they must; but in the meantime every
respect has been paid to their remains.
As the last experiment, a hatchment has
been placed over the door.

in the world—should know so little on 'em 2
Why, if a Frenchman knew hisself, he
ought to look upon a monkey for all the
world like a poor relation, denied the use
of his articles of speech. And yet, Mr.
Punch, what do I read in my paper? Why
this:—“The Chimpanzee, which had been for the last five months at
the Museum of Natural History, has just earpired, not being able to
resist the effects of the cold.” Yes: in course; but what sort of cold P
What says MR. SHAKESPEARE–who's been invited to my Gracious
Nºvº. to Windsor, to make him fit for decent people—what
Says ne:
“Blow, blow, thou nor’-east wind,
Thou'rt by luo means so unkind
As nuan's ingratitude.”
Not the cold of France, but the cold of Frenchmen, has killed that
senseativ plant of a monkey. Of course, the poor cretur expected to
be made a President of, and never thought they'd go and put over
his head that Lewis-NApolleyon. It’s enough to break the heart of an
oister, thro' shell and all. For consider, Mr. Punch, as the British
Lion with us, so with the French is the Paris Monkey a mashunal
animal. The Shimpanzee had a right to the foetool, which you know is
French politics for the President’s chair. For 'spose LEwis can ride a
horse—why, Shimpanzee could stride a camel! And while Lewis can
make speeches, and what’s more, write letters—Shimpanzee couldn’t,
for his life, say a sillabul, or make a single pothook up'ards or down-
'ards., And, then, think on Shimpanzee's dignitie. . Why, a monkey,
with his Act of Parlimint eyes, will look as wise, as six judges,
wigs or not. Shimpanzee must have been a great improvement on
Lewis as, what I read, the embodded expressyun of the French
Public. And the poor monkey felt this, no doubt; and so died of the
ballad-box.
It only wants a little fancy to look, and the newspaper—there’s so
much about Californy—shines all over like a new gilt weathercock.
Well, it’s wonderful; but, upon my life—after gas, and steam, and
'lectric wire—this discovery of a land all gold, comes in like a fairy
pallis at the end of a pantomime. In 1848, to think that so many royal
crowns should ha’ gone to the melting-pot—and that at the very time
that gold enough turns up to make a crown for every day in the
week for the heads of King Mob, with three crowns, like the Pope's,
for Sundays' Isn’t here a Revolution of mettles, when a 'Merican
chimbley-sweeper may have upon him as much treble gilt as the KING
of NAPLEs, or any other King of the House of Bonbon?
Howsumever, it's a good thing for the 'Mericans, as I’m ready to
show 'em. The gold was sent a purpose to settle the Black Question;
and in this way. The 'Mericans have only to send half of their slave-
niggers to Californy to pick up gold enough to buy their own freedom
and pay for the liberty of the other half that’s left behind. This I may
call settling two slaves with one charge of gold dust. It's a sweet
thought that when the 'Mericans hadn't heart enough theirselves to
give liberty to the blacks, that Providence should kindly step in with
gold galore to buy it for 'em!
. But, Mr. Punch, Californy is making a revolution in London. I, who
live in Pimlico, may be supposed to know something of tip-top life in
Bellgravy. There’s tears, and wailing, and istericks to no end in the
higher succles. ...Younger sons sellin out o' the Army—younger ones
again turning their backs on the Church, and thinking no more of
DR. Pussy and MR. NEWMAN than if they were bedels—and all resolved
to go to Californy. Only this very day, the milkman told me he saw the
youngersion of a markwis cheapening a spade, and flourishing a pickax,
at a hardware shop—as if he’d been born to the disgusting implements.
And the frenzie has—it may be supposed—fired the female heart.
Timid young ladies, without money enough—dots they’re called in
high life—to buy husbands at home, have, as I heer, chartered a
skewner, to get fortunes for theirselves in Californy. What’s to
become of us?. I know a little of perlitical economy—I haven't so
often paid the taxgatherer for father not to know something of the
sighence—and it isn't likely that milliners, and shirtmakers, and all
the º: of needles (as I call’em) will stop here, starving on shillins a
week, when–with no more than their bare bodkins—they may every day
Vol. xv.I.
pick up mettle that’s so many guineas in a virgin state. I know what
it will come to: Dutchesses will have to go to Court in gowns o' their
own make : and—it's dreadful to think on-praps a Prime Minister be
obliged to stand up in Parliment in a shirt of his wife's sowin! Wessels
i. to Californy ought immedtly to be stopt; and this is only to be
one by laying upon every port a strong lumbago.
To be sure, there is another way. Some o' the Bishops might be
asked to preach against the folly, and the wickedness, and the horror,
and the crime, and the stupiditie, and the burnin shame, and the lust
and darkness, and strait-jacket ravin madness of gold ! What sweet
discorses might be made upon the yellar trashel !! I see by the paper,
they’ve been doin’ it in Ameriky. One clergyman preached upon the
text—“How much better is it to get wisdom than gold ", And all the
congregation emptied their pockets to buy a testimonal—a silver-gilt
tea-service—for the preacher, whose return of thanks will no doubt
come by the next packet. And in this way, all our Bishops might
discorse against this gold rot—I must call it so—as threatens to eat up
the fiburs of the people's heart. Think, Mr. Punch, if the BIshop of
LoNDoN, for one, was to walk up from Fulham, to, St. James's Church,
and having taken off his modest gaturs and his 'Merican overshoes in
the vestry, and gone up in the pulpit, and was then and there to put
down the sinful mettle for ever! Wouldn't it be a sight to see the
Bishop killing the golden dragon that threatened to eat the hearts and
souls out of us?. And suppose the Bishop of Exete R in another pulpit
—West End, of courseſ–And there, laying out a handful o' sovrings
on the pulpit cushion afore him—’spose he showed, to the sinners in
poohs, that the golden sovrings was ashes, and dirt, and blood, and
wickedness, and—all shiny as they were—was not a bit better than sin
and death P. Why, at one and the same time he'd turn people's souls
inside out with their pockets! What a sight would this be, when on
the same Sunday all the Bishops, and Deans, and Prebans, and Recturs
and Wickers, one and all got into the pulpit, and took up their Bibles
to knock down gold
No doubt on it, folks would very much rejoice; there'd be lumina.
tions, and fireworks, and bullocks roasted, and the winders of two or
three stockbrokers smashed to celebrate the moral triumf... Meanwhile,
how the papers do burn and twinkel with news of Californyl And
meanwhile–for, born with an admission to write the truth, I shall
never be above it, as if truth was not good enough for me—meanwhile
I do feel my heart drawn toward Helldorado | I allow that gold is
wickedness; but human natur was born with a low love of the yellar
sin. Gold, I own it, is dirt; but then, don't the best of us love to be
dirty?, We keep, like taturs, all the better for it. ...Gold is the root of
evil; but lor! how sweet is the pippins, the fruit that grows upon the
tree with that golden root to it! Gold is, I know, like a thief that
walks, by night: and yet, timid, woman as I am, I could never be
brought to bolt my door aginst it. “MR. BAGSTER,” says I, this very
afternoon—BAGSTER is the milkman, and I’m afeard, a low Chartist;
for even the cat looks twice at his milk, there’s so much more water
than human kindness in it—“MR. BAGSTER,” says I-" I tell you what
it is: you’re one o’ those people that 'ud level everything; bring down
gold to pewter. It’s very well for you to abuse what you call money,
the vice of the age; but that’s acause you can't be vishus. The fact
is, we do with gold as we're too apt to do with our acquaintance—abuse
and pick it to pieces, only when it’s away from us.” . That was a
bit of truth; and in course it was rewarded as sich; for BAGSTER—as
I and the cat afterwards found—give me short measure for it.
Mr. Punch, as my candle is coming to an end, so for the present
must my writin. Else I’d a good deal to say ; but it’ll keep. M.R.
CoBDEN is, I see, come out agin. I expected it. If he was thrashed
lately, why—like the corn he’s talked of so much—it was only that
he might sprout and grow for the thrashing. He’s a going, I hear, to
cut Government down to the quick. Going—as that wretch BAGSTER
said, with a demonick laugh—“to cut from the State it’s expensive

as the very tail o' the British Lion: it is in the &c. that is the strength,
and the grace, and the glory—as I once heard at a play-of the land.
Why, in that little &c. is curled "g thousands and thousands, and thou-
sands of pounds! In that very &c.—as in the British oak—I don’t
know how many birds of fine feather find roost and shelter...And after
all, what—as 1said to BAGSTER—what is our limited monarkie? Why,

leveller—“only the ampersan (meaning the &c.) has, at present, a little
too expensive a flourish; we just want to take an inch or two of its
golden tail off.” Low fellar !
And MR. BRIGHT is, of course, in this. To be sure. For, as I said

A MAN OF ACTION.
If there were any doubt as to whether Louis-Napoleon is or is not
a man of action, such doubts would be removed by his recent appoint-
ment of one who is the acknowledged master of action—or at least of
the ballet d'action—to an office undergovernment. A late proclamation
about the new year's day levee is signed CHANGARNIER, and counter-
signed PERRot, from which we find that the popular little dancer is
regularly installed in office under the new President. We see no ob-
jection to this arrangement, for we are sure PERRot will go through
the ceremonial business at a levee, whatever the duties may be, with
quite as much grace and dignity as any aristocratic Stick in Waiting,
whether Gold or Silver, could possibly have exhibited. Perhaps, how-
ever, there is a deep political motive under this appointment, and
Louis-Napoleon may calculate on the power of PERRot to fascinate
the public in the President’s favour by some new pas de fascination, or
to lead the enemies of the Government a very pretty dance in a tru-
andaise of the most intricate character.
Whatever the intention of the President may be, we are inclined to
look on the appointment as a happy one. There is, º a stern and
simple republican feeling at the bottom of the apparently bizarre idea
of selecting a dancer to superintend those unmeaning ceremonies which
make up the proceedings at the levees and receptions of sovereigns. It
is also not unlikely that the extraordinary powers of PERRot inspinning,
which have . him to be likened to a human teetotum, may have
recommended him to the favour of one who has been indebted for his
present position to certain wonderful and rapid revolutions of the
world in general, and the wheel of fortune in particular.
INSTANTANEOUS DIPLOMACY.
THE prospect of the establishment of a Submarine Electric Telegraph
between. Folkestone and Boulogne, and thus of an instantaneous com:
munication between London and Paris, suggests many weighty and
some light reflections. The possibility of an immediate interchange of
messages between the Governments of France and England, will save
our Ambassador at Paris one half of his trouble, and the nation, of
course, just so much of his salary. A great economy also will, doubt-
less, be effected in the language of diplomacy, which will become
idiomatic, pithy, and pertinent. As for instance: “Can't you reduce
that tariff º' “Not in the present state of the Exchequer.” “Take
the duty off our claret.” “Don’t you wish you may get it?” “We
think about interfering in Germany.” “You’d better not.” “What
do you say to cutting down our armaments?” “We will if you will.”
“Well, if you will we will.” “Come, then, you begin.” “No, you.”
“After you is manners.” - "Captain HAwsER complains that you
have insulted our flag”, “No such thing.” “Par or bellum '"
“Paz.”, “Stop thief!”. “Who?” "Five feet ten inches, light
hair, and squints.”. “Oblige our Bank with a loan.” “How much?'
“Only a million.” “We’re too, hard up.” “London quiet f"
“Tolerably. How’s Paris?” “All right.”
The only objection to a Submarine Telegraph between the two
countries, that we can see, is, that any shock originating in France is
felt quite soon enough in England already.
LITTLE STORIES FOR LITTLE POLITICiAns.
In Words of One Syllable.
TheRE was a Small Boy whose name was John Bull, and
he felt much Pain from a Rod; not that he was a Bad Boy
who ought to have the Rod, but that those who did rule him
did love to lay it on to him so hard, that he could not bear it.
Now one day John did find the Rod, and when he saw it, he
was much struck by some Twigs, which he did twig as those
which had much struck him, and struck him too much, as he
thought, and he had good Cause to think so. So when he saw
the Twigs which did bear on him too hard, he did makeup
his Mind to pull at them till he should pull them quite out,
and make an end of them. So a Friend did chance to call on
him, whose name was Dick Cob, who said if John would lend
his own Hand to pull out the Twig that stung the most, he,
Dick Cob, would lend his Hand too, and he had no doubt that
they would both gain their End if they both gave a long Pull,
a strong Pull, and a Pull at the right Time. So John Bull
and Dick Cob did give the long Pull, and the strong Pull, and
the Twig came out quite well; so that the Rod did not hurt
poor John BULL half so much as it once had done, and his Back
could now bear all that for his good it was right to put on it.

ſº; º
In these days, there is unfortunately so, much real distress, that
Punch cannot tolerate the mockery of it, which is so likely to disgust
the charitable who find themselves deceived, and dry up the fountains
of benevolence, which never were needed to flow with greater freedom
than at the present moment. *
While Punch puts the public on its guard against imposture, he
would put the police on the alert to ascertain all cases of real distress
—to divide the genuine from the false, by taking cognisance of every
one—and thus prevent actual want, from being denied relief, by
being confounded with falsehood and hypocrisy. It is against the
actors of misery, and not the sufferers, that we are wielding our bâton,
and endeavouring to put kind-hearted people on their guard, by exposing
the infamous tricks that are º: to impose on their benevolence.
The number of actors has fearfully increased, until, almost every
mendicant we meet appears, theatrically speaking, “in character.”
In consequence of the great depression in the dramatic and vocal
arts, they can scarcely be exercised with profit anywhere but in the
public thoroughfares. We understand that MR. RICHARD Jones,
MR. CoopeK, and other retired actors who have been in the habit of
advertising To prepare gentlemen for the Church, the Senate, and
the Bar,” will shortly commence receiving pupils for the purpose of
perfecting them in mendicant oratory, including “Shame to appear in
MEMBERS OF THE BEGGING PROFESSION.
present degraded situation,” appeals to the feelings, on the ground of
abstinence from food, for eight-and-forty hours, with occasional
statistics referring to the decline of manufactures, and the stagnation
in particular branches of industry.
The vocal branch of the Begging Profession has lately been much
cultivated; and the connexion between the “most, musical,” and the
“most melancholy,” is now, so readily admitted, that singing-classes
are regularly formed with the view of qualifying, the professors of
Mendicancy to operate on the hearts of the public by operatic effects.
The study of the shake is strongly recommended for “family use,”
that is to say, where the family of the mendicant is large, and, the
shake may give a sort of shivering effect to the melody. . The allegro
is quite out of favour with the vocalists of the mendicant profession;
but a sostenuto of the most comprehensive kind, enabling the singer
to carry one note through a whole street, at a very high pitch, and turn
the corner with a legato passage which prepares him to sport his soºtenuto
again down a second street, is found to be a very profitable class of
vocalism, as it attracts hearers § startling them in the first instance;
and if the “make up” is tolerably good, if the rags, are picturesquely
adjusted, the arms bare, and the chest quite naked, the vocalist may be
tolerably sure of a running accompaniment of coppºr—a sort of largo
ending in largesse to an amount that will be very satisfactory.
LEGAL RUMOURS.
THE disinclination of the LORD CHANCELLQR to give silk gowns, has
created much dissatisfaction at the Bar, and the complaints, both at
Common Law, and, Equity, of the back rows being over-stuffed, are
becoming loud, and general. It is rumoured that MR. BRIEFLEss,
wishing to make room for some of his contemporaries, has almost
determined on taking the coif, but sees a difficulty about the thousand
pounds he will have to pay for the dignity. It is whispered that he
intends making the bold experiment of offering to settle the matter by
instalments—a mode of arrangement that will throw open the dignity
of a Serjeantship to a class of talent, at present debarred by the
smallness of their means, from obtaining the honours of forensic
coiffure. , MR; BRIEFLEss, it is said, will propose to take up the coif b
bills at long dates, or to enter into a cognovit for the entire sum, wit
an insurance on his life by way of collateral security. ... Should he be
admitted into the learned brotherhood, he will follow the usual
practice of giving rings with a motto, and he has selected the charac-
teristic letters I.O.U., which will combine cheapness of engraving
with significance of meaning.
A MISFIT.
LAst week a bootmaker, of considerable standing, called upon
MR. Cobden to measure him for LoRD JoHN Russeli's shoes. The
Hon. Member declined, on the ground that he had all through his life
set his foot against Whig, measures, and it was not likely he would
step into them now...The bootmaker seeing E.; that MR. Coppºn s
sole and understanding were several sizes larger than LORD JoHN's,
left without trying it on any further.

Of Cambridge, Connecticut.
IN St. Francisco located was NATHAN JEHOI-

S. P. Down by the wharf on the harbour he traded

- Darned hard knot at a deal, at Meetin' a
powerful elder.
There at his store, in the shade, they met,
onbraced and enlightened .
Traders and trappers and captings, and
lawyers and editors also. - -
Freely they liquored and chewed, indulgin'
in expectoration, -
Rockin’ with heels over heads, and whit-

Like dough-nut at a frolic, or yellow-pine stump in a clearin',
Sharp as a backwoodsman's axe, and 'cute as a bachelor beaver,
Glimmer'd, º clouds of Virginny, the cypherin' mug of NATHANIEL.
Sweeter nor candy of . a'most too genteel to be raal,
Straight as a hickory sapling, and clean as a Nar'ganset pacer,
Tall she moved through the bar, a-sarvin' of ſº and cock-tails

Not that . needed to did it, but 'cause nigger helps there's no

And she was too tender-hearted to get the black warmint cow-hided.

On NAT.’s roof of split shingle, illustrious Gover Nor TARBox
Hoisted the Stars and the Stripes, representative there of the Mighty,
The Free, and the Fearless of 'airth, the Go-a-head 'Merican people;
Boarded there the great TARBox, and took his horn like a mere man,
Paying four dollars per diem for grub, grog, shake-down, and washin'.
Then came down, like iled lightning, on St. Francisco a rumour—
Fame her brazen trump turned best mint metal to puff it—
How that the root of all evil was found growin’ wild up the country,
How gold stuck to folk's fingers that washed in the St. Sacramento!
NAT, chawed two plugs extra to hear it; the editor swore he

But the magnanimous TARBox, he reckoned 'tmight be kinder likely,
Seein’ the States whipt the airth for men, and why not for metals?
Came . the diggins a straanger, with two carpet-bags full of goold-

NATHAN diskivered the fact, as he traded a pinch for a gin-sling;
And as that straanger loafed, thro' the bar, from parlor to bedroom,
Streams of the glorious sand oozed out thro’ a ..in his trowsers.

NATHAN remarked, “they would strike beaver-trail in them there

Then the captings went too, they said, to bring back their sailors;
And as it stands to natur', their customers followed the captings.
Next the Meetin's they thinned—that’s a fact—till, downto the elders,

Swopped his prime tin doin’s, or sold to the uttermost pipkin?
So he went—but before him the helps, black and Irish, had vanished.

AWFUL NEWS FOR THE CITY. |
THE Globe of Monday diffused through London the awful intelligence
that the Mayor of Wakefield, having declared himself a tee-totaller,
caused ginger-beer to be set before his guests at his inauguration
banquet. This ginger-beer has caused such an effervescence of feeling
in the City of London, that a deputation has already waited on the
LoRD MAYoR to ascertain his sentiments on the great, pop question,
and to pop the question to him whether he will ever think of saturating
his fellow citizens with this flatulent diluent. -
The Mayor of Wakefield has endeavoured to shelter himself under a
quºtation from SHAKEspeaRE, where the idea of “ginger" being “hot
i' the mouth,” is brought forward in connection with the subject of
festivity. It is true that ginger is hot in everybody's mouth who
takes an interest in civic hospitality; for the idea of falling down from
champagne to that cheap and nasty substitute, ginger-beer, has created
such a sensation of horror among the officials in every Corporation, that
the highly respectable Remembrancer of the City of London has been
heard to say he is afraid he may forget himself, should he allow his
feelings to dwell on this painful subject.
The Frying-Pan and the Fire.
WE understand that an alteration—severe, certainly, but wholesome
—is about to be made in the system of prison discipline. Union-
paupers, it is well known, often commit theft, or do damage, for the
purpose of procuring for themselves the better diet and accommodation
of a gaol. Henceforward it is intended to commit all convicts who
may violate the gaol regulations to—the workhouse. |

OUR COURTS OF LAW.
No. I.--THE PALACE COURT.
In the neighbourhood of Whitehall
and not far from the official
abode of the Sani Com-
missioners-who, if they
were employed in looking
after the moral as well as
the corporeal health of the
public, would doubtless
have their eye on the build-
ing—stands the structure
known—and far better
known than trusted—as the
Palace Court. It is exactly
opposite the head quarters
of the Metropolitan Police,
and affords a striking proof
of what may be carried on,
in some cases, under the
very nose of the authorities
jº. for the protection
of property. he police
- cannot, however, be blamed,
- - for the Palace Court exists
- - - - Pºiº The policeman's staff is therefore
owerless in his paralysed hands, and the flame of exposure flickers as
its ineffectual fires are paled within his bull's-eye, by the whole thing
being within the pale of a perverted authority.
Punch, however, has constituted himself a Commissioner, under the
Removal of Nuisances Act, which he intends to interpret as applying
to moral as well as physical nuisances, and he pledges himself that the
Palace Court shall be removed. We know that the Augean Stable was
a mere mare's-nest compared with this legal menagerie, which we have
undertaken to clean out as effectually as it has cleaned out those suitors
who have been drawn into it.
We will begin our task with a description of this temple of Themis;
and, though it beggars description, as it beggars everything else, wenay
be successful in giving the public some idea of it.
under the protection of
THE EXTERIOR OF THE PALACE COURT
Presents a very unpretending elevation, which prepares us for its low
position in public estimation; and though the style of architecture is,
on the whole, unmeaning, there is something rather typical in the
enormous sort of pigeon-house over the door, which seems to indicate
the process of plucking that is carried on within the building. There
are no windows in front, for the Court has a sort of natural repugnance
to the light of day, and carries on most of its proceedings by the dim
twilight of half a-pound of composites. The absence of windows pre-
vents also the doings inside from being overlooked by the neighbours—
a precaution that the Palace Court has the advantage of in common
with illicit stills and other premises devoted to nefarious practices.
The entrance to the Court is by a sort of side-door, which is quite
emblematical of the mode, by which the whole, concern has found
admission into our legal system. This brings us at once to the
INTERIOR OF THE PALACE COURT,
Which consists of a sort of hall, having a stove in the centre, which
throws out an enormous heat, and reminds the unfortunate suitor at
once, that he is likely to have warm work of it. . The first object at
which the visitor arrives is the witness-box—if he is allowed to get so
far by the number of officials who erect themselves into barricades at
different points, for the apparent purpose of acting in a spirit of wilful
ºbstructiveness, as if they felt that the penetralia of the Court will not
bear a very close inspection. The witness-box is a contrivance some-
what, on the principle of a plate-rack, º: surrounded with open
wooden railings; and the design may be intended to convey the idea of
the witness being literally on the rack, under, the powerful cross-
examination of the great forensic lights of the Palace Court.
On the right of the witness-box is a small space, which gives employ-
ment to three or four functionaries in plain clothes, whose occupation
seems to be, 1st, to fill º the space; 2nd, to call out “Silence” by turns
when the door opens, and "Pray, silence,” in chorus, when a vehicle is
heard passing outside the Court; while the duty of one of the officials is
to keep clear the space between himself, and #. great central stove,
#. º he and his colleagues may all get an uninterrupted view of the
re-place.
On the immediate right of this aperture is a box, raised about a foot
from the ground, and here there sits, on a small perch, an individual in
a black gown, whose chief employment seems to consist in shoving the
public of the step that leads up to his box, and exclaiming, with muc
- evident warmth, that he cannot bear to be suffocated, and "what’s
more, he won’t for nobody.” This personage is the acting usher of the
Court, and his wand of office is a sort of linendraper's measure, some
three or four yards in length, intended no doubt to represent the ample
measure of law—if not of justice—that the Palace Court is in the
habit of dealing out to its customers.
A little in the rear of the usher, and also in a box, is a veteran whose
duty it is to look to the safe custody of the jury, and who contributes-
by way of extra services—an occasional laugh at the wit of the barristers.
This task, if faithfully performed, is one of the hardest that devolves on
the functionaries of the Palace Court. -
We now approach the judicial Bench, but not without a feeling of
awe and reverence. This locality is divided from the body of the Court
by a sort of gulf, and is, in fact, a kind of peninsula, connected with the
mainland of the 'Palace court by a species of isthmus, which is peopled
with the Bar, who look down upon the sea of heads below, which is, in
fact, a miniature Mediterranean, being inclosed on all sides, and having
for its eastern coast a long tract of jurymen. - - -
Dropping, however, the geographical tone of our description, we
would call attention to the judgment seat, which is surmounted with a
tasteful cornice, and is backed by an antique tapestry of red cloth, on
which are worked in worsted—much worsted by time—the initials of
his ante-penultimate Majesty, GEORGE THE THIRD, with what formerly
were the Arms of England before our happy separation from Hanover.
The whole thing speaks of a by-gone age, and there is an air of obsolete-
ness even in the decorations of the Court, which belong to a period no
less than four reigns back in our history.
Perhaps the greatest feature of the whole Court is the Prothong-
tary, who sits under the Judge, and is certainly a prize specimen of his
order. The reading of this gentleman must be something tremen-
dous, if the saying of BACON, that “Reading makes a full man,” can
be relied upon, and he º be said to have literally absorbed the
library of the Court, for his seat, being situated in the centre of
a nest of book-shelves, has been widened from time to time, by
cutting away the shelves on each side, and contracting the space
allotted to the printed lore or law of the Palace Court. “The Books,”
to which lawyers are in the habit of referring with so much respect,
consist, as far as this tribunal is concerned, of an old Impey; a Directory
for the year 1819; a Ready Reckoner ; a Daa: ; a first edition of
Chitty, and some odd volumes of the Novelist's Library.
Such is the internal economy of this Court, if we may use the word
economy in reference to a place notorious for its extravagancies of a
pecuniary as well as of a social and moral character.
Having made the public acquainted with the locus, in guo, we shall
continue to report, as long as they last, the doings at the Palace Court.
AN ELIGIBLE OPPORTUNITY.
THE papers are full of “eligible opportunities” offered by the state
of things at California; and we may expect to find “EveRY MAN HIS
own Croesus,” adopted as a common *. to an advertisement.
All sorts of owners of all sorts of vessels are advertising their willing-
mess to place their craft—to say nothing of their cunning—at the
service of those who like to pay for it. - - - -
One of the richest, schemes—using the term richest in its facetious
rather than its pecuniary sense—that we have yet heard of, is a propo-
sition for the public to come forward and employ a number of men
"accustomed to the extraction of gold in all its forms,” and who would,
perhaps, justify their claim to the possession of this sort of talent by
immediately extracting gold in the form of preliminary deposits from
the pockets of those inclined to become shareholders in the new
project. The whole world is being invited in various ways to take
the pickaxe in hand, and come and pick a bit ºf the pot-luck-please
to §: that the gold is found in quartz, and hence we are justified
in the allusion to pot-luck—now waiting at California.
Waggeries of the Court Circular.
WE suspect that, by some extraordinary turn in the wheel of fortune,
some wag has been permitted to put his spoke into the Cºurt Circular.
We should as soon have thought of looking for a covey of partridges at
Charing Cross, a reindeer in Whetstone. Park, or a shilling in St.
Giles's pound, as for a joke in those stolid paragraphs that chrºnicle
from day to day the whereabouts and whatabouts of Royalty. It is,
however, no less strange than true, that a facetious hand has lately been
at work on the Court Circular. The witshown in its pages is not yet of
the very highest description; but we give a specimen to enable the
public to judge for themselves of the actual state of the Court news-
man's fund of facetiousness. He informed the world a few days ago,
just as the thaw had set in, that “HER MAJESTY, PRINCE ALBERT, an
the Royal children walked in the Slops as usual.”. The cunning
h|omission of the lettere, by which “Slopes” becomes Slops, forms the
point in this merry paragraph.

IMPORTANT POINT OF PRECEDENCE.
WESTMINstER HALL, or rather a square"yard
of one corner of it, was thrown into a state of
considerable uproar on the first day of Term by
the warm discussion of a point of precedence
between our distinguished and learned friend,
MR. BRIEFLEss, and another somewhat less
learned, but not at all distinguished, gentle-
man of the name of STUBBs, a member of the
Nor' by Nor' East Circuit, practising, or wishing
to practise at the Sou? Western Petty Sessions.
hese two gentlemen had each been intrusted
with a motion: that of Mr. BRIEFLess being an
application for a mandamus, to compel one of the
game-keepers of Hare Court to show by what
authority he exercised his office; and the brief of
Mr. STUBBs had given him, in the great Horse-
Guards Clock case, instructions to apply for a
rule—a 3-foot rule—to settle the minutes. The
two learned, or rather the-not-by-any-means-too-
learned Fº were each contending in a
corner of the Hall for their respective rights of
pre-audience, when MR. BRIEFLess, thinking to
settle the matter by stating the date of his call,
announccd 1840 as the year of his accession to
the Bar of England. “Pooh,” replied MR.
STUBBs, J.C. (Junior Counsel), “my call dates as
far back as 1810.” “Why, that,” replied MR.
BRIEFLEss, U.B. (Utter Barrister), ..." was the
year of your birth.” “Granted,” rejoined
STUBBs, B.A.L. (Barrister-at-Law); “but I was
born with a caul, and therefore myright of pre-
audience is established.”
BRIEFLEss, after a few minutes' con-
sideration of the knotty point, buried, his
face in his stuff sleeve, shed a tear, which
reduced his bands to the condition of weepers,
and allowed MR, STUBBs the precedence he had
demanded.
ELLIoTT's ENTIRE-The Admiralty.
MOLOCH,
Much ink has been sacrificed to this idol. Quills have been drawn
against quills; much papyrus, much parchment, much paper writ and
over-writ with doubt and dogmatism. Nevertheless, though so many
sages have laid their heads and beards together that, in the end, they
might drag MoLocH from the mists of Israelite antiquity into the
“light of common day,” MoLoch is yet an idol of darkness; a vague,
grim horror, indefinite in its terrible proportions. DIoDoRUs Siculus
avers that Morocº was a brazen statue, heated red hot; and in its
lºwing outstretched arms a child was laid, that it might be consumed,
alling piecemeal in the fire beneath. ... We cannot take MoLoch upon
this description. It is, in the words of political wisdom, too bad.
We have, of late—wherefore it matters not—been made to turn our
thoughts to MoLoch. We have had cause to ponder on the form and
attributes of the olden idol; and find the thing to be, like so many other
recent discoveries, a mere myth.
MoLoch has been worshipped in many places, in Tophet, in the
Valley of Hinnom; and—a fact, that has escaped all the Rabbinical
commentators—in a º: called Toot-in, which in the Syriac implies
To tout or Draw-in. It appears that upon this place was a large shed
or building, large enough to afford hospitality to some eight hundred
children, that—with adroit squeezing—would give room for six hundred
or so more; making some fourteen hundred at the least.
Now this place was watered by a ditch. And the ditch was fed by
2 stream from the Lun, A Tica Syl Um, which in Syriac means a home
for men filled with devils, and for lepers, And pestilence brooded upon
the ditch; and the angel of Death would rise from it, and cover with its
darkening wings fifty or a hundred of these little children. And so,
they were sacrificed.
But the little,ones were never laid upon the red-hot arms of a
brazen statue, to be burned bit by bit. Certainly not. They were not
put upon fiery brass, but on parochial metal. The arms of Moloch
mean, the films of a parish. Finally, for the brazen limbs of Moloch,
read the silver sixpences of Chelsea.
The Best AMERICAN Joke.—A dig at the Californian Gold Mines.
THE REAL LAND OF GOLD.
Poor old Golden Square has seen many vicissitudes; but an attempt is
now being made to revive it, by circulating an old legend that it
derives its name of Golden Square from the gold supposed to abound
in the soil, if any one would dig for it. There is some apparent autho-
rity for the story, in the fact of the square being almost filled with
lawyers, who were very likely to rush to any place where gold may be
E. We have heard that the inhabitants contemplate the
ormation of a Company, with a view to the discovery of gold; and if
they should not succeed, they will ask for more capital in order to carry
their operations into the silver districts º: to lie about Silver
Street. The present occupants, hearing that a rush will be made
upon their district, have taken the precaution to protect themselves,
by laying down large barricades of granite, which has rendered the
Square for some time to come practicably inaccessible. This measure
has been taken under the pretence of repairing the carriage-way;
but it is obvious, at a glance, that a nine-inch coating of granite on a
road over which the average traffic is two carriages and ten cabs per
week, could not have been intended for anything but to shut out from
Golden Square all but those who are already in possession of the
locality, Golden Square is virtually knocked out of the map of Europe,
by the heaps of enormous stones that have been pitched into it.
The Polka Plague.
WHEN the Polka first made its appearance we regarded it as a plea-
sant air enough; but it has lately assumed the appearance of a perfect
mal-aria, invading our whole musical atmosphere. The Mons Juli.IEN,
the modern musical JUPITER, has mingled, a little of his thunder with
the air, by the introduction of what he calls his Drum Polka; but this,
instead of clearing the air, has only encouraged some one else to bring
out a Trumpet Polka; and we are expecting every day to see the Tongs,
Shovel, and Poker Polka advertised. It seems to matter little what
may be the instruments º: for producing novelty, so that ".
is achieved; and we should not be surprised to hear of the Dutc
(Clock), Polka, the German (Silver) Polka, or the Police Polka, accom-
panied by the beating of the staves on heads arranged in various thick
nesses, with a view to perfect harmony.

PUNCH'S STREET ORDERLIES.
'. As the snow, and the sleet, and the hail, and the ice, all paid us ashort
visit, each in its turn, last week, it is as well that we should make
preparations to receive them on a proper footing. ...We would therefore
º: a new corps of Street Orderlies, and their duties should be
as Iollows :-
They should take up all little boys who are found pouring water on
the pavements over night, so as to have a jolly slide the next morning.
They should abolish all hoops, which are known to have a particular
facility of running between elderly gentlemen's legs, and tripping them
up in a manner which need not be felt to be appreciated.
They should ring the bells (servants’ and visitors' and area) of every
house that is too F. to sweep away the snow before its railings, and
keep on ringing the same till the nuisance is removed.
They might be furnished with summonses to serve immediately upon
such refractory houses as refused to comply with the above order.
º º be engaged by gentlemen of property and liberality to
sprinkle salt, or sawdust, or tea-leaves, or sand, or cheap moist sugar,
on the most slippery thoroughfares.
They should be directed to offer assistance to all horses who may
have found their level on the icy stones, and to lend a shoulder, when
needed, to every cart that finds a difficulty in moving its wheels.
They should be generally employed in preventing all the accidents
that occur from wintry causes, and in giving the utmost aid when the
same do occur.
There is no doubt such a body of men, well disciplined and not badly
paid, would render great service to every member of the community.
In short, Punch's Street Orderlies would do exactly what the police
ought to do, if the poor fellows had not so much hard work to perform
in every area, kitchen, cellar, and scullery, of the metropolis.
ILLUSTRATED CROSSINGS,
A NEW walk has been lately opened in the wide Field of Art.
Everything has been turned over for illustration; the Art-Manufac-
turers have seized hold of our pokers and tongs, and given a blow to
our bread-baskets; but still our street crossings continued untouched
by the hand of Fancy, and no artist has apparently thought it worth his
while to stoop to give them the slightest stir with the finger of Taste.
We knew this could not last. The soles of boots had been richly illumi-
nated in a style that only made us regret gentlemen did not walk on
their hands to exhibit the rich decorations of their heels; for really the
Mosaic work, as displayed in the windows of Burlington Arcade, is so
dazzling on the under-leathers, that it looks as if it was only worthy to
tread in the halls of the Alhambra, or to be a binding to one of Owen
JoNEs’s gorgeous books of colours. The street-crossing is now in every
way worthy of the boot. The mud, in many quarters, is carefully swept
into picturesque little pyramids on each side. These are connected by a
running border of the same material. The middle space is clean enough
for the most aristocratic spaniel to walk, across. It is as smooth as a
Bishop's lawn, and the sprigs of holly and the evergreens which are grace-
fully planted on the proud summit of each pyramid, make it a pleasant
avenue, which insensibly reminds one of the country, and shady lanes,
and quiet walks across, the fields. Occasionally a shell is thrown, in
along the border, and transports you to the seaside—thus bringing
the briny air of Margate into the foggy heart of London.
These Illustrated Crossings are a great advance upon the old vulgar
art of Sweeping.
THE TUSSAUD TEST OF POPULARITY.
In these days, no one can be considered positively popular, unless he
is admitted into the company of MADAME Tussaup's celebrities in Baker
Street. The only way in which a powerful and lasting impression can
be made on the public mind, is through the medium of wax. . You must
be a doll in Baker Street before you can become the i-dol(l) of the multi-
tude. The British Pantheon is the Bazaar, occupied by that lady,
and immortality is only to be purchased in this country, by gettin
admission into that distinguished body, of which NAPOLEoN an
HARE, Pius THE NINTH, BURRE, Louis-PHILIPPE, and JENNY LIND,
form some of the most renowned members. - -
MADAME Tussaud has become, in fact, the only efficient dispenser
of permanent reputation; and the glory of a sovereign, the triumphs of a
warrior, the wisdom of a statesman, the genius of an author, or even the
utmost atrocity of a criminal, would be insufficient as a passport to
fame, if MADAME Tussaud's wax ſailed to own the soft impeachment,
and hand down to, posterity the virtues, the achievements, or the
villanies, by which the parties in question have bought notoriety.
It is one of the advantages of a waxen medium of motoriety, that when
the popularity of the object waxes faint, the material may be easily
moulded into the shape of the new object, whoever he may be; and
thus a succession of wax-lights of the age can be kept up without the
cost of new stuff, as one replaces the other in public favour. When
CAvAIGNAc came into power, LEDRU RoLLIN was melted down in one of
those melting moods to which MADAME TUSSAUD is liable; and since
then, poor CAvAIGNAc himself has found his way into the pot, in order
that Louis-NApoleon, the last new lad of wax, may be formed out of
the remains of the lately all-popular General.

DOMESTIC HEROISMS :
BEING A DECEMBER DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DETERMINED MAN.
Awoke at six, with sense of duty so strong that it carried me with-
out the least difficulty (and I weigh sixteen stone) from my bed into the
middle of the room, with the thermometer (as I ascertained by my rush-
| light) nearly down to freezing point. , I stood shivering for a moment—
a new HERCULEs, between Self-indulgence on the one side, and Duty
on the other. The former, with her lazy eyes and tempting lip, drawing
me gently to the bed, the latter, with her severe brow, indignantly
dragging me towards the shower-bath.
. A rush—a strip—a pull–psh—plush—plush—slush-er-er-er-er-er–
Ah-h—h—h!. Reader | Did you ever pull the string of your shower-
bath (and you in it, remember) at six on a December morning, thermo-
meter two degrees above freezing point *
| -
If you have, you will understand the hearty shake of the hand which
I received from Duty, when in a minute I emerged from my curtains
celestial rosy red, like a river-god, in a mist of my own raising.
GOLD DUST OH ! DUST |
The newspapers are already beginning to enjoy, by anticipation,
some of the Californian gold, in the shape of the money spent in adver.
| tisements arising out of the great discovery. We shall soon have
whole columns of Californian Mining Schemes, Californian Shipping
Companies, and Californian Conveyance Associations, to say nothing of
implements for digging gold, and machines for washing it. We heard
of an old woman the other day who had formerly been a laundress—one
of those plebeian mothers whose expected sale of her mangle had been
the subject of popular inquiry—and who drew up an advertisement
announcing that—
“Having no further use for her washing-tub, she should be happy to part with it
to any one intending to go out on a Gold Washing Expedition to California.”
Already has an order arrived at Birmingham for ten thousand shovels
to dig up the gold; for it is generally understood that in the game of
fortune now being played in California, Spades will be trumps, and any
one who has not a Spade in his hand will have very little chance of
winning. A celebrated tin-warehouse is beginning to advertise “Dust-
pans for the collection of gold dust; ” and it is evident that a good
deal of this dust has already found its way into the eyes of the public
in England, as well as in America.
DO THE “ UNPAID” PAYP
THE public are, we suspect, beginning to find out the real value of
the Great. Unpaid, and the truth, that what costs nothing is usually
worth, nothing, grows daily more obvious. There was a specimen of
gratuitous wisdom a few days ago, on the first examination of the
parties suspected of the railway post-office robbery. The proceedings
-commenced by a gossip among the magistrates on the subject of the
past lives of the accused, and the conversation took an anecdotical turn,
in the course of which stories were told of the sudden and unac:
countable wealth of one of the parties in custody, his alleged habit of
wearing disguises, and other little prejudicial facts, which were far
more amusing than relevant. - - -
In another instance a worthy Unpaid is reported to have set down a
jury as a pack of fools, for disbelieving a witness; and, not content with
this, the worthy magistrate proceeded to bully a reverend brother on
the Bench, who ventured to disclaim the sentiments of the chairman.
It is all very well for the country to get the benefit of *:
magisterial wisdom; but there is no reason why juries should put up
with gratuitous abuse, or an entire Bench submit to one individual's
gratuitous insolence. -
The amount of modern Midasism spread over the country is some-
thing quite alarming to contemplate; and though the committals by the
Unpaid are numerous enough, the self-committals would be found to
preponderate.
A RUS IN URBE; or, THE GREEN HILLS
(RENTS) OF SMITHFIELD.
CoME, ye Sanitary Powers,
In American golosh;
Like a troop of laughing Hours,
Strewing sweetly-smelling flowers,
Trip it through the Smithfield squash.
Scattering marjoram and thyme,
Fraught with disinfecting scents,
Fresh as breath of Summer's prime,
Chloride sprinkling round of ſime,
Let us roam o'er Greenhill's Rents.
There to view the stalls and pens,
Housing cattle, sheep, and swine,
And the close-adjoining dens,
Where, thank London's citizens,
Human creatures herd with kine.
Crib on shed, and sty on fold,
Side by side with floor on floor,
Here—the flocks and herds behold,
To the blue-robed Merchant sold,
There—the dwellings of the poor.
Posies to your mostrils held,
Gaze on the contrasted scene;
By its odour unrepelled
Mark the lodgings, paralleled,
Scarcely half a foot between.
Listen to the lambkins’ bleat,
Mingled with the infants' cry;
Human speech in concert sweet
With the lowing of the neat,
And the music of the sty.
Pleasant incense is the reek
Rising from that vaulted cell
With the hog's expiring squeak,
On the First Day of the week,
Blending with the early bell.
To inhale this healthful breeze,
How refreshing, day and night !
Soothed with rural sounds like these
Gentle pastoral harmonies
Must not slumber, too, be light?
Come then, Sanitary Powers,
Come with fragrant vinegar;
Shed we purifying showers
On these blest and balmy bowers,
Driving pestilence afar.
Gingerly, on cautious toe,
Let us then our steps retrace,
To the Corporation go,
And demand the cause to know
Why they suffer such a place?
Filthy are the brutes that fill
Smithfield's noisome stalls and sties;
There are others, filthier still,
At whose door this monstrous ill,
This atrocious nuisance, lies.

CHILD’S PARTIES :
AND A RE MONSTRANCE CONCERNING THEM,
Tºs 4 oncerVE, Sir, that in spite of my warm-
| ing and entreaty we were invited
to no less than three Childs' Parties
last Tuesday; to two of which, a
lady in this house, who shall be
nameless, desired that her chil-
dren should be taken. On Wed-
nesday we had DR. LENs's micro-
scope; and on Thursday you were
º enough to send me your box
or the Haymarket Theatre; and
of course MRs. S. and the children
are extremely obliged to you for
the attention. I did not mind the
theatre so much. I sate in the
back of the box, and fell asleep.
I wish there was a room with
easy, chairs and silence enjoined,
... whither parents might retire, in
the houses where Children's Parties are given. But no—it would be of
no use: the fiddling and piano-ſorte playing and scuffling and laughing
of the children would keep you awake - -
I am looking out in the papers for some eligible schools where there
shall be no vacations—I can't bear these festivities much longer. I
begin to hate children in their ...; dresses: when children are
attired in those absurd best clothes, what can you expect from them
but affectation and airs of fashion?. One day last year, Sir, having to
conduct the two young ladies who then frequented juvenile parties, I
found them, upon entering, the fly, into which they had preceded me
under convoy of their maid—I found them—in what a condition, think
you? Why, with the skirts of their stiff muslin frocks, actually thrown
over their heads, so that they should not crumple in the carriage!. A
child who cannot go into society but with a muslin frock in this position,
I say, had best stay in the nursery in her pinafore. If you are not
able to enter the world with your dress in its proper º I say stay
at home. I blushed, Sir, to see that MRs. S. didn't blush when I in-
formed her of this incident, but only laughed in a strange indecorous
manner, and said that the girls must keep their dresses meat.-Neatness
as much as you please, but I should have thought Neatness would wear
her frock in the natural way. - - -
And look at the children when they arrive at their place of destina-
tion; what processes of coquetry they are made to go through! They
are first carried into a room where there are puns, combs, looking-
glasses, and lady's-maids, who shake the children's ringlets out, spread
abroad their great immense sashes and ribbons, and finally send them
full sail into the dancing-room. With what a monstrous precocity they
ogle their own faces in the looking-glasses! I have seen my boys,
Gustavus and Apolphus, grin into the glass, and arrange their curls
or the ties of their neckcloths with as much eagerness as any grown-up
man could show, who was going to pay a visit to the lady of his heart;
With what an abominable complacency they fº. out their little gloves, and
examine their silk stockings! How can they be natural or unaffected
when they are so preposterously conceited about their fine clothes?
The other day we met one of Gus's schoolſellows, MASTER CHAFFERs,
at a party, who entered the room with a little gibus hat under his arm,
and to be sure made his bow with the aplomb of a dancing-master of
sixty; and my boys, who I suspect envied their comrade the gibus
hat, began to giggle and sneer at him; and, further to discºncert him,
Gus goes up to º: and says, “Why, CHAFFERs, you consider yourself
a deuced fine fellow, but there's, a straw on your trowsers.” Why
shouldn't there be? And why should that poor little boy be called
upon to blush because he came to a party in a hack-cab? I, for my
part, ordered the children to walk home on that night, in order to punish
them for their pride. It rained. Gus wet and spoiled his shiny boots,
DoL got a cold, and my wife scolded me for cruelty. -
As to the airs which the wretches give themselves about dancing, I
need not enlarge upon them here, for the dangerous artist of the “Rising
Generation” has already taken them in hand. Not that his satire does
the children the least good; they don't see anything absurd in courting
}. girls, or in asserting the superiority of their own sex over, the
emale. A few nights since, I saw MASTER SULTAN at a juvenile ball,
standing at the door of the dancing-room, egregiously displaying his
muslin pocket-handkerchief, and waving, it about as if he was in
doubt to which of the young beauties he should cast it. ."Why
don't you dance, MASTER SULTAN ?” says L., “ { º: Sir,” he
answered, “just look round at those girls and say if I can dance P”
flººd selfish now, what will that boy be, Sir, when his whiskers
grow
And when you think how MRs. MAINCHANCE seeks out rich partners
for her little boys—how my own admirable Eliza has warned her
children—“My dears, I would rather you should dance with your BRown
cousins than your Jones cousins,” who are a little rough in their
manners; (the fact being, that our sister, MARIA Jones lives at
Islington, while FANNY BRown is an Upper Baker Street lady)—when
I have heard my dear wife, I say, instruct our boy, on going to a party
at the Baronet's, by no means to neglect his cousin ADELIZA, but to
dance with her as soon as ever he can engage her-what can I say, Sir
but that the world of men and boys is the same—that society is poisoned
at its source—and that our little chubby-cheeked cherubim are in-
structed to be artful and egotistical, when you would think by their faces
they are just fresh from heaven.
Among the very little children, I confess I get a consolation as I
watch them, in seeing the artless little girls walking after the boys to
whom they incline, and courting them, by a hundred innocent little
wiles and caresses, putting out their little hands, and inviting them to
dances, seeking them out to pull crackers with them, and begging them
to read the mottoes, and so forth—this is as it should be—this is natural
and kindly. The women, by rights, ought to court the men; and they
would if we but left them alone.” -
And, absurd as the games are, I own I like to see some thirty or
forty of the creatures on the floor in a ring, playing at petits jewº, of all
ages and sexes, from the most insubordinate infanthood of MASTER
JACKY, who will crawl out of the circle, and talks louder than anybody
in it, though he can't speak, to blushing Miss LILY, who is just con-
scious that she is sixteen—I own, I say, that I can't look at such a
circlet or chaplet of children, as it were, in a hundred different colours,
laughing and happy, without a sort of pleasure... How they laugh, how
they twine together, how they wave about, as if the wind was passing
over the flowers! Poor little buds, shall you bloom long?—(I then say to
myself, by way of keeping up a proper frame of mind)—shall frosts nip
you, or tempests scatter you, drought wither you, or rain beat you down?
And, oppressed with my feelings, I go below and get some of the weak
negus with which Children's Parties are refreshed. .. -
. At those houses where the magic lantern is practised, I still, some-
times get a degree of pleasure, by hearing the voices of the children in
the dark, and the absurd remarks which they make as the various scenes
are presented—as, in the dissolving views, Cornhill changes into Grand
Cairo, as CUPID comes down with a wreath and pops it onto the head of
the DUKE OF WELLINGTON, as Saint Peter's at Rome suddenly becomes
illuminated, and fireworks, not the least like real fireworks, begin to go
off from Fort St. Angelo—it is certainly not unpleasant to hear the
“o-o-o’s” of the audience, and the little children chattering in the
darkness. But I think I used to like the “Pull devil, pull baker,” and
the DogtoRSYNTAx of our youth, much better than all your new-fangled
dissolving views and pyrotechnic imitations.
As for the conjuror, I am sick of him. There is one conjuror I have
met so often this year and the last, that the man looks quite guilty when
the folding doors are opened and he sees my party of children, and
myself amongst the seniors in the back rows. He forgets his jokes
when he beholds me: his wretched claptraps and waggeries fail him:
he trembles, falters, and turns pale. -
I on my side too feel reciprocally uneasy. What right have we to be
staring that creature out of his silly countenance?. Very likely he has
a wife and family dependent for their bread upon his antics.. I should
be glad to admire them if I could; but how do so? When I see him
squeeze an orange or a cannonball right away into nothing, as it were,
or multiply either into three cannon-balls or oranges, I know the
others are in his pockets somewhere. I know that he doesn't put out
his eye when he sticks the penknife into it: or that after, swallowing
(as the miserable humbug pretends to do) a pocket handkerchief, he
cannot by any possibility convert it into a quantity of coloured wood-
shavings. . These flimsy artifices may amuse children, but not, us, I
think I shall go and sit down below amongst the servants whilst this
wretched man pursues his idiotic delusions before the children.
And the supper, Sir, of which our darlings are made to partake.
Have they dined? I ask. Do they have a supper at home, and why do
not they P Because it is unwholesome. If it is unwholesome, why do
they have supper at all? I have mentioned the wretched Tº: of the
negus. How they can administer such stuff to children I can’t think.
Though only last week I, heard a little boy, MASTER SwilBy, at
Miss WATERs' say, that he had drunk nine glasses of it, and eaten I
don't know how many, tasteless sandwiches and insipid cakes; after
which feats he proposed to fight my youngest son.

MORNINGS AT THE MIDI)LESEX SESSIONS.
THERE is something quite delightful in the gossip occasionally
reported by the newspapers as having formed the mornings' occupation
at the Middlesex Sessions. SERJEANT ADAMs is a perfect Pepys in
his way; and as to the small talk of MR.PAYNE, we perceive it
continuing to get so very “small by degrees,” that in time we hope
we shall have “beautifully less” of it.
Nothing can be more cheerful and chatty than the Bench and the Bar
at Clerkenwell, where nearly every business morning is converted into
a Matinée, Anecdotique by the interchange of remarks and historiettes
between the judge and the barristers. MR SERJEANT ADAMs most
beautifully adapts his matter to his subject; for it is when he has a
small boy before him, that his small talk flows forth in wondrous affluence.
With a convicted urchin in the dock, the good-natured Judge pours out
such a copious stream of ana, that MATHEws's entertainments may be
said to be revived at the Clerkenwell Sessions. Anecdotes of Park-
hurst, little traits of juvenile character, the horrors of an open door,
excruciating agony of a judge with a stiff neck, with some of the minor
topics of the day, treated occasionally in a didactic, sometimes in a
conversational, and now and then in a facetious style, will well repay a
prosecutor at the Middlesex Sessions for the loss of an occasional
pocket-handkerchief.
* A few days ago, the proceedings went suddenly off into a conversa-
zione, which was briefly opened º, MR. MELLOR, who asked whether
SERJEANT Apams had been present at MR.CHARLEs PEARSON's
lecture on Prison Discipline. The Learned Serjeant had not, but he
took the question as a cue for a lecture of his own on the same subject,
in the course of which he introduced an essay on the Art of Thieving,
which he declared was a trade; and he threw out by way of hint-
which nobody took—that he had close at hand, in his private room,
“hundreds of authenticated cases showing the training of thieyes;” but
he received no encouragement to step into the next room and produce
his precious documents for perusal and comment.
MR. PAYNE, who makes a fairish Boswell to the Serjeant's Johnson,
endeavoured to “cut in” with an episode on Education, and had just
declared Ragged Schools to be his “hobby,” when the learned J*:::
fearing that a ride on the “hobby” was, meditated, pulled the
barrister uppretty sharp, and discovered that the whole thing was very
: It is a peculiar and happy knack of the Serjeant's, that he is able to
terminate a Sessions conversazione directly it becomes rather, dry, or
when any one else is talking but himself, by a sudden recollection that
the business of the Court is at a stand-still and that the Matinée should
be judiciaire instead of chit-chatique, which is too apt to be the
quality of the Mornings at Middlesex.
A Split in the Bank.
WE see MR. BALDw1N has been splitting a bank note. We do not
know whether a bank note, like a secret, is likely to go any further for
being split, or whether a £5 note, split into two notes, is equal to £10;
but if MR. BALDw1N will only give us £10 for every £5 note we haye,
he is perfectly welcome to split the difference. By-the-bye, MR.
BALDwiN would not be a bad mediator to send to Schleswig Holstein,
in order to split the difference (whatever it may be) that has so long
existed there. But if MR. BALDwiN can increase our resources two:
fold, merely by dividing them, he is unquestionably the first Financial
Reformer of the age, and should certainly have a seat in the House, if
it is only to represent Dublin. The next time he tries an experiment
upon a £1000 note—the Bank will of course supply the material—we
should like uncommonly to be present, merely to cry out “Halves.”
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING.
THE French are really a complimentary nation; they are most
anxious not to offend Louis-NAPOLEoN in their election of Vice Presi-
dent—for they say our President is so very bad, that it will never do
for him to find his Wice-worser. (If Colon EL SIBThoRPE does not remove
this joke from our office in less than two days, he may certainly expect an
action for damages.—PUNCH.

THE PRINCIPLES OF PAUPER FARMING.
DESCENDING from our high pinnacle of moral elevation to the level of
common humanity—or not uncommon inhumanity—we ask ourselves
what we should do with pauper children if we farmed them of a parish
at four-and-sixpence a head, as the pauper infants were farmed at
Tooting P. We think we should endeavour to get as much out of our
four-and-sixpence as we could. It strikes us that we should try to
make one blanket do the work of two, and a bed originally calculated
to accommodate but one, hold three. We should have frocks and
trowsers cut very short and low, with a view to economy of material.
We should test to the utmost the elasticity of cloth, worsted, and
flannel, in the attempt with a limited extent of fabric to clothe a given
body. We should not inquire very closely into the mealiness or waxi-
ness, soundness or unsoundness, of potatoes, provided we were satisfied
with their price. We should be solicitous to compress the largest
number of inmates into the smallest dimensions of space, and to warm
the latter with as little fuel as we could. In our dietetic arrangements,
farinaceous and vegetable especially, vegetable would preponderate
greatly over animaliood. In the event of sickness, we should be dis-
#: to lean to the homoeopathic system, and to trust rather to the
ealing power of cheap Nature than to the curative efficacy of expen-
sive medicine. In short, we should be for sustaining human life by the
scantiest of means, at the lowest of figures, and should consider all out-
lay for human comfort as extravagance.
Our farming operations would not include a system of extensive
drainage, since the field we should cultivate would not be rendered
more productive by that process. We should sow the seeds of disorder,
but not much else. We should cut down everything on the farm that
did not bring grist to the mill. Thus, no doubt, we should reap a
remunerative harvest—together with such consequences as those which
have occurred at Tooting.
It becomes, then, a question for parochial authorities to consider
whether they will continue to maintain the system of pauper-farming;
which, looking down upon it from our reassumed altitude of feeling, we
regard as decidedly scandalous.
PENMANSHIP FOR PHYSICIANS.
GRIEvous complaints have reached Mr. Punch of the disastrous con-
sequences which have arisen from illegible prescriptions. Ever anxious
for the improvement of all bad writers, Mr. Punch has been induced to
offer his services to physicians; and he has great pleasure in publishing
the following testimonial to the efficacy of his system, which is simply
#.writing medical prescriptions in words at length and in plain
nglish:-
This is the way in which I wrote a prescription before taking six
lessons from Mr. Punch.

Trac Hyoscy: 3 vss

Aq: Menth : Pip: 3 xivss—ft
Mist: cuj: str 3iss ter die.
The subjoined is a specimen of my new and improved style of writing
a prescription, after having received the benefit of six lessons in the
method of Mr. Punch.
Take ten drops of prussic acid, five drachms and a half of tincture
of henbane, one drachm and a half of tincture of foxglove, and fourteen
ounces and a half of peppermint water, to make a mixture, of which
three tablespoonfuls are to be taken thrice a-day.

. Of these prescriptions, one is a literal translation of the other; and
since all druggists’ apprentices do not understand Latin, and a mistake
as to a zigzag may occasion an 3 to be dispensed for a 3, that is to say,
an ounce for a drachm, whereas such a mistake, in the case of such
medicines, as henbane and foxglove would prove fatal, therefore it is
respectfully submitted to the Faculty that they had much better write
their orders in words at length, and in their native tongue, than in a
dead, language and in symbols. And Mr. Punch hereby desires the
President of the College of Physicians to tell that learned body to take
this important matter into consideration, and at their next meeting to
discuss the question why a prescription should not be as intelligible as

from patients what it is that they have to swallow. Ignorance in this
respect is no longer bliss, and consequently it is not folly to be wise:

streets, he has got “a bone to pick” in a gentleman's kitchen.
Acute Criticism.
A CRITIC of ome of the morning papers, speaking of the performance
of Hamlet at the Haymarket, says that one of the actors “gave colour to
the part of Osrick.” -
The extreme astuteness of this remark is quite astounding; and we
only regret that the able critic did not go on to enlighten us as to the
mode employed by the actor in giving colour to Osrick. The ordinary
instrument is a hare's foot; but perhaps the newspaper critic would
have gone so learnedly into the subject, as to show some other mode of
giving colour in this instance. We are surprised at his having omitted
all allusion to the colour given by the actor to Hamlet, whose cele-
brated remark, “To this complexion must we come at last,” seems to
create the sort of criticism the writer has been indulging in.

THE OGRE OF TOOTING. - -
We have hitherto been accustomed to consider the OGRE as
fabulous being—the mere chimera of the nursery. Henceforth, wº
believe in OGREs. History.will place it indelibly on record, that
there was once upon a time such a monster at Tooting - a
stomach-pinching, back-stripping QGRE. He kept his little victims
huddled in noisome dens, in abominable filth and misery; he
suffered them to shiver, half clad, in the bitterest cold, and he
starved them to such a degree that they were glad to devour swine's
offal. And so he continued his ill treatment of the poor wretches,
till Death, in consequence of it, at last rushed in and released them
from his gripe. -
These children were consigned to the clutches of the OGRE (for 4s. 6d.
a head), by reason of a certain trifling mistake on the part of those who
were called their Guardians. The mistake was evidently a notion that
they, being, paupers, possessed neither sensitive bodies mor, human
souls. We have described some of the outrages which were inflicted
on them Pºłº now for atrocities practised on them both in body
and soul. Let PATRICK SHEEN, a boy 10 years of age, speak here, to
this point, as he spoke at the Coroner's Inquest on the dead. --
“They would not let us go out for a walk, for fear we should run away. . When
the boys ran away, they used to beat them and shave their heads for punishment.
When they were caught, some of them were birched, and others had to put girls'
clothes on. Sometimes they had to wear girls' clothes three or four days—sometimes
a week.”
Fancy this! Let anybody, once a high-minded boy, imagine to him-
self the frantic rage, the ferocious hatred which would have burnt in
his heart, had he been made the subject of this devilish mockery.
Birched, and dressed in girls' clothes, and kept in the agonies of
ineffable shame for a week! And merely for playing truant. '. Is it
conceivable that even the most º offence could deserve such a
torment as this? . Think, too, of the “moral and religious training”
of children thus habituated to inflict on one another the tortures of
derision—made mutual executioners, like a society of fiends. The
man who could impose so infamous a punishment, would be in-
adequately requited by the brand, the feather-bed, and the tar-brush,
inflictions which, though sufficiently nasty and brutal, are at least not
unnaturally revolting.
A DANCING UNIVERSITY.
In these days of University Reform, we are not surprised at the
bold attempt of our noble friend NATHAN to establish, in his barony at
Kennington, a College of Dancing. . - - -
That the Terpsichorean art was once identified with our great seats of
learning, may be gathered from, the fact of the existence of the College
Hornpipe, in which it is possible our youths used once to graduate;
for every step of it is a gradus ad scientiam of a very different
character. Who so fit as the man who, Columbus-like, yolked the egg
with an ingenious discovery, to associate, the dance with the severer
studies, and to found a College in which there shall be such degrees as
Bachelor of Reels, Master of Minuets, Fellow of Highland Flings, and
Doctor of Polkas? In his new University the Pons Asinorum will be
passed in a pas seul, and the classical tripos will be arranged as a sort
of three-legged dance in the form of a pas de deur for two competitors,
... We understand that a site is in contemplation for the new College at
Kennington Oval, the spot being considered appropriate to one whose
name will go down to posterity in connection with those oval feats by
which his numerous ovations have been merited.
-
Drinking Gold.
THE grape, we read, is cultivated with the greatest success in
California. Fancy drinking Californian wine! How rich it must be It
must be something like our very best “golden sherries,” only with much
more gold in it. The bouquets alone, we can fancy, would fetch a guinea
a-piece, in Covent Garden Market, and the crust of one of their full-
bodied Californian ports must supply the poor, family to whom it was
thrown, with bread all its life. Only imagine, also, what quantities of
Eau de Wie de Dantzic must be made every year on the banks of the
Sacramento! ...They have only to dip the bottle into the river to brin
it out filled with those little rags of gold that you see dancing up an
down, as if each particle was, tipsy, in the above-named brandy. Of
course, theying which flourishes in California was originally imported
from the Côte-D'or; and a gown made from such a slip would be a
sure fortune to a lady. Why, it would be nothing but a tissue of gold! it

MISS BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
MISS B. AND THE WICE-CHANCELLOR'S “CONWICTS" OF LITERATURE.
—COBDEN IN DANGER –THE MONKEY AND THE BALANCE OF
POWER.—THE POPE'S SPIDER,
ON my life, Mr. Punch, I’ve a good mind to la
down my pen for ever and ever. I've been read-
ing all the long law account—spinning off the
cobwebs, as BAGSTER, the milkman, says—in the
Court of Chancery, where the QUEEN and PRINCE
ALBERT are at this present minute like the
lowest subjeck. And this is called the Majesty
of the Law, that altogether tops the Majesty of
the Sov’reign. Well, if I’d been a queen, and
my fine arts had been interfered with by any
bookseller soever, if I wouldn't have sent him off
to the Tower, with nothing but a quire of foolscap,
a bottle of ink, and a steel pen, to get his living
with ! Yes; with nothing to do but to write a
book, and nobody to buy it of him. In Chancery!
Well, I do pity poor PRINCE ALBERT, and our
sweet ; the QUEEN, . racious maybor.
I’m only thinking if the bookseller had been in
Russia, and meddled with the plates of the Emp'ror
—that all our Red Book fell in love with, he was
so, handsome, and so tall in his stockings—I’m
: thinking that NICHOLAs would have lim-
meditly sent for the bookseller's head in a dish,
by the very first delivery. But with us there is what is called the
- of the Law, that won't let our beloved Queen cut, off the
* a bookseller. A limited monarkie, indeed! Why, it’s
However, what’specially set me in a twitter was this. The Vice-
Chancellor, KNIGHT BRUCE—(whether he won his, spurs of knight-
hood in the Court, or like a chanticleer was born with 'em, I don't care
to know)—the Wice said these stunnin words—“There were even now
callings, in which, to be convicted of literature, was dangerous.” I know
the Vice reads Punch—could he point at me? Am I to believe, if it’s
known that I, MATILDA BENIMBLE, who takes care of empty houses—
mansions I should say—if I’m convicted of pen and ink, that I'm no
longer to be trusted? That I’m to be turned out of my bis'ness
because writing's dangerous? I’ve known folks convicted of bigamy,
and other foolish superfluities; convicted of stolen spoons, convicted of
setting a house a fire—but convicted of a book!. Lor! Mr. Punch,
shouldn't you and I like to be some of the convicts I could name?
There’s that convict SHAKSPEARE, that’s been shaking his chains of
“linked sweetness,” as I’ve somewhere read, afore the QUEEN-and
the convict WALTER Scott—and the convict in highlife, Lord BYRON,
and a whole gang of convicts that, as I said, have made the world—not
a Botany Bay—but a big flower-garden. And then, how, very rude,
even in a judge, afore the convicts that were in Court under his very
nose! For instance, there was the convict SERIEANT TALFOURD, with
all his Ion on him (why has he no more Ions in the fire *), and the
convict SAMTVEL WARREN, that writ that sweet big book How and
h'hen / Why should they have their ink-phials poured upon their
heads, from the hands of any Vice that may sit upon a bench: It’s
cruel: it’s worse—it’s low.
There’s nothing talked of but the parings-down of RICHARD CoB-
PEN, that, as the poet says of beauty- when unadorned's adorned
the most.” He is going to turn the whole government into a Savings
Bank. All the world's to go upon a peace 'stablishment; and what
we're to save in gunpowder, we are to take out in tea; what we do
without in pipeclay, we’re to get back in butter; and, saving money
for grape-shot, we're to spend the more in cheap malt. My 'pinion
is, it never can be done. hat says the Mutiny Act, that was turned
inside out, by MR. MILNER GIBSON? It says (Icopy from the paper)-
“It is judged necessary by the Crown and Parliament to continue a body
ºf forces for the safety of the United Kingdom, and for the preservation of
the balance of º The balance of power is all very well; but
certainly John BULL is always called upon to find the golden weights.
But I see what MR. CoBDEN’s up to; he wants to trim the balance of
ower, just as the monkey weighed the two bits of cheese...When one
it was too heavy, he took a good bite of it; well, this bite made it
lighter than the other, and down went the other, scale; then, the
monkey took the heavier piece, and bit his name with all, his teeth in
that, and of the two bits, why, that of course was made lightest. And
so the monkey first bit one piece and then the other, that, at last,
there was not a single crumb of cheese left in either of the scales.
Now, this, I know it, is precisely what MR. CoEDEN wants to do with
the balance of Europe:–To take regiments and cannon out of one
scale, and squadrons and bomb-shells out of the other; and French
guards, and British grenadiers. Now Don Cossacks, and now PRINCE
ALBERT's cherry-coloured Eleventh. This is the unadorned way in
which RICHARD CoEDEN wants to leave Britannia; without a single
flounce of cannon, and then, I should like to know who'd go to
Brighton;, who’d visit Margate, Gravesend, Herne Bay ? To have
what is called a descent made when there was no moon, upon peaceable
families, and be carried off to France, in one's night-cap!—My blood
runs cold to think of it!
But, as I understand- (a military family looked at the house
on Monday, and I; heard MAJOR Swallowfire talking of it to a
friend) – as I understand, the Clubs perpose to circumnavigate
CoBDEN; and in this manner. He is to be watched for going
down, to Parliament: then violently, laid hold on, and carried, into
a back room of the United, Pipeclay and Oakum. When there,
he will be gagged with an old, Army List, that he mayn't go into
his old trick of argiment. He will be made to sit down upon a drum
when SIR WILLIAM NAPIER—ready primed—will come in with a crow
of officers, blue and red, and read to RICHARD COBDEN the lives—with
running comments—of ALEXANDER, and CESAR, and BonAPARTE, and
BLUECUR, and WINDYscBATCH, and all the heroes that have raised
sprigs of laurels with the flesh-and-blood of human creturs. Then
another officer, with a good bold voice, will sing a new song, to be
called The Army Tailor; or, Laurel and Cabbage; and when RICHARD
CoBDEN is carried out of himself, as he must be, into the very scarlet
fever of glory, why, then, in the moment of gunpowder weakness,
the serjeant will come in, give him a shilling, take off the recruit in
a cab, and the very next morning CoRDEN will be seen adorned in
red, and—with John BRIGHT, no dºubt, weeping in the distance-
doing the goose-step in Birdcage Walk. This, dear, Mr. Punch,
is the conspiracy against MR. Cobden. A course, I didn't seem to
hear a word. Qh, no! But you should have heard how that hºrrid
Major grinned, like SAwNEY BEAN at a banquet of baby, as he laid out
the whole plan. “We shall see”—cried the horrid wretch—“we shall
see whether the Manchester print will take scarlet.” Disgusting!
I hope MR. CoRDEN reads Punch; if so, he is warned, and saved; if
not, he is crimped, drilled—(they call it drilling, I call it boring)–and
sent abroad. And, peaceable as we now are, MR. CoBDEN, in his
private capacity of a military man, may be leading a forlorn hope º:
the guns of the Chinese, instead of standing up for their gunpowder in
the Commons...And, I must confess, of the two, my feelings don't gº
so much with the cannon as the teapot. After all, it will be a sweet
thing to save ten millions—ſhow much, Mr. Punch, will that be a-piece,
the poor included?)—ten millions, if it's only for pocket-money; But
I look at it in this way. Why, every extra spoonful I put into the tea:
ot is so much saved from a forty-two pounder. Every extra bit of
utter—(MR. CoBDEN promises butter with no tax at all)—is so much
got out of the pitch and tar; every glass of ale—(and I do like my half-
pint of ale)—is the cheap blood of John BARLEYCORN, and not the
º, as well as dear commodity, that runs to waste when it runs to
glory.
Only, Punch, there’s this to be settled. MR. CoBDEN looks at the
map of the world; and, stretching out his hands, says, “Peace;” while
other folks—'specially the Army and the Navy—cry, “War.” They 're
like two folks in a house—one will smell fire, and the other won't: one
will send off for the engines; and one will lock the door, and won't, on
no account, let the Fenix in. My own ºpinion is-it looks a little thick
in Italy. As for all the rumpus of 1848, why, it’s my notion, that,
like acatin achina-closet, the Pope has done it all. He began the game—
(mind, I’m not a blaming him for that; he meant like a gentleman,I am
sure)—but what he did in Italy stirred 'em up in France, and so it went
on. And now he’s to be taken backinto the bosom of Rome-taken and
lodged once more in the Watercan, astride on a cannon! I have heard
of the cannons of the Church; but I never thought that even a Pope
would ride over 'em. But, no doubt, all will by-and-bye be right.
this world, as my poor father used to say—he said it was Latin, but I
don't know, I’m sure—“Great is truth, and prevails a bit.”
To be sure, the Pope, since he’s been in trouble, has taken to odd
sorts of pets. There’s that Bonbon, the King where the Naples soap
comes from-(with such soap, why can't His Majesty keep cleaner
hands?)—why, the Pope, poor man, has been saying all sorts of sugar-
candy of him. Here’s a bit, that I write from my paper—the Pope says,
of the Naples Soap that came to pay his duty to him, the Pope says-
“The mere beholding the example of#. most religious sovereign repeated
by the magistrates,” and so on. ligious sovereign! Well, I don't
know; but if butchering people is religion, I suppose a dagger is to
pass for a prayer-book. But I know how it is. Trouble brought the
poor Pope to this. Wasn't it BARON TRENCK, or somebody of that
sort, who was put into a dungeon by FREDERICK THE GREAT BEAST-
wasn’t it he that made a pet of a nasty spider?—fiddling and,whistling
to the dirty little reptile, and no doubt calling the thing all sorts of
pretty names. , Well, the Baron—poor man!-was º: to, it by
trouble. He had tumbled into ill luck, and so made friends of a
crawling, cruel insect. So, we musn't, all things, considered, be hard
upon the poor Pope. Away from Rome-missing all the comforts of
the Watercan—we can't wonder that in his trouble, a little forgetting

flººr.
LECTURE. W.
SIR,
My Lectures have lately been suspended, partly, Sir, on account
of the Christmas holidays, when we lawyers are employed in eating our
own goose, instead of cooking that of our clients. But Term has re-
commenced, and I avail myself of your attendance here to-day with
that document, which, if I mistake not, will instruct me to ask for
judgment against the casual ejector Doe—that very useful Doe, out of
whom we make so much of our bread. Yes, Sir, you have come here
to instruct me, but I feel it is my mission to instruct you, and I will do
so by a resumption of my Lectures in this Hall, whose umbrella-stand
jingles again in sympathetic response to my eloquence.
Let me now approach a very delicate subject—I mean the nature and
extent of the use which you ought to make of our branch of the pro-
fession. When ought you to employ counsel? is a question which you
may fairly ask, and which, when I know the state of your funds, I may
fairly answer...It is an old saying, that he who is his own counsel has
a fool for his client. But I am my own counsel; and am I a fool? No,
Sir, I am a much greater fool when I am your counsel, if I consent to
become so without having in hand the required quiddam. In employing
counsel you must use your discretion; but counsel, in being employed
by you, must use his discretion also... Woe to that barrister who,
caught by the tape-tied foolscap, and flattered by his name appearing on
the back of it, with the illusory addition of 2, 3, or 5 gas, as the case
may be, Woe, Gee, Woe! I say to that barrister who shall eagerly
clutch at the brief delusion, and find that the attorney, baser than the
baseless fabric of a vision, has gone away, and literally.
“Left not a rap behind.”
No, Sir, try not on that desperate game again with me. You have set
down that cause for trial a little too frequently, and I have allowed my
judgment to go by default; in future, Sir, you must come with your
money, as the song says–
“Down, derry down, derry down, derry down, down,”
ºr it is useless your coming here at all. This reminds me of a caution
I once received from my leader in a case of some importance, where I
was engaged to do the work, and a Queen's Counsel, now on the Bench,
was secured, for the look of the thing, my client having said to me,
“We must have a bit of silk, MR. BRIEFLEss, for ornament; but it is
to you I look for the right sort of stuff.” My client, who was a wag
although an attorney, referred to the materials of our respective gowns,
though, after all, the material is the most immaterial, thing that can be
imagined. Well, Sir, we went into Court. My leader took me aside,
and, with a look I never shall forget, a tone I shall never cease to
remember, and a poke in the ribs that haunts me still, he said to me,
“BRIEFLEss, my boy, we are done.” “How done?” said I. “M
clerk tells me he has not had the fee,” said he ; and then he added,
“Have you got yours?” Aft vacant stare expressed, I suppose, the
yacancy of my pocket, for my leader resumed, “It’s a do; but let this
be a lesson to you, and never let this do be a ditto, or, to use the ordi-
mary abbreviation, a do repeated.” Inever forgot the advice thus given
me; and when I seemy former leader, now sitting in banco, with all the
dignity that a red riding-habit, an ermine tippet, and two pillows of
horse-hair enveloping his benevolent head can impart, I often feel
inclined to return that poke in the ribs—of which I still owe him
one—and to whisper to him, as I hand in my accustomed motion of
course, “I’ve taken your advice, mylord: the do has not been repeated
at my expense, and I don't intend it ever shall be again.” .
I see, Sir, that you understand the force and the application of this
little anecdote. You are returning that brief to your pocket—that
pocket which you know is unsupplied with the º e feel Go,
Sir, elsewhere if you please, but the do will not do, and, as I have
already hinted, must not be a do repeated here. As the bard has
beautifully expressed it, “Take back thy brief,” or, to use still more
expressive language-
“Monster, away!—I’ve discovered your game:
You want for your papers the use of my name;
But back with disdain. I the document fling ;
The motion I'll make when the quiddam you bring.”
No, Sir, I will not lend myself to these practices. They open the
door to everything disreputable, and my clerk is almost a party to them
when he opens the door to you. Go, Sir, and reflect upon my words,
as Ihave reflected on your actions. “Out, out,” as Lady Macbeth says,
“Out, out, damned spot” on your profession—get out.

ASTONISHING THE BROWNS.

THE JOLLY LONDON BEGGARS.
A CANTATA (A LONG WAY) AFTER BURNs.
WHERE oyster-shells bestrew the court,
Or, piled by urchin-hands in sport,
Compose the mimic grot;
Where cabbage-leaves and turnip-tops,
Potato parings, scraps, and slops,
In open kennel rot;
One night, at twelve, a ragged set,
Sham blind, and maimed, and cripple,
At STUNNING BUGGINs's were met,
To revel, sing, and tipple.
What whizzing and fizzing
Of liver fried, and crow;
Tripe boiling, steak broiling,
Among those shades below !
First, next the fire, a varlet fat
In tatter'd ducks, and oil-skin hat,
And nautical round-jacket,
With . eye, and arm in sling,
And curling locks, and ear with ring,
Kept up a constant racket.
And still he shouted, laughed, and swore,
And swill'd with might and main;
Now hiccup'd forth an oath the more,
Now took another drain.
Thus guzzled, unmuzzled,
The drunken, foul-mouthed knave;
Then hoarsely and coarsely
He bellowed out this stave:—
I am a jovial Tar that ne'er saw a man of war,
Nor have I scratch or scar, yet the lame-dodge I come;
This here patch is all my eye, this bandaged limb a lie,
And thus the trade I ply, of a do and a hum.
I learnt my naval cant from the Surrey playhouse rant,
Oh! the broken sailor's plant bea's the blind or the dumb;
With “Your honour,” from the gents I wheedle out the pence,
On a fraudulent pretence, by a hoax and a hum.
On what I call the “shot,” from the greenhorns’ “locker” got,
I enjoy my pipe and pot, or my jorum of rum;
But “Avast there!” and "Yohol” now and then I find no go,
For a sailor sees at once that I’m a rogue and a hum.
He ceased; the jingling glasses rang
Amid the laughter's roar,
While dingy fists the table bang,
And spill the liquor o'er;
Some noisy members of the gang
Demanded an encore:
A crone, whose gown in shreds did hang,
Did then her ditty pour.
I once had some children, I hardly know when,
But now I go begging, declaring I’ve ten,
With one in my arms all so sickly and shabby;
No wonder I carries that there young babby.
That child I have hired to pass off for my own,
I pinch it and make it to whine and to moan;
It screams like a rat in the claws of atabby,
And so I compassion excites by babby.
Thus my living I get—and a fig for the wrong—
Provided it gives me my glass and my .#
So here's to the health of each soft-hearted gaby,
As pities my crying and squalling babby.
Then next a fellow, simpering meekly,
Outspake, with voice so mild and weakly,
In threadbare black, and white crayat,
And batter'd, broad-brimm’d, old silk hat—
With smirk and leer he thus began
To sing the Serious Poor Young Man.
A lazy humbug I was born,
To earn my bread I held it scorn,
And found it far a betterY.
To act the Serious Poor Young Man.
Sing, hey the Serious Poor Young Man!
Sing, ho the Serious Poor Young Man!
There’s not a scamp in all our clan,
Can match the Serious Poor Young Man
With cedar pencils in my hand,
Or sticks of sealing-wax, Istand:
“Soft Tommies’” hearts Ithus trepan,
The decent, Serious Poor Young Man.
Sing, hey, &c. --
I’m ne'er caught begging in the fact,
So don't infringe the Wagrant Act;
And let the Law do what it can
Agin the Serious Poor Young Man!
Sing, hey, &c.
So sang the Do; and plaudits loud
Burst from the ragamuffin crowd,
Who then, in chorus wild,
Joined, mendicant impostors all,
Tag rag and bobtail, great and small,
In “free-and-easy” tiled.
CHORUS.
A fig for honest occupation!
Beggary’s an easier trade:
Industry is mere starvation,
Mendicancy’s better paid.
Alms for ever—no employment?
Labour is a dreary bore:
Let us idle in enjoyment,
Robbing the deserving poor!

;
D E C OY D U C K I N G S.
THAT respectable and garrulous old “gent,” PEPys, tells us, more
than once, of the decoy for ducks that used to be kept . in St. James's
Park. . The thing still appears to exist, with the slight change, that
instead of a decoy for ducks, the “ornamental water” has become,
under the auspices of the Royal Humane Society, a decoy for duckings.
They have put a very high premium on immersion in frosty weather.
It is not to be expected that poor persons, unused to warm baths, hot
brandy-and-water, and well-aired blankets, should be able to resist the
temptation of a tumble-in that is certain to be followed by the prompt
and liberal supply of such luxurious comforts. It is true they do go
through the ceremony of º up a post and tablet marked
“Dangerous.” But this is like a placard in a pantomime. Enter
Harlequin as a R.H.S. man with a life-preserver-taps the placard with
his ice-pike, and it changes to “Baths, blankets, and brandy-and-
water, to be had within' "
We are writing in very mild weather, or we might shrink from giving
further publicity to the arrangements made by the R.H.S. for the com.
forts of the skating public, leat we might, induce a rush to the soft
parts of the ice, and a run on the accommodation of the tent.
We offer the above transformation to next year's pantomime-makers,
and would only remind the persons who show such a determination to
break the ice, that those who dive after the comforts of the R.H.S. do
not always come up again.
THE CHILD-FARM.
A_JOLLY life the farmer's life, a hearty and a hale,
Who sows the seed and mows the mead, gives beef and bread and ale;
Blest of a hungry world is he—so said a sage of yore—
Who makes two blades of grass to grow where one blade grew before.
A pleasant sight the golden light of a yellow harvest-field,
With rich ripe ears that whisper to the wind of glorious yield;
The laden wains that tell of pains with ample increase crowned,
The vats that ream, the churns that cream, the plenty all around.
But if a hungry world cries praise and honour unto him,
The farmer of the food which feeds the nation's life and limb–
What should a crowded world bestow on the other farmer keen,
Who thins the human crop that grows so over rankly green?
If harvest fields be fair to see, with milky spikes a-row,
There is that other harvest-field where little children grow;
So thankfully our country views the increase of the first,
So with unloving looks and harsh is the last's increase curst.
Not under Heaven's blue, open eye, not fanned by sweet spring gale,
But darkly pent in foºtid dens, stunted, and shrunk, and pale,
Wither those listless little ones, or grow to England's harm,
The fruits of our o'er-fatted mould, crop of the Children's Farm.
A cheerful man the farmer—merry, and kind, and bland,
To Guardians shovelling workhouse seed into his open hand;
The Q'er-gorged Union pours and pours, but the expansive ground
Swallows all up, and to the crop enlarges still its bound.
A constant crop-no stay, no stop—no lying fallow there,
The seed is Want and Wretchedness, the growth Disease, Despair.
Q, that such shoots from human roots at human hands should grow !
O, Limbo-gates with infant deaths inscribed, and tears and woe!
About those naked tables grows Hunger, sharp and shrewd;
In those close-crowded sleeping wards grows Sin, unshamed and rude;
Through those *...*. grows Pestilence, in scant and squalid dress,
And everywhere, rank undergrowth, Disgust, Distrust, Distress.
A crop for Hell to foster—a crop for Heaven to blight—
I see a cloud of infant souls, thick floating up the light;
Innocent souls of infants, by an Almighty arm
Plucked from the tender nurture of an English Children's Farm.
For us, with Laws and Churches, with pulpits and with pens,
And monthly visitations of such unhallowed dens—
Qh well for us and well for ours, methinks, it needs must be,
And, looking on our neighbours' faults, what spotless things are we!
THE PUBLIC VOICE.
THE Public Woice, for the last fortnight, has had a frightful cold. It
has been doing nothing but sneezing and coughing everywhere.
JENNY LIND's songs at Exeter Hall were sung to a running accompani-
ment of catarrhs, and each soft entreaty to “hush” was responded to
by a mighty “Hi-i-i-sh-Ha’’ that sounded exactly as if the big drum
had burst. Really, an intimation ought to be put at the bottom of the
bills: “No Coughs ADMITTED.” A song from the Swedish Nightingale
is one of those things that should not be sneezed at. A sanitary
commission should sit at the doors, and take a vivá voce examination
of all persons who enter; for if the Public Woice, cannot remain quiet
when it is in public, it had better stop at home, and take its gruel by
the fireside, and put its feet in warm water, and º: cured as soon
as possible. The Public Woice, when it has a cold, is very like one
of WERDI's operas—all noise and no melody.
The Spread of Literature.
ALL the papers have got a fit of enlargement. It is lucky the law
has fixed the largest size of a newspaper, or else our present small
houses would never be large enough to read one in.' If our newspapers
keep enlarging at their present rate, London must be enlarged also, to con-
tain them. By the bye, has any one ever attempted to read an enlarged
newspaper completely through P. We really think, if the most diligent
reader began the first thing on Sunday morning, it would take him a
good fortnight before he could possibly get to the end of his long
journey of type 1 -

MISS BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
MISS B.’S ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR. LOWELACE, POLICEMAN.—MISS B.
ON THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.
You must not think, Mr. Punch, that I altogether give myself up to
believe in magdalenism or miasmarism. Still, you’ll allow the eccentric
fluid is not to be denied. Neither is the emetic projection that warns
you of something just afore it comes. We know that people wouldn’t
for a long time believe in Calvanism; and now Calvanism’s over-run
the country, carrying all sorts of messages. These things are facts;
real as taxis. Very well, then. With these things afore us, is it any ||tes
wonder that what is going on in Buckinam Pallis should eccentrically
affect me here in—Street, Pimlico? If ever—as dear DocTOR DAFFy
once said—if ever there was an eccentric subjick in the world,...I am
that subjick. Therefore, not a mouse can stir in Buckinam Pallis, or
any where else in the maybourhood, but directly I feel that mouse all
OVer me.
With this gift, can it be a matter of 'stonishment that I should be
kept wakin night after night with the thoughts of the QUEEN's Speech f
Is it wonderful to them who’ve studied cawsaneffeck that I, knowin
that the QUEEN's Crown-may HER MAJESTY wear it long as the stars
shall twinkel—that the QUEEN's Crown was being ºft up for
Parliment, that I should be more than ever particular in the starch of
my caps?, Why, 'twas, the eccentric fluid, and miasmarism: for the
Pallis, I should say, not but what it’s well known, is in the very thick
of the latter.
Well, Mr. Punch, it was only last night that MR. LoveLACE and I,
taking a cup o' tea and toast with PLATo–as MR. L. observed—that
HER MAJESTY's Speech was, so to say it, laid upon the table. But
first for MR. LovELACE. MR. L. is praps the most gentlemanlike
pelisseman as ever looked blue. I don’t know what I owe to MR.
LoVELACE ; and as true gratitood doesn't care for exact accounts,
I shall never ask: , But you shall judge. Only a week ago, about two
in the mornin' I heard a horrid shoutin in the passage. Puttin my
hand under my pillar, I found my pocket was safe. So, thankful for
all things, I jumped out o' bed, and screamed and sprung my rattle,
which I always carry from house to house along with me. (I wouldn’t
go to bed without that rattle for any money—not for a million stirring.)
Opening the winder, I continued to scream, and rattle “Murder!”
bein earnest, I always cry it. “It isn't murder yet, mum,” said the
manliest tones I ever did hear; “not murder yet, but it might have
been, for you’ve gone to bed with your door open 1. You might have
been killed, and had your pictur in the newspapers.” . I never was in
such a twitter. So I went down stairs, chained and bolted, and back to
bed. . Well, every night after that, for I laid awake to listen, I heard
that faithful pelisseman—about twelve—take hold of the handle, and
shake the door. Sometimes, when in doubt, he'd kick it. And, until
then, Mr. Punch, I’d no ideer that a door might be shook and kicked,
in so many different ways, as to convey so many different 'motions to
the soul. But, I’m convinced, there’s magdalenism in it; magdalenism
and the eccentric fluid.
I hope I've said enuff, Mr. Punch, to account for MR. LovELACE's
persition at my tea-table. If he wasn't born a gentleman, he's picked
it, up wonderful since he came into the world. He has the blackest
whisker and the whitest hand that I
ever see on the same individooal. As
for his years, he’s of the middle age,
takin it for granted that he’ll live till
ninety. Besides this, he has what the

such a sweet touch of meloncoly: he
carries a shadder on his face that
speaks of better times. I’m sure
he’s lost a deal of property; there is
all the rex of it in his countenance.
I don't know how it is; but ev'rybody
as loves him ave int’rest in me.
Sometimes, lookin at him, I think it’s
love; and the next minute, contem-
platin the lines in his brow, I'm sertin
its railways.
But as I was sayin, Mr. Punch, it
was only last night Mr. Love.cº.
and me talked o' the QUEEN's Speech. LovELACE—bein admitted to
my table is, you may suppose, a very diff'rent beein from that low
Chartist, BAGSTER, the milkman—Lovelace is a Tory of the good old
school, which as I larfed and said, is now so old, that all the scholars
must be in, their second childhood—LovELACE is a Tory; but I like
him none the less for that, but all the better; it keeps up wholesome
opposition atween us.
“I wonder,” says MR. LoveLACE, “what our gracious missus is goin
to say to Parliment.”

smile crumple my mouth all over.
“Not an ideer; not the skintillation of a notion,” said LovELACE,

Oi June.
“I think, MR, LovELACE,” says I, “that I know ev'ry sillabulon it.
You'll think this strange; for praps you don't believe in magdalenism
and eccentricity.”
“In both,” said he, “as a pelisseman.”
“Then, listen, MR. LovELACE. And, by the way, what a blessing it
is, MR. LovELACE, that your beat bein’so near the Pallis, the people
about Pimlico are all so well-behaved and honest, you can leave 'em hours
and hours to gather, while you are taking your comfortable toast and
“I feel it,” said LovELACE, and doo, visible doo, sparkled in his
eyes. “I ought to be thankful for my beat. It’s strued with roses,
and with hyson and gunpowder; 'specially the hearth-rug of Miss
BENIMBLE.” (Understand, Mr. Punch, it isn't my pride as writes
this; but only to do justice to the fine mind of the pelisseman.) “But
my dear madam,” said LovELACE, “about the QUEEN’s Speech. Could
you waft me the least flavour of it?”
“In the first place,” said I, feelin' the miasmatic effeck very strong
“in the first place, the QUEEN will say this to the Lords, an
Bishops, and Commons:—“Take your seats, and make yourselves as
comfortable as you can for the Seshun.” Everybody bein’ down, HER
MAJESTY will read, with her own tones o' silver, which changed into
goold wouldn't be half so preshus—will read in this manner:-"I have
the happiness to inform you that I am on the best of terms with all my
forain relashuns. KING LEoPold, my respected uncle (so dear to every
Briton), has, considerin’ all things, the best understandin’ with my
'Chequer. The last letter received from my brother at Coburg, as a
F. of his kind, intentions towards my throne, promises a visit to
ondon, early in the summer.
“‘I am gratified to state that trade is improvin. All provisions have
been in better demand, as is shown by the increased consumption of
toºthpicks,
“‘The Army Estimates will be laid before you. With the best regard
to economie, l’ve cut 'em down to the quick. Thus the prodigal Xtrava-
ganz of wearin' coat-tails is for ever abolished; and all officers are
henceforth ordered to confine themselves—like oysters—to coverins
that are shells. And further, to retrench the reckless expenditure in
the article of pipe-clay, the belts, &c, &c., will receive, for once and all,
a substantial coat of white paint. -
“‘The Woods and Forests will also call for your attention. I am
sorry to inform you that a number of people—who ought to know
better, being of respectable parents, and brought up, as one would
think, for better things—that a number of offenders, Dukes and Lords
among 'em—ſor my maternal bosom º and infest
Woods and Forests, living a disrepitable life, not at all like RoBIN
HooD and LITTLE John, robbing the rich to give to the poor—but vice
versä, and the more shame for 'em. And it is my maternal hope that
you will make all the Dukes who cut underwood, cut sticks.
“‘And to conclude, My Lords and Gentlemen; let me, before I go
home, 'specially impress one thing upon your minds. I ask, it as a
Queen—as a woman. Don't talk so much. , Don't. As the old saying
runs, think twice before you speak once; but—improve upon this-
some of ye think three times, and then-don't speak at all.’”
“My dear Miss BENIMBLE "cried LovELACE. -- -
I jumped up; bein at once browt to myself by the familyarity.
“My dear Miss BENIMBLE, you must be dreamin. This can never
be the Speech of her Gracy.ous Majesty.” . .
“Well, if it isn't,” said I, gettin out of it as well as I could, for I
somehow felt the 'fluence of miasmarism—“if it isn't, it ought to be.”

Old virtuosi, qui'e blasé with opera,
Proof to the GRIsis and LINDs of that day,
Steaming that road, would call “Back her ” and “Stop her,” or
Take headers over, when boa's wouldn’t stay.
Ne'er, e'en in the Panic, was known so galvanic
A run, not ſor sovereigns, but notes, which is rare,
Till this Siren rush, Sir, would put to the blush, Sir,
A JENNY LIND crush, Sir, as poets declare.
But craſ'y Ulysses, as knowing what bliss is
To hear these sweet Misses, invented a way
Oſ enjoying the concert—like one of the wrong sort,
Who, anxious to hear, are reluctant to pay;
To stal his crew's hºaring, he wax de very ear in,
And made them close steer in and venture a stare,
Where, travellers to take in, the Sirens were shaking,
Ard cadences making that ravished the air.
Calling “Avast !” Sir, but lashed to the mast, Sir,
In Lºnbo so fast, Sr, Ulysses was laid,
While the crew wari ated, as I have related,
The more that he prated, the less they obey'd.
Soſrom massacre free, oh he head such a trio,
Allegro / Con brio / delicious and rare;
And he called o'er the sea-flats, a sharp! “You must be flats!”
Till they knew that in three flats 'twas singing they were !
Frºm History banished, the Sirens long vanished,
From won an turn mannish, as foreigners known;
As the practice quite daily is, of I'alian alias,
With singers who fall as prºductions home-grown.

Once bodies they a'e all, now wits they unsettle,
Their music's from ne:al, and gold is their snare.

CASES FOR THE OPINION OF MP. BRIEFLESS.
IT is impossible to give any idea—without
going to a butter-shop and having the paper
weighed—of the immense mass of document.
that are weekly dropped into our letter-bºx
in the shape of Cases for the opinion of
MR. BRIEFLEss. The extraordinary knack
that learned gentleman possesses of hittin.
right nails on their heads—and it require:
a hammer very different from a niny-hanme
to do this—has caused a general feeling i
the profession, that, as a companion t
SMITH's Leading Cases, a series of BRIEF.
LEss's Leading Cases would be “tremen-
= dously useful” and “terrifically popular.”
* We have therefore sent a “spºcial re-
tainer” to our learned, friend—we beg to
say that, like a Baron of old, we have plent,
of “retainers” always waiting in our Hall to run on errands- and MR
BRIEFLEss has consented to furnish, “from time to time,” but no
“at all times,” an opinion upon some nice “moot point,”for the purpose
of adding a new collection of Leading Cases to every lawyer’s library.
The following curious facts have been already laid before him, to
“peruse, advise, and settle;” and we have every confidence in the
regular settler put in by MR. BRIEFLEss upon this occasion.
CASE-On a trial before a Dublin jury, some prisoners were found
guilty, when their counsel rose to object to the reception of the verdict,
on the ground that the law requires a verdict to be found by twelve men,
and that one of the jurors, having a wooden leg, there were not more
than eleven men and three-quarters in the box when the prisoners were
found guilty. The Judge being unable to come to a decision upon the
point, the opinion of Mr. BRIEFLEss is required on the whole matter.
OPINION.—The juryman's wooden leg is certainly a peg on which a
doubt may be hung; though I think, if the juror had not been deficient
of an entire limb, but merely of an eye or a nose, the mather would have
assumed ano' her feature. That the law recognises limbs as an important
part of the judicial system, is, I think, clear, for a “limb of the law” is a
common term; and, moreover, I am disposed to hold, that if the twelve
jurymen had among them only twenty-three legs, there was one member
of the jury absent at the time the verdict was given. -
It may perhaps be urged that as there was a wooden leg in Court at
the time, though not exactly a lignum vitae, it had a kind of footing in
the jury box; tº: then the question will arise, not whither the locus
standi was complete, but whether in fact the prosecu ion must fail,
from not having an additional leg to stand upon. It is a great privi-
lege of accused persons, that their cases should be judged of by a jury,
“to the best of their understanding.” But Ithink the prisoners here
cannot have had the benefit of this beautiful provision; for when here
was a juryman in the box, the best of whose understanding consisted
of a wooden leg, Ithink the interests ºf justice demand some rel-Ka-
tion, though it is difficult, in a case like this, to say where the shoe
pinches. If I may reason from analogy—and why my l motº-I
should say the deficient leg cu's away the ground from under the
prosecution, because it is clear enough that when a prisºner's fałe is
in the hands of a jury, there must be twenty-four hands to make the
jury complete; and, by a parity of reasoning, where should be twenty-
tour feet where there are twenty-four hands; and if we are to measure
out justice by one uniform twenty-ſour ſoot rule, the exact complement
of legs must be indispensable.
There is some difficulty presen's itself infhe consideration whether
|the juryman should have been challenged before he went into the box;
but I am disposed to think that challenging a man with a wooden leg
is cowardly, and repugnant to the British character. The objection to
an absent limb need not be taken in lim(b)ine, at least if my view is
the right one. And I must on the whole case give it as my distinct
opinion that the verdict cannot stand, because one of the jurymen was
almost in the same predicament, or at all events he was unable to take
with perfect ease such steps as he may have thought proper; and, as
a juryman must not have his hands in any way tied, I think, a ſortiori,
he should not have his legs in the smallest degree fettered.

ST. STEPHEN'S SCHOOL, WESTMINSTER.
Mr. Punch (the Principal) begs to inform his
young political friends, that the period for
their re-assembling has been fixed for Thurs-
day next, the 1st of February, when he
expects them all to be in their places at the
appointed hour. • . "
e will take an early opportunity of exa-
mining them in their holiday work, when he
sº trusts he will find that they have not spent
the period of the vacation in mere amusement
or sheer idleness. ... .
A rigid system will in future be adopted,
under the superintendence of Mr. Punch, who
has seen with regret that St. Stephen's has
been looked upon hitherto as a school adapted
more for “liberal professions” than for
practical utility.
The study of figures has been grievously neglected;, and, though
MASTER HUME has shown laudable industry in this useful branch, and
has attained an honourable proficiency, it has been too much the custom
to underrate such attainments as he has exhibited. Mr. Punch has
therefore resolved to institute a very sharp course of arithmetic, with
a view to the keeping of accounts, and MASTER RICHARD COBDEN, who
has lately shown great diligence in this respect, will be called upon to
act as Monitor. It is a lamentable fact that, MASTERs, Goui BURN,
BARING, and others, who have been at the head of their class in
matters of figures, have gone very little beyond Addition as applied to
outlay, Multiplication as applied to taxes, Division as applied to offices,
and Subtraction as applied to the public money, while they have shown
no aptitude for the higher and more useful rules of arithmetic, such as
those which teach the art of †. at the roots of thirgs, or balancing
and proportioning income and expenditure.
Though oratory is to some extent an agreeable and useful art, Mr.
Punch cannot but feel that by making every day a speech day, too
much time is wasted on this branch of the studies of St. Stephen's
School, particularly when he perceives how sadly deficient some of the
speakers are in their English composition. The written exercises, or
Acts, which emanate from the school, are absolutely disgraceful, no less
from their want of grammar than their want of sense; and Mr. Punch
thinks it would be much more creditable to those of his young friends
who are fond of showing off in set speeches, if they would employ
themselves in correcting the written exercises of the school, by the
rules of LINDLEY MURRAY, or some other grammarian.
Mr. Punch has remarked with pain, that Procrastination is one of
the greatest faults of his young friends, who idle their time away in
talking or playing during the best part of the term allotted to their
studies, and, by leaving everything to the last, do nothing well, but are
in a scramble and hurry to get their work done before the time for
breaking up comes round again. In the hope of correcting this serious
ſault, Mr. Punch will give a prize to the introducer of the Bill that shall
first pass into an Act;, and, to prevent the evil of talking, a prize will
also be given to him who shall have spoken the fewest words between
the 1st of February and the Easter holidays.
. MASTER, CHISHOLM, ANSTEY, who has received a bad mark for
inveterate talking, will, it is to be hoped, endeavour to earn a good
mark in the ensuing half year, by conducting himself in a silent and
orderly manner.
MASTER BENJAMIN DISRAELI, who has frequently had a lesson for
bullying the other boys, and particularly for his spiteful conduct to that
generally quiet boy MASTER PEEL, will be severely chastised, if he
continues to interrupt the general business of the school by his
annoying practices.
MASTER, RUSSELL, and the other head boys of the school, were
treated with great indulgence last year; but they must work very hard
if they do not wish to lose their places, as there are a great many other
boys, some of whom are very clever and industrious, who will do their
utmost to get into the top form of St. Stephen's.
The following subjects for essays and tasks are open to the whole
school, and valuable prizes will be awarded to the most successful
competitors:– ...
. Reduce the military and naval expenditure to that of 1835, without
impairing the efficiency of the United Service.
Work out the problem of which Ireland furnishes the data.
There being abundance in the country for all, solve the question
how enough may be given, to everybody without taking anything from
anybody, but rather by adding something to the store of those who
seem at present to monopolise everything.
N.B.-Notwithstanding the apparent difficulty of this task, it is to be
worked out, if the Fº les upon which it is to be done were
thoroughly understood; and the wealthy, as well as the poor, would be
the richer by applying them.
In conclusion, Mr. Punch has only to say, that he will meet his young
friends of St. Stephen's School with the kindest disposition to assist
them in their studies, to give praise where it is due, and to reward
merit; but he nevertheless must add, that he has a quantity of rods in
pickle for those who may deserve chastisement.
L. S. D. AT LEOMINSTER.
| Sir E. B. Lyttos has bidden characteristic
|farewell to the contemplative men of Leominster.
| He has in a manner tickled their noses with a
bank-note, showing them that he perfectly
understands their political wants; and, with such
understanding, has a like determination not to
meet them. In a word, SIR Edward has buttoned
up his pockets, and taken his hat. He will not
bribe; he will not buy the men of Leominster, and
Child (screams and without any stops). “HANNER MARIA YER TIREsome
USSEY COME OUT OF THE Road Do WITH YER Little BROTHER DID YER WANT TO BE Runned
over. By omnibustEs AND KILLED DEAD oh DEAR oh DEAR who'd Be A NUss?”
they–the swine with voices—must carry their
own pig's-meat to another market. SIR Edward
is charmingly ingenuous. He says—
“I know of nothing, within my power, to prevent the
votes separating themselves from the inclinations, and
flying off at the last hour in an utterly opposite direction.”
That is, SIR Edward cannot couple the votes and
the electors:
“Those sweet birds that fly together,
Link'd with a golden hook-and-eye.”
He therefore leaves them
“With a profound sense of inadequacy to solve the
doubts of the more cautious deliberators whom this fare-
well may find still stretched on the rack of consc.entious
euspense.”
Ha, SIR Epward | There is an exquisite edge
to this; it is keen enough to cut through a rhino-
ceros, but not through the hide of him who comes
to sell himself in the market-place.

“ will take a few ndditional pupi’s at 40 guineas, provided they be gentlemen. To
savc trouble, none but gen, leucin can be treated with.”
We hardly know how to take this. We presume, however, that what
the Principal means, is this. . He has already a certain number of
“vulgar little boys,” at 70 guineas each; but in older to give the
general vulgarity of his school a smack, an odour of higher life, he
will take a few gentlemen at the lower rate, in each case striking
thirty guineas off. Thus, gentility is its own reward. Vulgarity pays
the full penalty for its coast mess: now, the true genileman save;
thirty guineas a year on the strength of his refi ement. The additional
pupils—the “gentlemen”—may be considered as the sprigs of lavender,
thrown in to sweeten the homely dowlas and coarse brown holland.
NEW TITLES FOR REGIMENTS.
It is proposed (by Mr. Punch) to conſer new tilles upon certain
regiments, to be borne by them until a due economy shall have been
effected in our Military Estimates. For instance, it is suggested that
the Horse Guards shall, till then, be called the Heavy Expensives; the
1st Dagoons the Costlies; and the Grenadiers the Extravagants; while
The Household Troops generally shall be styled the Ruination Brig. de.
Our armaments having been placed on a satisfactory footing, a further
charge may be made in our regimental momenclature, and instead of
Light Divisions we may have Lºrge Subtractions and Great Reduc’ions
among the various corps. The 10 h Reasonables, the llth Moderates,
the Clipped Greys, the Docked Buffs, the Thriſty Hussars, the Cheap
Riſles, the Frugal Fusiliers, and the Retrenched Lancer. would be
names no less euphonious than pleasingly significant. The crack
regiments,” by way of a well-merited complinent, may be denominated
Cobden's Unadorned, and Joseph HUME's Own; otherwise, the Horse
and Foot Indispensables.

NUTS FOR GENERAL NAPIER,
“SIR WILLIAM,
... ."You have lately invited attention to an assortment of articles,
written in defence of the character of the British Officer, and particu-
larly of the Clothing Colonel, against the charge of untradesman-like
conduct, brought against it by the Liverpool. Financial Association.
There is, perhaps, something in what you say for your cloth, and for
those who have the cutting of it out. But, dear SfR WILLIAM, may I
venture to observe that you come it a little too strong? Your style is
spicy-really, you, are quite a dealer in vinegar, mustard, and pepper.
But in respect of dignity, its quality is below par; excuse me: decidedly
inferior. The fiverpoºl parties, twit your firm with cabbage, and you
retort by allusions to devil's dust... Is this quite worthy of a distin-
guished military gent? Isn't it, Sir, more like a small spirit-merchant
squabbling with a chandler, and when reproached with watering his
rum, replying by the demand of “Who sanded his sugar P’
... “The other day, the Public received by the Times a favour of yours,
in which you put the following question:-
“‘But have those financial reformers who honestly seek the public good considered
how the Tract 4 has dishonourably involved them in slanders, conveying insults, the
least of which, offered by one of them personally, would draw down instant chas-
tisement where age and wounds had left the insulted officer power to inflict it º'
“I always thought you Army gents were rather hasty, but hardly
fancied that you were quite so handy with your canes and horsewhips
as this. Are you aware, Sir, that such a mode of resenting an affront
is taking the law into your own hands, and breaking the QUEEN’s
eace?, Do you know that you would be charged £5 for it, at the
owest figure, at any police office P To be sure—taking the salaries of
general officers at an .*.*.*.* may say that expense is
no object—but don't you think, now, that it is better, as well as cheaper,
in every way more reasonable, to treat a calumny with silent contempt,
or simple denial? Among you nobs I know it is a custom to maintain
your honour by calling the abusive party out; but is it, not a superior
plan to challenge inspection of your accounts, and to defy competition
in your mode of doing business? Take m advice, and content yourself
with proving that your shop supplies goods better and cheaper than any
other house in the trade. If you show temper, you will only create an
impression that you feel your cause to be queer, and thus increase the
agitation for reſorming your army tailors' bills, which must end in
cooking your Colonel's goose.

THE Secretaryship to the Board of Control was recently vacant, and

THE COURT-THE PULPIT_THE STAGE.
THE intense interest shown by the QUEEN in the fate of the British
Drama—ſor it is now an allowed truth, that without royal patronage
plays and players are nought— has awakened the zeal of the pulpit.
F. arſul that the example set at Windsor should be followed throughout
society, and that not only the nobility and gentry, but even the illiterate
vulgar should rush to the play house, Doctor DREw, of Christchurch,
B last, has delivered himself of “Forty-Eight Tuoughts on the Drama,
Stage, Players, and Ama'eurs.”
At the next levee the Doc' or will endeavour to lay the work at the
feet of Victor IA. Of the “Fºr v-Eight Thoughts” we may take some
three or ſour: they will be a suffic ent sample; for all have a family
likeness, as like as ass’s ears to ears of ass. And first—of the Drama
as applicable to woman :-
“Womankind is degraded by the licentious mode in which the sex is often
defined, illustrated, and nsulted in the Drama; and it is particularly incumbent
on the sex to viuditate their rights and uhe proprieties due to then, by discounte-
nancing the Drama.”
This is very true. Desdemona, for instance, is not only insulted, but
stabbed and smothered. We are convinced of it: this horrid event must
have been unknown to the Court at Windsor; otherwise ShakspeaRE
would never have been permitted, not even for an hour, to lodge here.
“Many persons, especially young pºrsons, have made shipwreck of reputation,
health, and piety, dati-g their ruin from the hour when they were induced to visit
the theat: e.”
And yet the little Princrs and Princessrs—see that terrible Court
Circular—sst upon the dais in the RuBBN's Room; and did not retire
to their night-gowns and night-caps until nine ! What will become of
'em P Andimow of players:–
“Mavis not be believed that many, who have been ensnared into this soul-de-
stroying profession, wou d'gladly be relieved from it, if away of escape were given f"
We have made it our business to solre this question. We have sent
to all the Lºndon theatres a tabular form, to be duly filled up, and the
result is—so grievºus do many of the players find their horrid trade
so willimely would they escape from it—that not less than one hundre
ac'ors are willing to reire upon full salaries for life; only some half-
çozen or so (whose names it is not necessary to give) further stipulate
for apartments at Hampton Court, with the run of the royal stables.
If, however, the Rev. Da. DREw pour merely a small phial of wrath
upon the he d of the professed player, he cracks a full quart bottle on
the crown of the amateur:-
“The AmArena is sometimes' encourared to strut his hour upon the stage” under
the abused name of cranity: but Taue chanity d sowns tºe aliance. True
charity is love to the sºuls of men— rue chanity is love to the hoºies of men, and
the stage is a N EN EMv to Body AND soul! True chanity can have no connexion
with aught, the origin of which is blemished by things mean or sensual.”
This may be very true. But how can Doctor DREW vouch for its
verity ? I) es he know True Charity P Has he the honour of even a
bowing acquain'arce with the Virtue? “The PRINCE REGExt says he
knows you,” said someh dy to Noathcote. “Nonsense!” growl d
Northcote, “’twas only his brag.” Now Doctor DREw may, in the
affair of Charity, have his lit le brag.
There is no dount, however, that the Doctor means virtuously,
nobly. Dreading the ex-mple set at Windsor, he believes that the
Aris'ocracy of England will nightly crowd our theatres, as inevitably
carrying after them the vulgar, as the lordly lion carries after him his
tail. As without Court influence the Drama was, from the first,
nothing; so without it, in nothing it must end. It is a fact that, oddly
enough, has escaped the vigilance of CHARLEs Knight and Payne
Collier, that ShakspeaRE was, in very truth, never born. No.: he
was brought into the world by Act of Parliament. It was the will of
Mrjesty that Shakspeans should exist for the delectation of the
Court, and he lived accordingly. Thus, for aught we know to the
contrary, there may be, at the present time, a Bill already drawn for the
better encouragement of the Drama, by taking the earlies' measures
to in-ure the protection of half-a-dºzen ſlrst-rate dramatists, with actors
and acresses to follow. If this can be done by Act of Parliament,
why, th n we are willing to acknowledge the good conſerred upon the
Art by the patronage at Windsor.
UNN At URAL LITIGATION.
A case occurred the other day in the Court of Common Pleas,
reported as “Tº e DEAN AND Chaptea of Ely versus Cash.” We
never heard of a Dean and Chaper having any objection to Cash before.
This law-sui, can only be a lover's quarrel.

menced of dressing

of the figurines
which profess to

their way to the

We are
glad to find that
canine instead of human puppies are in future to be turned into blocks
for the tailor and the miſſirer. We shall expect shortly to see the usual
monthly rubbish, in the Magazines of Fashion, about ball-dresses and
walking-dresses for ladies and gentlemen, replaced by some direcions
for the cºstume of poor les, greyhounds, and terriers. We may recom-
mend at once, that all does should adopt muslin for summer wear, and
during the dog-days watered silk, to prevent the necessity for recurrinz
to shots in the very hot weather. We have seen several dogs en toilette
in Regent Street lately, and we expect, before the spring is over, a
regular canine Longchamns will be established. Pe', dºgs wrºr their
dresses very much décolleté, and we have seen some with sleeves as gigot,
which, so far from having a becoming effect, give the dogs, a very
sheepish appearance.
Latest Fashions-in-Simokes
A Smoke Nuisance Cºmmittee has lately brensitting on the chim-
nevs at Birmingham. We should think the Cºmmittee mus' be like
Irish snuff completely high-dried hy this time. We do not exactly know
what they intend doing with the smoke, to prevent its bring a nuisanor,
but we have heard of a hair-dresser in the town having undertaken to
keep the smoke “gracefully called,” accordingto-sample in the sons of
the Woodpecker. This will imprºve tile-apprarance of lie smoke, at all
events; and, as the look of the thing goes some way in matters of
nuisance, the arrangement may be satisfactory.
LE TACITE D'AUJOTRD’aui.
ONE of Napoleon's great merits was, that he spoke very little, bu%
always to the point. Louis NAPOLeon, however, goes nuch ſurther,
for he never speaks at all. This is the only point in which the nephew
has as yet surpassed the uncle—at least, the only point worth speaking
about.

OUR COURTS OF LAW.
No. II.--THE PALACE COURT REVISITED. .
THE world will be a little surprised to find such a place as the Palace
Court in the same category as Yarrow; for, who would think that the
formerstood any chance of being voluntarily “revisited?”, Punch has,
however, been “at it º for it is quite impossible to be nice when
scavenging has to be done; and this legal sewer must be thoroughly
explored before it can be cleared out, and measures taken to prevent the
disappearance of the public money down its manifold gullyholes:
It is customary for every Court to have its published book of
ractice, as a guide to the public through the straits of the law; but the
alace Court allows no such chart to be issued, preferring that the
legal wanderer should flounder about among its shoals and quicksands,
founder on its reefs, or split upon its rocks, in order that he may
become an easy prey to those who have the special privilege of piracy
in the neighbourhood. No other chart of the perilous region is to be
had, but that which is afforded when the danger has been all incurred,
and when the track traversed is laid down in the map presented by
the attorney’s bill—a sort of map that exemplifies longitude by testing
that of the victim's purse, and latitude by the excessive amount of
that quality which the Court and its myrmidons have allowed them-
selves. No Itinerary of the dangerous voyage is to be met with
until the voyage itself has been made; and the pilgrim of law only
knows what he has gone through, when he is called upon to pay the
expenses of his journey. -

the cave of the Forty Thieves, must be entered by those only who are
quite in the dark as to where they are going to... If the visit were to be
made with one's eyes open, none would have the folly or the courage
to attempt the rash enterprise. .
Though the Palace Court is irrevocably doomed, the spoil is still an
object of competition and even of quarrel among the participators in the
produce, just as the stirring up of foul and stagnant water causes the
occupants of the corrupt mass to turn against each other in that lively
style which has been represented to us by the power of the solar
microscope. The Palace Court officials are fighting about the pro-

thonotary's place, which is at all events, thoroughly occupied by that
functionary, whose “fulness”—the result of reading, no doubt-has
been alluded to in a former article.
We unhesitatingly declare that if the worthy prothonotary is ousted
from his ledge, the Court will lose full half its weight, and three
quarters of its dignity. An application has been made for a mandamus
to compel him to say how he occupies his present place; and cer-
tainly, when we look at the matter º we think the question
does arise, not how the respectable prothonotary fills his place, but how
he got into it. No one can for a moment raise a question as to capacity,
at least, if there is any affinity between capacity and capaciousness.
| There can be no exercise of an undue influence upon this excellent
officer; for, to say nothing of his admitted integrity, you have only to
look at him to be convinced that there would be no getting round
him in his official position. The acting prothonotary is, it seems,
only a deputy for some higher dignitary, who happens to be a Colonel
in the Army, as if such an onslaught as the Palace Court makes on
the public pocket should have a soldier at the head of it.
We do not wonder at one of the superior officers of the place
being military, when the underlings are scarcely civil, and the whole
practice is one of warfare on the purses of the suitors in general.
“Upon them charge!” is the great watchword that resounds from
the whole rank and file of the Palace Court. Amongst the military
reductions that are now talked about, we trust that the abolition of
this rifle corps will not be forgotten. The public voice has distinctly
cried out, “Up, Punch, and at 'em!”—so we are “up,” and will be
“at 'em.” till there is not an atom left of them.

HUMOURS OF THE BOARD OF ORDNANCE.
FROM a statement of “EMERITUs” in the Times, it appears that the
mode of doing business at the Board of Ordnance very closely resembles
that of creating amusement at Astley's Theatre. When a washing-shed,
an exercise-ground, a burial-place, a racket-court, or a school-room is
required to §: constructed, drained, fenced in, run up, or erected, and
information to that effect reaches the Government, the Secretary-at-
War tells the Chancellor of the Exchequer to tell the Board of Qrdnance
to tell the Inspector-General of Fortifications to tell the Engineer
Officer incommand to tell the Clerk of the Works to carry the necessary
proceeding into execution. Surely this very funny method of trans-
mitting an order must have been borrowed from Messrs. Clown an
WIDDIcombe. --

A NICE opening FOR AN ACTIVE YOUNG MAN.
A FREnch paper says that Louis-NAPOLEoN receives not less than
2500 letters every day. Bravo! The Hero of Strasburg has found at
last his real cachet degénie. If good for nothing else, the Prince is not
a bad hand, at all events, as President of the Republic of Letters!
A FOOL’s ERRAND.
SoMEBody who says he has invented a Tooth-powder, advertises to
sell it for £15, because he has “not time to carry it out.” Surely,
while there is a Parcels Delivery Company or even a Post-office in
existence, there is no occasion for any one to relinquish a profitable
tooth-powder, on account of the difficulty of “carrying it out.” It is
to be hoped that whoever buys it will not find more of the “take in?”
than of the “carrying out” in the bargain.

PARIS REVISITED.
BY AN OLD PARIS MAN.
ſº | EVERED PUNCH,-When your
\\ |\ \\
WJ
multitudinous readers are put
in possession of this confiden-
tial note, Paris will be a week
\\ older; and who knows what
|\ may *Nº. in that time?—
| Louis-NAPOLEoN may be Em-
eror, or Louis-BLANC may be
ing, or the Revolution that
was to have broken out last
Monday may be performed on
the next;-meanwhile, permit
me, Sir, to lay at your feet the
few brief observations which I
have made during a twenty-
four hours residence in this
ancient and once jovial place.
“It was on the stroke of
eleven at night, Sir, on Wed-
nesday, the 31st of January,
that a traveller might have
been perceived plunging ra-
pidly through the shingles of
Dover, towards a boat which
lay in waiting there, to bear
him and other exiles to a
steamer which lay in the offing,
her slim black hull scarcely
visible in the mists of night,
through which her lights, of a
green and ruby colour, burned
brilliantly. he moon was
looking out on the fair and
tranquil scene, the stars were twinkling in a friendly manner, the
ancient cliffs of Albion loomed out of the distant grey. But few lights
twinkled in the deserted houses of the terraces along the beach. , The
bathing-machines were gone to roost. There was scarce a º: On
the sluggish wave, as the boat with The Traveller on board, went
griding over the shingle, and we pulled to the ship. In fact; waters
of Putney were not more calm than those of the Channel, and the night
was as mild as a novel by the last lady of fashion.
“Having paid a shilling for the accommodation of the boat, The
Traveller stept on board the deck of the famous steamer Wivid, com-
manded by the intrepid and polite CAPTAIN SMITHETT; and the Mails
presently coming in in their boat with the light at its bows, away went
the Wirid at the rate of seventeen miles an hour, and we were off Calais
almost before the second cigar was smoked, or we had had near time
enough to think of those beloved beings whom we left behind.
“Sir, there was not water enough in the Calais harbour—so a bawling
pilot swore, who came up to us in his lugger; and as she came plunging
and bumping against the side of the Wirid, CAPTAIN SMITHETT caused
the mail-bags first, and afterwards the passengers, to be pitched into her,
and we all rolled about amongst the ropes and spars on deck, in the
midst of the most infernal bawling and yelling from the crew of French-
men, whose howls and contortions, as they got their sail up, and other-
wise manoeuvred the vessel, could be equalled by men of no other nation.
Some of us were indignant at being called upon to pay three francs for
a ride of a mile in this vessel, and declared we would write to the Times;
but there was One Traveller who had not heard that noise of Frenchmen
for four years, and their noise was to his soul as the music of bygone
years. That Man, Sir, is perpetually finding something ludicrous in
what is, melancholy, and when he is most miserable is always most
especially jocular.
“Sir, it was the first night of the new Postal arrangement, by which
the Mails are made to go from Calais and not from Boulogne, as here-
tofore. Our goods were whisked through the Custom House with a
rapidity and a courtesy highly creditable to Frenchmen, and an enthu-
siastic omnibus driver, lashing his horses furiously, and urging them
forward with shrieks and howls, brought us to the St. Pierre Station of
the Railway, where we took our places in the train. 'Twas two in the
bleak winter's morn. The engine whistled—the train set forth—we
plunged into the country, away, away, away!
“At eleven o'clock, Sir, we dashed into the enceinte of the forts that
guard the metropolis from foreign invasion, and a few minutes after-
yards we were in that dear old Paris that One amongst us had not seen
for four years.
“How is the old place : How does it look?, I should be glad to
know is the nightingale singing there yet?—do the roses still bloom by
the calm Bendemeer: Have we not all a right to be sentimental when
we revisit the haunts of our youth, and to come forward, like the
Count in the opera, as soon as the whips have ceased, cracking
and sing “Cari luogif" Living constantly with your children an
the beloved and respectable Mrs. Punch, you don’t see how
JACKY and ToMMY grow, and how old-(for the truth must out, and
she is by no means improved in looks)—how old and plain your dear
lady has become. So thought I, as I once more caught sight of my
beloved LUTETIA, and trembled to see whether years had affected her.
“Sir, the first thing I saw on entering the Station, was that it was
crammed with soldiers—little soldiers, with red breeches and grey
capotes, with little caps, bristling with uncommonly fierce beards, large
hairy tufts (those of the carroty hue most warlike and remarkable), that
looked as if worn in bravado, as by the American warriors, and growin
there convenient to cut their heads off if you could. These bearde
ones occupied the whole place; arms were piled in the great halls of the
Debarcadère: some fatigued braves were asleep in the straw, pots were
cooking, drums were drubbing, officers and non-commissioned officers
bustling about. Some of us had qualms, and faintly asked, was the
Revolution begun? ‘No,' the omnibus conductors said, la hing,
“everything was as quiet as might be: ' and we got into their vehicles
and drove away. Everything was quiet. . Only, Sir, when you go to a
friend's house for a quiet, dinner, and before he lets you into his door,
he puts his head and a blunderbuss out of window and asks, “Who is
there?'-of course, some nervous persons may be excused for feeling
a little dashed. - -
"Sir, the omnibus drove rapidly to the hotel whence this is written,
with a very scanty cargo of passengers. We hardly had any in, the
Railway; we did not seem to take º any on the line. Nothing
seemed to be moving on the road, or at least, the º: not caring to
do so. In the streets there was not much more life. What has
become of the people who used to walk here 2–of the stalls, and the
carts, and the crowds about the wine-shops, and the loungers, and the
gries of the busy throng? Something has stricken the place. Nobody
is about:, or perhaps, there is a review, or a grand fête somewhere
. calls the people away as we are passing through a deserted
quarter.
“As soon as I was dressed, I walked into the town through the
ancient and familiar arcades of the Rue Castiglione and so forth., The
shops along the Rue de Rivoli are dreary and shabby beyond belief.
There was nobody walking in the Tuileries. The palace, that used to
look so splendid in former days, stretches out its great gaunt wings, and
looks dismally battered and bankrupt. In the Carrousel there were more
troops, with drumming, and trumpeting, and artillery. , Troops are
perpetually passing. . Just now I saw part of a regiment of Mobiles
marching outward with a º: of the line. Squads of the young
Mobiles are everywhere in the streets, pale, debauched, daring-looking
little lads; one looks, at them with curiosity and interest, as one
thinks that those beardless sº fellows have dashed over barricades,
and do not care for death or devil. -
“I worked my way to the Palais Royal, where I have been any time
since 1814; and oh, Mr Punch, what a change was there! I can't tell
you how dreary it looks, that once cheerfullest garden in the world:
The roses do not bloom there any more; or the nightingales sing...All
the song is gone, and the flowers have withered. Sir, you recollect
those shops where the beautiful dressing-gowns used to hang out, more
splendid and gorgeous than any tulips, I am sure. You remember that
wonderful bonnet-shop at the corner of the Galerie Vitrée, where there
were all sorts of miraculous caps and hats; bonnets with the loveliest
wreaths of spring twined round them: bonnets with the most ravishing
plumes of marabous, ostriches, and birds of paradise.
“Once in their bows,
Birds of rare plume
Sate in their bloom,”
as an elegant poet of your own sings—they are all gone, Sir; the birds
are flown, the very cages are shut up, and many of them to let—the
Palais Royal is no more than a shabby bazaar. Shutters are up in
many of the shops—you see nobody buying in the others—soldiers and
a few passengers go about staring at the faded ornaments in the win-
dows and the great blank Daguerreotype pictures, which line the walls
as dismal as death. There is nobody there: there are not even English
eople walking about, and staring with their hands in their pockets.
#. ruin begun, then, and is Paris f". after Rome, Carthage, Pal-
myra, Russell Square, Kilkenny, and other famous capitals? In the
glass galleries there were not a dozen loungers, and the line of shops
facing the Palais Royal proper is closed down the whole line.
“As for the square ºthe palace itself, which always used to look so
cheerful—where there used to be, you remember, piles of comfortable
wood, giving ideas of warmth and hospitality in the splendid rooms
within-that too is, to the last degree, shabby and forlorn. I saw
soldiers looking out of the windows, and more, a couple of thousands of
them, Ishould say, were in the court. Many of them with their coats off,
and showing very dingy under-vestments, were cooking about the court;
there they formed in squads about the square, without their arms, in their
slouching grey coats; and, drums and bugles beginning to make a noise,
a small crowd of blackguards and children issued somehow from some of
the dark recesses and black passages about the place, and formed a sort |

of audience for the unromantic military spectacle. A tree of Liberty is
planted in the square: the first I have seen, and the most dismal and
beggarly emblem I ever set eyes, on. A lean poplar, with scarce
any branches, a wretched, furcated pole with some miserable rags of
faded cotton, and, it may be, other fetishes dangling from it here and
there... O Liberty. What the deuce has this poplar or those rags to
d5 with you ? -
“My sheet is full—the post hour migh; but I have one word of
rathera cheerful and consolatory nature to say after all this despondency.
Sir, I happened in my walk, and from a sense ºf duty, just to look in at
the windows of CHEveT's, WEFour’s, and the Trois Frères. The show
at all is very satisfactory indeed. The game looked very handsome at
CHEVET's, and the turbots, and pâtés uncommonly fine. I never saw
finer looking trouſles than those in the baskets in WEFOUR's window;
and the display of fruit at the Frères would make an anchorite's mouth
water. More of this, however, anon. There are some subjects that are
not to be treated in a trifling manner by your obedient servant and
| contributor,
“Folkston E CANTERBURY.”
A JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD.
ºf
HICH is the way to Pompeii?” we inquired
in Leicester Square. “You turn, Sir,
to the right, then to the left, go down
a small passage, and when you come to
a large door-mat, that is Pompeii.”
e followed these simple directions,
and found ourselves, in less time than
Houdi N does one of his wonderful
tricks, in the centre of Pompeii—that
mummy of a city, which has only lately
been unrolled to the antiquarian gaze
of man. It took us about five minutes
from the Sablonière Hotel to leap more
than 1500 years back into the past.
No wishing-cap could have done it
quicker.
It is curious to have the roof of an
- entire city liſted off, as if it were
nothing more than apété de foie gras. You have bare walls—every
interior exposed—the most sacred recesses disclosed-temples, theatres,
ladies' boudoirs, all thrown “open from morning till dusk.” Asmodeus
could barely have done the thing better.
The Romans must have had a pleasant time of it. All their rooms are
as richly decorated as if CRACE or Cicf:RI had worked upon them . It
is true their apartments are rather small; but what matter? They had
baths and theatres, and amphitheatres
with wild beasts and men—every living
inducement to tempt them abroad.
Their city is a pretty play-ground,
abounding in amusements. It looks
snug and comfortable, even in its pre-
sent desolation. Poverty seems to
have run away frightened from the
F.; and the only visible taste of
abour is here and there the vine-leaf.
We can imagine when the thunder of
Vesuvius, was first heard, that the
inhabitants were too lazy to move, or
too jolly to take heed of the warning.
A beautiful atmosphere of luxury still
hangs over the place, and we can fancy
old DIoMEDE, when told of the fearful
eruption, took no more notice of the
matter than quietly, turning round on
his couch, and bidding his slave “to
run for the engines.”. By the bye, the Fire Offices of that period must
have lost tremendously; though Pompeii, we should say, must have
been largely insured in the Phoenix, as the greater part of the city has
already risen from its ashes.
We advise all persons who do not mind going backwards a little—
and ladies do not mind it at all when they arrive at a certain age—to
visit Pompeii. The journey is very short, and the expense quite ridi-
culous. Leicester Square is the utmost boundary, and a shilling is the
only passport required to cross it. By following the directions we
have given above, they will be introduced, at a moment's notice, to that
great “City of the Dead,” which, like a jar of filberts, has been pre-
served so long, by being kept under the ground. It is the greatest
mut which scholars and persons of taste could possibly crack, before or
after dinner. -
Travelling has indeed become cheap! MR. BURFoRD's Panorama is
like the Messageries Royales of Paris, or the Docks of London; you
can go to almost any part of the world you please, by paying for it:
And as for expedition, a railroad
is slow by the side of it. Bal-
looning is nothing to it. A flight
of stairs is all that divides one
capital from another. A room
is a continent. A garret fre-
quently comprises a chain of
mountains; and we have seen in
a cupboard no bigger than a
china-closet, such views of Hong
Kong and the Celestial Empire,
as would make the most thrifty
housewife break with envy, every
plate of the Willow pattern she
had in the house. At present
you can visit Pompeii, Vienna,
and Paris, all three in less than
an hour. From the Past you fly to the Present; and, such is MR.
BURFoRD's rapidity of travelling, we should not wonder that he will
be giving us shortly a view of California as it will be a twelvemonth
hence; or a map of London as it ought to be when all the long-talked-
of sanitary, and architectural improvements are carried into effect.
Decidedly the Panorama is Travelling made Easy, and no turnpikes.
BURFoRD is a pictorial CAPTAIN Cook, and we doubt if there is
a spot on the entire globe that he has not already scoured with his
H.; Of the power of that brush we must not speak; for, to
e properly felt, the reader must have it in his eye; but this, much we
can say, that when last we were at Pompeii, the distance lent such
wonderful enchantment to the view, that we saw a lady use an opera-
glass to enable her to take in the Apennines; and yet those very
Apennines could not have been the length of her parasol from the tip
of her beautiful nose! Can the force of painting—or praise either—
any further go? And Echo, who always answers when politely spoken
to, exclaims in the affirmative, “No!”
FCM PEII
BOTTLED ETHICS.
We are glad to see a very practical character º: in the last
batch of Cambridge Examination Papers. In one we find the questicn—
“II. On what principle is the guilt of a crime committed by a drunken person to
be estimated Suppose a man half-drunk, and show on this principle in what
degree he is responsible.”
This is indeed a question involving very curious considerations, and
) subject, in his answer to the question:–
reminds us of FIELDING's discussion between Jonathan hºld and the
Ordinary of Newgate, on the various degrees of sinfulness implied in
| getting muzzy on port and on punch. .. -
The answers to the question have delighted the Examiners, from the
thorough knowledge they display of the nice degrees which divide
the stages of intoxication—“sprung,” “slued,” “left to yourself.”
“glorious,” “roaring-drunk,” “blazing drunk,” and so round again
to “sick,” “seedy,” and “soda-waterish.” -
One of the jà Examinees takes this very profound view of the
“Much depends on the ‘lush. Gin, brandy, and rum produce a
spirituous excitement, and, are likely to lead to heresies in matters
spiritual; many “goes” will lead a man great lengths in matters of
opinion; and a man beside himself with ‘hot, with’, may become a
ew-man, though he can hardly be a Rationalist. Under these circum-
stances a man's private judgment is suspended, and he is not responsible
for his belief. On the other hand, a man half-drunk with ‘bishop' is
likely to be more than usually orthodox; and indulgence in this episcopal
beverage, as it strengthens his attachment to the Established Church,
is likely to diminish the chances of his getting into the station-house.
“Negus is sure to endinimbecility; and perhaps a man half-drunk with
that feeble compound should not be held responsible for his actions,
more than other persons of weak mind... A man half-drunk with milk-
punch feels a great increase in his milk of human kindness, and his
errors—as likely to be on the side of benevolence—should be leniently
dealt with.
“It is, however, very difficult to say when one is half-drunk; and it is
hardly possible for a judge to be a judge of the matter, as the proverb,
'sober as a judge, indicates that the state is strange to that learned
class; and “they best can judge it who have felt it most.” If once
questions of intoxication are to be decided by the bench, there should
be a jury of undergraduates empammelled to try the question, with a
roper classification of verdicts, such as, ‘Knew what he was about;’
Saw double;’ ‘Didn't go for to do it; ’, ‘Lushy, but ;
responsible;’ ‘Sprung, but sensible;’ ‘Doubtfully drunk;’ ‘Drun
and desperaſe;’ and soon, down or up, to “Drunk and insensible, at
which point responsibility may be said to cease altogether; and such a
verdict, it is submitted, 3. not be “void for insensibility.’” |

ON THE MORAL, SOCIAL, & PROFESSIONAL DUTIES
OF ATTORNIES AND SOLICITORS.
Delivered in the Hall (of his Chambers) º. BRIEFLEss, Esq., &c. &c.,
BARRISTER-AT-LAw.
LECTURE VI.
ANISHED, Sir, and scouted as a client, you have sought
me once more as a pupil. and in that character you
A are welcome to this Hall, which my luminous
§ lectures have turned into one of those poetical pas-
sages which have been alluded to by the song writer as
“The halls, the halls, the halls of dazzling light.”
You would become at the same time a better at-
torney and a better man—a simultaneous improve-
ment that vulgar prejudice would deem impossible.
To become a better lawyer, you should attend the
Courts, and get your legal learning as you would your
ginger-beer, fresh from the fountain—I mean the
mouths of the Judges. Come, Sir, to Westminster
Hall, and hear me when I am in my glory, that is to
say, in my wig and gown. With my head encased in forensic horse-
hair, I am another being; my eyeballs roll like marbles in their
sockets, and at times, moved by a passionate indignation, my tongue
cleaves, the bones of my knees tremble, until, amidst the agitation of
these marrow-bones and cleavers, I shriek aloud for justice...
Come to the Hall of Westminster, and listen to the brilliant banter
of BALDERDAsH, Q.C., when, with a scowl of angry defiance at the
Bench, with a dagger in each eye for the whole Bar, and with his lip in
stiff curl at the whole Court, he asks, “Where and oh where” is the leg
that his adversary has got to stand upon?'. -
Come, Sir, to Guildhall when I am twisting a jury round my thumb,
or am lacerating a witness in my forensic fangs, having him “here,
there, and everywhere,” until I have torn him into so many pieces that
he cannot collect himself. Again. Come, Sir, when I am making that
dreadful demand for speedy execution, at which the sternness of Justice
itself will sometimes pause, and will check my impetuosity by refusing
me anything more summary than “execution in a week; ” as if the
Bench should say to me, in one loud chorus-
Pray, Barefless, please to moderate the fervour of your tongue;
Why flash those sparks of fury from your eyes?
Remember, judgment in a week makes execution strong :
Defendant you must not surprise.
It is by listening to our oratory that you improve yourselves, and we
become your tutors gratuitously without knowing it—I may well say
without knowing it, for what lawyer would do anything gratuitously,
unless it were without knowing it, indeed?
In addition to the lessons obtained by listening to our speeches, there
is much to be learned by reading our works. You must not look at
the exploded legal literature, such as Boot's Suit,” for that would be
bootless indeed now; or SAUNDERs 0n Uses, for these are now almost
useless; or TIDD's Practice, which, with the exception of a few TIDD-
bits, must be voted Rococo. The volumes you should read are of another
character. Smother yourself in Coke. Pile up bushels of it over your
head, and it will illuminate your brain. Stuff yourself with BAcon, and
then, to aid your digestion, rush to the Digests, where you will find relief.
If you would learn a great deal in a little compass, go to Noy, where,
without the annoyance of plodding through volumes, you will find
in his Marims the maximum of wisdom in the minimum of space. For
your Equity reading, let me recommend you to Story's Jurisprudence;
and remember, that he who is “famous in Story” is sure to win renown.
But you must not forget the Law of Evidence; and here let me entreat
you to make yourself perfect in STARKIE, who will assist you in getting
at the stark–I mean the naked—truth; while, if your memory requires
further fillips, you will find in PHILLIPs all that you require.
I now come to a matter of the greatest import, for I would speak with
reference to references, when the parties substitute arbitration for the
arbitrary rules of law. When you resort to arbitration, do not basely
leave your arbitrator with his award on his hands, out of heart with his
client, out of pocket for his stamp, and out of patience with all the
world. I have known some cases of this kind, where a young and ardent
barrister placed his talents and his chambers at the service of parties,
who, after giving him the trouble of listening to their altercations, filling
ante-room with noisy and thirsty witnesses, who sat saturating them-
selves in beer till their evidence was required, left him nothing but his
own reflections and the publican's pots, returnable on the morrow of
Hilary—the day after this hilarity—for all the trouble he had taken
on their behalf. If I might condescend to levity, I should call this
“a case in pint; ” but I see, Sir, that you cannot comprehend a joke,
and I at once withdraw from circulation this very puny pun.
* Boot's Suit at Law.
When engaged for a client, beware of making imprudent admissions
—though, by the way, there are many imprudent admissions made
.# erm, and your own admission as an attorney comes under this
I remember a curious case of cross actions brought on an assault, and
a bill of exchange. . The payee had presented the bill, and the
acceptor had payed out the payee with a kick, as he turned to leave the
room. Both parties brought actions, and both admitted the endorse-
ment—the one of his own back, the other of the bill of exchange.
Be careful about the stamps. But this opens up a subject which
ought to impress itself upon the attention; and I will therefore
attempt to pick to pieces this to-pic in another Lecture.
THE DIRGE OF THE CORN LAW.

For Protection's decease:

Prot. Bleat, ye sheep, ye heifers, low;
Cry aloud, ye beeves and swine !
Farm. Nay, good folks, but wherefore so?
Why should you tempt us to repine,
And our flocks and herds exhort
Thus, in melancholy sort,
To bellow, grunt, and whine?
Both yourselves and your live stock-
The land's united interest–
Will suffer in the common shock.
Farm. Our own affairs we know the best.
Prot. Think of corn's tremendous fall.
Farm. That is no ground for discontent;
As Produce is, so must be Rent;
That is all.
Oh dear! oh dear!
There, never fear.
Exempt from fiscal pillage
Our pasturage and tillage;
Only give us a fair field, -
And we'll take care to make it yield.
Prof. Alas! but what is to be done?
Farm. The Malt Tax taken off, for one;
And then you’ll have no cause to be
Of failing rents afraid;
Procure us but Free Husbandry,
And never mind Free Trade.
This is the way to speed the plough,
Together with the loom;
So come, no longer snivel now
Above Protection's tomb.
Prof.

ESTIMATION OF THE ESTIMATES.
HER MAJESTY told the House of Commons that the Estimates “will
be framed with the most anxious attention to a wise economy.” Should
the Royal assurance prove true, the Estimates will deserve not only to
be framed, but glazed.
GOOD NEWS FOR GOVERNMENT.
It is not probable that any firm stand against HER MAJESTY's
Ministers will be made in the House of Commons. The head of the
Opposition, it is understood, is decidedly Dizzy.

THE BEST RIDDLE EVER MADE.
We are fond of riddles, mysteries, conundrums, and puzzles of all kinds, and
flatter ourselves that we are rather clever in guessing them. We have at last
however, found our match. We have been º beaten. We are not ashamed
of our defeat, for there never was, and never will be again, a Riddle like it. It
stands alone; and, perhaps it is as well that it does; for we are sure if there were
many Riddles of the same sort, the country would be ruined in Lunatic Asylums.
We devoted a whole day to it—took it to bed with us—and began it again the first
thing in the morning, but all to no purpose; not a word of it could we understand.
It is certainly the best Riddle ever invented. The most genuine Yankee would
give it up. Of all the Mysteries of London, there is not one that comes at all
near it. It beats, all the Chinese puzzles in the world, and we are still lost in
wonder, however it was put together. Should any ingenious reader wish to try his
hand at it, we do not mind telling him what it is, leaving it entirely to his generosity
to let us into the secret, supposing he should succeedin making anything out of it.
We cannot imagine a greater Riddle than a man sitting down to read the Debates.
If he understands a speech every now and then, he must be a clever, and decidedly
a very lucky man; but what must it be, then, when he attempts to read the Debates
in the Fometic Nuº. We call that the hardest Riddle that has ever appeared in
print. We should like to see LoRP BRough AM with a copy in his hand. He would
never guess that he was the original of BRUM! . How disgusted he would be
too, to find himself so little! What notion of greatness could you connect with a
name like BRUMP
The Golden Ass.
THE American papers, which are richer than ever since the discovery of California,
gave an account of a donkey escaping laden with gold. This donkey, it would seem,
is not the only one by thousands who has gone quite wild, and allowed himself to
be carried away in this new pursuit. We wonder how many donkeys are at
º running after the first one?. If he gets safe out of it with all the gold on
is back, he is decidedly the cleverest donkey there is in California.
THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.
So, wore rather a solemn aspect on the 1st of February,
the day appointed for the opening of Parliament by HER
MAJESTY in state. The servants at Buckingham Palace
rose with the lark, and for the lark, on that eventful day
which is expected as an annual bit of fun by the underlings
of Royalty. Even the horses in the Royal stable seemed
to grin with delight through their respective horse-collars.
The eight beautiful creams were roused from their stalls
and as they drove round to the Palace door, they presented
the appearance of so many whipped creams, followed by
an enormous piece of gilt gingerbread, in the form of the
state vehicle.
For some time previous to the starting of the procession,
a body of Life Guards had been performing the customary
gallopade along the line, for the purpose of clearing it, and
we heard of no such untoward event as a smashed toe
among the entiremultitude. Webelieve that the hoofs of the
horses are, on these occasions, humanely wadded with tow,
in order that they may come “light as thistle-down” on
to the high-lows of both high and low forming the crowd.
Without wishing to underrate the value of show on state
occasions, we do think that MADAME Tussaud should be
entreated to name her price for the carriage, which should
thus be got off the national hands at, the highest figure
possible. It must be, at any rate, worth its weight in wax
to that ingenious lady, and its removal to Baker Street
would prevent many ashock to our beloved soverei We
often wonder that the absence of everything in the shape
of spring does not summarily send HER MAJEsty into the
arms of the Mistress of the Robes, or leave PRInce
ALBERT in the hands of the Master of the Horse, by one
of those convulsions to which wheels, when in a state of
revolution, are liable. The vehicle is, moreover, getting
shabby, and NEPTUNE's nose must be fresh lacquered, his
fork must have its prongs re-plated, and the wheels must
all be “picked out” with Dutch metal, if the rickety old
concern is to be continued as part of the paraphernalia of
Royalty. Even the Lord Mayor is beginning to get
ashamed of the state coach, and makes the City Remem-
brancer form a blind with the City Mace, behind which the
civic sovereign is glad to hide himself. -
To return, however, to the procession on the opening of
Parliament, which we had the pleasure of witnessing from
the top of an iron º where we occupied a rather
con-spike-uous position. e were particularly struck by
the immense number of women with children in their arms,
who came out to see the sight, as if on this occasion there
had been a turn-out of every baby in the modern Baby-lon.
When the cannon fired, the squalling of these helpless
babes caused a salute of infantry to be added to the salute
of artillery; and, what with the big guns and the little
sons of guns, the noise was almost unbearable.
We hailed, as an indication of economy, the absence of
the usual gravel, which it has been customary to lay down
throughout the route, and the cortège passed over the common
earth, which has never, until now, been thought good
enough for a Royal cavalcade to travel on. We shall anxiously
look out for the unused gravel in the next year's Estimates,
and shall expect at least six cartloads to be carried over
º º Commissioners for the Reduction of the National
ent.
The arrangements for seeing the procession were on the
usual scale, and all sorts of people were sticking up all sorts
of forms, which were offered to those who were ready to
stand upon forms, however trifling, at so much or so little
per footing. We witnessed one luckless individual who had
taken a ten minutes' lease of a rush-bottomedchair, but who,
when the rush really came, was suddenly carried away by
the torrent, and will, no doubt, regret his temerity in having
ventured to take the chair at such a very large meeting.
When the first of the Royal carriages came insight, the at-
tempts to f. an elevation above the mass were at once
absurd and desperate. We saw two enthusiasts perched,
at threepence each, tºte-à-tête on either side of a tatur can.
In another part of the crowd a speculator, in a bricklayer's
jacket, was announcing his readiness to admit one to his
unfurnished hod, for the small sum of sixpence. No one,
however, seemed disposed to make one at this very dam-
gerous game of “hod man;" but the incident is worth
recording, as characteristic of the curiosity that prevailed
on the occasion of HER MAJESTY's opening Parliament.

DISTRIBUTION OF NAVAL MEDALS.
... WE are happy to announce that the Lords of the Admiralty have
issued an Order for the distribution of Medals to the Officers and
Seamen who served in the naval actions hereunder specified. We un-
derstand the Medals are of gold, set round with diamonds of the most
costly description. Great caution will be used in the distribution, to
prevent fraud in personating deceased officers, &c.
A. D. 876. KING ALERED's engagement with and destruction of the
Danish fleet.
- 1350. Great sea-fight between the English and the combined
fleets of France and Spain.
– 1588. Destruction of the Spanish Armada.
– 1702. ADMIRAL BENBow’s engagement with the French.
– 1761. Siege and capture of Belleisle.
N.B. No-officer or seaman will be entitled to a Medal in respect of
the last-mentioned siege, unless he can satisfy their Lordships that he
was “there all the while.”
RAILWAY CIRCULATING LIBRARIES.
“THOSE who run,
may read,” has
long ... been an
established privi-
lege, tho We
have never tried
reading in that
particular man-
| ner, and cannot
| help fancying it
: must be ratherum-
comfortable. It
- is difficult enough
to read whilst you
are walking: what
! must it be, then,
when you are
going at the rate
of six miles an
hour? The many
knocks you would
receive when you
came to a difficult
passage, . would
soon Convince you
of the utter im-
possibility of at-
tending to your legs and your brains at the same time; for even a ballet:
dancer, who generally throws his whole soul into his feet, cannot succeed
in raising the two to an equal height of excellence; and does the
reader suppose he is any better than a ballet-dancer?...If he does, let
him, take a book, and begin a hand-gallop through Cheapside about
twelve o'clock, and, before he has run through one, sentence, he will
soon find himself, like SERJEANTTALFourD at the last election but one,
shamefully floored for Reading.
. However, this is no reason why those who ride, should not read...It
is to be tried, at all events, on the North Western Railway, which
promises, if the plan, succeeds, to become one of the greatest engines
of literature. Circulating ibraries are to be established at every
station, where John SMITH, on making a deposit, may borrow The
Mysteries of a Black-Pudding, or any other novel in three volumes,
which deposit will be returned to him (minus a small payment) at his
journey's end... We see several difficulties attending this new, race
of letters; but it is hardly fair, we think, to start them before the scheme
itself has started.
First of all, it is very clear the Company will have to light their
carriages, or else the reading will be a complete blind, and that is
Scarcely wanted in a tunnel, or in carriages which vie with the Vernon
Gallery in darkness. Even illuminated books will not be able to
enlighten the reader, and what is called the light literature of the day,
will be completely put out, unless a candle is lent with each book
borrowed. -
The rate of payment is easily settled. Of course, it will be at so
much a line; but the longer the line, the more the borrower will have
to "pull out" to meet it; thus, a Greenwich serial will cost less than
a Richmond one, and a Brummagem novel will go into a Manchester
one at least twice, and a small pamphlet over. - -
One great obstacle will be, that every station must be provided with
the first and third volumes of every novel. The second volume does
not so much matter, as it is rarely read; but the third is indispensable,
as every well-bred young lady begins with that, and then, if she likes
it, asks for the first. Now, as on each line there will be somewhere
about (say) forty stations, it will involve forty copies of every new
work. EssRs. BENTLEy, and CoIBURN, and NEwBY, will rejoice at
this new opening for novels, which had never been connected with
railways before, in any other capacity but that of sleepers.

A GENTLEMAn who has BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SUBJECT.
One mighty effect of these Railway Circulating Libraries will be its
laying down a new line of literature. Works will have to be written
for each particular railway. What the Sheffield man would relish, the
Cambridge man would not touch; and the Scotchman on the Caledonian
would require a different mental food to the Frenchman hastening home
by the South Eastern to join in a new Revolution... But this subject is
too large for compression, so we must keep it till next week, in the
hopes of finding room for it. In the meantime, we must confess that a
Railway is decidedly the best vehicle going for circulating a Library.
WERY ODD FELLOWS.
WE see at Oxford there is a Society, called “THE CEMENTED
BRICKs.” We are not inventing. . We can assure the reader this is a
positive fact. We should say...that Bricks were just the members to
form a Lodge that would be likely to stand. The fact of their being
cemented, we suppose is to prevent any particular Brick falling out, and
so F. the Lodge to pieces...We see these Cemented Bricks had
a Ball on the 5th instant. ...What a dust they must have kicked up!
—that is to say, if they at all danced like Bricks.
THE SOURCE OF PERPETUAL MOTION.
THIs great principle has at length been discovered. A reference to
the present and past debates in the Houses of Parliament will prove it
to be neither more nor less than–Ireland.

“MR. PUNCH, SIR,
“THE abuv is the below ritten Pome, on a subjec of grate

And then, this mene and shabby feller

BRIGGS ad gone out and took the cellar

And cumpny comeng on a suddent,

Whereby in course the butler cooden’t

So Missis B. she would be werry
Much obliged if e 'd send in
Arf a dozen best brown. Sherry,
And single bottel'Ollans gin.
But this was nothink but a story as
This wicked butler went and told,
Whereby for nothink to get glorious,
Wich so he did, and grew more bold.
Until, at last grown more audashus,
He goes and orders, wat d'ye think?
He goes and orders, goodness grashus,
Marsaly, wind no gent can drink.
It wasn’t for his private drinkin—
For that he’d BRIGGSEs wine enuff—
But, wen the Sherry bins was sinkin
He filled 'em with this nasty stough.
And BRIGGs, Esquire, at is own tabel

MISS BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
MISS B. REVIEWS THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.
THE Parliment’s begun; and—I do assure you, Mr. Punch
| , i. —when Ispread the . Times, and see the 20 columns of
| talk, my heart—saving your presence—seemed to drop
| into my stockings! In course, everybody says there’s
nothin in the QUEEN's Speech—there never is—and the
Speech as is always just delivered is always worse than
every Speech as ever went afore. It’s clear that, next
to parrits, and cockytoos, Kings and Queens are the
worst-used of people—havin such nothins put into their
mouths to chatter!
The Mornin' Erald says that “speech was given to
man to hide his thoughts.” TALLYRAND is said to have
discovered this in high life; but MR. LovELACE—the
gentleman in the pelisse, as I hope you’ve not for-
gotten-says, “there's twenty claimants for this golden
- mo; it’s one of the stray orfins, that have grown grey
in the world with no rightful father or mother to own 'em. Beautiful
foundlins, flung upon the publick for the publick service;” and, I must
say, preshusly this one is worked, bein put into harness as reglar,
on the openin of every Parliment, as the QUEEN's Scream-colours.
Howsumever, if man only uses speech to disgise his thoughts, what
superior Creturs cats and dogs must be, as can’t talk at all! They
must, in the end, beat Christians to Styx.
I was happy to see that the vaults and sellers of Parliment was dooly
fertched afore the Pears, and Pearesses and Bishups took their seats.
And it’s a blessin to think, should the House ever agin get afire, there's
wet blankets in the shape of MISTER URRUART and ANSTEY to smother it
in the very bud. As for blow in up the House, why it’s impossible, with
some heavy Members I could name; there’s nothin in powder or fire-
wurks as could lift'em.
MR, LovELACE tells me, the Royal Percession was bewtiful. The
Queen's Scream-colours, like the CHANCELLOR of the CHECKERs, seemed
proud of their truly nashional, burdin. The trumpits flourished like
laughing silver. “The Queen looked”—says LovELACE—“like one entire
and perfect pearl, set in the heart of the nation.” The Ion Duke had
rubbed off any rust he might have; and the Duke of Diners-out—good-
natur'd CAMBRIDGE—seemed (says my informint) ekwal to any number
of champagnes at the London, the George and Vultur, or Freemasons.
After the Speech come what’s called the ecko of the same. When I was
a gal, I remember Miss STEPHENs—who, as the Countess of Sx, now
wears a cornet on her, brow—I remember her doin an Ecko Dewet.
She sung first, and then a flute or fife went tootle-tootle-too behind
the scenes. Well, EARL BRUCE “moved the Address:” took the part
in the Ecko, and, for a young musicianer—I will say it—did his tootle-
tootle-tooing very well.
In course, LORD BROUGHAM had the fust word. His Lordship—bein
a sort of tº inted Bagman atween France and England—giv his
notions of the Republic of Paris; and, abusin all Precedents, went for
the entire animal, or, to speak without a figger, for. Louis-FILLIP.
And then, his Lordship give it the Chartists and Radicals, and took 'em
in his arms, embracin all the Landed Interest. Oh, law And when
BROUGHAM shaves, can he see in the glass—the mirror of Parliment,
so to speak—can he see the same “little HENRY”—as Miss STEPHENs
ysed to say in Guy Manutring—the “little HENRY” of the House of
Commons? As is so often the case with his Lordship, when he'd made
his speech, he went away. “If it was a rap at Ministers,” as LovE.
LACE observed, “it was, at best, only a runaway knock.”
Next riz LóRD STANLEY with his 'mendment. He talked aginst
mediation anywhere or with anybody. Bein a lover of peace, his
pollicy is, “Let 'em fight it out all over the world.” There is an old
story of a gal who dropt nothin but purls and di'monds. LoRD
STANLEY, for an hour and more—and all for peace—talked cartridges
with bullets in 'em. Peace is painted as a sweet, delicat female:
nevertheless, accordin to STANLEY, her toylet-powder—if any—must be
made of charcole and saltpeter. And them, how his Lordship spread the
honey of his ellikwence upon the KING OF THE Two CIGEITEs. As
the proprietor of. Vesuevius, he was made not only the Rose of
Kings, but the Flower of Brimstone. . (If the King invents, as it’s
said, the Qrder cf. the Lucifer, won't he send a speshial box to “the
Ruepot of Debate,” as his Lordship's called in the pome of The Modern
Timmins?)
* LoRD LANSDowNE told LoRD STANLEY, in the words of the sweet
song, to wait a little longer. Some good papers were coming, and then
STANLEY should see what he should set. But it was very clear his
Lordship didn't want enlightenin on a subjick, to talk about it. A real
Pºiº like a cat, always sees best in the dark.
he DUKE OF RICHMOND—like double XX—was preshus strong
upon barley,
Then came the Ion_Duke; and ſhe kindly give the wait of his
mettle to Ministers. The Ion Duke's very good; always ready to
lend 'em the loan of a crowbar. For all this, the Wigs only beat,the
Opposition by a couple, which, as that wag LovELACE observd...is
sertinly not 2 strong. -
When the Ecko Dewet was done in the Commons, up gits the best
man the Tories have to their backs—I mean, in course, their Upper
BENJAMIN. I’m told all was so silent, you might have heerd PEEL's
courage drop. Well, DISREALLY made hisself up to speak-took his
persition! And Icanliken that young man on the floor º' the House, to
nothin but a penknife of a hundred blades—and every blade open-like
the verything as is offered to the 'busses by a Cawcasshun at the White
Horse or the Elefant. Yes; DISREALLY, the Penknife of a Hundred
Blades—the Porkipine with steel quills!--(But to drop figgers, and
perceed). BENJAMIN begun carm and cold—yes, cold as Venom Ice.
And then he took up the Royal Speech as an awdacious imperdent boy
would take up his little sister's wax doll, and pull the Wig of it to bits,
and poke out its eyes, and knock its nose to nothin aginst the table;
and then, with one of them blades he ripped up the body, and shook out
all the bran as made its witals; and when he’d torn, and knockt, and
smasht the doll to bits, what does he do, but puts his hand in his waist.
coat pocket and pulls out a little wax doll of his own—a thing not
longer than your #. finger, and drest in very shortest close?, And
then BENJAMIN, with his own wonderful face, laid his, two-inch doll
upon the table, sayin' in a most magnificient way,+he'd make a
present of that doll, every morsel on it, to the wants of the º:
And then MR. GRATTAN made an Irish amendment, and MR. JoHN
O'Connell, seconded it; but that “first, flower"—that early 'tato
blossom of the Seshun—was in no time blighted and dead. Afore
that, however—
LoRD J. Russell riz to answer BERJAMIN. . Now, I’ve always
said, if LoRD JoHN is not quite a great man, he is the miniture full
length of a great un. Like so many of the Wigs, with a big model,
he’s in a diminished state; a giant with all his feet brought down to
inches. LoRD John, hasn’t the pint of BENJAMIN. . LORD JOHN wasn't
born with ion pens—(tho' he's dipped 'em in red ink for a deep tragedy
—so deep nobody ever saw to the end on it)—for all that, he puts so
hard a face upon a matter, he’s hard to cut. Indeed—as LovELACE
says—he's like a grinstone (not that he’s gone round so, very much)
that, though it may sharpen others, is very little touched by 'em. And
so LoRD JoHN, in his own strong way, answered BENJAMIN, .." 8.
good slap o' the cheek—it made my heart warm to hear that slap-to
that Lucifer king, that KING OF NAPLEs. - - -
And then Joseph HUME rose, and opened his mind—like a Ready
Reckoner—and then the House went about its business; that is, went
to bed at , past 12—and took º end of the talk the next day,+
when I was pleased to find that KERNEL SIBTHORP was still alive, and,
in course, kickin Ministers. Wonderful KERNEI, that, Mr. Punch /
Perhaps the only Kernel known, as ever lasted so long with so many
droll maggots in it. LovELACE tells me he looked young as ever... But
then, you know, some creturs never die. URKwaRT was also there;
and said “he could not give a silent vote.” Why, in course not: as
soon expect a goose to give a silent gaggle. -
LoRD PALMystERN made a nice speech. I was charmed with what
he said of France. Every word was an olive (and he must have used a
whole bottleful) thrown from the banks of the Temms to the banks of
the Scene. Good cretur ! He cooed like any dove. Never did the
British Lion rore so like a pet-lamb. He owned—at once—that he
loved peace; owned that he had agin and agin “been engaged in
mediation.” Much cheaper, and, I think, much prettier engagements
fought with ink and pens than with fire and bag.onets. Sertinly,
dressing himself to DisBEALLY, his Lordship shut up a many of
BENJAMIN's blades; but that was no matter to BEN: the blades had
glissened and cut, and that was quite enuff. Shut 'em up, fifty times-
can't they be opened agin and agin? -
Well, the Address was voted, and the tuning of the Parliment fiddles
and trumbones finished. Next week I may tell you what I think of
the Government overture. M. B.
A Tremendous Hardship.
“As you make your bed, so you must lie on it.”. But this is rather
hard upon the ships in HER MAJESTY's Dockyard, for not one of them
makes its own bed, and yet for months and months that they are laid
up, they are compelled to lie in it. What is the consequence? Many
of them never get up again, and the few that do rise never go on
swimmingly.
ALAS · POOR SIBTHORPE.
CoLoREL SIETHoRPE, in the midst of an harangue in which he called
for the impeachment of all the Ministers, and expressed a particular
desire to see LoRD John Russell shaken in-or rather out of his
seat, made the touching avowal that it was “painful to him to use
strong language.” We wonder the gallant Colonel persists in giving
himself so much unnecessary pain.
INFALLIBLE CURE FOR LONG SPEECHES-Only report the good ones.

OUR reasons for not going to California are very simple. The worth

less than 13,000 miles from England, we do not think that any gold is
worth going all that distance to fetch it. We have other reasons, but
one will be enough—we can make as much gold as we want in Fleet

quite inexhaustible. The gold is always found there in the happiest vein.

MISS BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
MISS. B. COMMENTS ON THE PLAY AND THE PARLIAMENT.-STRANGE
REWERSE OF FORTUNE.
“Miss BENIMBLE,”—says that pink of pelissemen, LovELACE, the
| last time he come—“Miss BENIMPLE,” says he, “you smell like a bank
of widlets.” Meanin, in course, the tººl own it—I had made
strong the afternoon in kwestion. ell, Mr., Punch, seeing that
ED'ARD-(that’s LovELACE; his name being Ep'ARD, as I drew from
him in the confidence of markin his two pockethandkerchers)—seeing
the dear fellar was sufferin a little from what the French call n w i–
why I let him take his six cups, and go his three rounds afore I bust
into dyealog. Howsumever, when he !" his spoon in his cup, wiped
his lips, and stretcht his legs, I thought him ekwal to the kwestion,
which I venturd. “What’s your pinion, MR. LoveLACE,” says I,
“of the stage as it is, and as it isn’t ; as it might be, and as it never
will be P’’
“That’s a compound question, Miss BENIMBLE,”—said LoveLACE ;
and I’m sure he’s been a schoolmaster. Tº a question like your cat,
that runs upon four legs. Just now, however, the stage is like a
five-shilling piece; none the worse for the royal countenance. The
Drama’s been to Court and kissed hands; and people run to see how it
looks after so severe a trial. By what I hear, W. CHARLEs KEAN is
quite as well as could be expected.”
“Well!”. cries I, a little stounded at the happythy of LovELACE—
“Well! I should think so, after that ring HER MAJESTY sent him,
thro’ KERNEL FIPPs. Don't you call that ring an honor and a
blessin P”
“ Humph! I don’t know,” says LovELACE, crumplin his brow with a
little satyr in each eye—“I don’t know; it’s open to debate. I think
HER MAJESTY had a sly meaning in that present. I think the QUEEN
sent the brilliant to CHARLEs KEAN, in the hope that a player, like a
watch, might act all the better on a diamond.”
*Whatever the meanin was Mr. fovelace.” says I, “it can’t
inwalidate the property. That little diſmond-like the lectric light—
must luminate the whole perfession. Not a cawl boy that musn't feel
the brighter for it. ... For my own part—I am not ashamed to own it—I
feel º: drawn all over to the play-house by that ring—drawn as if it
was a loadstone, and my natur was steal filings.”
“Just like you women,” said LovELACE, with a sardonyx larf.
“Don’t tell me,” says I. “That di’mond ring will generate the
dramma, and that this very spring. For when people come from the
country to Xeter Hall and MADAME Tooso's, won't they—and all along
o' that ring—won't they go to see Hamlet and Shylock, with the other
indelicacies of the season?”
“I see,” said LovELACE—and I fear he's a kwiz—“I see; an actor
may be º from a star to a planet. A player, like Saturn, may
be stared at—and only for his ring.”
Well, Mr. Punch, seein that LovELACE would be eyeronick, I bust
from the subjick, "Tisn't pleasant to have one's weekness—andi must
say, some people's acting is a weekness of mine-sniggled to pieces.
“Parliment’s set in with all its dullness,” says I. “All the debates this
week for all the world like a bit of cold mutton without a pickel. I’m
sure, I’ve nodded over 'em, as if they’d been printed in poppy jews.”
*Very bad, ma'am,” said LovELACE, crimping his ibrows like little
snakes. “Long talk, and little busness.
Parl'ment’s grown too big for its mouth.” . .
“And I see,” says I, “that they won’t bind theirselves to speak no
more than an hour a-piece. Now, I do think anybody can do their best
and their wust in an hour. And I must say it—not that I’m souper-
stishus—but there 's a sweet souperstishun about an hour.”
"What do you mean, Miss BENIMBLE *” asked LovELACE. “Super-
stition, ma'am!”
“Why, an hour is a bit of the wisdom of our aunt’s sisters. In this
way: we hang for an hour, don't we? ...Very well. And before it was
'bolished we put criminals—some on ’em the most hardened of our
benefactors—in the pillory for an hour. Therefore, as we take an hour
to what is called finish the law, why not—at most—an hour a-head
for them as make the laws? And I’d have it done in this way. At the
meetin of Parliment, the Speaker should serve out, to the hole House,
658 hour-glasses. d when any Member rose, he should get up with
his glass in his hand, which he should put down on a table afore him.”
H. ot to be done,” said LovELACE. “Tables don’t run round the
ouse.”
“Nonsense! There might be a few little tables, sich as they play at
ea-and-thimble with at the races; that 'ud do beutiful. §§ ºf.
QYELACE, do think, of DISREALLY, that eliqwent Corkasshun, risin
with his hour-glass, like º Time with his lox in curl. He puts his
glass upon the table, with a smack that goes thro’ the buff wastecoat
of SIR ROBERT; the five shillin pieces—if he has any—in the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE CHECKER's º: tremble theirselves into fourpenny
bits; LORD JoHN fastens his hat upon his head, and ties his arms in a
knot across his stumack, till the Penknife of a Hundred Blades has
flashed and glissened his sixty minutes; whilst the Pertectionists set
close, and their ears grow wisibly, like thistles after a shower.”
“Why thistles?” asked LovELACE. But with a motion of my hand
I waved the kwestion.
“Well,” said I, not to be stopt; “the Member with the glass afore
him, with the sand in his eye, begins. It’s a fair race atween words
and grit; and the more
the sand runs out, the
more the Speaker must
run after it, and never
upon no account is he
to be aloud to turn up
the subjick, and go on
agin.” -
“And suppose,” said
LovELACE, in his
acrostic manner -
“suppose a speaker

mitted to part with’--
“Not a bit on it,”
said I, jumping like an
envelope at what was
coming. “Not a bit
on it, no loan of sand.
Not a minute's worth.
Ha! MR. LovELACE,”
says I, drawin to the
fire, and growin warm
with the subjick-
- --- - - “’twould be a sweet
moral sight to see BENJAMIN with his glass; to see him hurry after the
sand as it fell, and fell in a little pyramboid; his sand being in his eye
as so much dimond dust, which he was takin the shine out of, by the
hundred blades he was a flashin. A sweet sight, MR. LovELACE.”
“I see, ma'am,” said the Pelisseman after a little a musin. “I see;
the sand might occasionally represent the object of the speaker; might
in his own mind typify his object.”
I didn't quite get at this, Mr. Punch, but a woman is a giant at a
ess. So I said—“Sertainly, MR. LovELACE. . In this manner

“It’s a sweet theory, ma'am,” said. LovELACE; “but it won’t, do.
By the way, you see they’ve suspended Habeas Corpus again in Ireland.”
“Just like 'em,” said I; “always suspendin sumbody in that unfor-
tinate country. And have they cotched the culprits? Or will they
'scape?” - -
A sly smile º like a jacka lanthorn on the Pelisseman's cheek,
when he said—“Escape, to a certainty.”
“And about the rebellion, MR. LovELACEP That BAGSTER—to be
sure he’s a Chartist—that BAGSTER says it’s gone to bed comfortable,
and will never get up again.” - -
“Why, ma'am, some folks say—specially the Irish Members—that the

“Talking of luck,” said LovELACE, with an odd twinkel of his eye-
“talking of luck, that was an extraordinary change of fortune that fell
last week on SAM Downes, the Westminster waterman.”
“Not seen it in the paper! What is it?” says I. -
“Why, this it is,” says LovELACE, stretchin hisself for his story.
“This it is. Poor SAM Down Es was as good a fellow as ever broke
bread—when he could get it. Got a nice little wife, with ten or twelve
children to match. §nothing for years went well with SAM Dow NES.
Measles, or the tally-man, or something of the sort, was always knocking

dinary, they have had these same berths for years. Every one of the
little 'GREYsis doing remarkably well, and à retain their faculties in
addition to their ies.
WANTS A PLACE |
The following is a correct º (address omitted) of an advertisement
from the Times Supplement, Feb. 7.
O YOU WANT A SERVANTP Necessity prompts the question.—The
advertiser OFFERS his SERVICES to any lady or gentleman, company, or
others in want of a truly faithful confidential servant in any capacity not menial,
where a practical knowledge of human nature in variºus parts of the world would be
available. Coud undertake any affair of small or great importance, where talent,
inviolable scorecy, or good address would be necessary. Has moved in the best and
worst societies without being contaminated by either; has never been a servant; begs
to recommend himself as one who knows his place; is moral, temperate, midnie-
aged, no objection to any part of the world. Could advise any º: wishing to
increase his income and have the control of his own money. Could act as secretary
or valet to any lady or gentleman. Can give advice or hold his tongue, sing, dance,
play, fence, box, preach a sermon, tell a story, be grave or gay, ridiculous or sublime,
or do anything from the curling of a peruke to the storming of a citadel, but never to
excel his master. Address —, -, -—.
There can be no doubt of the individuality of the advertiser. Without
a question, the man is D B–h–M ! Every line—we can
§ touch upon two or three—is a line of likeness. He has “a practical
knowledge of human nature.” To be sure; has not his L–p worn
stuff and horse-hair; speaking a great deal of the one, and, to “springe
woodcocks,” using a good deal of the other?
Is he not equal to any affair, “small or great?” No doubt. Has
not his L–p brought in Tweed trowsers and the Diffusion of
Knowledge?
Moved in “the best and worst society.” Here we are puzzled. Of
course, his L–p means both Houses of Parliament. But we must
ask, which is one—and which is “t'other?”
“Can give advice or hold his tongue.” Here, certainly, the likeness
fails; but we take it, this was written for a purpose; namely, to mislead
the otherwise suspicious.
“Dance, play, fence, box, preach a sermon, tell a story, be grave or
gay, be ridinious or sublime." Everybody will allow that his ºld.
can do and be all but the last; the last being, in his opinion, that whic
he is most frequently and the best.
Can “curl a peruke or storm a citadel.” For a “peruke” read a
Whig; and for a “citadel,” the stronghold of Truth. For what says
SIR ãº's BRowNE * “A man may be in as just possession of truth
as of a city, and yet be forced to surrender.” -
The touch conveyed in the promise “never to excel his master” is
admirable in its fine knowledge of human weakness. There is nothing
better in the whole of the writer's Historical Sketches.
The confession, however, that prefaces the advertisement is affecting.
“Do you want a Servant?, Necessity prompts the question.” Poor
L–1. B–H–M! And is he in such despair of a Place? ... Well,
Punch benevolently copies the advertisement, knowing that now it must
meet the eye of the Ministry.

For which no rhyme our language yields,

The New Street of the Little Fields;
And here's an . not rich and splendid,
But still in comfortable case;
The which in youth I oft attended,
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse.
! This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is—
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes,
hat Greenwich never could outdo;
Green herbs, red peppers, muscles, safern,
les, onions, garlic, roach, and dace;
All these you eat at TERRE's tavern,
In that one dish of Bouillabaisse.
Indeed, a rich and savoury stew tis;
And true philosophers, methinks,
Who love ºf sorts of natural beauties,
Should love good victuals and good drinks.
And Cordelier or Benedictine
Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace,
Nor find a fast-day too afflicting
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.
I wonder if the house still there is?
Yes, here the lamp is, as before;
The smiling red-cheeked ecaillère is
Still opening oysters at the door.
Is TERRE still alive and able?
I recollect his droll grimace;
He’d come and smile before your table,
And hoped you liked your Bouillabaisse.
We enter—nothing’s changed or older.
“How's Monsieur TERRE, Waiter, º ?”
The waiter stares and shrugs his shoulder–
“Monsieur is dead this many a day.”
“It is the lot of saint and sinner.
So honest TERRE's run his race?”

With Burgundy and Bouillabaisse.”
My old accustomed corner here is,

Ah! vanished many a busy year is
This well known chair since last I took.
When first I saw ye, Cari luogi,
I'd scarce a beard upon my face,
And now a grizzled, grim old fogy,
I sit and wait for Bouillabaisse.
Where are you, old companions trusty,
Of early days, here met to dine?
Come, Waiter! quick, a flagon crusty—
I’ll pledge them in the good old wine.
THE BALLAD OF BOUILLABAISSE. FROM THE ContRIBUTOR AT PARIs.
The kind old voices and old faces
My memory can quick retrace;
Around the board they take their places,
And share the wine and Bouillabaisse.

There’s laughing ToM is laughing yet;
There’s brave AUGUSTUs drives his carriage ;
There’s poor old FRED in the Gazette;
On JAMEs's head the grass is growing:
Good Lord! the world has wagged apace
Since here we set the Claret flowing,
And drank, and ate the Bouillabaisse.
Ah me! how quick the days are flitting!
I mind me of a time that’s gone,
When here I’d sit, as now I’m sitting,
In this same place—but not alone.
A fair young form was nestled near me,
A dear, dear face looked fondly up,
And sweetly spoke and smiled to cheer me

Come, fill it, and have done with rhymes:
Fill up the lonely glass, and drain it

And sit you say your grace.
With thankful heart, whate'er the meal is.

SILENCE | PRAY SILENCE | |
ONE of the most useful labours with
which the Commons have com-
menced their Session, has been an
attempt to lay down some rules for
confining Parliamentary speeches
within proper limits. Among other
things, it was proposed that every
oration ºiſ' be confined to an
hour; but even this would be a
serious infliction, unless the Mem-
bers were permitted to talk in
batches of twenty or thirty at a
time, when an hour might be very
fairly allowed for the exhaustion of
so much pent-up eloquence. Some-
thing must be done to keep the
talk of the House within proper
limits; for it is unfair that CHis-
Holy ANSTEY should deal in un-
measured abuse of LoRD PALMER-
STON, when the application of some-
thing like measurement to the
- effusion would show at least half of
it to be superfluous. We are strongly inclined to the adoption of some
plan, for keeping the tongues of the Members within bounds; and we
think it would be a good arrangement to let each speaker light a
wax-end directly he commences a speech, and continue until it is con-
sumed, unless the Member next to him takes upon himself to blow out
the was when the speech begins to wax tedious.
... Anotheringenious process that has been also suggested, is the introduc.
tion of a large quantity of hour-glasses of different sizes, and containing
Various quantities, of sand, so that they may be delivered to Members

THE WALUE OF WORDS.
WHQ can estimate the value of a Word? Once from our lips, who -
can tell what it will go for In kindness, or in anger; in scorn, or in
approbation; in criticism, or in good nature, who can weigh what a
word too much, or a word too little, may amount to?
The merits of many men exist only in words. They will pour out of
their mouths, like the water over the Falls of Niagara, and make much
noise, and much smoke, and after all it will only be an infinite deal of
“Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.”
mony of words. Their ideas outrun their knowledge of the dictionary.
They would express themselves very well if they could only find words.
Other men labour under a parsi-
Such men are rare (such women are still rarer, and it is a great pity,
for it really does one good, in this period of turn-coaterie, to meet with
persons who keep their words, or whose words are worth keeping. At
the Bar this difficulty is wonderfully increased, and who can wonder at
it, when Counsel are paid for words, and he who has the largest number
invariably clears the greatest collection. A dumb man in horse-hair
would be an absurdity; for it is very plain he never could be an utter
barrister. This verbal secret has been
words. It seems, from a trial lately tried before LoRD DENMAN, that
111 ºils reports, the short-hand writers are paid so much for so many
Words.
Thus, the Counsel who makes the longest speech, cuts the greatest
figure in the bill of costs. What a friend LoRD BRough AM must have
been to the copyists! One of his long sentences must have been lite-
rally worth its weight in gold. A parenthesis, probably, was equivalent
to a dinner; and a small parenthesis, within that, equal to a good
luncheon. But it appears from the same trial, that words in Chancer
are cheaper than in §. Law—and we think this unfair, for a word,
once in Chancery, must be immediately shut up, and become so close,
that it cannot necessarily go far. Every word, however, should have the
same value in the ears of i. Law—for if Justice is blind, she is not deaf,
though perhaps it would be better for her if she were deaf, instead of
being #. considering the nonsense she is condemned to listen to,
and the mistakes she is guilty of whenever she attempts to look into
a case.
But it is nonsense talking. Words must be very cheap at the Bar, or
else they would not have been flung about so very freely upon all occa-
sions, and especially lately at the Court of Common Pleas. High words
are generally very low; and those who hold them sink very rapidly in the
estimation of their hearers. Such words as SIR FREDERICK THESIGER in-
dulged in on the above occasion, must be dear at any price; and we are
sure he would give many pounds per folio, to be able to recall them.

Words of that extravagant nature are always put down at the expense of
the barrister who utters them.

A FEW WORDS WITH THE BISHOP OF NORWICH ABOUT
JENNY LIND.
A RUMoUR is current that the Bishop of Norwich has “spirited
away”. JENNY LIND from the stage, by intimating to her that its traps
are pitfalls of iniquity, its flats mere shoals, on which virtue must
founder, and that the stage is, in fact, only one stage removed from a
place we are not in the habit of mentioning.
We will give the liberal Bishop of Norwich credit, for greater
liberality than the report we allude to would impute to him. If the
Qpera is to exist, and if it is an evil, we think the worthy Bishop will
allow it is, in our days, a necessary evil; we are not inclined to think
that the way to in prove it is to draw away from it one who shown
she can not only adorn it with her talents, but exalt it by her virtues.
If we are to withdraw the good from all admixture with the bad, we do
not make the good better, but we go the sure way to make the bad
| Worse.
The Bishop of Norwich should rather persuade JENNY LIND to
remain on the º than to quit it; for there is surely an influence in
º ; and, unless the Bishop means to tell us that the whole corps
of a theatre must be irretrievably doomed to etermal perdition, he can
scarcely argue that one who happens to have been equally eminent for
her virtues and her abilities—not by any means the ...i one, we believe,
whose virtues may be equal, though their talents are less—he will not,

Or lù.
e will not yet believe that such a cruel slur can be thrown upon
the whole class of dramatic artists by a prelate having the reputation for
liberality and d feeling which the Bishop of Norwich enjoys.
Surely he must be ignorant of certain Charities established and kept up
by actors for the support of their distressed brethren, and he doubtless
never heard of the subscriptions they continually make among them-
selves for the widows and orphans of those members of the profession
who have been prematurely taken away. We would refer the BISHOP
of Norwich to the “Elton Fund,” and we could tell him of a few other
similar matters if he thought it worth his while to inquire...But we will
not believe that the Bishop of Norwich has made himself so busy, or

ATTENTION, GENTLEMEN, TO A TOAST :
WE are sorry to say that a toast of the most objectionable nature is
now continually i. in all societies. It is washed down with every
tumbler of hot grog, glass ofFº negus, egg-hot, bishop, cardinal, or
sherry-cobbler. The very infant pledges it in his currant wine, as well
as the adult in the home-made beverage which he fondly imagines to be
Port. Even the disciples of FATHER MATHEw drink it in lemonade and
ginger-beer. Not a cup of tea is taken at the domestic table unaccom-
nied by this shocking, toast. It is most disloyal, unpatriotic, un-
nglish, and, we only wish we could say, unparliamentary. What makes
the matter worse, it is fully sanctioned by Ministers. The toast to which
we allude is, “Destruction to our West Indian Colonies,” drunk.in
every variety of liquor containing a particle of slave-grown sugar, which
we forbid our colonial, dependencies from producing, whilst we hypo-
critically partake of the sweet iniquity at the hands of foreigners,
simply because they are able to sell it to us at a cheaper rate than our
colonists are.

infants are at all refractory, LADY iittieros has only to exclaim
“Hamlet’s coming /?” and the pretty rebels are still as mice.

THE TYRANNY OF FASHION.
If we were disposed to be sentimental—which we are not—we might
grow melancholy over the havoc committed by Fashion on “the fair,
the young, the bright, the free.” How many a blue-eyed, pink-faced,
rosy-lipped, dark-haired houri has fallen a victim to the restrictive
licy of the stay-lace, which in her days of gushing womanhood has
een employed to check the exuberance into which she would have
otherwisegushed, and caused her towaste away in aslenderness of waist,
until life has proved itself indeed a mere span. The tyrant Fashion
at last seized upon our children; , and, though it did not exactly lay
them by the heels, it grasped them by the legs in such an extraordinary
manner, that we saw them walking about with calves so bare, that the
cold was barely bearable.
The absurd fashion then prevailed of making every little boy “a High-
land lad;’ and unfortunately absence of trowsers forms the
recognised feature of the Highland character. Our Parks abounded
in a juvenile population of miniature Rob, Roys and duodecimo
RHODERICKDHus, until the discovery was made that the cold imparted
to the leg flew often to the head; º sneeze, the sneeze, invariably
followed the breeze, the breeze, when the little victims, having been out
in a stiff wind, got home to their nursery. This led to the invention of
that clumsy article, the worsted ...; '. which the infantine calf got
much worsted and very little improved, for the contrivance formed a
great impediment to exercise.
Pseudotaste has since expended itsyagaries in covering these leggings
with all sorts of fantastic devices, and particularly with i. ered spots,
until every father sees so many spotson hisson, that it is y quite dis-
º must protest, in the name of commonsense, against these
masquerading freaks of Fashion; which, without putting our children
into pantaloons, makes them look like so many clowns in a pantomime.

It is so easy for a Prince to bewitty, for when he is notwitty himself,
he is sure to find some one who will be witty for him. Besides, the
smallest witticism in the mouth of a Prince goes such a distance.
PRINCE Louis-NAPoleon, as yet, has not been very lucky. This is the
more *: as he is surrounded with persons who make their very
politics a joke; and we wonder THIERs has not come to the assistance
of his beloved Emperor's nephew... But somehow or other, the Prince
has immortalised himself with a little saying. It is not much of a joke
—the point is rather mild—but still, there is an intention in it. There
is an attempt, though, like other attempts in which the Strasburg hero
has figured, it is not very successful. Faute de mieur, however, we must
praise it, and hope it will lead to º:
The Prince was determined to rush into the crowd, supposing there
had been la fighting. “If you do,” said his Ministers, “you
will certai º “Eh bien /* exclaimed the witty Louis-
NAPoleon, “si on me fue, ma foi / on me tuera.” Every Minister
º -
his little saying is perfect, and is to be recommended most highly
for its truth—a merit not always prominent in historical sayings.
“If I am killed, what then 2 why I shall be killed /* Who could deny
such an evident conclusion. º great NApoleon could not have put
it better. All Paris is in ecstasies, and in the evening there was a
universal cry for “ Des Lampions.”
We º the Prince to persevere. After such a good beginning,
it would be utter stupidity to stop. TALLEYRAND's sayings will soon
be eclipsed; and we shall shortly have published, in annual volumes,
like Hood's Comic Annual, “Les }º du PRINCE Louis-Napoleon,
pour servir à l’Histoire de la République.”
LONDON NAVIGATION.
WE, think SIR John Ross, as soon as he is at liberty, should have a
commission from HER MAJESTY to explore the º of the Lowther
cade. All communication has long been blocked up between the
two adjoining districts, and no one can tell what exists in the interior.
Mº ave attempted the passage, but have always been beaten back,
terribly discomforted, and been obliged to tack for the nearest tailor's
to put in for repairs. The fine º LABLAche attempted to
steer through on the night of JENNY LINP's Concert, but the current
was so strong, that after the cleverest sailing, and trimming on every
possible side to escape the dangerous shoals of shells, on which man
a large craft has split before now, it was fairly compelled to turn round,
and was thrown on the Strand with the loss of a coat-tail and three
wº buttons. l - t f t st l
ere are, apparently, two opposing streams of great strength-
one which runs }. St. Nº. Church and leaves the º
who sells rhubarb on the immediate left, and the other, which flows
from the fountain-head that takes its rise somewhere about WARREN's
Blacking, and diverges on the right through the pastry-cook'sshop. Any
navigator, ignorant of these two opposing streams, and the numerous
under-currents of children that run in and out in all directions, is sure
to be tossed about, and carried round and round in such a continual
Maelstrom as will make him regret he ever plunged into the gay and
giddy throng. - - -
e believe the passage was formerly navigable, and was ori y
discovered for the F.T. of establishing a short cut between the bay
of Trafalgar and the busy commerce of the Strand. This short cut,
however, is now a day’s sailing—and may becompared to Davy Jones's
Locker, for it is º improbable whether the unfortunate fellow
who once falls into it will ever come out again. A squadron should
immediately be appointed to explore the interior, and to report whether
the passage is º racticable, or whether it is not lost to the navigable
world altogether. We regret to say the devoted Beadle has not been
seen for months. It is supposed he is blocked up somewhere in the
interior.
GROSS inconsistENCY.
A GENERAL Practitioner, advertising in the Times for a º de-
scribes himself as residing in a delightful and healthy neighbourhood.
He also says, that the pupil will have º opportunity of acquiring a
thorough knowledge of the profession. hat that profession is, how-
eyer, must be doubtful; for surely a healthy, neighbourhood is not the
place that can afford every opportunity of studying medicine. -
CALIFORNIAN SLAVERY.
It seems to be a question, amongst the Americans whether or not
slavery shall be introduced into their newly-gotten territory of Cali-
fornia. Whilst this 5. is under discussion, the whole, immigrant
population of that El Dorado are in course of being reduced to a state
of utter servitude by that inveterate and notorious old tyrant-Gold.

A WERY SERIOUS NUISANCE.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
cº
“I was an Undertaker. I have just retired from business,
with a fortune of some thousands of pounds, half of which it is my inten:
tion to lay out, as, conscience-money, for the relief of widows and
orphans, since my ill-gotten, wealth has been principally derived from
impositions practised on such bodies. -
“The occasion on which our services are required is generally one of
overwhelming affliction and distraction of mind; whence we are left to
make whatever arrangements we please, with little restriction but that
of our own honesty; and I am sorry to say that I have always, taken
advantage, of this circumstance to run up as immoderate a bill as I
considered likely to be paid.
“For instance, when implored to conduct the affair intrusted to my
management in the cheapest manner compatible with decency, I have
made it amount to from twenty to forty pounds. I have charged thirty,
on an average, for a matter, involving, with some trifling extras, a
wooden box, a few yards of cloth and pairs of ſº the expense of
digging a hole, and two horses and six men for a day. To these,
when any license has been given me, I have added other items, at the
most extortionate rates for each, whereby I have frequently contrived
to swell the whole sum to several N. pounds.
“The thing, Sir, that we are hired to do, may be, and often is, done
effectually, to all intents and purposes, at the cost of a few shillings.
But this is when our customers are parochial authorities, who look
sharply after our proceedings, their minds not being influenced by grief,
but by an opposite feeling.
“We aggravate the most grievous of losses, add a pecuniary infliction
to a natural galamity, and increase the embarrassment of means too often
straitened . And wherefore ? To dispose of a chrysalis-case
which the butterfly has left, an egg whence the bird has flown.
“But, Sir, while I take all shame to myself for this iniquity—for
which I mean to atone—let me observe that the responsibility of it rests
ly upon society; for public opinion in some measure commands, the
sacrifice, of which we are the priests, and bereaved families the victims.
The world persists in seeing respectability in scarfs, and dignity in
plumes of feathers, and a tribute of affection in money flung into the
earth. . Therefore do we pay these wasteful honours to the “mortal
coil,’ which has been shuffled off by the immortal. And the spirits of
the wise’—who regard it as their cast-off clothing—“sit in the clouds
and mock us.” To them let the tribute be paid, in reverent memory,
which usually goes (in hard cash) only into the pocket of
“AN UNDERTAKER.”
A REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM.
SIR. R. INGLIS gave his opinion the other day in the House of
Commons, that “every colony ought to be a miniature England.” When
the worthy Baronet would carry out his views so far as Canada or New
South Wales, we are scarcely prepared to go all the way with him. We
do not see how our English establishments are to be adapted to colonial
use, nor do we understand how they are to be reduced to the proportions
suitable for their new and contracted locality.
Would SIR. R.INGLIs suggest a throne on the scale of one inch to a
foot of our own beloved piece of upholstery P. But even then, unless a
succession of royal ToM THUMBs could be found, it is difficult to say
where we are to get a duodecimo edition of sovereigns. There shoul
on SIR. R.INGLIS’s principle, be in every colony a House of Lords and
House of Commons in little; but these bodies sometimes make them-
selves so very little in England, that the operation of making anything
smaller on the same pattern would be impossible. Whatever reductions
it may be necessary to make in the public service, we fear that there is
à d deal at home which has already reached a minimum point of
littleness; and therefore, to make less of the same thing would be a task
not capable of accomplishment.
Curious Erratum.
. THE Editor of a country paper, speaking of the people of France, says,
in a beautiful ...i. er: “When the Provisional Government
promised the labouring classes that they should never again want either
work, or high wages, them asses actually believed it.”
We thought this rather strong, and a little ungrammatical, when the
next week’s paper contained the following:—
ERRATUM.–For “them asses” in our fº. read “the masses.”
However, there is a deal of coarse truth wraptup in a bit of bad gram-
mar sometimes. For ourselves, we decidedly prefer “them asses.”
THE FEMALE PREROGATIVE Court.—A Woman's Will knows no
codicil.
REDUCTIONS IN THE ARMY.
Among the reductions, already ºd
upon—by ourselves if by nobody else—
we are happy to be enabled, from the
very best authority—our own—to
state that the “terrific sentry duty’.
at the Park gates, will be performed
by a troop of light canvas infantry,
consisting of picked men from the
Native Scotch Rapees, who have been
engaged in the snuff service of London,
and who, it is thought, may at a pinch
be drafted into the service of the
nation.
It is true that these substitutes for
the household troops may not stand
fire so well as the existing corps; but
as they are required rather to stand
water in the pelting showers of rain
that occasionally damp the courage of
the stoutest heart and the thickest
coat, it is imagined that the canvas
soldiery, fortified with three coats of
oil-paint, will admirably serve the pur-
pose of Park sentinels.
With respect to the well-known
equestrian boxes at the Horse Guards,
it is understood they will be let as
sweetstuff shops, or muffin-manufac-
tories; for the military authorities
have at last come to the resolution, that there is nothing, after all,
so formidable in the Parliament Street cabstand, as to require that
it should be perpetually “commanded ” by the blunderbusses of two
mounted guardsmen, as has been the case in our own recollection for
the last twenty years. Those two mounted heroes who have occupied
the sentry-boxes in question, were never known to draw their swords
against anything but the cabs; nor were they ever seen to turn their
eyes—and then only “in the way of kindness”—upon anything more
terrible or unnerving, than the nursery maids who are attracted to the
district by the magnificent prospect held out to them. The horses, who
never could see the fun of standing for two hours, under a couple of
porticos, will be delighted to get their release from the ignoble position
they have hitherto occupied. Altogether, our plan of military retrench-
ment is, we think, so well adapted both for “man and beast,” that
we recommend it with the utmost confidence to the Government.
An Odious Comparison.
“MR. PUNCH,-I see one of you Britishers has bin and published a
book which he calls America Compared with England. Well now !
only to think of the conceit of some people. I estimate that are vollum
carries an ontruth upon the title page, and ort to have a pictur of
BARON MUNCHAUSEN for a frontispiece. It says what aint possible.
There can't be no comparison at all atween your little crumpet of an
island and our free and enlightened Republic. “JoNATHAN.”
A QUEER QUALIFICATION.
“WANTED,” says an advertisement, addressed to hatters, in one of
the papers, “a respectable married man, to take the management of a
ºil shop. One j. can finish and º off would be preferred. ... None
but those with good reference as to honesty, &c., need apply.” The
ability, “to tip off” being a recommendation, the &c., we presume, are
not to include sobriety.

admiration of the Honourable Member's coolness, in telling the House,

IRISH “ergos” are like Irish echoes, what goes before bearing about
the same relation to what follows in each. MR. GRATTAN is the PADDY

Tuesday week, “in the character of the people of Ireland to disqualify
them for the enjoyment of liberty—
“‘The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.’”
Argal, “ourselves,” in the mouth of PADDY BLAKE GRATTAN does not
mean “ The People of Ireland.”
“It is not our own fault,” says MR. GRATTAN's assertion. -

witness, “Did you ever see a panther º; a lady pickaback?” The

urrey Zoological; or perhaps the stuffed animal from the British
Museum, being more capable of feminine endorsement, might have
afforded more direct evidence of verisimilitude than the living creature |
without his burden, There would have been some difficulty in leading
such a witness as the panther; and indeed, to put him in the box at
would have been a grand effort of ushership. In a celebrated horse
case, it will be remembered one of the parties failed because he did not
produce the horse; and, by a parity of procedure, the plaintiff might,
we think, have been called upon to produce his panther. -

TWO OR THREE THEATRES AT PARIs.
F. one may read the history of a people's morals in
its jokes, what a queer set of reflections the philo-
sophers of the twentieth century may make re-
garding the characters of our two countries in
perusing the waggeries published on one side and
the other | When the future inquirer shall take
up your volumes, or a bundle of French plays, and
contrast the performances of your booth with that
of the Parisian theatre, he won’t fail to remark
how different they are, and what different objects
we admire or satirise. As for your morality, Sir, it
does not become me to compliment you on it before
your venerable face; but permit me to say, that there never were before
published in this world so many, volumes that contained so much cause
for laughing, and so little for blushing; so many jokes, and so little harm.
Why, Sir, say even that that modesty, which astonishes me more and more
every time I regard you, is calculated, and not a virtue naturally inherent
in you, that very fact, would argue for the high sense of the public
morality among us. We will laugh in the company of our wives and
children: we will tolerate no indecorum: we like that our matrons and
girls should be pure. - -
Excuse my blushes, Sir; but permit, me to say that I have been
making a round of the little French theatres, and have come away
amazed at the cynicism of people. . Sir, there are certain laws of
morality (as believed by us at least) for which these people no more
care than so many Qtaheitans. They have been joking against marriage
ever since writing, began—a pretty man would you be, Mr. Punch, if
you were a Frenchman; and aJºš moral character would be the
§º spotless wife of your affections, the chaste and immaculate
way
After going to these theatres, seeing the houses all full, and hearing
the laughter ringing through every one of them, one is puzzled to know
what the ple respect, at all, or what principle they do believe in.
They ...; at religion, they laugh, at chastity, they, laugh at royalty,
they laugh at the Republic most pitilessly of all: when France, in the
lece
ed the Foire aur Idées, says she is º nine hundred
octors, to each of whom she is paying a daily fee of five-and-twenty
francs, there was a cheer of derision through the house; the Communists
and their schemes were hooted with a still more hearty indignation;
there is a general smash and bankruptcy of faith; and, what struck me
perhaps most as an instance of the amazing progress of the national
atheism, is to find that the theatre audiences have even got to laugh at
tary glory. They have a song in one of the little plays, which
announces that, France and Co. have closed that branch of their
business; that they wish to stay at home and be quiet, and so forth;
and, strange to say, even the cry #. perfidious England has die
out; and the only word of abuse I read against our nation, was in a
volume of a novel by poor old PAUL DE Kock, who saluted the Lion with
a little kick of his harmless old heels.
Is the end of time coming, Mr. Punch, or the end of Frenchmen? and
don’t they believe, or love, or hate anything any more? Sir, these funny
ieces at the plays frightened me more than the most blood-thirsty melo-
ma ever did, and inspired your humble servant with a melancholy
which is not to be elicited from the most profound tragedies. There is
something awful, infernal almost, I was going to say, in the iety with
which the personages of these satiric dramas were dancing and shrieking
about among the tumbled ruins of ever so many ages and traditions. i
hope we shall never have the air of God Save the King set to ribald words
amongst us—the mysteries of our religion, or any man's religion, made
the º; of laughter, or of a worse sort of excitement. In the famous
iece of La Propriété cºest le Wol, we had the honour to see ADAM and
yº dance a º: and sing a º quite appropriate to the costume in
which they figured. #. aughed and enjoyed it—neither Eve
nor the audience ever thought about being ashamed of themselves, and,
for my part, I looked with a vague anxiety up at the theatre roof, to scé
that it was not falling in, and shall not be surprised to hear that Paris
goes the way of certain other cities some day. They will go on, this
retty little painted population of Lorettes and Bayadères, singing and
ancing, laughing and feasting, fiddling and flirting, to the end, depend
upon it. But enough of this theme: it is growing too serious—let us
drop the curtain. Sir, at the end of the lively and ingenious piece called
the Foire aur Idées, there descends a curtain, on which what is supposed
to be a huge newspaper is painted, and which is a marvel of cynicism.
I have been to see a piece of a piece called the Mystères de Londres,
and most awful mysteries they are indeed. We little know what is
going on around and below us, and that London may be enveloped in a
vast murderous . and that there may be a volcano under our
very kitchens, which may low us all to perdition any day. You perhaps
are not aware, Sir, that there lived in London, some three or four years
ago, a young Grandee of §º and Count of the Empire, the MARQUIs
or Rić's Nto by name, who was received in the greatest society our
country can boast of, and walked the streets of the metropolis with
WOL. XVI.
orders on his coat and white light º: and a cocked hat. This
Marquis was an Irishman by birth, and not a mere idle votary of
leasure, as you would suppose, from his elegant personal appearance.
§. the mask of fashion and levity he hiſ a mighty design; which
was, to free his country from the intolerable tyranny of England. And
as England's distress is Ireland's opportunity, the Marquis had imagined
a vast conspiracy, which shoul º the former, into the most
exquisite confusion and misery, in the midst of which his beloved Erin
might get her own. For this end his Lordship had organised a
prodigious band of all the rogues, thieves, and discontented persons in
the metropolis, who were sworn into a mysterious affiliation, the mem-
bers of which were called the “Gentlemen of the Night.” Nor were
these gentlefolks of the lower sort merely—your Swell Mob, your Saint
Giles's Men, and cracksmen. Many of the principal merchants,
jewellers, lawyers, physicians, were sworn of the Society. The merchants
forged bank notes, and uttered the same; thus poisoning the stream of
commerce in, our great commercial city: the jewellers sold sham
diamonds to the Aristocracy, and led them on to ruin: the physicians
called in to visit their patients poisoned such as were enemies of the good
cause, by their artful prescriptions: the lawyers prevented the former
from being hanged: and the whole realm being plunged into anarch
and dismay by these manoeuvres, it was evident that Ireland woul
greatly profit. This astonishing Marquis, who was supreme, chief of
the Society, thus had his spies and retainers, everywhere. The police
was corrupted, the magistrature tampered with—THEMIs was bribed on
her very bench: and even the BEEFEATERs of THE QUEEN (one shudders
as one thinks of this), were contaminated, and in the service of the
Association. - - -
umbers of lovely women of course were in love with the Marquis,
or otherwise subjugated by him, and the most beautiful and innocent of
all was disguised as a Countess, and sent to Court on a Drawing-room
day, with a mission to steal the diamonds off the neck of LADY BROMPTON,
the special favourite of His GRACE PRINCE DIMITRI Tolstoy, the
Russian Ambassador. -
Sir, His Grace the Russian Ambassador had only lent these diamonds
to Lady B., that her Ladyship might º them at the Drawing-room.
The jewels were really the property of the Prince's Imperial Master.
What, then, must have been His Excellency’s rage when the brilliants
were stolen? The theft was committed in the most artful manner.
LADY BRoMPTON, came to Court, her train held up by her jockei.
SUZANNA (the Marquis's emissary) came to Court with her train
similarly borne by her page. The latter was an experienced pickpocket—
the pages were ãºfile jewels were taken off LADY BROMPTON's
neck in the antechamber of the palace—and His GRACE PRINCE
ToLSToy was in such a rage that he menaced war on the part of his
Government unless the stones were returned!
Beyond this point I confess, Sir, I did not go, for exhausted mature
wii bear no more of the Mysteries of London, and I came away to
my hotel. But I wish you could have seen the Court of St. James,
the Beefeaters, the Life-Guards, the Heralds-of-Arms in their tabards
of the sixteenth century, and, have heard the ushers on the stairs
shouting the names of the nobility as they walked into the presence of
the Sovereign I caught those of the Countess of DERBY, the LADY
CAMPBELL, the LoRD SoMEBODY, and the HoNouBABLE Miss TREvoR,
after, whom the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY came. O, such an
Archbishop! He had a velvet trencher cap profusely ornamented with
black fringe, and a dress something like our real and venerated prelates,
with the exception of the wig, which was far more curly and elegant;
and he walked by, making the sign of the Cross with his two fore-
ers, and blessing the pºli
hear that the author of this great work, M. PAUL FEval, known
for some time to the literature of his country as SIR FRANCIs TRoLLope
passed a whole week in London to make himself thoroughly acquainted
with our manners; and here, no doubt, he saw Countesses whose
trains were carried by jockeys; Lords going to Court in full-bottomed
wigs! and police magistrates in policemen's coats and oilskin hats, with
white kerseymere breeches and silk stockings to distinguish them from
the rank and file. How well the gentlemen of Bow Street would look
in it ! I recommend it to the notice of Mr. Punch. -
These, Sir, are all the plays which I have as yet been able to see in
this town, and I have the honour of reporting upon them accordingly.
Whatever they may do with other pieces, I don't think that our
dramatists will be disposed to steal these.
LARGE OUTLAY, BUT NOT THE SMALLEST RETURN.
THE Irish are very ungrateful. Like the Bourbons, they will learn
nothing and they will forget nothing. ...They take all you give them, but
as for any return, you might as well expect to have your soverei
back when once §e º with it to Joseph ADY. They are the
most ungrateful people that ever went a-begging. Give them what
ſou will, they always recur to past grievances, and ask for more...The
ish disposition seems really to be constituted for taking everything,
but forgiving nothing!

no doubt, among the extensive family of GREENs,
dating from Great Portland. Street, Portland Place, requests the co-operation of the
talists of *. and America, in carrying out a Balloon Railway between Washington
California. He must indeed be a more than PICKFoRD–that modern ATLAs who carries
nearly half the world on his shoulders—he must, we say, be a more than PickFoRD who could
succeed in “ º ” a Balloon Railway to California. The GREENs are, par ercellence,
the sons of air, the family of Aeronauts, and it is clear that we are right in our supposition as
to the GREENs being the parties to whom BRowNE would address himself. His advertisement
is characteristically distinguished, by an inflated style; and we have no doubt that if the
experiment r an interminable series of of wind, the inventor is quite capable of
supplying the whole of them. The scheme is to be free from tunnelling, cutting, or levelling
of any kind whatever, and 1000 miles per day is to be the ordinary rate ºf travelling.
The only desideratum for the accomplishment of this great object, is how to raise the wind
sufficiently for the purpose of giving the balloon a fair start; and hence the appeal to the
| capitalists of England and America. We think a better plan than the balloons might be
formed by the application of the speed of birds to the purposes of locomotion; and a sort of
Eagle Conveyance Company, for the employment of eagles, despatched *:::: a wire by means
of small rings attached to their legs, would give the swiftness so desirable in expeditions
to California.
We merely throw out the eagle as a hint to see which way the wind blows; and if the
ublic should catch the idea, we are now, in treaty with the English attorney of Louis-
NAPOLEON for the Alpine Eagle, who has been in retirement since his untoward expedition
to Bºulogne; but he may be put in training immediately, to show a working model of our
| Aquiline Railway to California.

FREE TRADE FOR FARMERS.
A NUMERous meeting of Agricultural Gentlemen, recently converted to the principle of
| Free Trade, was held yesterday at our rooms, 85, Fleet Street, Ourself in the chair. - -
MR.WUTTs, of Oatlands, was a man of few words. He used to be a Protectionist
when Protection was the order of the day. It was now gone goose; which would bring him
to his argument. What was sauce for goose was sauce for gander; what was fair for calico
was fair for crops. Free Trade was ..º. and so be it. He used to shout “Protection
to the Landed ſnterest!” for the future he meant to holler, “Free Trade for Farmers!”
| MR. BARNEs, of Rickford, had whistled at the plough. . That was no reason why he
shouldn't let others sing at the loom. Take off restrictions from trade, and welcome. But
| don’t keep up burdens on land. There was hops—a question which touched the pocket.
| They must have the duty off that. What he said of hops he would also say of malt; and malt
and hops brought him to beer; and now, as speaking was dry work; he should desire that
| beer might be brought to him. And badluck to aſ that tried to rob the poor man of that
wholesome ...; - - -
MR, STEER would say another word on malt. It was not only drink but meat., Let him
grow his meat "... and he would defy competition with any of your Tariff beef-your
PHARAQH's lean kine, or Yankees', or what ever you chose to call it...
‘MR. FAIRFIELD, of Stubblemere, would never cease grumbling till farmers were allowed
to cultivate whatever they chose, and turn it to
the best account. If the . corn-grower was
to compete with him, why not he with the foreign
planter? If so be he had a mind, why was he not
to be allowed to try and beat the sugar-producer
with beet-root?. He had heard of Justice for
Ireland—one point would be to let the Irish grow
tobacco. Free Trade legislators listened to only
one side of the question. They were lop-ear
like fancy rabbits.
MR. BucKLAND, talking of rabbits, thought
they were too much the fancy by half. Five of
them would eat more than a sheep, and spoil as
much again. One of the worst burdens on the
land was game; in fact, the e was “beggar-
my-neighbour.” Where strictly preserved, iñºre

sport to them, but it was death to others. Now,
as Protection to Agriculture was ſº up, there
should be no longer Protection for the vermin
that consumed the fruits of the earth.
A resolution was then put from the Chair, to
the effect that the farmers, having their eyes now
fully open to the advantages of Free H.
determined to have its benefits extended to them-
selves; and that, since i. are at length
wide awake, it behoves them to be up and stirring.

MISS BENIMBLE'S TEA-AND-TOAST.
MISS B. UPON PRIMROSES.--THENCE TO PARLIAMENT.--THENCE TO
SCOTLAND.—THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.—THE EDUCATED SOLDIER.—
LADY FRANKLIN.
MR. PUNCH,-A present from LovELACE (the
dear one of the Pelisse) has put into my
head all sorts of things. It’s no less than
a pot of primroses | Well aware as I am
that the mind of the giddy and unreflective
may see nothin in a pot of primroses but
threepence or fourpence in blossom, I can
read their leaves like any book. for what
does a pot of primroses—in course I mean
primroses in #.”. to the con-
templaytif hart? Why, lovely sermons !
Even MR. Montgum MERY, the author of
- Satin, can’t beat a primrose, with its sweet
sulfur tongue. Innocent little creturs! I can liken 'em to nothin so
well as gypsies come from country lanes and commons to tell fortins to
London folks. Don't larf, Mr. Punch, but upon my word and honour,
the sight of LovELACE’s primroses, with the spring feelins that come
with 'em, has made me feel quite tender. To you, Mr. Punch, who can
take your speshal trains and—as the Poet says—go with a whisk into
the stomack of the land,-why, a primrose is only a primrose—if, indeed,
it’s as much; but to a lone woman like me, a prisoner in London—
never so much as seein a bit of green xcept what I may bile for dinner,
—why, a pot of primroses comes upon me like old friends—playmates
when I was a gal. If, when MR. LovELACE gave in them }. at
the door, I didn’t see a sertin little garden and a bit of a field, with a
bed of fuzz bushes that I once knew so well—and all in them prim-
roses, why I don't live in Pimlico. (And, by the way, Mr. Punch, I
don't seem likely to live anywheres else; for folks void the house as if
it was aunted.)
By birth, Mr. Punch, I am—savin your presence—what low people
call a Cocknie. . And for this reason, the primrose is speshal dear to me,
as to Cocknies in general it should be. For, as I say, it tells, us, our
fortins for the season. The Primrose is the Éraid of the Š ring Fashuns
—and is, moreover, a sort of Court Nooseman. Suppose I was comin
out at a drawing room of St. James's : well, my hart would swell with
the primrose buds; for I should know that our Grashus QUEEN would
not open the Court afore the primroses was full-blown. Oh, Mr. Punch,
the primrose is the Cocknies’ Spring Almaynack, if only proper notice
was taken on it. When the primrose comes in, tippets may go out.
Agin; when, the primrose unfolds itself, doesn't the Opra think of
º Show me the fust primrose, and in a minute I know that
ENNY LIND–(and, by the way, I’m not suspishus; but I’d have that
young woman wº by the Pelisse in plane close. I only hope she
doesn’t want to sing away the Crown of Bºii with the harts of HER
MAJESTY's subjicks)—well, with the primrose I know that JENNY
LIN p 's a-coming out agin; for I don't believe in her goin to be married
and leavin us. i. peopl; Sir, would never permit it. They’d rise to
a man, and pull down the church, and—and serve him right—transport
the awdacious bridegroom.
And so, Mr. Punch, seein that the London season’s opened, I may
say, with the primroses, I thought it only dew to the flowers to call the
attenshun of your readers to what they signify. Depend upon it, Sir,
many a shopkeeper in the dead time wood give his ears only to see the
primroses. Well, now they’ve come in, let him be thankful for’em, and
so deserve all the luck they’ll bring him. The winter’s gone and
passed, and the sweet primrose, what is it but an int of spring trade, and
i." fashuns? When I look at the innosent flower, I feel convinc'd
that luck’s turn’d over a new leef.
'Pon my life, Mr. Punch, sometimes when I see the mothin that’s in
the noºsepapers, I'm struck with stonishment to know how you fill
your collums. And yet, if I may use a ſigger, you’re always a brick,
though with not a bit of straw. Only look at Parliment since my last.
Why; for what’s been said, it might, as well have been the Deaf and
Dumb Sylum. Not a º: ohasses in all the desert. To be sure, MR.
GRATTAN has tried to be droll; but it isn't in him; he’s as cold as a
clown without paint. And his cliquence, Sir, like some tatoes, why,
it won’t bile, flowry, let him do what he will. Praps it is acause, he
don't use salt. Howsomever, jest for the fun of the thing, I shouldn't
wonder if MR. GRATTAN served a writ upon the British Lion for the
ballance owed to Ireland, and, so I may say, druv BRITANNIA into her
own Gazette. It’s my belie , if he’d his own way, he’d take out of
the royal arms, the shamrock—(it isn't lucky, is it, that the emblem of
a people should have anything sham about it?)—the shamrock, the
thistle, and the rose,_and to show to the whole world what we owe to
Ireland, put in a I. Ö, Ü,

º of delite that Members of Parliment, if the new bill passes, are,
as he says, “not to be trusted with impunity.”. Well, if some of our
aunt's sisters was to come back from the Abbé, they’d never believe it.
Who'd ever have thought that, mongst other things, M.P. should be
made to mean, a Man who Pays?
Thistles, Mr. Punch, is lookin "%; 're gettin rayther alive in
Scotland. ...Why, I see that the Edinbur Post says that “Doctor
TRow ER, Bishop of the Episcopal communion, has excommunicated the
DUKE of ARGYLL!” Poor creetur ! Well, the time’s come agin to
cry, “Gop bless the DUKE of ARGYLL.” Don't they call excommuni-
cation “the thunder of the Church f * I thought it a sort of thunder
that, like, the old shot sarcenet, was gone clean out of fashun. But
what will the ijuke do with the thunder? will he put it in his
pocket, and take no notice of it? Or how will it fect him P Will it
transport him for ever and ever to England? Why, it brings to my
mind that bewtiful distitch—
“Strange such a difference should be
'Twixt Tweed-el dum and Tweed-el dee!”
A distitch as, I have no doubt, came up in the Scotch and English wars
to mark the two sorts of combytants on both sides the river. Still i
Doctor's thunder will prevent the Duke
doing ! Will it for ever and for ever cut him off his seat in church 2
And when that’s done, won't, it leave him a leg to stand on ? Why,
it’s plain this excommunication—accordin to the Bishop—sends the
Duke at once to old Scratch. In which case, are we not agin and agin
bound to cry “God bless the DUKE of ARGYLL?” These thunders of
the Church might be very well once upon a time; but now, it’s my
inion it’s a sort of thunder that ud be mone the worse for a little
ghtning.
I see, too, that the Town Council of Edinbur, for the sake of
morals, have shut up the Moniment of Nelson on Sundays; tryin to
prove that, after all, Nelson’s only an every-day individooal. There 's
no doubt Edinbur will be all the happier for the Town Council. For,
as I’ve heerd, it was shockin to know that on a Sunday—when all the
rest of the city was at prayers—there was a place where you might go
to ruin drinkin ginger beer, and fall agin and —as our first parents
fell–eatin apples. Seed-cakes, too—cakes with burning carraways in
'em—were . at hand inside the Nelson Moniment. Why, it was
a disgrace to the service; selling pop and pippins under the very shade
of a Naval Ero.
Talking of the Navy, Sir, I see theyre goin to edicate the Army; goin
to put the men over the heads of their officers. The Duke’s a goin to
have all the privates made gentlemen; but I think that Parliment had
better have a Committee on the matter fust, where I only wish upon that
pint they’d examine me. For look you here, Mr. Punch : edicate the
Army, and where’s our servants to get husbands? Stick up a private
sojer with grammar and jometry, and let him know all about triangles
and all that, -and in course, he will turn his nose up at a cook or a maid-of-
all-work. Catch him coming a bit lower than alady's maid, For praps a
overness. It’s very well to talk about the ignorance of the Army, but
i. the ignorance of the sojer, and what’s to become of the affections
of the housemaid Has F. M.
Punch,--I'm afeard not.
But turning from all these things, Mr. Punch, what a sweet bit in the
Times I’ve just come upon, about ÍAny FRANKLIN! If the parygraph
doesn't shine and smell among the rest of the print, like any flower! It's
a thing to settle and feed upon like any bee on any rose. Her Ladyship
—says the paper—is going all about, and was last at Hull, to send out º
the captins of the j all sorts of things for her dear husban
locked up so long in the ice. Well, I’m certain he’ll come back all
safe and sound—like a Prince out of an Enchanted Castle. It can't
be no otherwise. That dear woman—all over hope—with her wife's
heart beatin far away amongst mountains and mountains of ice-is better
than anything even in a Corkassian novel. , LADY FRANKLIN knows her
i. 's f safe; and in course he must be; and his wife's love—like a
fairy in a story—will serve to bring him back from them horrid rejuns
of ice and snow, and whales and white bears—home to his own fireside,
to be blest and to bless the good cretur that’s living for him.
'Pon my word, Mr. Punch, I don't know what we want with romances
and fairy tales, so long as we’ve the newspapers. And if you doubt me,
only read all about that sweet pilgrimage o Y FRANKLIN—and you’ll
think otherways. M. B.
Writisgton ever thought of this? Mr.
“ALEA JACTA EST.”
THE above quotation has been figuring lately in every French news-
paper. The ë. previous to their being turned out, shouted it every-
where. Now, as the dice, it seems, are already thrown, we prºpos, that
the national cry be changed into “Faites votre jeu, Messieurs.” There
is no knowing, from day to day, what may turn up in France, but we hope
the result will not be “Le Rouge pagne.” We mean, of course, the Red
Republicans, who are playing just at present the most desperate game,
.# are staking everything upon the hazard of the die.

THE WACANT GARTER,
It is evident, from the cost of the dignity,
we have reason to bless our stars we are not
all obliged to wear, Garters, when they are of
the expensive kind supplied to order by the

ing a thousand pounds, and returning no inte-

it is enjoyed...We had sooner enter the order of

stitute an Order of the Garter, we should take
for its motto, “List, List, oh ist,” for such is
the material that our garters have always been
made of; and we will never permit our knee to

their boots on a little boot-cleaning apparatus for five minutes; and,
though we ourselves should not hesitate to do so, it is because we always
take our stand on public grounds. We think the snuggest place to be
found for the carrying on of this process, is about the neighbourhood of
the Palace Court, where the ways, moreover, are generallyyery dirty; and
as some official or other is always sure to be º his foot in it, there
is no chance of a lack of employment in the cleaning line. It is, perhaps,
hopeless for the inhabitants of this quarter to go through their work with

Who would have believed that, Smithfield Cattle, Market, at which the public has been
holding its nose, holding its breath, and, in fact, holding everything but its tongue—which
has been for the last, three years clamouring for the abatement of the nuisance-who, would
believe that Smithfield Market is, after a sort of Civic Arcadia, into which the old
Cockneys turn the young Cockneys, for the benefit of its bucolic air, and its general salubrity?
A sort of prose Eclogue has just been delivered in praise of Smithfield by MEssRs. Dixon
AND Godson, the former of whom has been in the habit of turning out a tribe of Dixon ETTEs,
ºr little Dixºns, ſo the number of thirteen on fourteen-he don't exactly knºw which—into
the area of the Market, to snuff the breeze so º with the bouquet of bullocks, to inhale
the oxy oxygen, and sometimes, perchance, to take the air rather too literally, by being tossed
unexpectedly into it. There is no accounting for tastes, and it is evident that Dixon AND
Godson prefer their atmosphere, as some people like their game, namely, as “high”, as
ssible. We congratulate the fourteen young Dixons on the strength of their stomachs;
or it would be very awkward if their squeamishness should revolt against the malaria into
which their father is so fond of thrusting them. The little Dixons are evidently, so
thoroughly seasoned in disagreeable smells, that the more a place happens to be in bad
odour with all the rest of the community, the more anxious would the Dixon family be to
show their love for the locality.
We have heard of certain districts being distinguished as the Garden of England; and
Smithfield Market may, perhaps, be termed the Nosegay of London, into which some thirteen
QR fourteen Dixons are continually poking their noses, under the paternal auspices, while
MR. Godson looks upon the Market as a healthy, though not a fashionable promenade. We
do not yet anticipate for Smithfield a º in the popularity of the Parks, though MR.
Gonson evidently thinks that the com essence of all sorts of animal exhalations thrown
off from the beasts, alive and dead, must form an exquisite scent, which it is mere affectation
to stop one's nose at; and that the gore-gorged gutters of Smithfield ought to be the resort
of those who at present give the preference to the Parks at the West End, and the Gardens
at Kensington.
MR. Dixon is convinced that the stenches of Smithfield are favourable to the Dixon IAN
constitution, and he accordingly saturates his children in the nauseous steam, exposes them
to the exhalations, and gives them the vapours as frequently as possible. ere is nº
accounting for taste. me people luxuriate in snails, some eat one kind of rubbish and
others another; but all other vagaries of the appetite are thrown into the shade, by the
extraordinary goût of the Dixon family for the º effluvia “given off” by Smithfield and its
bestial occupants.
If Smithfield is really an Arcadia, let Gonson and Dixos repair thither like shepherd
swains, with their respective pipes, and let them put our observations into their pipes, if
they like, and smoke them at leisure.
SOMETHING BINDING ON The nobiLITY.
NONE but Lords are allowed to receive the Order of the Garter. We do not envy them,
for the Garter is generally considered a fitting ornament for calves. |
A RETIRING YOUNG MAN.
THE following advertisement, quite a little
bijon in its brilliant way, is taken word for word
from the North British Advertisers—
WANº. A PLACE OF SOLITARY RE-
TIREMENT, by a Person 30 years of age, who
wishes to exclude himself from all society and live as a
HERMIT, for any period not exceeding seven years, on
suitable terms.
Poor Hermit! What can have driven thee from
the world? Is it loss in railway shares, or dis-
appointed love? Is it a diº appetite, or
a lean, and hungry purse, that makes thee shun
the tables of the rich, and the many dainties of
this feasting world? Is it a confirmed hatred of
bill-discounters, or an antipathy to all male
dangers, or the fear of the cholera, or the dread of
a tall mother-in-law, that urges thee on to soli-
tude, where nought but thy own solitary shadow
can see thee? "
If thou art resolved on exclusion, seek an
engagement as box-keeper at the º Theatre.
Beyond an ºccasional draught, from, the doors
being opened once amonth, thou wilt beas much
removed from all contact with the outside world
as if thouwert the Beadle of the Exeter ‘Change
Arcade itself. Only, Hermit, hast thou well pon-
dered o'er thy plan? We are afraid thou must
be a terribly vain, conceited, selfish, egotistical
fellow; for what manywould pant for seven long,
uninterrupted years of his own society, unless he
were most deeply in love with i.;; Relent,
or take our word for it, deep as thy love may
be, thou wilt be falling out with thyself before
the second day's sun has gone to rest.

If you’ll be just returning
Above a hundred more,
By absentees expended,
From Erin's isle who roam,
Whose days had soon been ended
If they had stopped at home.
Take back your dirty money,
Your charity to PAT.
Och! but it’s mighty funny
To hear ye talk of that!
Your bounty—Phoo!—we'll mockit,
Reject it with one hand,
And with the other pocket
The thrifle we demand.

solving the problems proposed to them, we give the annexed clinching
replies to a }. of the interrogatories offered to those young ideas who
have been eager to shoot, or “fire away,” as we once heard it
graphically described by a learned individual now on the bench-then
on the back row of the Bail Court—in their arduous profession.
Common and Statute Law, and Practice of the Courts.
1. In case of any injury to a person, from which death ensues, is there
any mode by which compensation can be sought, and by what means,
and by whom, and against whom must it be? -
Ans. The Law is always liberal in offering compensation; but if the '
injured party is dead, the Law is a dead letter. He may, however, take .
his chance of a bill of revivor, if he has left anything to pay the bill; .
but, the debt of Nature having been once º it is not likely that
Nature will refund, or allow the injured party to appear by civil or any
other process. - -
2. Is there any and what property that cannot be taken in execution?
Ans. Heat, ". is one of the properties of molten lead, cannot be
taken in execution; but, semble that the property of ice may be takenin º

Equity and Practice of the Courts.
3.What is the effect upon the remedies of creditors of a decree in a
creditor’s suit?
Ans. The more degrees there are, the more remote will be the
remedies. Every fresh decree diminishes the fund available for paying
the creditors, and delays the time for the receipt of their money.
4. What is an equitable conveyance?
Ans. A cab whose driver only asks for the proper fare.

Miscellaneous. -
5. What is a beneficial occupation?
Ans. Selling roasted chestnuts in the streets is a beneficial occupation;
but a tradesman calling on MR. DUNUP for his “little account” cannot .
be said to be beneficially occupied. |
recent rebellion. “In fact,” he said, “the
Association had acted under the strictest sur-
veillance. There was an excellent, govern-
ment reporter constantly in attendance to

always present to watch their actions.”
With reporters in attendance to record
their words, and constables present to watch
their actions, much credit is due to himself
and his associates for abstaining from treason!

trusted accordingly...What confidence would

IRISH USES FOR ENGLISH MONEY.
ARCHBishop M'HALE and his suffragan
Bishops have addressed a pastoral letter to
their flocks, in which, after bitterly complain-
ing of Irish destitution, and utterly ignoring
the efforts of English charity to relieve it, they
urge those addressed to subscribe, out of
their necessity, in order to afford an indepen-
dence to the Pope. “And afterwards,” con-
cludes the document, we will have your
bounty carried to Rome.”
Parliament is called upon to vote £50,000
for the relief of Irish famine, and this grant—
as Goodness knows it is not the first, so
neither will it be the last of a series. We
are to give Ireland, who cannot feed herself
but can subsidize the Pope, £50,000, and

DISINTERESTED PATRONAGE.
THE QUEEN v. KENDALL AND OTHERS.
(To Mr. Punch.)
“DEAR MR. P., - - --
“IADDREss you, Sir, as a gent remarkable for impartiality.
I should decidedly say that you are a man of the people; at the same
time, I have observed that you are ever ready to give all due credit to
the nobs, when they deserve it.
“Allow me, Mr. P., to call your attention to a circumstance which
tells highly in favour of that superior class of individuals, as showing the
—I may say—particularly disinterested manner in which they dispose of
Fº Patronage, Sir, is reckoned as part of the fat of the land;
ut to those who possess it, it is, in point of fact, the very poorest
possible lean and no gravy.
, “No doubt you have noticed the case of the QUEEN v. KENDALI, and
others, lately decided in the Court of Queen's Bench. MºssRs. KEN:
DALL, AND Co. were indicted for the alleged sale of a cadetship, and
found guilty. The parties, some five in number, included a MRs. BINGREs,
to whom was paid the “stumpy” for procuring the commission, the figure
amounting to £1000. Mrs. B. obtained the cadetship by applying to
LADY RIPON, who begged it of my LoRI Do, her noble hub....So you
r, it cost the gent who purchased it—a MR. MooRE-É1000; it
see, Si
cost Mrs. B. nothing but a ‘'Thank your Ladyship and what fºrm
#. put in her pocket,
and LADY R. generously gave away, the said MRs.
*#. £1000.
“Thus, Sir, all this highly valuable patronage is dispensed by the noble
proprietors free gratis for nothing; although a º, party, by
abusing her influence with them, contrives to make £1000 by it. The
distinguished patrons must have known the worth of the article, and
therefore, to part with it as they did, was very handsome of them.
“LADY R. too, I should also say, is entitled to praise for keeping up a
connexion with a friend in distress; for MRs. B. was described as a lady
in diffs.; and, according to some of the witnesses, had not paid her milk-
score. I must say that this conduct of my Lady's is very much the
reverse of what is commonly attributed to #. heartless Aristocracy.
“Nevertheless, Sir, I to be allowed to t one little hint.
It ap that the cadetship was procured by a Mr. Moone speaking
to a º LAVERs, who s to a MRs. LINLEY, who ce to MRs.
BINckes, who spoke to LADY R., who, lastly, spoke to 1,0RD RIPON.
Now, really, I think that when nobs have patronage (value £1000) at
their disposal, they might as well inquire for some deserving object to
bestow it upon, instead of conferring it on a perfect stranger, at the
request of a third person, whose motive in asking for it is merely
mercenary. Of course, MRs. B. had a deserved interest with LADY R,
though tis a pity the nature of it did not transpire; and I rather think
you will agree with SERGEANT WILKINs in the observation, that ‘it
was much to be regretted that her Ladyship was not able to attend this
trial, as no doubt she would have been able to explain this transaction
in a manner which could not be expected from LoBD RIPON, who knew
little or nothing about it.” But shouldn't you or I, Mr. P., know what
we were about, if we were giving away a situation worth £1000?
“Sir, to you, with respectful compliments,
“A. BAGMAN.”
BUGEAUD'S COMMENTARIES “DE BELLO GALLICO.”
BUGEAUD has been addressing along tirade of Commentaries to his
Army, in which war is denounced with the most hearty violence. It is
strange that military gentlemen are the only ones who abuse their own
ing. The Barrister can praise his profession; the Doctor has a
great deal to say for his; and even the Lawyer has something to advance
in favour of the profession he follows;, but Generals generally, grow
eloquent in denouncing that from which they draw their daily bread.
There must be, therefore, something º horrible in a pursuit,
when the very persons who adopt it as a livelihood cannot help crying
out againstitſ We have seldom met with an officer who was fond of his
profession; and yet, much as it is abhorred, how few have the courage
to leave it! Can it possibly be the red coat and epaulettes that make
them cling to it? Dress your officers like policemen—give your soldiers
#. º elegant costume of butchers, and the Army would soon be at a
Count.
It is finery that makes half your soldiers—and stupidity the other
half. The latter will always exist as long as there is pipeclay; but the
Army could easily be stript of the former. In the meantime, as a
i. step towards removing the temptation for young, fools to enlist,
to be living targets for bullets, we recommend that cheap copies be
rinted of those passages of MARSHAI, Bugeaud's speeches, in which
le depicts the horrors of military and civil war. Englishmen do not
know so much of the latter accomplishment, but the former they are
perfectly well acquainted with, and to their cost, as is proved every
year by the Army Estimates.

THE FONETIC SOLUTION FOR HARD NAMES.
WE have received a long protest against the new method of spellin
as recently introduced by the Fonetic Nuz, which a good-natured frien
of ours has rather ill-naturedly called the Fanatic Nuz. This protest is
signed by several names, long established in the annals of English mis-
pronunciation, and they contend that if they have letters written to
them according to the Phonetic, or Fanatic, principle of writing, the
postmen will continually be committing all sorts of ridiculous mistakes,
and that notes and valuable remittances, intended, for them, will con:
stantly be delivered to persons who have not even the smallest nominal
title to them.
There is a ſº deal of probable truth in this complaint; and we can
feel acutely for the long-established proprietors of these aristocratic
names, if they are suddenly cut down from five or six syllables to only
one of two, and are thus put (literally speaking) upon ‘pay. It is
#. to consider how much they would lose in the eyes and ears of
tinction! How small and starved the following names look
when they are reduced to the smallest possible number of syllables!—
Qan, you imagine the noble CHQLMonpELEY sinking into.Chumlaº
Why, he would not know himself in that guise. A scion of that un-
pronounceable house would refuse a cheque, if made payable to Chumla.
Again, how would any one who had been christened MARJORIBANKs

* {
be able to recognise himself in the diminutive Margbanz & The great
St. John, also, would run away with fright from Cingin, WEMyss would
abjure Hims, and PEPYs have a horror of Pips, and the same fate would
attend hundreds of individuals, and a few towns also, who will madly
persist in º names the very reverse of what they are
spelt. So far, we embrace the principles of Foneticism, and would be
as great a Fanatic as the clever disciple who distinguished himself
lately by spelling an umbrella “A Numbrellr.” :
We advise the gentlemen whose complaints we have given a public
voice to, to reform their names themselves, and to pronounce them in a
manner, more consonant with their real spelling; and 'º'; remedy
º: escape being put into the Procrustean bed of MR. PITMAN's
alphabet, and coming out considerably less in print than they ever did
before. Voltairº said of the English, “They save two hours a day
by contracting all their words.” The Fonetic Nuz was not then in
existence. If we saved two hours in the days of Voltaire, we must save
six hours at least, now that we have our improved ſº of spelling as ori-
nally invented by WINIFRED JENKINs, and carried to its test height

MISS BENIMBLEPS TEA-AND-TOAST.
MIss B. Discusses, AT LENGTH, THE SCOTCH MARRIAGE BILL.
GRETNA-GREEN A “GLORIOUS INSTITUTION.”
PARLIAMENT,” Mr. Punch, like money, is
a necessary evil; there can be no doubt
of that... Still, when Parliament sets
} about taking all the romance, and loveli-
mess out of daily life—why, Sir, I am one
who think that Parliament itselfought to
be repealed. And in this case especial.
I aii. Mr. Punch, to Loºp CAMPBELL’s
Scotch Marriage Bill, which, seeing as it
meddles with the sweetest emotions of
the human heart, is taking a shameful
freedom with the liberty of the subject.
Let LoRD CAMPBELL have his way, and
there 'll be no more Gretna,Green mar-
riages. The Blacksmith may blow his fire
out, as far as chains of Hymen go, and
give himself up to the iron-work of common life. ever making
another wedding-ring, he may throw himself º horse-shoes.
This is shocking; and if Scotland knows its own rights, there isn't a
man, woman, and child as won’t rise against the Bill before it comes to
a head, and festers into a Law.
Moreover, Mr. Punch, LoRD CAMPBELL's Bill is only another of the
wicked, º bits of selfishness of men in common, to say j
of Lords Spiritual and Temperate. LoRD CAMPBELL, being marrie
himself, snaps his fingers at the Blacksmith. What does he care for the
rising generation?, Being a lawyer, what does he know of the inside
core of the human heart? But the Scotch Marriage Bill is what I call
a blow at high life; and there isn’t a young lady of seventeen—not a
gentleman of small means and lovely moustachios, as ought not to feel
the Bill an attack upon their mutual interests. Let Lord CAMPBELL
make marriage, uneasy—let him, inclose Gretna Green as if it was no
other than a vulgar common to harbour so many É. upon—let him
wipe out Scotland as, what MR. LovELACE calls, a harbour of refuge for
fly-away doves, and there must be an end of the Union. Speaking as
a woman who’s read the annals of her country, and therefore knows
the hysterical points of such weddings, I say that Gretna Green is the
brightest jewel, the richest emerald in the whole Scotch crown. Take
away Gretna Green, and you take º: that crown's value—without
the Blacksmith, it’s a crown not worth two-and-sixpence. -
Mr. Punch, five too near the QUEEN’s Palace not to have an in-
structive respect for those noble institutions of this county, May Fair
and Belgravia. Therefore, don't suppose I’m going to be a bit auda-
cious to the superior classes. Nevertheless, Truth, which at the same
time directs my pen and lives in my inkstand—ink being the well of our
times for Truth to live in-Truth, Mr. Punch, makes me declare my
belief that Gretna Green is a boom and a blessing to many sweet young
helpless creatures that, without the benevolence of the Blacksmith,
would run the risk of being married in state—a Bishop, for what anybod
can tell, binding the bargain. Yes, Mr. Punch, bargain is the word.
For don't we know that many a dear young thing—as beautiful as any-
thing painted by RAFFLEs hundreds a years since, in the National Qne
Sh Gallery—many a lovely little soul, made up of roses and lilies
with a look of violets and a smile of coral, would have been sold-sold
is the word, Mr. Punch—sold into the bonds of matrimony, as much a
matter of bargain as any negro virgin from the Banks of Guinea º Man
a dear young thing chained up to somebody old enough to be her grand-
father—only that there was Gretna Green holding out its arºus as a
refuge, and the Blacksmith, with a smile upon his face, ready at a
minute's notice to §§ a º
The more I consider this Abolition of the Blacksmith Bill, the more
I’m sure it’s the wicked work of a set of match-making mothers and
dowagers, who—altogether above the pomps and vanities of Gretna
themselves—have made a cat's-paw of the innocent LoRD John CAMP-
BELL-plain John, as there’s no denying he is—that they may, in an
case as may come up, make the best lawful penn'orth, at the church
altar, of some quiet, good little soul, who’d feel so § with love and
a cottage, when they will make her have a coronet with paralysis, or, at
best, with the worst form of winter cough, in a guitar.
It isn't for me, Mr. Punch, to name names; but I put it to your
memory, and to the amiable and feeling hearts of your readers, to count
of upon their fingers the good, nice, dear little souls, who've run
away at a minute's notice, with a little bundle in their hands (just a
night-cap and a hair-brush), and gone and got married to somebody who
was only agentleman, refusing to take a ‘. Prince or a German
Count, with sixty years on his back—and I don't know how many arms
* Mºs: Besixthle may observe that her orthography has been tampered with.
Whilst, however, Mr. Punch, ventures to reform Miss B.'s spelling, he would not
lay an irreverent pen upon her phraseology.
cut into quarters on his - panelling—flying in their parents’
aces, and caring nothing even i. the ; and J.
regret” of the Morning Post. Why, Sir, I look upon the Gretna Green
Blacksmith as the Last Appeal—(and I only wish MR. FRANK STONE
would paint him as such—for why shouldn’t we have two Last Appeals
the first being so melting?)—the Last Appeal of desperate love. And
more than that; the § ty Valve (if I may be allowed the boldness of
the term) of the peace of families! - - -
I believe, Mr. Punch, the only use of our Colonies is to provide
#. places for the poor and helpless members of the Aristocracy.
ndeed, it’s my belief, that a good many islands only rose up in the sea
as little snug spots for Lords and Honourables, and so forth, to set down
upon. If red hips and haws were made for the birds—why, in the like
way, islands were specially provided for the planting there of sprigs of
nobility. When Ceylon was made—there can be no doubt of it—it was
created only with a view to LoRD TORRINGTON. Well, Mr. Punch, in
like manner Gretna Green was made for younger brothers, and for
handsome virtuous young gentlemen without fortune. Abolish Gretna
Green, and is there to be no indemnity ? No Sinking Fund—or some-
thing of that sort—to give pensions to young bachelors whose yested
interests in the Blacksmith are shamef .. by LORD CAMP-
BELL?. Are beautiful young heiresses to be made matches impossible?
Henceforth, is no hi }*. to be thrown into despair, because my
LADY SoPHoNIsBA—defying her parents, has refused an old Count of
the Empire—and run off with nothing better than a perfect gentleman?
Is there to be no romance in life? Will an Ensign—withering the mother
Marchioness into dust and ashes—ever again elope with a nobleman's
daughter? Now, what will be the consequence? Abolish Gretna Green,
and you’ll send lovers to France; repeal the Blacksmith, and you throw
all the secret wº trade intº the hands of the forei ner.
I was very glad to find that the EARL OF ABERDEEN, like a true
Scotchman, stood up for Gretna Green. Things hadf'. on very well
with Gretna Green-Gretna Green had done very well for some of our
great-grandmothers—and why shouldn't, it be continued through all
#. ? Why put down, what I will take the liberty of calling the
armonious Blacksmith?
In course, LoRD BRough AM was for the Bill. And why? Because,
he said, in the present state of things there were thousands of folks in
Scotland who §. know whether they were married or not. Well,
and what of that? Doesn’t it afford a great subject of hope?, When
in doubt, play your honours! . But this was the most cowardly thing
of oRi, BROUGHAM spoke up for the Bill, because he said almost
as good as this—that any designing woman in Scotland might, if she
liked, so to speak, whip a man off his feet, and marry him whether he
would or not. A wicked, designing woman, had only to make a man's
whisky, toddy a little strong—only to inveigle him to say—“This
woman’s my wife,” and matrimony, as sudden as any other shocking
accident, fell upon him.
Well, Mr. Punch, allowing this to be so, what of it? Are the lords
of the creation to enjoy—in the matter of love—what I will be bold to
call, a monopoly of deceit? . Suppose that a thousand men have been
married against their will, in Scotland, since the Union—(and I only
wish LoRD ABERDEEN would move for a return of 'em)—what’s a
thousand victims on our side, against the falsehood and the wickedness at
large of the stronger creature? Why, it’s hardly a set-off at all; and
any man (who is a man) ought to be ashamed to speak of it. Why, it’s
a beautiful thing to know that in Scotland—if nowhere else—a man with
all his eyes about him is, when we like, a yery little more than one of
ourselves anywhere else—I mean a defenceless and unprotected creature.
I thought, Mr. Punch, to ask your opinion upon the Jew Bill, but
am pressed for time. However, it is a sweet thing to know that
MR, PLUMETRE and CoLoREL SIFTHORP, at BELIAMy's—over a ham-
sandwich—have agreed to quit Parliament directly the Jews enter it.
And who'd ever have thought of Jews going to Court? and yet last
week there was SIR Moses MonTEFIORE at St. James's, where HER
MAJESTY held her first Levy of the season.
I was delighted to see that the Dutch dwarf, ADMIRALVon TRUMP
has followed Hamlet very close at Court. This was to be expected
as the mat’ral course of things. -
By the way, Mr. Punch, fee by the Haymarket Fº brought
me by LovELACE, that “Othello is to be revived on, Monday !”
Revived Well, after that, the manager must go down all playhouse
history as the Genuine Black Reviver. M. B.
“Honours don't Count.”
WE can hardly understand the great favour there is presumed to
be shown in presenting a man with the “Garter.” When can a person
do with one garter? Man, like a music-stool, does not stand upon one
leg. We have always cherished the belief that garters, like pedestrians
in a foot-race, never run less than two together. ... We are inclined to
believe that the honour must have been originally intended for the
exclusive, benefit of persons with wooden legs, and who, consequently,
would only require one garter.

honourable Members might keep their breath, not to cool their po
but for their duties to their constituents. (A laugh). But he regrett
to see one honourable Member at that moment with a hot pie. (“Name
name.”) There was no use in the honourable Member's t to conceal
the article with his napkin. (Loud cries of “Name, name.”) He regretted
to be obliged to name his friend, the Member for Crewe. (Groans).
The honourable Member rose with some warmth, but SIR R. PEEL
continued—
Why, the pie was smoking under the very nose of the House, at that
moment. #. begged to move that the pie be impounded, and the wife
of the honourable Member be placed at the bar, as guilty of a gross
breach of the dinner declaration.
The honourable Member for Crewe wished to explain (“No 1 No!”)
At all events, he trusted he should be allowed an extra five minutes.
It was worse than dining at the Wolverton station. (A laugh). He had
only eaten half his regular time when so audaciously assailed by the
honourable Baronet. (“Order, Order.”)
A motion was then put and secondéd, that the honourable Member
for Crewe be reprimanded and put on the House diet, of bread and water,
for a week, and the pie impounded. -
The debate on the Gold Standard Abolition was then resumed.

convening an assembly at the Upper Ship Hotel, at twelve o'clock, for

alternately cooling his heels in expectation, and warming them at the
fire. After the lapse of three quarters of an hour, two farmers were
with difficulty squeezed into the room, and in another hour five more;
so that by dint of great compression it was ultimately made to accom:
modate altogether eight persons. A conversation occurred on the
subject of Protection; but it took no definite shape; and although reso-
lutions had been prepared, and a memorial drawn up, it was judged
inexpedient to submit them to so crowded an assembly; and accordingly
this vast concourse, exceeding in number even the celebrated triad of
Tooley Street, quietly separated, without coming to any other conclusion.

SONG IN FAVOUR of SMITHFIELD.

on the occasion of A RECENT WISIT TO THAT
SALUBRIOUS LOCALITY.
Ata-"The Sea - The sea tº
THE Field! the Field! the old Smithfield!

Without a mark, without a bound,
A grateful odour runneth round;
It gets in the nose, it tickles the eyes,
Or underneath the mouth it lies.
I’m in Smithfield! I’m in Smithfield!
I am where each disease is heal’
With the smells above, and the dirt below,
And animals wheresoe'er you go.
If an oxshould send one an awkward leap,
What matter! Ifall among the sheep!
I love, oh, how I love to inhale
The odours waſted on every gale,
When some mad bullock towards the moon
Is tossing aloft some hapless loon;
Who, after quitting the world below,
Comes back again with an awful blow.
Ine'er was on Margate's dull sea-shore,
But I loved old Smithfield more and more,
And backwards flew to her dirty pens,
As chickens seek their parent hens;
And a mother she was and is to me,
For I was born in Bartlomee.
The oxen were active with hoof and horn,
In the noisy hour when I was born;
And the drovers whistled,thebutchersswore,
As the dogs kept bark- -

THE TERRA INCOGNITA OF LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS.
QUR enterprising contemporary.the Builder, who has managed to
build up a º reputation on public grounds, has lately advertised the
expediency o Fº that hitherto unknown region, the inclosure
of Lincoln's Inn Fields. It is certainly the metropolitan Bush, into
which no one has ever yet ventured, and differs from Leicester Square
in so much as the latter, such as it is, presents a waste visible to the
naked eye, while the inclosure of Lincoln's comprehends a tract
whose geography is beyºnd comprehension, and whose actual condition
is unknown to the world by which it is surrounded., Tradition speaks
of its containing water as well as wood within its umbrageous recesses,
but nothing certain is known; and we suspect that the only sure mode
of settling the point is to send a regularly qualified surveyor into the
district, for the purpose of making a * on the Botany, ź. and
other natural features of the place, with a map of its surface. Rumour,
who, though not exactly a WYLD in its maps, is often wild enough in its
imagination, has already drawn a plan, which the annexed engraving
would about realise.

northern quarter of the mysterious region. The only inhabitants are
believed to belong to the feline or feeline race,—a conjecture quite in
accordance with the legal air that pervades the neighbourhood.
We strongly recommend the Government to authorisesome PARRYor
Ross to penetrate into these wilds; which, by the way, are approached
from the west through Little Wildstreet—a nominal coincidence we
throw out for the benefit of the archaeologian and the philologist,

Two architects were º at the new front of Buckingham Palace.
The one abused it very strongly, and the other praiseditjust as warmly.
“What can you see in it to ire?” inquired the first. “It is not
what I see, but what I donofsee,” said the second; “it has the beauty
of hiding the remainder of the building. I callit a clean front put on
to make the best of an indifferent shirt.”
THE LUNATIC (ECCLESIASTICAL) COMMISSIONERS.
THAT Commission upon Commission has been appointed } the pre-
sent, Government, is a general complaint. Nevertheless, Mr. Punch
must beg the Loºp CHANGELLOR to institute one more Commission on
another. It is absolutely necessary that a Commission de lunatico
inquirenda should be forthwith issued, to inquire touching the state of
mind of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The necessity of this step
will be manifest from the subjoined newspaper paragraph:-
*The Ecclesiastical Commission has authorised the tºº. on episcopal
residences, of the following sums:-Palace at Ripon, £13,689; purchase of land and
houses for the Bishop or Gloucestes, £11,000; alteration of a house for him,
£11,897; purchase of estate and house for the Bishop of Lincoln, e39,406; altera-
tion of a house for him, Els, 302; purchase of estate and house for the Bishop or
Rochestra, E25,557; alteration of residence of the Bishop or Woncestºn, ETOOO .
alteration of residence of the Bishop or Oxford, £6,469.”
Punch, although unwilling to prejudge, any case whatever, has no
hesitation in saying that he believes it will be proved that the Ecclesi-
astical Commissioners labour under the most extraordi delusions;
in fact, he does not scruple to state, upon his own authority, what some
of these hallucinations are...The Ecclesiastical Commissioners have
been long possessed with the persuasion that every Bishop is the
GreatMogul, and cannot possibly be accommodated in any residence
inferior to a palace. They are also impressed with the imagination that
each prelate is a jewel—perhaps because there was formerly a celebrated
one of that name—and consequently ought to be set in a valuable
casket. With this chimera is combined another, namely, that the
walls of episcopal residences have not only ears, but tongues, and thus
are º capable of ing, and giving spiritual instruction to an
amount commensurate with their extent of surface. In short, they are
all afflicted with one common mania on the subject of Bishops' Palaces;
º: has arisen their insane alacrity to rush into episcopal brick-
and-ma onn.
Now, when it is considered that there are churches to be built, and
small livings to be augmented, and that º incumbents, with their par-
sonages in ruins, are obliged to repair their dwellings at their own cost,
it is evident that nothing but mere midsummer madness can have in-
duced these Commissioners to throw away £128,320 on buil for
Bishops. They have been rearing an Abode of Bliss for RIron, a Bower
of Beauty for GloucestER, a Temple of Fancy for LincoLN, a Shrine of
Splendour for RochestER, a Walhalla for Worcester, an Alhambra for
Qxford, and, it is to be feared, a Castle of Idolence for some others. In
the mean time, the charitable are on the point of advertising for Model
Lodging Houses for the Industrious Clergy. -
It is apparent that these said Commissioners are, and have been for a
; of unsound mind, and wholly incapable of managing ecclesias-
allºs.

YOUR SYMPATHY IS REQUESTED
For the numerous Chairmen of the Railway Companies, who, in º;
lately their very uneasy positions, have been subjected to all sorts &
uestions and annoyances from vexatious shareholders, and have
their sweet tempers sorely tried by the repeated interruptions, not to
say oppositions, which they have received in the discharge of their
arduous duties, from interested parties, who would not be convinced
that they were in the wrong, and that the Company to which they had
the honour of belonging was in the right.
What the Chairmen must have suffered at the several adjourned
meetings, no human pen, can imagine, much less describe; and it is
therefore earnesty hºped that the British public, which was never
known to be backward in the cause of real benevolence, will exercise
their warmest sympathies in their behalf, and never cease to pity this
poor, jº but enduring and most useful body of men, for the
sufferings they have recently endured in the investigation of truth, the
painfulness of which can only be repaid with pity. With this humane
object, all the Railway Offices will be opened as usual; and the smallest
sympathy will be most gratefully received by any of the Chairmen
on view.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON SOME DINNERS AT PARIS.
oME few words about dinners, my
dear friend, I know your benevo-
lent mind will expect. A man who
comes to Paris without directing
his mind to dinners, is like a fellow
who travels to Athens without
caring to inspect ruins, or an indi:
vidual who goes to the Opera, and
misses JENNY LIND's singing.
No, I should be ungrateful to that
appetite with which Nature has
bountifully endowed me—to those
recollections which render a con-
sideration of the past so exqui-
site, an enjoyment to me—were I
to think of coming to Paris with-
out, enjoying a few quiet evenings
at the Trois Frères, alone, with a
few dishes, a faithful waiter who
knows you of old, and my own thoughts; undisturbed by conver:
sation, or having to help the soup, or carve the turkey for the lady of
the house; by the exertion of telling jokes for the entertainment of the
company; by the ennui of a stupid neighbour at, your side, to whom
you are forced to impart them; . the #. of hearing an opposition
wag talk better than yourself, take the stories with which you have
come primed and loaded, out of your very mouth, and fire them off him-
self, or audaciously bring forward old JoE MILLERs, and get a laugh
from all the company, when your own novelties and neatest impromptus
and mots pass round the table utterly disregarded.
“I rejoiced, Sir, in my mind, to think #. I should be able to dine
alone; without rivals to talk me out, hosts or ladies to coax and wheedle,
or neighbours who, before my eyes (as they often have done), will take
the best cutlet or favourite snipeout of the dish, as it is handed round,
or to whom you have to give all the breast of the pheasant or capon,
when you carve it.
“All the way in the railroad, and through the tedious hours of night,
I whiled º such time as I did not em loy in sleeping, or in thinking
about Miss BR-wn, (who felt, I think, by the way, some little º in
parting with me, else why was she so silent all night, and why did she
apply her pocket-handkerchief so constantly to her lovely, amethyst
§. ?—all the way, in the railroad, I say, when not occupied by other
thoughts, I amused the tedium of the journey by inventing little bills
of fare for one,—solitary Barmecide banquets, which I enjoyed in spirit,
# ºpºd to discuss bodily on my arrival in the Capital of the
luchen.
“‘Monsieur will dine at the table d'hôtef' the laquais de place said
at the Hotel, whilst I was .# my elegant toilette before stepping
forth to renew an acquaintance with our beloved old city. . An expres-
sion of scornful incredulity shot across the fine features of the person
addressed by the laquais de place. My fine fellow, thought I, do you
thinki am come to Paris in order to dine at a tails ºf to meet
twenty-four doubtful English and Americans at an ordinary?, ‘LU-
CULLUs dines with LUCULLUs to-day, Sir;’ which, as the laquais de place
did not understand, I added, ‘I never dine at a table d'hôte, except at an
º -
“I had arranged in my mind a little ". week of dinners. Twice
or thrice, thinks I, I will dine at the Frères, once at WERY's, once
at the Café de Paris. If my old friend VoIsIN opposite the Assomption
has some of the same sort of Bordeaux which we recollect in 1844, I
will dine there at least twice. PHILIPPE's, in the Rue Montorgueil,
must be tried, which, they say, is as 'good as the Rocher de Cancale
used to be in our time: and the seven days were chalked out already,
and I saw there was nothing for it but to breakfast & la fourchette at
some of the other places which I had in my mind, if I wished to revisit
all my old haunts.
“To a man living much in the world, or surrounded by his family,
there is nothing so good as this solitude from time to time—there is
nothing like communing with your own heart, and giving a calm and
deliberate judgment upon the great question—the truly vital question,
I may say—before you. What is the use of having your children, who
live on roast mutton in the nursery, and think treacle-pudding the
summit of cookery, to sit down and take the best three-fourths of a
perdreau truffé with you? What is the use of helping your wife, who
doesn’t know the difference between Sherry and Madeira, to a glass of
riceless Romanée or sweetly odoriferous Chateau Laffitte of '42?
Poor dear soul! she would be as happy with a slice of the children's
joint, and a cup of tea in the evening. She takes, them when you are
away. To give fine wine to that dear creature, is like giving pearls to—
to animals who don’t know their value.
“What I like, is to sit at a Restaurant alone, after having taken a
ass of absinthe in water, about half-an-hour previous, to muse well over
the carte, and pick out some little dinner for myself; to converse with
the sommelier confidentially about the wine—a pint of Champagne, say,
and a bottle of Bordeaux, or a bottle of Burgundy, not more, for your
private drinking. He goes out to satisfy your wishes, and returns with
the favourite flask in a cradle, very likely. Whilst he is gone, comes old
ANToINE, who is charmed to see Monsieur de retour; and yows that
you rajeunnissez tous les ans, with a plate of oysters—dear little juicy
green oysters in their upper shells, swimming in their sweet native brine,
not like your great white flaccid natives in England, that look as if they
had been fed on pork: and ah! how kindly and º that attention is
of the two little plates of radishes and butter, which they bring you in,
and with which you can dally between the arrival of the yarious dishes
of your dinner; they are like the delicate symphonies which are .
at the theatre between the acts of a charming Comedy...A little bread-
and-butter, a little raddish—you crunch, and relish—a, little raddish, a
little piece of bread-and-butter—you relish and crunch—when lo! up
goes the curtain, and ANTOINE comes in with the entrée or the roast.
“I pictured all this in my mind and went out. I will not tell any of
my friends that I am here, thought I. Sir, in five minutes, and before I
had crossed the Place Vendôme, I had met five old º: and
friends, and in an hour afterwards the arrival of your humble servant
was known to all our old set.
“My first visit was for Tom DASH, with whom I had business. That
friend of my youth received me with the utmost cordiality: and our
business transacted and our acquaintances talked over (four of them I
ad seen, so that it was absolutely necessary I should call on them and
on the rest,) it was agreed that I should go forth and pay visits, and that
on my return ToM and I should dine somewhere together. Icalled upon
BRowN, upon Jones, upon SMITH, upon RoBINson, upon our old Paris
set, in a word, and in due time returned to ToM DASH.
“‘Where are we to dine, ToMº' says I. “What is the crack Restau-
rant now? I am entirely in your hands; and let us be off early and go
to the play afterwards.” - -
“‘Q, hang restaurants,’ says Toºt-'I'm tired of 'em; we are sick of
them here. Thompson came in just after you were gone, and I told him
you were coming, and he will be here directly to have a chop with me.”
“There was nothing for it. I had to sit down and dine with THOMPson
and Tom DASH, at the latter's charges—and am bound to say that, the
dinner was not a bad one. As I have said somewhere before, and am
roud of being able to say, I scarcely recollect ever to have had a bad
er.
“But of what do you think the present repast was composed? Sir, I
§ you my honour, we had a slice of salmon and a leg of mutton, and
oiled potatoes, just as they do in my favourite Baker Street. -
“‘Dev’lish good dinner,’ says THOMPsoN, covering the salmon with
lots of HARVEY sauce—and Cayenne pepper, from ForTNUM & MAson’s.
“‘Donnez du Sherry & Monsieur CANTERBURy,’ says ToM DASH to
FRANCOIs his man. ‘There’s porter or pale ale if any man likes it.'
...They Fº me out Sherry; I might have had #. or pale ale if
I liked: I had leg of mutton and potatoes, and finished dinner with
Stilton cheese; *: it was for this that I had revisited my dear Paris.
“‘Thank you,” says I, to DASH, cutting into the mutton with the
most bitter irony. , ‘This is a dish that I don't remember ever having
seen in England; but I have tasted pale ale there, and won't take any
this evening, thank you. ...Are we going to have Port wine after dinner?
or could you oblige me with a little London gin-and-water?”
“ToM DASH laughed his mighty laugh; and I will say, we had not
Port wine, but Claret, fit for the repast of a pontiff, after dinner, and
sate over it so late that the theatre was impossible, and the first day
was gone, and might as well have been passed in Pump Court or Pall
Mall, for all the good I had out of it. - -
“But, Sir, do you know what had happened in the morning of that
day during which I was paying the visits before mentioned?
* RQBINson, my very old friend, pressed me so, to come and dine
with him, and fix my day, that I could not refuse, and fixed Friday.
“BRowN, who is very rich, and with whom I had had a difference,
insisted so upon our meeting as in old times, that I could not refuse;
and so, being called on to appoint my own day—I selected Sunday.
“SMITH is miserably poor, and it would offend him and MRs. SMITH
mortally that I should dine with a rich man, and turn "#. nose at
his kind and humble table. I was free to name any day I liked, and so
I chose Monday.
“Meanwhile, our old friend Jones had heard that I had to
dine with BRown, with whom he too was at variance, and he offered
#. to quarrel with me unless I gave him a day: so I fixed
ursday.
“‘I have but Saturday,” says I, with almost tears in my eyes.
“‘Q, I have asked a party of the old fellows to meet you,” cries out
ToM, DASH; “and made a dinner expressly for the occasion.”
. “And this, Sir, was the fact. This was the way, Sir, that I got my
dinners at Paris. Sir, at one house I had boiled leg of mutton and
turnips, at another beef-steak; and I give you my word of honour, at
two I had mock-turtle soup! In this manner, I saw Paris. This was
what my friends called welcoming me—we drank Sherry; we talked
about MR. CoBDEN and the new financial reform; I was not allowed to
see a single Frenchman, save one, a huge athletic monster, whom I saw

GRAND INTERLITTORAL WISIT BETWEEN
CHELSEA AND BATTERSEA.
A Society of Gentlemen has been formed for the purpose of ca
Qut, during the Easter week, a d interchange of social, political, j
domestic intercourse between Chelsea and Battersea. Born under the
same sun, breathing the same air, holding up umbrellas under the same
clouds, paying the same toll over the same bridge, it has been considered
by a few patriotic spirits, advisable to cement still closer, the bricks on
eithershoreofthat river which has hitherto formedabarrierbetweenthem.
t has been accordingly determined to get up an expedition with the
utmost expedition that can be used, to conduct the sons of Chelsea over
the breast of Father Thames into the arms of young Battersea. The
visit will not be merely one of pleasure, but those who are anxious to
thrust commerce into the º: of amusement, or fold up lucre in
the clean collar of gaiety, will have ample opportunities of doing so.
Arrangements have ſº made by which persons wishing to combine the
tourist with the bagman, or to pack up the shop of business in the dress-
-case of relaxation, will have every encouragement given them. .
. The expedition will start from Chelsea New Pier at a convenient
hour, and an arrangement has been made with that gallant grandson of
NEPTUNE, CAPTAIN BULLock, who has chartered that saucy steam craft,
the Marigold, of one-pony power, expressly for this joyous occasion.
Her fire will be lighted at six F. on the morning of Easter
Monday, and immediately after the consumption of the first hundred of
coals, she will slip her cables for the opposite coast, the band—engaged
for the occasion—playing the air of Never more at Chelsea Ferry. . .
It is hoped that this # will put an end at once, twice, thrice
and for ever, to those horrible heart-burnings, bosom-score 2. and
chest-combustions, which have hitherto required all the water that
Father Thames has thrown between the two places to alleviate. Though
Battersea is a pure Beadledom, and Chelsea a Street-keeper-archy, there
is no reason why a discrepancy in the forms of intermal policy should not
be respected on both sides, or that a difference of civil institutions
should prevent the institution of mutual civilities. -
The expedition will be limited in number, and sandwiches, calculated
on the basis of a quarter of a pound of brisket of beef to each adult,
will be laid in for the voyage. Beer-small as well as large—ginger as
well as spruce—will also be carried out; and in order to §:
tastes of juvenile excursionists, Toffey, direct from Everton, with Bake
of the hardest description as well as Balls from the purest brandy, will
be sold on the taffrail of the vessel. -
It is intended to make such arrangements that ladies may share in
the great intellectual treat; and though there will be as little ceremony
as possible, six Masters of the Ceremonies are now being treated with,
whose duty it will be to find ers for the single, and, by judicious
introductions, break down those barriers, which the reserve of our
national character has thrown up to separate “the young, the gay, the
bright, the free,” from the old, the sad, the heavy, and the restrained,
who ought to be better acquainted. - -
- ding at Battersea, the Chelseaites will have an opportunity of
seeing the famed saw-mills, which no one ever saw without astonish-
ment, and which in fact constitute a collection of those very few “wise
saws” of which we still have a few “modern instances.”
Having landed on the coast, the travellers will be permitted to
explore the §", tract that lies along the shore; and the
money will include the share of a guide, the whole of a pork-pie—at
any hour in the course of the day—with a glass of grog, small or large
in proportion to its stiffness. -
he saucy steam-craft will perform four return voyages in the course
of the afternoon, by any of which the ticket, home will be available.
Further information may be obtained at the Great International
Battersea and Fraternal &hº Association Office, Old Stairs Wharf,
or of any respectable Jack in any water, between the hours of 12 and 2,
and between the bridges of London and Battersea. -
*...* The above scheme seems to be a plagiarism from the International project
which excited so much alarm in the breast of Ms. BAILLIE Cochitans, that he
thought it necessary to ask the Government what it all meant? A question which,
if they have read the Prospectus, we defy the Government to answer. In this
precious document, verbs are in a state of frightful disagreement with their nomi-
native cases, and antecedents are running wildly about in vague pursuit of their
missing relatives. Though we approve the principle of such friendly international
visits as the French have recently set an example of, we object strongly to a good
cause being damaged by such folly, twaddle, and something more, as seem to be
mixed up in the project of a return visit to France, which has just been announced
as “provisionally registered.”
CONTRACTING A BAD HABIT.
THE Admiralty is advertising for tenders to be forwarded for the con-
tract for Rum. If our jolly contemporary, the Fonetic. Mae, whose
fº is inexhaustible, (for the more we laugh at it, the more it
aughs at us) only sends in its terms, it is sure to be successful, for it is
evident to any one who can read them, that the Fonetic abbreviated
terms have reached the very lowest point of any rum contract.

subject, about which the Report just published ſº him no informa:

who were successful in some of them only * . " ;

Also, if MEssRs. MACLISE, CoPE, HoRSLEY, and DYCE, make up
“Native Art” in England? -

THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE PET OF THE PRESS
AND THE SMITHFIELD CHAMPION.
MITHFIELD was yester-
† the scene of a
mill between Punch
of Fleet Street, and
the Dirty Alderman,
otherwise the (Smith-
field Champion), the
Squeaker having un-
dertaken to fight the
Grubby 'un on his own
ground. It will be
recollected that the
Alderman lately defied
the Press to go in at
im and do theirworst;
which .# having
been accepted by the
Pet, the fight was ar-
ranged to take place
on the day and at
the locality specified.
Punch was seconded
by a slashing contem-
porary; and his adver-
sary was waited on by
SUETT, the meat-sales-
- - man, and GoADEM, the
fancy drover. Crowds of nobs, including several legislative top-sawyers,
were seen wending their way, at any early hour, in every description of
drag, to the scene of action...A ring was soon formed of butchers and
common-councilmen; the adjoining pens and pig-sties being worthily
9ccupied by geniuses of the same kidney, and others who took a “vested
interest” in the issue of the fray. - ---
The men, on peeling, displayed a 'marked difference in condition, the
Fleet, Street lad being evidently much the º man; and, as was
sagaciously, remarked by several of the by-standers, the great 'un was
decidedly the biggest. Twelve rounds were fought in fifteen minutes,
and a smarter quarter-of-an-hour's work was never seen. Punch com:
menced his attack on the Alderman's smeller, on which he planted
several scientific hits, but to no purpose, that organ being naturally
endowed with a degree of insensibility that rendered the strongest
ap to it, ineffectual. The Alderman retorted by a blow, aimed
below the belt, which, however, did not tell home. Punch, in his turn,
repaid the intended compliment by a smasher on the turtle trap, ros-
trating his antagonist on mother Earth; whence the Alderman, after a
refreshing sprawl, soon arose, deriving, like old ANTAEUs, fresh vigour
from his kindred mud. In the next round, the Alderman got Punch's
head in Chancery, and made an attempt at fibbing, much too clumsy to
be successful; after which, Punch neatly doubled him up by a blow in
the Presburgh biscuit-basket. In the following rounds the Alderman
*:: º at Punch's canister; the latter regularly retaliating by a dig
In the ribs.
Throughout the contest, the Grubby'un made no attempt at parrying
and did nothing but counter; but, always hitting wide of the mark, did
not apparently inflict the slightest punishment. Time being called at
the last round, he came up evidently groggy; and it was clear to all
unprejudiced minds that, Punch had pretty well cooked his hashed
venison. But here the Alderman's corporate pals rushed in, and broke
up the ring, with a cry of “Smithfield to the rescue !” drowning the
remonstrances of the umpires with shouts, and marrow-bones and
cleavers. They then bore their man off to his carriage, unable to walk;
for Punch had, in fact, not left him a leg to stand upon. He lay for
sometime perfectly senseless; and a doctor who felt his pulse, pronounced
all wrong; but after a while the “salubrious” air of Smithfield
partially revived him.
It is not expected that, he will be disposed to renew the contest;
but Punch has expressed his readiness to meet him again any day. The
colours of Punch were his favourite motley; the Alderman's were green
and yellow, with which tints those of black and blue were found largely
mingled at the conclusion of the encounter. The Alderman had better
go and hide what we should call his diminished head, were it not, in
truth, considerably enlarged by the tremendous pummelling it has
experienced.
A DOUBTFUL DELICACY.
A “Cook and Confectioner,” in the Morning Herald, advertises
“Invalid Turtle of the purest quality.” Invalid turtle! What would
be thought of invalid beef or mutton? No, no; whatever we eat—fish,
flesh, or fowl—at any rate let it be healthy.
THE “TOWZERY GANG.”
WHAT a thorough-paced sharper and swindler I am;
What a hand at a hoax, what a genius at bam!
If I had my deserts I believe I should hang
With the rest of my fellows, the “Towzery Gang.”
(Spoken). We are a set of itinerant drapers, Ladies, and Gents.
|For testimonials, we refer you to the Drapers' Trade Protection Society.
We hawk goods about under the authority of the Commissioners of
|Customs and other imaginary pretences. And, ha! haſ for imposition
on the British Public, and injury to the fair trader.
“On HER MAJESTY's Service,” we write on our bills
Qr, to puff off our sarcenets, and ginghams, and twills,
With the names of respectable firms we make free—
Of MESSIEURs H. and J., S. and C., S. and E.

eminent house in London, Mem., Never sell any but the most ºi.
description of goods. We will stake our reputation on the article, Mem.
(Aside...What we haven't got we can't lose. Wash, Mem? scrub—
like a kitchen floor. If you disapprove of it, you can have it exchanged
lº by our firm in Town (aside), provided you can ever find out
where it is.
Russian “crushable silks” are an article, too,
In which we the innocent customer do;
The warp is all cotton, all silk is the woof:
That the whole is not silk to the sight there’s no proof.
(Spoken). Because, you see, Sirs, the surface looks just as if it was
silk altogether—sleek as the countenance of this humble individual;
and then, you know, to complete the deception, we cut the edge, an
ravel it... And so the buyers take the rough with the smooth. bless
in this manner we sometimes sell a dress worth but thirty s s
you -- - - - -
at five guineas. That’s the way to do it, isn’t it?
But, alas! there’s a danger that threatens our hum ;
For under the Hawker's Act all of us come;
Should you put its provisions against us inforce
We should soundly be fined—and be done for, of course.
(Spoken). Yes, Sirs, we are subject to a ten pounds º for each
offence, for putting forth any kind of advertisement without describing
ourselves as licensed hawkers; whereas, the fact is, that we are a set of
unlicensed humbugs.
What a thorough-paced sharper, &c.
A HINT.
WHoEVER is in Parliament, feels an irresistible desire to speak. It
is a cruel law of nature to which every M.P. is more or less subject. .
Once upon a time, at a French Parliamentary banquet, a certain
MonsLEUR LAGRANGE (that was his name) got up to harangue the
ests. He spoke for half an hour, and every one was fairly tired of
AGRANGE. Persons began to talk loud, then louder, then they cqughed,
and then they scraped their feet, and rattled their sticks and umbrellas,
|but LAGRANGE took no notice of these interruptions, and still went on
|talking. At last, a waiter was sent to LAGRANGE to beg of him to sit
down. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I have paid my six francs—I have a
right to speak, and I will speak; ” and accordingly he went on speaking.
| ell, what did the poor guests do? Why, they all got up, some
carried the bottles—some the glasses—the others the dessert, and they
all went in a body to another room, and enjoyed themselves without
LAGRANGE, who may still be speaking at the present moment, for what
we know.
Now, when MR. CHISHOLM ANSTEY, MR., FEARGus O'ConnoR,
|MR. URQUHART, or any agricultural bore will talk, we advise the House
of Commons to follow the example of the above French banquet. When
the English LAGRANGE will not sit down, let all the Members rise; but
instead of adjourning, let some Members seize hold of the red and other
boxes, some carry the table, and the remainder the Speaker's chair, and
everything that can conveniently be carried, and remove them, and the
|sitting also, to some other room, where they can talk amongst them-
selves without fear of being interrupted.
Depend upon it, this new plan of carrying an adjournment would soon
work beneficially, for no Member, however amorous of his own voice,
| loves talking when there are no other ears to listen to him but those of
bare walls.

SLIGHTLY ALTERED FROM SHAKSPEARE, AND RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO THE WOODS AND FORESTs.
Scene I.-The New Forest.
| Enter the Lond WARDEN, Lieutenant of the Forest,
Bow-bearer, and Keepers—a Verderer, a
Regarder, and a Commissioner of Woods and
Forests.
Scene II.-Another part of the New Forest.
Lord Warden. Now, Gentlemen, and brother
Sinecures,
Hath not old custom made our game more cheap
Than that of our own parks P Give not these woods
Much snugger places than the envious Court?
Here fear we but the Committee of Lord DUNcAN ;
No Session's sufferings—as Disnarli's fangs,
And churlish chiding of the niggard HUME;
| Who, when they bite and blow on Ministers,
Till even they shrink for shame—we smile and say,
“We are lumped in the Estimates; John Bull
Has no one to inform him what we cost.”
A sweet department is the Woods and Forests,
Which, though it may be costly and troublesome,
Has yet such pleasant places in its gift,
Which they who hold, exempt from public taunt,
Live at their ease, book each his annual bucks,
The timber bone, nor stick at anything. -
Bow.bearer. We would not change it. Happy is
your Grace,
That, though a nobleman of ample fortune,
Can blind the public in so neat a style.
Lord Warden. And yet they grudge us our poor
share of venison.
It is too bad that we, who've places here,
And you, Commissioners of Woods and Forests,
Should by Archbishops, Bishops, Clerks, and Judges,
See the fat haunches floored.
Commiss. Indeed, my Lord,
The melancholy Carlisle grieves at that,
Saying, his Forest duties much usurp
Of the small time his various labours leave him.
To-day the third Commiss'oner and myself
Did steal behind him as he sat at work
On DUNcAN's Blue-Book—and we heard, my Lord,
The wretched gentleman heave forth such groans,
That their discharge might even a Cobden melt
Almost to pity—while his innocent nose
In piteous perplexity he scratched.
And thus our courteous Chief Commissioner,
Quite flabbergasted with his many toils,
Sat addled o'er the page of the Blue-Book,
Bedewing it with tears.
Lord Warden. But why was this?
Had he no answer when they bullied him P
Commiss. Oh, yes! Spoke of his thousand offices;
And when they blamed him as too soft by half,
“Dear, dear,” quoth he, “I'd make a trifling bet,
There isn't one of you that would do more,
And few would do so much "–he being, alone,
Justice in Eyre, both North and South of Trent;
Chairman of the Commission for the Palace;
Ditto of the Committee of Enclosures;
Commissioner of Greenwich, Highland Roads,
For paving Regent Street and building churches;
Conservator o’ the Mersey, and Trustee
For certain chapels in St Marylebone;
Member o' Council for fair Cornwall's Duchy;
On the Fine Arts Commission, and Director
Of Geological Surveys; Chairman, too,
Of Sewer Commissions—six fused into one.
“'Tis right," quoth he. “The Ministry doth make
A man acquainted with strange offices.”
Anon, some careless under-secretaries,
Bound for the sea-side, sweep past by the window,
Nor stay to look in on him. “Ay,” quoth he,
“Be off, you cool and lazy sinecurists,
To haunts of fashion; wherefore should you call
Upon a poor o'er-worked Commissioner?"
Lord Warden. And did you leave him in this
situation ?
Com. We did, my Lord, declaring they'll not rest
Till they’ve killed all the deer.
Lord Warden. And ta'en my place?
It cannot be-he must have lost his wits;
Let's ask what is the matter.
Commiss. I'll bring you to him straight.
Enter Orlando (Punch), and Adam (John Bull).
Adam (reading Miscellaneous Estimates). Dear
Master, I can go no further. Oh, I'm eaten out of
house and home; and with such a family, too !
Cheated and starved, cheated and starved.—Here I
lie down, and give it up altogether. Farewell, kind
Punch /
Orlando. Why, how now, John!—no greater heart
in thee? Comfort a little; cheer up a little. Here
| in the forest live certain rogues that feed them fat on
|thine estates. I'll to them; and if I bring thee not
some comfort, read me no more—laugh no more.
Well said thou look'st cheerly. Come, thou shalt
not die for lack of thine own, if Punch can help
thee. So, cheerly, good John; cheerly. [Breunt.

LoRD WARDEN, Bow-bearer, Verderers, Regarders,
Keepers, Commissioners, as before. To them
Jaques (MoR peth).
Lord Warden. A little of the fat—more on that side.
Commiss. Th' alderman's walk? Is 't that your
Lordship means ?
Lord Warden. It is. (Filling a glass of Claret.)
Here's to the Woods and Forests '
All. Hip !—
Enter Oklando (Punch) with a Blue-Book in his
hand.
Orlando. Forbear, and eat no more 1
Jaques. Why, I have eat none yet.
Orlando. Nor shalt thou, till necessity be served.
Jaques (aside). Good gracious! who can this rude
person be 2 [Bows to him very civilly.
Delighted, Sir, to make your sweet acquaintance.
Lord Warden. Now, my good man, don't talk
about distress;
Such Chartist stuff is clean against good manners.
Orlando. I marvel you are not ashamed to feast,
As knowing what the wants of him whose meat
Smokesonyour platters. There's poor old Joan Bull,
Who, thanks to such as you, with weary step
Hath scarce limped hither. Till he be relieved,
Oppressed with two great evils, want and taxes,
You shall not touch a bit—

No more we'll waste—thanks to those vile Returns.

BUONAPARTISM IN ENGLAND.
she spirit of Buonapartism has lately been pro-
gressing rapidly at Hull among a large party,
who have rallied round the Emperor's d.º.
in this country, the illustrious GoMERSAL. It
is well known that soon after the retirement
into exile of his renowned prototype, Go:
- MERSAL, ". a sort of St. Helena of
Yº E. F Astley’s Amphitheatre, promulgated his
- - peculiar idées Napoléennes, from the stage of
that establishment. That he even expected the dynasty of the Buona.
partist family to be restored in his person in France, has been the subject
of much shrewd suspicion; but we believe his hopes were, much frus:
trated, his ºf embittered, and his milk of human kindness turned
into the whey of misanthropy by the premature expedition of Louis-
NAPOLEON to Boulogne.
GoMERSAL felt a natural jealousy of Montholon
refused to sanction the rash attempt, on the ground
and, it is believed,
that “the pear was
not yet ripe enough for its fall”—an expression he never used without
emphasizing the word “pear,” by whom he meant Louis-Philippe,
giving one of his well-known Buonapartist winks, and half emptying
the small trunk of saw-dust which used to do duty as the property
snuff-box of the Emperor. -
Disgusted, apparently, with the little progress the cause of the Empire
had been making, and fired by the example of his amphitheatrical #.
MARshAL NEY, who had lately gone into the beer line, the Emperor
has lately sought a sort of Elba in Hull, where he rules the roast as
well as the boiled, as landlord of the “Duke of Wellington.”
In this capacity the Imperial veteran carries out, or sends out his
imperial measures, to the immense satisfaction of a host of friends, who
rally round him with an affection worthy of the great historical scene at
Fontainebleau. He often weeps over the fate of his old and faithful
Mameluke, who was last heard of driving a fly in the neighbourhood of
St. George's Fields; and GoMERSAL has been known to shed more than
one tear over the apostate Wippi.com.B, who has degenerated from the
gallant MAssENA into the kid-gloved, eureka-shirted introducer of eques-
trian artists into that brilliant circle which they have selected as the

LITERARY AND DRAMATIC HONOURS.
IN common with our brotherhood of the press—and if there be any
body of mortal men, amongst whom the affectionate fraternal principle
flourishes with strength and sweetness, it is, the brotherhood of §.
press; for when º pelt one another it is all in play, and never with
muck and dirt; no, the missiles are carnival weapons, sugar-plums and
egg-shells filled with rose water in common, we say, with our fraternity,
we rejoice at every recognition of the claims of literature by Potentates
and Powers. When one goose-quillis honoured, every other goose-quill
instinctively rustles with pleasure, and takes the ink, as the parent
goose may have taken the water, with strengthening freshness and
renewed delight.
Thus, when HER GRAcroUs *...*.*.* honoured hands
of ColóNEL PHLPPs—caused to be conveyed to MR. CHARLEs KEAN a
dozen silver spoons (we give them beautifully engraved) commemorative
ºf his Shakspearean power, together with a dozen four-pronged forks
illustrative of the eight-and-fortyK. duly numbered by an ap ointed
Beefeater, in the said Charles KEAN's Shylock and }}."º. We
say, we were made acquainted with this act of Royal beneficence, we
felt-though we do not habitually write dramatic criticisms—as if the
effulgence of the aforenamed spoons and forks were, or might be, in
the course of our dinner-table life, reflected on ourselves. We felt that
those forks and spoons had, or might have, a subtle and no less pleasing
influence on the proper taste of letters.
We were not mistaken. The actor first acknowledged by the Court—
a precedence, of course, his own by superior worth, and higher genius
-the dramatist, at a decent distance followed. Literature can hardly
be associated with forks and spoons—unless now and then, as the
honoured guest at the actor's table—therefore, no such Court offering of
plate reflected º the modest genius of those dramatists, whose plays
were represented at Windsor Castle, and who—with that condescension
towards letters that has ever distinguished the House of Hanover—were
severally invited to witness their works, and seats provided for them (at
their own choice) upon any of the door-steps of the town of Windsor.
Spoons and forks were not for play-writers; but, as the actor KEAN, in
addition to the plate, received from Royalty a magnificent diamond-
ring, so has a splendid ring been forwarded to eac
stantial ring of best Brummagem; no less than a ring for—his umbrella!
. But for the space º would have ...; we should also have
ven correct drawings of the Royal umbrella-rings vouchsafed to the

duced them to accede to our wish. We regret that we cannot afford
tº the rings so much, paper; the reader, however, may imagine them.
He has only to fill his mind with the largest circle of brass, and the
literary umbrella-ring will be immediately present to him.
To the distinguished critics, afforded so many pleasant and unctuous
opportunities of contemplating the SHAKspeARE Forks and Spoons of
R. CHARLEs KEAN, and who have consequently been enabled to con-
tribute to Mr. Punch the facsimiles herein rendered, Mr. Punch returns
his sincere thanks; with a further apology for this late acknowledgment
of the great service they have rendered to the dignity of SHAKSPEARE,
and even, better still, in the fulfilment of their high function as public
instructors, to the greater dignity of truth.
LETTER FROM AN INMATE OF THE HOUSE OF
CORRECTION TO A FRIEND.
“My DEAR BOB, - -
“I have now been in this place four months, and I am only
sorry that I have but two more to remain, for my privilege is limited to
six, though I will take care to renew, my claim by a prompt act of theft
immediately on my term being expired. My education, you will perceive,
has not been neglected, but my comforts are the chief thing in ". eyes,
and these have been scrupulously attended to. You must not believe
those who tell you that a prison is an uncomfortable place. I can assure
you it is only the name of the thing; and even this we get over by calling
our quarters the Chesterton Hotel, after our worthy governor. You must
not believe those who tell you that it is a degradation to be here; for I can
speak from my own experience, that we are all looked upon as if we were
members of some college or university, for the learning of genteel busi.
messes, which I might term the polite arts; for nothing is taught here of
a rough or disagreeable character. . .
“There used, in former days of ignorance and barbarism, to be a
wheel, and everybody here was being continually asked to step up
stairs; but this was found * visiting magistrates too exhausting
by way of exercise, and it been discontinued accordingly. We
have our baths, and, every luxury that could be desired. I might,
rhaps, object to the over zeal with which the hair-cutter throws
imself into his task; but, as the warm, weather comes on, even this
peculiarity of the place will help to render it i. I had much
rather have short hair in this pleasant retreat than short commons out
of it. And I can but advise you to get an Act of Parliament, read up
the list of offences that will qualify * for admission here, and get
elected; they will do it all for you at the Sessions, without any tº:
or expense to you, as quickly as you can make it convenient.
“Some of your cousins were trying about a year ago to scrape up a
little money to learn the trade of dressmaking. Tell them it is taught
here as an accomplishment, quite free of charge, and if they can pick
out of the Act a small misdemeanor, they might, at all events, come
in by way of experiment—say for a month.
“I am yours very sincerely,
“TIMOTHY TRAPPER.”
THE WALUE OF A DLPLOMA.
If any fond father has a son who will be obliged to get his living by
practising the medical profession, let that affectionate parent refer to the
advertisements for assistants. Here is one:—
WANTEP, a Gentleman of undeniable character, and attached to his pro-
fession, as an ASSISTANT. A gentleman holding a diploma, and requiring
a year or two's experience, with kind treatment and opportunities of improvement,
rather than emolument, will be preferred. A moderate salary will nevertheless be
offered.—Apply to M.D., care of * * * *, giving references.
So, this gentleman of undeniable character is wanted as an assistant.
He is to hold a diploma, and to require experience; but the latter, one
would think, should have been a condition to the former. Surely he
must be supposed to be very greatly in want of experience. Experience
is to be his chief wages; what services, then, is he to render—domestic,
culinary, stabular, or what? Johnson, defined habit to be “the power
which a man acquires of doing a thing by repeatedly doing it.” In like
manner this assistant is to learn his profession by repeatedlyP.
it. His work is to constitute his hire. It is to be observed that one
of the advantages offered him is “kind treatment,” which, being
advertised, must, of course, be something extraordinary. “Q der

“WELL, SIR, I Don't KNow of ANY FAULT IN PERTICKLER, 'CEPT THAT when HE BEGINs To Kick, HE Do KICK LIKE BLAzEs.”
SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL.
EYoND all doubt the plush of the
lamented JENKINs has descended
on the Shakspearean critic of the
Morning Post. Nothing can be
more beautiful, and withal more
airy and graceful, than his last
doings upon Oſiello. He gambols
among metaphors and images, as a
kitten i. gambol in a china-
closet. It is cheering to the lovers
of the Drama to know that such a
mind, in its recreative moments,
condescends to dally with the
stage. The departed JENKINs
himself seldom surpassed this:—
“Desdemona is the snowdrop of the Shaksperian parterre—the cynosure of that
baldric of pearls by which the poet has encircled his images of feminine perfection.
In most instances he depicts woman “like one of heaven,” whom “the devils them-
selves should fear to seize ;' but Desdemona has nothing earthly but her heart, and
that heart possesses so much of the divinity in its impulses, that to one grain of dust
we discover an atmosphere of purity.”
A snowdrop in a parterre—and the chief pearl of a baldric that encircles
an image of perfection is Desdemona. Beautiful! Then, only think of
her heart. For every grain of dust there is an atmosphere of purity;
thus, if her heart have of dust, say twenty grains, it has a score of
atmospheres. And, for all this, Desdemona is not at all the woman to
give herself airs. For
“Even her love is not the common passion of our nature—her eye is not attracted
by the allurements of form and complexion—her desires not quickened by the
warmth of endearment; but her nature is absorbed by the lustre of soul, and of a
name whose greatness has been deserved. To this soul her own clings, undisturbed
by the defacement of its casket. It may be bruised, torn, agitated, broken—the divine
essence within may escape, and blend with grosser matter; but while one inex-
tinguishable spark remains, her own flickers in brightness around it, until the
flame ascends to join the radiant fires of immortality.”
Caskets, as the police will testify, have been bruised, torn, and
broken : we now find that a casket may also be agitated, and we are
refreshed by the knowledge. Essences, too, are not commonly kept in
caskets; and it is well they are not, because they may, it seems, escape
in “inextinguishable sparks.” The poetic image of the casket and the
essence is beautiful; but for prosaic life, we must prefer a bottle with
a stopper of ground glass.
“Women resembling her [Desdemona) are rare, but they are to be found—
though, when discovered, like the lily of the valley, they mostly blossom but to fade.”
Thus, though it is the frequent habit of the lily of the valley, to
“blossom but to fade,” there are º: Some lilies of the valley
never die; especially the lilies with leaves and flowers of wax and
muslin, and stalk of wire.
“Emilia is a specimen of ordinary womanhood, abounding with excellencies and
imperfections. She needs but little comment, more than that, like all the portraits
of ShakspeaRE, she is a truthful picture of reality.”
In the last acted instance, however—
“The received stage version has been cast aside, and the strong-lunged and loud-
voiced virago displayed by the sympathising and indignant woman.”
So that Emilia is not a shrew. When she exclaims
“A halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones,”
it is not the rapping out of the soldier's wife—of the woman of the
camp, but a pretty outbreak of feminine sympathy. The lady swears
-as WILKEs was said to squint-no more than becomes her. We are
henceforth to receive Emilia without the scold. Very well; we shall
next have lucifer-matches without brimstone.
SHAksPEARE was a clever man, no doubt; but we are always pleased
when tremendous critics, alive to his faults, condescend to set the
erring author right.
PARLIAMENTARY DEFINITION.—Comprehensive Measure. A measure
that will take everybody in.

PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
THEATRE CRIMINAL, OLD BAILEY.
MR. REEve having, at an enormous expense (£250 per annum), leased
of the Sheriffs of London the Central Galleries of the Criminal Court,
begs to lay before a discerning public his programme for the season.
MR. REEve is proud to say, that he may rely upon the judicious and
impartial services of the most distinguished of HER MAJESTY's Judges.
Negotiations are pending with LoRD DENMAN, who, will no doubt
. upon the Bench in his best ermine, renewed regardless of
Outlay.
SIR. Thomas WILDE will also resume his position, with other Judges,
like stars—too numerous and too brilliant to number.
Two Aldermen, (warranted to sleep, without snoring,) will further
illustrate the Bench—of course, not being able to touch it, without
adorning it.
Messrs. BoDKIN, PRENDERGAST, BALLANTYNE, WILKINs, &c, &c.,
prosecute and defend with their accustomed ability; and abuse,
and tear, and twit, and expose, and badger one another with their
usual strength, violence, sharpness, impartiality, and eloquence. (MR.
KENEALY is engaged for the impassioned Irishmen).
MR. REEve feels that he approaches the most difficult and the most
delicate part of his task, -namely, the scale of prices for that, curious
and tasteful portion of the public, given to visit the Theatre Criminal.
It will at once be conceded, that the general rule applicable to the
Victoria, and other mere play-houses, cannot be made to apply to the
| Theatre, Old Bailey, in which the cases range from every conceivable
point of interes ºffrom the stealing of a penny bun by a hardened
ruffian of nine years old, to a curious case of murder by an unfor-
tunate and interesting individual.
MR. REEve, however, is anxious to assure the public that he will be
as equitable as a strict regard to his own interests will permit. And—
though he does not absolutely pledge himself to a rigorous respect for
the subjoined scale of admission prices to the galleries of the Theatre,
Old Bailey, he nevertheless trusts it may be received as, pretty well, a
general tariff:—
A trial for Larceny—One Shilling.
For Shoplifting, ditto (if, however, by a Lady of the first respectability)—One
Shilling and Sixpence.
Burglaries, Highway Robberies, Stealing from the Person, and other crimes, with
which an enlightened public are too well acquainted to dilate upon—if com-
mitted in a common way, and by common people—One Shilling.
By Ladies and Gentlemen (in every case)—One Shilling and Sixpence.
For Murder in ordinary-Two Shillings.
If under trtraordinary circumstances, and by an interesting individual of either
sex, whose portrait is likely to appear in the newspapers—
But here MR. REEvE feels it difficult to fix a sum. How is it possible
beforehand to rate the value of a HockeR—to put a price upon a
GREENACRE—to name the exact figure when the imagination is moved
by a BURKE or a HARE *
MR. REEVE conceives that he should only tamper with the feelings
of a discerning and enlightened public, were he to attempt any fixe
price of admission under such perplexing circumstances. He claims,
therefore, to be left to his own sense of profits, which he herein declares
he will make as low as possible, commensurate with a due sense of
justice and a proper sense of himself.
A handsome Black Cap has been ordered for the Court; and MR.
REEVE further begs to assure his patrons that a contract has been
entered into with a distinguished Covent-Garden florist to supply the
dock with herbs and flowers, together—on interesting cases of homicide
-with a white Camellia, or some other symbolically pure exotic—for
the prisoner's button-hole.
Prospectuses may be had of the turnkeys, of all HER MAJESTY's
London Gaols, and at the Bar of every public-house in Newgate Street
and the Old Bailey.
Fiat Justitia, ruat Coelum. /

BRIBERY OF THE PRESS.
At a recent meeting held for the purpose of discussing the merits
and demerits of Smithfield Cattle Market, some wiseacre, whose love of
Smithfield proves the value he sets upon that which is dirty, declared
that an extensive #.g. of bribery had been practised upon the Press
by the enemies of the Smithfield nuisance. We, of course, can't answer
for our contemporaries, nor fix the rate at which they estimate their
characters, though we think some of them may fairly take pretty high
ground in this respect; but, judging only for ourselyes, we are convinced
that no one who is not º: to pay off the National Debt should
attempt the audacious experiment. certain statesman declared that
every one has his price, and it may be said that our price is threepence;
but let any one attempt to buy us, so as to give a bias to our judgment,
and he will find that the entire contents of the Bank coffers would be
but a contemptible instalment of the sum that would be required to
purchase us.
The Champion of Smithfield seems to imagine that the Press is in the
market, to be bought like any other article; but we should like to hear
the reception the too speculative gentleman would get if he walked into
the Times Office and asked the terms upon which that Journal could be
bought for the Smithfieldian interest. The gentleman, probably thinks
that a ;: two slipped into the hands of the publisher, and a half
sovereign addressed to one of the writers, would do the business. We
only wish he would try it on at Printing House Square; or, let him come
to the Punch Office, and if our meanest myrmidon did not refresh him
under the nearest pump, we do not know the character of our humblest
underlings.
WRITS OF OUTLAWRY.
. NoTICE was given at the Sheriff’s Court, that, unless the undermen-
. º and things speedily surrendered, they would be speedily
Outlawed:-
1st. THE Coming MAN. He has been overdue for a long period, and
tºº. every possible corner has been searched in the hopes of finding
him, he has not yet turned up. He owes an immense deal, owing to the
long arrears of interest, which at times has been very high indeed; and it
is extremely doubtful if he would be able to honour all the promissory
notes and things that have been endorsed with his name.
2nd. THE Good TIME THAT is CoMING, Boys. This good Time has
been anxiously looked for in Ireland, in the English Colonies, in the
British Government, and other places where its presence is sadly wanted.
Unless it rapidly makes its appearance, it will be posted as a public
impostor.
3rd. THE LEADER OF THE PROTECTIONISTs. There was great hesita-
tion in outlawing this last individual, as it was strongly asserted that there
was no veritable person of that name, though it is well known there are
numerous pretenders to his character. However, he is now summoned,
if in existence, to make his appearance, and give himself up for E."
tion; for if not, a certain party in the House will be very º: osers.
WOICI:
We have heard of the duality of mind, but a duality of voice is some-
thing quite new; and this novelty has at length, presented itself in the
person of a MR. RichMond, who can of course sing duets with himself,
and while executing a bass he can double his voice } adding a treble.
This vocal phenomenon has been exhibited at the School of Medicine,
by DR. W. PETTIGREw, a son, we believe, of the illustrious savant who
will down to posterity with half a dozen mummies in -
MR. º power of multiplying his voice caused a general
feeling among his auditors that there must have been “six RICHMONDs
d| in the field” when two had been heard already, and that Richarp's
exaggeration of the RichMond family was, after all, perfectly natural.
A Peculiar Persuasion.
THE Boston Atlas says that—
“A Joint stock Company is in process of formation in New York, composed of
members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and others agreeing with them in
sentiment, whose destination is California.”
It is of no use to ask where the members of the Methodist Epis-
copal Church expect to go to; for they have settled it that their desti-
nation is—California. The sentiment in which they and their friends
coincide, must be a somewhat peculiar kind of religious feeling. We
only hope that it is not a veneration for—the Golden Calf.

A LIBEL ON PUNCH.
The Daily News, in a recent leading article on the wondrous events -
of the year 1848, declares that it “nevertheless did not produce one
man—one great man equal to the situation.” We don't exactly see
what our contemporary means; for, we hope that the ordinary domestic
footman of 1848 was “equal to the situation,” or in other words, “strong
enough for the place;” and at all events, if the Daily News intended
the expression to have a r signification, and to mean that there has
been no man equal to the situation as servant-of-all-work to the country
BEAUTIES OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM.
Nothing goes down in this day without plenty of additions. Even
the lecturers on Astronomy can't get successfully through a season,
unless they can advertise a fair sprinkling of additional stars: and one
Professor, who wished to throw all rivalry into the shade, came outlast
year with no less than six additional comets, and a sort of prospective
promise of giving next season two additional, poles, some additional
wind-instruments to the band of OR1ON, as well as an additional quart
of pure cream thrown into the milkyway to increase its richness.
The Theatres, when they wish to present extra attraction to the publi
will announce additional bands, additional chorusses, or additio
stuffing to the additional backs of additional seats; and Vauxhall's
occasional million of additional lamps is proverbial. Even the Dutch
Dwarf was advertised the other day with numerous additions, though
we think curtailments would have been more attractive in his case;
and now the British Museum has begun, to rely upon some of its
splendidadditions for the gratification of public curiosity.
We say nothing of the attractions that meet our eyes under the
portico, consisting of an ancient idol, who has been idoling away his
time, to our knowledge, for the last twenty years, at the doors of the
Museum, and a canoe, found in Sussex, supposed to have been brought
over by two Indians recently married, who took their wedding tour in
this canoe, by way of enjoying alittle canoe-bial felicity. These we do
not regard as additions to the great national collection; but there are
a few specimens of a more, modern date, which have Fº been
recently intº with the interesting objects forming the British
Museum. Of these, around mahogany table is the most conspicuous;
and it is evidently intended to leadback the mind imperceptibly towards
the Round Table of KING ARTHUR, rendered illustrious by the Knights

ourselves—Punch—to be quite equal to the situation, or any other situa-

which our columns can afford for it. We, however, on our contempo-

better accommodation than a couple of places in the Gallery. Surely

THE WRONG AND THE REMEDY.
In law, “Every wrong hath its remedy,” quoth BLAckstone; in fact,
“every wrong hath not its remedy,” rejoins Punch. If a man bore you
to death with bad verses, can your executors indict him for murder? If
a clown cripple your favourite foot by treading on your worst corn, will
the iaw force him to give you so much as a crutch or a cork º If
a dunce steals your ideas—and Punch loses a countless amount by this
sort of largeny—will the law send him to the tread-wheel? Supposing a
stupid lord, whose praise is censure, and whose censure praise,” patro-
mises!you, till your countenance becomes crimson, can you, repair the
injury by suing out a fieri facias & Is a fuge warrant available against a
ruffian who runs away with your best joke? What satisfaciendum will

Even there the coal must be of a character that will bear sifting, for its
ashes are seldom, allowed to rest in peace, and every operation that a
coal undergoes will entail the necessity for some article of merchandise
to deal with it in its various stages of existence. The digging for it
requires a spade, and the coal must have the sack before it leaves
its first abode in the earth's bosom. Its career
from the sack to the cellar requires the inter-
position of a heaver, and it is notorious that
“When thy servant heaves a coal,”

of iron. He was to have met his subjects on the Eastern frontier of his
dominions about a week ago; but when the time came for the interview,

the storm of dissatisfaction which the absence of the Railway King
had created. Attempts were made to communicate with His #.

whole transaction. It is not known whether the Railway King remains
entrenched within the lines, or whether he intends effecting a retreat;
| with a view to which he has already offered, it is said, a partial surrender
of his capital. -
The abdication, if so it should prove to be, arose out of an émeute in
the market, where there have been many murmurings lately as to the
administration of the Railway Kingdom; and it has been asked how
HistMajesty will account for the share he has had in it. We forbear

THE STORY OF KOOMPANEE JEHAN.
oME time after the death of
AURUNGZEBE, a mighty
prince held ãomination
over India, from the
seven mouths of the
Ganges to the five tails
of the Indus, who was
renowned above most
other monarchs for his
strength, riches, and
wisdom. His name was
Koom PANEE JEHAN.
Although this monarch
had innumerable magni-
ficent palaces at Delhi
and Agra, at Benares
Boggleywollah, , , an
ednuggar, his com-
mon, residence was in
the beautiful island of
| Ingleez, in the midst of
the capital of which, the
famous city of Lundoon
Koom PANEE JEHAN ha
a superb castle. It was
called the Hall of Lead,
and stood at the foot of
the Mountain of Corn,
close by , the verdure-
covered banks of , the
. . . silvery Tameez, where
the cypresses wave and the zendewans or nightingales love to sing. In
this palace, he sate and gave his orders, to govern the multitudinous
tribes which paid him tribute from the Cashmerian hills to the plains
watered by the Irrawaddy. - - - -
The great Koom PANEE JEHAN governed his dominions with the help
of a council of twenty-four vizeers, who assembled daily in the Hall of
Lead, and who were selected from among the most wealthy, wise, brave,
and eminent of the merchants, scribes, and warriors in the service of
his vast empire. It must have been a grand sight to behold the twenty-
four sages assembled in Durbar, smoking their kaleoons round the
monarch’s magnificent throne. - -
It was only by degrees, and by the exercise of great cunning and
prodigious valour that the illustrious KooMPANEE JEHAN had acquired
the vast territory over which he ruled. By picking endless quarrels in
which he somehow always seemed to be in the right, and innumerable
battles in which his bravery ever had the uppermost, he added kingdom
after kingdom to his possessions. Thus the Rajahs, Princes, and
Emperors of India fell before the sword of his servants; and it is
known that BoonAPoort, TIPPoo SAHIB the Mysore. Sultan, and
IskENDER SHAH, who conquered PoHUs.SINGH on the banks of the
Indus, were severally overcome by the lieutenants of the victorious
warrior who dwelt in the Hall of Lead. One of his chieftains, the great
ELLEEN-BURRoo, a stronger man than ANTAR himself, carried off the
gates of Somnanthon his back, and brought them to the foot of the throne
of the palace, on the Mountain of Corn, by the banks of the Tameez.
This mighty monarch, who had guns enough to blow this world into
Jehanum, . who counted his warriors by lakhs, was, like many, other
valiant sovereigns, the slave of a woman; and historians assert that he
gave up the chief government of his country to the Empress, his mother,
the Queen of the f. of whom he was so fond that he could deny
her nothing. He appointed the Captains and Colonels of his regiments,
but the Empress nominated all the chief Generals; and the chiefs of
Koom PANEE JEHAN, who had carried his flag in a hundred battles, and
notched their scimitars across the head-pieces of thousands of his foes,
were not a little angry to see strangers put over them, who came from
Lundoon smelling of musk and rose-water, and who got the lion's
share of the honours, while they took no more (as who indeed canº)
than the lion's share of the fighting: , Thus, in a famous action in
Kabool, a certain Captain of Artillery blew open the gates of the city,
but it was the General, KEEN, BAHAwDER, who was made a bashaw of
three tails for the feat which the other had done: and for a series of
tremendous actions on the Sutlej River, HARDING SHAH, SMITH
SAHIB, and Goof BAHAwDER were loaded with honours, and had
mouths well nigh, choked with barley-sugar; whereas one of Koom-
PANEE's own warriors, LITTLER SINGH, a better soldier than any of those
other three, was passed over with scarcely a kind word.
In consequence of this system—for the Empress mother would often
cause her son to select Generals who had no more brains thana wezz or
- ters frequently befel Koom PANEE JEHAN's armies, and that
prince had many a bekhelool, or hard nut to crack. One army was
waylaid and utterly destroyed, because the Queen Mother, chose to

give the command of it to an officer, out of whom age and illness had
squeezed all the valour: and another warrior, though as brave as:
*:::::::: was a hundred years old, and had been much better at
home handling a pipe than a sword, for which his old hands were now
uite unfit. lion as he was, Goof BAHAwDER did not remember that
the enemy with whom he had to do were derans or foxes, and that a
pack of foxes is more dangerous than a lion in a pit. Finding one day
the enemy posted in a jungle, this Goof BAHAwder sent his troops in
upon them helter-skelter; but some fled, many were slain, 8.
BAHAwder had a dismal account of the battle to render, and when he
claimed a victory, people only laughed at his ancient beard.
That is, they would have laughed, but the people of Lundoon were in
too great a rage to be merry. ...Everywhere, in every house, from the
highest to the lowest, from the Omrahs and Lords prancing about in
the Meidan, to the camel-drivers in the streets, all men cried out; and
the Indian soldiers said, “Why is this old man to be left to jeopardise
the lives of warriors, and bring our country to sorrow? If th. É.
mother will appoint chiefs for the armies of India, over the heads of
those who are as brave and more experienced, let her give us men that
are fit to lead us. Who is Goor, and who is ELPHINstoon, and who
is KEEN, to whom you give all the honours? And what are they to
compare to THAckwell and LITTLER, to NoTT and Pollock KHAN ?”
Now there was, when the news came to the City of Lundoon, that
Goof BAHAwpER had been beaten upon the banks of the Chenaub, a
warrior who, though rather old, and as savage as a bear whose head is
sore, was allowed }* mankind to be such a RoosTUM as had never
been known since the days of WELLINGToon. His name was NAPEER
SING. He, with two thousand men, had destroyed thirty thousand of
the enemy: he despised º: he had a beak like an eagle, and a
beard like a Cashmere goat. When he went into a campaign he took
with him but a piece of soap and a pair of towels; he dined off a hunch
of bread and a cup of water. “A warrior,” said he, “should not care
for wine or luxury, for fine turbans or embroidered shulwars ; his tulwar
should be bright, and never mind whether his papooshes are shiny.”
Nº. SING was a lion indeed; and his mother was a mother of
10ns.
But this lion, though the bravest of animals, was the most quarrel-
some that ever lashed his tail and roared in a jungle. After gaining
several victories, he became so insolent and contemptuous in his beha.
viour towards King Koopangºjeñas, whom he insulted, whom he
assailed, whom he called an old woman, that the offended monarch was
glad when GENERAL NAPEER SINGH’s time of service was out, and
vowed no more to employ him.
. It is related of NAPEER SINGH, that when he was recalled to the
island of the Ingleez, he went into the Hall of Lead, where the monarch
sate in full Durbar, knocked the heads of the twenty-four vizeers one
against another, and seizing upon KING KoomPANEE himself by the
royal nose, pulled him round the room, and kicked him over among the
sprawling Counsellors of his Dewan. I know not whether this tale is
true; but certain it is, that there was a tremendous tehwash or row,
and that when the king heard the General's name mentioned, he grew
as yellow and as sour as an ilemoon or lemon.
When the news of Goof's discomfiture came to Lundoon and the
Hall of Lead, and the Queen of Feringhistan, all the Ingleez began to
quake in their shoes. “Wallah! wallah!” they cried, “we have been
made to swallow abominations! Our beraks have been captured from
our standard-bearers; our guns have been seized; our horsemen have
fled: overpowered by odds, and because Goor BAHAwpER knew not how
to lead them into battle. How shall we restore the honour of our
arms? What General is there, capable of resisting those terrible Sikhs
and their Sirdars?” -
.The voice of all the nation answered, “There is but one Chief, and
his name is NAPEER SINGH.”
The twenty-four yizeers in the Hall of Lead, remembering, the treat-
ment which they had received from that General, and still smartin
uneasily on their seats, from the kicks which he had administered,
cried out, “No ; we will not have that brawling SAMPSON.—take any
man but him if Goo Bºwork will not do, take GooM BAHAwDER.
We will not have NAPEER SINGH, or eat the pie of humility any
more.”
The people still roared out “Nobody can help us but NAPEER SINGH.”
Now NAPEER SINGH was as sulky as the twenty-four vizeers. “I f:
said he, “to serve a monarch who has been gºy ungrateful, and whose
nosef have tweaked in Durbar? Never, never!”
But an old General, nearly a hundred years old, very old, brave and
wise, the Great WELLINGtoon, came to NAPEER, SINGH and said, “
an, in these times of danger men must forget their quarrels and serve
their country.—If you will not go to the Indus, I will go—one or other of
us must.” They were two lions, two Roostums, two hooked-beaked
les of war—they rushed into each other's arms, and, touched each
other’s beaks. “O Father,” NAPEER SINGH said, “I will go:” and he
went forth and he bought a piece of soap, and he got two towels; and
he took down from the wall his bright and invincible tulwar.
Meanwhile the twenty-four vizeers and KING Koolſpan EE JEHAN had
been taking council in the Hall of Lead. Many of the angry ones said

“No, we will not appoint him our General.” Some of the wisevizeers said
“Yes, we will appoint him; for without him we shall not have akingdom
at all.” Atlast the King himself, who was bail, that is very fat, rose
up from his throne and said-
“O my Agas, Omrahs, Scribes and men of war. There are many
things which a man has to put into his imameh or pipe, which are hardto

of this sort. A kick is not a pleasant thing to swallow, neither is a dose
of senna. Adversity sometimes prescribes one, as the Doctor orders the
other. We have had all our beards pulled, we have been kicked round
the room, we have been tumbled helter skelter by this Roostum. Bek-
hesm! Bismillah! my sides ache still with the violence of his papooshes.
But what of this? If I am drowning, shall Irefuse to live because
a man pulls me out of the water by the nose?. If I want to fly, shall I
refuse a horse because he kicks a little? I will mount him in the name
of Fate, and ride for my life. We know, how strong this SAMsoon is;
let him go in Heaven's name, and fight the enemy forus. Let him go.
Make out his §. ; give him a khelat, and a feast of honour!” And
the wise and beneficent monarch safe down, and puffed away at his
kaleoon, as the twenty-four vizeers, bowing their heads, cried—“Be it

THE BEGGAR AT THE GATE.
A BEGGAR maid crouches at England's door;
Squalid and sad she crouches there alway,
Shivering, unsheltered, thro’ the winterfrone,
Scorching, unshaded, thro’ the summer day.
The sun comes up upon that º lair,
Her gaunt and grasping hand, her rags of green;
The sun down upon that beggar's stare,
All º save when stirred by hunger keen.
An idle spade is lying at her feet,
An idle distaff broken on her knee;
But in her wailmingle soft notes and sweet,
And thro’ her woe break flashes of strange glee.
She is not, sure, a beggar born, for pride
Momently ights that face alſ shrunk and scarred;
"Tis a gaunt skeleton of strength untried,
A wreck of beauty, sore misused and marred.
She might be one of ancient race and strong,
Fallen to fate of harlot and of thrall,
In whom doth jostle memory of wrong
And bitter hopelessness, and hopes of gall.
And as forthfares proud England, day by day,
For toil or º pleasure or º,
Still doth she find this beggar in the way,
Like Lazarus at Dives’ portal laid.
Still that gaunt hand is on her robe of pall,
That hollow voice in her unwilling ear
And ceaseless still that cry for br doth fall,
Which, hunger-prompted, heart of stone must hear.
Nor Pity only bends her to the cry, -
She knows that desperate wretchedness is mad;
*Tis easy raising fire, the means hard º:
And treasonous poison may be cheaply had.
And she is rich, and richer fain would be;
And beggar drudges work for scanty pay;
The pauper's dole for paupers bait may be,
ence better fed and clad would turn away.
So day by day the beggar's dole is given
With grudge and grumble, lin #. and loath-
A charity without that gracious leaven
Which blesseth giver and receiver both.
Every such gift the giver leaves more hard,
d the receiver more unthankful finds;
By acts which should unite is union barred,
And Pity chafes the sore, e'en as it binds.
This should not last—and must not-neither can;
Oh England, lift this beggar-maid forlorn,
Leaving on one, with heart and right of man,
No curse save that whereunto man was born,-
In the brow’s sweat to earn the needful bread;
Strengthen those feeble hands to dig and spin,
- Till listless, lazy Pauperdom be fled,
And the day's workits fair day's wage shall win.
What interest urges, urges also love;
Let England to that beggar stoop her knee,
Lift up her rags, her matted hair remove,
And in that squalid maid a sister see!
Sister, that but step-sister's lot hath known;
Sister, that oft has cursed, and struck, and striven;
Sister, that hath, as England's self must own,
Much to forgive—as much to be forgiven.

oMEHow or the other, young

a monster Brooch as big as a

with which they stop every

female Hobby is an old post-
age-stamp-a small thing, the
reader say, for a young
lady to run away with, but one
which carries, her, at certain
mad times, to the test ab-
stopped for old postage-stamps. Sometimes it is for papering a room;
sometimes it is to i. a lady, whose DRAco of a papa will not let her |
marry before she has collected a million j. : which fact was
actually occurred.
Whether this fearful feat of strength, was ever accomplished, the
female literature of our country, whether you refer to the Char-
toomen of England, or look into the Grandmother's Magazine—most
shamefully fails to tell us. What the use of a million old postage-
stamps could have been to the papa, when he got them, is a profound
mystery, unless he had some great º for making them as good as
new, or had an absurd ambition of dying what is called a millionnaire,
and determined to do the thing to the very letter. This new branch,
however, of the begging profession may bring some little, increase to
our impoverished revenue. The Postmaster-General might advertise
for tenders for old postage-stamps; and, as the number of dead letters
amount to a few millions in the course of a year, no difficulty would
demand. The result should be advertised in the papers; and we would
not mind, for once in the way, throwing open our valuable pages to an
announcement so important as the following:—
“Gover NMENT CoNTRACT.-The Government contract for 1,000,000

offered, being at the rate of 1s. lºd. per 100, has been paid over to the
CHANCELLQR of THE ExchequER. We congratulate the country upon
this decided improvement of its financial resources.”
And then, in another part of our paper, we would, just, for the
curiosity of the thing, publish to the world the following palpitating

PREPARATION FOR THE BAR.
It is a somewhat discouraging fact, that the Benchers of the Middle
Temple, after doing their t to make arrangements for the legal
education of their students, and engaging a first-rate lecturer, were
only able to attract one pupil to the banquet of enlightenment. This
tête-à-tête between the master and the disciple was found very embar-
rassing to both parties, and the Benchers resolved reluctantly to dis.
|
continue it. We understand that MR BRIEFLEss has offered to repeat
his lectures in the Hall of the Middle Temple, to the “one pupil,”
whoever he may be; for the learned gentleman in question is accus:
tomed to the concentration of his energies on a single student, and
will undertake to get him up in any or every branch of the law at the
shortest notice.
THE RUINED ELMS; OR, THE LAMENT OF THE LASS
OF RICHMOND HILL.
“We regret to record the partial destruction of the magnificent Elms on Richmond
Terrace. We understand those noble trees have been mutilated by order of the
West Sheen Westry.”—Evening Paper.
I'LL tell you of a ruthless deed;
And, had I power, as I have will,
Its authors should receive their m
As I’m the Lass of Richmond Hi
Know ye the Terrace Elms, that long
Have crown'd the height, where, blooming still,
Immortalised in gentle song, -
I dwell—the Lass of Richmond Hill?
Those noble trees are pollards now;
I felt each nerve and fibre thrill,
While wretches lopp'd them, trunk and bough,
Wounding the Lass of Richmond Hill.
What butcherly, barbarian hand
Could do this brutish work of ill?
Whose clay-cold heart the ruin plann’d—
Hear, from the Lass of Bichmond Hill.
It was, in truth, a butcher's act,
"Twas his the rising sap to spill,
By West Sheen's muddy Westry back’d—
Believe the Lass of Richmond Hill.
When ye despoiled this lovely scene,
Had ye no tender lambs to kill?
Answer, ye savages of Sheen,
Ah! tell the Lass of Richmond Hill.
WICTUALS AND DRINK.
SoME attempts are being made to supply the Metropolis with pure
water, in lieu of that which is now laid on so uncommonly thick to the
inhabitants of London and the suburbs. Those Members of Parlia-
ment who advocated the vested interests of what are usually called the
Water Monopolies, lost sight of an argument which might have been
fairly used in favour of the old established concerns, on the ground of
their supplying, to their customers a full-bodied liquid, in which are
included not only an ordinary drinkable...but a variety of eatables, pos:
sessed of numerous flavours and qualities. Any one who is at all
acquainted with the internal economy of his own cistern, will be aware
that the depositions of all sorts of matter are so abundant, that there
can be no lack of evidence—when these depositions are ully
examined—of the richness of the fluids supplied by the Water Com-
panies. - -
If we desired to extemporise a dish of small fish, we should only draw
off a pint or two of water, hap-hazard, into one of our saucepans, allow
it to boilin the ordinary course, and, straining the whole through a sieve,
dish up the residue as a º de poison—chemists might call it poison—of
an average character. No wonder that water is found so mutritive of
itself, when we get it impregnated with so much animal food, without
y charge being made for it by the collector of the water-rate. ..
e would advise the established Companies to begin to advertise the
fact as a point in their favour, instead of allowing it to be used any
longer as an argument against them. We scarcely require soup kitchens
when we can get a thick, substantial potage à la Thames, supplied to us
at a comparatively trifling º: ; and when the animal are not
quite so abundant as usual, the Battersea bulrushes serve to impart a
jºle flavour, which renders the mixture a very respectable sort of
len.
The application of the filtering process seems to be an act of waste,
for it is calculated to separate the most nutritious particles of the
mixture from the mixture itself, and these contrivances, instead of being
encouraged, should perhaps rather be condemned, as neutralising the
solidity of the Thames water, when regarded as a substitute for other
diet. We presume that the above considerations weigh with those
persons who so zealously advocate the interests of the existing Com-
panies, and look upon any scheme for the supply of pure water as purely
supernuous.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LODGINGS FOR ANTEDILUWIANS.
THE Athenaeum says that at the recent
dinner of the Geological Society, when
the health of the ARCHBishop of
CANTERBURY was , in connexion
with the British Museum, his Grace,
i.reply, gave his geological friends a
int:-
“He requested that if, in the course of
their researches, they should discover many
more icthyosauri, they would also extend
their search, and find an antediluvian
museum—for the truth was, that the curators
were just now suffering from an embarrass-
ment of riches, and could not find room for
all the treasures they possessed.”
There exists, it seems, a glut of
- - - fossils in the British Museum. If
this is to continue, the Museum must be run up higher, and furnished
with as many stories as the earth has strata. #. curators will other-
wise be puzzled to find house-room for their antediluvian guests, and
will have to poke them into
all sorts of holes and corners.
We shall have mammoths
thrusting their heads out of
the back-windows of the
Museum, to the terror of all
small children in the oppo.
site nurseries. Holes will
have to be cut in upper floors
to admit the beak of some
pterodactylus longirostris, or
other reptile, which may be
at a loss where else to poke
his awkward snout. The legs
of a megalomyr will be let down into a cellar, the mastodon will be turned
up on a sofa, and the deinotheria obliged to sleep three in a bed. Until
some adequate provision is made for their accommodation, it is useless
to disturb, these venerable curiosities in their present iodgings, which,
although situated beneath “the cold ground,” are roomy enough, if not
sufficiently comfortable.
WANTED A JUDGE.
THE ancient tom-foolery of meeting the Judges with a procession of
javelin-men when they enter an Assize town, is now very sensibly dis-
couraged by most of their Lordships, who frequently exercise their inge-
nuity in dodging the High Sheriff and his mountebank myrmidons.
LoRD DENMAN and MR. Justick WILLIAMs managed to give the actors
in the usual mummery the slip the other day at Salisbury; for, arriving
by a railway train in private clothes, they walked arm-in-arm to their
ings as quietly as a couple of private gentlemen. The High Sheriff
and his followers were frantically looking into every carriage for a Judge,
when our learned friend BRIEFLEss, who had arrived by the same train
and popped on his wig instead of a travelling-cap, was mistaken for
a Judge, and pounced upon by the shrieval cortège, which heralded his
exit from the vehicle with a flourish of trumpets, and preceded him to
the door of the Station with all the honours due to the judicial ermine.
MR. BRIEFLESs called upon the parties concerned, to show cause why
he was thus made absolute on the *. ; and an explanation having
been given, the learned gentleman blandly observed, that perhaps some
few years hence he might have the pleasure of accepting the courtesy
that had been shown to him.
Having turned away from BRIEFLEss, the javelin-men made a simul-
taneous rush towards a “ #. beadle, who happened to be upon
the platform; but the High Sheriff immediately seeing the error, i.
off his pack, and made for the lodgings of the Judges, where the party
arrived just in time to see the door closed after LoRD DENMAN and his
colleague had entered. The High Sheriff, with a discomfited air, gave
the word of command to his followers to “fall out,” which they pro-
ceeded to do, by quarrelling as to whose stupidity it was that
occasioned the contretemps.

is too good for it; and surely she cannot have deceived
A WORD OR TWO WITH JENNY LIND.
We believed that we never should have had “words” with our
favourite JENNY; but we are really inclined to be with her for
having, “kept the voice of promise to the ear,” and cruelly, broken it
to the hope, by refusing to sing on the stage of Her Majesty's Theatre.
We fancied, in the first instance, that “the Bishop had done it all;”
and weremonstrated with him i. ; but we suspect that the apos-
tacy of JENNY LIND from the theatre of her grandest triumphs, is an act
for which she alone is accountable. An old saying tells us, that “alittle
bird that can sing and won't sing must be made to sing; ” but we
would not, if we could, resort to coercion in the case of the gentle
Nightingale; but, in the name of the public, we would ask Jenny
LIND if all E. have not had reason to expect that her promissory
notes would become payable in the course of the season; and under this
impression, was it not quite natural that nothing should be done to
.# the deficiency? e all looked for the bill of the Nightingale to
be duly honoured in the Haymarket; and though the manager is too
energetic to be without other resources “in case of need,” the loss,
both to himself and his patrons, cannot be made up very sº
Seriously, we cannot understand the secession of JENNY LIND from
a profession of which she has been the flºº pride and the brightest
ornament. She cannot have allowed flattery to persuadelher that she
belief that the profession could contaminate herself, or degrade her
ei mo or socially; for this would be to repay with a sort of
tacit reproof the kindness that has been shown to her in her private as
well as her public character, º all classes, from the Queen downwards;
and HER #: is not in the habit of bestowing her favour with an
indiscriminate disregard to personal respectability., JENNY LIND can
read SHAKSPEARE, we believe; and he will tell her that—
**Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus,”
These are not the days in which any occupation demanding the ex-
ercise of talent can be looked upon as 4.i. in itself, and JENNY
LIND's secession from the stage must be regarded as indeed a calamity
to the profession; for of her i. it might truly be said, Nihil, tetigi:
quod non ornavit. She made the stage better without, making herself
worse; and it is rather a harsh reflection upon her sister artists, many
of whom are as good and pure, we hope, though without having been
blessed with such means of giving effect to their goodness as herself—
it is, we say, an unkind reflection upon them to don'their common
profession as one of a degrading character. -
It is true we have no right to question the course it may suit a public
performer to adopt, but JENNY LIND has made herself almost necessary
to the public amusement; because she has, it seems, withdrawn at the
eleventh hour from an establishment to which the public, looks for the
perfection of a certain, class, of entertainment, and whose manager
will have the utmost difficulty in supplying the gap that has been so
unexpectedly created.
JENNY LIND is charitable, we know, for she has sung for many
objects of charity; but we venture to ask her whether her refusal to
sing at Her Majesty's Theatre might not have prevented the opening
of the theatre, and deprived hundreds of individuals—the humble
adjuncts who have been necessary to her past triumphs—of the means
of subsistence? The spirit of the management has prevented this
—perhaps at a considerable loss to the proprietor—unless JENNY LINI,
upon reconsideration, determines to save him from a sacrifice, to which
his faith in her may have exposed him.
RIGHT AND TITLE.
PUNCH has been apprised of a prize in the shape of gold, to the
amount of nearly one million sterling, coming home in the brig Pandora,
from California. It appears that there are two or three parties who are
entitled to a share º this result of the ...; but Punch ought
certainly to put in his claim to a slice of the ty, on the ground of
his having given innumerable digs at California.
“BE AISY!” “BE AISY!”

ceeding letter, may we ask the talented, but extremely slow, Secretary-

THE NAVY ON ITS LAST LEGS.
* “SHE walks the waters,” says a first-rate poet, speaking of a very
superior vessel, “like a thing of life.” It º, be feared that there
are too many ships in the British Navy, which, in spite of all that has
been spent upon their construction and re-construction, will never be
able to walk the waters at all. A hºp or a hobble is all that can be
expected of these lame contriyances of the Admiralty. If they were
capable of floating, they should be turned adrift; but as that is impos-
sible, let them be paid off, according to their deserts, and sent begging.
Instead, however, of getting rid ofuseless ships, and incompetent Lords of
the Admiralty, our naval authorities discharge able-bodied seamen. If our
wooden, walls are to be unmanned in this way, how can they be expected
to stand firm in the face of an enemy? One pair of hands must do the
work of two in action, the school of seamanship must be the nautical
drama, and the jack tar must realize on the deck of the enemy the picture
which has been so often presented by Mr. T. P. CookE.
GOOD NEWS FROM INDLA.
..'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good; and that which wafted
hither the last Indian Mail has brought comfort and consolation to
some people. We extract the following paragraph from the Standard:—
“No MoRE REDUctions in the ARMY. —We have very good authority for an-
nouncing, that, in cºnsequence of the disastrous intelligence from India, orders
were on Saturday issued by his Grace the Commander-in-Chief, and circulars were
| despatched by the evening mails to all commanding officers of regiments and depots,
countermauding any further discharge of soldiers from the army. The battles in
India seem to have anticipated the Government in its truckling to Cospen & Co.”
“No more reductions in the Army'"...And they to, whose yº;
thies the above paragraph is directed will doubtless add “Hurrah!”
Hurrah!, Though our dragoons ran away, riding over our artillery—
though the Sikhs, took four of our guns, and half a-dozen stands of
colours – Hurrah! Though our killed and wounded amounted to
between two and three thousand. Never mind the di e, the loss
and the carnage! British valour has sustained a check; but so have the
proceedings of “Cobden & Co.,” and — there are to be no more
reductions in the Army.
A WELL-BRED DOG.
WE have heard from very fº authority that in anticipation of the
very laudable intention of the Attorney-General to abolish the evil
practices of the Palace Court, the Crier of the Court has prevented the
necessity for any further reductions, as far as he is concerned, by
deliberately crying his eyes out.

SoME of the omnibuses which put upon their panels the names of all

and Hammersmith omnibuses in addition to those mere “mockeries,
delusions, and snares,” which fly along the road to tantalise those

ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH OF MR. DISRAELI.
THE speech made by MR. DISRAELI in the House of Commons,
on proposing his resolutions relative to the burdens on agriculture,
was sent for analysis to the laboratory of that eminent chemist Mr.
Punch. It appeared as a mass of watery vapour, nearly equal involume to
a small duodecimo, but which was reduced by condensation into a much
smaller space. On applying the test of MR. Joseph HUME, there was
thrown down a large precipitate of imaginary facts and figures. There
remained in solution a tissue of misrepresentations combined with a great
amount of clap-trap and a considerable portion of fatty matter, that on
examination #. to be gammon: from which substances the liquid
was separated by distillation.
The product which came over was chiefly aqueous; containing, how-
ever, traces of spirit, and a minute quantity of essential principle—which
consisted in easing the landlords of taxation at the expense of the
flºº, and leaving the much-enduring tenant-farmers worse off than
ey are.

The report, which has not been made#. was quite satisfactory to

as there is not yet any scholastic establishment at Wormwood Scrubs,

SHABBY PEOPLE AT COURT.
AvALUED correspondent–valued, at the very least, at 3d, a week-
- rade. It is well
known, that for the good of trade chiefly, if not entirely, the QUEEN
holds her levees and drawing-rooms; HERMAJESTY in all things having
an eye to business, which is the main-stay of her nation and her throne.
Those who present themselves before the sovereign on state occasions
are ºf to appear, we will not say in becoming attire, but in Court
dresses. In short, a levee or a drawing-room is a review of British
manufactures and industry.
correspondent º: that there are vast numbers of persons
who elude the Court regulations respecting dress altogether, and others
who hire their Court dresses from costumiers, to their own shame,
to the detriment of trade, and in contempt of our Sovereign Lady the
QUEEN, her crown and dignity. Certainly, if any traitor wished to
insult his Monarch, we know not how he could do so more effectually
than by treating her as the presiding genius of a masquerade, , Such a
caitiff ought to be taught the difference between St. James's Palace and
Vauxhall. It is monstrous that less respect should be shown to Her
MAJESTY than to her Majesty's Theatre.
But the real truth is, that the Court dress is a masquerade costume.
Anybody would rather go to Court in plain clothes if possible; if not
he would naturally fly to MR. OBBARD or MR. NATHAN. Who woul
É. whilst he could hire, apparel fit only for the Knave of Diamonds?
y the bye, if drawing-rooms are to be masquerades, let them be good
masquerades. Why should visitors be restricted to the footman-like
costume of the last century? Why not assume any fashion of any time?
Why should not PEEL figure in the garb of Ulysses, or the DUKE of
WELLINGTON in the habiliments of Julius Cæsarº -
Let every man who goes to Court appear there in an appropriate cha-
racter; simply in that of a gentleman. If necessary, let him bring a
certificate from his tailor that his clothes are bran-new—made expressly
for the occasion. Have a Board of Black and Blue Cloth, to enforce the
proper regulations; exclude the transgressors of them, and order aiisuch
contumacious wretches under the P. As to the ladies, they may
safely be trusted to wear the newest, most fashionable and finest clothes
they can get. But do away with your Court dresses—which have not
even antiquity to boast of, except when they come out of an old-clothes-

Werles.
STEEPLE-CHASE EXTRAORDINARY.
THE following advertisement appeared lately in a newspaper, which,
we feel bound to state, was not our respected sporting contemporary:-
XCHANGE OF LIVINGS.—OPEN TO ALL ENGLAND AND
SOUTH WALES.—A small Living, for one of larger income. The Pastoral
duty is light, situation convenient, and society good. Full particulars in reply
will meet with confidential attention. Address to A. Z., Post-office, to be left till
called for.
Having made application to A. Z., and ascertained that the º
would be made i right, the backers of the Kicar gf Wakefield and
Hugh Evans (the field being open to a South Cambrian) determined that
they should run a steeple-chase for the stakes. , Both animals, are
touched in the wind, and want change of air, with which they would be
better off, although upon poorer feed. Over the pastoral field, which
was light work, both got well enough, and took several º and sheep-
folds in good style; but, coming upon some heavy glebeland, the Wicº
roke down, and Sir Hugh Evans went in and won, seemingly not at all
distressed. The sport attracted a great show of spectators, with shovel
hats in plenty, and a pretty sprinkling of mitres among them."

ANOTHER BANKRUPT PIER.
WE regret to perceive that a cruel * has been made to drag
no less a member of the Pierage than the Herne Bay Pier into the
Court of Bankruptcy. The noble defaulter gallantly excused himself on
the ground of his not being a trader, and thus the dolce far niente, or
fact of there being “nothing doing,” has at last proved beneficial to his
interests. We are glad that the Herne Bay Pier has been spared this
#. for it would have been shameful to break him up into
vidends, shiver his old timbers, and melt down his ºld iron into
something like a farthing in the pound, at a time when its prospects
are begi to brighten. --
It may be said of Herne Bay, as of many others of a retiring and
secluded nature, that it has only to be known to be admired; and we
must confess, that since we have become better . with Herne
Bay, we have been much struck by its quiet unobtrusive attractions,
which make any one to see it again, who has once paid it a visit;
We trust the noble Pier will be able to keep its head above water; and
we have little doubt of such a result, for the number of its friends
increases every year; and we hope to see its coffers filled with something
better than water, which, when they have been under repair, has too
often flowed into them.

MR. BROWN's LETTERS To A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
T is with the greatest satisfaction, my dear
RoBERT, that I have you as a neigh-
bour, within a couple of miles of me
and that I have seen you established
comfortably in your chambers in Fig-
Tree Court. The situation is not cheer-
ful, it is true; and to clamber up three
pairs of black creaking stairs, is an exer-
cise not pleasant to a man who never
did the performance of the young bar-
rister who lives under you—and, it ap-
}. plays pretty constantly upon the
ench horn—give me any great plea-
sure, as I sate and partook of lift.
in your rooms. Your female attendant
or laundress, too, struck me from her
personal appearance to be a lady addicted
to the use of ardent spirits; and the
smell of tobacco, of which you say some
old college friends of yours had partaken
on the night previous, was, I must say,
not pleasant in the chambers, and I even
thought might be remarked as lingering
in your own morning-coat. However,
I am an old fellow. The use of cigars
- as come in since º time, (and I must
cwn, is adopted by many people of the first fashion), and these
and other inconveniences are surmounted more gaily by young fellows
like yourself, than by oldsters of my standing. It pleased me, how-
eyer, to see the picture of the old house at home over the mantel-piece.
Your college-prize books make a very good show, in your book-cases;
and I was glad to remark in the looking-glass the cards of both our
excellent County members. The rooms, altogether, have a reputable
appearance; and I hope, my dear fellow, that the Society of the Inner
Temple will have a punctual tenant.
As you have now completed your academical studies, and are about
to commence your career in London, I propose, my dear Nephew, to
give you a few hints for your guidance; which, although you have an
undoubted genius of your own, yet come from a person who has
considerable personal experience, and I have no doubt would be useful
to § if you did not disregard them, as, indeed, you will most
probably do. -
With your law studies it is not my duty to meddle. I have seen you
established, one of six pupils in MR. TAPEwoRM's Chambers in Pum
Court, seated on a high-legged stool on a foggy day, with your back to
a blazing fire. At your father's desire, I have paid a hundred guineas
to that eminent special pleader, for the advantages which I have no
doubt you will enjoy while seated on the high-legged stool in his back
room, and rest contented with your mother's prediction that you will
be Lord Chief Justice some day. , May you, prosper, my dear fellow !
is all I desire. . By the way, I should like to know what was the mean:
ing of a pot of porter which entered into your chambers as I issued
from them at one o'clock, and trust that it was not your thirst which
was to be quenched with such a beverage at such an hour.
It is not, then, with regard to your duties as a law-student that I
have a desire to lecture you, but in respect of your pleasures, amuse-
ments, acquaintances, and general conduct and bearing as a young man
of the world.
I will rush into the subject at once, and exemplify my morality in
your own person., Why, Sir, for instance, do you wear that tuft to your
chin, and those sham turquoise buttons to your, waistcoat?. A chin-
tuft is a cheap enjoyment certainly, and the twiddling it about, as I see
you do constantly, so as to show your lower teeth, a harmless amuse-
ment to fill up your vacuous hours. And as for waistcoat-buttons, you
will say, “Do not all the young men wear them, and what can I do but
º artificial turquoise, as I cannot afford to buy real stones?”
. I take you up at once, and show |. why you ought to shave off your
tip, and give up the factitious jewellery. y dear BoB, in spite of us
and aii the Republicans in the world, there are ranks and degrees in life
and society, and distinctions, to be maintained by each man according
to his rank and degree. You have no more right, as I take it, to sport
an º on your chin than I have to wear a shovel-hat with a rosette.
I hold a tuft to a man's chim to be the centre of a system, so to speak,
which ought all to correspond and be harmonious—the whole tune of a
man's life ought to be played in that key.
Look, for instance, at LORD Hugo FitzURSE scated in the private
box at the Lyceum, by the side of that beautiful creature with the
black eyes and the magnificent point-lace, who you fancied was ogling
you through, her enormous spy-glasses. . LORD Hugo has a tuft to his
chin certainly, his countenance grins with a perfect vacuity behind it,
cared for ascending mountains. Nor|.
P| to ridicule for wearing t
and his whiskers curl jº round one of the handsomest and stupidest
countenances in the world. -
But just reckon up in your own mind what it costs him to keep up
that simple ornament, on his, chin, Look at every article of that
amiable and most gentleman-like—though, Iown, foolish-young man's
dress, and see how absurd it is of §. to attempt to imitate him. Look
at his hands (I have the young nobleman perfectly before my mind's eye
now); the little hands are dangling over the cushion of the box, gloved
aS tightly and delicately as a lady's. His wristbands are fastened up
towards his elbows § jewellery. Gems and rubies meander down
his pink shirt-front and waistcoat. He wears a watch with an apparatus
of i. at his waistcoat-pocket. He sits in a splendid side box,
or he simpers out of the windows at WHITE's, or you see grinnlm
out of a cab by the Serpentine—a lovely and costly picture, surrounde
y a costly frame.
Whereas you and I, my good Bob, if we want to see a play, do not
disdain an order from our friend the Nº. Editor, or to take a seat
in the pit... Your watch is your father's old hunting-watch. When we
go in the Park we go on foot, or at best get a horse up after Easter, and
just show in Rotten Row. We shall never look out of WHITE's bow-
window. The amount of LoRD HUGo's tailor’s-bill would support you
and your younger brother. His valet has as good an allowance as you,
besides his perquisites of old clothes. You cannot afford to wear a dandy
Lord's cast of old clothes, neither to imitate those which he wears.
There is nothing disagreeable to me in the notion of a dandy any more
than there is in the idea of a peacock, or a cameleopard, or a prodigious
gaudy tulip, or an astonishingly bright brocade. ere are all sorts of
animals, plants, and stuffs in Nature, from peacocks to tom-tits, and from
cloth of gold to corduroy, whereof the variety is assuredly intended by
ionn Hugo is a useless being, or bestow the least contempt upon him.
Nay, it is right gratifying and natural that he should be, and be as he is
—handsome an # splendid and perfumed, beautiful—whiskered
and empty-headed, a sumptuous dandy, and man of fashion—and what
you young men have denominated “A Swell.” . . -
ut a cheap Swell, my dear Robert (and that little chin-ornament, as
well as certain other indications which I have remarked in your simple
nature, lead me to insist upon this matter rather strongly with you), is
by no means a pleasing object for our observation, although he is pre-
sented to us so frequently. Try, my boy, and curb any little propensity
which you may have to dresses that are too splendid for your station.
You do not want light kid gloves and wristbands up to your elbows,
copying out MR. TAFEwoRM’s Pleas and Declarations: you will only blot
them with lawyer's ink over your desk, and they willimpede your writing:
whereas LoRD Hugo may decorate his hands in any way he likes
becomes the position in life which he fills in so distinguished a manner.
To be sure, since the days of friend Esor, Jackdaws have been held u
i. lumes of birds to whom Nature has affixe
more gaudy tails; but as Folly is constantly reproducing itself, so must
Satire, and our honest Mr. Punch has but to repeat to the men of Qur
generation, the lessons taught by the good-natured Hunch-back, his
predecessor. - -
Shave off your tuft then, my boy, and send it to the girl of your heart
as a token, if you like: and I pray you abolish the ſº.
which I clearly see you have a propensity. As you have a p
at home, served comfortably on a clean table-cloth, and not a d
service of half-a-dozen entrées, such as we get at our County Member's
(and an uncommonly good dinner it is too), solet your dress be perfectly
neat, polite, and cleanly, without any attempts at splendour. Magni-
ficence is the decency of the rich—but it cannot be purchased with half
to be pretty nearly the amount of your worship's income. This point,
I thought, was rather well illustrated the other day, in an otherwise
silly and sentimental book which I looked over at the club, called the
Foggarty Diamond (or by some such vulgar name). Somebody gives the
hero, who is a poor fellow, a diamond pin: he is obliged to buy a new
stock to set off the diamond, then a new waistcoat, to correspond with
the stock, then a new coat, because the old one is too shabby, for the
rest of his attire:—finally, the poor devil is ruined by the diamond
ornament, which he is forced to sell, as I would recommend you to sell
your waistcoat studs, were they worth anything. ..
But as you have a good figure and a gentleman-like deportment, and
as every young man likes to be well attired, and ought, for the sake of
his own advantage and progress in life, to show himself to the best
advantage, I shall take an early opportunity of addressing you on the
subject of tailors and clothes, which, at least, meritaletter to themselves.

celain of human c
THE CLERGYMAN IN NEWGATE.
MR. Davis-Ordinary of Newgate—has made his Annual Report of
the moral condition of his infected flock. Very tender indeed should
be the bowels of our Old Bailey shepherd. The West:end pastor, who
handles the sins of miserable sinners in fine array, and closetted in many
pews, may—and always does—denounce iniquity and peccadillo with a
righteous and affecting vehemence. He turns fashionables inside out,
and shows the rough side of the tapestry. He thunders among the por.
- i. till he makes it º and reverberate. #. it is
different with him when he approaches the wickedness of ignorance—
the crime of unawakened human nature. He looks around this Newgate
flock, and his heart is touched with the knowledge, that of his hundred
infected º there may not be ten who ever knew the care of a shep-
a
herd. They have been suffered to go astray, and in their wandering to
contract all kinds of diseases. Never have they realised the picture of
the Rydal sage-
“A young lamb's heart amid the full-grown flocks.”
And with this conviction, tender indeed, is the heart of the pastor
towards his fore-doomed charge. ...We are fain to hope that, under such
benign influence, MR. Davis cogitated his Annual Report. Let us see.
* In 1 [reports MR. Davis] when persons sentenced to transportation were
ordered to sent abroad, there were 727 transports; in 1844, 527; in 1845, 456; in
1846, 448; but as soon as it became known that transports were detained in England,
they rose in 1847 to 521, and in 1848 to 590.”
. The comfort of board and lodging in the Houses of Correction, with
instruction in trades, infers MR. Davis, caused the r number,
the increase being 521 and 590 on the previous 448. s, the laudable
desire to learn a trade, may have added somewhat to the apparent
number of thieves, -
#. than 50 º and boys are received i Nº. one Nº.
“Women,” says t , “are generally corrupt, in the
first instance, by those of their own sex, and not by men, as it is
enerally imagined.” A truth not commonly allowed. It is well
nown in camps and barracks, that it Molly leave her village for the
fascinations of the scarlet, Molly is never at rest until she has induced
her former acquaintance, Peggy, to become her sister in misery. The
fallen crave for companionship.
“There has been a remarkable diminution in the number of boys committed of late.
From September, 1847, to September, 1848, the total number was 284, and 50 of these
were sentenced to be whipped. MR. DAvis ascribes this decrease to the wholesome effect
of flogging AND To The INCREAse of RAGGEd Schools.”
A satisfactory proof this, that the schoolmaster is the best antagonist
of JACK KETCH, and that flogging, however wholesome, is scarcely so
salutary as teaching. The greater the employment of the primer, the
less the need of the cat.
“No less than six prisoners have been under sentence of death for murder in the
year, and three were executed. The mental sufferings of all these arose not so much
Jrom the dread of death as from their own recollection of the act of murder, all of them
describing their act as being vividly and perpetually present to their imaginations.
Surely, conscience—that terrible NEMEss—is herein the best
avenger. The murderer is continually tortured by the mental repetition
of his atrocity. He writhes in the hell of his remorse. Might he not-
his personal slavery being secured to jº. he not be wisely
left to the hourly horror of his existence? Nevertheless, we hire the
hangman to preach to the world the sacredness of human life, by putting
to death a human creatureſ
“Mr. DAvis describes the capital sentence as being held in extreme dread, [not “ex-
see above], and expresses his conviction, that if it were abolished there would
be far less security to human life, many savage and vindictive animosities being held in
check by the fear of death alone.”
No doubt, MR. Davis is sincere in his belief; as other excellent men,
before him, have held the like sincerity, Worthy graziers believed there
would be far less security for their flocks, were men, not hanged for
sheep-stealing; townsfolk believed there would be far less security for
their purses and watches, were men not hanged for every kind of filching
and stealing:-
“The thirteen convicts ordered for execution were conveyed to Tyburn in five carts,
and executed according to their sentence; most of them were s, the eldest not above
::::::::: some were greatly affected, others so hardened, that they ridiculed the
punishment of death, and laughed at their companions for being afraid of it.”
. The above will be found in the Annual Register of 1770, April 24. And
in this way were men hung up like dogs for the security of property
that is now doubly secure, though thirteen of our fellow-creatures are
not, at one swing, sacrificed at the shrine erected to chattels—the
Tyburn gallows of a Monday morning.
My Bon NY BARK.—Those interesting Writings which appear in the
public prints under the head of “Markets,” ise us that there is
an enormous rise in the #. of English Bark. It is evident from
this gratifying fact, that whatever, may be the º of trade in
general, the trade in Bark is not likely to go—where we might expect
it to find its way to—need we add—the dogs?"
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
R. DRUMMOND is going to bring in a Bill
by which Property will be more easily
transferable than it has been. For our
of our baker's and butcher’s bills, intro-
duced last Christmas, has been to
render the duties of our purse-bearer
considerably lighter than before.
As for H. property, if anybody
really wishes toget †. it, we recom-
mend him to purchase a Llama Paletót,
and having put his silk handkerchief
in one of the pockets behind, to walk
through St. Giles's, leaning on the arms of two talkative friends.
The plan of this Bill for the Conveyance of Property has been sug-
gested by the Parcels Delivery Company, which now conveys all i.
of property in the most economical manner every day,
e'have gianced at this new Bill, and find that all the complicated
indentures will be exploded, and as to the formalities necessary to the
execution of any instrument, it will only be requisite to say,
“I've done the deed,
Didst thou not hear a noise?"
We subjoin a few of the Concise Precedents which will take the place
of the present cumbrous conveyances—just as express-trains have
superseded stage-coaches.

PUNCH WRONG FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE.
It is seldom that Punch commits the smallest error, even by the
merest accident, but he pleads guilty of a misrepresentation, in one of
his tableaua of last week, in which some individuals were shown as in
the act of smoking clay pipes at the Cider Cellars. The proprietor has
pointed out, in a polite note, the mistake of the artist, who naturally
thought that where there was so much, singing, there would also be
Some º; but not being an habitué, his ideas on, the subject were
less clear than they usually are upon things in general... We hasten to
correct this mistake, for it seems that, the smoke arising from a clay
pipe is considered less respectable than the fumes emanating from a
cigar, and we would not, on any account, be instrumental to throwing
a cloud over an establishment on false or mistaken grounds, and we
therefore give the Cider Cellars the full benefit of the exemption from
the evils of common clay which the proprietor repudiates.

PUNCH, OR
121
THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
tRMISS BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
Miss B. REMOVES FROM PIMLIco To ST. JAMEs's.
EAR Mr. Punch,-If you
know what moving is
—(supposing you are not
like some of your sect,
who put their hands in
their #". walk out of
the old house, and only
walk into the new one
when it is all in apple-
pie)—if you know the
trouble of changing your
quarters, with the con-
temporary hurry of feel-
ings, you will, from the
bottom of that cream-
jug, your heart, forgive
my silence these last
two weeks. Upon my
word and honour, when
I looked at §§".
ing paper, and didn't see
*Mººn i. i.it my
bosom turned into a
pincushion stuck sudden through and through, But the fact is, I was
warned out in a minute from Pimlico—the house being taken with
the most shameful want of ceremony §: genteel family from Scotland,
of the name of EL–T—T; come, as I hear, to be ready to fill any place
anywhere, at five minutes' notice, as may be ready for 'em.
Well, now it’s over, I’m in delight, in perfect hysterics at the change!
For here I am, Mr. Punch, in charge of a house—to let, in St. James's ;
here fam with a commandi g prospect of fashionable life, to say nothing
of the Duke on horseback, and SIR ROBERT PEEL, in his primrose
waistcoat, on his way to Parliament. Here I am, with the drawing-
rooms in carriages going to the Palace, with no end of stars and garters
under my very eyes. You should only see the cap I’m making to sit at
the window in at the next deception by the Court.
Having put my few things to rights, and given my cat her milk, and
here, Mr. Punch, a word upon cats that, all along, have been wickedly
scandalised; the feeling race being snubbed only, as it’s my opinion, to
ive a higher lift to nasty dogs—but it’s like the world!, Nobody here
elow gets his proper share of butter to his bread; it's either just a
scrape with the edge of the knife, or it’s laid on by the pound—to
come back to my cat, and, indeed, to the whole speeches in general, Hit
isn't true that cats, like folks in office, don't care a pin for persons, but
only for the place. My own cat Teresa is a proud witness to the con-
trary: whether she laps her milk in Pimlico or St. James's, in Carlton
errace or in May Fair-it's all as nothing, so she laps it with me.
And looking in that cat's eyes, I’d take my avadavat of it, T-she's as
fond of me as if I was her own flesh and blood, which of course I
aint, only using the expression as a Potiphar. -
So little BENJAMIN's been into Egypt again upon the corn business!
And, I must say, another, BENJAMIN's mess he’s made of it; And yet
the young Caucasian tried to do his best in earnest. His love of the
...? is wonderful! And then how proud he is of what he calls the
hereditary aristocracy! I’ll be bound for it, Mr. Punch, there isn't a
curly poodle in high life, as is as proud of his silver collar with the
arms of the noble house cut into it—as is BENJAMIN of the nobility
that makes a pet on him only to bark at the Free Traders. But the
worst, of it is, BENJAMIN has writ story-books; BENJAMIN's a genius,
and therefore can't deal with 'rithmetic. Though (I can't give my
'thority)—though he’s eat a leaf of Mr. Cocker every day 'twixt bread
and butter—though he’s had a Rule-of-Three sandwich every day for
the past month, he can make nothing of figures. No, no; we want a
sound, dull man for that ; and though BENJAMIN's speeches may be
full of lightning, it isn't the lightning of the 'lectric wires, that goes
on any messages, with not a bit more flourish than a ticket-porter. It
was a cruel #. of ironing of LoRI, Russelſ—a man not given to fun
-to wish BENJAMIN might have the Committee, just out of curiosity
to see what he would do with it. This reminds me, Mr. Punch, of some-
thing in Tris(ram Shandy (I never, in course, read the whole book; only
bits), where Mr. Shandy, when he gives a cake to a .# says it was
out of no love to the donkey itself, but only just to see how a donkey
would eat a cake!
That little morsel, Mr. Punch, was pretty when BENJAMIN–winking
hard, as I am told, at LoRD Nugent-talked of HAMPDEN, and said that
the beans-and-bacon blood that had fought º Ship-money, was not
the sort of blood to put up with matters as they were. Why, there was
in that sentence a littlehº held at the head of the House
like a pocket-pistol! There was a Revolution and—and I won't say
what—with BENJAMIN DisBAELI, cropt close for the part, as Oliver
CROMWELL THE SEcond Of course BENJAMIN didn't mean rebellion;
no-not heli, good fellow ! He only meant “cheers;”, and—in course—
had 'em! The speech was all very nice and pretty while it was left alone
-and ought to have been ticketted like the plants at the flower-show to
“admire, but not touch.” The speech was i. a beautiful round bubble
—one ornamented with schismatic colours—and blown from soap-and-
water! And it was—as I can understand—very nice to hear how BEN-
JAMIN's backers clapt and hallooed as it floated along, just as little
boys § and shout at a soap-bubble sailing in the street. And so—like
the bubble—it went sailing on, till it knocked against the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchequER's head, when–where was it? Nowhere! How-
somever, BENJAMIN spoke—as I hear—very serious; taking the wrongs
of the landed nobility as much to heart, as though he was one of 'em ;
as, though he’d been born with a coronet for a caul, and swaddled in
robes of vermine.
There is only one thing that the County of Bucks should remember;
and that is, at the next election to send to Parliament, along with MR.
DisRAELI, the famous MR. SoTHEBY ; he, as one member, could let off
the Vauxhaiſ fireworks, while BENJAMIN spoke 'em; the speech. to
conclude with a grand display of Kat’rine Wheels, BENJAMIN'standing
in the middle of 'em, as he will stand upon a pedestal in Palace Yard-
or the Minories—in i990. This would make the thing perfect: as it
is, though BENJAMIN is shockingly in earnest, the entertainment does
somehow want real fire.
Afore I leave Parli’ment, I’ve a way of putting money in the pockets
of the members., M.R. MUNTZ read a certain ironmonger's bill from
Birmingham; whereupon, some malicious creature cried out—“It’s a
puff!”. And, I ask, why not? If members knew what power they’d
in their , mightn't they, turn a penny, by it?, I don't see why
even BENJAMIN himself º: weave in his ...i. half-a-dozen lines
from the House of Moses—why MR. MUNTz shouldn’t give a flourish
to Rowland's Macassar—and Colonel, SIRTHoRP say a word for
MR. TugxER's geese. A word's enough; if advertisers are wise,
they’ll drop the newspapers and go to Parliament.
. So I see the Bishop of ExETER’s in a breeze again! Isn't there a
bird that’s called MoTHER CAREY's chicken, a bird that's only, seen in
foul weather? It’s all with ill-luck, I’m sure, but that blessed Bishop
is the chicken of Mother Church. We never seem to hear of him, but
squalls follow. , Why, Mr. Punch, I see he’s put a parson into gaol for
W.". locked up a real parson for what the Bishop calls contempt:
[R. SHORE preaches the Gospel, and that's. º: of a Bishop,
MR. ShoBE—being debarred, his regular pulpit—preaches in a Chapel,
and that’s an insult to the Church Established. Once a parson, always
a parson, says the Bishop; which, in MR. ShoBE's case, means—once
out of bread, always out of bread. And so the Bishop' locks up MR.
SHORE; the Bishop claps the clergyman, in gaol to show himself the
better Christian. After all, there’s no change in the Bishop himself;
once Exeter, always Exeter!
Well, it was a little different with the REv. M.R. Hazlewood—there
was a trial about him last week at Lincoln. He was so fond of rum, he
forgot his Prayer-book. “I found the psalms and lessons for Mr.
HAZLEwood,” says the clerk in the triaſ—“but could not keep him
right. He read the psalms for Easter Sunday on Good Friday... He
often smelt of rumſ.” And still it, seems, he was allowed to die a
parson—in what I believe is called, the odour of orthodoxy, which is
not rum. Upon my life, Mr. Punch, this is too bad... If a parson isn't
to lose his dignity, when he loses his morals, why, all that the wicked
will say is this, -morals have nothing to do with a cle You
may drum a common soldier out of the common army for bad manners
—but, it seems, to the disgrace of the ranks, you must not out a
culprit of the Army of Martyrs. If such dirty doings are to be govered
}. I dºn't wonder that the aprons of the Church are as black as
they are
º, turn from these things to the sweet field of letters—as MR. LovE-
LACE calls them—and I’m in º es that that dear one of the force
will have his beat removed from §. here—to touch upon books
like a butterfly on flowers, I am so happy to see by the papers that
“G. P. R. JAMEs, Esq.” is going—or is gone-to “edit” a romance.
But here’s the strange, the delightful part of the story:-
“No greater guarantee as to its excellence can be advanced, than the fact of so
established a writer as MR. JAMEs becoming its sponsor, especially when it is well
known that large sums have been frequently offered to him to edit works, and that he
has invariably declined such propositions.”
Which I suppose means, that MR. JAMEs, not expecting to give to
the world any new books of his own, takes care of a stranger's; just as
folks, who don't expect any more family on their own account, advertise
to dry-nurse the babies of other º -
If I’m wrong, to be set right by such a gentleman as Mr. JAMEs will
delight and honour, -
Yours, with a respectful curtsey,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVAIRI.
OLD BAILEY DRAMAS.
Now that the theatrical nature of the attractions at the Old Bailey
has been re ised by the open and undisguised letting of the galleries
at a certain price, to be obtained by making a charge for admission, we
think the speculators have a right to demand the enjoyment of the usual
facilities for going publicly to a place of entertainment open to the
public in general.
Should the thing pay largely, and hold out a prospect of increased
profits, the lessee may be tempted to form engagements by special
retainer, with some of the most attractive members of the forensic pro-
fession—whose scarcity, by the way, enhances their value, most con-
siderably—who might perhaps be inclined to accept special retainers,
and appear “for one trial only,” at the Central Criminal Court. Such
an announcement as, “MR. So-AND-So"—we beg pardon if the paucity
of briance at the bar prevents a name from coming at once into our
minds—such an announcement, we repeat, as, “MR. So-AND-soin'two
Cases,” would form a very taking “poster” for the dead-walls of the
metropolis.
We are almost old enough to remember when the Trial of THURTELL
was dramatised over the water, and
"THE IDENTICAL, GIG-"
formed a single line in the play-bill, until the run of the gig, was pre:
vented by the interference of the authorities, and the “Identical
Horse” was pulled up rather short, with a threat of the discontinuance
of the Manager's licence. These were very º regarded as wholly
illegitimate sources of attraction; but as the peculiar business of the
Old Bailey is well known, and the galleries are let without disguise,
it would be an affectation of delicacy to pretend that the proceedings at
the Central Criminal Court might not be consistently advertised for the
purpose of attracting the public to the Trials. . Such a poster as the
one * would not be out of character with the facts we have
stated.
:
Every accommodation should be afforded to thefrequenters of th
e -
leries, and an usher going round with “Apples, Oranges, Nuts, #:
Indictment, Ginger Beer,” would be a great convenience to the audience.
If the system, goes on we should not be º to hear of BALLAN-
TINE being called for at the close of a speech, or SERIEANT WILKINs
º smothered alive in a shower of bouquets; while some of the
smaller fry, who are in the habit of substituting arrogance or bullying
for incapacity and emptiness, might some day “come in.” for a shower
of orange-peel from the gallery, or at all events a sound hissor two that
would greatly disturb the dignity of the Court. When the public are
made to pay for what they see and hear, they will expect the privilege
of expressing an opinion, and therefore the system of payment should
be abolished at once, for if the persons in the gallery are charged for
ssion, they will insist on the right to money's worth for their money,
and then, woe to those forensic performers who have nothing but bully
and bluster, vanity and virulence, emptiness of head andfulness of mouth,
to rely u on. Paner, res ct for the dignity and decency of every

for the increasing wretchedness of #. age. With him time, produces
nothing that is not smaller than what preceded it. We doubt if, with |
him, the hail-stones of the next storm will be comparable to the mag-
nificent. hail-stones of last summer. All things with Mr. D. are

scarcely so vivid as the wit of CANNING.
“There was a time when the country had some national faith; when men Yº:

And now we have no patriotism—no reverence—no religion. Cotton

EUROPE, at the present moment, ought to be in a sounder state than
ever, if you only consider its number of new Constitutions. Austria has
ot a new Constitution, Prussia has got anew one, and France, who all
ast year was very weak though its general system lately has been a |
little stronger, has also had a new Constitution. These Constitutions |
may last º advice to support them, but it is strongly feared
that quacks will do their best to * and upset them. We recom-
mend Prussia to be very particular with its Diet, and France not to
leave its chamber till it, is strong enough, and would impress upon
Austria and all three of them to remain as quiet as they possibly can.
Constitutions, like, certain jellies, require being left to themselves for
some time before they will settle down: turn them out before they are
perfectly firm, and they will not stand a day. :

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 123
A WISIT TO ASTLEY’S.
THE attractions of the Cirque National, at Drury Lane,
have perhaps drawn away our attention too long from
“those dear scenes of youth,” which Astley’s always
resents to us. Memory still wraps herself up in †.
ussar uniform, formerly worn by WIDDIcomb, who
has lately destroyed all iº by resorting to the ha-
biliments of every day life, and has not only smothered
romance in a white waistcoat, but has suffocated
ideality in the body-coat of common-place humanity.
WIDDIcomb himself is still the same as ever; but
when we ask for that jacket which used to have such
a thorough laceing all over it, as to be equivalent to a
thorough good hiding—or concealing—of the cloth
underneath, we are amazed at the miserable substitute,
and on afurther inspection of his attire
“We start, for frogs are wanting there.”
Since the abdication of the EMPEROR GQMERsAL, and the retirement
of CARTLITCH into the privacy of a public-house, Astley's had lost
some of its ancient ..". but there are symptoms of a revival of its
best days, its loudest lungs, and its reddest fires. Corasco, or the
Warrior's Steed, is a piece quite worthy of the old reputation of the
Amphitheatre. There is an ironical Warrior who asks a “Churrrlish
Priest” whether. “ Mother Nature” does not. “call on yer to rispect
her sakered dictates which speak with thundering elowquence to e'en
the sterenest heart.” There is an “age-ed pare-ent” who is con:
stantly, “strºruggell-ing” 'twixt those constant competitors Love and
Duty,” until the former prevails; and for the sake of his “Chyild,” he
gets knocked on the heaſin an Astley's mêlée.
There is a low comic character who in his capacity of “Cook to the
Temple,” chaffs the High Priest, and while being ordered for “instunt
execution” by that dignitary, expresses a wish that his basting-spoon
were at hand to enable him to baste the Pontiff. There is a Princess
ferociously in love with, the wrong man, clutching him by his chintz-
curtain tunic, and exclaiming, “Ye shall not tearrr him from this lace-e:
rated bosom,” until half-a-dozen “Sbirri” in white night-gowns pull
off the Princess (OP); and as many “slaves” in red calico shirts d.
off the beloved warrior (PS).
There is in addition a faithful steed, who occasionally runs on at one
wing, and off at the other, which causes the Warrior to shout out—
“Ha! my gallant courser warns us of danger;” though the fact is, the
sagacious brute sees nothing more dangerous than a man holding a sieve
of oats, for which the “faithful steed” makes, with a º
perfectly natural. , Nevertheless, the whole effect is admirable; and as
‘we must not look a gift-horse in the mouth,” we have no right to ask
whether the “faithful steed” is munching a handful of corn, when he
returns from some movement sup sed to have been prompted by
fidelity to his master—our friend |. Warrior.”
. But, the scenes in the Circle are the strong point at Astley's—par-
ticularly when such an equestrian as young HERNANDEz is attached to
the establishment. His exploits are performed with, such ease, that
however daring his attempts, we feel perfectly sure that they will be
successful. It seems to be all the same to him whether he comes down
upon one leg or two, whether he alights on the back of the horse or on
the neck, and whether he jumps backwards or forwards over a single
scarf or over half-a-dozen. Whatever he wishes to do, he does, and
Without any apparent preparation, or the smallest probability of failure.
His º: seem to be wholly irrespective of the horse, and he
spends a far greater proportion of the time occupied by his performance
in the air than on the back of the animal.
We regret that we cannot express our perfect satisfaction at some
of the other proceedings in the Circle, and we must particularise the
Clowns, who, in attempting to infuse freshness into their jokes, have lost
that staleness which gave them such a relish. Long-winded common-
place stories, and hackmeyed songs, have succeeded to those delicious bits
of what WIDDIcomb still terms “facetia,” and WIDDIcomb himself
has assumed the º: of the Petit Maitre instead of that of the “spangled
Officer,” in which he earned our youthful homage. WIDDIcomb's small
talk may be well enough in the Salons de la Haute Société, but in his own
peculiar Circle—the Ring at ASTLEy's—if he were to make his smalltalk
still smaller, it would be, to us, more acceptable.
The Clowns had much better confine themselves to what Joe MILLER
has set down for them, than attempt an originality which is not
original, and soar into a sort of philosophy which puts the audience,
or, at least, ourselves, into a temper anything but philosophical.
It would be really refreshing to be asked once more, from the Ring at
AstLEY'S, whether our Mother knows of our being out, or to listen to
the *. which used to be made º to WIDDIcomb, as to
º e Clown was expected to go, for to do, for to fetch, for to bring,
or to carry.
MR. HUME, YOU'RE WANTED
To Move—the Triumphal Arch opposite Buckingham Palace to some
spot where it will not be destroyed, or completely sacrificed. ..
To Move—the Trustees of the British º to make a little more
haste about their interminable Catalogue. -
To Move—Smithfield Market to some suburb where it is likely to
have elbow room, so that the beasts may not be deprived, before death,
of all the animal comforts. -
To Move—all the Powers under the Sun to give the Common
Council a little common sense. -
To Move—the friends of DEPUTY Hicks to look after him.
The Law of Arrest Abridged.
A coRREspondent who signs himself “An M. P. IN DIFFICULTIES.”
writes to inquire if we can inform him whether the Thames lies in Mid-
dlesex or Surrey P or in neither? or if only in one, in which one His
object for inquiring, he states, is because he has been in hot water ever
since he i. in Parliament, and he would not mind occupying so
cool a retreat as one of the towers of Hungerford Bridge (both of
which are untenanted), if he thought he should be free from those perse-
cutions which are likely, when a certain measure is passed, to make his
time like the articles ticketed, in the linendrapers' shops; “VERY
CHAs(t).ED INDEED.” We should advise our distressed P. to rent
both towers, and then he can change his residence according to the
county from which he saw danger approaching. By this means he will
be safe on both sides.
ORIGIN OF THE FONETIC MYSTERY.
WE fancy we have at last discovered the origin of our §º.
contemporary, de Fonetic Nuz, whose number for dis week is being
pertinaciously advertised. We look upon the paper as a great “Ethio-
pian Organ,” designed as an accompaniment to the Serenading Parties
that have, within the last three or four years, immigrated into London
and the provinces. The Fonetic, spelling is evidently based on the
same principles as those which have regulated the orthºgraphy of
Jim Crow, Biffalo Gals, Clare de Kitchen, and the rest of the Nigger
Melodies.—Br. Gr. - -
“Toder Sunda mornin' I
Put on my dandi coat,
An' went down to Grinige,
'Pon a steam bote.
Wheel about,” &c.
We should not be astonished to hear that DUMBOLTON is a contributor
to de Fonetic Nuº, and that PELL is resting his bones in a life of literary
leisure as sub-editor of the Journal. We do not expect the Fonetic
movement will progress very rapidly, for few of us will send our English,
as we do our horses, to be i. and we shall prefer our Language
in its sane or entire state, rather than adopt the Orthographical mono-
mania which our Fonetic friends are afflicted with.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
THE great question of the present day is, “What shall we do with our
convicts?” An inhuman wretch suggests that they should be sent to
Ireland. We must protest in the most emergetic manner against any
such proposition, for we can scarcely conceive any ºffence that is
deserving of so severe a punishment. We only ask the monster in
human form, from which this cruel suggestion emanates, “How would
he like it himself?”

to keeping rare Hours. Thereat was a goodly Company of about an
hundred, and the Women all very fine, my Wife being in her last Year's
Gown, which I am tired of, and do hate to see. We did fall to dancing
Quadrilles, wherein I made one, and had for my Partner a comely Damsel,
whom after the Dance was ended, did hand to a Sofa, and thereon sit me
by her Side; but seeing my Wife looking hard at us, did presently make
my Bow, and so away. Then to look on while some did dance the
Polka, which did please me not much, for had beheld it better danced at
the Casino, and do think it more suitable to such a Place than to a
Drawing Room. The Young Fellows did take their Partners by the

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
ON TAILORING-AND TOILETTES IN GENERAL.
UR ancestors, my dear Bop,
have transmitted to you, in
common with every member of
our family, considerable charms
of person and figure (of which
fact although you are of course
perfectly aware,lº.
of course, you have no objec-
tion to be reminded); and with
these facial and co en-
dowments,afew words respect-
ing dress and tailoring, may
not be out of place; for nothing
is trivial in life, and everything
to the philosopher has a mean-
ing. in the old joke about
a pudding which has two sides,
namely an inside and an out-
P side, so a coat or a hat has its
s inside as well as its outside;
i I mean, that there is in a man's
exterior *: the conse-
|. of his inward ways of
5 thought, and a gentleman who
: dresses too grandly or too ab-
# surdly, or tooshabbily, has some
oddity or insanity, or meanness
in his mind, which developes
itself somchow outwardly in
the fashion of his i.
.Noman has a right todespise
- - -- - his dress in this world. There
is no use in flinging any honest chance whatever, away. For instance,
although a woman cannot be expected to know the particulars of a
gentleman's dress, any more than we to be acquainted with the
º: nomenclature, or proper cut of the various articles which those
ear creatures wear; yet to what lady in a society of strangers do we
feel ourselves most naturally inclined to address ourselves?—to her or
those whose, appearance, pleases us; not to the gaudy, over-dressed
Dowager or Miss:—not to her whose clothes, tº: are put
on in a slatternly manner, but to the person who looks, neat, and trim,
and elegant, and in whose person we fancy we see exhibited indications
of a natural taste, order, and ...; If Miss SMITH in a rumpled
gown, offends our eyesight, though we hear she is a young lady of great
genius and considerable fortune, while Miss Jones in her trim and
simple attire attracts our admiration; so must women on their side, be
attracted or repelled by the appearance of gentlemen into whose com-
pany they fall. If you are a tiger in appearance, you may naturally
; to frighten a delicate and timid female; if you are a sloven, to
offend her: and as to be well with women, constitutes one of the
chiefest happinesses of life; the object of my worthy Bob's special atten-
tion will naturally be, to neglect no precautions to win their favour.
Yes: a good face, a good address, a good dress, are each so, many
points in the game of life, of which every man of sense will avail him-
self. . They help many a man more in his commerce with society than
learning or genius. It is hard often to bring the former into a drawing-
room : it is often too lumbering and unwieldy for any den but its own.
And as a KING CHARLEs's spaniel can snooze. before the fire, or frisk
over the ottoman-cushions and on to the ladies' laps, when a Royal
j. would find a considerable difficulty in walking up the stairs,
and subsequently in finding a seat; so a good manner an º: will
introduce you, into many a house, where you might knock in vain for
admission, with all the learning of Porson in your trunk.
It is not learning, it is not virtue, about which people inquire in
society. It is manners. It no more profits me that my neighbour at
table, can construe Sanscrit and say the Encyclopædia by heart, than
that he should possess half a million in the Bank (unless, ič, he gives
dinners; when, for reasons obvious, one's estimation of him, or one's
desire to please him, takes its rise in different sources), or that the lady
whom I hand down to dinner, should be as virtuous as Cornelia or the
late MRs. HANNAH MoRE. What is wanted for the nonce is, that
folks should be as agreeable as possible in conversation and demeanour;
so that good humour may be said to be one of the very best articles of
dress one can wear in society; the which to see exhibited in LADY X’s
honest face, let us say, is more }*. to behold in a room, than the
filº of LADY Z.'s best diamonds. And yet, in point of virtue, the
atter is, no doubt, a perfect dragon. But virtue is a home quality:
manners are the coat it wears when it goes abroad.
Thus, then, my beloved Bob, I would have your dining-out suit hand-
some, neat, well made, fitting you naturally and easily, and yet with a
certain air of holiday about it, which should mark its destination. It
is not because they thought their . was much improved by the
ornament, that the ancient philosophers and topers decorated their old
pates with flowers (no wreath I know, wo make some people's
mugs beautiful; and I confess, for my part, I would as lief wear a horse-
collar or a cotton night-cap in society, as a coronet of polyanthuses or a
garland of hyacinths):-it is not because a philosopher cares about dress |
that he wears it; but he wears his best as the sign of a feast, as a bush
is the sign of an inn. You ought to mark a festival as a red-letter day,
and you put on your broad and spotless white waistcoat, your finest
linen, your shiniest boots, as much as to say “It is a feast; here I am,
clean, smart, ready with a good appetite, determined to enjoy.”
You would not enjoy a feast if you came to it unshorn, in a draggle-
tailed dressing-gown. You ought to be well dressed, and suitable to it.
A very odd and wise man whom I once knew, and who had not (as far
as one could outwardly judge,) the least vanity about his personal .
ance, used, I remember, to make a point of wearing in large Assemblies a
most splendid gold or crimson waistcoat. He seemed to consider himself
in the light of a walking bouquet of flowers, or a moveable chandelier.
His waistcoat was a piece of furniture to decorate the rooms; as for
any personal pride he took in the adornment, he had none: for the
matter of that, he would have taken the garment off, and lent it to a
waiter—but this Philosopher's maxim was, that dress should be handsome
upon handsome occasions—and I hope you will exhibit your own taste
upon such... You don't suppose that people who entertain you so º:
tably have four-and-twenty lights in the dining-room, and still and dry
champagne every day?—or that my friend, MRs. PERKINs, puts her
drawing-room door under her bed every night, when there is no ball?
A young fellow must dress himself, as the host and hostess dress them-
selves, in an extra manner for extra nights. Enjoy, my boy, in honesty
and manliness, the goods of this life."f would no more have you refuse
to take your glass of wine, or to admire (always in honesty) a pretty girl,
than dislike the smell of a rose, or turn away your eyes from a landscape.
“Neque tu choreas ºperne, puer,” as the dear old Heathen says; and, in
order to dance, you must have proper pumps wherein to spring and
whirl lightly, and a clean pair of gloves, § which you can take your
partner's pretty little º -
. As for particularising your dress, that were a task quite absurd and
impertinent, considering that you are to wear it, and not I, and remem-
bering the variations of fashion. When I was presented to H. R. H.
the Prince Regent, in the uniform of the Hammersmith Hussars, viz., a
yellowjacket, pink, pantaloons and silver lace, green morocco boots
and a | blue pelisse lined with ermine, the august Prince himself,
the model of grace and elegance in his time, wore a coat, of which the
waist-buttons were placed between his Royal shoulder-blades, and which,
if worn by a man now, would cause the boys to hoot him in Pall Mall,
and be a uniform for Bedlam. Tfbuttons continue their present down-
ward progress, a'man's waist may fall down to his heels next year, or
work upwards to the nape of his neck after another revolution: who
knows? Be it yours decently to conform to the custom, and leave your
buttons in the hands of a good tailor, who will place them whereyer
fashion ordains. A few general rules, however, may be gently hinted to
a young fellow who has perhaps a propensity to fall into certain errors.
Eschew violent sporting-dresses, such as one sees but too often in
the parks. and public places on the backs of misguided young men.
There is no objection to an ostler wearing a particular costume, but it
is a pity that a gentleman should imitate it. 'I have seen in like manner
young fellows at Cowes attired like the pictures we have of smugglers,
buccaneers, and mariners in Adelphi melodramas. I would like my
Bob to remember, that his business in life is neither to handle a curry-
comb nor a marline-spike, and to fashion his habit accordingly. .. -
If your hair or clothes do not smell of tobacco, as they sometimes it
must be confessed do, you will not be less popular among ladies. And
as no man is worth a fig, or can have real benevolence of character, or
observe mankind properly, who does not like the society of modest and
well-bred women; respect their prejudices in this matter, and if you
must smoke, smoke in an old coat, and away from the ladies. . .
Avoid dressing-gowns; which argue dawdling, an unshorn chin, a lax
toilet, and a general lazy and indolent habit at home. Begin your day
with a clean conscience in every way. . Cleanliness is honesty. A man
who shows but a clean face and hands is a rogue and hypocrite in society,
and takes credit for a virtue which he does not possess. And of all the
advances towards civilisation which our nation has made, and of most of
which MR. MACAULAY treats so eloquently in his lately ublished History,
as in his lecture to the Glasgow Students the other day, there is none
which ought to give a philanthropist more pleasure, than to remark the
great and increasing demand for bath-tubs at the ironmongers; Zino-
Institutions, of which our ancestors had a lamentable ignorance.
And I hope that these Institutions will be universal, in our country
before long, and that every decent man in England will be a Companion |
of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. BRowN THE ELDER.
* Note to the beloved Reader.—This hint, dear Sir, is of course not intended to º
personally to you, who are scrupulously neat in your person; but when you look aro
you and see how many people neglect the use of that admirable cosmetic, cold water,
you will see that a few words in its praise, may be spoken with advantage.

| EveR anxious to diffuse happiness and enjoyment, we have a plan to
propose for affording to º, facilities for partaking of the
leasures of the Steeple-Chase. ersons in London, engaged in
business, can seldom find time to indulge in this exciting pastime, as
the scene of it generally lies in some remote locality. We therefore
suggest the establishment of a Metropolitan Steeple-Chase Hippo-
drome, in which all the finest features of the best ground across the
country, shall be carefully included., Successively, and at suitable
distances along the course, we would have duly arranged a spiked five-

barred gate, a quagmire, a bank, with chevaur-de-frize, a tank, a fence
of spear-headed iron railings, a deep pit, and a number of man-traps;
besides a variety of high hedges and concealed ditches, º:
and tile-shards, and broken bottles... In short, we would render the
Hunting-Ground replete with all possible sources of danger to, life and
limb, and with every convenience for being impaled, smothered, drowned,
or having backs, arms, legs, or necks, broken. For this is the species
of entertainment for man and horse, in which alone, as far as we
can discover, the peculiar fun of a Steeple Chase consists. .
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES.
THERE are many Members of Parliament who by way of finding some-
thing to say, are in the habit of popping ". every now, and then to
‘ask a question” of a Cabinet Minister. some of these querists,
the feeling is like that of the Sweep who was satisfied to be spoken to
by a Lord, though it was only to be told to “Get out of the way;”
and with the same spirit—or rather, want of spirit—there are many
ordinary individuals who delight in ºil. ressed by a Minister,
though it should only be to be snubbed by ., Besides, it is so very
easy to ask a question: and there are so many who possess this sort of
questionable capacity, which enables them though they can make
nothing else answer, to obtain an answer from a member of the Govern-
ment. The º: Ministers are exceedingly amiable in this respect,
and will vouchsafe a reply to the merest pieces of impertinent curiosity;
but we advise them not to encourage the practice of frivolous question-
ing too much, lest it should be necessary to create a new office—similar
to that which, we presume, must exist in the Bureaua of some of the
weekly papers—namely, an official intrusted with the duty of answering
every inquiry that may be made De omnibus rebus et (plus-quam)
quibusdam aliis.
We should recommend that for each Secretary of State, and j.
| other member of the Ministry, a letter-box be opened into which
queries may be dropped; and that a list of
Ministerial Answers to Correspondents
be printed every day, with the votes of the House of Commons.
We can understand the series commencing with something like the
following:—
“M.P., who is anxious to be made acquainted with the measures of
the Government, is informed that we never measured them.
‘B+H-RT-N., Certainly. His proposition to leave off business
at 12 o'clock, will be treated as an open question; but the suggestion

civility entitles him to fall under the head of Civil Contingencies.
. “S–B–P. The Horse Guards Clock was not stopped purposely
in the autumn, to give more time—and consequently a longer existence
—to the present Government. To the other question, “When they mean

forthcoming to occupy whatever room may be made for them.”

A PETITION EXTRAORDINARY FROM THE SHIPS IN
ORDINARY.
HERE’s thirteen on us alla-lyin’—
Thirteen lime-o'-battle ships,
As little thought they’d leave us fryin',
In the sun our seams a dryin',
Where first they turned us off the slips.
So we’umbly ax your Lordships
Not to break our 'arts of º
We an’t soft ships to fear 'ardships,
We’d be glad to serve as guardships,
Or carry any sort of folk.
Tho' it was hemigrants or sodgers—
Anything afore them rats,
Which now they is our only lodgers;
For well they knows, the artful dodgers,
The Board don’t stand the expense of cats.
Some on us from Portsmouth hails,
From Rochester and Woolwich others,
That never had a suit o' sails—
We, nor our little frigate brothers—
While old ships that might be our mothers,
Isthrashin' thro' all sorts o' gales.
Yet here we lies, each on his bed of
Green Thames mud, wich strong do smell:
Each eatin, we may say, his 'ead off,
Fine ships as eler you ered or read of,
And ne'er of work can get a spell!
Yes—here from port to starboard slewin’
With the tide, so slow and sad—
At our moorings muffin doin',
We lies tumblin' into ruin, -
Shiver our timbers, it’s too bad!
Surveyors say, we’re loose and battered,
And noways fit to stand the sea!
Our knees is weak, our 'eads is shattered,
Our ribs, from taffrail unto cat-head,
They isn't what ribs ought to be.
Our rotting an’t from wind or weather,
it must be wot they calls dry rot;
Yet oak and copper, hemp and leather,
Along o' lying years together,
Is goin’ wisibly to pot!
Please you, my Lords, we thinks it funny,
When in the newspapers we reads,
How poor John BULL arm’t got no money,
Yet H. a stoopid son of a gun, he
His idle wessels keeps and feeds.
He’s got old first-rates in commission,
New first-rates fittin' at the docks;
He’s got adwanced ships, in addition,
And us, in ordinary, wishin'
As how we’d never left the stocks.
Then, pray, don't use us so no more,
We ax commissioned for to be—
Nor let the buoy that’s at the Nore
Be to an old man grown, afore
We wretched wessels gets to sea!
“GREY's THE FAVOURITE"
SIR GEORGE GREY must have a particular talent in refusing a favour.
It seems to be an actual pleasure in being refused by him. Where
another minister would irritate, he only softens, and sends away persons
quite delighted with their unhappy fate. He certainly has some peculiar
patent for saying “No,” which we should advise all overseers, railway
clerks, box-keepers, prime ministers, and other gentlemen, who generally
deal in negatives in the most negative manner, to look into, and see if
they cannot copy it. This savoir faire, or rather savoir rien faire, of SIR
GeoRGE's is most conspicuous at the Home Office, where he receives
gentlemen as strangers, who leave him as friends. Every audience he
gives widens his circle of admirers; for we are sure there has not been
a deputation lately, asking for several millions, or only for a few, but what
the conference has concluded in the following agreeable manner:—“The
Hon. Members then withdrew, every one expressing his gratification at
the extremely courteous manner in which he had been received by the
Home Se ry.” His greatest triumph, however, has recently been
achieved—he has even pleased an Irish flºº “who retired
delighted, though all empty-handed.” This is ius!
DRAWING IT RATHER TOO MIL’D.
THE Americans have lately, commenced the practice of drawing
pretty largely on our credulity, by the exhibition of drawings purport-
ing to rival the Sea Serpent in length; and BANVARD's Three-mile
ainting has just been surpassed by one of four miles of the Gulf of
exico.
We presume the American artists can draw long bows as well as long
rivers; and we suspect that if we were to measure either of the
Monster Paintings § a three-feet rule, the claims of the artists to
credence, might be four-feited, on the spot.
We are not aware that a picture, any more than a poem, is to have
its merits determined by its length; but even if it were so, originality
would assuredly go for something, and the BANVARD Painting of Three
miles, must at i. events be preferred to the one of Four, which is
evidently suggested by the success of the picture already exhibited.
We despise plagiarism in shape, and the public will be found to
; with us pretty ge on this point; so that, if the Mexico
Air is but a plagiarism upon the Mississippi painting, the views
of the owner of the former are not likely to be realised to any great
extent, or to realise anything.
We were in hopes that the age of monstrosities had nearly passed, and
that we ourselves had administered the last thump to Monster Drums,
besides having given the final blow to JULLIEN’s Monster Ophicleide.
These Monster Paintings appearlike a revival of the age of monsters, and
we may apprehend that er Posting-bills will be required extending
along the fronts of the houses of entire streets, to be en suite with the
exhibitions they are intended to direct attention to.
We trust the artists will not adopt the “Gigantic Dodge” in the
works of Art they intend for the ensuing exhibitions. Should the at-
tempt be made, the evil will cure itself; for whatever size a canvas may
be, the result would be as in the sketch annexed, where a single foot
may be seen monopolising the space that an entire picture ought to
occupy.

BEGGARY IN BELGRAVIA.
In justice to the MARQUIs of WesTMINSTER, we must correct a
prevalent impression that he is an enormously wealthy man. A corres-
pondent of the Morning Post states, that, in Queen's Road, Belgravia,
the property of the noble, Marquis, the lamps, the watering, and the
repair of the road, have all been discontinued; insomuch that the dust
in it is several inches thick, and it is infested at night, with thieves and
other had characters—that his Lordship's father made a contract with
the Woods and Forests to keep it in good repair, but that the Marquis
refuses to fulfil that covenant. The Post adds, that the noble Lord is
paid a ground-rent by every house in the district, and, we are, sorry to
say, lends its authority to the delusion that he derives a princely income
from this property. e are warranted by the circumstances, of the
case, which would otherwise be impossible, in protesting that the
MARQUIs of WESTMINSTER is as poor as a poet; in short, in a state
bordering upon destitution. We must say, we think the public ought
to come forward, and relieve that poverty on the part of the noble
Marquis, which alone can account for the beggarly state of Queen's
Road, Belgravia; and we shall have much pleasure in forwarding to his
Lordship any coppers that may be sent for him to our office.

THE RETURN OF JENNY LIND.
THE truant JENNY LIND is about to re-appear at Her Majesty's Theatre,
and though the arrangements already advertised do not promise an uncon-
ditional return to her allegiance, there is, at all events, a disposition shown to
make some atonement for the loss that, had been threatened to the public. We
are promised six Concerts, which will be, in fact, six Operas. There will be full
chorus, full band, and full everything, except dresses and scenery. It seems very
| unfair and illiberal to impute to those concerned in producing the accessories of
costume and scenery the entire sin of a theatrical entertainment—supposing there
to be anything sinful in the matter, which is one of those narrow-minded and
illiberal doctrines, we decline the trouble of arguing upon.
At all events we are glad for our own sakes, and for her own sake, that JENNY
LIND is to contribute to the entertainments of the season in any shape whatever;
and we can but hope that she will soon resume the place on the stage which fresh
candidates are continually coming forward to occupy.
It is true that JENNY LIND won all hearts; but the heart of the º; like
Nature itself, abhors a vacuum; and if one tenant in possession is either ejected
or chooses to withdraw, the void is speedily filled by some new occupant.

THE SECOND COLUMN OF “THE TIMES.”
THIs little Library of Modern Romance—for such the Second
Column of the Times is fairly entitled to be called—varies ex-
ceedingly in mystery as well as in interest. On some days there
is a comparative plainness in these Newspaper Novelettes, but
at other times, there is a wild obscurity, which even our saga:
city fails of fathoming. We can comprehend the invitation of
A.B. to return to C. D., or we can understand E. F. bein
willing to forgive G. H. and pass an Act of Oblivion wit
reference to everything; but there are now and then little
morsels of the mystic which we cannot attempt to penetrate.
What, for instance, can be the meaning of these extraordinary
words in the Times of last Saturday—
4 - No DOOR-MAT TO-NIGHT! ”
What possible intimation can this convey to any body? If the
words had been “No ScRAPER,” we might have caught a faint
glimpse of something or other vaguely shadowing out a possible
allusion to somebody in a scrape: but “No Door-MAT -what
on earth can that expression be intended to typify? Had the
words been “No LATCH KEY”we might have fancied a hint was
intended to be conveyed to some too-festively disposed husband,
but “No Door-MAT,” though perhaps, referring to some very
serious MAT—TER, is a piece of obscurity, that after turning on
the gas of our sagacity with all our might at the main, we
cannot illuminate. We have gone about during several hours,
muttering to ourselves “No Door-MAT To-NIGHT!” we have
turned the Mat over in our minds some hundreds of times, we
have endeavoured to knock down the door which separates
doubt from something like a glimpse of certainty; but all in vain.
“No Door-MAt To-NIGHT!” remains stereotyped in our brain,
without the smallest clue to its meaning.

State of the Quadrant.
WE fear that the late alterations must have caused a large pe-

had been as much difficulty in squaring the Quadrant's accounts,
as there would be in squaring its circle—or Circus. , Somebody
found Rome of brick and left it of marble; but somebody else—
we mean ourselves—can recollect leaving the Quadrant lamp-
posts of iron and finding them of wood-or rather we have
missed the iron columns, altogether, and find in their place
nothing but some wooden lamp-posts of the most contemptible
character. Perhaps the intention is to realise by means of these
wooden posts, something like a Wood and Forest, to be in
character with the Commissioners.

MISS BENIMBLE'S TEA-AND-TOAST.

RICAL-wallack's BRIGAND.—THE WINDSOR PLAYS.–DoGs AND
DRAMAs FROM THE FRENCH.
oop MR. Punch, there's some-
thing in the air of a Court
that does lift one up astonish-
ingly. I can't say but I felt it
• Hust a little—in Pimlico; but
here, in the very, heart and
bosom—if I may be allowed
the expression—yes, the heart
and bosom of St. James's, the
feelings seem to open like a
bed of tulips. The only thought
that clouds my soul, is the fear
of somebody taking the house,
and driving me forth an outcast
and a wanderer—perhaps into
Baker Street, perhaps into
Russell Square. Upon my
word and honour, eve *
of the knocker goes through
#Tº and through me, like a thun-
º, derbolt. But enough of this,
º let me not precipitate. •
What a beautiful effigies is

lish brick, and not ashamed of itself. Not like the skeleton things that’s
|
run up now-a-days, with plaster of Paris outsides, whitened over like a
Twelfth Cake. And falling asleep, and thinking of them bricks, I’ve
been all the week in the reign of GEORGE THE THIRD, and had QUEEN
CHARLOTTE dancing a minuet in a golden petticoat, at the bottom of
my bed, every night; and the lovely PRINCE GEORGE of WALEs, with
ruin made easy in his handsome face; and the sweet Princess, and the
King himself, with his pig-tail, that speaks the father of his people. Well
the only comfort ſhave
be at present—which, by no means, I am not—as MR. LoyELACE himself,
with a little oath like a sugar-plum, declared only last night. And this
is, after all, a comfort for folks who prefer the good old times. For if
they’d been a part of them times, they would now be a part of the
churchyard. Better to be alive—even in these dreadful days—eating
one's mutton-chop and pickled-cabbage, than to have the sheep j
lambs—(as I’ve seen 'em)-chewing their grass and clover over us,
But .* with graves and the blue devils, or, as I’m told they’re called
* high life, the azure Beelzebubs—and let me talk of LovELACE and
the news.
“That’s a beautiful sight,” said I to MR. I., last Friday as was Hſit
was his first cup of tea with me in St. James's)—“a beautiful, sight,”
meaning the QUEEN’s coach, with the QUEEN and the Prince inside, going
to the Haymarket playhouse. “A lovely sight,” said I, “when a Queen
is not only the mother of her people, but a nurse to aſ their arts. And
what’s the QUEEN and Prince going to see?” says I. -
- - “Why,” says
LovELACE, “ 'º. going to see Othello with the characters reversed.”
I must say, I didn't quite understand this; but I suppose it means the
reverse of Othello.
4. Anything new at the playhouses?” says I. Why yes, ma'am,”
says L. “There is the Brigand, for one thing.” Whereupon I begged
to defer. “The Brigandº’ says I; “why he’s as old as TURPIN or any
other highwayman.” . But . LovELACE shook his head. “Miss
BENIMBLE,” says he with a look, “it is one #. consolation to us–
poor creatures as we are—that a really fine thing never grows old.”
(What stirred within me at that minute, I can't say; but I did
catch my eye rolling round to the looking-glass.), “A fine piece of Art,
like Nature, has always life in it. Now, this is the case with MR.
WALLAck’s Brigand. Did you ever see him in that green velvet jacket?
—in those green conclusions?” I couldn't say I had. Whereupon, L.
É. his voice and his arm together, said—“Look abroad at Nature
Consider the fields, how at the breath of spring they take a fresher and
a livelier green!. How the daisies, with their innocent, baby looks,
open their precious eyes! How they come forth and, decorate the
meads!” (“Beautiful,” I thought; but I only nodded.) “And like
unto this and these,” said L., is the green jacket and the &c., of
JAMEs WALLACK's Brigand. They pass a winter in the wardrobe;
their greenness is forgotten: their buttons are veiled in darkness; an
then—fresh as the spring—they reveal their verdant beauty to the
light—or rather º: their buttons, like the silver, looks of
daisies, anew refresh us with their brightness. And it is thus, Miss
BENIMBLE,” said L., with almost a tear in his eye, “it is thus that Fine
Art is a part and parcel of Nature; ever to be fresh and ever to be
new. And thus, while grass grows, and daisies twinkle, thus will the
green jacket of WALLACK's Brigand, with all, its buttons, be freshly
green and freshly bright with every season.” “That’s all very
|t
for not living then, is to thing how oiái should' Mº has made the part his own.' ... How can an actor make a
casian honey, as LovELACE. calls it—is it, true that, he stood in the
well,” said.I.," about the jacket and so forth; but how about the
acting itself?'. Qathis, LovELACE, as, I thought, give a melancholy
smile, and said—"Do you not perceive that I spoke of the velvet as of
the part; that what I H.; in the #. &c., I meant in a figurative
sense, as of the actor himself. My dear Miss ENIMBLE, did you not
perceive this?” ... Well, being pushed home in this way, of coursei said
yes; . However, I returned to the point. “And you think it capital;”
said I. “The very finest thing possible in its possible way. Hearty and
fresh, and just sufficiently flavoured with the orange-flower of romance—
if I º sayso-to make it very taking. As a policeman, Miss BENIMBLE
—and I hold this to be a tremendous test of the beauty of the thi
-as a policeman, I could not take up WALLACK's Massaroni. I coul
not do it.” And here foveiace with his double fist, gave such a blow
to the table, that the two cups jumped clean out of the two saucers.
* Compose yourself,” says I. “And is it such a high and lofty thing?”
“”Tisn't meant to be high and lofty,” said LovELACE, “no more t
your work-box was meant to be a church-steeple. But a work-box, that
is, a beautiful work-box—a bit of really fine Tonbridge art—is, after all,
a better thing than a shocking ugly steeple. For instance, Í like the
little bit of pathos of Massaroni, a greaf deal better than cat-and-dog
.” “Why, what in the world,” says I, “is cat-and-dog
edy?”, “Why,” says LoveLACE, “I call that cat-and-dog tragedy
that’s made up of nothing but a growl and a spit.”
Seeing that L.'s mind run W. nothing but plays and players, I went
on." so,” said I, “MR. WEBSTER’s printed a book of the Windsor
Castle Plays?”, “A beautiful thing,” said LovELACE—“printed on
fifty pound Rank-note; and bound in covers of beaten gold from Cali-
fornia.” “Nonsense,” says I. “True,” says L., very serious. “True.
MR. WEESTER, as a man and a manager, knows the human heart; and
knowing how long Hamlet and the Merchant of Wenice and so forth have
been shutout of high life, thinks the best way to get ’em back to society,
is to print ’em on Bank of England fifties. The books, I understand,
are to be given away to the Aristocracy (bringing certificates of their
Shakspearean destitution)—given at the Haymarket Box-office from ten
to four. Monday is the first day of distribution. Nobody under a Baronet
is eligible for a copy.”
“Well,” said I, “a copy would be pleasant if only for the paper. But
talking of Hamlet and so orth, what do the critics mean when they say
own?” “Why,” says LovELACE, “there's two ways. The
first is, when an actor by fine sympathy vivifies the text with the spirit
of the author; and the second is this. An actor may make a part his
own, as he makes a boot his own—by putting his foot in it.”
And here, Mr. Punch, let me unburthen a sudden thought. It's
my belief, from the warmth, of LovELACE in the matter of plays and
players, it’s my belief that he's been a player himself. Qr if not a paid
layer, worse still ; he’s disgraced his family, whatever it may be, and
en an amatoor. And here, I may say, that I look upon the whole
body of Police as hoſhing more than a long tail of mystery, that will
some day be unfolded. There’s no knowing who’s in the Force... I’m
told, a hundred-and-fifty blighted clergymen; (it’s only to be ho
that the Bishop of Exeter won't lay hold on 'em :) two hundred
physicians; three-hundred-and-twenty barristers; five-hundred school.
masters; a thousand born gentlemen, whom rouge-et-noir have turned
into the blues; with eight-and-twenty unknown first tragedians. What
a work the Book of the Police would make, if the Member for Bucks
would º write it. By the way, is it true that MR. DISRAELI-when
he praised up the EMPEROR of Russia, smearing, the bear with Can-
Commons, with his coat lined with black foxes, the retaining fee
of the Emperor P And, by the way, LovELACE says, that MR. DISRAELI
is hurting himself, flashing his penknife of a hundred blades about i.
thing. “He shouldn't sting every subject,” says LovELACE; “he should
take a lesson from the rattle-snake, and economise his venom. Satire
and sarcasm,” said LovELACE, the last thing he said last night
“are capital in their way, to wither and burn up the ugly corns an
warts of the world; but they should be used with judgment and
sparingly. Now put BENAMIN in the Garden of Eden, and he’d fall
to watering the roses and lilies with nothing but vitriol and aquafortis.”
I don’t believe it; but it’s what LovELAce says, and not your humble
servant, M. B.
Questions for the next Examination of Articled Clerks.
We have been in the habit of occasionally answering the *}.
contained in the pages, of our respectable contemporary the Legal
Observer; but we }.h º a few questions to which we
shall be glad of an answer from any high legal authority:-
1. Will a J. 's Order be effectual against a Bill regularly filed, intimating that no
order can possibly be admitted?
2. Allowing that a physician has no legal title to his fees, what becomes of the title
by prescription, and does a physician's prescription give him no title at all?
3. There having been some doubts as to what constitutes a good endorsement of a
Common Conveyance, what do you think of the number on the back of an omnibus
or a cab?
4. If a Testator leave his property away from his own relatives, is it a good disposi-
tion of the estate, or does it show a bad disposition on the part of the Testator ºf

THE FINE ARTS AT HYDE PARK CORNER.
THE western entrance to London has never been thought very imposing
—particularly since the removal of the Turnpike where a toll used to be
imposed—but the public are much indebted to the occupant of the
Lodge, wh9, by mixing up classics with curds and whey, milk from the
cow with Models from the Antique, succeeds in giving to Hyde Park
Corner an air that smacks somewhat of the glories of art. We have
frequently been struck by the humble small salad growing in the grandeur
of an Etruscan vase; and we have watched in summer the aspiring bean
of France * its way to elevation by clambering up the stone column
of Corinth. . We have marked “the ivy green” .# fondly to the
“marble white,” and we have felt an inward conviction that these lowly
E.; contained a genius superior to those baskets of biscuits, and
wls of lacteal beverage, which are the most ostensible objects of the is
humble abode.

accounts for the classical emblems that i.
at Hyde Park Corner-converting its small inclosure into a sort of Bo-
boli êº and making the b
somewhat diminutive scale. -
We think it may be well worth the consideration of the Commissioners
of Woods and Forests, whether it might not be expedient to permit the
Hyde Park Corner Artist to extend his decorative skill a little further
than his father's patch of garden, and perhaps achieve a result that would = ==
be worthy of the entrance to the great metropolis.
To SPIRITED YOUNG NOBLEMEN.—Any “Younger Member of the
Aristocracy” who is panting for Glory, or handsome Pay, has a glorious oppor-
tunity of serving himself and his Country, by enlisting in that fine Railway Corps,
which is now actively engaged in the East Lancashire War, lately carried on with such
imperishable renown by those dauntless young fellows, whose pride it is to be called
“HER MAJESTY's NAvvies” of Clifton.
Those dashing young sprigs of the Nobility, whose Relations cannot find them an
opening in the Admiralty or the Horse Guards, will be delighted with this Service, in
which the promotion promises to be very rapid, and the danger, comparatively, nothing.
A most fashionable and stylish uniform, quite equal to Prince Albert's Own, is being
designed by a noble Colonel who has had long practice in the Shears-and-Goose line.
The title of this elegant new Corps will be
“The First Lancashire Buffers.”

Smasher, near the scene of action. N.B. No GREYs or ELLIoTTs need apply.

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
The INFLUENCE OF LOWELY WOMAN UPON SOCIETY.
TºonsTANTLY, my dear Bob,
h I have told you how
refining is the influ-
ence of women upon
society, and how pro-
found our respect
ought to be for them.
Living in chambers
as you do, my dear
Nephew, and not of
course liable to be
amused by the con-
stant society of an old
Uncle, who moreover
might be deucedly
§ bored with your own
§ conversation—I be-
seech and implore you
to make a point of
being intimate with
one or two families
where you can see kind and well-bred English ladies. I have seen
women of all nations in the world, but I never saw the equals of
English women (meaning of course to include our cousins the MAC
WHIRTERs of Glasgow, and the O’Tooles of Cork); and I pray
sincerely, my boy, that you may always have a woman for a friend.
Try, then and make yourself the bientenu in some house where
accomplished and amiable ladies are. Pass as much of your time as you
can with them. Lose no opportunity of making yourself agreeable to
them, run their errands; send them flowers and elegant little tokens;
show a willingness to be pleased by their attentions, and to aid their
little charming schemes of shopping, or dancing, or this, or that. Isay
to you, make yourself a lady's man as much as ever you can. .
t is better for you to pass an evening once or twice a week in a lady's
drawing-room, even though the conversation is rather slow and you
know the girls’ º heart, than in a club, tavern, or smoking-room,
or pit of a theatre. - - -
are not admitted, are, rely, on it, deleterious in their nature., All men
who avoid female society, have dull perceptions and are stupid, or have
gross tastes and revolt against what is pure. Your Club-swaggerers who
are sucking the butts of billiard-queues all night call female society in-
sipid. Sir, poetry is insipid to a yokel: beauty has no charms for a
lind man: music does not please an unfortunate brute who does not
know one tune from another—and, as a true epicure is hardly ever tired of
water-souchy and brown bread and butter, I protest I can sit for a whole
night talking to a well-regulated kindly woman about her girl coming
out, or her boy at Eton, and like the evening's entertainment.
Öne of the great benefits a young man may derive from women's society
is, that he is bound to be respectful to them. The habit is of great good
to your moral man, depend on it; , Our education makes of us the most
eminently selfish men in the world. We fight for ourselves, we push for
ourselves: we cut the best slices out of the joint at club-dinners for our-
selves, we yawn for ourselves and light our pipes, and say we won’t go
out: we prefer ourselves and our ease—and the greatest good that comes
to a man from woman's society is, that he has to t of somebody
besides himself-somebody to whom he is bound to be constantly atten-
tive and respectful. Certainly I don’t want my dear Bob to associate with
those of the other sex whom he doesn't and can't respect: that is worse
than billiards; worse than tavern brandy-and-water: worse than smoking
selfishness at home. But I vow I would rather see you turning over the
leaves of Miss FIDDLEcoMBE's music-book all night than at billiards, or
smoking, or brandy-and-water, or all three.
Remember, if a house is pleasant, and you like to remain in it,
that to be well with the women of the house is the great, the vital point.
If it, is a good house, don't turn up your nose because you are only
asked to come in the evening while others are invited to dine. Recollect
the debts of dinners which an hospitable family has to pay; who are
you that you should always be expecting to nestle under iſ: mahogany?
Agreeable acquaintances are made just as well in the drawing-room as
in the dining-room. Go to tea brisk and -humoured. Be determined
to be pleased; Talk to a dowager....Take a hand at whist. If you are
musical, and know a song, sing it like a man. Never sulk about danc-
ing, but off with you. You will find your acquaintance enlarge.
Mothers, pleased with your good humour, will probably ask you to
Pocklington Square, to a little party. .You will get on—you will form
yourself a circle. You may marry a rich ń. or, at any rate, get the
chance of seeing a number of the kind, and the pretty.
Many young men, who are more remarkable for their impudence and
amusements of youth, to which virtuous women |*8
selfishness than their good sense, are fond of boastfully announcing that
they decline going to evening parties at all, unless, indeed, such enter-
tainments commence with a good dinner, and a quantity of claret.
I never saw my beautiful-minded friend, MRs. Y. Z, many times out
of temper, but can quite pardon her indignation, when young FRED,
NooDLE, to whom the Y. Z.'s have been very kind, and who has appeared
scores of times at their elegant table in Üor Bºk-r Street, announced,
in an unlucky moment of flippancy, that he did not intend to go to
evening parties any more.
What induced FRED. NooDLE to utter this bravado I know not:
whether it was that he has been puffed up by attentions from several
Aldermen's families, with whom he has of late become acquainted, and
among whom he gives himself the airs of a prodigious “swell;” but
having made this speech one Sunday after Church, when he condescended
to .# in B-k-r Street, and show off his new gloves and waistcoat, and
talked in a sufficiently dandified air about the opera (the wretched
creature fancies that an º it ticket gives him the
privileges of a man of fashion)—NooDLE ehis bow to the ladies, and
strutted off to show his new yellow kids elsewhere.
“MATILDA, my love, bring the Address Book,” MRs. Y. Z. said to
her lovely eldest daughter, as soon as NooDLE was §. and the
banging hall-door had closed upon the absurd youth. That graceful
and obedient girl rose; went to the back drawing-room, on a table in
which apartment the volume lay, and brought the book to her mamma.
MRs. Y. Z. turned to the letter N: and under that initial discovered
the name of the young fellow who had just gone out. NooDLE, F,
250, Jermyn Street, St. James's. She took a pen from the table before
her, and with it deliberately crossed the name of MR. NoonLE out of
her book. MATILDA looked at ELIZA, who stood, by in silent awe.
The sweet eldest girl, who has a kind feeling towards every soul alive,
then looked towards her mother, with expostulating eyes, and said,
“O mamma!” Dear, dear ELIZA' I love all pitiful hearts like thine.
But MRs. Y. Z. was in no mood to be merciful, and gave way to a
natural indignation and feeling of outraged justice. -
“What, business has that young man to tell, me,” she exclaimed,
“that he declines going to evening parties, when he knows that after
Easter we have one or twof Has he not met with constant hospitalit
here since MR. Y. Z., brought him home from the Club F. Has he suc
beaur yeur? or, has he so much wit? or, is he a man of so much note,
that his company at a dinner-table becomes indispensable. He is
nobody; he is not handsome; he is not clever; he never opens his
mouth, except to drink d". Papa's claret; and he declines evening
parties forsooth !—Mind, children, he is never invited into this house
gain.”
When Y, Z. now meets young NooDLE at the Club, that kind, but
feeble-minded old gentleman covers up his face with the newspaper, so
as not to be seen º NooDLE; or sidles away with his face to the book-
cases, and lurks off by the door. The other day, they met on the steps,
when the wretched NooDLE, driven aur abois, actually the mean-
ness to ask how MRs. Y. Z. was: The Colonel (for such he is, and of
the Bombay service, too,) said—“My wife?, Q —hum—I’m sorry to
say MRs. Y. Z. has been very poorly indeed, lately, very poorly; and
confined to her room. God bless my soul! I’ve an appointment at the
India House, and it’s past two o'clock”—and he fled.
I had the malicious satisfaction of describing to NooDLE the most
sumptuous dinner which Y. Z. had given the day before, at which there
was a Lord present, a Foreign Minister, with his Orders, two Generals
with stars; and every luxury of the season; but at the end of our
conversation, seeing the effect it had upon the poor youth, and how
miserably he was cast down, I told him the truth, viz., that the above
story was a hoax, and that if he wanted to get into MRs. Y. Z.'s good
s again, his best plan was to go to LADy Fº: where I
fº. the Miss Y. Z.'s would be, and dance with them all night.
Yes, my dear Bob, you boys must pay with your persons, however
lazy you may be—however much inclined to smoke at the Club, or to
lie there and read the last delicious new novel; or averse to going home
to a dreadful black set of chambers, where there is no fire; and at ten
9'clock at night creeping shuddering into your ball suit, in order to go
forth to an eve party. - -
The dressing, the clean gloves, and cab-hire, are nuisances, I grant
you. The idea of the party itself is a bore, but you must go. len
you are at the party, it is not so stupid; there is always something
leasant for the eye and attention of an observant man. There is a
ustling Dowager wheedling and manoeuvring to get proper partners for
her girls; there is a pretty girl enjoying herself with all her heart, and
in .."the pride of her beauty, than which, I know no more charming
object;-there is poor Miss MEGGOT, lonely up against the wall, whom
nobody asks to dance, and with whom it is your bounden duty to waltz.
There is always something to see or do, when you are there: and to
evening parties, I say, you must go. -
Perhaps I speak with the ease of an old fellow who is out of the
business, and É.i. you from afar off. My dear boy, they don't want
us at evening parties. A stout, bald-headed man dancing, is a melan-
choly object to himself in the looking-glass opposite, and there aro
duties and pleasures of all ages. Once, Heaven help us, and only once,
WOL. xWI.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
upon my honour, and I say so as agentleman, some boys seized upon me
and carried me to the Casino, where, forthwith, they found acquaintances
and partners, and went whirling away in the double-timed waltz (it is
an abominable dance to me ºf am an old fogy) along with hundreds
more. I caught sight of a face in the crowd—the most blank, melan-
choly, and dreary, old visage it was—my own face in the glass—there
was no use in my being there. Canities adest morosa-no, not morosa-
but, in fine, I had no business in the place, and so came away.
I saw enough of that Casino, however, to show to me that—but my
paper is full, and on the subject of women I have more things to say,
which might fill many hundred more pages.
THE REAL COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
WITHout wishing to dispute the merits of GENERAL SIR CHARLEs
NAFTER, or to deny the sound judgment of the nation in looking to him
as the man for the situation in India, we cannot help perceiving that
the country invariably looks to Punch in the event of any difficulty at
home, with the confident assurance that Punch is sure to make himself
the master of the emergency.
Whenever the Parliamentary campaign seems to threaten disastrous
results, or to wear an unpromising aspect, his Super-Excellency the
General (Favourite) Punch, of the Public's Own Regulars, is immediately
despatched to the scene of action—or rather, the scene of inaction—for
the purpose of setting matters to rights. His Super-Excellency, is
always, ready at a moment’s notice; for he requires nothing but his
bâtºn in hand, the possession of which fits him at once to grapple
with and overcome every kind of difficulty that may occur. No sooner
does he make his appearance in the field, than the Heavy Protectionist
leaden batteries are silenced, and the old files of the 2nd Infantry—so
called from their having got into their second childhood—retire at once
or lay down their arms.
It is a great misfortune that General Punch, like GENERAL SIR
CHARLEs NAFTER, is not applied to in an early stage of the campaign;
but is only called upon when his services are actually indispensable to
prevent further calamity. Having been now invested by universal con-
sent with the Chief-Command, his earliest care will be to prevent the
repetition of such disasters as the evacuation of the House by the
counting out process, contingent on a speech from MR.ANSTEY; and
he will also use his utmost exertion to prevent the terrible loss of life
that is occasioned to the various Bills which are often brought, by cruel
mutilation and other barbarous practices, to an untimely end.
CONNAUGHT UNDER THE HAMMER.
MR. PUNCH has received instructions from SIB Robert PEEL to
sell by Auction, to the best Bidder, at his Rooms in Fleet Street, all
that remarkably Desirable and highly Eligible PRovince called Cox-
NAUGHT, situate in that portion of HER MAJESTY's dominions called
IRELAND, and comprising an immense tract of UNRECLAIMED AcREs,
which will abundantly repay cultivation. -
The proprietorship of this land has hitherto been vested in the hands
of gentlemen who have unfortunately been unable to manage their own
affairs, and have, in consequence, wed them to get into confusion
and ChancERY: under the auspices of which Court the resources of
the soil have reached, and never got beyond, their present state of
development. The º: to conveyance, will be cleared
of mortgages, jointures, an other encumbrances, including a con-
siderable number of the biped live-stock, which will be disposed of by
emigration.
The territory abounds in a starving, ignorant, and lazy population;
starving, because, ignorant and lazy; and hence affording a º
scope for the educational operations of the philanthropist. The
purchase will form an excellent investment to any gentleman pos
of moderate capital and common º: ; of neither of which ad-
vantages the land has hitherto had the benefit. To the enterprising
patriot, if such a person can be found,) who would desire to make
several blades of corn grow where nothing but a bad potato 5.
before, the opportunity of buying an estate in Connaught is a golden
one, which ought not to be missed For particulars apply to SIR
Robert PEEL, at his residence in Town, or at Tamworth, or to Mr.
Punch, at his office, 85, Fleet Street.
TEA AND TURN OUT.
THE Papers inform us that the Commissioners of Customs are about
to throw upwards of 20,000 lbs. of Tea into the Thames. We hope the
public will be apprised of the exact day and hour, for all London º
then indulge in a gratuitous cup of Tea, inasmuch as if a º
make a fair average “dish” for one individual, the 20,000 lbs. of Tea
will furnish astrong breakfast cup at least of the deligious beverage to
every, inhabitant of the Metropolis. We think the Londoners might
each have the privilege of inviting one friend from the country to a cup
of Tea, which is about to be made in such liberal quantities by the
Custom House Authorities.
We have not heard what is the quality of the Tea—whetherit is our
old friend the roughish:flavoured Black, or the delicate Assam, or the
strong Family Pekoe; but we certainly advise everybody to take his
muffinto the banks of the river on the tea-making day, and dipping his
cup into the Thamesian tide, form one at the great Metropolitan ca-
Party which is about to be given. -
e have heard that the Ordnance Office has been applied to for a few
chests of Gunpowder, to mix with the ordinary Tea, and some genuine
new milk” is already in the course of manufacture at the chalk-pits on
this side of Gravesend, for the purpose of giving the usual on.
lacteal flavour to the compound.
THE MONSTER PICTURES.
. The walls of the Metropolis are at present adorned by some seven or
eight miles of Bill-sticking, with reference to the three and four miles
of American Painting of the Mississippi. We have received a letter
from MR., or, rather, PRofessor Risley, whose Professorship, by the
way, has been assumed by virtue of his power of twisting hi and
his sons into all sorts of knots—an odd method of exemplifying the ties
of relationship, we have, we say, received a letter from Professor
Risley, denying that his Panorama is "a copy of BANvARD’s.”.
We never styled it a copy, though we characterised the idea of
measuring a Painting by miles, and laying the utmost stress upon its
length, as a plagiarism from the individual who has preceded the soi-
disant Professor in the American River Exhibition line. We do not
think the º favour is to be obtained very legitimately when the
mileage of a picture is its most prominent feature, and where rivalry is
conducted on the principle of seeing which of the two competitors can
*wº. the greatest lengths.
We are disposed to allow the º rietors of Exhibitions in these days
a good deal of latitude, but wet §§ the American rivals are claiming a
little too much longitude in estimating the size of their Paintings.
PRESERVED IIonour.
THE Piedmontese soldiers ran away; whereupon a bulletin declares
that “the army has been beaten, but has preserved its honour.” Thus,
honour may be like gherkins; best preserved whenin a precious pickle.

TO GOVERNESSES AND COMPANIONS.
X. Y. Z. (in the Times) thus calls for various instruction and cheerful
companionship, at the rate of £30 per annum :—
Goº: and COMPANION WANTED, by a lady, residing in a
retired part of the country. She must not be under 25 years of age, but may be
either Catholic or of the Established Church. Must be of a cheerful temperament, able
to give a sound English education, teach Latin, speak French fluently, and give the
first lessons in drawing. It is indispensable that she be a good pianiste, and able to sing
well. Any lady wishing a quiet home, with most kind and considerate treatment, rather
than mere emolument, will find this situation desirable. £30 per annum will be given.
Address, with real name, and as much explicitness as possible, to X. Y. Z., Isle of Wight.
Punch has been favoured with the subjoined tº: in reply to
the above—an application that, it is to be hoped, will meet with the
serious attention of X. Y. Z.
“MADAM, In answer to your advertisement, throbbing as it does
with the most benevolent emotions, permit me as explicitly as possible
to lay before F. the claims, I fondly hope, I possess, to the goodness
and bounty of your patronage. Fortunately, I am not under twenty-
five, this being my twenty-fifth birth-day. I hold this circumstance to
be a most happy omen; as last week, or even yesterday, I could scarcely
have dared to solicit the felicity of your attention.
“I can also avail myself of your liberality, feeling that I may con:
tinue to be a Catholic, and nevertheless hope for the benevolence of
your regards. My temperament is, I am told, cheerful; but if not
found sufficiently so, it shall be my study to elevate it even to a point
of hilarity, such exertion on my part being liberally considered in the
£30 per annum wages. -
“With respect to a sound English education :- ask, do you
require a perfect knowledge of the whole range of English Literature, -
or may a tolerable acquaintance with some two or three thousand
Authors suffice?
“With regard to Latin, am I required to have even PERSIUs at my
fingers’ ends, or will a pretty fair knowledge of the body of the
Fathers be enough? Are the little boys I am to instruct to be brought
P to the Church,-or the little girls to be educated in the lively hope
of becoming the wives of Bishops?
“As to French, must my accent be only a little less pure than
RACHEL's, and my drawing not quite so beautiful as the MARCHIONEss
of WATERFORD's ... .
“For Piano and Singing, must I conquer THAIBERG at sight, and
give The Bright Seraphin with all the voice and purity of JENNY LINDP
“I feel that a ‘quiet home,” and more than all, “kind and considerate
treatment, RATHER than mere emolument,” is reward sufficient for any or
all the graces, and accomplishments you require. Thirty, pounds per
annum you will concede is not an extravagant salary—(possibly you give
your footman £40)—but then, if the wages be low, no doubt the bene-
volence of your emotions will be at the highest pitch. And, after all,
how beautiful is the soul of kindness (as manifested in your offer) to the
‘mere emolument’, that comes with money!, Mere wages may be
reckoned and counted; now, benevolence such as yours, is evidently
beyond all calculation.
‘Herewith, gracious Madam, I send my address. For further par-
ticulars apply to Mr. Punch, a gentleman who has on all occasions shown
himself anxious to watch over the interests and assert the rights of
those unhappy “Governesses and Companions, who too frequently
receive at the hands of their own sex the worst bitterness that mingles
in their cup of life. Try, good Madam, and hereafter make the draught
a little more palatable.”
A New Proverb.
THE papers state that a further clearance is to take §: at Stowe,
where a quantity of timber is about to be cut, so that Stowe may fairly
furnish us with a proverb corresponding to the lucus a non lucendo, for
it seems to be Stoſwe, a non stando, since nothing is, allowed to stand.
This cutting down of timber is suggestive of one of those “wise saws”
of which the “modern instances” are rare.
THE UPS AND, DOWNS OF LONDON.
WoRKMEN have, it is said, commenced lowering the brow of Holborn
Hill. We should be very glad to see some of these awkward high;
brows of the metropolis completely shaved off. This arrangement will
prevent the necessity for vehicles going down the incline much faster
than they were inclined to go.
N IRON CROWN.—To be disposed of (a Bargain), almost as good as
new, bating that it is a little tarnished, an IRon Crown that has been worn for a
very few years, and is now disposed of no longer fitting its late owner. Any Ex-King,
disappointed of a diadem of the aforesaid metal, will find the Iron Crown in question a
, stout, serviceable article.—Apply at the Railway Station, York. On the receipt
of a sufficient number of postage stamps to pay carriage, the Iron Crown will be for-
warded for inspection, either to Mrvarr's, or the Star and Garter, Richmond.

- . . . Mr. Pips
Thursday, March 29th, 1849. To see the Nobility and Gentry, and
other great. Company, go to the QUEEN's Drawing-Room, with a
ºriend to St. James's Street, where did stand in Front of BooDLE's
| Club-House in the Rain, which was heavy, and spoiled my Paris Hat,
cost me Twelve Shillings. But the Sight of the Show was almost
worth the Damage; for the red and blue Uniforms of the Army and
Navy Officers with their Orders on their Breasts, and their Cocked
| Hats and Plumes in their Laps, and the Ladies of Quality in their
| Silks and Satins of all manner of Colours, and their Hair crowned with
Qstrich Feathers, and sparkling with Pearls and Diamonds, did much
delight me to behold. F. not remember that when I was a Boy, I
was ever more taken with a Pageant at Bartholomew, Fair. Though
I wish I could have had as good a View of the Gentlefolks within the
Carriages as I had of the Lackeys outside, who, with their supercilious
Airs, and their Jackamapes Garb, did divert me more than ever. I do
continually marvel at the enormous Calves, of those Warlets, for which
One º: almost think they were reared, like a sort of Cattle. Indeed,
I should have believed that their Stockings were padded, if I had not
seen one of them wince when a Horse chanced to lay hold of his Leg.

It did more and more amaze me to observe, how high they carried
their Noses, especially as most of them had Posies in their Bosoms;
whereas, they looked as though, instead, there were some unsavoury
Odour beneath their Nostrils. But much as the Servants re.
sembled Zanies, and Harlequins, yet did some of their, Masters
look not much better; being dressed in a Court Suit, which me-
thinks do make a Gentleman seem a sort of embroidered Quaker
—I do greatly wonder why the ugliest Apparel of any Period in English
History should be pitched upon for the Court Dress. But the splendid
Carriages painted with Coats of Arms, and the stately caparisoned
Horses, did make a rare Show; and among them what Sport to mark
the Hack Cabs that were not suffered to enter at the Palace Gate;
so the Fares had to alight and walk on Foot the rest of the Way to the
Drawing Room: and so into the Presence of HER MAJESTY in dirty
Boots: which, now Ibethink me, was not seemly; the rather as man
of them are Half Pay Officers, and other poor but loyal Subjects, who .#
afford no better than a Cab. But good lack it did most tickle me to view

look upon, and I believe t
see the little rascal Boys shout and clap their Hands as it went by. Also
it did give me extreme Amusement to notice the gimcrack Equipages
and bearded Visages, and Playhouse. Attire of the different Forei
Ambassadors; of whom I think the Turkish was the most grand. It
did make me laugh not a little to see the Police with their Truncheons,
keeping order among the Vagabonds, till one did tell me to move on,
which did vex me. Then there were the Guards, in full Uniform on
Horseback, with their Helmets on their Heads and their Swords drawn,
about one under each º, Post, mounting Guard, very, warlike to
is is the heaviest Part of their Duty.
! What with the blazing Uniforms and glittering Jewels, and illuminated
the Army and Navy Estimates are disposed of, a
Coaches, and the Laughter I was moved to º motley Footmen and
Foreigners, my Eyes were dazzled and my Head did somewhat ache;
moreover, some. y Faces. I did gaze upon did put my Heart in a
Flutter, which did not think fit to mention to my Wife. Methinks how
fine it would be to ride in State to Court, if it were not so chargeable,
and I should much. º in the Honour and Glory of the Thing, but
should not at all like the Expense. A Drawing Room doth altogether
eclipse the LORD MAYOR's Show; although it do seem but a Toy and
ilt Gingerbread Affair, and an empty, childish Display, like the Babies'
ame Q i and Queen; but then it hath certainly this Advantage,
that it do much good to Trade.
WE WANT YOUR MONEY, NOT YOUR ADVICE.
Rom some cause or the other, it seems
that civilians are not qualified to give
any opinion upon military matters. If
this }. true, let all but military mem
be excluded from the House whenever
it; or else make your Commons all sol-
diers, so that they shall all be qualified;
or, better still, let all ºlº.
be transferred to Chelsea Hospital,
where, as everyman has been a soldier,
the Army Estimates will naturally be
discussed by the best qualified set of
men in England. It strikes us, however,
that when you pay for a thing, you have
a perfect right to complain if you think
you are being overcharged; but, ac-
cording to the military argument, the
tailor would answer, “Really, sir, you
must give me, what I ask, for this
coat; it is only £20, and it is very
º you can know nothing about the matter, for you, sir, are not
a tailor.”
The above canon would cause arevolution in our legislature. We should
require a differently composed House for every measure that touched
upon a separate interest. Thus, we should want a House of Farmers
for Agricultural questions, a House of Sailors for Nºg questions, a
House of Tea-dealers, Drysalters, Bakers, Butchers, Silk Mercers,
Furriers, Calico Printers, Guano Merchants, for every one of those
distinct branches of trade. We should be ha as many riouses as
there were businesses in the Directory; whereas we perfectly know that
One º of Commons is quite as much as the nation can patiently put
up with. -
One thing is very clear, that if a man is only competent to give
advice upon matters connected with his own calling, then military men
should never speak or vote excepting upon military subjects; so after
Majors, Colonels
(SIBTHORFE included), Admirals, &c., had better retire, and make room
for men who are better qualified, from larger experience, to judge upon
| general subjects.
Gross Libel.
MEssRs. WIGRAM AND GREEN, the eminent shipbuilders, have been
shamefully accused of taking the lines of a Government ship as a model
for all their ships. , Now this accusation, like many of the Dockyard
vessels, would not hold water for a minute, and a contradiction was
publicly given to it immediately by MR. S. HERBERT. But it is really
too bad to libel a respectable firm in this scandalous way; and we candidly
think if MessRs.WIGRAMAND GREEN were to bring an action for defama.
tion of character against Ministers, they would recover the largest
damages; for it is very evident that no passenger would think of
tº: life or his baggage in one of their ships, if he thought it
was no better than a Government vessel. We hope the report has done
them no injury in the commercial world, or been the cause of LLoyd's
** ships off the list of A 1, and refusing to insure them at
any rate.
THE GRETNA GREEN BLACKSMITH DEFYETH LORD
CAMPBELL.
I CANNA eat my meal o' meat,
Nor drink my whisky dram: |
a military question is brought before
Still in my eye the drap ye’ll spy,
Howe'er my tears, Idam. -
Wi’ his Marriage Bill my trade to kill,
Could-blooded CAMPBELL plans;
For better and worse he has my curse,
And wha’ll forbid the bans?
Nae mair to my door the yellows and four
Must dash as they used to do;
Wi’ lads whose first order, on crossing the Border,
Was “Supper and on for two l’”
Nae heiress may fling hersel i' the ring
o cross her freens o'er-cautious,
Wi’a lad, worth nae plack, past the claes on his back,
d, aiblins, a wheen mustachios.
When Iwad sleep my flesh gaes creep,
oft awful tº: º: railway da
o' post-chays, whom railway days
Lang syne hae doomed to dee:
Whence lang ladghaists lift by their waists,
Sweet lass ghaists to the groun';
And ; ghaist maids ghaist flunkey blades
Haud frae the rumbledoon.
For me they send, the parson kenned
By a' in Gretna Green;
Their hands to join as sin’ lang syne,
º: auld custom's been.
But as I clasp their ghaistly grasp,
Doon, wi an eldritch laugh,
Skelps on its fires alang the wires,
That gruesome Telegraph 1 |
And gies a shock that gars me knock -
The buik from oot my han’— |
The ghaists are gane—I wake my lane,
A meeserable man!
But my bellows I'll blaw, spite o'ghaist or law,
And, like a kindly Scot,
Whether weddings to do, or horse's shoe,
Strike while the iron’s hot.
And come what will o' CAMPBELL’s Bill,
* wark I’ll never rue: -
The links I’ve made, in Hymen's trade,
Were heart and º too !
There's ABERDEEN, a trusty freen,
Will stand by me and mine,
And a vote I’ll owe to each penniless Joe,
That’s in the heiress line.
So I’ll ne'er be fleyed from my fourfold trade,
Host, n, blacksmith, barber;
Still ye’ll find, if ye drop intil my shop,
A Bridal Tidal Harbour.
A PARLIAMENTARY NOSEGAY,
Made of Mr. Drummond's Choice Flowers of Speech.
THE following little Nosegay is composed of choice Flowers of
Speech and Samples, which we have gathered from MR. DRUMMOND's
Speech on the Army Estimates:—
“HER MAJESTY's Ministers were doubtlessly discussing the measure over a cool
bottle;—Country boobies;-Just in proportion as the merchants and manufacturers
were cowards the one minute, they were bullies the other;-A set of meddling fools;–
They were all equally stupid;—The Manchester gentlemen had given proof of their
utter incompetence;—Not a man in the country stood convicted of being so utterly
unable to give an accurate opinion of the state of Europe as the Honourable Member
for the West Riding;-Talk of our friendly neighbours, go to the Zoological Gardens,
see the tigers quiet in their lairs, watch the antics of the monkeys, all very peaceable
and harmless animals, but only let them be set loose, and you will soon find what altered
tigers and monkeys they will become,” &c. &c.
of Protectionist
Tie these Choice Flowers up with a running st
“cheers,” trim the loose ends with a good cutting “laugh,” and you
have a nice little bouquet de Drummond, full of the most exquisite
Parliamentary sense.
THE LETTER OF THE LAw.—It has been proposed that the Insolvent
Members should be distinguished from their brother legislators, by

DRURY: LANE TO LET.-CRUEL TEMPTATION.
We have always, fell kindly disposed towards M. Julien. His beaming face, and white
waistcoat have somehow impressed us with a strong sense of the humanity and purity of his motives.
Sorry, indeed, are we to find such Fº opinions oozing from us; but what—we ask it—what are
we to think of the philanthropy of a man who, by public advertisement for the letting of Drury
Lane Theatre, says, he “will give the preference to a tenant taking the Theatre for the representation
of the Legitimate Drama?” The Theatre, says the wily Julien, lessee, “may be had for the
months o º: May, June, July, and August, viz., during the height of the London, season, a
period most advantageous for theatrical speculation.” As f plays and players were like plums
and peaches, and flourished all the better in a blazing summer. #. on reconsideration, we suspect
that herein M jºines only indulges an irrepressible raillery; although it is a little too bad in
a Frenchman, and therefore a natural born enemy, to fleer and flout at the condition of the English
Legitimate Drama. With his soulfull of the glories of his Concerts and his Masked Balls—with
his heart bounding to MDLLE. MATHILDE's bounding horse, and jumping to the vaulters—M.
JULLIEN knows that the Legitimate Drama has no longer a chance in }. Lane. Therefore it
would have been more ingenuous of M. Juillen —more in accordance with his reputed courtesy
and benevolence—to have offered Drury Lane for the exhibition of the Sea Serpent, when caught,
or for the distribution of the funds in liquidation of Spanish Bonds, when paid. Nevertheless
M. Juillen, in the full enjoyment of his sarcasm, offers to accept from “any gentleman engaging
in such an undertaking,” namely, in the representation of the Legitimate Drama,” a rental “at the
rate of £1500 per annum less than that now paid by the present tenant.” There is cruel irony in
all this. M. Julien should rather offer the Theatre rent-free, with an added premium to “any
gentleman engaging to exhibit a team of unicorns, with half-a-dozen specimens, in feather and in
ash, of the bird phoenix.”
Symptoms of University Reform.
The intelligence from Cambridge informs us that the JAcksonIAN Professor intends commencing
a Course of tures on the 24th of April next. We are not aware of the object of the
JAcksonIAN Professorship, but as the name of Jackson is connected in the public mind with the
science of pugilism, we presume the Professor contemplates a Course of Lectures on the noble
Art of Self-Defence.
The next article of the University Intelligence is that “the Plumian Professor will commence
a Course of Lectures on the 23rd of the same month.” It has been suggested to us that the
Plumian is short for the Plumby one, or Plum'y ºn, and that the Professor contem lates a
Course of Lectures on British Slang, which we ºknow is more closely allied to classical learning
than might at first sight be considered probable.
THE CHURCH MOUSE's PETITION.
OH! hear a reverend captive's prayer,
In durance vile that lies,
Nor let a Bishop's heart be shut
Against a i. cries,
For here, my Lord, immured Isit,
Behind this prison grate,
Cast at thy suit in costs, whose sum
Exceeds my small estate.
If e'er thy breast has horror felt
Of bigot's stake or chain,
Let not thy persecuting ire
Seceding Shorts detain.
Oh! do not yet more deeply stain
Thy somewhat dingy lawn, .
Nor triumph that so poor a prize!
Within thy toils is drawn.
The free donations of my flock
My scanty means supply
And why should thine intolerant heart
My pulpit's use deny?
The cushioned desk and sounding-board
Were made for all and each;
Let every clergyman enjoy
The common right to preach.
The well-taught theologian’s mind
Man's conscience will respect;
Regard all creeds with liberal eye,
And hope for every sect.
Should e'er the times, as some forebode,
Of faggot and of flame
Return, and Smithfield, as of yore,
Its mitred victims claim;
Beware, my Bishop, lest, in turn,
Thou feel the zealot's rage;
And, being roasted, call to mind
ShoBE in his dungeon-cage'
Or, though thou too the martyr's fate
May'st not be doom'd to share,
For once let Pity bid thy heart
A prostrate victim spare.
So, in thine ever stormy See,
May peace at length be found;
And harmony and concord dwell
Where strife and wrath abound.
So may’st thou never go to law,
Thyself the cost to bear;
Thus in thine own hot water boiled,
And caught in thine own snare.
A SECOND WATERLOO.
“F.M. the Duke has determined to institute a test of
education for Officers, previous to their obtaining Com-
missions in the Army.”—F. MAULE, in the House of
Commons,
This is a most ungracious reflection upon
the present race of Officers. If those already
admitted do not instantly go up and pass their
examinations, they will be continually exposed
to the sneer that their younger comrades are
more educated than they. This "º.
riority will be very unpleasant. The junior
iº, of our Army will be above the senior-
the Ensigns will be jumping over the Colonels.
In fact, there will be two distinct Services at
every mess-table. There will be the Educatºp
SERVICE, composed of young Officers, admit-
ted since the above regulation, and the UN-
epuçATED SERVICE, consisting of old Officers,
admitted before it. No gentleman will sit
easy under this comparison. We are sure
not a single officer, even in our Ho
Regiments, will be afraid to face these exa-
minations. It is F. M. the Duke who gives
the cry, “Up, GuARDs, AND At 'EM.”

AN INAUDIBLE DEBATE IN THE HOUSE

*in

for hearing.”—Times.
ETITIONs in great numbers were pre-

we could not possibly hear. Judging
from their size, they seemed to con-
tain a great deal.

mained on his legs precisely three

Tº ourselves the great responsibility

LoRD BROUGHAM explained in
dumb, show. He was apparently
speaking with his fingers, and used
both his hands with the greatest
effect, seemingly in beating down
the statements of the hon. Lord;
but at the end of his Speech, which
we can only regret was not spoken,
that, upon raising his dexter thumb

significantly, it brought, . - - - - -
oRD CAMPBELL on his legs again. He swept away the insinuations
of the hon. Lord, who had just spoken with his fingers, most completely
with his left hand, and then ran his right cursorily through his hair.
This evidently made the ex-Chancellor very uneasy, but, strange to say
elicited no reply from him. Upon this, LoRD CAMPBELL cruelly resume
the shake º #: head, and shook it with such effect, that LoRD
BRough AM lost all self-possession, and b shaking his also. This
continued for several minutes, during which the House (and business
also) was in a state of the utmost suspense, when, at last,
LoRD BRqugh AM jumped up with great excitement, and said—but
what he said still remains a mystery. We are charitably inclined to
believe that the hon. Lord was at a loss to find words to express his
isºl for not a single one did we hear fall from his Lordship's
lips. On this occasion he spoke, not only with his . but with É.
feet, for he stamped upon the ground, and, if we are allowed to consider
the dust which his Lordship raised on all sides of him as any evidence
of his powerful speech, we are perfectly justified in affirming that he

especially.
oRD STANLEY replied, but his eloquence, generally so loud, so
impassioned, found for once no echo in the House. Finding he had
nothing to say worth hearing, he sat down after an hour's most painful
silence, and resumed his seat, evidently much upset, and without a
single cheer.
Several Lords rose, and beckoned to one another across the House,
but nothing resulting from the motion, they all sat down again.
A Deputation from the Commons appeared at the Bar . the House,
and brought with them several large bundles of paper.
The Chancellor rose.
The Commons bowed.
The Chancellor bowed, and d his wig.
The Qommons and the Chancellor stared at one another most leisurely
for half an hour, when MR. HuME handed to the Chancellor some
papers, which he received with the greatest good humour, and returned
with a smile and a courteous nod, which seemed to give the liveliest
satisfaction to the Members of the Deputation, for some waved their
handkerchiefs, and others flourished their hats with such enthusiasm that
LoRD BRough AM rose, when the Deputation immediately withdrew.
His Lordship continued several minutes, turning from one side of the
House to the other, when, recollecting all of a sudden he had nothingto
say, and that, under those circumstances, it was useless saying another
word about it, he very properly sat down.
The House adjourned at five o'clock, as quietly as it assembled.

MISS ADDISON IN PERIL.
THERE is an old gentleman º on a war by himself in the Post.
Qne day he writes an article with his left hand, calling himself “Philo-
dramatis;” the next, he answers himself with his right, putting himself
down as “A Shakspeare Worshipper.” And all this ambidexterous scrib-
bling is upon Miss ADDIson, a very charming young lady, and one who,
when she will consent to part with her words without spasms to follow,
will be an excellent actress. In the meantime, it is wicked that the lad
should be left to the mercies of the double-handed critic, who in his exal-
tation of Miss ADDISON aims to lower a rival Desdemona. The right-
hand, that is the Shakspeare Worshipper, takes a third of a column to
tell us what Miss ADDIsoN is not. Here is some of it:—
“Miss Addison does not hold herself in leash, in unnatural under-action, [what action
can this be?) till she spies an opening from which to rush out upon and overwhelm the
unguarded spectator. Miss Addison is not a statue animated by a fallen angel—or, if
you will, a Pythoness by the god—or a willow swept by an occasional gust.”
Miss ADDIsoN is certainly not a willow. The figure of the willow-
pattern, if it apply at all, can only apply to MRs. CHARLEs KEAN, and
only then as “ MISS TREE l’”

LET HIM TURN AND FLEE.--
We beg to call attention to an involuntary contribution which has
just been made to the British Museum by those concerned in the
improper ventilation of the Room, as will be at once seen by
the following extract from the evidence before the Commission of
Inquiry º lately beenholding its ; While T.H. TuRNER,
., was under examination, he made the following reply to a question
(No. 6208), which was addressed to him by SIR. R. i. uRchison :-
“6208. (Sir R. I. Murchison.) Have you found any inconvenience from the want of
ventilation?–Yes; and I would observe that nothing can equal the dirt of the Reading
Room. There is a flea-generated in that room that is larger than any to be found
elsewhere, except in the receiving rooms of workhouses.”
It is evident that an acquisition has been made by the British Museum,
which the Authorities do not properly appreciate, for here is a “Monster
Flea" which has a right to rank among the Megatheria of insect life,
and to take its place by the side of the Mammoth Moths and other
wonders of animated Nature, which are contained in the great National
collection, Weinsist, in the name of the Public, that a detainer should
instantly be lodged against this extraordinary Flea, or that it should be
brought up by Habeas before the Zoological Society, or removed by
Certiorari from the Reading Room to some other apartment in the
Museum. If the race of this. Monster Flea could be preserved, it
would be of the utmost service in supplying the next demand occasione
by those whom it is positively necessary to send away with a Flea in

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS To A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
SOME MORE WORDS ABOUT THE LADIES.
UFFER me to speak, my dear Bob, and in somewhat a grave
tone, about women, and their influence over you young
fellows—an influence so vast, for good or for evil.
I have, as #. pretty well know, an immense sum of
money in the Three per Cents, the possession of which,
does not, I think, decrease your respect for my character,
and of which, at my demise, you will possibly have your
share. But if ever I hear of you as a Casino haunter,
as a frequenter of Races and Greenwich. Fairs, and such
amusements, in questionable company, I give you my
honour you shall benefit by no º: mine, and I
divide the portion that was, and is I hope, to be yours,
amongst your sisters.
Think, Sir, of what they are, and of your mother at home,
| spotless and pious, ºf and pure, and shape your own
W course so as to be wort y of them. Would you do any-
º to give them º Would you say anything that
should bring a blush to their fair cheeks, or shock their
gentle natures?... At the Royal Academy Exhibition last
year, when that great stupid, damdified donkey, CAPTAIN GRIgG, in company
with the other º oaf, MR. GowkER, ventured to stare in rather an insolent
manner, at your º little sister FANNY, who had come blushing like a May-
rose from Miss PINKERTON's Academy, I saw, how your honest face flushed
up with indignation, as you º a sight of the hideous grins and ogles of
those two ruffians in yarnished boots; and your eyes flashed out at them
glances of defiance and warning so savage and terrible, that the discomfited
wretches turned wisely upon their heels, and did not care to face such a resolute
young, champion as BoE, BRown. What is it that makes all
your blood tingle, and fills your heart with a vague and fierce
desire to thrash somebody, when the idea of the possibility of
an insult to that fair creature enters your mind? You can't
bear to think that injury should be done to a being so sacred,
so innocent, and so defenceless. You would do battle with a
GoLIAthin her cause. Your sword would leapfrom its scabbard
(that is, if you gentlemen from Pump Court wore swords and
scabbards at the present period of time,) to avenge or defend her.
Respect all beauty, all innocence, my dear Bob; defend all
defencelessness in your sister, as in the sisters of other men.
We have all heard the story of the Gentleman of the last
century, who, when a crowd of young bucks and bloods in the
Crush-room of the Opera were laughing and elbowing an old
lady there—an old lady, lonely, ugly, and unprotected—went
up to her respectfully and offered her his arm, took her down
to his own carriage which was in waiting, and walked home
himself in the rain, and twenty years afterwards had ten
thousand a year left him by this very old lady, as a reward
for that one act of politeness. We have all
nor do I think it is probable that you will have ten thousan
a-year left to you, for being polite to a woman: but I say, be
polite, at any rate. Be respectful to every woman. A manly
and generous heart can be no otherwise; as a man would be
gentle with a child, or take off his hat in a church.
I would have you º this -
women—from the finest lady of your acquaintance down to
the laundress who sets your Chambers in order. . It may safely
be asserted that the persons who joke with barmaids or servants
at lodgings, are not men of a high intellectual or moral capacity.
To chuck a still-room maid under the chin, or to send off
MoLLY the cook grinning, are not, to say, the least of them,
dignified acts in any gentleman. The butcher-boy who b
the leg of mutton to Molly may converse with her over the
area-railings; or the youthful º: may, exchange a few
jocular remarks with BETTY at the door as he hands in to her
the tea and sugar: but not you. We must live according to
our degree. I hint this to you, Sir, by the way, and because
the other nightas I was standing on the drawing-room landing-
place, taking leave of our friends MR. and MRs. FAIRFAx, after
a very agreeable dinner, I heard a giggling in the hall, where
you were º; on your coat, and where that uncommonly
good-looking, parlour-maid was opening the door. And here,
whilst, on this subject, and whilst MRs. BETTY is helping you
on with your coat, I would say, respecting your commerce with
your friends' servants and your own; be ſº to them, and
they will be grateful to you in, return, depend upon it...Let
the young fellow who lives in lodgings respect the poor little
maid who does the wondrous work of the hºuse, and not send
her on too many errands, or ply his bell needlessly: if you visit
any of your comrades in such circumstances...be you too
respectful and kindly in your tone to the poor, little Abigail.
If you frequent houses, as I hope you , where are many
good fellows and amiable es who cannot afford to have
their doors opened or their tables attended by men, pray be
particularly courteous (though by no means so marked in your
attentions as on the occasion of the dinner at MR. FAIRfax's
to which I have just alluded) to the women-servants. Thank
them when º serve you. Give them a half-crown now and
then, nay, as, often as your means permit. Those small
gratuities make but a small sum in your year's expenses, and it
may be said that the F. of giving them never impoverished
a man yet: and on the other hand, they give a deal of innocent
happiness to a very worthy, active, kind set of folks.
Butletus hasten from the hall-door to the drawing-room,
where Fortune has cast your lot in life: I want to explain to
you why I am so anxious that you should devote yourself to
that amiable lady who sits in it. Sir, I do not mean to tell you
that there are nowomen in the world, vulgar and ill-humoured,
rancorous and narrow-minded, mean schemers, son-in-law hunt-
ers, slaves of fashion, hypocrites; but I do respect, admire,
and almost worship women; and Ithink thereisa . fair
number of such to be found in this world, and I have no doubt
in every educated Englishman's circle of society, whether he
finds that circle in palaces in Belgravia and May Fair, in smug
little suburban villas, in ancient comfortable old Bloomsbury,
or in back parlours behind the shop. It has been my fortune
to meet with excellent º ladies in every one of these
places—wives graceful and affectionate, matrons tender and
good, daughters º, and pure minded, and I urge the
society of such to you, because 1 defy you to thinkevil in their
Company. into the drawing-room o Z, that

what a frank kindness and natural sweetness and dignity! Her looks

likely find that she is ten times as well read as you are: she has a

off, and makes no more account of them than of her diamonds, or of the
splendour round about her—to all of which she is born, and has a happy,
admirable claim of mature and possession—admirable and happy for her
and for us too; for is it not a happiness for us to admire her? Does
anybody grudge her excellence to that paragon? Sir, we may be
thankful to be admitted to º: such consummate goodness and
beauty: and as in looking at a finelandscape or a fine work of Art, every
generous heart must be delighted and improved, and ought to feel
grateful afterwards, so one may feel charmed and thankful for having
knowing an almost perfect woman. Madam, if the

faithfully, O thou silver-wigged coachman' drive her to all sorts of
lendours and honours and Royal festivals. , And for us, let us be glad
that we should have the privilege to admire her.
Now, transport yourself in spirit, my good BoB, into another drawing-
room. There sits an old lady of more than four-score years, serene and
kind, and as beautiful in her age now, as in her youth, when Histor
toasted her. What has she not seen, and is she not ready to tell?
the fame and wit, all the rank and beauty, of more than half a century
have passed through those rooms where you have the honour of making
your best bow. She is as simple now as if she had never had any
pleased and being
kind. Can that have been anything but a good life which after more
than eighty years of it are spent, is so calm? Could she look to the end
of it so cheerfully, if its long course had not been pure? Respect her,
I say, for being so happy, now that she is old. We do not know what
rº and charity, what affections, what trials, may have gone to
make that charming sweetness of temper, and complete that perfect
manner., But if we do not admire and reverence such an old age as
that, * get good from contemplating it, what are we to respect and
admire? -
t and the custom of the world
Or shall we walk º the shop (while N. is recommending a tall
copy to an amateur, or folding up twopenny worth of letter-paper, and
bowing to a poor customer in a jacket and apron, with just as much
respectful gravity as he would shºw while waiting upon a Duke,) and
see MRs. N. º: with the child in the back parlour until N. shall
come into tea? They drink tea at five o'clock; and are actually as
well-bred as those gentle folks who dine three hours later. Or will you
please to step in to MRs. J.'s lodgings, who is 'g. and at work,
until her husband comes home from Chambers? She blushes and puts
the work away on hearing the knock, but when she sees who the visitor
palace whose equal she is, -in beauty, in goodness, in highbred
in the dancing-booths o
is,...she takes it with a smile from behind the sofa cushion, and behold,
it is one of J.'s waistcoats on which she is sewing buttons....She might
have been a Countess blazing in diamonds, had Fate so willed it, and
the higher her station, the more she would have adorned it. But she
looks as charming, while plying her needle, as the great lady in her
race
and simplicity:-at least, I can't fancy her better, or any Peeress being
more than her peer.
And it is with this sort of people, my dear Bob, that I recommend
you to consort, if you can be so ticky as to meet with their society—
nor do I think you are very likely to find many such at the Casino; or
Greenwich Fair on this present Easter
Monday. BRowN THE ELDER.

OUR AMERICAN DISPATCHES.
PUNCH picks the following tit-bits from the large bundle of Yankee
papers, which have been forwarded to him from his regular, slick,
go-a-head Correspondent at New York.
“There is a man in Connecticut, who began reading the President’s
last speech two months ago, and has not got through it yet. His health
still remains good.”
“The ngled Banner has the impudence to say of the British
Na * † like the Lords of the A. nothing better than a
bundle of sticks. The *#. ships may stand fire, but it is * clear
they cannot stand water. They are only fit for lucifer matches. Turned
upside down, they would make capital diving-bells, they go so steadily
to the bottom... We are inclined to believe that the great Government
Dockyards of England, are the Goodwin Sands, for it is a positive fact
that more English vessels have been wrecked there than anywhere else.’”
“The Philadelphia Sponge gives the account of a grand new Insolvent
Debtors' Court being erected at Philadelphia. It has been called,
“Repudiation Hall.’”
“The New York Revolver inquires, ‘What has America done that
all the Irish should fly there?’”
“The Trumpet of Truth gives a long account of a Windmill, the sails
of which ... by electricity, and of an omnibus horse that runs with
a cork leg; and the New York papers are full of a Laundress, who has
agreed with the principal Railways for permission to wash her linen in
their es, and hang it out to dry afterwards on the wires of their
Electric Telegraphs.”
Hungerford Suspension Bridge.
As so many robberies with considerable violence have been committed
on this bridge during the past two or three months, and as policemen
are not yet :#. protect wayfarers, we suggest that every pas-
senger resolving to cross, the Suspension should first put on a cork-
jacket. . Thus, if attacked, he may have a chance of saving his watch,
y leaping into the river.
“FOLLOWERS ALLOWED.”
THE insolvent M.Ps, in contemplation of the passing of a Bill to
render them liable for their debts, are taxing their ingenuity as to some
convenient method of meeting the new circumstances in which they
placed, and it is º: that they will take a hint from
SHERIDAN, who used to put the bailiffs into livery and them off as
flunkies of his own. e may expect that several of the cabs passing
down Parliament Street, will shortly be distinguished by a member of

the proposal to render them amenable to their creditors.

LORD BROUGHAM'S LAST FRIEND.
MARSHAL RADETzky, because he has beaten the
Piedmontese, is turned into a friend, by LoRD
BRough AM. Nothing like success in this world:
what dirty bread it will butter. . Nothing so
miserable as failure, what heroism...it will
blacken! The Edinburgh Review—a little late,
certainly, but better late than never—well exposes
the strange, morbid ard for tyrants and
tyranny that has for the last year possessed the
“respectability” of Englishmen, as though their
own liberties had grown, like their own oaks,
whilst they, the men, were asleep. Monckton
MILNEs, in his noble Letter to Lord Lansdowne,
has been one of the few men to say a fearless,
eloquent word in favour of political liberty, that,
however excellent for ourselves, has been con-
sidered an abstraction, and not to be understood
or sought for by other nations. In fact there
are to be no “livers out of Britain.”. As
MR. MILNEs has said, we sneer at the foreigner for his political
servility, and then abuse him when he seeks to stand before the world
a free man,—There have, to be sure, been atrocities committed abroad
in the name of freedom; but, we take it, that English liberty—our
beloved and well-toasted Constitution—did not come to us without a
few rough doings. It was not the prize of a popular holiday. Some-
thing richer than the blood of John BARLEY.corn was shed—something
harder, than plum-puddings was fired. But then, this is long ago.
What for Englishmen was a solemn strife—a noble duty, two centuries
since—is atrocity for the Frenchmen of 1848—for the Italian of 1849.
Both in Lords and Commons has incense been offered to foreign
despotism. In both F. tyranny has been called pretty names; and
the loser—no matter how noble his cause—been taunted with his loss.
Poor |. has been ridden over rough-shod, and English noblemen
have cheered, and waved their coronets at the sport. In the last debate
on Italian affairs EARL FITzwilliam “was of opinion that all through,
their Lordships had been bearing too hardly upon the fallen.” For this
reason, no doubt—they were fallen. A sleek fat bear upon the top of a
pole is a much nobler animal to contemplate than a sick lion withering
in a cage. Charles ALBERT loses the stakes, and he is, perfidious :
FREDERick is a successful despoiler, and lo! he is, on such prosperity,
FREDERICK THE GREAT!
And LoRD BRough AM would still smear honey on RADETzky, the
sword of Austria.-Yes: he
“Hoped that it would goforth to the public that there never had been a victory gained
by a foreign power which had satisfied so much the feelings and principles of all parties
in this country as the victory recently gained by MABshal, RADErzky.”
Is there no way by which the Emperor of Austria can do honour to
the Slaverer-General of all success p". BROUGHAM has not another
chance of the Woolsack, it would no doubt be pleasing to him could he
have a small bit of honour, in the shape of the Order of the Fleece. He
merits some distinction of the kind for his enthusiasm in the cause of
Austrian despotism; for it is not known (though most true) that LoRD
BROUGHAM, on returning home from the Lords, had throughout his
house a general illumination of several pounds of candles in honour of
the victory, and in admiration of the glory, of MARSHAL RADETzky'
SERIOUS ACCIDENT TO THE EARL OF ABERDEEN.
It is with one of those profound feelings that we always have in store
for great occasions, that we chronicle an accident that might have proved
very fatal to the EARL OF ABERDEEN. His Lordship went down to his
place in the House of Lords last week in excellent health, and in
average spirits. His Lordship with that buoyancy of manner, and with
that radiance of expression that have ever distinguished him in his
seat—“ . a sunshine in a shady place”—in a moment of inadven-
ture attempted a joke. His Lordship, slipping in the attempt, was
precipitated an immense depth below the comprehension of the #.
and for some time the most serious consequences were apprehended.
As the accident will make a part of Parliamentary History, it is our
duty to relate it in all its bearings. The noble—and, on this occasion
at least, must be added, gallant–Earl said, “we ought to leave France
alone in her mediation for the integrity of the Sardinian territory.” The
*RL or ELLENBoRough, as in duty bound, was much surprised at
this sentiment; w pon–
“The EARL or ABERDEEN observed, that he was a Scotchman, and, if he had not
known to the contrary, he should have imagined that his noble friend (Lord ELLEN-
Rohough) was a Scotchman too—for he had often heard it said that never yet was
Scotchman who understood a joke. What he had said about the sole mediation of
France was a joke, or rather an unhappy attempt at a joke; and his noble friend seemed
to think that he was in earnest."
|Upon this, we are proud to record it, the majority of the Peers pre-
sent gathered about the Noble Earl, and betrayed the most pleasing
solicitude as to his condition after the daring attempt at a joke—an
attempt that had failed so fearfully, LoRD BROUGHAM, we regret to say
showed but little sympathy, for the sufferer; indeed, it is our disma
duty to state, that his Lordship seemed to enjoy an inward chuckle at
the mournful misadventure of his brother Scot. We could dwell upon
this circumstance; butlet us draw a veil before the melancholy picture
of human malignity. There is, however, one delightful point, Hlelight-
ful i. redeeming—incidental to the event. Reader, (in confidence) it
is this.
The uninstructed fashionable world believe that the EARL or ABER-
DEEN is, at the present moment in the Highlands, having departed for the
land of cakes and thistles, on the adjournment of the House. No such
thing. The Noble Earl—on the rising of the Lords—immediately made
his way, in “a humble but faithful” cab, to the house of Punch, 85,
Fleet Street. Punch in a moment divined the cause of the Noble Earl's
visit; and after a very brief and no less cordial statement of matters, it
was arranged between ABERDEEN and Punch that the Noble Earl
should lodge at Punch's office during the Easter Holidays, in order that,
on the re-opening of the House, his Lordship might appearin his place,
primed for his natural life with a fine sense of a joke, and with a ready
power of its infliction.
Of course, Punch began with the Elements of Wit; and he must avow
that after very few lessons the Noble Earl cleverly mastered jokesin one
two, and three syllables. Furthermore, Punch took the Noble fari
with him to Greenwich Fair, on Easter Monday; and could, if he would,
print the Noble Earl's conundrum, made—almost at a blow-upon the
wooden leg of a Greenwich Pensioner. As, however, it is the EARL of
ABERDEEN’s wish to reserve the conundrum for his next Speech on
Foreign Affairs, Punch scorns to anticipate it. Punch will, however,
venture to say this much. Henceforth, ABERDEEN’s Scotch jokes will
not be synonymous with Scotch Mulls.
THE IDEAL AND THE REAL.
THE Government having
stated, on its own high autho-
rity, that the adulteration of
coffee by chicory is a great im-
provement on the genuine
article, MR. CHIsholmſ ANSTEY
has proposed to place the British
Tea Leaf under the protection
of Parliament. We all recollect
the old story of the real pig and
the imitation, when the palm
was carried off by the latter:
and it seems that we are to
apply the same principle, of
preference to a variety of other
subjects. The º of
chicory to coffee having been
allowed, we have no doubt that
the priority of the sloe will very
soon be acknowledged, and that
the genuine tea plant will have
to take its leave of our tea-
tables. The great domestic
cigar interests will, no doubt
soon assert their claims, and
the cabbage-root will assert its
equality with the . che-root,
§. by the way, is already
claimed for it in some of our
commercial Havannah marts.
Gold AND CORN.
It is said that “one hundred thousand bushels of corn had rotted in
California for want of persons to gather it.” Which was longest in the
ear? The “corn” or the “persons?”
LAYING DOWN PICTURES.
THERE is an analogy between wine and paintings; both, to a certain
extent, are improved by keeping. Hence, probably, it is,.. that the
authorities of the National Gallery have stowed away the pictures so
generously presented to the public by MR. VERNoN, in the cellars of
that Institution.

ENGLAND'S RETURN WISIT TO FRANCE.
[From Lond BBough AM, Punch's Own Reporter.]
BouloGNE-SUR-MER, April 5.-Having lº abused the crass
French Republic, it was only consistent that I should desire to spend
the Easter Holidays under the auspices of its Government... I left
Folkstone this morning in two steamers (carrying 350 generous English-
men), and stood into Boulogne port at half-past eleven. As soon as my
travelling cap was discernible from the shore, the artillery of the National
Guards saluted it. When I came alongside the quay in both the steamers,
the Colonel of the National Guards ordered the band to strike up
the Chancery anthem of God sare Henry Brougham / After this, about
thirty matelots (that is, sailors) surrounded me, offering nosegays about
the circumference of .#. These I received, assuring the
matelots that on my return to England, I would—with an º:
speech—distribute the flowers among the several button-holes of the
several members of the House of Lords. Then I made a speech to
myself from the Sous-préfet and the Mayor, and answered it to Qur
mutual satisfaction. After myspeeches, Iwaseonducted underatriumphal
arch (from which I was delighted to see, suspended by blue ribbons, copies
of all my books,) to the waiting-room, where I drank win d'honneur in
a dozen of Champagne to the eternal enmity of both people, that is, of
France and myself. At half-past twelve, I was off in the train with the
350 ragamuffin visitors (this between ourselves) behind me. On my
return to Boulogne, it is, I understand, the intention of the authorities
to invite me to a fancy-dress ball, with a request, that in the course of
the evening, I will appear in all the celebrated characters sustained by
me in the pages of Punch. Will youtherefore request MEssRs. LEECH
and Doyle to superintend the id: of some coloured copies, and
have them forwarded to me either at MEURICE’s, or the English
Ambassador's P - -
During the stay of our countrymen, I shall head them in their walks

CLIMBING BOYS IN THE NAVY.
WE had iº. the whole race of Climbing Boys had been
swept away by the Ramoneur of civilisation, but it seems that the Navy
is not looked upon as coming within those Civil Departments to which
the rules of civilisation are applied. It is, we are told, the custom in
HER MAJESTY's steamers, to teach the § the mysteries of
Engineering, by sending them occasionally up the Flues, which makes
them adepts in the art of rising in their profession, in which they cannot
obtain ultimate elevation until they have learned how to go in at the
bottom of a Flue and come out at the top of it. If Engineering were
one of the black arts, and if it were true, as of the old Ox-driver, that he-
“Who learns black science should himself be black,”
we might approve of this habit of sending the Middy into the midst
of the soot of a chimney; but we do not exactly see what can be
*#. by this arrangement, beyond very black looks indeed.
f this SQUEERs-like mode of proceeding were generally adopted, it
would be advisable to teach a knowledge of steam by boiling the Student
down in the copper, and inculcating an acquaintance with iaii practice,
by thrusting him into the cannon, and thus with the aid of a ramrod,
ramming his profession literally down his throat. We recommend the
Midshipmen to petition the Admiralty at once, to place them on the
same|footing as the chimney-sweepers of the Metropolis, and allow each
of them a Ramoneur as their deputy, in the ascent of the Flues.
Charges of Legal Ordnance.
. GRIFyous complaints are often made of the shameful waste of ammuni-
tion which takes place in the Navy. A similar extravagance, however,
#. to a yet, greater extent in the legal department of public
usiness. The Dublin º: of the Times says, that some
friends of MR. MonAHAN, the Irish Attorney-General, go about boast-
ing, that the learned gentleman has made £24,000 already out of Mr.
DUFFY's trial. Surely, MR. DUFFY, cannot be worth the powder and
shot which has been thus recklessly, thrown away upon him. The
experiments in the Marshes at Woolwich must have cost far less in
many years than the trial of DUFFY.

The Dukes, Marquises, Earls, Bishops, Deans, and other distinguished Patrons of the
Drama, at the Theatre Royal, Rubens Room, Windsor Castle.
Taustees.—The Lord Chamberlain and Master of the Buckhounds.
STANDING Counsel.-The Attorney-General.
It is the object of this infant
Company (when so far grown
into capital, that it has cut its
figures), to effect Insurances
upon all and every Dramatic
Stock, alive and dead.
The Projectors, feeling that
tromage of HER MAJESTY-an
impetus begun at the Castle,
Windsor, and to be felt some
day at Sadler's Wells, Isling-
toº—are convinced that the
number of Actors, and conse-
quently the number of Plays

in the course of next winter at
farthest, be increased to an
astounding extent. Therefore,
afterwards obtained), it is the
purpose of the Projectors to
offer most eligible rates of In-
surance to London Managers,

house and every denomination.
To the Manager, the Sock-

tragedian, or a ripening low comedian, acting at the time at
Herne, Bay, Stoke Pogis, or Billericay. Yes; MANAGER STRUTT
is willing to give a trial to MR. DAGGERwood; but, with a feeling
common to our nature, is very desirous to make a certain sum by
him. And MR. DAGGERwood has for some years had an eye di-
rected towards the London boards; yet, knowing that it is in the
power of a Manager to “crush” an actor—(and it is a painful
truth to consider, that there are Managers who have “crushed”
as many actors as, in their luxurious hours of dessert, they have
“crushed ” nuts)—MR. DAGGERwood is anxious to secure a certain
number of Metropolitan appearances without the risk of loss. To
these two interesting individuals—to STRUTT and DAGGERwood—
the Sock-and-Buskin offer the best facilities. For instance: MR.
STRUTT may, for a certain sum—(and the Sock-and-Buskin have calcu-
lated upon the very best Greenroom Tables)—insure the success of the
juvenile DAGGERwood; paying a certain rate of premium for ten,
twenty, or a hundred appearances, according to the height of his enthu-
siasm, or the depth of his pocket. Thus, let it be imagined that
MR. DAGGERwood is hooted from the boards, it may be amidst a
shower of penny-pieces—ſand it is not to be despaired of that the
Wº: public will again warm º to such wonted fervour)—the
anager is secured against a terrific loss—is sheltered from a ruinous
outlay, On the other hand, MR. DAGGERwood makes his appearance,
and albeit, such an appearance, for shrieking success, has not been
known since the *. —; or, to speak more correctly, has
never, never been known—yet, the Manager for some demoni
purpose best known to himself, resolves to “crush,” the artist—deter- |
mines to take him from the bills, and having “crushed” him like lump
sugar, to put him, like lump sugar, on the shelf—why, DAGGERwood
insured for a certain sum by the Sock-and-Buskin, smiles serenely on
the petty tyrant, and if he so elects, may pull the nose of the Treasurer.
It is not too much to...hope that, the advantages, hereby offered to
Manager and Actor will, whilst it affords safety to the individuals
themselves, tend to increase the supply of acting to the Metropolitan
boards in the raw material.
To Dramatists, the Sock-and-Buskin appeals with confidence. An
author writes a pla ; he is—it should be assumed—an unknown author.
Nevertheless, he has written The Sanguinary Saw-Pit; or the Course ºf
True Love never did run Smooth. The dramatist knows that there is
a great impetus has been given
to the Drama by the high Pa-
with an Assured Capital (to be and

more in that play than any * produced before the days of ELIZABETH;
but he cannot get it acted. There is a conspiracy among Managers to
have nothing really good. And then every Theatre is a close .
Half-a-dozen translators stand in the way, with presented quills, like
orcupines from the Jardin des Plantes—barring and pricking out the
riginal Man. Again; there would be some expense in the production
of the Saº Pit, ..". Manager will not come down with the dust.
Well, the Author desires to insure the life of his Play for a run of Five
Hundred Nights. He brings his Play for examination to the Office of
the Sock-and-Buskin; and theife of the Play for Five Hundred Nights
is received as a Good Life ; or, it is—not.
. Again, should the Manager desire to secure himself against all the
risks of outlay-outlay of time in rehearsals and Dutch metal in deco-
ration—he can at a certain Premium insure for any Number of Nights,
not exceeding Nine Hundred and Ninety Nine, and not less than One.
The Sock-and-Buskin will be open to the insurance of every kind of
Stage Entertainment, from the High Drama, to the Low. Pantomime.
Foreigners, however, will not be insured, it being found impossible to
#: any set of Tables to meet all the casualties of rickets and watery
Actors desirous to insure, will be required to rehearse before the
officer of the Company, Richard Jones, Esq., late of the Theatre
Royal, Covent Garden.

when the Building is taken.

SYMBOLS FOR THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
A CoRREspondent of the Athenæum, speaking of the decorations in
the House of Lords, suggests that there are too many Lions, Unicorns,
Irish Harps "...i them, and that symbols derived from the
colonies, as Tigers, Elephants, Zebras, and Kangaroos, might be intro-
duced with advantage. But this would be imparting a character too
zoological, an appearance too much like a child's Noah's Ark, to the
interior of that august edifice... We have a set of Symbols to propose,
of a much higher order, aesthetically, than the wild beasts; and if some-
what inferior to them as ornaments, surpassing them vastly in utility.
The House of Peers, i.e. our notion, should be adorned with
the effigies of |. London Pickpockets and Lucifer Match-Boys,
Spitalfields and Paisley Weavers, Agricultural Labourers living on nine
shillings a week, Sempstresses, and Workhouse Paupers; also of some
Convicts, a Jack KETCH, and a Gallows, in order to illustrate the social
developments of the day. . A little to soften the effect of objects which
by themselves, perhaps, look somewhat too melancholy, they might
be diversified by the figures of Footmen and Coachmen in liveries, and
|Parish Beadles in fuliuniform, which would afford fine opportunities for
painting and gilding; besides serving as records of ...; taste. In
short, our decorations would serve Noble. Lords as political and social
remembrancers; and, when future legislation shall have remedied all
our grievances, as monuments to remind their Lordships of the condition
of England at the time when their House was built.

A BEGGARLY SHAME.
THE cry is “What can be done with Ireland?”, England is fairly
| tired of her bargain; France has quite enough to take care of herself;
and America will not even mention a price. The whole world apparently
turns its back upon Ireland. What a thousand pities it is to see so
fine a country “go a begging !”
Call the Police.

the subjoined that he will immediately give him into cust as it is
dangerous to leave at one who can have no other object than
provoking persons to break the public peace:–
Why is it encouraging robbery to pay a penny-a-liner?
Because it is clear that all his payments must be per lined (purloined.)

DEFINITION OF A. “BRICK.”
THE meaning of this word, which has been lately introduced into our “fast”
Literature, has often puzzled us. If we judged of the structure of our present
Society from the specimen of one of its “Bricks,” we should say it was of a
very composite order, in which the Gent figured as the foundation and every-
º that was base. A “regular Brick” implies, we believe, the possession
of all the Gentish, that is to say, vulgar accomplishments... Young men emulate
one another in being Bricks. They smoke, dance, and sing and run uplbills,
—and it is all done “like Bricks.” . The attributes of a |Brick, in fact, are
universal. Like a pawnbroker, he takes in everything. He is versed in every
ssible and impossible grace and knowledge. Ét down the Admirable
XRICHTON, multiply by BARQN, NATHAN plus LoRD BROUGHAM, and you have
a perfect “Brick”—a “Brick” of theyery finest clay, fit to adorn any palatial
residence, or, otherwise... We feel a library might be filled with the charac-
teristics of the “Brick.” Until this extraordinary genus, -or, rather, if the
reader will pardon the expression, genius, is thoroughly Buffoned, we are glad
to clear away a little of the obscurity that at present reigns around the word
by the following definition, which we take from the Indian letter of a Subaltern,
published in the Times. it is only such little straws, picked out one by one,
that will ultimately show what the “Brick” is really composed of:—
“Shehr SINGH treats him like ‘a Brick. He has twenty men to guard him all day and night,
and has a bottle of brandy placed on his breakfast-table every morning.”
Ergo, to have twenty men continually hanging about your arm-chair, or round
your pillow, and to have a bottle of Cognac every morning for breakfast, is to be
treated “like a Brick.”. Gracious goodness! with temptations like these, who
wouldn’t be a “Brick?”
* SIR ROBERT AND HIS TUTOR.—A FABLE.
SIR ROBERT, lately, on a day,
From all the cares of office free,
To pass a leisure hour away,
Betook himself a School to see—
A Model School, his own device;
A sort of philanthropic toy, .
Whose management gives him a nice
Pleasant employ.
The pupils all, the blue frock-coat
And spacious primrose waistcoat knew,
And seemed his presence not to note;
But whatsoe'er they had to do
Continued doing, wrote or
Nor ceased their various tasks to con;
From form to form with stately tread, ,
Whilst he walked on.
At length his steps he did arrest
Behind a pair of little youths,
Whose deep attention was address'd
To CocKeR's interesting truths.
The double eye-glass, brought to bear
By the ex-pilot of the State -
Upon them, show'd this youthful pair
Bent o'er a slate.
“Bother this long-division sum!”
Impatiently cried one young wight,
“Somehow I cannot make it come, ,
Although I try my hardest, right.”
The slate the other urchin took,
And answer'd, “Can't you? Let me see ;
Over your sum I'll have a look,+ .
Leave it to me.”
He cast his eye the figures o'er,
« #. saw º: sum was all amis;
is no use tagging any more,
Said he, “at such a mess as this;
That jumble to correct, I call
Any attempt completely vain;
Let's rub it out, and do it
Over again.”
“Thanks, infant sage!” SIR ROBERT cried,
“A fine idea—I’ll note it down;
Oh! lesson for a Stateman's pride:
Here, my go y, is half-a-crown—
That little lad has taught me what
I had not learned in many a year:
How, when affairs confused have got,
To make all clear.”
The next time in ST. STEPHEN’s Hall
SIR RoBERT's radiant face did beam,”
He admiration won from all,
By putting forth his Irish scheme,
As also his ºl.i.
The pest of Chancery to destroy;
All which was taught to this great Man
By a Small Boy.
LEGISLATIVE WEIGHT IN AMERICA.
THE New York Commercial Inquirer publishes some curious
statistics relative to the Assembly of New York, ºf
among other things the weight of the members: on whic
interesting point it states the following particulars:–
“Thirteen of the Members weigh each 200 pounds and upwards. The
heaviest is Lewis AvRRILL, of Olsego County, 272 pounds; and the highest
are MERwin R. BREwer, of New York; Roscius R. KENNEDY, of Saratoga;
and WEssel J. SMITH, of Queen's ‘. weighing each 130 pounds. The
average weight of each Member is a little less than 1654 pounds.”
If the weight of the Members of a deliberative body is to be
estimated by the pound, the warmth of their discussions may
as well be ascertained by the thermometer. It would be also
desirable to determine the specific gravity as well as the
simple heaviness of each; for which Fº Punch might
be submitted to their perusal, in order to see who could
longest resist us... But the American statistician evidently
means the actual physical weight of the gentlemen in question;
a matter no doubt of some consequence in a body where a stand-
up fight on party questions is something more than a metaphor.

WE are familiar—through the
graphists of the press—with
showers of frogs, showers of lady-birds, showers of º showers of
hisses, and showers of various other objects; but we have lately observed
that in London a shower of rain is always accompanied by a tremendous
shower of mendicants. No sooner does it begin to pour in torrents
than the streets are inundated with a perfect cataract of beggars, who
seem to imagine that the public bounty will flow in sympathy with the
watery element. There must be something quite * ibious in the
habits of the mendicant race; for they are eager at all times to avail
themselves of a thorough drenching. -
They know, moreover, that there is a vast amount of that mistaken
benevolence, which was exemplified in the conduct of the old gentle-
man, who held an umbrella over the duck in the shower of pain,
and which will also be at hand to provide the means of shelter for those
who voluntarily rush from under it when the pelting of the storm
happens to be particularly pitiless.
It is strange that those whose appearance testifies their horror of
water from the pump, should be so eager, to accept it direct from the
clouds; and we could have no great objection to the arrangement,
were it not that it leads to the placing of so many helpless infants
in soak, for the purpose of exciting the benevolence of the public,
whose injudicious readiness to give, where a baby is in the case, leads
to an immense demand in the Begging Trade for children that are
washable, and are “warranted not to run,” but will stand any quantity of
water that may be poured down upon them. If the public would show ten-
derness towards the beggar babyhood of modern Babylon, not a halfpenny
would be bestowed on those professional mendicants who expose children
as part of their stock in trade; and we may affirm with truth, that of all
the helpless infants brought out to excite compassion in a shower of
rain, not one in twenty would be exposed to the washing, if the indiscri-
minate alms-giver did not encourage the washing by providing the
coppers.
CHATELAINES FOR GENTLEMEN.
A FRENch fashion is now busy investing the large body of French
;. with Chatelaines. ese do not hang, as with English
es, from the waist, but from the waistcoat pocket. They are generally
attached to the watch—or, supposing the gentleman has no such useful
appendage for killing time, H. º are fastened to the waistcoat-
button, and allowed to dangle gracefully therefrom.
The different ornaments that are on the Hanging Committee vary, of
course, with the taste of the decorator. , Sportsmen (we use the wor
in its French sense), carry foxes heads, silver horse-shoes, little riding-
whips, daggers, pistols, and guns gold race-horses with steel jockeys,
big bulldogs, and ferocious wild boars. Tigers and elephants are not
excluded, whilst we have seen a petit maitre, who, like a Boulogne
oyster, was all beard, carry nearest to his heart a huge bunch of eagles
and owls, with large carbuncles for eyes. To see these numerous
sporting Chatelaines, you would conclude that Frenchmen were of a
most ferocious nature, and spent half their lives in revolutions, and
the other half either in a battue, or a jungle. But there are also
some of a sentimental, tender nature, to please the extensive race of
Parisian Anonises. This class of Chatelaines comprises two hearts tied
tºgether, like, the paniers over a donkey's back, hands passionately
clasped together, tiny CUPIDs with bows and arrows, scent-boxes,
ABELARDs and HELoises in profusion, with a large sprinkling of
Psyches, RICHELIEUs, WENUSEs, and Mousquetaires.
This fashion will, of course, be finding its way over the Channel. It
will soon make a noise in Fops’ Alley, and be heard in the Crush-rooms
of both Operas. Should Chatelaines beintroduced? We see no objection
to the latch-key being worn; a corkscrew might also be thrownin, and a
wire-nipper for champagne and soda-water could likewise be added, if
the collection was not important enough. These, with a small pencil
and a card-case, and perhaps a miniature betting-book to pick up
the stray odds, would be sufficient, and would, all of them, combine
| utility with ornament; but where is the use of carrying about with you a
| silver boot-jack, the size of your thumb-nail, which you could not use if
your boots pinched you ever so much P
The articles above enumerated are to be found in the pockets of
| almost every gentleman (about town), and they may as well be worm all
together, in an easy, conspicuous place, where you can find them the
moment you want them, instead of having, as at present, to empty your
pockets of letters, keys, loose silver, secrets, and odd gloves, before
you, an ever find the precise article you are in search oft If English
gentlemen ever lend themselves to Chatelaines, let the absurdity be
applied to an useful end.

WHAT’S TO BECOME OF THE MARBLE ARCHP
OUR active contemporary the Builder, shows a weekly anxiety
relative to the future w ereabouts of the Marble Arch “removed from
the front, of Buckingham Palace.” The last place suggested, is the
front of the British Museum. We by no means accord with the opinion
of our friend; though we share in an intense degree in his concern for
the fate of KING GEORGE THE Fourth’s marbles. For the Arch is a
thing of history; pregnant with meaning in every stone, as bricks of
We recognise the magnificent mind of GeoRGE THE
Fourth—his patriotic contempt of £. s. d.—his taste for the absurd
and fantastic, if only costly. The mind of the First Gentleman, of
Europe was the region of gimcrack, and we would have the Marble
Arch preserved in a fitting place, as an enduring monument of the
j. and expensiveness of the royal intellect, . However, with
every respect for the opinions of the Builder, we object with all our
strength, to the front of the British Museum.
We have, on the contrary, º: to choose from in preference
to the Parish of Bloomsbury. e think the Western approach to
º Street by no means a bad site for the Arch, inasmuch as it
would harmonise with the second-hand f #. that is the staple
commerce of that locality. Court-suits of fra .# embroidery and far:
nished metal associate very pertinently with the present reputation of
GeoRGETHE Fourth. Think of his past bravery, his departed finery
—and what is GEORGE in history but a Royal Old Clothesman?, Verily,
his reputation deals in nothing better than the past glory of the tailor
and the laceman—a glory departed.
Piracy Beyond the Atlantic.
In its American Intelligence, the Times lately mentioned that
“Mr. Macau-ly’s Histo º” in type, arrangement, and even punctuation,
precisely similar to tºº. edition, had been published at the price
of 1s. #d. per volume. In all probability England has lost a genius.

Homicide FAIR.
“The Fair is held immediately contiguous to the Castle, the prison in which the
murderer, Rush, is confined. Drums, trumpets, and other instruments have been in full
play all day, whilst the most boisterous sounds of revelry proceed from the degraded
people who are its principal supporters.”—Observer.
HE Tradesman of the Observer
—a Royal print, as declared
by the owner, with lively sym-
pathies (price 6d. with a Sup:
plement) in any case of horrid
murder—the Sunday Trades-
man is affectingly touched by
the revelries of Norwich Fair,
a Fair “held immediately con-
tiguous to the Castle, the pri-
son in which the murderer
Rusſi, is confined.” "Assmall
members of the most enlight-
ened Press of the world, we
felt a pleasurable thrill com-
municated by the emotion of
our high-minded and large-
hearted contemporary. For he
- - - - disdaims to turn a penny upon
homicide; he will not seek for sixpences in the murderer's cell; he
will not grope for profit among the nasty doings of Potash, No; he
washes his hands of all such abomination: and then, specially cleansed
for the occasion, raises them towards heaven, with a j. mixture
of pity and disgust of “the degraded people,” who beat drums and
blow trumpets at Murder Fair.
. The philanthropist of the Observer, with all his sublimated goodness,
is, nevertheless, a little weak; it may be, a little arrogant. We fear he
shares somewhat of the pride too apt to swell the London tradesman,
making the metropolitan merchant º with contemptuous, exacting
looks, the country dealer. Surely, this should not be. Because the
Observer has a brick shop in the Strand, for the sale of the portrait of a
murderer, with the very latest º of the condemned cell,—should
the “itinerant showman,” with his hired representative of RUSH, and
drum and trumpet for prefatory flourish,_should he, the humble vendor
of excitement, be sternly rebuked by the tradesman householder?
“Drums, trumpets, and other instruments,” says the Observer, with
one tear rolling down his nose, “have been in full play all dº. whilst
the most boisterous sounds of revely V. from the degraded
people who are its principal supporters.” Very bad; and very saddening
this, for Christian men; that atrocity should be turned into profit;
that the curse of blood should be made to coin blood-money. In such
sense drums and trumpets are noisy abominations; rumbling blatant
devils, proclaiming a filthy market. Now, it is otherwise with the booth
in the Strand." Observer beats no drum-blows no trumpet: no ; with
a truer sense of the dignity of his calling, he sends forth some half dozen
vans to mingle, all day long, in the stream of daily pleasure, and daily
commerce, to tell the lounger and the man of business that the “Mur-
derer Rush "-"The Fullest Account”—“The Latest Particulars”—
with, “Portrait of the Assassin”—that all this, and very much more,
will be given by Observer (price 6d.) on the Sunday:
Observer, lamenting the atrocities of Murder. Fair, says “the exhibi-
tion was of the most disgraceful character.” Moreover, “an application
was made to the magistrates to put down the disgraceful exhibition, and,
after some consideration, they declined to interfere.” In the like
manner that SIR PETER LAURIE would stop. Observer's van, though,
as, in the case' of Observer's humble rivals, the authorities have
hitherto declined to interfere: “In the next show,” says Observer, “is
a pantomime, in which MR. J. B. Rush figures as Pantaloon.” This is,
...}; an unwarrantable liberty even with, such a devil as, RusH.
Now Observer respects the courtesies of refined life, and when he sells
the #"; of a murderer, sells the homicide in plain clothes—even in
the habit that he wore. “The exhibition,” says Observer, “is one of
the most revolting character, but at the same time the most remunerative
in the fair.” . Even as thrifty, but no less º Observer, with
hands in his breeches' pockets, standing at his booth in the Strand, and
gazing at the vans as one by, one they departed on their advertising
way-even, as Qāserver...with his eye upon that monstrous type-
“PQRTRAITOF RUSH"—might, if he would, muse confidentially
to himself, “This placard is of a most revolting character, but will be
the most remunerative for this many a Sabbath.”
Thus considered, Observer ought to be more charitable towards his
fellow-tradesmen, the mummers of the Fair. Granted, that “throughout
the Fair the name of the unfortunate man is turned to all sorts o pur-
poses, many of them no less revolting than those, just described,”—
nevertheless Observer enjoys a wider latitude—has, by the power of the
press, many more opportunities—(and moreover, has the commercial
§: to employ them)—than the miserable people who dine upon
USH as Pantaloon.” Observer can turn not only Rush himself to
curse it is to be related to him. “A rumour was circulated to-day,”
says Observer, “that Rush's eldest daughter was dying of the shock.”
The rumour was false; but Observer has here the advantage of the
Showman; for rumour, as well as truth, helps to fill a supplement.
Indeed, nothing of Rush, but what doth suffer profitable change in the
till of Observer. “At times”—says the proprietor of the booth in the
Strand—“at times he whistles!”

And in these days to think that letters should flourish in a murderer's
dungeon For Qbserver º: of a bookseller who
Rush that he will give £500 to each of his children,
º to “offer
if he will write a
history of his life, in order to its publication, in the form of a volume.”
For the proper dignity of literature, it would of course be necessary to
respite RusH ; unless the bookseller, complimenting the genius of the
assassin, believes a fortnight time sufficient for the composition of a
volume. Surely this is a shocking Curiosity of Literature, that a murderer
on his road to the gallows should be jã by a publisher. What are
the prison regulations at Norwich
But in every way the reputation of RusH is to be made a familiar
household matter. MADAME Tussaud, as the allowed old clotheswoman
of the exalted and the infamous, has made—says, Observer—an offer
“for the purchase of Rush's disguises on the night of the murder.”
Very right.
“There's shillings in the web of ‘em.”
A profitable investment in the loathsome, for the laudable curiosity
of an enlightened people !. Rush—having been duly canonised by
Observer—has earned his rightful niche in the Chamber of Horrors.
The Sunday print having traded upon the portrait of the, incarnate
devil, the murderer's clothes become a proper jº. for the
Show woman. They, too, are tangible things, and will keep alive the
memory of RUSH when, - -
forgotten, though still fraught and fragrant with, the wisdom and
religion developed by a contemplation of the Norfolk horror.
Observer, having employed his own reporters—(“On Good Friday
}.} even the columns of Observer shall be
our reporters visited the scene of the late atrocious assassinations,”)-
having, with the best industry of thrift, made the most of every cir-
cumstance, even of the times when Rush “whistles,”—Observer,
having accepted the wood-cut of the murderer, as an excellent likeness,
and a beautiful, suggestive piece of art, for Sabbath circles, Qbserver,
dismissing every thought of van and poster, sits down to moralise upon
the profitable atrocity. “When better days shall dawn upon society,
humanity will recoiſ with horror from the details of the act.” We
think so too. Better days will come. Days, when the Observer of
the time will not be permitted to drive his van, and advertise his
account of the murder, and the murderer's doings, with the murderer's
pºrtrait, for the Sunday contemplation of Christian families. In the
better day” the newspaper trader upon assassination, the newspaper
artist to the condemned cell—will, if he exist at all, take rank with the
poor creature who represents Rush as Pantaloon ; with the Showman,
who, amid the din of drum and trumpet, calls upon a crowd of clowns
—the prim Observer’s “degraded people.”—“to walk up and see the
Murder!” In the present time, we see only this, difference between
“Itinerant Showman” and Observer; the one exhibits in a country
booth; the other bills from a London house. In the booth, you have
RUSH as Pantaloon; in the newspaper office, RUSH in plain clothes.
Tºtal” is a disgusting object; but the wood-cut is fine art for
almliles.
And BRowN, Jon Es, and Robinson — excellent people! — would
shudder at the thought of disbursing a penny to behold Rush as
Pantaloon ; but they will give sixpence to possess him as Qbserver.
And so it will be, until the press be all teachers, and none panders; in
the “better day” all innocently yearned for by Observer.
THE FLOWER OF THE ENGLISH IN FRANCE.
A Rose, as all readers of SHAKSPEARE well know, would be equally
odoriferous under any other appellation; but still, it would be a pity if
a disagreeable or unpleasant name were applied to a pretty flower. Such
a flower had, the other º a Yº: escape of such a name. Under
the heading of “The English in Paris,” it is related in the Times that—
“Previous to the visit of the English to the Opera Comique on Wednesday evening,
it was proposed by one of the body that each person should take with him to the theatre
a large bouquet of camellias, to throw on the stage, as a tribute to the Actresses. The
proposition was, however, abandoned on the advice of MR. John W.Anton, of Stratton
Street, Piccadilly, that 500 bouquets thrown upon the stage would totally prevent the
continuation of the performance.”
The idea of shooting a cart-load of Camellias on, a stage is as fine a
notion of a compliment as that of emptying a whole, tureen of Turtle
Soup over a plate would be of an act of hospitality. The poor Camellia
was within a hair's breadth of being stamped with an ill name for ever.
Had this clownish deed of pantomimic extravagance been perpetrated,
as sure as the Dividends, thenceforward, the Camellia would have been
called the Flower of English Fools.

ANTIQUITY OF EQUESTRIAN ANTICS.
THERE are a few things that have puzzled the world to this very
hour, and perhaps the three greatest of these puzzles are-Perpetual
Motion, the Philosopher's Stone, and the exact age of Winproom.B.
The last of these interesting mysteries, though not actually brought
into a state of solution, has some important light thrown upon it by
some Marbles in the British Museum, which relate to the inhabitants
of Nineveh, who, though remarkable for their shrewdness, and the
darkness of their colour, go by the inappropriate name of the Ninne.
vites. The Marbles in question introduce us to many of the wonders of
Astley's, which we had believed to be of modern date, but which turn
out to be in reality as old as the hills.
We have, in these ancient remains, the representation of a figure
a flying leap over a pair of horses, and we cannot doubt for a
moment that the leaping figure is that of the then youthful WIDDIcomb,
who no doubt always looked before he leaped, and must therefore have
lived anterior to the act, in the execution of which some early sculptor
has chiselled him. Time, we know, moves in a circle; and it is now
obvious that the scenes in this circle have been, from very remote ages,
much the same as those which in the Astleyan circle are to this day
exhibited.
Another portion of the remains now in the British Museum intro-
duces us to a piece of pristine WAN AMBURGH-ism, which proves that
Widdicoxib was not “alone in his glory” as an athlete of antiquity.
The Nimroud marbles leave no room for question that, in the age they
illustrate, there were brute-tamers who could play at any game (except
scratch-cradle) with the tiger, or poke their heads down lions' mouths,
with a comfortable conviction, that the thing would bear looking into.
We were already pretty well convinced of the fact of there being
nothing new under the sun, but we were hardly prepared to allow that
there is nothing new among the stars that shine in the dramatic
hemisphere.
PUNCH, PLUTUS, AND KING HUDSON.
(A Dialogue after the manner of Lucian.)
Punch. Who is it runs this way, followed by a pack of Curs that bark
about his heels, while that short figure in glistening dress of gold foil
strives to frighten them away by shaking money-bags?
Enter the KING and PLutus, out of breath.
What! the Iron King—hail, O Monarch 1 But what means this
dismay, these tattered garments, those dints on thy crown of iron?
Plutus. Cheer up, O friend-sae, already the pack slink backwards,
cowed, as it seems, by the baton of this º
King H. This, OPLutus, is a stranger, indeed, to thee alone of all the
|Gods; the Muses know him, and Phoebus, nor is the son of MAIA
himself averse from him. This, OPLutus, is Panch, the son of Momus
and Eumousia.
Plutus. Hail, O Punch. I am the God of Wealth, and I consort
ever among men. And now I protect my friend here, who has

Punch. I have seen many dethroned Kings, O PLUTus—amongst
them, Louis, the aged King of the Gauls.
Plutus. Him I knew well—a constant worshipper of mine, but I
cannot prop up thrones. I can only break the fall from them on my
money-bags.
Punch. And hast thou also fallen, O Iron King?
King H. I learn it only by these barkings. But why they bark I
know not-for I am the same as I was when they raised Golden Images
to me, and called me great, and ate much dirt at my hands, and tºok
cuffs and spurns with patience. I have done nothing that I did not then
do, and they were stilſ welcome to the crumbs from my table.
| Punch. But, Ö º do the crumbs still fallas abundantly as before?
Dogs must be fed or they will bark, and thy worshippers were but those
Dogs, that would now tear thee. -
King H. Give me gold, O PLutus, that I may throw it to them.
Plutus. O my friend, I cannot. What I had for thee, thou hadst,
and hast turned it into iron. -
Punch. Hear, O King, and I will tell thee a fable. Two gold diggers
sat by the Sacramento. And they digged, and the one got much more
gold than the other, for he plunged deeper in the mud of the stream.
And the other worshipped him, but it was the gold that he reve
and not the digger. But at last the strongest digger got out all the gol
in that place, and then he sat and rested his hands; and the other then,
seeing his hands, called out, “Q1, how dirty are thine hands, thou
vile digger of gold,” and reviled him. But his friend said to him,
look at thine own hands. Thou hast not gathered so much gold as
I, but no less dirt hath stuck to thy fingers.” Thus it is, O King, with
thee, and thy worshippers of yesterday. Hadst thougone ongrubbing for
gold, and giving them of it, they would not have noticed the foulness of
thy hands, but rather kissed them for the odour of gold that hung
about them.
| King H. But they worshipped me.
Panch, Nay—not thee, but the gold that came from thee. But now
art thou like the King of Brass, that sits at the Cross of Cl ..in the
º of London. He was taken down, and buried, and one sold knives
and forks, which the seller said were cast from the brass of him. So
thou shalt be taken down, and out of thee shall men make iron rails,
and thou shalt be railed upon in many ways. -
Plutus. Thou shouldst have known, O King, when thou didst become
my, worshipper, that the grºwns I can bestow are not lasting crowns,
º º the iron in thine did not make it more durable. Nevertheless,
|lpity thee. -
|, Punch. And I, that never bowed down to thee, while thou worest
thy crown, I will keep off the Dogs that now snap at the tattered hem
of thy royal robe.
| King H. O friend, I thank thee.
An Old Saw adapted to a Modern Instance.
THE Border hunters, as SIR WALTER Scott tells us in one of his
notes to the Border Minstrelsy, had an old rhyme on woodcraft, which
we recommend to the study of Lord John Russell—
“If thou be hurt by Roºnuck's horn it brings thee to thy bier,
But Leech's hand can boar's hurt heal, therefore thou need'st not fear."
LoRp John has pften been indebted to LEECH for taking of the
sting of the hurts inflicted by the bores of the House of Commons—

save him from the digs of a Roebuck.

WHAT IS IN A NAME?
To Mr. Punch.

the newspaper readers of

reason to believe that LoRD

able to pronounce the name
CHzRzANowski, and I am
therefore led to believe him
an impostor.

ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS.
THERE seems to be a very considerable amount of curiosity in the
public mind, as to the names of the individuals who frequent our
laces of public amusement; and the newspapers, with a good-natured
§. to gratify this curiosity, devote frequent paragraphs to the
record of the fact, that, at such and such a theatre Count SQ-and-So
Baron What-d’ye-call-him, and Messrs. or Mesdames This, That, and
T'other, were “observed?” among the audience. - -
We do not see why this spirit of observation should be limited to
the West End, theatres; and we have, therefore, some thoughts of
sending that unhappy myrmidon “our own reporter” to the unlicensed
theatres in the New Cut, for the purpose of “observing” or “taking
a sight” at the patrons, and frequenters of those establishments.
We are quite sure that these parties are well worthy of observation
in one sense at least, for there are some among them whom it would
be well for the police to have their eye upon. We should suggest a
column or two in the Police Gazette every week, announcing that at
the Penny Gaff, for example, certain suspected characters—who should
be mentioned by name—were “observed ’’ among the audience.
Some good might at any rate be effected by letting them, know
that they are “observed;” and we recommend one of the fashionable
H. to blend utility with its flunkeyism, by adopting the plan we
we suggested.

JENNY LIND IN TROUBLE.
Marlborough Street:+MR HARDWICKE, the respected Magistrate, on
taking his seat on Friday morning last, was applied to for a warrant to
require the attendance of Miss JENNY LIND, to answer a charge of
assault and ill-treatment. MR HARDwicke (evidently much moved) at
once granted the warrant, and at two o'clock, JENNY LIND appeared
to answer the complaint. The lady was attended to the office y the
Swedish Ambassador, and half-a-dozen Bishops. Many pattern people
from Exeter Hall were observed in the crowd. MR. LUMLEY, and
several of the most distinguished members of Her Majesty's Théatre,
were in attendance.
WoLPGANG AMADEUs MozART, a German gentleman of very shadowy
aspect, appeared as complainant. He said he was the parent of
%awberflöte. ... It was—saving a certain Requiem—his last child. He
had no vanity himself; he had, from December 5, 1791, known the
utter nothingness of the things of this world; nevertheless, for the
sacred interests of Art, he felt it to be his duty once more to appear
ºte against the contemptuous and ºi treatment that his
chlid-
MR. HARDw1CRE.-"Your immortal offspring.”
WoLFGANG AMADEUs MoZART meekly bowed.—That his child had
received from JENNY LIND.. It had been given to her to guard the
wreath that circled the musician's head; it had been given to her to
treasure his lute-strings as her own heart-strings; nevertheless, she-
(Here the witness faltered, and touched by his emotion, trembled into
tears). However, he would call his witnesses.
..MR. MoRNING Post sworn—Was present at the Classical Concert
picked out of Zauberflöte. Understood that Miss JENNY LIND had
scruples to appear in costume upon the stage. Much that was “inte-
resting in the Qpera fell lifelessly and inoperatively on the ear.” Was
of opinion that Miss LIND, if she persisted in her present course,

o ."
Mº Monrºe HERALP, depºsed that “the effect of the delicious
music was much enfeebled.” “The Audience was anything but enthu-
siastic.”—“A chilling indifference reigned throughout the evening.”
MR. MoRNING CHRONICLE declared that JENNY LIND was perfect
as, ever in voice and style, but “in the nature of the performance, her
talisman had lost its influence.”
MR. TIMEs was of opinion that “the performance altogether was
creditable to the establishment.”
This being the case for the Complainant, JENNY LIND was asked for
her defence. She was about to reply, when the B–H–p of N–R—ich
(as we understood) advised the Defendant not to speak, but to sing.
Whereupon, JENNY poured forth Non paventar amabil figlio. The
worthy Magistrate sank back in his chair—the police-officers embraced
one another—the whole Court were entranced and dissolved,—and
taking advantage of the moment, the aforesaid B–H–P led JENNY to
his carriage, and drove from the office in triumph.
It is plain that Wolfgang AMADEus. MozART has no remedy; but
he complains bitterly of the Bench of Bishops, and of the small people
who are very great at Exeter Hall, and who, it appears, by constantly
reaching to simple JENNY the sin of playhouse rouge and playhouse
ress, have converted an exquisite actress into a cold formalist. That
cant should kill a Nightingale!
Gallant Rescue, of a Dwarf.
WE perceive that our little friend, ADMIRALWAN TROMP, is advertised
as “surpassing any dwarf yet seen in stature, activity, and manner.”
Since surpassing in stature any dwarf yet seen º have been predi-
cated of Polyph EMus, whereas, we believe, the truth is that the
Admiral is at least a barleycorn shorter than ToM THUMB, it must be
supposed that the advertisers mean just the reverse of their statement
respecting the size of VAN TRoMP THE LITTLE. We feel called upon
to protect the § dwarf from the rampant bull which has been let
loose upon him by his careless friends.
RATHER NEAT. EHP
WHY does the business of the country get on so slowly?
Because it travels by a Parliamentary train.
USE OF THE KNIFE.
MR. Roppuck long rejoiced in our title of “The Bath Brick.”. We
hereby, give, him our royal leave to assume a new addition, “The
§.ºf Whittle.” We have no doubt he will prove pointed and
cutting enough, and we would merely caution him, against a want of
polish, which we have sometimes observed in his style of cut and thrust,
and which is injurious to even the keenest blades.

PUNCH AT GREENWICH FAIR.
DETERMINED on giving the Fair fair play, we attended RICHARDsoN's
Theatre in a spirit of impartiality, resolved to dignify the performances
with the same criticism we should bestow on a play acted at any other
establishment. We are unable to state the name of the drama—for as
we saw no bill, the title of the piece, like its plot, its j. and its
language, is enveloped in much mystery. The most staunch stickler for
the unities would, however, have been satisfied by some of the charac-
teristics of the drama, for the play had one act, one hero, one ghost, and
one heroine. We found in the first scene a Brigand Chief in love with a
fair Captive in a sarcenet body and muslin mittens. The Captive has a
Husband in a crimson surtout braided with gold door-leather, and in his
agony of despair he tears off some of the braiding down his coat while
upbraiding the “spiler of his . He insists' that his “art is
seriously sered,” and he apostrophises the Brigand (hiſ as a “r-rºr-ri,
creant r-r-r- n,” upon whom “r-rºr-revenge” shallbe “wr-r-r-reaked”
for having made him (the Husband) “a wr-r-r-retch, a wr-r-r-reck, and a
r-r-r-ruin.” - - -
The subsequent scene introduces us to the brigand’s cave, which
resembles a detached arch of the Thames Tunnel. The Brigand Chieftain
tries a sentence or two of entreaty, in which the words “Lovely tyrant,
won’t yer consent?” were the most seductive that we happened to
catch; and as this gets nothing but a look of what the fair one called
“unutterable scorn,” with the usual number of surplus r-fºr-rs in the
syllables where that effective liquid occurs, the Brigand, dispirited at
such clear “contempt of Court,” tries a threat, and rushes off to the
wing (where he was met by a woman with a pint, mug and a slice of
bread-and-butter) to give time for the “aughty fair one’” to think it
| over. The process of cogitation can hardly have commenced, when
the Brigand's Wife makes her appearance, sees her husband's Captive,
whom in a fit of jealousy she is about to despatch with a blue wooden
dagger, when, looking at the Captive's arm, a mark—possibly that of a
strawberry, or a port wine stain—induces, the Brigandess to “old er
infanticidal 'and,” with an exclamation of “My º child;” when
with a tremendous bound she makes off, dragging the fair Captive after
her. Anxious to release the maiden in the sarcenet body from a “villain's
fangs,” which would assuredly have torn her muslin mittens, the
Brigand’s Wife plunges her wooden poignard into the shirt-front of
the Brigand, and a §: sounding without, brings up the usual quan-
tity of sheeting in the shape of a ghost, who has one peculiarity of a
pleasing nature, for as nobody has been killed but the Brigand, the
Ghost can be nobody's ghost, and nobody's feelings can be lacerated by
the shade coming to throw a shade over º future existence. .
We have left ourselves no room to speak of the usual intermezzo in
the shape of a comic song. We forbear to speak of the Pantomime—
. we recognised the brigand's caye in that of Despair; and we
recollect our old friend the “abode of bliss,” as last year’s “realms
of light and loveliness.” - -
Seriously speaking, we are afraid that the Fair has lost all its humour
while retaining nearl, alofits objectionable qualities. The “Fun of the
Fair” has degenerated into a child's scratcher and tin trumpet; while
dancing and drinking, interspersed with pocket-picking, gambling, and
quarrelling are as much in the ascendant as ever. e are averse to
anythin like a curtailment of the amusements of the people properly
so called, but Greenwich Fair has ceased to be much more than the
opportunity to the viciously disposed, the temptation to the waverer
on the threshold of crime, and the harvest to the pickpocket.
THE NEW MANIA.
THE Railway Madness has º jº and the country is
enjoying perhaps a lucid interval, but we already see symptoms of the
late delusion being followed by a Mining Insanity. The public seldom
remains in the position of the Ghost in Hamlet, who, we all know, had
“no Speculation” in his eye; but when Speculation gets into the public
eye, the profit is too often just about, as much as will go into its eye,
which, though causing blindness for the time, ends in the Patient seeing
none the worse for it. Mining is now the rage, and we are expecting
every day to see the announcement of the formation of a Company for
“Developing the Mining Resources of the Minories.”

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ARTIST LIFE IN LONDON.
It used to be considered that no position was so easily gained, no
commercial station so readily attained, no trade so speedily learnt, as
that of a coal merchant. Any man with brass enough to put a plate on
a door, and leave a little over for his individual use in the way of
business, was at once qualified to deal in all the products of the
Mining districts, from “LAMBTON's best Screened” to “HETToN's
Wallsend.” . .
Like everything else that is too easy of acquisition, the coal trade has
been so fearfully overdone, that the merchants have given themselves
the sack by retirement from the fºe. and the
rofession of an Artist, or rather of a Portrait
ainter, seems to be the pis aller of gentlemen with
nothing to do, and no means of *i. The
capital required is scarcely more than that which
was necessary for starting in the coal line, and any
one who has got a sheet of white cardboard, with a
lump of lamp-black, may elect himself at once into
the office of one of the “people's representatives”
charged with the artistical duty of representing
them. We regret, for the sake of the e Arts,
to hear that the price of a Portrait, showing hu-
º its blackest colours, and familiarly known
as “this style,”, has fallen from One Shilling to
One Penny, which says little for the prosperit º
the numerous LELYs, SIR Joshuas, and LAwkENCEs, who abound in
the large and small thoroughfares of the Metropolis. -
We are rather surprised, at the * satisfaction of the public
with a style of art which bears out the -
old saying, that nobody—not, even a
certain person himself—is so black as
he is painted. There is, however, an
artist in Farringdon Street who draws
upon you for only a penny, and if, after
he has drawn, you do not accept, you
are at liberty to have your penny back
again.
If even this small consideration should,
on consideration, be regarded as exor-
bitant, there are severalingenious youths
who will take the portrait of any one
who does not care much about drawing
it very fine—in this style—for nothing.
SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR H.M.S. (HER MAJESTY'S
SENATOR) ROEBUCK.
(From Mr. Punch, First Lord, &c.)
You will proceed to Sheffield, when you will ship the Suffrages of the
Electors, and take on board as large a cargo of Popularity as you can
conveniently carry. You will then steer straight for St. Stephen's, and,
on arriving in the Parliamentary Latitudes, you will open, read, and act
upon the subjoined instructions:-
1. You will cruise in the Neutral Waters, between W. Gulf
and Opposition Point, taking care not to allow yourself to be drawn into
the former by the promises of the natives, and to keep a clear º
any occasion as tender to, H.M.S. the John Russell, as one
and the accompanying Squadron.
voyage to t
from the latter, though you may avail yourself, in any situation o
difficulty, of whatever assistance its inhabitants may offer.
2. You are particularly ordered not to sail in the wake of, or to act on
object of your
present employment is to keep an eye upon the movements of this ship,
- ſou may fire a shot into her, or any
of the Squadron now and then, if you see them going out of their course,
or º: unless it be absolutely unsafe to proceed on their
e Cape of Good Hope. You will also see that they waste
no powder in salutes and sham fights, as they have shown too much
disposition to do of late.
gº. will signal the Peel, and co-operate with that ship, if her Com-
mander find it necessary to take the John Russell in tow, as the latter is
crippled, and does not work so handily as was anticipated when she was
last put into commission.
4. You will look out for any vessels which you are led to suspect by
their rigs, and may board, search, and condemn any found with forbidden|.
or dangerous cargoes, taking care to fling overboard any humbug found
on board of them, *::::ii; Irish clap-traps, blowing up the vessels
themselves. . -
5...You will seize and grapple with all vessels in the Protective
service. It is probable most of these vessels will be found sailing under
the false colours of Native Industry; you are, notwithstanding, justified
in taking possession of such vessels if you can, and bringing them into
the haven of Common Sense. They are of very light draught, and may
be looked for, chiefly, in shallow water.
6. You will, on occasions, before firing, show the private º:
with which you are furnished, viz., No. 1, (Reason), above No. 2,
(Prejudice), and No. 3, (Humbug), at the peak; and No. 4, (Honesty),
at your main.
If these signals are not answered, youmay fire into the ship signalled,
whatever her build, rig, or colours.
Your ship has been selected for the above duties from her quick
sailing, combined with the sharpness, precision, truth of aim, and tº:
effect of her fire, as shown in previous partial actions and cuttings out,
and the First Lord fully anticipates that your conduct in the ensuing
cruise will justify his choice of Hiš. Roebuck for this arduous
Service. -
ST. PAUL’S TWOPENCE.
From SIRTHoMAs LAwRENCE, St. Paul's, to QUEEN ANNE, at
MADAME Tussaud's.
“MADAM,<-Having, in my lifetime, enjoyed the distinguished patron-
age of George the THIRD, GEORGE THE Fourth, and the º: the
Royal Family, together with the #." of foreign potentates, and
ministers, Itake the liberty of addressing, your Majesty on a subject
that, as one of the objects shown for a shilling, I incline to hope must
interest your benevolence-seeing that it affects the interests of very
iº. soldiers, sailors, bishops, and authors, exhibited for two-
pence. I allude, Madam, to the illustrious persons honoured with a
monument in St. Paul's Cathedral, and heretofore shown to an enlight-
ened British public for coppers.
“I, Madam, have no monument. All that is left of me is upon
canvas; therefore, it cannot be º that I have any personal
vanity to gratifyin this letter. Still, I have very acute feelings for the
lonely condition of my companions. The Easter holidays are now over,
and nobody has been to see us. Doctor Johnson declares that he
sees in such º a growing disrespect for the Established Church,
and consequently, the certain destruction of all our honoured Institu-
tions. How has business been with you? If bad, why then it is
lain we all suffer alike from the poverty of the times; if otherwise, it
is clear that our Church masters, must secure additional attraction
(besides that of the Monuments) to bring in the twopences.
“I remain your obedient Servant,
“Thomas LAwRENCE.”
QUEEN ANNE to SIR. Thomas LAwRENCE.
“SIR,-We have been tolerably busy in Baker Street. SIR CHARLEs
NAPIER has been a card, and Louis NAPOLEoN has more than made up
for the diminished attraction of GeoRGE HUDson. Altogether, we
have nothing to complain of. But then MADAME Tussaud marches
with the times. She always has an eye upon an adventurous President, a
popular assassin, or whatever may come up. (She is only waiting for
another authenticated appearance of the Sea-Serpent to produce him in
several volumes.) Now, your people really know nothing of the wants
of the age. They think they can go on with their old stock of monu-
ments—wholly forgetful of the growing attractions about them. Thou-
sands rush past St. Paul's to the Chinese Junk—thousands cross the
bridge to the Zoological Gardens—and thousands again visit Paris at
MR. BRADwell's Colosseum.
“Who will give twopence to look upon so many stones, when for
a shilling they may come to us? For my own part, I should advise
your people to hire aband of music, or to give up the concern alto-
ther. } music will not do, Hº a few fireworks let off from
Elson's monument, with MR. BRAHAM to sing º: Bay, might
move the twopences. If neither of these, I take it that, as prudent
tradesmen, }. people must, sooner or later, close their exhibition.
“Always having been a staunch supporter of the Church, I shall be
sorry to see St. Paul's in the Gazette,_but in these days people will
have their º for twopence, and there’s no saying more
upon the matter. Notwithstanding, I am

A National Blessing.
A writeR in the Nation newspaper invokes a blessing on the Sikhs
in the following extraordinary terms:-
“God prosper them, un-christian as they are, for they are brothers of ours in detes-
tation of Britain!"
Detestation of Britain is certainly an unchristian feeling, and the
writer in the Nation and his § no doubt, are brothers with all who
entertain it. We take the liberty of varying the Irish benediction, and
say, “Heaven mend them—unchristian as they are l’”

LIFE IS SHORT, BUT AMERICAN ART IS WERY LONG.
WHEN the two monster Mississippi rival exhibitions are finished, we propose that they be
bought up by some wealthy railway º (if there is such a thing now), and exhibited one on
each side of the line. Qf course, this does not apply to the Blackwall Railway, not so much
because it is not wealthy, as because the darkness of its ways will prevent either of the
#. being seen. The Greenwich, however, might do it, with an issue of fresh shares or
oubling the fares, and the dreary scenery of that railway, would be considerably improved by
the importation of an American river on each side of it; or, better still, suppose they bring in part
of the New Farringdon Street, which it seems the Čorporation have sworn, never to complete

or the dry rot, we hope MR. CHIsholm ANSTEY will purchase them, for they would be invaluable
to him to write his little amendments upon; and MR. FEARGus Q'CoNNOR may find them useful for
his next Chartist three-million-signature petition; and even MR. WAKLEY can turn, them to a

A NEW DIVISION OF HORSE.
AN Indian paper, speaking of the late war, says, “Part of SHARPE's horse has just arrived.”
Which part?. It is a complete toss-up whether it is head or tails? or was SHARPE's horse like
MUNCHAUSEN's, that ran ever, so far without its hind-quarters, which we always.looked upon as
a story too good to be believed º half.” However, on the principle that half a loaf is better
than nome, we suppose that half a horse is better than no horse. But we º: SHARPE will soon
find the missing part of his horse, and that he will take, better, measures to keep it together for
the future, or else part with it altogether; for a horse that is liable to fall off, or to be cut off, in
the rear, in the manner above suggested, is only fit for Astley's, to appear “in several pieces.”
Perhaps, however, it was found our cavalry did not compete in numbers with the enemy's, and so
this new division was hit upon in order to make every British horse equal to Sikhs.

gnonette box will yield a harvest of at least
two salad bowls. The Metropolitan Farmers
who cultivate the Radish in the ordinary
flower-pot, are calling out for more protection
against the cats, and we were present a few

for the purpose of throwing cold water on the |

SHAMEFUL - HOAX | | |
The “ INTERNATIONAL visit.” TURNs out to Be A MEETING or
CREDITORs 1'.'
HE. “International Visit * came off on

MAN passing his morning in Port Street

nothing better.
The Meeting was held on the quay
site the Custom House at Boulogne. Some
300 persons were present. The names of
the persons º: whom they wished to
rove debts did not transpire. Nothing is
nown of them further than that they are
residents of Boulogne, and have lodged
from time to time at the Hôtel D’Angle-
terre.
The Meeting was advertised for nine o'clock, but owing to a stormy
passage, the packet did not arrive till past ten. This want of punctuality
was loudly censured, but upon a distinguished Tailor of the metropolis
.# Maire, as he landed, that “it was the most miserable pas-
sage of his life,” not another murmur was uttered upon the subject.

The Creditors were received with the loudest hurrahs from the French

Qppºlately, and
spirits of the Meeting, the Sous-Prefect proposed to drown all recol-

instantly carried; and the Groseille d’honneur was offered to every one
who was lucky enough to find a glass.
The sympathetic sponge-cake, also,
devoured. In a voice gushing wit

the Maire then called upon every

The Meeting was opened by a number of umbrellas, for a shower,
which was called “smart,” though it did not seem to have that effect
on any of the travellers, nº sooner came down than it was the signal of
every parapluie rising. This somewhat obscured the effect of the
scene, and blinded the eyes of several of the Creditors, who were pre-
vented from taking those observations which might forward, the object,
or perhaps more than one object, of the Meeting, off to England.
It was at this critical pause, that several persons in the crowd were
observed to steal away. Perhaps the pang of facing old friends, to
whom they felt they owed so much, and to whom they had made such a
r return, was more than they could endure; doubtlessly they were
Fº of being carried away by their feelings, and thought it better to
o where they would be in safety: but it was very clear that no sooner
the creditors landed, than the Meeting was considerably thinner.
The moment the principal heads of the Deputation, were under
gover, the Sous-Prefect advanced to the Triumphal Arch which had
been prepared for the Chairman, and º as he pointed to the
quantity of green about it, that they would always keep that in their
eyes as a memento of their glorious visit. He trusted, they would
turn their visit to good account; but he would not detain them any
longer in the rain, for he could plainly see they had been upset by
their voyage, and so he would conclude with the fond hope that their
debts might be better collected than their idols.
The Maire next addressed the Meeting, and begged to remind the
rsons present, that it was he who gave his name to the town of
ulogne-sur-Mer. He had not anything further to say.

chairs, of the English. Deputation, pulled out a large ledger, and said
he would read over a few names, with the amounts for which they were
º indebted, of their largest debtors. He was to

We are not sorry that this Meeting of Creditors, has not repaid the
expectations, much less the debts, of those who embarked in it. It had
een pompously announced as an “International” visit between
England and France. Now this, Internationality was completely "a
mºckery, a delusion, and a snare.” The “mockery” has fallén, luckily,
only, upon those who originated it; the "delusion” has been prac-
tised ". the French; and we are rejoiced that the poor English resi-
dents have escaped the “smare” that was laid for them. The next
time a body of Creditors come in the name of England to visit France,
we º # will be received, not by the National Guard, but by a
body of bailiffs.
The best way of looking at this, “International” visit is certainly to
call it a Shameful Hoax of a double-barrelled mature, for it fires two
ways, and has injured two parties. It has been a Shameful Hoax upon
those who lent themselves to it, for in their greatest vanity they never
could have *: they were the representatives of º and it
has been a still more Shameful Hoax upon the French, who put
themselves to the expense of º them with all the honours
and compliments which one nation feels a pleasure in paying to
another.
We really think some apology is due to the French authorities for
the cruel way in which they have been taken in, and we call upon
LoRD BRough AM, who came in the first boat, and witnessed the arrival
of the second, to make it.

THAT’s THE TIME-or-Day.
We understand that the author of Who’s Who? is preparing a new
º ’s
go thro this stupendous task, beginning with the letter A, when,
upon º round, it was discovered that the Meeting had quietly
dispersed. None but the National Guard had had the courage to
reulalil.
As the rain and the disappointment had considerably damped the
workin one large volume, under the º title o What?
Considering how often promises have been held out by some parties, to
let other parties know What’s What? the publication alluded to must
be looked for with considerable interest.

Hoice of friends, my dear

upon which every
man about town

as he should be care-
ful. And as example,

and at the risk even
of appearing some-

to suffer . the im-
prudent selection of
a friend. Attend
then, my dear BoB,
to “the History of RAssELAs, Prince of Abyssinia.”
Sir, –In the year 1810, I was a jolly young Bachelor as you are now
(indeed, it was three years before I married your poordear Aunt); I had a
lace in the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office; I had Chambers in Pump
ourt, au troisième, and led a not uncomfortable life there. I was a free

had an entertainment in Chambers. As I learned presently that MR.
BLUDYER had been educated at Oxford, and heard that his elder
brother was a gentleman of good estate and reputation in his county,
I could have no objection to make his acquaintance, and accepted y
his invitation to meet a large game-pie which he had brought with him
from the country, and I recollect Ilent my own silver tea-pot, which
figured handsomely on the occasion. It is the same one which I pre-
sented to you, when you took possession of your present apartments.
MR. BLUDYER was a sporting man: it was the custom in those days
with many, gentlemen to dress as much like coachmen as possible; in
top-boots, huge white coats with capes, Belcher neckerchiefs, and the
e adornments; and at the tables of bachelors of the very first fashio
you would meet with prize-fighters and jockeys, and hear a great d
about the prize-ring, the cock-pit, and the odds. I remember my LORD
TILBURY was present at this breakfast, (who afterwards lamentably broke
is neck in a steeple-chase, by which the noble º extinct),
and for some time I confounded his Lordship with, Dutch SAM, who
was also of the party, and, indeed, not unlike the noble Wiscount in dress
and manner.
My acquaintance with MR. BLUDYER º: into a sort of friendship.
He was perfectly good-natured, and not ill-bred; and his jovial spirits
and roaring stories amused a man who, though always of a peaceful turn,
had no dislike to cheerful companions. ‘We used to dine together about at
coffee-houses, for Clubs were scarcely invented in those days, except for
the aristocracy; and, in fine, were very intimate. BLUDYER, a brave and
athletic man, would often give a loose to his spirits of an evening, and
mill a Charley or two, as the phrase then, was. The
those days thought it was no harm to spend a night in the watch-house,
and I assure you it has accommodated a deal of good company, Autres
temps, autres maeurs. In our own days, my good Bob, a station-house
bench is not the bed for a gentleman. -
I was at this time (and deservedly so, for I had been very kind to
her, and my elder brother, your father, neglected her considerably) the
favourite nephew of your Grand-Aunt, my Aunt, MRs. GENERAL MAC
Yº...? who was left a very handsome fortune by the General, and
to whom I do not scruple to confess I paid every attention to which her

habits who had a large jointure. Your father used to say I was a sneak,
but he was then a boisterous young Squire; and perhaps we were not
particularly good friends.
Well, Sir; my dear Aunt, MRs. GENERAL MAC WHIRTER, made me
her chief confidant. I regulated her, money matters for her, and
acted with her bankers and lawyers; and as she always spoke of your
father as a reprobate, I had º reason to suppose I should inherit
the property, the main part of which has now passed to another
branch of the RRowNs. do not grudge it, Bob : I do not grudge it.
{}. family is large; and I have enough from my poor dear departed
e.
Now it so happened, that in June 1811-I recollect the Comet was
blazing furiously at the time, and MRs. Mac Winter was of opinion
that the world was at an end—MR. BLUDYER, who was having his
Chambers in Pump Court painted, asked permission to occupy mine,
where he wished to give a lunch to some people whom he was desirous
to entertain. Thinking no harm, of course I said yes; and I went to
my desk at the Tape and Sealing:Wax Office, at my usual hour, giving
instructions to my boy to make MR. BLUDYER's friends comfortable. ,
As ill luck would have it, on that accursed Friday, MRs. MAC
will WHIRTER, who had never been up my staircase before in her life (for
your dear Grand-Aunt was large in person, and the apoplexy, which
carried her off soon after, menaced her always), having some very par-
ticular business with her solicitors in Middle Temple ane, and being
anxious to consult me about, a mortgage, actually mounted my stairs,
and opened the door on which she saw written the name of MR.
Thomas BRowN. She was a peculiar woman, I have said, attached to
glaring colours in her dress, and from her lº. in india, seldom
without a set of costly Birds of Paradise in her bonnet, and a splendid
Cashmere shawl. -
Fancy her astonishment then, on entering, my apartments at three
o'clock in the afternoon, to be assailed in the first place by a stro
smell of tobacco-smoke which pervaded the passage, and by a wild an
ferocious bull-dog which flew at her on entering my sitting-room!
This ºf Sir, doubtless attracted by the brilliant colours of her
costume, seized upon her, and pinned her down, screaming, so that her
voice drowned that of BLUDYER himself, who was sitting on the table,
bellowing “A Southerly Wind and a Cloudy º proclaim a hunting
Morning”—or some such ribald trash: and the brutal owner of the
dog (who was no other than the famous Mulatto boxer, NoFRoy, called
the “Black Prince” in the odious language of the Fancy) and who was
inebriated doubtless at the moment, encouraged his dog in the assault
. º defenceless lady, and laughed at the agonies which she
endured. l
MR. BLUDYER, the black man, and one or two more, were arranging
a fight on Moulsey Hurst, when my poor Aunt made her appearance
among these vulgar wretches. Alºft. it was but three o’clock, they
had sent for gin-and-water to a neighbouring tavern, and the glasses
sparkled on the board, to use a verse from a Bacc n song which
well remember MR. BLUDYER used to yell forth—when I myself
arrived from my Office at my usual hour, half-past three. The black
fellow, and §§. CAPTAIN CAvenDISH of the Guards, were the
smokers; and it appears, that at first all the gentlemen screamed with
laughter; some of them called my Aunt an “old girl:”, and it was not
until she had nearly fainted, that the filthy Mulatto, called the dog off
from the flounce of her yellow gown of which he had hold.
When this poor victim of vulgarity asked with a scream—where was
her nephew'? ... new roars of laughter broke out from the coarse gin;
drinkers. “It’s the old woman whom he goes to Meeting with,” cried
out BLUDYER. “Come away, boys;” and he led his brutalised crew
out of my Chambers into his own, where they finished, no doubt, their
arrangements about the fight.
Sir, when I came home at my usual hour of half-past three, I found
MRs. MAC WHIRTER in hysterics, upon my sofa–the pipes were lying
about—the tin dish covers—the cold kidneys—the tavern cruet-stands,
and wretched remnants of the orgy were in disorder on the table-cloth,
stained with beer. Seeing her fainting, I wildly bade my boy to open
the window, and seizing a glass of water which was on the table, I pre-
...;º to her lips.-It was gin-and-water, which I proffered to that
r lady.
She started up with a scream, which terrified me as I upset the
glass: and with empurpled features and a voice quivering and j
with anger, she vowed she would never forgive me. . In vain I pleade
that I was ignorant of the whole of these disgraceful transactions.

was in waiting in Middle Temple Lane, and to which I followed her with

Etymology of Connaught.
SIR. Rob Rat PEEL's project for the plantation of Connaught, which
we trust will turn out to be no mere political plant, has drawn attention
to that unfortunate district, and among other things, to the etymology
of the name of the province. Some say that Connaught is of Celtic
origin; but in our opinion it is merely a corruption of the plain honest
Saxon Can-naught, which pithily expresses the inability of its inhabitants
to help themselves.

A LETTER from San Francisco (quoted in a New Orleans paper)
says:-
“Some of the most ugly and slovenly servants here marry. A woman who comes here

If the tooth happen to be a double one, has the woman a doublein-

THE COOK AND THE TURKEYS.
Respectfully dedicated to the Irish Members who met Lond JoHN
Russell, on Wednesday week.,
At Mans, once on a time, resided
A worthy, who his cares divided -
Twixt Turkey, Goose, and Capon breeding,
And Turkey, Goose, and Capon feeding, .
Up to that state of o'er-crammed craw,
To which the gourmet owes foie gras.
And not content with thus deranging
His feathered nurslings' animal economy,
This DRouet of the Poultry-yard, exchanging
The breeder for the artist in gastronomy,
Would cook his family, and serve 'em up
To friends invited, or to dine or sup:
And thus, like MR. Hunson, he combined
Rather incongruous functions, ever willing
To aidin doing brown the geese, you'd find
That he had just before throat-high been filling."

Some Saint’s, or Somebody's, or Something's fºe—
In fact, to celebrate I don't know -
Andp'raps, you'll think it not worthwhile to seek;
Only, one thing I know, that it was not
The annivers’ry of La République-
Whate'er the cause, resolved to give a dinner,
Which, but that Friday luckily was past,
Had tempted any Saint to break his fast,
§. fall to º y º: * :
go vely to his Poultry-yard,
Long º hand, the wicket he unbarred,
And, bowing to the Turkeys, Geese, and Hens,
Who cackled anxiously from out their pens,
Thus, with French courtesy the fowls addressed:
“Messieurs les Dindons, Oies, Chapons, Poulets,
As twelve of you will be served up to-day,
Pray tellime how you would prefer being drest?
I will retire, while you consult at leisure,
And in due time convey to me your pleasure.”
A moment round the pens from bird to bird,
A cackle of deliberation stirred,
Tillan old Turkey ponderously hobbled
As spokesman fowl from out his cramming-stall,
And this response pathetically gobbled—
* Please, Sir, we’d rather not be drest at all.”
“Nay,” quoth the man, “I’ll wait here within call,
While you employ some minutes in reflection;
But for objecting to be drest at all,
That, really, is quite wandering from the question.”
STEAM. ENGINES FOR THE WAISTCOAT POCKET.
THE Scottish Agricultural Gazette gives an account of what it calls
“Portable Steam Engines.” We cannot see that a man would get on
any the quicker in this world for carrying a Steam Engine about with
him. Supposing he managed to stow it away in his hat, or tied it to
the sole of his t; it would be of no earthly assistance to hi
umless he contrived to carry also in one of his pockets a portable coal-
cellar, and even then he would require a portable railway for his
portable Steam Engine to travel u We have not much faith in
these “Portable” inventions, for they generally turn out after a trial,
to be insupportable. We recollect an instance of an emigrant taking out
with him a “Portable House.” When he put it together, the building was
topsy-turvy. By some accident the floors were all wrongly numbered,
and there was the kitchen up in the cock-loft, and the garrets down on
the ground, where the pig-styes should have been....We should be
afraid of a similar mishap occurring with this, “Portable. Steam
Engine.” It would not be agreeable to be sent the height of Albert
House, simply because you had put the boiler in the wrong place.
We would much sooner carry such an Engine, than it should carry us.
After all, we suspect this new “Portable” invention is nothing better
than the littlebrass Steam Engines which we see, with wool to imitate
the smoke, sold in Leicester Square for a penny a-piece.
No “worse REMAINs BEHIND.”
Why should CHARLEs ALBERT be the last manto aska friend to take
soup with him? Do you give it up?
Because he has lost his Tureen (Turin). (Ed. Police! Police!)

THE SEA SERPENT IN A FOG.
(By a Contributor half-seas over.)
“DEAR Mr. Punch,--ALLow me to add, through the medium of your
valuable columns, my own testimony to that of the many highly respectable
F. who have vouched for the actual existence of the Sea Serpent.
am an inhabitant of Cheapside, Sir, and engaged in mercantile pursuits,
which, I hope, will furnish an excuse for any mistake that I may make
in the use of nautical terms. On Monday evening last I was returning
from Herne Bay in the City of Canterbury Steamer, having just j
past 6 P.M., and three sheets in the wind. On looking over the stern part
of the vessel, sight hazy, and a strong South-wester blowing the smoke
from my cigar right in my face, I discerned along floating object, which
appeared to be following the vessel at the distance of about eight feet.
About two yards of the head and neck of the animal, if animal it were,
appeared above water; the tail, or what I took for it, was beneath the
surface, and may have extended a quarter of a mile, or, indeed, to any
distance. I was instantly impressed with the belief, which Istill retain
that the creature was no other than the veritable Sea Serpent. Alli
know is, that it very closely resembled the likeness of the nondescript
which appeared last week but one in the Illustrated. News, as the sub-
joined sketch of it, made by an artist on board, will prove; although
when I iº. my impression respecting it to the steersman, he
observed (if I recollect rightly) that he considered it rather—indeed, I
think he said very—like a whale.
“Yours, BowbelL.”
A REGULAR PALMERSTON.
A DISPATCH was addressed to LoRD PALMERSTON from the Danish
Government. It was a Dispatch—one that asked to be dispatched in
undiplomatic double quick time. It came on the 26th of March; it
authorised LoRD PALMERSTON to make an offer to the Prussian
Minister; and, failing an answer, announced that the first (cannon) ball
should be given on the 29th. Three days for a diplomatic arrangement!
It was like trying to put BANVARD's Panorama into a Portfolio.
The note was mislaid. Serve it right. It did not come through “the
regular channel;” and such accidents will teach people to stick to
“the regular channel;” the line of which is staked out with the
Downing Street post and rail of official sealing-wax and red tape.
LoRD PALMERSTON only sent the note to the Prussian Minister on
the 29th, the day for which the War was positively announced, and the
Danes receiving no answer, kept their promise—not liking to be treated
with something that looked like disdain.
LoRD PALMERSTON's excuse is capital and characteristic. . The
“accident” did take place. It was not that Prussia wouldn’t deign an
answer, or that PALMERston wouldn't answer a Dame. It was all
along of the irregularity of “the channel.” But, says PALMERSTON
#. pick-toothishly, it really makes no matter. Prussia would
ave declined the proposal had it reached her in time, and the War
... ** .# exactly as it did, had the Dispatch been delivered
On
Possibly' But suppose the proposal had been accepted? LoRD
PALMERston knew nothing of the contents of the Dispatch. The
Danish note, like RoßERT-Houdin's Portfolio, might have had a dove
inside of it, with an olive branch in its beak; and the poor bird would
have been smothered, and the Elbe blockaded, and the on taken,
and the noble Christian the Eighth blown up, which is ble
and Loºp. PALMERston himself blown up, which is less serious—all
along of those three days' mislaying.
Literature in America.
The New York correspondent of the Daily News, declares that
MAcAulay’s History has been re-published in four different shapes,
and is in every one's hand.” Hereupon the correspondent rejoices,
saying:-
“We cannot be a very stupid people when we prize SHAKSPEARE next to the Bible,
and know MACAULAY “like a book.’”
Thieves are not very stupid thieves, when they invariably lay their
hands upon moveables of tº: value. By the way, the Cincinnati
Times, says that Powers, the great sculptor, is “now engaged on
America, a national statue:” and then , “we are not at liberty to
describe the statue.” Punch, however, is bound by no such restraint. The
4.ºriº, ; the intellectual genius of the country, is this—
...The Colossal Figure of an American Bookseller, Picking the Pocket of an
lish Author.” The innocence of the actis furtherset forth in dove-
coloured marble.

PREMATURE DECEASE OF ANOTHER BILL.
THE poor little Turnpike Trusts Bill, which had painfully struggled
§§ its first stage of infancy, thanks to the skilful nursing of
MR. G. C. Lewis, expired on Wednesday se’nnight, without any signs
of regret being shown by its unnatural parent, SIR GEORGE GREY.
He even seemed to take a fiendish pleasure in pointing out the universal
dislike his poor infant had inspired, and cheerfully said as much as that
he had never expected it to survive the Session. -
LoRD, John Russell’s family of Ministers seem to be getting
hardened against all natural feeling, by the great mortality among their
little Bills, which seems due, in a great measure, to the carelessness or
feebleness of their parents and nurses.
It is hardly expected, by those who are best informed, that the
Navigation Bill will get through its next reading. And it is confidently
asserted, that even if it do, it cannot survive a removal to the House
of Lords, to which the poor thing will of course be sent; although the
air of the place is certain to be prejudicial to the unhappy Bill, and will
probably be fatal to it. If Load John and his Ministerial family cannot
rear their legislative offspring, they might at least have the decency to
t on mourning for *. and look decorously melancholy as they
ollow them to their long home under the table.
“HE's saved, HE’s saved'."
Just before the adjournment of the Rate in Aid Debate, CoLonEL
DUNNE startled the House, by saying, “Gentlemen, I am in the hands
of the Irish Members.” An involuntary groan issued from every one-
business was suspended—and the Colonel was given up as irretrievably
lost; for it was too well known that the Irish Members never get any-
thing into their hands in Parliament, but the result is sure to be fatal,
and nothing is ever seen of it afterwards. By some strange accident,
however, the Colonel escaped, for he was “out of hand” the following
evening, and was warmly congratulated by all his friends. We will be
bound several of the Irish Members wish they could escape as easily,
as often as they find themselves in the hands of a Dunne.
The Rate in Aid.
WHEN LORD JoHN RUssell attempted to ascertain the wishes of
the Irish Members, and get the benefit of their advice, they showed, a
disposition to begin rating him, though having a strong objection to be
rated themselves. It was assuredly a very bold idea to think of getting
an opinion out of a body of Irishmen, and the feat of looking for a needle
in *. of hay would be simple indeed in comparison with such an
achievement. The Premier required an opinion of them, but it was
impossible to have any opinion of them—in their political capacity—for
it was quite evident they had no opinion of themselves.

MURDER. MODELS.–GTBBET TRIPS.
RT steps in as handmaiden to Murder. The
benignant ingenuity of one MR. John
St. QUENTIN, of Norwich, has executed
models of Stanfield Hall and Potash Farm
(on the scale of . of an inch to the foot,)
for the gratification of the sight-seers
and loungers of intellectual, benevolent
London. Thus, the memory of the atro-
cities of the fiend Rush may be agree-
ably preserved even among fashionable
parties until the end of the season. There
was at one time a great notion put
abroad; namely, to remove the house of
SHAKSPEARE in its entirety, and º it
across the Atlantic. Could Stanfield Hall
and Potash Farm have been by any means
t to the vicinity of London, there
is little doubt that the spirit of the day
would have made them a most profitable
investment, adapted and laid out as
tavern, tap, tea-gardens. However,
this was not to be done; so, let us thank
MR. St. QUENTIN for what he has con-
trived to achieve. Failing to fill our enthusiasm with the Hall and
Farm as they stand, it is something to have them at the reduced
scale of 3 of an inch. If we cannot, with one generous draught
assuage our thirst of knowledge, it is still something that we . try
to quench it in sips. , And then imagination will help us mightily.
§. the public mind § of an inch, and it will not fail to take a
Oot.
Thus, it really forms one of the attractions of the day-makes one of
the moral duties of the sight-seer to himself—to have “an hour wit
Rush.” To have the inquiring mind of a fraction of the enlightened
British Public instructed in the passages of Stanfield Hall—the passages
that lead to murder—to contemplate the ingenuity so “striking,” in
Potash Farm; an ingenuity that has converted a homestead into a sort
of family rat-trap. "Here,” says showman ST. QUENTIN–“here the
murderer slept; and here slept EMILY SANDFORD’–(and here the pious,
gentle hearted English lady who has paid her shilling for the show, looks
impatiently onwards to the Hall.) “And here,” says the showman, “is
where the murderer entered. Here is where MR. JERMY fell, and here,
MR. J.ERMY, Jun. Here is where MRs. JERMy rushed from the room,
and where the heroic ELIZA CHESTNEY followed. Here’—and the con-
tempt of the showman hisses from between his teeth, “here is where
the butler fled; the trembling coward who forsook his master!”
And—the Murder Models described—the lad º (before intending
to visit other shows) think Pompeii slow, and the Diorama abore... Now
there is an odour and a smack of blood about the Murder Models that
must sweetly recommend them to the senses.
As this Exhibition has met with such distinguished patronage, we
hear it is the grateful intention of MR. ST. QUENTIN to aim at continued
encouragement. We know not whether we are premature in our state-
ment, but we understand that the showman is in treaty with the
Dutch Dwarf WAN TROMP to represent the assassin RusH–(MR.NATHAN
has taken measure for the dress—fac-simile of the original)– and
after due rehearsals he will set out from the Farm, taking the various
º: until he reaches the interior of the Hall; his whole progress to
be accompanied by music descriptive of the demoniacal, passions g
in his breast. . This improvement on the present exhibition will, there
is little doubt, have great attractions for a discerning Public, tyrannously
denied the enjoyment of contemporary murder represented on the
stage, as in the good old times when THURTELL was personified at the
Surrey, and the Gig of the Murdered WEAR was hired, nightly, by
an enterprising management, regardless of expense. This sort of moral
teaching by stage example, being refused by the mealy-mouthedness of
a present Chamberlain, if is a great comfort to us, as free and enlight-
ened Britons, to know if the §. Cut be denied a scene of homicide—
why Regent Street may delight in Murder Models. If the low folks of
St. º: Fields an iambeth may not behold Rusm upon the stage,
—why, the superior classes may patronise the Model of his Farm at the
West End. Ladies, 'twixt the mercer's and the confectioner's, may
now step in and see a little murder—take just a preliminary taste of
horrors before the cheesecake.
And with MR. ST. QUENTIN as the master of the ceremonies to
murder—the patronised Showman, of Farm and Hall—we think it a
little too, hard upon the “Managing Body of the Eastern Counties
Railway,” desirous of setting afoot a Railway Gibbet Trip, that they
should be rebuked for their very natural wish in these times to turn a
shilling. MR. St. QUENTIN shows only Models of the houses made
fearful and classical by Rush; now, the Eastern Counties folks
showed their fellow-countrymen the body of RusH himself—the body
alive-convulsed–and killed ! Surely, this offering was a dram of
knowledge from its burning source, not qualified and weakened for
the nerves of fine ladies and families. Hanging being a great moral
lesson, the Eastern Counties Directors only seconded the wisdom of the
legislature by conveying students to the place of instruction—a grand
amphitheatre, whence thousands of scholars might study the holiness of
life in the convulsed anatomy of a strangled man. The object was
—we were duly informed—“visible to a great distance.” And no
doubt, for short-sighted scholars, there were, for a consideration

cl -
Well, the majesty of the law—its “round” of majesty being the
black cap—has been solemnly vindicated of late. Within these past six
weeks, six human creatures—men and women—have been put to death
to sanctify the cause of life. MR. CALCRAFT, the 3. in truth
been awfully busy. The lasting good that must come of his ministration
-the improved respect for human blood that must arise from his
killing—will, we trust, be made manifest. Nevertheless, somehow, his
work ever seems to make more work. Some electric chain, linking
man and the fiend, seems ever and anon charged from the atmosphere
of the gallows.
. At least, within the last six weeks, we have given rope enough. Six
times, at least, in the name of the holiness of life, has the hangman
uenched the gift of God. “Begentle towards all men,” says MR.
ALCRAFT, and then he pulls the bolt that drops a man into the death-
struggle. This is st , practical teaching! And the monster, in the
dock,-he, the abhorred of all men, is made the participator of the
common fate of all—the meekest and most righteous!
How many a gentle, good man, consummated the holiness of his
mortal end, on Saturday last, Norwich bell then beating twelve! . At
the hour that the very righteousness of death was, in our opinion,
dºſed by being made the punishment of a fiend in the esh of
a man .
We must incline to think that justice would be better served—life
more truly reverenced—were JAMEs, BLoWFIELD RUSH at this hour,
hung with chains, and doomed to sharpest slavery for the remainder
of his days ºrather than killed, in reverence of human existence,
and flung into prison earth, to be devoured by unslacked lime.
Nevertheless, from amid the very terror with which a Christian press
has surrounded our daily walks,—with which it has charged our moral
atmosphere, we trust to gather immunity for the future. How horribly
ºt have the dead walls of London become within the past fort-
night ! ... “Blood”—“blood”—“killing”—“killing,” has cried to us
from all sides, men in their affected virtue pharisaically, trading on the
blasphemy, they denounced. This cannot be borne—will not be borne.
Qutraged human nature will rise and vehemently protest against a repe-
tition of the cause of these trading horrors—against these money-changers
for blood and brutalisation.
STREET PUNCTUATION.
NotwitHSTANDING the virtual failure of the project of the Fometic
Nuz, or Fonetic Nuts, the j of which has proved too difficult
to be accomplished, we understand that an attempt is to be made to
introduce a new system of Punctuation, on the principle of street stop-
pers, or street . - -
This will enable the publishers of School-books to bring out an
Illustrated Work on Punctuation, in which a comma may be represented
by an unaccomma-dating cabman, who, by refusing to move on, occa-
sions a slight pause in the progress of traffic ;, while a coal-waggon at a
stand-still, would be very fairly emblematical of a coſa)-lon or semi-
co(a)-lon, as the case maybe. An advertising van, would convey a good
idea of a point, a dead stand-still, or full stop. Notes of admiration could
easily be shown by the astonished foot-passengers; notes of exclamation
by #. Omnibus-drivers in full cry at the impediment; and notes of
interrogation, by º inquiring why the drivers do not move on.
We trust that our Fonetic Contemporary will be prepared to fratermise
with us in the promulgation of an idea so worthy of being coupled with
its own.
SYMPTOM'S OF AN EARLY WINTER.
WE think we shall have a very tº." this year, as we have had
cold º to give chilblains to the Cove of Cork, and to lay up the
Buoy at the Nore with rheumatism all his life. The whole earth has
been tucked up under a thick counterpane of snow. , The Statues, very
wisely, have been wearing their customary white paletots, and Nelson
followed the example of St. Paul's, and put on a nightcap to keep the
cold out of his head; George the Fourth, sported a new great coat,
which was frieze all over, but we thought His Majesty looked a little
pinched in it.

CERTAIN of Mr. Punch's contemporaries are in the habit of comparing
PEEL to JUDAs and to JULIAN the Apostate, but Punch is of opinion
that the personage whom the Right Honourable Baronet, now that he
has become a Reformer, most resembles, is JULIUS CAESAR...When our
Celtic predecessors were running about in a state of semi-nudity, without
any other coat on than a coat of blue paint, CAESAR, by ºf on these
shores the Roman Standard—which, as an emblem of enlightenment,
was much superior to the modern English Journal of that name—was
the first to introduce civilisation and clothes among the barbarous
Britons. But for him, Britannia never would have ruled the waves, and
her sons would be still as blue and as brutish as their ancestors.
like manner, we have PEEL about to invade Ireland, not to lay lands
waste, but to fertilise waste lands, to reclaim bogs, send bog-trotters
literally : "...i and elevate the Sons of Erin from that pitiable and
disgraceful condition, described in so many enormous blue-books, and
also in the national ballad of Brian O'Lynn. Punch, therefore, holds that

very strong similitude to CAEsAR—for he must not say MR.C.ESAR–land.
ing in Britain. To complete the resemblance, PEEL only wants a counter-
part to the Centurion of the the Tenth Legion, and in order to supply |
the deficiency, Mr. Punch hereby engages himself, as a substitute for
that celebrated volunteer, to plunge, spade in hand, into the Irish
Channel, and rush forward to plant that symbol of cultivation in the soil
of Connaught.
A MUTE INGLORIOUS MILLER.
Y this time it is well known that MEYERBEER,
about whose opera of The Prophet the whole
of, the musical world is now rapturously
talking, had the score in his Portfolio for
“fifteen, long years;” and as he doubtless
never allowed such a valuable treasure to
É. out of his hands, the opera must have
een rather more plague than prophet to him,
until its recent triumphant production, in
Paris. This “reluctant amorous delay” in
sending a favourite child into the wide world,
is a common feeling among men of genius;
for we know an instance within our own
experience of a celebrated “wag” who has
- been walking about for the last twenty years
with a new pun in his card-case, having determined not to let it off,
until he finds himself at a jº worthy of the occasion.
The pun is said by the privileged few who have been allowed, a peep
at the manuscript, to be remarkable for its freshness, point, and finish.
It is somewhat heavy and elaborate in its details, and is written for
five persons, each of whom has a massive solo leading up to the pun
itself, which is in fact an ensemble for two voices—realising the happy,
º quite novel effect of the pun having been made “in two
aces
The author has frequently been invited to produce his pet work at
some of the first dinner-tables, both in England, and on the Continent;
but, like MEYER-BEER—the greatest of beers in contradistinction
from the vast tribe of small beers—he has invariably declined to give the
product of his genius to the world, until the world, seems, thoroughly
ripe for the reception of so cherished a treasure. Who can blame him?
Can you, Reader? Imagination—acting as your solicitor, and putting
in an answer for you—replies emphatically, “No l”
Too BAD AT ANY RATE–The worst Rate in Aid we know, is the

THE SOIL AND THE SHOP.
. THERE is to be a tremendous re-action against Free-Trade. The follow-
ing are only a few of the Resolutions to be submitted by an Illustrious
Duke to a large Meeting of tenant Farmers to be held at Cambridge:-
. “That all men in trade being dependent upon the men of the land, it
is the bounden duty of the sons of the soil, at this awful crisis, to grind
the noses of all shopkeepers.
“Whereupon, Huet no Farmer buy a new coat, but patch his old one,
until he shall be able to appear as Harlequin. -
. . Let no Farmer buy a pair of leathern shoes, while there shall remain
in his fields a stump of British Qak that may yield him wooden ones.
“Let no Farmer buy a hat, whilst in his stye or stable there is straw
sufficient to make him a far better beaver. -
“Let no Farmer permit, his wife or daughters to purchase silken
shawls or cotton gowns, whilst he has upon his land'honest English
* ready and willing to contribute flannel petticoats!
“Let no Farmer drink foreign tea, whilst upon his native hedges there
grows the tonic blackthorn.
“And finally—Let no English Farmer encourage the production of the
foreigner, . by paying away gold from Africa, or silver from Mexico- |
whilst he is able to make use of an honest English stamp, impressed on
English paper made from English rags, issued #. an English Somerset
House; and, it may be, in due season, to be finally proceeded upon by
an English officer, authorised by an English Sheriff, to find for the op:

Rather Electrifying.
A. MoRNING Gritic, talking of the new ballet, Electra, says, "We

THE CALIFORNIAN FEWER.
THE º Mania seems to be still upon the increase, if we are
to judge by the hold that it has taken on our minds and manners, for
even our Amusements and our Arts have got the tinge, and assumed the
couleur locale—of California. The Drama, whose book was supposed to
have fallen into the “sere and yellow leaf,” has at length to boast of a
truly golden page, in the form of a Grand Spectacle, called the White
Maiden of California. The plot comprises a Ship, with a sentimental
Captain, who is bewailing his “lost Amelia,” in the midst of a storm, when
Ben. Somebody rushes into the cabin with the awful announcement that a
“white squall” has “thrown the jibboom athwart the hawser,”
“dowsed the binnacle,” “driven the companion into the back-yard of
the mainmast,” and performed other mischievous pranks, that none but
a Stage seaman .*describe, and none but an amateur of the nautical
drama, could appreciate. The sentimental Captain goes into a fresh
outbreak of grief about his “lost Amelia,” and rushes to secure his child,
who skips artlessly into his open arms, while he directs the faithful Ben
to take the necessary steps for working the ship in the awful emergency.
Ben is only away a minute, when he returns with a wild shriek that the
craft “has sprung a leak,” and in order to save the child, she is strapped
on to a horse which has been taken on board by the Captain in one of
his sentimentalfits, because the horse reminded him of his “lost Amelia.”
By a lucky stage accident, all parties are saved, and cast ashore on the
Gold Coast, where we find a vindictive “Native” in love with the now
adult child, and the author happily invests him with a fit of conscience,
for the purpose of troubling him with a dream, in the form of one of the
mºst effective tableaur ever presented within the walls of even this estab-
lishment. The stage is one mass of ghosts, enveloped in what the
Bills might fairly proclaim to be
Several hundred yards of Sheeting,
and realising the idea, rather, of Cali-co-fornia, than of California alone.
We have said that this gold region and its pursuits have tinged our
Arts as well as our Amusements, and in the annexed illustration of the
last new toy, we find a Californian tone, applied to that in which Art and
Amusement are both combined.
PRIMEVAL INNOCENCE.
It is usual among Club Committees to solicit gifts of books from
Members and others, and the appeal is usually addressed to those
“who happen to have Duplicates in their libraries.” Our old and valued
-though not very valuable-friend, MR. DuNup, having caught sight of
this circular, determined, with his well-known zeal for the promotion of
Literature, to do his best towards its advancement, though he has had
so little success in 8.; the advancement of himself. He accord-
ingly wrote to the Committee of every Club in London in the following
terms:-
“Mº., DuNUF presents his compliments to the Committee of the
- Club, and having seen an invitation to send books, addressed to
those who have Duplicates in their library, begs to inform the Com:
mittee that his, MR. DuNur's, library, consists of nothing but Duplicates,
which he will be happy to present to the Committee on the understand.
ing that the Duplicates shall be presented at the various Pawnbrokers,
and the books to which they relateredeemed from the funds of the Club
to which the Duplicates are presented.”
DARKNESS MADE VISIBLE.
MR. Dawson has been lecturing at the Whittin Club upon
“Things not seen.” As a matter of course, he included the pictures in
the Vernon Gallery.
OUR INDIAN ACHIEVEMENTS.
Such is the mutability of human affairs, as well as of public opinion,
that LoRD Gough, who was only the other day a discomfited imbecile
whom it was necessary to supersede, is now a victorious and skilfu
General, whom it, is fair to honour. We confess we are much more
delighted to meet him in his new character of the Goojerat Game-cock,
than as the Muff of Mooltan, as that many-headed, though sometimes
ſº the Public, had a month ago regarded him.
The veteran “come out” in fine style, on the last occasion, and the
Gallant NAPIER will find on his arrival, that instead of having any
opportunity to “come out,” he will be found to have “come out” most
unnecessarily, and he will be at fiberty to return by the first boat,
uss, or camel that happens to be going homewards.
We have been much amused by the amiable anxiety shown by the
veteran Gough, to get into his dispatches a word or two of praise for
every one concerned, however lightly, in the late victory. He succeeds
in giving every Regiment a little bit of laudation, though it is sometimes
rather difficult to find a pretext for doing so, in those cases where the
ſº of war prevented certain troops from taking a prominent part in
e action.
For example, although, the 14th Light, Dragoons had none of the
º he compliments them on having shown “a determined front,”
which he adds, “completely overawed the enemy, and contributed much
to the success of the day.” This cannot be taken asyery compliment
to the looks of the 14th Light Dragoons, who, it is intimated, had such
a very forbidding aspect, that the enemy was overawed at the sight of
such very “ugly customers.” . . - ---
We see no very unusual merit in their having exhibited a “determined
front,” for it is not the custom of the British troops to present anything
but their front to the enemy. A Regiment which can help to win a
battle by such means should have such a nobleman as the EARL or
STAIR at its head, and under such command would succeed in putting
the foe completely out of countenance. Perhaps there was something
mesmeric in the gaze of the 14th Light Dragoons, which may have put
the Sikhs into a state of Sikhses and Sevens; but at all events, there
was clearly something in the eye of the 14th, which served to bring the
foe under the lash of conquest.
Angels' Visits.
It is with the greatest *. we notice that the Secretary to the
mmissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt paid a visit last
week to the CHANCELLQR of THE Exchequen. There must be some-
thing wonderful at the bottom of this visit. A new Era is probably to
take place in English History—a whole year is about to pass without
any increase of our dear National Debt. The papers will be rejoicing
with the following announcement:-
“The Chancellon of THE Exchequer begs to state he has received from the Com-
missioners for the Reduction of the National Debt the sum of 3d, which he has carried
to the proper fund for lightening the burdens of the country.”
Some discontented persons may snarl at the smallness of the above
amount, but we, who recollect that we are in the third year of a Whig
Ministry, cannot sufficiently express our astonishment at the largeness
of the sum. But the ingratitude of some people surpasses all belief!
We really believe if the odd shillings and pence were to be taken off the
National Debt, there are wretches who still would find cause of
complaint'
A Very Fine Chancery Suit for its Age:
THE Chancery Suit of “The Attorney-GENERAL v. TºnyELYAN” is
now 164 years of age | The King sent for old PARR to look at him, on
account of his extraordinary, age. We wonder the QUEEN has never
thought of sending for this Chancery Suit from the same motive. One
º and sixty-four is a goodstout º for a º: long-lived
as Chancery Suits proverbially are. The Qldest Inhabitant must be a
baby compared to it. Depend upon it, it will be presented at the next
Levee by Lord CoTTENHAM, who will enlarge upon its hale longevity,
and assure HER MAJESTY that this old Chancery, Suit, far from dying,
has a good hundred years before it yet. By-the-bye, it is very curious
that no quack has ever thought of starting a “CHANCERY PHL.” ...We
are sure it would be a rapid fortune. A box taken every Term time,
would insure old age, far beyond that of WIDDIcomb. In fact, we
doubt if a person would ever die at all.
LOOKS AWKWARD.
THE worst “Paper” in the market just now is that issued in
Downing Street, endorsed by Lond John Russell, and accepted by
Nobody. These bills seem always either at a discount in the Commons,
or under Protest in the Lords. With such symptoms we should not
think Lord John Russell had long torun, whatever his bills may have.

OMETIMES the spirit of AEsop wakes and discourses
even in a dressing-room of an Opera House. The
glorious old Phrygian, on sufficient occasion, dis-
dains not the atmosphere of paint and spangles;
but talks wisdom through his old instruments—
addresses himself, with the olden eloquence of the
olden day, to the youth and beauty flourishing and
beaming in the reign of gentle QUEEN VICTORIA.
Hence, when once again JENNY LIND prepared to
tread with silver foot the slippery stage—when
she renounced the very serious thoughts that for
a while tied her, as with sad-coloured silken
cords, to a porphyry column of Exeter Hall—
when MR. BALFE prepared to serve out lumps
of rosim to his orchestra—(rosin wept from the
Balm of Gilead fir, towering to the heavens from

Majesty’s own temple—alighting like a long-lost
truant dove to gladden the bosoms of thousands and
thousands—when, in a word, JENNY LIND again
resolved to wear stage-paint, no longer deeming
such rouge a scarlet abomination,-then did Æsor
make his way from the shades, and after the manner
of illustrious ghosts returning to the world invisible,
entered unseen, unknown to all save to his fast
friend Punch, the dressing-room of JENNY LIND;
and when there, AEsop took within his august
hand JENNY’s Hare's-foot: the foot that touches
with carnation the sweet good face of the “ young-
eyed” songstress: the foot that lays the naughty
play-house paint upon the cheek that awhile had
grown so chill and contemplative in the aisles
of all unworldly Norwich. And immediately,
touched by the hand, breathed upon by the
breath, of Æsop, the Hare's-foot became even as
vital as when it scattered the diamond dew and
pressed the violet. And with this life, came
the power of speech vouchsafed by the willing
lips of AEsop.

JOHN MINISTER, MY JO.
John MINISTER, my jo, John, when we were first acquaint,
Ye were a bold Reformer, on liberal measures bent;
But now, ye’re growing cold, John, ye’re getting slack and slow;
I wonder what has come to ye, John MINISTER, my jo.
JoHN MINISTER, my jo, John, are you indeed the same
That went too fast at one time for STANLEY and for GRAHAM
Whilst now for CoLoREL SIBTHORP scarce fast enough you go :
Ah! ye’re not what ye used to be, John MINISTER, my jo.
JoHN MINIsTER, my jo, John, ye're tamed, I know not how;
Appropriation Clauses ye don't bring forward now;
Extension of the Suffrage ye scruple to bestow;
Ye stick upon Finality, John MINISTER, my jo.
JoHN MINISTER, my jo, John, be what you were of yore;
Resume the path of progress, and I’ll ne'er twit you more;
Assistance I will give you, and favour I will show,
And you shall be my own LoRD JoHN, John MINISTER, my jo.

And both have had to struggle with very stormy weather;
And I have §: ahead, John, but you have crept below,

HOW TO GET UP A LYING-IN INSTITUTION.
|
| TAKE the Court Guide, the Blue Book, or any other equally exalted
authority, and select from it some of the best names ... found, but
in doing so it may be as well to choose a very old edition, for if some of
the parties are deceased it will be rather an advantage than otherwise.
Hit Qn a name sounding as nearly as possible like some charity that
already, is or ought to be in existence, and issue your prospectuses,
having taken care to provide yourself with a good bold brass plate-
there is nothing to be done without being bold and brazen—on which
the title of #. Institution will be engraved. If your capital or credit
will allow of your adding a wire-blind for the window, the arrangement
will be advantageous, for wire in this shape is very well adapted as a snare
for charitable birds of passage. Having completed these preliminaries,
send out as many collectors as you can trust, . carefully avoid sending
any person who, may consider himself a separate. Institution to be
supported by voluntary contributions, and who might, therefore, be
tempted to appropriate the donations to his own use.
THE SMITHFIELD PROMENADE.
HAVING heard much of the delightful º: afforded by Smith-
field Market, we determined to judge for ourselves, and accordingly
made our way, a few mornings ago, to that locality, so much in favour
with certain civic pedestrians. The principal walk is obstructed on
one side with a
row of * and
the other side
bristleswithhorns,
not altogether out
of keeping with
pens, inasmuch as
they remind us of
“Quills upon the fret-
ful porcupine.”
There is, undoubt-
edly, a bucolic
air pervading the
place, the only ob-
jection being, that
there is a iiile too
much of it. The
space for the pro-
menaders is rather
contracted, and it
isfrequentſ neces-
sary to take the
bull by the horns
and turn the head
of the animalaside,
in order to prevent
the bull taking the
promenader by
those unpleasant
iº -
he low lowing
of the cattle makes
pleasant music
enough, if it were
at a convenient
distance; but the
horn accompani-
ment renders the
affair somewhat
di eable, par-
#. as the
bulls, as they re-
pose their heads
on the bars, seem
to be taking a few
bars’ rest prelimi;
nary to a rapid
movement in the
time of a gallop.
Perhaps the ad-
mirers of Smith-
field as a prome-
- - - - - - made may be in
some degree tempted by the softness it offers to the feet; but when it
is remembered by what materials this softness is produced, there does
not appear any § great reason for congratulating the promenaders on
the taste exhibited.
Nonsense that is quite Refreshing.
A MoRNING .. speaking of the meeting at the Royal Society;
says, “the refreshments were of the most recherché, description.”
What does this mean? Does it prºtºld to say that the negus and
biscuits were very much run after for that a person had to look a long
time before he could find the cup of tea and muffins which he was
dying, for P. Recherché refreshments must be something new. GUNTER
robably will be advertising “Des Glaces très distinguées,” or pushing
is “Méringues ertrèmement comme il faut.” But we suppose a recherhé
supper means one at which it is the most difficult thing to find any-
thing to eat, after the ladies have retired, and the bread and cheese has
to be brought in! The English language is getting so Frenchified,
that we expect soon Bell’s Life will be written in French !
A LIVING SEPULCHRE.
THE cruelty with which MR. VERNoN's pictures have been treated is
even greater than it appears to be on first thoughts. The Paintin
entombed in the vaults of the National Gallery include many of the works
of living Artists: so that not only has Art been buried, but buried alive.

PLEASURES OF HOUSEKEEPING, THE LOOSE SLATE.
THE NATIONAL SPOKESMAN
To LORD GOUGH AND His
ARMY.
PUNCH hereby begs to present
his thanks to Lord Gough, and
the officers and soldiers of the
British army in India, for the
brilliant victory which they had
the good fortune to gain the
other day at Goojerat; and Punch,
by these presents, extols his Lord-
ship and his troops to the skies. A
few weeks unch sent LoRD
Gough his dismissal, which Mr.
Punch is now glad did not arrive
in time to prevent the triumph
for which he is thus thankful.
Having violently abused Loºp
Gough for losing the day at Chi-
lianwallah, Punch outrageously
glorifies him for winning the fight
at Goojerat. When Loºp Gough
met with a reverse, Punch set him
down for an incompetent octo-
genarian; now that he has been
fortunate, Punch believes him to
be a gallant veteran; for Mr.
Punch, like many other people, of
courselooksmerely toresults; and
takes as his only criterion of merit,
success:-the test of the
excellence of his own super-emi-
ment periodical.

horrible dearth of the raw mate.

an apparent opportunity for, a
oke turns out to be unavailable.
wo years ago the appearance of
ALBONI was a boonto }. unhappy
punsters, who, in consequence of
the stoutness of the lady, were
able to declare that AL-BONI was
not All Bony; but an instance has
just occurred in which the pun-
sters have been fearfully discom-
fitted. The moment PARoni was
announced as a pupil of PASTA,
the whole of the metropolitan
withings were writhing in all the
agonies of a pent-up joke to assert
that the débutante was a Parody
of PASTA. Unfortunately for
them the event has frustrated the
intentions of the punsters, and
the triumphant success of the
singer has rendered impracticable
the long concerted, but now dis-
concerted pun, which has mise-
rably missed fire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TWO PICTURES.
This,
I saw god MAMMON sit upon a throne
Of Gold bags, piled on human brain and bone,
And Good Intentions formed the pavement stone.
All Arts and Sciences, and Gifts and Powers,
The comeliest graces of this world of ours,
Poured forth their offerings to the god in showers.
Painting about his knees ea potos hung;
Music, his dull ear tickling, harped and Sung;
Fancy beneath his feet her garlands flung;
Rich meats, voluptuous dances, luscious wine,
Made the air faint about the gorgeous shrine,
In which I saw the bloated god recline.
Before him, bowing to the golden ground,
His great High priest, with iron circlet crowned,
Chaunting the god, swung a rich censer round;
Whence wealth’s fat incense wreathed about the crowd,
All-aged, unsexed, high, low, the poor, the proud,
That through this worldwide palace buzzed and bowed:
A sea of eyes, that one expression keep;
A floor of knees, that to one altar creep;
A world of souls, sunk in one worship deep!
Weiled in his #. haze of rich delight,
MAMMON, as hidden from their humbler sight,
Did to that High-priest delegate his might;
And so they Nº. the Gold god in him,
Straining on his hard face their eye-balls dim,
Touching his garment’s hem, or censer's rim,
Piling up golden pieces at his feet,
Licking from his foul hands th’ uncleanness sweet,_
Peer from the palace, outcast from the street—
Snuffing the vapours from his censer rolled,
Of lies and cheats, and baseness manifold,
Sublimate in elixir rare of Gold.
And that High-priest, of nature coarse and strong,
Haughtily looking on the slavish throng,
Deemed that his god was great, his tenure long.
A SUGGESTION FOR SONG-WRITERS.
Songs are becoming desperately
and despicably colloquial, In a
milk-and-water, insipid, indeed
imbecile way. You shall have a
young lady, asking, through four
namby-pamby verses, “Will you
love me then as now?” and a
young gentleman answering
through, an equal number. o
equally lºad uatrains,
“Dearest, then I’ll love you
more.” Now, it is deplorable to
see a young fellow of sense an
º: with a character and calling
of his own, mewling and trilling
such silly sentimentality. We
want a different sort of thing alto-
ether. Notthat we should rush
into the gipsy, bravo, smuggling,
iratical, lawless, boots-and-belt-
uckle sort of style either. This
is as detestable an º as
the other, and in a business-like,
practical country, even more out
of §:
should not songs, also,
come home to men’s “businesses
and bosoms?’” Why should not doctors, lawyers, merchants, and stock-
brokers have their -
“appropriate” airs, and appropriate words too?
Think how much more decent and characteristic a performance it
would be for a junior barrister, still in the patent-leather boot and
drawing-room stage of his profession, if sentenced to the piano, instead
That.
I looked again—short time had passed away;
That temple-roof gaped and let in the #.
The Gold had fallen from the shards of clay;
For MAMMON graced no more that empty shrine,
And vanished with the god were show and shine,
The garlands withered in the vapid wine,
The offerings of all Arts mildewed with blight;
Only the throne remained, in naked plight,
Its grim supports all visible to sight.
The devotees, that lately worshipped there,
Had left the mighty temple blank and bare,
And howled without, aghast and in despair.
Before the º the High-priest, late so bold,
Cowered, while rude hands, from out his censer cold,
The vile contents up to the crowd did hold.
The Golden Essence, volatile, had flown;
The naked lies, and cheats, and frauds, were shown,
Each ushered to the light with yell and groan.
With face, of late all smiles, now set in frown,
Qne rent from head to foot his purple down,
One dashed from off his brows the iron crown-
While he, protesting idly, cried, “O friends,
What have I done that asketh such amends?
god was common, common were our ends.
“I dealt with MAMMON roundly, blunt, and bold,
Dazzled your eyes, made drunk your hearts with Gold,
Did what you would, lied, cheated, bought, and sold.
“The god is gone from all—from me as you;
Leave me but free, the worship to renew.--
O MAMMON-servers, what is this you do?”
But, still, they howled against him, more and more;
When sudden I could hear a far-off roar—
“Lo, the god MAMMON 1-brighter than before,
“Beyond two oceans, see, where he descends!
Leave here this trickster—follow thither, friends !”—
So the crowd fled—I waked—my vision ends.

LETTER ON THE ELOQUENCE OF GRATTAN.
To H. Grattan, Esq., M.P.
My good SIR,--I don't know whether or not your speeches afford
any gratification to your constituents; but I can assure you they give a
great deal to mine; who derive nearly as much amusement from them
as they do from my Qwn brilliant pages. However, I assure you that I
do not envy you the laughter which you occasion; for I know that you
excite it involuntarily, and because you cannot help it. I mention this
lesſ you should think I had some sinister motive in the advice which
am about to offer you; and which you shall have after I have first stated
my reasons for offering it. During your oration the other night upon
the Irish Relief question, you are reported to have observed, in reference |
to a state of things in your own country, that “the ancients did honour
- dogs to tear in pieces, and the
vultures to pluck out their eyes.” Can it, Mr. GRATTAN, be necessary for
me to remind you that there are no vultures in Ireland except middlemen
and attornies, who do not pluck out the eyes of the dead, but pick the
ockets of the living? You are also represented as having accused SIR
oBERT PEEL of wishing to drive the }. people to Connaught or to
another place, which you specified in plaim terms, not, however, calling it
the House of Lords, though you used a directexpression quite as unparlia-
mentary. Now, Sir, in order to the correction of your rhetoric, and the
amendment of your taste, and your avoidance for the future of such
mistakes in both respects as the above, I would recommend you to dis-
continue parliamentary speaking for a short time, and apply to a re-
spectable teacher of elocution. You might give the House a specimen
of your improved style after the usual number of lessons, and then
perhaps your oratory would be divested of blunders and adapted to the
organisation of ears polite. ... Think, my good Sir, on this disinterested
suggestion from your friendly monitor

A DELIGHTED NOBLEMAN.
IN the course of a debate in the Lords', on Friday night last LORD
CAMPBELL gave utterance to the following burst of natural feeling OIl
the affecting subject of the pleasures of infancy:-
d “ He (Lond CAMPBELL) had seen his own children ride in a dog-cart with great
elight.'
How interesting is this glimpse which we get at the délissemens of
the active Statesman, the retired lawyer, and the biographer of the
Lord Chancellors - -
We fancy we can see the noble Lord surveying, with ecstatic pleasure,
a dog-cart full of his little ones, and contemplating the performances of
that faithful friend of man—our old friend, your old friend, and every-
body’s old friend—the dog, in an equestrian º The Bishop of
Oxford failed to sympathise in the parental satisfaction of LORD
CAMPBELL, and expressed a wish to see all dog-carts put down,
“because the soft foot of the dog was not fitted to drag heavy loads
over hard roads.” - - -
This seems rather hard upon LORD CAMPBELL, and is perhaps giving
his children an undue weight; for though the father himself has no
doubt a more than average preponderance in the social scale, we do not
see why the progeny of the Peer should be supposed to be too heavy
for the social dog-cart. LoRD CAMPBELL might very, fairly have
answered the Bishop of Oxford's imputation upon juveniles indulging
in such rides as those in question, by furnishing a list of the ages and
weights of the riders, when it would no doubt have turned out that
the sport was neither infra dig. nor the burden º: dog, which means
in a liberal translation—“More than the dog could carry.”
PUNCTUATION AND STEAM.
WE perceive by the Times that the MEssRs. WIGRAM have, built, for
the Spanish Government a very fine º called the Colon;
which circumstance we mention, not for the purpose of pulling
MEssRs. WIGRAM, but for that of expressing a doubt if the vessel will
be much of a “clipper;” as the Colon is the next thing to a full stop.
THE LORDS s”AMUSENT.
THE papers are continually advertising the fact of a gentleman who
goes about giving Lectures on, “Things Not Seen.” We shºuld recºm;
mend this ingenious individual to turn his attention to “Things No.
Heard,” which would form an admirable subject for a series, of
Lectures; and would at all eyents include nearly half the, speeches
in the House of Lords, which fairly rank among things inaudible.

approval, and drink of the malt purchased by that ingenuous Scot

WELLINGTON, and to inquire of his Grace what remedy he proposes
to apply to the misdirected energies of the Household Foot Guards; who,
for want of something better to do, rob servant-maids and appal clergy.

able—perhaps better able—to govern the army than Mr. P.; nevertheless
he º: to submit that there are spots in India where the Household Foot
Guards might--as sons of glory-haply perspire away “i’ the imminent

in Lambeth, and other home places. Some of them might haply fill a
soldier's grave, and so be altogether cleansed; grave-dust being held
“the true fuller's earth, taking out all stains.”
Qr Punch presents another set of º to F. M. the DUKE;
and if it be not held expedient to ship the Foot Guards—(in their case
with very *::: pieces of Napierian soap)—to wash themselves in the
Hydaspes; that then every individual of the aforesaid force should be

take care of themselves and their pockets accordingly. Moreover, such
medals, suspended round the neck of certain sentinels, might operate as
a beneficial warning º timid or short-sighted country clergymen.
And further, Punch presents his final compliments to F. M. the
DUKE OF WELLINGTON, and respectfully suggests that appropriate
colours should be presented to the regiments whose members have

opportunity to wish F.M. the DUKE OF WELLINGTON many happy
returns of Tuesday last, the first of May, and the anniversary of the
first day of F. M. Punch doubts not, if rustic annals were referred to,
it would be found that on the 1st of May, 1769, there was a p ous
shoot of laurels throughout the empire—a greater shoot, than, any

SMALL SHOT FIRED BY A FIVE-POUNDER:
OR, WHAT I SAW IN FRANCE DURING MY RECENT
ExCURSION.
I saw several stormy discussions in the National Assembly, and felt
quite proud that our House of Commons was so far superior to it in
gentlemanly demeanour. -
I saw one representative of the people publicly strike another, and
thought to myself, “Well, if our Members do occasionally fight a duel
at all events they never descend to blows l’” and I felt still more proud
for St. Stephen's.
I saw long poles decked out with faded ribbons, and dead Immortelles,
which I was told were “Trees of Liberty,’” but I never should have
guessed it. A day or two afterwards I saw some of these long poles
ºut down, lying in the mud, and somehow I could not help reflecting
that ºth was, generally the fate in France with everything that was
popular.
saw the representatives and ministers caricatured in the farces
and vaudevilles, and was, rather astonished at the joyous manner in
#.º audience laughed at every little allusion to their dear
epublic.
saw several of the houses battered with shot, and still retainin
marks of the cannon, and no longer wondered that the French had suc
little affection for home, when they could scarcely call it, their own for
two days together. If a Frenchman's home, like an Englishman's, is
his castle, tfien, egad, it should be a fortified one. -
saw one man call on TINE, and this one man called himself
“an English deputation; and I burst Qut laughing when I read in his
eech something about “unanimity,” just as if it were a very difficult
#. for one man to be unanimous,
I saw in a shop, placed side by side, busts, of Louis-NAPOLEQN, the
DUKE of BoRDEAux, and the Count of PARIs, closely elbowing one
another, which struck me as rather curious; but not so much so as
the general absence, of every memento of Louis-PHILIPPE. Not a
portrait of anywhere, excepting a rare one, every, now and then,
on a five-franc piece; his very name seems to have left the Frenc
language. He might well without fear of contradiction, publish now,
à la Chateaubriand, his “Mémoires D'Outre-tombe.”
I saw the conscription going on in one of the country villages, and
witnessed a mother weeping over a gamin that had drawn an unlucky
number, whilst the young scamp was grinning.
I saw in Boulogne far more English than French.
I saw a Frenchman not admitted on the railway at one of the inter-
mediate stations because he had left his passport behind him.
I, saw several newspapers seized, and afterwards heard that the
Editors had been severely fined, which I thought was rather a free
manner of enforcing the Liberty of the Press; but then it must be
confessed that the Press in France, in return, takes liberties enough
without the smallest warrant. -
I also saw a Club closed, and a five-sous banquet dispersed, and a
crowd of six people ordered to “circuler,” and it was all done, strangely
enough, in the name of the Republic.
likewise saw (what I would much rather have not seen) women
addressing Political Nº. and they were answered and cheered on
º other women, who, I, thought, would have been much better em.
ployed at home mending their stockings, or nursing their babies; that
is to say, if French women ever do either; for I had no time to see.
ineſther saw nor heard the slightest allusion to Fraternité; but what
pleased me a great deal more was, that I saw all the public buildings
and exhibitions in Paris, without paying the smallest twopence for
ssion, and I thought, with shame, how different it was in my own
handsomely displayed in the Louvre, for I could not help asking mysel
in what miserable dark hole, or cupboard, or corner, or cellar, would this
same collection have been put, § it had been presented, like
MR. VERNoN's generous gift, to the English nation? How much better
tly manage these things in France!
saw the Public Galleries and Museums thrown open on the Sunday,
and really, for Iwatched most particularly, the people looked all the hap-
pier for it. Greater decorum could not have prevailed, and not an article
was broken... I thought of the British Museum, the . of Arts, the
National Gallery, and wondered why, we English, who profess, as other
nations profess, to be “the most civilised nation in the world.” do not
follow so beneficial, so º ..".
I saw a great deal more that pained and charmed me alternately, but
that which gave me by far the greatest pleasure was the y feeling,
and cordiality, shown us by every Frenchman wherever we went. It
was a great family . Good-nature greeted us everywhere, and
I, for myself, never could have believed that the French were one half
such fine, generous, jolly fellows, as, to myi. delight and enjoyment,
country. -
The same feeling coloured my cheeks when I saw the Standish .#
I found them. If it is for this discovery alone, I shall never regret the
£5I have spent in my excursion to Paris. Wivent les Français /

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SER-PENTINE MARSHES,
PUBLIc attention has been for sometime directed to the Serpentine
on account of the depth of its mud, which had been regarded as one of
those unfathomable mysteries, that no one was very much disposed to
get to the bottom of. - -
The bathers in the river had º something of the bathos in
which the question was involved; but they soon found themselves
going rather too deeply into it, and * of them felt that they had
very uncertain ground to rest upon. The inconvenience. of a mud;
bath had at last become so far recognised, that the authorities resolved
on removing the marshy matter from the river itself; but not knowing
what to do with the mud, they proceeded to spread it over Hyde Park,
where some of it has been spread so very thick, that the Pontine
Marshes themselves are not more dangerous than , the Ser-pentine
Marshes that have been formed by the deposits alluded to.
--
We are afraid that Hyde Park will comprise within its precincts a
species of Goodwin Sand, in which many a juvenile may be utterly lost
unless a Consolidation Act is immediately put in force, and rendere
binding upon the land, so that the public interests may be placed on a
firm footing. One day last week the figure-head of a little Skipper with
a skipping-rope was seen º: of distress, and was only rescued
from its perilous position by the Saucy Sarah, who had gone out as a
convoy, but had parted company in consequence of having fallen in with a
Man-of-War—belonging to the §. Barracks—and exc
salutes in the ordinary manner. Such accidents as these are likely to be of
frequent occurrence, for the small vessels are very numerous; and though
they are usually dispatched in tow of some larger craft, the iatter will
very soon induced to tack about, and be off after some of the Men-of-War
that are always visible in the offing.
MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
ON FRIENDSHiP.
THE other day I saw you walking by the Serpentine with young LoRD
Foozle, of the Windsor Heavies, who modded to all sort of suspicious
broughams on the ride, while you looked about (you know you did, you
#. for acquaintances—as much as to say—‘See here am I,
on Brown, of Pump Court, walking with a lord.”
My dear Boº, I own that to walk with a lord, and to be seen with
him, is a plºt thing. Every man of the middle class likes to know
persons of rank. If he says he don't—don't believe him. And I would
certainly wish that you should associate with your superiors rather than
your inferiors. There is no more dangerous or stupifying position for
a man in life than to be cock of a small society. It prevents his ideas
from growing: it renders him intolerably conceited. K twopenny half-
penny Caesar, a Brummagem dandy, a coterie philosopher or wit, is pretty
sure to be an ass; and, in fine, I set it down as a maxim that it is good
for a man to live where he can meet his betters, intellectual and social.
But if you fancy that getting into LoRD Foozle’s set will do you
good or advance...your prospects in life, my dear Bob, you are wofully
mistaken. The Windsor Heavies are a most gentlemanlike, well-made
and useful set of men. The conversation of such of them as ſhave had
the i. fortune to meet, has not certainly inspired me with a respect
for their intellectual qualities, nor is their life commonly of that kind
which rigid ascetics would pronounce blameless. Some of the young
men amongst them talk to the broughams, frequent the private boxes,
ance at the casinos; few read—many talk about horseflesh and the
odds after dinner, or relax with a little lansquenet or a little billiards
at PRATT's... .
My boy, it is not with the eye of a moralist that your venerable old
uncle examines these youths, but, rather of a natural philosopher, who
inspects them as he would any other phenomenon, or queer bird, or odd
fish, or fine flower. These fellows are like the flowers, and neither toil
mor spin, but are decked out in magnificent apparel; and for some wise
and useful purposes, no doubt...It is good that there should be honest,
handsome, hard living, hard-riding, stupid, young Windsor Heavies—
as that there should be polite young gentlemen in the Temple, or any
other variety of our genus.
And it is good that you should go from time to time to the Heavies'
mess, if they ask you; and know that worthy set of gentlemen. But
beware, OBOB, how you live with them. Remember that your lot in
life is to toil, and spin too—and calculate how much time it takes a
Heavy or a man of that condition to do nothing. Say, he dines at 8
o'clock, and spends seven hours after dinner in pleasure...Well, if he goes
to bed at 3 in the morning—that precious youth must have nine hours'
i...". bring him to 12 o'clock next day, when he will have a
headache probably, so that he can hardly be *::::: to dress, rally,

Park, and for a second toilette preparatory to dinner, &c. *-He goes
on in his routine of pleasure, this young Heavy, as you do in yours of
duty—one man in London is pretty, nearly as busy as another. The
º of young “Swells,” then, if you will permit me, the word, is
not for you. You must consider that you should not spend more than a
certain sum for your dinner—they need not. You wear a black coat
and they a shining cuirass and monstrous epaulets. Yours is the useful
part in life and theirs the splendid—though why speak farther on this
subject? Since the days of the Frog and the Bull, a desire to cope with
Bulls has been known to be fatal to Fro
And to know young noblemen and brilliant and notorious town bucks
and leaders of fashion, has this great disadvantage—that, if you talk
about them or are seen with them much, you offend all your friends of
middle life. It makes men angry to see their acquaintances better off
than they themselves are. If you live much with great people, others
will be sure to say that you area sneak. I have known JAGK JoLLIFF,
whose fun and spirits made him adored by the dandies (for they are
just such folks as you and I, only with not quite such good brains, and

by telling us that he had been dining with a Duke. We hadn't been to

courted him. I don’t know any means by which men hurt themselves
more in the estimation of their equals than this of talking of great folks.
A man may mean no harm by it—he 'g. of the grandees with whom
he lives, as you and I do of Joy Es or SMITH who give us dinners. But

Tufthunted down as the Tufthunter. -
I remember ºf at the jocular complaint made by one of this
sort, a friend, whom I shall call MAIN. After MAIN published his
“Travels in the Libyan Desert” four years ago, he became a literar
lion, and roared in many of the metropolitan salons. He is a -

natured fellow, never in the least puffed up by his literary success;
and always said that it would not last. , His greatest leonine quality,
however, is his appetite; and to behold him engaged on a Club joint,
or to see him make away with pounds of turbot, and plate after plate
of entrées, roasts and sweets, is indeed a remarkable sight, and refresh-
ing to those who, like to watch animals feeding. But since MAIN has
me out of, and other authors have come into, fashion—the poor
ellow comically grumbles. “That year of lionisation has ruined me.
TheJ." who used to ask me before, don't ask me any more. They
are afraid to invite me to Bloomsbury, because they fancy I am accus-
tomed to May Fair, and May Fair has long since taken up with a new
roarer—so that I am quite alone!” And thus he dines at the Club almost
every day at his own .. now, and attacks the joint. I do not
envy the man who comes after him to the haunch of mutton.
If Fate, then, my dear Bob, should bring you in contact with a lord
or two, eat their dinners, enjoy their company, but be mum about them
when you go away. … -
'º. though it is a hard and cruel thing to say, I would urge you,
my dear Bob, specially to beware of taking pleasant, fellows for your
friends. Choose a good disagreeable friend, if you be, wise—a surly,
steady, economical, rigid fellow. All jolly fellows, all delights of Club
smoking-rooms and billiard-rooms, all fellows who sing a capital song,
and the like, are sure to be, poor. As they are free with their own
money, so will they be with yours; and their very generosity and
goodness of disposition will, prevent them from having the means of
aying you back. ey lend their money to some other jolly fellows.
hey accommodate each other by putting their jolly names to the backs
of jolly bills. Gentlemen in Cursitor Street are on the look-out for
them. Their tradesmen ask for them, and find them not. Ah! BOB,
it’s hard times with a gentleman, when he has to walk round a street
for fear of meeting a creditor there, and for a man of courage, when he
can’t look a tailor in the face.
Eschew jolly fellows then, my boy, as the most dangerous and costly
of company; and apropos of bills—if I ever hear of your putting your
name to stamped paper—I will disown you, and cut you off with a
protested shilling.
know many men who say (whereby, I have my private opinion of
their own º that all poor people are dishonest: this is a hard
word, though more generally true than some folks suppose—but I fear
that all people much in debt are not honest. A man who has to wheedle
a tradesman is not going through a very honourable business in life—a
man with a bill becoming due to-morrow morning, and putting, a good
face on it in the Club, is perforce a hypocrite whilst he is talking to
you—a man who has to do any meanness about money I fear me is so
nearly like a rogue, that; it’s not much use calculating where the dif-|bulk
ference lies. Let us be *. gentle with our neighbours' failings; and
forgive our friends their debts, -
But the best thing of all to do with your debts is to F. them. Make
none; and don't live with people who do. Why, if I dine with a man
who is notoriously living beyond his means, I am a hypocrite certainly
myself, and I fear a bit of a rogue too. I try to make my host believe
that iſ believe him an homest fellow. I look his sham splendour in
the face without saying, “You are an impostor.”—Alas, Robert, I
have partaken of feasts where it seemed to me that the plate, the
viands, the wines, the servants and butlers, were all sham, like CIN-
DERELLA’s coach and footmen, and would turn into rats and mice, and
an old shoe or a cabbage staik, as soon as we were out of the house
and the clock struck 12.

SOCIALISM ON ITS LAST LEGS.
SocIALISM has been called “Society made Unsocial,” and certainly
Messieurs PIERRE LERoux, CoNSIDERANT, PROUDHoN, & Cº, have
tried their hands, and fists too sometimes, in bringing the definition
down to several degrees below the lowest level of society. Their
Socialism is a constant round of abuse, yaried with an occasional inter-
change of shots and blows, which, with a wonderful disinterestedness,
they seem to share most impartially in common, every one being eager to
give his neighbour fully as much, if not more, than he has received himself.
A Socialist is supposed never to “keep a rap to himself,” and he carries
this law into force by distributing, right and left, amongst his fellow-
creatures every rap he finds upon his hands. This system of “share
and share alike” is only a cloak—or rather a “wrap rascal”—for all
kinds of robberies; since it has been proved that those who invest their
money in Social schemes, in the hopes of dividing equally in common
bts, as we hope ourselves to be forgiven. Thi
with others, never get ºl. in other words, that Communism
means Nothing out of the Common. When hundreds combine to throw
everything they have into, what is called, “one pot,”, they may make
sure it will not be long in finding its way to that fatal destination, and
that it will never, be seen again, excepting by two or three who have
been appointed to keep the “pot boiling,” and who certainly do it to a
good stirring purpose, so long as there is anything left in it worth
making a stir about.
MonsLEUR CossID#RANT

there is a nursery song about
“Who killed Communism?”
the answer must be made in

mass, without and

you a few hints with regard to your bearing.
We are not so stiff at the Polyanthus as at some clubs I could name—
and a good deal of decent intimacy takes place amongst us.--Do not

that absurd dignity and swagger, which do not at all become your

nailed poor STYLEs up against a pillar, and is telling him what the

of Godjeratº , Indeed, I don't introduce you to JAwKINs, my poor
Bob ; he will do that for himself, and you will have quite enough of him,
before many days are over. -
. Those three gentlemen sitting on the sofa are from our beloved sister
island; they come here every day, and wait for the Honourable Member
for Ballinaſad, who is at present in the writing-room. -
I have remarked, in London, however, that every Irish gentleman is
accompanied by other Írish entlemen, who wait for him as here, or at
the corner of the street. These are waiting until the Honourable
Member for Ballinaſad, can get them three places, in the Excise, in the
Customs, and a little thing in the Post Office, no doubt. One of them
sends home a tremendous account of parties and politics here, which
appears in the Ballinaſad Banner. He knows everything. He has just
been closeted with PEEL, and can vouch for it that CLARNDON has been
sent for. He knows who wrote the famous º; “Ways and

which he writes in the Banner is a miracle to me! I hope he will get
that little thing in the Post Office soon.
This is the newspaper-room—enter the Porter with the evening
º a rush the men make for them! Do you want to see one?
ere is the Standard–nice article about, the Starling Club—very
pleasant, candid, gentleman-like notice-Club composed of cle €n,
atheists, authors, and artists. Their chief conversation is blasphemy:
they have statues of Socrates and MAHOMET on the centre-piece of
the dinner, table, take every opportunity of being disrespectful to
Moses, and a dignified clergyman always proposes the Glorious, Pious,
- emory of CoNFUCIUs. Grace is said backwards, and the
Catechism treated with the most irreverent ribaldry by the comic
authors and the general company.—Are these men to be allowed to
meet, and their horridorgies to continue? Have you had enough?—
let us go into the other rooms.
What a calm and pleasant seclusion the library presents after the
brawl and bustle of the newspaper-room. There is never any body here.
English ſº get * such a prodigious quantity of knowledge in
their early life, that they leave off reading soon after they begin to slave,
or neverlook at anything but a newspaper. How pleasant this room is, -
isn't it? with its sober draperies, and long calmlines of peaceful volumes
—nothing to interrupt the quiet—only the melody of HoRNER's nose
as he lies asleep upon one of the sofas. What is he reading P Hah,
“Pendennis,”—No. VII.-hum, let us pass on. Have you read “David
Copperfield,” by the way ?. How beautiful it is—how charmingly fresh
and simple! In those admirable touches of tender humour—and I should
call, humour, BoB, a mixture of love and wit—who can equal this great
genius? There are little words and phrases in his books which are like
- at a place it is to hold in the
affections of men! What an awful responsibility lº over a writer!
What man holding such a place, and knowing that his words go forth
to yast congregations of mankind, Ho grown folks—to their children,

And then, BoB, let the Record revile him—See, here’s HoRNER waking

This neighbouring room, which is almost as quiet as the library, is
the card-room, you see. There are always three or four devotees
assembled in it; and the lamps are scarcely ever out in this Temple of
Do not, however, be |Trum
pS.
I admire as I see them, my dear BoBBY, grave and silent at these
little green tables, not moved outwardly by grief or pleasure at losin
or winning, but calmly pursuing their game (as that pursuit is called,
which is in fact the most elaborate, science and study) at noon-day
entirely absorbed, and philosophically indifferent to the bustle and
turmoil of the enormous working-world without. , DISRAELI may
make his best speech; the Hungarians may march into Vienna; the
Protectionists come in ; Louis-PHILIPPE be restored; or the Thames
set on, fire; and Colonel, PAM, and MR. TRUMPINGTON, will never
leave their table, so engaging is their occupation at it. The turning
up of an ace is of more interest to them than all, the affairs of all the
world besides—and so they will go on until Death summons them, and
their last trump is played.
It is curious to think that a century ago almost, all gentlemen,
soldiers, statesmen, men of science and divines, passed hours at pla
every day; as our grandmothers did likewise. The poor old kings an
queens must feel the desertion now, and deplore the º: small
number of their worshippers, as compared to the myriads of faithful
subjects who served them in past times. -
I do not say that other folks' pursuits are much more or less futile;
but fancy, a life such as that of the Colonel—eight, or nine hours of
sleep, eight of trumps, and the rest for business, reading, exercise, and
domestic duty or affection (to be sure, he’s most likely a bachelor, so
that the latter offices do not occupy him much)—fancy such a life, and at
its conclusion at the age of seventy-five, the worthy gentleman being
able to say, I have spent twenty-five years of my existence turning up
trumps.
With TRUMPINGTON matters are different. Whist is a profession
with him, just as much as Law is yours. He makes the deepest study
of it—he makes every sacrifice to his pursuit; he may be fond of wine
and company, but he eschews both, to keep his head cool and play his
rubber. He is a man of very good parts, and was once well-read, as you
see by his conversation when he is away from the table, but he
gives up reading for play—and knows that to play well a man must play
every day. He makes three or four hundred a ãº by his Whist, and
well he may—with his brains, and half his industry, he could make a
large income at any other profession.
#. a game with these two gentlemen, the one who has been actually
seated at that card-table for a term as long as your whole life, the other
who is known as a consummate practitioner, do you think it is likely
you will come off a winner? The state of your fortune is your look-
out, not theirs. They are there at their post—like knights-ready to
meet all comers. If you choose to engage them, sit down. They will. |

not that I ever believe anything the newspapers utter—to have spoken
as follows:–

THE MYSTERIES OF MUSICAL CRITICISM.
A MoRNING Paper, talking of the new tenor, CALzoLARI, says, “his
portamento is admirable.” We know a little Italian, such as Us
poco–Bene trotato—Il Barbiere—Macaroni—non che malé, and such
|popular phrases, but we cannot possibly make out what *::::::::
means, unless by chance it is portmanteau. We have heard oftenors
who sing from the chest, and perhaps Signor CAIZolaki is a new kind
of tenor who sings from his portmanteau. If this is not the case, it
may º that the distinguished tenor was delayed on his º
from Italy, and did not arrive at Her Majesty’s Theatre until the º
moment, that his appearance, was required on the stage, when he rushe
before the audience in travelling costume, with the portmanteau on his
shoulder. In any event wearedelighted to hear that Signon:CALZolam’s
“portamento” was admirable, and only regret that the critic has
no mention, either of his “unmencionabili,” or his “paletoto di Nicolo.”
We hope they were remarkably “sostenuto.”
*TIS FOLLY TO BE WISE.
THE wisdom of our ancestors recommends that we should keep our
own counsel; yet we know how unprofitable and foolish it is to rush
impossible either to keep our own counsel, or assist our own counsel
materially in keeping himself. Some of the Railway Companies have
been keeping their own (standing) counsel at a magnificent rate, and
with what effect the condition of railway property will best show. In
spite of the ancient invocation which calls upon every body to keep his
own counsel, we are disposed to reject the idea, even although counsel
are getting so numerous that, unless every man keeps his own, before
long, the utter barrister will be reduced to utter destitution.

laws were repealed. Therefore it is clear that FreeTrade is ruining the

3rd Duke. My noble friend having proved that Free Trade is ruining
the country, I call upon you, Gentlemen, toformaleague for protecting
everybody and everything against everybody and everything. First,
you must restore the Corn-laws, to protect the ahem-tenant.

pair of unmentionables he manufactures? In short, every interest being
enriched at the expense of every other interest, it is clear that great
general good will be the result. Gentlemen, what makes the greatness
of England? Gentlemen, it is generally admitted to be abold peasantry,
their country's pride, and our wooden walls! Gentlemen, two and two

STRANGE ORIGINALITY.
THERE is an individual giving entertainments in London and the
provinces, who seeks to attract audiences by advertising himself as the
“ORIGINAL Bones.” One would think that he was a being formed
out of some fossil remains, for upon no other supposition can we account
for his laying claim to that originality of bone in which his hold upon
public patronage seems to consist. He surely cannot mean to assume
a peculiarity of osseous structure over all his fellow-creatures, or to con:
tend that upon a writ of inquiry into the respective merits of himself
and a rival, there ought to be a return of nulla bona in the case of his
competitor, and that the latter is not worth having any bones made
about him at all. -
We cannot comprehend why greater stress should be laid upon
original bones than upon original muscles, or original sinews, and
indeed the last of the three would . best iºi for insinewating
themselves into the favour of the public. We protest against the as-
sumption of any set of bones being more original than any other set of
bones, and we are averse to see any bones attempting to dislocate
themselves by getting out of their proper position.
Clerical Delinquency.
The other day we met with a paragraph in a newspaper, headed
“ALLEGED MURDER FOR THE SAKE of BURIAL FEEs.” The case
turned out to be that of a woman supposed to have poisoned her hus-
band and children in order to obtain funeral-money from a benefit club.
We expected to find the murder for the sake of burial fees was the
wholesale destruction of human life which is caused by intra-mural
interment.
NON-UBIQUITY OF COUNSEL.
CoNSIDERABLE inconvenience continues to be felt in the Courts of
aw, on account of the inability counsel feel themselves under, to
appear—like a favourite actor—in two pieces; or, in legal phraseology—
to effect a severance of their own bodies, and convert a corporation
sole into divided moieties of one individual.
The difficulty of catching a favourite counsel has extended even so
low as the Insolvent Court, where a single practitioner is attempting to
keep up a sort of professional monopolylogue: by running in and out of
the different tribunals, and by dropping a few sentences here, a remnant
of an argument there, and a little § of cross-examination in the third
tribunal, he manages to keep his triple practice going, to his own
profit, though at the loss of the public time, and to the detriment of
suitors. If this system is to be continued, it would be better to try
the effect, of legal ventriloquism, allowing the barrister to have a lay
figure of himself in each | the three Courts; and by placing himself
in a position commanding a view of the whole, he might distribute his
eloquence pretty fairly among his three representatives. Perhaps it
would be advisable to allow the favoured counsel a seat in the central
dome of a building containing several Courts, and from this exalted posi-
tion in his profession, he mightlookdown upon his less fortunate brethren,

MISS BENIMBLE'S TEA-AND-TOAST."
MISS B. EXPLAINS THE CAUSE OF HER LATE SILENCE.-REMOVES TO
EATON square.—SHAKSPEARE's HOUSE,--THE JEW BILL.-THE
STATE BALL.
ooD Mr. Punch, – It was
only two days after my
last—and when I was in
the hope of being sweetly
settled for the season—
that a Cornish baronet and
his family took my house
in St. James's, and, at a
minute's warning, I stood
with my box in the street.
But so it is . Folks in
high life have no more
thoughts of them as are
below 'em, than the eagles
in their areas have of the
mushrooms in the meads.
I felt this the more, as I
was getting so used to
Court life, that a Draw-
ing-Room and a Levee
were quite the necessaries
of my existence. And
now, I can only see 'em
'flected in the papers, and not through the windows of the carriages,
as, like a gold and satin snake of many colours, if I may borrow
MR. LovELACE's figure—they winded their §§ under my eyes to
the Palace of St. James's. I felt driven out of the hot monde, like m
respected first mother, Eve—if she will allow me to make so bold with
her—was driven out of Eden. So there was no help for it, but to wipe
my eyes, and—as just then there was no other house for me to look
after—to go and hide myself in my modest garret. -
Oh! Mr. Punch—to me, who’d been so long used to the § and
carving of the aristocracy—the whitewash of my own attic walls fell like
a blank upon my heart. I seemed wiped out of creation. Sitting in my
own empty room, it seemed as if I’d put off—what I’ve heard LovE-
LACE name—this mortal caul, and had nothing but my soul about me;
a shocking state as you must allow, for any person as respects the
comforts of life to be reduced to And this—after awhile-made me
know how it is that certain small folks never feel so big as when they
are in other people's houses—eating other people's dinners—and 'joying
other people's grandeur. They pack up so very little at home, that
they may show all the lº when they go out.
ell, Mr. Punch, I took up my pen, but I might as well have laid
hold of the eclectic eel that was once showed at Queen Adelaide's
Gallery; I couldn't hold it for a single syllable. Which makes me
certain—whatever may be printed to the contrary—that nothing reall
fine was ever writ in a garret. As for Rasselas and Wicar of Wakefield,
and so forth, my 'pinion is that they were the works of some Marquis
or Earl ashamed to be found out, and so put off upon poor people—just
in the same way, as I see a Lecturer in the papers goes to prove that
Hamlet and Macbeth and so forth were writ by the monks; and not by
an impostor known as SHAksPEARE. That, in fact, there never was
what we call one Swan of Avon, but a whole swarm of Church Mice.
By-the-way, is it true that PRINCE ALBERT is going down to Stratford
to lay the first stone of a house for SHAKsprARE's housekeeper? And
is it true that MR. CHARLEs KEAN is to be put into the place—as
BUoNAPARTE was sent to St. Helena—to be kept quiet, and never again
to disturb the public peace? M.R. LovELACE says he doesn't believe
it; but when we remember the pranks that MR. KEAN played at
Windsor, I—for my Hö. see anything to doubt in it. “”Twould
be cruel treatment of a Christian,” said LoveLACE. “Why?” said I.
said he: “when you remember how many, murders of
44 Why ?”
SHAKSPEARE an actor may have upon his head, wouldn't it be a little
severe even to the worst of stage sinners to put him in a place, where
his own Ghost of Hamlet—with all his own wounds upon him—might
come to him every night? Where Shylock, with a knife of blue fire, and
scales of yellow moonbeams might go round and round his bedside, like
a Jew round an area calling ‘hare-skins’—raving for a pound of flesh,
for every gash the player had given him No, no,” said LovELACE,
‘whatever difference may exist 'twixt SHAkspeaRE and MR. KEAN,
I should be sorry for the humanity of my country, to see the gentleman
sentenced to keep SHAkspeaRE's house. I’ve no objection to St.Helena,
or even Sierra Leone; but Stratford-upon-Avon would be too bad.”
However, Mr. Punch, to return to my garret-or rather, not to return,
as I’m out of it, being at this minute in trust of a splendid mansion—
(which between ourselves I hope nobody will look at)—in Eaton
Square. I’ve been removed only four days; and I do assure you, I’d
no sooner got out of that wretched garret, than my thoughts that
seemed twisted and tied in knots (if I may say so) with the cramp,
began to stretch themselves. The poetry in my soul-ſor LovERACE
says he knows it’s there—seemed to burst out in a blush like the lilacs.
I feel my feelings in very full leaf indeed; whereupon, Mr. Punch, I again
take * my pen, humbly hoping to give you the benefit of the season.
As if I was a human hawthorn—to use the flattering expression of
MR. LovELACE—I will try to put the perfume of my mind on paper.
The sweetest thing of my present position is, that I’m not cut off
from LoveLace—that London pride of policemen!—as of course I was
in my garret. Being in a house fit to entertain him, he took tea and
radishes with me last night, when both of us returned W.; to the
news of the day, like roebucks to the water-courses. “What,” said I,
“do you think of the QUEEN’s State Ball?”
“It’s very odd,” said LovELACE, balancing his spoon on the edge of
his ". and shaking his right leg crossed on his left; a habit he has
when he’s going to be original,—“it’s very odd, Miss BENIMBLE,” says
he—“if we look at the matter as historians, as philosophers, and as
Christians, it’s very odd, what a deal of Jewish matters has turned
upon dancing ! The State Ball is the last instance.”
“What do dº. MR. LovELACE P” says I. “What had the
State Ball to do with the Jews?”
. “And didn't you see LoRD JoHN's paragraph? For coolness, Wenham
ice is nothing to it: it was a notice putting off the Jews' Bill, because
the House of Commons was going to dance at Buckingham Palace. A
reat blow to the Judea of England! Not a Hebrew with a heart in his
osom that didn't feel it!. Religious liberty put off for a quadrille! The
. of the Minories still * on the willows, that STRAUss's Band
might yell and bellow polkas! hen the news went through Hounds:
ditch, there wasn’t a respectable Hebrew that didn't take his own coat
by the skirts, and to show his disgust of LoRD JoHN, rip it right up
to the collar! To put off the Jews for a dance,” said LoveLACE with a
leer, “looks very like a shuffle; I may say, a double shuffle.”
“But the Jews themselves,” said I, “didn’t seem to feel it. There
were—I saw two names—BARQN. Rothschild and BARON GQLDSMITH,
with, no doubt, their wives and families, present, dancing—all of 'em—
e so many DAVIDs l’” - -
“I didn't see that. I never read the list. It’s like looking into the
golden gardens of the Asparagus, over a wall of glass bottles... If, how-
ever, they were there”—said LovELACE, with one of his cutting looks
—“they were, no doubt, drest in Court-suits, of velvet sackcloth, and
their heads powdered with ashes of screened Wallsend. As loyal sub-
jects, they couldn't refuse the Royal command,-but, no doubt of it, as
Jews waiting for religious liberty—put off by a ball-no doubt they
went unshaved and in sackcloth mourning.” -
“And do§ think the Lords will throw the Jews out?” said I.
“I shouldn't at all wonder,” said LovELACE, “and for this reason.
It’s a bit of bigotry they can enjoy in comfort. That is, they know
there won't be much fuss about the matter. There’ll be no buttoning
up of pockets—no stopping of the supplies—no marching of iron men
from Birmingham, and so forth—no, not if instead of throwing the Jew
Bill out of the Lords, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal were to throw
all Holywell Street into the waters of Babylon.”
“Is it possible?” says I, for I couldn't believe it. -
“Have you never seen, Miss BENIMBLE,-never seen a boy with a
cockchafer on a pin, spinning him round; his father-I mean the boy's
father—a good, dull sort of a man, that wouldn't really hurt a Christian
sitting and looking quietly at the sport?. Have you never seen it *. f
nodded. “Well, then,” said LovELACE, “the House of Lords is that boy,
and the Jew is the cockchafer, . If Master Lord will still tease, and per;
secute the Jew, why, I don’t think John BULL will jump up in a heat, and
swear he won't standit. And Miss Bºnimmie”-andiovelace looked
serious and shook his head—“and this makes the matter all the shabbier.
It’s cowardly to try to torment any cockchafer soever, but more than
all, a cockchafer that hasn't got a friend.” - -
“Very true,” says I, glad to get from the subject, “Talking of
dresses”—(which he wasn't)—“that was a beautiful dress of the
QUEEN’s. A dress of pink tool with two petticoats!”
“Why two?” said MR. LovELACE: -
“Why not? If I was a Queen, I'd have twenty, and Spitalfields
should worship me. Two petticoats of Fº tool, trimmed with pink
and white gauze ribbon, ornamented with pink and white roses, green
leaves and diamonds. Her Majesty's headdress was composed of a
wreath of pink and white roses, green leaves and diamonds to answer.
MR. LovELACE, opening his eyes, said—“You seem to have got it all
by heart, and printed it there.” -
“I should # so,” said I... “Bless you, that pink and white gauze
—la! it’s gone the round of all the firesides of England—and then the
ink and white roses, why they’ve seemed grown upon the bushes of
}... . the green leaves are from the real British oak-and the
diamonds of the head-dress, why, what do they stand for, Mr. Lºyºlaº,
but for the bright good thoughts that fill our good Queen's little head?’
MR. LovELACE looked surprised at what he called my flow of words;
“Well, now I see it,” says he, “There’s a meaning in dress, after all.”
“To be sure there is,” said I, “if people have only the sense to
see it.”

“And that’s why in the newspapers,” said LovELACE, “Duchesses and so forth send their
Court dresses to press, that the world outside may learn from their boddices, and trains and
petticoats, the tempers and virtues of the wearers. I suppose it’s that, Miss BENIMBLE.”
“I suppose so,” said I, very shortly. -
“Still, when we go back to a state of mature,” said LovELACE.
“There’s no need of anything of the sort,” said I.
“When we go back to a state of mature, and come down from the infancy of society—”
“The infancy of society”—I begged leave to observe—“was society in long clothes.”
“What a distance it seems,” said LovELACE, “from the time, when wild in woods the noble
savage ran, to the present day! What a world of events must have engaged mankind, in their
course from barbarism to refinement, to make it a matter of interest to millions to know that any
particular person, on any icular occasion, wore two petticoats, with pink and white gauze.”
“MR. LovELACE,” said I, for my blood was up, “it’s my opinion you’re a heathen, and not
fit to take tea in decent society.”
This, Mr. Punch, I said as a woman. Nevertheless, it is not the opinion of,

DEMOSTHENES DISRAELI.
. days, or we should rather say the *::::::::::: days of eloquence, are beginning
to deve # themselves in the speeches of MR. BENAMIN DISRAELI, the pet of the Protectionists.
This b t orator is in the habit of taking chairs at public dinners with a r ity of
attendance wº of O'Toole, the toastmaster, and accordingly we find him presiding at a
banquet for the benefit of the Hospital for Consumption, at Brompton. The “Chair” was
‘supported,” as the phrase is, rather meagrely, and MR. DisRAELi, of course, had to make
the speech of the evening, the REv. RoRERT Montgomery seeming to be under an agree-
ment “to have and to hold” his tongue, while the Chairman executed the delivery of all that
piece or parcel”, of fustian which we found reported in the next day's Morning Chronicle.
R. DISRAELI tried his first oratorical flight upon the wings of the building, and we are sorry to
say offered a strong temptation to any one desirous of aiming at folly as it flies, to have a shot
at him. He paid a well-merited but rather a high-flown compliment to JENNY LIND, by saying
that, the Nightingale had “contributed some of the most brilliant plumes” to the wing of
the building. We scarcely understand this reckless allegory, but it probably means that,
instead of feathering her own nest, the Nightingale took the Hospital, under her own wing, or
rather clipped her wings, of her own accord to add a wing to the building. There is some
difficulty in carrying out the idea consistently, but we must not ask for sense, when DisrAELI
indulges his fancy. The shedding of her plumes in this instance was a feather in her cap, upon
which she has a good right to plume herself. ..
We trust we have commented on this portion of our orator's speech in a suitably mysterious
style, and we hope we have “kept "º. allegory '' to the º: satisfaction of the speaker.
Having dropped his wings, MR. DISRAELI perched on M. GUIzot's tiles at Brompton, and
THE
>
32
in that position commenced a series of ful-
some compliments to the retired Statesman
“dwelling under the shadow of the Hospital.”
A cabman, into whose hands we have put
MR, DISRAELI's data as to distances, informs
us that M. Guizot lives some little way from
the Institution, and not by any means within
the shadow; and that, at all events, he, the
cabman, could make no less than an eight-
penny fare of it.
We are sorry to pull up MR. DisRAELI's
Pegasus under the "Hackney Coach Act;
but when his fancy gallops, off at such a
preposterous rate, we think his poetical steed
is liable under the clause against furious
driving. -
Unfortunately for the orator, his audience
did not appear able or willing to follow him
in his canter through the realms of Imagina-
tion, and cries of “Question” brought him
down to the earth rather unceremoniously.
With much tact he alluded to a couple of sub-
scriptions he had got in his pocket- his
carriage having been stopped”—not to de;
mand his money or his life, as in the “good
old times,” but to force, upon him contribu-
tions from two well-wishers to the Charity.
“This was the spirit,” cried MR. DisrAELI,
“in which I came to take your Chair;” but
what the spirit was, we do not exactly see,
unless it was a spirit prompting him to be-
come the bearer of other people's bounty.
Such a spirit might, as well actuate an
honest postman, the light porter of a bank,
or any other humble individual intrusted to
carry an article of value from one place to
another. We have no doubt MR. DisrAE1.1
came down with something handsome on his
own, account; but he avowedly appreciated
the luxury of being the vehicle—in common
with his own carriage, which was purposely
stopped—of the munificence of others.
TWO MISCREANTS.
SoME caitifſ—we have our eye upon him,
and his description is in the hands of the
police—has presumed to aim at us two deadly
missiles, which he calls jokes, but which are
in fact nothing more nor less than large
lumps of lead, which are liable to do con-
siderable mischief if they should make a hit,
which there is happily no prospect of.
The first is in the form of a suggestion, that,
on the Manager of Her Majesty's Theatre
consulting Mr. Punch as to what he should do
next, the reply was, that in consequence
of the enormous attraction of La Sonnn.
bula, Lucia, and La Figlia, the next produc-
tion should be Lind-a-d'ish-o'-money. We
need only call to mind the opera of Linda di
Chamouni, to show the heartless and headless
nature of this atrocity.
The next offence is scarcely of a less
aggravated character,for the punster in human
form, asks how to make a soprano a contralto;
and, before we have time to breathe, darts
upon us with the savage rejoinder, “making
GRISI ANGRI.”
We hope to have the fellow in custody in a
few hours.
Absurd impartiality.
AN individual of our acquaintance has
become so impressed with the conviction of
arty being the “madness of many,” that he

than evince the smallest toleration of any-
thing in the shape of party—to pull down his
own party wall.

CZETck-NATIONAL GUARD.
QUR Illustrated Contemporaries are continually exerting their imagi-
nations on those great Unpronounceables, such as the CzeTCKs, the
CRQAtwzcHsitzEs, the SLowacks, and the various other tribes in
nack, crack, etchtsz, sycktz, or any of the numerous, ultimates that
present equal difficulties to the dentist and the philologist. Being ex-
tremely anxious to furnish the world with representations, as near as
the distance of our artist's studio from the locality inhabited by the
tribes in º will allow, we have procured the accompanying
sketches of a few select, specimens of the Crackjaw soldiery, who are
now setting the teeth of all Europe on edge by the polysyllabic nature of
someof their names, and the unorthodox orthography of the whole of them.
The first figure in our outlandish gallery, is that of a member of the
CROATwzcHsitzes Royal Foot Guard, who ap to combine the rough
and ready style of the old Flizabethan R. , with the loose habit of
the Turkish Light Trowsery. , The helmet combines the strength of
the scuttle (gules) with the slender elegance of the Peacock's tail (verd-
antique), while the shoe seems to be oscillating between the steel-bound
slippery skate, and the home-cherished Margate slipper.
umber 2 in our collection gives us a soldier of the Slovack Infantry
drawn by the same highly imaginative process which must be required
for representing objects hundreds of miles off, without the trouble and
expense of going to look at them. The Slovack forces are supposed to
be so termed from their being slow to whack—or pack—or to use a
more refined expression, tardy, in giving battle. This slowness, pecu-
liar to this class of Wacks, is regulated in part by the ponderous nature
of the head-gear—having two balance weights depending from behind—
and partly by the back portion of the dress, whose weight, acts as a
restrainer to the fury, and a rudder to the movements of the soldier
thus caparisoned. To some of the most emergetic spirits among the
Slovack Infantry these caparisons are odious, but on the whole the
accoutrements are well adapted to the individuals wearing them.
The 3rd of our figurines of military fashions in the Trans-Dil-
worthian or Anti-spellable quarters of Europe, comprehends some.
thing in itself rather incomprehensible, in the form of a Czetck
National Guard, whose costume must speak for itself, as it is quite im:
possible to do justice to its uniqueness and originality. The idea of
placing the soldier in a dress entirely round, has the advantage of pre-
venting him from feeling himself driven up into a corner, though it cer-
tainly causes the soldiers to find the operation of forming themselves
into squares extremely difficult.
NEW MUSICAL EFFECT.
IN MEYERBEER’s new opera of Le Prophète, now, performing at
Paris, there is a Grand ballet danced in Skates by the whole strength of
the Establishment. . This much surpasses in grandeur our old British
notion of a Hornpipe in Fetters, from which the idea of a dance in
Skates is evidently borrowed.
We understand that another Composer, whose name we do not give
(because if we did, nobody would know it), has got an Opera which has
been five-and-twenty years in his carpet bag—i. Prophète was fifteen
years in MEYERBEER’s portfolio–the principal point in which is a
hintette in Stilts, for one soprano, one tenor, and three baritones.
he Composer has written the parts amazingly high—four feet high for
the lady, and six feet high for the gentlemen—so that it is doubtful
whether artists can be found who will be able to grapple with the
difficulties, particularly in the running passages.
The Skate dance in Le Prophète is rendered somewhat easier by a
fundamental base, of a fluted character—accomplished by the use of
fluted Skates—and enabling the executionists to get over the ground
with greater rapidity, as well as investing the movement with a species
of softenuto that greatly facilitates the progress of the performers. On
the first might, though the music of the te dance is written in two
sharps, three of the dancers broke down into three flats, but they
rapidly d theirerror, and went on swimmingly, or rather skatingly,
to the end of the morceau.
AFTER-DINNER Toast For THE SANITARY CommissionERs—when
next they dine.—The Health of the Metropolis.
WONDERFUL DISPATCH OF BUSINESS.
On Saturday, April 28th, the House met at 10 minutes, past 12, and
adjourned at 20 minutes after 12,-the whole time occupied upon public
business being exactly ten minutes. When a person has a great deal to
say, and wishes to detain an unwilling listener, he generally prefaces his
oration with “I’ll not detain you ten minutes.”. Loºp John will
shortly open Parliament in the same way, but with this simple difference,
that when he says, “Gentlemen, I’ll not detain you ten minutes,” he
will not, as is the fashion with too many talkers, º: by the button:
hole for an hour or two, but will let you off precisely to the promised
minute. He knows too well the value of time to waste a single
second. He is aware what a deal can be compressed into a quarter
of an hour—in fact, he feels, we are sure, that the whole business of the
Session, as far as it has yet gone, might just as well have been trans:
acted in ten minutes; and that the nation, instead of losing, would
rather have gained by it. If ever the Minutes of the Session are
published, the celebrated Ten on the busy 28th of April must not be
forgotten.

* PVBLICK TS ExcyteNENTE ON >e APPEARANCE OF . Miss LAND
Saturday, May 5, 1849.--To the Queen's House in the Haymarket to
hear JENNY LIND, whom everybody do call the Swedish Nightingale.
Did go with a Pit Ticket. Went at 6, p.m., expecting a Crowd, and
there a Mob of People already at the Doors, and some did say they
had come as early as Five. Got as close as I could to the Pit Entrance,
and the Throng i. and by-and-by Ladies in their 9.
Dresses standing without their Bonnets in the Street. Many of them
between the Carriage Wheels and under the Horses’ Heads: and me-
thinks I did never see more Carriages together in my Life. At last
the Doors open; which did lº to fear they never would, and I in
with the Press, a most terrible Crush, and the Ladies screaming and
their Dresses torn in the Scramble, wherefore I thought it a good Job
that my Wife was not with me. With much ado into the Pit, the way
being stopped by a Snob in a green Jockey Coat and Bird's Eye Neck-
cloth, that the Checktakers would not suffer to i.
Twinkling, and I fain to stand where I best might, nigh to Fop's Alley;
but presently a Lady fainting with the Heat and carried out, which
was glad of; I mean that I gother Place. I did never behold so much
Company, in the House before ; and every Box full of Beauties, and
§ with yellow Satin Curtains, did show like a brave Picture in a
Gold Frame; which was very handsome to look round upon while the
Musicians were tuning. The Fiddles tuned, and the Overture played,
the Curtain up for the Opera; which was the Sonnambula; the part of
Amina acted by JENNY. The moment she came on the Stage, the

gale sing; and for certain she is a wonderful Singer. It did amaze
me, to hear how easy and sweetly she do trill and warble the most
difficult. Passages: and I perceive she has a rare Ability of Voice.
But, what did no less astonish me was her Acting, it ºf as
good as her Singing; for she did seem to forget her in her Part,
instead of her Part in herself; which is the Yſistake of most Opera
Singers. To think that she should draw the whole Town in Crowds
together to hear her sing a few pretty Sugarplum Melodies and portray
the Grief of a poor Peasant Wench cast off by her Lover! But she do
throw a Grace and Beauty of her own into the Character and Musique:
which I take to be the Mark of a true Genius. She made to sing divers
ngs twice over, and called upon the Stage at the End of the Act, and
again when the Opera was finished; when, good lack, to see the Nose-
§. and Posies #. in Heaps upon the Stage! She must needs get a
int of Money by her singing; but she has spent a deal of it in building
Hospitals, and I do wish (Heaven forgive me!) I had all she has given
away in Charity.

TOWN.
MR. BROWN THE ELDER TAKES MR. BROWN THE YOUNGER TO A CLUB.
FRoºt the library we proceed to the carved and gilded drawing-room of the
club, the damask hangings of which are embroidered with our lovely emblem,
the Polyanthus, and which is fitted with a º unintelligible splendour.
SARDANAPALUs, if he had pawned one of his kingdoms, could not have had
such mirrors as one of those in which I see my dear Bob admiring the tie of
his cravat with such complacency, and I am sure I cannot comprehend, why
SMITH and BRows should have their persons reflected in such vast sheets
of *. or why, if we have a mind to a sixpenny, cup of tea and
muffins, when we come in with muddy boots from a dirty walk, those refresh:
ments should be served to us as we occupy a sofa much more splendid, and
far better stuffed, than any Louis QuAToñze ever sate upon. I want a sofa,
as I want a friend, upon which I can repose, familiarly. If you can't have
intimate terms and freedom with one and the other, they are of no good.
A full-dress Club is an absurdity—and no man ought to come into this room
except in a uniform or a court suit. Idaren't put my feet.on yonder sofa
for fear of sullying the damask, or, worse still, for fear that Hicks the Com-
mittee-man should pass, and spy out my sacrilegious boots on the cushion.
We pass through these double-doors, and enter rooms of a very different
character.
º the faint and sickly odour pervading this º by the opened
windows, by the circular stains upon the marble tables, which indicate the
resence of brandies-and-waters long passed into the world of Spirits, my
#. Bob will have no difficulty in recognising the smoking-room, where
dare say he will pass a good deal of his valuable time henceforth.
WOI. XVI. N
If I could recommend a sure way of advancement and profit
to a young man about town,it would be, after he has come away
from a friend's house and dinner, where he has to a surety had
more than enough of claret and good things, when he ought to be
fº to bed at midnight, so that he might rise fresh and early for
s morning's work, to stop, nevertheless, for a couple of hours at
the Club, and smoke in this room and tipple weak brandy-and-water.
By a perseverance in this system, you may get a number of
advantages. By sitting up till 3 of a summer morning, you have
the advantage of seeing the sunrise, and as you walk home to Pump
Court, can mark the quiet of the streets in the rosy glimmer of
the dawn. You can easily spend in that smoking-room (as for the
billiard-room adjacent, how much more can’t you get rid of there),
and without any inconvenience or extravagance whatever, enough
money to keep you a horse. Three or four cigars when you are in
the Club, your case filled when you are going away, a couple of
glasses of very weak Cognac and cold water, will cost you sixty
pounds a year, as sure as your name is Bob BRowN. And as for
the smoking and tippling, plus billiards, they may be made to cost
anything.
And then you have the advantage of hearing such delightful
and instructive conversation in a Club smoking-room, between
the hours of 12 and 3! Men who frequent that place at that
hour are commonly men of studious habits and philosophical
and reflective minds, to whose opinions it is pleasant and ºl.
to listen. Th; are full of anecdotes, which are always moral and
well-chosen; their talk is never free, or on light subjects. I have
one or two old smoking-room pillars in my eye now, who would
be perfect models for any young gentleman entering life, and to
Nº. a father could not do better than intrust the education of
ls son.
To drop the satirical vein, my dear Bob, I am compelled as a
man to say my opinion, that the best thing you can do with regard
to that smoking-room is to keep out of it; or at any rate never
to be seen in the place after midnight. They are very pleasant and
frank, those jolly fellows, those loose fishes, those fast young men
—but the race in life is not to such fast men as these—and you
who want to win must get up early of a morning, my boy. Ou
and an old college-chum or two may sit together over your cigar-
boxes in one another's chambers, and talk till all hours, and do
yourselves good probably. Talking among you is a wholesome
exercitation; humour comes in an easy flow; it doesn't preclude
grave argument and manly interchange of thought-Iown myself,
when I was younger to have smoked many a pipe with advantage in
the company of Doctor PARR: Honest men, with pipes or cigarsin
their mouths, have great physical advantages in conversation. You
may stop talking iſ you like-but, the breaks of silence never
seem disagreeablº, being filled up by the puffing of the smoke-
hence there is no awkwardness in resuming the conversation— no
straining for effect-sentiments are delivered in agrave easy manner
—the cigarharmonises the society, and soothes at once the speaker
and the subject whereon he converses, I have no doubt that it is
from the habit of smoking that Turks and American Indians are
such monstrous well-bred men. The º: draws wisdom from the
lips of the philosopher, and shuts up the mouth of the foolish; it
generates a style of conversation, contemplative, thoughtful,
benevolent, and unaffected: in fact, dear Bob, I must out with
it—I am an old smoker... At home ihave done it up the chimney
rather than not do it (the which I own is a crime). I vow and
believe that the cigar has been one of the greatest creature-
comforts of my life—a kind companion, a gentle stimulant, an
amiable anodyne, a cementer of friendship. May Idie if I abuse
that kindly weed which has given me so much pleasure
Since I have been a member of the Club, what numbers of men
have occupied this room and departed from it, like so many smoked;
out cigars, leaving nothing behind but a little disregarded ashes!
Bob, my boy, they drop offin the course of twenty years, our boon
companions, and jolly fellow bottle-crackers.-I mind me of many
a good fellow who has talked and laughed here, and whose pipe is
put out for ever. Men, I remember, as dashing youngsters but
the other day, have passed into the state of old fogies: they have
sons, Sir, of almost our age, when first we joined the Polyanthus.
Grass grows over others in all parts of the world. Where is poor
NED # Where is poor FRED TOead rhymes with NED and FRED
too-their place knows them not—their names one year appeared
at the end of the Chub list, under that dismal category of “Mem-
bers Deceased,” in which you and I shall rank some day. Do you
keep that subject º, in your mind?' I do not see why one
shouldn't meditate upon Death in PallMall as well as in a howling
wilderness. There is enough to remind one of it at every corner.
There is a strange face looking out of JACK's old lodgings in Jermyn

are better out of it; that you will waste your money and your precious
down to the Club as usual, saying, “Well, and so poor old BRown's |
gone.”—Indeed, a smoking-room on a morning is not a cheerful spot.
Our room has a series f tenants of quite distinct characters. After
an early and sober dinner below, certain habitués of the Polyanthus
mount up to this apartment for their coffee and cigar, and talk as gravely
as Sachems at a palaver. Trade and travel, politics and 3. y, are
their discourse—they are in bed, long before their successors
e jolly
fellows begin their night life, and the talk of the one set is as different
to the conversation of the other, as any talk can be.
After the grave old Sachems, come other frequenters of the room;
a squad of .# men very likel —very solemn and silent personages
these—who give the odds, and talk about the cup in a darkling under
tone. Then you shall have three or four barristers with high voices,
seldom able to sit long without talking of their profession, or mention-
ing something about Westminster Hall. About eleven, men in white
neckcloths drop in from, dinner-parties, and show their lacquered boots
and shirt-studs with a little, complacency—and at midnight, after the
theatres, the young rakes and viveurs come swaggering in, and call loudly
for gin-twist. - |
But as for a Club smoking-room after midnight, I vow again that you
hours and health there; and you may frequent this Polyanthus room
for a year, and not carry away from the place one single idea or story
that can do you the least good in life. How much you shall take away
of another sort, I do nothere set down; but I have before my mind's
eye the image of Qld SILENUs with purple face and chalk-stone fingers,
telling his foul old garrison legends over his gin-and-water. He is in
the smoking-room every #. and I feel that no man can get benefit
from the society of that old man. - - -
What society he has he gets from this place. He sits for hours in a
corner of the sofa, and makes up his parties here. He will ask you after
a little time, seeing that you are a gentleman and have a good address,
and give you an exceedingly good dinner. I went once, years ago, to
abanquet of his—and foundallihe men at his table were Polyanthuses:
so that it was a house dinner in Square, with MRs. SILENUs
at the head of the table.
After dinner she retired and was no more seen, and SILENUs
amused himself by making poor MR. TIPPLETON drunk. He came to
the Club the next day, he amused himself by describing, the arts by
which he had practised upon the easy brains of poor MR.T.PPLETON-
(as if that poor fellow wanted * arts or persuasion to induce him to
intoxicate himself), and told all the smoking-room, how he had given a
dinner, how many bottles of wine had been emptied, and how many
TIPPLEToN had drunk for his share. “I kept my eye on TIP, Sir,” the
horrid old fellow said—“I took care to make him mix his liquors well,
and before 11 o'clock I finished him and had him as drunk as a
lord, Sir!” Will you like to have that gentleman for a friend? He
has elected himself our smoking-room king at the Polyanthus, and
midnight monarch.
As he talks, in comes poor, TIPPLETON.—a kind soul-agentleman—a
man of reading and parts—who has friends at home very likely, and had
once a career before him—and what is he now?. His eyes are vacant;
he reels into a sofa corner, and sits in maudlin silence, and hiccups
every now and then. Old SILENUs winks knowingly round at the whole
smoking-room ; most of the men sneer—some pity—some very young
cubs laugh and jeer at him. TIPPLEToN’s drunk.
PERFECT TO A hair.
WE heard the other evening a new version of the old saying, “as
y as a badger.” A gentleman was speaking of somebody's hair, and
e exclaimed, “Will you believe it, Sir? He's as Grey as a Whig
Administration.” Several persons looked as if they could scarcely
believe such a thing possible.

THE BEST YARN SPUN YET.
A GENTLEMAN at the Society of Arts has been inventing anew pair of
gloves constructed entirely of cobwebs. Hurrah! the summer is coming,
and these gloves will be just the things for catching flies! No butcher,
no pastrycook, no engraver, no picture-cleaner, no milliner, no house-
maid, no housewife should be without them. As for ourselves, we
shall never go to in the summer without a pair of these gloves,
for if there is one thing we dislike more than another, it is a ferocious
blue-bottle waking us up in the middle of the night, and buzzing away
in both our ears, making it perfectly impossible to go to sleep again.
Cobwebs will henceforth take a new hold in our affections, and our
wives, instead of breaking the slender thread of their existence by the
ruthless Turk's-head, will grow so attached, to the fair spinsters, that
in time they will be quite hand and glove with them. .

WANTED A BISHOP.
A Few days ago, during a sitting of some of the Peers as a Court of
Appeal, the discovery was made that their Lordships were not properly
constituted as a House, and as this could not be done without a member
of the Episcopal Bench to read prayers, Lord BRough AM began to cry
out lustily for “a Bishop.” A hunt for a Bishop was accordingly com-
meuced, and the corridors rang for some time with a sort of “view
hollo” of “Where's a Bishop?” “We want a Bishop.” Ultimately a
Bishop was found, but the incident shows the inconvenience of not
being prepared at all times with a Bishop, and the question naturally
occurs whether LoRD BRough AM would say Nolo Episcopari in its
usual sense if a Bishopric were offered him. This emergetic nobleman
is generally º to have mastered every science and every pro-
fession, but we think divinity is still open to him as a field for distinction.
The See of Limerick is now vacant; and as it appears that residence
was not a portion of the duties that the late occupant thought it
incumbent on him to undertake, we have no doubt that LoRD
BRough AM would make as good a Bishop as his predecessor; and the
cry of, “Where’s a Bishop?” “We want a Bishop,” “ We can’t
make a house without a Bishop,” need not be raised, as iong as that
most indefatigable of Peers, the BARQN of Vaux, may be in attend-
ance. In a recent case, he kindly undertook the part of a witness in
addition to that of Judge, and proved the title of the late Lond
MELBourne, to his own satisfaction, and that of the other Peers who
were present. Why not make floºd Broughºu Bishop of the
suburban Sea of Batter, to which his own Hall of Vaux is contiguous?
LIBEL ON THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
... We are informed that by a standing order of the House of Lords, as
well as of the House of Commons, all strangers, reporters not excepted,
are excluded from the debates, and, when present in either House, are
supposed to have no business there, but are suffered to attend under an
imaginary rose, which ought to be one of the decorations of the new
Houses of Parliament.
We read in the newspapers that Loºp BEAUMONT, on Thursday last,
moved, in their Lordships' House, that the said standing order “be
considered:” when the {i,j. of LANsdowne was opposed to the
abrogation of the order, and LoRD BRough AM said ditto to the MAR-
quis of LanspowNE: on which occasion, also, Lord BRough AM
asserted that their Lordships only “commived” at the publication of
their debates.
The Navigation|b
up” so completely
We believe that strangers are actually excluded from the parlia-
mentary debates, but we do not credit any other of the foregoin
allegations. We say this because we are unwilling to accuse the #;
Court of Parliament of getting its º published by a subterfuge
and a humbug, and, by using language of that strength, to commit a
breach of privilege, and incur the pains and penalties in such case made
and provided.
Accordingly, we are convinced that the report of what occurred in
the House of Lords on Thursday last was a mere fiction, and that Loºp
BEAUMont never made so wise a motion, and Lords LANspowne and
* never uttered such unwise remarks as were ascribed
elli.
In, particular, we are confident, that LoRD BRough AM could not
possibly havº accused himself and the other Peers ºf the meanness of
conniying” at what they refuse to sanction. To connive, as his
Lordship very well knows, is literally to wink or cock the eye, and the
aseness of connivance º to the vulgarity of winking. We
could conceive neither LoRD BRough AM nor the House guilty of any:
thing so ignoble without expressing a contempt for both, which d
subject us to unpleasant consequences. However, we wish the Houses
of Parliament would allow their debates to be reported; in which ease,
doubtless, we should see something in the papers very different from
the monsensical, speeches attributed to so many noble lords and
honourable members.

KEEP YOUR HEADS COOL.
OUR eyes are being everywhere struck and otherwise appealed
to by announcements of ventilating hats, and the
schemes seem to be somumerous as well as so elaborate,
that we should not be surprised to hear that DR. REID
had been aiming a blow at the public head, and had
taken a hat in hand as some compensation for the
coolness with which his ventilating experiments have
been received in the Courts of Law and in Parliament.
The old original ventilating hat was º first
suggested by the cast-off he of somebody who “wore his beaver
as to have burst the crown: but science has im-
on this, and the ventilating wheel has long
m introduced into the ventilating hat; but inge-
nuity is still busy, and we may soon expect some-
thing superior to the old whirligig mode of letti
in air for the purpose of preventing explosions o
fire-damp in the hat; which is particularly liable to
happen to every one who has “alight in his laughing
eye,” or is in any way light-headed.
We may expect to see an apparatus ere long |
applied to the hat, on the same principle as the
ventilators, on the top of the Haymarket Theatre, sº -
Exeter Hall, and the Old Bailey. It may be objected
that the contrivance has too much the look of a cowl, and may be
thought in these Puseyite days to savour too much of Romanism; but
this drawback it may be easy to remedy.
Awful. Effects of want of wentilation.
INSANITARY INTELLIGENCE. |
The EARL or GAILowAY wishes to have his speeches reported º
as he delivers them . The noble Earl's family are dreadfully alarmed.
They begin to suspect that he is the Editor of the Fometic Muz.
The Stag at Bay—We have heard it whispered, that, should there
be a vacancy at Hudson's Bay, the Railway Ex-King will be offered
a seat in that direction.

BLUSTERING RAILERS.
WE have been in many of the ordinary storms of life, we have been |
present at domestic breezes heightened by the tempestuous squalls of
a “parcel of children,” we have “made" Chelsea from Battersea when
a solºwester has been blowing off Brompton, and when a gale has
carried three sheets in the ºf . say nothing of half-a-dozen table
cloths, but we never heard of or witnessed anything so furious as the
storming of the “Blustering Railers” at the Eastern Counties meeting.
MR. WADDINGTON's speech was received throughout, with perfect
hurricanes of “Oh's ' ' and as much “groaning” as would have sufficed
-if concentrated—to have blown the roof of the building where the
meeting was held, “Off, off, and away!” Every sentence he attempted
to utter was the signal for a series of screams and yells that said much
more for the lungs than for the brains of the assembled shareholders.
They. º: to be as deaf to the words as they have hitherto chosen to
be blind to the acts of those of whom, when dividends were large, they
were content to be the dupes; but whom, when the plunder is no longer
forthcoming, they are determined to hunt down by angry clamour.
For our own parts, we look upon the railway disagreement as a sign
that honest men are about to come by their own again.

A GREAT BLANK IN THE COUNTRY.
We are informed that a morning newspaper, finding the utter im-
º of anything being correctly heard in the House of Lords
intends doing away with the expense of a large staff of reporters, and
engaging for the future but one gentleman at a pound a week to report
the Debates. It has given, the preference to a young Chinese, who
is extremely intelligent, and has the additional merit of being perfectly
eaf. We subjoin his report of the second reading of the Navigation
Laws, as a very good specimen of his style:
“The House of Lords met yesterday, and, after sitting for eleven hours, adjourned t
What they said or what they did, or what they met or separated for, we cannot possibly

superfluous, but luckily the absurdity speaks for itself.”
This year's proceedings of the House of Lords will, it is very clear,
not take }. much room, in the forthcoming volumes of Hansard's
Debates. They will doubtlessly be given on the fly-leaf.

MISS, BENIMBLE’S TEA-AND-TOAST.
LoRD NELsoN’s APPEARANCE IN THE NAVIGAtion LAws.-HUDson's
voy AGE ROUND THE world IN THE “FORLORN HOPE.”—How
DISRAELI LEFT THE JEws, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.
“I suppose, MR. LovELACE,” said I-
MR. LovELACE had just withdrawn from his beat
for one cup of Twankay, and found me up to my chin
in the Navigation Debate.
“I suppose, MR. LovELACE, with the Navigation
Laws, 'xtinguished, BRITANNLA must come down and
take her seat., on the steps of nations. I’m told
there isn’t a British oak in the country that, after
the division of the Lords, isn't gone as hollow as a
reed. When the Duke gave 'em up, their hearts died
within 'em. To be sure, LoRD Nelson—who, I am
told, is very li - nailed his colours
to his head in the House of Peers; but, after all, went
down with LORD BROUGHAM and the rest of the
minority.”
“It was a fine thought, Miss BENIMBLE”—said
LovELACE, with one of hi ve, sly looks—“a fine
thought to rummage up, and air LoRD NELson ; a
thought ". worthy of LoRD WAux. I’m told he looked very well,
indeed. MR. T. P. CookE, burning with a hornpipe in honour of
Old England, never seemed more like the real thing. I assure you,
NELSON on a sign-post was never more like life than the NELson of
the Navigation Debate. Capitally drest for the part, upon my word.”
“Drest | * said I. -
“In the admiral's old clothes to look more in earnest. His Lord-
ship didn’t much like the notion at first; but LoRD BRough AM
threatened to wear the clothes himself; to put on NELsoN’s coat and
smalls, with sword and cocked hat, leaving the arm out to make the
'lusion perfect. Upon this, LoRD NElson turned out as the tar; and
for that night only, talked a little bit of Copenhagen. (They do say,
NELSON's statue in St. Paul's was found in a terrible sweat in the
morning !) . Ha! Miss BENIMBLE, I’ve sometimes thought if t
plebeians who conquer titles could only know the sort of folks who’d
wear 'em afterwards, they’d have nothing to do with coronets. For
look }. here... A coronet—a glory won by the genius of the father—
tumbled Nº. the head of a descendant, may be little more than a fool's-
cap, worn by a nincompoop jº.
“Such things find their level,” said I. “What’s a star upon one
man's coat isn’t so much as a pewter button upon another's. Names
don’t make things, MR. LoyFLACE. A rabbit's-skin tippet isn't a bit
less rabbit, call it ermine as long as you will.”
“Very true. But when ermine beget rabbits—”
Here, Mr. Punch, I changed the conversation with a wrench, and
begged to know ... LovELACE’s straightfor’ard opinion—“if he
tº: the British oak withered for ever?”
“Gone, ma'am”—said he, with a laugh—“dead as your birch-broom.
There won't be an oak-apple as big as a pin this blessed twenty-ninth
of May, to dedicate to the sweet-smelling memory of CHARLEs THE
SECOND; a king who was every way worthy of a bough. The British
sailor—in ten years or less—will be an extinct A. He will only
survive in melodramas, with a imen or two preserved in pitch for
the British Museum. As a proof of what we may expect, the Runjeet
Singh—late Red Rover—will be entirely manned with Lascars for the
Margate voyages. . The Chinese Junk—with her own crew—only waits
for the bridges to be enlarged, and the river deepened, to monopolise
#... passenger coasting trade from Dyer’s Wharf to Thames
itton.”
“And BRITANNIA’”—
“BRITANNIA may take her trident to toast herrings with; she can
never comb the waves with it again, with all the Laws of Navigation
gone. . However.”—said LovELACE in his solid way, when I’m stag-
red to know whether he means yes or no—a great fault, as I take it,
r. Punch, with anybody—“however, it’s a good thing for MR.
HUDSON.”
“Poor creature!” said I, “well, I’m glad to hear that. For, after
all, M.R. LoyELACE, I have a woman's heart for greatness in the shade.
And then it’s astonishing to find, how much folkshate and abuse what’s
wº; when they can get nothing by it.”
“The re-action of virtue,” said LovELACE, “is sometimes wonderful.
When people, who have done their best (and their worst) to cover
themselves with gold-cloth, and at the last only find themselves in
frieze, why, frieze is then the only wear...When we can't drive a
market with avarice,—what a sweet primitive virtue is moderation!
How dainty tongues will lick the cloven hoof of the golden calf, when
on the pedestalſ. How will they spit upon it, when tumbled down,
and, with a rope round its neck, doomed for the crucible. Mr.
Hupson has, after all, deserved well of his country. No man has,
perhaps, called forth such expressions of virtuous principle-even from
folks, it may be, surprised by their sudden excellence. The beggar,
baulked in his hopes of spoil, fondles his rectitude, and is a very
virtuous beggar indeed!” -
“But,” said I, “what’s all this to do with the Navy and MR.
HUDSON ?”
“Everything, madam. MR. Hudson, his crown being now so much
old iron—it has been bought, I understand, by a distinguished dealer
in marine stores for a sign for his emporium–MR. Hudson, dis-
gusted by the worshippers, who have only arisen from their knees to
kick discrowned PLuius with their heels–MR. Hudson has purchased,
at an alarming sacrifice on the part of the Admiralty, one of the
QUEEN’s three-deckers. A bottle of brandy flung at her head (the
ceremony, was kindl rformed by MR, WADDINGTON) has re-
christened her the º: Hope. Well, madam”—said LovELACE,
with his mouth puckering, as it will sometimes—“MR. HUDsoN has
determined to leave a thankless terra firma, and to take a voyage round
the world in search of gratitude”— -
“Bringing back specimens, like CAPTAIN Cook?” said I.
“If he finds 'em,” said LovELACE. “Be this as it may, it’s a noble
thought—a vast idea—and quite worthy of a Vulcanic king, with too
many irons red-hot in the fire, to make himself a new royalty on the
sea. And then, Miss, BENIMBLE, the Forlorn Hope sails beyond
the tempest of the Press! The captain, at the worst, can close-reef his
canvas, and in the dirtiest weather, defy the rolling thunder of the
printing-machine. The sun may rise copper-red and threatening, but
the Times does not every morning come out of the sea. And so, going
round and round the world—and never, except for victual and water—
peeping into it; why, in a season shares may get up, and the Forlorn
Hope return in the nick of time for thumping dividends. It’s wonderful,
too, how some folks—though inch-thick in mud-do get clean again!
But the fact is, and it is a truth that cannot have escaped you—when
the dirt’s dry, it rubs off.” - -
“That’s a sweet moral truth, MR. LovELACE,” said I. “But if
MR. HUDsoN–or ADMIRAL HUpson—sails in the Forlorn Hope, who's
to sail with him? Who’s to work the ship, if I’m right in the words?”
“Why, I am told,” said LovELACE with a laugh, “I’m told that
Capei Court's been billed for hands. just as CochRANE or NAPIER
might placard Portsmouth. Something in this way: Wanted, for the
Forlorn Hope to go round the world, any number of adventurous spirits
who don't care to be seen in it. ... Rally round the Iron Admiral, who
Expects Every Man to Do! Nevertheless, Miss BENIMBLE,” said
LoyºAce, “that’s not the way I'd man Hudson's ship.”
“Why, how would you doº” said I, curious. -
“Press-warrants, Miss BENIMBLE, press-warrants,” said LovELACE,
hº his knee with a wicked laugh. -
“What! You / When—as I’ve heard you say—every Englishman's
house is his castle?”
“A fiction, ma'am. A castle in the air. I’d issue press-warrants
for the Forlorn Hope, and this is the sort of crew I’d have. Everybody
-high or low-who, in by-gone days, had licked the dust of HUDson's
shoes, thinking it gold-dust ; everybody who denied elbow-room to their
own souls in presence of that Effulgent Witulus—”
“What’s a Vitulus P” said I–
“It’s Latin for veal,” said he; “every worshipper,who thought KING
HUDsoN stronger than KING DEATH, and brought soul-offerings to him
accordingly—every one, beginning, with the highest, I’d press—ha!
Y.,'" of their beds—and pack 'em off to serve aboard the Forlorn
*... 'd never do it!” said I. “Only think, what suffering you’d
bring ". the peace of families—and moreover, MR. LovELACE, the
best of families.”
“No doubt of it,” said he, never caring. “Why, there’d be lords and
nobles escaping over the roofs of houses—members of Parliament flying
in their shirts—most respectable, and virtuous, and indignant people
hiding in cupboards and coal-cellars. But, bating all things, I’ve no
doubt, of pressing a full, smart crew : but what’s more, to insure
discipline, I’d have a double number of boatswain's mates, every one
of 'em railway attorneys.” -
“And do you think such a ship would live in a sea?” said I.
“That’s not my business, Miss BENIMBLE,” said he ; “however, let
us leave the Forlorn Hope, and talk of a rising star—it’s more pleasant.
That was a very nice speech of young PEEL's. Lallude to the Jews' Bill.”
“A very nicely got-up speech indeed,” said L. “The finest linen was
never got up better.” -
“And, as I hear, modestly Fº It must have warmed old SIR
RoBERT's heart, to have heard the cheers on both sides. A modest
entleman, MR. FREDERICK PEEL; and so, a capital set-off to the
fº impertinence of some folks. There's always hopes of a modest
man—but early brass never changes. ..
“No vain man matures, he makes too much new wood;
His blooms are too thick for the fruit to be good;
'Tis the modest man ripens, 'tis he that achieves,
Just what's needed of sunshine and shade he receives;
Grapes, to mellow, require the cool dark of their leaves.
“Who writ that?” said I–“MR. DISRAELI?”

“Why, no. Not but what it’s quite in his way. Yet how modestly
he patted M. Guizot on the head at the Consumption Festival; that one
where MR. Robert Montgomery—so sleek in ten editions of Satan–
talked of his own sermons. But RoBERT's a rising man. No doubt of
it, he’ll he Bishop of London when DISRAELI is First Lord of the

“But the poetry, MR. LovELACE *” - -
“Oh, the ſines. They’re American; from a very smart, salt thing,
called A Fable for the Critics. . Here and there rough as a hedgehog;
but still with quite as many points. But to go back to DISRAELI ?”
“I was going to ask it, MR. LovELACE. Where was BENJAMIN on
the Jews’ Bill?”
“Where, indeed?” said LovELACE. “You know what a deal he’s done
for the people! What a pet of his inkstand he’s made of 'em!. How his
heart was given up to 'em—for good or bad—like the baby Moses to
the bulrushes. And on the third reading he was nowhere. There was
Spoon ER, and GRANBY, and PLUMPTRE, all of 'em belabouring and
abusing the Jew with the best intentions, and as they declared, with the
mildest Christianity—and where was the hero of the race, where was
BENJAMIN ? Why was he not present with his net of oratorical lemons
ready to fit one to the appropriate mouth of PLUMPTRE * Where was
Sidonia P Why, Miss BENIMBLE, it’s extraordinary, but—the story has
not yet got into the papers—he was almost nowhere !”
... Story! what do you mean?” said.I.
and SIRTHORPs. Better service was offered. Sidonia, like Launcelot
Gobbo reasoned with himself as to place. “To be ruled by my conscience,
I should stay with the Jew.’ The fiend, however, gave him more
friendly counsel, and he ran to Protectionist Bassanio. And so, like
Launcelot, he has a livery more guarded than the rest.”
“Never mind Launcelot,” said I. “How was DISRAELI nearly
nowhere?” - - -
“You shall hear the story. There is a great moral in it, specially for
M.P.'s. On the Third Reading of the Jews' Bill, DISRAELI staid at
home. As the debate went on, the Hebrew hero—thinking of what he
had said upon the question, what he had written—got smaller, and
smaller, and smaller. The longer the House talked, the less he s
and shrank. By the time the House divided, BENJAMIN DISRAELI,
Esq., M.P. for Bucks, had got so small, he was invisible to the naked
eye.”
“Nonsense! Impossible.” - -
“Quite true. After a time, he was discovered—little bigger than the
smallest grease-spot—in the seat of his library chair. His faithful valet,
by means of a veryHº opera-glass, brought him again to light.
As the Member for Bu -
his former size, the house reverberated with voices from the east,
—‘BENJAMIN, BENJAMIN, where are your brothers?’”
“But now,” said I, “MR. DisrAELI is as big as ever?”
cks gradually grew under the glass, returning to
“Impossible; any man, made so little by deserted principles, let him
live on manna and drink the milk of Paradise,_can never return to his
former size.” -
Saying this, MR. LovELACE went upon his beat, and I to pen, ink,
and paper. Your's, Mr. Punch, M. B.
“The days of magic are not over, Miss BENIMBLE,” said LovELACE,
with an ominous smile. “You shall hear. You see, it was decided on
a certain occasion, that Sidonia should give up the Jews; should cut
from them in the desert, leaving 'em to be devoured by the INGLISEs
HINTS FOR ALMANACK-MAKERS.
PROPHETIC Almanacks would be very excellent speculations, but
for the unfortunate fact that the prophecies never come
true, and thus the only value of these works consists in the
strong probability that they may be relied upon as fore-
telling the exact opposite of what will really happen. This
gives them a kind of negative worth; but people who want
to know what’s what, or what will be what, are not so
easily satisfied at being told what’s not, and looking at the
future in rus as a sort of gerund in do, the do being a tre-
mendous do on the part of the dealers in prophecy.
The truth is, that the Almanack-makers and weather-
predicters have been thrown out by the late vagaries of
the season, which have completely disturbed the usual order
of precedence among the months, and allowed May to take
the place of January at the Weather Table, as presided
over by the individuals whose delight it is to watch the
temperature, and “when found make a note on it.”
The mistake of the Almanack-makers, who attempt to
predict the periods of hot and cold, has consisted in their
being guided by the ordinary rules which the seasons
themselves have combined to unceremoniously repudiate.
December, for example, instead of being represented as
an old gentleman shivering amid frost and snow, should
be drawn in the lawyer-like act of “settling a draught"
of cyder under a powerful sun, while May should be shown in furs and tippets, as if prepared
for singing the favourite Christmas song of Tippetywitchet.
GENIAL MAY.
ICY DECEMBER,
LORD BROUGHAMPS UNANIMITY.
If LoRD BRough AM cannot always be consistent, or in other words
agree with himself, the manner in which he agrees with every body else
is sometimes quite remarkable. The other day, when the judgment was
being given on the appeal of the Irish state prisoners, the Lord CHAN-
CELLOR had no sooner finished speaking, than LoRD BRough AM got up
to agree with * word he said; # directly LoRD LYNDHURST
opened his mouth, LoRD BROUGHAM rose to agree, by anticipation, with
every syllable; but when LoRD CAMPBELL uttered half an observation,
LoRD BROUGHAM once more darted up to agree, the unanimity being
in this case truly wonderful. Not satisfied with having agreed in turn
with all the authorities present, he went out of his way to agree with
the Irish judges, and one would have thought from the proceedings on
this occasion that LoRD BROUGHAM was the most agreeable as well as
the most entertaining member of the Peerage.
EVIDENT SYMPTOMS OF IMPROVEMENT.
WE were thunderstruck at meeting, in the Debates, the following
extraordi line:–
“MR. ANSTEY said a few words.”
We read on, making sure that the few words would consist at least
of five or six columns, when, to our utter astonishment, we found they
scarcely extended to so many lines. We like to speak approvingly of
any amendment we notice in a public character, and therefore glory
in being the first to attract, notice to the very sensible improvement
that has so unexpectedly taken place in MR. CHIsholm ANSTEY. We
rejoice always in encouraging rising merit, and are happy in assuring
the Honourable Member for Youghal, that, if he can only make up his
mind to refrain from speaking altogether, he has the greatest chance of
becoming, with his great talent, a very general favourite. Till we saw these
| “few words,” we really did not know ANSTEY had got so much in him.

PUNCH, OR THE
20;
THE BATTLE OF THE OPERA.
(After ByRox's Description of the Battle of Waterloo.)
THERE was a sound—“”Tis JENNY LIND's last night!”
And England's capital had gathered then
Her beauty, rank, fashion, and wealth—and bright
The gas shone o'er fair women and spruce men.
A thousand heels kick’d anxiously, and when
A cry arose from some half-fainting swell,
Soft laughter rose—then kicks were heard again'
The door which had no knocker, nor a bell.
But hush!—hark!—a deep sound strikes half-way down Pell Mell.
Did ye not hear? Was it the bolt behind,
Or the cabs rattling o'er the stony street?
Open the door—the crowd is too confined;
It seems an age to wait. Oh, what a treat
To count the flying hours upon one’s feet !
But hark' that heavy sound comes forth once more;
The crowd appears its echo to repeat,
presses nearer, denselier than before:
Push | push it is! it is the Opera's opening door.
Within a little niche of that throng’d hall
Sate LUMLEY’s money-taker; he did hear
That union of sounds, the shriek, the squall,
Which fell with sound familiar on his ear;
And then he smiled when a clenched hand drew near
With a half-guinea, which he knew full well
Required a check the barriers to clear;--
A privilege which he alone could sell,
And many, to be foremost, struggling, gasping fell.
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering shawls, or fragments of a dress;
And skirts all torn, which but an hour ago
Might well be called the pink of tidiness.
And there were sudden partings in the press
Of ladies from their beaur, and opera ties
Were rudely torn asunder—more or less:
.No longer fit to meet fastidious eyes,
Which on so grand a night are sure to criticise.
And there was mounting in hot haste the stairs
Qf towering Gallery and up-raised Pit,
And pouring forward to the Stalls—those chairs
- In which subscribing dilettanti sit
And show their connoisseurship and their wit.
A tuning’s heard of violins and drums:
BALFE comes—of perfect Band conductor fit.
- Some ill-bred persons º with "Fried thumbs;
A whisper runs around-‘The QUEEN" she always comes.
And now the baton waves above the leaves
Qf MEYERBEER’s grand music—at each pass
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er Fieves,
Over the unreturning LIND-alas!
Before the morning cut away like grass.
The crowd on every side, above, below,
Packed close in one enthusiastic mass
Qf expectation, cannot bear to know,
| The idol they have raised, wills her own overthrow.
Last Season saw her full of artist life,
Last week saw her La Figlia proudly gay:
Rumour announced her an intended wife,
A wedding fixed for a too early day,
Qn which she would be spirited away.
The curtain's cloud has dropp'd-the air is rent—
The stage is covered thick with a display
Of bouquets, as from a BRIAREUs sent;
Gallery, pit, box, stall, in one loud “bravo” blent.
Their shouts are heard in louder tones than mine;
Yet, ere I from that tumultuous throng,
The Nightingale I’ll trouble with one line,
Because I think her resolution wrong.
The pure can hallow operatic song,
And she was of the purest:-virtue rare is
In a profession, now debased too long.
A vicious i. will oft embarrass :
It could not taint a breast like thine, young JENNY——HARRIs.

TELLING THE CHARACTER TO A HAIR.
WE have had, in our own times and
in former times, a variety of methods
Fº for telling the character
rom the ordinary test of phrenology,
which professes to judge of your ca-
pacities by your bumps, or, in other
words, declares that you are sure not
to like a pursuit if you do not happen
to lump it, also; but there is some-
thing startling in a proposition that
has just been advertised, to describe
the character of an individual by ex-"
amining a lock of his hair. We can
comprehend physiognomy, which
affects to get a scent of one's dis-
position from one's nose, and to sa
whether he will succeed in life wit
a hook, or be snubbed by Fortune
with a snub; we can see some show
of reason in attempting to read one's
future by the light of palmistry, which
| may guide us as to what we ought to turn our hands to; but to tell the
character by a lock of hair seems to savour of absurdity. Suppose, for |
instance, every lock has bolted, is it to be presumed that the individual
has scared his hair away by leading a hair-um scare-um life; or would it
be said of a writer or thinker, who had become prematurely bald, that
his writings and his thoughts had been mere balderdash? We should
|º glad to know whether a bald-headed man is supposed to have no
| character at all, or whether a lock of his wig-supposing him, to wear
one—would answer the purpose of home-grown hair; or whether a
sample gathered from the remaining crop of his whiskers would furnish
|sufficient data for an inquirer to go upon. We shall behaving the corn;
cutters next proposing to tell characters by the cut of our corns, and
|indeed there seems to be no doubt, if the advertising chiropodists are to
be credited, that corns are a primáfacie evidence of high birth, for the
puffing announcements of certain operators are a regular cornucopia
of aristocracy. Almost every corn appears to be of noble extraction,
upon the authority of those who have fly. their attention to these
“in-elegant extracts.” We should scarcely be surprised at one of these
individuals proceeding to advertise the extraction of a corn from “the
|foot of the throne,” or the removal of a large quantity of corn from the
foot of Cornhill, and claiming credit for having cemented a good under-
standing between the Court and the City.

IN the course of Friday evening's proceedings in the House of Lords,
the EARL of GALLowAY is reported to have said that “he believed he
spoke good-humouredly;” upon which there was one cry of “Hear,
hear!”, which caused the EARL of GALLowAY to add, that “he
thanked the noble Lord for that cheer.”
We cannot help admiring the grateful disposition of the Peer who
declares himself thankful for such a very small, contribution to his
satisfaction, as a solitary shout of “Hear!” could have occasioned him.
Had not his Lordship deliberately repudiated the imputation of any-
thing like, vanity on the subject of his speeches, we should have
imagined that a cheer was as agreeable to him as applause to an actor–
and, by the way, we think the introduction of a regularly organised
claque might º that stimulus of outward approbation which the
etiquette of the house, and sometimes, the non-exciting quality of a
speech, prevents from being manifested by the audience. ----
If every Peer were allowed to write two double orders admitting
four authorised claqueurs, their Lordships might standby their orders as
ion, as their orders stood by them in the interchange of mutual support
encouragement.
THANK YOU FOR NOTHING.

The Shareholder's Best Friend.
A RAILway Directory, done on theP. of the Post-office Directory,
would be very useful, if it contained the names of all the Railway
Directors. It would be very handy at the present moment, for when a
public meeting takes place, it generally occurs that one or two Directors,
and sometimes the irman, are .# and no one knows where to
find them. The Railway Directory would supply this information, and
3. us the name and address of every Director. The frontispiece should
a view of Boulogne, whilst the vignette might shadow forth a distant
: of the Central Criminal Court. The cover ought to be
emblazoned with a fancy design (after LANDsh ER) of “the Stag at
Botany Bay.” A list of the most expert Detective Officers should also
be given with the Directory. It would sell “like fury.” NoShareholder
I would be without a copy of it.

Season, and serve in Lieu of Concerts and Shows to a Sort of People
, that call themselves serious. This, one of the Meetings of a Protestant
Association, which I had heard much of and did long to go to, expecting
to hear; some good Argument against the Roman Catholiques., But
instead of Argument, I did hear Nothing but Abuse, which do always
go in at one Ear and out at the other. No new Point brought forward
to confute Popery; but only an Iteration of the old Charges of Super-
stition and so forth, urged with no greater Power than mere Strength
of Lungs. The Commotions on the Continent last Year laid much
Stress on, and the Turmoils in Catholique and Quiet in Protestant
States contrasted, as though there had been no Disturbance or Trouble
in Prussia or Denmark, or any Tumult or Revolution in Belgium or
Portugal. I, did note two jº. whom, on their rising, the
Assembly did applaud as if the been Actors, and to be sure, they
ranted more frantically than I did ever see Hicks. Yet at Times they
stooped to Drollery in the Height of their Passion, and one of them did
make such Sport of the Roman Catholique Religion as would not have
been suffered in the Adelphi Theatre. But I do find that some who
would not be seen in a Play-House can enjoy their Laugh at Exeter
Hall. This Orator was a º of some Kind, for he was called
Reverend in the Hand-bill, and dressed in a clerical Habit, but, his
Eyes and Face blazing with Wrath, did storm like a Madman against
the Maynooth Grant and the Pope of RomE; and howled as fierce as

Wednesday, 1849. Went, this Morning to Exeter Hall, where one of
the May Meetings that do regularly take Place at this Time of the
a Hyaena. The other a Clergyman too, and looked as much like one,
with his sneering angry Yº: and did vehemently harangue, crying
bitterly out on some of m rds and the Members of the Commons
House that had voted for Popish Endowment. His Oration a \;
of Sarcasm, Invective, and Buffoonery, and wound up with a Flouris
of Patriotism and Loyalty. The Speeches received with"Applause and
Laughter, but also with Interruptions and crying to turn somebody out.
The Speakers on a Platform, whereon they bounced backwards, and
forwards, having Rails in Front as if to hinder them from breaking loose
on the Audience. Behind them a Crowd of dainty smooth Gentlemen in
Black, with white Neckerchiefs, and to see how demure they looked, as
if Butter would not melt in their Mouths! . In the Body of the Hall a
oodly Number of Heads, but by far the Most of them in Bonnets.
he two chief Speeches lasted an Hour and a Half each, and the
Chairman leaving his Seat, I away, my Head aching, through the
Raving. Such Violence, methinks, do only prove that there are other
Bigots besides Papists; and is the worst Means of enforcing i.

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG M.AN ABOUT TOWN.
MR. BROWN THE ELDER TAKES MR. BROWN THE YOUNGER. To A CLUB.
Wººlllliºl||
º
ROM the Library and Smoking:
room regions let us descend
to the lower floor. Here
you behold the Coffee-room,
where the meat little tables
are already laid out, awaiting
the influx of diners. . .
. A. great advance in civi-
lisation was made, and the
honesty. as well as . eco-
| nomy of young men of the
| middle classes immensely
promoted, when the ancient
tavern system was over-
thrown, and those houses of
meeting inst?tuted where a
man, without sacrificing his
dignity, could dine for a
couple of shillings. I re-
| member, in the days of my
| youth when a very moderate
|
dinner at a reputable coffee-
house cost a man hal -
fargui:
*Tarº | nea: when you were obliged
|ſiºnal | º to order a pint of wine for the
| | º | good of the *i; .. º:
||||||||||| arºſſilſill waiter got a shilling for his
|||| | |ill | ill. attendance; and when young
- gentlemen were no richer
than they are now, and had to pay thrice as much as they at present need to disburse
for the maintenance of their station.
Then men (who had not the half guinea at command,) used to dive into dark streets
in the vicinage of Soho or Covent Garden, and get a meagre meal at shilling taverns
—or ToM, the clerk, issued out from your Chambers, in Fº Court and brought
back your dinner between two plates from a neighbouring ham and beef shop.
Either repast was strictly honourable, and one can find no earthly fault with a poor
gentleman, for eating a poor meal. But that solitary meal in Chambers was indeed
ã dismal refection. I think with anything but regret of those lonely feasts of beef
| |
|
and cabbage; and how there was no resource for the long evenings but those books,
over which you had been poring all day, or the tavern with its deuced expenses, or
the theatre—a ſº. bachelor’s life was a clumsy piece of wretchedness then—mis-
managed and ill economised—just as your Temple Chambers or College rooms now
are, which are quite behind the age, in the decent conveniences which every modern
tenement possesses.
And that dining for a shilling and strutting about Pall Mall afterwards was, after
all, an hypocrisy. At the time when the Trois Frères Provençaur at Paris had two
entrances, one into the place of the Palais Royal, and one into the street behind,
where the sixteen sous dinner-houses are, I have seen bucks with profuse toothpicks
walk out of these latter houses of entertainment, pass up the Trois Frères stair, and
descend from the other door into the Palais Royal, so that the people walking there
might fancy these poor fellows had been diningregardless of expense. No; what you
call putting a good face upon poverty, that is, hiding it under a grin, or concealing its
rags under a make-shift, is always rather a base stratagem. Your Beaux Tibbs’s
and twopenny dandies can never be respectable altogether: and if a man is poor, I
say he ought to seem poor; and that both he and Society are in the wrong, if either
sees any cause of shame in §:
That is why I say we ought to be thankful for Clubs. Here is no ºl. to get
a cheap dinner: no ordering of expensive liquors and dishes for the good of the
house, or cowering sensitiveness as to the opinion of the waiter. We advance in
simplicity and honesty as we advance in civilisation, and it is my belief that we
become better bred and and less artificial, and tell more truth every day.
This you see, is the Club Coffee-room—it is three o'clock, young WIDEAwake
is just finishing his breakfast (with whom I have nothing to do at present, but to say
parenthetically, that if you will sit up till five o'clock in the morning, BoB, my boy,
you may lookout to have a headache and a breakfast at three in the afternoon).
WIDEAwake is at breakfast—Goldsworthy is ordering his dinner—while
MR. NUDGIT, whom you see yonder, is making his lunch. In those two gentlemen
13 º moral and exemplification of the previous little remarks which I have been
making.
You must know, Sir, that at the Polyanthus, in common with most Clubs, gentle-
men are allowed to enjoy, gratis, in the Coffee-room, bread, beer, sauces, and pickles.
After four o'clock, if you order your dinner, you have to pay sixpence for what is
called the table—the clean cloth, the vegetables, cheese, and so forth : before that
hour you may have lunch, when there is notable charge.
. Now, Goldsworthy is a gentleman and a man of genius, who has courage and
simplicity anqugh to be poor—not like some fellows whom one meets, and who make
a fanfaronnade of poverty, and draping themselves in their rags, seem to cry, “See
how virtuous, I am,_how honest DIOGENEs is]" but he is a very poor man, whose
education and talents are of the best, and who in so far claims to rank with the very
best people in the world. In his place in Parliament, when
he takes off his hat (which is both old and well brushed, the
Speaker's eye is pretty sure to meet his, and the House
listens to him with the º which is due to so much
honesty and talent...He is the equal of any man, however
lofty or wealthy. His social position is rather improved by
his É. and the world, which is a manly and generous
world in its impulses, howeverit may be in its practice, con-
templates with a sincere regard and admiration MR. Golds-
worthy’s manner of º: his lack of fortune. He is
going to dine for a shilling; he will have two mutton chops
(and the mutton chop is a thing unknown in domestic life
and in the palaces of epicures, where }. may get cutlets
dressed with all sorts of French sauces, but not the admirable
mutton chop), and with a due allowance of the Club bread
and beer, he
and excellent
Ministers this very night.
Now -
spectacle to behold. Trespect Mr. Goinsworthy with all
my heart, without sharing those ultra-conservative political
opinions, which we all know he entertains, and from which
no interest, temptation, or hope of place will cause him to
swerve: and you see he is waited upon with as much respect
here, as old SILENUs, though he order the most sumptuous
banquet the cook can devise, or bully the waiters ever so.
But ah, Bob' what can we say of the conduct of that
poor little MR. NUDGIT? . . He has a bed-chamber in some
court unknown in the neighbourhood of the Polyanthus. He
makes a breakfast with the Club bread and beer: he lunches
off the same ºr. being of an Epicurean taste, look
what he does—he is actually pouring a cruet of anchovy
sauce over his bread to give it a flavour; and I have seen
the unconscionable little £º sidle off to the pickle
jars when he thought nobody was observing, and Fº a
walnut or a half dozen of pickled onions into his mouth, and
swallow them with a hideous furtive relish.
He disappears at dinner time, and returns at half-past
seven or eight o'clock, and wanders round the tables when
the men are at their dessert and generous over their wine.
He has a number of little stories about the fashionable
world to tell, and is not unentertaining. When you dine
here, sometimes give NUDGIT a glass, or two Qut of your
decanter, Bob, my boy, and comfort his poor old soul. He
was a gentleman once and had money, as he will be sure to
tell you. He is mean and feeble, but not unkind—a poor
little parasite not to be unpitied. Mr. NUDGIT, allow me
É. introduce you to a new member, my nephew, MR. Robert
ROWN.
At this minute old SILENUs swaggers in, bearing his great
waistcoat before him, and walking up to the desk where the
coffee-room clerk sits and where the bills of fare are dis-
played. As he passes he has to undergo the fire of MR.
Goldsworthy's eyes, which dart out at him two flashes of
the most killing scorn. He has passed by the battery without
sinking, and lays himself alongside the desk. , Nupg|It
. him, and will presently go up smirking humbly to
JOln him.
“HUNT,” he says, “I want a table, my table, you know,
at seven—dinner for eight—LoRD HobANOB dines with me
—send the butler—What’s in the bill of fare P Let’s have
clear soup and turtle—I’ve sentit in from the city-dressed
fish and turbot,” and with a swollen trembling hand he
writes down a pompous bill of fare.
. As I said, NUDGIT comes up simpering, with a newspaper
in his hand.
“Hullo, NUDG!” says MR. SILENUs, “how's the beer?
Pickles good to day ?”
NUDGIT smiles in a gentle deprecatory manner.
“Smell out a good dinner, hey, NUDGP” says DIVEs.
“If any man knows how to give one, you do,” answers
the poor beggar. “I wasn’t a bad hand at ordering a
dinner myself, once; what’s the fish in the list to-day?”
and with a weak smile he casts his eye over the bill of fare.
LORD HoBANop dines with me, and he knows what a
; dinner is, I can tell you,” says MR. SILENUs, “so
oes CRAMLEY.”
“Both well-known epicures,” says NUDGIT. -
“I’m going to give HobANob a return dinner to his at
the Rhododendrum. He bet me that BATIFol, the chef at
the Rhododendrum, did better than our man can. HoB's
dinner was last Wednesday, and f don't say it wasn't a
ſº one; or that taking GRosbois by surprise, is giving
im quite fair play—but we’ll see, NUDGIT. I know what
GRosbois can do.”

“I should think you did, indeed, SILENUs,” says the other.
“I see your mouth’s watering. I’d ask you, only I know you’re
engaged. "You’re always engaged, Nudgit–Not to-day? We then,
ou may come; and I say, MR. NUDGIT, we’ll have a wet evening,

MR. Bowls, the butler, here coming in, MR. SILENUs falls into con-

has got his dinner. He will go and walk in the Park to get up an
appetite. And now, MR. Bob, having shown you over your new house,
I too will bid you for the present farewell.
FRAGMENT OF A MAGYAR EPIC.
(Translated from the original of JAUoscHAzAczsky.)
AND now thy skin-clad warriors appear,
Blue lake Sketzsasik fair Huschauschamear!
Where rolls the Pruth his crystal wave along,
And Choczim hears the patriot’s gathering song:
Nor stony Schernetescht declines the war,
Nor Szohisks her sons, nor stern Sztroczhar,
Whom brave TschatschAkz from flat Rustschuckcha's plain,
Leads, bloody laurels under BEM to gain.
Serenely stern they laugh at Austrian claims,
Austria, that cannot e'en pronounce their names!
Long had they marched, since from Kaczsienjk’s old tower,
They heard the tocsin toll the midnight hour;
Faintly they moved and slow, yet nothing sad,
Although refreshments were not to be had.
And now on the horizon, faintly seen,
Rise Isazech's grey towers, and poplars green,
Whose mouldering walls have ed long the boast
Of SchLICK's and JELLACHIch's united host.
Hold on, brave sons of Isazecin for now
Hungarian bayonets glint o'er Bozsasch's brow;
Weave, maids of Isazech, the conqueror's wreath
For valiant KLAPKA, and his band of death!
Near and more near, the wish’d relief draws nigh;
Przeemyst’s sons their trusty rifles ply,
And Droszeg's tirailleurs, beneath whose hail,
Even the red-clad Szerezzaner quail,
Till back on Szalba-Egerszegg they fall,
And draw safe breath beneath its sheltering wall.
Grant to thy votary, O Magyar Muse,
The spell'd as spo’en of Fonetic Nug;
While he essays to twine the civic bay,
For those who fought on red Isazech’s day;
And bids each genuine Magyar sadly turn
To Sziskszo's corse, and BīAGowitzchyEN's urn.
Higaschnemelhi weeps her PAGozdsch slain;
Ne'er to Plevlicksk shall KLINDsCH return again;
And Niskiki, reſt of her gallant GLIM,
Qurses fierce HARDEGG, and his Honveds grim.
But dearly purchased was thy life, Szokol,
And thine, stout MILKosch, of enduring soul;
Five fell round each of FIEDLER's fierce brigade,
And drunk with blood was CNYzkscHI’s damask'd blade.
Fº reading the above fluently, shall receive a file of the

THE GOOD TIME MOVEMENT.
We are afraid that the Good Time Move-
ment is retarded by a sort of ralen-
tando, leading to an andantissimo,
which causes the Good Time to be
exceedingly slow in coming.
Though we have not much sym-
pathy with anything in the shape
of a fast man, we are disposed to
patronise a party of enthusiasts
who have, we understand, formed
themselves into a Society for acce-
lerating the Good Time which we
have been promised for the last
year, in a song that has been dinned
into our ears in every variety of
key, and in all sorts of voices...The
Society in question, is exceedingly
- sanguine in its views, as will easily
be seen when we state the designs they hope to realise.
One of their first expectations, is the completion of the Bassi-relievi
of the Nelson Column, a project which s for itself as a freak of
fancy almost unparalleled for its wild, extravagance. This tremendous
work, which has already witnessed the transformation of mature age
into senility, and the ripening of childhood into adolescence—which
has, in fact, “used up” º man and the boy, who figured in the early
pages of Punch–this apparently impossible achievement the enthu-
siasts we have alluded to, expect to bring to completion.
Another of their º ideas is the drying up of the Trafalgar
Fountains by either the sponge of science, the mop of mechanical con-
trivance, or some other absorbent of equal power and efficiency. These
fountains which have, so often brought a tear into the eye of the spec-
tator when the wind has been blowing in his face—these fountains to
which we have given many a º". be speedily wiped out if the
would-be expeditors of the GoodTime, are fortunate in the fulfilment
of their wishes. - - - - -
Perhaps, hºwever, the most patriotic of their plans is the removal of
the National Gallery, whose pepper-boxes we have so liberally pep

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PROPHECIES FOR THE DERBY.
Punch Office, May 19, 1849.
WE had intended prophesying about the winner of the Derby, but
really the thing has º: as common as a “Shower, of Frogs” in
autumn, a “Monster Gooseberry” in spring, or a Revolution in Paris.
We do not mind º: on the following prophecies,
because we are confident they all will come true, or if a few do
not, they will be sure to come in next year. That, is the essential
beauty of a prophecy; if it is not exactly verified today, it will be to:
morrow, or next month, or next year, or at all events at some period
or other before you die, and leave this betting world for a better.
Out of every hundred young men who go down by the railway, not
one will think of taking provisions with him, but they will all trust to
the chance “of meeting with a friend on the course.”.
Several young men will be waiting at the Regent Circus froman early
hour in morning, bargaining with every coach to see how cheap
º can go down, when, from ºf it off to the very last, they
will certainly be taken for one half the money, only they will
the Downs somewhere about an hour after the Derby has been run.
A talented Jewsboy will derive a handsome profit from the sale of
corkscrews to such carriages as make an annual custom of pro
themselves with everything but the aforesaid article in question.
Aloud cry of, “Down with that parasol!” will be heard just as the
rby is being run. -- - -
Bets to avery large amount will change hands; but it is very question-
able whether a single pair of gloves, out of the thousands that will be
lost by the young ladies, will ever do the same. - -
. A little dog, as soon as the course is cleared, willimmediately appear
in the º space, and do a little running on its own account, in which
it will be y well backed by every one present. The race
between the little dog and the Police, will be extremely diverting, as
long as it lasts, and the pace will be kept up with great vigour on both
sides; but the poor animal will ultimately be beaten, and the intrepid
A, (by Chance out of Area), be declared the winner.
Boys’ schools will be drawn out in lines of three deep over the
garden walls at Clapham, and will make wry faces at the * and the
peas that are fired at them by the flying carriages, but will laugh under
their large clean collars whenever the usher is hit, or his hat is knocked
off by a particularly well-aimed knock-me-down. -
The housemaids along the road, will be sure to have their best caps
on, and will be cleaning the windows, or making the beds, or answering
the gate-bell, all day long.
A postilion with a white hat (we forbear mentioning his name, but
he will have top-boots on) will take a “little drop too much,” and wi
cause much confusion and animadversion, amongst the vehicles behind,
by locking the wheels of his carriage inside those of an advertising-van,
and upsetting it across the road.
The pikemen will §. prodigies of good temper; but as usual
will insist, through thick and thin, upon having their own way, and will
maintain it, too, by closing the gate as often as a carriage is not
inclined to pay twice over. -
The fast º; gentleman, who goes down with a tandem, will find
great difficulty in driving it home. The leader will keep turning round,
and this eccentric movement being freely indulged in, will make the
wheeler very giddy, and create considerable confusion by this new mode
of “spinning ” home from the Derby.
Several spoons will be missing, and several clerks be absent from
their duties the following day *f; whole road will be strewed with
that coarse, ill-grained commodity, called “chaff,” as, thickly as the
circle at AstLEY’s is strewed with saw-dust; * will tell fortunes,
and lordlings, as yet “green” upon the 1. , will lose them; the
Settling Day at TATTERSALL’s will be a day of great unsettlement to
several, many a rising star of fashion will on that day sink for ever in
the Levant; “noble captains” will abound, with the usual number of
my handsome ladies,” “fine young gentlemen” and “DowLING's
Correct Lists” of the last year sold for the present.
If our prophecies do not come true, may Punch be left far behind
in the ruck, and no longer hold the position he has always maintained
in the race for popular favour of ENGLAND’s FAvourite'
Specimen Meanings for Irish Members.
MoUNTEBANK. A. Man, who will not hesitate to eat fire, but will not
swallow his own words. -
VIPER. A. creature that attacks either the Irish Members, or any

trust the noble Lord will give a
plain answer to a plain question.
: RAILWAY COOKERY.
THE art of cookery has been carried to the very highest pitch during
the last year or two, and we really think that a ſittle fortune might be
made 3. a Railway Cookery i. under the editorship of some one
thoroughly well versed in the mystery. Hashes seem to have been the
favourite dishes with the Railway Cooks, but the last granddish has been
“calves' head surprised,” which has been the result of a fº. serving
out of the shareholders. What the domestic cooks call “stock,” has
been an important item in the railway cuisine, and a good deal has been
done by boiling everyt º until bubbles, rose to the top, when all the
surface was skimmed off, and though the guests swallowed it with
avidity as long as there was a morsel of fatto be had, they are clamorous
il when they find that the steam cookery has left them nothing but hot
water at the bottom.
“BULL’S NEW SYSTEM.”
A LIVELY young bull from Smithfield entered a pawnbroker's shop in
Farringdon Street, and swallowed three bunches of duplicates. A
dreadful contest ensued., The pawnbroker insisted upon sending the
bull up the spout, and *::::: him there till the twelvemonth had
expired; but the butcher would not pledge himself, or his bull, either,
to any such pro . It is difficult to say how the matter would have
ended, if the had not opportunely come to their help, and tossed them
all round for it. The effort, however, was too much for him. The i.
died in the course of the same evening, and, upon his chest
being examined, was found to be worth l warming pan, 6 pair of boots,
24 flat-irons, 1 iron bedstead, 1 brass footman, 2 dumpy levels, lgarden
roller, and no end of medical instruments; the entire amount of which
had been entered in the names of the different members of the extensive
family of SMITH, and was valued at the united sum of £42s, 73d. The
whole of this property was left to the butcher, but he very handsomely
has handed it over to the pawnbroker, who at present holds it intrust
for the Johns, Thom Ases, and Edwards of the family above named.

A CONSIDERATE O'CONNELL.
THE members of the O'Conn ELL family are not remarkable for their
over-delicate regard to the feelings of others, but on Friday night last
MR. JoHN O'Connell really performed an act of courtesy and philan-
thropy which we should never have given him credit for. Being about
to speak, he actually had the humanity to put in force the standing order
for the exclusion of strangers, which at once spared the reporters the
infliction of having to listen to his harangue, and saved them the further
trouble of taking it down, while it released the newspaper reading world
in general from the bore of perusing it. Mr. John O'Connell would
entitle himself to the thanks of the Press, and even of the country at
his legs, unless the standing order against the presence of strangers is
enforced, as it was last Friday. There is certainly some inconvenience
in the loss to the public of a knowledge of what might be interesting and
valuable from the lips of other honourable Members, but still, to escape
the infliction of one dull and empty harangue, is an advantage that is
worth paying for.
WE “PAUSE FOR A REPLY.”

Miss BENIMBLE's TEA-AND-ToAST.
PRINCE ALBERT's GRACIOUs APPEARANCE IN THE SERVANTs' HALL.
– THE OXFORD TRUMPET. – ROME AND EXETER-HALL. -LORD
BROUGHAM AND THE APOLLO.-The Thim. BLE FUND.
EAR MR PUNCH,-I couldn’t think what was the matter
with MR. LovELACE, when he last dropped in. He’d
a smile on his face like a new guinea, and kept rubbing
his hands one round the other, as if he was washing
U ’em in otto of roses. “Been anywhere partic'lar?” says
|A L. “Why, yes, ma'am,” says LoyELACE, beginning to
| coax the tip of his nose—as he’s a habit—with his right
# thumb and two first fingers, “Yes, ma'am, I’ve been
on duty—and I may say the duty was a pleasure. I
have been, Miss BENIMBLE, to over Square.”
Whereupon, my woman's heart beat with a bounce,
and sent the words to my mouth. “I see it;” says I. “You’ve been
to St. George's Church, and the world’s no better than a cinder-heap—
JENNY LIND is married. The nightingale has put her neck in the
wedding-ring, and we may all go into short mourning.”
“It’s very odd,” says LovELACE. “But my’pinion is, that the third
thought of every woman is, always going to the altar: It’s a crotchet
of mine, that every female baby comes into the world with the whole
marriage-service ready printed in it’s little head, besides all the figures
of the quadrilles, the fashions of the month, the ”—
“Nonsense!” says L. “And suppose it was so, what them f
Marriage is .." you creatures. But what a weight it is upon
us! You may laugh, MR. LovELACE: I’m sure of it. . HYMEN makes
fetters of adamant—if I may be allowed the word—for we women:
while, for you men, they’re nothing more than a chain of buttercups
and daisies. For it doesn’t hold you—and you know it doesn't.”
“Can't say,” said LovELACE, stirring his tea. “I’ve never yet been
married.” (And, upon my word, Mr. Punch, at that little word YET-
for I did suspect him to be a widower, he’s so shy of marriage—at that
little word my heart went against my breast like a wild bird in a cage).
“And,” says he, going on—“and I hav’n’t been to St. George's Church.
Though, I’ve heard in Scotland Yard, that when Miss LIND is married
the force—foot and horse—is to line the streets, with cutlasses
ball-cartridge, to awe down the mob. And the Duke, who will of
course give the bride away, as Lieutenant of the Tower, has promised
a small park of artillery to make rescue impossible.”
“But where have you been º’” says I. -
“I’ve been to Hanover Square Rooms, and heard PRINCE ALBERT.
Upon my life, his Royal Highness is it. quite into a PITT–growing
to a very Fox.” (I stared, but said nothing; what could LovELACE
mean?) “He made a speech that was really beautiful.”
“What about P’ says I.
“Why, about the “Servants' Provident and Benevolent Society.’
Not a drip-drip speech, filtered drop by drop, but a flowing silver
stream of sweet fine sense.”
Well, Mr. Punch, I did stare., “I never thought, MR. LovELACE
º “to hear you talk in this way of any Prince in the ºversal
world.”
“There’s the mistake, Miss BENIMBLE. It’s one thing for to go
down upon one's knees and make an idol of human clay, and another to
take one's hat off, and make a seemly bow to a good man, doing goodness
with a grace that makes even the good the better for the courtesy.”
“Go on,” says I, not caring to answer him. “What’s the Society
for *-not but what I shall read all about it.”
“The Society is to put in the way of domestic servants—and there is
a million of 'em, says LoRD Russell—the means of defying the Union
in their old age : the means of independence ”—
... It must be in a very small way,” says I.
“It’s the beauty of the spirit of independence,” says LovELACE
boldly, “always to double a little. It’s a wonderful spirit, quite a
º, fairy, and any day makes half-a-crown go as far as five
snıllıngs. -
“And how did the Prince-la, bless us! to think he should come
from Buckingham Palace; from the silver tea-pot of, her blessed
Majesty—how did the Prince speak up for the servants **
“Beautifully,” says. LovELACE, his cheek, flushing. “He asked
whose heart would fail to sympathise with those who minister to us
for all the wants of daily life—who attend us during sickness—who
receive us on our first, appearance in this world, and extend their
care even to our mortal remains—who live under our roof, form our
household, and are a part of our family?’”
“Did the Prince say all that?” says I, and I do assure you I felt in
łº, glow just as if I’d swallowed mulled wine. “Did he say all
a
... And twenty times as much, and all as good,” said LovELACE.
... “Well then,” says I, “here’s his Royal Highness's health, though
it’s only humble Twankay.”
“The Prince is really a wise young man,” says LovELACE. “He’s
lº up a name for himself, better than all the marble busts, and
bronze horses in the world. , I’m glad he’s given up the business of
hatter. He'll make a much better job of it, with hearts than hats. Why
even the smallest tiger will feel himself somebody, when he knows
he’s cared for in this way.”
“Don’t talk of tigers,” says I. “Think of the cooks, and the house-
maids, and the maids of all-work, Think of them, MR. Lovejºcº
“I do,” says he. •+ -
“How they will love the Prince " . He'll reign in the very heart of
the kitchen | For when MoLLY black-leads her grate, she’ll think of
the lustre of her Prince, and the stove will be the brighter for it. When
SUsAN cleans the windows, she’ll breathe a blessing , on his Royal
Highness, and the glass will shine like a diamond. And the speech
wasn’t a short one but long f" says I.
“Long,” says LovELACE. “Long, and like a silver eel, bright from
º: º tail. LoRD RUSSELL, too, spoke well. And the Bishop of
xford ”—
“What did Oxford say? I’m sure.”—says I– “he talked a lump of
honey. To hear him speak, why it’s like the gurgling out of salad oil.”
44. #º says LovELACE. “Why, the Bishop said that, “if the folks
present supported the Society, they would give to his Royal Highness
the best proºf that they were sensible of the great favour, he had con-
ferred on the Society by being present on the occasion l’. Now the
Prince's speech was so true, so manly, such a real thing, that—to my
sense—this flourish of the Bishop's trumpet came in a little bold and
brassy.”
44 †. Bishop meant well,” says I, taking his part.
“No doubt,” says LovELACE, “and so does my dog. Fop; but he's
got such a bad habit, that though it goes against me, I’m obliged now
and then to kick him in the stomach.” (It was his very word, Mr. Punch.)
t Begging your pardon, MR. LovELACE,” says I, with a laugh, “you’re
a brute.”
“Great provocation, Miss BENIMPLE. You see, sometimes, when
I’m drest, and my boots shine like looking-glasses, that spaniel, Fº to
show his love, will come about my feet, and lick the blacking off. Poor
thing! he may mean it for affection; but for all that, it’s only slaver.”
“Why, you didn't intend to insinuate of the Bishop ”—
“I insinuate nothing, Ma'am,” says LovELACE., “But I will boldly
say this: when the Prince next presides, I hope the Bishop will leave
his Royal Highness alone. I’m sure the thing is much better simple;
without the Oxford mixture.”
“Talking of Oxford,” º I, “it leads one mat’rally to Rome. Dread-
ful state of things there, MR. LovELACE. All sorts of bombs firing into
St. Peter's. Pictures riddled like colanders; and statues with their
limbs knocked all to pieces.”
“Why, they do say, but I don't believe it,” says LovELACE, “that
the Rºi the APOLLO BELVIDERE has been knocked off by a French
cannon-ball; and that LORD BROUGHAM, in the handsomest way, has
offered his own bust to repair the damage. Only think, BROUGHAM to
be continued in Apollo.”
“Dreadful,” says I. “But, altogether, what a shocking thing!
They’ve burnt the cardinals' carriages, and’—
“Humph '" says LovELACE. “ f wonder what sort of carriage
PETER rode in—if any, I suppose, a fish-cart.”
“Now, MR. LovELACE, I won’t have any such dispersion. But the
fact is, you go to Exeter Hall so often, that you haven’t a bit of respect
for anything that’s of Rome. I do think even a Roman nose is a sin in
your eyes.”
“Quite a mistake,” says LovELACE. “Besides, Rome is now quite
the pet of Exeter Hall. Or if it, isn't, it ought to be:
PLUMPTRE himself wouldn’t give it the Pope more lustily than
MAzzINI. What says the triumvir to the French P Why, I’ve heard
the same thing—though by no means in such noble, drum-beating words,
—a thousand times in the Strand. What does he say? He says—‘Ask
those time-honoured monuments of the ever glorious Fº and they will
tell you they have been soiled and too long sullied by a sacerdotal
despotism. Question our women and our youth, and they will tell of
the seductions, of the debaucheries, of the barter and sale of consciences
and of chastity, of which a black clerical band of impostors has made
them the victims.’”
“Well,” says I, “how could I have missed that ? Why, MAzzINI
beats NEWDEGATE to bits' The Scarlet Lady”—
“The Scarlet Lady,” says LovELACE, “may send her robes to be dyed
in LUTHER's ink, Rome seems to give her up. What do you think
read in the Daily News—(and, by the way, all the letters in the News
are capitally written; penned by a strong Roman light)—I read that
the church confessional boxes—the places where folks poured their sins
into monks' gaping ears—those very boxes go to make barricades.”
“I’m delighted to hear it,” says I. “Only to think of those boxes,
makes me shiver.” -
“'Twould be droll, wouldn't it, if in one of 'em, King Bombastes of
Naples—LoRD BRough AM's cheerful friend—if just by the fortune of
war, his Majesty was shriven W a Roman bullet, and made a clean
breast of it to Father Death. Very droll, eh, Miss BENIMBLE **

It would be unfair to provide the ground-

But a Republic's President should be

en Rome shook off her priestly yoke,
What right had you to put your spoke,
I to ask you, in her common weal?
at ground had you for interference,
When of the Pope she made a clearance?
Pray, who call'd you with her affairs to deal?
e Romans may be right or wrong,
I don't care which, in turning PIUs out,
And sending all the Cardinals alon
With that good Pontiff to the right about;
Butlet them choose their form of government,
And what’s the odds, so long as they’re content?
Are you to cram down their reluctant gullets,
The kind of Constitution you think best,
By means of swords, and bayonets, and bullets?
Against such t y I must protest.
º wonder you’ve the cheek
To about your République.
In dignity you merit an advance;
There is a post which you are fitter far
To fill than to be PRESIDENT of FRANCE;
Instead of that, you ought to be the CzAR.
The Roman people to coerce and menace,
You send your howitzers and bombs,
With OUDINOT to play the modern BRENNUs—
. What of this intervention comes?
Disgrace, defeat, in point of fact
Your troops got regularly whack'd.
How could they stand against a foe that sung
The %. or fail to be
Taken aback dumbfoundered, and unstrung,
Met with Mourir pour la Patrief --
To chaunt such strainstill they are hoarse,
The citizens of France must know their brothers
Of Rome, possess the right, of course,
As perfectly as any others;
Also to dance and caper at their pleasures,
Round Trees of Liberty in sportive measures:
In short, their own Republic to enjoy,
So long as other folks º don’t annoy.
All well for you, if France shall acquiesce
Quietly in her own stultification;
If not, you’ve f yourself into a mess,
From which I wish you happy extrication.
THE COOLEST THING IN THE WORLD.
We have at last met with what strikes us as being literally about
the coolest thing we ever met with in the course of our life. Our old
friend the Cucumber, that has stood “framed and glazed” as the
picture of coolness for many a long year, and has given rise to the
standard comparison “as cool as a cucumber,” must now retire into
private life, and we have no doubt the Cucumber will be very much cut
up at what we are about to communicate.
The extreme coolness to which we have to call attention, is the
coolness of agentleman at the bar of the Central Criminal Court, who
being wanted unfortunately in two Courts at once—because he had
taken briefs that required his attendance in two Courts at once—coolly
observed that, “he couldn't help it; his client in the other Court was
perfectly innocent, but must be convicted, and the Home Secretary
must be applied to for redress.” All this seems to us astonishingly
cool, when we refleet, that, by simply declining to take more briefs than
he could attend to, the learned gentleman might have prevented the
cºnviction of the innocent man, and the necessity of an appeal to the
Home. Office, to remedy an evil which would appear to have been
caused by counsel having given an implied pledge of ubiquity, which of
course could not be #. -
There may possibly be some mistake in the report of the proceedings;
but as they stand recorded in the daily 3. the circumstances

i.º.º.º.º. iring him to be in
two places at once; but being le, to accomplish #: duality of
§ which would be very convenient in conjunction with the alleged
duality of mind which is said to exist, he coolly avowed that his immo-
|cent client in the next Court must be found, guilty, and that, the
|Secretary of State must repair the injury inflicted by a barrister taking
|two fees, when he could only earn one of them.
The coolness of this proceeding, if true, is really almost Wenham-ous
in its character; for we doubt if even Wenham ice could equal it in its
| own peculiar way; and we think the Hill Coolies themselves scarcely
deserve their name so completely as those extraordinary lies of the
|bar, who take briefs in several Courts, without the possibility of
performing the services for which the quiddam is paid to them.

RECREATIONS IN SPAIN.
Ust glancing over the Morning Post we saw a
rather pleasing picture of the innocent enjoy-
ments of the people of Spain, in the shape
of a raph, }. best part of which we
subjoin, piecemeal, stringing Spanish wag-
geries together like Spanish onions.
“The long talked-of match between the Bengal tiger
and the bull, which has occupied so much attention,
even of royalty, has just come off, and ended in the
defeat and death of the Eastern savage.”
Now the idea of calling the Bengal tiger a
savage in comparison § such a public and
a Court as the Spanish, is droll indeed.
“A vast multitude assembled to witness the extra-
ordinary spectacle, at which the King and Queen were
also present.”
Fine sport for their Majesties; finer for their Majesties’ subjects.
Some idea may be formed of the intensity of the fun, by imagining our
Gracious QUEEN and PRINCE honouring the “canine” arena with their
presence.
“On being released from its cage, the tiger made a few steps, and then crouched
down as if about to spring.”
A pretty little piece of pantomime by the Spanish clown in the ring—
the buffoon in stripes instead of motley. But, as usual elsewhere,
the elown was the butt of the jest.
“The bull advanced boldly towards him, paused for a moment, and then rushed at
him. The tiger made a spring at the bull, but the latter plunged his horn into his
adversary's head, and laid him sprawling on the ground completely defeated.”
Having made this facetious hit at the tiger,
“The bull then walked round the circus, regarding the public triumphantly.”
The bullfancying, in his presumption, that he was a greater brute
than his beholders, which was a most ludicrous mistake on the part of
the animal. But the best joke, in the Spanish sense of the word, is
yet to come.
“The tiger was despatched with dogs, and the public, rushing into the circus, divided
its remains among themselves.”
And probably ate them; tiger eating tiger, like true cannibals. In
the meanwhile, Spanish royalty looks on delighted, never, thinking, of
course, of the encouragement it has been giving to that spirit of cruelty
which has earned for the land of the auto-da-fé, of murders, and military
º the character of being the most bloodthirsty nation in
urope.
THE CUR-RIBS OF NEW YORK.
A Few remnants of the aboriginal savage occasionally visit New
York. By the last accounts from America, we learn that some of the
tribe of Cur-ribs—(a most despicable and º specimen of the
wild man)—held a war-meeting at the Astor Place Opera House, on
the occasion of MACREADy’s appearance as Macbeth.
It must be known, that the chief of this tribe of Cur-ribs is Edw
INF OR REST, or WHITEFEATHER, a sinewy savage of indomitable
face, who has had the advantage of several visits to Europe; but who,
it seems, has returned to America, if possible, a greater savage than he
quitted it. Now, it would seem that WHITEFEATHER believes in an
old Indian superstition; namely, that to kill a man of genius, is to
become the possessor of his departed power. To this end, WHITE-
FEATHER laid on the war-paint, shaved his head for the war-plume,
and resolved to slay the English MACREADY.
We regret that we cannot give the speech verbatim as delivered by
WHITEFEATHER to his tribe. It is, however, acknowledged to have
been a marvel of eloquence in its way, calling upon the tribe (paid for
the occasion) to bury the axe, but to lay in a plentiful supply º rotten
eggs, wherewith to assail the pale-face MACREADy. WhiteFEATHER,
moreover, dwelt with passionate earnestness upon the significant use of
a bottle of assafoetida hurled at the proper moment at the pale-face.
“Even as the stench,” said WHITEFEATHER, “will fill the nostrils of
the pale-face, so will my name smell among the nations.”
The Cur-ribs, duly wrought upon } WHITEFEATHER, and filling
their blankets with eggs, apples, and other missiles, then made their
way to the Opera House. A. New York Paper, at some length,
chronicles the energetic doings of the Cur-ribs.
“Then arose louder yells, and these were accompanied with showers of rotten eggs,
apples, and a bottle of assafºtida, which diffused a most repulsive stench throughout
the house. Ma. MacReady endured all this, without flinching, for some time, and at
length commenced his part, which he went on with in dumb show through two acts and
a part of the third. But, as the play proceeded, the fury of excitement seemed to
increase; until the mob began to shout to the Lady Macbeth of the evening to quit the
stage; and, on MR. MacBrady's next appearance, a heavy piece of wood was flung from
the upper tier.”
The New York Courier and Enquirer thus
speaks of the triumph of
Edw INFOR REST, or WHITEFEATHER:-
“He is safe for ever, not only from rivalry, but from that envy from which it often
springs. He succeeded last night in doing what even his bad acting and unmanly
conduct never did before-he inflicted a thorough and lasting disgrace upon the
American character.”
As Punch has artists—scattered like flowers all over the world—he is
enabled to present, at the shortest notice, a portrait of Edw INF
OR REST, or WHITEFEATHER, in his war-paint. It must not, however,
º
be imagined that the warrior personally headed his savages; certainly
not. He kept away. There needed nothing to the worst brutali
ty of
WHITEFEATHER, but the worst of cowardice,—and this, he has. #. a
word, his character is complete; his portrait perfect, as though painted
in the hue and substance of one of his own foul eggs. And, as he
prophesied, his reputation has become as assafoetida.
CURIOSITIES OF ADVERTISING LITERATURE."
GEMs in this department of Letters continue from time to time ap-
pearing in the public prints, and among the last we have an announcement
of “a very de ..". to let, making up ten beds, within the
Regent’s Park.” We presume that the beds in question, being within
the Park, are either flower-beds, asparagus-beds, or strawberry-beds, but
any of these would, we imagine, be rejected by any but a thorough Bed-
lamite. The same day's paper contains the particulars of a place in Dor-
setshire, which “combines the advantage of fishing, with a particularly
dry situation;” but we presume there must be some patent process for
hooking the º tribe, since it seems rather d #. to fish in a
situation whose dryness is remarkable. We imagine, that the sport is
intended to be limited to that unhappy class of the Animal Kingdom,
known as “fish out of water,” who would fall an easy prey to the des
of the angler. Another advertisement commences with the startling
words, “Scotland—To be let furnished, for any period that may be
required,” and a little further on we find an intimation that there is
“Bath—To be let with immediate possession.”

A SHOWER OF DISCOVERIES.
SEVERAL new motive powers have recently been discovered. , When
a man fails in discovering anything else, he turns the whole force
of his discoverative powers on to the discovery of a new motive power.
We have had a couple of these discoveries within the last month. One
is Electro-Magnetism, and the other Xyloidine, which, we are told, is
completely to shut up steam. This, we fear, will be rather a dangerous
process, as an explosion must necessarily take p and we would much
sooner not be the discoverer of a motive power which sent us into the
middle of next week, or forwarded us to so great a distance that we
should never be able to come back again—but everyone to his own taste
—for it is not so easy to discover the motive of these new powers.
This Xyloidine is wonderfully strong, and in time must drive every
railway out of the kingdom: the discoverer tells us that, “for an engine
of two-horse-power, a thread, not larger in size than es' sewing-
- cotton, is sufficient; and the
working machinery need not
be larger than a man's hat.”
According to this, children,

will be fit for nothing but
bathing machines, and horses
must fall to that insignificance
eventually, that they will only

Fº of cats'-meat.
here is no knowing where
- - ...these, new discoveries will
carry us. New motive powers will fall, just like April showers, upon
us, and next year will probably see the following discoveries in daily
practice:
A new motive power—to push the Whigs on a little faster; so that
they may be better able to keep pace with the times, and not to lag so
much behind. -
A new motive power—that will drive all the beasts from Smithfield
Market, and cleanse the City of the filth and abomination caused by it.
A new motive power—to force the Gas and Water Monopolies to
lower their high charges, so as to bring them down to the leveſ of most
ersons' means, instead of keeping them up merely to elevate the
hareholders' dividends.
A new motive power—that shall knock down Battersea and Putney
bridges, and so prevent the numerous accidents they occasion every
year.
A new motive power-to impel Ireland to work more and talk less,
and to regenerate itself by its own Acts, instead of relying upon those
of the House of Commons.
A new motive power—to turn Railway Directors into the path of
homesty, and to convince them that in business, as in railway travelling,
there is nothing like a straight line for getting on the quickest.
If any of the above are brought to light, then we shall be able to
congratulate British science ". º realised the grand truth of
the Grecian philosopher, who dropt it, like a pearl, into the ear of the
world, that, “Power is enviable only, when guided by the noblest

peremptory orders to take everybody by the nose who lands, and give
the batch all round an easy shave for a penny... If some such Order in
Council be not immediately issued to meet this growing evil, England
will be "so much put upon by France, that she will soon have not a

cheap excursions, must be stopped, or else there must be a bye-law
instantly passed that any one who comes back with amoustache, forfeits

A WERY ODD FISH,
* [have seen the Sea
Serpent meander-
ing along the co-
lumns of our illus-
trated contempo-
raries, and we
have been referred
to a subsequent
page for the con-
tinuation of his
very elaborate tail.
P But a novel at-
tempt to realise
this ideal monster
of the deep has
been made at
the Cosmorama
Rooms in Regent
Street, where a
yery Odd Fish is
being exhibited.
In order to give
a genuine air to
the soi-disant Sea
- - - - Serpent, the bills
intimate, in letters of appropriate length and blackness, that “A sailor
who was F. when the creature was captured will attend in the
room.” he honest, tar looked a little awkward; and there was
evidently a doubt in the minds of some of the spectators, whether the
sailor was part of the exhibition, and whether he was not a more
interesting object than the Sea *P* himself, who looked as if he
had been rather overboiled, and as if the cook had broken his head in
taking him out of the fish ketje.
In * that the Sea Serpent appeared overboiled, we must not be
accused of roasting him, for he undoubtedly will present a rich repast to
those who are always ready to devour anything in the shape of a
natural curiosity. We should, ourselves, be somewhat puzzled to class
; but we are disposed to rank him as a superb specimen of the
Nauticus Gallus-a-duo, or Sea Cock-a-too, if we may be allowed to
judge by the chicken-like crest on his forehead, which imparts to him
a rather Cocks-combical aspect.
THE DOOMED TRAVELLER.
We have been favoured with the annexed ſac-simile of an Annual
Ticket for the London and Richmond Railway.

TO ExPIRE
oN THE 25TH of MARCH, 1850.
There,is something quite awful in the style and tone of this docu-
mºnt, which seems to intimate with fearful precision that the directors
will not be answerable for the safety of a traveller on their line, beyond
A day specified... This 25th of March must be as fatal as the pop
ldes of that well-known month, if the life of John SMITH is not to be
considered secure for a longer term; and we can only conceive that the
day mentioned may be intended for a general holiday among, the
servants of the Line: so that, if John SMITH, or any other individual,
chooses to travel by rail to Richmond on that day, it is understood that
he may calculate on being compelled to expire. Should any fatal
accident happen on the 25th of March, we do not see how the Directors
of the º could avoid an imputation of malice prepense in the face
of such a document as the one before us, inasmuch as it fixes the very
date at which JoHN SMITH is “to expire.”
A DISTINCTION AND A DIFFERENCE,
THE public has been lately amused by a difference—somewhat unin-
telligible—between a noble Lord and an Italian Ministro delle finance,
We are happy in being able to explaim the matter in question, which is
simply a difference between MANzoni and MANZANy." That’s all.
AN EXTRAVAGANT CHARGE.
FVERY man likes being taken for a gentleman, and yet no man likes
being charged as one—in a Railway Hotel bill. y
“PUNCH." TO “ (The Times,”
DEAR (Cimeš. - - -
IT has become the fashion for every one with a grievance to
write either to you or to me, and without any disrespect to the Peers,
it may be said that we are looked upon as constituting #. or
severally, a court of appeal much more rapid in its working, if not more
satisfactory in its judgments, than the upper House, when it. “sits in
error,” as some of its members are apt to do when they are sitting any-
where. If anybody, including all sorts of nobodies, can take the
liberty of writing to both of us, we may surely exercise the freedom of
writing occasio { to one another. You may perhaps be rather busier
than I am, and so Ishall not be offended if you do not always answer my
letters, for whether you do or not, there can be no charge got up
against you for not answering, since it is well known that there never
was a journal in the world which answered half so well.
I don’t, however, mean to say you have, deserved what you have
got, for it is not my practice to be complimentary. * object in
writing to you on this occasion is to complain of the result of my having
followed the Government recommendation to establish a slit in my door,
with a letter-box attached to it, to prevent the Postman from having
the trouble of knocking and waiting for the opening of the door, when
he comes with the letters.
º though the system keeps the door shut to the Post:
man, it opens he door to a number of disagreeables, which it would
require the whole of one of your Supplements to enumerate. Being in
the habit of looking at the whole of my private correspondence at the
close of the day, I sought my new letter-box on the first evening of its
having been put up, and the contents formed a miscellany such as the
Postman would never have been allowed to leave had he knocked at the
door with it, in the ordinary manner.
The first article was an oyster-shell; but as I know all sorts of things
are sent by Post, I began to examine the shell, thinking it might be an
ingenious way of advertising a new edition of SHELLEy; or, that I
should find inscribed upon it the price of º with the address of
some enterprising monger of fish, who had taken this mode of attracting
customers. - - -
Turning, however, to the next article in my letter-box, I found a
miserable outcast from the vegetable kingdom, in the form of a decayed
radish, who had evidently been banished from some halfpenny bundle of
his fellow vegetables, as unfit to be, their associate. He had lost the
freshness of early life, and I consoled myself by reading in his withered
leaves a lesson of morality, until my hand lighted on some leaden sub-
stance which had been dropped into my letter-box. Judge, Sir, of my
indignation when I drew out several dumps, and I could not help
exclaiming to myself—the only person, I can get, to listen to me
patiently when I am in an exclaiming humour, -“And has practical
joking fallen to this very dumpy level?”
The remainder of the contents of my letter-box belonged to the same
class of voluntary contributions from the public hand, and I grieve to
say the collection included the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, to which I think
the police—or perhaps you, Sir—may put a stopper. -
I remain, Sir, one who represents a countless host of old subscribers,
and who begs to subscribe himself, 33Ułº C#.
The Price of Buttons.
AN insidious attempt to deprive every single man in the country of a
baker's dozen of the heads of our beloved QUEEN, has been made by
%. schemer, who lately put the subjoined advertisement in the
wºes :-
MPORTANT TO BACHELORS.—The advertiser will, on the receipt of
13 Postage Stamps, forward a simple, easy, and certain PLAN for obviating the ne-
cessity of STRINGs and BUTTONs on shirts and collars, saving gentlemen the annoyance
of constantly finding themselves minus the two former.
It is an established fact in economic F. that the only remedy
for a buttonless breast is a partner of the bosom—a wife.

OUR old acquaintance, The Builder, raps away most vigorously this
week, at a new knocker, which he has been at the trouble to bring from
Paris, and set up over his own door.
The motif of the knocker in question is an exaggeration of one of
the Labours of HERCULEs. The WAN AMBURGH of antiquity is shown
in an engagement with the forest, monarch—only, in this case the
designer has designedly set LEMPRIERE at nought, by impressing into
his service two lions.
The bit of ironmongery under review is one of a series of attempts
to throw an aesthetic air oyer every-day life, to bring poetry into our
door-mats, and sentiment into our scrapers; attempts which Punch
would be the last to frustrate by a discouraging poke with his baton.
i. upon the present occasion he declines to take the noble animals by
e paw.
The introduction of a lion among ladies has been considered mauvais
goût, and two lions at the street-door are, he thinks, two too many.
Our thresholds are not usually associated in our minds with the kin
of beasts, and perhaps the substitution of a postman frappant, j
two runaway knockers, embodied by two urghins courant, would be a
preferable arrangement to that of our usually judicious contemporary.
THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT.
“My DEAR PUNCH, - -
“LIKE other beaus, you rejoiced to see that the long-winded
deeds in Westminster Hall were to be for ever cut short by MR. DRUM-
Mosp's Bill. Weep then with me now, my dear fellow! This senseless
verbiage has taken refuge in Cambridge! Alas! our Senate imposed
on us a tripos of Civil Lawl. The poor wretches who are reading for

“‘DEAR ToM,-Wine with me after Hall. Bob CLoISTER comes

PUNCH NEWER, WBITES IN WAIN.
ONLY last week we used our bâton to draw attention to the acoustics
of the House of Lords. LoRD LANsDown E, when he got his usual
weekly copy, read, pondered, and was convinced.
That very º he went down to the House and proposed an
adjournment, “for the purpose of allowing the architect to improve the
arrangements for enabling noble Lords to make their opinions known to
the House.” The motion was carried—his Lordship, with us in his
pocket, left the House, and instantly sent us the following proposed
new “arrangements.”
They have been invented by CAPTAIN SEMAPHORE, of the ºlº,
Department, and this gentleman has nobly yolunteered to teach the
Peers, gratuitously during the Whitsun holidays, the new mode of
addressing their brother legislators. One week's lessons will enable apt
pupils to make a motion, two weeks' will qualify them, for a simple
ºn, and three weeks' hard work, he says, will make them
eloquent.
All the speeches are to be made by signals: arms, legs, and head, being
available as the parts of a Telegraph. -
In order to save the dignity of the LoRD CHANCELLOR, he will have
the privilege of working an Electric Telegraph, which is now, being
erected round the benches. . In conjunction with this excellent plan, an
additional contrivance will be adopted, borrowed from the Americans,
to whom it was lately of great use when expressing their opinion of a
countryman of ours, who appeared on the stage at New York; Each
Peer will be furnished with a large black board, and may inscribe on it
the groundwork of his speech with chalk, meanwhile giving force, life,
º to the same by pantomimic gesticulations, as he stands
eslde it.
An immense advantage will be gained by this admirable invention.
Several debates can be conducted together. Whole political parties
can rise and act the same sentiments at once, by taking their cue from
a fugle-lord; and, lastly, the reporters will need only to sketch the con-
. of their lordships, in order to publish their transactions to the
country.
Here, for instance, is the peroration of the DUKE, OF RICHMOND's
Protectionist Speech, as it would appear thus reported.

A Game of Knock-me-downs.

THERE is a small instrument, which proposes to do everything in five
minutes, called “THE BACHELOR's DisPATCH.” . Mr. GRANTIEY
BERKeiſey, however, who declares that “every Bachelor ought to be
knocked down.” is much more worthy of the title, for i.e. would
evidently wish to do for the Bachelors by dispatching them altogether.

ASSURING MR. BRIGGS THAT BY SOME VERY SIMPLE CONTRIVANCES THEY CAN BE EFFECTUALLY CURED.
SOMEHow OR OTHER, EVER SINCE THE ALTERATIONS THE CHIMNEYs HAVE TAKEN TO SMOKE INTOLERABLY.
AN H. B. SKETCH OF A MIND.
Of all the things ever held to be confusion the most rich in,
Such as an old lady’s pocket; the table-drawer in a kitchen;
A Wardour Street curiosity shop; a sale at the Customs’ Warehouse;
Or the chaos that Jew-brokers get up at auctions in a bare house;
A carpet-bag packed in a hurry; a San Francisco location;
The “Missing Articles' Depôt" at the Birmingham railway station;
A Lord Mayor's ball; a Derby day; a Whitsun Greenwich steamer;
A Times' advertising column; or the Note-book of a schemer;
The bedfellows with which misery makes a man acquainted—
In short, of all the jumbles ever sung, conceived, or painted,
There’s none that crams so much, and so strange, into so little
r00m,
As that thing, which, combined, we call the mind of that wonderful man
–LoRD BROUGHAM. -
And here follows a sample of what that knowledge-box contains,
Tumbled, jumbled, and rumpled about its nest of brains.
Imprimis; all the useful knowledge and useless, of every variety,
Which hasn’t yet been diffused by his Lordship's pet society—
Six “stingers” for LoRD CAMPBELL-half a theory of equations—
A fashionable novel, à l’EUGENE SUE–a fragment on Law of Nations—
Something, that, when it’s finish'd, will be a new planetary system;
With arguments con, and machinery into arguments pro to twist 'em-
An impression of the seals in wax—a bon-mot, that’s not the lightest,
A pamphlet on Navigation Laws, containing his Lordship's brightest
Discovery that black is white, and the worse the better reason—
A Patent of French citizenship—Russ fashions for the season—
A bran-new Criminal Code—a manuscript prospectus
For a Universal Biography (from which, O publishers, protect us!)—
An argument in favour of freedom of opinion— -
A letter to METTERNICH on the blessings of absolute dominion—
A people's Charter, with two new points—a scheme of ventilation—
Punch's portrait of his Lordship in costume of every nation—
An attack on the Corporation—a speech at a Guildhall dinner—
A prophecy for the Derby, with a portrait of the winner—
A national Education Scheme, and with it oddly mated,
Sixteen conclusive reasons why folks shouldn't be educated—
Thoughts on sanitary humbug—a project for London sewerage—
A receipt for the Philosopher’s stone, and the elixir to cure age—
Sixteen Bankruptcy Acts, of which one half with the other jangle—
And a Consolidation Act that lumps the whole sixteen in a tangle-
A protest against Socialism—a card and bill of fare
For a dinner to be given Louis BLANC and CAUssipićRE—
A tirade against MAzzINI—a plan meant for next year,
Smuggling over to England the Apollo Belvidere—
A Puff for the reporters—a fling at MR. BARRY—
A proposal for sending everything, everywhere, to the LoRD HARRY-
A string of fulsome compliments to F. M. the DUKE of WELLINGTON.—
Plans for checking railway mania, and others for impelling't on—
A work on the Lunar theory, and the influence of the Moon,
With personal illustrations (to be published very soon);
With a lot of odds and ends—old friendships and such lumber–
Old opinions that quietly in old Edinboroughs slumber—
Old reasons, old experiences, flung aside for new ones—
Mock convictions hastily huddled on o'er true ones—
All these mixed together, in a bother and a fume,
Are jostling each other in the brains of HARRY BROUGHAM.

POLICE BY ELECTRICITY.
A PLAN has been partially carried into execution for watching
premises by the aid of electric sparks, instead of those more dangerous
sparks, the regular police, whose
bull's-eyes have a too fatal fascination
for our cooks in general. The project
in question is founded on the principle
of administering a galvanic shock
through the medium of a shutter; and
instead of being regularly given in
charge, the would-be burglar finds
himself suddenly charged with elec-
tricity, while a somewhat milder stream
of electric fluid serves to rouse the
family. This plan will be found very
efficacious against housebreakers, for
it will avert the disagreeable necessit
of a personal encounter; and indeed,
by having figures of policemen sta-
tioned at intervals, and keeping them
en rapport with an electrical machine,
it will be easy to meet a case of assault
with a little scientific battery. -
We are not aware whether º battery falls within the law
there can be no question of the utility
ELECTRICAL WATCH max.
relating to common assault, but
of the plan, that is being adopted for setting traps of electric wire
to catch evil-doers.
The Thier.
LOOK TO YOUR SUGAR BASINS.
LET every one before using any of that material which “sweetens
the (teacup of life,”—let every one, we say, be careful to examine his
sugar basin, which is too often a lead mine disguised under the seduc-
tive form of a portion of our breakfast equipage. We know that our
coffee is adulterated with chicory, we are prepared, to swallow in our
sugar a spade or so of sand—before the sand of life has wholly run out
—but we do not bargain for filling our veins with lead, introduced into
them under the deceptive guise of saccharine. It appears, however,
that so common is the practice of using lead in refining sugar, that one
of the largest refiners in London attaches to every package of sugar he
sends out, a printed label announcing the º: of lead from
his manufacture.
... We shudder to think of the quantity of the heavy metal we may have
imbibed, and we cannot wonder at the stupidity of the world in general
when we think how much lead must have been “taken up” into the
system in this age of tea-drinkers. Whoever reflects on the amount of
lead that must be in circulation in the blood of the people at large, will
be horrified to think of the vast amount of this new metallic .
running through all our arteries and our veins, with a constancy whic
we might almost expect to convert our blood-vessels into leaden pipes,
by the quantity of lead that must be continually deposited.
THE MUSIC OF THE PIERS.
As the Summer Solstice waxes near, the Watering Places, begin to
feel their mouths watering for that supply of Company which they so
much prefer to their own room, and the aristocracy of Lodging-Letters
—for whom there ought to be a Lodge's Peerage expressly compiled—
commence their preparations for the annual Campaign.
The competition º the various places on the Kentish Coast
grows every year more acharné, or inveterate, and each locality tries to
outdo each other in its efforts to “woo the wavering Cockney to its
shores.” Conscious of the old truth, that “Music has charms,” the
Kentish watering places are in the habit of securing the assistance of
those bands of green baize which gather laurels, by puffing and blowing
through brazen instruments on the storm-washed jetty, to the frequent
promenading of Margate-slippered or Holborn-highlowed feet.
Herne Bay once attempted a band, but even the
Serpent found it impossible to make himself heard iſ: way down the
pier, and declared that his task was hopeless, unless he could have the
original Sea Serpent to play upon.
Margate was, however, determined to be early in the field, and in the
erformer on the
hope of securing the first talent in the country, put forth in the Times
the following spirited advertisement:—
O THE MUSICAL WORLD.—The Directors of the Margate Pier and
Harbour Company invite_TENDERs from Musicians willing to Supply an efficient
BAND, to play upon the Pier Promenade daily (Sundays excepted), for about 10 weeks,
commencing on the 2d day of July next, &c.
We are rather curious to know what portion of the “Musical World”
will send its tenders in tender response to this announcement. If in
these days of royal abdication the DUKE of DARMSTADT has not been
abandoned by his once faithful (brass) band, it is probable that, should
the advertisement meet his eye, his Royal Highness would jump at it.
We do not anticipate that JULLIEN will send in proposals; but we
understand that the Blind Scotch Classical $º party will shortly
send in a tender if the party can be extended to the requisite number
of eight, by the addition of four instruments to the double basso, the
Flauto-Magico—whose magic consists in the wonder that the poor old
“executant” can get a sound out of it; the flageolet, whose professor
sometimes plays so carelessly as to deserve flagellation; and the tam-
bourine, which serves the double purpose of completing the quartette,
and catching the money. ..
We trust that these artists will be successful in their application,
should it be made, for we have seen them go through some very difficult
passages—particularly that leading from Leicester Square to St. Mar-
tin's Lane—and we have heard the Staccato of Bonny Laddie very
“conscientiously rendered,” (as the classical critics say), by the double
basso, who is quite a basso relievo from the monotony of the flageolet we
have already alluded to. In the legato, where the executants all take
hold of the skirts of each other's coats in a running passage—to get
out of the way of a 'bus—the effect is so pathetic as to be almost
unbearable.
PUNCH THE “STRANGERS’’ FRIEND.
A Wision of Parliament. House of Commons, Thursday, May 24th, 1850.
EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS.
MR. PUNCH moved," that the House will take into consideration the
rule or practice whereby strangers have been excluded on the motion of
any single member, with a view to alter the same, so that it shall not
hereafter be in the power of an individual member to make an ass of
himself, and commit a public injury, by causing, at his own ill-will and
silly pleasure, the exclusion of reporters.” He would admit that the
House should reserve to itself the power of excluding strangers by a
vote of the majority; for he was free to confess that in some incon-
ceivable conjuncture of circumstances such a step might be necessary.
But on the expediency of that step he would say that the sense of the
House should be taken. (Hear, hear !). He did not think that the folly
of the House (Oh, oh!)—he meant offence to no individual—ought to
be suffered to dictate so serious a proceeding. (Hear, hear, hear !)
It took a wise man to play the fool. (Laughter, and cries of Question /).
He was speaking to the question; as ºf: º might presently find.
The existing rules of the House empowered any fool—or wise man who
chose to play the fool—to deprive the public of all knowledge of what
took place in that House, so long as he remained a member of it. Werb.
sat. sap. (Laughter). He should say no more, for, argument was unne-
cessary in a case of which the merits were self-evident.
MR. PHAGAN seconded the motion.
SIR GEORGE BRowN was not prepared to say that some of the Rules
of that House ought not to be reconsidered and revised, and he was free
to confess that he was not positively certain that this particular Rule
should not be considered one of them. (Hear, hear!), . But he hoped the
honourable and facetious Member would not press his motion. It was
now late, and he deprecated hasty discussion with reference to what
might have taken place the other night in that House, and which, he
trusted, would not be drawn into a precedent; so that there, at any rate,
the saying that one unwise person makes many would not be verified.
(Hear, hear, and laughter). - -
MR. John O'DoNNELL thought the proverbial—he might say, personal
º of the Right Hon. Baronet extremely uncalled for. (Much
aughter).
The House then divided, when the motion of Mr. Punch was lost by
a majority of thirty to twenty. On our return, -
Mr. Punch immediately observed that there were strangers in the
Gallery; when, of course, we were ordered instantly to withdraw.
During our absence we cannot venture to state positively what took
place; only we heard a great clamour, above which rose the unmis-
takeable squeak of Mr. Punch, declaring that he would no longer be a
party to inconsistency, and that he intended to “take notice of the
presence of strangers” every night, until the Rule respecting their
admission shall have been placed on a rational footing. It remains to be
seen how Members will like to have their Fº unreported, and how
the Public will put up with the privation of Parliamentary intelligence.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI
DEEPER AND DEEPER STILL.
UR neighbours the Pa-
risians must be very
hard up for a new idol,
or they would never
have pitched upon a
non-commissioned offi-
cer, one SERGEANT
Boichot, as the popu-
lar favourite of the
hour. This individual
has done nothing be-
yond the perpetration
of a few laxities to gain
motoriety, yet he is
already at the head of
a party in the French
capital, and has writter:
a note to one of the
journals, correcting
some erroneous lim-
pression as to his poli-
tical sentiments. The
thing is about as absurd
as a letter in the
Times from SERGEANT
Spooney of the Ma-
rines intimating his
adherence to the prin-
ciple of the ballot, or a
manifesto from the
Beadle of the Lowther
Arcade stating the
course he proposes to
steer on the Navigation Question. Sergeants, Beadles, and all other subordinate
officials are excellent in their way, but a nation must be in a sorry state when it
looks for its luminaries in such quarters, and accepts political guidance from one
who has no other merit than having disobeyed the orders of his superiors.
Happily for Englishmen, we have too much common sense º us to
admit the possibility of a refractory subordinate—without some other qualification
than his refractoriness-obtaining a seat in the legislature, and drawing up a state-
ment of his political opinions for the edification of the world in general. If the
Revolution continues its career of progressive sinking much longer, we shall expect
to see some communist Chiffonnier a candidate for the Presidential Chair, or to
find Louis NAPOLEoN superseded by the conducteur of some socialist omnibus.
WHAT'S IN THE WIND NOW 2
If we are to judge by the groans that occasionally issue from the Courts of Law
and the murmurs that reach us from the Committee Rooms of the House of
Commons, DR. REID is still aiming his hostile blows at some of the most cherished
institutions of the country. It is not long ago since MR, CLARKson, piteousl
announced the freezing condition of his “poor cold legs” at the Old Bailey, an
CAPTAIN BoupeRo objected to the deliberate shivering of his timbers, through the
shafts aimed by DR. REID at the Committees sitting in the lower house of Par-
liament, MR. JUSTICE WIGHTMAN, after having once or twice requested to be
supplied with a moderate amount of fresh air, and having been nearly blown off the
Bench by a sudden hurricane, which was changed into a species of Sirocco in an
instant, on the mistake being found out, very wisely gave orders that the REID
º should be thrown overboard for the time being, at all events, and that a
little fresh air should be admitted in the old-fashioned way, by opening a window.

sionally upon, members to wear great-coats in the Committee Rooms, and we
§ expect to see the time-if the REID-ventilation goes on-when the Speaker
have to preside in a sou’-wester, the members appearing in dreadnoughts, and
the whole House will have to make itself fast to the benches, in consequence of
the most ordinary debate being rendered literally a stormy one º the operations
of the modern Afolus. The difficulty in distinguishin parties will become greater
than ever, when the winds of ventilation throw everything into a state of pitch and
toss, nor can we wonder at some members deserting their colours, when it is impos:
sible to say where their colours may be blown to, unless they can be literally mailed
to the mast. The vessel of the State is exposed to a sufficiency of adverse winds,
without letting in a º of scientific hurricanes to add to the violence of the
storms it is ordinari§ liable to encounter, and we therefore emphatically demand
the allaying of a wind which appears to have the singular characteristic of blowing
nobody good.
SUPPING FULL OF HORRORs—We see agentleman has been publishing a book,
called “A Dream of Europe.” His slumbers must have been one rapid series of
disturbances. If we knew his address, we would send to inquire after his “Consti-
tution.”. “A Dream of Europe!” We beg he will keep his dream to himself;
the reality, at present, is quite bad enough.
AN M. D. IN A GOWN.
[The Medical Times of the 21st ult, contains a full, true, and particular
account of the admission of a young lady, Miss ELIZABETH Blackwell,
by the General Medical College, in the State of New York, to a phy-
sician's degree. Miss BLAckwell had duly attended Lectures at the
College, and received a formal diploma, under the title of “Domina,"
which was the only feminine that the Senate could find for Doctor. Punch
really thinks this is a case for a copy of verses, which he accordingly sub-
joins, in honour of the fair M.D.]
Not always is the warrior male,
Nor masculine the sailor;
We all know ZARAGossa’s tale,
We’ve all heard Billy Taylor;
But far a nobler heroine, she
Who won the palm of knowledge,
And took a Medical Degree,
By study at her College.

And o'er the patient’s couch their necks

Young ladies all, of every clime,
Especially of Britain,
Who wholly ..º. time
In novels or in knitting,
Whose highest skillis but to º

Reflect on the example, pray,
Of excellent Miss BLAckwell!

A husband, or a lover, -
And could prescribe the draught or pill
Whereby he might recover;
How much more useful this would be,
Oh, sister, wife, or daughter!

Ye bachelors about towed
In youth's unthinking hey-day,
Wholook upon a furnish’d head
As horrid for a lady,
Who'd call a female doctor “blue;”
You’d spare your sneers, Irather
Think, my young fellows, if you knew
What physic costs a father!
How much more blest were married life
To men of small condition,
If every one could have his wife
For family physician;
His nursery kept from ailments free,
y proper regulation,
And for advice his only fee,
A thankful salutation.
For DocTRIx BLAckwell—that’s the way
To dub in rightful gender—
In her profession, ever may
Prosperity attend her!

WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE TO DOf
THIS question, to which Echo has been sending a series of imper-
| tinent answers for the last four weeks, has occurred to us in conse-
uence of the directions continually issued by the song-writers of
the day, who address us in a style so contradictory that we can make
neither head nor tail of it. †. one column we are called upon to
“Weep no more,” and we have scarcely mopped the tear-drop from
our eye, before we are requested to “Weep on. Price Two Shillings ſ”
Scarcely have we recovered from our bewilderment on the subject of
sympathetic moisture in the organs of vision, and our mucous mem-
brane has hardly been restored from the effects of the shock, when our
wers of memory are apostrophised with a recommendation, to
“Remember her whom once,” followed by a most inconsistent
entreaty that we should “Forget, forget, for ever!”
It is really a most embarrassing thing for those who are willing to
look upon poets as great moral teachers, when a different code appears
to be adopted in every separate advertisement.
We pity any one who tries the experiment of following the perplexing
and antagonistic directions of the }. poets of the age, as ſ: at least
as their systems may be gathered from the advice they convey in the
advertising columns of the newspapers. By one poet we are told
“How cherished is the token!” when another somewhat rudely and
ungratefully insists that we shall “Take back, the Gift. Price Two
Shillings;” thus casting a double slur, upon the donation, by meanly
ticketing it with its alleged price, while insisting on its being taken
back again. -
We confess we shall not feel very much disposed to look up to the
poets as moral teachers, until they are somewhat better agreed as to
the kind of advice they address to us.
The Break up at Baden Baden.
THE downfall of this little Dukedom, has involved no less than two
families, that of the Grand Duke, and his Prime Minister, in irre;
trievable ruin. The season ". which the ducal revenue depends had
not yet commenced, but the Government had laid down two hundred
dozen of ginger-beer, and nearly as much lemonade, which would have
been a great aid to the treasury. By the revolution that has just
occurred, the whole of these vast resources fell into the hands of the
.* who have declared the establishment of a public—not a re-
Pl lic—from which any one is served out with the utmost promptitude.
The Grand Duke managed to secure the ducal treasury—the till—with
the whole of its receipts on the day of the outbreak.

SPORT FOR YOU, DEATH TO US,
THE Times has inserted a complaint from a Chancery suitor, who
grumbles piteously at the delay occasioned by the frequent holidays in
the Masters’ Offices. We, as unprofessional and uninitiated individuals,
can only suppose that the Masters in Chancery are Masters in the
juvenile sense of the term, and that these young gentlemen, on the
principle of “all work and no play” making “Jack a dull boy,” require
a good deal of play to brighten them up, and hence the necessity for a
number of holidays in the Masters'—that is to say the ſº asters’
—Offices. We are not aware how the holidays are passed, but whatever
may be the mature of the sport, it is certainly death, to the unfortunate
suitors whose interests are sacrificed by the delays that this practice of
holiday-making among the Masters is continually occasioning.
AN AWFUL RISE IN BEARS.
CoLoREL LINDsay observed in the House of Commons that “the
reason why the bear-skin caps were taken from the Fusiliers was, that
the º: of Bears had risen; ” We cannot understand this. Only look
at the price of bear's-grease! Can it possibly be cheaper?, Again,
does, not the announcement of “Another Fine Bear. Slaughtered"
startle us at almost every corner? These facts sufficiently prove
that Bears are plentiful enough, to say nothing of the immense quantity
that may be caught at any time outside the Stock Exchange. Why
does not Government contract for its Bears? It would have tenders
showered in more than sufficient to smother the whole army.
We are sure that the spirited hairdresser of Bishopsgate Street, whom
we may well call the Ursa Major of the tonsorial firmament, would Corn-
pete for one. We can never forget the intrepidity with which he was
cutting through an ice-berg to meet a Bear, who was quietly waiting for
with open mouth, on the other side. A gorgequs fresco, comme-
morating this wonderful bit of tunnelling, ran round his corner shºp.
We remember it was a private view of the North Pole, (which after
all is the true barber's pole,) and that Bears were dancing upon it
as plentifully as shop-boys at the Casino. Give this intrepid barber
an order for 1000 Bears, or even ten times that amount, and we are
confident * would be all delivered at the Horse Guards long before
six months had passed over the h of the Fusiliers. It is a
mere ad cap-tandum excuse of some cunning accoutrement-maker, who
just º to be out of Bears, to say there is a scarcity of them. How
can such a dearth possibly occur when we consider the awful number
of young cubs that enter the army every year?

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
A WORD ABOUT BALLS IN SEASON.
HEN my good friend, Mr.
Punch, some time since,
asked me to compile a
series of conversations for
young men in the dancing
world, so that they might
be agreeable to their part-
ners, and advance their
own success in life, I con-
sented with a willing heart
to my venerable friend's
request, for I, desire
nothing better than to
promote the amusement
and happiness of all youn
people; and nothing,
thought, would be easier
#. to touch à* º
t, airy, graceful little
sets of , phrases, which
young fellows might adopt
or expand, according to
their own ingenuity and
leisure.
Well, Sir, I imagined
myself, just for an instant,
to be young again, and
that I had a neat waist
instead of that bow-
window with which Time
and Nature have orna-
- - mented the castle of my
body, and brown locks instead of a bald pate, (there was a time, Sir, when my hair was not
considered the worst part of me, and Irecollect when I was a young man in the Militia, and when
; finally went out in our corps, who it was that longed to have my queue—it was found in
er desk at her death, and my poor dear wife was always jealous of her), -I just chose, I say, to
fancy myself a young man, and that I would go up in imagination and ask a girl to dance with me.
So I chose MARIA— a man might go farther and fare worse than choose MARIA, MR. Bob.
“My dear Miss E.,” says I, “may I have the honour of danci # the next set with you?”
“The next what?’” says Miss E., smiling, and turning to MRs. E., as if to ask what a set meant.
“I forgot,” says I; “the "...º. I would #" -
“It is rather slow dancing, quadrilles,” says Miss E.; “but if I must, I must.” -
“Well, then, a waltz, will that do I know nothing prettier than a waltz played not too quick.”
“What!” says she, “do you want a horrid old three-timed waltz, like that which the little
figures dance upon the *...*. You silly old creature; you are good-natured, but you
are in your dotage. All these dances are passed away. , You might as well ask me to wear a
wn with a waist up to my shoulders, like that in which mamma was married; or a hoop and
igh heels, like grandmamma, in the picture; or to dance a gayotte or a minuet. Things are
changed, old gentleman—the fashions of your time are gone, and—and the bucks of your time
will go too, MR. BRowN. If I want to dance, here is CAPTAIN WHISKERFIELD, who is ready;
or 3. STUDDINGTON, who is a delightful partner... He brings a little animation into our balls;
and when he is not in society, dances every night at Vauxhall and the Casino.” -
I pictured to myself MARIA giving some such reply to my equally imaginative demand—for of
course I never made the request, any more than she did the answer—and, in fact, dear Bob, after
turning over the matter . ballroom conversations in my mind, and sitting with pen and ink
before me for a couple of hours, found that I had nothing at all to say on the subject, and, have
no more right to teach a youth what he is to say in the present day to his partner, than I should
have had in my own boyhood to instruct my own i. in the art of sucking eggs... We
should pay as much reverence to youth as, we should to age; there are points in which you
young folks are altogether our superiors: and I can't help constantly crying out to persons of my
own years, when busied about their young people-leave them alone; don't be always meddling
with their affairs, which they can manage for themselves; don’t be always insisting upon managing
their boats, and putting your oars in the water with theirs. - - - -
So I have the modesty to think that Mr. Punch and, I were a pair of conceited old fogies, in
devising the above plan of composing conversation for the benefit of youth, and that young folks
can manage to §§ of what interests them, without any prompting, on our part. To say the
truth, I have hardly been to a ball these three years: , I saw the head of the stair at H. E.'s...the
T— Ambassador in Br—ne §. the other night, but retired without even getting a sight
of, or making my bow to Her Excellency; § that mon lait de poule, et mon, bonnet de
nuit, much better became me at that hour of midnight, than the draught in a crowded passage,
and the sight of ever so many beauties. - - -
But though I don't go myself to these assemblies, I have intelligences amongst people who
go: and hear from the girls and their mammas, what they do, and how they enjoy themselves. , I
must own that some of the new arrangements please me very much, as being natural and simple,
and, in so far, superior to the old mode. -
In my time, for instance, a ball-room used to be more than half filled with old male and female
fogies, whose persons took up . deal of valuable room, who did not in the least ornament
the walls º: which they stood, and who would have been much better at home in bed. . In a
great country-house where you have a hallfire-place in which an ox might be roasted conveniently,
Aº(Q.
the presence of a few score more or less of
stout old folks can make no difference; there
is room for them at the card-tables, and round
the supper-board, and, the sight of their
honestºred faces and, white waistcoats lining
the wall cheers and illuminates the Assembly
Room.
But it is a very different case when you
have a small house in Mayfair, or in the
pleasant district of Pimlico and Tyburn; and
accordingly I am happy. to hear, that the
custom is rapidly spreading of asking none
but dancing people to balls. It was only this
morning that I was arguing the point with
our cousin MRs. CRowneR, who was greatly
irate because her daughter, FANNY had re-
ceived an invitation to go with her aunt, MRs.
TIMMINs, to LADY TUTBURY's ball, whereas
poor MRs. CRowDER had been told that she
could on no account get a card.
Now BLANCHE CRow DER is a very large
woman naturally, and with the present fashion
of flounces in dress, this balloon of a creature
would occupy the best part of a back drawing-
room; whereas Rosa TIMMINs is a little bit
of a thing, who takes up no space at all, and
indeed furnishes the side of a room as prettily
as a bank of flowers could. I tried to con-
vince our cousin upon this point, this embon-
point I may, say, and of course "...º.
§: to make remarks, personal, to MRs.
owdER, I playfully directed them else.
where.
“Dear BLANCHE,” said I, “don’t you see how
fº LADY TUTHURY would have to extend
er premises if all the relatives of all her
dancers were to be invited? She has already
flung out a marquee over the leads, and
actually included the cistern—what can she
do more? If all the girls were to have cha-
erons, where could the elders sit? TUTBURY
imself will not be present. . He is a large
and roomy man like your humble servant, and
LADY TUT has sent him off to Greenwich, or
the Star and Garter for the night, where, I
have no doubt, he and some other stout
fellows will make themselves comfortable.
At a ball amongst persons of moderate means
and large acquaintance in London, room is
much more precious than almost anybody’s
company, except that of the beauties and the
dancers. Look at LoRD TRAMPLETON, that
enormous hulking monster (who neverthe-
less dances beautifully, as all big men do),
when he takes out his favourite partner, Miss
WIRLEDGE, to polk, his arm, as he whisks her
round and, round, forms radii of a circle of
very considerable diameter. He almost wants
a room to himself. Young men and women
now, when they dance, dance really; it
is no lazy, sauntering, as of old, but down-
right hard work-after which they want
air and refreshment. How can they get the
one, when the rooms are filled with elderly
folks; or the other, when we are squeezin
round the ºp. and drinking up
the available Champagne and Seltzer water?
No, no; the present plan, which I hear is
becoming general, is admirable for London.
Let, there be a half-dozen, of good, active,
bright-eyed chaperons and duennas, little
women, who are more active, and keep a
better look-out than your languishing volup-
tuous beauties” (I said this, casting at the
same time a look of peculiar tenderness
towards BLANCHE CRowper), “let them keep
watch and see that all is right—that the
young º º: dance too . !. with º:
same girl, or disappear on to the balcony, an
that sort of thing; let them have good large
roomy family coaches to carry the youn
women home to their mammas. In a word,
at a ball, let there be for the future no admit-
tance except upon business. In all the affairs
of Londonlife, that is therule, depend upon it.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“And pray who told you, MR. B.RowN, that I didn't wish to dance
myself?” says BLANCHE, surveying her great person in the looking-glass
(which could scarcely contain it) and flouncing out of the room; and I
actually believe that the unconscionable creature, ather age and size, is
still thinking that she is a fairy, and that the young fellows would like
to dance found the room with her. Ah, BoB : I remember that
| grotesque woman a slim and graceful girl. I remember others tender
and beautiful, whose bright eyes glitter, and whose sweet voices
whisper, no more. So they pass away—youth and beauty, love and
innocence, pass, away and perish. I think of one now, whom I
remember the fairest and the gayest, the kindest and the purest; her
laughter was music—I can hear it still, though it will never echo, any
more. Far away, isiºn: tomb closes over her. Other roses than those
of our prime, i. up and bloom, and have their day. Honest youth,
generous youth, may yours be as pure and as fair.
I did not think when I began to write it, that the last sentence would
have finished so; but life is not altogether jocular, MR. BoB, and one
comes upon serious thoughts suddenly as upon a funeral, in the street.
Let us go back to the business we are upon, namely balls, whereof it
has perhaps struck you that your uncle has very little to say.
I saw one announcement in the morning fashionable print to-day,
with a fine list of some of the greatest folks, in London, and had pre-
viously heard from various quarters how eager many persons were to
...?it, and how splendid an entertainment it was to be. And so
the morning
her house in
by LADY FUGLEMAN.
Now this is a sort of entertainment and arrangement than which, I
confess I can conceive nothing more queer, though I believe it is by
no means uncommon in English society. MRS. HoRNBy MADox comes
into her fortune of ten thousand *. to be presented in
the London world, having lived, in the country º Ilo
expense to make her house and festival as handsome as may be, and
ets LADY FuGLEMAN to ask the company for her—not the honest
oRNBys, not, the family MADoxEs, not, the jolly old squires and
friends and relatives, of her, family, and from her county; but the
ſondon dandies and the London, society: whose names you see chro-
nicled at every party, and who, being Y FUGLEMAN’s friends, are
invited by her 1. ship to MRs. HoRNBY's house. - -
What a strange notion of society does this give-of friendship, of
fashion, of what people will do to be in the fashion | Poor MRs. HoRNEY
comes into her fortune, and says to her old friends and family, “M
good people, I am going to cut every one of you... You were very we
as long as we were in the country, where I might have my natural
likings and affections... But, henceforth, I am going to let LADY
FUGLEMAN choose my friends for me. I know nothing about you any
more. I have no objection to you, but if you want tº know me you
must ask LADY FUGLEMAN: if she says, yes, I shall be delighted;
er announced that MRs. HoRNBY MADox threw open
if no, Bon jour.”

... This strange business goes on daily in London. Honest people do
it, and think not the least harm. The proudest and noblest do not
think they demean themselves by crowding to MRS. GoºdCALF's parties,
and strike quite openly a union between her wealth and their titles, to
determine as soon as the former ceases. There is not the least
§. about this at any rate—the terms of the bargain are quite
understood on every hand. - - - -
But oh, BQB see what an awful thing it is to confess, and would not
even hypocrisy be better than this daring cynicism, this open heart-
lessness—Godlessness I had almost called if P Do you mean to say,
you great folks, that your object in society is not love, is not friend-
ship, is not family union and affection—is not truth and kindness;-is
not generous sympathy and union of Christian (pardon me the word;
but fº indicate my meaning by no other)—of Christian men and
women, parents and ... "... that you assemble and meet
together, not caring or trying to care for one another, without a
pretext of good will—with a daring selfishness tº: avowed ? I
am sure I wish MRs. GoLDCALF or the other lady no harm, and have
never spoken to, or set eyes on either of them, and I do not mean to
say, MR. Robert, that you and I are a whit better than they are, and
doubt whether they have made the calculation for themselves, of the
consequences of what they are doing. But as sure as two and two
e four, a person giving up of his own accord his natural friends
and relatives, for the sake of the fashion, seems to me to say, I
acknowledge myself to be heartless; I turn my back on my friends,
I disown my relatives, and I dishonour my father and mother.
And so no more at present, dear Bob, from your affectionate,

the commencement of noise in all overtures, viz.
THE PEERS AND THE SILENT, SYSTEM.
It is highly probable that many of their Lordships, finding it im-
possible to obtain a hearing in their present House, will come to the
conclusion that “it’s no use talking,” and begin in future to hold their
tongues. A new gallery is talked about for the reporters, but unless it
is on the principle of a ... gallery, we do not see its utility in
an assembly where no sound that is uttered has more strength or dis-
tinctness than a mere whisper, and where the members might as well
be reduced to the condition of mere dummies, since they are virtually
dumb, as far as the reporters are concerned. Inventive ingenuity has
suggested a combination of the sciences of acoustics and optics, in the
form of an opera º and ear trumpet, in one. In ordi Cases
seeing is believing, but it is difficult to believe a Peer to be speaking
even when his lips are seen to be moving, while not a word is to be
heard. The suggested union of the ear trumpet with the opera glass
will cause seeing and believing to go together, for it will not only
induce a reporter to imagine a Peer to be speaking by the motion of his
lips, but his Lordship's own word may be taken for it, though under

that the words of some of the most honourable and high-minded of our

A NEW INSTRUMENT FOR THE USE OF REPORTERS IN THE HOUSE
- OF Peers.
MINT SAUCE.
We are very much afraid that the officials of the Mint, by their cool
way of meeting anything in the shape of public inquiry, will render
the idea of Mint, Sauce almost inseparable from their establishment.
| Some of the medallists have declared that they have no right to be med-
dled with;, and those who have been taken to task for unskilfulness in
preparing the dies, pronounce themselves prepared to “stand the hazard
of the die,” however great the imperfections that may be discovered.
It was not to be expected that
as quiet as lambs under all this Mint Sauce, and the result was a very
warm discussion. By an odd coincidence, the House had no sooner
dropped the debate on the Mint, than a conversation arose about LoRD
|MINTo and the charge of his commission to Italy. We are almost
inclined to agree that England has usually quite enough of its own
irons in the fire at a time, without having recourse to Italian irons to
| add to them.
A String of Songs.
THERE is a song called “The Ties of Home.” This can only be one
of a series, for it is clear the “Ties” must have been preceded by
“The True Lover's Knot,” and “The Matrimonial Noose.” By-the-by,
we are curious to know the F. Chord that runs through these
“Ties” and “Knots,” though of course “The Matrimonial Noose” is a
matter of discord, the key in which it is set being º. one which is

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PROTECTION FLEET.
3 ºautical 33allat.
It was in St. Stephen's waters,
That ADMIRAL PEEL his course he wore,
For he found, by the chart, if he kept his course,
He must run slap on a lee shore.
Our Admiral he stood on the starboard tack,
When we the Protection Fleet did spy:
“All hands about ship, and in a crack,
Your starboard tacks and sheets let fly.”
The cotton ships as was our convoy,
A league ahead under stunsails runs,
But PEEL he cracked on, and hailed 'em, “Ahoy!
Drop under our starn, and stand by your guns.”
It was CAPTAIN Cobden, of the Stockport,
And CAPTAIN BRIGHT, of the Durham, also,
At our Admiral's hail, they hove all short,
Androused their hands up from below.
“Starbowlines stout, you must turn out;
Larbowlines stout, heave all aback;
For bless'd, if here ain't bold ADMIRAL PEEL,
As we thought was on the other tack.”
So to quarters we beat through the Free Trade Fleet,
And the grog it was sarved out all round,
And stern to his gun stood each mother's son,
As we took up our fighting ground.
Bold STANLEY let fly from the enemy
A second to him bold Richmond played,
And his frigate saucy Disraeli
Alongside of our Admiral laid.
Oh, well young BEN he worked his craft,
With smail arms and with hollow shot,
But PEEL he raked him fore and aft,
And for one BEN gave, bless'd but two he got,
And first, the Corn Law, Eighty-four,
She struck to CAPTAIN Cobden bold,
And, Timber Duty, she blowed up,
And a sheer hulk the West Indian rolled.
Then the enemy’s captains they came aboard,
And three cheers our gallant tars they gave,
As each of 'em handed up his sword,
And doused his fore an' aft hat so grave.
But DisrAELI he still showed fight,
Dismasted and rudderless though he lay,
And when he’d shot out all his shot,
With powder still he blazed away.
The Protection Fleet, thus, one by one,
Their colours for to strike we saw;
Only bold STANLEY still fought on,
With his flag-ship, the Navigation Law.
Main-yard to main-yard his did thunder,
And once he boarded by the chains;
And his stout crew would not knock under,
Until blowed out was all their brains.
His sails was riddled, his masts was scored,
His ship settled gunwale to the sea,
When he hailed “Avast, send a boat aboard,
For I’m willing to strike,” he says, says he.
'Twas aboard an old tub of a seventy-four-
The Whig, LoRD RºssFLL her captain's name,
Which never got up till the fight was o'er,
Bold STANLEY to surrendercame.
His sword to Russell out he drew,
And “Take my sword, Lord JoHN,” says he:
“But if I’d only fought with you,
You’d never have had this sword of me.
“It was Apºſtral PEEL, with Coppen and BRIGHT,
And them cotton ships, so stout and true,
That desarves the credit of this here fight-
So don't you go for to say ’twas you.”
So three cheers to them to whom we owes
The victory of the Free Trade fleet;
may we see such gallant foes,
Henceforth as gallant friends to meet,

Why, if Guilt an innocence must be contrasted—and indeed, Mr.

you, who so delicately conceived, and so sweetly painted, that row of
rosy-faced, softly snub-nosed angels of little charity girls, in their blue-
ribboned white caps and mittens—why must guilt blush under a º:
wig or flush with reflections from a morone velvet with square tails?
Is wantonness more wanton in sacque and patches?.
Punch knows what you will say, my dear young friends. Old costume
is picturesque, quaint of cut, brilliant of colour, and various of texture.
True, and all this helps you much, no doubt, and makes the conceiving
and executing of pictures a much easier work, and more tickling to the
eye.
*śnt think, on the other hand, how, hunting after this pleasure
of the eye, you neglect, and how this, exhibition shows you neglect-
the thought, meaning, expression—soul, in fact, of your picture. There
may be no reason why a face should not tell its tale as distinctly upon
the shoulders of a lay figure in the costume of the Second GEoRGE, as
one in the soberer garb, temp. Victoria, but you will find in general
it doesn’t, somehow. After all, your work is no transcript of real life
as you know it. Perhaps, if you would think more of men and women,
andless of clothes, you might find manythings to paint, close at your
own doors, without the sad need of rummaging Lemprière's Dictionary,
and Pepys, and Evelyn, and the Picar of Wakefield, and Tristram Shandy
and Gil Blas, and Don Quizote, and Goldsmith's History of England, an
other recondite works.
Look at WEBstER’s pictures in this Exhibition. What is the crowning
charm that draws crowds about them, but the unflinching, unmistake-
able truth, and common reality of them—reality, subordinated always to
true Fºl. of painting, remember.
What names are greatest in our English school? REYNoLDs, the
painter of the real men and women of his time-Hogarth, whose study
was in the streets—Wilkie, whose lofty throne is “built on humble
truth”—LANDsee R, whose themes are real, though no higher than
dogs, horses, and “such small deer.” Stir yourselves, then, O dear |
young friends, in whom we trust. Why should we enumerate your
names? Burn your wardrobes, and eschew MR. NATHAN, and away
with portraits of silks and satins, for portraits of men, and women, and
children—for faces alive with thought, and action instinct with meaning,
instead. Come, paint human beings instead of clothes-horses.

to shut my Eyes between the Tunes and to hear nothing but the rustling
of Dresses and a Murmur of Woices as º walk up and down. It
is wonderful how we English do go º our Amusements, after the
Manner of a solemn Ceremony. Yet do the people of Fashion in
Kensington Gardens make an exceeding rare Show; and Ido only wis
that there were no opposite Picture to be seen among us. But their
Finery do afford Employment to Work People, and I do thank them
for parading themselves for my Amusement, and the Officers of the
Guards for treating the Town to Musique, and so giving Occasion to
such a fine Spectacle.
THE RAIN OF TERROR.
WHIT-Monday of 1849 will be remembered in our meteorological
annals, as the wettest day on record, and the quantity of rain that fell
at Greenwich and Chelsea was so over-pouring, that nothing could
possibly be wetter than the naval and military wetter-uns. The gentle-
man who stands up to his ankles in puddles, for the º: of noting
the number of inches of rain that may have fallen, and sending the
result to the Times, was heard to remark that he had never sq
thoroughly put his foot in it before, and he took such an !g cold
in the gutter, that his voice has still a guttural sound of intense
hoarseness. mour own observations of our private water-butt, we
are enabled to state, that the mean_moisture on Whit-Monday
represented more water than SIR. Hugh MyDDELTON ever took into his
head, when he started the New River. Thus it happened that on one
of the greatest holidays of the year, Pleasure found a watery grave, and
though we permitted our dog Tony to have a run out, -for Toby, like
every other dog, has his day-the-poor brute seemed to regardit as
merely a sop for CERBERUs.
POWERTY AT THE POST OFFICE.
OUR Insolvent Records are being daily amplified by the names of a
number of Post-Office Clerks, whom public parsimony pays at such a
miserable rate, that many of them find it impossible to meet their pecu-
niary engagements. Perhaps it is the fatality of poverty which º:
over them in their capacity of men of letters, but whatever may be
the cause, the effect is, that the few effects they possess, are, under the
º of fifa-a portion of the gigantic legal system of fi, fa, fo, fee,
um-being continually swept awa É. them. The wonder really is,
how the various un º and hº officials at St. Martin’s-le-
rand can continue to perform their duties with the fidelity, punctu-
ality, and precision usually exhibited; for it must require some
stratagem to go and return in safety to and from their work, hunted, as
many of them are, by bands of shrieval officers.
The exterior of the General Post-Office must be in a state of
blockade every morning at about the time of the arrival of the clerks,
and all, sorts of expedients must be at work to baffle the bailiff's
ingenuity. The principal entrance is, we should imagine, the daily
scene of a game at prisoner's base, the poor clerks running from pillar
to pillar for security against the baseness of being made prisoner.
|
We have heard of a popular actor being so hunted by his creditors,
who had “let slip the dogs of law” in pursuit of him, that he was com-
higet to their Post—that is to say, the Gene
pelled to get in or out of the theatre up and down a c ey,
or consent to be shot into the cellar from a coal-sack, or turned on
into the cistern by a private main-ventilated for the purpose—but all
this could scarcely be worse than the shifts, the Post-Office Clerks are
put to in eluding the duns and bailiffs that lie in wait for them. The
ildest and most astounding efforts are º some of the clerks to
- - Post-lest, underpaid
as they are, they should lose their situations, and the es upon
which they are trying to drag out ºtheir own lives, and to drag up their
half-starved families. - - -
Well may the clerks envy the freedom with which a letter can be
put into the box, and find its way into the building—nor can we be
surprised if now and then some
harassed official, taking advantage of
the permission to send miscellaneous
articles by Post, should wrap himself
up in an air of mystery by way of
envelope, and plunge into the largest
letter-box, in order to gain an en-
trance into theestablishment. Others,
with less muscular activity, may pre-
fer transmission by Post in the ordi-
way through the medium of one
of those sacks which are emptied daily
into the receiving box at St.Martin’s-
le-Grand during the ceremony, of
posting the newspapers. This method
would be particularly convenient for
the clerks on night duty, as the cere.
mony could be performed without
creating observation, and compara:
tively little danger, unless, indeed, it should unfortunately happen that
a shower of Standards should be shot into the box at about the same
time, when the very bad odour
—to say nothing of the heavy
weight—might have a most dis-
agreeable effect upon any one
coming in contact with matter
so poisonous.
erhaps, after all, there could
be no safer planthan obtaini
an entrance through the roof,
which might be achieved with
comparative ease in these days of
ventilation, when our c ey-
pots are twisted into such eccen-
tric forms that a small staircase
#. be introduced without
culty down the centre of al-
most everyone of them. This,
or a subterranean passage, as an
- assurance againstarrest through
the medium of the sewer, would at least providesofar for the efficiency
of the public service, that the regular attendance of the clerks at the
Post Office might be relied upon, though as to the faithfulness of their
discharge of their duties, we do not see how this is to be guaranteed
#;" resent paltry pay, unless there is a certain amount of in-
fallibility of human nature, which, like the system of cab-fares, is
limited to the precincts of the General Post-Office. We yield to none
in a love of economy, but as friends to justice, and with a desire to see
the public efficiently as well as faithfully served, wenust protest against
that mean, and illiberal spirit which regards every one who receives any
of the public money as over-paid, and is for reducing º:
income-howeverably he may fill his office, and, however hard he may
work-upon the mere ground of his income being part of the public
expenditure."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
PUNCH*S FREE ADMISSION TO THE
EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
ROM time to time we intend to present
our readers with a free admission to
the different Exhibitions of London.
Our country readers will thus be able
to visit everything in Town without
stirring from their arm-chairs. Qur
new plan may be called “Sight-seeing
made Easy.”
Our first visit shall be over the
water, in the hope that the reader
will accompany us to the Surrey
Zoological Gardens. ...The worst of
these Gardens is, the difficulty of find;
ing them. On one occasion we found
ourselves in Battersea Fields, and thought we were all right, till we saw
Mount Vesuvius blazing away in the distance, and remember we never
reached the Gardens till about one o'clock in the morning. It is a
wonder how the omnibus horses know the way so well. How the
Giraffes ever got there is still more wonderful, but animals who spend
their lives in contemplating the Sphinx, are probably very clever in
guessing riddles. - - - - -
Once there, however, the visitor will *...* his day's journey.
He will be divided between flowers and ... On one side, beds
with an embroidered counterpane of roses and tulips, worked in more
beautifully than Berlin wool, will tempt him to rest his wearied limbs;
and on the other, the Pelican will stretch out his friendly neck, and,
bidding him welcome, almost seem to exclaim, “Please, your noble
honour, spare us a copper to-day.” The Pelicans, we need not mention,
are the crossing-sweepers of the Desert. - -
A double concert, on the visitor's entrance, is going on; the instru:
mental part is fiddling away under the large scallop-shell that is placed
over the delicate white figures of Asia, Africa, Europe, and America,
to serve them up, apparently, when . are sufficiently browned, or
done au gratin, by the sun; and the vocal part is contributed to all day
long by the laughing Hyena, the Lion, and others, who excel particularly
in the music of VERDI. This mélange is very agreeable, more especially
about feeding-time, when the animals i. through some delicious
morceaua with a nicety and finish that would quite astonish Costa. It
was from a close study of these able-bodied performers that JULLIEN
first took the notion of his “Monster” Concerts. He calls to this day
the Jackall “son cher ophicleide,” and when he is º with the
Elephant's trunk, apostrophises it interms of affection as his “charmante
petite grosse caisse.”
These little traits redound to the credit of both
les.
Having brought the visitor so far, we now beg to present him with—
A FREE ADMISSION TO THE STORMING OF BADAJOz.
That steep, castle, which looks like a large Stilton Cheese, or a big
yellow Salad-bowl with a lot of green stuff inside, is Badajoz. The two
little red soldiers, who are doing sentry in the middle of the mixture
may be taken for a couple of spring radishes. You see the bridge which
runs across the water—it is so life-like, that the Ducks give themselves
a headache every day in knocking against the side, in the hope of getting
through it. Are they not flats for their pains? If they were “canvas.
ducks,” they probably would know better. Is not that bridge wonderful?
We recommend thatWestminster Bridge be swept away—a hearth-broom
will easily do it—and that MR. DANson be commissioned by Govern-
ment to paint a new one. It would be every bit as safe as the present
bridge, and be infinitely more picturesque.
. Look! what is that? It takes its º flight through the air,
º like a beautiful Bird of Paradise. It is the first rocket. The storm
commenced. . Military storms differ somewhat from atmospherical
ones. They begin with a blue light, and end generally with a rocket,
or a Roman candle. When the military storm is raging at its very
highest, it is best to º: up an umbrella, for when, once the rockets
explode, it is impossible to say where, in their fury, they will stop, but,
like choleric old men, such as MR.TILBURY acts at the Haymarket, th
are sure to lay their sticks across the first person that comes in their
way. MESSRs. SouTHBy are very clever in raising a storm. They
storm so beautifully that little boys hook themselves on to the
to enjoy the fun, and the roofs of omnibuses are piled up with high
stacks of conductors who boldly defy the lightning, in a style that old
AJAX might equal, but could not possibly surpass.
The cannons begin to roar, and the animals also. The glass case in
which they are kept, is lighted #. a glowing red, and it looks so hot
!. fancy . pane must crack like a roasted chesnut. The trumpets
ray their loudest, every drum and every heart is beating quite loud, the
Peacock is playing his favourite solo on the railway-whistle, and every
now and then, you hear a loud piercing “Oh!” that rises far above
the horrible din, and is but a faint echo of the feeling that is filling,

almost to a carpet-bag point of bursting, the breast of every man,
woman, policeman, and child.
Oh what a crash was that ' and no wonder. See, one whole side of
the castle has fallen in. It is crumbling to pieces like a stout Cheshire
that has been undermined by the cheeseknife....The ten soldiers (bless
them () are fighting bravely for their ten shillings; the rockets are
drooping in a golden shower over Badajoz, like a large, laburnum. H
A, continual stream of guineas, such as must run in the gutters
when it rains in, California, keeps flooding into the Lake, and you
imagine that all the trout must, ſº ere this, have been turned into
monster gold fish. And where are the Ducks? Go, search the bed of
Glory, and there, where the Spanish onions (to the right of the castle)
are thickest, you will probably find them laid out—so tremendous has
been the British ...” roasted to a turn.
There is a grand explosion—the whole air is hissing hot;-the trees
are crimson;–the water is the colour of Tomata sauce,—there is a
mighty flash of red fire:-Badajoz, is taken. ...The devoted ten rush
once more into the breach, which is burning like a furnace; a fi
with a wooden sword, cocked hat, and nose, is pushed forw on.
rollers, three cheers rend the sky—it is the iyuki or WELLINGTON! }
From this night forth, he is the Hero of a Hundred and One Fights.
The siege at the Surrey Zoological will not be forgotten amongst his
future victories.
We hope the reader is satisfied with our Free Admission to the
Storm F if not, he had better go and judge for himself, and our word for
it, he will find the remedy a very pleasant one. The Surrey Zoological
Gardens are decidedly the cheapest, and the most varied, entertainment,
we cannot say in, but somewhere near Londom. Financial Reformers,
MR. Fox MAULE, and all the authorities of the Horse Guards, are strongly
recommended to be present during the Storm, if it is only to see what
an immensity of fighting can be done for ten shillings | There is one
soldier (he belongs to the First Bearkeepers) who was killed no less
than ten times in the course of the º and yet survives to plant the
British Flag on the lath and plaster heights of Badajoz. . If that is
not Glory on the cheapest scale, we should like to know what is f
Voices of the Nation.
MoNs. MARRAST, before the National Assembly was dissolved, called
upon the Representatives to give three cheers for the Republic, which
i.º. were loudly given. We must confess that for months past
the news from Paris has not been so cheering?
But, by-the-by, what should we think if, when the House of Com-
being prorogued, the Speaker called upon SIB Robert
PEEL for a song? or knocked down MR. PLUMPTRE for the Kentish
fire? or hoped the Members would not disperse without first favouring
im with “For he's aſº good fellow,” and asking Colonel

we may venture to say that there are men in

be capable of knocking anybody down.
The Blessed English Weather.
As Whitsuntide never has a syllable of sun
in it, but is invariably rainy, we suggest that,
in all the future Almanacks, Whit-Monday
be known by the more appropriate name of
Wet Monday.
Again, as it is very clear that the Clerk of
the Weather never knows his mind for two
days together, but is always changing, we
suggest that from henceforth he be known by
the name of “The Charwoman”—or “The
Laundress”—or “The º: Maid”—or
“The Cook of the Weather; ” for it is quite
preposterous to suppose that, with the pro-
verbial fickleness and incessant variability
of the English weather, the person who has
the management of it can be a man.

congratulate him on employing his time so

pation of dabbling in bricks and mortar. , The
services of Her Majesty's Consort ought to
be duly requited, and Punch, in order to reward
him in kind, hereby spreads the mortar of ap-
probation, with the trowel of sincerity, upon
a Prince who, really appears to be coming
out like a regular brick.

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
A WORD ABOUT DINNERS.
NGLISH Society, my beloved BoB
has this eminent advantage over all
other—that is, if there be any so-
ciety left in the wretched distracted
old European continent—that it is
above others, a dinner-giving
society. A people like the Germans,
that dines habitually, and with what
vast appetite I need not say, at one
. in the afternoon—like the
Italians, that spends its evenings in
Opera boxes—like the French, that
amuses itself of nights with eau
sucrée and intrigue—cannot, believe
me, understand Society rightly. I
love and admire my nation for its
d sense, its manliness, its friend-
ess, its morality in the main–
and these I take it are all expressed
in that noble institution, the dinner.
The dinner is the happy end of
the Briton's day. We work harder
than the other nations of the earth.
We do more, we live more in our
time, than Frenchmen or Germans.
Every great man amongst us likes
his dinner, and takes to it kindly.
I could mention the most august
names of ; statesmen, philo:
sophers, historians, judges, and
divines, who are great at the dinner-
table as in the field, the closet, the
- senate, or the bench. GIRBON
mentions that he wrote the first two volumes of his history, whilst a
laceman in London, lodging in St. James’s, *f to the House of
mmons, to the Čub, and to dinner every day. The man flourishes
under that generous and robust regimen; the healthy energies of society
are kept up by it; our friendly intercourse is maintained; our intellect
ripens with the good cheer, and throws off surprising crops, like the
fields about Edinburgh, under the influence of that admirable liquid,
Claret. The best wines are sent to this country therefore: for no
other deserves them as ours does.
am a diner out, and live in London. . I protest, as I look back at
the men and dinners I have seen in the last week, my mind is filled
with manly respect and pleasure. How good they have been how
admirable the entertainments' how worthy the men! .. -
Let me, without .# names, and with a cordial gratitude,
mention affew of those whom ſhave met and who have all done their duty.
Sir, I have sat at table with a great, a world-renowned statesman.
Iwatched him during the progress of the banquet—I am at liberty to
say that he enjoyed it like a man. -
. On another day, it was a celebrated literary character. It was beau-
tiful to see him at his dinner: cordial and generous, jovial and kindly,
the great author enjoyed himself as the great statesman—may he long
give us good books and good dinners! - -
Yet another day, and I sat opposite to a Right Reverend .. My
Lord, I was pleased to see good thing after good thing disappear before
#. ; and think no man ever better became that rounded episcopal apron.
ow amiable he was how kind He put water into his wine. Let us
*f; the moderation of the Church. - -
Ånd then the men learned in the law: how they dine! what hospi-
tality, what splendour, what comfort, what wine! As we walked away
very gently in the moonlight, only three º since, from the –—'s.
a friend of my youth and myself, we could hardly speak for gratitude:
“Dear Sir,”—we breathed fervently, “ask us soon again.” e newer
has too much at those perfect banquets—no hideous headaches ensue,
or horrid resolutions about adopting Revalenta Arabica for the future-
but contentment with all the world, light slumbers, joyful waking to
grapple with the morrow's work. Ah, dear BoB, those lawyers have
great merits. There is a dear old . at whose family table, if I could
see you seated, my desire in life would be pretty nearly fulfilled. If you
make yo agreeable, there you will be in a fair way to get on in the
world. But you are a youth still. Youths go to balls: men go to dinners,
Doctors, again, notoriously eat well; when my excellent friend
SANGRADo takes a bumper, and saying, with a shrug and a twinkle of
his eye, “Wideo meliora probogue, deteriora sequor,” tosses off the
wine, I always ask the butler for a glass of that bottle.
The inferior clergy, likewise, dine very much and well. I don’t know
when I have been better entertained, as far as creature comforts go,
than by men of very low church principles; and, one of the very
best repasts that ever I saw in my life was at Darlington, given by a
1:-
uaker. -
Some of the best wine in London is given to his friends by a poet of
my acquaintance. All artists are notoriously fond of dinners, and invite F
you, but not so profusely. Nº. delight in dinners on
Saturdays, and give them, thanks to the F. position of Literature,
very often and good. Dear BoB, I have seen the mahoganies of
many men.
Every evening between 7 and 8 o'clock, I like to look at the men
dressed for dinner, perambulating the western districts of our city.
I like to see the smile on their countenances lighted up with an
indescribable self-importance and good humour; the askance glances
which they cast at the little street-boys and foot-passengers who eye
their shiny boots; the dainty manner in which they trip over the
pavement on those boots, eschewing the mud-pools and dirty ...;
the refreshing whiteness of their linen; the coaxing twiddle which they
give to the ties of their white chokers—the caress of a fond parent to
an innocent child.
I like walking myself. Those who go in cabs or Broughams I have
remarked, somehow, have not the same radiant expression which the
pedestrian exhibits. A man in his own Brougham has anxieties about
the stepping of his horse, or the squaring of the groom's elbows, or
a doubt whether Jones's turn-out is not better; or whether something
is not wrong in the springs;, or whether he shall have the Brougham
out if the night is rainy. They always look tragical behind the glasses.
A cab, diner-out has commonly some cares, lest his sense of justice
should be injured by the º: of the driver (these fellows are not
uncommonly exorbitant in their demands upon gentlemen whom they
set down at good houses); lest the smell of tobacco left by the last
occupants of the vehicle (five medical students, let us say, who have
chartered the vehicle and smoked cheroots from the London University
to the play-house in the Haymarket) should infest the clothes of Tom
Lavenden who is going to Lady RosBMARY's; lest straws should stick
unobserved to the glutinous lustre of his boots—his shiny ones, and he
should ap in DIVEs's drawing-room like a poet with a tenui
ayena, or like mad Tom in the play. I hope, my dear Bob, if a straw
should ever enter a drawing-room in the wake of your boot, you will
not be much disturbed in mind. Hark ye, in confidence; I have
seen * in a hack cab. There is no harm in employing one.
There is no harm in anything matural, any more.
. I cannot help here, parenthetically relating a story which occurred
in my own youth, in the º 1815, at the time when I first made my
own entrée into society (for º must have a beginning, Bob;
and though we have been gentlemen long before the Conqueror, and
have always consorted with gentlemen, ãº: had not always attained
that haute volée of fashion which has distinguished some of us subse-
quently); I recollect, I say, in 1815, when the MARQUIs of Sweet-
BREAD was good enough to ask me and the late MR. RUFFLEs to
dinner, to meet PRINCE Sqn waRTZENBERG and the HETMAN PLATOFF.
RUFFLEs was a man a good deal about town in those days, and certainly
in very good society.
was myself a young one, and thought RUFFLEs was rather inclined
to patronise me: which I did not like. “I would have you to know, MR.
RUFFLEs,” thought I, “that, after all, a gentleman can but be a gentle-

under the porte-cochère of Sweetbread House, where two tall and

coloured coat, with waistcoat and the rest of a delicate yellow or
melted-butter colour, opened the doors of the hall—what do you think,
Sir, I did? In the presence of these gentlemen, who were holding on
at the door, I offered to toss up with RUFFLEs, heads or tails, who
should pay for the coach; and then p

A person of some note—a favourite Snob of mine (to use the words

siders a happy artifice, and sends his cab away, at the corner of the
street; so that the gentleman in livery may not behold its number, or
that lord with whom be dines, and about whom he is always talking, may
not be supposed to know that MR. SMITH came in a hack-cab.

a donkey in a lion's skin: a small pretender-distracted by doubts and
frantic terrors of what is to come next. Such a man can be no more at
ease in his chair at dinner than a man is in the fauteuil at the dentist's
(unless indeed he go to the admirable MR. GILBERT in Suffolk P
who is dragged into this essay for the benefit of mankind alone, an
who I vow removes a grinder with so little pain, that, all the world
should be made aware of him)—a fellow, I say, ashamed of the origin
from which he sprung, of the cab in which he drives, awkward
therefore, affected and unnatural, can never hope or deserve to succeed
in society. -
The great comfort of the society of great folks is, that they do not
trouble themselves, about your two-penny little person, as smaller
persons do, but take you for what you are—a man kindly and good-
natured, or witty and sarcastic, or learned and eloquent, or a good
racconteur, or a very handsome man, (and in '15 some of the Browns
were—but I am speaking of five-and-thirty years ago,) or an excellent
gourmand and judge of wines—or what not. Nobody sets you so
uickly at your ease as a fine gentleman. I have seen more noise made
.. a knight's lady than about the Duchess of FITz-BATTLEAXE
herself: and LADY MoUNTARARAT, whose family dates from the
Deluge, enter and leave a room, with her daughters, the lovely
LADies. Eve and LILITH D'ARC, with much less pretension and in
much simpler capotes and, what-do-you-call-ems, than LADY DE
MogyNs, or MRs. SHINDy, who quit an assembly in a whirlwind as it
were, with trumpets and alarums ſº. a Stage King and Queen. ..
But my pen can run no further, for my paper is out, and it is time to
dress for dinner. Let us resume this theme next week, dear youth,
and believe me in the meantime to be your affectionate
BRowN THE ELDER.
BELLES AND BEAUX WITHIN THE SOUND OF
BOW BELLS.
WHEN some antiquarian writer of a paulo-post-future age shall look
into the habits and customs of the present generation, candour w
compel him to declare, that, whatever merit we may claim for our
customs, our “habits as we live,” or, at all events, the habits of our
children, are not such as good taste can justify. The infant population
of the day might fairly call for re-dress on account of the dress wornb
our juveniles, who were never before so shockingly put upon. No salad,
no lobster, no anything within our experience, was eversubmitted to such
an incongruous sort of dressing as the dressing in which our boys and
| girls are figged out.
That extraordinary—and, as we hoped, obsolete-animal, the Girl.
§ appears to be revived in that complication of the sexes which is
exhibited in the Juvenile Fashions of the day, which make it difficult
for us to distinguish our daughters from our sons, and, by leading us to
confound one, sex. with the other, may, urge us to the unpaternal
extremity of “confounding the children” altogether.
We feel disposed to revolt against the tyrant fashion, which envelopes
our boys in the flounced trappings of what should be female finery, and
disguises our girls in the sack-like paletót. of boyhood, or the more
hateful wrap-rascal of mature manhood. Firmly and emphatically we
enter our protest º: the melancholy, masquerade in which our
children are compelled to disport themselves in conformity with the
present mode, and we can only add, that, if the trimming of the juvenile
jacket were leſt to our hands, we would trim it in a very different manner
lesson from nature, who dresse everything appropriately, and never
arraying the sober cabbage in the jaunty costume of the sweet—sweet-
pea. Nature has as good reason to deck the asparagus with the foliage of
the rhubarb, or embroider the beet-root with the flowers of the geranium,
as we have to thrust our sons into the draperies suited to our daughters,
or convert our girls into clothes-pegs, for the whole tribe of Palallas,
Paletóts, Aqua Scutums, and other registered or unregistered articles
of male attire, to hang upon.

THE TENTH OF APRIL TO LORD JOHN
JRUSSELL.
I’ve been bepuffed, bespeechified, bedined, bedrunk, besung;
Conservatism, Finality, Laissez-faire, and Statu, Quo,
Are glad to shake hands with “the Tenth.” till very proud I grow.
The specials’ ribbon round my arm, the stout oak staff I rear;
You remember how with steady will I paced the startled town,
Quelled anarchy with unarmed hand, and looked disorder down.
At home, abroad, inside and out, you think you read me true,
But when did ever Whig know man's or people's heart all through?
I am all that you style me, when your praise on me you pour;
All that, my Lord, but take my word, with that I’m something more.
I read your speech, the other night, when HuME, my stant old friend,
Asked of the House, as you did once, the suffrage to extend. |
t
Hear what the Tenth of April is, and hear what it is not.
I am the friend of Order, but Statu quo Iloathe,
The Law.iheed, but still would weed, and trim and guide its growth;
Finality, your present love, unlovely is to me;
That “what is, is,” proves not, I wis, that what is ought to be.
You saw my tens of thousands how forth gainst those I drew,
Who would have tumbled old things down, and for them set up new;
I said “no” to Revolution, for had I not Reform?
“Content” you think I was, and so, noways for change athirst;
tent men are with second best, in preference to worst :
Qontent to hold up half a truth, when all truth shakes to fall;
Content with what gives half a loaf, against no bread at all!
But yet no ways content, LoRD John, to see some things I see,
As a .# House of Commons, and a helpless Ministry,
A nation little taught, a Church under and overpaid,
And prone Respectability in Mammon-service laid.
Great towns o'erbrimming with their scum, great stews of plague and sin;
Toil that should proudly bear itself, in grossness sunk and gin;
Crime stored away to ripen in settlement and gaol;
The rich for wealth, the poor for want, alike forpined and pale.
And all about the barriers that hedge your Commons round,
A great sea, chaſing ceaselessly, half-marked, and under ground;
Were it not well to think, LoRD JoHN, on this truth vouched by me,
That I, even I, “the Tenth.” have helped to swell that threatening sea?
It is not turbulence, alone, its way would force, my Lord,
But self-respecting toil would fain its honest vote record,
And stares, thank you and those with you, its worthy self to find,
In chorus with the madness it last year helped to bind.
Then think, my Lord, and you, his friends, who deem those overbold,
That bid you move along the paths you entered on of old,
Think how delay may order with anarchy combine,
And to disaffection’s vinegar turn loyalty's strong wine.
Mistake me not for what I’m not, know me for what I am,
The nursing mother of Reform, not Revolution's dam;
- is the spirit that erst reared our d’s throne on law,
That never bore a lie it knew, nor blinked a truth it saw.
*Fre you fool us with Finality, of all bad pleas the worst,
'tis the Tenth of April you invoke, and not the First.

in the parish of Marton-in-Cleveland, in Yorkshire, where it is proposed
to erect a building which shall be a Sunday School and also a monument
to CAPTAIN Cook. A fine idea is involved in this scheme. Our utter
inability to produce a decent statue, is a fact settled. As yet British
Sculpture has not risen above the tobacconist's images. We set Magogs

A BILL is going through Parlia-
ment to entail upon every one the
necessity of consuming his own
smoke. We presume that a dull de-
i bater, who delivers along harangue,
which ends in smoke, will, under
the new law, be compelled to eat
his own words. There certainly
seems to be some difficulty in dealing
with smoke, for, when Honourable
Members have tried to lay hold of
it on previous occasions, it has
almost always slipped through their
fingers. If no better method can
be devised for disposing of the
smoke, perhaps Parliament will
adopt our suggestion, and cause all
the smoke in the kingdom to be
“gracefully, curled,”, after the
fashion alluded to in the beautiful
ballad of the Woodpecker. As far as
mere oratorical smoke is concerned,
we should have no objection to enter
into a contract to get rid of the
whole of it, by undertaking that, in
every instance where a speaker is
disposed to fume, we will have an
| extinguisher ready to clap down
upon him.

THE Annual Festival of this ad-

Monday last, and went off with
many corks. The ingenuous public,
in the amiable infatuation that
there is stilla Drury Lane Company

all their wonted simplicity. We
understand, however, that the calls
upon the Fund have of late been
very heavy. Several new annuitants
(Drury Lane Actors of course) have
declared themselves: amongst them,
the distinguished horse “Atar

by M. ADoLPHE FRANCONI. We
further understand that “The

horseback by M. M. Loisset AINE,
A. NIEF, and LE PETIT LoissET, is
now upon Drury Lane Fund, and
that the name of M. AURIoI, the
“Vanishing Clown,” is visible on
the books of the Institution. When
we consider the wonderful efforts
of these distinguished artists in the

flourishing at Drury Lane,—we can-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
in the late storm, he hadn't a single pane
IN HAIL-STONES.
“MR. PUNCH,-AT this
awful crisis, when our
beloved and venerated
Constitution is again a-
bout to be annihilated-
(I have, myself, though
§ only a middle-aged En-
lishman, seen the afore-
said Constitution to all appearance dead at least, twenty º only
somehow it has as often recovered)—when, I say, all that we hold dear
as Christians, and as men who pay our way and honour the QUEEN,
is about to be torm from us by the revolutio hands of an unprin-
cipled Whig ministry-it behoves us to attend to portents, of little
influence, I fear, upon the benighted minds of Whigs and Free-thinkers,
“Mr. Punch, I allude to the late hail-storm. Sir, consider that
storm—look into any one'or all of those hail-stones with your unfailing
judgment, and perspicuity, and then say if the Government of this
country is not signally warmed from any further progress in the unholy
Jews' Bill; a Bill, the object of which is to make the House of
Commons nothing more than a House of Ease to the Synagogue.
“I take the i. pregnant paragraph from the Standard:-
“‘BARon Rothschild, of Gunnerbury House, Acton, had 3,940 squares of glass
broken with the hail-stones which fell about two o'clock on Tuesday last, during the
violence of the thunder-storm. Two market gardeners living at Starch Green had more
than 1,000 panes broken. Mr. Day, of Hammersmith, had many smashed; also a
great number of private dwellings round Turnham Green had the windows broken.
Some of the hail-stones were nearly two inches long, and of an uneven oblong shape.
“In the lively hope that the editor of the Standard himself would
pen one of his own beautiful biblio-political leaders upon the alarmin
signs made manifest in the above, I have not taken up my quill, unti
such hope has died within me. But, the Standard silent, I feel it
would be treasonous to remain one moment longer silent upon these
hail-stones. -
“What do they º when, descending amidst thunder, they smash
3,940 squares of glass of an elected Hebrew —What do they, in an
especial manner, prove—but that the Jew is marked as of an outcast
race, doomed for ever and ever to suffer panes and penalties?_I look
upon every broken glass as a vote against the admission of the Hebrew
into Parliament. Whatever may be LoRD Russell's venal majority,
here, I may say, are 3,940 cracked members against him. -
“That “two market gardeners’ and ‘MR. DAY of Hammersmith had
many [panes] smashed,' is a further proof that these hail-stones did not
fall for nothing; these people (I have no doubt of it) being tainted with
that wretched liberalism that, making our venerable Parliament a thing
of all shades and colours, would make no difference between Mr. MuNTz
and MR. Moses, SolomoN MoRDECAI and Colon EL SIBTHoRP. This
fact is, however, awfully evident. The hail-stones, fell only upon the
panes of a Hebrew and upon those of Hebrew tendencies. The glass
of real Christians stood the thunder-storm without a flaw.
“And then, Mr. Punch, consider the shape of the hail-stones (I send
you two for your inspection, preserved in spirits). You will perceive
that, as the account states, they are ‘of an uneven oblong shape.’ Is
there no sign shown in this? pect the stones, Sir. Hold them to
the light; turn them as you may,+and say, are they not of a wedge-like
}.} And what does a we ge signify? ...Why, simply, this: only
insert the small end in a fracture of the British Oak,+and with a few
blows to follow, you rend the mighty timber in twain, bringing, with a
thundering crash to the earth, the pride and º of centuries! It is
impossible, Sir, with a healthy eye not to see this, and very much
more, in any one of these hail-stones. - - - -
“However, I hope there is yet time to save our beloved Constitution.
And if the late storm should, even at the twelfth hour, induce the
QUEEN to withhold her assent to the Jews' Bill,—then, Sir, shall I and
every man of proper feeling look upon every one of those hail-stones as
SERMONS
the brightest jewel in HER MAJESTY's diadem.
“I remain, Mr. Punch, yours,

THE Power of REFLECTION."
THE most extraordinary thing in connexion with Gin Palaces, not-
withstanding the profusion of every known and unknown ornament, is
the absence of mirrors. This may be accounted, for, by the fact that
publicans are well aware that, if a drunkard could only see himself, he
would immediately turn away in horror from the Glass.
PARLIAMENT FOR EXPORTATION.
WE believe it is in the power of any enterprising manager and
eosmopolite to do a fine thing and make a good deal of money—to de-
serve well of his own country and other nations too—by taking abroad
a troop of English actors, and giving a series of Parliamentary Nights
on the Continent. The French and our other neighbours would rush
in crowds to see how we settle our political affairs; and, certainly, we
manage these things better here than they do in France, or anywhere
else in Europe. It is needless to say that they would derive as much
amusement as instruction from the performances; for, of course, all
the wit, as well as the wisdom, of Parliament would be retained in its
dramatic representation. .
.The details of our project may be briefly stated. Let a theatre be
hired, and a couple of scenes be painted, faithfully resembling the inte-
riors of the Houses of Lords and Commons. The costumes of the
actors shall be copied carefully from those of the originals; the making
up of MUNTz, SIBTHoRP, or, BRough AM, would alone be highly
diverting to the spectators; and there would be an interesting dro ery
in the mere externals of PEEL. The personation of i.i.
would not be a matter of difficulty. Low i. men might easily be
found to enact the part of a noble and learned Lord, and a gallant
Colonel, already mentioned; and genteel comedians to sustain that of
the Ex and the present Premier. For the facility of the undertaking,
it luckily happens that the leading characters to be enacted are few,
and require no very great amount of ability to fill them. -
The bulk of the Houses might be composed of supernumeraries, which
would, indeed, accord with the truth. The stammering, blundering,
.# bad grammar, and brogue of the original speakers should be
correctly imitated; and thus the audience would gain an idea of the
debates more accurate than what the British public derives from re-
porters. To illustrate the difficulty of hearing in the House of Lords,
their Lordships' proceedings might sometimes be expressed in dumb
show. Thus, the performances of the Peers would occasionally consist
of Pantomime; and we need hardly indicate the noble and learned Lord
who would, of course, be identified with Clown. If the depressed
state of our Drama is to be at all ascribed to the encouragement of
foreign actors, let us compete with them boldly on their own ground;
and while they teach us to sing and dance, show them how to act the
part of legislators.
A NOTION OF BAD BOOKS 1
At the recent Meeting of the “National Society for Promoting the
Education of the Poor,” the Rev. E. Sugden is reported by the
Morning Post to have spoken these words:—
“Would it be believed that the Committee of the Privy Council were encouraging the
Masters and Mistresses of the Society to read novels? He found this question as part
of an examination:—‘Give some account of the lives and writings of any of these
writers: CHAUckR, SHARsri:ARE, BAcon, MILTON, ADAM SMITH, SAMUEL Johnson,
Coopert, and WALTER Scott.' (Laughter). Another question was, ‘Give a life of
MRs. FRY, or Flora Mac Ivok." (Great laughter.)"
Wery shocking, doubtless, to demand from National School Teachers
an acquaintance with the biographies and works of such profane
characters! [By the way, we must remind MR. SUGDEN that they are
not all novelists.] Can such an enormity be paralleled? Humph 1 let
us see. “Give some account of the #. and writings of HomER,
Sophocles, ARISTOTLE, VIRGIL, PLATO, and Cicero.” Here we have
poets, a playwright, and political and moral philosophers, all heathens
and writing in Greek and Latin as heathen as themselves. Horrid
wretches | There are also those yet more unholy individuals
ARISTOPHANES, HoRACE, TERENCE, ind Juven AL. Does MR. Sugpen
know that a knowledge of the lives and writings of these wicked
fellows is required of candidates for the office of Teacher in the
Church? That is to say, was MR. SUGDEN ever at Oxford or
Cambridge? -
There was also an ancient novelist called APULEIUs, and—we intend
no personality to any one—he wrote “The Golden Ass.” We presume
MR. Sugden would not consider the study of this writer unprofitable
to a College Tutor. Is a National School Teacher less likely to be
edified by him who drew Jeannie Deans ?
An Appropriate Envoy.
IN the Times' Parisian intelligence the other day, it was stated that-
“The French Government received on Tuesday morning, the 5th instant, the official
news that M. Lesseps, the Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at Rome, had posi-
tively become deranged in his intellect.”
We sincerely hope that this piece of news is a hoax; but, if
M. Lessers has really gone mad, we can only say—considering the
character of Gallic intervention in Roman affairs—that he has become
the best possible representative of the French Government at Rome.

“excursion” system, which occasions." s” to LoRD BRough AM, and is
the cause of many “chambers” being “let off” in the various hotels visited by
the Excursionists. - -
WoRDsworth's Eccursion, is by many, considered both long and tedious,
but what is, it to CRISP's Excursions?. This enterprising gentleman ought
to advertise like the bakers—“Another CRISP batch just going off.”
He will, of course, ſº extend the area of his operations: Why should
he not have his agents at St. Petersburgh, the Cape, Behring's Straits, and
the Far West, with intermediate stations, to bring, about a vast chain of inter-
national visits, putting a girdle about the Earth, like Puck, in some time as
near forty minutes as railways can compass? -
Why shouldn't China send its mandarins to the outer barbarians, and prove to
the flower of the flowery land, that a rose may smell as sweet by any other than
its Chinese name of Fi-fo-fum?
Why shouldn't CRISP catch a Tartar, and make the Malays run a-muck
through the crowds of the Strand? - - - - - - - - - - - -
He might turn an extra penny, by exhibiting his visitors “alive, alive,” in
their carriages, at the stations, and thus make them pay for seeing the English,
at the same time that he made the English pay for seeing them. The notion
ws upon us as we write.
Think of an illustrated prospectus of CRISP's d Scheme of Universal
international visits for the many millions, whom the geography books declare
to be in the world!
Only think of all that such an idea takes in, or might take in, unless LoRD
BRough AM got it stopped by his influence with all civilised and savage
legislatures. - - - -
There would be one way to disarm his Lordship's opposition to the speculation.
Give him the management of it.
MUSIC AL FRESCO FOR THE MILLION.
It says a great deal for the popularity of the Concerts of Mons. JudLIEN
at Exeter Hall, that, in order to accommodate the public, he has thrown open the
Western Area for one shilling. This is by no means an outside price for an
outside place, and since, the experiment of opening the Western Area has
been tried, we have no doubt it will put an end to the shabby practice of
those area sneaks, who used to sit upon the steps and listen to the music
without º; for admission to the Concert. If Julien opens the Area of
Exeter at so much per head, why should not BATTY it a portion of
the public to the stables of his establishment, an arrangement we should be
happy to patronise by taking a stall immediately.
A STAYED Thought—Woman would stab herself with her scissors, if she
thought she was no better than what Fashion has made her! (Ladies are
requested to put this in their Albums).
THE (SEA) AIR AND MANY FRIENDS.
A vigorous attempt is being made, through the medium of
advertisements, to get up a sensation in favour of our old friend
Herne Bay. ... Some anonymous enthusiastis continually calling
attention to its “mossy slopes,” and its “delicious declivities,”
the latter being really beyond doubt, for the place has long
been upon the decline in spite of our attempts to get it up
again. Who can it be that is thus pertinacious and prodigal in
F. out his praise, and pulling out his purse, with the
nevolent intention of cro the most retired of Bºys with
the most conspicuous of laurels. The pier is, we it, a
magnificent pile, or rather series of piles, and the Air is
certainly so exceedingly worthy of our respect, that we
instinctively touch, our hats whenever we encounter it; but
the advertiser of the merits of the Bay forgets to notice the
fact, that the fares by steamboat are about a third more
they are for going some forty miles further, and that it is even
cheaper to go beyond Herne Bay, in the Herne Bay Boat, than
to mbark at that, otherwise highly-favoured locality.
Perhaps it is considered that the privilege of º
such an elysium.ought to be purchased by paying more t

certainly is, that, as far as mere fares are concerned, if we go
further than Herne Bay we shall fare better.

PUNCH*S LAW GRAMMAR.
THERE are four parts of Law Grammar, as of every other Grammar,
namely, Letters, Syllables, Words, and Sentences.
Letters.
A Letter is the first Jºple or commencement of Law, such as a
Letter for payment of debt.
There are several varieties of Letters, including great and small, or
long and short; but a demand for money in some shape is the long and
short of every s Letter.
In Lawyers', as in other Letters, we meet with vowels, but the prin-
cipal vowels are I.O.U., which form almost the entire basis of the
legal alphabet.
Among Lawyers' Letters we meet with consonants, as well as with
mutes—the consonants consisting of those letters which are followed
by other letters, and the mutes consisting of those letters which pro-
duce no sound; or, in other words, obtain no answer.
A legal diphthong is a combination of two letters, which are em-
ployed when it is intended to touch up the person written to rather
sharply; the thong of the diph-thong acting as a sort of lash for that
purpose.
". letter H is generally excluded from the legal, as well as from
the Latin alphabet, for H being merely a note of breathing hard, it is
thought superfluous to introduce it into the language of Law, where
breathing time is seldom allowable.
Lawyers' Letters are not without liquids, but there is one liquid,
commonly known as hot water, which appears to pervade the entire
legal alphabet, and may be called not only one of its elements, but the
very element from which its vitality is chiefly derived.
Syllables.
A Syllable is made up of one or more letters, and in the Legal
Grammar we can give no better definition of the word Syllable than
such as may be implied in the first part of it, which shows a degree of
silliness in getting into Lawyers' Letters at all. , Perhaps a more
refined philologist might discover in the word Syllable that dangerous
Scylla on the Plaintiff’s side of the legal gulf, which has a Charybdis on
the Defendant's side to correspond, when any correspondence by means
of Lawyers’ Letters is once begun.
Words.
Words are the very essence of the Lawyer's language, and it is one of
the proudest achievements of the legal craftsman to make as much as
possible out of a few Words. . It is usual also to consider Words in their
ordinary grammatical character of Parts of Speech, but it frequently
happens that, in a Lawyer's speech, Words are not merely Parts of
Speech, for the speech being nothing but Words, it cannot be said that
they are merely parts of it.
. In Law, as in Latin, and English, there are two Numbers, the
Singular and the Plural, but the lº. themselves are often apt to
forget that there is more than one Number—that Number being of
course. Number One.
With reference to Cases, it would be difficult to place any limit to
them, for it is one of the leading rules of the Law Grammarian to mul-
tiply Cases indefinitely, and prolong them ad infinitum whenever they
can be formed. We will, however, attempt to explain some of the
jº." Cases, by assimilating them to the Latin Cases as nearly
as 1016.
The first sort of Case may be called the Nominative or Naming Case,
which answers the question Who? or What? by ascertaining Who’s
Who? or What's What? The object of the Case being to fix a person
with a liability, or to determine that for which he is liable, this Case
may properly be called the Nominative or Naming Case, because it is
necessary in such a Case that the party who is the object of the Case
should be properly named, and the matter in dispute correctly stated.
.The second Case may be called the Genitive or ...; ase, (from
9igno to beget) and as it is a great point among Lawyers that one Case
; *. the Genitive Case is exceedingly popular with the
raternity.
he Dative Case (from do to give) seems at first sight out of place |!
in the Law Grammar, for the word give is almost unknown to the legal
language, but on a closer inspection it will be seen that the Dative is not
improperly regarded as a legal Case, since there is scarcely a Case com:
menced against any individual without a strong desire to “give it him.”
The Accusative Case (from accuso to accuse) speaks almost for itself,
and the best illustrations of the Accusative Case may be found in the
Cases at the Old Bailey.
. The Vocative Case (from poco to call) is a Case very
in the lan of the Law, for it is usually the Case in
has been before he proceeds, as it is customary to call for money due,
until the imattention paid to the Wocative is pro-vocative of a law-suit.
In numerous, instances the Vocative is wanting, and, in fact, it is
natural enough that, in a Case of calling, there hould be something
commonly used
instantly on his legs.
wanted. The Vocative is invariably wanting in the first, person
Singular, or Number One, which, has been already described as the
lawyer himself, who is continually * money, and sometimes
for it with a pertinacious use of the Vocative, that proves
exceedingly disagreeable.
The last Case that needs to be specifi

Away Case, (from ab, signifying from, and fero, making

ases terminate, for they all end in taking away more or less from

COOL READING FOR WARM WEATHER.
ET one try as one may, there is nothing
to be found more amusing than the
Debates, when the House goes into a
Committee of Supply. . The coolness
with which hundreds of thousands are
voted away, as if pounds were pence,
is quite refreshing in this warm weather.
The swarms of Mosquitos that annually
prey upon JoHN BULL are enough to
sting the poor fellow into a state of
madness. The first law of our Political
Economy seems to be Extravagance. If
we are a nation of shopkeepers, it
must be confessed that our till is open
to º who chooses to dip his hand
into it. If a German prince leaves his
little Brecklenburg Square of a territory, we have to pay his turnpikes,
and all his expenses upon the road, before he will come and put his legs
under our mahogany; No wonder that the Demands. on the English
purse are so plentiful, when the Supplies are so bountiful!
The most amusing part of these cool Debates is, no matter what the
objections may be against any proposed extravagance, the sum demanded
is sure to be voted. Supposing there is a division *}. twenty
members are found hardy enough to enlist in it. in fact, Economy
in the House of Commons is such a forlorn hope, that scarcely a soul
has the courage to volunteer. Defeat is certain. Occasionally a small
cry of Retrenchment is heard; it is responded to "h. faint cheer
or two, and then is not heard again for another year. There is a great
| talk about reduction; and it is only talk, for the reductions are so
small, that we doubt if the Microscopical Society, with their strongest
magnifying glasses, would be able to see them. - -
Another amusing feature in these Debates is, when any reduction is
suggested in the salary of a Government officer, every official is

wonderful, when they are attacked. They all . to a boy, that the
work cannot, possibly be done, for a farthing less. The GREYs turn
blue with indignation—ELLIOTT's Entire is in a state of the greatest
fermentation.
Insolvents are fº censured when they spend money before
they have received it, that is to say, when they incur debts which
they fancy they can pay—if all their calculations, turn out guineas.
Government does the same thing on the largest scale. They lavish mil-
lions before they have got a single sixpence of it, and then coolly ask
Parliament to sanction the outlay. It is lucky there is no Portugal
Street for England, or else wouldn't LoRD John be remanded for a
couple of years!
AN ANSWER IS RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED.
THERE is a little book advertised, called “The Plain Speaker.”
Whom can it allude to? Is it MR. Rob Ruck? for he speaks, at times,
too plainly to be pleasant: or is it MR. John Q'Connell,” for his
speeches are so very plain, that the reporters declare there is nothing
in them to take hold of; or is it.MR. Chisholm ANSTEY” for one of his
speeches runs to such an unlimited extent of plain, that QAMILLA
herself could not seour it, even with the pails of patience, and proba-
bility by her side; or is it our friend LoRD BRough AM?, who º
is a “Plain Speaker,” if ever there was one ; or is the book addresse
generally to the House of Lords? where, owing to the defective hearing,
a little plain speaking would be a great boon to those who are con-
demned to listen, and report, if they can?. If the book does not apply
to any one of the above gentlemen, is it, intended for the Speaker of
the House of Commons? for if it does, then it is a gross libel on a gen-
tleman whose arduous duties, and undaunted heroism, and uncom-
plaining endurance, deserve the respect and sympathy of every well-
which the client constituted mind.
PARLIAMENTARY DUMB-WAITERS.
As nothing is heard in the House of Lords beyond a mere hum, we
suggest that it be called “The New Hummums.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 249
MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
On SOME OLD CUSTOMS OF THE DINNER-TABLE.
F all the sciences which
have made a progress in
late years, I think, dear
Bob (to return to the
subject from which I
parted with so much
pleasure last week), that
the art of dinner-giving
has made the most de-
lightful and rapid ad-
vances. Sir, I maintain,
even now with a ma-
tured age and appetite,
that the dinners of this
K. this decided improve-
- ment in our civilisation.
| Those who remember
§º the usages of five-and-
twenty years back will
be ready, I am sure, to
acknowledge this pro-
gress.-I was turning
over at the Club yester-
day a queer little book
written at that period
which, I believe, had
some authority at the
time, and which records, some of those customs which obtained, if not in good
fondon Society, at least in some companies, and parts of our island, Sir, many of
these practices seem as antiquated now, as the usages described in the accounts of
Homeric feasts, or QUEEN ELIZABETH's banquets and breakfasts. Let us be
happy to think they are gone.
e book in question is called The Marims of Sir Morgan O'Doherty, a queer
baronet, who appears to have lived in the first quarter of the century, and whose
opinions the antiquarian may examine, not without profit—a strange barbarian indeed
it is, and one wonders that such customs should ever have been prevalent in our
country.
F 3. such opinions as these having ever been holden by any set of men among
us. .. 2. “It is laid down in fashionable life that you must drink champagne
after white cheeses, water after red.”. . . . “Ale is to be avoided, in case a wet
night is to be expected, as should cheese also.” Maxim 4. “A fine singer, after
dinner, is to be avoided, for he is a great bore, and stops the wine One of
the best rules (to put him down) is to applaud him most vociferously as soon as he
has sung the first verse, as if all was over, and say to the gentleman furthest from
you at table that you. admire the conclusion of this, song very much.”, Maxim 25,
‘...You meet people occasionally who tell you it is bad taste to give champagne at
dinner—Port and Teneriffe being such superior drinking,” &c., &c. I am copying
out of a book printed three months since, describing ways prevalent when you were
born, Can it be possible, I say, that England was ever in such a state?
Was it, ever a maxim in “fashionable life” that you were to drink Champagne
after white, cheeses. . What was that fashionable life about drinking and about
cheese? The maxim in fashionable life is to drink what you will. It is too simple
now to trouble itself about wine or about cheese. Ale, again is to be avoided, this
strange Doherty says, if you expect a wet night-and in another place says, “the
English drink a pint of porter at a draught.”—What English gracious powers!
Are we a nation of coalheavers? Do we ever have a wet night? Do we ever meet
Fº occasionally who say that to give Champagne at dinner is bad taste, and that
ort and Teneriffe are such superior drinking? Fancy Teneriffe, my dear boy—I
say fancy a man asking you to drink Teneriffe at dinner; the mind shudders at it—
he tº: as well invite you to swallow the Peak,
And then consider the maxim about the fine singer who is to be avoided. . What!
was there a time within most people's memory, when folks at dessert began to sing f
I have heard such a thing at a tenants' dinner in the country; but the idea of a fellow
i. to perform a song at a dinner-party in London, fills my mind with terror
and amazement; and I picture to myself any table which I frequent, in Mayfair, in
Bloomsbury, in Belgravia, or where you will, and the pain which would seize upon
the host and the company if some wretch were to commence a song.
We have passed that savage period of life. We do not want to hear songs from
guests—we have the songs done for us: as we don’t want our ladies to go down
into the kitchen, and cook, the dinner any more. The cook can do it better and
cheaper. We do not desire feats of musical or culinary skill—but simple, quiet,
easy unpretending conversation. ...
In like manner, there was a practice once usual, and which, still lingers here and
there, of making complimentary speeches after dinner; that custom is happily

almost entirely discontinued. Gentlemen do not meet to
compliment each other profusely, or to make fine phrases.
Simplicity gains upon us daily. Let us be t ul that
the florid style is disappearing.
I once shared a bottle of sherry with a commercial
traveller at Margate who gave a toast or a sentiment as he
filled every glass. He would not take his wine without this
queer ceremony before it. I recollect one of his sentiments,
which was as follows: “Year is to 'er who doubles our
joys, and divides our sorrows—I give you woman, Sir,”—
and we both emptied our fl. These lumbering cere-
monials are passing out of our manners, and were found
only to obstruct our free intercourse. People can like each
other just as much without orations, and be* as merry
without being forced to drink against their will.
And yet there are certain customs to which one, clings
still; for instance, the practice of drinking wine with your
º †† wisely not so frequently indulged in as
of old, yet still obtains and I trust will never be abolished.
For though, in the old time, when MR. and MRs. Fogy had
sixteen friends to dinner, it became an insupportable corvée
for MR. F. to ask sixteen persons to drink wine, and a
painful task for MRs. Fogy to be called upon to bow to ten
ſº who desired to have the honour to drink her
ealth, yet employed in moderation that ancient custom of
challenging your friends to drink is a kindly and hearty old
usage, and productive of many most beneficial results.
I have known a man of a modest and reserved turn (just
like your old uncle, dear Bob, as no doubt you were going
to remark), when asked to drink by the host, suddenly
lighten up, toss off his glass, get confidence, and begin to
talk right and left. He wanted but the spur to set him
; It is supplied by the butler at the back of his
Chalr.
It sometimes happens again, that a host's conversational
owers are not brilliant. I own that I could point out a
ew such whom I have the honour, to name among my
friends—gentlemen, in fact, who wisely hold their tongues
because they have nothing to say which is worth the hear-
ing or the telling, and properly confine themselves to the
carving of the mutton and the ordering of the wines.
Such men, manifestly, should always be allowed, may en-
couraged, to ask their guests to take wine. In *:
that hospitable question, they show their goodwill, an
cannot possibly betray their mental deficiency. For ex-
ample, let us suppose Jones, who has been perfectly silent
all dinner-time, oppressed doubtless, by that awful LADY
TLARA, who sits swelling on his right hand, suddenly rallies,
singles me out, and with a loud cheering voice, cries,
“BRown, my boy, a glass of wine.” I reply, “With
pleasure my dear Jones.” He responds as quick as
thought, “Shall it be Hock or Cham e, BRowN ?”
I mention the wine which I prefer. He to the butler,
and says, “Some Champagne or Hock”. (as the case may
be, for Í don’t choose to commit myself), “Some Cham-
F. or Hºck; to MR. BRowN;” and finally he says,
‘Good health !” in a pleasant tone. Thus, you see, Jones,
though not a conversationist, has had the opportunity of
making no less than four observations, which, if not
brilliant or witty, are yet manly, sensible, and agreeable.
And I defy, any man in the metropolis, be he the most
accomplished, the most learned, the wisest, or the most
eloquent, to . than Jones upon a similar occasion.
you have had a difference with a man, and are desirous
to make it up, how Fº it is to take wine with him.
Nothing is said but that simple *: which has just been
uttered by my friend Joxes; and yet it means a great deal.
The cup is a symbol of reconciliation. The other party
drinks up your goodwill as you accept his token of return-
ing friendship—and thus the liquor is hallowed which
Jon Es has paid for: and I like to think that the grape
which grew by Rhine or Rhone was born and ripened
under the sun there, so as to be the means of ºf;
two good fellows together. I once heard the Head-Phy-
sician of a Hydropathic establishment on the sunny banks
of the first named river, give the health of His Majesty the
KING OF PRUssia, and, calling upon the company to receive
that august toast with a “domnerndes Lebehoch,” toss off
a bumper of sparkling water. . It did not seem to me a
genuine enthusiasm. No, no, let us have toast and wine,
not toast and water. It was not in vain that grapes grew
on the hills of father Rhine. -
One seldom asks ladies now to take wine,—except when,
in a confidential whisper to the charming creature whom
you have brought down to dinner, you humbly ask per-

HOPES AND FEARS OF THE DRAMA.
ANDERSON v. STAMMERS:

future lessee of Drury Lane, made a sweet
speech. A speech that trickled into men's
opening hearts like melted honey. He

And then the lessee smiled as a very stron
man, smiles, conscious of the mind an
heart within him. (CRIBB was wont to
smile in such a way, ere he set-to with
MoLYNEux.)
“All he could say was [thus spoke the hopeful
lessee) the greater the danger the greater the glory,
if he succeeded, and if he failed, his great attempt
would honour his funeral.”
For ourselves, we do not perceive by
what theatrical means, the failure of MR.
ANDERson could be made to decorate his
hearse, unless, indeed, it carried his own ostrich feathers. Perhaps
Mr. WILMot, late stage-director, might marshal the tradesmen (they
are used to the ts of mourners at managerial obsequies) in a signi-
ficant and touching manner. However, far distant be the day, when
they shall be called upon to accompany the remains of MR. Andrason.
to Westminster Abbey. Nevertheless, even the transient thought of
such a solemnity had a serious effect upon the feelings of certain unso-
phisticated actors present. HARLEY (as the Master of the Fund), with
a gush of affeetion towards the legitimate drama, threw himself upon
the neck of the lessee, and hysterically whispered—“I’m yours at £20
a-week; ” whilst the Secretary, seizing a decanter, drowned his
emotions—like so many blind kittens—in a torrent of fluid. Every way,
MR. ANDERson, as the future lessee, loomed upon the imagination of
the actors, as withal a very gigantic and very hopeful presence. When
we perused the proceedings, we joined in this feeling. What, however,
was our disappointment when—next morning—we read a letter from
Joseph STAMMERs; which letter went to deprive MR. ANDERSON of
any chance of an honourable funeral as Drury Lane lessee! ...For
Ma. Julien had signed an agreement to MR. StaMMERs, who writes:
“By this agreement. I become the lessee of Drury Lane. Theatre from the 13th of
December, 1849, to the 30th of April, 1850, and for a similar term in the years 1850-51,
and 1851-52, The theatre will be opened under my management, for dramatic and
operatic performances, on the 26th of December next."
h such a
At the time we write, we know not how the matter will be decided.
It is, however, our opinion, that JAMEs ANDERson ought to fervently
wish that the lesseeship may fall to Joseph STAMMERs, whilst Joseph
STAMMERs should, every day, prefer an earnest prayer that such dignity
may descend upon JAMEs. AndERson.
Any way, however, it is pleasing to reflect that the public will be the
gainers. A handsome, and no less honourable managerial funeral is
certain to take place. Pertinentserolls and gorgeous stage banners will
be exhibited about the hearse; whilst the money-takers (or the men
who hoped to be money-takers) will fire a round of blank cartridge in

ATROCIOUS BREACH OF PRIWILEGE.
THE practising short-hand writers have addressed a petition to the
House of Commons, which for cool sarcasm and impudent irony
surpasses anything that ever brought a printer to the bar of St.
Stephen's. They actually
“Begrespectfully to call the attention of your Honourable House to the fact that
vast numbers of HER MAJEsty's subjects, at home and abroad, would consider it a matter
of the highest importance if, under the sanction and authority of your Honourable
House, the very words used in Parliament were recorded and generally accessible.”
. Not satisfied with this overt act which is evidence to satisfy any
jury of the existence of a conspiracy among these men “to bring the
House into ridicule and contempt,” they express their belief that
some mode might be found of publishing these verbatim reports for
general circulation, and thus actually bringing their libel home to
men's businesses and bosoms, like the Times or any other daily print
that adorns the breakfast table.
Verbatim reports' Have these wretched men calculated the length
of parliamentary speeches and the shortness of human life? Do they
intend to bring English Grammar into disrepute by showing how little
it is regarded by our collective wisdom? Do they intend to corrupt
the public mind of England by inundating it with the sophistry º:
tautology, the utter absurdity that is now painfully sorted out &f the
debates before they are inflicted upon us by the newspaper rters,
whose function is like that of the dustnan, to sift cinders and refuse
heaps, and present us with the stray silver spoons? Do they intend
to turn loose on the family breakfast table whole herds of Irish bulls,
and so expose every house to the bovine intrusions that are now
confined to a radius of half a mile round Smithfield? Or do they, worse
than all, intend to put a stop to the circulation of Punch, by supplying
food for laughter cold drawn from the mouths of the members of the
House of Commons f
In whatever light it be considered, this attempt must be crushed
promptly and decisively.
If it be persevered in or countenanced for one moment by MR. JoHN
O'Connell, or any other member anxious to see his own nonsense
º we beg to warn Honourable Members that we shall
publish a bit of a verbatim debate ourselves, which we are convinced
will so arouse public opinion to the nuisance about to be inflicted on
the country, that its indignant expression will terrify the House into
instant submission, and confine Parliamentary talk for ever to its
present channel of publicity, which, patience knows, is wide enough
and long enough to render the wading along it a tedious task. Luckily
the shallowness of the stream is proportioned to the extent it covers,
or the public would be drowned in it, instead of draggled.
Military Diversion.
GENERAL OUDINor, in one of his late dispatches to the French
Government, writes as follows:—
“The enemy, occupied by a serious diversion which I had ordered on the side of the
Villas Casini and Valentini, did not fire a single shot on our workmen."
The General is quite right in calling the operation which he alludes
to a serious diversion; for, whether regarded as a game of balls or a
tragedy, it is a very serious diversion to all concerned, especially to the
Roman people. , Indeed, the diversion of Republicans committi
fratricide is much too serious to be laughed at, and we hiss it with
our powers of sibilation.
The IRIshi. FARCEurt.
WE shall be glad to know when MR. John O'Connell, intends to
abandon his by no means popular part in the farce of Turn Out. It is
understood that a new song is being prepared for the honourable
Member to the tune of “Clare de Kitchen,” under the new title of
“Clare de Commons.”
A HEAVY BLOW AND GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT.
It seems that £120,000 have been spent in ventilating *.
We may fairly say of this money as Othello did of all his “fond love”
for Desdemona:—
“We give it to the winds—'tis gone."
IT Runs BOTH HIGH AND LOW.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 251
A wºrren in an Irish periodical has attempted to prove in a long
article, that the world has been doing gross injustice to the Crocodile
family, who, like many other families, require only to be known to be
loved and respected. The authorintimates that the Crocodile, so far
from being a malicious reptile, is rather a jolly dog; and we are led to
infer that the Crocodile's tears which we have usually considered all
his eye, are in fact the outgushings of a nature full of sentiment, or
—more graphically speaking-ginger-beery with benevolence. -
We must confess that we want some further proof of the Crocodile's
admissibility to our social confidence before we should like to extend
to him the hand of friendship; for if we are to allow the Crocodile to
speak for himself, he must be condemned out of his own mouth
unless we are to believe that he is harmless in the very teeth of aii
appearances. His teeth must have been sadly overdrawn, if he is really
the inoffensive animal that the Irish writer represents him to be, and
we are puzzled what to believe when we recollect the many pictures
we have seen of men running away from Crocodiles, the fugitives
showing, by marks on their legs and hands, that if asked for the
character of the Crocodile, they might point to their lacerated limbs,
as much as to say in legal phraseology—“These Indentures witness.”
In spite of the effort that has been made to recommend the Croco-
dile to our polite attention, we shall, for the present, continue our
slight acquaintance with that toothsome member of the animalkingdom,
upon the most distant footing.
RELICS OF RASCALS.
We are too apt to be severe upon the vulgar of certain foreign nations
on account of their veneration for the relics of Saints, and Martyrs.
Instances of a uliar kind of relic worship are abundant enough in
this country. For example, we read in the Old Bailey news of last
week, that at the conclusion of a case, subsequently to the conviction of
the fool HAMILTON,
“A certain person named O'KEEFE, who, it appeared, was the owner of the pistol that
had been discharged by HAMILTON at HER MAJEsty, applied to the Court to order the
weapon to be restored to him, as he said he had been offered 40l. for it, and he should
not like to lose so much money.”
MR. Rush's blunderbuss, no doubt, would command as good a
º in the British market, and inches of the rope by which he, or
R. THURTELL, or MR. GREENACRE, became lost to Society, would be
quoted at no less extravagant figures. A bit of Courvoisi ER's drop
would probably fetch more than St. KATHERINE’s own wheel, or one
of the veritable arrows that shot St. SEBAstiAN. . We are no bigots,
but we unequivocally condemn this idolatry of the Martyrs of Crime
and Saints of the Newgate Calendar; and though averse to persecution,
we should really be glad to see a statute, somewhat milder than that de
Mºretico comâurendo, enacted against a traffic in the memorials of guilt,
which, in effect, puts a premium on all manner of atrocities.
Douceur.
AN Annuity of £50 will be settled upon any lady who will be kind enough
to procure for the Advertiser a PARTNER for LnPE, who shall be young, amiable,
pretty, and possessed of independent property (not in Ireland) to the amount of (say,
decidedly not less than) fö00 a year. The Advertiser is of family, does not smoke,
stands, five feet eleven, and, upon reference to his .."#. and a portrait by
Chalon, now both before him, is very far from ill-looking. Testimonials of early hours
and general good conduct can be had from his present landlady. Whiskers black.
Inviolable secrecy observed. All Tenders to be sent sealed, to CHARLEs NUGENT,
Esquire, at the pastry-cook's, Piccadilly. The Douceur will be paid directly after the
interesting Ceremony.
HER MAJESTY'S RATS.
On the third reading of the Jews' Bill (the Member for Bucks, by the
way, still, suffered his jew's harp to hang upon the willows), Wii. p.
Wood talked very irreverently ºt. style of declaration required of
every person, noble and menial, who took office. For instance, HER
MAJESTY's rat-catcher—said the Honourable Member—had to declare:
“I will not use my office of HER Mauesty's rat-killer to subvert the Established
Church as by law established.”
At this, there was from the unthinking Commons, “much laughter.”
Now, we contend—and sure we are that we shall have Messrs. PLUMP-
TRE, Newdegate, and other porphyry pillars of the Church with us, -
that such a solemn declaration is especially needed on the part of a
state rat-catcher... For, are there not rats that are essential to the
º and well-doing of the Established Church? Rats, that grow
at and sleek, to the impoverishment of the poor church mice? Rats,
with paws dipped in the ſat of the land-rats, with whiskers purple
with wine? Rats, a hundred times more potent than the immortal
yermin of Hamelin, sung by the magnificent singer, Robert BRowNING
(who will not, itingaleike, always sing in the shade, and—
“They fought the dogs and killed the cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
Andate the cheeses out of the vats,
And ticked the soup from the cook's own ladies;
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
And even spoiled the women's chats,
By drowning their speaking
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.”
Rats, that—in the opinions of wise men—are to the Church the
rotecting grace and strength, fed as they are upon the pluralities of
bacºn, and cheese, and butter. Consider the many sorted rats abounding
in the Establishment,
“Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown-rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,
Families by tens of dozens.”
And reflection the consequence, if HER MAJESTY's rat-catcher, ap-
pointed to rid the state of certain objectionable individuals, should wii-
fully orignorantly, by ferret, bane, or trap, destroy those rats that, from
the time of the white-handed fuki, or $º. even to our day,
(though, it must be owned, the creatures have lost their political odour,
the musk that recommended them to worshipful society), are held, by
certain churchmen and statesmen, as essential to the dignity of
Established Truth.
For many generations, rats have been almost sacred animals to the
English politician; the real internal supporters of the state, though the
ion and unicorn ;". the outside ceremony. In their day, rats
have been held in high esteem at St. James's, as cats at Memphis. The
creed is now somewhat outworn; nevertheless, we are certain
that MR. PLUMPTRE will agree with us, that it is most fitting the
QUEEN's rat-catcher should piously declare that, by the exercise of his
craft, he has no intention “to subvert the Established Church, as by
law established.”
POPULAR OSTEOLOGY.
THERE is no end to the variety of claims put forward to win the
approbation of the public, but we have nevertheless been struck by the
novelty of an advertisement which is continually being issued by an
individual, who delights in the appellation of the
OLD ORIGINAL BONES.
Our earliest information, picked up in our juvenile days when we used
to run and read the current literature of t has long
rag shops ago
taught us that the market price of old bones averages five pounds for
two pence, so that, unless there has been such a rise in bones as would
alarm even a medical student in search of a “subject,” we do not see
what particular worth can attach to the “Old Bones,” which are daily
announcing themselves as “original.” We wish PROFEssoR Owen,
or son,e other great scientific bone-grubber, would enlighten us as to the
special attraction of these Old Banes, which assume the airs of a regular
NAPARTE in the annals of ossification, and rear their Ossa so far
beyond Pelion as to reach almost to Olympus itself.
A NEW LEAF TO BE TURNED OVER.
AMong the hundred new periodicals—some of which prove their
title to period-ical by coming shortly to a full stop-is a publication
called the Journal of Design...We beg to suggest to the Editor of the
Journal of Design, the weekly insertion of a Chapter of Accidents,
which we are sure would be an interesting feature.

PLEASURES OF
HOUSEKEEPING.
THE roar of guns my hearing stuns—hark! to the serried ranks,
Clashes the steel 'gainst spur-armed heel, the ordered musquet clanks;
And far and near I seem to hear the thunder of the plain,
As field-guns gallop to the front, to pour their iron rain.
No rest for me as fev’rishly I turn upon my pillow,
Such sounds of war blend with the roar of England's circling billow :
Down from the North comes pouring forth the pent-up Russian
flood;
The thirsty South doth slake its drouth in French and Roman blood.
Left hand’gainstright the Germans fight, from Jutland's farthest horn,
To where Vienna sulks, of mirth, money, and music shorn;
Sad slave of chance, fermenting France from Seine to sunny Loire,
Stakes limb and life in desperate strife—a nation's Rouge et Noir.
Of all the earth on England's hearth alone may peace be found;
Tongues, bloods, or sects, she none rejects that seek her neutral
ground:
But even that hush, amidst the rush and roar that fill the air,
But makes more clear to mind and ear the agony elsewhere.
My eye-lids closed I sat and dozed—no marvel 'tis I state;
If HomeR doze, sure Punch may snooze—'bove all o'er a debate.
'Twas CoBDEN spoke—and not in joke—how every public tiff,
Without a fight might be set right—I dropped off–sighing—“If–"
PUNCH's DREAM OF PEACE.
Then unconfined forth sped my mind, and as from some great hill,
O'erlooked the fight of Wrong and Right, the war of Good and Ill :
'Twas hard to find through tumult blind which power which battle led,
Each now for king—now people—now white y-clad—now red.
But as I marked the conflict dark, these powers and these alone,
Surely though slow to one did grow, each gathering its own:
And ever as the strife fared on, more strength the Good did gain,
While to a poorer weakness the Evil still did wane.
For o'er the storm a radiant form, on solemn wings of snow,
Pointing with beamy finger, the way of Good did show;
And still that glorious guidance more followed, and more,
And as the bright shape floated on Dark Evil cowered before.
Hate I saw change to greelings strange; hard hands flung down the
sword,
To grasp in friendly pressure—peer—peasant—serſ—and lord:
Red caps were doffed, red brands were quenched, nations their griefs
forswore,
As brotherhood its ample fruits of liberal blessing bore.
With eager cry I strove to fly where high above the war
And its hushed storm that radiant form was brooding like a star; "
Istretched—I spoke . . . and sudden woke, all cold, and sore, and stiff-
And on my lips still hung half formed the word Islept on—“If–"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL 255
STATE OF LONDON.
(Translated from a French Paper.)
* EICESTER SquaRE, Thursday.—MATTERs are fast drawing to
V a head here. If anything, the aspect of affairs is more
threatening. Yesterday the authorities being informed
of an intended rising in the Rue de Fleet, the most extra-
ordinary precautions were taken to prepare for, and to
crush it. No less than three patrols of Gendarmes,
numbering at least half a dozen men in each, perambulated the Place
de Trafalgar and the Pont Waterlieu. The “Beadles” of the “Arcade
Burlington?” and the “Colonnade d’Opera” were supplied with sand-
wiches to, last twenty-four hours. F. splendid corps of “Street
Orderlies” were furnished with new brooms, and lay under arms all
night, ready, at a moment’s notice, to sweep the streets. Several serious
émeutes took place. The first was a desperate engagement between
two gamins about a pegge-toppe. - -
In this, réconnaissance, according to the Potte du Matin, one
received a bloody nose, but this fact is disbelieved in the best informed
circles., I, applied at the Bureau d’Home Office upon the subject, but
could obtain no accurate information. Many of the shops in the Rue
. were illuminated in the evening. The re-actionists would have
us believe that this was merely for the purpose of lighting their rooms
and selling their wares. Small groups were seen round the sentries at
the gates of the Gardes de Horse, in their mairie at “Whitehall,” but
although many suspicious-looking, nursery-maids lingered about the
place, no further attempt appears to have been made to dismount the
Sentries.
In justice to these noble fellows, I must add that they endured the
continued of the lace admirable sung froid, although one
of them º. Fºr been detected in º; at a #:
democrat. AI, Bhaaraway is charged by the Government to
institute a searching inquiry into this ious affair.
I may mention that there is no truth, in the report that SERJEANT
Madon Bushy (lately elected deputy for the department of Lower
Pimliceau) intends to impeach Ministers.
. The clubs were, as usual, frequented throughout the day by many
idle loungers—all ns not members were rigidly excluded.
Matters :*:::::: serious aspect, about midnight. Bands of
young men—many of them dressed & la geº. marched in threes
and fours along iſe streets, surrounding the Cellare Cidère and, the
Palace d’Evans, chanting seditious songs, especially that beginning “Ne
go home till morning.”
Severaſ of the Conducteurs d’Omnibus were heard to call out loudly
during the day, “Bank! Bank! City | Bank!” a sure corroboration of
my.information, that an attack on these places has been organised.
The QUEEN is still most popular, but the Post-office authorities report
that the Number of Queen's-heads (many of a blood-red colour) affixed
to the letters is as great as ever.
A mutiny in the fleet will no doubt be hastened by the late order of
the Ministre de Marine prohibiting sailors from wearing top boots when
at sea. I myself heard the fifteenth mate of the war-steamer Citizen Z,
grossly insulted and covered with opprobrious epithets by two of the
class denominated bargées (they wore red worsted nightcaps).
It is too true that London is on the eve of an insurrection. The first
i. of disturbance . peaceful repose of Europe will be
the signal for a bloody massacre here.
All ſoreign news is completely excluded by the Government. The
condition of Central Europe is known only from fragments of news-
papers smuggled in German sausages. The interest felt in Italian affairs
continues unabated, and the number of Roman candles used at Vauxaul
is immense. - - -
The foregoing facts are sufficient to show that a crisis is at hand,
especially if we keep in mind that Ragged Schools are being established
everywhere, several model Lodging Houses erected, and the Baths
for Democrats thronged daily; that new Hospitals are building, and
Churches endowed, and that every week witnesses a loud demand for
Sanitary Reform.
I have hurried to close my dispatch, I am compelled to .
Latest Intelligence. By Electric Telegraph. “M. SMITH is pronounced
out of danger.’ -
M. CRIsrº has notified his ability to remove timid persons to secure
quarters. Many have in consequence gone to Paris.

The Man who forgets Himself.
THE RARL or ELLENBorough, Chairman at the Eton Festival, is
stated by the Times, in proposing the Duke or WELLINgron's health,
to have described his Grace as “a man who, under all circumstances,
and in all times, had exhibited the most absolute forgetfulness of self.”
We beg the EARL or ELLENHonough's pardon. There is a noble and
learned Lord who is much more remarkable for forgetting himself than
the DUKE of WELLINGTON.
MORTALITY AMONG THE STEAM TUGS.
We have seen with considerable pain the announcement of a great
number of fatalities among the Steam Tugs, which ap to have been
suffering lately from an epidemic that may fairly be called an attack of
the bile-Tor, more technically, speaking, a “bursting of the biler.”
Happily, the tugs have not involved a sacrifice of human life with the
loss of their own existences; but we nevertheless cannot see without
sorrow the frequent loss of those tugs, which, in the event of there
being occasion for the “tug of war,” would take a conspicuous position
in the British navy. It has often struck us as an alarming symptom
about these tugs, that they are afflicted with a sort of cough, accom.
panied by a hoarseness of the funnel, which has tempted us at times to
throw an ounce or two of Spanish liquorice down the tube, with the
view of relieving the almost bursting vessel from its agonies.
. The loss of a tug, called the St. Michael, has been given by the Times
in a style so full of pathetic incident that we could not have proceeded
had we not opened the safety valve of our sighs to give a vent to our
sentiment. It appears that the captain of the poor old tug, perceiving
that she was in a sinking state, determined to stick to her ãf the last;
and as she †. into a muddy grave, he clung fondly to her taffrail,
and only quitted her when the hostile fluid had immersed the top of her
E. : The attention of the owner to the remains of the ill-fated
oat was touching in the highest degree, and he made an affectionate
attempt to recover the poor old tug, but he ultimately succeeded in
recovering only the funnel. She has since been raised to the surface
but whether she will ever be able to resume her station in -
society is a mystery, not yet solved, though several hands have been
employed to try and pump it out of her.
OUR MILITARY ANNALS.
WE have been favoured by MR. Type R, of the Surrey Zoological
Gardens, with the following bulletin of the Siege of Badajos.-
ºn-o- Chinese Duck, and two Goslings who have since died
of fright.
WounBED-A black Swan, whose left wing was severely º by
the sustained fire of a Roman Candle. Ensign W1GGINs.-His right
whisker was completely burnt away, during the awful explosion of the
mine. PRIVATE BRown.—His coat-tails were completely severed from
his body at the first opening of the breach.
Missing.—The Fur Cap of carpenter Jon Es; it fell into the water at
the last display of blue-fire, and has not since been recovered. The
Crab-stick of MR. Danson, which he gallantly used as a sword in
leading the forlorn hope that stormed the heights of Badajos.
The amount of property destroyed is not so great as might be
imagined. It is confined to two panes of glass in the animals' cage,
which have been irrevocably destroyed, and the apple-stall of a woman
outside the Gardens which was upset by a falling shower of rocket-sticks.
F. M. the Duke of WELLINGtoN has escaped without any injury,
further than a slight indenture on the bridge º his nose.
THE PRINCE GREAT BY DEGREES.
WHEN so many other Princes are going down, it is gratifying to see
our own Prince going up, which he certainly is, at any rate in our estima-
tion. How much more pleasant now it is to be able to praise his Royal
Highness every week than to make ever such good jokes at his expense;
to pat the princely back rather than to poke the illustrious ribsł
PRINCE ALBERT's last good action—at the time at which we write—
was to preside and make a capital speech at the distribution of prizes—
among them two medals contributed by himself—of the Society of Arts.
He also displayed such a practical acquaintance with the Arts which he
patronizes, that Punch, not only approves of his having been created
; A. by Cambridge, but has also much pleasure in admitting him
Bears' Grease without Bloodshed.
Mr. Punch having been informed by advertisement that a large Bear
would be slaughtered on the premises of a certain Dresser and
Perfumer, procured himself, by application in the proper quarter, the
privilege of witnessing the ess. Those who may go to behold a
similar spectacle in the brutal hope of revelling in the throes of an unſor-
tunate quadruped, will be disappointed. The operation of slaughtering
a Bear is unattended with the slightest.* to the animal; for it
consists simply in-opening a bladder of lard.
Those who, Run May READ,
THE present French Administration is so anxious to proclaim its own
folly º bad faith, that it writes them up in Roman CAPITAL Characters.

PERFECT SINCERITY,
OR THINKINGS ALOUD.
Erquisite (to the Mamma of Performer). “WHAT A PITY THAT GURL's FRIENDs DoN'T TAKE HER Away
NOT BAD LookING, BUT she HAs Got A Voice LIKE A PEAcock!!!”
No. 6.
FROM THAT PLANo. SHE's
If we were to tell JoHN BULL that he is a very shabby, dog, the
British Lion would no doubt give an angry growl, and an indignant
switch of his tail, at the ignoble imputation.
We are compelled, nevertheless, to declare that John BULL is in
some respects an exceedingly paltry fellow, notwithstanding the old
stage clap-traps, about the “beautiful benevolence and Tbountiful
.# of the born Briton.” We judge º accurately of a man's
good heartedness, by the manner in which he behaves to his servants,
and the rate of wages he gives to them; for whatever truth there may
be in the old saying “Base is the slave that pays,” there is something
still baser in the conduct of the slave who pays paltrily.
. Now we are great friends to economy, but we like it to be of the
right sort; and we have a thorough contempt for that kind of economy
which developes itself in pinching the men who really do the public
work, and leaving unscathed those whose chief, occupation is, the
drawing of their salaries. We venture to say there is scarcely a
working official in the whole of John BULL's employ, who is not
worse paid than he would be for the performance of the same duties in
any liberally conducted private establishment. John BULL has been
hitherto the worst of paymasters, and the best of victims, parting
dgingly with money fairly earned, and bleeding freely for the
nefit of sinecurists, compensation seekers, and pensioners. He has
lately been under better treatment for the pecuniary harmorrhage;
but, the tightness of the chest towards those for whom his bosom
Qught to expand with generosity, is a malady which he still suffers
rom.
The Post Office Clerks can vouch for this fact, which comes home to
them with painful reality. Our sympathy with them as men of letters,
is perhaps more active than with some other classes of public servants,
whose treatment is no less shabby than that of the Martyrs of St.
Plu NCH ALWAYS AT HIS POST.
Martin's-le-Grand, where the groans of the under-paid and over-worked
Clerks rise in dismal chorus over the dome of St.Paul's, to descend with
the force of their intense gravity on the floor of our office, in Fleet
Street. Many of these heart-rending lamentations have reached us in
the more substantial form of notes of exclamation, or letters, crying out
against the hardships to which the Post Office Clerks are exposed; and we
have had, in particular, a perfect volley of sighs from the Dead Letter
Office,embodying complaints which, but for our aid, might have remained
as thoroughly dead letters, as the defunct correspondence the parties are
employed in dealing with. Even the paltry pittance received in the
shape of salary is, it seems, mulcted of a large per-centage for a super-
annuation fund, which, instead of being set aside for superannuation,
goes back into the purse of JoHN º thus inflicts upon his ill-
paid servants a sharp pinch with one hand, while, he virtually picks
their pockets with the other. This superannuation stoppage is, a
fearful infliction upon those poor victims whose health is delicate, who
are not likely to live to receive the fruits of the superannuation, and
who by being obliged to contribute to it, are prevented from making,
by life-insurance, a provision for their families.
We earnestly entreat those who have so much liberality on their lips,
to keep a little in their hearts, for the good of those who really do the
work of the country, and who are always the very first to suffer when a
º for economy is raised, without any attempt being made by those
who raise it, to see that it is not answered at the sacrifice of justice and
of other still higher qualities. They who pay badly are usually badl
served, and the wonder is, how the Post Office business can be so we
and so honestly performed by men who are so meanly and unfairly dealt
with, and, unless a better system is pursued, we can hardly expect to
#. either the general, the district, or the local post, the post of
Onour.

PEACE AND WAR IN PARLIAMENT.
“INTERNATIONAL arbitration is very well,” says Jones, “but really,
MR. CoBDEN, this is not the time—with the Continent in volcanic
eruption—this is nºt the time to press it.” - - -
“A fire-engine,” says ToMKINs, “is, an admirable invention; an
excellent sort of thing indeed, but with that sugar-bakehouse in a con-
flagration, you’d never think of bringing the engine out.” Surely
ToMKINs has herein as much reason on his side as Jon Es.
..MR. BoBRER, in his book on the Kabyle, War, gave, among other
pictures, one in blood and fire, of a household massacred. Young girls
outraged, then murdered—an old man with his throat cut—an infant
bayonetted—and, indeed, the whole burning household, as the devils
in uniform pleasantly expressed it, prettily cleaned out—yes, joliment
“.
e apprehend that the spectator of such demons' work, such
blasphemy legalised by war, would, from the very contemplation of the
outrage, feel a stronger yearning towards peace. Brought face to face
with horror, he would surely be more prone to denounce murder upon
system, to the flutter of flags and the piping of music,+than if merely
contemplating the ſº. of future homicide.
Therefore, should the voice of peace uttered by England be greeted as
more musical, more hopeful, because rising above the roar of continental
artillery. With three parts of Europe drunk with blood—with hundreds
of thousands of men arrayed for mutual murder, is it nothing that
England should denounce the unrighteous, brutalising struggle, as a
blasphemous mockery of that Christianity, to which we indeed rear
thousands of temples, and in the name of which we retain a bench of
bishops and a crowd of priests, but which we violate with every
aggressive gun that is fired, with every sword that is drawn? The
cannon ever roars alie to the church .
When armies are fighting, it is folly to talk of peace, say gunpowder
ºne; When men are ſamishing, it is not the time to give them
them. Such is the equal reasoning. -
MR. Coppen was very wrong ºins in his Arbitration Motion with
the whole Continent rocking with artillery. He ought to have waited
for days of quiet—of Arcadian peace. And then—yes, and then—some
smug dialectician would have wondered at the busy-body interference
of the Honourable Member for the West Riding, “Was not all the
world quiet P Did not the golden age brood upon the earth? Why
such unnecessary prattling about peace, when morational being enter-
tained a thought cº war?” Either way the question was sure to be
held absurd—inopportune.
CAPTAIN HARRIs, an officer who evidently sees deeper into a cannon
ball than short-sighted civilians, detected in MR. CoBDEN's, motion,
nothing more than an attempt to bring about a republic! Thus
monarchy depends upon war: the unicorn as well as the lion is a
carnivorous beast, and feeds on the carcases of animals; if such be the
case, surely English monarchs ought not to be crowned in Westminster
Abbey, but in Woolwich Arsenal.
We once met with a profound moralist and philosopher—a manywho
saw into the very “pulse of the machine” of political and social life,
who declared it to be his unalterable opinion, that all the evils suffered in
our present hard condition of society, originated solely with the invention
of ADELAIDE boots. We know not how he supported his theory; but
we think it equally tenable with the republic of CAptain HARRIs.
Happily, however, war is no longer a royal question. The people (we
speak especially of Englishmen) have, with other matters, made war a
concern of their own. Ultima ratio regum. / The “last reasoning of
kings,” is the wise legend to be found on certain pieces of artillery.
Mixed folly and falsehood! Homicide was not the last, but generally
the first reasoning of kings. And what a fine satire in the phrase.
Reasoning-royal reasoning—in slaughter! Then wolves reason, and |b
tigers deliberate. But we now interpret Ultima, ratio regum with a
º: : not the Last Reasoning of Kings, but the First Sufferings
Ol Peoples.
There was, we feel assured, great disappointment at the mode in
which MR. CoBDEN shaped his motion. He did not appear on, the
floor of the House to the eye of philosophic and imaginative members|d
as an inhabitant of Utopia or Atlantis. Neither did his lunacy manifest
itself of that harmless kind that finds a solace and employment in the
manufacture of straw hat and boots. He did not—to the great relief
of the more pious and more religious members—preach the perfectability
of man; a theory that ever awakens the indignation of some of your
most excellent people, who seem never so satisfied with the condition
of humanity, as when assured of its incurable ignorance and sinfulness.
MR. Qobbºn took a business-like view of the question, and by the
practicability of his notions obtained the expressed goodwill—could
more be expected P-of the Prime Minister, and the Foreign Secretary.
For ourselves, we entirely accord with the position of MR. Cobden;
and have a most cheerful faith, in the ultimate prosperity of his doc.
trines; for they are mingling themselves with the best thoughts of the
eople, who are every day more and more assured, that whatever may
É. the cause of war, they are the first sacrificed for it; it is they who
y the cost. Just as the sheep is stripped of its skin for the noisy
rbarous drum to beat the lie of glory—so are the people stripped to
pay for the music. -
he romance of one era is the reality of the next. The Arbitra-
tion Question has taken root, and will grow and spread. They show a
cedar in the Gardens at Paris—a cedar of hugest girth, and widest
shade—that, some century ago, was brought from Lebanon in the cap of
a traveller. - - -
The olive § planted by MR. Cobden in Westminster, will flourish
despite the blighting wit of mess-rooms, and rise and spread into a tree
that shall offer shade and security to all nations.
A WEST-END WILDERNESS.

physician. When men are naked, it is preposterous to think to clothe|
NATURE is in a most savage state—and well she may be—in the
enclosure of Leicester Square, for civilisation has completely abandoned
the spot, which is now the haunt, of the cat, who frequently makes a
midnight descent upon the affrighted members of the adjoining cab-
stand. The local waterman, in order to keep off the feline race at night,
is compelled to preserve a pipe for ever ignited in his mouth, by way of
a substitute for the “light in his laughing eye,” which protects him in
the day time from the aggression of the tiger-like race, so long the sole
tenants of the Leicester Square enclosure.
Surely, this spot of territory belongs to somebody, and if the owner
is an absentee, we entreat Parliament toaft. an act for the purpose of
bringing the land into cultivation; or at all events, if we must not lay it
under the harrow or the plough, let us at least lay it under the birch
broom, the hand-hoe, the roller and the gardener.
The anarchy prevailing in that square demands the prompt establish-
ment of some sort of government, and we should be content with a
beadledom, pur et simple, if we can get nothing better...We would have
the place ruled with a rod of iron, and a rod of birch, in the shape of a

Monday, June 18, 1849. AFTER a Dinner off Bubble and Squeak,
my Wife and I to my LoRD WILKINsoN's at Home, by Invitation;
though Heaven knows if ever I set Eyes on his Lordship in my Life,
or he on me; but do ascribe this Honour to having my Name put
down in the Court Guide, and am glad to find the Consequence and
Importance I have got thereby. I in my new Suit of Black and Silk
Neckerchief, with a Fringe at the Ends, and my Wife did wear her
Lace Dress over her pink Satin Slip, which was very handsome. Gave
our Card to a Lackey in yellow and crimson Livery, with a huge
Shoulderknot, who did shout out our Name, which, passing along a
Row of his fellows lining the Stairs, was by the Time it reached the
Drawing-Room changed to PIPPINs—but no matter; for before I
could set it right, we were presented to my Lord and my Lady, who
rofessed themselves delighted to see us. So on with the Stream in the
rowd; for my Lord's Drawing Room as thronged as the Opera Pit En-
trance on a Thursday Night. ethought surely there was Something
worth seeing and hearing; but saw Nothing extraordinary beyond the
Multitude of Company, and divers Writers, Painters, and other Persons
of Note, elbowing their Way through the Press; nor heard anything
but Puffing and Gasping, and complaining of the terrible Heat. Severa
Ladies fainting; and my Wife declaring she feared she should faint
too, which made me mad; for it is always the Way with Women at

them. At some Distance before us, a Bustle and Stir, and in the
midst of it a Lackey with a Tray, whereon were Ices—the People
struggling for them; and I also strove to get one for my Wife, and
his Diary.

by the Current to the other side of the Room; and in the mean Time
all the Ice must have melted; for so were we very nearly. Some young
Beauties there, whom to have looked upon at my Ease, and they at theirs,
would, have been a great Delight; but, they in such Discomfort,
that it quite spoilt their Prettiness, which was pitiful. We met
DR. DAbbes the great Chemist, with whom, some pretty Discourse
concerning the Air of crowded Rooms, which he said do contain a Gas
called Carbonic Acid, and is poisonous, and we were now breathing so
much per Cent, of it, which did trouble me. To think, what Delight
fashionable Folks can take in crowding together, to the Danger of
Health; a Set of People, for the most Part, Strangers both to them and
to one another! Away early; for we could endure the Stifling no longer:
and good Lack, what a Relief to get into the open Air y white Kid

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI 259
STATE OF THE HOP GARDENS.
|
|
FoRTUNATELY, modern science has enabled brewers to make beer
without hops. Therefore, it matters little, that every season there are
no hops at all. Intelligence from every hop-growing district proves
| that the hop pockets of 1849 will, as usual, contain nothing. One of
our Kentish correspondents speaks of the fly being so ravenous during
the present season, that it has not only carried away the plant, but
consumed the poles. In every other garden the bine is nowhere; and
-agan we say it—there is every reason to congratulate a beer-drinking
public upon the intelligence of the modern brewer who can make seas
of porter without, any hops at all. Thus the plant, it would appear,
was only cultivated upon the most benevolent principles; namely, to
supply to the hop-fly, and the thousand other insects (some with very
unseemly names) that live upon the vegetable, their seasonable
provender. There is, however, one species of fly, the Wastator Ercisor,
that—however little may be left of the hops—always makes the most of
that little. This insect swarms from London, and is to be seen very
busy in the hop-gardens at a certain period. It is of an enormous size,
and its ravages upon the plant are never less than at the value of
eighteen shillings and eightpence the cwt. of hops.
We are obliged to a hop-growing correspondent of Farnham for the
subjoined drawing of the insect; and when we assure our readers that
it is reduced about two thousand times from its original size, why, some
feeble notion may be entertained of the power of the insect when work-
ing its wicked will in the hop-gardens of merry England. It will be
perceived that the insect is ". human in its structure. It secretes a
sort of black fluid (very like ink) in a vitreous sac (very like a bottle).
With this it trails certain marks upon the hop plant that, do what the
grower may to help himself, inevitably reduce the value of the hop to
the º who again lays the loss upon the consumer, to the amount
of 18s. 8d. per cwt. We know of no means of clearing the grounds
from the devastating visits of this Excise Fly—this Wastator Ercisor.
Will * CoBDEN-who last year alluded to the pest—help the hop-
grower
Bugeaud's Funeral.
THE Marshal's funeral has been performed with great splendour.
Various of the dead soldier's trophies were exhibited; among others,
the umbrella of ABD-EL-KADER, with several nick-macks taken in battle
in Algeria. . There was, however, one trophy that has been strangely
overlooked by all the reporters of the ceremony. It was a large urn—
large as the oil-jars that held the forty thieves-filled with ashes that
were once the living flesh of men, women, and children, gloriously
burned aliye in the caves of Dahra, under the paternal auspices of PERE
BUGEAUD! And now, the man of glory mingles with glory's victims.
“Ashes to ashes!”
A CoRRESPONDENT, whose imagination seems to be rather impressed
with the magnificence of the conception of tube bridges, thinks that
MR. STEPHENson must henceforth be regarded as the greatest of
engineers, as, whatever difficulties others may have had to encounter,
no one ever passed over so Menai Straits.
THE “TRUE BLUES” DILEMMA; or, THE POPE OR
THE REPUBLIC 2
How completely at sea, how confounded are we
By the Romans’ affairs and invasion'
Quite put out of our way, we can’t think what to say,
Wºlf our Politics 'gainst our Persuasion.
Here’s the Papacy down, and the Pope’s triple crown
Is the football of Rome's population, .
Which you’d think, in True Blue theological view,
Would be matter of high exultation.
Then, with bay'nets and bombs, GENERAL OUDINot comes,
To restore the dominion of Scarlet;
And of course you’d suppose, we should rail through the nose
At the wicked Papistical varlet.
But alas! we can’t crow o'er the Pope's overthrow,
And be joyful for Rome's revolution;
For, in place of his throme, we should then have to own
A Republic—abhorr'd institution
Neither can we advance, gainst the movement of France,
Half a word that on censure would border; .
For though Babylon's reign she goes forth to maintain,
We imagine her object is Order.
So we’re forced to be mum, like to dogs that are dumb,
And to give wicked wits an occasion
Us to and deride, thus remaining tongue-tied,
With our Politics 'gainst our Persuasion.
PALACE COURT COMPENSATION.
THE Palace Court is about to share the fate of the rack, the pillory,
and other of our old institutions. Nevertheless, though the Court be
abolished, the folks who lived by the Court are to be treated with
especial tenderness: they are to receive compensation for being deprived
of the privilege of grinding human bones to make their bread, buttered
inch-thick with costs. Whether the bill that tº: the lawyers
for the loss of the future will also compensate their victims for the
losses of the past, we have yet to gather. Be this as it may ; there is
a sweet benevolence, a large-heartedness, in this, compensation of
unprotected lawyers. We cannot, with the confidence we should
desire in such averment, assert that, when railways displaced coaches,
the highwaymen who were flung out of employment—whose privileges
were manifestly destroyed by the revolutionist steam-received com;
pensation; but judging from analogy in the case of the Six Clerks, and
the Palace Court Magi, we can feel but little doubt of the fact. The
gentlemen of the road laid out money on horse-flesh, pistols, and
ammunition—invested, as it were, their capital in highway practice,
and we must believe were remunerated by the same 'equitable spirit
that is now to compensate the Palace Court people, who have for so
many years made defenceless Englishmen stand and deliver. -
Nevertheless, we would not compensate the Palace Court judge and
attornies by Act of Parliament. No, we have to make a more munifi-
cent proposition; to suggest more grateful means of remuneration,
...? thereto by a passage in the life of John Stow, antiquarian;
who—under the patronage of that magnanimous lover of learning,
JAMES THE FIRST-was duly licensed in his old age to begin churches.
From one collection in one parish, the miserable old scholar absolutely
received seven and-sixpenceſ - -
Now, after this example, we propose that the judge and attornies of
the Palace Court be licensed by the QUEEN to sit in the door-way of
the Court of Queen's Bench, of the Pleas, and the Exchequer, to beg
compensation of the reflecting and charitable. A brief summary of
his condition, nicely engrossed on law parchment, may be pinned over
the wounded breast of every mendicant; and further, in tenderness, to
the feelings of the beggar, he may be allowed to wear a shade to his
eyes, and to receive the pennies, not in his own hand, but in a little
dish or saucer held in the mouth of a faithful dog. We are sure that
such unforced compensation would be sweeter to the feelings than any
sum voted by rigour of Act of Parliament.

THE LITTLE SCOTCH BOYS AND GIRLS WHO CAME
OUT TO PLAY.
To judge the Scotch from their Games, they must be the, most ath-
letic, mercurial, dancing, rollicking set in the world. Scotland must be a
nation of HERCULES', PERROTs, and Laughing
“Feeloosophers.” . Its national song should be,
“We are jolly good fellows!”
The Scotchman is always, represented on the
§: as a heavy, methodical, glum, stiff fellow,
with the agility of a Quaker, and the liveliness
of a shopman at a maison de deuil. ...Our dra-
matists must henceforth change their con-
ventional type, for your Scotchman, we have
agreeably discovered, can laugh, and skip, and
snap his fingers with your best frenchman, and
make as great a fool of himself, when good
humour demands it, as your best-humoured
hman.
e ourselves always thought that a Scotch.
man could not enjoy himself excepting as a strict
matter of business...We were astonished to find
that he could º with all the delight of a school-
boy, for LoRi, Hollanp's Park last week was
more like an immense playground than anything
else. ...We sober, money-marked, Englishmen
were the masters, and the Highlanders were the
little boys, who had come out to have a good º:
romp. They were at it from ºf to night.
They entered so heartily into the fun of the
thing, that the QUEEN, and the Prince, and the
Duke came to see them. They ran like children
scrambling for pence. They played at single
stick, and hit one another over the toes and
shoulders with immense glee.
There were, also, several games of broad-
sword, and they struck so fiercely at each other
that we expected, every minute to see a he
flying like a ball through the air, or to find in
qur arms, an odd leg, with a Scotch garter
dangling to it; but they must have been as
good-tempered as their blades, for the more the
were hit, the better they seemed pleased. If $
anybody's head had been lost, we are sure it
would have been picked up on the broad grin. -
We must say, the Tweed has been vilely
libelled. It has º been put down as a slow :
river, half snow, half mud... We must explore :
it, for we are positive that the Scotch side of it,
at least, runs with quicksilver, made all the #
quicker by an under-current of cold whiskey
and water. -
The two days' games were, most amusing.
The weather did its best. The ladies wore their
prettiest, bonnets—the Park, in honour of the
archers, had put on its best suit of Lincoln-green
—there was no dust, not a single accident, and
every kind of refreshment, from curds and whey
down to champagne. -
The whole thing would have been perfect, if a
there had not been so many bagpipes. We
must say, we do not admire that national music.
We wish Scotland would adopt the hurdy-gurdy.
It is more musical, and much more lively. Fº
We hope this réunion matinale of Kilmac,

MISS BENIMBLE TO PUNCH.
DEAR MR. Punch,-Much afeard that.i. have wondered at my
silence, and said in your own caustic way bitter things about the º;
tude of woman. But the fact is, there is a cause—a sweet cause—if I
may be allowed the expression, for my late and future silence in print.
ou will excuse further explanation, and ſhope oblige an old contributºr
(as I shall ever be proud to call myself by putting the following little
notice (with any compliment you think deserving) in your family paper.
“Married, at St. Barnaby's, Pimlico, by the Reverend Ignatius Bottlenose, Mr. LovE-
Lace (grandson of CoRrom AL LovELAck, who took a drum at the storming of Badajoz,
see NAPIER's Peninsular), to MATILDA BENIMPLE, only daughter of the late Roger
BENIMBLE, Esq., Crumpet-maker to his revered Majesty Großge THE THIRD."
You see, Mr. Punch, j about to become a wife—for the fluttering
ceremony will have taken place afore this appears—I have retired from
lº. to give all my time to my husband; it costs me a struggle,
ut it’s done. Politics, I confess it even now, have a charm; but
there’s a sterner duty in shirt buttons.
Yours, (for I shall be, by the time you’re out),
MATILDA LovELACE, late BENIMBLE.
. P. S. On seeing the above in your columns, I shall forward you a
piece of cake.
PLAIN QUESTIONS AND CROOKED ANSWERS.
THE difficulty of hearing in the House of Lords is frequently the
cause of a cross-game being Fº of Question and Answer. The
following, report of an unreported debate may give a happy notion of
the mistakes that are constantly .."; : -
LoRD BROUGHAM begged to know whether anything had been done
with Sardinia? - - -
The MARQUIs of LANDSDown E M.H. in being obliged to remind
the Honourable Lord, that the duty had long ago been taken off Ines.
The EARL of ELLENBoRough said, that that had nothing to do with
the original question; and he would ask, seeing the venerable, Duke in
his place, if any measures had been taken at the Horse Guards to pro-
vide against the growing scarcity of bears.
The EARL or GALLoway would answer that question, and confidently
state that the conduct of the reporters in that matter was most
diº He should divide the House upon it.
of D REDESDALE was anxious to know if a Railway Bill would be
brought in this session for the better º of Navigators P
LQRIA STANLEY would take upon himself to answer that inquiry, and
would, boldly state, if the provisions of that atrocious bill were passed,
that the seas of the world would soon be swept of every #:
navigator. (Hear, hear.) -
Wickºw wanted to be Homed what would become
of the marble arch at Buckingham Palace
The EARL of
The MARQUEss of CIANRicarpE admitted that the evil ought to be
stopped, or else we might ºxpect to, see it running all over the king:
dom. He would ask the Honourable Lord opposite if any steps had
been taken about the quarantine * , -
The EARL or MINTó, upon being thus appealed to, could not help
thanking the noble Lord for the great courtesy he had displayed in
putting his question.
LoRD BRQUGHAM would like to know if any instructions had been
sent to the British Ambassador at Stockholm to protest against the
marriage of JENNY LIND with any but a British subject?
The EARL or MINTo admitted a great wrong had º: done, but he
doubted strongly if it constituted a statutable offence. However, the
public must be protected; and notice had already been given, that upon
a repetition of the offence, the British Government would not shrink
from doing its duty. (Loud applause.)
LoRD BROUGHAM would ask another question, and then he would be
satisfied... He felt a great interest in, knowing whether it were true
that the Trustees of the National Gallery had refused a most liberal
offer from a Gas Company to light up the Vernon Gallery, free of ex-
nse, providing they might have the pictures that had been already
maged or º: and, again, whether it was true that the Roman
Triumvirs had sold the APOLLO BELVIDERE to MADAME TUssaud for
the º of £5 P
The QUEss of LANspowNE admitted the great importance of the
subject, but must decline answering it till to-morrow, as he had not
the requisite papers with him to refer to. In the meantime he could
assure the House that not a single Roman candle had been sent from
}ººl to the relief of the Triumvirate. (Cheers from all parts of the
oxse.

NOMENCLATURE FOR THE STEAM NAVY.
*IR CHARLEs NAPIER's exposure of the
Ns , state of the steam navy induces us to
*. offer a little advice to the Lords of the
Admiralty. We would recommend their
Lordships to learn music, for hitherto
it seems that, in constructing steamers
they have had their ship-builders an
engine-makers working wholly out of
concert, and an instructive º
would be suggested to them by the
- § attempt to execute a duet in the same
sº independent manner. Considering, also,
, - that the majority of those vessels have
- boilers unprotected from the enemy's
shot, and main-deck º too low for their guns, and are, in divers
other respects, marvels of uselessness and inefficiency; we also counsel
the Lords of the Admiralty to make a suitable alteration in their
nomenclature. - -
For instance, there is the Retribution, with her main-deck unarmed,
utterly iº; of any retributory act; let her name accordingly be
changed to the Tolerance. For other similarly constituted bulwarks of
our tight.little island, we would, propose, as fitting and characteristic,
the appellations of the Mull, the Hash, the Mistake, the Mess, the
Bungle, the Awkward, and the Clumsy. We find a steam frigate called
the Terrible, that has no room for troops or stores, and we must
protest * the application to her of an epithet which can describe
nothing but, the state she is in. What she and her like should be
called by right, is, the Inqffensive, the Innocent, or the Harmless.
TO A ROEBUCK AT BAY,
WHIGs in their cozy berths agree,
And 'tis a sorry sight
When independent men we see
Fall out and fume and fight.
Let BROUGHAM delight to bark and bite,
For CAMPBELL ryles him so;
Let Irish Members bounce and fight,
For ’tis their nature to.
But, Roebuck, you should never let
Your angry passions rise;
Your little hands were never meant
To tear out GRATTAN's eyes.
LADIES HAVE STRANGE NOTIONS.
LADIEs have certainly strange motions; they imagine an Editor is
all-powerful, that he can open everything, from one of CHUpp's Locks,
down to the doors of AIMAGK's. #. not a bad specimen
of their motions upon this subject:
“My DEAR SIR,-As the dear children are at home for the holidays,
could you oblige me with some orders to view the Royal Academy,
Toy and Bºssy, and little JUIHA and HARRY, being all, so extreme
fond of pictures. If you could make the order for eight, you woul
much oblige “Yours, very gratefully,
“MRs. (name suppressed).”
... Another lady has written to ask for an order to take her little family
(it is never less, than ten, exclusive of babies) over St. Paul's and
Westminster Abbey, and it was as much as we could do to assure her
that no press orders were admitted into those admirable places of
amusement. She, then wrote back to say, “she would be so much
obliged, if we could get her a private box for any might at the Philhar-
mºnic, as her eldest boy was learning the fiddle.”
This was not so comical, however, as an old lady from Manchester,
who asked us for a free admission for herself and daughter, and two
º to go to HER MAJESTY's next drawing-room. Šhe really
believed that there was a free list at St. James's Palace, and that
Editors' orders were received precisely the same as at the Grecian
Saloon and other Theatres.
The First and Last Man rolled into one.
CHEMISTs (and carpenters, too, probably) pretend that bread made
from sawdust is much healthier than any other kind of bread. "We
certainly know of a very strong proof of this, for there's Wronicomp,
whº has been deriving his bread from sawdust for hundreds of years,
and still has the perfect use of his faculties; and what is more, pro.
mises to enjoy them for centuries to come.
A POKE AT THE *POTHECARIES.
(To the Board of Examiners, Apothecaries' Hall.)
MAY IT PLEASE You R WoRSHIPs, - ---
I HAyº been favoured with a copy of a petition addressed to
you by the chief medical and other scientific men at Liverpool, praying
you to receive, on the part of candidates for your license, certificates of
attendance at a College of Chemistry in that city. The Professor's
chemical tº. perceive, are attested by the first chemists in
the world, with LIEBIG at their head, and his school is recognised by
the College of Surgeons and the London University. Under these
circumstances I must be permitted to express my wonder at your impu-
dence in withholding your recognition of it.
You pretend, [am told, that one of your by-laws compels you not to
admit the certificates of any lecturer unconnected with a medical
school. Do you mean to call the Royal Institution a medical school
or to say º: you would refuse the certificates of BRANDE and
FARADAYP - -
I, invite you to tell me in confidence what private motive you have
for thus discouraging a º school of chemistry. Is it an affec-
tionate attachment to Physicians of London Hospitals, who patronize
you, and whom you call in, and with whom you carry on the pleasant
game of playing into one another's hands P
f you would have me believe that you are actuated by a zeal for
medical education, then, Worshipful Sirs, I must needs ask you who
are you, that set up your judgment against the London University and
College of Surgeons? Is not your Company a society of medicine-
vendors, dealing also in pepper, and keeping a *} for the sale of its
wares at the top of Union Street, Blackfriars? What else are you but
a fratermity of spurious physicians, who originally picked up a smattering
of medicine by mixing up prescriptions? T. - - - - -
I would not advise your Worships to rescind this by-law, which is so
injurious to provincial students and lecturers, and so insulting to your
professional betters. On the contrary, I hope you will reform none of
our absurd, regulations, but persist in them until you, provoke the
egislature to reform you altogether. Answer me candidly; do you
think it right, yourselves, that medical study should be subject to the
direction, and medical qualifications determined by the judgment, of a
. # jemia, and druggists, and decidedly rather druggists than
Chemists
. Understand, Worshipful Sirs, I do not object3. trade to you as a
disgrace. I only wish you would sick to it, and not aspire to dictate
to a liberal profession, but confine yourselves to your scales and galli-
ots. And with all the respect R can possibly entertain for a City
ompany, whose dinners I never hear of, believe me,

Numskulls, and a whole catacomb of other skulls, but Diamond Skulls

the ladies would be outshining one another to possess such a “jewel of

he could not tell what he might do till he applied his head to it; only in

IN consequence of the success of the Scottish Fête in LoRD Hol-

“PUTTING THE STONE” (THROUGH THE LIBRARY window.)
By way of substitute for the pastime of “Throwing the Hammer,” he
will enter the lists with anybody in the art of “Throwing the Hatchet.”
| This will be followed by the popular sport of
“Tossing the coppers,”
and immediately afterwards the unsuccessful parties will go through
the interesting ceremony of
“HoPPING THE TWIG,"
or, as it is still called in some parts of England,
“CUTTING THEIR LUCKY.”
MR. DUNUP is unwilling to plagiarise the Scottish practice ofFº:
on the bagpipes, but several musicians will be in attendance, and at the
| close of the day MR, DuNUP, with the whole of his friends, will join in
a running match, to avoid
“PAYING THE PIPER.”
| The fête will be resumed after dark, when the fine old nocturnal
|
ceremony of ii.
SHOOTING THE MOON."
| will be attempted by a few of the natives. There will be no strathpeys
or reels, with the exception of the well-known BARCLAY AND PERKINs'
reel to an accompaniment, in double X, flat; but the ancient game of
hop-Scotch will be hopped by a party of juvenile competitors.

CoNDUITE sans PARALLELE.
It seems that the attack upon Rome has been carried on by means of
parallels.”. We do not know much of the military merits of the
uestion, but we can safely assert that, in an honourable point of view,
the attack upon Rome has been most unparalleled.

THE FRENCH COCK AND
EAGLE.
THERE was an old Cock called the Coq de la Gloire,
He crowed over Seine, and he strutted in Loire,
He drank the blue waters of Rhone and Garonne,
And where'er there was fighting, was sure to make one.
From Egypt's hot sands to the wide steppe of snow,
This Cock o'er all sorts of winged rivals did crow;
From whole eyries of eagles the vict'ry he tore,
No matter how many the heads that they bore.
He e'en measured his spurs, lest their points should grow dull,
'Gainst the Lion of Spain and the big British Bull:
Nor e'en then this fierce Cock in his bag could be shut, -
Till his steels they were filed and his comb it was cut.
But he 'scaped from the bag, and was at it once more,
Spite of trainers and feeders, more fierce than before;
And he showed that he fought more for "...# than pelf,
For rather than not spar, he’d spar with himself;
Till e'en sages with love of Cock-fighting were bit,
} the style that game bird did his work in the pit.
1 were forced to confess he would quarrel for straws,
THE Roman
:
But his pluck was so true, men thought less of his cause.
We heard he was dead—that he is so is plain,
For that's not our old Cock now fighting a main: .
He boasts the old name, but boasts not the old skill— .
Though his colour’s the same, and his weight greater still.
For the old Cock would ne'er at a rival let fly
But asked bottom to floor him, and pluck to defy ;
The Eagles he tackled had broad wings to soar, |
Were awful of beak, and had talons that tore.
This an Eagle ! that scarce can flop out of his den—.
This bleared cripple, for years tethered close in a pen,
Dull-beaked, talon-blunted, unable to fly,
Tho' a flash of old rage is still red in his eye.
Hark! Europe encircles the pit, crying “Shame.”
Qn the Cock, now pure dung-hill, that once was true game; l
And what º; mingles with rage as we mourn,
Is the poor crippled Eagle's—the Cock hath our scorn.

FRENCH FASHIONS IN PARLIAMENT.
In the National House of Assembly, on Monday night the last but
one, the recently convicted *. having prayed to be heard by
counsel against the mitigation of their sentence:-
M. Ronocq demanded to know whether the prisoners seriously preferred being
executed to being transported? (Clamour and Confusion.)
M. GRATIN assailed M. RoboCQ in a strain of vehement invective.
M. Robocq accused M. GRATIN of declared sympathy with rebellion. (Murmurs.)
M. GRATIN said that the accusation was an untruth. (Sensation.)
A Member on the Left exclaimed that M. RoboCQ himself was the hired advocate of
rebels. (Clamour.
M. RR’Nols said that M. Ronocq was always his own trumpeter. There was a Gascon
proverb which said, that so long as such and such a person was alive, he would never
want a trumpeter. The voice of M. Robocq was a trumpet which he (M. RE'NoLs) did
not think musical. M. Robocq had in vain attempted to imitate the Gascon dialect;
his trumpet was not musical enough for that. -
M. Roboco reproached M. RE'NoLs with wanting to have a pull at the Exchequer.
M. RE'Nols absolutely denied the charge of M. Robocq.
M. Robocq. “There were two hundred Members in the Assembly who would attest
the utterance of those words”
M. RE'Nols (in a loud voice). “No 1" (Outcries.)
The Paksident. “Orderſ” (Renewed Clamour.)
M. RoboCQ insisted that the expressions were used.
M. DiLLoN BRAUN made a short observation. ,
M. Roboco. “The Honourable Member says it is false.”
- M. Dillon BRAUN: ‘That is not so; I said it was not true.” (Laughter and Confusion.)
M. Roboco asserted that M. Braun was not in a state in which it was possible to
notice any remark he might utter. (Question.) -
M. LoLLE's advised the Assembly to give M. Robocq rope enough.
M. Robocq demanded to know if any phrase of his had justified such an expression?
(Cries of “Yes!” “No / " and “Order!") : -
M. Lollie's said that M. Robocq was ignorant of the proverb.
M. Robocq complained that M. LoLLE's was aggravating the insult. But as he knew
that insolence was no answer, he also knew that ignorance was no argument, and that
vº abuse should not put him down in that Assembly. (Tremendous Uproar).
The PREsident would call on the Assembly to remember its dignity, and preserve
its character in the eyes of Europe; and order at length having been restored, the
Debate proceeded with not more than ordinary violence. -
How extremely discreditable are these angry altercations; how dero-
gatory to the honour of the Representative º of France l. How
gratifying to reflect that nothing of the kind ever happens to disgrace
the British Parliament Stay—we forget. The above-mutatis miſtandis
—is a faithful abridgment § a Debate in our own gentlemanlike and
quiet House of Commons.
