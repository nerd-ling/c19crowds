R. PUNCH, the embodiment of Christmas, stands in the Christmas market-place with his SEvenTEENTH
VolumE. His leaves, like the leaves of seasonable and mysterious Mistletoe, are—Mr. Punch would
modestly observe—suggestive of many kindred delights. They tell of holyday and good humour, though of
a somewhat different sort to the dim Mistletoe age, when Punch lived with the Druids, and cut his Mistletoe
bough with knife of virgin gold; by no means the sort of knife that has since nibbed goose-quills.
Mr. Punch is warmed to the very core of his heart to feel that his Christmas Volume, like aforesaid
Mistletoe, is everywhere a bit of household bravery — an indispensable illustration of the genial time.
There is a pretty, even a touching resemblance, between the book and the plant (the latter only being
parasitical).
As the wood-dove is the especial sower of the Mistletoe, so are the quills of the wood-dove the
quills of all others with which Punch delights to set forth his leaves.
As the Mistletoe will grow anywhere, and come out under any stress of place or circumstanée, so
have the leaves of Punch been put forth in strangest, and, except to eagles, inaccessible whereabouts.
Punch always strikes to the centre of his object—so does the Mistletoe. “A number of seeds,”
says Learned Doctor LINDLEY, discoursing of the Mistletoe, “a number of seeds were glued to the surface

of a cannon-ball; all the radicles were directed to the centre of the ball.” Is not this faculty wonderfully
the faculty of Punch * Put him upon the surface of anything, even of a cannon-ball; and, unerringly, he
strikes to the very centre of the iron cruelty.
The Mistletoe that grows upon oak is of every sort of Mistletoe the best; possessing virtues of
superior and more mysterious kind. Now, the British Oak—the particular tutelary oak that has been
a hundred times felled to the earth, and with it all England—that very oak is the roof-tree of Punch's
Office, 85, Fleet Street. (See “Ye Handboke of London’ by PETRUs CUNNINGHAMUs.)
Therefore, and for the above parallels is it, that Punch puts in a claim that his Christmas Volume
may be received only as so many leaves of Christmas Mistletoe. Therefore is it, that the spirit of Punch
will rejoice itself ubiquitously in every bough in every room and in every Hall; therefore is it, that alike
from the mantel-piece of the poor, as from the walls and roofs of the rich and the well-to-do, he wishes

MR. BROWN’s LETTERS TO A
YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
GREAT AND LITTLE DINNERS.
IT has been said, dear Bob,
that I have seen the maho.
ganies of many men, and it
is with no small feeling of
pride and gratitude that I
am enabled to declare also,
that I hardly remember in
my life to have had a bad
dinner. Would to Heaven
that all mortal men could say
likewise! Indeed, and in the
presence of somuch want and
misery as pass under our ken
daily, it is with a feeling of
something like shame and
humiliation that I make the
avowal; but I have robbed
no man of his meal that I
know of, and am here speak-
ing of very humble as well
as very grand banquets, the
which I maintain are, when there is a sufficiency, almost always gºod,
Yes, all dinners are good, from a shilling upwards. The plate of boiled
beef which MARy, the neat-handed waitress, brings or used to bring you
in the Old Bailey—I say used, for ah me! I speak of years long past,
when the cheeks of MARY were as blooming as the carrots which she
brought up with the beef, and she may be agrandmother by this time, or
apallid f. far out of the regions of beef;-from the shilling dinner of
beef and carrots to the grandest banquet of the season—everything is
good. . There are no degrees in eating. I mean that mutton is as gºod
as venison-beef steak, if you are hungry, as good as turtle-bottled
ale, if you like it, to the full as good as Champagne;—there is no
delicacy in the world which Monsieur FRANCATELLI or MossIEUR
Soy ER can produce, which I believe to be better than toasted cheese.
I have seen a dozen of epicures at a grand table forsake, every, French
and Italian delicacy for boiled leg of pork and pease pudding. You can
but he hungry, and eat and be happy. - - -
What is the moral I would deduce from this truth, if truth it be?
I would have a f. deal more hospitality practised than is common
amongus-more hospitality, and less show. Fº considered, the
quality of dinner is twice blest; it blesses him that gives, and him that
takes: a dinner with friendliness is the best of all º
a pºmpous entertainment, where no love is, the least satisfactory. . .
Why then do we of the middle classes, persist in giving entertain-
ments so costly, and beyond our means? º will be read by many a
man and woman next Thursday, who are aware that they live on leg of
mutton themselves, or worse than this, have what are called meat teas,
than which I can't conceive a more odious custom; that º they
are very sober in their way of life; that they like in reality that leg of
mutton better than the condiments of that doubtful French artist who
comes from the pastrycook's, and presides over the mysterious, stew.
#. in the kitchen: why then on their company dinners, should they
are up in the magnificent manner in which they universally do?
Everybody has the same dinner in London, and the same soup,
saddle of mutton, boiled fowls and tongue, entrées, champagne, and so
forth. Iown myself to being no better nor worse than my neighbours
in this respect, and rush off to the confectioner's for sweets, &c.; hire
sham butlers and attendants; have a fellow going round the table with
still and dry champagne, as if I knew his name, and it was my custom
to drink those wines every day of my life. I am as bad as my
neighbours; but why are we so bad, I ask?—why are we not more
forsaking the entrées which the men in white, Berlin gloves are handing
round in the Birmingham plated dishes. Asking lords and ladies, who
have great establishments of their own, to French dinners and deli-
cacies, is like inviting a grocer to a meal of figs, or a pastrycook to a
banquet of raspberry tarts. They have had enough of them. And great
folks, if they like you, take no count of your feasts, and grand prepa-
rations, and can but eat mutton like men. -
One cannot have sumptuary laws now-a-days, or restrict the gastro-
nomical more than any other trade: but I wish a check could be put
upon our dinner-extravagances by some means, and am confident that
the pleasures of life would greatly be increased by moderation. A man
might give two dinners for one, according to the present pattern. Half
}. money, is swallowed up in a dessert, which nobody wants in the
east, and which I always grudge to see arriving at the end of plenty.
Services of culinary kickshaws swallow up money, which gives no-
body pleasure, except the pastry-cook, whom it enriches. Everybody
lives as if he had three or four thousand a year. - -
Somebody with a voice potential should cry out against this over-
whelming luxury. What is mere decency in a very wealthy man is
absurdity—may, wickedness, in a poor one: a frog by nature, I am an
insane, silly creature, to attempt to swell.myself to the size of the ox,
my neighbour. Oh, that I could establish in the middle classes of
London an Anti-entrée and Anti-Dessert movement! I would go down
to º not ill-deserving of my country in such a case, and might be
ranked among the social benefactors. Letus have a meeting at WILLIs’s
Rooms, Ladies and Gentlemen, for the purpose, and Fet a few philan-
thropists, philosophers, and bishops or so, to speakſ. As people, in
former days, refused to take sugar, letus get up a society whic shall
decline to eat dessert and made-dishes.” . - - -
In this way, Isay, everyman who now 5. a dinner might give two;
and take in a host of poor friends and relatives, who are now excluded
from his hospitality. For dinners are given mostly in the middle classes
by way of revenge: and MR. an THoMPson ask MR. and
MRs. Johnson, because the latter have asked them. Aman at this rate
who gives four dinners of twenty persons in the course of the season,
each dinner º him something very near upon thirty pounds, receives
in return, we will say, forty dinners from the friends whom he has
himself invited. That is, M.R. and MRs. Johnson pay a hundred and
twenty pounds, as do all their friends, for forty-four dinners of which
they partake. So that they may calculate that every time they dine with
their respected friends, they pay about twenty-eight shillings per tºe.
What a sum this is, dear Johnson, for you and me to spend upon our
waistcoats! What does poor MRs. Johnson care for all these garish
splendours, who has had her dinner at two with the dear children in the
nursery? 'Our custom is not hospitality or pleasure, but to be able to
cut off a certain number of acquaintance from the dining list.
One of these dinners of twenty, again, is scarcely ever pleasant,
as far as regards society. You may chance to get near a pleasant
neighbour and neighbouress, when your corner of the table is possibl
comfortable. But there can be no general conversation. Twenty º
cannot engage together in talk... You would want a speaking trumpet
to communicate from your place by the lady of the house (for Iwish to
give my respected *ś the place of honour) to the lady at the opposite
corner at the right of the host. If you have a joke or a motto make,
you cannot utterit before such a crowd. A joke is nothing which can
only get alaugh out of a third part of the company. The most eminent
wags of my acquaintance are dumb in these great º and your
raconteur or story-teller, if he is prudent, willinvariably hold his tongue.
For what can be more odious than to be compelled to tella story at the
top of your voice, to he called onto Fº it for the benefit of a distºt
person who has only heard a part of the anecdote?" There are stories

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
of mine which would fail utterly, were they narrated in any but, an
under tone; others in which I laugh, am overcome by emotion, and so
forth—what I call my intimes stories. Now it is impossible to do justice
to these except in the midst of a general hush, and in a small circle; so
that I am commonly silent. And as no anecdote is positively new in
a party of twenty, the chances are so much against you that somebody
should have heard the story before, in which case you are done.
In these large assemblies, a wit, then, is of no use, and does not have
a chance: a raconteur does not get a fair hearing, and both of these real
ornaments of a dinner-table are thus utterly thrown away. I have seen
JAck Jolliffe, who can keep a table of eight or ten persons in a roar
of laughter for four hours, remain utterly mute in a great entertainment
smothered by the numbers and the dowager on each side of him : an
ToM YARNoLD, the most eminent of our conversationists, sit through a
dinner as dumb as the footman behind him. They do not care to joke,
unless there is a sympathising society, and prefer to be silent rather
than to throw their good things away.
What I would recommend, then, with all my power, is, that dinners
should be more simple, more frequent, and should contain fewer persons.
Ten is the utmost number that a man of moderate means should ever
invite, to his table; although in a great house, managed by a great
establishment, the case may be different. A man and woman may look
as if they were glad to see ten }*. but in a great dinner they
abdicate their position as host and hostess, are mere creatures in the
hands of the sham butlers, sham footmen, and tall confectioner's emis-
saries who crowd the room, and are guests at their own table, where
they are helped last, and of which they occupy the top and bottom. . I
have marked many a lady watching with §glances the large artificial
major-dºmo, who officiates for that night only, and thought to myself,
“Ah, my dear madam, how much happier might we all be if there were
but half the splendour, half the made dishes, and half the company
assembled.” *.
If any dinner-giving person who reads this shall be induced by my
representations to º: in his present career, to cut off some of the
luxuries of his table, and instead of giving one enormous feast to
twenty persons, to have three simple dinners for ten, my dear, Nephew
will not have been addressed in vain. Everybody will be bettered;
and while the guests will be better pleased, and more numerous, the
host will actually be left with money in his pocket.

LORD STANLEY'S LAPSUS LINGUAE.
IN a magniloquent after-dinner speech the other evening at the
Mansion House, delivered in acknowledgment of the toast, “LoRD
STANLEY and the House of Peers,” the noble Lord whose health had
been coupled with that of his Order, is reported to have made the
following inconsiderate assertion:—
“From whatever sphere men may seek to win their laurels, whether from the church,
the army, the navy, or the bar, it is to the House of Lords that they will look, as to the
place which is to witness the enthronement of their genius, and the final consummation
of their ambition.”
We had no idea that the Church was a “sphere” from which anybody
sought to win “laurels.” We always imagined that the palm, not the
laurel, furnished the reward of merit in that institution. We never
thought that the candidates for the crown of the Church, looked
forward to any such honour as the “enthronement” of their “genius;”
still less that . the House of Peers to witness the final
consummation of their ambition. We supposed that they had renounced
ambition, with all other mundane pomps and vanities, and that a Bishop
had an eye to something beyond a Bishoprick, even though accompanied
by a seat in the House of Peers. . We had, indeed, heard opinions con-
trary to these expressed by certain persons, whom we had always been
accustomed to regard as low revolutionists—violent, misguided men.
It is a sad pity that the Conservative LoRD STANLEY should have un-
warily confirmed the . of such people, by letting fall the fore-
going remark. We might not have been surprised to hear such an
observation at the “Square and Compasses,” after a bread-and-cheese
dinner in an atmosphere of beer and pipes; but we are astonished that
it should have been made, and by LoRD STANLEY of all men, at the
LoRD MAYoR's banquet, in one redolent of venison and turtle, and the
bouquet of Burgundy and Čaret.
WITTY ANTICS AND ANTIQUITIES.
OUR old friends the Archaeologists, seem to be driven up into a
corner for fresh subjects of research, and having exhausted almost
every barrow in the {. dom, till it is as empty as that of a sold-out
fruit-woman on a sº night, there is scarcely anything now-a-
days—not even a bone—into which the pickaxe of inquiry can be
thrust, in the hope of being able to pick a bit, - -
One of the fraternity of Archaeologians allowed his veneration for
antiquity to carry him to such wild extremes, that from the very old,
he has pounced upon the very young, and quitting the encampments,
fortifications, &c, &c., he has taken refuge in the Nursery songs of our
most tender-aged juveniles. He has actually seized the infantine ditty
of “High diddle diddle,” and made a clutch at the fabulous “cat”
whose vague connection with “the fiddle,” has been the subject of
Nursery song. . He, then rushes off to mount the imaginary, “cock-
horse’’ on which infants are suffered to ride to Banbury Cross, in
ursuit of a beldame on a milky mag—the aforesaid beldame having
i. on her toes, and no doubt a most effective clapper in her mouth, to
say nothing of the rings on her fingers, a fact suggestive to us of the
propriety of wringing her ears for her folly and absurdity.
/ \
\
If the archaeologists are so fearfully at a loss for themes of a dignified
class, some attention might at least be paid to the substantiality of the
subjects selected, and it would be desirable to abandon, the apocryphal
“cat and fiddle,” for the more easily intelligible “shoe,” lived in by the
“old woman" of antiquity. . There would at least be something, more
lofty in the pursuit of the elevation of the abode in question, than in
sounding the depth of the feline artesian to which grimalkin was happily
consigned, and even a survey of the ground on which the shoe is
supposed to have stood, might throw open to the observation an
extensive area. - - - -
The same º: of research might be made to take a physiological
turn if applied, not º to the houses of nursery lore, but to the
builders and architects of such *...* The house that JACK built,
would be a fine study, but Jack himself would be a still nobler subject
for the antiquarian to dwell upon.
It might be asked who was JACK-was he the same JACK that went
up the hill with JILLP Did he originate the popular measure which
bears his name? Was the fracture of JACK's crown, simple or com-
pound, or merely, one of, those yulgar fractions which carry, little
interest? The above will be sufficient to show the great mine of
inquiry that lies unexplored, if the Archæologians are disposed to go
into the better class of º traditions, and leave their cats, cock-
horses and other, inferior animals, for JACK, JILL, and the rest of the
great family of ſabled humanity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THE BANSHEE OF DRURY LANE.
THROUGH the lone pit-benches sighing, moaning from the boxes dim,
Wailing up the gallery staircase, shrieking in the lobbies grim,
Flits the Banshee of old Drury—Drury dusty, Drury dreary—
Dumb, where SHAKSPEARE's words once echoed; dark, where gas-
lights once shone cheery.
Now no more from maiden voices those deserted benches hear,
“Apples, oranges and biscuits—soda-water, ginger-beer;”
Now no more on boxing-nights the gallery-whistle pierceth shrill,
Costermonger costermonger greeting, with hoarse—“Halloo, BILL!”
Débardeurs and gents no longer quaff their gooseberry Champagne;
JULife N’s waistcoat, wig, and wristbands hold no more orchestral reign;
Now no more with ºl.” CAROLINE the sawdust stirs;
Chirpeth AURIOL no longer, bound no more the voltigeurs.
Qpera banished— horses vanished—SHAkspeaRE laid upon the shelf,
A weary time hath Drury's Banshee had the building to herself.
Till last week, old keys were turning in old locks all stiff with rust,
With a sweeping of old cobwebs, and a raising of old dust;
And the Banshee heard the sweepers talking, in their besoms' pause,
Of the meeting that was summon'd thither in Protection's cause:
How there would be, if not seven, at least one RICHMOND in the field,
Until Cobden's hash was settled, and Corn-Law Repeal repealed.
Came at last the time appointed; through the dusty panes the day
Shot some thin blue beams of sunshine, sunshine that had lost its way;
In the flies the puzzled Banshee heard the speechifying flow,
From the entry of the chairman, till reporters rose to go.
“Hark.” * said, “Old Farce reviveth—LISTON on that stage we’ve

But your Bosanquets and BookERs are than Liston more absurd.

Thus to make two thousand flats accordant in a single key.
“What are JULLIEN's monster concerts to the orchestra below, -
When in YoUNg’s mouth PEEL's the serpent, and when Dukes their
trumpets blow P
“E’en the Cirque,” she said, “reviveth—what is AURIOL's grace or
strength,
To the way that BookER jumpeth to conclusions, any length
"What was CAROLINE to ELLMAN-on his hobby as he flies,
Ever moving in a circle, throwing dust in people's eyes?
“What, thro' hoops or over garters, fair ANATO's leaping acts,
To a BERESFORD’s or RICHMOND’s leap o'er figures, and through facts?
Ancient glories kindle round me—old renown reseeks the Lane—
Farce and music, play and horses—Drury is herself again.”
THE OBSEQUIES OF AN OLD, NUISANCE,
NoTwithstanding the devoted attentions of the Attorney-General,
SIR FREDERICK THESIGER, and other professional friends, the poor
old Palace Court is sinking rapidly, and, indeed, under such attacks as
haye, rapidly succeeded each other lately, cannot survive much longer.
All is, arranged for the sad event of a dissolution, now, certainly,
infºil; The poor old sufferer has made the following brief will:-
, Palace Court, being weak of body, and much troubled in mind, do
hereby make my last will and testament.
... Item. My quirks, quibbles, and quiddits, all and sundry, wheresoever
situate, I bequeath to my unnatural relation, New County Čourt, hearing
he is much in want of the same, and cannot boast a decent pleading to
his back. I, hereby forgive my said relation for his wicked attacks on
me, and for the unpleasant comparison between me and himself of which
he has been the author, and to which I partly attribute this my
sore sickness. -
Item. My curse I bequeath to my prothonotary, in trust, to lay it
at the door of JAcOB OMNIUM, and the author of a ballad called “JAcoB
OMNIUM's Oss.”.
Item. My bills of costs, I bequeath to my attorneys, and I wish they
may get them.
Item. My sinecures I, bequeath to the nation, for such compensation
as Parliament may be pleased to give.
Item. My memory I'... to universal odium and contempt. . .
This Will has been duly attested by the four attorneys and six
barristers who have so long shared the shelter of the testator's roof,
amidst a most affecting scene of partings and regrets. The sufferer
dies hard, and rallies at moments for the most desperate struggles, but
is growing hourly weaker.
very arrangement has been made for the funeral, of which we owe
the following programme to the courtesy of the Chief Usher, so long a
confidential servant of poor P. C.:—

FAMous old ORPHEUs from regions celestial
Late dropped his lyre and his bright laurel crown,
And with them the voice that ears human and bestial
Led by the nose, early Greece up and down.
“Here, Mr. Punch,” he said, “take 'em, make

Chords and cadenzas that charmed brutes and men—
Be it yours to give back to the world the old touch

Till Echo announces, ‘Here’s ORPHEUs again.”

MATRIMONIAL ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF WAR.
ERSONs addicted to Matri-
mony, may be pleased
to learn that a Societ
is about to be formed,
under the title of—
“THE-MATRIMONIAL-
ARBITRATION-INSTEAD-
9F-WAR-SQCIETY.” It
is principally composed
of husbands who have
deeply felt the absurd.
ity, of going to war
with their wives, when
the matrimonial differ-
ences , could probably
have been better ar-
ranged by friendly arbi-
tration. The Society
does not for a moment
pretend that Matrimo-
nial War can ever be
totally done away with.
**ś.
of the difficulties that
- - men have to contend
with in making their wives listen, tº reason, and they are painfully
sensible of the many obstacles that ladies have to overcome, before
they can get their husbands to do as they wish them, to do. Extra-
ordinary cases of course will arise, when both parties will not be
able to agree, and when arguments are of no value in calming the
ſiliº Wiśs
º ill º'
| º
such cases, for neither side is in a fit state to listen to it; but inasmuch
as most Matrimonial Wars are followed by Arbitration, it is proposed
that it be tried first before the mischief be done, instead of afterwards,
when the mischief is already done. It has been calculated by a gentle.
man who has peculiar sources of information in the highest as well as
the lowest º of society, that no less than 20,562 cups and saucers
are broken every year in London alone. ... The velvet gowns, also, and
the whitebait dinners and ºr. boxes, that are ammually expended in
celebrating the peace after along Matrimonial War, would be sufficient,
if collected into hard money, to pay off the National Debt in a very
few years. - - -
The Society, however, does not wish to curtail these enjoyments, as
they maintain that it would be extremely unkind, not to say injudicious,
to deprive any lady of her just rights; moreover, the committee is most
anxious to gain the active co-operation of the ladies, and feels that it is
only to be done by making every possible concession which the fair sex
has a right to expect, if not to demand. The above privileges, therefore,
will be secured to them in their unbroken entirety, and not the slightest
interference be attempted to deprive them of any little advantage which
wives are generally sure to gain from carrying on a slight periodical
war. Hysteries, nervous head-aches, losses, of appetite, and stamping
fits, will still be guaranteed to them by the Society, which pledges
itself, likewise, to use its best exertions in upholding in its full integrity,
the valuable prerogative, which ladies have enjoyed from time immemo.
rial, of “keeping their bedrooms” as long, as they please, from the
moment that they have a “disagreeable word” with their husbands.
The proud object which “The Matrimonial-Arbitration-instead-of-
War-Society” wishes to effect, is to prevent those fretful fracas and
distressingerposés which, it is found, Iower the character of both man
and wife in the estimation of their friends and servants, besides
oviding mothers-in-law with opportunities for .# mischief.
tatements will be made under seal of the strictest confidence to a
competent committee, selected from the best husbands and wives in the
world, who will repair in person to the seat of war, and endeavour by
arbitration, to soothe the irritated feelings of the contending parties
and to remove, by patient investigation, all absurd prejudices, an
jealousies. This dangerous task will be confided to persons of the
most undaunted courage, who have often proved themselves equal to
the greatest Matrimonial emergencies. If they fail, however, in their
benevolent endeavours, they will then leave the belligerents to them-
selyes, who must settle their differences in the best manner they can.
The Committee is also happy to state that arrangements have been
completed with the Mornin }. not to allude by any innuendo what-
ever, to any Matrimonial difference, as long as negociations are pendin
with the Society, or to publish any facts—even under the disguise o
initials—until the affair has been §: up by the Committee as per-
fectly hopeless, and all arbitration despaired of, when a notice wilſ be
served upon both parties that the Society no longer holds itself
responsible for the consequences; and if they fight, that they must do
so at their own cost and peril.
A detailed prospectus, and a list of patrons and subscribers will be
passions of either man or wife. Arbitration is not meant to apply to #
published in a few days. In the meantime, the Committee is most
proud to state, that MRs. CAUDIE has sent in her adherence to the
principles of the Society. With such, powerful influence, the cause
must flourish, and the Utopian day is already looked forward to when
Matrimonial War will be unknown on the surface of the globe, and
will only be mentioned in terms of astonishment and horror, that such
an atrocity could ever have existed in an age that pretends to be in
the least civilised. . Society is deserving of the support of
every respectable married man and lady, and we are glad to state that
the yearly subscriptions will be so s as to come within the means
of everybody.
THE FATE OF DRURY LANE.
AFTER all the discussion that has taken place upon the future lessee.
ship of this great national establishment, it seems that neither
ANDERSON nor STAMMERs is yet the lessee—and, as friends to both, we
would say of each, the less he has to do with it the better. But the
house has been taken by some very nice }. men for that very small
# the Protectionists; instead of an attempt at the revival of the old
nglish drama, a scarcely less arduous effort is to be made to revive the
new English farce of the Agriculturist. The fact is, that the line of
heavy, countrymen went out with EMERY, and we do not expect that the
nobodies who are being brought up to London as “provincial celebrities,”
will revive the taste for the rant of outraged farmers, broad-dialected
victims of oppression, and other effete nuisances. If the Protectionist
º really wish to become popular on the boards of Drury Lane, they
ad better try even that desperate º the regular, drama, than
hope to take the town by storm with their noisy little bits of rustic
character.
The names of the performers are not very illustrious, but a MR.
BºokER, who has come out rather strong in figures, might, perhaps,
take the MICHAEL CAssios—by which we mean, the arithmeticians in
eneral...This may not be quite agreeable to Mr. ANDERson, the
intendedlessee; and as to MR.STAMMERs, he is quite forgotten, -unless,
indeed, we are reminded of his name by the hesitating mode of delivery
# *: the performers in possession of Drury Lane, are apt to express
emselves.
THE FRENCH COCKATRICE IN ROME.
A very full and excellent book has of late been written on domestic
fowls... But there is one curious circumstance connected with the
subject—and well-attested by the wisdom of our ancestors—altogether
omitted. We find, no account of the Cockatrice that, upon the best
authority, is a snake that, under the frequent, name of basilisk, was
wont to be called the little king of serpents. . Now, the cockatrice, or
basilisk, according to high authority, was hatched from a cock's egg.
“A basilisk”—says the grave ScALIGER—" was found in Rome in the
days of Leo THE FourTH.”. And in the luckless, shuffling times of PIUs
THE NINTH, whole flights of basilisks—hatehed from cock's eggs—have
alighted in destruction on the roof-tops of the Eternal City. -
ARON,CuviPR takes the cockatrice in hand, and declares, the thing
to be a thing fabulous. “It was most absurdly imagined,” says the
Baron, “to proceed from the eggs of old cocks. , AIDROWANDus and
several other writers have given figures of it.” Again, in the history
of the French, Royal Academy, is an account of cock's eggs, laid at
Montpellier: “One of these eggs, opened in the presence of several
savans, was found devoid of yolk, but exhibiting a coloured particle in
the centre, which was considered as the young serpent.” To produce
this serpent, it was necessary, in the olden day, that the egg should be
“hatehed under a toad.” In our time—for the cockatrice is proved to
be not fabulous—the French produce the reptile under a ſº
The cock—the old Gallic cock—has laid eggs for Rome. The glorious
QUDINot throws the shells into the Eternal City; they, burst, and the
desolating snake-produced by Cock and Frog-"strikes its victim
dead by a single glance.”
Gentish Enormi-ties.
REALLY some boundary should be put to the young gentlemen's ties.
They protrude so much on each side, that you can scarcely pass down
Regent Street without having the sharp end of a Joinville thrust into
your face, Ladies are great victims to these enormous ties. It is time
some limit was put to the growth of º excrescences, for, if
they keep on growing, no young, gent be able to go through
Temple Bar unless he slides in sideways. We propose that policemen
be armed with large shears, and empowered to lop of all the Joinvilles
and Beauforts that stick out more than six inches beyond each shoulder.
This is very liberal measure, and should satisfy the most fastidious.
NorwitHSTANDING GENERAL OUDINor's,inglorious, success, before
the walls of Rome, very few people would like to stand in the French-
men's breaches.

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HINT TO OUR ROYAL ACADEMY.
THE Exhibition of Pictures at the Tuileries
has lowered its catalogue from one franc to
ten sous, and more than this, the admission,
five or six days out of the week, is free. We
boast of our liberal institutions, but liberal as
they are, you cannot get into one of them º wº
without paying—and paying, in many in- > º
stances, very dearly too. MADAME Tussaud ºsº | \\
only charges sixpence for her catalogue, why §
couldn’t the Royal Academy do the same * -
They might make up the difference by charging
something extra for their Chamber of Horrors,
we mean the Octagon Room, or by turning
that abode of darkness into a place for re-
freshments.
We do not see why the Royal Academy
could not print its catalogue for one half the
price, and charge admission only on one day
of the week, the Saturday, as the Tuileries
does, and the receipts even of that day be
#. as in France, to some poor artists'
und. This would be a picture of Charity,
which we are extremely anxious to see every
artist of the Academy trying his hand upon.
The sooner it is exhibited, the better we
. be pleased at this masterpiece of English
ASTLEIAN HISTORY OF THE INDIAN WAR.
VERY book-worm boasts
of the Bodleian Library;
we will wager Íombard
Street (Whitefriars) to
a chainy orange, (if any
fruit thus ſettered can
be found,) that the Bod-
leian fibrary will con-
tain . nothing half so
striking as may be met
with in the Astleian
Library, should such a
collection ever beformed.
* Until we saw the other
# night the amphitheatrical
Nº version of the Indian
2 War, we had no idea of
: the circumstances out of
5 which it arose, and we
confess ourselves tho-
roughly confounded by
the flood of light let in
upon the subject by the
--- - Astleian dramatist.
So far from British or Indian policy having had anything to do with
the Indian War, it seems, according to Astley's (true) Bill, that the
original fue of hostility, commenced in a row that occurred in the
Course 0
SCENE I.—A Public House in Gravesend.
A dispute with a turbulent beadle is the first glimpse we get of the
dian war, which begins to develop itself in
SCENE II.-Grand Indian Festival,
where Shere Singh is having, a pas de deur danced before him, while
he sits upon the sawdust, with a fair captive by his side, who turns out
to be Mrs. Captain Best, of the Bungay Rifle Corps., Our old friend
Shere, is enjoying the ballet (in which by-the-by, all the dancers turn
their backs upon him), when the Gravesend Beadle, who it appears has
got the premiership of the Punjaub—nobody knows how or why—rushes
in to announce “a minstrel,” who turns out to be Captain Best in
disguise, and who requests permission to “strike his ſight guitar.”
Shere Singh assents, and the light guitar being struck, emits the
sound of an entire orchestra, rather overloaded with brass, to whose
sounds dancing is resumed, until an explosion is heard “without,”
and the cry “The Punjaub is attacked” becomes general. Shere Singh
rushes, out, consigning his captive (Mrs. Best) to the minstrel (Captain
B. in disguise); a recognition takes place between the Beadle premier
of the Punjaub and the British Officer, and the Scene finishes up with

a rich bit of pathos, relieved by a slight seasoning of low comedy.
The next incident in this “strange eventful history” is the “Bivouac
of the British Army,” introducing the whole of the original Astleian
stud of goats, cows, zebras, poneys (Jerusalem and other); but the
effect was somewhat marred º an inquisitive horse, who would get up
before his time in spite of his being sat down º by six Sepoys, whom
the obstinate brute dislodged, as if with a cool determination to ascer.
i. º state of the pit, and stare out of countenance the front row of
e gallery.
A. the bivouac, there was a “Front Scene,” in which Lord Gough,
surrounded by a brilliant Staff of three, makes a spirited speech from a
horse which seemed alternately disposed to jib through the canvas flat
at the back, or plunge forwards into the orchestra. Lord Gough was
understood to say, as connectedly as his oscillating horse would let him,
that “The Indian hound should be taught to shrink from the British
bulldog,” or words to that effect. -
After a few intermediate scenes, in which the Gravesend Beadle, a
comic Marine, Shere Singh, and a musical Kivandière take part, the
attack begins upon Mooltan with a squib, and a company of Lancers—
“Two's Company” in this case—rushes on, clashing their swords
against the wooden pike-staffs of the Indians, whose "... are as plain
as a pike-staff, in the amphitheatrical version of the onslaught.
The mélée now becomes general, and dolls dressed in regimentals are
thrown down by the property man, to represent the killed and wounded,
for the horses to gallop over them. The contest is continued with such
fury that, leaving the fortifications of Mooltan, the combatants pour
into the circle usually set apart for the horsemanship, and Shere ºf:
being eventually killed, walks out bowing from the ring, amid the
º: of the audience. The band strikes up “Rule Britannia,” Lord
ough forms, the centre of a tableau lighted by red fire, and the curtain
descends on the dramatic abridgment of the “History of the War in
India.” We must, in justice, confess that nothing is wanting to give the
fullest effect to the illusion, and that the abridgment is considerably
better calculated, for stage representation, than the most elaborate
despatches, detailing the minutest incidents of an affair which could
not have been better got up in India, under LoRD Gough, than at the
foot of Westminster Bridge, under M.R. BATTY, Stage Manager.

Red Republican Martyrs.
THE greatest F. sacrifice we have yet heard of among the Red
Republicans in France has been the simultaneous abandonment of their
beards by the Socialists, who until latterly cultivated these hirsute
emblems of a desire to beard the Government. Mº of the Reds
feeling conscious that they had experienced only a hair's breadth
escape from the hands of justice, have divested themselves of all super-
fluous hair that could only serve to remind them of their recent danger.
The Anti-beard movement has, we understand, raised razors, in Paris
at least two per cent, and soap, which lately remained on hand, has
met with general countenance.

THE SLANG OF THE SONG-WRITERS.
WE have from time to time endeavoured to check the fashionable song-
writers in their search after the sentimental; but though we have suc-
ceeded occasionally in pulling them up rather short, we find the balladist’s
Pegasus, like the Astley's Mazeppa–with the sieve of oats attracting
him at the wing—“again urging on his wild career.” When the as-
tonished world was asked by the music-sellers, whether it would love
somebody or other “then as now 2° we were not surprised when the
music-sellers, responding to their own query—because they thought it
likely enough to answer—replied, “Then as how I’ll, love thee more,”
or words to that effect. It is a well established fact, that in purchasin
a song, no one thinks of looking beyond the first line, and as in leg
conveyancing, so in the conveyance of a ballad from the shelves of the
publisher, the first requisite is to make a good title. -
Talk of the burdens on land, we are convinced that a committee of
inquiry into the burdens of songs would, in many quarters, be consi-
dered a subject of far greater interest. Though Fº: beginnings may
be followed by the most lame and impotent of endings, it matters
nothing to the ballad-loving public, who are so caught by the idea of
being loved “then as now,” that they never stop to inquire the existing
quantity of affection, or to ascertain the character of the individual who
is calle º to say whether the supply will be kept up at a future
Pºi He have heard of º: sustained by one scene, comedies
kept alive by one situation, and farces, rescued from failure by a †
joke—which is not unfrequently an old one; but however apocryphal
these things may be, there is no doubt of the fact that fashionable
ballads are held up in public favour by a single line. Their, existence
may be said to hang by a thread, aud that thread is one which there is
often the utmost, difficulty in unravelling. We shall be exceedingly
happy to supply the principal music publishers with a series, of these
lines at the mere price of a song—say a hundred guineas—and we beg
to throw off the following as a few samples:–
“Oh, don't I love you rather, still 8"
“They tell me thou hast pass'd the Court.”
“I dare not use thy cherish’d name.”
But perhaps the music publishers, before they venture to give us our
terms—moderate as they are—will desire to see a song regularly per-
fected for publication, and we therefore beg to submit the .#
which is enriched with the whole of the three gems we have so lavishly
thrown down in the shape of titles, and which, in the plenitude of our
poetical wealth, we embody in a single ballad :
Oh! don’t I love you rather still?
Are all my pledges set at nought P
Dishonour’d is affection's bill?
Or pass'd is Love's Insolvent Court P
Is memory's schedule coldly filed
On one of CUPID's broken darts?
Is HyMEN’s balance sheet compiled—
A bankrupt’s stock of damaged hearts?
2nd Verse.
I dare not use thy cherish’d name—
Would'st thou accept were I to draw P
The God of Love may take his aim,
But with an arrow made of straw.
Each fonder feeling that I knew
A lifeless heap of ruin lies:
Yes, false one—ticketed by you.
“Look here !—Alarming Sacrifice!!!”
THE FORTUNE OF WAR.
It is gratifying to know that military men have a way opened to
them of earning a shilling a day, and glory, without danger, or any
#. fatigue. :Qur brave fellows” (as private soldiers are called in
espatches and “Military Reminiscences”) may now taste the excite-
ments of war amidst all the blessings of , and imbibe the porter
of BARCLAY between every bite of the blank cartridge, thus securin
the life-giving pewter, whilst they repudiate the death dealing lead.
The “Siege of Badajos,” at the Surrey Zoological Gardens; the
“Storming of Mooltan” at Cremorne Gardens; and the “New Grand
Equestrian Military Spectacle, entitled Mooltan and Goojerat, or The
Conquest of the Sikhs’ at Astley's, have so raised the value of the
soldier in the commercial market, that the rival policeman is looking
bluer than ever from sheer envy. On the arrival of dusk, every evening
just now, there is such a cannonade—such discharges of musquetry—
such springing of mines—such a “jolly row,” in short—that it seems as
if the continent had come to pay us a visit, and several old ladies have
been frightened into fits, from an idea that the “Chartishes” had risen,
and had got beyond the power of the “specials” and their staves.
CoLoRELSIBTHoRP should really make a point of asking a few questions
on the subject in the House.
OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
THE competition which prevails among the daily news-papers forces
“our own correspondent” into the thick of every battle, the focus of every
bombardment, the crest of every barricade, and between the folding
doors of every cabinet, so that it is no wonder if he becomes occasion.
ally rather “bothered.” He is required to catch the manners living as
they rise, to condense rumours into facts, fermentation into opinions,
unaccomplished theories into accomplished facts. He must not be more
than twenty-four hours behind the times, and is therefore thrown
upon first thoughts, whereas second thoughts are best. Besides as idle
news is better than no news at all, he may always say something in one
letter, if only to contradict it in his next.
Thus he may inform his journal in No
Tchzrkjmet have been exterminated by the
and the city reduced to a heap of ruins.”
1, that, “The insurgents of
Imperialists under SchLICK,
No 2. hastens to correct the utterly groundless report of Nol, and
to announce on “authority that may be relied on,” that Tcharkjmet,
like MoTHER HUBBARD's dog, is on its legs, again, and that the
“national flag is now flying over the Domkirche,” as “our own corres-
pondent” can distinctly perceive through “our own" telescope.
No. 3 corrects No. 2, and announces that “the flag described as
national in our last, is the Imperial banner of the B. Eagle,” that
"the Imperialists have crossed the Waag in triumph, on the surrender
of Tchzrkjmet,” and that “the notorious PuſzTzykwqHY has esca
with the contents of the Treasury, and is believed to have, escaped to
London in the disguise of a waiter seeking a situation at the Sablonière.”
An illustrated journal of the same week, however, gives us “the por:
trait of the illustrious PULZTzykwcHY in his uniform of Commandant
of the important fortress of Tchzrkjmet, which continues, thanks to his
>
glorious resistance, to hold the Imperialists at bay.” Really, the name
of these flying reporters º: to be changed to that of “our own con-
tradictories,” for why should they be called “correspondents,” when no
two of their letters correspond with each other'

Mr. Pips
Monday, June 18, 1849. THIs Day a great, Cricket Match, Surrey
#. ngland, at LoBD's, and I thither, all the way to St. John's
ood, to see the Place, having often heard talk of it, and the Playing,
which MR. LoNGSTOPPE did tell me was a pretty Sight...Paid 6d. to be
let in, and 2d. for a Card of the Innings, and bought a little Book of the
Laws of the Game, cost me lº. 6d. more, though, when I had got it,
could hardly understand a Word of it; but to think how much Money
I spend out of Curiosity, and how inquisitive I am, so as to be vexed to
the Heart if I cannot thoroughly make out every Thing I see 1. The
Cricketing I believe very fine; but could not judge of it; for I think I
did never before see any Cricket since I was a little Varlet Boy at
School. But what a Difference between the Manner of Bowling in
those Days, and that Players now use ! for then they did moderately
trundle the Ball under-hand; but now they fling it over-handed from
the Elbow, as though yiciously, and it flies like a Shot, being at least
Five Ounces and a Half in Weight, and hard as a Block. I saw it strike
one of the Bat-men on the Knuckles, who Danced and shook his Fist, as
methought well he might, , But to see how handy, some did catch it,

laws for women, who we are in the habit of saying are not so clever
as we are.
My dear Nephew, as I grow old and consider these things, I know
which are the stronger, men or women; but which are the cleverer, I
doubt. Brown THE ELDER.
COWARDY! COWARDY! CUSTARD !
He who in youth has been occasionally deficient in courage may
remember to have been addressed in the above terms, and to have been
recommended, at the same time, to make a meal on the contents of the
paternal mustard-pot. A similar recommendation might at the present
moment be made to a certain secretary of the Republic of San
Salvador, now resident at Rome, who joined the remainder of the
Consuls in a protest against the bombardment of the Eternal City.
After the names of John FREEBORN, consular agent to her Britannic
Majesty; JEAN BRAvo, consul of Denmark, and a few others; we have
the signature of “A. SHAKING, secretary of the Republic of San
Salvador.” The nervousness of this secretary, under the dread of
bombardment, must have been something truly horrible to have set
him. A Shaking in the manner described; and the Republic of San
Salvador, though it cannot be said its representative at Rome is no
eat shakes, must feel rather humiliated by the ague-like condition
into which the secretary allows himself to be thrown, by the siege
operations of the French army.
THE MONSTER PANORAMA MANIAs.
| WE have long ago come to the conclusion that the present is the age
of Monsters, a conviction that was not disturbed by a slight outbreak of
| Dwarfs a year or two ago, for there is always a tendency in extremes to
meet, and if a Giant starts a show, it is ten to one but a Dwarf will set
up next door to him. We began with Monster Meetings: we have
since had Monster Concerts, but Monster Panoramas are the latest
monstrosity to which we have been subjected. The rival American
rivers have brought an overflow to the banks of their respective pro-
rietors, and the Mississippi, as well as the Ohio and the Hudson, have
or some time had the tide of success running in their favour.
We have often wondered that no native artist has adopted the Yankee
notion, and made a Panoramic Painting of the New River, beginning at
the mouth of SIR. Hugh MyDDELton's head-who, by the way, must
have suffered severely from water on the brain, considering that his head
has been for the last century or so a tremendous reservoir. -
It appears from our contemporary the Builder that three English
draughtsmen have lately n
up the Nile, for the purpose of
taking a rough draught of its
waters, and we are shortly to
have a Panorama of that inte-
resting river. We can imagine
the exertions made by the artists
in their process of taking their
sketches from the spot, and we
can fancy one of them mounted
on a camel, the camel's hair
being from time to time cut to
replenish the brushes, while the
hump of the brute might be con-
verted into a sort of easel very
easily. Whatever may be the
intrinsic merits of the forth-
coming picture—and we have no
doubt they will be great—we
ought to take into consideration
- - - the co of the artists in
exploring such a river as the Nile, and looking all its perilous features
in the face, * when some of those features include the mouth
and teeth of that
dental phenome-
non-whom we
should not like
accidentally to
encounter – the
Crocodile. It is

draughtsman on the Nile could scarcely ever feel his leg at ease in a
place where so many gaping-mouthed monsters are ready to come as
residuary legatees into possession of the limb of any one who, while
º: his best leg foremost, is compelled to leave his worst leg a
ttle way behind him.
We cannot, of course, look for any high degree of finish in these
paintings, whose merit is measured by their mileage rather than by the
talent the artists have displayed, for we presume that the colours can
be laid on with nothing more delicate than a mop in the production of

OUR UNIHEALTHY COURTS.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
“ALL the agitation which has been raised against the Metro-
politan Nuisances has, alas! only verified the old vulgar proverb as to
the consequences of stirring anything that is unpleasant. - - -
“Those sinks of iniquity in Doctors' Commons, the Ecclesiastical
cesspools, exist still in all their offensiveness. The Arches Court
abomination in particular, in which the rubbish of ages has been allowed
to accumulate, continues to disgrace the legislature and the period.
“The foul and filthy dens in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane
and Lincoln's Inn yet remain in as disgusting a state as ever. Nothin
has been done to rectify the arrangements of the Patent Qffice, whic
are such as to smother nine-tenths of our inventive population. The
noisome abuses of the Palace Court are unabated, in spite of their
notorious enormity. That drain upon the vitals of all who have the
misfortune to get within its influence, in the Court of Chancery-
the worst Court in London, is still open, poisoning the atmosphere far
and near, like any Upas. -
“The unwholesome condition of Westminster Hall is scandalous to
that Parliament to whose place of meeting it is contiguous. In most
of these localities the fever of litigation rages with pestilential violence;
and their atmosphere is intolerably oppressive, especially to the poorer
classes. It was hoped that a noble and learned Lord was about to
sweep them clean; but for that purpose I am afraid we want a new

any school from “taking a sight” at any schoolmaster.

RECIPROCITY. A POLITICO-ECONOMICAL IDYLL.

I’d show how Britons can do Yankees brown!

While Shipping Laws and Tariffs tie my hands,
Riled to compete, New York State me has back'd

Though CoBDEN-ridden, still is John Bull deep.
How can such competition equal be,

JONATHAN. -
I’ll give you that or aught—my dander's riz—
But first explain what that you ask for is.
JOHN.
Our Laws have loosed my hands, while yours, more kind,
With close Protection have your arms confined;
If I’m to dig ’gainst you, with chance to win,
My limbs must be tied up 'ere I begin.
For how, my friend, can my free hands e'er hope
In wielding tools with your tied hands to cope?
Not so—my teachers in Protection's school
Have taught to me, thank Heaven, a wiser rule,
Never to part with aught that cramps one’s powers,
Unless our rival’s hands be loosed, like ours.
JONATHAN.
Enough. But say—was he as taught your school

We are happy to find, that, in addition to Young England parties,
Tory.parties, Whig parties, Radical parties, and Charter parties, wé
are likely to have at last a good water party in the country, for the
purpose of obtaining purity in what may be fairly called one of the
great elements of society. There is at last something in the wind, on
the subject of what has too long been suffered to exist in the water.
The existing companies will find that, though we have hitherto allowed
them to layit on to us just as they liked, we have resolved to use all our
might tº reject the existing main, and summarily to put out the pipes of
those who are determined to make us go through thick and thin for a cup
of tea from our own cisterns.
There is no Place like the Home Office.
. The answer to a public deputation is generally a promise “to con-
sider.” , EARL GREY might certainly be called the most promising man
of the administration. He could issue promissory notes, which should
run thus:– “In three months' time I promise to consider, &c.” They
would save a deal of worry and expectation, if well circulated amongst
public bodies, for a deputation would know at once what to expect.
As it is, people, say that, despite the long time the Home. Secretary
takes, “to consider, his decisions are never worth the smallest consi.
deration, They declare “he is the very slowest Minister, considering.”

St. Horse.
GRAND BANQUET TO MR. PUNCH.
IN imitation of the Sovereign of these dominions—
whose example a person as distinguished even as
Mr. Punch may be proud to follow—the acknow-
ledged Sovereign of the Press has graciously con-
descended to accept the hospitality which some of
his subjects have ventured to offer him. The first
of a series of entertainments was the other day given
to him by MR. DUNUP, that very distinguished sub-
ject, who has on more than one occasion entertained
the world at large, and who, preliminary to his bein
gazetted as C.B., Common Bankrupt, or ºã
at court—that court whose brightest ornaments are
in basso relievo, or, in other words, where insolvents
stand out in base relief—was permitted to entertain
his Fleet-Streatian Majesty.
At precisely five o’clock, Punch, accompanied by
Toby, who wore the collar of his own order, arrived
at the º staircase of MR. DUNUP's chambers. The popular air
of “Who’s that knocking at the door?’’ was immediately struck
up from the inside, and was replied to . “Come, if you dare,”
in a minor key through the major, key-hole. The outer door was
immediately thrown open sufficiently, to admit the distinguished guests,
but was immediately, closed on its being ascertained i. the sheriff,
with a promptitude that did him credit, had despatched two or three of
his officers to render good service of various writs, had there been an
::". of doing so. Mr. Punch was accordingly received with a
aam from MR. DUNUP, followed by a slam of the outer door, which
served as an efficient substitute for a royal salute, echoed as it was by the
. of the officers on the outside, who, after a few volleys of abuse,
retired.
MR. DUNUP received his visitors upon a raised mat, and having
thus placed himself on the high ropes, he was enabled to assume
a becoming dignity. Having led the way along the hall of hat pegs,
the floor of which was covered with cloth, of the richest oil, from
the manufactory of SMITH AND BABER, and worthy of the palace of
ALI BABA himself, MR. DUNUP proceeded past the celebrated DUNUP
diamond—the well-known black one—which was placed in the helmet of
one of his ancestors, a helmet coal-scoop given him by his grandmother.
Mr. Punch was then conducted to the inner apartment, where the banquet
was laid out in the most tasteful manner. Fverything—including the
late—was of British manufacture; and a brass band stationed outside,
ſº struck up “Al idea di quel metallo,” the effect was quite
electro-cal. On a temporary, buffet—made of the wash-hand stand,
and covered with a piece of carpet from one of the Minsters, either
Ax or Kidder, we are unable to say which, stood a handsome china
salver, containing the whole of MR. DUNUP's stock of silver—three
shillings, with a fourpenny bit—which had been displayed with a due
regard to effect on this occasion. Over the mantel-piece was
º what MR. DuNuP calls the Magna Charta, or Great Bill of
is Family—being a bill for £20, accepted by one of his ancestors
and unsullied by that appendage in the corner, which has place
so many of MR. DUNUP's notes or bills º; the Notabilia of our
commercial history. Punch sat in the place of honour, Toby standing,
as he always does, on his own right, and MR. DUNUP placing himself
opposite.
The Banquet was of the most gorgeous description; consisting of
beef thoroughly 3-la-mode, and salad, such as might suit, the fastidious
taste of even a Saladin. The potatoes were of remarkable size and
*:::: while a dish of French beans, which graced the end of
the table, may be pronounced, something very rare, for there were
not more than ten d; these verdant luxuries. By way of tit-bit in the
centre, or more properly speaking, centre-bit, was a patty of veal and
served up sub vel-am-ine, or under a cover.
The second course consisted of a delicious riz-au-lait of Patna Rice,
with the appropriate motto, “Risum teneatis, amici,” worked in beet-
root round the edge of it.
The Dessert consisted of a pine-clad pottle of strawberries, one of
which was snapped at by Toby, who, hearing the word hautboy pro-
nounced, mistook it for “Hof boy!” and clutched the fruity morsel.
We had almost forgotten to say that the wines were also of truly
British manufacture; and that the beers included the choicest ginger,
as well as the strongest double X.
After the Toast, Toby favoured the º with “The Bonny Bark”
in six sharps, and at this moment the lighting of the gas-light in the
court below produced an effect which the distinguished visitors went
to the window to admire. º; this incident tea was served by an
officer of the Native Tea-poys under a slight discharge of gun-powder
and canister; after which the illustrious guests descended to the street,
MR. DUNUP’ whistling “Such a getting down Stairs,” and escorting
them to one of the innumerable busses that had been provided for their
—and the general—convenience.

. It used to be said that the Battle of the Constitution is to be fought
in the Registration Courts, but it is now quite certain that the Battle of
the Shrievalty of London is to be fought in the Registration Paletots.
NicoLL, who has long professed to clothe even a Falstaff with elegance,
and would cheerfully, register the tonnage of that ton of man in a
registered over-coat, has been elected Sheriff of the first city in the
world. Happily for those who live in fear of the officers of the
Sheriff, they may now go and enter an appearance for £115s. at the house
of the Sheriff himself, by endorsing themselves in one of his registered
wrappers. Who need fear the utmost rigour of the law, when its most
formidable officer devotes himself to no other kind of rigour, than
rigging out those who come to him, with “cash down,” for an over-
coat? To those who are in hot water, the aqua-scutum of the Sheriff
will prove an inestimable blessing.
There is some Pleasure in being in Parliament.
SIBTHORP says, “A Member of Parliament has three pleasures, in
making a speech. First of all, the pleasure of making it; secondly
the pleasure of reading it; and thirdly, the pleasure of being abuse
for it afterwards.” . We should say that the last is a pleasure that our
friend the Colonel is rarely disappointed in.
MR. PUNCH is instructed to offer to Public Competition, a Prime
Assortment of Damaged Goods, the Stock in Trade of MR. B. bisºrii,
M. P., whose recent Parliamentary Failure, in connection with the
State of the Nation, has created, such universal excitement. These
Articles, having been smashed by the CHANGELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER,
are now to be peremptorily disposed of as Broken-Up Materials, which
Noblemen and Gentlemen will find quite capable of being worked up
again into Speeches adapted to the meridian of Protectionist meetings.
The following are among the principal Bargains :—A Miscellaneous
Collection of Facts in º of the distress of the Nation, only a little

worthy the attention of Interested Parties. A Mass of Rubbish con-
sisting of Figures, admirably calculated to mystify the uninformed. A
String of Non-Sequiturs, connecting Irish Misery and Commercial
Depression in England with FreeTrade; warranted to pass for
argument with Country Gentlemen. A Large Quantity of Clap-trap,
somewhat the worse for wear, but which may always be depended upon
to draw down the Applause of the unsophisticated. The Facts, Figures,

An enormous amount of humiliation seems to have come down upon
the devoted heads of various individuals now about town, for such an
assemblage of “shocking bad hats” has never been seen since the day
when the cry of “What a shocking bad hat!” was ringing in the ears
of nearly every one of us... The present race of hats is so utterly
uncouth, that we really wish for even that enormous instrument of
| Eastern despotism—a Hatti Scheriff—to be enforced against those
roused by a
hats for the purpose of putting them down in a summary manner. -
We are inclined to believe that almost every one of these hats could
tell a tale about its wearer, and that castor-ology would be a science no
less, interesting than phrenology, if we were to take the trouble to
study it. The odious affair known vulgarly as the Wide-awake speaks
loudly of slang and snobbishness, while there are others in the varietyli
of hats which must be felt to be understood, and which really are felt
when you look into them. The Gibus hat speaks
of the elasticity of youth, and is a type of the
buoyancy with which the crushed heart resumes its
former shape, and springs as it were to life when
ressure from within; but there are
other hats which, utterly without map, seem to
speak of the total absence of rest for the head within
- A few years ago England thrust its head
into gossamer, a proof of light-headedness which was scarcely creditable
to our natural good sense, but perhaps, our recent rush into velvet
betrays a softness in the upper story, which is scarcely more to our
credit. We would not be considered captious, but we certainly think
the heads of the people were never more open to criticism on the score
of hats than at the present moment.
PROTECTION FOR EVERYBODY.
... Eye RYBody, seemingly, is crying out for Protection. The Protec-
tionists demandit, and SIR CHARLes NAPIER is calling for Protection
for the British Navy. Then there is Protection for the Colonies, which
England, if she is a fº. parent, ought certainly to grant, for every
good mother is bound to do the best for her children.
To listen to all these cries for Protection, one would imagine that
everyone was in, the most unprotected state. You would fancy
everybody was attacking his neighbour, and that nothing was safe,
:*::::::: and the Bank. Our simple advice is, “Let everyone
protect. himself”. Why, look at us... Our columns are pilfered in
every direction. Our jºke. are stolen by the dozen, and yet do we cry
out for “Protection?” No! Rogers's was not broken by the
loss of a paltry £10,000. We only laugh at the robbery, and go on
circulating more jokes. Depend upon it, the best Protection in the
world is for everybody to do his best. Perfectionisits own Protection.

GRAND ELECTION FOR THE PREMIERSHIP OF
ENGLAND.
THIs Election, which had excited a deal of interest amongst all
parties, came off by * in the House of Commons, on Monday
evening, the 2nd of July.
The proceedings were opened by MR. Disraru. He said, “He had
great.pleasure in º to propose a dear friend of his to fill the
situation of Premier of England. He had known him from his earliest
childhood, and the acquaintance, which had been keptupnow.for a º:
series of years, without a moment's interruption, *: ripened, he woul
say, into love. He would not weary the Assembly with a catalogue
raisonné of all his talents and virtues. They were known to all the
world, and had endeared him to everybody—but this he would boldly
state, that he knew no man better qualified to fill the present vacancy
than his honourable friend. (Cries ºf “Name/ Name”). Without
further preface, then, he begged to propose for the Premiership of
England his dear friend, MR BENJAMIN DISRAEL, a gentleman for
whom he had always entertained the very highest respect.”
A great confusion here ensued, amidst loud cries of “Don’t you wish
you may get it?” and other elegant interrogatories generally put to
candidates at elections, when, -
The SPEAKER, upon obtaining silence, took the liberty to observe that
no one had seconded the Nomination.
MR. Disraeli rose again, and said, “that it gave him the greatest
pleasure to second the Nomination of the honourable gentleman above
named-a gentleman, the longer he had known him the more he had
oved him—agentleman—” -
Here the noise was so great, that it was impossible to understanda
single word of the honourable gentleman's speech. He spoke for several
º but not a person seemed to be sensible of what he was saying.
At last a
MR. Roppugr, who had been very prominent in the opposition, came
forward to be informed if there was not some slight mistake?
MR. Disraeli said, “No mistake whatever.”
MR. Rºugº. “Then, if I understand you rightly, you seriously
propose MR. BENJAMIN DISRAELI as the fittest and most qualified
person to sit in the House as Premier.”
R. DisBAELI. “Precisely.”
This announcement was received with the loudest laughter, and the
House broke up.
Second Evening’s ELECTION.
The proceedings commenced amidst the greatest hilarity, by Loan
John Russell, demanding a poll. -
MR. DisBAELI had to express his astonishment at the noble Lord
taking him in this way by surprise. -
Loºp John was no less astonished when the honourable gentleman
had had a whole week to canvass the House. He certainly should not
give way.
A scrutiny was demanded, and the SPEAKER declared the state of the
poll to be as follows:–
Wotes for Lond John Russell - . 296
Votes for BENJAMINDIsraeli - . . 156
Majority for Lord JoHN . . 140
Thus terminated this extraordinary Election, the result of which had
been long anticipated by everybody, and against, which there has been
one universal outcry, viz., that it could not possibly have been productive
: any good, and has only been the cause of the greatestinterruption to
usiness.
MR. Disraeli has not been heard of since.

It has been recommended over and over

fear, under that very acute sort of deafness,
to which those who won't hear are liable.
The ear-trumpets of Punch are known to be

The globe at BURFORD's Panorama

At present, there is Europe on the

What is railroad travelling com-

ascend twenty steps, and ho! presto high-cockolorum-jig, you are 5676
feet above the level of the sea; in less than two minutes you have
jumped from Leicester Square to the highest point of Mont Righi. A
comet could not have done it quicker.
Look down upon that monster twelfth-cake, of which the snow forms

There is one great comfort about the Panorama. However, much
the continent may be closed by revolutions against travelling, Leicester

hat and red feathers, popping at him behind a road-cross in the name

shilling in his pocket.
We will now run up stairs and stroll through the “Walley of Cash
mere.” You may well exclaim “How lovely!”. Do you not long for a
horse to scamper over the beautiful country? Would it not be even a
delightful place for picnics, and for regattas, and water-parties! If
anything, there is rather too much water, and the place has a slight
touch of the ague. We imagine the natives must move about with cork-
belts, for every other street is a canal, and the children must swim .#
before they know how to walk. By the way, we are inclined to thin
that a Cashmere washes, for the one before us appears to be soaking in
one immense tub of water. -
Do you notice the river—it is our school friend, Hydaspes—how it is
covered with floating gardens P These are made of weeds, firmly
matted together, over which is thrown manure and soil. Flowers,
ſruit, cucumbers, the lovely nelumbium and the curious sinhara—in
fact, all the delicacies of the season—grow to great luxuriance on these
swimming flower-beds. We have a great mind to try something of
the sort, by º: one of DR. ARNOTT's aquatic mattresses with
sunflowers and a gooseberry-bush, and sending it adrift on the river.
Cashmere is in rather a torn and tattered state at present. The Sikhs
have been playing (we cannot help it) Sikhs and sevens with it lately.
Nature, however, will not be conquered, and the valley can still validate
its claim of being one of the most beautiful spots in the world. How

us hope these poor misguided people will soon see the error of their

CONGRATULATORY ODE TO THE FRENCH ON THEIR
TRIUMPH AT ROME.
BRAVE citizens of France, proclaim a fºe,
For you have laid the Roman Eagle low;
With pomp and pageant, therefore, celebrate
Your glorious triumph o'er a stronger foe;
Stronger in cause—injustice and in right-
A vast advantage; but availing not
When match'd against the more substantial might
Of rifle-bullet, rocket, shell, and shot.
By patriotic ardour long repell’d,
our warlike banner still ye dared advance;
Numbers and skill alone your hopes upheld,
Yet victory has º the brow of France;
You should exult, then, o'er the prostrate Free;
Yes, ye should glory o'er the vanquish'd Brave,
As might the victors at º:
Have held their orgies on the Spartans' grave.
Oh valiant OUDINot! Courageous band,
In whom Rome's awful walls awoke no dread-
Those walls by Freedom's living warriors mann'd,
And watch'd by spirits of the mighty dead—
Honour to you, ye brave! From sire to son
Your fame to latest ages handed down,
Divide the glory of the Goth and Hun;
Share ALARIC’s and ATTILA’s renown.
Come, sing aloud the Marseillaise with glee,
For tyranny by Frenchmen’s aid restored;
Raiseye the strain, “Mourir pour la patrie,
On having smitten patriots with the sword:
Come, ye sincere republicans of France,
Come forth, whilst crackers bounce and cannons boom,
Around your Trees of Liberty to dance,
And trample on the liberty of Rome.

HE WON'T BE BEAT.
SoME people are fond of having the last word, but DR. REID, the
great ventilator, will assuredly not be satisfied unless he can have the
last blow. He has actually petitioned the House of Commons in favour
ºf his system. We cannot wonder at the coolness of agentleman who
lives in such afrosty world as DR. REID has chosen to make “a world
of his own;” but the idea of petitioning the very assembly, against
which he has been dealing his “heavy blows and great discouragements”
for the last two or threeº and soliciting the sufferers from the
system to sanction its re-adoption, is really preposterous. DR. REID's
yentilation has been so frequently denounced by Members of the
mmons, that, unless they have learned from him how to blow hot
and ºld, they cannot turn round and give it their patronage. We
should be delighted to give DR. Reſo a fair chance, but we cannot
stand tamely by and see the British Legislature deliberately blown to
shivers by his windy processes. ,
MR. DISRAELI'S GREAT FEATURE.
“THE great feature of the day,” says MR. DisBAEL, “is perplexity
and inability.”, Really, if we had been asked for a definition of the long
speech, of which the above forms a part, upon the State of the Nation,
we doubt if we could have said anything better than
“The great feature of Ms. Disaaru's speech is perplexity and inability.”
We scarcely know, in fact, which abounds most.
The great remedy for the above state of things is, “Elect MR.DIsraer.I
Prime Minister;” such a remedy, we are y afraid, would only
increase the “perplexity,” and establish stillmore clearly the “inability,”
of the honourable gentleman, who so modestly proposes himself as
Premier of England.
... By thºby, if anyone had questionedusas to what was MR. Disraeſa's
great feature,” we certainly should say, looking at the result of all
his divisions, “Decidedly the Noes;” it is prominent in everythingto
which he has given his countenance.

THE CRY OF THE STATION CLERKS.
We have often º the fate of the unfortunate Station. Clerk,
doomed to fill up the intervals between the arrivals of the different
trains, by starting off in a train of thought, or to amuse his leisure by
listening to the porter's account of luggage and parcels to be forwarded
mº º of Porter's Statistics which must be remarkably devoid of
Interest.
For the Station Clerk the only excitement is the arrivaland departure
of the up and down train—the only phase, by the way, of the ups and
downs of life with which he has an opportunity of becoming familiar.
From year's end to year's end he must be at his post, with nºthing to
vary his dull routine, unless a collision happens to §. a little life to
the scene, by causing the death of afew passengers. metimes hemay
be allowed a little bit of garden where he grows some halfpeck of peas
in the course of the year, until some rude engine, rushing off the rails,
crushes the tender plant with its rude tender.
The Hermit of Vauxhall is a joyous reveller compared with the
Railway Station Clerk, in some remote places on a line (like some of
those on the South Easterm, for example) where the traveller never
stops, and whose names are almost unknown to the most acute of
fº. There is a victim at Pluckley, and another at Eden-
idge, whose seclusion is only interrupted by the shriek of the whistle,
and the useless stoppage of the train to put down an ideal passenger,
who never alights, or to take up some phantom wayfarer, who never
makes his appearance.
We have heard a great deal about the horrors of the Solitary System
as applied to criminals, but how much worse is it to visit such a system
upon the innocent Railway Station Clerks! To add to the miseries of
their condition, they have no respite from that fate, but are compelled
to remain perpetually at their posts without a holiday.
An effort is being made to obtain for them this boon, and we, who are
strong adherents of the maxim that “All work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy,” having also an inherent hatred of dulness, shall be glad to
lend our aid to the oppressed Station Clerks in their very reasonable
demand for a holiday.

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
ON LOVE, MARRIAGE, MEN, AND WOMEN.
it was at the Peace
of Amiens, when
with several other
young bucks I was
making the grand
tour, "I recollect
how sweet we all
of us were upon the
lovely DUCHEss of
MontePULCIANo at
Naples, who to be
sure, was, not nig-
gardly of her smiles
in return. There
came a man amongst
us, however, from
London, a very
handsome young
fellow, with such an
air of fascinating
melancholy in his
looks, ... that he cut
out all the other
suitors of , the
Duchess in the course of a week, and would have married her very likely,
but that war was declared while this youth was still hankering about his
Princess, and he was sent off to Verdun, whence he did not emerge for
twelve years, and until he was as fat as a porpoise, and the Duchess
. long since married to GENERAL Count , one of the Emperor's
eroes.
I mention poor TIBBITs to show the curious difference of manner
which exists among us; and which, though not visible to foreigners, is
instantly understood by English people. Brave, clever, tall, slim, dark,
and sentimental looking, he passed muster in a foreign saloon, and as I
must own to you, cut us §. out: whereas we English knew in-
stantly that the man was not well bred, by a thousand little signs, not
to be understood by the foreigner. In his early youth, for instance, he
had been cruelly deprived of his h’s by his parents, and though he tried
to replace them in after life, they were no more natural than a glass
eye, but stared at you as it were in a ghastly manner out of the conver-
sation, and pained you by their horrid intrusions. Not acquainted with
these refinements of our language, foreigners did not understand what
TIBBITs’ errors were, and doubtless thought it was from envy that we
conspired to slight the poor fellow.
I mention MR. TIBBIts, because he was handsome, clever, honest, and
brave, and in almost all respects our superior; and yet laboured under
disadvantages of manner which unfitted him for certain society. It is
not TIBBITs the man, it is not TIBBITs, the citizen, of whom I would
wish to speak lightly; his morals, his º his courage, his generosity,
his talents are undoubted—it is the social TIBBlts of whom I speak;
and as I do not go to balls, because I do not dance, or to meetings of
the Political Economy Club,"or other learned associations, because taste
and education have not fitted me for the pursuits for which other persons
are adapted, so TIBBITs’ sphere is not in drawing-rooms, where the h,
and other points of etiquette are rigorously maintained.
I say thus much because one or two people have taken some remarks
of mine in ill part, and hinted that I am a Tory in disguise: and an
aristocrat that should be hung up to a lamp-post. Not so, dear Bob ;
—there is nothing like the truth, about whomsoever it may be. I mean
no more disrespect towards any fellow-man by saying that he is not
what is called in Society well-bred, than by stating that he is not tall or
short, or that he cannot dance, or that he does not know Hebrew, or
whatever the case may be. I mean that if a man works with a pickaxe
or shovel all day, his hands will be harder than those of a lady of fashion,
and that his opinion about MADAME SONTAG's singing, or the last new
novel, will not probably be of much value. And though I own my con-
viction that there are some animals which frisk .*. in ladies’
... whilst others pull stoutly at the plough, I do not most
certainly mean to reflect upon a horse for not being a lap-dog, or see
that he has any cause to be ashamed that he is other than a horse.
d, in a word, and as you are what is called a gentleman yourself, I
hope that Mºjo, BRowN, whoever she may be, is not only by nature
but by education a gentlewoman. No man ought ever to be calle
upon to blush for his wife. I see good men rush into marriage with
ladies of whom they are afterwards ashamed; and in the same manner
charming women linked to partners, whose vulgarity, they try to screen.
Poor MRs. BotLBOL, what a constant hypocrisy your life is, and how you
ONG years ago, indeed
insist upon informing everybody that BoIIBoL is the best of men!
|Poor JACK, JINKINs|what a female is that you brought back from Bag-
|Higge. Wells to introduce to London, society', a handsome, tawdry,
| flaunting, watering-place belle; a boarding-house beauty: tremendous in
brazen ornaments and cheap finery.
If you marry, dear Bob, I hope MRs. Robert B. will be a lady not
| very much above or below your own station.
I would sooner that you should promote your wife than that she
should advance you. And though every man can point you out in-
stances where his friends have been married to ladies of superior rank,
who have accepted their new position with perfect e, and made
their husbands entirely happy; as there are examples of maid servants
decorating coronets, and sempstresses presiding worthily over Baronial
Halls; yet I hope MRs. Robert BRow N will not come out of a palace
or a kitchen; but out of a house something like yours, out of a family
| ...i.F. with a ºfºº something like that modest
portion which I dare say you will inherit.

the firm of STUMPY, Rowdy & Co, of Lombard Street, Bankers,) married
|LADY CLEOPATRA; what a grand match it was thought by the Rowdy
|family: and how old Mrs. Rowdy in Portman Square, was elated at
the idea of her son's new connexion. Her daughters were to go to all
the parties in London; and her house was to be filled with the very
| greatest of great folks....We heard of nothing but dear LADY STONE-
HENGE from morning till †. and the old frequenters of the house
| were perfectly pestered with stories of dear LADY ZENOBIA and dear
|LADY CORNELIA, and of the dear Marquis, whose masterly translation
of ºliº Nepos had placed him among the most learned of our
| mobility.
When Rowpy went to live in May Fair, what a wretched house it
was into which he introduced such of his friends as were thought
| worthy of presentation to his new society. The rooms were filled with
|young dan ies of the STONEHENGE connexion—beardless bucks from
| Downing Street, gay º sprigs of the Guards—their sisters and
| mothers, their kith and kin. They overdrew their accounts at Rowdy's
Bank, and laughed at him in his drawing-room; they made their bets and
talked their dandy talk over his claret, at which the poor fellow sate quite
silent. LADY STONEHENGE invaded his "...; appointed and cashiered
his governess and children's maids; established her apothecary in
permanencel over him: quarrelled with old Mrs. Rowdy, so that the
#. old body was only allowed to see her grandchildren by stealth, and
we secret interviews with them in the garden of Berkeley Square;
made Rowdy take villas at Tunbridge, which she filled with her own
family; massacred her daughter's visiting-book, in the which LADY
CLEOPATRA, a good-natured woman, at first admitted some of her hus-
band's relatives and acquaintance; and carried him abroad upon excur-
sions, in which all he had to do was to settle the bills with the courier.
And she went so far as to order him to change his side of the house
and his politics, and adopt those of LoRD STONEHENGE, which were of
the age of the fruids, his lordship's ancestors :--but here the honest
British merchant made a stand and conquered his mother-in-law, who
would have smothered him the other day for voting for Rothschild.
If it were not for the Counting House in the morning and the House
of Commons at night, what would become of Rowpy? They say he
smokes there, and #.s when he smokes. He has been known to go
to Vauxhall, and has even been seen, with a comforter over his nose,
listening to Sam Hall at the Cider Čellars. Aſ this misery and mis-
fortune came to the poor fellow for º; out of his degree. The
clerks at Lombard Street laugh when LoRD Misletoe steps out of his
cab and walks into the bank-parlour; and Rowdy's private account
ºl, tells tales of the visit of his young scapegrace of a brother-
In-law.
A Little Nut for the Alarmists.
THERE is one comfort if the French ever do bombard London, as
they have done Rome, they cannot do much injury to our public
buildings. The National Gallery, for instance...let it be battered evº,
solmuch, could only be improved, and the “finest, site in Europe”
might have some claim to its title after the rubbish which has been
allowed to accumulate there in the name of the Fine Arts, had been
swept away by a few friendly, shells. Our statues would be equally
protected from injury. In fact, we doubt if there is a capital in the
world so strongly fortified in the above respects as London.
TO ASCERTAIN THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
TAKE a pair of Compasses and the Supplement, to the Times, and
measure with the former the list of “Marriages” in the latter. An
average of from sixty to eighty lines of “Marriages” may be relied upon
as an indication of .# As the resources of the country expand,
matrimony is contracted, and that portion of the Times elongates; as,
for all that MR. DisRAELI may say of our desperate state, we are very
happy to remark that it has been doing lately.

BAKINGS CAREFULLY ATTENDED TO IN ALL
COURTS OF LAW.
We have all heard of Chabent, the great Fire-King, who used to
wash his hands in boiling oil and take a foot-bath in molten lead. He
could sit on the hob .#. the kettle was boiling for tea, and would
take his own pie to the baker's, and remain in the oven with it all the
time, in order to see that nothing was taken out of it. MR. BRIEF-
LEss—our BRIEFLEss—everybody's BRIEFLEss—for not to know
BRIEFLEss argues yourself unknown—has been fired with the same
emulation, and is determined to put out Chabert and his little bit of
fire. He is about to undertake a feat that will hand his name down to
after-generations on a hot plate. . He has announced his intention of
going into the Criminal, or any Law Court, with a leg of mutton and
potatoes, and not to come out till they are done deliciously to a
turn.
We are aware that BRIEFLess adorns everything he touches; and
we sincerely hope, for his sake, that in this instance the potatoes will
be done as completely brown as his warmest wishes could desire; but
still we have our fears that he will never return alive to tell us of the
dangers he has run in shutting himself up in one of our dread legal
ovens. . Should he succeed, we hope he will not forget to invite us, hi
dear friend Punch, to the dinner, so that we may congratulate him over
a cup of that Sack which we are positive will be one day the family seat
of the BRIEFLEsses, upon his extraordinary good luck in having pulled
his leg so skilfully out of the fire.
PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY JOKING.
Sever AL Irish members surrounded MR. Roebuck as he was passing
through the lobby the other evening, and, after scuffling with him for a
few minutes, succeeded in .."; round his neck. The
Honourable Member quite unconscious that he was carrying anything
about him, entered the House and took his seat amidst the loudest
laughter from the Hibernian benches. He turned round to inquire
into the cause, when there was discovered upon his back a copy,
written in large characters, of the inscription borrowed from. Copper-
field, of “MIND, HE BITEs.” The offensive placard was i.
Ouse.
We understand, that later in the evening, the same placard was
humorously tendered by SIR. Robert PEEL to MR. Dish AELI, but,
with great mock politeness, that even made MR. PLUMPTRE laugh, was
declined by the talented representative of the Unstable Mind.

THE UNREASONABLENESS OF SCIENCE.
An individual named CHARLEs CAMERox, a chemist, has put an
advertisement in the Times, addressed to the Subscribers to the Royal
º: . ...'. º: votes at their next election,
on the 30th Instant, an to Non-Subseribers, requesting pecuniary
assistance; for every five shillings, on the day of election would, he
says, secure him five votes. The claim of this MR. CAMERos to the
consideration of the benevolent rests principally on the circumstance
that “he was the first who discovered and made public that splendid
light which has long been employed at the Polytechnic for displaying
the minute wonders of creation by the ue microscope, to the
gratification and mental improvement of nº. A mighty pretty
title this to national gratitude! The idea of any body tº: to be
rewarded for discovering a new light, or contributing in any way to the
enlightenment of his countrymen!
o have the slightest reasonable expectation of a decent annuity, a
man ought to have cut an army to pieces; or destroyed a fleet; or
burnt an arsenal; or at least blown up a bridge. Not any mischief in
the world has MR. CAMERON done, and yet here he comes forward to
ask for remuneration. What do we, the British public, care about
science or those who cultivate it? what good does it do"us to know
anyt about the minute wonders of creation? Talk of the gratifica-
tion and mental improvement of millions ! The misery and destruction
of millions would have been a better recommendation for MR. CAMERoN.
But, as he is now in the seventy-fourth year of his age, and for the
last two years has been in extreme distress, from having lost the use
9f his right arm; whilst, since the gold medal of the Society of Arts has
been twice awarded to him, there can be no doubt of his scientific
merits; it is very probable that some weak-minded persons may be
dis d to succour him, and, we reluctantly pander to the morbid
susceptibility of such people by stating that, any contribution for that
purpºse may be sent to Joseph CLINToN RoBERTson, Esq., Editor of
the Mechanics' §º 166, Fleet Street, before the 30th inst.
Considering the of estimation in which science and scientific men
are generally held among us, we do not wonder that Mr. CAMERoN has I
been for three years an unsuccessful applicant for the bounty of the
Annuity Society; and now that he has once more applied for it we can
only say we wish he may get it.

SANITARY AND PRISON DISCIPLINE.
We feel called upon to direct public attention to a notable project,
which has been devised by certain enlightened persons, for improving
the health of HER MAJESTY's subjects.
It is proposed to found in the principal town of each county in Great
Britain and Ireland a model Hospital, for the reception of all manner of
patients indiscriminately, no matter whether the diseases they are
troubled with are slight or serious. -
. No attempt will be made to draw invidious distinctions between the
inmates of these Hospitals by establishing separate wards for persons
affected with fevers, or other dangerous and infectious disorders.
Tribunals and Officers of Health shall be created by Parliament, and
commissioned to send to the Hospitals of their respective districts any
person or persons convicted of la ºf under any kind or form of
malady, for a time proportionate to the gravity of their respective
disorders. At the expiration of such term each patient is to be dis-
charged, cured or not c
Through these arrangements vast numbers of youths, of from seven
to fourteen years of age, having colds in the head and stomach-aches,
will be placed, for the removal of these *...* in contact with people
lying ill of Typhus and Small-pox, for periods of from seven days to a
month and upwards, at the end of which they will be restored to
Society, , wherewith it is presumed, they will be then, qualified to
; by the salubrity of the atmosphere they will have been
Ingº.
It ºlived that this plan will operate as effectually for the miti-
tion of disease, as that of sending urchins guilty of petty larceny to
erd with felons and assassins has answ or the diminution of
crline.
Legal Darkness.
We read in the Daily News, that “the Courts of Law at Halifax
were adjourned in consequence of the darkness.” The delays in our
Courts of Law, may arise probably from a similar cause. For instance,
the darkness that reigns in the Court of Chancery is so impenetrable,
that, when once a case is taken into the precincts of it, it is impossible
to get through it; the darkness in the Palace Court is no less obscure,
for it is well known that every defendant who attempts to move in it
is sure to be instantly floored.

admire it in all its wonder-
ful details, you should cross
the Channel; the effect upon

like it for increasing the
distance—and you will no
longer believe it was the
same cold, colourless, flat
thing you were in the habit
of studying in your arm-chair
at home. It must in all
humility be confessed that
the French Stage abounds
with historical incidents,
which cannot be found any-
where in HUME or Swollett, or MARTINEAu, or MAcAulay. We
strongly advise the latter, if he is at all anxious to collect_new facts, to
reside in the Boulevard du Crime for six months. , Half a year's
simple course of the Parisian theatres will yield him more rich
material than if he were to hunt all his life, through every musty
authority that was put upon the record in the British Museum.
Continuation would continue to be even more amusing than it is.
The following incident in the life of CHARLEs THE SEconD may
perhaps serve as a fair sample of the immense mine of wealth, that at
F. lies buried in that unexplored field of our national manners and
customs.
The subject is Les Beautés de la Cour, recently produced at the Vaude-
ville theatre. The heroine is an orange-girl, who, of course is NELL
wyNN; the gentleman who is flirting with her, is, strange to say—
for French authors are not always so accurate—Charles the Second.
They are in, a public-house, where they are, joined by a mob of
Qyster-girls, fishwomen, and other ladies who follow the timerant pro-
fession of crying sprats, flowers, and periwinkles. There are also a
ike scene-painting
looke
few gypsies, but the gypsies are no more real than the oyster-girls, or
the ladies who sell the sprats, violets, or fried soles. They are all
disguised. Their real profession is nothing more than to be, the
prettiest women of the reign of CHARLEs THE SEconD, copies of whom
the reader has doubtlessly seen at Hampton Court, or in MR. PLANCHE's
* pretty picture of a Lyceum piece “The Court Beauties.”
he Duchess of PortsMoUTH has an organ round her neck, and
that handsome woman with the can of hot potatoes is the Countess of
GRAMMONT.
The Duchess and Countess, and the whole fishy and vegetable tribe
of Beauties, have come to cut out “NELLY ;” CHARLEs flirtation
is interrupted... He only tightens his Garter, and loves his beautiful
orange-girl all the more.
As for NELLY when she learns that her cherished life-guardsman is
the King, she does not love him a bit the less, but warbles a couplet to
the tune of “God save the King,” and sells her oranges just as before,
for two a penny.
But in the Second Act she has lost her basket. She is living in the
palace in the capacity of Maid of Honour. The Queen does not like it
at all, but NELLY assures her she has no reason to be jealous. The
King annoys her. There is a dreadful scene in the throne room; the
Queen rushes to the rescue of the poor orange-girl. NELLY claims her
protection. “Ah, what do I see?”, exclaims NELLY, “can it be
possible f Yes! No ! Yes! It is ’’ and there is a grand discovery—not
of a mother nor of an old aunt, nor even of a foster-sister, nor is there
an examination of arms nor the usual recognition of strawberries, nor
any of the old conventional discoveries that have possessed the stage
ever since Scribe and SAPPHo have written for it, but simply this:–
NELLY discovers in the Queen an anonymous old woman, who, three
º º gave her sufficient money to buya stock of playbills, and started
er in life with her first cargo of “apples, oranges, and ginger-beer.”
NELLY has not forgotten so much kindness. She rob the Queen of
her husband—never ! The King is smartly told to “Go and remember,
&c.; ” whilst the grateful orange girl marries a French seigneur, who has
een following her through the palace all this while, without a single
person asking him “what might be the nature of his business?”
CHARLEs is fairly lost in astonishment, and so are we, and if
MacAULAY does not avail himself of the new source of information we
have pointed out to his notice, we shall decidedly say that as an
historian he is not at all equal to Rapin.

THE NATIONAL HAPPY FAMILY.
. THE wonderful results of intellectual, and moral supremacy over
inferior natures is strikingly exemplified in the harmony amid an-
tagonism displayed in that curious and well-known collection, the
Family, which is gratuitously exhibited from morning to night
Mr. join BULL to all, Europe, and the World. It is curious
to see how peacefully in this odd assemblage, the old French fox with
his cubs can lie down with the little terrier, a native of the same
country, called BLANC, when there used to exist such enmity between
them ; and on what excellent terms are the Austrian .# and the
Polish rats and mice. A pair of furious Mountain bulls, named Rollin
and Boichot, have lately been added to the collection, and some
Italian greyhounds are shortly expected by the proprietor.
It is the confident opinion of MR., BULL that the most opposite
tempers may, by his system, be caused to e; so that the Gallic
Cock and the Roman Eagle might in his establishment, be brought to
billing, if not to cooing, and the Russian Bear to embrace his com-
panions with a fraternal, hug. This interesting illustration of the
#. of mind peculiarly human, is exhibited at MR; BULL's shop, and

be an inducement to strangers to come and deal with him.
THE PILGRIM OF LAW. |

within its dreary precincts. It is seldom that Poesy weaves her

The eyes of the Lawyer shone bright through his glasses,

(The reason is obvious. The poor child has his mouth full of green

HALF A WORD ABOUT A BIT OF IRELAND.
As the thoughtful reader of this admirable miscellany has, no doubt,
made up his mind, if not his carpet-bag, to attend the QUEEN to Ire-
land, he will-providing that his money hold out—assuredly proceed to
Killarney. Haply the aforesaid thoughtful reader may desire to travel
strength of the Dublin station; light as web and strong as adamant.
A few miles, and upon the left is a magnificent specimen of the Round
Towers of Ireland. Of the use and purpose of the Round Towers there
have been a hundred theories; none convincing. Punch—it was to be
expected—has at once hit the mark. Hear the truth:—
The Round Towers of Ireland, grandly developing the national
character even in the dawn of time, by combining public beauty with
º: utility, were neither altars, nor towers, nor monuments, but
Money-Boxes For THE PEOPLE! The slit—or we should rather say
the traces or ruins of the slit—through which the Celt dropt his gold
and silver savings (before the pickpocket Saxon made saving impos-
sible), with a good pair of spectacles is clearly discernible. The Round
Towers may henceforth be received as imperishable monuments not
only of the money power of Ireland, but of the forethought, the perse-
verance, and the frugality of the Celt. The Saxon may boast of his
Bank of England, but º: a lath-and-plaster thing of to-day is the
Bank of ABRAHAM New AND to the Round Towers, the stone
Savings' Banks of Kng MALACHI: They loom from out the dimness
of antiquity,+the guardian granite L. S.D. of prosperous Erin.
On we speed through Tipperary. Beautiful fields; though—is it the
sun –there is a strange ...; upon the changing corn. “Thurles!”
And, foolish SMITH O'BRIEN stands face to face with the Detective.
Well, the repealer has lost the e, and—it is idle to whimper-he
must pay the stakes. Nevertheless, there is a little bird in Phoenix
Park, a bird that sings of pardon. And why not?...What danger in
a repeal cap now; ºn opinion hangs it about with bells? Now,
“forgive and forget” should be the three harmonious words echoing
and re-echoing from the two countries.
“Mallow !” Steam baulks beggary; but here you are—most
thoughtful traveller—here with the curse and shame of Ireland before
and around you. The English beggar—even the vagabond who trades
upon infirmities and sores—is a fellow of self-respect, a tradesman
decent in his filth, compared with the Irish tatterdemalion. The
English outcast would draw himself apart—would not suffer the Irish
mendicant to come between him and his Saxon beggary.
The car is surrounded by the sons and daughters of generations of
beggars. You can trace the descent in their blighted, stunted forms—
in their brassy, cunning, brutalised features. Very ancient is their
enealogy, could we but come at it. These are of the original caste;
rn to beg and—such their duty upon earth—to begetbeggars. Aduty
they zealously perform; flourishing like the º in dirt; for they
abhor the Union; and—we had it on good Irish authority—will not eat
Indian meal if inflicted with the penalty of º These are the born
beggars; born to live and die begging. They shock and disgust. But
the victims of the potato—that root of Irish evil—the strong man,
with suffering cut in his face, but with no petition on his tongue—the
man whose broken spirit stares from his eyes, with hope crushed out
of him, these are met at every furlong of the way, and make-or
should make—“the condition of Ireland”—a sacred question, to be
pondered on with fear and trembling. -- -
Away we jolt; for the rail has not yet stretched out its iron hands,
clutching Killarney close to Mallow-away we jolt, with time to look
at the wayside. What horrid huts! What human degradation, where
man can with cheerfulness—a contentment that debases-dwell, and
die between such walls of dirt. What monuments of national misery
to national idleness! The swallows of Brobdigmag would hardly nestle
with a harmonising companion—a genial friend. All the better; the in such places. Surely they are better and more self-respective builders
desire does honour to him; but is nevertheless to be enjoyed with cool of mud.
judgment—wise caution. There are many qualities required in a com-
panion of the road; but this we take to be the really golden one how long? The Greek hyacinth has, it is ſancie
whereby to choose a travelling friend. Let him have a sweetness of
temper that no accident of way or weather can curdle—but let him,
above all, go forth with a blank cheque. The mere thought of it makes
all things so bright and smooth, and gives a delicious confidence in the
chimney-corners of your inn. The cheque may, perhaps, never be
wanted; it is about ten to two it comes back a virgin strip, and about
five hundred to one, it does not. The enlargement of mind acquired by
travel, is apt to confound all monetary calculation. Many a prudent
fellow, º: his gold for a trip, is assured that he carries from home
more than money enough to wander, regardless of expense, together
with funds sufficient to buy gowns or trinkets—as the *. may be—
for his wife and all his daughters. With this sustaining thought he
crosses the threshold. , Mark his return. His portmanteau, it may be,
contains one pin-cushion—two cockle-shells biting a bit of cotton
yelvet—for the § { girl. He tenderly embraces the partner of
his bosom, and blandly begs her to send out the fare (two shillings) to
the cabman at the door. -
Enough. Quitting this humiliating weakness of our common nature,
let us at once take the road. As many thousands of the London
Saxon will, in a week or so, proceed to behold their ferocious faces
reflected in the dark waters—and never was water so solemnly black–
of the Lakes of Killarney, we propose to gossip a little by the way, bene-
volently anticipating the pleasures of the traveller.
You leave Dublin-(we shall be with HER MAJESTY at the proper
season)—with a surprised admiration of the combined elegance and
romising! And for
lack marks, forming
an exclamation of sorrow, AI, AI. Could we only read the future lm.
the present healthy leaves of the growing potato, for all their seeming
unscathed wholesomeness, we might decipher another and another
national tragedy; or at least the continuance of a poverty and debase:
ment º the dignity of human nature, is far worse than the final
ceasing of a nation. Better, thought Punch, to cease to be, than to
look for house, and home, and raiment, and all the domestic"creature
comforts that elevate the man above the ape, better at once to
end with earth, and begin with the Future, than to trust to one
treacherous bulb as to all-sufficing manna. Read by the light of this
thought, we might con a prophecy of the future agonies of Ireland,
even in the full untouched leaves of the present crop. But we must
hope better. As in Egypt onions and leeks are no longer wº
for tutelary divinities—so must the Irish peasant, as to the god of his
household, no longer kneel to the potato. Straightway he must learn
a better faith: we must convert him to wheat. -
With wheat may come better field habits. The potato-let us enjoy
the theory—infects with idleness. “Mark an Irishman at work in the
field,” says the Irish Bishop BERRELEY. “If a coach, or a horseman go

Punch; who has seen as much of geese-(and is proud to own his
obligation to them,) as most people.
Well, we are now at Killarney Lakes; and have forgotten the misery
the squalor, the brutish degradation of man in the solemn and etern
loveliness of nature. The thought of want and beggary, with all the
“perilous stuff” that weighs about the heart of the traveller by the
way, is at once buried in the waters—and we take new hope before the
thrones of mountains.
Supper—Bed º: at the best of hostelries, the Victoria
Arms, where MRs. FINN rules her guests as an affectionate, matron
rules her family; knowing what is best for them, and doing her best
with the best of hearts.” Punch feels this to be a º very
vapid acknowledgment—of the motherly care that filled the daily basket
for the daily boat; filled it with such a fine anticipation of the wants of
agentleman addicted to a delicate dinner and half a glass of wine. But
there are memories that will last with life; and the salmon eaten at
Glena is one of them. Salmon, cut in slivers and spitted upon skewers
of the arbutus that impart a flavour, smacking of the garden, of Eden;
whereof the gardens of Glena, in our fallen condition, may be enjoyed
as the beautiful shadow.
The Lakes of Killarney!, Now, simple reader, do you imagine that
we are about to attempt to describe these? We should as soon think
of attempting to º: pressure—all the three Lakes into
our ink-bottle. Neither will we try to put the mountains into print.
We will simply record it as our faith, that under the same space of
heaven reposes not more beauty of earth and water than sleeps upon
the hills and smiles in the waters of Killarney. But, sir, of course you
will go-go and judge for yourself.
We shall say nothing of Innisfallen; we are "...Tº is
always º: to speak)—by the sense of its loveliness...And the
same with Toomies and with the Eagle's Nest, a rock nearly thrice the
height of St. Paul's, and like St. Paul's to be seen outside for nothing;
and like St. Paul's containing an organ of the most exquisite music, if
there be, a musician to awaken it. For Eagle's Nest, the Lake
Cathedral, there is PROFEssop, John SPH LANR, bugle-man; also
“guide, philosopher, and friend:” (and in sooth the fast two titles have
been many a time less merited by their bearers.) SPILLANE plays ad-
mirable rock music. He blows, and the sounds are returned from the
very centre of the rock, as º vibrating along its adamantine veins;
as though endowed with life and voice, it harmonised and, sympathised
with the listener. And now it, seems as though the bugle notes were
taken up by a fairy orchestra that prolonged the flourish; refining it,
now letting it drop, now taking it up again, till it dies away in silvery
whisperings.
But-Punch is not a Guide to the Lakes. There are whole books
for this service. For instance, the traveller may take MRs, S.C. HALL
under his arm; and that lady will, with feminine grace and truthfulness,
tell all that may be told. Punch can only dealin bits of general advice.
One especial bit is to eat salmon—arbutus-skewered—at Glena, under
the matronly auspices of MRs. MACDowALL-salmon tenderly cooked
by dark-haired KATHLEEN, or blue-eyed Peggy, as the case may be.
Lord KENMARE (may his lordship's appetite never fail him!) ºi.
a pretty, roomy cottage for the entertainment of visitors; a sort of
Utopian inn, with house-room gratis. We wish a few of our Irish
Members would pass the vacation there. Not for the salmon, but for
the sound, sense of Widow MacDowall, who knows more of the real
gº º Ireland, and talks better about them, than many a Mimber of
- nºteonents.
The F. seen, you will mount pony for Mangerton. Now, although
some of the Irish ponies wear five shoes, that is, four on the feet and
one in the º for the most part as surely as º shod
with silver from the tof England; and how that goes, we have all
daily experience. Mangerton is the grand gathering-place for the most
º beggars. . There, the Norahs, with black eyes and white
teeth levelled *. blank at human weakness, would knock the most
careful political economist into sixpences. Therefore, to be saving,
travel with threepemies. To be sure you can only obtain them at the
Bank at £25 worth at a time. All the better; for if you attempt
Mangerton, you will need not one threepenny less. And then the money
is begged for such a cause, you cannot refuseit. NorAm intends to go
to America for a husband; she won’t marry in Ireland—too much
misery for a poor girl. She only wants the money to ship herself; and
thus, the piece of silver you drop at Mangerton may come up part of a
wedding-ring in New Orleans.
Mangerton.“done,” you return to your inn. And taking the advice
ºf yºur monitor Punch, you hear the great piper, GANDsby, play upon
the Irish bagpipes. Noble music! ondrously human and pathetic,
and never to be confounded with that case of incurable flatulence, the
bagpipes of Scotland, GANDsey is almost the last of the Irish pipers.
We hope there is yet time to continue the race: for the music of
Ireland, as evoked by the master we listened to, should be as enduring
as her Lakes and Mountains. It has been said, that “the pipes are
delicious or abominable—just according to the skill of the hand that
rules them.” The same may be said of the violin. We should not
like to be doomed to listen to a learner upon even PAGANINI's fiddle;
but what is, said of the Irish pipe may, we take it, be said of the
Irishman,—he is good or bad, according to the master-hand that rules
him. Well, we have had discord—abominable music—more than
enough; May we henceforth have the music of peace—the harmony of
brotherhood! With this wish, end we for the present,
THE HEAD AND FRONT AND BACK OF THEIR
OFFENDING.
HE propensity that
gentlemen of the
present day seem to
cherish for going
downwards is most
extraordinary. The
latest proof of this
affection for things
beneath them is
brin ºf up to the
† of their intel-
lects the wide-awake
hat; so called “wide-
awake,” we believe,
from the fact of its
having no nap. We
admit the hideous-
mess of the present
chapeak; we are
painfully, sensible
that it is neither
ornamentalnor com-
fortable; and, in
windy weather, not even useful; but still gentlemen should not forget
that they are gentlemen, and really should be above running their heads
into things that do not belong to them. If they keep going down lower
and lower in this way, we shall have to tear off the smock-frock of the
Carter, or to throw aside the fantail of the Dustman, before we find
concealed underneath the noble semblance of a gentleman. Your real
gentleman never disguises himself, for he is naturally too proud to
assume anything that does not belong to him.
THE POST IN THE SUBURBS.
OFFICIALs gay, attend the lay,
That I mean to sing forthwith:
My tale shall be 'twixt you and me,
And the Post at Hammersmith.
From Cornwall Road, where he abode,
The lover, young Dickson, wrote;
'Twas Monday noon—at least as soon-
When the youth despatch'd his note.
“Write by return—accept or spurn—
Let me know, at least, my doom;
End my suspense, or I ºil rush hence,
To forget thee in the tomb!”
ANNETTE's reply, from Peckham Rye,
Was as instant as the light, .
It owned her flame, but, alasi it came
Not until the Thursday night.
*Ere then, a grave in Thames's wave
Had the desperate Dickson found,
Were’t not that he by a bargee
Was got out 'ere wholly drown'd.
MoRAL
This story shows, and don't suppose
'Tis a mere romance or myth-
What ills may flow from a Post so slow
As it is at ersmith.
CREDAT JUDAEus.
It is rumoured that the opposition of the Lords inst any, Jew
entering Parliament is based on the very low ground...that their beau-
tiful House would be spoiled by the introduction of Mosaic.

HINTS FOR HOME COLONISATION.
THE question of what are we
...do with our criminals is
daily increasing in interest, and
as our old colonies indignantly
exclaim against a continuance
of the convict system as applied
to them, we look with dismay
at our transported culprits, and
ask what are we to do with
them? Ruminating on this
knotty, point, . we suddenly
thought of Leicester Square,
that metropolitan desert, which
is evidently abandoned to any
Civic Cook or Cockney Colum-
BUs, who may choose to ex-
plore and take possession of it.
We earnestly recommend the Colonial Office to get the British flag regularly planted on that soil,
from which all the paving flags have been unceremoniously removed, and by possession being taken of
the tract of land in the Queen's name, the place would at once be rendered available as a penal colony.
At all events, the experiment might as well be tried, with a view to ascertaining whether there is any
lawful owner of the place, who of course would come forward in the event of our plan being followed.
If another RoPINson CRusoe were to arise, he would find himself thoroughly at home in, the
enclosure of Leicester Square, for he might be undisputed "monarch of all he surveyed” without
having even the district surveyor down upon him for a fee or gratuity. , MB,CHARLEs PEARSON has
asked for a farm of a few thousand acres to set 500 criminals to work, with the view of reforming
them...Our contemporary, the Times, suggests the curtailment of the acreage to a few hundreds, and the
reduction of the number of criminals to 100, so that the experiment may be tried without risking a
ailure, on a very extensive scale; but we would go farther in the way of limitation, and would
suggest the gultivation of Leicester Square by one culprit, whom we would designate, the knave of
spades, and if the scheme succeeded, it would be easy to carry it out on a more extensive basis.

A SERIOUS LAUGHING
MATTER.
WE have heard a great deal about
the serious state of France, but serious
or not, the Parisians seem determined
to laugh, and if they cannot laugh on
one side of their mouths, they laugh
all the louder on the other. They
have their Journal pour Rire, and their
Assemblée Nationale pour Rire, for in
casting our eye down the reports of
the proceedings, we find no other effect
produced by the speakers than Rires
and Nouveaux Rires, varied by Hilarité,
Hilaritéprolongée,and Nouvelle Hilarité.
It is true that a very little ;
goes a very long way in the 'Nation
Assembly, which in this respect, is full
worthy of the title of aristocrat, for
we all know that to be a “wit among
lords,” requires the very smallest a.
mount of facetious capital. As a spe-
cimen of the amount of humour that is
required to set the French Legislative
Body off into a fit of Hilarité pro-
longée, we may cite the following mot
of one M. LACLAUDURE, who, for the
simple observation, Le GENERAL CA.
vaign Ac, est, le fils de son père, was
rewarded with a most unanimous burst
of merriment.
The whole French Nation seems
ready to be set upon the grin by the
merest trifle-a sensitiveness that may
arise, from the ticklish condition in
which it has been recently placed, or

º the tendency to laughter in its present, distressed state may
ave something of an hysterical character. hatever may be the
cause, there is no doubt of the effect, which is a promptitude to turn
everything into ridicule. Amidst, all the subjects that are just now &
fire in France, the République à rire is the object of the most universal
banter; the theatres are all empty, but two or three, which can only
collect audiences by satirising the Republic, and subjecting it to the
most inveterate quizzing, as in Les Produits de la République at the
*. º, and the third number of 7. Foire avºid* at the
auclewllie. -
THE FRENCH IMMIGRATION.
Consider ING the number of ideas that we are continually taking from
the French, it is only fair that they should occasionally borrow an idea
from us, which . are now doing regularly once a week, by following
the º example of excursionising between London and Paris. An
affair of the kind has been got up under the title of Une Semaine à
Londres, with the addition of Voyage de Lure, by way of expletive. The
French notion of English luge is rather comprehensive than select,
for it includes Le fameur diner de Greenwich, avec ses 14 entrées de
poissons, et ses wins d'Espagne, with free admission to les Bazaars,
including, of course, the Lowther, and les Spectacles trois fois. #.
semaine, though lefameuz Surry is the only spectacle expressly specified.
.The voyageurs are also J. the enormous treat of a gratuitous
visit to la célèbre maison de Somerset—Somerset House—where we trust
the various officials will endeavour to get up something in the shape of
an entertainment to prevent disappointment to the French excursionists.
In the department of stamps and taxes a sort of exhibition of the stamp-
ing machinery might be arranged, but in other respects, we fear the
célèbre maison de Somerset will present very little attraction to theforeign
visitors. It is a well known fact that Londoners seldom see half the beau-
ties of their own city, and we confess there are º of interest
advertised in the prospectus of the Woyage de Luze which we, as cockneys
de sangpur, have never had the goodfortune to meet with. Among these
we may instance la St. John Church, of which we are acquainted with
several, including St. John's Wapping, and St. John's Clerkenwell, but
this.St.John Church par ercellence, has altogether escaped us hitherto.
The same º that has got up these Excursions from Paris, has
been invitingus Londoners to their own capital by a promise of succulent
ſ: arrosé de rhum, dale, de thé, et de sherry—a hodge-podge which
is no dºubt, regarded in France as irresistible by an English appetite,
Fancy indulging in succulent rosbeaff...washed down with rum, ale, tea,
and sherry. He must be a very Qthello in his jealousy of the viands of
his country who can truly say he has “stomach for them all.”

over Blackfriars Bridge, and in fact, all the bridges, evidently terrified
out of their lives at the immense amount of artillery FIELD MARSHAL
JULLIEN has brought into the field. -

rumoured that the monkeys felt the shock very severely. A Blue-nosed
baboon died this morning, and #: the instruments of the heaviest

their full metal we tremble in advance to know. We hope the glass
cage for the reptiles is perfectly sound. As a proof of the fear that
reigns everywhere, we may mention that every sparrow has emigrated
from the Gardens.
WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US?
To the Editor of every Newspaper in the Kingdom.
SIR,-I cannot sleep when I think of the
defenceless state of the River Thames!
What have we to prevent the French
taking London Bridge, and running of
with the Chinese Pagoda in Kew
Gardens? Nothing but a Daisy, and a
miserable. Buttercup or two, long since
past the flower of their youth.
Shall I tell you, Sir, what is the state
of the French navy? Why they have
no less than four steamers...on, their
magnificent river Seine! Mind you
each of these steamers is accustomed
to hardwork. Ihave seen them aground
for five hours at a time off St. Cloud.
A more bumptious crew I never met
with: why, I have watched them under
a shower of rain, when not a man of
them has hurried down below, or even
left the deck for a minute to fetch an umbrella. -
But what do we find on our decks? A Captain and an Engine Boy!
Iquestioned one of the latter, and send youhisanswers:-
Q: What do you carry on board, my little boy?” ...
A. “Ginger-beer, Soda-water, and penny Pickwicks, Sir.”
% “What is your present complement, my fine fellow?”
. “Go to Bath and get your headshawed.” - -
Gracious goodness! Sir; my blood boils when Ithink on this state of
things. We be carried out of our beds an º of the week; and
all we have to depend upon, is a little bit of a Bridegroom, that is loaded
with ginger-beer, and manned by a chit of a boy, who, when you ask
for information, directs you to proceed to Bath, for the insane purpose
of ſº your head shaved! - - -
ut is there any hope for us if we venture into the engine-rooms?
“Here,” thºught , “ #. is any fire left in the British Navy, here
I shall find it.” It is true, I found º of fire, but it was not in the
bosoms of the men, Itried to stir them up into something like a glow.
I even took the poker, but it made no impression upon them; I plied the
shovel, and trimmed them and the furnace alternately, going into them
both like hammer and tongs; but will you believe it, Sir, the men onl
looked coldly on, and never moved an inch, excepting to ask me “if
was going to stand anything.” -
... I am no alarmist, and I wish to terrify no one, but I can only say
if these things are allowed to continue—if the Thames Navy remains
in its present lack-a-Daisycal state—that we must see the Seine fleet
sailing past Tilbury Fort, and we shall all be sleeping next Christmas
Eve, if not before, in the rat-infested dungeons of Vincennes! If what

A CASE DESERVING OF SYMPATHY.
We witnessed an awful death in the columns of a newspaper the
other day. It was the death of a poor fly. He had ventured too near
one of those Italian fly-catchers, and had got fastened on the sheet of
yellow glutinous matter that looks so unpleasant. He seemed to be in
3.;º and no wonder, for the newspaper in º was the
Sºnºrd. We hastened to release him, but it was toolate! We found
him dead, stuckfast on the thirdline of a leader, having been evidently
unable to proceed any further. What the sufferings of that poor
fly, must have been no mortal, man can tell! What makes, this case
still more melancholy, is, that hundreds of other flies had shared his
untimely fate. The †: all the way down was strewed with the
remains of poor deluded flies who had fallen victims in, the insane
struggle of getting through it. Further details are too horrible for
publication,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 33
THE LONDON CORRESPONDENT.
(Written for “The Talking Potato.")
; Y DEAR MURPHY,-The impetus
of improved locomotion has
awakened a corresponding de-
sire in the breasts of the reading
public of the Irish and provin-
cial press to have their news
hot and hot from London—hot
and buttered with their morn-
ing rolls. The “London Corre-
spondent,” my dear MURPHY,
is a new potentate—a novel
ower—in the kingdom of the
K. It is for him to whip off
the cream of all things, and
churn it into little pats, im-
pressing thereon now a goose
and now a lion—now a rose
and now a thistle. He must, however, be always original—always
sparkling... Truth is very well in her way; but in our advanced state
of civilisation, not presentable until properly drest. Neither, in our
day, must Truth eschew the rouge-pot and ornaments of the purest
paste. You will see, my honoured MURPHY, that I fully understand
the object of my mission to this great city—that I am all over alive to
the weight and value of your parting words: you may forget them; I
never can. “One injunction, . dear O'Swiss, you must write upon
your heart: must wear it as a phylactery about your brows: it is this—
Be spicy / Mere news is common j. What we want of you as a
correspondent is rather an exercise of the imagination, than of the
memory. Unflavoured truths are insipid. We don't want to feed the
reader upon dull, daily household bread, but on gingerbread-nuts.
Therefore, and in a word, be spicy, or die.”
These, my venerated MURPhy, were your last verbal instructions as
we stood upon the deck of the Shamrock ; and with them still singing
in my ears and ºft upon my heartstrings, I descended to the cabin.
Having calmed myself with some cold sirloin, and a trifle of punch, I
thought I felt myself equal to contemplate the written orders that—
with the letter for the weekly pecunia to your London agent—your
parting shake consigned to my hand. I now write them from memory
—from memory, most excellent MURPHY.
“I. To dine, at least once a week, with the Prime Minister or
President of the Council—or both.
“II. To be º: at Court.
“III. To cultivate an acquaintance with the DUKE of WELLINGTON,
and to pump F. M. upon all occasions.
“IV. To make a weekly call at the Foreign Office, and to worm
IoRD, PALMERStoN. N. B. Never to be absent from any of her
lº, soirées.
“W. To secure the loan of the QUEEN’s Box at the Opera once a
fortnight; and to have it duly ºn; in the Morning Post, that "HER
MAJESTY's Box was occupied by—O'Swiss, Esq., and a distinguished
party of his private friends.”
“VI. To attend weddings in very high life; and—as a friend of the
family—when permitted—to give away the bride.
VII. To be civil—not familiar—with the Bench of Bishops.
“WIII. To give a dinner once a year to the Lord MAYoR and Cor-
poration of London at the Clarendon.
‘....IX. To cut the Protectionists as a body; but, as a brother of the
quill, to extend the little finger of friendship to BENJAMIN DISRAELI.
: X. To belong to all the Clubs.
“XI. To disregard any one or all of the foregoing, when found
practically impossible.
“XII. On all and every occasion to consider it a solemn duty to—
be spicy.”
These, Sir, were your written instructions; and I know the wisdom
enshrined in them; for, once achieved, it makes the paragon, of that
novel and important creature, a London Correspondent. Well, Sir, I
have endeavoured to comply with each and all of your twelve injunc-
tions: and if I have failed in any one of them, depend upon it, estimable
MR. MURPHY, the readers of The Talking Potato shalſ never discover
it., Sir, in this life, the next best ğ. to successful courage is
indomitable assurance. A man may ſail to dine with the Prime
Minister—to be presented at Court—to earwig the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON ; he may fail in one or all of these proud distinctions of life;
but he must be an ass, indeed, if—with a tongue in his head or a pen
in his hand—he permits an envious world to find the failure out. And
now, Sir, to enter upon my duties—now to give you in the very best man-
ner of a fondon Correspondent who is ubiquitous and all-knowing—(last
week a London Correspondent was found under the table at Øsborne
House during the holding of a Privy Council;-the gallant fellow is
WT iſ
gence of all matters, bearing upon or about the visit of Qures
VICTORIA to the brightest gem in her crown, the Island Emerald.
[From our London Correspondent.]
ALL England threatens to decanter itself into Ireland on the occasion
of HER MAJESTY's visit. My friend, LoRp Russell.—(by the way he
has a very pretty Lodge in Richmond Park, and it is pleasant to see
the Premier of England and his little ones feeding the fallow-deer with
almond-cakes at early, dawn)—my friend JoHN, in confidence, assures
me that the QUEEN will take water at Kew-bridge, and not at Osborne,
as recklessly asserted by the ignorant portion of the press. A new
barge will be launched upon the occasion, to be rowed by the Lords of
the Admiralty, and steered—an especial favour granted at his own re-
quest—by LoRD BRough AM. The royal yacht will sail from Woolwich,
and will not be commanded—as was believed—by LoRD JoHN RUSSELL.
The state visit of HER MAJESTY to Ireland is reserved for next year.
On the present occasion she will be merely attended by the Household
Guards (transports are already provided) and PRINCE ALBERT's Own.
lt has been very generally reported that the Lumber Troop would be
ld regiments. On Thursday last over the burgundy, I just touched
upon the report to the DUKE ; when, with his characteristic acuteness,
the DUKE observed—“Gammon; pass the wine.” This your readers
may depend upon. ... (By the way, what a felicitous epithet—it was an
Irishman's—“the Iron Duke!”. The bewitched maiden uttered pearls
and diamonds: F. M.. the Duke invariably speaks tenpenny nails.').
HER MAJESTY's visit—(I have the best proofs from the royal milliner)
—will be homely and unpretending. §. will leave the crown and
sceptre in the Tower, and land in a plain straw bonnet with a green
arasol. On landing at Cork, HER MAJESTY-(I have it from her
aster of the Horse)—will at once enter into the nationality of her
Irish subjects. She will not make the round of the city in a carriage,
car, duly balanced on the other by Maids of Honour. -
Blarney, and secured a piece of the stone to be set among the brightest
jewels of her diadem, she will sleep on board the yacht; the Mayor
and Corporation of Cork, as a guard of honour, # g the middle
watch. All HER MAJESTY's dress will be of Irish, manufacture;
Irish poplin; bonnet of Irish straw, with artificial-blossoms of the
national fruit. I should observe—(1 have this from SHEIL of the Mint)
—that the QUEEN will embark amidst a shower of golden sovereigns.
HER MAJESTY's entry into Dublin will be alike simple and maternal.
(There has been arumour of a great tea-party with a dance in the evening
at Conciliation Hall: but don't believe it. The DUCHEss of S-
assures me that the idea is abandoned.) The QUEEN, as at Cork,
will have been ennobled, immediately after
HULLABALOO, and the Aldermen created baronets. She will then, on
her way to Viceregal Lodge (LORD CLARENDON, in a tunic of green
silk taffetry, is to ride a milk-white horse, illustrative of his pure inten-
PRINCE ALFRED the DUKE of LIFFEY. This ceremonial will be per-
distilled for the occasion. Without further delay the QUEEN' will then
F. to the Lodge, where she will be met at the door by the
oUNTEss of CLARENDON with a dish of buttermilk and potatoes.
Upon this the QUEEN will lunch ; and afterwards, in a thimble-full of
regal punch, drink Prosperity to Ireland. Then, with as little ceremony
as she arrived, HER MAJESTY will depart, and on her return F. to
the Bank; where—(the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER has passed
me his word for this)—where she will, lodge twenty pounds to the
account of every single inhabitant of Ireland, and thirty to the married,
with an extra two pounds a head for children. This fact, you will confess,
1S §. : but certainly not a whit more than was generally expected.
n leaving the Bank, HER MAJEsty will visit Trinity College, when
herself, PRINCE ALBERT, and all the children, will receive diplomas as
Doctors of Civil Irish Law; LoRD RUssell, as Prime Minister, being
honoured with the dignity of M.A. and §6%. --
significant and most touching goodness. T - -
Third will cease to exist; that is, an entirely new face will be given
to the old bronze mischief-maker. The head of the Orangeman
(every preparation has been made to perform the process in a few
minutes) will be struck off, and in its place a bronze head of His
Roy AL HIGHNEss PRINCE ALBERT, bearing his Hussar, cap, will be
soldered on; the band playing “ And doth not a meeting like this make
amends P’ with the bells i. and the artillery roaring. -
At night there will be a glorious illumination throughout the city.
Not a garret window that will not have an eye of fire twinkling in it.
A magnificent illumination in which—forgive my ardour, Sir-in which,
let us hope, every atom of ill-feeling between the two countries may be
burnt to snuff. Luckily I have no more to say, for I’m interrupted.
The DUKE has driven up with his carpet-bag, and insists upon me going
down for a day or two to Walmer.

Dom ESTIC HYDROPATHY.
= , ~i=–-
HYDRoPATHY is making its way, and the continual dropping of water on to the mind of the public is
at last producing some impression. Wateris in fact taking a very high position, but its elevation will not
be of long continuance, for it is in the very nature of water to find sooner or later its level. At the pre-
sent moment, hydropathy is being received as a science of the first water, and it has been allowed to find
its way into several domestic establishments. The turncock is in fact the family physician, the cistern
is the medicine chest; the New River is a sort of Apothecaries' Hall, and the doctor's billcomes in, in the
shape of the water rate. This is all very agreeable if it is kept within bounds, and we believe that not
only are water and soap the best soporific, but that the ordinary suds form a sudorific of as salubrious
a kind as any that can be furnished by pharmacy. It is not the use of water, but its abuse we protest
against, and we therefore object to the substitution of the bath itself for the Bath chair, as well as to
the watering of the patient with the watering pot while lying in his bed, as if he were a geranium, or
any other, occupant of an ordinary flower-bed. Such is the outdoor treatment under the Domestic
Hydropathic system, which occasionally places the patient under the pump, until it is doubtful whether
he is not as great a pump as the machine by which he allows himself to be played upon.
“DOWN, DOWN, DERRY DOWN.”
MINISTERs have at last hit on the plan to make Englishmen zealous financial reformers. Hume and
Cobden, and the Liverpool Financial Reform Association, might have laboured for centuries without
getting half as near their object as LoRD John and his colleagues have managed to do in the last twelve
months. It is very kind of them to take such pains to rouse a real feeling for saving amongst us–
to open John Bull's ears to the cry of “Take care of your pockets,”—to prompt a demand for economy
in administration so serious and urgent, that they will have a good excuse for obeying it. You don’t
suppose Lorp John and LoRD GREY and the rest are really like pelicans, and take a serious pleasure in
feeding their large brood out of their own blood, i.e. the country's circulating medium ! On the contrary,
they only want a good reason for saying to those excellent family men, who seem always at home in the
Home Office, and never abroad in the Foreign Office, “My dear fellow, we haven’t a decent place to our
backs, or agentlemanlike salary in our portfolios. Everything is to be done in the cheap style, and the
country no longer appreciates the advantage of having its work done inaslovenly and gentlemanly manner
by men of family. W. positively have nothing to give that doesn’t require a man of business to do the
work, and doesn’t give a miserable salary for doing it. There isn’t a clerk in the Foreign Office who
can’t knock off a precis, or run up a diplomatic correspondence, and who receives more than half Lombard
...; º, How can we offer anything of this paltry, hard-working, ill-paid style of thing to one of
ourselves:
This is obviously what Ministers want to be at. It must be so. For just look what they’re doing.
Imprimis, They’re cutting down everybody’s little pickings out of other people's pockets.
They’ve robbed the landlords of protection. Let them look to their own salaries
They’ve robbed the ship-owners of the monopoly of water carriage and extra freights. Let them look
to their Foreign and Colonial Office appointments!
They’ve abolished the Palace Court. Let them look to their patent places and legal sinecures'
They’re going to knock up the Sessions Bars and the Sessions Attormies. Let them look for a swarm
of hornets with stinging pens, who, driven from the carcase of petty larceny, must live, and will find a
living (interalia) by exposing the abuses among their exposers!
They’ve cut off Junior briefs in Assize Prosecutions and reduced the fees of the ex-leaders. Let them
look to their Treasury, and Mint solicitorships and snug little legal berths at home and abroad
They’ve roused the landlords!. They’ve raised the ship-owners' | They’ve frenzied the attornies!!!
They’ve irritated the barristers!!!!
And do they hope to survive themselves, remainder abuses, solitary sinecures, fossil inutilities, idle
to be the game? With Shylock the
irritated “interests” may hiss out to
Ministers, “If you be like us in all
else, you shall be like us in that. The
economy you teach us we will execute,
and it shall go hard but we will better
the instruction.”

(After Cowper.)
Toºl, for a knave!
A knave whose day is o'er'ſ
All sunk—with those who gave
Their cash, till they’d no more!
Shareholders grumbled loud,
Directors wroth did get-
Down went the Royal GeoRGE,
With all his lines, complete!
Toll for the knavel
The Royal GeoRGE is gone;
His last account is cook'd;
His work of doing, done!
It was not in the panic,
His credit felt no shock;
The House at Albert Gate
Stood firm as Albert Rock.
Clerks still drew bated breath,
And moved obedient pen,
When the Royal George went down
Never to float again.
Cast the tottle up,
See how the money goes:
And reckon, railway pup-
-pets, how much Fººd owes.
The Royal GeoRGE is gone,
His iron rule is o'er—
And he and his Directors
Shall break the lines no more!
THE PUN NEGATIVE.
A PUNSTER quite old enough to
know better, but too old to warrant
the hope that he will not get worse,
has intimated to us the horrible sus-
º that the present Pope is called
10 No-No in allusion to his probable
refusal to say yes to any conditions that
may be proposed to him. The vener-
able wag who has insulted us by this
suggestion has had the audacity to
add, that, even if Pio No-Noshould sa
“Yes, yes,” the joke (!) would still hold,
for No-no might then be construed as
the double negative, which is equal to
one affirmative. We can only say at
present, that we have it in contem-
plation to place the whole of the
documents connected with this affair
in the hands of the Lunacy Commis-
sioners, with the view to an inquiry as
to the state of mind of the venerable
wag, who has for some time evinced
the same alarming symptoms that have
at last urged us to this extreme mea-
sure. We wish some benevolent indi-
viduals wouldfound asortof Agapunnery
on the principle of the Agapemone, re-
cently before the public, and we shall
be happy to pay any reasonable sum
of money for the reception of the
venerable wag into such an estab-
º: of office? No, Fvery abuse they destroy, every vested interest they trample down, every
O il nuisance they cut away, they lº life anew and sudden swarm of financial purists. The reformers

PUNCHPS FREE ADMISSION TO THE SURREY
ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
THE programme of JULLIEN’s “Concert Monstre”
may be divided into three parts:—lst, Rain;
2.d, Mud; 3rd, Noise. -
The first part was rather overdone. A little
rain would have been ºf but JULLIEN
laid it on rather too heavily. hat there was,
however, was of the very best description. We
felt it to the very bottom of our soles. The
running accompaniments, as they trickled slowly
down our collar off the edge of some gentleman's
'umbrella, were particularly thrilling. There was
one shower especially, evidently led on by SMART,
that came down with the most wonderful pre-
cision on the heads of the multitude,-so much so
that we are positive every one must have felt
it through and through. Some of the most
flowing movements filled our ears, almost to an
aching sense of pleasure, with such an overpowering gush of soft
melody and rain, that we fairly shook and trembled under the powerful
effect. Never has our head been so full at a concert before | Our
Mackintosh, even to this day, is still absorbed by it. . . -
Whilst this part of the concert was being executed, it was curious to
watch the orchestra. Talk of the voices having been drowned by the
instruments, whv, they could not have been half so drowned as the latter
were, for the rain trickled into the violins, as if they were only so many
yials, and it filled the bassoons to that extent that every now and then
BAUMANN had to hold up his cherished instrument, and give it a good
wringing to get the water out of it. Those “monsters of the deep,”
the ophicleides, spouted away, as if they had been suddenly turned into
whales, and sent up large columns of water that threatened to take
all the colour out of ºil. and even to send adrift the Coldstream.
The Second Part was necessarily a little slow; but when you are
ankle-deep in Mud it is impossible to get on very fast. What mud there
was, cºrtainly was very good as far as it went, and that is saying a
great deal, for it went all over the gardens; but as it was decidedly in
everybody's way, we should advise Jullie N to have the mud removed
for his next concert, ſor it was the only portion of his entertainment
that appeared to “stick.’ at all. All the rest, especially the third part,
which consisted entirely of noise, went off like an 8 pounder; in fact
much better, for, owing to the rain having damped the ardour of the
cannons, some of those “sons of guns” would not go off at all.
In other respects the noise redounds and rebounds, for the echoes, we
believe, are still keeping it up on the Surrey hills, most loudly to
JULLIEN’s credit. #. 24 Roman trumpets came out with great force,
and we wonder the walls of Badajoz did not fall flat into the water at
the first brazen clang. These Roman trumpets look like immense gas-
pipes with a funnel at the end, and would make capital peashooters for
a masquerade.
Altogether the noise was such as we have never listened to before.
If it is a sample of what is occasionally heard in the “l)esert,” we
do not wonder at so very few people living in that noisy neighbourhood.
The Camel must be deaf as well as dumb, or else he could not stand it.
By the way, it was singular to notice the long caravan after caravan
of Umbrellas, whilst the “Desert” was unrolling its slow length along.
What would not old crusty SAHARA have given for a few drops of that
rain, and have joyfully taken the mud with it, with which we were
so liberally deluged on last Friday !
We are sorry for poor JULLIEN. His fºe always seems fo be a
pelting Shower. It is most unfortunate for him that one of the elements
of success for out-of-door amusements does not happen to be water, or
else he would invariably have a bumper every time. His entertain-
ments are always mixed with the very best spirit, and it is too bad that
they should be completely swamped with too much water.
As it was, we enjoyed ourselves very much, but we have had a slight
headache and a small touch of rheumatism ever since.

... LONG MAY IT RAIN.
THE penny-a-liners have long been suffering from a dearth of pabulum
for paragraphs, and the old stock had become so thoroughly exhausted,
that the very earliest Gooseberry failed to find favour in an editor's eye,
and the most monstrous of Cabbages was never thrust by any but the
eenest of the greens of the press into a journal's letter-box. A novelty
as, however, at last turned up, or rather come down in the shape of a
shower of Red Rain, which, we are told in a tempenny paragraph, has
lately fallen in Wales, and we have no doubt the penny-a-liners will soon
hear of such a refreshing shower in France, when a couple of pence
more may be squeezed out of it by the addition of a line and a half of
small wit in reference to the “Red Rain being calculated to throw more
cold water on the Red Republicans.” -
If in private life it is true that “it never rains but it pours,” we may
certainly say the same of a sprinkling of paragraphs; and we may anti-
cipate a thorough inundation of the newspapers with Red Rain for the
next twelve months. We may also look forward to the exercise of
Fº ingenuity in the application of the happy idea of lted Rain
to other matters of a cognate character. ... We may expect shortly a
supply of black hail for autumn use, and during the winter months a
fall or two of pea-green snow will be a most effective novelty. The
palagraph trade will, we are sure, experience a healthy, impetus from
this fortunate shower of Red Rain, which will whet the public appetite
for a further supply of such refreshing prodigies.
A Hint that should be Listened to.
WE observe that several causes “are down for hearing” in the
House of Lords. Considering the defective state of the House, which
one would imagine had been built as a Deaf Asylum for the Aristo-
cracy, we do think the wording of the above notice a little ironical.
How desperate must the acoustics of that place be, when it is necessary
to specify the causes that are in want of a “hearing !”
THE GREAT SMOKE QUESTION.
EveRy now and then the legislature finds itself enveloped in smoke,
or, in other words, immersed in a discussion on the subject of chimneys.
During the present session the House of Commons i.
time to time in its eye. And about a week since, there was a debate
rather more full of smoke than usual, for the morning º came out
with two or three columns of that foggy compound. We think it an
admirable idea that smoke producers should be º to turn smoke
consumers; and we hope tº. in any act that may be passed, there will
be a clause to reach those walking nuisances who emit from their
ept smokeſrom
mouths, through the medium of cigars, a most offensive vapour. . Every
street smoker should be compelled to consume his own smoke; for it is
obvious that a class of persons who evince, so much bad taste cannot
reasonably object to swallow a quantity of smoke, on the ground of the
bad taste that may attach to it. * * * .
“THE BUTCHERS PET.”
MR. Osborn E is the last martyr of Smithfield. Defending the
vested interests of the London.butchers, he laid himself flat upon the
gridiron, to be grilled by public opinion. His speech in the House of
Commons was worthy of the cattle-market; an ox once spoke in the
Forum; aſter centuries, the voice of that animal has been heard in
St. Stephen's. We understand that the butchers intend to invite
the Member for Middlesex to a magnificent festival in Ram Alley,
when—in touching acknowledgment of his advocacy of the claims of
the cattle and pig-market—he will be crowned with a civic crown
composed for the occasion of cowslips, bulrushes, and sowthistle.

POKING FUN AT ROME WITH FRENCH BAYONETS.
A FUNNY fellow, one GENERAL Rostol AN, has been appointed by the

the Roman people a Proclamation which must absolutely make the
Seven Hills of the Eternal City split their sides with laughter. In this
facetious document the principal points—each of which is a regular dig
at Roman liberty—are tº: :-

Here you have a specimen of the action of your patent new French

declaring that the physician, when called up at night, must be marched
to the bed-side by a file of soldiers; he addresses them in the following
exquisite strain of irony:—

The tone of this consolatory assurance is really worthy of a clown in

IDOLATRY AND SUPERSTITION IN ENGLAND IN THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY.
It is humiliating to reflect that in this age of science and intelligence,
and in our own enlightened country, there should have occurred the
following deplorable instance of grovelling superstition and idolatry.
Some four or five years ago, incredible as it may seem, large numbers
of persons of all classes, including even some of the clergy, actually
united to worship a brazen image. They º set up a Man of
Brass, and this precious divinity was adored by the deluded creatures
under the name of the Railway King. It was their belief that he
exercised unlimited power over all railway matters, and could render
any line that he took under his tutelage a source of indefinite emolument
to his votaries. So awfully were they carried away º this persuasion
that they even made a sacrifice in honour of their Idol, at a cost of as
much as £20,000. But this was . to the amount of treasure
which they were constantly º: into
that it would there continually increase and multiply.
The Image had a head, like the celebrated one of FRIAR BACON, en-
dowed with speech, which it seems to have resembled the Pagan oracles
of old in employing for the purpose of º: In process of
time, not only were the golden visions of the idolaters, dispelled, but it
was found that all the money which they had deposited at the shrine ºf
the Idol had disappeared. On awakening to a sense of their lamentable
condition, their preposterous veneration for their brazºn god, was
changed into a proportionately violent º: him. . They
pulled down their idol from its pedestal, they beat it, they kicked it
they bedaubed it and bespattered it, and trampled it in the nire, an
many of them, notwithstanding that they themselves lived in, glass
houses, did not hesitate to pelt it with stones. In short, they conducted
themselves exactly like certain savages, who, when º: in their
desires and expectations, are accustomed to offer sorts of indig-
nities to their gods, before which previously they had Fº them-
selves in the most abject abasement. It is futile to talk of the progress
of education, when we see multitudes capable of becoming the victims
of such a delusion as that which has been exemplified in the worship of
the Railway King.

At the Agricultural Society's Meeting at Norwich, a prize was

PUNCH, OR TIIE LONDON CHARIWAl&I.
PUNCH'S OWN FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.
. By Punch, his own Correspondent.
HAVING been for some time quite abroad among, the accounts sent
ome of , events on the Continent, and puzzled, with paragraphs
about Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark, and the Duchies, with extracts
from Wiener Zietungs, relative to MIERAs.I.Awski's movements, and the
occasional advances of O'SzoNY—a sort of Irish Hungarian probably—
towards this, that, and the other, Mr. Punch determined to go out in
the capacity of his own Correspondent to the disturbed parts of the
Continent. He had offered the task to a trusty contributor, who,
having heard of innocent individuals being constantly popped off at the
hands of the various patriotic popoli, resolutely declared that he would
be shot if he undertook such a dangerous mission.
ºr. Punch accordingly accredited himself, as his own ambassador.
and having invested, himself with the circular order of the Bank of
England, and granted an audience to his own till, to which he extended
the benefits of the clearing system, he took his passage down Bride
Court, towards, the Continent. He was accompanied by Toby, and
Mr. Punch taking, no other luggage than a shirt, Toby was satisfied
with the collar. Tassing over the voyage from England, and omitting
to notice the blustering of BoREAs, who planted one of his heaviest
blows on the very chops of the Channel, Mr. Punch contents himself
with reporting some of the results of his personal observation.
On arriving at a jº point, he looked out for an omnibus to Puszta
Harkaly, where he had heard the brigade of BENEDEK was holding out,
and where Mr. Punch believed the presumed Pus or Puss, in Puszta,
might give a sort of *. to Toby’s activity. He soon arrived at a
spot which Mr. Punch discovered to be Nagy-sgmard, and on demanding
an interview with Q'SzoNY he was collared and captured by two strap-
ping satraps of the Kaiser Somebody, who dragged him before a general,
º |
|Lºſ
whose name ended in ski, and who, to show his relationship to the
Skies, was covered all over with stars, besides having a cloud on his
brow, though he had anything but a º with him. Mr. Punch,
though he had an excellent explanation at his fingers' ends, was unable to |
translate it into the required tongue, and a series of guttural sounds
having been sent forth from the throat of the General, it became
evident that Mr. Punch and his faithful dog were ordered to be shot as
#. by way of upshot. Mr. Punch had already begun, to feel the
l
|
|
fficulty of conveying the reports of the fatal muskets in the character
of his own reporter, when, as the poet says–
Before a file of men,
Poor Punch was on his knees;
Toby sent up a dismal yell,
That floated on the breeze.
So frightful was the sound,
That, pale with abject fear,
The soldiers turn'd upon their heels—
The ground for Punch was clear.
Encouraged by his fortunate escape, Mr. Punch became bold, and
happening to have one of the numbers of his own publication in his

everywhere. More fortunate even than some of the foreign correspond-
ents of the daily press, who merely get invitations, to dine with the
Generals on . sides, and have public galleries placed at their sole
disposal, to write their “copy” in, Mr. Punch found himself honoured
with tickets out of number for “private yiews” of the various fortifi-
cations, and he received an undated order for “himself and friend” to a
º (sentry) box, in the theatre of war all over the continent. He
ad in fact the entrée behind the scenes, and was called to inspect all the
properties about to be introduced into the grand ballet of action that
was the subject of a sort of répétition générale in all the places he visited.

accurate catalogue by throwing together a quantity of consonants-
with a very small sprinkling of vowels—and cutting them up into
words of as many letters as may be convenient. The names of
generals may be obtained by the addition of the syllable kick, as in
JELLAkick, for it is observable that the parties opposing any generals

of this kind, come of naturally enough with more kicks than halfpence.
Unfortunately a jealousy arose in consequence of dog Toby having
*..."; given offence to the dogs of war, and having in fact been
suspected of acting in the dishonourable character of a tale-bearer in
the interest of the enemy. This unpleasant, circumstance having come
to the ears of Mr. Punch, he was unwilling that the queue of Tºby should
be converted into a “queue to fight,” and he accordingly made at once
for the frontier.
SEASIDE INTELLIGENCE.
We have lately received papers from the Coast, and from our stores
of information—which we are justified in regarding as marine stores, in
everything but the waste paper sense of the term—we select the
following.
... GRAYESEND.—This milk and watery sea-port, which stands suspended
like MAHOMET's Tomb, between the arms of Father Thames an
NEPTUNE, is in the full height of its brief season. The last of the
Barons—the laird of NATHAN-remains at his Hall of Banners, sup-
pºrted by his trusty retainer, in virtue of which, he is retained for the
whole of the summer at a liberal salary. In commercial matters there
is little doing, but we heard of a sale, being effected of yesterday's
shrimps at to-day’s prices; perriwinkles being sixpence a mille—id est,
a thousand-dearer at Gravesend than at Billingsgate, it follows that
the exchange is a few pints in favour of the latter.
HERNE BAY-Our latest dates from this locality go back as far as
the end of June, which may be accounted for by #. blockade of high
steamboat fares being still continued. The pier proprietors co-operate
Cºrdially in the blockade, and aid, by prohibition pier dues, the pro-
hibition, prices of the steamboats, while the prohibition fares of the
Squth Eastern Railway do their part in the establishment of the some.
what, contradictory policy of keeping the public literally at Bay, by
keeping everybody away from it.
MARGATE–Our last advices from this place represent the ſº.”
of the bathing-rooms to be moved by the same courteous inclinations—
the constant inclination of the head to every passer-by which has always
distinguished them. The promenading along the Boulevard des Juires
is now at its height, and at the Bazaars of both LEvy and Jolly there
is a charachºristic mixture of Levity and Jollity among the cockney
visitors. The town “crier” has been in full cry lately after the lost
purses and missing poodles of the people, and Margate slippers, though
up at half-a-crown, are down at heel in most cases.
RAMsgATE–This º was a few days ago enlivened by the presence
of royalty, it having been fixed * by the QUEEN of THE BELGIANs
as the point of her embarkation for Ostend in a most unostentatious
manner. The inhabitants, however, would not lose the chance of an
excitement, and a procession was arranged to accompany. HER BELGIAN
MAJESTY down the pier to the steamer. The first thing to be done
was the collection of a crowd, of which a nucleus was soon formed by
a few boys, who were attracted by the turning out of the coast-guard—
a compact cohort of eight—in full uniform. This force was marched
down to the landing-place at an early hour, and at a little after 12 the
royal procession entered the pier gates in the following order:-
A Man on a Horse-supposed to be the Mare of Ramsgate.
AN open on E-HoRSE FLY,
which had been ordered to stand at ease on the nearest stand till it
was wanted, and now occupied by two gentlemen in cocked hats, and
blue coats with embroidered collars, who were supposed to form part
of the suite of HER MAJESTY.
A Shut up Fly, drawn by a pair of poorly caparisoned Horses,
who seemed to feel that their caparisons were odious, and carrying
four ladies, who passed along amid exclamations of “Is one of them
the QUEEN OF THE BELGIANs P”
A YELLow Post-CHAISE witH A PINK Post-Boy]
driving “four insides,” who bowed courteously to, the bystanders in
reply to their doubtless inaudible greeting of “Well, it ain’t much of
a procession, is it?”
The procession was preceded a few yards by a vehicle, drawn by one
apparently rather clever cob, half filled with carpet bags, and inscribed
with the words,
“souTH-EASTERN LUGGAGE VAN.”
A pier policeman led the van on this occasion."
On the alighting of the occupants of the flies, it became clear, by the
respect shown to her, that “the One in Blue,” as the bystanders termed
an exceedingly ladylike and amiable-looking person thus attired, was the
QUEEN OF THE BELGIANS.
A yard and a half of red serge, to prevent the Royal feet from being
moistened by the surge of the ocean, had been provided by the liberality
of the authorities, and the sergeical operation of laying it down havin
been Fº the QUEEN OF THE BELGIANs stepped on board, precede.
by a local Authority in a blue coat and red collar and cuffs, whose ordi-
nary duty is to attend the arrival and departure of the regular steamers.
After the leave-taking ceremonies had been performed, this indivi-
dual exclaimed, “Let go the stern rope ” in a stern voice, and CAPTAIN
SMITHETT having given the order to “Move her ahead,” the QUEEN OF
THE BELGIANs left the harbour in the Vivid, amid cheers from the
lanthorn of the lighthouse, which was occupied by a party of ladies, each
with “a light in her laughing eye,” and three cheers from the iron
crane, which was crowded with youth, after the usual fashion.
The procession of flys was about to return to the regular stand, when
a pier policeman striking up a cry of “Fly not yet!” the driver paused
for the firing of the four guns, which, with an ounce of powder in each,
proceeded to an-ounce the departure of the Royal visitor.
On the first discharge, the horse attempted to go off, and was com-
mencing a series of capers, when, by a prompt º up of the
animal's ears with gloves, pocket handkerchiefs, and old newspapers
iſ collected on the spot, the impatient steed was restored to his usual
tranquillity. - -
It says little for the resources or for the courtesy of the inhabitants
and visitors of the town of Ramsgate, that not one private carriage
could be found to be placed at the service of the QUEEN OF THE
BELGIANs, but that HER MAJESTY was compelled to put herself under
the wing of an ordinary fly in her transit from the railway station to
the steamboat.
With the exception of this brief excitement, Ramsgate goes on,
according to our latest files—including one old file—much as usual.
The lodging-house keepers are always on the active tout, as if tºut ou
rien jī. the result of their activity, and the bathing is in the hands
of six opposition RATCLIFFEs, whose efforts to secure customers turn
the sands into a sort of Ratcliffe Highway during the whole of the
morning, while the screams of inſants calling for mercy in the prºcess
of immersion increase the turmoil of the locality. The German Band
from Baden Bad-en is a very good’un; and at the Marine Library, on the
cliff, there is a general invitation to—
“Dance with me, dance with me,
Under the walnut tree,”
from a young lady, who, if not “a perfect substitute for SONTAG,” is
better than nothing for those who are debarred from the treat of hearing
the illustrious j. successor to the lyric throne, rendered for
a time vacant by the LIND-ish abdication.
The Value of Life.
According to the Morning Post, “the recent_hanging of John
KELLochER cost the Town Council of Perth £1.17 17s. 6d.” JACK
KETCHEs must be scarce in Scotland. If every hanging is to be as
expensive as JoHN KELLochER's, there will soon be a call for the
abolition of capital punishment in that portion of HER MAJESTY's
dominions. The Town Council of Perth will be ruined if they continue
to hang at such a price. They will find it better to adopt the principle
of “Live and let live.”
THE STATE OF THE NATION.
IN answer to public inquiries, we beg to publish the following
bulletin:
“The Nation continues pretty much in the same state. It has passed a quiet Session,
and is as well as can be expected—with the Whigs as Ministers."
(Signed) Purch, M.D.
Doubtful!—Has France, in her triumph at Rome, most completely
disgraced the triumvirs or the triumphers?

many Qars darting under the Bridge at full jº: while the Beholders
cheered and hallooed with all their Might, and a Bell rung, and a Band
of Musique upon the Bridge Pier did play “Love Not.” Good Lack!
how wrapped up the People did seem to be in the Race; and how they
did cry for Blue to go it; and now that it was Red, and then Pink, and

ment changes its quarters engaged men,
family rows ensue, mothers cry out, papas
grumble, Miss pines and loses her health
at Baymouth or Ballinafad—consent is
got at last, Jon Es takes his degree, JEN-
KINS gets his company; Miss SMITH and
Miss O'SHAUGHNEssy become MRs. Jones and MRs. JENKINs.
For the first year it is all very well. MRs. Jones is a great bouncing
handsome creature, lavishly fond of her adored Jones, and caring for no
other company but his. They have a cottage at Bayswater. He walks
her out every evening. He sits and reads the last new novel to her
whilst she works slippers for him, or makes some little tiny caps, and
for—dear JULIA, dear Edward —they are all in all to one another.
Old MRs. SMITH of course comes up from Swansea at the time when
the little caps are put into requisition, and takes possession of the
cottage at Bayswater. MRs. Jones, Senior, calls upon MRs. Edward
Jones's Mamma, and, of course, is desirous to do everything that is
civil to the family of £oward's wife.
MRs. Jones finds in the mother-in-law of her Edward a large woman
with a cotton umbrella, who dines in the middle of the day, and has
her beer, and who calls Mrs. Jones, Mum. What a state they are
in Pocklington Square about this woman! how can they be civil to
her? whom can they ask to meet her ? How the girls, Edward's
-
sisters, go on about her | FANNY says she ought to be shown to the

gh spirits—they come away at the
complained to Edward that he, NAT, could neither see his Mar or
the Gurls, and that the old gent cut up uncommon stiff.
So you see EdwańD Jones has had his way, and got a handsome wife,
but at what expense?. He and his family are separated. His wife
brought him nothing but good looks. Her stock of brains is small. She
is not easy in the new society into which she has been brought, and
sits quite mum both at the grand parties which the Old Jones's give in
Pocklington Square, and at the snug little entertainments which poor
Edward Jones tries on his own part. The women of the Jones's set try
her in every way, and can get no good from her: Jones's male friends,
who are civilised beings, talk to her, and receive only monosyllables
in reply. His house is a stupid one; his acquaintances drop off; he
has no circle at all at last except to be sure that increasing family circle
which brings up old MRs. SMITH from Swansea every year.
What is the lot of a man at the end of a dozen years who has a wife
like this?. She is handsome no longer, and she never had any other
merit. He can't read novels to her all through his life, while she is
working slippers-it is absurd. He can’t be philandering in Kensington
Gardens, with a lady who does not, walk out now except with two
nursemaids and the twins in a go-cart. He is a young man still, when
she is an old woman. Love is a mighty fine thing, dear Bob, but it is
not the life of a man. There are a thousand other things for him to
think of besides the red lips of Lucy, or the bright eyes of ELIZA.
There is business, there is friendship, there is society, there are taxes,
there is ambition, and the manly desire to exercise the talents which
are given us b Heaven, and reap the prize of our desert. There are
other books in a man's library besides OvID; and aſter, dawdling ever

out, and you get well.

sex, will not, I hope, cry out at the above observations,or be angry because

jealousy if you danced or spoke with any one else at a ball; or neglect
all his #. his business, his, interest in life, in order to dangle at

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BARE PROBABILITY.
THE Russian correspondent of the Daily News, who seems to think
that CRAcowitz, and : the other Russian Witses, are going fairly out
of their wits, has given publicity to a report that the Emperor him-
self has gone out of his mind—we hope, if it is so, he has only “gone
out for the day” —and the proof alleged is that the Autocrat has
seen “dancing about in his shirt for three hours.” . We admit that the
performance of such an extraordinary pas, seul would tell rather
unfavourably for the Imperial intellect, but there is nothing new in
Russia's cutting all sorts of capers, and as we know the bearis taught
to dance by ºf him amongst hot ashes, it may be the heat of
the continental soil, caused by the burning of the revolutionary
volcanos beneath, that has driven the Emperor into the extraordinary
ballet d'action in which he is said to be figuring. Perhaps he has
-
been bitten by the great republican tarantula that has led the greater
part of Europe a dance, to which nothing but the Dance of leath can
furnish acomparison.
“PLEASE, SIR, WE WE COME TO BORE YOU”
LoND9N is about to be regularly bored. The metropolis will be like
a sieve, full of little holes, º there are any inhabitants in the interior
of the earth, they will live in a continual shower-bath. The object of
this boring is to ascertain what kind of clay there is below our houses.
The Commissioners of Sewers talk of running an immense tunnel under
our coal cellars. For this purpose engineers will be empowered
to walk into any one's mansion, with an immense instrument like a
cheese-scooper, in order to taste if the soil upon which it stands, is
“the perfect Stilton” or not, for excavating purposes. Let us hope
if this monster Tunnel is ever carried out, that no future Guy, Fawkes
will take advantage of it for the purpose of blowing up London; it is
bad enough to be bored without being blown up into the bargain.
Another danger no less imminent than flying into the air, will be the
chance of dropping prematurely into the earth. Imagine London like
Lisbon, being destroyed by an earthquake, and yet if this immense
cavity were to open its mouth we should all be swallowed up, and there
is great doubt with such a swallow as that if London would ever see
another summer. It would not be agreeable to wake up some morning
and find yourself theinhabitant of a second Pompeii. etrust, there-
fore, that the President ºf this Commission, who, we take it, is SIR
WILLIAM Clay, will not bore us too much, or undermine the “first
city in the world” to that deep extent that every bit of property is
likely to fall in. By the by, we wonder how many members will

A PRINCELY oversight.
PRINCE Louis NAPQIEoN has liberated Bou Maza, but he has
certainly forgotten that ABD-El-KADER still remains in prison.
THE BATTLE OF CHATHAM.
FRANCE has had her Wagram, but of all the bits of mad Wag-gery
that ever were performed, commend us to the great Battle of Chatham,
which will go down to posterity with Waterloo in its pocket. The
British forces have shown how much they can really do without doing
anything. They have made themselves masters of a mound, sacked a
citadel, and, bagged a battery without the use of any shells more
formidable than their own shelljackets.
It is difficult to cork down the enthusiasm of our ink-bottle, and our

Another party ºnly deployed into a ditch; but being baffled by
an impracticable hedge, retired into a holly-bush, which served as a sort
of ambush, while the besieged army blazed away from the heights, and

the assailants unlikely to complete the operations in the manner
upon at the settling of the plan of the campaign, º blew up
their ºwn stockade, and the officers retired to take a glass of lemonade
behind the bastions, where a commissariat had been established.
It is highly satisfactory to the nation to know, that in the event of a
war our gallant fellows are able to take a fortification or lose a fortifi-
cation, to conquer or be conquered, and to receive or give a thrashing,
not only with equal indifference, but without the loss of a man, which:
ever way the action may terminate. With only one exception, that of
a poor fellow who tumbled of a ladder into a ditch—and that was an
accident of his own, for none of the foe would have thought of treating
him soroughly-there was not a single case for the list of casualties in
killed and wounded that invariably results from a battle. The Astley's
Sikhs are far more inveterate against Batty's British, or the Lambeth
Sepoys, than the º: arty towards the besieged in the operations
of which our gallant soldiers at Chatham have lately given us a
specimen.
We have seen more carnage at half-price, at the amphitheatre over
the water, than we should witness in a month of such fighting as that of
our troops; and as the affair must really have cost money, we hope
that on any future occasion the War Office will send for W.In DICOMB,
or any one of those general officers who have served in the Astleian
campaigns, in order that he may be consulted as to the lowest figure at
which the thing may be done in these days of economy.
A Lucky Escape for Somebody.
We are told that certain bodies, when charged with water, become
conductors of electricity. In this case the poor fellows, who had to
stand-up during the storm on Thursday last behind the Omnibuses,
must have been the greatest Conductors of electricity in the world, for
we observed that their bodies were charged with nothing but water.
It is lucky that the vehicle, passengers, horses, driver, and all, were
not completely knocked over by the shock.
What is Communism?
Geese, Donkeys, and Wolves feeding of the same common.
How TO TAKE THE RISE out of THEM.
SIR PETER LAURIE, the once famous putter-down of everything,
(including himself) is about to try if, with his strong arm, he cannot

MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD.
The Government, it is plain, is every day º in its sympathies
more and more dramatic. Common folks are startled by the omen that
to write a noble play does not, in the better mind of the powers that be,
unfit a man for the noblest activities of life. Taround, the author of
ſon, sitsin the judgment seat; and sure we are, will hold the scales with
as wise, as firm, and withal as tender a hand-tremblingly alive to the
balance of human truth and human claims—as heretofore he has held
the pen. The elevation of Justice TALFound is a grace done, not alone
to the Poet Judge, but to the commonwealth, or rather common poverty
of letters; and it is our faith that we only express the wish of the whole
literary º whom the judge is so greatly endeared—when we
desire for him along, long life of wise and º usefulness. May his
hairs become with years as white as his ermine! Both, we know, will
be unspotted.
A Lord of an Enquiring Mind.
"Lond RºpesDate enquired, in what positiona Cardinal would stand if one came to

Punch, in answer to his Lordship's enquiry, begs to refer him to the

and he will there see in the window the numerous positions in which
a Cardinal stands in this country. Punch hopes his Lordship is satisfied.
A “HAM” SANDWICH FOR REVOLUTIONISTS.
THAT profound politician—that great white feather of the Gallic
Cock-Louis-Napolºon, nephew of his uncle, lately paid a sentimental
visit to the town and fortress of Ham. He then and there confessed
himself-made a clean breast of it. He benevolently exposed himself
as a warning to revolutionary France. He put himself in the pillory of
his own history, and exhibited to the Reds a dreadful example. It
must have been a touching time! ..." Even butchers wept.” The
President did not visit, Ham from pride; oh no! but from gratitude.
He took a turn in his little garden, where he was wont to cultivate
heart’s-ease, not from ostentation, but out of sweet humility of spirit.
“Here’s the bower he lov’d so much,
And here's the tree he planted"—
the present French Tree of Liberty, in which the birds of the Press—
(all in cages, be it remembered)—are free to pipe the Marseillaise and
Mourir pour la Patrie/
And the people of Ham were greatly touched. The President’s late
º: the modesty of the man has tºº." the
publication of the fact-hung about him, embracing and sobbing. His
cobbler—though the President stood in far other shoes than in those
in which he fled from Ham-ſell upon his knees, and kissed the politic
leather. Histailor-though the great man had turned and turned his
Presidential coat-pressed to his lips the hem of the redingote. His
washerwoman, with a sweet and desperate sympathy, forced a bouquet
of forget-me-nots and imperial violets in the government button-hole!
And then the President made a warning speech. He said, “My
worthy subjects, my visit to your historical town and fortress has filled
me with mingled emotions of gratitude and remorse: of gratitude for
your great and undeserved benevolence towards a desperate revolu-
tionist—of remorse for the wickedness of my early life! When Ithink
of Strasburg, I feel all over—forgive the phrase—all over goose-flesh!
When I look back at Boulogne, I really don’t know how to look
forwardſ: "There is a dreadful audacity, my friends—subjects I should
say—in any attempt at revolution! I'mever felt the fall atrocity of
the endeavour until I took my seat at the head of France. . What I
undertook from, as I believed, a superabundance of animal spirits—
gaiº da earinow contemplate with ssible horror. Indeed,
so much has this feeling possessed me, that more than once I have
caught myself in my º about to take for England to
supplicate pardon of Louis-PHILIPPE, and to implore his return. But
this was in my sleep.
“Taught by the past, let me instruct you for the present and the
future. Be content with things as they are, and as they may be.
Believe that whatever, is, is the best... Bow to the laws—pay your
taxes—and above all, adore your Emp-that is, your President!”
With this, the great man caused a thousand crosses of the legion of
honour to be thrown as a scramble to the mob; and having—with
republican simplicity—again endured the embraces of his washerwoman
ing his eyes, he retired.
PUNCH*S AGA-PUNNERY.
. SINCE we threw out our suggestion of an º for the recep-
tion of aged and incurable punsters, several candidates have presented
themselves for the Retreat, in which it is hoped they will be allowed to
“Twirl the light pun, or play the gentle fool.”
One individual, who it is quite evident must be locked up somewhere
—either in an º or a Retreat of some kind, for he cannot
remain at large, has written to us to express a hope that the new
judge, whose appointment does infinite credit to those who made it,
may have a good many I-ons in the fire. -

REBECCA'S WANTED IN LONDON.
Accomping to the Daily News there are no less than 160 Turnpikes

PUNCH, OHR THE LONDON CHIAIRIVA 1R I
LIBEL ON FATHER MATHEW.
SoME varlet in New York—if he be an Irishman, may his tongue be
flayed with his next hot potato l—some spalpeen has been forging a
letter in the name of the good, the temperate FATHER MATHEw. A
letter in which the Father is made to denounce the allowance—the
paltry pension—of the ruthless Saxon; a pension of £300 per annum, so
ruthlessly—so iniquitously forced upon the Father for-what now
appears as plain as dirt in a bog—for preaching temperance to the Celt,
and with the whiskey in his bowels quenching his burning hatred to the
Saxon; a hatred that the whiskey, like spirits of wine under a silver
plate, kept screeching hot against the iniº.
All this is plainly a forgery. What! FATHER MATHEw ! The
bland, the calm, the ...; FATHER MATHEw—he abuse the
Saxon P. He attend public breakfasts in London, dropping words of
thankfulness, like cream-and now from the other side § the Atlantic,
to cry—“Dirty butter!”
This cannot be : for FATHER MATHEw is the Apostle of Temperance;
and Temperance does not reside only in a water-course; her. sole
support is not a F.'. Temperance—true, dignified and dignifying
temperance, is in the heart of man : in the gentleness of his speech—in
the charity of his thoughts towards all men. And FATHER MATHEw to
abuse England! FATHER MATHEw, with a black spot in his heart, to
desire “to throw up his pension from the British government,” when
—and not before—replaced by a º: pension from his friends in
America. We cannot believe in this double meanness, this double sin
of ingratitude and selfishness. For, in the matter of pension, the Father
will only illustrate the old proverb, namely—"not to throw away dirty
water, till you get clean,” and—in the Father's case—more of it.
Should, Father MATHEw really be this man, what a blow in the
mind of the unreflecting will be given to temperance!. After his defec-
tion, truth will not be thought to live in a well, but in a brandy-bottle
–and instead of the hyacinth and water-lily (types of the sustaining
lymph), grog-blossoms will be the only wear.
A RISE IN “Ion.”—SERIEANT TALFound has been made a Judge.
Hip ! Hip ! Hurrah!
AMAZONS AT PLAY.
HAving been informed by the Salisbury Herald that a match at
cricket would take place on Wednesday last at Pickett-post, with the
two elevens to consist of married and single women, it appeared to us
that such a cricket-match would be a rare game; so we sent our re-
porter to see the sport, and the following is his account of it:-
The single went in first, presenting the curious anomaly of single
wicket and double innings. The spinsters proved themselves worthy
of their name by the rate at which they made the ball spin; but con-
sidering their personal advantages, it is wonderful that so many of
them were bowled out by the married. . On the other hand, strangely
enough, several of the latter were caught. Victory, after, a long con-
test, was gained by the wives, who had judiciously husbanded their
strength; and we regret to add that the single, who played without
their parasols, were beaten brown. Prettier Long Stops, perhaps, were
never seen; and both the Long-Slips and Short-Slips were smart, if not
fashionable. However, it is in contemplation, to get up a Ladies’
Ground by way of companion to a LoRD's, for the promotion and en-
couragement of what may now be called the womanly game of Cricket.
Military Intelligence.
We understand that a Medal is being now struck for distribution
among the gallant fellows engaged in the siege operations at Chatham:
The Medal will be in Tom Trot of the very hardest bake, so that it will
bear a considerable amount of suction before it, is dissolved, and the
expressive motto of “Succour to the Brave” will be inscribed on the
margin.
It is not generally known that the only balls given out to the
troops on the day of the siege were Brandy Balls. The loss during
the battle is greater than was at first supposed, and in one case
the whole Guard that happened to be on the watch—comprising a
ºf watch-guard—ſell into hostile hands, and has not since been

EDUCATION IN THE ARMY.
E may judge pretty well what the education
necessary for the army was, by looking
at the instructions just issued as to
what it is to be. The candidate for a
commission must in future “be able to
read English correctly, and write, it
from dictation.” ... We presume this
means that, in reading English, a proper
respect is to be shown to the nice dis-
tinctions between W’s and Wºs, and
that no His henceforth to be admitted
“except, on business”—a regulation
that will, sadly interfere with those
ardent but ill-timed aspirations to which
some of our military youths have been
accustomed to, give utterance. . In arithmetic, it is expected, the
candidate will be “up” in the first four rules, or in other words be
able to put one and one together, and he must also show some acquain:
tance with that simple division of which too many a “general of division,”
has ere now been ignorant. -
... In language, it will henceforth be expedient to translate, either a
little Latin, or a little French, or a little German; the principle of this
regulation being, no doubt, that as "a little learning is a dangerous
thing,” the little of it, that is required will render our British Officers
very dangerous characters to the enemy. . In geography, the candidates
must know the names of the capitals of Europe, and it is no doubt,
thought they will be rich in geographical stores, when in thorough
possession of so large an amount of capital. They must also know the
names of the rivers of England, but it will not be necessary for them to
effect an insurance upon the Thames, lest it should be set on fire by any
One or more of them.
We, at all events, hail the instructions, that have been issued as a
proof that there is to be an end to that too frequent absence of all in-
struction, which has heretofore been regarded as perfectly adapted to
the first military capacity.
LAW, FILTH, AND PHYSIC.
“MR. PUNCH,
“You are aware that, underlying this fashionable district,
there is an accumulation of filth, whence, along a ramification of
deſective sewers, pestilential vapours are continually ascending. These
sewers thus form an apparatus for supplying the superjacent dwellings
with noxious #. It is proposed to clean them out, and to mend or
re-construct them, so that they may serve to carry off dirt, instead of
exhaling poison.
“I may say, indeed, that most of our aristocratic houses, resting on
such a basis as that which I have described, are founded on corruption.
Believe me, Mr. Punch, I do not mean this for satire, which I consider
unprofessional. I am an Apothecary, Sir. I wish simply to state the
truth, that our flowers of Fashion are blooming on a real hotbed. Of
course you know that the residences hereabouts let on an average at
from £1000 to £1500 a year. I mention this fact only in order that I
may place it in a new light. Pray consider the value of a medical
practice in so opulent a locality.
, “I should astonish you, Sir, if I told you how much Mist. Feb. I
dispense daily; to say nothing of the quantities of chloride of lime that
I send out to my patients. But where will be the occasion for febrifuge
Imixture when sanitary reform shall have extirpated fever, and what will
be the use of ºf fluids when efficient drainage shall have
prevented unpleasant smells?
“Abstractedly, I should—as an olfactory being—desire the removal
of the physical conditions which we exist under. But I bought my
practice subject to them. I have a vested interest in the effluvia of our
lly-holes. To expel the contents of the sewers would be to take the
read out of my mouth. , True, much more has been said than done
respecting Metropolitan drainage; and perhaps no interference with
Qur subterranean arrangements may take place in my time. But if the
filth I, live upon be removed, I certainly intend to claim compensation.
I shall be quite as fully entitled to it as the practitioners in the Palace
Court, Why, is a physical nuisance to be abated more summarily than
Asocial abomination; and why is a consideration to be shown to the
harpies of Law, which is denied to the carrion crows of Medicine;
“Your obedient Servant,
“STATIM SUMENDUs.”
“Belgravia, July 31, 1849.
A SURE SIGN OF A RAPID DISSOLUTION.
It is currently believed that the House will break up on the 1st, as
MR. Chisholm ANSTEY has a notice of motion for the 2nd.
THE PROGRESS OF PARLIAMENTARY JOKING.
MEMBERs are as fond of a joke as we are. The *...* only is how
to get it. . Unless REYNQLDs or SIBTHoRPE is speaking, they are sadly
at a loss for a good laugh. The smallest approach to a bit of humour
from CHISHOLM ANSTEY even makes them smile...This is the strongest
proof of the melancholy distress they are frequently reduced to.
A new style of joking, bowever, has been invented to meet the
ressure of the times. It may be called “The Petition Style.” It has
een very popular as far as it has gone, and the House in many instances
has roared at the fun. It is much jollier than SIBTHORPE's, and not so
* ANSTEY’s. We will endeavour to illustrate it by a few choice cases.
R. G. THOMPSON presented a petition from a native of Battersea,
roposing that Government should purchase the enclosure at Leicester
§: and turn it for the benefit of the public, into an American
Bowling Saloon. -
By MR.PLMPTRE, from a meeting at Exeter Hall, expressing its
horror at the Trafalgar Square Fountains playing on the Sunday.
By MR. HuME, from a tailor in the New Cut offering to repair all the
breaches the French had left behind them at Rome.
By LORD GRosvenoR, from the Beadle of Exeter 'Change, demanding
a searching enquiry into the horrors of the Silent System.
MR. MACKINNON, from the pieman at the top of the Haymarket,
asking leave to cook his mutton-pies in the Central Criminal Court.
MR. Osborn E, from the butchers, praying for leave to erect in
Smithfield Market a statue to the memory of SUETT.
By MR. DuNgom BE, from PROFEssoR RISLEY, .."; that the
Police Commissioners will not allow him to do the Grecian Statues on
the vacant pedestal opposite the National Gallery.
These are only a few of the absurd petitions that are presented every
night. The greatest absurdity is, that the Honourable Member who
resents the petition, is always the first to condemn the absurdity of it.
ſe are confident that it is only done “for the fun of the thing.” The
House must laugh, and so when QSBORNE and DisBAELI are absent,
petitions are presented. Besides if it is not for amusement, for what

DROPPING THE LADIES HALF A LINE.
RAILWAYs have adopted the theatrical principle of half-price. The
Brighton Railway has set the example, offering to take Ladies on Cheap
Excursions, at half the fare which gentlemen have to pay. We cannot
sufficiently admire the cleverness of this “artful dodge.” The Direc-
tors know well º that it is the Ladies who always induce the
Gentlemen to take a day's pleasure; and, out of ††. they present
the dear creatures with half a ticket gratis. What husband can pos-
sibly refuse now to take his wife with him to the sea-side, when it can
be done, so cheaply? The old excuse, of “The expense, my dear!”
will no longer hold. Fathers, too, will be obliged to give all their
“dear girls’ a treat, when taking two costs no more now than taking one
formerly. Brighton, will be inundated with the fair sex. It will be
the rendezvous of all the Mothers and Daughters of England. The in-
genuity of this plan, in fact, is so self-evident, its advantages will be
so certain, that we are confident it will be ultimately adopted, not only
upon all our railways, but at all our theatres, and places of exhibition.
omen love a bit of cheapness dearly, and the idea of §ºf anywhere
for half-price will so tempt them that they will never be able to stop
away. Some one must take them; and no father, husband, beau, or
brother will be allowed any peace till he has done so., We advise
St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey to try the same “dodge.” Let
them write up, “ADMIssion, 2d.; LADEs, HALF-PRICE,” and their
exhibitions will not be so deserted as they lately have been. The
Brighton Railway deserves to be presented by the fair sex with a silver
tea-pot, or a beautiful pair of braces, or slippers, or some, token of
femalegratitude, for having been the first to start this “dear, delightful,
duck of a plan,” which is really dropping the Ladies half a line in a
manner so friendly, that, we are certain, they will all (in the style of
scented note-paper,) “have much pleasure in accepting the Directors'
kind invitation for the Cheap Excursion to Brighton.” What a clatter
there will be in the train, to be sure!
A Friend to Fleas.
ONE HENRY Cory:AN, American, has put forth a delicious boºk on
European Life and Manners. In one passage of this brilliant volume,
he is grateful that he can be of any service to fleas:-
“I could not but reflect, with grateful satisfaction, that I could by my humble instru-
mentality, either in the way of subsistence or enjoyment, be of service to the meanest
of the animal creation."
Upºn this principle of self-devotion, MR. Colman could hardly refuse
the “loan of a bite” to a Bengal tiger.

CELEBRATED COMIC SCENE BETWEEN THE RAILWAY CLOWN (Hudson) AND THE INDIGNANT SHAREHOLDERS.
MORE OMNIBUS REFORM.
. “AN Omnibus Traveller” proposes a Fixed Price for Omnibuses,
instead of leaving the amount of the Fare to the capricious taste of the
Conductor. This plan would certainly put an end to the numerous
squabbles that take place at undetermined distances. Charing Cross
is generally the focus of all these disturbances. CHARLEs's Statue may
be called the Omnibus Seat of War. Pass when you will, you are
pretty sure to hear some noisy altercation, in which a female voice takes
the high notes, and the Conductor the very low ones, as to whether
the Fare is be 3d. or 6d. This is not so bad, however, as when the
Omnibus is kept waiting for ten minutes in the middle of a high road,
whilst the Fare is being argued. It is terrible then to hear the fierce
invectives of the three Outsides, and the loud grumbling of the Insides,
all anxious to get home to their dinners, Ladies generally hold out
the longest. It takes such a long time to convince a woman she can
be wrong, especially in Omnibus matters; and we have seen a lady,
with a beautiful ermine tippet, run half way down the Kensington
Road, sooner than sacrifice three miserable coppers. She was perfectly
right in the long run, H(we really believe there are women who would
walk round the wall of China to save a halfpenny toll,)—and we admired
her dauntless spirit, though we were pained, as we looked at her muddy
boots, at the dirty cause in, which it had been exercised. A Fixed
PRICE, made intelligible to the smallest capacity, would remedy this far-
spreading evil, and stop all those numerous stoppages, and quell those
frightful émeutes, which at present disturb the jog-trot equanimity of the
most amiable Bus. At present the Fare is 6d. and a ſancied im-
#. or else 3d and a row thrown in. We should like to see it
fixed at the latter sum, without the usual appendage. How strange it
is, that Conductors never know how to conduct themselves!
A DROP FOR FLIGHTY FOOLS.
THE principal Life Insurance Companies have agreed upon the fol-
lowing clause:—“That the Policy is forfeited if the death arises from
an accident in a Balloon.”
SIEGE OPERATIONS AT MR. DUNUP'S.
THE recent siege operations and sham fight at Chatham having been
completely successful, MR. DuNUp, with his usual desire to contribute
to the amusement of the public—the only contributions for which he
likes to be called upon, resolved to place his chambers—or rather his
outer door—at the disposal of his numerous creditors, who have already
had some practice in the task of besieging it.
The business of the day commenced by the advance of a detachment
of a Park of Light Artillery from Whetstone Park, who threw in a
shower of washing bills at the letter-box, with which MR. DUNUP's
fortress is loopholed, but these small skirmishers having failed to pro-
duce any effect, retired within their own (clothes) lines.
This operation was followed by a somewhat more serious advance,
consisting of a file of the Old Cognovits, officered by GENERAL Levy
who came up with the whole force of his peculiarly heavy charge and
seemed prepared for speedy execution. MR. DUNUp with great adroit-
ness .# stationed a corps of infantry consisting of his own and other
boys at the outposts, to create a diversion by going over the posts, and
the ruse succeeded so well that Levy's men had their attention drawn
off, leaving MR. DUNUP at liberty to further strengthen his position.
At the conclusion of this part of the siege, a brilliant little manoeuvre
was conducted in dashing style by Tailor's division, which made a tre-
mendous charge in single column, aiming several 5, 8 and 10 pounders at
MR. DUNUP with an evident determination in every case “to stick it
into him.” For the purpose of gaining time, he sent a flag of truce in
the form of a bill stamp, and Tailor's division having resolved to draw
and defend themselves, those terms were offered to MR. DUNUP's
acceptance, and thus the siege ended in what may be called a
"drawn battle.
-
Boys' DISTRIBUTION.
MILEs's Boy has quite lost his unity. The singularity which he has
so long enjoyed is for ever dispelled, for since the Panoramas have been
drawing }. slow lengths along, it is clear that BANvARD, BonoM1,
and Risley, have proved themselves to be Three Miles' Boys.

THE LATE MR. KENNEY.
THE benefit advertised in the name of MR. KENNEY, was an occasion
of mingled sorrow and congratulation. Ere the curtain rose, the º:
author was dead: the brain that for six-and-forty years had laboured in
the sweet and bitter work of dramatic literature, had ceased to ache;
the hand was clay; the tongue “a tuneless instrument.” It is under:
stood that, the cares and anxieties, of straitened means had antedated
the natural result, ... This is the old, old story; but more especially in
England. A meridian of seeming prosperity, and a decline and old
of withering distress. MR. KENNEY had, in his long day, lightened the
cares of hundreds and hundreds of thousands—had sent multitudes
smiling to their beds. He been the means of aiding to build a
large fortune for the actor; and—such is dramatic reward—he obtained
for his enduring work a passing pittance. Until within a few years,
the brains of MR. KENNEY were--as with every other dramatist—the
free property of any manager. . The dramatist—until SIR. E. BULweR
Lytton gallantly protected him—bore a caput lupinum : he was a
literary outlaw: any. CRUMMLEs might, in a dramatic sense, rob and
murder him; a double atrocity that generally went together. Had
such a law as, the present obtained in the early day of MR. KENNEy,
he might by the happy exercise of his genial and refining talents have
secured for the winter of his life, the wherewithal, to keep off winter
wants. At his last day he would not have needed the aid of #.
sional §§ for the means, that subscribed at last, were told only
upon his coffin-lid. --- -
But—it may be asked by Political Economy; that, whatever its
wisdom, is not always personified by—
“An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,
Broad cloth without, and a warm heart within, -"
it may be asked, what has any government to do with the necessities
of a dramatist, however gifted the individual? We answer, every-
thing; where duties are to be performed and paid for. We at once
declare, our conviction that MR. KENNEY has been defrauded of his
rightful due by a Whig Government; and proof shall follow closely at
the heels of the accusation. -
There is an officer called the Deputy Licenser. It is, his duty to
search the MSS. of all dramas lest treason, disaffection, indecency, in
fact, aught against government or good manners, should be orally
published by the actors. We have our own notion of the inutility of
the office—an office denounced almost with his last words by CHATHAM.
As well have a censor of the press, it seems to us, as of the playhouse.
However, whilst the office exists, it is—in our opinion—the rightful
appointment of the eldest dramatist, whose works have either advanced
qr honourably supported the character of the Stage. The actor has his
fund, with yearly plate presented to a dining public. . He has,
moreover, money success—a success wholly disproportionate in its results
to any conceivable prosperity of the author; for, MR. Pool.E, for
instance, received gº only for Paul Pry, whilst the actor, Liston
must have drawn down many thousands—a very rain of wealth upon
P †: umbrella. { of D Li he righ
Well, this appointment of Deputy Licenser—the right we contest
it, of the dramatist—how has it been bestowed For many, many
years it was enjoyed by an Evangelical gentleman who with a disgust of
plays that, no doubt, did him great honour, scrupled not to take the
reward of plays, which quite as certainly did him at least equal profit.
He died; MR. LARPENT was gathered from a world of sin, in which
fees for playhouse licenses are possibly not the least of its wickedness.
To LARPENT succeeded GEORGE CoLMAN; a most proper succession—
the º fitting one upon record, CoLMAN, having purged his conscience
of his dramatic impurities, by cutting out the “heavens” and “angels”
and such bold speaking of other men—“cuts” never attended to, but
nevertheless, unflinchingly made-Colm AN dies, seeking the reward of
his social virtues and official righteousness.
And now-enter CHARLEs KEMBLE, comedian! In 1803, KENNEY
wrote Raising the hind, even at the present day a household farce.
KN9WLEs had added Kiryinius to the classic drama; the kingdom was
still echoing with the honest, hearty laughter of Poole's Paul Pry,
nevertheless, the government despised the claims of either of these men.
MR. CHARLEs KEMBLE the actor, with the Fund at his back, and
Covent Garden in his pocket,_MR. CHARLEs KEMBLE is endowed
with the office and emoluments of Deputy Licenser.
Yes; “CHARLEs KEMBLE”—“classic name, KEMBLE”—“SIDDONs”
T-"John KEMBLE”, and so forth: sonorous words—noble associations
&c.; &c, &c. And so, the dramatist pocketed the wrong committed
on him in favour of the classic actor with the classic name. . But now
comes the fulness of the injustice. CHARLEs KEMBLE has a son
named John ; a robust scholar who can translate “Beowulf” from the
Saxon. . Well, the old declining KEMBLE is permitted by the Whigs to
yacate in favour of his filial Saxon scholar, and the man deep in
... Beowulf”, is the man chosen for Deputy Licenser, vice CHARLEs
KEMBLE, who retires! A pretty juggle ſhis of the family money-box.
Let us be understood. For MR. Charles KEMBLE we have no
other feeling than personal respect, elevated and enriched by happiest
recollections of his actor's art. We only denounce an injustice of the
government, that careless or contemptuous of the legitimate claims of
the declining dramatist—of the writer who has done the world
enial service by lightening many of its heaviest hours, by ...; for
it “a sunshine in a shady place”—compels him in the winter of his
days, and (as in the case of poor KENNEY) even with death at his bed-
side, to assume the attitude of petitioner for a º: bounty, when he
has achieved the right of an honourable competence, by rendering daily
work for daily hire. Many years of MR. KENNEY’s life might have
been made years of placid happiness; but then—there was the name of
KEMBLE, and with it associated the great dramatic claims of the trans-
lator of “Beowulf.”
MR. KENNEY is now beyond the sympathy or indifference of Whigs or
Tories. Nevertheless, his history is not to be passed in silence. Painful
for the *: we trust it may carry a wholesome warning for the
future. It is a little too bad that literature should be made to wear,
even for an hour, the character of petitioner—and a barren word.
monger with a big name eating the bread of defrauded talent.
THE NOES HAVE IT.
It is true enough, unfortunately, that the “Noes have it,” as far as
the abolition of the Smithfield Market nuisance is concerned and as the
Nose will be likely to have it for some time to come, we have much
pleasure in putting forward a proposition to protect the olfactory nerves
against those exhalations, which would make us imagine that London,
though watered by the Thames, must be surrounded by the Qder. John
BULL is somewhat asinine in his patience under nuisances, but we may
begin to hope that he may have a tendency to the asinine propensity of
being led by the nose, and if he really follows his nose, he will at once
have a turn-up against some of those pestilential smells that put the
nasal organ completely out of tune, and that he will do something more
than meet noxious vapours with idle vapouring.
In the mean time, and until something is done—which never happens
until everything has been said—we recommend the adoption of nose
bags to Fº the nose, in the same way that articles are worn to
screen the eye against dust, for it must be quite as injurious to get the
nose into bad odour as to have the eye converted into a temporary
dusthole.
The plan we beg leave to recommend, is the application of a sort of
muffler filled with disinfecting agents to the nostrils, and in thus putting
a remedy for bad air under the very noses of the public, we hope the
feature in question may be made the scenter of everything that is
agreeable. To those who wear moustachios, we recommend a mixture
of the chloride of lime, but care must be taken in wet weather to
prevent the sinking of the lime by the rain, for a case of spontaneous
combustion in the face would be quite enough to put anybody out of
Countenance. -

Tuesday, July 31, 1849–Prevailed º by my Wife to carry her to
Bath, as she said, to go see her Aunt Dorothy, but I know she looked
more to the Pleasure of her Trip than any Thing else; nevertheless I
do think it necessary Policy to keep in with her Aunt, who is an old
Maid and hath a pretty Fortune; and to see what Court and Attention
1 pay her though I do not care 2d about her! But am mightily troubled
to know whether she hath sunk her Money in an Annuity, which makes
me somewhat uneasy at the Charge of our Journey, for what with Fare,
Cab-Hire, and Wails to DoRothy's Servants for their good Word, it did
cost me altogether £6.2s. 6d. To the Great Western Station in a Cab,

runks and Bandboxes, as is sº the Way with Women; or else we
might have gone there for 2s. 6d. less in an Omnibus. Did take our
Places in the First Class notwithstanding the Expense, preferring both
the Seats and the Company; and also because if any Necks or
Limbs are broken I note it is generally in the Second and Third
Classes. So we settled, and the Carriage-Doors slammed to, and
the Bell rung, the Train with a Whistle off like a Shot, and in the

and I did begin to talk French with her, which my Wife do not well
understand, and by and by did find the Air too much for her where
she was sitting, and would come and take her Seat between us, I know,

MR. BROWN’S LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TOWN.
OUT OF TOWN.
HAVE little news, my dear Bob, where-
with to entertain thee from this city
from which almost everybody, has fied
within the last week, and which lies
in a state of .# I wonder what
the newspapers find to talk about day
after day, and how they come out
every morning. But for a little distant
noise of cannonading from the Danube
and the Theiss, the whole world is
silent, and London seems to have
hauled down her * as HER MA-
JESTY has done at Pimlico, and the
Queen of cities is gone out of town.
You, in pursuit of Miss. KICKLE-
BURy, are probably . th
or Hamburg. , Watch her well, Bob,
and see what her temper is like. See
whether she flirts with the foreigners
much, examine how, she looks of a
morning (you will have, a hundred
opportunities of familiarity, and can
drop in and out of a friend’s apart-
ments at a German watering place as
you never can hope to do here),
examine her conduct with her little
sisters, if they are of the y,
- whether she is good and playful with
them, see whether she is cheerful and obedient to old LADY KICK (I
acknowledge a hard task)—in fine, try her manners and temper, and see
whether she wears them all day, or only puts on her smiles with her
fresh bonnet, to come out on the parade at music time. I, meanwhile,
remain behind, alone in our airy and great Babylon.
As an old soldier when he gets to his ground begins straightway a se
caser as the French, say, makes the most of his circumstances, and
himself as comfortable as he can, an old London man, if obliged to pass
the dull season in town, accommodates himself to the time, and forages
here and there in the deserted city, and manages to make his own tent
snug. A thousand means of comfort and amusement spring up, whereof
a man has no idea of the existence, in the midst of the din and racket of
the London season..., I, for my º: am grown to that age, Sir, when I
like the quiet time the best: the gaiety of the great London season is
too strong and noisy for me; I like to talk to my beloved metropolis
when she has done dancing at crowded balls, and squeezing at concerts,
and chattering at conversaziones, and gorging at great dinners—when
she is calm, contemplative, confidential, and at leisure.
CoLoREL, PADMORE of our club being out of town, and too wise a
man to send his favourite old cob to grass, I mounted him yesterday,
and took a ride in Rotten Row, and in various parts of the city, where
but ten days back all sorts of life, hilarity, and hospitality, were going
on. What a change it is now in the Park from that scene which the
modern PEPys, and that ingenious youth who signs his immortal
drawings with a D surmounted by a dicky-bird, depicted only a few
weeks ago!. Where are the thousands of carriages that crawled alon
the Serpentine shore, and which give an observant man a happy an
wholesome sense of his own insignificance—for you shall be a man long
upon the town, and pass five hundred equipages without knowing the
owners of one of them? Where are º
trampled the Row?--the splendid dandies whose boots were shiny,
whose chins were tufted, whose shirts were astounding, whose manners
were frank and manly, whose brains were somewhat small? Where
are the stout old capitalists and bishops on their cobs (the Bench, by
the way, cuts an º good figure on horseback) P Where are
the dear rideresses, above al
red neck-ribbon in the distance made your venerable uncle's heart
beat, Bob He sees her now prancing by, severe and beautiful—a
young DIANA, with pure bright eyes! Where is FANNY who wore the
pretty grey hat and feather, and rode the pretty grey mare. FANNY
changed her name last week, without ever so much as sending me a
iece of cake *. The gay squadrons have disappeared: the ground no
onger thrills with the thump of their countless hoofs. WATTEAU-like
roups in shot silks no º: compose themselves under the green
ughs, of Kensington Gardens: the scarlet trumpeters have blown
themselves away thence; you don't behold a score of horsemen in the
course of an hour's ride; and MRs. CATHARINE Highflyer, whom a
fortnight since you never, saw unaccompanied by some superb young
Earl and roué of the fashion, had yesterday so #. to do with her
WOl. xvii.
is time at Spa|i,
the myriads of horsemen who |b
? Where is she, the gleaming of whose |b
beautiful eyes, that she absolutely tried to kill your humble, serv
with them as she cantered by me in at the barriers of the Row, and
looked round firing Parthian shots behind her. But Papmore's cob
did not trot, nor did my blood run, any the quicker, MR. Bob; man and
beast are grown too old and steady to be put out of our pace by any
MRs. HIGHFLYER of them all; and though I hope, if I live to be a
hundred, never to be unmoved by the sight of a pretty girl, it is not
thy kind of beauty, Oogling and vain DALILAH, that can set me cantering
after thee.
By the vy one of the benefits I find in the dull season is at my own
lodgings. henſing the bell now, that uncommonly º; youn
woman, the landlady's daughter, condescends to come in and superinten
my comfort, and whisk about amongst the books and tea things, and
wait upon me in general: whereas in the full season, when young LoRD
ant
and occu
a bit will Miss Flora ever deign to bring a message or a letter to old
MR. BRown on the first, but sends me in Muggins, my old servant,
whose ugly, face, I have known any time these thirty years, or the
blowsy maid-of-all-work with her sandy hair in papers.
Again, at the club, how, many privileges does a man lingering in
London enjoy, from which he is precluded in the full season! Every
man in every club has three or four special aversions—men who some-
ow annoy him, as I have no doubt but that you and I, BoB, are hated
by some particular man, and for that excellent reason for which the F.
disliked DR. FELI–the appearance of old BANQUQ, in the same place,
in the same arm-chair, reading the newspaper day after day and evening
after evening; of MR. PLODDER threading among the coffee-room tables
and taking note of every man's dinner; of old GENERAL HAWKSHAW
who makes that constant noise in the club, sneezing, coughing, and
blowing his nose—all these men, by their various defects or qualities,
have driven me half mad at times, and I have thought to myself, O that
I could go to the club without seeing BANQuo–O that PLODDER
would not come and inspect my mutton chop–0 that fate would remove
Hº and his pocket handkerchief for ever out of my sight and
earing :
one's shoulders. MR. and MRs. BANQUQ are at Leamington, the paper
says; MR. PLopDER is gone to Paris to inspect the dinners at the Trois
Frères; and HawksHAw is coughing away at Brighton where the sad
sea waves murmur before him. The club is your own. How pleasant
it is! You can get the Globe and Standard now without a struggle;
you may see all the Sunday papers; when you dine it is not like dinin
in a street dinned by the tramp of waiters perpetually passing wit
clanking dishes of various odours, and jostled by young men who look
scowlingly down upon your dinner as they pass with creaking boots.
They are all gone—you sit in a vast and agreeable apartment with
twenty large servants at your orders—if you were a Duke with a
thousand pounds a day you couldn't be better served or lodged. Those
men, having nothing else to do, are anxious to prevent your desires and
make you happy—the butler bustles about with your pint of wine—if you
. a dial, the chef himself will probably cook it : what mortal can
ask more
I once read in a book purporting to give descriptions of London, and
life and manners, an account of a family in the lower ranks of genteel
life, who shut up the front windows of their house, and lived in the back
rooms, from which they only issued for fresh air surreptitiously at
midnight, so that their friends might suppose that they were out of
town. I suppose that there is some foundation for this legend, I
suppose that some people are actually afraid to be seen in London, when
the persons who form their society have quitted the metropolis: and
that Mr. and MRs. Higgs being left at home at Islington, when Mr.
and MRs. Biggs, their next door neighbours, have departed for Margate
or Gravesend, feel pangs of shame at their own poverty, and envy at
their friends' better fortune. I have seen many men and cities, my
dear Bob, and noted their manners; and for servility. I will back a free-
orn Englishman of the respectable classes against any man of any
nation in the world. In the competition for social rank between HIgGs
and Biggs, think what a strange standard of superiority is set up!—a
shilling steamer to Gravesend, and a few shrimps more or less on one
part or the other, settles the claim. Perhaps in what is called high life,
there are disputes as paltry, aims as mean, and distinctions as absurd.:
ut my business is with this present §. being ashamed to be in
London. Ashamed, Sir! I like being in London at this time, and have
so much to say regarding the pleasures of the place in the dead season,
that, per favour of Mr. Punch, I hope to write you, probably, another
letter regarding it next week.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR ANGLO-ITALIAN CLIMATE.
SoMEBody has been saying that during the very hot weather we were
favoured with an Italian sky, but we confess we never saw anything in
London to remind us much of Italy, except Italian irons, Oil and Italian
warehouses, Italian greyhounds, and those very unfortunate dogs, the
Italian organ boys. As to the italian climate, we will undertake to be
whipped into an Italian cream, if any reasonable being could confound
our confounded atmosphere of London smoke with the transparent air
of Italy. Though MEux and Co. may consume their own, and we may
exclaim, “Tantºmieur,” we cannot forget that BARcLay and PERKINs,
with a thousand others, publish their daily volumes of smoke, in columns
almost as thick and heavy as those of the morning papers, when the
debates have been lengthy the preceding might in Parliament.
THE COVES OF CORK.
CoRk appears to be in a state almost equal to that which would be
cº by the pressure of ginger beer, champagne, or soda-water,
whose effervescence acting upon Cork might produce just such an effect
as that which Cork itself and all the Coves of Cork are at this moment
encountering.
Every loyal subject will imagine that it is the exuberance of delight
at the QUEEN’s visit which has given so much buoyancy to Cork, but
the truth is, that the excitement originates in a dispute between the
Mayor and the High Sheriff, as to the right of one or other, or both, to
immediately precede HER MAJESTY on her entrange into the City. The
Mayor has rendered himself hoarse in insisting on his º and the
High Sheriff is equally vehement, on the strength of an old ancestor,
who was standard-bearer in Ireland to HENRY THE SEcond.
It is difficult to work out the calculation, that “As the standard-
bearer was to HENRY THE Second, so is the High Sheriff to QUEEN
Victoria,” but we leave the matter to be settled by the ingenious Coves
of Cork, among whom we understand there is one who wears a watch
presented to him by WILLIAM at the Boyne, and who claims the honour
of letting HER MAJESTY know the “time of day,” during the whole of
her sojourn in Ireland. It is added that the dispute between the Sheriff
and the Mayor has been referred to the proper office in London, where
we understand arrangements have been made for “tossing up,” to decide
the knotty point, as soon as the necessary halfpenny can be remitted
for the purpose from the Treasury.
The Gibbet-Cure.
It may seem astonishing that there should exist, in this nineteenth
century, such folly as that instanced in the following paragraph, ex-
tracted from the hº Herald:–
“Supenstition.—On Friday last a respectable looking female, afflicted with a wen
in the neck, applied at Lincoln Castle, after the execution of Ward, for leave to see
the body, with a view of curing her disease; the request was very properly refused.”
It may, however, be questioned whether a man hanged is not as
likely to remove a wen as to put an end to murder. The remedy has
been long enough tried for the latter complaint; but without success.
ALARMING PROSPECTS OF THE BRITISH DRAMA.
In consequence of the dreadful destitution of all the French theatres
—an affecting account of their closed and beggared condition has
appeared in the newspapers—a meeting of gentlemen materially inte-
rested in the support and prosperity of the English drama, was convoked
for yesterday at the Cock and Bottle in the Strand, and was very
numerously attended by nearly all the English translators of the day.
A strong body of police was in waiting to ensure propriety and probity,
it having been intimated that several of the swell mob had been seen in
the neighbourhood.
The chair was taken by MR, CHAMBAUD Jones—justly known as the
father of the Translated English Drama—who briefly opened the pro-
ceedings. In a nervous and imaginative speech of five minutes, the
chairman went to the root of the matter. Something, he said, must be
º: to restore the French Stage, or the English Theatre would fall
or ever.
MR. Levizac Brown moved the first resolution. He observed that
more than thirty years had made the English and the French Dramatist,
he would say it, like Siamese twins. The Channel was—it might seem
a º band of union; for by its means the circulation of ink
(though, to be sure, it only flowed from France) was kept up between
them. If the French Theatre died, the vital fluid must run dry in the
breast of the English Thalia. (Cheers.)
MR. BEAUMARCHAIs GREEN, in seconding the resolution, said he
would make the matter plain to the meanest understanding. The
French stage was the New River; the English Theatre was the cistern,
lined with lead. Now, dam the New River, and how are you to
supply the cistern: It was impossible! (Cheers.)
MR. Boy ER SMITH moved the second resolution; and would illustrate
the matter—as he thought—rather felicitously. The French stage was
a tree—the English stage a noble bough of that tree. Bark the parent
trunk, and—yes, he was bold enough to ask it—what would become of
your bough? He was not an alarmist, but unless something was done,
he predicted that next winter every English theatre ºi. knocked
down by the hammer, sold off in lots!—for firewood.
MR. MoiſerE Johnson (in seconding the resolution) said he thought
he could bring the matter much nearer to their business and bosoms.
“You want,” said MR. MoLIERE. Johnson, “You want a bottle of
prime Burgundy. Well, the bottle is before you, and you are about to
empty it into an English jug. Very good. The bottle, has received a
crack, and not a drop of wine remains. Now, the wine being gone from
the bottle, what is to fill your jugº Nothing—it remains empty:
totally º And this, I say, will be the speedy condition of every
London. Theatre. The Paris Bottle being broken, the English Jug
cannot be filled.” (Loud cheers.) It had been for many, many years his
custom to visit Paris Theatres for playhouse fashions; but this season he
must stop at home. Let the present state of French Theatres continue,
and they might all—as º as they would-dispose of their Dic-
tionaries, to say nothing at all of their Grammars.
Here a conversation—a little irregular certainly—ensued. One of
the meeting asked, “why confine themselves to France? Why, always
take so near a translation?” Another exclaimed that “China might
be tried.” A third that “there must be somethin
Japanese.” It was, however, finally decided—in accordance with the
resolutions—that a subscription should be opened for the re-establish-
ment of the French Stage, as the only means of supplying dramas to
the English Theatre.”
Punch Puzzled.
We are not in the habit of asking questions, because we are not in
the habit of finding anything that answers half as well as we do ourselves,
but we have really been puzzled by reading a report in the Times of the
trial of a man for “the illegal conversion of a horse.” We should be
glad to know what it was to which the horse was illegally made a
convert P how the ceremony of conversion was performed * and how the
success of the ceremony was recognised?
We remember upon one occasion converting a fiſty-pound note into a
clever cob, who was too clever by half for us, and who was accordingly
converted back again into seven sovereigns, but as to any other kind of
conversion of which a horse is capable, we admit ourselves to be wholly
ignorant.
Fire Engines suppºrts Edred.

GIVING THE RAINS TO THE IMAGINATION.
THE fall of Red Rain has, as we anticipated, set the seeds of fancy
#. in the minds of the penny-a-liners, who have been inundating
the newspapers with showers of
every kind, that may be likely to
ye a whet to the public curiosity
he poor frogs must be considered
as being definitively gone to the
dogs, for henceforth a shower of
frogs will fail to find admission
into the most easy and accom-
modating of newspapers. We
have already heard of a shower
of shrimps, and we dare say we
shall soon read of its having pelted
with prawns and periwinkles, or
of there having been a most un-
welcome overflow of whelks in
some suburban water-butts. From
the smaller it is easy to get to
the larger fish, and we may soon
be prepared for a shower of jacks,
requiring a vast amount of jack-
towelling to dry it up; nor should
we be surprised if that celebrated
rain of terror, the rain of pitch-
forks, may one day be realised.
We think the late extraordinary
rains must be attributed chiefly to
that notorious wet blanket Old
SwitHIN, who should be limited
at least to one or two materials,
instead of damping our energies
with all sorts of showers, consisting of all sorts of objects, in all sorts
of colours. The gentleman who stands up to his ancles at Greenwich
continually for the purpose of writing to the Times to announce the
number of inches of rain that have fallen, must have been in a series of
nice messes lately amidst the real and other miscellaneous rains that
have so smartly been down upon him.
THE PROROGATION SPEECH.
A PARTY CRITIQUE.
[A gentleman who signs himself “True Blue,” has favoured us with some observations
on the QUEEN’s Prorogation Speech. We have much pleasure in subjoining our Cor-
respondent's critique ; and are highly flattered by the preference which he has shown
to us over certain Anti-Ministerial Contemporaries.]
“THE Parliamentary Farce of 1849 has ended with a Managerial
Address, purporting to emanate from the Crown, and delivered in the
character of LoRD PRESIDENT by the MARQUIs of LANsdowne. This
composition of our Whig rulers is characteristically incorrect, in
f;...". ambiguous in sense, and erroneous, in so far as it is intel-
gible, in assertion.
“LoRD JoHN RUssell and Co. begin by telling “My Lords and
Gentlemen” that ‘ the state of public business enables HER MAJESTY
to dispense with their attendance in Parliament.” Do Ministers mean
that #. satisfactory state of public business allows HER MAJESTY to
release Parliament from its labour; or that the disgraceful condition of
the national affairs obliges her to send it about its business?

A CHEAP EXCURSION TO SMITHFIELD AND BACK FOR
ONE SHILLING.
We are happy to state that a wealthy Omnibus Company has made
arrangements to take E. to that º place of healthy
resort, Smithfield, and back, for the contemptible sum of One Shilling.
The first excursion is to take place next Monday, that being fortunately
a Market day, which will allow the passengers an opportunity of wit.
messing the innocent, gambols of the animals that #. themselves
there, with such rural playfulness. The Omnibus, the better to enjoy
this elevating sight, will proceed through the very midst of the j.
oxen, and halt in the centre of the Market, where it will make a stoppage
of six hours. Passengers will be permitted to descend, if they like, and
to ramble about at their leisure. "All the pigsties will be thrown †.
on this occasion, and every facility given to the excursionists, that they
may inhale, unmolested, the health-inspiring breezes of this acknowledged
Garden of England.
A Flower Show will be held at the apple stall against the picturesque
lamp-post which bears the Royal Arms, in tin, at the top, and, if
possible, a cabbage leaf full of currants, gathered on the s ot, will be
added to the fºe, to give it something of a horticultural air.
excursion is expected to come off with great éclat, as Smithfield never
looked so blooming, or was so full, as at the present moment. HIG.
GINBottom's Brass Band will attend before the Marquis of Granby, and
perform some of their most popular airs during the day.
OMNIBUS, RACING INTELLIGENCE.
THE fine old English sport of racing has been taken up with much
spirit by the omnibus drivers on the Brompton and Putney roads, who
turn the highway into a course, and run against each other—or anything
else that may be in the way—from about 8 a.m. till midnight. The
Putney Pets and the Brompton Beauties, as the competitors are called
by their respective backers, may be seen every five minutes at the
London Bridge Railway Station, from which, after several false starts,
they usually set away together and proceed not only neck and neck, but
neck or nothing, past KING WILLIAM’s statue to the Mansion House,
which may be considered the first heat, when, after a few more false
starts, they make all the running they can to Charing Cross, where the
second heat terminates. The race increases greatly in interest from
this point, for it assumes, the character of a steeple chase at St.
Martin's Church. and the usual fence work of hurdles, ditches, or other
miscellaneous obstructions is supplied by the old women and the fruit
stalls, which form a very efficient substitute for the customary im-
pediments in sport of this description. The old two-penny original,
which from the broken-winded character of one of the cattle—since re-
tired—used to be known as the “two-penny buster,” makes very little
running, and in fact is only placed among the outsiders, the number of
outsiders that it carries being quite unlimited. . . . -
As these races are likely to continue, we think it would be advisable
for the public to keep the course thoroughly clear of all vehicles, and
passengers during the period when the road is occupied by the Pets,
Bucks, and Beauties of Putney and Brompton, . It is true that the
racing continues, throughout the day, and it might be inconvenient to
shut up the road as a public thoroughfare, but while it is used as an
omnibus race-course, the course we recommend is the only one that can
be safely followed.

THE CASE OF THE STATION CLERKS.
SINCE our appeal on behalf of the Station
Clerks, we have been inundated with letters of
thanks, from these solitaries, several of whom
are getting quite, like the prisoner of Chillon—
only with the Chill-off—for º don't take it
so cool, but protest warmly against their
treatment. Many of them live in such seclusion,
that if they were released from their solitud
they would almost have forgotten how to .
aconyersation, or sayanything º: “Right;"
and indeed there is one of our Correspondents,
who, describing himself as an Odd Fellow, com:
plains that, he has so long pursued “the even
tenour of his way”—the Railway—that there
is nothing odd about him any longer, since he
has been debarred from attending the social meet-
ings of his fraternity.
Another unfortunate individuallaments bitter
the hardship of being unable to combine wit
his fellow sufferers in expressing their sentiments,
but the only thing they are suffered to express
is an express train once or twice a day, while
they long in vain for the aid of the only engine
that would be of any use to, them—that great
moral engine, the Press, which has a boiler
always boiling over with virtuous indignation at
wrong and oppression... Now that we have got
our steam up on this subject, we shall continue
from time to time on the line we have taken,
and we have no doubt that we shall rapidly bring
the grievances of the Station Clerkstoaterminus.

[From our own
UBLIN, AUGUST 4.—THE excite-
ment of the city continues,
like the beds at the taverns,
on the rise. Already, two or
three far-seeing members of
the Corporation have been

scopes of forty-eagle power,

And here, Mr. Punch, you
must, whether you will or
no, permit me to congratu-
late you on the choice of your

juncture, and to perform so nice a duty as that of detailing to you the
events, opinions, and secret thoughts of the population of Dublin. How
rarely do you find united in the same person the elegance, the quietude,
the serene energy and the *...* of the high-bred gentleman
with the watchfulness and confidence of the Reporter. One fact—a
native modesty does not allow me to make the one fact two—will

In ºf my portmanteau and looking-glass. Shaved and kidded,
I drove to the Viceregal Lodge, Phoenix Park. I sent in my card, -
“P. O'NoMAN, of Punch.” ; three minutes, a gentleman of the most
aristocratic bearing—there is no mistaking blood, Mr. Punch; it is
nature's own mark, in her brightest red—stood beside my car. He
was arrayed in a gorgeous silk dressing-gown, sprinkled with sham-
rocks, and having at the back the royal arms, worked in damask. I at
once recognised my man; It was, of course, the LoRD LIEUTENANT,
“My dear Sir,” said he, shaking me cordially by the hand, and
assisting me to jump from the car; “my dear Sir, as we say in Gaelic

the LoRD LIEUTENANT. Good fellow, CLARENDon: and the Dublin
Bay haddock beyond expression. During breakfast we talked of the
state of the country;, and CLARENDoN was pleased to express his
opinion—even, on so short an acquaintance—that I appeared to be the
only man capable of going to the root of the evil of Ireland. His Excel-
lency may be partial; nevertheless, he is a man of prodigious penetration.
Leaving the breakfast-room, what was my surprise, to see my port-

next, Dublin's Mayor and Guild will be centralised in the city of
London. Or wherefore—ask these people, wherefore should Gog and
MAgog cross the Channel? I, of course, attach no credit to this report;
neither does my friend LoRD CLARENDON : it is, however, my duty at
the least to chronicle it. -
HER MAJESTY's foot has sent a thrill of expectation throughout the
city. The QUEEN is known to possess a Cinderella foot; a fairy foot,
that would stand tiptoe on an umbent daisy. One of HER MAJESTY's slip-
pers—the perquisite of LADY-, Maid of Honour, has been ºbtain. ;
and, º in silver, is in the window of all the goldsmiths. The
silver slipper—the thought is very º made to serve as a butter-
boat; charmingly typical of the belief that, wherever HER MAJESTY
treads in Ireland, the richness of º will follow.
You can have no idea of the shriek of despair that has gone through-
from top to bottom—all female society. No lady is to be presented un-
less by another lady presented by another on a former occasion in
London. Thus, it seems, the Saxon privilege is made another source
of heart-burning. It was, of course, understood by everybody that
nothing more would have been necessary than for every lady wishing to
pass the compliments of the time with the QUEEN to send, up her car
on her own silver salver. At the present moment, as I understand, not
being on the spot myself-at least five thousand well-dressed females are
marching on the Lodge to demand an explanation of LADY CLARENDON.
I earnestly trust that no collision will take place, but I cannot shut my
eyes to the fact that a squadron of Horse have turned out, artillery
ointed, and fusees iii. to read a great moral lesson to the rioters.
hope the Dublin ladies will listen to reason—for if they won't, they’re
invincible. -
You can have no conception of the rise of rents in every part of
Dublin, it being expected that at least two-thirds of Lºndon will take
lodgings and leases in our city. In a while, and Sackville Street will
be as gay as a dying dolphin—and won’t chickweed and sowthistles
grow in the Quadrant and upwards ! There is an alarming report—I
speak, Sir, with the love of an adopted son for London—that, the
UEEN’s Crown, with all the Regalia, are about to be brought to
Dublin; which strengthens an opinion-long slumbering, but now
awake and kicking—that the Government will remove itself from
England to Ireland; and so the Saxon have, in his turn, the smallest
taste in life of absenteeism. Only think what the trade of London
would come to, if English nobility and gentry bought their liveries and
lucifer-matches of Dublin tradesmen -
You will be glad to hear that every attention will be given to Dublin’s
Lord Mayor, who insists upon meeting the QUEEN on horseback. He
will, for safety sake, be tied on the animal; for nothing weaker than
cords of silver and gold can keep his enthusiasm from running clean
away with him. - -
They are now covering the Statue of KING WILLIAM with satin
bows of green and orange, which bows contain all kinds of combus-
tibles that, at the due moment, will explode, exhibiting the hero in a
shower of fireworks. -
When the QUEEN lands, at least a thousand turtledoves (a certain
Repealer suggested a few Irish owls) will be set free; and it is said that,
at the same time, a bird will be thrown up from the Victoria and Albert;
a bird bearing, in a packet, the pardon of SMITH O'BRIEN to his
excellent lady. -
I would write more, but that I am interrupted by an Equerry from
CLARENDON. The dinner bell will sound in five minutes, and I shall
hardly save my soup.
Your own Correspondent,
P. O'NoMAN.
P. S. Until further instructions you will, of course, address me at the
Lodge. It has been hinted to me that HER MAJESTY proposes—out of

endeavour to bear the visitation like a man.
A BILL FOR THE BETTER BEHAWIOUR OF BROUGHAM.
It has been objected to Ministers that the past session—like so
many others—has º: after much delay and trifling at the commence-
ment, hurried in the most unseemly manner to a close. Ministers, how-
eyer, are not incorrigible. They propose to amend this fault; and—to
abate a public evil much felt of late—have already ordered a Bill to be
drawn, to be called “A Bill for the Better Prevention of LoRD
BROUGHAM’s Powers of Examination in Certain Cases.” The reader
of the daily papers—see Hill's Divorce and similar bills—must feel that,
for the sake of public decorum, it is necessary to curb the imaginative
loquacity of the erotic and learned lord. We have been favoured with
a perusal of the draught of the Bill in question; from which we give
the subjoined clauses.
“Neither shall it be lawful for HENRY LORD BROUGHAM AND WAUx
to interlard the evidence of witnesses, with any suggestive prurience.
Neither shall he, for more than five minutes at a time, dwell upon and

illustrate the testimony of witnesses from his own varied experience.
Neither shall he put questions that have no other end save the self-in-
dulgence of a very questionable curiosity, in no way furthering the
ends of justice, but, apparently, tending only to the earthy gratification
of the aforesaid HENRY LORD BROUGHAM.
“And be it enacted, that the penalty for the infringement of this
clause shall be a verbatim report of the offender's words in the Times
newspaper.”
It is believed, by the authors of the Bill, that a continued publicity of
the errors of speech committed by the venerable offender must abate
what, during the present session, has been found, upon all hands,
an intolerable nuisance.
A HAND-BOOK TO THE THAMES.
WE wish MR. Murray, amidst the variety of his very useful Hand-
Books—if he has no objection for once to put his hand into dirty water
The banks of
the river would furnish ample food for the antiquarian—if the anti-
quarian is not very particular what he eats, and indeed we know that
he is usually gobe mauche, enough to swallow anything. . Since we have
had Panoramas of the Mississippi, and the said Sippi has found its
Missis regular hits, why should we not have a Panorama of the Thames,
embracing all the objects that fringe its banks, and infringe upon its
waters * A few of the principal establishments would furnish a collection
no less interesting to the chemist than to the antiquarian. Ever
factory would help to give a satisfactory solution of the poisonous stuff
that is held in solution by the water in which many of us make our tea,
which eventually gives us our gruel. A glance at the buildings on the

other test to prove why it is so detestable. We entreat the Sanitary
Commissioners, if they would do more than skim the surface of their
duties, to go deeply into the Thames, and they will get to the bottom
of one of i. greatest drawbacks on the health of the Metropolis. .

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S PROROGATION OF THE OPERA
SEASON.
E have it on the very best and
highest authority (our own)
that Mr. Punch will º
tn propria persona to the
Prorogation of the Season at
the theatre of HERMAJESTY.
Though no regular proclama-
tion has been issued from
the Board (and Lodging) of
Green Cloth, we are enabled
to give an outline of what
will take place, which may
be some guide to those who wish to take places.
Mr. Punch, besides wearing on the occasion his coat of office or office
coat, will invest himself in the vest of white jean, and
will carry in his pocket the order of the nights and
extra nights of the Grand Qpera in the Haymarket.
Immediately before him will be carried the Editorial
Regalia, consisting of the Pen of Justice, the Ink of
Impartiality, and the Scissors of Severance, while
Mr. Punch himself, as President of the Republic of
Letters, will hold in his hand the binocular glass of
double-sightedness, as an emblem of his being able to
see twice as far as any other individual. At the
appointed hour Mr. Punch will preside at a council,
by inspecting a drawer in his Cabinet, to ascertain tº
his means of º it, and an officer of rank—the
waterman—will call from the rank a vehicle suited to
the reception of his Punch-ian Majesty. On his pro-
ess to the House, several Bills will be laid before him
y the Commons in attendance at the windows of the cab, but eve
one
of those bills will be thrown out as fast as they are thrownin, and the
royal assent will not be vouchsafed to any one of them.
- -
hºſº
pºliºſ
-
Qn the arrival of his Punchian Majesty at the door, the excitement
will be of that extraordinary kind, that impressed itself on the minds
and toes, of all those who have assisted at the LIND and SoNTAG
furores which marked the commencement and the close; forming, as it
were, the Alpha and Omega of the now expiring season at the theatre
of HER MAJESTY. On the farewell visit of Mr. Punch, so great will be
the struggle for admission, that several who are fortunate enough to
get within the doors, will leave their skirts among the outskirts; and
many a coat will be left without a tail to tellits own story.
Mr. Punch will be met at the barrier by the gentleman clerk of the
check, and will be preceded to the critical chair of state by the box-
keeper bearing the keys of office. He will graciously give his assent
to such bills as may be placed in his hands by the officers of the house;
and he will, after taking his seat, proceed to deliver his speech on the
º of the Opera season—the whole assembly remaining
uncovered.
The following will be the principal topics which will form the subject
of the address:–
Mr. Punch will, in the first place, intimate that the empty state of the
Metropolis enables him to release the artists of Her Majesty's Theatre
from #. duties, and he will express, his great satisfaction at the zeal
and ability with which their services have been rendered, throughout a
season requiring more than ordinary energy and loyalty on the part of
all concerned. - -
Mr. Punch will intimate his regret at the retirement of one of the
most valuable ministers to the º: entertainment, in the person of
e
JENNY LIND, whom he nevertheless hopes to recall permanently to her
allegiance, as he has once already succeeded in doing, though but for a
temporary period; and he will express his sincere satisfaction, that, by
the great diplomatic powers of the Minister of State for Operatic
Affairs, the secession alluded to was promptly repaired, by the return to
the public service of MADAME SoNTAG, with ingr powers to treat,
and great indeed has been the treat, or series of treats, thus afforded.
º Punch will add that
the Italian question might
have been very gravely
complicated but for this
event, and he will evince
his approbation by putting
AME Sontag at once
on his own civil list of
those to whom he shows :
civility, at the same time
ratifying the "gº".
of Maname Sontag to
his good books, by throw-
ing her a good bouquet.
lº
ºr gº
--
Mr. Punch will say a few complimentary words with reference to the
orchestral forces under FIELD-MARshAL, BALPE, to whom he will
present a new baton, with the expression of a hope that it may be useful
in preserving that admirable discipline which has made his gallant band
so mainly instrumental in promoting that harmony so essential to the
operatic interests.
Mr. Punch will express his admiration of the loyalty that has distin-
guished that class which may be said to embody the public voice, and
particularly. Signon LABLACHE, as decidedly the most powerful repre-
sentative of this voice, as well as its largest embodiment. Mr. Pºnch
will thank him and others for their personal sacrifices as broken-hearted
fathers, jealous husbands, and º: lovers, in the numerous very
exciting scenes in which they have been called upon to act a part during
the progress of a season, calling for more than an ordinary amount of

Mr. Punch will leave it to the administration to thank the gentle-
men of the Pit and Galleries for the liberal supplies of º
and will refer them to the same source for the estimates for next
Season.
Mr. Punch will then congratulate the Speaker of the House upon his

“MR. PUNCH, SIR,
. . “Though I cordially agree with our present Ministers in their
non-intervention º: with respect to foreign nations, I must call
#. you to interfere in French affairs, sofar as relates to the treatment
of travellers at the Railway Station at Amiens.
“Sir, at Amiens, I was dragged to what was termed a table-d'hôte,
but which was in fact an embodiment of Irish destitution in the
worst periods of famine. There was a soup,tureen certainly, but upon
removing the cover ‘all was desolate within.” The tureen was a
theatrical property, to dress the table; but, as CHARLEs. MATTHEws
says of everything in Used Up, there was literally “nothing init. Baulked
of my expected soup, I made for a dish of apples, but when I clutched
at one, the whole of the rosyfruit adhered together in my hand, and
wheni put it hastily to my mouth, the apple, though not actually turning
to ashes, turned to papier mâché on myſlip. I waited anxiously for the
next course, and afowl made its appearance, but my hungry and irritated
fellow-travellers were beforehand with me, and just as I hoped to have a
‘bird in hand, alas! the bird was flown.
“The bell now began to ring for the departure of the train, and the
waiters became busy in their demands for three francs each from the
voyageurs, who were compelled to pay the sum under a º of indig-
mant protests in a jargon of mixed languages. One of my fellow-coun-
trymen paced the refreshment-room with fury, exclaiming, 'Je n'ai pº
mangá ºn seul article.”. Another cried, ‘C’est un take-in norme. A
third shouted, “Q'est infame; it nºw est pas un, objet que, je pouvais
attraper;” and a fourth, in a state of desperate bad French, that seemed
to indicate a loss of reason, screamed out, ‘Je writerai un lettre à la
“Times” foot sweet gueſe land a Folkstone.”
“Upon this hint I speak. But instead of writing to the Times I write
to you, Mr. Punch, for you are everywhere in France, and I think you
must be attended to it you raise your voice against the evil I have
pointed ºut to you. You will admit that a question so nearly affecting
an Englishman’s dimer, and coming home directly to his heart or
stomach, must be a casus belli, in the most emphatic sense of which the
words are capable.
“There has been so much cordiality and good feeling, as well as so
much hospitality, lately between the English and the French, and I and
you, and every right-thinking person, Mr. Punch, must feel so desirous
|of keeping up this pleasant understanding between the two nations, that
we must all feel indignant against such an outrage as the one I have
described to have been committed against the British appetite-envoyage
-at the railway station at Amiens.
“There are liberal men belonging to both countries on the direction of
|the Boulogne and Amiens Railway, and I feel assured, Mr. Punch, that,
through your pages, the caterers at Amiens will be compelled to turn
over a new leaf, and the English-as well as the French-traveller will
have something more substantial for his three francs than the sight ºf
an emptysomptureen, and the chance of a divided moiety ºf achicken's
leg, should he befortunate in the course of the long pull, the strong
pull, and the pullalltogether’ that is made at the poor pouleſ.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 63
OUR LITTLE BIRD.
The ENGLISH FORCES FIGHT FOR Hungary AND ROME.
ARE rejoiced that, by means
—that to our shame, we
have for some months neg-
lected—we are this week en-
abled to chronicle many suc-
cesses obtained by English
#. ºº. Italy and
ungary. The campaign pro-
ceeds º admirable vigour.
Every day gives new life to
the cause. Recruits pour in
from all quarters. BEM and
KossuTH have within the
past week been admirably re-
inforced; and MAzzINI sup-
ported in his exile with the
assurance of the resurrec-
tion of Rome, The Bear
has suffered a damaging hug
—the Twin-headed Eagle has
been clawed and mauled—
and the blood-dabbled Cock
º: on its Roman dung-
hill of glory.
The English force is made
up of men of the true metal;
somewhat of the same iron
stuff that beat, almost two
centuries ago under buff
coats. , Stern, strong, true:
hearted men, with an object
clear as a star before them,
and a downright will to carry
it. The English force has
º parks of artillery;
shells that carry from shore
to shore; that jump seas and leap mountains. The shells of Woolwich, in comparison, are
pop-gun pellets from a sliced, potato; school-boy missiles. The English cannon, though
charged with white powder, and carrying not an ounce of iron, do marvellous mischief at any
distance. Though fired at Manchester, they make reverberations in Roman streets, and are
echoed amid the fastnesses of Hungary. The troops, armed to the teeth—exactly to the
teeth—have neither º: nor musket, nor side-arms: they bear, however, an invincible
Mºnion: thing of ethereal temper forged in the brain of man, and worshipped
in his heart.
It is not permitted us to give all the movements of the English Forces in the present
campaign. e can only indicate a few, and in very concise terms.
GENERAL LORD DUDLEY, STUART carries on a very successful guerilla war with the foe.
Now, we hear of him at Marylebone—now he descends upon Kensington—to-morrow he
may be at Shoreditch—the next day at Wandsworth. Almost every day the General sends
forth a flying host in aid of Hungary and Rome. ... Countless numbers, compressed—like
MILTON's spirits at the council—into such small dimensions, that thousands and tens of
thousands can manoeuvre in full column even on no #. field than a sheet of news aper;
and the battle now waging will, no doubt, be henceforth known as the Battle of the Broad.
sheet—a battle bloodless, but holy as the fight of the immortals.
At Manchester, GENERAL the REVEREND Doctor WAugh AN, has made a splendid
onslaught, falling upon the weakest part of the enemy. The Reverend General addressing
his troops, dwelt with fine emphasis, full and throbbing from the heart, upon the employment
of a weapon that, used against iniquity, carries with it a worse than mineral poison:
and the weapon is-Contempt. “A man may not care about being feared or hated,” said
the Reverend General, “but let him feel that he is loathed by the intelligence and the
virtue of man, and that will be torture to the very centre.” Here the troops gave a loud,
º hurrah, such as is sent from the heart of a forlorn hope, charging to the łºń.
. Contempt is, no doubt, a fearful weapon; and then we of the English force can 'noint the
instrument with such terrible oison, that, with its subtle appetite, it shall eat through gaols of
flint, and manacles of iron. For we can materialise the uttered scorn, and bait it withink—
printer's ink. Wonderful compound! Now a balsam and now a poison; now conveying
sustaining comfort, sweetest health, and sympathetic love to outraged man—and now
devouring, with the hunger of flame, the heart of tyrannous wrong. Priceless unguent!
The salve of suffering, and the bane of crime. Beautiful is a review—very glorious are
thousands of bayonets, the impartial sun, kissing the murder steel!. Inspiriting the
º: , hearts pulsating to its brassy breath!, Terrible the cannon; their silent homicidal
mout º: stupidly cruel. , Neyertheless, all dull—all dumb-all dust, when touched and
touched by John GUTENBURG's Öintment-Printer's Ink, Lay it on well, and wisely, and
In fº. time the bayonets shall break like autumn reeds—the trumpet be choked to silence—
and the cannon crack and crumble like sun-split clay. -
It is with this said printer's ink that the #. forces, assembling in the cause of foreign
freedom, are enabled to fight upon that tremendous plain—a plain more pregnant with

of our ubiquitous Little Bir |ink, at this moment fights thousands strong on
mighty thoughts and marvellous deeds, than the Plains of Waterloo or of Marathon—the
WOL, xWII. H
Plain of Paper; a Plain destined ere long, to be
the one battle-field of the civilised *.ſi. any
other fighting field especially marking the savage,
whether he wears the green of Russia, or the
blue of France: essentially, and to all human
meaning savage, as the scalping Indian, or the
Hottentot, gut-engirdled.
Thus the spirit of opinion informing printer’s
the side of Hungary—at this moment frowns
in the eyes, and hisses in the ears of France,
clanking her dragoonsabre on the stones of Rome.
England is alive and .."; Troops are
filling halls, and generals and officers º;
platforms. Tongue-fight against cannon-fight!
Aromatic printer's ink against foul charcoal and
saltpetre! The broadsheet—the glorious Plain of
Paper—against the field of blood.
We must rejoice at this. For we have too
long sat under the blight of seeming apathy.
We have too long, with hands *...;
pockets, hummed John Barleycorn, The Roast
Beef of Old England, and other comfortable,
stomachic melodies; almost heedless of the cries
of outraged nations, invoking in their agony the
Spirit of Eternal Right. Our silence has been
to us a passing shame. We have all too care-
lessly opened ourselves to the charge of national
treachery. We who centuries since arose and
smote down tyranny in open fight; we, who look
in the face of heaven with loftier gaze, and tread
the earth with a more assured foot, touched and
strung by the thought that we of all free men are
the most free—thanks to the ocean and our own
bold blood—we, who have been the teachers of
the world; teachers of that elevating lesson
that makes, life sacred: we have looked some-
what surprised, askaunt, that we should have
disciples, followers; that men, gazing on “the
meteor flag of England,” smit by its glory, should
raise their standard, and dare to die, defending
it. In truth, we have for a time seemed trimming
teachers who would fain deny their early teach-
ings. Excellent lessons, to be learned and trea-
sured for their sustaining grandeur by ourselves;
but not to be communicated; not to be learne
and put in action by any sort of folk beyond
Dover beach.
We have cast away this passing shame. LoRD
PALMERston has sounded a noble bugle-note;
and the English forces from all quarters have
gathered, and are stillſº.; The battle goes
daily on—opinion still increasing in its might;
until in the end a triumph. Of course there
are scoffers of its *...; men who laugh, laugh
sardonically in smallopinion's peaking face. Poor
LoRD BRough AM grins at opinion; puts his
finger to his nose; hilariously cuts a caper at the
mere notion of opinion; and further to indicate
his contempt would, we doubt not, with all
England combined in the utterance of one with-
ering hissº-play the Jew's harp, blithely accom-
anying the scorn that cannot—for what was
#. BRough AM is now a Parchment Peer—
cannot sear him.
Englishmen, however, are not all become
BRough AMs. Were it so, the marvellous change
would only precede the annihilation of the race,
for BRough AM would continue to kill WAUx
and WAUx to kill BRough AM; so that, as with
the Last Man of the world, the last BR.ogg|HAM
would be the last Briton. The motion is sug-
gestive. Imagine the last BRough AM now
wandering to the Tower for the crown, and now
at Westminster Abbey, solitarily assisting at his
own coronation! Now sitting on the throne in
Buckingham Palace, and now driving himself-
with the cream-coloured horses, eight-in-hand-
to open Parliament. For all this, and more of the
ºf he would do, or he would not be the Last
BRough AM.
However, enough of the º Peer. Let
us end, repeating the note of gladness with
which we #. Let us hope that with every
day, the English Army of Opinion will increase;

bird of song is no longer
a rara avis, for there is
scarcely a concern that
relies on the counte-

for support, that has
not a poet or an author of some kind or other "...". establishment.
Some rely on the voluntary contributions of enthusiastic letter-writers
who divide their time between swallowing pills, rubbing in ointment,
and forwarding laudatory epistles on the wonderful effect of the treat-
ment to which they submit themselves.
The collected letters of a certain Earl enjoying a sort of alphabetical
pre-eminence in the peerage, and “enjoying ” also the very worst
health—for it must be an enjoyment to experience the balm of constant'
cures for his constant ailments—the collected letters of this scion of the
aristocracy would form a good-sized volume, and would make a capital
companion to Chesterfield's Letters to his Son, under the title of a
Nobleman's Letters to his Doctor. His Lordship must, however, rank
among the mere amateurs of authorship, and cannot be included in that
honourable list of literati who furnish, not only the fruits of their fancy
in gentle song, but the result of their research and industry, in the
more solid shape of elaborate treatises on boots, coats, hats, and that
great science, second only to that of self-knowledge itself, the science of

if he would only accept the offer of the numerous works that are thrust
issued by the various advertising bootmakers.
We have lately perused an admirable chapter in one of those works
upon the high-low and ancle-jack, in which a great deal of antiquarian
gossip relative to high-low-jack and the game is brought in with an
adroitness that filled us with astonishment. We were much edified
also, by a playful allusion in the same quarter to the famous battle of
#y.ſa. with reference to which the author suggests, that “Ey-lau, had
it been written º: ought to have been graced with the presence
of a BLUCHER an
craft, that the authors are reaping a rich harvest from the demand in
which their talents appear to be at the present moment among the
votaries of trade, but as most of the works are circulated by gratuitous
distribution, and as things are usually valued and paid for according to
what they bring, we fear that the love of fame rather than the fames
(anglice hunger) of the writers will stand a chance of getting satisfied.

uite puzzled to know how these five Portraits will be managed? Will
they be all on foot, or all on horseback P Will they be all taken at the
same age, or distributed over different periods of the DUKE's life? We
will give an imaginary list of them:—
1. Portrait of the DUKE of WELLINGTON in his long clothes.
2. Portrait of the DUKE cutting his first tooth.
3. Portrait of the Duke scouring the Indian Empire.
4. Portrait of the DUKE tossing up with MARSHAL SouLt for the
battle of Toulouse.
5. Portrait of the DUKE with one boot and one shoe, on the memo-
rable field of Waterloo, shaking hands with NApoleoN, previous to the
commencement of the battle. -
We should like to add a sixth to the list. It would be just as
imaginary as any of the preceding.
6. Portrait of the Duke rewarding with his own hand a Veteran of
the Peninsula.
We would sooner have the sixth than the whole five put together:
It is not too late for the DUKE to sit for the likeness now. We will
find the Veteran—and the Medal too.
But stop—we have just found out the secret of these five Portraits.
Don't you see ? It is because the DUKE is Warden of the Cinque
Ports. Depend upon it, there is to be a Portrait for each Port.

his web in a lair or den, which is called his

according to an intimationº up in

to involve them in his meshes, in the
hope that should they prove to be aworth-

A TREAT FOR TRAVELLERS,
Now that the pleasures of the road are cut short by the yelocity of
the rail, there is nºthing by which the “linked sweetness” of a journey
can be so thoroughly “long drawn out,” as by means of a voyage in a
suburban omnibus. The western road is perhaps the one upon which
the old “slow coach” system is the most thoroughly kept up; and it
may truly be said, that if you wish for a revival of “old associations,”
the Hammersmith and ensington Omnibus Association presents the
most suitable vehicles for such a purpose.
To a traveller who really likes to have enough travelling for his
.# we can safely recommend the Kensington’Bus, which makes the
grand tour of Coventry-street, and thus gives the public the benefit of
an extra half-mile-which, being exactly so much out of the way, is a
gratuitous ride—that the real lovers of locomotion, for locomotion’s
sake, cannot be too grateful for.
The Notting Hill and Bayswater Omnibuses, though varying compa-
ratively little from the direct route, make up for #. apparent parsi-
mony of distance by a liberal allowance of time, and by treating their
passengers to an almost unlimited number of stoppages. This plan
enables the curious and inquiring traveller to indulge his curiosity by
wondering why the 'Bus don’t go on, and inquiring of the conductor
the cause of so much loitering. To foreigners the advantage of this
i. is very great, as it enables them to pay particular, attention to
the various spots near which they pass, and opposite to which they are
kept waiting for periods of greater or less duration. The gunsmith's
shop in Oxford-street is no doubt a subject of peculiar interest to the
foreigners frequenting the Bayswater ’Buses, for these machines are
always drawn up for some considerable time in a position to enable the
iº. to take the most lengthy and deliberate observation of the spot
uded to.
The Hammersmith Association must be truly enamoured of the
scenery between the Bank and the Broadway, for there is a “reluctant
amorous delay” throughout nearly the whole route, which proves a
degree of affection for certain spots that is truly wonderful. The cellar
of the White Horse in #. has such charms for the 'Bus drivers
that they have been known to linger near the spot with a pertinacity ap-
proaching in its intensity the home sickness or mal du pays of the Swiss
peasantry. We are expecting to see excursions advertised ere long
under the taking title of a Summer's Day on a Kensington Omnibus,
and we shall ..i. surprised to meet with the announcement of a trip
to Hammersmith and back in one day, as an expedition full of promise
to the traveller.
TO THE WOMEN OF READING.
MR. STANFORD, the fire-new M.P., heroically determined, at any
sacrifice, to carry out his promise of marrying a lady of the town of
Reading, has issued the following circular: a º of which has been
sent to the habitations of the i350 electors, the ſetter superscribed—
“To the Unmarried Lady or Ladies of the House.”
The letter is as follows—“MR. STANFORD, M.P., gives notice to the
spinsters and widows of Reading that, determined to redeem his º:
given at the hustings; desirous that the wedding-ring thrown to the
unmarried women of the borough, should be taken up by at least one
of them (the present defective state of English law not permitting
even M. P's, to commit polygamy,)—he is ready to receive sealed tenders
(the more tender the better) from candidates for orange blossoms.
“Mr. STANFord, M.P., therefore requires that every lady shall send
in a true report of her age; her personal attractions; her height; her
temper; her standing in society, and her sittings in church. Further,
that she shall give a faithful account of her present fortune; by no
means exaggerating her expectations. MR.STANFORD would further
suggest that every candidate should forward her miniature, none the
worse if set with brilliants.-(Please to state if vaccinated).
“MR. STANFORD, M.P., pledges himself to have selected at least one
thousand ladies by the first of April, 1850; these ladies to be reviewed
by him on a given day, at a place to be named, in or near the town of
Reading; and the bride selected, MR. STANFORD further Fº himself
immediately to enter into the bonds of matrimony, with the maid or
widow of his choice. - -
“A grand tea-party, a dance, and other entertainments-concluding
with tumbling and fire-works—will be given by the bridegroom on
the auspicious occasion. - - - -
impressed upon congenial cake, will be distributed to all the pupils of
all the schools of the borough. . . - -
“Ladies are requested to send in their Tenders by Michaelmas Day,

KEEP YOUR ADVICE TO YOURSELF.
THE Morning Chronicle says, “We have just received Advices from
Vienna.” We should say that Austria was at the present moment
more in a state to take advice than to give any. If it will take Punch's
advice, we would advise it as its best friend to leave Hungary alone,
and for the future to mind its own affairs, which sadly want it.

can be no doubt that the Countess had in her sufficient genius
sufficient audacity, to attack and marry whom she would. Hai
she taken it into her head to invest Apsley House, it cannot be
questioned that even the Iron Duke must, in due time, have sur-
rendered at indiscretion. Seeing, then, the many matches that
lay before her (no vendor of lucifers could grasp a choice from a
greater number,) we think the Donna Countess has shown con-
siderable humility. She might have carried off a Generalissimo,
and she is content with, certainly, the very smallest of Lieu-
tenants. Very self-denying this of the Bavarian Broom Girl.

MR. BROWN's LETTERS TO A YoUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN.
OUT OF TOWN.
AREERING during the season from
one party to another, from one
great dinner of twenty covers to
another of eighteen guests; from
LADY HUSTLEBURY's rout to
MRs. PACKINGTON's soirée—
friendship, to a man about town,
becomes impossible from Febru-
ary to August : it is only his
acquaintances he can cultivate
during, those six months of
turmoil.
In the last fortnight, one has
leisure to recur to more
tender emotions: in other words,
as nobody has asked me to din.
ner, I have been about seeking
dinners from my old friends.
And very º: are they to see
you : very kindly and hospitable
are they disposed to be, very
pleasant are those little calm
réunions in the quiet summer;
evenings, when the , beloved
friend of your youth and |. sip
- a bottle of claret together lei.
; (without candles, and ascend to, the drawing-room where the
friend' of your youth's wife sits blandly presiding over the tea-pot.
What matters that it is the metal tea-pot, the silver utensils being
packed off to the banker's? what matters that the hangings are down,
and the lustre in a brown-hollands bag? Intimacy increases by this
artless confidence—you are admitted to a family en deshabille. In an
honest man's house, the wine is never sent to the banker's; he can
always go to the cellar for that... And so we drink and prattle in quiet
—about the past season, about our sons at college, and what not. We
become intimate again, because Fate, which has long separated us,
throws us once more together... I say the dull season is a kind season:
gentle and amiable, friendly and full of quiet enjoyment.
Among these pleasant little meetings, for which the present season
has given time and opportunity, I shall mention one, Sir, which took
lace last Wednesday, and which during the very dinner itself, Ivowed
would describe, if the venerable Mr. Punch would grant me leave and
space, in the columns of a journal which has for its object the promo-
tion of mirth and good will. - .
In the year, eighteen hundred and something, Sir, there lived at a
villa, at a short distance from London, a certain gentleman and lady who
had many acquaintances and friends, among, whom was your humble
servant. For to become acquainted with this young woman was to
become her friend, so friendly was she, so kind, so #. so full of
natural genius, and graceful feminine accomplishment. Whatever she did
she did charmingly; her life was decorated with a hundred pretty gifts,
with which, as one would fancy, kind fairies had endowed her cradle;
music and pictures seemed to flow maturally out from her hand, as she
laid it on the piano or the drawing-board. She sang exquisitely, and with
a full heart, and as if she couldn't help it any more than a bird. I have
an image of this fair creature before me now, a calm, sunshiny evening, a
green lawn flaring with roses and geraniums, and a half-dozen gentlemen
sauntering thereon in a state of great contentment, or gathered under
the verandah, by the open French window; near by she sits singing at
the piano. She is in a pink dress: she has gigot sleeves; a little child
in a prodigious sash is playing about at her mother's knee. She sin

the lawn, and ſisy in the blue sash vanishes to the nursery; the room

the cigars glow in the balcony; she sings song after song, in accents
soft and low, tender and melodious—we are never tired of #. her.
Indeed, BoB, I can hear her still—the stars of those calm nights still
shine in my . and I have been humming one of her tunes with
my pen in my mouth, to the surprise of MR. DoDDER, who is writing at
the opposite side of the table, and wondering at the lackadaisical expres-
sion which pervades my venerable mug.
You will naturally argue from the above pathetic passage, that I was
greatly smitten by MRs. NIGHTINGALE (as we will call this lady, if you
will permit me). You are right, Sir. For what is an amiable woman
made, but that we should fall in love with her? I do not mean to sa
that you are to lose your sleep, or give up your dinner, or make yourse
Fº in her absence: but when the sun shines (and it is not too
hot) I like to bask in it: when the bird sings, to listen: and to admire
that which is admirable, with an honest an hearty enjoyment. There
were a half-dozen men at the period of which I speak, who wore
MRs. NIGHTINGALE's colours, and we used to be invited down from
London of a Saturday and Sunday, to Thornwood, by the hospitable
host and hostess there, and it seemed like going back to school, when
we came away by the coach of a Monday morning: we talked of her
all the way back to London, to separate upon our various callings when
we got into the smoky city. SALyATOR Ropg|ERs the painter, went to
his easel; WoodwańD the barrister, to his chambers; PIPER, the
doctor, to his patient, (for he then only had one), and so forth. Fate
called us each to his business, and has sent us upon many a distant
errand since that day. But from that day to this, whenever we meet,
the remembrance of the holidays at Thornwood has been always a
ond of union between us: and we have always had MRs. NIGHTIN-
GALE’s colours put away amongst the cherished relics of old times.
N, was a West India merchant, and his property went to the bad.
He died at Jamaica. Thornwood was let to other people who knew
us not. The widow with a small jointure retired, and educated her
daughter abroad. We had not heard of her for years and years, nor
until she came to town about a legacy a few weeks since.
In those years and years what changes have taken e!
SALVATOR RoperBs is a Member of the #. Academy. OODWARD
the barrister has made a fortune at the Bar; and in seeing Doctor
PIPER in his barouche, as he rolls about Belgravia and May Fair, you
at once know what a man of importance he has become.
On last Monday week, Sir, I received a letter in a delicate female
hand-writing, .# which I was not acquainted, and which Miss FLORA
the landlady’s daughter, condescended to bring me, saying that it had
been left at the door by two ladies in a Brougham.
“—Why did you not let them come up stairs?” said I in arage, after
reading the note.
“We don't know what sort ºf people goes about in Broughams,”
said Miss FLORA, with a toss of her head, “we don’t want no ladies in
our house:” and she flung her impertinence out of the room.
The note was signed FRANCEs NIGHTINGALE,-whereas our NIGHT-
INGALE’s name was Louisa. But this FRANCEs was no other than the
little thing in the large blue sash, whom we remembered at Thornwood,
ever so many years ago. The writer declared that she recollected me
uite well, that her mamma was most anxious to see an old friend, and
that they had apartments at No. 166, Clarges Street, Piccadilly, whither
I hastened off to pay my respects to MRs. NIGHTINGALE.
When I entered the room, a tall and beautiful young woman with
blue eyes, and a serene and majestic air, came up to shake hands with
me; and I beheld in her, without in the least recognising, the little FANNY
of the blue sash. Mamma came out of the adjoining apartment presently.
We had not met since—since all sorts of events occurred—her
voice was not a little agitated. Here was that fair creature whom we
had admired so. Sir, I shall not say whether she was altered or not.
The tones of her voice were as sweet and kind as ever;-and we talked
about Miss FANNY as a subject in common between us, and I admired
the growth and beauty of the young lady, though I did not mind telling
her to her face (at which to be sure the girl was delighted), that she
never in my eyes would be half as pretty as her mother.
Well Sir, upon this day arrangements were made for that dinner
which took place on Wednesday last, and to the remembrance of which
I determined to consecrate this present page.
It so happened that º: was in town of the old set of whom I
have made mention, and everybody was disengaged. SIR SALVATOR
RoDGERs (who has become such a swell since he was knighted and got
the cordon of the order of the George and Blue Boar of Russia, that
we like to laugh at him a little) made his appearance at eight o'clock,
and was perfectly natural, and affable. Woodward the lawyer forgot
his abominable law and his money about which he is always thinking:
and finally DR. PIPER of whom we despaired because his wife is
mortally jealous of every lady whom he attends, and will hardly let him
dine out of her sight, had pleaded LADY RAcksTRAw's situation as a
reason for not going down to Wimbledon Common till night—and so
we six had a meeting.
The door was opened to us by a maid who looked us hard in the face
as we went up-stairs, and who was no other than little FANNY’s nurse
SIR
her except Woodward the lawyer, and all shook hands with her except
him. Constant study had driven her out of the lawyer's memory. I
don’t think he ever cared for MRs. NIGHTINGALE as much as the rest
of us did, or indeed that it is in the nature of that learned man to care
for any but one learned person.
And what do you think, Sir, this dear and faithful widow had done to
make us welcome? She remembered the dishes that we used to like
ever so long ago, and she had every man’s favourite dish for him.
RoDGERs used to have a passion for herrings—there they were: the
lawyer, who has an enormous appetite, which he gratifies at 9ther
eople's expense, had a shoulder of mutton and onion sauce, which the
eam and hungry man devoured almost entirely: mine did not come till
the second course—it was baked plum-pud I was affected when I
saw it, Sir-I choked almost when I eat it. PIPER made a beautiful
little speech, and made an ice compound, for which he was famous, an
we drank it just as we used to drink it in old times, and to the health of
the widow.
How should we have had this dinner, how could we all have assembled
#. again, if everybody had not been out of town, and everybody
had not been disengaged? Just for one evening, the scattered members
of an old circle of friendship returned and met round the old table again
—round this litle green island we moor for the night at least,-to-mor-
row we part company, and each man for himself sails over the ingens
acquor. -
Since I wrote the above, I find that everybody really is gone, away.
The widow left town on Friday. I have been on my round just now,
and have been met at every step by closed shutters and the faces of
unfamiliar charwomen. No. 9, is gone to Malvern. No.87, 15, 25,
48, and 36A, are gone to Scotland. The solitude of the Club begins to
be unbearable, and I found MUGGINs this morning, preparing a
mysterious apparatus of travelling boot-trees, and dusting the port-
manteaus. -
If you are not getting on well with the KICKLEBURY's at Hambourg,
recommend you to go to Spa. MRs. NIGHTINGALE is going thither
and will be at the Hotel d’Orange; where you may use, my name, and
resent yourself to her; and I may hint to you in confidence that Miss
ANNY will have a very pretty little fortune.

PUNCH'S CHEAP EXCURSION UP AND DOWN
THE NILE.
You start from Piccadilly. It has long been a matter of doubt which was
the real source of the Nile. That doubt is for ever set at rest,-it is the
umbrella-stand of the #. Hall. Never mind about band-boxes, carpet-
bags, or trunks—travel for once without luggage. Goup that dirty staircase
on your right, enter that darkroom and you are on the steamboat which is
starting fºr the Nile." Be quick, or else you will be too late. -
#. city you observe through the chiaro-obscurois Cairo. There is no
capital in the world which is “so well off for soap,” for it has no less than
seventy baths; but this must not be wondered at, for, if you recollect, Egypt
was the land where the pail of civilisation was first discovered.
The houses at Cairo are like, those in Sussex Gardens in
the Regent's Park. They are all doomed, and they are quite ugly
enough to be so. -
Those minarets may, possibly, give the city the heavy, sombre
look it has, for any one can see wit an eye that there is
“the weight of Care (oh!) on its brow.”
The Mosque of SgºtAN Tooloon is well worth notice. The
ascent is on the outside by a spiral flight of steps. The idea was
doubtlessly taken from the Lyceum Theatre, which, when it was
built, was found to have no staircase to its gallery. A fire-escape
had * be run up outside, and does duty to the present day for an
escatter.
The women at Cairo ride about on donkeys, just like the
English ladies at Blackheath. It is astonishing how much the
Egyptians have borrowed from us. The decorations of their
houses even are stolen from our Gents' shirts, for if you remark,
they are ruled with thick lines of red ink, which, en passant, is
about the ugliest front a man can live under. -
We must * them, however, their camels. No animal can be
more strongly marked with the bump of originality. We will
back it in that respect against the whole animal creation.
You will have an opportunity here of hearing an Egyptian
barcarole. We cannot say much for them. We cannot imagine
MARIosinging, “Ya mellawanee,” or “Gey, ho, heeleyza / " which
latter we guess is only the Egyptian for the costermonger's friendly
exhortation to his steed, “Gee woe, you º !”
We now come to Memphis, which was formerly called Moph,
or Muff, and the colossal hand of red nite which is now in the
British Museum, originally came out of this Muff.
Round Memphis are sixty-nine Pyramids. It must be confessed
there never was, and never will again, such a “nation of
bricks” as Egypt!
Two of the Pyramids of brick have temples attached to them.
This clearly must, have been suggested by our “Brick Court,
Temple.” t thieves those Egyptians were !
One of the Pyramids has a great hollow in its back. Probably
this has been owing to the “weight of ages,” or it may have been
that the “forty sentries,” whom NApolºgn placed on the top of
its head, were more than the poor Pyramid could bear. By-the-by
those forty sentries must have been Bedouin Arabs, or else they

EQUITY FOR THE ARMY.
It is stated “on undoubted authority” that the MARQUEss of
LoNDonDERRY has felt himself called upon to instigate the Queen
to recommend MR.HEALD of the 2nd Life Guards to . his
commission for having married LoLa MonTEs. If a gentleman
who has merely contracted a mésalliance is not to be tolerated in
HER MAJESTY's service, à fortiori, no one can be suffered to
remain in it, who shall run away with another man's wife; and,
moreover, we should think, equity requires that if the former is to
be obliged to retire quietly from his corps, the latter shall be
condemned to be drummed out of the regiment.

THE MILITARY MARCH OF
INTELLECT.
(From an Original Drawing made expressly for this Work.)
WE are happy to find that the progress of education in the Army is
commensurate with the bold and vigorous steps in advance that have
been taken by the proper authorities. The arithmetical class has
already arrived at 12 times 12, and the drawing division has gone so
far that drawing for the militia is quite easy work compared to the
result of its labours. We have been favoured with a few specimens of
A CONDITIONAL AMNESTY.
According to the Times, when the QUEEN's carriage was passing
through Parkgate Street, Dublin, a MR. T. NUGENT approached HER
MAJESTY's vehicle and-mistaking himself, probably, for the Irish
eople-exclaimed. “Mighty Monarch, pardon SMITH O’BRIEN.”
his ridiculous gentleman appears to have formed his conception of
the British Monarchy from witnessing the conduct of sovereign poten-
tates, in melodramas and burlesques, wherein they are represented as
hanging, banishing, or pardoning, at their mere and pleasure,
offenders, on the impulse of the moment. He could not have been
aware that the prerogative of mercy is always exercised by the Crown
under advice; or else he behaved like a very impertinent Snob, in
trying to make it a personal matter with the QUEEN. If he wished to
intercede for O’BRIEN, he should have petitioned the throne through
the Home Office, or that of Mr. Punch, or some other regular and
accredited channel. -
And were Mr. Punch applied to with such an object, he does not
know that he should not be inclined to advise the Sovereign to forgive
O'BRIEN, MITCHEL, and the whole batch of trumpery traitors who were
engaged in the late º conspiracy against her crown-upon this one
condition. Every man Jack of them should be obliged to read carefully
through the report of the Royal Progress in Ireland. It would be a
sufficient punishment to them to see, in the loyal manifestations of their
countrymen, how miserably contemptible has been their failure in the
attempt to get up arebellion,
At the same time, Mr. Punch would feel bound to counsel HER
MAJESTY to extend the same mercy to the ginger-pop conspirators;
and whilst letting off 9'BRIEN, to restore poor little Gurry, the tailor,
to his goose; recollecting the just equality of sauce which is proverbially
due to goose alike with gander.

A NEw move has lately taken place in theatrical matters. A company

A CATHEDRAL WITH A BAD NAME.
THE world may not require to be informed by Punch that two his-
torical accounts of this wonderful metropolis, each excellent in its way;
one entitled “The Town,” by MR, LEIGH HUNT, the other called
“The Handbook for London,” by MR.PETER CUNNINGHAM ; have lately
been published. Perhaps, however, the readers of the works in question,
and of Punch, may have omitted to notice, in connection, two remarkable
statements, one regarding Old, and the other concerning New St. Paul’s,
MR. HUNT and MR. CUNNINGHAM respectively. “Old St.
Paul’s,” writes M.R. LEIGH HUNT, “throughout almost the whole
period of its existence, at least from the reign of HENRY THE THIRD,
was a thoroughfare and a den of thieves.” “At New St. Paul's,” says
MR. PETER CUNNINGHAM—whose authority may always be depended
#. the cost of admission is, to view the monuments and the body
of the church, 2d.; whispering gallery and two outside galleries, 6d.;
ball, 1s. 6d.; library, great bell, geometrical staircase and model room,
ls.; clock, 2d.; crypt and NELson’s monument, ls.; total, 4s. 4d.” It
is clear, therefore, that according to the above ºr. New
St. Paul's differs from Old St. Pauſ's only in not being a thoroughfare;
for the former obviously deserves, no less than the latter, to be styled a
den of thieves. -

IT seems expected that Paris will, every now and then, require to be

occasionally, have to be put in a strait-waistcoat. Accordingly, a Com-

a bill framed to make arrangements for imposing that restraint when
necessary. The subjoined paragraphin the Times, relative to the report of
this Committee, was conveyed by electric telegraph, which in communi-
cating it must have inflicted a decided shock on every lover of freedom.
“The Committee recommend that the state of siege shall be declared not only in
case of war or insurrection, but likewise in case of imminent peril to internal or ex-
ternal security. The Committee refuse, moreover, the privilege of trial by jury to the
proprietors of newspapers charged with a violation ºf the law on the press.”
Verily, the fratricidal destruction of the Roman Republic begins to
be avenged in double quick time ! Paris to be subject to martial law at a

Mr. Pips
Tuesday, August 7, 1849—Finding Fault with my Wife, for that she
do not use enough Exercise;..whence her continual Headach, and
FADDELL, the 'Potticary his Bill of £5. She º that I would
never take, her out, I said I would, whenever, she liked; whereupon,
we agreed to go a Walk forthwith, and my Wife did propose Regent
Street. So we thither, pleasing ourselves with observing the Passers-
by and the Carriages, though their Number do now begin to diminish,
and the Streets do, daily blaze less and less with fine Ladies and flaming
Liveries. Going by LINDSEY AND Woolsey's, my Wife's Eye taken
with a Scarf in the Window, and would stop to look at it with a Crowd
of other Women gazing at the Finery, which MR. SKITT do call
Baits, and a Draper's. Shop a Lady-Trap. Presently she recollected
that she wanted a Collar; so, we into the Shop, where some sixty or
º Ladies sitting before the Counters, examining the Wares, busy
as Blue-Bottle Flies at a Sugar-Cask. Behind the Counters the
Shopmen and Assistants, showing off the Goods, and themselves also,
with mighty dainty Airs, every one of them, almost, NARCIssus his
Image. But I fear me they owe their pale delicate Looks and languid
Ways, in Part to the Want of sufficient Air and Exercise; which is a
sad, Consideration. One of these dapper young Sirs did help my Wife
to her Cºllar, cost 3s.6d.; when she thought she had better get
another while about...it, cost 3s.6d, more. Then, says he, in his soft
condoling Voice, “What is the next Article?” as though taking for
granted that another was wanted—which was too true. #. hereupon,
my Wife bºº her of lacking some Lace Cuffs, four Pair:
cost 12s. “ now, Mem,” (meaning Madam) says the young
Fellow with a Simper, “allow me to show you a Love of a Robe, a

at One-and-Four less; and i. then saying that it was indeed a
Bargain, which I find is a Woman's Word for anything cheap whether
wanted or no, I let her have it; cost £1. 0s.2d. But, to be sure, the
Pattern was pretty, and my Wife being well-dressed do please my Taste,
and also increase my Consequence and Dignity. The Robe bought,
it comes into her Head that she could not do without a new Shawſ to
match it, blue and scarlet, cost £2.2s., but will look .# fine, and,
I hope, last. Here, I thought to walk her at, once bodily away; but
seeing a stout, middle-aged Gentleman doing the very. Thing, and how
mean it looked, did forbear; and in the Meanwhile the Shopman did
beg, as he said, to tempt her with a superior Assortment of Ribbons.

her some Silk Stockings; and I telling her they were unnecessary, she
declared that then she must wear, Boots, which she knows I *

NEWS FROM THE SEAT OF WAR.
ETTERS have arrived
from Vienna of the
18th. A sanguinary
engagement has been
fought at Szuglok, be-
tween the 23rd Rus.
sian Corps commanded
by GENERAL Nob-
Glog, and the Tran-
sylvanian force under
GLZAKcs. The action
began at six o'clock
in the morning, by the
blowing up of the bas-
- soon bridge over the
Garglwºo; on which
the élite of the Hon-
ved cavalry, with their
Chief, KIDNski, were
posted. This brilliant manoeuvre at once put the intrepid Pole in possession of the tete du pont,
situated in the midst of the Carpathian range, where, the whole of the enemy's luggage had been
écheloned under a feeble guard | Uhlans. Up this height the Carawacz Grenadiers charged with
the bayonet nine times, with irresistible impetuosity, headed by FIELD-MARSHAL LIEUTENANT PRINCE
TittgenstEIN, and the Russian General SLöBBERs. The fire of the enemy's howitzers was so murderous,
that the tassels of the boots of our gallant Hussars were shot off three times in the course of the
action. Cockharoff's regiment was here severely punished whilst operating on the left flank of the
enemy at Q'Glanders. ...Our loss was 2 killed and 3 wounded: whilst the enemy paid dreadfully for his
temerity, leaving on the field, 4000 Honveds, three battalions of Carpathian Rangers, literally cut in
pieces, and 286 pieces of artillery, besides those lost in his tumultuous flight across the river. The
3rd Russian division (SHouzoFF's) marching into action, singing the well-known air, “Gobno strodpol
slok slab.olgo,” was described by an Austrian officer attending with the corps of GENERAL SLOBBERs as
awfully impressive. After singing that well-known melody, the old Russians are known, never to
f. or receive quarter. They were accordingly cut down to a man on the ground they occupied. And
aving been lately provided with new uniforms of which the 4th division (BouTzoFF's) were1.
in want, as the latter had been compelled to fly from before Comorn in their nightshirts, when KIAPKA
made his midnight, sally from that fortress, GENERAL BouTzoff at once ordered them into the clothes
of the SHOUzoff division, and lost no time in pursuing the victory.
The insurgents were commanded by BEM, who was wounded early in the action, and, flung himself
shrieking with pain, and with a few desperate followers, into the morasses of Squalch, whither our
troops are hotly pursuing the defeated partizans.
The FIELD MARSHAL PAsKIEwitch is at O Fidls; DEMBINSKI is at Hasch with 30,000 insurgents,
rfectly surrounded by Fogamow's 28th Russian division, and the corps of SLECKNADEL and SKINK.
H. Jews of Q Schäve cheerfully brought a contribution of 80,000 great coats and 2,000,000 of florins
to GENERAL HAYNAU, who is received with open arms wherever he goes.
Rumours have arrived of a great battle fought on the 19th, when the united force of DEMBINsk1, BEM,
and KLAPKA were utterly defeated by the Prince Field Marshal at Temeswar. Gyorgy was
wounded early in the action.
M. KossuTH is at Stigidin. The infuriated Magyars tear up his notes, and fling them in his face.
He has had the cholera, the jaundice, the yellow fever, and the small-pox. He has been deposed, some
say assassinated, by the populace.

GREAT HUNGARIAN VICTORY.
OUR letters from Vienna are of the 18th. Another glorious success has attended the Magyar arms.
Another battle has been {..". not the great battle which ere this must have taken place on the
Maros, where the Hungarian eaders have united a force of 125,000 men and 639 guns, and by a series
of masterly evolutions have enveloped LUDERs, outflanked PaskIEwitch, and º, turned
HAYNAU's left, so that Strongwo, the former pivot of his operations, becomes merely a barrack for
36,000 of his best men—not the great battle which ere this has settled the war, but a brilliant and
decisive victory which must inspirit every friend of freedom.
From the lying Austrian bulletins we gather quite enough to show us that the Imperialists have been
utterly routed in the º in which they pretend to have had the better. The battle took
place at Szuglok, where GLzakcs, with 30,000 Bulgarians, came up with Nobgiog's Russian division
and annihilated...it. The most notorious liar in the Russian army, as Nobglog is known to be,
Cannot be credited when he talks absurdly of having lost one grenadier aftermine charges with the
bayonet. The fact is, the Russians were repulsed nine times. CARAwacz was slain. TittgenstEIN
and SLOBBERs are most likely prisoners in the hands of the dashing and chivalrous GIZAkcs, and a
Younded officer...of artillery, whose letter has got out of the Austrian War Office, reports that
NoBGLog himself conducted himself with such shameful cowardice during the action, that the second
in cºmmand seized him by the nose, and publicly caned him in front of the Carawacz regiment. So
ºugh for NobgloG-the Emperor's favourite, the St. Petersburg dandy, and Czarko Seloe martinet.
If he survives the campaign, which he cannot possibly do, he will be knouted, his epaulets slapped
into his face, and he will be sent to the Ural Mountains." For Nicholas, though a depot, is a brave
one, as every Romanoff is.
SHOUzorr's brigade has been destroyed, the Austrians themselves own, to a man. Is this a victory?
We laugh such Victories to scorn. The truth of the matter would seem to be this: GLzAkcs pressed
severely, by the immensely superior forces of the allies, from his position at New Bogstro, took the
only course in his power, and fell back upon the Garglwºo, across which river he allowed the enemy to
|follow him. But as each division
arrived, his immensely strong artillery
enabled him to annihilate” tº the
SHOUzoFF brigade was destroyed; the
battalions, under CARAwacz pounded
into annihilation; and the frightful
sabres of the Magyars did their work
. the remaining Russian corps,
which was dispirited by the fate of
its defeated predecessors.
The Kossuth notes are at a pre-
mium. The cruelties of the Austrians
have been such that a magnificent
corps of 200,000 Jews have taken the
field in favour of the Hungarians, and
flocks of the persecuted people are
pouring down from all quarters of the
§. to rally round the ancient Lion
tandard.
[From the next day's paper.]
The report of an engagement be-
tween the corps of Slobbers and
NobgloG and the troops under
GLZAKCs turns out to be incorrect.
Letters from Vienna, of the 20th say
GENERAL SLOBBERs is still at Farcy,
while GLZAKcs, has not quitted-his
position at O'Glanders.
AGRICULTURAL FONETICS.
WE have extracted the following
lucid description from the account
of the Northumberland Agricultural
Show. It is taken literally, gs, ds,
and all, from the Newcastle Courant.
It is a beautiful little puzzle in its
way. We have read it backwards,
read it out, read it to ourselves
shaken it, translated it into French and
German, but all in vain, the puzzle is
too strong for us... We must write to
Bell's # about it. In the meantime
some of our readers, perhaps, would
like to try their skill upon it. Here
it is :-
“For the second best bull, 10l., to MR. J.
PockLING'ron, Senhouse, Netherhall, Ma rt.
Ploughboy, calved May 7th, 1844, by His Royal
Highness (4039), d (Playful) by Gainford (2044)

The reader will observe that there
are no less than eight-and-twenty gs in
the above puzzle. The mention of this
important fact may probably assist him
in guessing the answer to it.
The above extract, however, proves
one thing, for which all lovers of true
fun cannot be sufficiently grateful. It
is a pleasing proof that the Fonetic Nuz
is not yet dead.
Archaeological Impudence.
A MEMBER of the Archaeological
Association, we see, at a soirée of that
learned body held in the Town Hall,
Liverpool, delivered a Lecture “On
the Brass of SIR WILLIAM MoLYNEUX
in Sefton Church.” Really the Archæo-
logical, Association should stick, to
archaeology, and not attack private cha-
racter in this kind of way. What has
SIR WILLIAM MoLYNEux, done that
an archaeologist should take it upon
himself to make personal remarks on
the subject of that gentleman's brass?

MR. DUNUP's BoAT, As IT APPEARED witH HIM.
WE have just heard that our friend, MR. DUNUP-and, in fact,

ties he has to keep himself above water, become the owner of a wager.

or other, to “ É. up” against the tide of fortune. We fear that his

soon be aground, with his “boat upon the shore,” for if anything
“turns up,” it will be merely the craft he has been foolish enough to

A HINT FOR THE MILK TRADE.
... We have just hit upon an idea that will make the fortune of even
the most desponding of dairymen, and set firmly upon his legs, however
great may be the hobble he may be in, the owner of any Milk-walk.
. During the prevailing epidemic, we know that the favourite prescrip-
tion of the faculty—who, while differing in everything else, would appear
to be agreed in this—is a Chalk Mixture. Let any London milkman
come forward boldly and honestly to proclaim his new milk for what
it really is ; or, in other words, to paint his sky-blue in its true
| colours, and he will be a rich man in a week or two. -
The first milkman who has the courage to advertise his New Milk
from the Cow as the “Genuine Chalk Mixture” may º's
before him, and leave something handsome behind him for his family.
Episcopal Antipodes.
THE Morning Post lately published the following extract from a
letter relative to an Australian Bishop:-
“He lives in a cottage, goes about on horseback and on foot; always the Bishop, but
sºnsible and tolerant, and not disdaining to clean his own boots or brush his own
clothes when in the Bush.”
What would WARREN have given for such a Prelate to confer renown
upon a “Bishop's Blacking !” These are the Bishops for our money
-that is, for a trifle less than £10,000, or even £5000 a year. But we
fear such Bishops can only be found in Australia, as being the antipodes
to the Right Reverend Bench.
A Pope's Benediction.
.“THE Pope is to visit Albano,” says the Times, “and give his bene-
diction there to the French army.” We thought the disgrace of the
French army was complete, but there seems no end of its degradation.

Louis-NAPOLEoN has attempted this instrument with small success,
playing most desperate music. And England's, or rather Ireland's,
|MooRE O'FERRAIL of Malta is another melancholy instance of some.
thing worse than bungling. The past week has added to the list of
hurdy-gurdy offenders; and GIovaNNI GERAzz1 and Dom EN1co
GERAzzi, a couple of Italian padrones, are only worthy of the French
= |Consul, and the English Governor.
The GERAzzi were charged before MR HARDwick with ill-usage of
two little Italian boys, brothers, named Mazzochi. The poor children
had been farmed to the padrones, who were to pay for the human goods
10 and 11 francs per month to their rascal father. The children played
the ºº:: lived on dry bread and tea, with a little rice: when
they took home no money, they were flogged. They slept in filth:
their “sleeping shed,” testified a mendicity officer, “was unbearable.”
MR, HARDwick, to the great astonishment of GrovaNNI GERAzzi,
committed him to the House of Correction for one month; where, we
trust, his feet will play that hurdy-gurdy on a large scale—the tread-
mill. The children to be taken care of, and, as soon as possible, to be
sent back to Italy.
As yet there is no treadmill for Louis NAPOLEoN. He has traded
. glory's hurdy- º at Rome to the accompaniment of cannon-
shot and bomb-shells—he and his instruments have treated Roman
hearts, with a far worse ferocity than the GERAzzI wreaked upon the
small MAzzochI; the French Government has been more contemptibly
cowardly,–and where, oh, where, the treadmill for the offenders? We
must await the day. For as surely as there is a police-court for the
individual bully and ruffian, so surely is there the Court of Eternal
Justice for nations and governors. The seeds that shall grow the
treadmill for Louis NAPOLEON.—of whatever sort the punishment may
be—are sown, and fast º
we now to England's hope and representative at Malta, MR.
MooRE O'FERRALL. He is surely companionable, com meet for
the GERAzzi. Two hundred Roman refugees, with English passports,
ºiséd by the English Consul at Civita Vecchia, arrive, at Malta in the
French steamer Lycurgue, and a vessel called the Robin. They sailed
in the fullest belief of the protection of the English passport; for
many might have departed in the Lombardo for Genoa. ut no : they

emigrants were men and women; the sick and the wounded. Well
the Governor of Malta, contemptuous of the British passport, would
not permit the landing of the sufferers. He denied the boon even to a
child of thirteen, named ANDREA Follo, of Bassano: showing
kindred mercy to the ness of the ... farmers, the
GERAzzI. Only five of the two hundred refugees found means to sail
in the Ripon, for England: the remainder, by the last accounts, were
still in the Mediterranean.
It was otherwise, when the Governor of Malta was last year, be-
seeched by the Jesuits driven from Italy. They were permitted to
land; so gracious to the sons and preachers of pºliti and social
slavery was our English representative, MooRE O'FERRALL, , Doubt.
less, he will be honoured by the Pope, who will badge his noble breast
with a Roman order. No doubt, too, he will be defended by LoRD
BRough AM and the excellent ABERDEEN; but the people of England
will inflict on him their own peculiar brand—will link his name with
words not Parliamentary. the meanwhile, we would we might
entrust MR HARDwick with a mission from Marlborough Street, with
full power to erect a political tread-mill at Malta. The hurdy-gurdy
MAzzochi are avenged; not so...ANDREA Follo. Far luckier than
GiovaNNI GERAzzi is MooRE O'FERRALL.
The Sleepiest Medlar on Record.
THE Weekly News.inquires, “What has become of the celebrated Water-
loo Medal die on which SIGNOR Pistrucci has been employed at a salary
of from £350 to £500 per annum, ever since the year 1815?” Who wouldn’t
turn meddler, when it is a business so liberally rewarded ? Medlars,
we believe, become very sleepy when kept long, but SIGNOR Pistrucci
must be the sleepiest medaller that ever hung to a Government branch.
Not so sleepy either, when he has managed to pocket near upon £12,000
for one die, -which one die is not even finished yet, after a labour of
thirty-four years! We begin to suspect that SIGNOR PISTRUCCI's motto
must be “ R. say Die.”
Irish Consolation.
“WELL, PADDY,” said THADDY; “these Illuminations are the death
of Repale.”
“True, indeed,” said PADDY to THADDY; “but sure it’s an
iligant WAKE.”

LONDONDERRY AT THE HORSE GUARDS,
AND THE HOTEL,
THE MARQUEss of LoNDONDERRY
has once more walked into the
light of common print. He
is in in the newspapers.
shºe regret it? MoMUs
forbid! For the Marquess is
never dull. He is either the
hero or the victim of a joke:
and in this the flat season, with
LoRD BRough AM-like his
great prototype CINCINNATUs
among the turnips—far from
Courts of Appeal, and for
awhile regardless of the sweets
of cross-examination in delicate
cases, the Marquess in print
may be considered a public be:
nefactor; and let all the world
be ful, Punch, at least,
must him.
.The Marquessfigures inatwo-fold capacity. In the first he constitutes
himself the great moral assayer of the military wedding-ring. It is not
sufficient that that mystic circle have the mark, it must also carry
with it the sanction of the Marquess—must bear, at least for mess-
room validity, the LQNDONDERRY stamp. An ardent young Lieutenant
has, on the sudden, his heart ºf like a burnt cork, by a pair of
eyes mortally levelled at him in Hyde Park. He is at once done by
Cupid: for all Hymeneal purposes, the young officer, hke a Michaelmas
victim, is “cooked.” He marries a woman who makes a revolution as
easily as a housewife could make so much raspberry jam; and who
has no more awe of the ex-chancellor wig, than if it were trifle-cake.
Whereupon the MARQUEss of LoNDonneRRY, determining that the
“green one” shall be no longer “red,” cashiers the Lieutenant.
There is no sort of fuller's-earth, says the Marquess, that can take
such spots from the military cloth. Scarlet must not wed with scarlet.
The mess-room, must, be above suspicion. All very right. For
are not the morals of the armyº pure? Is it not patent to
an admiring world that any officer, from the cornet upwards, assessed
in “damages” in any case of conjugal untruth, is from that moment
dead upon the Army List? No sooner does a jury give a verdict
against the defendant, be he peer or commoner, than the culprit is
significantly, ordered to sell out, such an offender being held all un-
} worthy of the companionship of “officers and gentlemen.” With this
fact, before us, the MARQUEss of London perRy only showed a
Fºl. anxiety for the morals of the 2nd Life Guards; and in so
ar, for the immaculateness of the army in general, when he turned out
a young lieutenant, who loved not wisely, but—sinning by marriage—
loved too well. As Mrs. Peachum says—
“'Tis marriage makes the blot.”
There can be no doubt, had the lieutenant lured MRs. JAMEs from
CAPTAIN JAMEs, the seductive offender would have been ordered to
withdraw from military life...Therefore, it is but right that, having
married frailty, instead of making it, LIEUTENANT HEALD should suffer
the equal punishment. . How many military peers, how many colonels,
are at this moment piming, each under his withered laurel-tree, cash.
iered from the sweets of the mess-room, when found guilty in the
Court of Queen's Bench or Common Pleas! At least, the unfortunate
HEALD has, in his sorrow, many companions of higher rank, and more
aristocratic origin. He is in lofty company.
It is now pleasing to turn from the contemplation of military severity
—a discipline so necessary to the spotlessness of the army—and to
encounter the MARQUEss of LoNDoNDERRY in a humbler and sweeter
path of life, relaxing his mind—all unbent_from the adamantine rule
of the Colonel—by criticising atavern bill. The soldier tired “takes his
ease in his inn.” Falstaff, in his most liberal moments, was never so
condescending, so urbane, to the proprietor of the Boar’s Head, East-
cheap, as is VANE LONDONDERRY to “MR. BAKER, proprietor of
Morrison's Hotel, Dublin.”. Laying by his Life Guardsman’s sword,
that hath just scratched out the name of HEALD from the Army List,
the Colonel takes up his iron pen, and dipping it in sugar and water,
writes a certificate testifying to the cheapness of Morrison's Hotel.
Other men testify to the virtue of Morrison's Pills, but the Marquess,
soaring with his ". sings the praises of Morrison's Bills. The
Marquess certifies that the Marchioness and family, during HER
MAJESTY's happy visit to her Irish capital,—
“Have been surprised and pleased at the moderation of your charges, and the fairness
of your cuisiae and wines; and above all, it does you the greatest credit that you only
charged me for your best-suite of six rooms, and servants' ditto, the same price of 12.
for the week, which I paid to you three years ago, when Dublin was in a tranquil state,
and when I believe all other hotels doubled and trebled their prices.”
And the civil Marquess, thinking this “should be known,” gives
Morrison's º liberty to publish “this note.” Well, it is cre-
ditable to the proprietor that he should charge no more for Queen's
visits than at times of “a tranquil state,” and that too, “when " (for so
writes the noble pen) “other hotels doubled and trebled their pice."
tranquillity being, we presume, chargeable as a luxury in Ireland.
Corn-cutters daily publish noble certificates of the ability of the
operators. Following the high example, set by LoNDoNDERRY, peers
may give testimonials to inn-keepers. As thus:—
“I certify that the mutton-chops at the Bag-o'-Nails are cheap and
admirable; and he must be crass, indeed, who would turn up his nose
at the pickles. “BROUGHAM.”
“F. M. The DUKE of WELLINGTON certifies that a rump-steak at
the Blue Posts is a good, rump-steak. Potatoes good. Port good.
F. M., not eating horse-radish, will not testify to that commodity.”
“Iherewith declare that at the Plough a dinner fit for a true-born
agricultural Englishman can be obtained at the cheapest cost; without
any degrading obligations to the foreigner. The port wine, though
of sloe growth, is English. The claret has never crossed the Channel.
The brandy is the real British: the tea from our native hawthorn,
and the coffee, truly, bene. “RICHMOND.”
Thus, copying the example of LoNDoNDERRY, our House of Lords
may be the best authorities for our Houses of Entertainment. Anyway,
Morrison's Hotel is obliged to the MARQUEss, of . LONDONDERRY,
whose word, by the way, in such matters, should be of no small weight,
there being, throughout all Ireland, no better landlord than the
Marquess fº

THE MAnquess of Londondºn Ry, is reported to have said at the
dinner of the Dublin Agricultural Society-
“Ireland has received her Sovereign with enthusiasm, nay, with intoxication.”
The Company cheered most lustily at this, and entered so fully into
the spirit of the charge, that they fined themselves 5s. all round.
The amount was paid the next morning into the poor boxes of the
different police offices, under the head of “Conscience Money.”
However, if Ireland, as the Marquess says, was “intºxicated” on
the occasion of the QUEEN’s visit, it is most highly creditable then that,
out of the million cases of intoxication, there is but one instance
known of an Irishman forgetting himself

THE BUS CONDUCTOR'S GUIDE.
.ON, the same principle that he who “drives, ſat oxen should
himself be fat,” we think it may be fairly argued, that he who conducts
be able to conduct himself. . Few people consider
how much they are in the power of the 'bus conductor. Qur progress
in life depends upon him, and fortune itself may as well be blind to our
necessities, if the 'bus conductor refuses to let us catch his eye when
we are anxious to avail ourselves of his assistance in getting forward to
our goal. Our comfort and our convenience—to say i. of our
change out of a shilling—are to a great extent in his hands. We have
therefore heard, with intense anxiety, of a book said to be forthcoming
on the subject of A Conductor's Duties, including not only what he owes
himself but what he owes his passengers, when he takes from them
more than the legal fare. We trust the contemplated work will contain
a chapter on that vexed and horribly vexing question, the geography of
Charing Cross. In defining its longitude, the conductors allow them-
selves the utmost latitude, and there
f). appears to be an impossibility in
M ALL THE WAY drawing the line, for there seems
A. really but one step from the sub-
lime (of Cockspur Street) to the
ridiculous (of the Strand). Charin
Cross proper is, we believe, bounde
on the east by the end of the tail of
the Duke of NorthumberLAND's
Lion, on the north by the nostrils
of GeoRGE THE FourTH's Horse,
on the west by the beak of the
Phoenix, who sits on half a hundred
of burning coals at the fire office,
and on the south by the ringlets of
- the unfortunate CHARLEs. The re-
- - sult is that when you are flush with
the lion's mane, at #. angles with the horse's nose, parallel with
the forehead of the Phoenix, or in a line with the martyred monarch's
wig, you are liable to be called upon for the additional three pence, and
in fact you never are safe in alighting, unless you do so within the
spray of the Traſalgar ginger-beer bottles, or under the shadow of
Nelson's cocked hat. - -
In addition to the settlement of the boundary question, we sincerely
trust that some notice will be taken of those pantomimetricks that
are frequently played off by conduc-

tion of the caterers, for Christmas
entertainment, as the trick possesses
the treble advantage of º
cheapness, and effectiveness. the
mere act of grouping a couple of
figures—the figure 3, and the figure
of the conductor—an announcement
of ALL THE way 2, may be converted,
on the alighting of the *†:
into “3d. to Charing Cross.” The
pantomime system of scrolls has for
sometime been in full force among the
conductors; and such are the tricks,
transformations, and substitutions that
take place between the passenger's
taking his place and vacating it, that
he would scarcely believe the omnibus he got into, and the omnibus he
is getting out of, to be one and the same. Twopences have been con-
verted into threepences; for by every 2 there hangs (concealed), a tail,
to turn it into a 3, when the occasion arrives, and the adroit introduc-
tion of “near to,” with other similar devices, will completely alter the
ostensible destination of the bus from that to which it purported to
be going when the passenger first took his seat inside.
Another WACANCY IN THE CITY.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
79
put down
MORE, ELIGIBLE OPPORTUNITIES.
IN cing over his paper of Wednesday last, any person in want of
an “ #.º.º.º. have found one perfectly ready for
him to drop into. In the first place there was that pattern ºf universal
benevolence, our old friend Y. }. offering to the whole world an “Op-
portunity” of realising 50 per cent. without the trouble of attendance,
on condition of £1000 being forthcoming from the individual wishing to
realise. We admire the considerate delicacy of dispensing with the
attendance of the possessor of £1000 after he has once part with that
trifle, and leaving the realisation of the promised 50 per cent, to be
accomplished by some process in which his presence will not be required.
In #. same column of the same paper, X.Y. has a philanthropic little
scheme, for giving a salary of £80 per annum to any young man with
£200 or £300, who will moreover enjoy, as an addition to his fixed
annuity, “a commission on all business transacted.”.
The amount of the commission is left indefinite, and as to the
“business,” Y.Z. would probably intimate that “that’s his business,”
if any too inquisitive applications should be made to him. Wehaye no
doubt that the young man with £200 or £300, availing himself of this
“Opportunity,” would in due time find himself in for “a very pretty
business” of one sort or another. --- -
For those, however, who have no faith in the proposals of Y. Z. and
X. Y., there is a benefactor ready, in the shape of A. B., who invites “A
oung man of capital wishing to employ himself in a Situation of
#. which is to be had by an imm e advance of £30 or £40 to
the benignant Alpha, who, it is to be regretted, should be “hard up.”
for such a paltry pittance. - - - -
As the nature of the “Situation of Trust” is not, fully explained, it
might be desirable to ascertain before parting with the required £30 or
£40, whether the “Trust” alluded to implies that sort of confidence
which is all on one side, and whether, in fact, it will have to be exercised
chiefly on those days when the salary should be forthcoming.
We are perhaps over-nice in these little matters, and there is no doubt
that the large-hearted A.B.'s, Y. Z.'s, and other would-be benefactors of
their race, would hurl back upon our heads—if they could get a shot at
us—our unworthy suspicions, but we, nevertheless, recommend a little
caution to those who are on the look out for an “Eligible Opportunity.”
We are perhaps more particular from having once known a friend who
500 to enable a sanguine individual advertising as P. Q.,
to carry out a grand object,” and the result proved, that P. Q. was
perfectly sincere, for he was himself the “grand object,” and he wanted
the £500 to “carry out”, himself to America. Since this little affair
we have been very particular in recommending all our friends to min
their P.'s and Q.'s whenever they are met with in advertisements of a
very promising character.
PUNCH'S CHEAP EXCURSION UP AND DOWN
THE NILE.
WE are now approaching Manfallout. You have just come back in
time to see the Nile change its bed. The lazy thing does not do this
with one good vigorous plunge, but after a series of leaps, as if it were
stretching its arms, and a number of whirlpools, that look like so many
yawns,—all proving what a sluggish river the Nile is—and how difficult
it is to get up.
The yearly Caravan that runs—or rather walks—from Darfur to the
Midland Counties of Africa, stops at Esiout. We mention this fact,
in case you may have anything to send to those distant parts.
We will now take a short stroll on the back of a Crocodile. This
scaly monster is usually waited on by a valet, in the shape of a small
bird, which is called, we cannot tell for what reason, the Sic Sac.
This valet runs on all the littie errands of the crocodile, tells it
where the largest eggs and the fattest sheep, are to be found, and
brings it word when there is a fine Ethiopian bathing close in the neigh-
bourhood. The crocodiles generally go about in parties of four, which
would almost lead one to suppose they were fond of a rubber of whist.
The Egyptians hung diamond rings in the ears of their crocodiles; we
do the same in the noses of our pigs, only their rings have no precious
stones in them—that would be indeed throwing pearls to swine. They
used to have tame crocodiles. Fancy CLEOPATRA with a tame crocodile
on her lap, patting it on the back, and feeding it with tamarind cake'
Let us change the subject...We have now reached This. This This is
an invisible town, so it is useless looking for it. It is sunk to the top
in sand, and it must be, we should say, a most highly-polished town.
By-the-by, since nothing now exists of it, but a ;y-top or two,
we suggest that This should be called That, for it is absurd to speak of
a town in the present tense, that has been dead and buried for years,
and probably is a mummy by this time. But if This does not like
That, it may take a French title, and write over its remains the following
appropriate inscription, “Immédiatement, sous presse, les Ouvrages con-
pletes de SAND.”
Do not forget to observe the noble tree, which of all others carries
off the Palm in the estimation of the Egyptian. Take off your hat to
it, for it is from this tree that we English get our Palm oil and
PALMER's candles. The fruit, we are told, has the taste of gingerbread,
which must be “fine nuts” for the little boys,
Right and left, up and down, look in any direction you please, the
ground seems sown with thick crops of Temples. It is true that many
of these crops have been shamefully trodden down by the heavy foot of
Time, but still there is an immense field of them left standing, more
than sufficient to yield to the archæologist, who knows how to separate
the tian chaff from the Egyptian corn, a most bountiful harvest.
Here he may read not only “sermons in stones,” but histories, whole
i. and, aided by the new light which the Fonetic Nuz has
- thrown upon the dark study of ºr. he may yet discover
in the mouth of some colossal statue the recipe for the long lost
“black sauce” of the Lacedæmonians, or accidentally find in the granite
ear. of some monster Sphinx the tunes which Old MEMNoN most
delighted to sing.
e are again º to halt awhile. We will rest for a minute
under the shade of the welcome Gemaiz, and enjoy, in peace the
national Kaif. , Repose is most needful in travelling in º: as with-
out it the mind would become quite petrified with astonishment at the
marvels it was continually called upon to digest in this wonderfully-
gifted country of millstones.
Next week we will finish our Cheap Excursion. Recollect there is
no additional charge for these delays. You pay 6d. to go to the Bank,
which is merely in Threadneedle Street, and we are sure you will not
object to 1s.-for that is all the fare—to see the two Banks of the Nile.
MATRIMONY AT REDUCED PRICES.
T the late Meeti
Parliamentary an
cial Reform Association at
Drury Lane, SIR. Joshua
WALMSLEY, the Chairman,
is reported to have said
in noticing the unus
number of Ladies in the
Assembly, that “he only
echoed the sentiment of
every gentleman present,
when he thanked them
gratefully for their coun-
tenance.” . Everybody, of
course, will say that the
countenance shown by the
ladies to the Association
was extremely handsome;
but we quote the remark
of SIR. Joshua WALMSLEY
not so much for the pur-
pose of getting a poor pun
out of it, as of making
some serious reflections
ăț fact to which it
tes.
We are glad to see that
- the bright eyes of Beauty
are now beginning to be opened to the necessity of economy; an
we hope that the maxims that may have been learned at the olitical
meeting will not be forgotten in the drawing-room, the kitchen
and the jeweller's and draper's shop. The principles of Financial
Reform, carried out by female resolution, will convert many an un-
comfortable fire-place into a happy hearth, and the exchange of expen-
sive tastes for saving virtues will be found by all, husbands to be, in
the truest sense, no robbery. We recommend the fair disciples of
Thrift to all persons meditating matrimony, who, we are sure, will
find them the dearest creatures in the world—but the cheapest of
Wlwes.
of the
Lady Match-Makers.
THE Daily News says:-
“The Queens of Prussia and Saxony, the wife of PRINCE Joint of Saxony, and the
ARchduchess Sophia, are two pairs of twin-sisters, to whose activity is traced much
that goes on in the political world.”
They are now match-making between the houses of Saxony and
Prussia. All well and good. Let them make love-matches that are
blessed by Hymen, and eschew the political that are tipped by Lucifer.

PUNCH,

ON CHARIV
LOND
A SMITH FIELD
-
We have seen excursions advertised lately, to suit every taste and
every pocket, from those who are able and willing to go and eat their
bifstek arrossée, with rhum, ale, and sherry in Paris, to those who have
ot a stray fourpence to spare for a return ticket in the iron excursion
É. to Battersea, but we have met with nothing yet that seems calcu-
lated to hit the peculiar disposition of those who find health and
pleasure in the Bucolic life of Smithfield Market. It has at length
occurred to us, that the idea borrowed from the business visits of the |
Commissioners of Sewers to the receptacles over which the preside
may be turned to the purpose of pleasure, by suggesting, that those
subterraneous excursions may be thrown open to those whose love of
ITE EXC URSION.
-
Smithfield air has caused them to contemplate with dismay the
removal of that great, nucleus of bad odours. An excursion boat
starting from Fleet Ditch, proceeding along the main sewer, and calling
at all the points of local interest, where the Thames receives its tribu-
taries of filth, would be extensively patronised by amateurs of malaria, to
whose noses the Péritable eau de Smithfield is a more fragrant bouquet
than the most delicious scent that ever dropped from the gutters of the
Cathedral of Cologne into JEAN MARIA FARINA's bottles. The sewers
will present many features of attraction to the lovers of nature, for the
land rat and the water rat may both be found in perfection in that
great mart of mud and concentrated essence of exhaustless effluvia.
PUNCH*S MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY.
THE measles having assumed the character of a prevailing epidemic
in Mr. Punch's nursery, a meeting of medical men was convened by
Mr Punch to discuss # nature and treatment of that disorder. About
fifty professional gentlemen attended at the Literary Institution,
situated over Mr. Punch's extensive office.
MR. PILKINs, M. R. C. S., took the chair at 7 o'clock, and was
su º: by MR. SLAB and MR. GRINDER. . -
The Chairman said, he would suggest that in the remarks which any
gentleman might offer, irrelevant details had better be avoided, and
that some fact or principle of importance, bearing on the subject, should
be established if possible. - -
MR. SQUILLs believed measles to be contagious, because a child who
had been to a school where that complaint was prevalent, had taken it
home to her brothers and sisters, who were previously healthy.
MR. SchuPLEs wished to know if measles had not broken out spon-
taneously in several houses in the neighbourhood, to which it was
supposed to have been conveyed in the case just mentioned? -
R. SQUILLs admitted that the disease had occurred in some in-
stances, to , appearance independently of any communication with
parties affected by it; but that circumstance had no influence on his
oplnion.
MR. CoNFECT, MR. HAUST, and MR. MIST had seen numerous
instances in which, when measles had been contracted by one member
of a family, it had been imparted to the rest. -
Pulv, MR.TINCT, and MR. ExtRACT had met with cases equally
numerous, wherein measles had attacked one individual in a school or
nursery, and had spared the remainder. -
MR. MAC PHUN recollected a case in Scotland where a single person
in a district was seized with measles, and all the others were left
Scot-free.
DR. GRAINs had great confidence in calomel as a remedy for measles.
He had tried it in one case, and the patient recovered. He therefore
considered it a never-failing specific. -
MR. MINIM said the calomel treatment had been tried several years
ago and ſailed. Until they knew something of the nature of measles it
was useless to go into the subject of its treatment.
MR. WIALs would mention two curious circumstances with respect to
the measles...The worst cases were those which he had been called up to
at half-past three in the morning; and the most favourable were those
that occurred on a Monday afternoon.
MR. SIMPLEs had seen eight persons out of ten recover under the
administration of infusion of senna.
MR. WATERs had known as many that had got well under liquor
pump.
}. Punch anxiously inquired if there was really no cure for measles?
Several gentlemen replied that there was not; but, nevertheless, they
treated it. -
It was them unanimously resolved that the subject required farther
investigation, and after the usual vote of thanks to tºº. the
meeting separated to attend their respective patients.
PREBENDS AND PASTRY.
IN times like these, when there exists a too prevalent disposition to
carp at the Clergy, and pick holes in the cloth, it is pleasing to meet, in
a public journal, with such a tribute to the clerical character as that
implied in the subjoined extract from an advertisement in the Times:–
O PASTRYCOOKS AND CONFECTIONERS.—To be disposed of, in
one of the best Cathedral towns, in the south of England, a Business, established
thirty-five years, and enjoying the patronage of the clergy and leading families in the
neighbourhood.
The prominent position assigned to these Cathedral Clergy—prece-
dence being given them over the leading families in the neighbourhood
—as patrons of a pastrycook, must appear remarkable, as an evidence
of their reputation for good living. ... But besides that, the predilection
of Prebends for pastry is a proof of the innocence of the tastes of those
Reverend Gentlemen; since a liking
with that extreme partiality to port wine, so generally ascribed to Deans
and Chapters.
THE NEWEST THING FOR A LONG TIME.
THE French have a proverb “Travailler pour le Roi de Prusse.’”
iking for tarts and buns is incompatible
which means “getting nothing for your trouble.” This is not the
case, however, with the Prussian Minister of Finance, for, in the Royal
§. which has just been delivered in Berlin, we meet with the
following most rare announcement in Royal Speeches now-a-days:–
“The country has not been so deeply shaken that the revenues of the State did not
suffice to answer even heavy requirements.”
The English of which is, we imagine, that, if there is no surplus, at
all events there is no deficit—a result which, as these times go, when
almost every State has been living beyond its income, is an unparalleled
achievement of financial economy. We advise Louis-NApoleoN to
tear a leaf out of the Prussian Ledger, and we recommend the Whigs
to send their Chancellor of the Exchequer over to Berlin, that he
may take six lessons in Arithmetic during the recess, and so employ
his leisure in the manner most profitable to his mind and the next
year's Budget.
The Nobility of Whitewash.
MR. RUSKIN, in his beautiful book, “The Seven Lamps of Architec-
ture,” says—
“Whitewash has so often been used as the dress of noble things, that it has thence
received a kind of nobility itself."
This can easily be proved by ascertaining how many bill-discounting,
horse-racing, stage-coach-driving, jockey-lords have availed themselves
of the privileges that are attached to this new order of nobility by going
through the Insolvent Debtors' Court. Many a nobleman, who has
been “out-at-elbows,” has not been able to appear in public till he
has received a coat of whitewash!

MELODY OF THE QUEEN IN IRELAND,
BY BRIAN BOROIHME's BARD.
I’d be rehearsin’ the great divershin',
And say excurshin' of WICTORIA famed,
Whin across the Channel, spite of John O'ConnELL,
Wid screw and funnel the squadthron sthamed.
On boord her yacht, in her silk and satin,
The Queen'sat chartin and takin' the air;
Whin afther the presage of an aizy passage,
FITz CLARENCE sint a message that they were there.
It was on a Friday, for ivir a high day,.
That our Gracious Lady made the Irish shore;
And ADMIRAL DIxon, for her profiction,
Blazed away wid blue lights and the cannon's roar.
The Corporation, in botheration, ..
Begg'd the QUEEN 'ud have patience till Satherday,
But notwithstandin’ PRINCE ALBERT commandin',
Insisted on landin', 'cause he wasn’t well at say.
So the QUEEN, in reliance on MISTHER Lyons,
Said she’d see the lions, as it wouldn’t be long,
And with hurried stitches at coort coats and breeches,
And loyal speeches they hammer'd along.
Like crathers mad run the Cork boys glad run,
To see the squadthron sthame up the Lee;
And I’m bound to mintion the condescinsion
And great ahtintion of HER MAJESTY.
It’s proud the Mayor was when he then and there was
Made a Knight ov the Garter wid the QUEEN’s own hand;
And in their coaches the Aldermen approaches,
And themsilves encroaches on the royal stand.
But the MARQUEss of THOMOND he wouldn’t let no man,
Much less a woman, come where she sat, -
Till the QUEEN, condescendin', begg'd he’d be mendin’
His manners, sendin’ the people out o' that.
Sure them. I pity that didn’t see Cork city,
Wid its recreations and lashins ov flowers;
The thriumphal arches of laurels and larches
On the line of march is beyant my powers.
Cork’s iligant sthructures and manufacthurs
Wid satisfaction the QUEEN survey'd,
And the height of º and generosity
Widout hanimosity to all display’d.
Wid banners sthramin', and people scramin',
And ladies cranin' from the windies round;
It’s the QUEEN might wondther if it wasn’t a blundther
To look for rebels upon Irish ground.
Next to Dublin City, upon the Liſſy,
The QUEEN in a jiffy her way did take,
And to #. her pennant, the #. Lieutenant
Wid Lords and Senators haste did make.
Sure no description or recollection
Could tell the 'ruction that at Kingstown came : ;
So#: s I’d betther not say who met her,
or SAUNDER's Newsletther could not recount the same.
From Sandymount ridge then, and over Ball's Bridge then,
And up to Bagot Street and Dublin Gate,
The QUEEN in her carriage, and her childther by marriage
With the noble PRINCE ALBERT, advance in state.
At an arch-way station, the Corporation,
Wid ARCHBishop WHATELY, was in the sthreet;
In ū. of prayin', she’d come that way in,
And also ow layin' the kays at her feet.
There was MisthER FitzGERALD, the stout City Herald,
In a coat widout sleeves blowin' fit to burst;
And none looked quarer than O'Dowd the Mace-bearer,
That thried would the Mayor or he get there first.
But the Mayor did push on wid the kays on a cushion,
And wid a blush on him made a speech—
But, by that same token, when the
Her discoorse was broken by the Aldermen's screech.
..] the remarkab
UEEN 'ud have spoken,
Myself I’d be throublin' to tell how Dublin
as boilin’ and bubblin' just like the say,
How pealer and sintry had to keep back the gintry
To the royal entry that iº 80 gay.
How the Phanix Park, sir, was like Noah's ark, sir,
Wid clane and unclane that did to it resort;
How she stay’d a long while in the famed Blind Asylum,
And how at the Castle she held her moble Coort,
Where, besides Lords and Ladies, I saw the O'GRADy’s
(That only in thrade is, set them up wid the great )
And a dale of Docthors and Ginirals and Procthors,
And loyal repalers, with their coats turned mighty nate.
Sure my time is past, sir, to sing of Belfast, sir,
And how the black North went clane mad widjoy
When she looked at their Qpinion, in a manner most winnin',
And bought Irish linen of Misther McEvoy.
So to end my narration of this grate celebration
Which the Irish nation has made proud and blest,
Here’s health and long life, boys, to QUEEN, mother, and wife, boys,
Who’s so good as all three, and as sich is the best.

PONTICAL CORMORANTS.
In the Preston Pilot there is an account of
the use and abuse of cormorants that are
made to fish in the Wyre. But—
“In order to prevent the gratification of their glut-
tonous inclinations, and to secure the fish which they
; succeed in catching, a strap is placed round the lower
part of the throat of the cormorant, which hinders the
swallowing of a fish of a tolerable degree of bulk, but
not of eels.”
Punch begs to recommend the attention
of the Reform Finance body to this cormo-
rant case. ...Why could there not be made a sort of strap, say from an
Act of Parliament, that, put round the lower part, of the throat of the
cormorant placeman and pensioner, should hinder them swallowing gold-
fish of the enormous size at * bolted, allowing them just a fair
sufficiency of nutritive silver ee
ANATOMICAL SCHOOL OF LINENDRAPERY.
OUR surprise has been excited several days during the last week or
two by the º of an advertisement in the Times, headed with
e words “DIssECTING CLERK,” and proceeding to state
that there is “wanted in a large drapery establishment in the country
a respectable young man as Dissecting º: who must be well ac-
uainted with drapery goods.” We are sorely puzzled to account for
the necessity of such an officer as a Dissecting Clerk in an establishment
whose operations, however extensive, would we think demand the
º of the scissors, rather than the use of the knife. ----
hat can a draper want with a Dissecting Clerk, unless in the milli:
mery department it is found º to cut up the bodies—of ladies'
dresses—as well as the skirts *. The mysterious announcement ma
perhaps have something to do with those “alarming sacrifices” whic
are iar to the linendrapery trade, and which seem to turn the
mildest, not to say the milk-soppiest, of occupations into one of the
most melodramatic of pursuits. It is indeed a regular bonneting of
horrors, with an accumulation of more horrors, when, in addition to
the usual batch of terrific announcements, as to “failure,” “bank;
ruptcy,” “ruin,” “slap dash smash crash,” we are publicly informed
of the existence of “Dissecting Clerks” in these drapery concerns,
where, though we have sometimes heard of “shaving the ladies,”. we
were not aware that the knife of the operator was ever brought into
requisition. We shall never, pass a cheap jº again without
iving a peculiar and horrible meaning to the words “alarming sacri:
ice,” and we shall look at such an intimation as “must be cleared off.
with a painful reference to the advertisement for a “Dissecting Clerk,”
which has suggested these comments.
A NATION OF ALFREDS.
Much credit has been given to our KING ALFREP for dividing his
loaf with the beggar, but equal honour. is due to the nation, which,
though Hungary, has given those Austrian beggars a bellyfull.
CoID WATER.—The QUEEN OF ENGLAND met with a heavy shower
on her approach to the shores of Scotland. . The President of France,
on his late progress, met with nothing else but cold water. The Pre-
sidential robes of Louis-NApoleon are evidently a wet blanket.

Mr. Pips
Thursday, August 16, 1849–This Aſternoon, about four of the Clock,
did walk in Regent Street, with much Delight... In the . Evening
to the Queen's House in the Haymarket, to hear MozART his famous
Opera “Le Nozze di Figaro,” and SoNTAG in Susanna, which she
do act mighty skittish, and with the prettiest sidelong Looks, but
the most graceful and like a Lady, and do trip the Stage the
daintiest, and make the nicest Curtsies, and .# the sweetest that
methinks I ever did hear or see: and to think that MR VIEUx-
Boys should tell me she do it as well now as he did see her twenty
Years ago! Pretty, to hear her sing “Venite, inginocchiatevi,” where
she do make Cherubino kneel down on the Cushion before the
Countess, and put him on a Girl's Cap, and path's Chin and Face. Also
her singing of “Sull'Aria,” with PARODI, the Countess, dictating the
Letter to her; and PARODI did sing well too, and the mingling of their
Voices very musicall. Likewise that jolly blooming she-BAccHUs
ALBoNI, who, was Cherubino, with her passionate fine singing of “Non
so più” and “Voi che sapete,” and all her singing, did delight me much;
and she did play a Stripling of a Page in Love to the very Life.
BELLETTI did mightily take me with his Knaveries, in Figaro, and
singing of “Non piú andrai,” which is a most lively and martial Song;
and the Grand March very brave as well, and did make my Heart leap
and me almost to jump out of my Seat. Colletti, too, the Count, did
content me much, and to the utmost in “Crudel / perchè finora.” But
then to hear LABLACHE, what a great Thing he do make out of so small
a Part as Bartolo, with his Voice in the Concert-Pieces heard above all
the rest, and thundering out La Wendetta,” like a musicall STENTOR;
and his undertaking of little Characters to make an Opera perfect is
very magnanimous; and MR. WAGSTAFFE do well say that he “Ingentes

Mighty droll to hear the Quartett, with each Singer in Turn holding
the Voice on the word “ Io,” called for three times, and the Singers
each Time spinning “Io” out longer, whereat great Laughter; and the
Performers laughing as much as the Audience. Wonderful, how still
all the House was while SoNTAG was a singing of “Deh! wieni non
tardar,” and the Brapas and Clapping of Hands when she had ended;
and what did as much as anything please me in her Singing was to hear
how she did stick to the Text, and not, like a vulgar silly prima Donna,
disfigure noble Musique by ridiculous Flourishes. The House extra-
ordinary full, though the Season over; and to compare the fine Fore-
heads and Faces of an Audience come to hear good Musique with the
insignificant Looks of mere common Opera-Goers! Methinks I could
never hear Figaro often enough; the Overture being such prett
Fiddling, and all the Musique so beautiful, and heavenly almost, wit
several of the Airs as innocent and angelicall as Hymns; but to think
that all these Pearls are strung on so vile a Thread; the Intrigues and
Trickery between a Count and Countess, with a Waiting-Woman, a
Page, and a Lackey: a Story that do seem to have been hatched in a
Servants' Hall!. The Ballet aſter the Opera pretty, and a Scene of
Skating on the Ice, very natural, did end with the Skaters pelting each
other with Snowballs, and look pleasant and cool this hot Weather.
Home to Supper, it being late, though, walking # the Haymarket, did
sorely long for stewed Oysters. Telling my Wife of the Opera, did
speak of Susanna boxing Figaro his Ears, and let out that I could have
been glad to have her box mine too, which my Wife did say she could
do as well if I pleased; but I said Í had rather not, and so, whistling
“Non piú andrai” rather small, to Bed.

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
THE BERMONDSEY HORROR.-THE COMMODITY OF MURDER.
GoD's lightning pursuing murder is become a true and active thing.
What was a figure of speech is now a working minister. A phrase in
the mouth of poetry, is now a familiar presence—a household retainer,
doing hourly errands. We have brought devastation into servitude;
we have made a bond-slave of destruction. Thus, Murder has hardly
turned from its abomination—scarcely set forth upon its shuddering
flight, when the avenging lightning stays the homicide.
arvellous is the poetry of our daily life! We out-act the dreams of
story-books. ...The Arabian tales are flat, crude gossip against the
written activities of our social state. Sindhad, with his wonders, so
many glories about him, is become a dull fellow, opposed by the electric
workman-the Čerk of the Lightning. . . . . -
Murder, with its black heart beating thick, its brain blood-gorged,
reads the history of its damnation. Hundreds of miles away from its
ghastly work, Murder in the stupidity of deepest guilt—for the greater
the crime the greater the folly that ever as a shadow accompanies, and
betrays it—Murder, with forced belief in its impunity, reads its own
doings chronicled and commented upon in the newspaper sheet; and—
so far away from the victim's grave; the retreat so º assured
the hiding place so wisely chosen—Murder draws freer breath, an
holds itself secure -
—And the while, the inexorable lightning—the electric pulse—thrills
in the wires-–and in a moment idiot Murder stammers and grows white
in the face of Justice. In the marvellousness that sublimates the mind
of man, our Electric Tales make poor work of the Arabian: Solomon's
Genii may sleep in their brazen kettles. They are, in truth, the veriest
smoke compared with the Genii of the Wires.
In the contemplation of this last atrocity—a horror that, traded upon,
seems to taint the wholesomeness of daily life; for, in every yariety o
utterance, Murder cries to us in the public streets—in this last great
wickedness, there is matter for sad congratulation, for mournful thanks-
giving. An abomination is committed, and—so wonderful are the means
of apprehension; so sure and so astounding in, their operation—and
É. as but a few gasps of fancied freedom, and lo! guilt is captive.
nsidering the certainty—the fate that travels the wires—we take
hope that from the self-conviction of discovery—from the disheartening
belief that there is no escape—no evasion from the consequence of
crime, the miserable wretch tempted to evil, will turn in his mind the
many odds, and refrain upon the lowest principle—that of calculation.
This is something. The murderer in mind who would not be stayed in
his guilt by the thought of aſter lightning—may pause, awed by the
thought of lightning ready—the unerring telegraph.
And, in the present hour, there is another cause of mournful pride to
the English nation. It was a solemn business, a stern and awful work
begun, when the Fire Queen, with her black flag of smoke, stood out
from Portsmouth; bound to cross the Atlantic if need were—to stay
and overhaul the Victoria, freighted with the curse of Murder. There
is a fine, stern lesson in this; a noble sermon, preached eartempore to
embryo crime. Justice at the Home Office makes the wires speak,
saying to a certain Admiral,—“Send a fast-sailing ship to sea, that
retribution may be done upon bloodshedders.” There is something
solemn, awful, in the warning uttered in this. It says, to crime, -
“Though the sea encompass you; though you have baulked pursuit,
and Justice—like a hound at fault—beats and gropes conſounded; though
you have begun to count the profits of blood, and how to make the most
of them; how, in your new country, to live a life of impunity and ease,
—nevertheless, give up the dream; dismiss the vision, and awake to
horrid truth. For there, in the horizon miles away, is a thin dark
vapour—the man at the mast has seen and reported it—and, with every
ten minutes, it becomes more distinct, and now the distant gun is
heard across the water, booming command; and the ship's yards swing
round;—she lays to ; and—how rapid the ceremony, how brief the
time ! and Murder, aghast and manacled, is made again to turn its face
towards the land it has outraged with the sacrifice of blood.”
And so far we gather a sad satisfaction from a consideration of the
Bermondsey horror., All else is matter of disgust and loathing. , Again
Murder-Market is begun; again Homicide Fair opens its devilish
shows. The rag-pickers of crime are at work, and we have, and—save
in the lull that precedes the Sessions' opening, shall continue to have
as daily, weekly fare, the past and present doings of a man and woman
accused of a crime infernal-doings told at the longest, to make the
greatest show; presenting to the sense of the purchaser, the fullest
pennyworth. Small, indeed, is the single evil of the one life lost, to the
#. iniquity committed upon the moral health of society, when
urder is made the staple subject; when a tale of bloodshed, set
forth in every sort of phrase, and exhibited by every sort of means,
assails us at every step. At this moment, refined, civilised,M.

Frenchmen have, within these few days, written upon the dreariness of
an English Sunday. ...“To pass the day all alone,” says M. GAUTHIER,
“withºut a light at the bottom of the well of the Great Pyramid, i.
preferable to a. Sunday at London.” Ha! Monsieur GAUTHIER,
doubtless, you timed your visit at an unlucky season. It was not in a
time of diabolic murder. Otherwise you must have owned that a London
Sunday is not without a certain excitement. There is a part of the
Sunday press that, for the delectation and improvement of serious
English families, makes areal murder as fascinating-flavouring it with
the hottest spice of style—as though written by your own $UE as
though patched and stolen by F. Qwn DUMAs... Nor are the literary
graces without the §§ of the Fine Arts: Murder has its R.A's;
and the respectable English family may contemplate the countenance of
the human butcher; may consider, the cut of his coat, and the tie of
his neckcloth;-all these things being sought for with the earnestness
of truth, and set forth with the anxiety of thrift. And so, the English
public, is made to pet a criminal. To hang him certainly inj:
is in the hanging that we have the interest; but to pet and cocker him,
and take a world of pains in him until hanged; and then to enshrine
his effigies, and treasure as a curious thing the hat he wore—the shoes
he trod upon.
Good MADAME Tussaud, ...; art to homicide, turns to the plea-
Santness of profit the abomination of blood. With her so much murder

usiness. ...Every day in the newspapers MADAME Tussaud offers to the
heads of families and their little ones, “Rush the Murderer, taken
from life, at Norwich, during his trial, in his usual dress!” Every
morning do we behold the miscreant gibbetted in the newspaper column,
with the intelligence that the wretch is the last new tenant of the
Chamber of Horrors, to be seen for only an extra sixpence. The
ordinary exhibition,
so forth, is one shilling; murderers, sixpence more. Blood, like con-
#|dinents at a meal, must be paid for extra.
Thus considered, the crime of murder—as traded u

as nothing to the ſº mischief arising from the marketable uses
made of the wickedness. The murdered man O'Connor bears—"in

Shall we not, in due season, have engravings of the murderers?
Take the eighteen wounds of the yictim, and multiply them a thousand

GEMS OF ADVERTISING LITERATURE.
UDGING from the Times, there
never was such an opportunity
for the “opening out ’’ of
those who are prepared for
“opening out” their pockets
in a spirit of confidence. The
gems of advertising literature
are indeed diamonds, and, al-
though the ink converts them
into black diamonds, they are
no less brilliant on that ac-
count. We have not far to
dig for these gems, and a
single copy of the Times of
one day last week, furnishes
us with some rich, though by
no means rare specimens.
In the first place we find
that highly favoured class, the “Elderly Gentlemen of. Fºrtune”
tempted by “a lady who has met with many misfortunes” with the
offer of “a cheerful and commodious home,” the lady's multiſarious
“misfortunes” having failed to deprive her of that buoyancy of spirit,
which would enable her to cheer such “elderly gentlemen” as may be
ossessed of sufficient fortune to pay for the delightful privilege.
§. confess we rather doubt the result, for speaking only from our
own experience, we have found quite enough to do with a simple case
of “Woman in Distress,” but we greatly fear that a lady with “many
misfortunes” would prove utterly unbearable. -
The same column from which this gem is selected contains another
unctuous morsel of female melancholy in the shape of an announcement
composed, of kings and queens, philosophers and

The funnels might surely be made available by having rows of seats
placed all round them, and as it may be observed that the more
dangerous a place looks to be, the more eager the public will be to
crowd into it, there would be no difficulty in filling the funnel at
perhaps higher fares, under the pretext of keeping them as “reserved
seats,” for the more exclusive among the passengers. The rudder
would also admit of a row of stalls along the top, and one passenger
might be permitted by previous booking to occupy the place usually
devoted to the figure-head, which should be rendered movable expressly
to admit of such an arrangement.
We have no doubt the Thames Steamboat proprietors will present us
with a day ticket to Hungerford, for having given them the hints for
further accommodation, embodied in the suggestions and sketches that

A LAMENTABLE CASE OF DISTRESS,
A Book has just appeared with the title, “What shall I do with my
Money?”. We are laughing in anticipation at the countless answers this
poor gentleman, will receive as the proposed, remedy for his extra-
ordinary complaint. Every swindle, every bubble, every humbugging
scheme about town will be writing to him, ..ºf him by all means to
As the poor fellow will naturally be
puzzled out of so many answers to know which one to choose, we will
give him our advice.
“If you are wise, my dear boy, you will keep your money.”
But upon second thoughts, we think we can advise him better.
“If you do not know what to do with your money, we recommend
you, my dear fellow, to send it to No. 85, Fleet Street, where we know
a certain gentleman who will be happy to invest it for you to the very
best advantage. For fear of mistakes, the gentleman's name is
Mr. Punch. He will be happy to relieve you in your present distress,
charge you nothing for it, *} send you into the bargain a copy of his

This author must be a great original. If he were to exhibit himself at
the Egyptian Hall, he would make more money than he really would know
what to do with, for he is the very first person to our knowledge, who,
during the last two or three years, has had any money. The secret is

of comfort.
Since it appears impossible for the authorities to prevent the steamers
from taking an unlimited number of passengers, we presumethat the public
must be left to probe the evil one of these days on their own account, by
diving deeper into it some day than may be found consistent with safety.

PUNCH*S PEACE PRIZE ESSAYS.
PUNCH perceiving that some societies of the Peace Congress are
giving Prizes for Essays in furtherance of pacific principles, is happy to
present them with a brief list of subjects, which he conceives may be
worked advantageously for their great cause, namely:-
1. On the Sensations attendant on the Entrance of a Bullet into any
sensitive Part of the human Body, and accompanying its Extraction by
the Surgeon’s Scalpel: Also on those which, when lodged in some Bone
or Joint so that it cannot be removed, it continues to excite for Life.
2. On the Feeling of having the Knee crushed by a Cannon-Ball,
and that of subsequently undergoing Amputation; and on the State of
a Man's Existence who goes about with a wooden Leg.
3. On lying with mangled Limbs on a Field of fºule and having
them trampled on by a Troop of Horse. -
4. On the Variety of Maims and Mutilations to which a Soldier is
liable, and their Aſter-consequences with Respect to Comfort and
Enjoyment.
Papal Gratitude.
Sweet is it to chronicle acts of thanksgiving and gratitude of the
great ones of the earth, among whom it is undeniable, are Pius THE
Pope to Rome, and the Pope restores the Holy Inquisition. And
the Pope, out of conscience and tender, heart offers to his champion,
when his Presidency shall have expired, the post of Secretary of the
Holy Office. When Italian liberty is to have a taste of the thumb-

THE ANTIQUITY of EUREKA SHIRTs.
WHAT are Eureka Shirts? The word “Eureka” signifies “I have

“They’ll find linen enough on every hedge.” These, we suspect, were
the original Eureka Shirts.

THE WAR CONGRESS.
VER in opposition to the

of the War Congress last
week took place in London
around a table in the smoking-
room of a crack club. The
assembly consisted of above
half-a-dozen young military
entlemen of Fashion. The

body at 8 o’clock, and after
cigars had been lighted,

IEUTENANT PhIPPs did

called it, of Peace, to go about º: in that way was absurd.

CAPTAIN DE WrrT would suggest hemp-twist; for all the set de-
served to be hanged.

A HOME FOR DESTITUTE YOUNGER SONS.
THE Morning Chronicle, in speaking of the Government of Ceylon,
says, “LoRD Top RINGTON was appointed because he had family claims,
was poor, and required out-door relief.” It is a great pity something
cannot be done at home for the benefit of these pauper Lords. Why send
them abroad where § only commit irreparable mischief. We should
like to see some workhouses—or rather, clubs—established for the
Younger Sons of the Nobility. They should have every luxury—a billiard-
room, a smoking-room, a concert-room, -a stable and a couple of
horses each. The income of every member should not be less than £500
a year, and white kid gloves à discrétion. This would be cheaper than
finding secretaryships, and j." s, and ambassadorships, and
every other ship excepting hardships, for them all over the world.
Every pauper lord should be eligible to these almshouses, upon his
pledging his word, not to meddle with Government. Qut-door relief
might occasionally be administered to the poorer class of the nobility,
to consist of haunches of venison, and pots of currant jelly, twice a week,
with daily supplies of cheroots, snuff, grog, the newspapers and eau de
Cologne. What a blessing such a charitable institution would have been
at the time LoRD TorringtoN was sent out to Ceylon, ...That talented

A TRIPLE FOR GEORGEY.
WE understand that the EMPEROR of Austria, by the advice of the

GREAT RAILWAY ATTRACTION.
THE South-Eastern Railway Directors are trying the puffing system

Eastern “dodges,” which has been much in favour during the last
year, has been the bold catch-line of,
“PARIS IN 12 HOURS.”
Since, however, a correspondent of the Times has shown that the
"12 hours” in theory, amount in practice to 29, the public will not
henceforth be taken in, or rather taken out by the South-Eastern
Railway; at least, when rapidity of travelling is the object of the
tourist. We should recommend the Company to try the other tack, and
adopt the enough-for-9ne's money” line of advertisement, by showing
how the greatest quantity of time, and the smallest amount of cash,
may be spent on the route between London and Paris. With this view a
series of attractive posting-bills might be got up with such catch-lines as
“CIRCUITOUs RouTE,” “cuRves of BEAUTY” “PLEASUREs of
THE ROUNDABout; ”
and stress could also be laid upon the opportunities of being present
at the

MORE AGRICULTURAL FONETICS.
MANY of the prizes at the Agricultural Shows are astonishing in
their small mysterious way. For instance, in our profound Cockney
ignorance, we cannot help expressing our astonishment at the following
| prizes given at Morpeth, in Northumberland.
First of all there was, £5 for the best pen of 10 gimmers.”

AN advertisement now lying before us, headed
“BATHs of Hom BURG, near Frankfort-on-

other attractions pertaining to these Baths, the advertisement mentions
the following:—
“A new club has been established this year, to which strangers are admitted, and in
which the games of treate-et-quarante and roulette are played, the same advantages
being reserved to the players as in former years when the public was admitted indis-
criminately.”
We are afraid that the Baths of Homburg near Frankfort-on-the
Maine, savour too much of the Main and the Deep: We have no
objection to aquatic exercise in safe water, but had rather not indulge
in rolling at roulette and sportively gambolling at trente-et-quarante,
exposed to the peril of sharks. Assuredly the Humane Society would de-
signate the Waters of Homburg as “Dangerous.”. Give us, in preference,
the straightforward bathing of the Serpentine. We suspect that people
resort to Homburg, not to improve health but to stand the hazard of the
die. It is to be wished that the advertisers would call these Baths by
their right name, or at least be correctin its orthography, and when next
they put their puff in the papers, change ointo u, in “ Homburg.” and

NEWSPAPER MEDICAL LITERATURE.
REALLY, ordinary newspapers ought to let medical science alone.
The following article, which appeared in one of our contemporaries, on
a case of pulmonary disease, is calculated to have a very pernicious
effect, by diffusing the most erroneous notions respecting the nature an
treatment of that dangerous class of maladies:–

Hospital, her mother was told by a medical gentleman, “that he scarcely thought she
would live to reach home.' Her father, then, as a forlorn hope, commenced rubbing
her chest, sides, and loins, with Holloway’s Ointment, and gave her these famous
Pills twice a-day, which, to the surprise of all, saved the child's life and effected a perfect
cure.-See Advt.”
To speak of “a Bad Cold that had settled on the Lungs,” is to
indulge in a very loose kind of medical phraseology. The assertion
that a patient “was reduced to a mere skeleton, owing to a violent cold,
grossly unsound pathology. From the punctuation of the sentence, it
is evident that the pulmonary and hepatic diseases are ascribed to the
emaciation; whereas that phenomenon, had it been actual, would have
been the consequence of those affections, if they had existed; both of
which circumstances we doubt.
The medical gentlemen at Bartholomew’s are too well versed in
diagnosis to have made the remark attributed to one of them, except on
a º in the last stage of consumption, bronchitis, pericarditis, or
other organic or active disease, who would be curable neither by the
pills and ointment of HollowAY, nor by those of anybody else. ...We
protest against a statement tending to recommend the treatment of any
such disease with those medicines; a species of practice which would
almost certainly be followed by fatal results. The representation that
the child's life was saved by Holloway's pills and ointment, is, we
believe, wholly false, even admitting there was a particle of truth in the
case. We must add that the style of the writer is utterly unprofessional,
and we could almost fancy that this monograph of his upon catarrh was
one of those puffing paragraphs which certain unprincipled journals, for
a consideration, allow to be inserted by Quacks.
An ALARMING STATE OF Things.
WE see advertised in the morning º “Ladies’ Wests.” We
cannot imagine what a lady wants with such a thing, but this gradual
invasion of the gentleman's attire begins to alarm us. They have already
stolen our paletots, they now seize upon our vests. Gracious goodness!

know if the Homburg Baths have under.
We reserve, however, the most astonishing thing of all for the last.
It beats all the Fonetics we ever read; and we cannot make out how
such things appear in print.
Here it is in its disgraceful literalness.
To Robert Brown, 53 years in the service of MR. SELEy, a prize of £3.
That is to say, 53 years of service are rewarded with less than a
“pen of 10 gimmers!” We can imagine RoRERT BRowN almost
| regretting he had not been born a “gimmer.”, “$3 for 53 years of farm-
service l’” It is not fourteenpence a year. No wonder good servants
are so scarce!
Of all Ariº, Fonetics, the prizes to servants are the most
unintelligible. It is time that the Lords and Dukes who preside with
such patronage at these Shows, began to put a little English sense into
them; and, if they put a little i. money also, the generosity
would be generally welcomed as an act of good sense. At present, it
hurts one to read, “fº was given for 53 years' service.” Such a para-
graph is a disgrace to the age., Our greatest astonishment is, that the
wealthy chairman who presided on the above occasion, ever allowed it
to pass. Who would have thought it of a princely nobleman like the
Duke of NoFTHUMBERLAND F
POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE PARIS PRESS.
SoME, of the Parisian Journals are exemplifying, the practice of
Political Economy by a new system, which consists of a rigid economy
with reference to their own political articles. The plan saves a vast
deal of trouble both to writer and reader; for the former simply re-
publishes what he has written before, and the latter is of course spared
the necessity of reading it. -
| Consistency in a political writer is a very fine thing, no doubt; but
we think there are very few subscribers to a newspaper who would
on taking it in while the writers merely reprinted their old articles for
the purpose of showing the durability of their principles. Frequently
when the cry of “Copy” is ringing in our ears, and the printer's imp
is waiting below—while we wish him lower still—at such a moment it
would often be a boon to us to be enabled to say, “Reprint such and
such an article which we wrote five years ago, for our sentiments
remain the same as they were.” But alas! we know full well, that
the public will not take even from us, “too much of a good, thing;”
and that it is by providing an interminable succession of good things,
that we retain our hold upon the hearts, the minds, the affections, the
feelings—and oh! must we add the threepences!—of the world in
general.
| We dare not imitate our Parisian contemporaries in the repetition of
an article, a paragraph, a sentence, or even a line, that once been
sent forth; nor could we hazard even the announcement, that “in con-
jº. of the immense and astounding success of our last new joke, it
I shortly be repeated.” So strong and conscientious are our scruples
against º: in, the shape of re-iteration in, those . which
some poet has described by happy anticipation, as “ever sparkling, ever
new,” that we sometimes grow almost indignant over our own adver-
tising page, and feel tempted to tear out the “real gentleman's head
of hair’ by the roots, and issue our external leaf in a bald state, rather
than allow the “real gentleman's head” to get a permanent footing. 3
Arts and Murder.
We are in truth a very domestic people. No sooner is an atrocious
murder perpetrated, than the wretch becomes an object of the greatest
social interest. His birth, education, early habits, are all a matter of
daily import. It is a pity that art is not criticised with the same
minuteness as homicide. Carve a magnificent statue, and our most
enlightened press will devote the smallest of paragraphs to the triumph;
cut a throat, and lo! there are half-a-dozen columns!

A TEDIOUS SPELL OF IT.
We cannot be surprised at the serious misunderstanding that has occurred
on the subject of Hungary, when such a simple thing as “a few words” must
ead to a most serious misunderstanding, inasmuch as not one of the few
words we ever saw can be understood at all, and, indeed, we have seriously
damaged our dexter superior molar, in an attempt to utter a sentence.
An effort has been made by one of our contemporaries to furnish a key
to the virtual lock of the jaw under which we labour, when attempting to
give loose to the Hungarian tongue, but we gather nothing beyond the facts
that o and u are liable to dots, and that the acute accent determines whether
a vowel is long or short, but with all our acuteness, we cannot make out the
long and the short of it.

attended by Mr. BiRch, rode out on horseback.” This announcement
suggests a congratulatory remark on the progress of Royal education. JAMEs

REPAIRS NEATLY EXECUTED.
It appears;hat the French had in view some other less harmless
restoration than the restoration of the Pope, in their recent
ceedings at Rome, for they have been lately caught in the act of
endeavouring to restore some of the works of art, that contribute
to the lustre of the Eternal City. It is rather hard upon the origi-
nators of these immortal specimens of art to be, as it were, chiselled
out of their stilloutstanding instalment of renown, by having their
best, works handed down to future, generations in such guise—
such egregious guys—as those to which º are reduced by the
French restoration party. A work of art had need to be immortal
indeed, if it can outlive the treatment to which the artistic im-
provers are in the habit of subjecting all which they lay their hands
upon. Nihil tetigit quod non poliavit, may be the motto of any
|one of these gentlemen, for everything added is exactly so much
taken away from the object tampered with. - -
We have not heard the precise extent to which the restoration
mania has been carried; but we can imagine the Apollo Belvedere
being changed into the Apollo Bruto-pedere by the French mode of
treatment. Perhaps the addition of a beard may have been perpe-
|trated in a spirit of bald-faced impudence: and the legs may be
encased in modern pantaloons, by an impulse of truly clownish
ignorance. We are sure that our readers will be unable to picture
for themselves such a desecration of art; and we therefore present
them with a picture from which we request they will turn away
with due horror, when they have once glanced at it. -
Perhaps after all, the truth may be, that the French consider
they owe the Romans some reparation; but if the debt is to be
id, by repairing their statues, it would be better to leave such
iabilities wholly without liquidation.

THE number and atrocity of the murders which have lately

is what night have been expected from the º of death
punishment, brought about by the mawkish sentimentalists.
Since making the above observations we find that we have been
dreaming, and while all these murders are in course of commission,
there is an execution about every week.

PUNCH's CHEAP ExCURSION UP AND DOWN
THE NILE. ---
THE traveller now begins to have the Second Cataract in his eye.
He will be pleased doubtlessly to learn that the cliffs on this bank are
composed of an extremely friable material. We never knew ourselves
that stones were subjected to the same process as liver-and-bacon, but
we suppose, when taken out of the frying-pan, they make a very good
stony batter. Qup SATURN, that tremendous lapidary, must have been
the inventor of this dish. -
The Egyptian towns are very hard to recollect. Their names, seem
to be a happy mixture of the Welsh and Hungarian. If they had been
called upon, like the Spanish towns in the time of Don CARLQs, to
have pronounced, they must have been completely dumb-founded, for
it is not so easy to pronounce a name that scarcely has a vowel, or a
liquid running through it. But probably the Egyptians wisely thought
as their principal towns were only cemeteries, with a large floating
population of mummies, that they were best described by mutes?... .
A curious race of people these Egyptians must have been Their
great end of life was Death. They were no sooner. born than they
thought about dying. The whole nation seemed to live in a sort of
forcing Pyramid. An º did not care so much where he º:
so long as he knew where he was to be buried. His greatest comfort
was the idea of being made a nice mummy of His card was an epitaph.
He was walking about with a tombstone º in his hand. In
fact, the largeness of the Pyramids is a standing proof, if proof be want-
ing, what a set of tremendous undertakers the Egyptians were ! Their
Present was the Future. This may partly account for their being so
much in advance of other nations. To speak extravagantly, the
seemed to calculate Time with a death-watch, which they wound up wit
a skeleton-key!, They made themselves in fact so familiar with Death,
that they invited him to all their feasts, and put him at the head of the
table at all their weddings, anniversaries, picnics, and grand ers.
It is but right to mention, however, one glorious exception to the above
rule! and that is the Egyptian Hall at the Mansion House.
Butlet us jump from grave to gay. We will have a tête-à-tête with
the Sphinx—the greatest blockhead that was ever known. It is supposed
to be a portrait of one of the RAMSEs, but we fancy it is much more like
the features of KEELEY, only not quite so stolid. In any case, KEELEY
or ProLEMy, it is the first portrait that was evertaken in stone. It is a
coloured portrait also, the cheeks being tinged with a fine port wine
glow. The colouring, we have been told, is done after Stone–one of his
earliest attempts at lithographing.
It is a strange freak to construct a statue to commemorate a riddle,
and yet not so strange either, when we consider what perfect riddles
our own statues are l
A phrenologist has never yet examined the bumps of the Sphinx.
We recommend that the British Association holds its next sitting in
Egypt.expressly upon that head.
If disappointed with the Sphinx, they might have a Matinée Musicale
with Mºxon, and listen to his singing "I drºant that I dwelt in
Marble Halls.” We have been informed there is but one fault in the
style of MEMNoN's singing, and that is, like many of our singers, he
sings too much from the head-otherwise when he is in good voice and
has not a cold, he goes higher than any one else, and his singing would
hºtel, all any national theatre, since it has repeatedly filled the
esert.
We are happy to be able to state in praise of this established singer,
that he has never broken an º yet, or refused once during
his ºf career to sing in his º e and place, for he has ever held
himself above temptation, and would never plead a “Sudden Indisposi-
tion” when he was invited out to dinner or a lobster supper.
..There are many otherstatues—some that are standing, a few that are
sitting, whilst several are lying down at fulllength in the sand or buried
up to their chins in it; and there are temples and º: also to

cutters. The Nile seems forum through a mason's * ... Everything

A CHANCE FOR HIGH-BORN LADIES.
º oME days since, the following |
advertisement appeared in the
~
o
Morning Post. It is evidently
the burst of a sympathetic heart
ready to fall in love upon the
shortest notice, with any lady
having the advantages catalogued
in the offer. Nevertheless, as
the gentleman, from the intensity
of his feelings, is now and then
somewhat, obscure, Punch has
ventured to make certain inter-
polations in italic for the benefit
of the advertiser:—
O UNMARRIED LADIES OF
BIRTH.-A Gentleman of ancient
family, and related and connected [a
double advantage; relatives not always
being connections] with both the Peerage
and the Baronetage of Great Britain, is
desirous to MARRY a Lady of good
family. He has never yet been in love
with any Lady of his acquaintance [but
has often been head-over-heels when in the
opera pit with lovely strangers in the
boxes], has travelled and resided for
years in various continental countries,
is an ex-military man, six-and-thirty
rears of age, and, though not handsome
Fº been tattooed in New Zealand in
early infancy], is by no means repulsive
either in appearance, habits, or manners.
He is a Roman Catholic (not Irish), but free from prejudice. The qualities he seeks for
in the Lady are, a sweet voice, anamiable, loving disposition, and the usual accomplish-
ments; also silky hair [no wigs allowed], good teeth [not from the dentist's], a pretty-
shaped bust (of any size), beautiful hands, arms, feet, and ankles, and to dress a la Fran-
caise. The age of the Lady is, in his opinion, a point of only secondary importance [any-
thing between sixteen and sixty, if with ankles], and, as tofortune, he hasnopretensions to
aspire to it, he himself having but a very limited income[nevertheless, nowoman without
funds can be treated º should these lines come under the notice of a Lady who is
similarly disposed, she is earnestly entreated by the Gentleman to write to him, as he
assures her that she may place implicit reliance in his honour to keep secret for ever
everything in the slightest degree connected with the affair. Tofacilitate an interview,
the Gentleman would come to any part of the kingdom [being a distinguished bagman,
and travelling at the expense of the firm, most convenient to the Lady. Letters to be
addressed (by post only) to —, under cover to —, E—eet, P-ace, L-.
Punch sent the above, duly interpolated, to the printer. In five
minutes the “devil” came in with the copy; and, as Punch conceived,
with a somewhat contemptuous glance and manner even for a Printer's
Diabolus, said, “La, Sir! you’ll never be gammoned by this... Don't
you see it’s only a myth—yes, Sir, a myth. The ºvertisement's from
no gent. at all, but from Mr. Jenkins, of the Morning Post, that wants to
marry Mrs. Gamp, of the Morning Herald.”

“PORTABLE * INVENTIONS:
We have all heard of “Portable Soup,” a small piece of which, no
bigger than a thimble, was said to be sufficient to lunch half, a dºzen
#. You could carry about with you any soup you liked: Mock
Turtle, the delicate Gravy, the vigorous Oxtail, the ardent Mulli-
gatawny, could all be had at a moment's notice, providing you had such
a thing about you as a handful of coals, and a grate to burn them i
besidesasaucepanto help you to melt your soup, and a soup-plate an
spoon, with gayenne, salt, bread, and pepper, to enable you to eatif, when
melted. All these little disadvantages may have tended to stop the
career of the “Portable Soup,” for, though promising, like most new
inventions, to go a very greaf way, it seems completely to have been
dropt, like one of MR. Chishop ºf ANSTEY’s motions, because no one
could be got to it. - - ----
Now we have “Portable Milk.” A small jar of this solidified mate-
rial we are told, contains the equivalent of six gallons of fluid milk...If
this is true, we shall be buying milk by the yard, or the º inch. We
shall be astonished in the morning with the cry of “Portable Milk, ho!”
—and the old pleasantry of requesting the aqueous milkman to “give
us the milk in one jug and the water in anºther, as we prefer mixing
it ourselves,” must soon become exploded. Anºther advantage will be,
the easy plan of testing our new, “Portable Milk,” when delivered, by
rubbing it slightly against the door-post; and if there should appear
to be any sign of º in its composition, not to pay the milkman his
score.
Wethink the rage for “Portable.” This, That, and Everything, has
been already º: enough. Didn't some maniac propose the other
day a “Portable House of Commons?” Just asif anyone could endure
such a thing, when it is as much as the nation cando to bearther resent

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
ORD BROUGHAM lays it down as his belief, that
the best way to bind MARs over to keep the
peace, is to be ready to maul the bully MARs,
when about to bluster. With his Lordship,
WULCAN is your best constable between
nations. Continuing amity is forged at the
sword-maker's ; an intermingling of best in-
tentions between state and state is fused, and
flows with the scorching, blinding metal that,
directed, forms itself into forty-two pounders.
Your hardy olive flourishes only in a soil
of nitre and brimstone, and the lips of assuring peace are the ports
that show the adamantine teeth of a three-decker. Fifty years ago,
the fine gentleman was no more to be seen without his sword, than
a scorpion without its sting. The true gentleman never, but as a
mark of courtesy, gave the wall:, he might need the , wall to lay
his back to, whilst with his yard of civil steel he made an eyelet-
hole or so in the body of a ruffling passenger. Very fine gentlemen
would now and then, in club or coffeehouse, take one another by the
throat, and the sword being at hand, a few chivalrous thrusts were
made, and one was killed, or one or both were scratched. And yet
the swords being ready, for such reason the gentlemen should not
have fought. The very sight of the steel should have counselled peace.
Both being º to kill, both should have amicably embraced. We
take it, such is the theory of the peace-makers who believe that War
can only go to sleep in a replenished arsenal: that War, to be made
nobody of, must have some fifty thousand troops and a fleet of the
line to do ceremony to his insignificance. Now, we do not see why
BULL and CRAPAUD may not take their swords from their sides, even
as their children, the descendants of the fine sparks of the Mall and
Versailles, have put away their daily iron.
LoRD BROUGHAM, assures the staring world that he was invited to
ut an olive twig in his button-hole, and make one of the Parliament of
}. assembling in the Hall of melodious St. Cecilia. Surely, the men
of peace could not, in any manner or way, have better shown their
simple truthfulness than by such invitation. . It would have been a
great, triumph in the eyes of the nations to show HENRY BROUGHAM
side by side with RICHARD CoBDEN. The eulogist of the blatant
brain-sick Pope, and poor *: King of Naples, shaking
hands with goodman STURGE. The hurler of senatorial thunder at
MAzzINI and such crass, forlorn folk, hob-and-nob with blacksmith
BURRITT. And we shall see this yet.—Another year or so, and when
| PREsident BuonapaRTE shall have been, turned inside out—when
every atom of the politic bran shall have been shaken from the re;
pºliº doll, and the rag worked with the NApoleoN name shall
!e a thing to make a leaf of paper for history—miserable history !
little worthier than cut-purse chronicle — then we may see Lord
BROUGHAM AND WAUx at the Second Peace Congress of Paris; arrayed
in robes of illustrative white, an olive branch twiddled 'tween his
finger and thumb, an olive garland, around his brows, and pacific
words—a rich distillation of milk and honey—flowing and continually
flowing from his tongue. . And this—we feel prophetic in the matter
—will happen in the reign or º: of King Somebody, or—who
knows?—in the reign of the People, by the grace of God made Wise
:
|
THE PARLIAMENT OF PEACE IN PARIS.
|
|
and Truthful among Themselves *
In the meantime what a simple farce is this Peace Congress! What
mild, serene foolery, philosophers of the stithy and the counter, sages
of calico and cotton-balls, meeting together and mumbling of peace,
and at the time the cannon belch contemptuous of the prattle ! Soft,
| drab-endued dreamers, who would dye red-coated war in their own
dismal tint, and make alike buttonless and swordless the brass-and-iron
soldier—dull-minded men, who do not behold in regimental feathers
the plumes of paradise; and with sacrilegious foot would kick a mortal
hole in the glorifying parchment of the muttering drum. “Poor souls!
| Their insanity is harmless”—says FRONTDEBOEUF of the Horse Guards
—“nevertheless, they should be put down. Asses, sir, revolutionists
and scoundrels—tradesmen, spinners, and all that. I wouldn't hurt a
hair of their heads, poor idiots' nevertheless, I’d shoot 'em all—for a
proper example—shoot every one of 'em.”
It is such high, gusty, smothery words that the Peace Congress
has brought down upon itself. The peace-makers of St. Cecilia's Hall
have been laughed at ; in a small way—threatened; and then dismissed
with a shout of contempt. They are harmless madmen—say the more
charitable—who would arm dragoons with cuirasses of straw; so let
them labour at their insane work, the while their moon is at the full.
And mad they would be, past the hopeless lunacy of Bedlam, did they
expect, with the fullness of success, to preach peace to all men. But
they have begun the sermon—this is something. They would make an
assent to the creed of peace the test of civilization. They must begin
somewhere. Hopeless they know it would be to preach peace in Russia.
The mission as yet would be a dreary jest in St. Petersburgh. What
then?
“The circle widens as the world spins round.”
France and England, with hand grasped in hand, are teachers that
the world must listen to. , Hosts may ground arms at such a spectacle.
The silent might of such mutual, amity, the assurance of the true
dignity of Christian men as taught by the Martyr of Peace—defies
the roar of parks of artillery. England and France hand in hand
may awe the world to peace. Their friendship is mightier than their
armies. Let the preachers of peace secure France, and they may
then give a turn to the globe and go on. As yet, we confess, Austria
must cleanse her human slaughter-house with many sweetening lustra-
tions, ere she can receive a Congress of Peace. And we have no hope
that men made of the red mud that forms a HAYNAu–the accursed
ruffian, upon whom the contempt of good men hangs like a garment—
can be brought to the Peace School, and made for good and aye to wash
their hands of carnage. If Joseph STURGE, visiting wild beasts, can
read the tigers and hyaenas from their evening meal—make them, with
a peace homily, crouch and listen, their garbage left untouched—then
may the Peace Congress hope to tame into human meekness, to convert
to Christianity, the race of bloodshedders that yet defile the world
for the curse of human kind, and blasphemously sing Te Deums—
praising God, when they do worst murder upon God's creatures.
Any way, the cause j peace has been reverently preached, and reve-
rently listened to, in the warlike city of Paris. Within a walk of the
tomb of the great peace-breaker—who turned kingdoms into graves, and
whose miserable purple was dyed in the heart's blood of human freedom
—even there º has been worshipped. With all the glory that, in the
ignorance of his abused nature, man associates with human destruction
—with all the splendour that reeks from a battle-field—(“God the first
garden made,” and the first battle-field the Devil)—with all the historic
º and fame besetting the tomb of NAPOLEoN, the deified soldier is
ut a ruffian of enormous mischief, tested by the great Spirit of Peace,
the Spirit that sublimated the looks of its first Preacher—the Spirit that
said, love one another, the spirit, that, under the cannon that engirdle
Paris, Fºlº peace and ºil to all men. NAPOLEoN in his violet
robe—beset with golden bees—the bees, that, as in the lion of the olden
day, swarmed in carcases—NAPOLEoN, with his Pope-blessed crown
clipping his homicidal brain, is, after, all, a portentous, glistering evil-
contrasted with our Quaker friend who, risen in the Hi of St. Cecilia,
condemns aggressive war as an abomination—a nuisance that it behoves
man, in this season of his soul's progress, with all his heart and all his
mind, to denounce and renounce, as unchristian, vile, and brutifying.
The drab against the purple; and, in our small thoughts, the drab, so
preaching, carries it. - - - -
And the Members of the Peace Parliament—most significant visit !

deified ignorance. This was a slight even upon the poor, thin shade of

TO PERSONS FOND OF REST.
“It is estimated,” says the Picayune,
“that only one-third of the gold col-
lected in California is actually exported,
the remaining two-thirds being re-
tained as a rest.” .
What this rest is may be gathered
from the following extract of a letter
in the Morning Chronicle:-
“We hear every now and them of one man
shooting another. Every man, even in the
towns, is armed with pistols and knife. At the
mines the Indians are shot down without
compunction, and I believe every enormity
committed that can be imagined. Madmen go
about the towns at largetill they destroy them-
selves.”
When we heard that the persons
who went to California were “mad
for gold,” we little thought it was so
literally. It seems likely that the gold
diggers will enjoy their “rest” in a
Lunatic Asylum. Their new coins
have the inscription, “Californian Gold
without Alloy.” . It is a pity they
cannot say as much of their happiness!

had come by and
overtaken him—in a very dreadful manner. Our reporter immediately
made for the spot, but, being unable to ascertain what spot he Qught
to make for, he put himself in communication immediately with all the
rincipal dog-fanciers, which enabled him to get at more fancies than
acts; and we therefore sent another reporter in another direction, for
the purpose of ascertaining other particulars.
[From our own reporter.]
It is too true that the celebrated fire-dog, Billy, who held a commis-
sion in the fire-brigade, has just breathed his last under the most
distressing circumstances; namely, under the wheel of an engine
which was proceeding to a fire at Islington. Billy was seen in his
usual health and spirits on Monday last, proceeding in the direction of
Clare Market, where he was observed to look rather snappishly at the
chump end of a neck of mutton, and having made a at it, he pro-
ceeded at a neck-or-nothing pace towards Fleet Street. In the course
of the same afternoon he was seen taking a social draught from the
waterman's bucket at Charing Cross, in company with a retired sheep-
dog of respectable connections, who lives upon his own resources near
Leicester Square, and amuses himself with the sport of hunting, which
is so much facilitated by the abundance of cats in the neighbourhood.
Our reporter, suspecting all was not right, followed Billy in the direc-
- --- - ead between
some iron railings in Watling Street, which is well known to be the
street where the **** of the fire-brigade are situated. Before
F. further with this, melancholy account, we think we shall
e ministering to the natural and wholesome curiosity of the public,
by giving a few particulars of the
ANTEGEDENTS OF BILLY.
. The fire-dog Billy was one of a respectable batch of seven puppies,
six of whom met a soap-suddy grave or sud-den death in an adjacent
slop-pail, at Islington. At the proper period he underwent the cere-
mony of being “wormed,” but as he was always tolerably quiet with
his tongue, it was rather difficult for anything to be wormed out of him.
He had not by any means attained the maturity of doghood when, he
lost his tail by an accident, but his tail being gone there was nothing left
—by which we
mean, that tail—is not to be relied upon. He first entered into public
life, as an attendant on a cat's-meat-barrow, where his integrity was
such that nothing ever passed his lips to the sacrifice of his master's
interests. -
The temptation of a pound of dog's-meat down, and a prospect of the
same salary per diem by way of diet, attracted “our hero” to the
fire-station, where he soon became as stationary as the place itself, and
he shortly began to join the fire-men in their attendance at the numerous
conflagrations, in and near the metropolis. Such was his zeal in the
service that while the man on duty has been frying a steak, of which
| Billy tº: got a mouthful, the enthusiastic dog has been known to
leave the frying-pan and run into the fire when an alarm has been given.
His invigorating bark, acted like a tonic upon the men while out on
duty, and Billy's death will leave a vacuum which their good-nature
will abhor as thoroughly as nature itself abhors an ordinary vacuum.
[Later Particulars.]
Our reporter, though so much excited as to be unable to collect himself,
has succeeded in collecting the following facts that may—or may not
-be relied upon. The dog Billy had gone out as usual for the purpose
of taking an airing at a fire at Islington, when just as he got opposite
the Angel, some fiend, or inhuman monster, in the shape of a º:
Seeing
his eyes, the poor creature gave a most significant look at the window
9f a glove shop, in which was lying a placard inscribed with the words
“Superior town-made dog,” which might have been applied to him as
an epitaph. The horse immediately ran away, but whether from the
pursuit of justice or not it is difficult to ascertain, and had he broken
from his harness all traces of him might have been lost, though, as he
was already collared, escape would have been impossible.
[Further further, and later latest Particulars.]
The horse, charged with the death of Billy, remains at the station in
Watling Street, where he has undergone a preliminary examination on
the subject, but he either remains mute or says “neigh” to everything.
The horse was formerly in the employ of a celebrated coal firm, where
he took a leading part, but he was got rid of as being much too fast in
his goings on for the jog-trot way of life in which his services were
required. He then joined the fire-brigade, but he was never much
liked by the men, who considered him rather weak in the understand-
ing, and were continually º: his fall in one way or the other.
The resident dog-ship at the Watling Sreet Station becomes empty
by the death of Billy, but it is impossible at this early period to say
who will have the vacant collar. -
In accordance with the prevailing custom of our illustrated contem-
raries, we have dispatched a draftsman to the residence of the late
og, with instructions to furnish us with a sketch of the now desolate
kennel. The object will not be very picturesque, but everything con-
nected with the late calamity will possess an interest for an ift:
British public—if we are to judge by the sort of pictorial fare that is
presented to them by those whose interest it is to meet the views of
their patrons with views furnished by their artists.
A LIGHT OF THE CHURCH.
ONCE upon a time there was celebrated a goodly auto-da-fé in the
most catholic city of Seville. -
by the fires of the church. “Dearly beloved friends”—said the Grand
Inquisitor pointing out to the faithful the shapeless stuff that was once
a human being– most pious people, I sorely grieve that out of the
very tenderness of my conscience—my love, for our burnt-up brother
(you heard how he yelled in the flames', I have been compelled to do
§. but the sad, the afflicting truth is this—I found him of an obtuse
intellect, of a lethargic temperament, and of a moral sense exceedingly
debased. And so—so I had him burnt to a cinder.”

scorches the hand of MARY BALL–(sentenced to die, and since executed)

lain some honorary distinction. "Such candle-light ought not to be
hidden under a bushel.
A WONDERFUL ASS.
SAMUEL Pepys, the illustrious ancestor of Punch's own. PIPs, immor-
talises the genius of a Bartlemy Fair horse that, directed by his master,
would discover from amongst a crowd the veritable gentleman who best
loved a comely wench. There is a more wonderful animal than this
horse, at the present moment in Paris; namely, an ass, the property of
an English firm. The ass—how it achieves the act we know not—has
the power of writing; and it is only a few days ago that it penned the
following. It duly appeared in the Morning Post:-
“The Peace Congress has been more crowded than ever this afternoon, and Stockport
and Manchester showed in mighty force. They who profess the creed of the deceased
MR. TAwell showed also in mighty numbers.”
An extraordinary brute that could have written this ; and yet we learn
there is nothing in its usual manner and habits that, distinguishes it
from the common jackass; save that it can hold a pen between its fore
ſººn beef to hay, potatoes to thistles, and goes to rest without
its shoes.
Latest News from Paris.
If Louis-NApoleoN continues his crusade against the Press, we
may shortly expect to see in the English papers a paragraph like the
following, under the head of “Foreign INTELLIGENCE.”
“As all the Editors are imprisoned, and every newspaper confiscated, we regret we
cannot make our usual extracts from the French press, as not a single newspaper was
published in Paris this morning.”

LOUIS PHILIPPE AND LOUIS NAPOLEON.
An ODE TO THE FORMER.
Ex-MonARCH of the Gallic race,
Poor dear old Sovereign out of place,
With me you once were in disgrace;
I used to scold you;
In reconcilement's fond embrace
Now let me fold you!
You were a little sly, indeed,
Inclined to avaricious greed,
Preferr'd the interest of your breed
Before your nation;
And sought its welfare with less heed
Than their dotation.
True, with your subjects faith you broke,
And your vexatious galling yoke
Their patience did at length provoke
To send you packing;
Your dynasty dissolv’d in smoke,
Your whiskers lacking.
But, as to jet is driven snow,
As is the swan unto the crow,
Louis PHILIPPE, are you e'en so
To your successor:
Beside the PREsident you show
A mild transgressor.
France has not you, old boy, to blame,
for amish'd arms and blacken'd fame,
Of that eternal scorn and shame
As the occasion,
Which he has brought upon her name
By Rome's invasion.
See her with Priestcraft's powers allied,
And ranged upon the despot's side
You ne'er your country stultified
In such a manner,
Causing all nations to deride
Her sullied banner.
à. you bore with rigid stress
Qn public speaking and the Press,
Discussion you restricted less
han this mere ninny,
The author of his country's mess
Of ignominy.
Who now rejoicing with the Czar,
Victorious in tyrannic war
Against the i. of the Magyar,
In freedom's ruin-
Yokes France and Frenchmen to the car
Of rampant Bruin!
—
THE PASSPORT SYSTEM COME TO A PRETTY PASS.
A VICTIM who writes to the Times, under the signature of “A Poor
Tourist,” complains of having to pay an enormous number of Pauls to
our own Consuls at Rome, Civita Vecchia, Genoa, and Leghorn, for a
wise to an English passport. We may boast of exempting foreigners
from this tax at home, but we take it out of our own countrymen pretty
freely abroad, and no Englishman, at Rome can have his passport
viséd without paying five Pauls to MR. FREEBORN, who º surely
blush at his own name when he receives this sum from a free-born
Briton. How a poor Tourist can manage to pay the exaction we don’t
know, for though it is sometimes the practise to borrow of PETER to
pay #Aul, it is very, unlikely that in a city ruled over by the alleged
successor of PETER it would be possible to borrow sufficient to pay
five Pauls to any one.
While we are taking credit at home for our freedom from the pass-
port nuisance, and its attendant impositions, we ought not to go on
incurring the disgrace of such exactions as are made upon our £i.
§: in foreign parts by the subordinate representatives of our
vernment.
FREnch LYING In Rome.
The Piedmontese Gazette says:–
“It appears that the French anticipate a long residence in Rome, as on the 17th an
order was given for 11,000 beds for their use.”
Every sort of bed, no doubt; save and except a bed of roses and abed
of glory.
THE ROMANCE OF THE SEWERS.
HERE are streams-may, rivers. of
gold—of gold and poison, flowing
under London. At present, so
careless of wealth is our unso-
phisticated generation, we take no
account of the treasure, in our
heedlessness of the alloy. If the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExCHEQUER
could be awakened to a sense of
the yalue of the sewers, he would
smilingly rub his hands over every
drain, as a source of a tributary
Pactolus. As it is, we poison the
Thames with much which, touched
by the wand of science, would
fatten and rejoice our fields.
MR. Dover has approached the Metropolitan Commissioners of
Sewers with a glorious plan. Dover—if his plan be a truth—is the
sewage MIDAs, without MIDAs's ears. He stirs the abomination that,
pouring from twelve Westminster sewers, defiles the Thames; stirs it
with his pen, and it becomes gold—hard gold. Out of only twelve sewers,
if Dover be a true man, he will produce in income-tax £200,000 per ann.
We ask SIR CHARLEs WooD,-is Dov ER a man to be neglected?
It is now an allowed truth that the Thames is defiled into a foul
ditch. Flowing through the city and Westminster, it waſts killing
miasma on either side of its banks. What in the good old times was
clear lymph, is now mortal liquid, in which only the skeletons of
departed sturgeon, the mere bones of plaice, are buoyant. This shows
what a Dead Sea, or rather a Defunct River, we dwell upon.
And what does MR. Dove R propose as a remedy? This. A tank
at the exit of every sewer to receive the sewage; whereupon, the
genius of science will disinfect the contents, and precipitate them
into pure guano. The disinfected supernatant water is also available,
says MR. Dover, as an enormous º ent. Westminster
alone would yield guano that would fertilise 300,000 acres, blessing
them, with a double crop. We pay £2,000,000 annually, for foreign
fertilisers; the while, we suffer the like amount of money (in mud and
muck) to poison the stomach.
Guano makes enormous turnips—turnips feed into flesh and beauty
enormous cattle. Contemplative reader, pause, and then weep to think,

A REAL BLESSING TO ANYBODY.
EveRY class of society comes in occasionally for its appropriate
blessing. The mothers have had their. Soothing Syrup; the shavers
their Plantagenet Razor; and in fact the advertisements of every day
present to our notice a real blessing to somebody; but an announce-
ment which we cut out a little time ago, and which of itself cuts out
anything of the kind we ever beheld, comprises in itself a sort of
blessing of the most extensive application. e give the advertisement
entire, to allow the advertiser to speak for himself; though we are
conscious our doing so will impart a weakness to anything we may
afterwards say for him:—
EDICAL-Amiable Country Practitioners-Any gentleman with the
above qualification wanting an M.R.C.S., as ASSISTANT, may be immediately
supplied by communicating with the advertiser through Mr. Age 27, gentle-
manly, of goodly stature, pleasing address, sweet disposition, patient of control,
unyielding perseverance, wakeful to a fault, and last, not least, looks upon large salaries
as a silate.
This short paragraph runs over not merely with the milk, but with
the actual cream of human kindness; and implies a state of things
almost Utopian, in which an amiable country practitioner,” and a
medical student of “sweet disposition,” are supposed to, form the
ingredients. The expression “wakeful to a fault,” is intended of course
to imply a tympanum painfully sensitive to the faintest vibration of the
wire of the nightbell; º: we do not see how wakefulness can be carried
to a fault, unless it includes a propensity to jump up in the middle of the
night, and walk about the house in the peculiar “costume of the period.”
e Fº admire the extreme delicacy of the concluding qualifica-
tion of the amiable advertiser, who “looks upon large salaries as a
snare,” though we are pretty sure that such traps are not generally laid
for medical assistants, and at all events, we never, heard of one being
caught in such a piece of golden netting. Wealth is proverbially a
snare; but he must be sensitive indeed, who believes that the highest
salary ever yet offered to an assistant by the most “amiable”, of
“country practitioners,” can, have about it any of the dangers that
attach to the possession of riches. We suspect the amiability of the ad-
vertiser amounts to a softness that is rare indeed in the class to which
he belongs, and which makes him really worth his weight in magnesia.

WHAT MR. JONES SAW AT PARIS.
[From the Own Correspondent of the Putney Patriot.
I HAVE often heard the Ocean denominated a treacherous element
and so it proved yesterday to be: for though its azure surface appeared
at first sight, and as we sailed out of Folkestone Harbour, to be as calm
as our own beautiful Thames by the shores of my native village of
Putney, yet I can tell you the calm was only on the surface, and the in-
terior of the ocean must have been agitated in a tremendous manner, for it
was all I could do to keep myself from being ill. Like that ocean,
however, I kept my countenance smiling and tranquil, whatever may
have been the commotions raging within my interior. There were
Frenchmen on board, who were convulsing themselves about the deck
and over the sides of the vessel in the most undisguised way; says I,
“It will not do to expose myself before them; I am an inhabitant of
Britannia, and as such, I naturally rule the waves.” But in spite of all
my efforts to keep down my feelings, Iown to you, Sir, it would have
been all over with me had our gallant bark been ten minutes longer in
making the harbour of Boulogne. - - -
The state of my feelings prevented me from judging of the appearance
of the town and coast as we neared it. There was a large pillar upon a
height, on the top of which column, as Ihaye read in history, NAPOLEoN
used to sit for weeks and weeks with a telescope looking, at England,
the home of the brave and free, and desiring that he might possess it:
there were two square forts on either side: there was the pier rushin
out into the ocean wave: there were houses with green shutters an
inscriptions in the French language and in our own tongue with which
I am familiar: there were bathing machines toiling down the level
sands until they reached ocean's brine, where I could see dim figures
in dark dresses flopping up and down in the water—all these I
saw but indis' inctly, owing to the agitation produced on my mind and
health by a passage at sea undertaken for the first time. At length our
vessel touched the quay, a rope was flung up by one of our mariners to
one of the bawling and bustling natives of the French coast who
crowded the shore; we were lashed to a French post, and in five
minutes more I stood upon continental soil. How my heart turned to
Putney then, and I thought of the beloved beings I had left behind,
both there and at Wandsworth !
Between two lines of ropes, me and the other passengers marched
with a resolute #. giving glance for glance to the crowds of foreigners
on either side of the ropes which hemmed usin. There were guards,
there were officers of the Customs, there were men in the rough garb
and red night-caps of the children of the wave, there were those who
called out in the language of our own dear native country the names
of various hotels in the place which these mercenaries desired us
to frequent. I was * by these precautions which environed us—
these ropes and bayonets, these sabres and soldiers. Lead me on,
thought f I have committed no crime and feel no fear. Lead me
before the officers of your Republic. If I have spoken severely of
France in the columns of the Putney Patriot, it was because truth and
duty obliged me sometimes to be severe—here is my passport. My
name is Jones, and I am a correspondent of one of the great journals
of our empire. I have no reason to be ashamed of my country, my
calling, or my name !
In a minute or two, and passing out of a rude antechamber, and
through a [narrow door, guarded by two small, but fierce-looking
warriors, I was brought with a number of other fellow-passengers
before the Commissary of the Republic, who examined our papers,
addressed us not uncivilly in our own language, and having seen that
we were not suspicious º allowed us to go free. I gave my
keys to the Commissioner of the Hotel, that of Bains or “Bang,” as it is
here pronounced, and my effects were, in the course of an hour,
restored to me untaxed and undisturbed. Not even the copies of the
Putney Patriot, which I am taking to the French Ministers, to the
President of the Republic, and the principal members of the Assembly,
were touched; and in so far, Putney may say that one of her sons has
met with courteous greeting on a foreign soil.
I read without difficulty the inscriptions on the various shops and
wine houses as I passed to my hotel, as they are given in our own as
well as the native language. The very first placard I saw on the walls
proclaimed that PRopessor KELLER and MRs. KELLER were here: im-
mediately below which announcement was a º stating that the Lord
CHIEF BARon Nicholson and the English Judge and Jury Society were
at Boulogne. I was glad to think that our venerated institutions were
thus being made known to our republican allies.—I had seen the Pro-
fessor ºf his admirable poses, and the learned Chief Baron himself, in
our own metropolis. May our neighbours profit by their presence!
Boulogne has doubtless been visited by many of the readers
of the Putney Patriot, and a description of this place is there-
fore unnecessary. Besides I am not in a position to give more than a
cursory account of the city, for indeed I had only time sufficient to
make a hasty and agreeable meal at the Hotel, when the Commissioner,
arriving with my passport and baggage, informed me that it was time
to proceed to the Station of the Paris railroad—of the road to Paris!
how ardently have I longed to see that metropolis' the eight hours
which were passed in the carriage upon the journey thither seemed
eight days at least to my young and ardent mind. It was only the
period occupied most pleasantly in dining at Amiens which appeared
to me too short.
At an hour before midnight we reached the metropolis of the world,
as it has been called, and alighting out of the various carriages, a
strange and motley crowd of foreigners pressed into a vast hall orante-
chamber of the station, where we were bidden to wait until our luggage
was ready to be served out—a motley group indeed! There were
soldiers ludicrously small in size, with scarlet pantaloons and blue
coats, ºf the exact vice persº of our own gallant British troops, who,
I hope, will never be called upon to fight, the French, and I heartily
trust will always outweigh them. I should think a dismounted regi.
ment of our Horse Guards would weigh as much as the same number
of republican cavaliers, horses and all. There were workmen and
members of the lower classes all fiercely decorated with beards
and whiskers, in which ornaments I should say the French decidedly
excelled our own country...There were priests finally, not habited like
the clergy of our own faith, but in enormous black robes and thick
shoes and buckles, and hats almost as large as some of the canoes at
my dear, my native Putney! Cleanliness, I am forced to own, does
not appear to characterise these reverend gents... There were no wooden
shoes, as I had been led to expect, amongst this people: and I am
bound to say, that the practice of º also seems to have
declined—that national dish not having once been served up to me
since my residence in France.
At an early hour. I rose the next morning, to commence my
observations on the French capital. I conclude that most of the people
in Paris speak English-all the waiters at my hotel do—that of

| Saturday, August 18, 1849–Comes MR. GoLLOPE, this being his
Birth-Day, to bid me to go dine with him and a Company of some Half-
dozen of our Acquaintance, off a Whitebait Dinner at Blackwall. So
we first to London Bridge, on Foot, walking for an Appetite, and
there took Water, and down the River in a Steam-Boat, with great
Pleasure, enjoying the Breeze, and the View of the Shipping, and also
the Prospect of a good Dinner. Landed at the Pier, and as fast as we
could to Lovegrove's, where our Table º: in the large Room.

Punch, was mighty droll: also to hear others speaking with their
Mouths full. But Dinner coming, I cared not to look about me, there
being on Table some dozen different Dishes of Fish, whereof the Sight
did at first bewilder me, like the Donkey between the Haystacks, not
knowing which to choose; and MR. GoBBLEstone do lament that at a

Stomach for the Whitebait. But Lack! to see when it came, how my

Custards and Grouse; and lastly, a Dessert, and I did partake of all,

A BRITISH BULL-FIGHT.
THE Bull-fight is no longer peculiar to Spain, for the sport has com-
menced in the very heart of London by a Smithfield bullock; who,
taking alarm at the corner of a street, began playing off some of those
pranks which are usually exhibited before a Spanish multitude.
The brute mistaking an unhappy charity boy for a Toreador, pursued
him into a house, trampling under foot as though it had been a regular
Matador the unoffending door-mat. . The drovers acting the part of
Picadores, proceeded to pick at the infuriated brute with their pikes,
when an old woman flying away with her shawl extended in the air,
involuntarily supplied a substitute for the banderillos or handkerchiefs
used for throwing over the eyes of the brute to increase his ferocity.
Bull-fights are now becoming so common on Smithfield market days,
that, there are some thoughts of erecting an arena expressly for the
exhibition of the exciting pastine. Gray’s Inn Lane is a sort of
miniature Madrid once or twice a week; and Coldbath Fields are in a
cold perspiration continually with dread at the approach of every
market day. |
A bull with a facetious turn rushed a few days ago into the office of
the Standard, and tossed off a two-column leader into “pie” before the
compositors had time to compose themselves. The skittish animal then
made for the share list, and with a truly Bullish, determination to
operate for a rise, elevated the price of stocks to such an extraordinary
height, that it came down again with a smash that precluded all hope of
settling day passing over very easily.

Though some boiled the last pratee, and burned the last peat,
For a feast and a bonfire your visit to greet.

Wid the arches and speeches, and flags and goodwill,
The lights in the windies, the blaze on the hill.
Ye saw a whole nation, that smiled for to meet you,
Ye heard a whole nation, that cheered for to greet you;
Black faction was peaceful, conspiracy tame,

But ye can’t liſt the pauper to man's true estate;
Ye could smile on my sons, but not teach them to know
The sins that they do, and the duties they owe.

To dash wid a sorrow the light of your mirth;

What sights ye ne'er saw, what yer visit can’t do.
INFANT UNDER-GRADUATES.
THE plea of Infancy having lately been set up in an action against
an Under-graduate, it became a nice question with the Judge of the
County Court to determine what are, and what are not, necessaries for
an Infant at the University. The bill consisted of a series of charges
for horses, including a hunter and hack to Boulter's farm, with hacks
on 19 different days; and the Judge very properly ruled that unless the
Inſant happened to be an invalid requiring the frequent use of a hack–
the horse-dealer would not be entitled to recover, as the debtor would
have nothing to recover from.
It was eventually decided that an under-graduate has no absolute
necessity for a horse, and indeed his grand achievement being the
passage of the pons asinorum, it would seem that another animal would,
in ordinary cases, be required; but our view of the case is, that the
University infant, like every other, infant, if he needs a horse at all
requires nothing more expensive than the article indicated in the old
nursery ballad, of
“Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross;
orse, and

JUSTICE AT CALIFORNIA.
UR own correspondent furnishes us
with a very amusing batch of legal
intelligence from this quarter, and
we can only regret that there is not
more of the otium cum dig, at the
diggings. The most effective and
most respectable of the Californian
Tribunals is the little court of con-
science which is held in everyman's
breast, but there are attempts at
| sittings in Banco by a functionary
º who sits on a Bank with a revolving
blunderbuss in his hand to enforce
his decrees, and who, by the aid of
a few slugs, corrects a tendency to
sluggishness in obeying his edicts.
º
Nºs º
C- \º The criterion for ascertaining which
ITN § is the superior, and which the in:
- º § ferior court, consists in a trial of
== strength between the respective
judges who usually fight it out, and
if the representative of Equity
proves his superiority, over the
Common Law dignitary by fº
him down, it is held at once that Equity is the Court above, because Common Law is
undermost. There is no such thing in California as a puny judge, because if he happens
to be puny he gets rapidly pitched out of office by some, not, perhaps more learned, but
bigger brother pitching into him. Refractory suitors find their heads in Chancery after the
old pugilistic fashion, and when there is anything for the Court to peruse and settle, it proceeds
to peruse the state of facts and settle the party in fault, by administering a regular settler in
accordance with that species of Law commonly known as Lynch, which is at the fingers' ends
of the Americans in general. Most of the proceedings instead of being in black and white are
in black and blue, which are quite as effective on a primá facie view of the case, and the repli-
cation de injurić is of very common occurrence. The judge after laying down the law proceeds
to lay down those who set themselves up against its authority, and the contumacious are
invariably afforded an opportunity of becoming thoroughly well grounded in their knowledge
of the power of Californian justice. - ---
One of the judges it is said, uses a sort of hammer, for the purpose of hammering, it into
parties who will not recognise the force of his decisions at the first view, but he seldom has
the trouble of a new trial.
DEFECTIN THE GAME LAWS.
However stringent the law may be in its preservation, of Game, there is a class of Game
that can enjoy no perfect preservation-though legally entitled thereto-so long as nothing is
done to secure to them the full benefit of the provisions that the legislature has made with
regard to them.
These remarks have been suggested by the premature death of a pheasant a few days ago
at the hands of a cockney sportsman, who mistook him for a partridge, and the animal himself,
though as thoroughly protected by law as a certificated bankrupt, fell a premature victim to the
error of one who little knew what he was aiming at. In order to secure to all pheasants
the benefit of the act which they are so fairly entitled to, until October, we recommend that
protection-certificates shall be issued, and that every entieman really wishing to preserve his
Game, should take out one of these certificates for each of the pheasants on his property. Each
bird should wear the protection round his neck, as the omnibus conductor wears his badge;
and every pheasant appearing without his number, should be held liable to a charge of small shot
and gunpowder.

BALLAD CORRESPONDENCE.
THE advertisements continue to inform us...of the distinguished success of the elegant and
tasteful ballads “Write to me,” and “Yes, I'll write to thee.” The pair seem to be the latest
specimens of the new invention of dialogue ditties, the best example of which is the well known
series, “Will you love me then as now?” “Dearest, then I'll love you more.” “No, I don't
love you quite as much.” “I never loved you, dear, at all,” &c. &c., a set, which appears to detail
the ins and outs of a very inconstant attachment. At this time of year when everybody
is from home, and friends are universally scattered, the idea of wedding the post to the piano
might be worked with effect in an Interlocutory Songster or Post Office *i. Warbler, as
in the following—
“WRITE TO ME”.
From a Wife at a Watering Place to a Husband in Town.
Apartments are so very high, ELIZA's got a dreadful cold;
rovisions are so dear, - (Beds here are always-damp)
That when the bills are in Isigh, And ToM, while bathing (he’s so bold!)
And wish my Epward here. All but sunk with the cramp.
Such mems of washing, cruets, soap, If you come down on Saturday,
And kitchen fire I see: mind and bring the tea—
My cash is low, I really hope But don’t forget the money, pray,
That you will write ſome. When next you write to me.
I’ve had to buy sun-bonnets, too,
To guard from the sea air;
And my own things, of course, won’t do
T *: º: º bri
o-day his bill the Draper bri
Which settled º be *
Besides some other little things—
So, dearest, write to me.
The Answer, from the Husband in Town to Wiſe
at Watering Place.
My love, it really is too bad,
You had a cheque last week,
And money isn't to be had—
But it’s no use to speak.
You seem to think that money grows,
And for it send to me—
All I know’s how the money goes
Each time I write to thee.
When you proposed a bathing trip,
And talked offeeling ill,
Lalways felt the nicest dip
Would be your’s in my till.
So once for all, I beg, my dear,
That you’ll not make so free:
Don't ask for cash—and never fear
But I will write to thee.
No. 2.-"WRITE To M.E.”
(From a Creditor.)
I’ve waited on you several times
With my account so small;
And now I write to ask, if you
Intend to pay at all?
You used to say that you'd lookin,
And settled it should be;
But you forgot-I’m short of tin,
And so I write to thee.
Oſłat your chambers did I call—
Long on your stairs Isat:
You were denied—though in the half
I’m sure I saw your hat.
When I got in once by mistake,
Y And º: º º to cut, h
ou said, you'd only got a cheque,
Andallihe banks were *
But all your dodges ain't no use,
elters must come to hand,
And neither humbug nor abuse
Am I a-going to stand.
Shell out—or in the County Court
Pulled up you sure shall be;
But if you'd settle—as you ought,
Write by return to me.
Answer. (From a Debtor.)
Ineed not say that I’m surprised
At your offensive-tone;
Though from the first I was advised
To leave your shop alone.
Tradesmen must wait, for gentlemen
Insulted ain't to be;
Learn to be civil, Sir-and then
Perhaps I’ll write to thee.
As for what you in bullying tone
Of County Courts let fall,
As I’m at present at Boulogne,
It has no weight at all.
Patience is what I’d recommend,
*Twill farthest f. with me:
If civil, some of these days, friend,
Perhaps I’ll write to thee.
NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.
We cannot impress too strongly upon all Cor-
respondents, when they are doubtful whether
the postage of a letter is a penny or twopence,
the force of the old proverb, “Two-Heads are
better than One.”

GLORIOUS CHANCE .
MESSRS. PLAGUE, PESTILENCE, & CO.
Beg to announce to their Friends and the Public generally that the
have opened extensive premises in the Metropolis, with branches in all
the principal towns .P England, for the regular supply of first-class
#. warranted to do the public business effectually and rapidly.
Their works comprise
1. A Complete Assortment of Intra-mural Burying Grounds;
in all stages of over-crowding, from which they are enabled to supply
the most highly concentrated Poisonous Gases in any quantity, and on
the most reasonable terms.
2. An Extensive System of Sewers,
in connection with Fleet Ditch and other centres of Metropolitan filth,
all entirely stagnant, and
3. A Noble Plant of the most Approved Nuisances,
situated in densely peopled neighbourhoods, and in full operation, con-
sisting of Bone-Boiling Houses, Glue, and Gut Manufactories, Dust-
heaps, Knackers'-yards, Slaughter-houses, Cattle-markets, and all the
9ther best-approved kinds of Apparatus for furnishing the strong, old,
favourite, Sulphuretted, and Garburetted Hydrºgen, and the fine, heady,
Carbonic Ž. warranted to kill in a very diluted state.
Specimens of superior Epidemies always on the premises, and samples
sent to a distance.
N.B. References kindly allored to the various Parish Authorities and
Sir Peter Laurie.
A NEW ORDER OF MERIT.
THE Pope has, it is said, been confer-
ring upon several persons the order of
the Piano. We never heard of such an
order, which is probably quite a new one;
but as many orders are all mere fiddle-
stick, we do not see why the Order
of the Piano should not be as good as
the rest of them. Perhaps the Order
of the Piano will be followed by the
institution of the Order of the Forte,
and the former, being confined to those
whose claims are of a courtly or diplo-
matic kind, may be regarded as giving
credit to its possessor for the Piano in
modo, while the Order of the Forte, being
comf on those distinguished for
boldness of action, night be looked
upon as attributing to the bearer the
ortiter in re.
ORDER OF THE PICCoLo.
THE “PROFESSION ?” AND THE PREWALENT
EPIDEMIC.
(Paneh to the Public.)
MY DEAR PUBLIC,
In connection with that at .
the state of your health—with that on
to call your attention to the condition of the medical profession.
Now, my Public, you have some thousands of medical men employed
as union-doctors. Their pay is generally very scanty; in some instances
not covering the expenses of their office. This is no joke, I know; but
bear with me. There are hardly any lucrative medical situations in
your gift; none that I know of open to competition. The offices of
physician and surgeon to your hospitals are obtained by private influence
and jobbery. True, these facts are very dull; nay, worse, they are
yery sad. The disciples of GALEN have no such prizes as Canonries,
Deaneries, Bishoprics, Attorney-Generalships, Lord Chancellorships, to
| work for. Their highest remuneration is a large private practice; and
what is that, my Public? Treating patients by rote and by wholesale.
| There is no time for thinking about their cases. Time is money; every
| five minutes is a fee. And how does the popular practitioner grow
rich, dear Public?. By arresting death—by staying the plague—by
| curing pleurisy, peripneumony, bronchitis, plirenitis, ſever? By fanning
the feeble flame of life, by soothing mortal agony? No, dear Public;
but, mainly, by composing fashionable nerves, ministering to petty
ailments, and humouring i. caprices of the sickly and silly; for the
resent very interesting subject,
y, mind—allow me for a moment
former class includes a fº portion of the latter. That is why the
Quack succeeds so much better than the regular Professor; but I will
not bore you with philosophy.
In proof of the respect with which medicine is treated, allow me,
benevolent Public, to refer you to the spectacle of the Assistant Sur.
geons in your naval service, dining—honoured guests —at the mid-
*. mess.
. I should almost be persuaded that you regard all medical men as
impostors, if I did not see that you send for them whenever you are ill.
.Now what intelligent or high-minded man will engage in a beggarly
dishonoured profession, success in which, such as it is can be obtained
only by means that are contemptible. Or having entered it, can he be
expected, to follow it, if he can get a decent living otherwise? Can
you wonder, worthy Bublic that you have not so much medical talent
as wou could wish—especially just now 2
You are troubled with an epidemic of which your doctors know about
as much as yourself. They theorise upon its cause as men once
theorised on that of thunder. For its cure they propose a host of
pseudo specifics, differing only as the tropics and the poles, charcoal
and calomel, brandy and ice!
. Do you not, then, my enlightened Public, see that you are interested
in having the medical profession made one worth the while of men of
sense and ability to follow. Eh P 33SH3CH3.

DON'T REGISTER I DON'T REGISTER."
THE Registration is going on in the City. We do not understand
much about these things, but we beg the Commissioners, as aparticular
favour, not to register any of the undermentioned articles.
No pictorial shirt of any kind, no matter whether it be in the fishing,
or shooting, or sporting, or ballet style, or any shirt whatever, no
matter whether it opens in front or behind, or at the side, or even at
both sides, or at the top or at the bottom –-in short no shirt at all, ex-
cepting it, be one that proposes most-effectually to do away with the
misery of buttons.
No paletot or great coat, no matter what animal it may be made
from, or any other article of dress with an unpronounceable name bor-
rowed from the Magyar and Lancashire dialects, and which is warranted
to be “worn by Prince Albert.”
No new wine, especially Port, even if it be favoured with an har-
monious name like “the Semi-demi-quaver,” and no new Sherry, no
matter what undiscovered part of Spain it may come from, or how
“highly esteemed ” it may be “by connoisseurs.”
othing whatever that is “strongly recommended by the Faculty.”
We do not know whether the Registration Commissioners have any-
thing to do with the above articles, but we are tired of being “re-
gistered" from head to foot, and hope some rational stop will be put to
it. The real range of the Register is the stove, and it should never
have gone beyond it. It is not agreeable to cry out, “Here, John,
bring me my Aqua-scutum,” nor do we like to press a arquis who is
dining with us “to try a glass of that old Semi-demi-quaver.' We give
notice we intend to buy the first Paletot this winter that declares it is
Unregistered.
AMONG the many particulars in which English civilisation has dis-
tanced that of continental nations, is the manner of public dining.
The Times relates, how, on the 28th ult, a Festmahl, or banquet,
in celebration of the 100th birthday of Goethe, was held at Berlin.
It is melancholy that in the nineteenth century, and in the capital of
Prussia, such a display of barbarism should have taken place as that
described by our contemporary. The soup was placed on the table at
half-past three, and the dessert not introduced till eight. The company,
in the meanwhile, it may be supposed, were cramming and stuffing
but this hypothesis is more creditable to their taste than their actua
conduct. Will it be believed? they were positively singing and
speechifying over their plates! - -
The healths of the King and the Royal Family were given before
the cloth was removed, and a song in honour of the “King of Poets”
was followed “by a course of mutton-cutlets, and Teltower turnips.”
Perhaps it is the fashion in Germany to eat, healths as well as drink
them, and “Gentlemen, charge your plates!” may be the signal to
prepare for a toast. . If ever we go to Germany, we shall expect to
meet some individual who will wish us prosperity and happiness in
a mouthful of beef, or desire the pleasure of a slice of mutton with us
across the table, - - - - -
A dinner, to have justice done it, requires undivided attention; and
the talk by which it is accompanied should be of the shortest and
smallest. Fancy the cold dishes—the coagulated gravy-which must
be the necessary consequence of harangues and songs at dinner time!
The city of London, in international charity, ought really, to send
MR. HARKER, the toast-master, to the Berliners, and teach them how
to manage these things properly.

“yes, I have DARED To Love THEE 1."
“THIs little ballad, which is causing such a sensation in the fashionable world,
-has thrown so many a tea-table info.confusion, and cooled the muffin on the
lip of female beauty—this little ballad had its origin in the following startling
incident—In an aristocratic family not five thousand miles from Belgravia,
the youngest daughter of the house was a creature all gaiety and gushiness,
who added to the carol of the lark, the eye of the eagle, the neck of the stag,
and the ringlets of the raven. That heart, having all the softness of the sponge,
had absorbed the delicious ballad of “Will you love me then as now?’ and she
was in the habit of trilling it out from morning till night in her boudoir not
five thousand miles from flºi,
“Among the numerous serving-men in the vast establishment of her father,
was one who evidently had a heart of Indian-rubber bounding about under a
waistcºat of red plush, and who, in the course of his duties, frequently came
soon took the image of the eagle-eyed, st
into close communication with the Belgravian maiden. His impressible fancy
ag-necked, raven-ringleted creature,
and the rosy fetters of CUPID were continually tripping him up when he
ºntered with the coals, or came to deliver the card, º: message or the billet.
This went on for some time, until on one occasion he entered the salon just as
the syren of Belgravia had commenced her accustomed wood-larking of the
popular ballad, ‘Will you love me then as now º' when seized with a sudden
inspiration—the bounding, heart, fluttering under the waistcoat, causing him
to forget the plush, and reducing him as it were to a non-plush, the sensitive
serving-man, burst forth with the passionate exclamation of “Yes, I have dared
tº love thee!’ A popular composer, hearing of the incident, availed himself of
the circumstance with his usual tact, and the result has been the ballad,
which is now in every lady's mouth, upon every lady's piano, and in every
boarding-school music bill.”
How TO KEEP A THING PRIVATE.
If you want to keep a thing exceedingly º put it in a letter, which

that no one else will ever see it afterwards.
ALARMIST LINEN-DRAPERS.
THE present would appear to be the “Reign of Terror” in
the Haberdashery, world, if we are to judge by the number
and extent of the alarms that are being got up at the Sacrifices,
real or pretended, of the London Linendrapers. Their an:
nouncements are no longer confined to mere assertions of
“Must have Cash,” “Extensive Failure,” and the other com-
paratively, quiet statements of a few years ago, but there is
now a recklessness bordering upon insanity pervading all their
placards. “We have made a regular Smash of it.” “What is it
to you that our Creditors won’t get 2 pence in the Pound?”
e have a Bill due to-morrow, and must sell for Anything
you offer us to-day.” “Call us fraudulent Bankrupts if you
ike, but we must have some Cash,” are a few of the delicate
baits that are now held out to purchasers no less º:
than the vendors, and it is satisfactory to feel that the buyers
who are tempted by these avowals of dishonesty, are invariably
º by having to pay about double the value for their
argains.

invention displayed in the tricks of the trade, and we therefore
for the sake of mere variety throw out a few suggestions which

THE SLANDERED BRITISH LAMB.
WE should be very sorry to quarrel with M. EMILE DE
GIRARDIN, who has won golden opinions from us by his
advocacy of peace; but in af. nature we beg to ask what
does he mean by the following passage contained in an article
on the instability of French governments that appeared lately
in his paper, La Presse?
“England, whilst freeing her constitution from the rust of ages, main-
tains, with a vigilance and firmness that never relax, the aggressive position
which she occupies in the two hemispheres, and over every sea.'
Why, England for the last several years has been leaving
all the nations of Europe to their own devices; or interfering
in their affairs only by advice; and even when this has been
rejected with scorn and insult, she has meekly put the affront
in her—reticule. England, too, has taken the initiative in
FreeTrade—thrown open her ports and her arms to all the
world. John BULL has for a long time drawn in his horns.
Qur foreign policy of late has been almost Quaker-like. Since
the celebrated charge of an aggressive policy was made by the
wolf against the lamb, on no one has that imputation been
cast more unjustly than on poor old England.

SERVº US RIGHT.
HERE was a great stir in the dark among the
pictures in the Vernon Gallery, one fine Friday
morning, a few weeks ago:
“What’s the row f * said, a rather low-
lifed GooDALL to a barefaced (and bodied)
ETTY. - -
“I suppose we’re going to be flayed, like
the old 'uns upstairs,” replied the ETTY:
“We don’t mind—we're nudes—but for all
º º LESLIEs and MULREADys! ho!
o! ho!”
- “I won’t be scrubbed,” barked alANDSEER.
“I don’t want washing,” murmured a juicy CoNSTABLE.
“Hold your silly tongues,” interposed a calm CALLCOT, “It’s only
MR. SHEEpsHANKs going to present his pictures to the nation.”
“There’s no room,” shouted a score of uneasy works. . y
“There’s more of us than can be seen already,” broke in MACLISE's
Malvolio, from the dark walk. - -
“Better lease the black hole at Calcutta to hang'em in,” gloomily
murmured EGG’s Gil Blas. r
“It’s just parſectly redaculous,” drily suggested a WILRIE. “Tell
MAISTER SHEEPshanks there's mae accommodation ſorony mair, forbye
the sair press there is already in this Nawſional Purgatory.” . -
“Do not alarm yourselves, my friends,” interposed the cheering voice
of VERNoN from his frame: “my friend SHEEPsHANKs has profited by
my melancholy example. He will not bestow his pictures where they
will not be decently provided for. He will not nullify a national benefit
by consigning his gift to the custody of a National Gallery. ... I have it
from the best authority that he intends to present his collection to the
University of Oxford. There your brethren will at least have light and
air. If those who come to visit them be fewer, they will at least be
enabled to see and appreciate. I was the first—and no doubt I shall be
the last—foolish enough to believe that a costly gem was worth a decent
setting—that a good picture deserved a fair frame—that a national
benefactor and his benefit were entitled to a worthier temple, and a
more fitting receptacle than what was meant for a coal-cellar, and is not
spacious enough for a wine-vault.”
.THE KITCHEN-GARDEN OF ENGLISH LITERATURE.
THE Radish is sprouting in the country newspapers. It has taken
such rapid root lately, that we expect it will quickly supplant the
“Enormous, Cabbage,” and put, an end to that “Enormous Goºse.
berry” which has been growing larger and larger every year, until at
last no one can take it in. - -
We have recently dug up a “Large Radish” in the printed bed of
the Chesterfield Reporter. }. is “of the salmon-colour kind,” and would
have been a radish quite to the taste of SIR HUMPHREY Davy. It
“measured 16 inches in circumference, and has never made the attempt
to run into seed; ” which is very kind on its part, but probably its
enormous size prevented its running. Why, this ambitious radish
must have been aspiring to be a carrot. Inflated vegetable ! - -
We do not understand exactly why the sub-editors of the provincial
Press restrict us to Vegetable Diet. They never get out of the Kitchen-
Garden. Why not ramble into ſhe farm-yard, or take a stroll in the corn-
field P Are there not wonderful ears of corn, and Enormous Pigs, and
Extraordinary Hens, gifted with wonderful powers of Incubation. We
should like an Enormous Egg for our breakfast, just to give a flavour to
our tea. The country Press must vary its food. The metropolitan
appetite is good, but they must not abuse it. Toujours Gooseberry is
only making a fool of us. Toujours Cabbage would even make a tailor
swear. Now we should like a “Tremendous Take of Salmon,” “a Large
Goose,” “an Enormous Battue of Partridges,” with a “Wonderful
Bunch of Grapes” next week. We are growing dainty, and can take
nothing short of the above bill of fare..
A Very Mad Bull.
THE Standard informs its readers that, a Bull, on its way from Smith-
field to the slaughter-house, walked into the printer's room of that
journal, and remained there for fifteen minutes. No doubt the animal
expected to make his appearance in one of the Standard's Irish leading
articles, in which we have long been familiar with Bulls of the most
formidable dimensions.

“OH, My own ELIZA'
“For the first time in a marriedlife of many years—sometimes,
perhaps, a little tedious, but never decidedly unhappy—I write to you
with the tears in my eyes, so excuse blots. You know what a sweet-
º easily-satisfied creature A used to be—the best of
husbands—never looked at a house-bill twice; never dined at his Club;
and content with cold mutton when convenient, and nothing better for
dinner. If he was a little soft, I felt that it was a mercy he was not
particular, especially in the way of dinners. But, my love, all this is at
an end / I am in a fair way to be driven to become a desperate woman,
or a cook in my own house /
“You have heard, I dare say, of one SoYER—cook, I understand at
one of those odious clubs, where he spends his time in inventing new
dishes, and has a kitchen, I am told, like, a drawing-room, with a
chemical apparatus, and unlimited credit at the butcher's, My misery
lies at that man’s door. You will naturally ask how. A came
home the other day. Poor little MARLA had the hoop'ng-cough, and I
had been at the *::::: Gardens, and there wasn't much of a
dinner—but quite as good as many I have seen. A thankful for.
It was a cold joint with pickles. I noticed A didn't eat as
heartily as usual. In the middle of dinner he laid down his knife and
fork, and inquired in a solemn way if I didn’t think there was a same-
ness about cold meat P I couldn’t believe my ears, and I’m sure I
don’t know what I said, when he went on and asked in a confused but
still confident way, if I knew how to make a Pot-au-Feu, or Croquettes.
I thought he meant crochet-work; but it appears he alluded to a dish
—a French dish.
“I said I was astonished at his conduct, when he began, and gave me a
receipt about cutting cold beef into dice, and putting in a stewspan with
finely-chopped onions, and bread crumbs, and fried parsley, and gracious
knows what ' You may conceive what I looked like when he went on
about a good dinner being no more expensive than a bad one, if you
knew how to manage it, and about the best Economy being good cookery,
and how attractive homes might be made by good dinners—and then, at
last, the murder came out, in the shape of a little blue-covered book
called “the Modern Housewife,” which he begged me to study. And
I assure you, my dear, that book contains enough to poison the
peace of , all families that don’t keep a professed cook, and gives
receipts for all sorts of nice things, and bills of fare for all sizes of
pºte: and all in a series of letters between MRs. L- and MRs.

some little dinners, he hasn't missed a meal. It was only yesterday,
that in return for a shoulder of mutton a la Provençale (which
didn't cost more than sixpence to do, beyond what the plain roast

me with a love of a bonnet. I want a shawl to match, it, and am

THE TERRORS OF THE THAMES.
FAR be it from us to prevent our gallant soldiery, from playing at
sieges when there is happily no necessity for their doing in earnest,
what they are in the habit of doing “only in fun;” but that which
may be mere sport to them is likely to prove death to some of the
public, if cannon balls are to be sent flying over Plumstead Marshes
into the Thames, during the lº backwards and forwards of the
steam-boats. An artillery shell would consign to his coffin any unfor-
tunate excursionist, who having run down the river for a blow, may get
his expectations more than realised, by a ten or twelve pound bunch of
rape flopping unexpectedly down ". his hat, and giving him a
É. i."§. the scythe of time has performed the operation of
thinning his hair, or cutting it off altogether. . A correspondent of the
Times complains of a regular cannonade having been kept up by the
artillery, as he was passing in a steamer, and he gives a ſearful descrip-
tion of a shot grazing the nose of the figure head, while another put
the captain under the .*. of either catching it literally, or dodging
it, as he stood on the paddle-box. We of course cannot judge of
the necessity there may be for using real ammunition in the course of
practice. But it would be as well for the practitioners to have some
aim in view, lest the innocent pleasure-seekers on the Thames should
become the involuntary targets of the brave defenders of their country.
BROUGHAM'S AGRICULTURAL DESIGNS.
LORD BROUGHAM has made his first appearance at Penrith in his
last new character of “the British Farmer.” . Among the Agricultural
Designs jº his Lordship intends shortly to introduce, we are enabled
to enumerate—
1. An improved plan for drilling the House of Lords.
2. A scheme for hatching Russian Ducks in this country.
3. A design for a scarifier for LORD CAMPBELL.
4. A contrivance for irrigating the country with small talk.
Mathematical Error.
It is quite absurd to say that a square has four sides, any two of
which are equal.
Have iºniness to look at Leicester Square.
Has that four sides, pray? and which two of those sides would you
call equal? ... .
Why, one side is completely gone, and out of the three left there are
not two alike. One side has eleven railings left, and the other two don’t
number at the outside,-or the inside either, more than thirty-three
between them, and one-half of those are wood.
It seems clear to us that Leicester Square, finding itself, no longer
able to keep things square, has broken up its fondon establishment, and
absconded, no one knows where. The horse is the only thing that
has not cut and run. The Royal Gent on horseback, whoever he
may be, deserves being appointed “RIDER A. l.”

THE GAME DISTRICTS.
Accounts of the Game this year all agree in stating that it is |
very plentiful. On the Continent it is no less plentiful than in England.
At Wiesbaden the Game is kept alive from morning to night; and
many a poor pigeon has been plucked, cleaned out, and “done nicely to
a turn,” in less than half-an-hour. The GRAND DUKE of Nassau
superintends the Assembly-rooms himself, and frequently looks in at
the rouge-et-noir table, to see whether there is fair play. He has been
known more than once to stake a florin when the fun has been rather
flagging, and has lost it with the greatest good temper. He dines
occasionally at the táble-d'hôte, and mixes most graciously with the
guests whose kreutzers he has been winning the minute before.
The GRAND Duke of BADEN has plainly declared he cannot afford
ºº: up the gambling; and, more than that, will not. The rooms at
en-Baden are beautifully lighted up, and there is music to enliven ||
those who are losing their money. It is in contemplation to give all
create a greater appetite and fiercer thirst for play. The Grand Duke
honours his princely gambling shop very frequently with his presence
and is never so happy as when he sees all his subjects playing an
gamb(olling about him; on these festive occasions he is generally
Spa is very lively, and has had a good stroke of luck this Season.
The gay little town resounds all day with the merry cry of “Faites |
votre jeu, Messieurs.”
Aix-la-Chapelle has given up its former rakish life, and has turned
respectable in its old age. W. are told it kept up the ball to the very
last, being determined to “die game.” The old sinner is occasionally
troubled with a desire to return to its abandoned habits, for with the
evil example at Spaso continually before its eyes, it requires more than
Spartan courage to resist a throw.
The other gambling shops are quietly awaiting the arrival of ...ces
bées d'Anglais.” . A large sum, however, has been cleared by a fashion-
able M. D., who has played his cards well at Hombourg. He is not
the only foctor on the Continent who has jumpt into a fortune by
means of a mineral spring !
LIGHTLY TRIP IT, TRIP IT MERRILY.
oor London is at this moment besieged by French
8-pounders in the shape of large parties of excur-
sionists, who for the moderate sum of £8, or 200
francs, are franked for an eight day's visit to the
great metropolis. With all due respect for our
great city, we must express our deep commisera-
tion for the fate of those º Frenchmen
who during this dull period of the year, are
brought over to see the Lions of London. Great
efforts are made to get up an attractive pro-
gramme to induce the French to revisit us just
now, but there are one or two points that might
we are sure be introduced with advantage into the prospectus. We think,
for example, that something might be made of Wapping Old Stairs,
which, though sounding familiar enough to us under the English title,
would make an excellent line when translated into
LES WIEUX ESCALIERS DE WAPPING.
Of course the ingenuity of the guides will not have overlooked the
interesting features of
LE MARCHE DU CHAMP DE SMITH,
or Smithfield Market, which must possess peculiar fascinations for a
Frenchman, who has always been taught to believe it the Grand Mart
for the famous or infamous
VENTE DES FEMMES,
in which wives are knocked down, whole lots at a time, with an
auctioneer's hammer.
Among other spots that may be specified as full of interest to the
French excursionists, is the
Celebre Mer de Batter,
including a visit to the Red House, where an opportunity will occur of
being introduced to the
CHEWALIER DE MAISON ROUGE
or landlord of the Red House, who may easily be confounded with the
hero that ALEXANDRE DUMAs has immortalised.
We hope to see our suggestions embodied in the next prospectuses
of the 200 franc trip, which must by this time be getting somewhat in
want of a fresh impetus.

AN ELEGY, WRITTEN IN A LONDON CHURCHYARD.
BY A TRADESMAN IN THE WICINITY.
THE sexton tolls the knell till parting day,
The latest funeral train has paid its fee,
The mourners homeward take their dreary way,
And leave the scene to Typhus and to me.
Now fades the crowded graveyard on the sight,
But all, its air who scent, their nostrils hold,
Save where the beadle drones, contented quite
And drowsy mutes their arms in slumber fold.
Saye where, hard by yon soot incrusted tower,
A Reverend Man does o'er his port complain,
Of such as would, by sanitary power,
Invade his ancient customary gain.
Beneath those arid mounds, that dead wall’s shade,
Where grows no turf above the mouldering heap,
All in their narrow cells together laid,
The former people of the parish sleep.
The queasy call of sewage-breathing morn,
The ox, urg’d bellowing to the butcher’s shed
The crowd's loud clamouring at his threatening hom,
No more shall rouse them from their loathly bed.
For them no more the chamber-light shall burn,
The busy doctor ply his daily care,
Nor children to their sire from school return,
And climb his knees the dreaded pest to share.
Good folks, impute not to their friends the fault,
If memory oler their bones no tombstone raise;
Where there lie dozens huddled in one vault,
No art can mark the spot where each decays.
No doubt, in this revolting place are laid,
Hearts lately pregnant with infectious fire;
Hands, by whose grasp contagion was conveyed,
As sure as electricity by wire.
Full many a gas of direst power unclean,
The dark o'erpeopled graves of London bear,
Full many a poison, born to kill unseen -
And spread its rankness in the neighbouring air.
Some district Surgeon, that with dauntless breast
The epidemic 'mongst the poor withstood,
Some brave, humane Physician here may rest,
Some Curate, martyrs to infected blood.
To some doom'd breast the noxious vapour flies,
Some luckless lung the deadly reek inspires,
Ev’n from the tomb morbific fumes arise,
Ev’n in men's ashes live Disorder's fires.
For thee, who, shock'd to see th’ unhonoured dead,
Dost in these lines their shameful plight relate;
If, chance, by sanitary musings led,
Some graveyard-gleaner shall inquire thy fate.
Hº! some muddle-headed clerk will say,
e used to see him at the peep of dawn,
Shaving with hasty strokes his beard away
Whene'er his window-curtains were undrawn.
There would he stand o'erlooking yonder shed,
That hides those relics from the public eye,
And watch what we were doing with the dead,
And count the funerals daily going by.
One morn we miss'd him in the 'custom'd shop;
Behind the counter where he used to be,
Another serv'd; nor at his early chop,
Nor at the “Cock,” nor at the “Cheese,” was he.
The next, by special wish, with small array,
To Kensall Green we saw our neighbour borne,
Thither go read (if thou canstread) the lay
With which a chum his headstone did adorn.
T H E EPITAPH.
Here rest with decency the bones in earth,
Of one to Comfort and to Health unknown,
jasma ever plagued his humble hearth,
And Scarlatina mark'd him for her own.
Long was his illness, tedious, and severe,
Hard by a London Churchyard dwelt our friend;
He follow'd to the grave a neighbour's bier,
He met thereby ('twas what he fear'd) his end.
No longer seek Corruption to enclose
Within the places of mankind's abode;
But far from cities let our dust repose,
Where daisies blossom on the verdant clod.

THE DUKE of ATHol (we are informed by the Perth Courier)
brought down in one day 24 head of Deer. The old song asks, “What
shall he have that killed the Deer?” and we make answer, “A blue
apron and a butcher's steel.” From the fact of having killed so many,
we think the Duke is at the least entitled to the emblems of his trade.

should have the ducal coronet upon it. What a noble butcher the

THE SHUT - U P O N E.
A LAY of THE REGENT's PARK.
THE might is dark and dreary,
The grass extremely damp;
My ear, it is aweary
Qf yon policeman's stamp;
I’d call him, but I fear he
Would seize me for a tramp.
Alone within the railings
And it groweth late and lone:
Wain my repeated hailings-
The porters must have gone;
I may not climb the palings,
For I am sixteen stone.
I pass'd the gate a quarter
Before the clocks toll'd seven;
And now it’s ten or arter-
By jingo that’s eleven!
And here Isit a martyr,
Beneath the cope of 'Even.
While getting mild and meliow
At Dobbs’s pleasant board,
I little thought my pillow
Would be the swampy sward,
With nought but an umbrella
My wretched’ead to guard!
Cuss on the fatal liquor,
Cuss on the pleasant talk,
That sent the bottle quicker,
And good intents did baulk;
Till I i. that Italk'd thicker,
And resolved to take a walk.
For in general over drinking’s
An’abit I abhor, - - -
And I felt an’usband's shrinkings
From knocking at my door,
To tell my Missis Jenkins,
That I’d do so no more.
Therefore I pass'd the gateway,
To go across the park;
Thinking to save a great way,
And not provoke remark,
By not walking in a straight way,
Which I didn’t, 'cause’twas dark.
What man, whate'er the season,
Could reasonably doubt
|That all let in, by reason,
Must also be let out;
|Not left to perch the trees on,
| Orbivouac about?
What man of business habits,
ask, coulde'er suppose, -
That the Regent's Park wouldmabits
| Walkers at evening's close,
And passengers, like rabbits,
Within its toils enclose?
My wife will scarce be apt to
lieve me if I say
That the Park i. are clapt to,
At the same hour each day;
That their times they don't adapt to
Let people get away.
- - - -
The dews fall chill and steady,
And damp me to the skin;
I was cold without already,
And now I'm wet within:
If the porter is in bed, he
Is were I should have been
And Missis JENKINs fretteth
Beside her flaring dip:
And ofther brow i. knitteth,
And pulls an injured lip,
While her wretched husband sitteth
In a dreary state of drip,
I’ll write the Times to-morrow,
About these vile park-keepers,
And teach them to their sorrow
That men ain’t railway sleepers,
To camp out thus or borrow
Trees to stick on like creepers.
High is the Fence and frowning,
And there are spikes a-top,
With a Ditch outside for drowning
Poor creatures when they drop.
No! here damp and done brown, in
The Regent's Park I’ll stop!

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
THE LONDON CLAY.
A hot war rages between the dead of the metropolis and the quick;
between the London clay of churchyards, and the London clay that is
still householder. It must be confessed that the living have been very
patient under the aggressions they have suffered; the enemy fighting
with all advantages upon their side, secure from all sensible reverse;
in veriest truth not knowing when they are beaten. The citizen, whose
chamber window opens upon a grave-yard, sleeping and waking, is a
mark for his enemy whose unconscious particles are fighting millions
. in the domestic atmosphere of the breathing man; killing him
quietly but surely-very surely. And what his solace, what his reno-
º comfort against these mortal odds? Why, he can open his
mouth, and protest at a parish gathering; or what may be a still dearer
satisfaction, the ºf making ºf his every heart-string, he can
raw a grey goºse quill, and-write to the Times. And the same night,
the enemy's millions are attacking him under his tester; destroying the
roses in his wife's cheeks, and making yellow the baby.
This is hard upon the living, hard upon the º We have sym-
hies for either side. Why should the dead be made mischievous?
he thought of it must be the longest nailina good man's coffin. Why
when man has turned his face to the wall,—that wall, where eternal
sky-light comes through upon him, why should he be made, in the
clay, to turn again, and, without his will or, knowledge, carry on an
exterminating war against those he has left behind him? Imagine a
good, gracious grandfather, made, by the tyranny of the sexton, to
poison his daughter, to kill his grandchildren. Good fellow ! with the
spirit in him, he may have been the tenderest, the kindliest of men;
and that spirit, living its eternal reward, the offal once his property is
turned into wickedness and mischief, and kills about it. After this
manner, a Howard in life, may be a homicide in his coffin.
There was an old thought—one of the many noisome pets of super-
stition—that the spinal marrow of a dead man became quickened into a
serpent. Our London churchyards, in the London clay removed from
London chambers, breed clouds of poisonous things, devouring as
logusts. We may not see them. We may not, by the aid of the É.
microscope, read their veined wings, and count one by one their organs
of destruction. The more the pity. Otherwise, we had never endured
them; had never generated them, not in a cord of marrow, but in every
particle of that “paste and covering” that makes the biggest alder.
man. Their worst evil has been in their invisibility. They ;: carried
mortality down the throats of men, and destroyed unseen. Hence, the
mischief in its long-continuing. - -
And good men, and tenderest women, with most pious intentions, up
to the present hour, insist upon doing their best, when dead, to add to
their number. Or wherefore, at this time, do London £º.
their ordinary force strengthened by helping hands—sweat in London
churchyards? Family graves are to be opened. The dead are to have
kindred followers. Widow would rejoin husband, widower would rest
with sometime wife... It is very touching: there is natural religion,
pathos in the wish. And so we pile the London clay-layer upon layer
-pile it up, until the noon-day sun scorching the crust of earth, makes
hot the very coffin-plate.
Parishioners have a vested right in the mischief of the London clay
that makes a London churchyard, and—the admiring world has seen it
will not forego the privilege of evil. They will vindicate their citizen-
ship, even in their coffins; and when dead, insist upon the good old
English prerogative of becoming anuisance. It is after this unyielding,
literal fashion, we must henceforth translate the sentiment that makes
our neighbour crave for London interment. Why should he not take
up his last home in the country? Why not—if he will have sentiment
—why not gradually become grass, the while the skylark sings to the
change, and haply, the sheep take a bite above him? Why not to soft
rural harmonies pass into dust, the stone at his head, with the gravit
of an allowed fiction, telling, a century onward where he lies? If
sentiment must be satisfied, this country home is a sweeter, pleasanter
abode than a house of London clay. ...Or is it that the parishioner of
St. Bride's thinks there may be an after soothing, a continual droning
to continual rest in the sound of carriage wheels? Is it his thought
that, even in the grave, the civic cry of “old clothes”-significant cry
near the cast-off suits of the sons of Adam -is sweeter, far more social,
than the bleating of lambs? Skylarks are very well in their way, but-
thinks our tradesman—it is something to have even above one's grave
the delicious shoutings of “City l’” “Bank!” -- - - - -
Again, a dead man may be made a sort of burglarif insisting upon
burial in a London churchyard. He in his bran-new coffin, with its
honest number of ornaments, and everything about him in the pride
and ceremony of recent death, turns out—evicts—a previous tenant,
made, it is sad to think it, of no more account when dead than an Irish
cotter when living. Yes, the pompous dead man of Saturday last,
needing full room for his fu *:::. turns, out, or, crushes into

may have done his full work of mischief in the grave; having given
off his contribution of ſº duly paid his subscription to the
fund—the floating fund-of miasma, that, from rich London clay, con-
taminates the London living. And so then, the last comer, the upper-
most man—the may in his life-time enjoy the pleasantness | the
thought)—is nicely placed, the earth lying very light upon him, to do
his worst; until certain gases shall have burned out, and the sexton
comes with his iron auger—his grave-taster—and finds the top man
may now be second top, crushing him before his time, to lie close for
a new, and on such account, therefore, more respectable lodger.
Nobody builds like your grave-digger, says SHAKspeARE; and upon
recent evidence nobody packs like the London artificer of London clay.
With his shovel he will dismember the carcase of a man—to make the
pieces lie close-readily as butcher will disjoint for the shambles.
Assuredly, folks, determined upon London burial ought to weigh
these things in their, consciences—to test them, not by the sentiment
of the grave, but by the sentiment of living justice. Can a man, ought
a man, to die at peace knowing that he has willed, sternly willed, to be
so bestowed that the sun may breed in him a mortal pestilence to his
neighbours. That he may have, in a clayey sense, a speedy resurrection
of himself in noxious vapours, taking mortal possession of the lungs of
the living. And then, if he have churchyard sentiment, how can he
endure É. thought of breaking into another man's grave before the
man be fairly worn out, and either causing him to be chopped into
collops, or, rudely crushing him, flat, treating, his weakness, as a
brutal, burly fellow—elbowing to take front rank at a sight-freats
§: ſºle inferior P But let us remove from the churchyard to the
urch.
We have laws to secure the decency of the Temple at the hands of
the living; but we allow Churchmen to make a heavy penn'orth of the
sacrilege permitted to the dead. Most profitable cellars are church
vaults, wherein, for a certain sum paid upon the altar, the well-to-do in
this life purchase the aſter privilege of doing deadly evil by proxy of
their dust. When the song of praise arises from the congregation,
then likewise ascend mephitic vapours from the homicidal corpses below,
that, despite of luxurious lead, escape to mingle with and contaminate
the breath of the singers. How is the offering tainted, when animal
gases combine with myrrh and frankincense ! Pecunia non olet f Re-
peat not the saw in English churches: for, escaped from coffins, newly-
“tapped"—(is the sexton the grim butler?)—the reeking abomination
º of money; of money paid to Mother Church for cellarage for
her rotting rich ones. -
This was a daily evil; but it is published, the evil is to cease. It is a
matter for rejoicing, when Churchmen by their lives live out The
Book; when with white hands they can meekly defy the opprobrium of
the scoffer. Arabian stories tell of Ghouls that live and fatten upon
the dead. Well, defy the mocker to the possibility of a wrenched
comparison: let not holy men, really and truly moved with the inncrence
of doves, be likened, by a hankering for certain mortal profits, to birds
of carrion propensity. Still, still, the milk-white dove, and not a feather
of the crow.
Men follow fashion even to the grave. Hence, when the DUKE of
SWIFT AND S U R E.
SUssex elected to be buried in common clay, taking his final ease in
Kensal Green, even as his Royal Highness's and Royal Earthiness’s
shoemaker may have elected before him, he did good service in his last
protest against such abominations as even the gathered rottenness—
spiced, and sweetened, and cere-clothed as it may be — shelſed in
St. George's, Windsor. The living Duke, disposing of his dead body,
resolved to make no part of a nuisance; he would protest against
abuse, even in his grave. And—willingly or not in every case—the
ducal example will be followed. Churches, must be left wholly to the
living. The dead have had their uses of them, and have passed to the
reckoning. They must not, though unconsciously, leave evil behind
them. It must not be permitted even to rank to
vault below even to the vulgar out of pews. The porcelain pitcher
broken is not to do injury to the coarsest pottery whole. In a while
and it will be thought, as unseemly for a man to desire to lay his d
body in a church yault, as it would now be judged indecent for the
living man to brawl in the service.
But where to find our burial grounds for London clay? Quills, plenty
as the porcupine's, rustle at the question. Enclose your commons!
This has been the written answer. A savage in the Times, signing
himself G.B. E.--we at once recognise Great Blockhead Ever-pro-
poses that Wimbledon Common, or Streatham, or Wandsworth, or Barnes
Common, be taken from descendants of old ancestral geese, and in due
season be whitened with tombstones! We answer, take the House of
Commons, but touch not one of these. Never let sexton's spade make
gashes in the turf that is consecrated to the escaped Londoner, who,

disposed persons have been known to liken our London churchyards to
laces crowded for a gala, where beds were scarce and must be paid

tombstone to a money-changer's table. But we live in better days;

seed, at The Sound to burst and germinate, and take upon it immortal
loveliness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
115
“TOGETHER LET US RANGE THE FIELD.”
SUCH is the invitation that is constantly on the lips of certain common
councilmen with reference to the field of Smith, or Smithfield, which
constitutes in their opinion a sort of Elysian Field, where the summit
of bliss—and a good deal of summut else—lies within the reach of them-
selves and their families. The undaunted MR. Dixon, whose ipse-dirit,
or ipse dir-on-it, goes a great way with his civic ". has taken
advantage of the prevailing epidemic to announce his unshaken confi-
dence in the salubrity of Smithfield, and he declared publicly a day or
two ago, that he would gladly locate his family on the spot, as a safe:
guard for them against Cholera. The idea is a bold one, and is well
worthy of the same vigorous imagination that saw in the gutters and
cattle-pens of the market, a promenade for mature age, and a play-
ground for infancy. , Perhaps if an application were made to our
old friend F. M. at Apsley House, permission might be granted for
a regimental band—that of the Cold-streams would be most, suitable
—to attend in the market during a couple of afternoons in the week,
and Smithfield might thus be rendered a kind of East End Kensington
#. for the out-door ré-unions of common councilmen and their
aulllleS.
PHYSIC FOR COURTS MARTIAL,
MR. PUNCH has been enabled, by the advancement of Medical
Science, to invent a series of VALUABLE REMEDIEs for the CoRREC-
Tion and PROMOTION of the MoRAL and INTELLECTUAL FUNCTions.
His ANTI-PARTIALITY PILLs are infallible in Cases of UNDUE FAvour
AND AFFECTION, and warranted a certain Cure for that WINKING OF
THE EYE at the Delinquencies of SUPERIOR OFFICERs, which is so
disgraceſul a characteristic of MARTIAL-particularly, of NAVAL-
TRIBUNALs. His TINCTURE of Justice will be found efficacious in
equalising the severity with which Offenders are treated in due pro-
portion to their misdeeds. His ELIXTR of CoMMON SEsse is a certain
stimulant to the INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES, enabling the most obtuse
and asinine to perceive the Merits of a Case.
In proof of the great necessity that exists for these Medicines,
Mr. Punch needs only to point to the proceedings of two recent Courts-
Martial. On the one hand, a Lieutenant and a Master in the Navy,
pleading guilty of desertion from their vessel, are sentenced to be dis-
missed HER MAJESTY's service, to be rendered incapable of serving her
again, and to be imprisoned for twelve months. Their excuse was that
they were driven to desert by the tyranny and ill usage of their Captain,
On the other hand, the Captain himself, brought to trial for cruelty and
oppression, and besides, for false expenditure, of stores and entering
falsehoods in the log-book, and convicted of all these charges, is simply
sentenced to dismissal from the service. Now, unless the demon who
instigates is less culpable than the victim who sins, the Captain that
drives his officers to desert is at least as blameworthy as the deserters.
It is for the prevention of such deplorable cases as that above recited,
that the ANT1 PARTIALITY PILLs, the TINCTURE of Justice, and the
Elixir of CoMMON SENSE, are respectfully offered by Mr. Punch to
the Lºrds of the Admiralty, with a recommendation that a dose of
these invaluable Medicines shall be administerºd to the members of all
future Courts-Martial about to try a senior officer on the prosecution
of his junior, whereby they will be preserved from passing iniquitous
sentences calculated to bring disgrace and discredit on the British
ag.
*... One Trial-especially such another as CoMMANDER PITMAN's—
will prove the fact.
THE BLACK FLAG OF ST. SAWIOUR'S.
WE are convinced that “truth,” really “is strange—stranger than
fiction.” It is written in the Times that, at a vestry-meeting of St.
Saviour’s, Southwark, there was passed a deliberate resolution to dis-
obey an order of the Board of Health for the closure of a certain grave-
yard in that district, called the “Cross-bones” burial ground. Under
existing circumstances that this vote can have been carried, is less
credible than the greatest lie in Munchausen.
Perhaps some future historian, of more imagination than chronology,
will relate how the name of St. Saviour's was given to this parish by
opular irony during the epidemic of 1849, and will cite in support of
is conjecture the astounding fact above recorded.
The vestry-men of St. Saviour's have made a bold stand indeed
against their sanitary aggressors. Of course their motto is, “No Sur-
render,” meaning “We won't give up our charnel !” Of course, also,
they have nailed their flag to the mast, and it only remains for us to
observe, that this flag is the “Death's head and Cross-bones.”
IMPORTANT RECIPE—To diminish the weekly average of burials in
London:-Close the graveyards.
IN FOR IT-HOW TO GET OUT OF IT.
ONCE on a time there was a gentleman who won an elephant in a
raille.
It was a very fine elephant, and very cheap at the price the gentleman
paid for his chance.
But the gentleman had no place to
Nobody would take it off his hands
He couldn’t afford to feed it.
He was afraid of the law if he turned it loose into the streets.
He was too humane to let it starve.
He was afraid to shoot it.
In short, he was in a perplexity very matural to a gentleman with—
... means, a small house, common feelings of humanity—and an
elephant.
France has won her elephant at Rome.
She has brought back the Pope., .
She is at her wits' end what to do with him;
She can’t abet the Pope and the Cardinals, because she interfered
in the cause of Liberty.
She can’t abet the Republicans, because she interfered in the cause
of the Pogº and the Cardinals.
She can't act with Austria, because Austria is absolutist.

like a cockchafer in a cabinet, for the inspection of the curious in the
lighter and more whirligig species of political entomology.
Poor France—will nobody take her precious bargain off her hands?
Rome is her bottle imp. She bought it dear enough, but can't get rid of
it “at any price.”
EMERSON EXPLAINED.
WE are told by an Irish contemporary, that-
“EMERson's words are full of truth. “Let the single man plant himself indomitably
on his instincts, and there abide, and the huge world will come round to him.’”
We are not sure that we comprehend the meaning of these words
of MR. EMERson. By a single man's planting himself indomitably on
his instincts, and there abiding, we can only understand his determining
to indulge an inclination for cigars and brandy-and-water, and becoming
a confirmed sot; in which case, if the huge world will not exactly
come round to him, it will assuredly go round to him continually.

THE surest way—as Punch some time since illustrated—to kill a
wasp, is to let fall a drop of oil upon the insect. MR. JASPER JUDGE,
the small wasp of Windsor, has been thus made nothing of by our good,
gentlewoman QUEEN. Judge, for years past, has beset the privacy of
the QUEEN and PRINCE at Windsor; now visiting their state-apart-
ments, now their domestic fireside, now their kitchen, now their pantry.
At length, JUDGE carries off certain royal etchings—the work of HER
MAJESTY and husband—resolving to turn the said pretty private bits
of art into means of shoulders-of-mutton. JUDGE is summoned to
Chancery; makes a sad figure in Court; is cast—most righteously cast
—and the turnkey of the Bench has the offender under close ward for

sanction of the offender—petitions for mercy; and receives from MR.

(And now comes the drºp of oil, of olive oil, that must kill the spy;

with which their names are in any way connected, and I am commanded to forward to you

MURDER OF MR. COCKROBIN.
From the “ St. Sepulchre's Bell.”
CAPTURE OF THE MISCREANT SPARROW, AND HIS EXAMINATION
AT BOW STREET.
LATEST PARTICULARS,
Ince our last publication our in-
telligent reporters have been
diligently engaged in gaining
EveRx INFORMATION, likely to
interest our numerous readers
regarding the miscreant, now in
oustody, upon the horrid charge
of murdering MR. Cock Robin;
and we are in possession of a
mass of intelligence which will
appear exclusivel
lumns, of the
Bell, and Old Bailey Gazette,
The way in which the capture
of SPARRow by the intrepid and
enterprising NABBs was effected
as variously, and there:
fore of course incorrectly, stated
by public Journalists, not so
well informed as ourselves. It
was not at the Bag of Nails,
Luck Street, but at the Rain-
how and Salutation, that NABBs
first succeeded in getting on the
“trail” of the ated)
sin: and in the following man-
mer. A man in the dress of
a journeyman baker had as
MR. MowLEs, the landlord of
the Rainbow, and Salutation,
whether he could have a bed for the night, and could have a single-
bedded room? This trivial question aroused MRs. Mowles's suspicion
—for it seemed singular that persons of this class should stipulate for
accommodations of a superior nature, and she
andful of money, laid down eighteenpence in advance (an
ill-informed contemporary said two shillings, but we can vouch for the
accuracy of our own statement)-laid down sighteenpence on the bar,
saying he wasn't afraid of showing money with any one.
Going into the parlour, the disguised monster called for a pot of half;
and-half, which was served to him, and a pipe of tobacco, which he smoked
with much satisfaction; these reſreshments ha paid for, offering also a
gratuity to the waiter considerable for a person of his seeming, rank,
viz. two-pence, and at nine o'clock he requested to go to bed. By this
time he was intoxicated, for he º: of several glasses of gin-and-
water after the beer, and though he offered to “stand treat” to the
company in the room, he became noisy and even offensive in his de-
meanour. Being contradicted upon some irrelevant statement made by
him to a gentleman by the name of Swire R, a frequenter of the Rain-
bow and Salutation, the baker's man offered to fight MR. Swipº,
which agreeable invitation the latter gentleman declined, and prudently
leſt the apartment and the hotel.
SPARRów (for, in spite of his disguise, there can be little doubt it
was he) swore horribly at MR. SwipHR for a coward when MR.S. went
away—had some more gin-and-water, and fell into conversation with
some other parties in the hostelry about the prevailing topic, the
murder of MR. CockRoBIN. With immense oaths and vehemence, he
swore the scoundrel was served quite right, and that he hoped the man
would get off as did it.
It will be remembered that we stated that the arrest of SPARRow did
not take place at the Bag of Nails, but at the Rainbow and Salutation
—but the Bag of Nails has yet to play its part as a scene in this event-
ful drama, for it was to the Nails (mark the mysterious hand of Fate!)
that MR. Swipe R, retired after being contumeliously driven from the
Rainbow and Salutation, by the violence and ferocious language of the
guest who was established in that inn.
Into the parlour of the Bag of Nails, NABBs—who is a relation of the
worſ º landlady, MRs. RINCER, having married her first cousin in
1823, by whom the enterprising officer has a large family of children—
MR, NABBs, the detective officer, happened to be cosily seated taking a
“friendly glass.”. He made some good-humoured jokes with MB.
SwireR, who is a tailor by profession and proverbially timid, about his
E. looks and ãº appearance; on which Swiper, said that
did not care to own fighting was not in his line, especially with a
man of four times his weight.
, Swipe R then described the appearance of the individual by whom
he had been insulted at the Rainbow; “he was 5 feet 7 inches in
º: seemingly about 37 years of age, with red hair and whiskers,
and a north country accent; and when asked by the ever watchful NABBs
—whom this conversation put on the alert—whether he had lost a front
tooth, and was pitted with the small pox, Swiper at once stated
that the individual who had insulted him was so marked by nature.
“If so,” thought NABBs, who, not caring to share the reward for the
capture with MR. SwireR, did not disclose his suspicions to that party,
“if so, I have my man.” . And to call for his score and settle it, and to
proceed from the Bag of Nails, to the Rainbow and Salutation, was
with this intrepid officer the work of an instant.
Calling at the Trump Street Office for X 191 and Z794, two athletic
policemen of that division, NABBs arrived at the Salutation at exactly

48 minutes, past 9.o'clock; and having whispered his suspicions to
the landlord, MR. MowLEs, found no difficulty in making his way, to
the bed-chamber, where the fiend in human shape lay, and whither
NABBs was guided by the loud snores of the intoxicated ruffian.
|, Drawing their, cutlasses, X 191 and Z 794 advanced with their
|lanthorns upon the snoring murderer, and NABBs calling out with a
calm voice, “John SPARRow, I seize you for the murder of MR. Cock-
RoBIN,” laid his hand upon the collar of the night-shirt of the (presumed)
fiend in human shape.
SPARRow is a very powerful man: rubbing his eyes which were at
first affected by the glare of the policemen’s lanthorns, he asked with an
oath what the -- brought them, there? and at the next instant,
springing from bed, he delivered a blow upon MR. NABBs's nose (which
is so prominent), that the officer staggered back, and the blood flowed
freely. He then made another successful hit upon the eye of Z794,
but was tripped up by X 191, who fell to the ground with him, while X
191 and NABBs }. heavily upon his legs and head, and after almost
throttling him, handcuffed and secured him.
He was brought to Marlborough Street in his might-clothes, covered
with the blood, which, however, was that of the gallant officers employed
" in his capture, and indulged in frightful language before the magistrate.
He denied, sometimes, with laughter, and sometimes with the most
violent imprecations, that he was SPARRow at all; he said his name was
HIcks; that he was a journeyman in the employ of MR. DoughTY,
baker, of Rolls Court, Chancery Lane, who had known him for fifteen
| years, and would vouch for his honesty; and when asked why then, if
honest, he resisted the law, the º ruffian said, he would knock
down any man who pitched into him, and that he would do it again.
He was locked up in a cell, where, he loudly called for more beer,
which was refused to him, but where, however, #. had some coffee, of
which the murderer partook freely; meanwhile the officers went in
pursuit of MR. Doughty, who, there is little doubt, will expose the
murderous imposition.
SECOND EDITION /
DENIAL OF THE PRISONER.
At a quarter past 11 o'clock this morning no news has been received
from Mr. Doughty. He went to Gravesend yesterday with MRs. D.
and the family. Qur reporter has followed them to that watering-place.
The prisoner, though now sober, still declares with obsſinate per-
tinacity, that his name is Hicks, and that he never heard of SPARRow,
for whom he has been taken. A little time will serve to unmask the
pretender.
THIRD EDITION / /
ARRIVAL OF MB., DOUGHTY.
This gentleman, who is a most respectable baker in Rolls Buildings,
where he has been established since 1834, arrived by the Diamond
Steamer at 30 minutes past 12, and instantly drove to Marlborough
Street, where he was confronted with HICRs.3
Hicks, it turns out, is not the supposed murderer, SPARRow; but
was perfectly well known to MR. Doughty, whose word as a respect-
able man we are bound to take. Frequent intoxication is said to be
Hicks's chief crime; but it is proved beyond doubt that he was
employed upon his duties as a baker on the day when the ill-fated
victim of SPARRow fell: but the police are on the track of the criminal:
before many hours he will be in the hands of Justice; and on the
instant of his capture, we shall not fail to publish a Fourth Edition.
The Fourth Edition of the St. Sepulchre's Bell appears, with an

NEW USE FOR GUTTA
PERCHA.
IN addition to drinking-cups, driv-
ing-bands, whips, hats, splints,
portable soup, shoes, elastic heads,
coats, candles, tubing, tenpenny nails,
theatrical, banquets, picture-frames,
saveloys, buttons, baskets, biscuits,
and other various forms into which
that universal material Gutta Percha
has been converted, we beg to suggest
a new and sanitary employment from
this multiform substance, to which
its connexion with the gutter would
seem naturally to adapt it. -
We would suggest that masks with
pipes of Gutta Percha might be em-
ployed in London and other large
towns, for enabling the wearer to
breathe the upper and purer currents
of air, in the neighbourhood of our
slaughter-houses, cattle , markets,
graveyards, bone-boilers', soap-
makers', and cat-gut manufacturers.
Without some such arrangement we
do not see how the Londoner is to
enjoy the “sweet airs that give de-
light and hurt not ”, which we are
assured by philosophers do exist
somewhere above our heads, and of
which we may be allowed to breathe
the name, if we cannot breathe any
more substantial part of them.

THE MOURNER OF CREMORNE.
Aving heard much of certain equestrian
attractions at Cremorne, including the
EGLINToun Tournament with a real
Queen of Beauty, and WIDDIcombe
as the King of Beauty, in an Earl's
Coronet, a dowager's imitation ermine
tippet, and a crimson table-cover for a
robe; having heard, also that the
Courier of St. Petersburg was racing
the Post Boy of Antwerp with six
horses each, as if the nearest way to
Antwerp and to St. Petersburg was
round the oval marked out for the
sports of the Hippodrome in the
gardens of Cremorne; having heard
that all this was exceedingly well
worth seeing, we hastened thither a
few days ago, when, to our regret, we
found that we had come rather too
late, and that those performances, having been “only for a limited
period,” had really been brought to a close. - -
We should have easily consoled ourselves for the disappointment by
preparing to enjoy the ordinary evening entertainments of the establish-
ment, but having come to see a day's performance, the night's amuse:
ments were by no means, ready to begin. Having looked in vain at
Mooltan, in the hope that it might be stormed, and having examined
the pasteboard fortifications of Gooſºmat, we inquired when it would
be besieged, and were informed by a man in a brown paper cap that the
place could not possibly fall before 9 o'clock (it was then only 3), and
though we offered half-a-crown for a special bombardment, we were
respectfully assured that the Indian upstart could not be humbled in
the dust until the conclusion of the regular evening's entertainments.
| Puzzled how to dispose of our *} we proceeded to the cave of
ZADoc, to have our fortune told, but ZADoc was evidently unprepared
for our early visit, and though the terms of the sage are only twopence,
we could not proceed to business because the venerable soothsayer
could not give us change for a fourpenny piece. After an undignified
parley with the hermit through his letter-box, and a fruitless attempt
of ZApoc to get change of the waiters, we were. º to take
another twopennyworth of fortune, in which our orig lot—the first
"º. º reversed. -- -
e next proceeded in search of amusement, to the Californian Gold
Diggings, prepared to pay our extra penny-like a man—but the doors
of the Diggings were not yet open, and we had no resource but in a
bottle of stout and a captain's biscuit, over which we wiled away the
tardy hours until the evening's entertainments commenced in right
earnest, when we were fully repaid for our patient endurance of the
afternoon.
-
LITERATURE OF THE SHOP.WINDOWS.
THE practice that has now become very popular, if not quite uni-
versal, under the title of the “ticketing system,” has been the cause
of º a great deal to that branch of literature designed
expressly for the enlightenment of those who run and read at the same
time, by running their eye over the placards in the shop-windows,
while hurrying along the public thoroughfares. We are sometimes a
É. deal amused and puzzled by those compositions, and we have
een somewhat mystified lately by tickets in the windows of the
Glove shops, inscribed, “Stout superior town-made dog,” a riddle we
are unable to elucidate. In the first place stoutness is no mark of
superiºrity, in the canine species, and such an expression as “Town-
made dog” completely sets at nought all our speculations. -
We have often been rather peºplexed by booksellers and bookbinders
talking of “Stout extra calf,” but we have presumed that the word
“Extra” in this case is used to indicate
“Something more than calf and less than cow;”
a solution with which we have hitherto remained satisfied. We have,
owever, entirely given up the hosier's riddle of “superior extra town-
made dog,” and we leave it to those who are hand-in-glove with the
trade to find an explanation of the enigma.

the Fallow, but MR. Mc. NAB will have it that the Red is by far the

Noses to the Wind, and do think and reason in their Minds like
human Beings; which, methinks, is peculiar to the Scotch Deer. He
says that the Sport is, to fetch a Compass on them by Stratagem,
so as to approach or drive them nigh enough to shoot them with
a Rifle, and it do often take some Hours and several Miles, mostly
crawling, on the Hands and Knees, to get one Shot. He says that
the Stalker and Hill-Keepers that wait on him must, to gain their
Chance, dodge, stooping behind Crags, wriggle and creep over Flats
and up Brooks like Snakes or Eels, clamber up and run down
Precipices, and stride over Bogs, wherein they do sometimes sink
plump up to the Middle; which should be rather Sport to the Stag
than the Huntsman. But after all, the Deer shot dead, or wounded,
and at Bay with the Hounds at his Throat, but despatched at last, and
paunched, which he do call “gralloched,” is such a Triumph that it do
repay the Sportsman for all his Pains. He do say that, what with
the Grandeur of the Mountains, and the Freshness of the Air, the
Spirits are raised beyond what wé could imagine, and the Appetite also
increased wonderfully; whereat MR. GoLLOPE did prick up his Fars.

tempt for polkas, chatelaines,
family—with principles to be proud of. Well,
HORRID MURDER IN BAKER STREET.
BAKER STREET is in a state of terrible
convulsion. From number one to
number the last, an electric stream of
indignation has passed through every
brick wall; and every head of a famil
! has franticly rushed to the ink-stand.
*\! Punch has received the result in a
NN shower of letters; but can only afford
the benefit of print to the following.
The writers have, to a man and a
woman, sent their names; for the pre-
sent, however they are! withheld;
nevertheless, they are at the service
of MADAME Tussaud. (Apply at the
counter between the solemn hours of
12 and 1).
“MR. PUNCH,-I have lived and
paid taxes and water-rate five-and-
twenty years in Baker Street. I am
the father of more than a promisin
family. Three magnificent. girls, an
two %. of the true British stamp.
Morals unexceptionable, with a con-
mustachios and cigars. Something like a
ir, it is my wish to be
neighbourly; especially to a female. ... Nevertheless, MADAME,TUSSAUD
—a few doors off—must not be permitted to go on, making Baker Street
a penal settlement for murderers in wax. To say nothing of my family,
I have house property in this street; and am tremblingly alive to a pro-
spective fall of rents; Baker Street becoming- if things go on as they
have done—the Norfolk Island of the metropolis. Year after year. Ihaye
suffered MADAME Tussaud to add to her monsters, in the hope that the
horror would kill itself—in the belief that the town would befairly clogged
with murder, and so the nuisance be abated. But it is not so. Public feel-
ing seems to make the GREENACREs it feeds on, and every month brings
with it a new atrocity. MR. Rush was the last magnificent addition
to MADAME T's amiable family; and now-according to the Observer, a
first gibbet authority, a distinguished turnkey furnishing exclusive
intelligence—we are to have the Liverpool monster, GLEEsoN WILSON,
hanged a few days since; and at whose ing ‘MADAME TUssaud
had a representative present to obtain the clothes of the wretch.' ...And
these ‘clothes” are to bring new poison to Baker Street. . These
murder-tainted garments are to infect the atmosphere of my fireside.
Talk of cholera, Sir, and miasma, is there not a worse moral poison,
and does it not reek from the Chamber of Horrors, contaminating not
only Baker Street, but all London? - - -
“I know very little of law; and have but little wish to improve away
my ignorance. . Nevertheless, Sir, it is my intention, in concert with a
few of my neighbours, to make my appearance before the Magistrate of
| Marylebone, on Monday next, and there to put the following case:–
‘Is not the Chamber of Horrors a public nuisance P. And is not
MADAME Tussaud, as proprietor thereof, open to an indictment for
driving a trade contra bonos mores, and to the manifest injury and
corruption of public taste and public feeling?” -
I." As I say, Mr. Punch, I know little of law: nevertheless, it does
strike me that, the above is rather a delicate case, and will call for
much stuff and horse-hair ingenuity to put it out of Court. At all
events, Sir, as the father of a family, and owner of property in Baker
Street, it is my duty to try the question; and this I will do, or I am
not your obedient servant, and my name is not,
xx
gº §.;; I live in Baker Street, I am the proprietor of a
very distinguished domestic theatre-I say domestic, because it is, in
that theatre that the fireside virtues are most thrillingly exhibited—
across the water. , Now, Sir, by the Dramatic Act (an infamous law,
by the way, as it absolutely compels a manager to pay for the dramas he
uses)—every new piece must be licensed, at a certain cost,-the fee of
the Saxon Deputy Licencer, MR. KEMBLE–before represented. This,
it is urged, is to insure º of words, character, and, manners, in
the R. produced,—that the public may not be scandalised.
“Now, Sir; why should not MADAME Tussaud be placed under
the Chamberlain? Why should she not be compelled to obtain a
license for Rush, and GREENACRE, and Courvoisi ERP Why should
I, a playhouse manager, pay a fee for each domestic drama-Hand the
show woman pay no sixpence for her domestic assassins? Why should
the Chamberlain be defied º them?
“Knowing, Mr. Punch, that copies of your inestimable journal are
duly found upon the Privy Council Table, I earnestly trust you will
print this, that it may catch the benevolent eye of HER MAJESTY, and
the eye of all her Ministers. “Yours ever, .”
“HELP, Mr. Punch, help, advise, or my daughter is lost! Mr. Punch,
my ARABELLA is (was) the sensiblest and sweetest girl, till a month
ago; plain in her, ways, as #. work itself; and with a heart so
tender, it would bleed if a kitten wanted milk. And now—but you
shall hear.
“A month ago, three young ladies, friends of ARABELLA, with a news-
paper a-piece,—as they said, ‘with such ducks of pictures in 'em —
came to our house, to go to MADAME TUssaud's. (I tremble of nights
to think we’re only – doors from the Chamber of Horrors). The
girls were in such high spirits; you’d have thought they were going
to fireworks at Cremorne or Wal Well, Sir, to be short, ARA.
BELLA went out—and from that day, she has been by no means herself;
but entirely somebody else.
“I remember, at boarding-school, reading a poem where a girl of
Thessaly, I think, fell in love with a stone statue—in stark, mad love
with it, as though it had been a live Lieutenant of the Guards. Some-
thing of the sort has happened to my ARABELLA; and (as I hear from
their mothers) to the other young ladies. As for ARABELLA, she’ll sit
for a whole morning saying ºffing; then suddenly cry out, ‘Sweet
RUSH !’ ‘Interesting JAMEs l’’ ‘Strangulated BioMFIELD!’ And
when Iscold her, and tell her she ought to be ashamed of herself to
talk in that way of a monster, she draws herself up, and says—'She
thought so, once | But MADAME Tussaud has destroyed the narrow
prejudice. Dear woman!, as Miss DEATHSHEAD observed, she brings
murder home to our business and bosoms. Yes, mamma;’—I don’t
know what she meant—‘we first endure, and then embrace.”
“I hear, too, that all the other girls have gone in the same way.
One’s in love with Courvoisier, and s him her beau garçon/
Another does nothing but cut out profiles, in black paper, of ‘the
enthusiastic, but indiscreet Oxford:’ whilst the third has written a
monody, with an urn and a weeping willow in water-colour, to JAMEs
GREENACRE! . Only yesterday, I opened the following letter from
Miss TYBURN's to my girl:—
“‘DEAREST ARABELLA, Those ferocious and interesting beings,
MR. and MRs. MANNING, are to be examined on Wednesday. I know
somebody who knows the Clerk at the Police Office, and am promised
seats on the Bench. Do come, and bring your double lunettes, that we
º *::::: good look. MRs. MANNING does not wear a visite now,
ut a polka.”
“Pray, Mr. Punch, do what you can to help us, and Baker Street will
be bound to bless you.
“Yours in affliction and in hope, – —.
“P.S.. I don't quite believe it. But a man was just shown me, who
they say is CALCRAFT, the hangman, who’s engaged to take the tickets
at the Chamber of Horrors, and to give any particulars required of
the subjects.
“P.S. No. 2. I find it isn't CALCRAFT ; but the phrenologist from
Liverpool, with the cast of WILSON.”
THE CROWN OF HUNGARY IN THE MELTING-POT.
As things have fallen out, we cannot be sentimental about the Crown
of Hungary, seeing it is, if found-to be worn as an extinguisher by the
EMPERoR of Austria. It is said—said with indignant utterance, that
KossuTH has the diadem!, That it was “the gift of a Pope to a
Saint!!” (Pretty presents have passed between Pope and Saint, or all
history is a flam!). That it has been “stripped of its jewels as bribes
for the Mahomedan!!!” And worse than all—the gold has “terminated
an almost sacred”—ſis gold made in heaven, or the bowels of the earth?)
—“an almost sacred existence of ºff. centuries, as ignominiously as a
mere piece of stolen º in the melting-pot of a Jew!!!!” -
Put all this into plain words. If the main statement be true (which
we do not believe), KossuTH has preserved the life of a ſº In an
by means of the Crown of Hungary. Had the Crown, fallen into the
hands of either Russia or Austria, would it have fulfilled so noble an
end ? Let the jewels of the Hungarian Crown adorn the covers of the
Koran; even then they cannot minister, to less Christianity than has
been exercised towards Hungary by the boy Emperor.
The Literature of Swindling.
We have seen a work advertised lately with the extraordinary title of
“The Dodo and its Kindred.” This must be a very useful work, if it
treats of the regular Do in its compound form, for a treatise on the
simple Do, as a warning to those likely to be done, would be a valuable
addition to our literature. We presume the Do-Do, or double DQ, must
include every species of the Do, not omitting a biography of the famous
DAN-Do, of oyster-eating notoriety. The career of this man, whose
infirmity it was to keep others continually, shelling Qut, without ever
shelling out himself, would be an exceedingly instructive lesson.

NONE BUT THE BRAVE DESERVE THE FARE.
INspite of our well-known hatred to clap-trap of all kinds, we fear
we shall be compelled to raise the old cry of “Woman in distress,” on
behalf of those º females, who are called by business or pleasure
into the Metropolitan Omnibi. The fair sex, it is evident, cannot pass
along the Strand without imminent danger of being hunted down by the
savage’busmen—not less formidable than bushmen—who rush furiousl
along the public thoroughfares in such a manner, as to render it
impossible to make out what they are driving at. The Indian seas were
never more formidable from the º of pirates, than is the Metro-
politan Strand, from the habit that has grown up among the busmen
of making excursions, on to the pavement, and carrying off, by main
force, the unprotected females, who happen to be passing along the
thoroughfare.
A few days ago, a small craft was attacked off AcKERMAN's Re-
pository, by two or three members of that savage hoard which
infests the Brompton Road, and pours down, in torrents from Putney
every day into the very heart of the Metropolis. T
that the 'busmen were bearing upon her, hoisted what canvas she
could, and was crowding down under a pressure of parasol, when
three rival’busmen suddenly lay to, and over-hauled her with great
violence; one of the 'busmen turned out to be a lugger, and began
lugging away the craft, having hooked her on yard-arm and yard-arm
when a brigantine coming up on the other side, hove to with fear
violence, and getting her into his wake by means of a grapline, had
nearly succeeded in towing her away, and she must have been carried
off, had she not op º: caught sight of a life-buoy, in the shape of
one of ACKERMAN’s boys, to which she held on, until a skipper skipped
up to her rescue. The most violent of the assailants was subsequentl
brought to punishment, but if the British fare are to be protected, it
will be necessary to invest the street-keeper with T. CookiaN
powers, enabling him to afford general protection to all females in dis-
tress, and rescue them, by a summary process, from all “landlubbers,”
and others who may offer any molestation to that precious article, dis-
tinguished innautical phraseology, as a “petticoat.”
As we have said already, we hate clap-trap, but it seems necessary
that a little of it should be revived in order to stimulate a wholesome
chivalric feeling in favour of the British fare; and we hereby authorise
for six months, the restoration of the celebrated assertion that “The
cad who lays his hand upon a woman, save in the way of kindness, is a
wretch, whom it were gross flattery to term anything else but a
Brompton’Bus-Conductor.”

NELSON'S LIVING IMAGE.
(An Ode, by his Statue in Trafalgar Square, to the British Public)
I'M much obliged to you, my grateful nation,
or raising me to this exalted station,
Sublimely towering o'er KING CHARLEs THE MARTYR,
And the two GEORGEs, sire and son,
The sire, with pigtail moving fun;
The son, his steed tº: like a carter
ho, stirrupless, rides Dobbin to the brook:
Examples both which let all sculptors shun
That don't intend their works absurd to look.
Your lifting me above those comic princes
Sº far, a feeling on your part evinces
Which is a most distinguish’d compliment
To that illustrious heir of fame,
That hero of immortal name,
Qm I’ve the honour here to represent.
I have no doubt that he appreciates fully
The very flattering nature of your aim
In hoisting me thus high with crane and pulley.
I’m sure he is aware that my position
Is of his lofty deeds a recognition,
is treatment with my own identifying—
Not that he’d relish standing here
In burning heat and cold severe,
winterfrozen and in summer frying:
He’s better where he lies in glory filed,
Trafalgar's victor would esteem it queer :
For his deserts to be, in fact, mast-leaded.
But NELSON has an Image, living, breathing,
Which, Britons, to your care he died bequeathing;
To which, whatever tribute you may render,
(And, grateful Public, Iregret
To say you’ve offered mone as yet)
He'll also feel with sense by far more tender.
HoRATIA still survives, John Bull, my beauty :
Nºison expects—his words you won't forget—
That England by his child will do her duty.
THE DISAGREEMENT OF THE DOCTORS.
A List of queries has been issued by the College of Physicians to
the medical §º calling upon the various members to state the
different results of their different treatments of cholera. A perusal of
these queries will show the utterly random nature of the shots that
science has been taking at the disease, for never was there such a
jumble of drugs and expedients, damp sheets and wet blankets, chalk
and cheese, electricity and mesmerism, brandy, and catechu, in fact,
everything but dog's-nose, for beer has been the only thing that has
been universally prohibited.
We shall be indeed curious to learn how this extraordinary mixture
has operated on the public organs of digestion, but we are rather
alarmed at the suggestion thrown out by the College of Physicians,
that, when a practitioner is in doubt as to the effect of any particular
treatment, he is to persevere in a number of cases until he is quite
satisfied of its being either beneficial or deleterious. The College in
its thirst for information, forgets the possibility that while the doubts
of the practitioner are being resolved, several patients may be sa:
crificed, and we trust we shall not furnish one of a series of experimental
cases, that may terminate in the proof that the particular treatment
under trialis calculated to lead to a fatal consequence.
The Knight of Malta:
MR. MoRE O'FERRAL has not been º by EARL GREY for
having denied to the sick, and wounded Italians, the refuge of Malta.
Qn the contrary, it is to be inferred, that the Governor met with
the commendation of the Colonial Office, and may expect preferment
therefrom. Last night at the clubs it was generally understood that the
illustrious Governor would be lent by our Government to Austria, for
the purpose of trying to discover the whereabouts of the Hungarian
crown, said by some to be carried off by KossuTH-by others to be
secreted, buried in some dirty place. Now, if the latter inference be
the true one, we have no doubt that MR.O'RERRAL, once let loose,
will, by his genius, readily discover the buried diadem. The deeper the
dirt, the quicker the instinct.

are you up to ** which is quite as sentimental as “Of what are you

you up to?” in the form of a poetical exclamation of “Oh! now I’m

becoming so frequent that we may look for a string of interrogatories
being setto music one of these days, and a bill in Chancery arranged
as a ballad in 6-eight time, to be followed in due course by the answer
drawn by an equity draftsman, and treated as a composing draft by one
of the many composers who are always on the alert to furnish an echo
to the ideas of others.
PANIC AMONG THE SMALL JOKE-MONGERS.
WE understand that very great distress exists among the small joke-
mongers, who had for some time been picking up a scanty and pre-
carious living, by getting up spurious articles of imitation ware, -
without any wear at all—and the unwholesome demand for which has
altogether subsided. We may shortly expect to see advertisements
in the paper offering “A small Wittling Business for sale,” or “a Joke
Walk, doing three puns a day, with six jokes to be taken as fixtures,”
they being considered fixtures on account of their going off having been
found utterly hopeless. We confess we cannot feel much commiseration
for these failures which have originated in an attempt to trade without
capital, or even worse, to obtain credit by making surreptitious use of
the capital of others. The result has been, that the joke market, like
other markets occasionally, experienced a temporary glut of inferior
stuffs, but these having been exhausted, the prospect of the legitimate
concerns are sounder and heartier than ever.
Our Insinuating Contemporary.
THE Morning Post announces that the Rev. DR. Hixos, Dean of
Carlisle, is to be the new Bishop of Norwich. Our contemporary adds
the remarkthat—
“Though the Rev. Dr. is a man of considerable intellectual ability, we regret that
we cannot have the satisfaction of congratulating the Church upon this appointment.”
Why not, since his intellectual ability is admitted? What has the
Post to say against DR. Hinds? If merely that he is neither a Tory
nor a Puseyite, the Post should have stated the objection, instead of
making an ambiguous observation calculated to injure the reverend
gentleman's character.
WHAT IT COSTS TO PLAY AT SOLDIERS.
FRANCE has s
less than £288,000,000
t ºn its war establishment, from 1831 to 1849, no

This enormous sum may be said to have been spent upon reviews,
for not one war (the razzias in Algeria are even too contemptible for
the contemptible name of war) broke out during the above period.
no game so expensive as playing at soldiers.
Therefore it cost France £10,000,000 a year for reviews: really there is
| Loyis PHILIPPE's motto was “La Pair 3 tout priz,” and he certainly
paid dearly enough for it. According to the late king's tariff, peace was
nearly as expensive as war. But then it was “an armed peace.” It
required 500,000 men to prevent France from fighting; that is to say,
nearly as many as Napoleon required to fight all Europe with. We
must say we doubt the peaceful intentions of such a warlike nation. A
peaceful man dºes not walk about with duelling pistols in his pocket.
of childish reviews with a perpetual income tax.
be a timely warning to other peace-preaching and war-practising nations.
DRAMATIC DEGREES OF COMPARISON.
Actons and managers are in the habit of playing sadhavoc with the
superlatively remote it is in all probability. RuBINI had six “positively
last engagements” and nearly as many “final retirements” from the
stage, which were of a nature to put an end to all our preconceived
notions of finality. The Adelphi Company has lately been outraging
the degrees of comparison at the Haymarket, by showing that
| positively six may mean comparatively twenty-four, or thirty, as
lº may warrant. We congratulate the manager on his audiences
having become “large by degrees, and beautifully more,” a result that
may readily excuse his having taken a perverted view of the degrees of
comparison, in the announcements put forward in his play-bills.
Posterity on Intramural Interments.
|.. “Yesterday, some workmen employed in digging the foundations for
the new Baths and Wash-houses, which will form so conspicuous an
ornament of that broad and magnificent thoroughfare, sº
Street, disinterred an immense number of human bones and skulls.
Shakspeare Street, it is well known, stands on the site of old Drury
Lane; in which locality, according to contemporary records, was
situated, so late as 1849, the burial-ground of St. Martin's. That such
was the case, is placed beyond a doubt, by the discovery of these relics.
|It is clear, therefore, that a century ago in this metropolis there pre-
vailed the barbarous and abominable custom of burying the dead
among the living—a fresh evidence. if such were needed, of the filthi-
ness and folly of our ancestors.”—Times, Sept. 18, 1950.
A NEW DIGNITY.
EveRAL dignities ending respectively in
arch, are familiar to everybody. For
instance, there is a Mon-arch, a Patri-
arch, and—that which is higher than
any—a Hièr-arch, but we have been
somewhat astonished at the advertise-
ment of a Professor of Dancing, who
calls himself a Gymnasi-arch. We did
not know that the aristocracy of dancing
had gone higher thana Barony, but it
is possible that since the expulsion of
so many sovereigns from their thrones,
they may have, some of them, taken
steps—and why not dancing steps?—
to gain a livelihood
During the first revolution the
magnates of Europe were, many of
them, in the habit of laudably devoting
their talents and accomplishments
to the purpose of earning a main-
tenance, and it may be that some
ruined Continental aristocrat, whose
ability lies less in his head than in his
heels, may have adopted the title of
Gymnasiarch, as being more adapted
to his former rank, than the plain ap-
pellation of dancing-master.
And it is probable that France will have to pay for its eighteen years
We only hope it will
Queen's English in general, and the degrees of comparisonin particular.
We find from long experience, that a “positively last appearance” is
comparatigely the commencement of an arrangement of some duration,
and that the more “positively last” anything theatrical may be, the more

THE WICTORIOUS FRENCHAT ROME."
THE French army, in the persons of certain French Officers, at Rome,
have won new laur They have magnanimously conquered a e
singer, at the Argentina. Theatre. One MADAME REBUssing refused to
ick up a bouquet thrown as an offering to her genius by the fraternal
rench. This was the more disrespectful, as no doubt the bouquet was
composed of heart’s-ease, and other floral emblems of simplicity and
love—emblems made so very rife, wherever the French have trod upon
Italian earth. French Officers, the blood of the º: nation being up
—up like exploding gunpowder—took the stage by storm; whereupon,
says the account in the Nazionale of Florence, “MADAME REBUSSINI
appeared pale and dishevelled, with tears in her eyes; she held the
bouquet in her left hand.” And so insulted France was mollified; and
the French applauded. It is impossible not to glow with admiration
of such self-restraint. We will not go quite so far as to regret that the
head of the REBUssrnI was not shaven off by the avenging sword; but
certainly, three or four of her “dishevelled locks” qught to have been
excised by the sabre of France, and sent in a locket to the French
President. They would have been quite worthy of his other Roman
laurels; and more so, if saturated with a Roman woman’s tears.
“Thunder and Ouns.”
Louis-NAPOLEON in his railway speech at the Yonne, says—“I could

however, has gone quite as far º we are afraid that it was composed
principally of the Yankee kind, called “buttered thunder.” Where is
the advantage of writing a fulminating letter that it is treated with
about the same respect as if it had been sent by Joseph ADY P This
style of letter-writing partakes strongly of the fortiter in modo and the
suaviter in re. It is like a man with two wooden legs that should
threaten to kick the DUKE or WELLINGTON. We should like to see a

THE DONKEY-BOYS OF ENGLAND.
A Song for the Sea-Side.
HE Donkey-Boys of England,
how merrily they fly,
With pleasant chaff upon
the tongue and cunning
in the eye. -
And oh! the donkeys in a
mass how patiently they
stand,
High on the heath of Hamp-
stead, or down on Rams-
gate's sand.
The Donkey-Boys of Eng-
land, how sternly they
reprove
The brute that won't"come
over,” with an impressive
shove:
And oh! the eel-like ani.
mals, how gracefully they
swerve
From side to side, but won’t advance to spoil true beauty’s curve.
The Donkey-Boys of England, how manfully they fight,
When a probable donkestrian comes suddenly in sight;
From nurse's arms the babies are clutch'd with fury wild,
And on a donkey carried of the mother sees her child.
The Donkey-Boys of England, how sternly they defy
The pleadings of a parent's shriek, the infant's piercing cry;
As a four-year-old MAZEPPA is hurried from the spot,
Exposed to all the tortures of a donkey’s fitful trot.
The Donkey-Boys of England, how lustily they scream,
When they strive to keep together their donkies in a team;
And the riders who are anxious to be class'd among genteels,
Have a crowd of ragged Donkey-Boys “hallooing” at their heels.
The Donkey-Boys of England, how well they comprehend
The animal to whom they act as master, guide, and friend;
The understanding that exists between them who'll dispute—
Or that the larger share of it falls sometimes to the brute?
THE DANCING CHANCELLORS.
It seems that the illustrious NATHAN is not the only Baron who
seeks distinction in the mazy dance; but his brother, Barons,
BROUGHAM and LYNDHURST, are ready to contest with him the Terp-
sichorean crown, and we should scarcely be surprised to hear of the
first-named Peer having rushed into the eggy,arena as a competitor
with the hero of a hundred eggshells. We shall begin to think when
such noblemen, as LoRDs BRough AM and LYNDHURST begin to pride
themselves on their dancing, it will become a question whether NATHAN
may not become “a discontented Baron” if he is not called up to the
House of Lords as first EARL of ENTRECHAT.
..We had imagined that the accomplished BROUGHAM had already
distinguished himself in every science and art, but this wonderful man
has yet to make a saltatory reputation, and we have no doubt, that
. he only begins at a period of life when the dancing days are
usually considered to be over, he will leave the imprint of his footsteps
on the sands of time as he goes dancing down toſ". As he has
lately adopted the science of Agriculture, he will perhaps render the
more graceful, subservient to the more useful pursuit, and we may
expect to find him inventing a new ballet to be danced in wooden shoes,
and to be called the “Clod Crushers.” Every novelty had apparently been
exhausted in the shape of Sylphides, Daughters of Air, Spirits of
Water, and Children of Fire; but it will be reserved fºr Logº
BRough AM to compose a Divertisement, called Les Fils de la Terre, or
the Sons of Earth, introducing a Pas de Clod-crushers, with real clods;
and as a final tableau is always considered necessary, an effect, a La
Fiorita, with its real fountains, might easily be produced by a grand
distribution of liquid manure, on the newest principle. The ingenious
and indefatigable Moss, JULLIEN will of course avail himself of the
story told ; LORD BRough AM, to prepare for his next series of
Concerts—
THE LEGAL QUADRILLE.
And since the Army and Navy have long had their respective quadrilles,
it is only fair that the Law should be similarly honoured.
This very novel feature of next season's Promenade Concerts, will of
course be got up with the liberality usually bestowed by the Mons on
his new productions; and the same enterprise which took him into the
mountains in search of cows' horns, upon which to accompany the
“ Ranz des Vaches” for the Swiss Quadrille, will inevitably carry him
into the Courts of Law in quest of all kinds of legal instruments to be
added to his orchestra for the purpose of making the performance of
the Legal Quadrille as perfect as possible. The drums and tambourines
will be covered with the parchment of real deeds, and that very
piercing instrument, affa, will be added to the ordinary fifes on the
occasion. The Time will, of course, be 6-eight throughout; and a |
rapid movement, consisting of a run up and down the scales of Justice,
will form a part of the accompaniment. We may anticipate from the
descriptive powers of the Moss JullLEN, something like the following
announcement of the contemplated novelty:—
FIGURE 1: Rising of the Sun, and sitting of the Court—Slow move.
ment of the Motions of Course—Filing and double-filing of the Bills—
Slow advance of the professional combatants, and rapid advance of
the Money by the Suitors.
FIGURE 2, Slow movement in sixteen Crotchets—Grand chassez-
º of the Counsel from side to side, and balancez of the Chan-
cellor.
FIGURE 3. Down the middle of the Long Vacation, and back again—
Hands across, and hands over-The Suitors handing the fees across to
the solicitors, and the solicitors handing them over to the Counsel.
FIGURE 4. The leading couple of Counsel pair off in opposite direc-
tions, leaving the junior º e, or couple of juniors, setting to each
other, and coming round to their first positions.
FIGURE 5. Grand round for all the Counsel, and final advance by
the Suitors, who after their last advance, are thrown off on both sides,
and are left to retire—Both couples of Counsel join hands, and the
Quadrille concludes with a Grand Crash in two flats, followed by a
movement of four sharps in a scherzo through several rapid passages
leading up to A minor, whose notes go off into minims, until they reach
the lowest minimum.
The Cheapest of Fires.
WB frequently observe in the newspapers an advertisement which
offers “Four Fires for One, Penny.” §. scores of fires may be
obtained for that small sum by the simple practice of letting lucifer.
matches lie about houses on the floor.
AN INVITATION TO A BALL.
Tigeriss M0 HAYNAy has published a proclamation, calling upon all
members of the late Hungarian Diet to come and be tried by Court
Martial... He forgot to add, by way of post-scriptum, “Muskets kept
continually a full cock, and an unlimited supply of ball-cartridges on
the premises.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE.
Y, the newspapers, “any-
thing for a change” wº
= seem to be the motto of
everybody. The Bromp-
tonian seeks the heights of
Highgate or Hampstead, for
autumnal change of air.
* The citizen quits the Lon-
: don, lowlands for a lodging
in the Surrey hills, and thus
the theory of the ups and
downs of life is brought into
almost universal practice.
The newspapers] teem [with
invitations to those in want
of change of air, and the
Athenaeum of the last three
weeks has contained three
consecutive advertisements
proclaiming the respective
advantages of Undercliff, Ventnor, and Baden-Baden.
The Isle of Wight would stand a chance of being converted into an
Isle of Greens, if it were filled with persons lured thither by the
promises held out in the advertisements. The “consumptively disposed”
are invited to a salubrious climate and “congenial sentiments,” and
“invalids” in general are offered furnished houses and apartments
at Ventnor, “surnamed,” as the historians would have it, “the Madeira
of England.” - -
We were not aware of Ventnor having been honoured with this alias,
nor do we see why it should be called England's Madeira, any more than
Gravesend might be termed its port, Battersea its cape, or Chelsea—
toujours chère—its sherry. We shall be hearing next of Herne Bay
putting itself up as the Marsala or Marseilles of Kent, and Margate
usurping the title of the antimony wine of the Isle of Thanet, on the
score of the anti-monetary effects of its bazaars on the pockets of the
visitors.
Derhaps, however, the most absurd of all the advertisements addressed
at this season of the year to invalids, is that which asks them to come to
Baden-Baden to enjoy “a quiet and tranquil life,” amid “fºtes, concerts,
and balls,” “the sounds of music ...; the promenade,” and “the
numerous parties of equestrians, and splendid equipages, now covering
the beautiful valley of Lichtenthal.” How “a quiet and tranquil life.”
is to be got at amidst all this noise and bustle we cannot conceive, and,
indeed, we who keep no other equipage than a tea equipage, are posi-
tively confounded at the idea of the equipages that the valley is said to
be covered with. “Preparations,” it is also added, “are being made
for hunting parties, on a scale of magnificence which will form an appro-
priate termination to this brilliant season.” . The idea of winding up “a
quiet and tranquil life,” of fêtes, balls, and concerts, with a series of
hunting parties, completely sets at defiance all our preconceived notions
of peace and sobriety. Perhaps the placidity attributed to Baden-Baden
is only of a political kind, and in this we can, we believe, bear out the
facts stated in the advertisement.
The Grand Duke has been restored to his throne—on the bar at the
back of the refreshment room—and the treasury, in the shape of the
till, seized last year by the Red Republicans, has been f. up to the
petty potentate. The army has been reduced to the ol peace footing
of a corporal's guard, º the civil department, is being worked by
contract at a pound a day, while the Grand Duke's brass band has been
engaged at an English watering-place for a term sufficiently long to stock
the privy Fº to an extent which renders the royal assets quite equal
to what they were before the outbreak. So far as these arrangements
are concerned, tranquillity is, no doubt, to be found at Baden-Baden';
but in other respects, we do not think that the advertisement we have
referred to holds out a very tempting promise of peace and quietness.

AMONG the champions of the Smithfield nuisance are the drovers
now employed in pioneering the bullocks as they bellow through the

object to the abolition of the Market, when we see them driving a
roaring trade out of it.

A SANITARY DICTATOR.
F. M. THE DUKE or WELLINGTON has long pººl a tolerably
decent reputation as a defender of his country. M. however, under-
stands the business of national defence even better than people generally
0 FADER MATHEw's an old argument, and used,
suppose. For several months the British forces, under the generalship
of the noble DUKE, have sustained, comparatively to the rest of the
population, without loss, the attacks of the common enemy—the pre:
vailing epidemic. The Times, has informed us how, on the approach of
the invader, F. M. promptly issued orders to the commanding officers
of the Household Troops, and the various garrisons, to set their barracks,
outhouses, stables, and quarters in general, in order. The consequence
is, that the army was never in better condition. It is much to be
wished that F. M., in addition to his various other offices, was made
President of Sewers, Inspector of Nuisances, Dictator to Parishes, and
Commander-in-Chief-with full military authority,+of the Board of
Health. St. Saviour's, and similar districts, would speedily become
law, dispensed by the Duke: and vestrymen
salubrious under martial
and guardians be forced to do their duty against a foe that is as little
to be trifled with as F. M.
—
The Pope “Changed."
A CorresponpENT of the Times does not hesitate to say, “that the
Pope is much changed.” “His hair has become nearly grey.” W.
this is from the foolish and inordinate use of French powder. “And
his countenance, though still retaining all its saintly placidity.”—the
bomb-shells, flung among his flock, not very much disturbing the
absent shepherd—“is marked by some lines of care;” perhaps, traced
by the edges of French sabres. Altogether, however, the Pope has
stood the siege of Rome like a brick of Babylon. And his face still
retains—says Correspondent—“the combined expression of unaffected
devotion, unbounded philanthropy, and saintly #. osophy" Devotion,
philanthropy, and philosophy, may be very sublime; but are, certainly
not the better recommended, when drest in French regimentals.
“ORDERs.” PUNCTUALLY EXECUTED.
THE old KING OF HANOVER has executed his Order upon HAYNAU-
the Order of the Guelph. We understand that MADAME TUSSAUD,
fired with emulation of ERNEST, has also sent to the Austrian Whip,
: Order for the Chamber of Horrors. He has certainly won his free
admission.

Mr. Pips
Tuesday, September 25, 1849–With my Wife this day to Westminster,
and walking thereabouts in Regent-Street and Oxford-Street, and the
principal Streets, though, contrary to my Resolution, to walk with her
only in the Fields, but did it to please her, and keep her in, good
Humour, but in mighty Fear of what it might cost me, trembling to
observe her continually looking askance at the Shop-Windows. But I
cannot wonder that they did catch her Eye; particularly the Haber-
dashers, and Drapers, and Mercers, whereof many were full of Bills,
stuck in all Manner of Ways across the Panes, and printed in Letters
of from two Inches to a Span long, and Dashes of Admiration two and
three together, as staring as a Notice of Hue and Cry...Mighty shocking
to read in one Window, of a “Tremendous Sacrifice!” in another of an
“Alarming Failure' 1", in a third of a “Ruinous Bankruptcy!!!”
by Reason whereof, the Goods within were a selling off at 50, 60, or 7ó
per Cent under, prime Cost, but that at any Rate the Qwners must
raise Money. Good Lack, to think of the desperate and dreadful Pass
the Drapery Trade must have come to; so many ter-Mercers and
Haberdashers on the Threshold of the Prison or the Workhouse, and
their Wives and Families becoming Paupers on the Parish, or Beg-
gars, and their People out of j, , starving; if their Notices do
tell true: which i. my Heart ake, I mean, through laughing at their
Roguery. . But my Wife did say, very serious, that we were not to
udge, or to know of their Tricks and Cozenage, and, that it was no
atter to us if they did cheat their Creditors, provided we could buy
their Wares at a Bargain, and besides, if we did not, others would. So

at that Moment, instead of being Bankrupts, to be making merry at

BUONAPARTE AND THE MAGPIES.
HAT a BUoNAPARTE should, lecture
upon, the comparative qualities of
magpies, is very encouraging. Uom;
ared with certain eagles, single and
jºi magpies are most re-
spectable, most conscientious birds.
RINCE LucIEN’s mode of treating
the little blue magpie of Spain, and
the little blue magpie of Siberia, has
suggested to us a subject that, with
profoundest respect for the peaceful
philosophy of the Prince, we beg to
offer to his ornithological Highness.
Why should he not give a series of
lectures—say at the Whittington
Club—on the Birds of foreign Courts?
- Sure we are, he might make the
course most touchingly instructive. Illustrations so abound ! For
instance: , let us assume that he takes his own little blue magpie of
Spain as typical of the very little king consort of that country. Is it
tº be doubted that he would draw therefrom the most amusing parallel?
The blue magpie of Siberia might also be made subservient-comparing
small things to mighty ones—to an admirable illustration of the habits
of the Emperor of that land of hemp and hides. . But this, by the
way. The fullness of the subject would be afforded by the Court Birds
themselves.
MR. WARREN, a Fºl man of Manchester, has recently lectured,
and most successfully, on the growth and manufacture of cotton, illus-
trating his text by model machines. Let PRINCE LUCIEN improve upon
this ; and with his property-birds about him (there must be a successor to
the late able MR. BRADwell, who can supply the animals), lecture on the
recent and present condition of the Continent from its various winged
representatives. |
And first the Gallic Cock...Very eloquently would LUCIEN describe
the miserable condition of this bird, in its gradual deterioration from
game to dunghill. We have just learned that the Count MontholoN's
apartment at Longwood is turned into a poultry:yard. Could a cock,
by way of contrast, be procured from the St. Helena stock, it would,
doubtless, add to the interest of the lecture. Any way, LUCIEN would
admirably show the present pipped condition of the bird. How it had
cried cock-a-doodle-doo before Rome; and how it had scratched the
dunghill of diplomacy, and not found a jewel. How it moulted feather
by feather; and how, at the present moment, with MAZZINI's sentences
wreaked upon it, (True MAZZINI with the “breath of heaven” still
speaking to him, “from the Alps of his country,”)—how, as though
scalded with boiling oil, it is a poor, naked, featherless thing—a mere
poulterer's bird—with not a plume to fly with. -
Next, the Roman Eagle. Here the Prince would show, how, for the
past forty years and more, the bird had been chained, and fed upon the
garbage of the Vatican. How it snapped its bonds, and flew º
and upward to the sun, still stronger with the light that gilded it, L
until its wing was broken by a French, bomb-shell fired in the name of
freedom) and down it fell, and was chained again with stronger iron, the
keepers in red hats looking warily at the new forged links.
Austria!...Double-headed Eagle, would supply a large and terrible
subject. The Prince º: give its monstrous history from its
monstrous birth. Might show how, vulture-like, it had fed upon the
vitals of liberty that still were not consumed, but grew again—again to
be devoured. . Might dilate upon its present hunger, screaming with its
double-voice for prey º Screaming for a meal off KossuTH; a
picking of BEM ; or with a scrap or two of a small Poet, who “always
oes about with a bare neck.” Yes, CHARLEs BEM-hear the Double-
eaded Eagle's Hue and Cry—would furnish capital fare. His “round
face, and brownish ruddy complexion” would be excellent food. And
then KossuTH: think of the Double-Beak stuck into that “lofty open
brow,” that “small handsome mouth,” “that “beautifully formed eye,”
with its “upward look.”. And MADAME, Kossuth would be a dish for
the Royal Bird—the Austrian mightily relishing woman's bleeding flesh,
scourged or otherwise by the whip of HAYNAU. THEREsi A Kossuth's
“long forehead, black hair, and eyes,” would waste, and turn grey and
become dim, feeding the vengeful appetite of the Austrian Eagle. And
PETosy; “poet;” his “vaulted round forehead” and "well-proportioned
mouth”—poets have ever been such, weak, small singing birds, in
the talons of imperial might — would be very pretty picking;...iſ
§: ABDUL MEDJID would only render the dainty morsels for the
anquet. *
But ABDUL MEDJID refuses to supply the food, and the Double-
Headed Eagle may cry in vain.

|tionist fashion.
Here are a few birds for PRINCE LUCIEN to begin with. With time
and opportunity, he might supply other lectures upon the Eagle o
Russia, and on the dollar-loving Eagle, with a beak for negro flesh, of
America. Any way, that he may for awhile quit the study of blue mag-
ies, for the better anatomy of carnivorous birds of royalty, is the
umble wish of A LITTLE BIRD.
“AROYNT THEE, WITCH!”
THE Sherborne Journal tells us that in the neighbourhood of Henton
and its vicinity, in a º of about 200, it is asserted that there
are 19 witches. And Punch begs leave to inquire, How many clergy-
men? And what are they about? Where the Bishop of the Diocese?
If the poor creatures “about, midnight generally hear some terrible
unearthly noises,” where are the Ministers of the Church to still the
tumult, and exorcise the demon of ignorance? Children, it is said, are
“scratched.” Are the pins stuck properly in their clothes? Some of
the folks are “hag-ridden.” No doubt. How many of us have more
upon our shoulders than we can comfortably carry P. Some “dream
wonderful dreams,” and “some have cramps l’” We hardly know
what to prescribe against dreams, unless it is, continual, wakefulness,
—whilst cramps we take to be as old as night dew and the east wind.
Nevertheless, we think the cases of the Henton sufferers, cases for the
clergy. The battle against the witches is one for the clergyman and
the schoolmaster. Of the 19 º there is not one that may not be
mortally levelled by the New Testament and the Primer. Whilst
certain arrows to bring down certain black game are best feathered
from goose-quills. -

The Spread of Protectionism.
THE last few days have furnished external evidence of a remarkable

them by the formation, in the suburbs, of numerous associations of a
Protectionist character. We have read in no less than sixty different
windows within the last week, the following portentous announcement:-
“A Goose CLUB HELD HERE.” This looks as if the Protectionist part
had formed a fearless resolution to call things by their right names, an
to get up as many Clubs, as possible. We never attended one of these
Goose Clubs, but we dare say an agriculturist orator is always in
attendance, to stuff the members with sage, after the approved Protec-

“Now, My LITTLE MAN, TELL ME–FoR A PENNY–why Don't You
wAsh Your FACE.”
“LoR, Bless You !—WE NEveR has No water Down our court.”
THE OLD HOUSE AND THE NEW.
(A VoICE FROM CHURCH STREET AND CHURCH COURT, BLOOMSBURY.)
Is it a street or kennel? Foul sludge and fetid stream,
That from a chain of mantling pools send up a choky steam: . .
Walls black with soot,and bright with grease; low doorways; entries dim;
And out of every window, pale faces, gaunt and grim.
Crouching at every door-way, under each foot of wall,
Bundles of ragged squalor, wives, husbands, children small;
Unreverenced age, grey-headed youth, man with his manhood cowed,
Woman without her womanhood, haggard and fierce and loud.
I moved, I marked, I marvelled, each sense of me assailed
By sounds, shows, stinks, that hearing, sight, and smell at once regaled-
Suffering and sin here held their own—bad but relieved by worse,
The ear turned, eager, from the cry, to hearken to the curse.
I had stept from out a thoroughfare—an artery that rolled
One of the London human streams—the streams that run with gold;
I had but twenty steps to take, another stream to find,
Rolling as rich and rapid, with waves of human kind.
And between these ceaseless currents that speak to thought and sight,
Qf knowledge, arts, and wisdom, religion, riches, right,
Lieth this hideous delta, this sad and savage place,
In its wants, as in its wickedness, lower than lowest race.
That stream still rolleth onward—for blessing must not stay;
The grave, the good, the wealthy, the wise pass on their way;
Here on the river margin no fringe of green doth lie,
The tide goes rolling, rolling, and the j howls hard by.
I paused upon the border—but it was midnight them,
And the great streams no longer poured their daily tide of men;
And, save the watchlight and the wail of those with sick or dead,
Even that misery was at rest—that wretchedness a bed.
I heard a voice upon the air, which a Church Street house did utter,
With a gush of sighs right redolent of cess pool, trap, and gutter,
Whereto from out a spruce snug house in New Church Court hard by,
With no more of self-complacence a voice did make reply.
Quoth the Old House—“Here must I stand, 'mid sewerage-mud, and
smells;
The cess-pool water saps my bricks, and poisoneth my wells;
Plague takes its lodging in my rooms, where every inch of floor,
Triple-tenanted already, wants not that grim guest the more.
Myraſters creak beneath the weight of ignorance they bear;
My old walls shake with all they see of sickness, crime, and care:
While Westrymen and Guardians, Health Boards, and Boards of Sewers,
Are wrangling round my wretchedness about their several cures.
Whitewash my ceilings, flush º drains, or ventilate my rooms;
Do something—all or any-aught but this strife, that dooms
My helpless, foº inmates to the first red plague that falls
Upon the prostrate squalor crowded within my walls.
For you, my decent neighbour, you’re cleansed outside and in;
Your miserable lodgers are turned out, kith and kin:
And when our parish Solons bring strangers here to view
Our sanitary progress, they proudly point to you.
What did you do, Church Court, to win a fate so changed from mine?
We both were foul, yet in your spruce new stucco coat you shine;
While 1, besides the misery that was, and is my own,
Must help to bear the wretchedness from of your shoulders thrown.”
-- º me not,” quoth the New House, “old friend, although 'tis true
That I have cast mine ancient slough, and show a front spam-new.
Such loads as you and I have borne may not be flung away,
As they cart off the rubbish of our shells, within a day.
'Tis true that I am clean to sight; its gig between my rows
Respectability may drive, nor hold its decent nose;
That Competence now stands erect, where Beggary crouched before;
That Misery, rent and reckless, squats no longer at my door.
But hollow all this decent show: ill doth the dwelling fare,
From squalor purged, that selfishness may find free quarters there;
They have swept the human offal out of my shelter-true,
But ’twas to pile the festering heap higher, old friend, in you.
There’s not one wretchedness the less for all my smiling face;
There’s not one grain of filth the less, for all this well-swept place;
There’s not a plague the fewer for all my clean-flushed drains;
My scavengering and sewerage is worse than wasted pains.
They’ve drained the stream that ran through me, todamit highin you;
They’ve swept out my old lodgers, to furnish you with new
The Plagues that Parish Boards crow o'er as vanquished only scoff,
And write up on their recent homes, “Removed to two doors off.”
They issue from compacter haunts, the stronger for compression,
And though their residence no more, I still am their possession:
Each ill, as I was, swept away, a new ill crop arouses,
Until the public may exclaim, “A plague of both your houses!’”
“AROUSE YE THEN, MY MERRY MERRY MEN.”
Consider ABLE excitement has prevailed within the last few days in
Trafalgar Square, by a movement of a most unexpected and unusual
character. About a week since a surly oldman and an obstinate hobble-
dehoy, furnishing an apt illustration of “crabbed age and youth,” were
seen advancing to the foot of the NELson Column, and having fumbled
for some time about the base, they succeeded in º:
canvas, or an old sheet—there are speculations in favour of both views
of the material—to the height of the pedestal. Some alarm was created
among the inhabitants that the dismal-looking texture might possibly be
the standard of CochRANE again about to be raised in the neighbourhood,
and the blank and dirty aspect of the affair went very fartowards favour-
ing the supposition.
pon inquiry being made, it turned out that the proceedings that had
caused so much uneasiness were preliminary to the investing of the
Column with the base relief, a style of out-door relief, the want of which
has for some time indicated our national poverty. We have heard that
thereason of the delay in finishing the four lions, whose absence has been
so much commented on, arises from a vague hope of the sculptor that
he shall persuade the British Lion to give him a sitting.

CURIOSITIES OF SPORTING LITERATURE.
We believe we may commend the subjoined extracts to the attention
of all lovers of sport, even such as may never have shot a bird, or
caught a fish, or crossed the back of a horse in their lives. The first,
so far as it is intelligible, is an indignant denial of the charge of un-
fairly destroying foxes; but of some of it we can neither make muzzle
nor brush. ad it:—
“FOX HUNTING IN EAST KENT.
“To the Editor of the Kent Herald.
“SIR-A report having gained strong currency, that it is my intention to appear
before the world in a new character, that of ‘Vulpecide,’ (is it possible that even a
dream of the slightest suspicion can exist on this head? I cannot find language suffi-
ciently powerful by which to express my utter astonishment!) I wish it, with your
assistance, to be made publicly known that, as far as my humble endeavours are con-
cerned, if any representations are conveyed to me at any time, declaratory of persons
annihilating or endeavouring to annihilate the breed of foxes upon my property, I will
take the most active measures by which to obviate the consequences resulting from
such doings, as connected with the interests of the East Kent Hunt. No, no fox shall
be killed upon my property illegitimately, if I am made acquainted with the circum-
stance in sufficient time so as to prevent it, as long as I hold life, and enjoy the use of
intellect, by which to discriminate that which is right from that which is wrong. I
trust that I shall again appear in the hunting field. How could I (absence or presence
never ought, and, therefore, never will make any difference as to my line of action) have
the consummate assurance and impudence to do so, unless my brains were choked up
with the dust and cobwebs of mental aberration complete, branded with the ignominious
title, “Selfish Vulpecide?’
“I have the honour to be your faithful servant,
“John F.”
MR. F. says, that if he is informed that persons are extermi-
nating, or endeavouring to exterminate the breed of foxes upon his
property, he will, as far as his humble endeavours are concerned, “take
the most active measures by which to obviate the consequences re-
sulting from such doings as connected with the interests of the East
Kent, Hunt.” . Does MR. F. mean, to promise that he will replace
the slaughtered foxes”—which would seem to be the only possible mode
of obviating the consequences to the East Kent Hunt that would result
from the destruction of those animals. But this gentleman is not the
less amusing for being unintelligible. We hope to see him in print
again; and expect that he will supply the void in literature which has
been left by GEORGE Robins.
The other morsel, though more laconic than the foregoing, is not less
enigmatical:—
To BE SOLD, a HANDSOME SHOOTING COB, about 13} hands high,
six years old, perfectly sound, and warranted to sit on her back, and shoot a dozen
. and will stop at the word of cqmmand. To be seen at Mr. T
's stables,
The owner of this Cob should exhibit her, not sell her. An animal
that could perform the astounding feat of sitting on its back, and
shooting twelve times, let alone stopping at the word of command,
would bring its proprietor more money than the Learned Pig, or ToM
THUMB, or the Mouse of musical memory.
We ask our readers if the above pieces of writing are not by far
º ry compositions than even gun cotton or the marine
glue :
º F. in general.
ANOTHER GRATUITO US EXHIBITION.
sº: E are happy, to find that, at this dull season of the year, the Me-
tropolis will henceforth be enlivened by a free exhibition which has
ust been thrown open to the public, and the particulars of which will
e found recorded in the following (fourpenny) paragraph:—
“The MARQUEss or LANsdown E has, to a considerable degree, thrown his splendid
town mansion and grounds in Berkeley Square open to the view of the public, by the
erection of an iron gate in Berkeley Street, opposite Hay Hill.”
Here is an opportunity for a lounger to spend an agreeable half
hour with his nose between the gratings in front of a great man’s
house, and a comfortable consciousness that he is owner, for the time
being, of as much of the property as he can, as the saying goes, “put
in his eye and see none the worse for it.”. We hope the Commissioners
of Police will issue proper regulations to prevent confusion at this
very attractive exhibition, now, for the first time, thrown open to the
We suppose it will be intimated that “Donkies’
eads are to be turned towards the Hay on Hay Hill,” and that police-
men are to take up or give a setting down to all who may misbehave
themselves.
We have heard it rumoured that the proprietor of a celebrated tavern
means to throw open, in the most liberal manner, the view of his viands
to the general public, by placing in his window, from ten to one, the
materials for an excellent dinner; it is expected that noses will be
turned towards the most, savoury, dish, and while the exhibition
continues open, mouths will be permitted to remain open in sympathy.

It is said that JELLAchich assured the young EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA
that he must “to the very letter fulfil the promises he had made to his
subjects'." Whereupon, we learn, that the Emperor was astonished;
but “did not lose his presence of mind.” No doubt the Emperor
believed in the royal right to keep, every thing, but his word. That,
being undeceived, he should keep his presence of mind, is a marvellous
instance of imperial greatness.

NEWS OF NEXT SESSION.
| THERE seems to be such a dearth of business for next Session in the
present tranquil state of the country, that the professional agitators
will be regularly hard up for a case, a cry, or a grievance. In the
absence of other exciting topics, it is whispered that a renowned
champion of everybody and everything intends calling for a Committee
of inquiry into the “unmerited persecution” that has been for so
many years endured by a certain acknowledged victim of domestic
melodrama. It can be proved by true bills, which have been presented
over and over again to that grandest of grand juries, an enlightened
British audience, that the victim has been nearly one thousand times
unjustly condemned to death, and has only been rescued at nearly one
thousand last moments by nearly one thousand apropos appearances
of nearly one thousand #. real culprits, reluctant witnesses, or
unconsciously retributive low comedians.
The dreadful scene of this long series of “persecutions”—all quite
“unmerited ”—has been the New Cut, and it will be proposed that a
return should be laid before the Honourable House of all the unfounded
charges, base imputations, murderous draggings by the hair of the
head, and ferocious seizures by the throat in the assassin's grip to
which the * acknowledged victim’” has been subjected.
. We have no doubt a very strong case of unmerited persecution will
be got up, and we are happy that in these days, or at all events in this
| country; the case in question is the only one of “unmerited persecu-
|tion” that is likely to arise for a Parliamentary Committee to inquire
into. As a warning to persons, who having the power might be seized
with the will to persecute, the effect of the inquiry might be beneficial,
and we dare say, if the matter should be proposed, there would be no
opposition on the part of HER MAJESTY's present Government.
A TREMENDoUs JokE.—A celebrated punster, who has long ago
broken up the whole of his dental establishment with the constant
| cracking of jokes, has sent us a pun of such terrific power that we are
| actually afraid to print it, lest it should split the sides of the globe,
and completely upset the earth's gravity.

A WORD FOR ME. WALKER.
It is the common remark of churchwardens, poor law guardians, and
people of that sort, that the movement for the abolition of intramural
interment is all WALKER. This, in one sense, is quite true. MR. G. A.
WALKER, Surgeon, and author of “Gatherings from Grave-Yards,” is
the originator, and has been the chief fomenter, of that most laudable
agitation. If ever the London atmosphere is purified of volatilised
dead men, and ceases to hold corpses in solution; if we shall be enabled
to walk the streets without inhaling human remains in a state of vapour,
and go to church without taking our defunct relations and neighbours
into our lungs; and if, as may be expected, through this desirable
change of air, we shall get rid of cholera and typhus: for all these
benefits we shall have, humanly speaking, to thank M.R. WALKER.
Already he may be said to have saved all the lives that have been pre-
served by the partial closure of churchyards.
Now MR. WALKER, being a public benefactor, we suppose will not
fail to be rewarded as such ; that is, to be utterly neglected as long as
he lives, and perhaps to have a caricature of his person, under the name
of a monument, erected to his memory after his death. But should
the Government be of opinion that any truly useful man can possibly
deserve to be recompensed like a soldier or a lawyer, we would suggest
that the more prompt and solid species of requital might judiciously be
allotted to MR. WALKER.
Little and Good.
A CALCULATION has been made, which shows that the whole of the
gold currency in the world would only weigh, 1150 tons, and that, a
room 20 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high would contain the
whole of it. If this is all the gold coin the world contains, the pro-
prietor of a tea-cup full, or an old stocking stuffed with sovereigns, has
indeed a most respectable share of it. Our respect for the bank par-
lour and its riches becomes lowered in an instant, and we dare say, it
the truth were known, the whole of the gold coin in the establishment
is confined to one division of the cellaret in the bank parlour sideboard.

A POOR LOOK OUT.
GREEN is still the prevailing colour
among a certain class of advertisers,
who are continually sº for that
which causes us simply to express a
wish that they may succeed in getting
it. One of the latest specimens of the
very sanguine temperament enjoyed by
some of our fellow-creatures, is a re-
quest to be supplied with a Govern-
ment appointment for life, producing
between two and three hundred a-year,
with the slight stipulation that the
duties must be nominal, or capable
of being performed by deputy. This
little snuggery, which, if it exists at
all, in these days of retrenchment
and hard work, must be a little official
nook, that has escaped the eye of all financial reformers—this ex-
ceedingly comfortable sinecure is advertised
office should be hidden under a certain archway at a
for one G. D., who
does not object to come down with £500 to the high and influential
person through whom alone such a situation could ever be attainable.
Fancy one of our. Ministers of State taking a sheet of paper, and
answering G.D. with a proposal that the document conferring the
- ven moment,
while a bag containing 500 sovereigns should be deposited under a lamp-
post opposite. Imagine the Minister lurking about the appointed spot
with }. official warrant in his hand, and looking out sharply for G. D.
to locate the “swag” in the position designated by the answer to the
advertisement. If we were a member of the Government, or possessed
i of official º: we would insist upon G. D. letting us know what
he might
re to take us for, when he presumes to insult a large body
of the most exalted men in the kingdom, by his petty bribe of 500
sovereigns.
If, as WALPOLE said, “Every man has his price,” we hope our leading
statesmen, whoever they may hereafter be, will, at all events, keep their
price up considerably higher than the paltry standard at which G.D. has
taken the liberty of fixing it. º; we have not yet come down to the
practice, sometimes recommended by very enthusiastic economists, of
F. out the Government of the country as a contract, to be under-
taken by the year or by the job; nor have we commenced letting the seats
on the Treasury benches to the highest bidders; and we are, therefore,
tolerably, safe so far from the risk of the places in the administration
being filled by a set of people, who undertake the thing at the very
lowest figure, with the intention of making what they can out of it, by
such indirect means as G.D. appears to look upon as a matter of course,
if we are to judge of his notions on the point by the tenor of his
advertisement.
Radetsky among the Flowers.
GRIM old RADETsKY has returned to Vienna; and, we are told, he
was almost smothered with flowers and garlands flung upon him by the
Austrians. All well and good—for Austria and Austrians. The Man
of the Sword comes back, having ham-stringed Italian Liberty. Let
the Viennese throw their flowers upon him; but why—oh, why should
British writers, in their wholesale eulogy, cast upon the tool of Austrian
tyranny the Rose of England?
GIVE THE OLD GENTLEMEN THEIR DUE.
It has often been said with much severity that the persons who
Fº Trafalgar Square did not know how to lay out a site. This is
ardly fair, for it is perfectly evident that in the achievement of laying
out a precious sight of money they are beyond all competition.
Louis-Napoleon's Pony.
THEY show at Boulogne a pony foaled at Logwood, in the house of
NAPOLEON. The pony is on its way to the President, a present from
M. LAcostE, a Mauritius planter. There is a sly irony conveyed in
the present. As the nephew can by no means, ride the high horse of
'. uncle; he may nevertheless, in one sense at least, be able to post
ls pony.
A LAPSUS LINGUAE.
THE LORDs of THE TREAsury have just authorised the admission
duty free of pigs' tongues from America. We have no objection to the
freedom of pigs' tongues in any part of the world, but we wish some of
the asses' tongues at home could have some wholesome restrictions put
upon them. H
CHURCH WAULTS.–ST, SAGE-CUM-MARJORAM.
“Mr. Punch,
“I AM, and have been, for five-and-forty years, Westry Clerk
of the ancient church of St. Sage-cum-Marjoram, an edifice that,
handed down to us by the Normans,—(the Conqueror having laid the
first stone, and rented a family vault hitherto unoccupied)—does
honour to the City of London. As Westry Clerk, you must permit me
to raise my voice—(which I could wish a brazen trumpet for the
occasion)—against the unhallowed war at present waged against the
yested interests of the dead asleep in church vaults, and in the vault of
St. Sage-cum-Marjoram in particular.—Under the unprincipled plea of
public health, the unbeliever desires to aim a blow at the decencies of
the dead; and further, it is my opinion—and not only mine, but that
of our beadle, a humble, but a very far-seeing individual—to introduce
pań and heathenish rites to the contempt of Christian burial.
‘The present cry is—Come and be buried in the country. The church-
yards are foul; the church vaults fouler; come and take your long
rest with hawthorns smelling about you, and skylarks singing above
you. All *: fine—but I (and the beadle) see what it will end in. A
few years, and there’ll be no burying at all—none. And this I would
wish the undertakers to ponder upon, that they may rally round the
church and her yards, and vaults, and other institutions. A few
}. and there’ll be revolutionists to pro what I’ve already
eard called the good old Roman way; namely, to make a bonfire of
the dead, putting out the flame with wine, and
to be put into an urn for household furniture. I’ve heard of a phoenix
—though I never saw one—that 's burnt with cinnamon, and mace, an
nutmegs, and other spices. In this fashion, it will be F. to get
rid of them who die well-to-do, consuming the poor with nothing better
than tar and turpentine. e now see advertised ‘four fires for a
thering up the ashes
penny’ in the shape of circles of wood. Give up our London vaults
and churchyards, and in like manner and in time we shall see—‘Four
funerals for five-and-sixpence.” Urns will put out coffins.
“But, Mr. Punch, what I particularly want to stand upon is this; the
sweetness-I may say the more than sweetness of the church vaults
(so shamefully attacked) of St. Sage-cum-Marjoram. Nothing can be
sweeter | What’s the words?—
“Only the actions of the just
Smell sweet and blossom in the dust."
Which is the case with our vaults. A flower-garden in June is nothing
to 'em. And for this reason. Only the most respectable

parish have been buried there—and will continue to be.

clergyman—look at his clerk—look at our beadle—look at all the con-
gregation. Pictures of health ! And all along of the sweet and
odoriferous vaults of St. º And so—I’ve no manner
of doubt of it—so it is with every other church; for which reason, I
write this, letter, calling upon all churchwardens and all beadles, to
rally round their tomb-stones, to raise the black flag with the death's
head on it in their churchyards, and one and all to cry—‘War to the
Death, and no Surrender.”
“Give up your churchyards, and in ten years, at least, there’ll be no
decent lying for anybody; no, nothing but what the heathen call,
funeral piles. However, I have eased my conscience, and am,
“Your Obedient Reader, and
“WESTRY CLERK OF ST. SAGE-CUM-MARIORAM.”
Sooted to the Climate.
WE see the announcement of a new kind of Fresco painting which
has been discovered in Berlin. The proof of its durability is, that a
painting executed in it by Kou LBACH was put up a chimney for a year,
and found perfectly fresh and in good preservation after being thus
smoked. Applying this test, we may promise ourselves that the works
in the Vernon Gallery are certain to be durable, for no chimney can be
darker and few sootier than the hole which they occupy.
“HAPPINEss was BORN A TWIN.”
THE good EARL OF CARLISLE has very pithily illustrated the words
of BYRoN. A stranger sends to the Earl £100 to be devoted by him to
the public service. And the Earl, forwarding to the Bishop of
LoNDON the stranger’s £100, adds to it a twin £100 from his own
pocket. It would be well if Poets had always such practical illustrators
as the excellent EARL OF CARLISLE. I
THE TRIUMPH of Louis NAPOLEoN. ;
WE understand that in Paris—the capital of European liberty—it is
in contemplation to give a grand fête to Louis NAPoiroN, to celebrate
the result of French interference in Rome, that is, the revival of the
Inquisition.

TURKEY versus TYRANNY.
Accounts from Vienna and St.
Petersburg state that the Austrian
Vulture (improperly called Eagle) and
the Russian Bear are in a most frantic
state, raging mad with disappointed
hatred. Their triumph over Hungary
has been robbed of nine-tenths of its
|zest by the escape of KossuTH and
his companions, who have taken refuge
in Turkey, and whom the Porte refuses
to deliver up to their tender mercies.
Of course it is impossible for any
human being to conceive the agonies
of these wretched creatures, thus
baffled of their prey, and burning with
the thirst of vengeance which they are
forbidden to slake; but their howlings
are said to be frightful. The SULTAN
is considered to have shown great
spirit in resisting the demand of the
allied savages, and to have fully sub-
stantiated his claim to his ancient title
of the GRAND TuRK. Altogether, it
may be said that Turkey has, in this
matter, taken an attitude truly worthy
of the SUBLIME PoRTE.
BEATEN away from the enormous cabbage plantations, and fairly routed out of the early strawberry
beds by the lateness of the season, the penny-a-liners have been terribly put to it for a meal and a
paragraph. Even the monstrous gooseberry can no longer be crammed down the public throat, for

An unusual haul of mackerel, which was formerly all fish in the casual reporter's net, is now not worth

has drawn in his horns; the one-eyed jackass has given his last kick, and the whole catalogue of nature's
anomalies, which could once command their fourpence per paragraph as the regular market price, are
now utterly valueless. -
In their despair, the penny-a-liners have lately taken to the horrible practice of burying people alive,
and causing them to wake again, in order that they–the penny-a-liners—may turn a most dishonest

º, say when it reads half-a-dozen advertisements

being, and an exchange of the commodity
implies a traffic in human beings, the idea of
which causes our ink to run cold in our quills
and brings the “burning blush of shame”
into both sides of our countenance. We find
the principal of a female seminary prepared
to barter away a boy for a schoolmaster’s
girl; and in another, case, the head of a
seminary anxious to take out a young lady's
education—intellectual and moral—in
candles, butcher's meat, bread, or grocery.
We can imagine the sort of account that
must be º: in the case of a pupil, whose
instruction has to be balanced by food or fuel.
Of course every pound of beef would be pro-
perly checked off by a per contra in the shape of grammar or geography;
and if the pupil's father were in the candle line, so many dozens of dips
would be the booked equivalent for so much mental enlightenment.
It is to be presumed that if the articles were not regularly sent in
the instruction would at once stop, and if the parent, being a coa
merchant, ſailed to teach his subordinates when and where to shoot the
required coals, the young idea would not be taught to shoot, or would
perhaps be significantly presented with the sack, and a polite intimation
of its being impossible without coals alere flammam. However convenient
the mutual accommodation system may be, we wish, for the credit of
the country in the eyes of foreigners, that the objectionable heading,
“Exchange of Pupils,” be at once withdrawn from the advertisements.

BAKER STREET, A PENAL SETTLEMENT.
E see by the Times that the boors
of the Cape of Good Hope have
shown themselves more fastidious
than the polite people of Baker
Street. The folks of the Cape
have resolved, not to receive
among them a ship-load of English
convicts; and further, have deter-
mined to refuse to supply any of the
|-sº º necessaries of life to any persons,
lºs N º official or otherwise, who shall obey
'''SN --~~ the mandate of the Colonial Office,
ºfſº - | in the reception or toleration of
felons. We understand that, taking
this hint, the tradesmen of Baker
Street and the vicinity have re-
solved to starve out MADAME
TUSSAUD and all her establishment,
unless Madame consents to cleanse
the neighbourhood of the evil
brought upon it, by her “harbour-
ing and comforting”—to use the
words of the State–RUSH, Cour-
VoISIER, GooDE, and other mur-
derers too sanguinary to mention.
For our own part, we respect-
fully call the attention of the Board
of Health, to MADAME T.’s Chamber of Horrors. We understand that Doctor BRITTAN
has recently examined the place, and the result of his microscopic investigations is truly
alarming. The fungi discovered in the wax of the murderers are sufficient to poison all London;
entering, as they do, by means of newspaper advertisements, into the moral food of the
population. The devastation committed, º amongst women and the youth of both
sexes, can scarcely be exaggerated. If moral health be really the care of the State, there is but
one remedy for the disease communicated by the felonious wax—namely, the melting-pot.
We have, however, heard a report—that gains hourly ground—respecting, Baker Street.
The Neptune, being sent back with its convict freight from the Cape, disembark her felons
at Greenwich. ence, they will be conveyed to Baker Street, and quartered upon the
inhabitants. That is, the attics only of the houses will be rented by Government, and a certain
number of convicts located in each. On Monday next, it is said, Government blacksmiths
will proceed to place bars before all the garret windows, and to take other precautionary
measures against the escape of the captives. A turnkey will occupy the two-pair back in
every house ! Of course, Government cannot thus invade the rights of private property, without
making due remuneration. But, as the Cape refuses to receive our criminals, and as we must
locate them' somewhere, it appears to us, that Baker Street is admirably chosen for the
purpose. It has been proved, or at least asserted, *: report of the Board of Health, that
people become acclimated to a fetid atmosphere. the like way, we presume, folks may,
after a time, live in a neighbourhood having a bad reputation for murder, and never be the
worse for it. Government does not act without authority. Its medical officers have examined
the inhabitants of Baker Street, right and left, and opposite to the Chamber of Horrors; and
except a certain wildness of eye and tremor of §: and colour suddenly coming and going,
with knocking of the knees together, and other phases and movements, sympathetic with a
guilty knowledge, -except this and these, the inhabitants of Baker Street have borne the
omicidal wax-work without any change. Therefore, half-a-dozen convicts (for the number in
each attic will never exceed six), with a tutelary turnkey, can make but little difference in the
moral atmosphere of the neighbourhood. We understand that the post of matron to all the
convict garrets has been offered to MADAME TUSSAUD; but that lady has not yet returned an
answer. It has been whispered, that her silence is the result of well-grounded discontent;
her vested rights in wax-work crime being, as she declares, materially injured by making living
convicts rivals to her atrocious dead!
Of course the determination of ministers to carry out on a large scale the purpose of MADAME
TUss AUD, and to make Baker Street *: settlement for live convicts, has caused considerable
stir in the neighbourhood. Punch will anxiously watch and report the progress of events.
MANNING A POET.
THE Penny-a-liners have this week made another most interesting discovery with reference
to. MANNING, who, if we are to believe the p phist of the daily press, “occupies his time
principally in writing poetry, and his compositions are generally presented by him, to his
Solicitor.” . Here is good news for the music-publishers, who were beginning to want a new
sensation after the decline of the Merry Sunshine which the poet has “loved not wisely,” but
rather “too well.” A new song by MANNING will be a t hit, and will be well worthy at
once to take its º; the side of the “What are you thinking of's 2" the “Fes, I have dared
to love Thee's,” the “Write to Me's,” and other favourites of the boarding-school class.
We do not doubt that we shall soon have the Bermondsey Ballads in the hands and mouth
of every sentimental Miss, while Juillen will have the affairgotupas an appropriate feature in
his next “Monster” Concert. There will be, of course, an end to all further applications for
money to conduct, the defence, since a lawyer, with such valuable property as the poetical
MS. of a suspected murderer in his 1. must be unreasonable indeed to think about
the security of his fees, whatever may be the issue of the trial. We expect to hear in a day or
two that MRs. MANNING has taken to crochet work—according to penny-a-line authority,
which, we beg to say, we consider no authority at
all; but in order to gratify the morbid curiosity
of the public, no stone can be left unturned by
the imaginative paragraphist to add to the excite-
ment on the subject of this, at present, most inte-
resting couple in the whole kingdom.
ARISTOCRACY FOR THE MILLION.
IN these days “Everything for Everybody” is
the universal motto, for there is nothing offered
to the wealthy few, but a cheap edition of the
luxury is immediately forthcoming for the benefit
of the less affluent multitude. Music is no longer
the monopoly of the higher classes at two shillings
per, sheet, but may be had for twopence by the
million, and the fashionable paletót is not more
within the means of the peerage than obtainable
—from one pound and upwards—by the people.
There is one thing, however, that has not yet
been supplied to the million, and though the
matter in question seems maturally adapted to
exclusive use, we do not despair of seeing it, ex-
tended to the masses, under the very t title
of Aristocracy for the Million, and we are happy
to furnish a suggestion, in the hope of inducin
MR. BURKE, or some other great heraldic litté.
rateur, to try the experiment. We would propose,
as an admirable beginning, a work under the title
of the Peerage and the Landed Gentry, giving an
accurate, account of all such Gentry or Gents as
may have landed at the Pierage between London
Bridge and Battersea within a given period. The
literature of flunkeyism has i
almost as low as to have come to a biogra
Court Guide, and we see no reason why it'should
not take another step downwards to the directory,
from which the transition to the Pierage and the
Landed Gentry—on the plan we propose—would
be perfectly natural.
EUROPE GOING BACK AGAIN.
THE admirers of things as they were will be
atified by the information—which we derive
rom the Morning Post—that
“By a new law on Sporting in Prussia, just sanctioned by
the King, no one is to have the right of shooting unless
possessed of 300 acres of land.”
Hurrah for the Game Laws'

iberty down; but
enactment, in figure, is a specimen of their capers.
We may, however, be blamed for ascribing sal-
tatory activity to a set of beings that may with
reason be said to exhibit rather the tardy and
retrograde motions of the crab.
Consistent Protectionists.
THE Times informs us that at the late West
Surrey Election the mob of Guildford exercised
their privilege of free and independent electors
by taking the liberty of breaking the windows
of each candidate's hotel.
Our contemporary
adds that “the worthy inhabitants of Guildford
stood by in evident gratification at the damage
caused,” and that, the general, remark among
them was, “It will be a good thing for the
glaziers, and of course the candidates will pay.”
Of a truth, the men of Guildford have proved
themselves staunch Protectionists, not only...by
returning MR. Evelyn, but also by applauding
the doing of other mischief in the belief that
it *.i. afford encouragement to British
Industry.

Mr. Pips - hisDiary.
Monda, Qctober 1, 1849-Up mighty betimes, and to Brushwood
for a Day’s ; by Invitation from MR. TIBBITTs, whose Father
the rich Furrier, did die the other Day, and leave him a Fortune, and
now he hath, rented Brushwood Manor to shoot over for the Season.
But Lack, what a set of young Rogues I found there of TIBBITTs his
Acquaintance, a-smoking of Cigars and short Pipes, and a-drinking of
Ale and bottled Stout at 10 o'clock of the Morning! Mighty ashamed
of, though diverted with, my Company, to hear their loose and idle
Conversation, and how none of them could pronounce the letter H
and to think what an unlettered vulgar Fellow TIBBITTs is, and that i
should demean myself to associate with such a Companion only because
of his Riches, and Wine, and Dinners. One of the Party, WIGGYNs,
did tell me we should have a prime Lark, which, this being the first
Day of Pheasant-Shooting, I if think droll; but divers Larks, indeed,
were shot before the Day was over. So we into the Fields, and a
Keeper following us with the Dogs, and, whenever I did look over my
Shoulder, did catch him grinning and making Faces behind our Backs.
But strange, to see how much better the Rogues did shoot than I ex-
pected, though firing at Tom-Tits, or anything almost, and do understand
they got this Skill at the Red House, Battersea, through popping at
Pigeons and Sparrows let loose from a Trap; which do seem but a
cruel and barbarous kind of Sport. But little Birds were not all they
shot, for one HIGGES aiming at a Hare did miss, and instead of the
Hare hit one of the Dogges, and sent, him, yelping and limping. Home.
But good Lack, to see how careless the Fellows were with their Fire-
Arms, carrying their Guns, full-cocked, pointing right in one another's
Faces, and 9ne, *f; his Piece through a Hedge after him, it went
off, but finding it had only carried off the Skirt of his Shooting-Coat, we
had a #. Laugh of it. Another, with a double-barrelled Gun, having
shot off one Barrel at a Blackbird, I did see reloading; the other Bar-
rel being still loaded and at full Cock. He, forcing down the Ramrod
with all his Might, I did catch him by the Elbow, and point to the
Cock of the Gun, and methinks I did never see a Man on a Sudden
tremble so terribly, or grow so pale. Getting beyond Brushwood, into a
Field hard by, MR. WIggy Ns did let fly at some Ducks, for one of those
Larks he had been talking of, which did bring down upon us the
Farmer, with his Bull-Dog, and cause us to make off with all the Speed
we could... I in mighty. Dread of being seized as an Accomplice in
shooting the Duck, fearing the Farmer, who is horridly enraged with
the Game-Preserving at Brushwood, for that the Game do eat up his
Crops; and, truly, the Game Laws are a great Nuisance. Home from
our Shooting, with our Bag, carried by TIBBITTs his Tiger-Boy, very
full, with a #. or two of Pheasants and Partridges, but, many more
Brace of Chaffinches, and Yellow-Hammers, and Robin-Redbreasts, and
so to Dinner, where all very merry, and so to Bed.

OlD BAILEY COURT CIRCULAR.
NDoUBTEDLY the increasing ...interest
every day developed by an enlightened
public in the sayings, doings, and
dressings of illustrious prisoners and
culprits, demands an Old Bailey Court
Circular. . It is a crying want of the
times, and must be answered. Punch,
with his customary benevolence, is
induced to put forth a model or sample
number. The thing should be nicely
illustrated, that it might more readily
find its way into the family circle; and
impress itself the more vividly in the
minds of the youthful members. No-
|E thing like cutting moral lessons into
: the bark of olive branches, that may
enlarge and grow with their growth.
However, to give a foretaste of the
matter.
“Yesterday morning MR. SIKEs
rose at 7. Asked if there was anything
new in the papers ? Wished to write
an Ode to Liberty, and desired to be
denied to everybody who might call,
except to MADAME Tussaud or repre-
sentative. MR. SIKEs partook of his breakfast, with characteristic
energy. mplained that the prison regulations did not permit brand

that, “when one's in Newgate, one, must do as Newgate does; ” also
complained of the barber, and declared his intention to be tried in
moustachios and a tip.
“Yesterday, MRs. SIKEs got § She

blown rose stuck in her braided hair." A letter of course it had been
opened by the governor,) from LORD FITZNoDDY, (he has been constantly
on the Bench during the examinations) requested of the fair prisoner,
one lock from her tresses. With a light ſaugh, she said it was like
his impudence,’ and then, “raised the glittering forfex high, in air,’
as MR. Pope says, and cut it, MRs. SIKEs’s presence of mind, her
intellectual resources, and her jeur d'esprit in general, have won her the
hearts of the prison. All the turnkeys swear by her.
“Three boys, of the various ages of 11, 12 and 13, were salubriously
whipped by MR. CALCRAFT, who—it is pleasant to think—made a great
impression upon all the culprits. -
“In the evening, MR. SolomoNs transacted business with WILLIAM
PoRTER, alias BILL Swipes, detained upon an insinuation of burglary.”
in usual health and spirits.
OUR LITTLE BIRD.
SWEETS OF THE SUNDAY.
WE rejoice in the stir created by the º notice of the wise
men of the Post Office. Why it should so, we know not ; but
certain it is, the spirit of mischief—some sort, of Puck—is very apt to
look over the shoulders of men drawing up Bills of Parliament, Reports,
and other official literature, leading their pens astray into the quagmire
of quibble, and the bogs of nonsense. This spirit was active in
§."...º.º. and, under its waggish, influence, the Post-
Master was made to threaten London with Sunday letter delivery the
same as upon the pounds, shillings, and pence days of the week. London
was straightway in a pucker. Meetings were held; and the beadle
of Exeter Hall looked more than usually ominous. Whereupon the
Post-Master reconsiders his work—calls for another sheet of paper, and
makes his meaning plain. Some twenty-five clerks (who will, of course
receive extra money) are to attend for a time in the morning and
evening of a Sunday; and these five-and-twenty sorting in the metro-
polis, will set free hundreds of their, country brethren, heretofore
prisoners to the letter-box from morn till night. Here we have a clear
gain. The greatest liberty of the greatest number. And in London
and its suburbs—we are thankful for the continued blessing—our
knockers are to remain untouched by postmen.
Our continental friends are apt to be very merry on the dulness of
an English Sunday. They are welcome to all their mirth, so that we
keep all our dulness. It is a blessed }. healthful breathing-
time—from the hurry, and scramble, and tumult of working-day life.
It is a day to look for—a bit of blue in the distance, let the other six
days be never so murky. Abit of Sabbath sunlight, gilding the “sullen
ground” of laborious time. . -
To the English Sunday—it is our ſaith—Englishmen owe no little of

that sober common, sense that makes them strong and great among
the nations. In Sabbath quiet is renewed a power that, all uncon.
sciously it may be, manifests itself in the six days' strife. The Sunday
pause—the domestic calmness of the Sunday hearth, when the house.
hold gods have their benignest influence, is a precious blessing. May
it never be scared by the noises that make Vienna so gay, and Paris so
delightful! Above all, let the six day slaves of Cockney-land be spared
the stunning rap-rap of the postman's knocker. At the Sunday hearth,
at least, let all men say with the Athenian, “Business to-morrow.”
SALT WITH THE SULTAN.
KossuTH, BEM, and his companions have eaten ABDUL MEDJID's
salt at Widdin, and the Sultan will not throw them as garbage to the
Russian Bear., Welove peace, but let us, at all cost, honour the spirit of
hospitality. At this moment ABDUL M EDJID, the Turk, is one of the
best favourites of Christian England. The magnanimous Mahometan
may enjoy an imaginary shake of the hand with every decent Briton.
e say we abominate war: but we have a deeper hatred of treachery.
In the cause of the Sultan's salt we would not hesitate to fire away
more than a little salt-petre.
Again, to do proper honour to the noble Sultan. This is a time for
testimonials. What if we send a testimonial to Constantinople P. Some-
thing that shall typify the virtue of the reigning Turk!. Therefore, we
beg to suggest the gift of a magnificent salt-cellar. And for the device,
a Turkey—a very fine Turkey—with its wings covering a figure of
wounded freedom from the teeth and paws of a grisly bear.
FEEDING THE TIGER.
A MAGNIFICENT dinner has been given to HAYNAU, the woman-
whip, at Vienna. The correspondent of the Times speaks of “that man
of iron,” as being seated next to the Servian patriarch, a man of silver
—“silvery beard and hair.” In such case, a most unseemly juxta-
position of the metals. This HAYNAU, we read, was vehemently
applauded by the small white hands of the fine ladies of Vienna.
Innºcent things!, Did they reflect upon their sister-woman scourged
by the orders of the barbarian who, it is to be feared, was really born of
woman—and fed at woman's breast P At Kuseburg—according to a
letter from an Englishman, dated at Widdin, Sept. 11,–this much-
applauded HAYNAU, baulked of his prey in the escape of BEM and others,
“ordered the lady of the house, who had treated them with courtesy, to be
flogged... And she was afterwards dragged barefoot by the robbers as far as
Hatseg.” But the atrocity was not at its full. “Her husband, maddened
by this outrage, blew out his brains with a pistol /* Wives of Vienna,
another round of jº. flourish of your snow-white
kerchiefs, in honour of the man-monster of iron, “whose breast,” con-
tinues the Times' correspondent, “down to his waist was covered with
stars:”—aye, most malignant stars, with blood and fire, and pestilence,
in every baleful ray. We would rather do knee-worship to the spots of
a panther, than even at a public feeding tolerate the stars of a HAYNAU.
MORE O'FERRALL AND THE IRON FLIES.
“THOUGH absent, present,” might be the political motto of MoRE
O'FERRALI. Though in the body at Boulogne, he is still in the spirit at
Malta, When he quitted his governor's chair, “he left his character
behind him;” and that, in fullest activity. Another shipload of
refugees has arrived at Malta, but have been consigned to a part of a
lazaretto, called “The Sicilian Hospital.” This was in obedience to the
orders of the absent governor. Here is a picture, that surely is a little
too horrible even for the strong taste of Downing Street:—
“We heard the wailings of the devoted wife, whose husband had that day been forced
by increasing sickness to his loathsome mattress. We saw the gaping wounds of some,
that under careful treatment would have been long since cured. We saw those whom
the fate of war had deprived of a limb–we saw the loathsome vermin crawling on the
bodies of many, by whom the luxury of a bath had not been attainable before, although
this treat has, we believe, been since allowed. We saw those suffering from cutaneous
diseases of every kind—we heard the groans of a poor creature, suffering the pangs of
labour; we saw—but we have told enough.”
Surely MR. O'FERRALL has earned his right to a Russian Order; he
i. ºly escape the cross of ST. ANDREW for all this? But hear
urther:—
“The shrivelled arm had scarce the necessary strength to dislodge the numerous flies
already settling on their victims.”
This is horrible. Nevertheless, a flesh-wound fly-blown may be
curable—but hardly so a fly-blown reputation; so fly-blown, that
decent people hold their noses when they think of it. So fly-blown,
that not a whole river of rose-water running from Downing Street,
will ever again sweeten it.
These said flies suggest to us an odd wish. Folks have heard of
the famous wooden eagle, the wonderful iº constructed by that
marvellous mechanician REGIOMONTANUs. We hugely desire the skill
to make not one such fly, but a Midsummer swarm of such flies;
iron flies; a very cloud of buzzing, droning metal. ...And when we
had made the multitude of iron insects, we would further wish for

We think it would puzzle PLATo himself with all his philosophy to

THE PRIWILEGES OF PARLIAMENT.
WE have heard a good deal of objection during the last year or two
raised against certain Parliamentary privileges, which are not thought
quite consistent with legislative dignity; but we have been struck by a
very novel mode of turning the distinction of M. P. to account, by
making it figure in a “selling off” advertisement, issued by a retiring
linen-draper, who “trusts his many friends and the public will take
advantage of this unprecedented opportunity.” The whole affair is
rather unprecedented we admit, and though there is no objection what-
ever to an M. P. being a tradesman, the availing, one's self of one's
membership to embellish an advertisement about the shop, is, to say
the least of it, an original idea, and may rank among the goods
in the window as a decided novelty. It used to be one of the
points of Chartism, that Members of Parliament should be paid,
and perhaps it is in pursuance of this yery...liberal principle that an
M. ** * linen line would feel himself at liberty to make the most
of his membership in connection with his “French, Merinos, Indianas,
Coburg Cloths, Balmoral Plaids, and other articles at 35 per cent.
under market prices.” . .
We admire the precision with which it is intimated that, “To pre-
vent mistakes all goods are marked in plain figures,” and indeed it is
quite evident that plain speaking is the very essence of the whole
advertisement. The combination between the political and commercial
character of the M.P. who “must sell off within a very limited period
not capable of extension,” is rather peculiar at first sight, but as the
honourable gentleman is probably one of the Utilitarian school, it is
natural that he should do º best to make the very most of everything,
and if the addition of M. P. to his name can add to the inducements to
the Public to come to his shop, he feels himself of course justified in
availing himself of his legislative capacity in the way of business.

To the Box, brother’Bus-men, the grey dawn is breaking,
The mist from his flanks the night cab-horse is shaking;
Shops open: the milkman prepares for his walk,
He hath pumped the bright water, and bruised the white chalk—
Dash down the big bumper of new-milk and rum,
A kiss, and adieu to your lady-love—come ! º
To the box, brother ’Bus-men, and hey for the stones, s
And let those who go by us look out for their bones |
Leave the solemn old sixpenny far in the lurch,
As slow as a hearse, and as grave as a church:
Hoo! give 'em their heads, now then, stop us who dare–
Hoo! forth, tearing threepennies, forth on the fare
Whip sharp round the corners, cut close thro’ the lane!
There’s that Opposition afore us again.
He canters—we gallop—Ha! hal—that’s the pace—
He sets down—we're upon him—a race, boys! a race!
Crash over the apple-stall—pick up the fruit !
Smash into the donkey—an obstinate brute!
A short cut by the pavement! Hold on, my good team,
See the foam flies in flakes, and their sweat comes in steam ;
Ha! Gent for the City, that sitt'st at my side, -
Dost tremble to share in the 'Bus-man's wild ride?
Hah! haſ ha! talk to me of justice and law "
Pale son of the stool, hold the seat and thy jawl
Hark! what’s the wild music that greeteth our ride *
'Tis a batch of old ladies that scream from inside.
Like a whirlwind we sweep by the street where they’d stop,
But we’d not pull up now QUEEN VICTORIA to drop.
Who journies with us our good pleasure must stay—
Besides, ’tis but threepence to ride all the way—
We are bound to the Bank—what’s a threepenny fare?

Oh! there’s joy in the stormy serene of the box,
There’s joy in the sharp breeze that lifteth the locks—
There’s joy when one's pole in a rival one feels,
In the grind of his panels, the clash of his wheels—
In the crashing and cursing, the jingle and jar,
And the wild work that follows the 'Bus-men's wild war—
But, chiefest of joys—from one's foeman a fare,
By dint of strong arm, and sheer slanging to bear.
With their badges and beaks, their policemen and stuff,
They would smooth into tameness the 'Bus-man so rough:
Clap a twitch on his nose, and a drag on his wheel,
Nor leave him at will with his riders to deal—
But he laughs them to scorn, for John BULL, well he knows,
Thinks he makes up for all by the pace that he goes.
His fare’s only threepence—the public so deep,
Must take things as they come, if they will have 'em cheap.

A STORM IN A TEA-CUP.
THE Germans are making a great noise about their Fleet. Now, we
were scarcely aware that Germany had a fleet, any more than the Great
Desert. We should as soon think of calling Stoke Pogis a maritime
power as Prussia, for what an inland country can want with men-of-war
to defend it, surpasses our nautical knowledge. However, the German
Fleet has been ordered into the Mediterranean, and this order has been
followed by such a fearful cry of “Shame,” all through Germany, that
we have been prompted, out of curiosity, to look into the fact whether
the Germans have any boats or not, for we should be very sorry to sink,
(in the estimation of the world) their entire navy, by running it down
upon false grounds.
Accordingly we dispatched Waterman No. 101, to Hamburgh, and,
having, furnished him with a microscope of the strongest power, gave
him full authority to inspect the German Fleet in any º
and to send us the result of his observations.
This is his report:—
“I..never seed sich a Fleet ! I’m blessed if our Thames Navy
mitted a vegetable bull, and

“4 Richmond steamers on the doctor’s list;
“l Mud-dredging machine, mounted with a cannon;
“24 Wherries with 24 gun-barrels.
“I am, bound to state that several persons informed me that the
Garman Fleet had never been in sich an efficient state before.”
After the gratifying º of our Commissioner, we shall never
doubt the existence of the German Fleet again.
TRICKS UPON TRAVELLERS.
OUR ingenious friend the Builder, who has been the unconscious
| architect of many of our jokes—as well as of his own fortune—has sup-
plied us with a small, lot of building materials in one of his recent
advertisements. We beg the attention of the public to the following:—
WANTº to Purchase, a TRAVELLER capable of lifting 10 to 12 tons.
One that has been already used would not be objected to if complete and fitted with
the modern improvements. Letters, with particulars, may be addresssito, &c.
We confess ourselves somewhat Fº by this announcement, for
though we know that a Traveller will pick up a great deal in the course
of his travels, what can be meant by his being "capable of lifting 10 to
12 tons,” is to us a thorough mystery. The intimation that the Traveller
is to be purchased, adds to our perplexity, nor can we see what is
intended, unless a regular sell of some sort is implied in the offer of a
purchase. . There must be some allegory under the suggestion that the
|Traveller is required to lift 10 or 12 tons, and perhaps, after all, it is
somebody with the power of raising a few hun pounds that is
required. “One that has been ...; used would not,” we are told,
“be objected to, if complete and i. with the modern improvements.”
|We presume that this is an allusion to the beard, moustachios, imperials,
and other kindred adornments which seem to be regarded as “modern
improvements” by the ordinary run of Travellers.
}. stipulation for a capacity to liſt 10 or 12 tons remains still
unexplained, and we can hazard no other suggestion but that it may
have reference to some “strong man,” who may be required to travel
with a show, in the character of HERCULEs. It is now some time since
we have seen anything of the class of prodigies to which we allude, and
agentleman who could revive the old practice of holding in his teeth an
arm-chair with an adult in the seat and six children clinging to the legs,
or who is possessed of the enviable power of bending a poker across the
bridge of his nose, holding up a BAKER’s Patent Mangle by the hair of
his head, and allowing a park of artillery to be let off on the top of his
chest, would no doubt prove a very attractive novelty.

It has reached our ears that the principals of several highly respect-
able suburban boarding-schools for i." ladies have, in order to

FOLLOW MY LEADER. MR. DUNUP ON POSTAL REFORM.
OUR old friend (and his own enemy). MR. DUNUP, has written to us,
declaring his views on the new Post Office project, which it will easily
be believed he indignantly declaims against. He maintains that, *:::::
by his own experience, the delivery of letters is always much too rapid,
and he adds that every communication he receives through the post,
being always a demand for money in some form or other, comes a great
deal quicker than it is required. He objects, of course on principle,
to any addition to the labour of the Post Office Clerks, and he protests
loudly against the additional labour that would be thrown upon him,
and others of his class, in answering duns, should any arrangement be
made to augment the number of letters on any day whatever. He is of
opinion that commercial confidence is the very soul of our prosperity,
and he thinks it very desirable to keep up that confidence to the utmost
extent, by allowing as much time as possible between the sendºng of a
letter and the expectation of an answer, for he maintains, with some
show of reason, that as long as there is reason to hope that an answer
may yet come, the writer of a letter for payment of debt may retain
some slight gleam of confidence in the possibility of receiving a
remittance.
It is true that MR. DUNUP's views on the subject of the proposed
º changes, are somewhat original, but as every turn in the
|. have thought it right to lay before the public the ideas with which
our friend has favoured us.

THE LATEST MIRACLE OF MESMERISM.
THE Manchester Guardian has published a
most extraordinary statement in a letter
from one M., said to be an officer of rank
in the Royal Navy, and an unexception:
able authority. It is a pity that M. did
not sign his name in full; for those who
see M. appended to any marvellous rela-
tion, cannot help recollecting with mis-
givings, that M. stands for MUNCHAUSEN.
However, the deponent M. witnesseth
that a certain clairvoyante at Bolton, un-
able, when wide awake, to read or write,
I did, fast asleep, being cast into the mes:
* meric state, point out the present identical
position of SIR John FRANKLIN on the
map, and declare that SIR John was alive
and better than he had been, and in good
hopes of returning to £ngland in nine
months and a half. FRANKLIN, by her ac-
count, was somewhere to the north of Hudson's Bay, but to have divined
his thoughts at so great a distance, she must have been considerabl
farther north than he was. She professed to visit his ships; one of whic
was sunk; she said that some of his men were following him, and that
she saw the dead bodies of others under the snow; moreover, she des-
cribed the forests, savages, and animals that she passed in going to him:
among the latter, in particular, “one that leaps very far, supposed to be
a panther or a wild-cat; ” a wild-cat most likely, as it is probable enough
that this seer can see how the cat jumps.
But this is not all. She likewise went to visit SIR JAMEs Ross,
whom she made out to be ice-bound off Bankes's Land, and she added,
that when she saw him it was snowing heavily. She described his
looks, and the position and appearance of his ships; and stated that he
intends returning to #. when he can ; which is possible. Curi-
osity may inquire how she got to SIR JAMEs Ross? According to M.,
by means of an old letter in SIR JAMEs's handwriting; by which it is to
be understood she was placed in communication with him. Scepticism
may perhaps identify º: billet of mesmerism with the broomstick of
witchcraft. -
So much for M’s marvellous narration. O day and night, Readers,
but this is wondrous strange . The greatest wonder is that the reve-
lations concerning SIR JAMEs Ross should have been derived through
a specimen of his handwriting. A clairvoyante at this rate, could give
3. the biography of all the pupils of MR. LEWIs of the Strand.
our oldest letter will furnish the latest intelligence about you by
Inesmerlsrn.
Punch hereby advertises the Mesmeric News, a weekly paper, in
which, by means of autographs of the Ministry, and Ambassadors,
divined from by a clairvoyante, he proposes regularly to ſº diplo:
matic negotiations, proceedings at Cabinet Councils, and all the most
important secrets of State. This idea is now copyright, but will be

Three Things We Cannot Do.
THE Pavilion, that grand design for a grocer's shop, at Brighton, has
only cost £18,200 to keep in repair during the last eleven years. We
are sure that sum might have been realised if some enterprising CUBITT
had turned the useless Palace into Club Chambers—though the best
thing to purify the tainted place, would have been to convert it into
Baths and Wash-houses. But we are told the toy will share the fate
of all toys, and will shortly be broken into pieces.
There are three things in which we English are oceans behind the
$ºn. We cannot build a Palace, erect a Monument, or make
ce.
The Largest Bread-Basket in the World.
According to the Morning Chronicle, such is the waste of sewage,
“ that no less than 246,000,000, pounds of bread are flung into º:
Thames every year.” .
Reversing the ingredients in FAIstaff's bill, there is very little
sack to so much bread, so the sooner the above state of things gets the
sack the better.
A NoTE FOR MR. BRIEFLEss-You are requested to look into the

years an accessary to the fact.
CURIOUs EPITAPH IN A FoRGoTTEN CHURCHYARD.—“HERE LIES
A Box of LIFE-PILLs.”
TRAVELLING MADE UNEASY.
WE do not wonder at HER MAJESTY preferring her yacht to the rail-
way. . In the former, she can sail about without interruption. She is
not obliged to stop every half-hour to the prosy address of some prosy
Mayor. The sea, thank Heaven! is not overrun with Lord-Lieutenants.
No yeomanry, either, stop up the gang-way to go through their awkward
manoeuvres every time HER MAJESTY appears on deck; and, above all
there are no drums, or cannons, on the ocean. Oh! those eternal
cannons ! How pleased the ‘. must be to get away from them two
days together—to be able to breathe the fresh air, unpolluted by gun-
owder'ſ It must be such a treat for Royalty to enjoy itself without a
eadache—to go to bed tired and happy, and with its hearing perfectly
unimpaired.
The way in which Corporations try to catch the Royal ear is by the
moisy overture of some twenty-one guns—to induce HER MAJESTY to
listen to them, they have recourse to the beautiful Irish plan of makin
her deaf, first. This plan, disagreeable as it may be, is attende
however, with a certain advantage, for it must opportunely relieve HER
MAJESTY from the fatigue of listening to the wearisome address which
the Mayor of every Little Redlington thinks he has a right of presenting
at the Royal carriage-window as often as the Royal carriage passes
through his town. On the sea, there are none of these drawbacks. The
yacht can pursue its quiet way, free from Mayors and all other nuisances,
not forgetting the Reporters. It is clear that the Royal Family prefer
their steamer, for the simple reason, that they can enjoy nowhere
else such perfect privacy as on board of it. To speak º, the
QUEEN is never so much at home as when she is thoroughly at sea. It
is too bad, such a state of things should exist! We are all ready to
boast of England being a Land of Freedom; there may be freedom
enough for every one else, but there is very little of it for the QUEEN
when she travels.
LICENSED SHOPLIFTERS.
oME weeks or so since, according to the
Sunday Times, “John AARON, who keeps
the King of Bohemia, High Street,
Hampstead, was fined £2 for eight bad
* This was a second convic-
ion.”
This is only one out of some fifty de-
frauders, most of whom had been con-
victed for the second and third time.
The punishment, in our opinion, is much
too s º An ignorant boy is sentenced
to hard labour for months, if not trans-
ported, for stealing a pocket-handker-
chief, and yet these respectable shop-
keepers can go on robbing their poor
customers for months and months, and

against any monomaniac, or starving wretch, whom they detect shop-
lifting. What is a good punishment, when they are robbed, must be
equally good when they are the robbers, an much more so, for
whereas the first is an isolated case of robbery, and may be only. the
first offence, the robbery by fraudulent weights and measures is a
series of robberies which being perpetrated every hour of the day,
it i. impossible to calculate the number of offences, or the amount
stolen.
Accordingly, as shoplifters are always imprisoned, or transported
for several years, so we would have these licensed shoplifters
punished in the same manner. . As the law at ſº ls, every
shopkeeper has an interest in being dishonest. If he has a large
business, it is well worth his while to use false weights. What is a fine
of 20s. once a quarter to him, if he can gain a * time he uses
his fraudulent pound weight, or quart measure? hy, he would clear
as much, frequently, on the Saturday, might. . We cry out against
gentlemen who are allowed to compound for their offence at the police-
offices, by the payment of some small fine, and yet, these shºpkeepers
escape by the same means every time that they are convicted. Trade
has its golden and silver keys just as much as the peerage. If one of
these genteel cheesemongers, or aristocratic publicans, was º in the
Dock of the Old Bailey, and sentenced, like other prigs, to the mill for
three months' hard labour, we should not hear of so many instance; 9
this, the pettiest kind of petty larceny, committed behind the counter.
As it is, any tradesman can be a shopſiſter for 5s. ; he pays his money,
and can go home and repeat the same offence the next, minute.
Highwaymen are extinct, and indeed where is the fun of risking
your life when you can rob as you please, simply by, opening a shop
and using false weights and measures to any extent by paying for
them.

MR. JOHN O'CONNELL “AT IT AGAIN.”
It appears that MR. John O'Connell, no longer having the fear of
summary justice before his eyes, is in two senses of the phrase, “at it
again.
The Times, in recording the revival of the Repeal Association in Con-
ciliation Hall, on the 8th instant, reports that—
“MR. John O'CoxNELL rose, and announced the receipt of £3 10s. from the patriotic
coal-porters of George's Quay, and two or three smaller sums from individual
contributors.”
A Repeal Bill at so many months, cashed by the poor coal-porters to
the amount of £3 10s. “At it again” in sense No. 1.
Having made the above intimation—or avowal—or confession-
MR. John O'Connell, according to our contemporary, proceeded to
deliver a discourse, wherein he dared to utter the following words:-
“There was another act of Lond CLARExpos's which should not beforgotten. At
Dolly's Brae he sent the military and police to escort an Orange party while they were
committing massacres on the people.”
When MR. John O'Connell, the other day, published his “Recol-
lections and ºperiences,” it may have been hoped that he had abandoned
fictitious oratory for historical literature. Wain was such hope; and
the foregoing incorrect assertion respecting LoRD CLARENDoN compels
Mr. Punch to exclaim with reference to MR. O'Connell,—“At it
again” in sense No. 2.
Mr. Punch really knows not which to deprecate most; MR. John
O'ConnELL’s sayings, or MR. John O'Connell’s doings.
Melancholy News.
THE following paragraph appeared twice or thrice in last week's
Court Circular.
“MR. Mone O'FERRAL had yesterday an interview with Loºp John Russell."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BADEN TOO BAD'UN.
(Being the Experiences of a disgusted Father of a Family.)
IR,-AN advertisement, headed ‘Ba-
den,” has appeared in the Times any
time this summer. It holds out to
the lover of solitude the inducement
that this charming retreat is crowded
by the nobility of all countries. It
attracts visitors who want cheap and
comfortable quarters, by the assu-
rance that all its hotels are filled by
illustrious personages, and that there
is not a º: to be had, without
turning out a British duke or a
German sovereign prince. It pro-
mises peace and quietness by in-
forming you that the delightful valley
of Lichtenthal resounds from morn-
ing till night with the music of
numerous brass bands, and the clat-
tering hoofs of equestrian parties.
Persons nervous about the use of
fire-arms by the inexperienced, are also comforted by the intelligence
that numerous hunting, parties on the enormous scale of former
years, will be organised during the season. Lastly, the Parisian
who has never been at the Hippodrome, or the fnglishman who has
not had the pleasure of seeing WIDDICOMBE at Astley's, or CAROLINE
and AURIol at Drury Lane, is reminded that a peculiar feature has
been added to the establishment of Baden, in the shape of an
|
º Unable to resist these complicated attractions, I started
with my family for Baden, early this autumn.
“Now, I hate travelling abroad, loving my little English comforts and
and not understanding any
foreign language. But my
family make up a poly-
#. establishment among
them. My wiſe—between
ourselves—knows a little of
all languages, but not enough
to º: or be talked to, in
any. My girls have been
taught French, Italian, and
German, and speak something
which they assure me is the
last language, but which I
do not believe to be the
German talked by the natives
of Germany. My son JoHN,
also, professes a familiarit
with the above tongues; an
I have reason to believe he
can make himself sufficiently . .
understood to put questions in any, though I regret to say he cannot
understand the answers to them.
“Well, we got to Baden at last, and found very dear and uncomfort.
able lodgings. To be sure, a Geheimrath (whatever that may be,) had
#: turned out to accommodate us, and that seemed to satisfy my
amily.
“My son ToM had always bullied me about not smoking. Reduced
to a melancholy state of dulness, for there was’nt a soul to talk to in
the place, I thought if ever I could smoke it would be at Baden, and
tried my first cigar on the bridge, where I was accustomed to stand and
amuse myself by expecto-
rating into the stream. ToM
was with me, encouraging me.
The sentinel approached us,
and spoke: I asked Tom
what he said, who informed
me that it was a remark upon
the weather, Whatever it
was, the remark was repeated
angrily, and at last the man,
bringing his bayonet to the
charge, walked self and ToM, at the Fº of it, into his sentry box,
whence, on the arrival of the relief, we were marched off to the
Polizei, as they call the Police Office here, and I found that it was
against the laws to smoke on a bridge in this charming retreat! I need
not say in what a state MRs. Twitts and family were, on hearing of
our arrest. We were released on Fº of a fine.
“Next day, Tom, who is a bit of a coxcomb, made his appearance in
one of those wide-awake hats, which you may have seen in London.
He started on a "...i excursion: two hours after I received a note, in
pencil, informing me that he had been arrested on a charge of treason!
“I found him in custody; with some difficulty I discovered that the
proof against him, consisted in his wearing a ‘Heckerisches Hut’—
a Hecker Hat. His wide-a-wake, it seems, resembles a hat which has
been proscribed here, because it used to be worn by a MR HECKER, who
seems to have been a Baden CUFFEy. In the agitation very natural on
seeing one's son in custody for high treason, I wiped my face with a red
silk pocket-handkerchief, and was at once collared by two soldiers, and
handcuffed. I found that I was also accused of revolutionary practices,
for haying my nose, with an anarchical and of a red-colour pocket-hand-
kerchief blown,” as the interpreter rendered the charge.
“Sending for my wiſe and daughters to prove my innocence of all
revolutionary tastes and tendencies, they were taken into custody on a
charge of showing treasonable partisanship with the extreme democrats.
The charge against them was proved by their wearing red, black, and
yellow shawls, picked up, a bargain at Berlin, as all articles of those
colours might well be sold bargains, if the wearers were liable to be
treated in this un-English way. -
“But this last affair, I am thankful to say, clenched the business.
On our release, which was effected after some days, we all agreed that
Baden was not quite the delightful retreat to be chosen in troubled
times, and, if the Baden troubles had their inconveniences, I don't know
that I have any reason to complain, since they brought me back to
Clapham, where my family have remained very contentedly since.
“I you to print this record of my experience, as it may save
other f of families going abroad, and I have the honour to remain,
“Mr. Punch,
“Your harassed but obedient servant,
“John Twirts.”
“THE NEW MORALITY.”
It is told by FRANKLIN that certain Quakers contributed to the war
supplies in America, when the estimates ran for “corn and other grain.”
|Thus, they were willing to pay for any sort of grain that would shoot.
The Chronicle has a leader, somewhat in point, on what it calls the
“New Morality” of MR. Cobden, who opposes a loan to Austria to
pay for HAYNAU’s woman-whips. Let us suppose another famine, like
that of 1847,-‘‘where,” asks the Chronicle,
“Where would be the wonder if a hot and violent faction of Americans should con-
vene public meetings in New York to stigmatise, as miscreants and renegades, the
merchants who should propose to supply a rival nation with the means of subsistence?”
Surely, this can hardly be called a “New Morality.” . The Quakers
of the American war tacitly allowed it when they made grain synonymous
with gunpowder. Nevertheless, we do see a difference between a loaf
of foreign wheat, and a foreign bomb-shell bought with English money.
e do see a distinction between the outlay of funds devoted, among
other atrocities, to the scourging of women, and the imprisonment of
children, and the money spent to discharge cargoes of Indian corn into
Ireland. It is one thing to lend money to buy a sword for a HAYNAU
or a blunderbuss for a Rush–and very much another, we take it, to fee
the famishing, and shelter the houseless. Surely, money, with all its
other glorious qualities, may have morals—though not merely the morals
of the changers.
The Exchequer's Last Windfall.
THE CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER lately announced in the
Times that he had received in an anonymous letter, dated Manchester,
October 6, 1849, a Bank of England note for £100, “to be placed to
the credit of HER MAJESTY's Exchequer.” It is only because we
suspect the donor to be a lunatic that we hesitate to denounce, as a
º the man who does his country good by stealth in this
of way.
As Good As HIs word."
MR. DISRAELI assured the folks in Essex that he was ready to stake
to them “his political reputation.” True to his word, he has ordered
for Braintree Church a bran-new double-gilt weathercock.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
A RUIN AMONG RUINS.
In the old Hall of Hedingham, the Hall of the DE WEREs, .
King Time hath long held wasteful Court with his great train of Years.
They have heaved the rooftree from its hold, the hearthstone from its bed,
Rent from the wall the banner, and the ivy hung instead.
| And every night, for ages now, King Time, enthroned there,
Hath sat, with his scythe-sceptre, and his crown of hoary hair;
| And with whistling winds for music, and the pale moon for a torch,
Hath coldly marked the world roll on outside that crumbling porch.
But for one day King Time turned out, and that old hall again,
For the noiseless tread of pacing years, echoed to feet of men;
And the bottle circled merrily to songs and laughter's sound,
Instead of the grim hour-glass that the feasting years pass round.
And round about those mould'ring walls, green-ivied o'er their grey,
Flaring and flimsy banners with flimsy legends play;
And slight deal tables held the place of the massive oaken board,
Where, in hats for helms, broad-cloth for mail, sat farmer, squire, andlord.
There to an Essex audience, with drafty Essex brains, , .
Uprose a wordy, shallow man, and spoke in sounding strains;
And deft and nimble changes rung on cotton and on corn,
Sluicing Protection with his praise and Free-trade with his scorn.
The place and theme were suited well—a cause now past away,
Upheld in all its ruin in a ruin gaunt and grey;
And the fissures in the fabric, the nakedness and wreck,
Hidden in sophistries as thin as the flags those walls that deck.
Yes! Feudal thoughts and Feudal things both held their own of yore,
As this old pile mocked arrow º: or even cannon's roar;
But causes, even as castles, rise, live, and pass away,
Though cotton flags and flowers of speech make shift to mock decay.
THE MOST WONDERFUL INSTANCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.
So many wonderful instances of clairvoyance have lately astonished
the weak intellects of the public, that we feel somewhat diffident in
laying before our readers the following astonishing case, lest they should
exclaim, “Oh, this is a little too strong! We can believe a great deal,
but this surpasses everything.”
But our readers should recollect that Truth is stranger than Fiction. If
it were not for that noble copy-book maxim which inspires us with
moral courage, we should no more dare to publish the following fact
than to go up in a firework balloon with a shirt of gun-cotton on. But
as it is, we boldly defy the world, and challenge contradiction.
Here is our wonderful case:
“A young lady (whose name was not SyſITH), after having been
put into the mesmeric state, was asked, “if she could see anything
in the Vernon Gallery P* . After, a long silence, during which the
††. had to be repeated several times, she said “the place was so
ark she could not see anything. The experimentalists, however, who
had a grand discovery in view, did not despair, and she was directed to
look again, when she exclaimed, ‘Yes, I do see something; they are
like pictures; but there’s no light, and it is very difficult to observe
anything. But stop; they are pictures; they are hanging on the walls
very close, and some very low down; I can distinguish a TURNER, and
there’s a lovely MACLISE, and lots more. They are such ducks of
pictures, I never saw anything like them before. But here, the
atient was so exhausted with the effort, that it was thought expedient,
rom motives of humanity, to close the séance.”
We call the above the most extraordinary instance of clairvoyance
that has hitherto been recorded, for it establishes beyond a doubt the
important fact, which many persons have long suspected, but which no
one has yet seen with his own eyes, that there ARE PICTUREs IN THE
VERNoN GALLERY!—only a person must be gifted with the strongest
powers of clairvoyance to be able to see them. The Commissioners of
the National Gallery should appoint a Mesmeric Professor to be in
constant attendance in the cellar.
An IMAGINARY WISIT TO HOLLAND.
We have never been to Holland, but we can imagine it must be
something like the Thames Tunnel—very dark, dreary, and damp—not
exactly land, and not altogether water—but something between both.
THAT’s some comfort.
We are authorised to state that there is no truth whatever in the
rumour that the numerous relations between Government and the
ELLIotts have been suspended.
PLEASANT NEIGHBOURHOOD.
ust now there is no account-
ing for º notions of
pleasure and salubrity.
MR.IDEPUTY HICKs,with
several butchers and meat-
salesmen, thinks Smithfield
highly salubrious, and its
neighbourhood singularly
pleasant. We constantly
see advertisements in the
newspapers, announcing for
letting or sale, semi-de-
tached, villas in “pleasant
and, healthy, neighbour-
hoods;” which, when we
come to analyse the laby-
rinth of terraces, places,
crescents, and villas, which
make them up, are found
to accommodate, on an
average, half-a-dozen cow-
keepers, five gut and glue-
manufacturers, an odd soap-
boiler, and, last not least,
- a firework-maker, whose
premises are blown up, on a fair calculation, once every five years.
With the strong sense we entertain of the great advantage of bringing
such conveniences to every man's door, we cannot help feeling that
proprietors of gunpowder-mills, alkali, and other chemical works
3. noxious gases, &c., are treated with gross injustice in being
compelled—the first, to carry on their operations out of towns—the
others, to pay damages for injury done to the crops and constitutions
of those about them.
A man has not far to . now, if he wishes to be stifled with sulphu-
retted hydrogen, or to be burnt or blown up by detonating ſº
º: rocket mixture, or any other article of pyrotechnics. But wh
is he to be deprived of the pleasurable excitement of a powder-mill
overlooking his back-yard? W. is he not to enjoy the benefit of the
chimney of a sulphuric acid manufactory, giving off its smoke into his
bed-room?
It is obvious that the study of Practical Chemistry might be much
advanced, by bringing such works close to our densely-peopled neigh-
bourhoods; while the invidious distinction which at present confines
the privilege of blowing up to fire-work makers, and of poisoning to
º: ers, bone and glue-boilers, and gut-makers, would be done away
With.
We recommend an agitation, in favour of the ill-used proprietors of
powder-mills and chemical works, to MR. H. L. TAYLOR, MR. ALDER-
MAN SIDNEY, MR. Deputy Hicks, and the other wiseacres of the
Corporation of London, who have already done such good service in
defending and perpetuating vested interests in venerable nuisances
and the rights of º: citizens to go on being poisoned after the sacr
usage of their forefathers.

“DEAR PUNCH,
“I beg to say that I highly approve of what MR. SERJEANT
WILKINs said the other day at the Middlesex Sessions against shutting
up the Casinos, Talking of additional prisons and no end of lunatic
asylums being declared necessary on account of the depravity occasioned
by music and dancing licences, he said, if such was the fact, it was
‘because there was not a far greater number of places where the people—
the working classes—might have the full enjoyment of recreative amuse-
ments.’ And afterwards he said “that the people required the means
of having reasonable recreation, and none was more innocent than that
of music and dancing,” in which remark I quite agree with him.
I consider myself as one of the working classes, and I can tell you I've
a good, deal of work, to do sometimes. It’s very hard if I’m to be
obliged to stay :* my heels waiting to go on duty instead of
being able to warm them by the innocent recreation of dancing, as

THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.
THE public in general, who do not luxuriate in the perusal of the
London Gazette, may not be aware that Parliament actually met on
Tuesday the 9th of October. The report of the day's proceedings is
quite a model report, and we feel convinced that when the Legislature
meets for the dispatch of business, it will be worth while to imitate
occasionally the . and quiet scene described in the papers of the day
following. Not a speech was made, and there was accordingly no
talking to prevent the men of business from doing what they came to
do, which was to prorogue Parliament till a later period., Qnly one
member of the Lower House was in his place, and he, instead of getting
up to inflict a long harangue upon the officers of the House, was satis-
fied with looking “unutterable things,” which he was considerate
enough not to utter.

many excellent measures might be passed, if the old proverb that
“silence gives consent” were to be generally acted upon.
Town and Country Sunday.
AN unreasonable cry has been raised against the Government for
proposing to reduce Sunday post-office, work over the country, very
reatly, by increasing it in London very little. Cassio (when exceedingly

In like manner, some would seem to think, is London—by its better
observance of Sunday—to be saved before the country. A correspon-
dent has suggested a compromise between scrupulosity and convenience
by employing on Sundays, at St. Martin's-le-Grand, gentlemen of the
#. persuasion. And really this is so much like prohibiting
slavery in our colonies, and at the same time eating foreign slave-grown
sugar, that it would be but consistent to adopt our correspondent’s
suggestion.

JOHN: O'CONNELL CAPPED.
oRN O'Connell, in the ſpardonable belief that at
least the eyes of all the potatoes of Ireland would
be immediately upon him, departed a few days
since for Dublin to open Irreconciliation Hall, for
the purpose of becoming money-taker in the cause
of Repeal. The learned and eloquent gentleman
had made every necessary preparation. , “The first
flower of the earth” was renovated fresh as a daisy.
“The first gem of the sea” was reset in native
metal. The DUKE of WELLINGTON, from the
Horse-Guards, cast an anxious look towards. Ire-
land. Everybody expected new Monster Meetings,
and new Meetings of Monsters. Well, MR. JoHN
O'Connell, has shown himself in Dublin, but, for
- - some days past, the learned gentleman has not been
visible to the naked eye. It is, nevertheless, believed that he is still in
Ireland. Great anxiety has been manifested for his whereabout by an
extensive, circle of at least a dozen friends; and it is lº that his
abiding-place is known, though up to the present time he has not been
discovered. .
The following mysterious account has been given (privately before a
magistrate) by TIM Hool.AGHAN, servant of º: Q'Connel.L.. The
man deposed that the last time he saw his master, he desired him to
bring, the Repale Cap of the Liberator—the Cap presented at Tara-
that, before John went to the Hall to make a #; splash, he might
tryit on, and have it taken in, if at all too big for him.—That MR. John
Q'Connell, approaching a mighty big glass, put on the cap, which on
the sudden seemed to grow as big almost as the great lantern of the
Four Courts, covering him intirely—That he heard his master crying to
be taken “out of that,” as the cap was smothering him; that he
(TIM) cried to BIDDY DELANEY (the housemaid) to come and hel him;
that, between themselves, they pulled off the cap, but they could not,
with all their eyes, find the masther at all at all.
BIDDY DELANEY corroborated the evidence of TIM.
The Liberator's cap, collapsed to its usual size, was handed to the
magistrate; BIDDY DELANEY declaring, upon her word and honour,
that her masther was in it still; bewitched into the smallest taste in
lifeſof a Liberator }. the cap of DANIEL.
The cap was carefully examined, but the naked eye could not discover
MR. John O'ConnELL. Nevertheless, TIM declared he heard him
somewhere in the lining, crying in the smallest of the small voice of one
of the good people—
“Hereditary bondsment know ye not,” &c.
Silence being ordered in the court, the worthy magistrate, listening
with the acute ear of justice, said he believed he heard him too.
Whereupon, it was suggested that the cap should be examined with
a microscope, that—if really in the cap—the present Liberator might be
manifested to all Ireland.
At the time of our going to press, no microscope had been procured.
However, let the matter end as it will, the story should be awarning to
pigmies not to meddle with the caps of giants. Smothering is the
least that comes of it.
SANITARY STREET NOMENCLATURE.
The names of our London streets exhibit a disgraceful tautology.
We are afraid to say how many Peter Streets, John Streets, and, above
all, Wellington Streets there are in the metropolis. Let this fault be
amended. Let the streets be called by their proper names; that is to
y; at present, by the various nuisances or diseases which infest or
É. them, respectively... As, Open Sewer, Street; Gully Hole
urt;. Slaughter House Buildings: Shambles Place; Knacker's Yard;
Grave Yard Crescent; Charnel Square; Typhus Terrace; Scarlatina's
Rents; Intermittent Row; Consumption Alley; Scrofula Lane;
Cachexy Corner. Let such, at least, be the provisional momenclature
of the streets of Londor, till this filthy capital shall have been properly
drained and watered; shall have had its churchyards closed, its atmos.
phere disinfected, and plague and pestilence expelled from its habitations.
A SINKING FUND WITH A WENGEANCE.
MR. DISRAELI advocates a sinking fund; but were the honourable
gentleman's financial schemes adopted, it is to be feared that the fund
which would assume a sinking character would be the National Income.
BINDING ON AUSTRIA.
FALCONBRIDGE, in King John, recommends Austria to “hang a calf.
skin on those recreant limbs.” At the present day he could hardly
have recommended such a binding in calf, seeing that Austria is already
bound in Russia.
A THAMES DRINKING SONG.
Away to the cistern, each thirsty soul,
And set the tap a-going,
While murkily into the dingy bowl
The stream is thickly flowing !
If sorrow we cannot always drown,
From our sight we can always thrust it;
The filth in the water will keep it down,
And the sediment will o'ercrust it.
Then hey for the cistern, each thirsty soul,
And bury your cares in the mud-girt bowl!
Let revellers boast of their choicest wine,
Contented let them drink it;
'Tis not so rich as this liquor of mine,
Whatever they may think it;
They boast of its body, but come and see
The Thames, and impartially view it ;
Full-bodied, indeed, it fain must be,
While the dogs and the cats run through it.
Then hey for the luscious Thames . . I swear,
If you look for body, you’ll find it there.
DISPARITY AMONG THLEVES.
“MR Punch,
“I am just come out of the House of Correction, where I have
been for two months, for nothing more than just taking a pocket-hand-
kerchief-not worth more than twopence, if truth’s anything in this
world—from the pocket of a ticket-porter. Two months, Mr. Punch,
and harder oakum I never picked.
“Well, I’ve just read the newspaper at the Barrington Arms. And
there I find sixteen tradesmen all convicted of robbing their customers.
And are they sent to the stone jug Not a bit of it. They pay their
money for their right to rob, because they pick pockets—not in the

IRISH BITTER BEERS.
WE are glad to see a gradual improvement in the well-known Irish
Bitter Beers. Originally, these Beers were single X, Er-ecrated.
Since the Dolly's Brae affair, they have been known as double X,

X, Er-ecrated, Er-posed, and Er-justices of the Peace.
Novel and Interesting Match.
A stout old gentleman with the gout has, for a trifling wager
backed himself to walk from Notting Hill to the Bank against one of
the omnibuses on that road. Although the old gentleman is by no
means a fast walker, yet, such are the dawdling propensities of the
driver and conductor of the vehicle, that bets are 20 to 1 in favour of
the elderly pedestrian.

Mother. “AND PRAY, Doctor, what ARE Your TERMs For Heducating LITTLE Boys!”
The Principal. “Why, My DEAR MADAM, My usual TERMs ARE seventy guineas per ANNUM (To use The
LANguage of THE ANcient Romans), But to EFFECT My object (?) Quickly, I would TAKE A few For
what I could ger, provided they be GENTLEMEN, Like your DEAR LITTLE Boy THERE: But (Again
To use THE LATIN Tongue). It is a sive qua Now THAT THEY should BE GENTLEMEN 111”
YOU CAN'T MAKE A PURSE, ETC.
We have for some time observed, repeated at short intervals in the Times, the following advertisement:—
O THE ARISTOCRACY AND GENTRY.-The Principal of a First-Class School, wishes to increase his
connection. His average terms are 70 guineas. To secure his object quickly, he offers to receive a few pupils at 40 guineas,
º: they be gentlemen. The latter condition is a sine qua non. Terms inclusive. References of the highest order could
given.
We are glad to see that, however much pure snobbism there may be in the world, there is not yet enough
to enable the advertiser to “secure his object quickly,” for, since his announcement first fell under
our eye and caused us to turn up, our nose, some months have expired. There is something exquisitely
mean in, the proposition to smuggle in a few 40-pounders among the 70-pounders, and we are delighted
to find º e offer has not been clutched at by persons ready to avail themselves of such a shabby
arrangement.
The condition that the low-priced pupils should be gentlemen is most absurd, foritis quite impossible that
they could be gentlemen's sons, since no gentleman would send his son to a concern, whose Principal takes £40
from the parents of some of his pupils to enable him to get £70 from others, who are not in the secret of
the little arrangement by which the head of the concern is “securing his object.” We are sorry to see the
educators of youth adopting the disgraceful haberdashery trick of asking one price and taking another, the
demand being regulated not by the worth of the article, but by the gullibility ºthe purchaser,
THE WINTER BLOCKADES OF LONDON.
THE usual blockading of London for the winter season has commenced at several points, and the Strand is
already in the hands of a hostile pavioury. We think that the name of this great leading thoroughfare
ought to be immediately changed, and that the title of the Kia Pavia ought to be given to it. By the
blockade now established, a vehicle may have to go half a mile round to a spot, though literally within a
stone's throw of it. The invading force of paviours would appear to be overrunning the whole tract of land
eastward of Charing Cross, for, even when apparently retiring from one §. it is only to take up another
immediately adjoining it. If the City had a heart of stone, it would be like tearing its heart out continually,
to treat it in the manner that it is constantly undergoing at the hands of the paviours.
We had writtenthus far, when news reachedus of Piccadilly having fallen into the hands of the barbarians:
the whole tide of the western traffic has been thrown in copious streams upon the narrow creeks in the
vicinity. Albemarle Street has been flooded with omnibuses for several days, and Dover Street, like the
Straits of Dover, has had an uninterrupted stream running through it, with frightful impetuosity. We have
heard the Parks described as the lungs of the Metropolis, but when the circulation is . so near the
lungs, the vitality of commerce appears to be jeopardised... We wish some modern, Hannibal would make
his appearance, to Fº the feat of cutting through the really Alpine mass of stone that blocks up aſportion
of the Strand and Piccadilly, once at least in every winter. As vinegar has, on a previous occasion, achieved
the grand object, it is possible that a little of our essence of acidity, which we are very happy to supply
in a good cause, may effect the desired object.
GOOD MEN, SPARE THAT
TREE.
Dedicated to ME. H. L. Taylor, on the
strength of his calling Smithfield an Oak.
Good men, spare that tree,
Lop not a single bough;
Its fruit has long fed me,
And I’ll protect it now.
That tree's an ancient Oak,
To which I owe my prog;
Oh, do not idly joke,
And tell me I’m a hog'
Smithfield, the sweet, the clean,
Is that Oak, dear to me;
Ask me not what I mean !
By calling it a tree!
The breezes through its twigs |
Amid its branches play,
And of balm-breathing pigs t
The perfume waft away.
Sweet flowers around it blow,
Whence odours rich ascend;
There wild musk-roses grow;
With cowslips violets blend.
And there the patient ox
Enjoys serene repose,
nhurt by drovers' knocks
O'er head, horns, eyes, and nose.
Its wholesome precincts migh
You’ll never find disease;
Typhus is all my eye,
Around this tree of trees.
No ſever-case you meet,
And very little loss
Of life in Turnmill Street,
Orin, or near, Cow Cross.
Oh! come, ye sufferers pale,
Come, lodge in Greenhill's Rents,
Wherein you may inhale
Oak's reviving scents.
Then do not let it fall,
That Oak, so dear to me,
And oh! by no means call
My Oaka Upas Tree.
:
Carpet Bag-ishness.
MR. WALKER, speaking of the
St. Giles', churchyard in London,
says, “inless than 10 acres, it con-
tains 48,000 bodies.” A £ondon
churchyard is very like a London
omnibus. It can be made to carry
any number. If there is no room
inside—no matter, there is always
lenty of accommodation outside.
he same with a London church-
yard-number is the last consider-
ation. - -
There are three things, in fact,
which are never by any accident
full. These are: The Pit of a
Theatre, an Omnibus, and alondon
Churchyard. The latter combines
the expansiveness of the two for-
mer, with the voluminousness of
the Carpet Bag.
A Movem. ENT IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.—Of all popular move-
ments we do not know of one from
which the public is likely to derive
so much benefit and immediate im-
provement as the movement of all
churchyards out of town.

THE RICHEST LAY-MAN IN ENGLAND.
EARGUs O'ConnoR has been offering “to lay
down his life” ever since we recollect him.
At the late Norwich Meeting he repeated the
same offer. We never knew a man so liberal
with his life. He lays it down on every
| public occasion. The great object of his life,
in fact, seems to be to lay it down. His only
competitor in this line is John O'ConnEIL,
and he falls far short of him. John's offer
was simply to die on the floor of the House
of Commons, but FEARGUs makes no limit;
he takes in all. He offers to die anywhere, no
matter whether it is Land's End, Gravesend,
or Snigg's End. The most extraordinary thing
is, how small a trifle will provoke this libe;
rality. It is only sufficient to contradict
FEARGus, to elicit from him, the magnani;
mous promise to lay down his life. If any of
his statements are doubted, he at once puts
their truth beyond all possible, doubt by pub-
licly offering to lay down his life. It is won-
derful how he has lived so long for a man who
has been laying down his life every week
for such a number of years! We forget how
often he has made this liberal offer, this tremendous sacrifice of self
with regard to the unfortunate Land, Scheme. It is lucky he has
never been taken at his word, or else where would you be, FEARGus,
at the present moment?
THE IRISH ORANGE FLOWER.
The Irish Orange Flower needs a new nomenclature. We offer one
with diffidence. - - -
Aur ANTIAHIEERNICA (Irish Orange)....Leaves, prickly and lanciform.
Flowers (of speech), of a blood-red; Pistils, loaded.
HABITAt.-Abounds in Ulster, and north of Ireland generally, and
found scattered over the whole of that island. - -
Quality.—Pulp of fruit, bitter, with juices acrid and profuse. Rind,
hard. Leaves, sour.
Uses—Produces in abundance the acute and
Odium Theologicum, which is distilled by aid of
uses, none. - -
The plant is not so, abundant or fructiferous as it was, as the
authorities have ordered it to be rooted up wherever found, but it is
still highly mischievous in its operation, and fatal accidents frequently
occur from the rash use of it in Ireland. -
The symptoms of poisoning, by means of this plant, are great
iddiness, with a disposition to talk wildly, and foaming at the mouth,
ollowed by raving of the samerabidkind that is caused by hydrophobia.
The patient shows a disposition to violence, and all deadly weapons
should be kept out of his way, or he may injure himself or others. , No
curative treatment has been discovered, except excision from the body
to which they belong, of members affected by the dreadful conse-
quences of this vegetable poison.

PUNCH . gives notice to MR. Hicks, MR. SHARP, and others,
Common Councilmen of the City of London, that he intends to renew
Martyrdom in Smithfield—the punishment to be inflicted on anti-
sanitarian heretics. , Certain gentlemen made it so clear at the Common
| Council of Wednesday, last week, that they have a stake in Smithfield,
as to leave Mr. Punch no alternative but to roast them.

A Party in Ruins.
. It is a curious fact—if not coincidence—that the late grand Protec:
tionist meeting at Hedingham was held in the old hall of the ruined
castle. The *. attribute this singular circumstance to the
great demand for tickets of admission to the enjoyment of MR. Dis.
RAELI's eloquence, but Punch ascribes it to a predilection for ruinous
places, in which feeling Protectionists sympathise with bats and owls.
RESOLUTIONS AGAINST ROWLAND HILL,
“I’ve asked that question of the HILLs.”—Ion.
A Most judicious, dispassionate, impartial, and reflecting public—re-
resented by London's bishop, bankers, merchants, shopkeepers, and
eepers of º resolved at divers meetings to disbelieve the
authorities of the Post Office, the oralayowals of Lord JoHN RusseII,
and written and printed English. “I will be drowned, and nobody
shall save me,” cried the Irishman, floundering in the Liffey. “Sunday
shall be desecrated, and nobody shall deny it,” exclaim the Sabbatarians.
All this shows zeal, however it may lack common charity. Not to believe
the grave avowal of the Prime Minister, a gentleman of most scrupulous
honour, and withal, a firm religionist,--is somewhat eccentric, but still
a very lively illustration of a belief in Christianity; it is, indeed, religion
at high pressure. No doubt the scepticism º rage for another fort-
night before it enters a transition state. No doubt a dozen meetings or
more will be held, whereat energetic gentlemen will denounce what is
never to exist, and roll their terrible thunders at nothing. We therefore
offer a few, resolutions to be used at the discretion of the various
speakers, who, like their predecessors, would arm themselves to the
teeth for an annihilating fight when there is nobody to fight with. DON
QUIxote at least had wind-mills to battle with. #. Postal QUIxotes
first imagine the wind-mills, and then lay swashing blows about their
victims. However, we give a few model resolutions:—
I. Resolved, That, MR. Row1AND HILL contemplates the total
desecration of an English Sunday.
II. Resolved, Not to admit of any denial to the contrary, set forth
by the said Row1AND HILL, however distinctly asserted, however
lucidly developed.
III. Resolved, That the employment of 25 clerks in London for a
couple of hours of Sunday will not set free a thousand clerks on the
same day in the country. And if it does—what of it?
IV. Resolved, That every London householder—the unhallowed
determination of RowLAND HILL carried into effect, which it never
shall be-will receive not less than ten letters every Sunday.
W. Resolved, That every man, receiving ten letters on the Sabbath,
will cause at least ten stationers' shops to be open in the neighbour-
hood, that pens and paper may be obtained to answer the same.
WI. Resolved, That, ten letters being received, and to be answered,
no man will go to Church.
VII. Resolved, That, no man going to Church, no man will pay
Church rates.
VIII. Resolved, That, no Church Rates being paid, the Church will
cease to exist.
IX. Resolved, That the Church, as by law established, ceasing to
exist, Englishmen will lapse into the original state of their infidel
ancestors.
X. Resolved, That Englishmen, so lapsing, will fall into the habits
of ancient Britons,—whereby the tailors, hatters, boot-makers, cotton-
spinners, and other trades, will be utterly and for ever annihilated.
XI. Resolved, That LoRD, John Russell, committed a gross and
unwarranted outrage upon the vested ignorance, of a most obtuse
deputation when he said he “really thought that the public would not
understand the nature of the measure until they had experienced it.”
XII. Resolved, That understanding has nothing to do with experience.
XIII. Resolved, That experience has still less to do with under-
standing.
RELIGIOUS WEAPONS!
... The most doubtful . everheard of in connection with Rome has,
it is said, been published by Pio Nono. According to the Times,"
*The Pope has directed a certain number of decorations to be distributed to the
troops that had contributed to the restoration of the Holy See. The decoration consists
of a medal with the following inscription:- Pius IX., P. M., collatis armis Catholicis
in suam sedem restitutus, Amno ... "
The Pope restored to his See by the conjoint Catholic arms! Prus
has been restored by bombs and cannon, and bayonets. Mr. Punch was
not aware that such weapons are Catholic arms; but on this point, of
course, his Holiness is a better authority than Mr. Punch.

Mr. Pips
Thursday, October 11, 1849.--To the Docks, to meet MR. SoKER, and
go over the Wine Vaults with a Tasting-Order, and taste the Wine
there before it hath undergone any Roguery for the Market. Found
there SoKER, and MR. WAGSTAFFE, and Swilby, and Swype, and 5 or 6
more, and with them MR. GooDFELLowe, who had gotten SokER the
Order. First to the Quay, heaped with Barrels of Wine, close as
Pebbles on a Beach, and one huge Barrel, they did tell me, holding 625
Gallons, and I wondering how it could have been hoisted ashore, MR.
WAGSTAFFE did say, by an Adjutant, or Gigantic Crane. Then, through
all Manner of Casks, and Tubs, and Bales of Merchandise, to St.
Katherine's Dock, and down to the Vault, where a Cooper forthwith
did wait on us with a Couple of Glasses, and gave each Man a flat Stick
with a Lamp at the farther End, to see our Way, and we lookedlike Goblins

us Biscuit, and recommend us to eat, and I did take his Advice, and
glad I did. Here, more Curiosities in Mildew, º from the Roof;

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
A GUY FAWKES WANTED.
OSSIBLY it has—no, it cannot have escaped
the melancholy conviction of the real friends
of the British Constitution that, for years
A past, there has been an alarming decrease
of the number of GUY FAwkeses on the
solemn Fifth of November. This down-
ward tendency is, of course, the result of
ascendant Popery. We are a commercial
people, of the most wonderful organisation
-touched to the “finest issues.” The
pocket is marvellously developed in English-
men. The pockets of other people are, for
§)
... the most part, mere holes; lateral º:
dumb, insensible pouches. Now, the pocket of an
Englishman has wondrous sensibility. t may seem
no whit better than cotton or brown holland; never- |
theless, every thread of it is a nerve of most exquisite
irritability; harmonising or jangling with the pineal
gland that is the crown and sovereign top of man's
º nature. This development, we say, has a special
delicacy in the case of an Englishman. And it is to
this acute organisation of the pocket membrane that,
of late years, we have had an alarming decrease of
the number of Guy FAwkEses.
The prime cause is tragically obvious. We have
a Papist Master of the Mint
Isit too much to believe that every unit of the
millions of pieces of coin, struck under the baleful
influence of the Papist Master, carries with it an
enervating influence, immediately felt in the
pocket of the receiver, and almost electrically con-
veyed to the seat of his understanding P Is this too
much to believe? By no means: it is very little
indeed, to accept; and with a docile will, remarkably
tasy of credence. Not a single threepenny piece,
issued under the Mastership of Richard SHEII, that
is not a blow struck at Protestant ascendancy. The
principles of the pocket tampered with, and farewell
to the judgment. And thus, ſº man, in his
unholy greed of half-crowns, has wickedly neglected
his Guy FAWKESEs.
However, even through the present darkness,
there breaks one star-like point of light. It is not
too late to appeal to the remorse of Englishmen
through the blessed influence of a Fifth of November
close at the threshold. Let us be stirring. Let us
have a Guy Fawkes in every street, in every lane,
in every court, in every alley. Let the walls of
London resound with a carol, specially made for the
eventful purpose: a carol, ringing like a chime of
bells, through every j -
There is a choice of Guy FawkEses. The British
Constitution is, again to be destroyed—supposing
and hoping at the time we write that it has not
already ceased to be—by three known conspirators.
There may be thirty, or three hundred; but—we are
pushed for room—we must be content with three.
Richard LALOR SHEIL–Rowland HILL–LoRD
John Russell ! -
Here is a pleasing, and withal perplexing choice
of culprits. Nevertheless, with our amount of
population, and with the bonfire of zeal that this
small sheet of paper will light up in the heart of
every true Englishman, we may fairly promise our-
selves the pleasure of seeing all the three a thou-
sand times multiplied on the Glorious Fifth-may meet them at every
| step, and hear their attributes roared and bellowed at .# corner.
| #. LALOR SHEIL has powerſul claims on the indignation and
hatred of every monied Briton. N. an Englishman with a single tester in
his nervous pocket that has not sixpenn'orth of wrong against the Master
of the Mint. For that Englishman's principles of religion and loyalty have
been tampered with in their extreme weakness. They have been subtly
played with by the coined agents of the sorcerer, and—to crown the
iniquity—they have, within a few weeks, been made unconscious traitors
to }. QUEEN; become accessories to the horrible fact of depriving her of
her dearest privileges. For further particulars, see the new florin. The
Herald of t; morn—the cock that, emulating meaner poultry, always
saves the British Capitol-denounces the defrauded florin, and calls for
vengeance upon the wretch, who attributes to Majesty itself the omission
of Dei Gratid as it “would give the coin a more emphatic character.”
Hear the cock crow at this. “One’s rage rises at the intense wicked.
mess!”. Again. “If the author of these two lines were put upon his
trial before an impartial judge and jury, he would be happy to esca
with nothing worse than transportation for life!” Happy! he would
dance his gratitude in a hornpipe of ſetters. But, no; impartiality could
not so part with him. He would be hung, decapitated, quartered. And,
of course, his four quarters—with the royal compliments, in hampers
under the royal seal to four loyal journalists—would adorn the outer
walls of either office. Such a display would make the fortune of any
journal; to the utter discomfiture of the small peddling folks who onl
deal in art-murder, and with dullest flavour, render homicide on ..
“It was Satan,” cries the aforesaid cock, “who aimed at “a more
emphatic position,” when he struck the Dei Gratid out of the florin.”
Truly, a hard blow at the divine right of silver. But, it is evident, the
evil principle resides in the Master of the Mint; and if, as Englishmen,
we venerate our Queen, and love our homes, and worship our sixpences,
it behoves us to exhibit and burn the effigies of Richard LALOR SHEII.
as the arch-conspirator, the GUY FAwkes of 1849.
We, call upon, every loyal householder to contribute º;
towards the exhibition and the closing conflagration. Old hats, ol
coats, old, rush-bottomed chairs. . The masquerade shops in their
K. will, doubtless, furnish masks at cost price. Everybody—the
umblest—can give something. Even beggary may manifest the
brightness of its zeal in a brimstone match.
And here, a cheering opportunity presents itself to those members of
the monied interest, who see in the florin an instrument of Popery.
Bankers, stockbrokers, merchants, and others, most intimate with the
coin of the realm, may volunteer as chairmen to carry about the effigies
of the Mint Guy, and gather money, to be afterwards in blankets, coals,
and candles, duly distributed. We have an earnest hope to see Guy
SHEIL in Lombard Street—to meet him upon 'Change. The closing
bonfire must be lighted on Tower Hill; and we call upon the authorities
of the Bank of England to supply a sufficient quantity of fuel in con-
demned Bank notes.
Rowland HILL, as another, and doubtless º: conspirator
against the peace and happiness of the kingdom, will be very notorious
on the Fifth. Englishmen will shamefully fail if they do not club
together to send a Row LAND HILL into every street. And when we
read the speeches, and letters, and advertisements of certain men and
bodies of men, magnanimously bound together not to believe—to make
a heroism of distrust in plain *f; P. in plain words—when we
reflect upon these champions of the False and the Obscure, we feel
confident that even among the “most respectable” will be found volun-
teers to carry Guy Rowland HILL from door to door, and chant the
desecration he never proposed—the wickedness he will not perpetrate.
And further to illustrate the no-meaning of the apocryphal wrong, let
Guy Fawkes HILL carry alighted lamp, filletted by charitable zeal with
this inscription- Good Christian people; this is not a flaming lamp,
but a black dark lanthorn.” And further, the “Minute submitted to
the Post-Master-General” by Guy HIII, shall be hung topsy-turvy
about the effigy's neck,-as read upside-down by pious wiſfulness
at public meetings, And, at the close of the Glorious Fifth, hundreds
of effigies of Guy Row LAND HILL shall be consumed in St. Martin's le.
Grand, the Bishop or LoNDoN kindly lighting the first fire, and with his
apron fanning the early blaze. - - - - -
LoRD John Russell, as the third abetting culprit, merits special
ignominy; Because a knot of righteous men will not take his word;
because they ring every syllable of his lordship suspiciously, as though
every syllable were a bad shilling, when the Premier has never yet been
known to utter counterfeits; because they insist upon twisting his
truth to their false interpretation;–because of this, and more than this,
LoRD JoHN's effigy must be chaired in highways and bye-ways, on the
coming Fifth, as LoRD GUY FAwkEs John, and his entrails of straw con-
sumed by fire in Palace Yard to slow music. -
We earnestly beseech all men of great º and little thought—
men of much zeal and small charity—men of large faith in themselyes
and of no belief in others, to be up and doing against the Glorious Fifth,
Let committees be formed in every parish to receive old clothes, old
chairs, and every wherewithal to manufacture GUY FAWKEs SHEIL, Guy
FAwkes HILL, and GUY FAwkes Russell. -
And let influential men—of the classes above recited—who are
desirous of carrying and attending the GUY from door to door, give in
their names j. delay. Let the Fifth of November, 1849, burn,
like an enduring blue-light, down through all posterity. - - -
Let not the women of England be behind, in their subscriptions for
the national bonfire. All can give something. The smallest lucifer
gratefully received. A LITTLE BIRD.

We should recommend a few of the celebrated dogs of St. Bernard’s

and its neighbourhood, with lanthorns in their mouths, to serve as
guides to the benighted wayfarers. A few domestic puppies, or umhappy
dogs of footmen, have already been engaged on this philanthropic
service, and may be seen after sunset acting the part of glow-worms, or
walking gas-lights, in attendance upon the ambulatory inhabitants of the
vicinity. We feel it our duty to ridicule the Pºnt darkness of Eaton
Square, as the readiest way of making light of it.
Conscience, Avaunt!
SoME curiosity is naturally excited as to who the parties can be that
from time to time forward sums of conscience money to the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER We understand that a considerable portion of the
sums thus sent proceeds from West End tailors and other tradesmen who
thus make a kind of partial alonement for their overcharges to their
customers. It has been rumoured that MR. DUNUP intends, contri-
buting one shilling as conscience money, being exactly one-eighth per

file there, togive it variety. |G
A STOCK OF ADMIRALS, CAPTAINS, & GENERALS,
SUFFICIENT TO LAST FOR THE NEXT 100 YEARs.
ENGLAND has a capital Naval and Military stock. She has 150 Ad-
mirals, and only 15 of them are employed. What a notion it must give
a foreigner of the unbounded wealth of our country, when he considers
that we can afford to keep 135 Admirals merely to help 10 others to do
their work! This monster drove of Hyde Park DRAKEs—these 135
Nelsons on horseback—must be quite happy to take a turn occasion:
ally at the wheel of some Chelsea steamer, iſ simply to keep their hand
in. We should not much wonder if one *f; the berth of Captain on
board the halfpenny Moonshine; if another had his flag flying from the
stays of the Lass of Richmond; whilst every hºaterman that steams to
reenwich or Woolwich will probably have either a Red, or a Blu-, or
a Yellow Admiral on its paddle-box shouting as lively as possible, “Ease
'er!” “Stop 'er.” They must do something to keep up their nautical
knowledge, or else when they are ordered to take the command of a
squadron, º will know less about a ship even than Lord JoHN
Russell, or the EARL of ELLENBoRough.
But if we have an ocean of Admirals, with only a º: Square
Basin to put them in, we have likewise a whole parkful of Captains,
and nothing but charity boys to give them to lead to victory. The
ignorant reader, who has no notion of the immense resources of his
country, will scarcely believe that we possess no less than 780 Captains.
He probably did not think there were so many in the whole world, but
whilst he is rather pleased to learn that England is so richly provided
with Captains, he cannot help wondering how she can want such alarge
number. His astonishment is perfectly natural, and we should know
better than to laugh at it, for England does not want 780 Captains any
more than she wants 780 Prime Ministers, and so she very wisely
employs only as many as, she wants, and pays the remainder for
ravaging the ball-rooms and laying waste all the young ladies' hearts,
or doing anything they please, which liberal privilege the Captains
generally avail themselves of. England therefore only º: 180 Cap-
tains, and as she does not want the other 600, they are allowed to keep
company with the 135 Admirals, who are in a similar predicament to
themselves, and have nothing to do, and are only kept in for fear
there should be something for them to do at some time or other. The
same generosity is shown by our economical Government to our brave
Generals, for, whilst we have 340 Generals, we have only 120 Regiments,
so that every Regiment has nearly three Generals a-piece.
The ignorant reader above alluded to will, doubtlessly, maintain that
this excessive prodigality of command proves bad generalship some.
where, but we beg to assure him that a General is not a thing that is
made in a day, and so it is necessary always to keep a stock on hand.
It is true that we have Admirals, without, ships; Captains, without
soldiers; and Generals, without regiments; but this, far, from being a
waste, is the strictest economy, and is easily explained by the simple fact
that it is much easier to build a ship than to make an Admiral; an
that it is the simplest thing in the world to enlist a soldier and raise a
i. but the great difficulty is to find Captains and a General
or them.
Therefore, if the ignorant reader, whose narrow-minded objections
we have done him the honour, not only to listen to, but to refute, still
persists in calling this a system of waste, and that, if it is persevered
in, we shall soon be having Field-Marshals without an army, Bishops
and Archbishops without a single soul to cure, CoLoREL RowANs
without a blessed policeman, and an overflow of Beadles without a
single pauper; and that the consequences of such reckless extravagance
must, very rapidly, be a Government without Funds, and a National
Debt without end; it is very clear that he understands, nothing at all
about it. We always find it the best way with a man like the one in
question, who cannot convince you, and will not be convinced, to
finish the argument by calling him a nincompoop, which accordingly we
o in the present instance. Reader, you are to consider yo
called a “Nincompoop.”
Interesting and Daring Challenge.
MR. FEARGus O'Connor has challenged the House of Commons for
£100 aside “to lay down his life” 272 times, and to pick, it up again,
in the course of one year. We understand that he is backed to a very
large amount by some of the wealthiest Liſe Insurance Companies in
the City, who place the greatest confidence in the honourable member's
powers of longevity. No answer has yet been sent to MR. O'Connor's
liberal offer. The reason for this curious apathy is founded, we are
informed, upon the absurd belief that the indelatigable M. P. is sure
top-rform the astonishing feat, no matter whether he is challenged or
not. In the meantime he is in capital condition, hawing been in training
now for several years.

SONG OF THE SENSITIVE BUS-MAN.
Solitude I’d learn'd to suffer;
Isolation I could bear:
But I felt my spirit humbled
By the lowering of the fare.
Oh! the public, iron-hearted,
Grinding our employers down;
Making us, for paltry coppers,
Drive them in and out of town.
CoMRADEs, gather closely round me,
Comrades, lend me all your ears;
Take your seats and give your orders,
Call for your respective beers.
Comrades, I’m a man of sorrow,
Plodding o'er life's weary way;
Triving two reluctant horses
Six-and-thirty miles a day.
On a 'bus I spend my hours,
From my box I ne'er descend;
How in such a situation
Can I ever make a friend?
If by chance should sit beside me
One with feelings like my own,
Ere the journey is comple
I am once more left alone.
And the animal
But they share our degradation,
For we take them now, of course,
By a lower range of 'busses,
And a lower class of horse.
Meanness meanness thus engenders,
Poor the triumph! deep the shame!
For the vehicle is seedy,
is lame. l
True it is we sometimes whirl them
Through the streets with frantic speed ;
But 'tis madness in the driver,
Desperation in the steed.
Into swiftness we may lash him,
Kº: we º: to let }. i.
nowing, it we give him leisure,
Nature will *. drop.
Comrades, ’tis a sorry business,
Comrades, 'tis a grievous tale;
Let me drown my recollections
In a glass of Burton Ale.
Take me where the beers are mildest,
| Lull me in oblivion's dream—
Carry me where unmolested
I may taste the valley's cream.
THE HISTORIAN IN LEICESTER SQUARE.
rRY lately wetook a walk with
MacAULAY round some of the
London squares—if we may
be allowed the vulgar privi.
lege of talking of going º:
a square-and our promenade
extended as far as Soho and
Bloomsbury. In reference to
these once fashionable loca-
lities MR. Macaulay, makes
the following observations:-
.*Foreign princes were car.
ried to see Bloomsbury Square
as one of the wonders of
#. Soho Square, which
had just been built, was to
our, ancestors, a subject of
pride with which their pos:
terity will hardly sympathise.”
Should another MacAulay be in existence a century hence—we can’t
hope for his earlier appearance, inasmuch as one such man in a century
is the utmost we have a right to expect— we can imagine his writing
in the following eloquent strain of the Leicester Square, of the present
day, from the data which our own immortal pages will have furnished
him with:—
“The square of Leicester was a kind of back-wood in the very centre
of civilisation, for the polite arts had never found admission within its
palings. On its borders stood a half-savage race of cabmen, who seemed
to have caught all the wildness of the spot, and who *::: to lose
what little cultivation they might have possessed, directly they came
within its brutalising influence. Within its dreary enclosure, the
scream of the cat rose in shrill echo to the bark of the dog, while the
howl of distress burst from the unwashed lips of squalid and neglected
infancy. In the centre, the stone effigy of royalty stood as a target for
the brick-bats of a brutalised mob of youthful outcasts, whose arms
were nerved rather by a spirit of mischief than by any dangerous
hostility to the institution emblemed by an armless, noseless, and
almost footless figure of a monarch, without a friend to shield him from
the cold by the thinnest coat of the cheapest white-wash. In the middle
of the day, leap-frog was openly played in what was once a well-kept
garden, and the peg-top spun, in careless security, under the very eye
of the police, while the marble rolled with impunity over the gravel
path, which had not for years been trodden by the sober footstep of
authority. - - - - -
“The Square-keeper, though an officer flourishing in the full plenitude
of power in all the º: squares, was, in the Square of Leicester,
as unknown as he would have been at the mouth of the Sphinx, or at
the foot of the Apennines. Such was, Leicester Square in the very
middle of the nineteenth century—in the middle of a cºntury, which
had brought Beadledom to its highest altitude, which had planted the
staff of power in the Arcadian solitudes of the Arcade of Exeter, and
which had made the names of Street-keeper, of Square-keeper, and of
Beadle, synonymous with power, with greatness, and with retributive
justice in the ears of mischievous youth, as well as of menaicant
maturity.’,
BEAUTIES OF HAYNAU.
It is the opinion of ladies that HAYNAU, like a tiger, may be hand-
some; but that, however much they may approve of his features
generally, they should by no means admire his lashes.
AN OFFER TO EMBRACE ALL ENGLAND.
AMongst the many plans sent in for the drainage of the metropolis,
one of them is not satisfied with stopping at London, but runs all over
the Kingdom. It is thus described by the author, W. W. C.
*in. ing any planſor the sewerage of the me lis, it is my opinion that the
scheme should emi not onl
the :* nly the metropolis and its neighbourhood, but
There’s a comprehensive scheme for you! Imagine England being
"embraced” by a 1000 sewers! We wonder if the Isle of Wight would
be taken in the “embrace,” and whether Ireland also would be included
within the wide circumference of its charms?
We do not see how Scotland can expect to be “embraced!” If she
wants drains, why (as they say at the tea-table) “she must sweeten
herself.”. But if this monster scheme (which beats every other one
“hollow”) should ever be carried out, and W.W.C. is kind enough to
tell us “it is only a question of expense,”—England must carefully avoid
all convulsions. The slightest agitation, and the whole kingdom might be
swallowed up in an ocean of sewers. If there was any strong excitement
London might suddenly disappear as under a trap. Its hilality every
Christmas Day would have to be regulated by º, Police. Families
would be ordered to romp to slow music, and festive, parties strictly
enjoined to dance to nothing quicker than a Dead March, for they
would be dancing over a mighty gulph, it may be over a volcano. The i
latter notion has nearly made us leap off our chair. -
It is horrible to think that any thoughtless GILBERT GURNEY
—any modern Gent of a GUY FAUx—who was given to practical
joking, might, by filling these hollow tubes with a train of gunpowder
send all England in a moment “to smithereens.” The explosion would
communicate from one end of the kingdom to the other, and the Consti-
tution of England be undermined and completely broken up, like that
of a drunkard, by having swallowed too many drains.
W. W. C. tells us, “his scheme is but a question of expense.”. We
should think it was...Why' bless the man, it would only drain all
England.
---
STRIKING ERRORS AT THE MINT.
We wonder who reads the proofs at the Mintº for it seems that
the last publication at that office (whose works we invariably take in-
as soon as we can get then) was not properly corrected before it was
issued to the public. And the coins are to be recalled, and to be sent
through the press a second time. -
A second edition of a coin, “with additions and corrections,” cannot
be done exactly for a penny; and we camot see how the additional
outlay is to be provided for.
We strongly advise the proprietors to engage a careful Rºader for
their establishment, and to see for the future that every new work they
bring out—no matter whetherit is a humble half-ſarthing for the benefit
of #. Irish landlords, or a valuable half-sovereign for distressed Pro-
tectionists—is properly revised before it is put into the hands of the
Public. Nowhere do accidents cost so much as at the Mint–ſor the |
smallest mistake will chip a shilling off every sovereign, and a number
of such chips would soon make a hole in the entire currency of the
realm. To guard against such accidents, therefore, perhaps, it will be
safer for them to adopt the old mercantile caution, and, to have
engraved round the edge of every new coin, "Errors Excepted.” . .
By-the-by, when are we to have an English coin? The Florin is a
pretty mongrel affair. A German name, with a Latin inscription, and
an English definition of its value. However, it does not look so bad,
when you have a number of them together, and besides, we should take
|
it most kindly that the silver is not German as well as the namel

PROPOSAL FOR A NEW LOAN, BY MR. DUNUP.
THE extreme facility with which loans are obtained by even the
worst of characters for the worst of purposes, has encouraged MR. DUN-
UP to draw up some E. for a loan to himself, by which it is
expected a very large class of most deserving persons—his own creditors
—will eventually benefit. He has seen with some surprise, that it is
only necessary to ask and to have, in the case of certain powers with
whom Mr. Dunur would not condescend to compare himself, and he
ventures to hope that if money is so readily forthcoming in a bad cause
there may be no difficulty in raising the necessary supplies for a good
purpose.
#. following heads of a proposal for the GREAT DUNUP LoAN have
been already put into circulation among the leading capitalists, who it
is hoped º º: sufficient cash to spare from their Austrian, Russian,
and other operations, to enable them to contribute to the excellent
object MR. DUNUP calculates on accomplishing.
The Loan to consist of £10,000, to be secured on MR. DUNUP's
word, which is considered to be quite as good as his bond, and has the
advantage of requiring no stamp to give it validity.
Those who purpose “taking the Loan,” which means giving the
money, may do so in any sums however small, and though the first
applicants will, have the “preference,” arrangements will be made to
“let in "all who are desirous of contributing.
The interest of the Loan will be calculated from time to time and
added as a bonus to the whole sum, which will be looked upon as “a
rest,” and, in order to prevent this “rest” from being disturbed, it
will remain permanently in the hands of the lendee as long as any of it
remains, when the whole of the money expended being found to balance
with the sum received, the “rest * jº be distributed without any
deduction whatever—except the logical deduction that it is all gone—
among the contributors.
Any person wishing to transfer his share of the Ioan may do so on
finding a transferee, but a sum of 5 per cent will be first payable as
Interest will accrue from the day when the Loan is paid up, but the
interest will not be payable until the whole of the principal is repaid;
as it is very fair that the principal which forms the first debt should
º: yº erence, inasmuch as being a prior claim it ought to be first
Satisfied.
Any person having contributed to the Loan, and wishing to with-
draw his contribution, may do so—if he can, but not otherwise.
Though the Loan is nominally raised for distribution, among the
DUNUP creditors, it is still desirable that that respectable body should
enjoy the same privileges, as the contributors to the Loan, and the
amount of the creditors’ claims will therefore be converted into con-
solidated stock, which will be added to the original amount of the
Loan, and bear interest at the same rate, payable in the same º as
if it had been interest arising from contributions to the Loan itself, to
which it will in all respects be equivalent.
All applications respecting the Loan may be addressed to MR. DUNUP,
but he would suggest the expediency of a small remittance to cover
preliminary, contingent, and other possible expenses.
——
“The Butcher Ward.”
THERE has been a grand dinner of the Butchers' Institution. We
wonuer if toasts were given to some of the greatest Butchers of the
age—to HAYNAU, and RADETsKI. We observe that part of this
institution is called “THE BUTchER WARD.” Can this F. be
in honour of the Governor of the Ionian Islands, who has lately given
such strong proofs of his merits in that capacity at Cephalonia?
THE CHOLERA AND ITS QUARTERS.
“A LATE Visitor at Nice" writing in the Times denies that cholera
has extended its ravages to that town. The fact is, that the cholera
always keeps clear of any place at all deserving the epithet of Nice.

THE CAREER OF A RAILWAY PARCEL.
On the recent investigation, at the Clerkenwell Police Court, of a
charge of stealing twenty-two Railway parcels, it became necessary to
trace the course of one of them, sent by MR. Hassell, of Bristol, to
MEssRs. LEPARD & Co., in London, and for this purpose to produce no
fewer than eleven witnesses. This evidence is “carefully summed up.”
in the following lines:–
Él
This is the Parcelin }. brown,
That was dispatch'd from Bristol town.
a This is the Clerk of lawyer Hassell,
fº
f That “did up” and address'd the “passell.”
* This is the Boy who scamper'd hard,
* To carry it to White Lion Yard.
| This is the Gent, who from him took it,
All L. And very properly did book it.
This is the Conductor of the 'bus,
That carried it to the terminus.
This is the Railway Porter who
Received the parceland way-bill too.
This is the Clerk who, in the nick
Of time, the railway bill did “tick.”
This is the Great Western Guard
That brought up the parcel for Ms. Lºrand.
This is the Clerk who, from the guards,
At Paddington takes the parcels “inwards.”
This is the Clerk of CHAPLIN AND HoRNE,
That counted the parcels at early morn.
This is Davy, their man, who rides in a van,
To deliver the parcels as quick as he can;
But walk’d º on his back,
(Their weight, he says, did make it crack),
Unto the office in Bedford Row,
Of GREGoRY, FALKNER, and SKIRRöw.
This is MRs. Coom BEs, who sweeps the floors,
And opens and shuts their office doors:
She eased the porter of his load,
And in the hall’twas snugly stow'd.
This is the Thief, as a lion bold,
That to her a wicked story told:
He lifted the bundle from the floor,
- And the Lawyer's parcel was seen no more.
OUR “INSULTED" POCKETS.
WHERE is RICHARD LALon. SHEIL? What place of refuge conceals
the traitor? Is there to be no impeachment—no trial—no transporta-
tion—for, in these milksop times, we can hardly hope for the hurdle,
decapitation, and quartering. The traitor SHEIL has filched from his
“royal mistress her two fairest titles,” roars John Bull. Yes; the
“Papistical Master of the Mint,” says John, “under the inspiration of
his }. confessor, we presume,” has—see the florin-robbed the
QUEEN of that—
“Which secures to her the allegiance of her subjects on the highest and firmest of
all grounds, that of her reigning ‘By the Grace of Gon' . A public acknowledgment
of the error it would, perhaps, be too much to expect; it is in the nature of the Whigs
to feel no hesitation to do wrong, but great difficulty in repenting. Stealthily they
have outraged the nation's faith, and stealthy is to be the reparation. Beit so. We
care not how it is brought about, provided it be done, and our pockets be not insulted by
a coin, which on the face of it denies what Englishmen hold dearest."
But the outrage must be publicly aloned for. The Master of the
Mint, clothed in a sheet of unprinted Bank, note, paper, with a dark
lanthorn in his hand, and his pockets turned inside out, must be ex-
hibited for a morning at least at the Stock Exchange, or any other
public place sacred to Mammon. Our loyalty, our feelings, our prin-
ci le, our household gods, all are as nothing compared to our pocket.
The “insult” offered to that innermost heart of man must be avenged.
But the “florin” is doomed. Lawyers refuse it, upon, principle, as
any part of the 6s, and 8d. Jew clothesmen liſt up their hands against
it. Pawnbrokers hurlit back into the box from whence.’tis offered.
The crossing-sweeper º: the Standard office drops it down the
drain when let fall into his hat by some benighted passenger.
º the English pocket has feelings. The pocket will “not be
insulted.”

ANOTHER POSTAL QUESTION.
A correspond ENT of the Herald asks—
“Has it occurred to you that this new arrangement at the Post-office may be an
attempt to pave the way to let Ma. Baeon Rothschild and other rich Jews have their
letters delivered on our Sunday, as they ought not to open or read their letterson their

It has been suggested in the Daily News that Post-office clerks should
be carried on board the foreign steamers, to sort and stamp the letters
on the voyage. This would be all very well in smooth weather, but in
a storm, the clerk must of necessity be alternately on his heels and on
his head, while endeavouring to preserve the equilibrium, necessary for
his duties. The sorter would frequently be put terribly out of sorts

WE have had a Sixteen-string JACK. It is not the fault of the precious young
Emperor, FRANCIs Joseph, that the Austrians have not a Sixteen-string
Emperor. He has a great taste for hanging; but was baulked in his delight,
by Count BATTHYANI, whose self-inflicted wounds rendered such mode of death
impossible. Whereupon, he was shot; and HAYNAU licked his tiger lips.
Hungarian women, of the highest classes, we are told, endeavoured—but were
not permitted—to steep their handkerchiefs in the blood of the murdered man.
But the blood did not sink. It helps to dye the Emperor. And, as it is with a
certain insect, that “the finest, red” dyes the “deepest black,” so with
Emperors, the purer the blood that is shed, the blacker the stain that is left.
BRANDED BY HONOURS.

MR. WARD by thus “honouring” him. It was only in the HAYNAU, sense

They lift it to her face.
And then—yes, I should banish
Such fancies overwrought,
But they refuse to vanish,
Those spectres of my thought.
'Tis true, if aught could smother
Pity, it were her crime;
But I shall be a mother
Too, in a little time.
To think if I were lying,
Foretasting every pang,
Counting each moment flying,
And, after all, to hang!
To feel each cordial proffered
My sinking frame to prop—
Was succour only offered
To save me for the drop!
Better at once to end me,
Than, like that hapless wretch,
To soothe, sustain, and tend me,
And nurse me for JAck KETCH !
The law, with strange compassion,
Her unborn babe reveres,
Whose mind despair will fashion,
And agonising fears:
Preserved by mercies tender,
An idiot but to be ;
Nay, what these thoughts may render
My own, disquiets me.
MoTHER and QUEEN, forget not
Pardon is in thine han ;
For woman's pity, let not
This hanging shame our land;
But cause the mob ferocious
The spectacle to miss,
uman and atrocious,
Of butcher-work like this!
HOUSEHOLD ORNAMENTS.
A, SUNDAY newspaper, whose seeds of literature are com:
monly hempseed, advertises a republication of the portraits of
the MANNINGs in the week of their trial. With the taste that
is stimulated for such fine art, we think a few lockets, with
small, delicate Daguerreotype portraits of notorious malefactors
would find a ready welcome in the bosoms of families. Mur-
derers are now made such common visitors in the Sunday circle,
that they may fairly challenge a more enduring place in the
breasts of their patrons. -
We also, think, that small *::::::::: or terra-cotta
casts of distinguished criminals for mantel-pieces would be
F. and instructive ornaments for the hearth. We have

If not, it is not our contemporaries' fault.

WANTED A GOVERNESS.
WE had hoped that our occasional observations on this painful theme
had shamed some and persuaded, others into a more liberal course of
treatment; but the following advertisement shows that the class of
Governess tormentors is not yet extinct:-
AILY GOVERNESS.—WANTED, in the neighbourhood of Brixton,
a Young LADY, to take the care and education of three children, trom the
hours of 9 till 4. She must be able to teach music and accustomed to tuition. Salary
£12 per annum. Apply by letter, post-paid, to R.H., &c. -
Three children for seven hours a-day, at £12 per annum, will give
something between a halfpenny and a penny per hour, for the tuition
of each infant. The neighbourhood from which this advertisement
proceeds, is quite appropriate. The governess who commits herself on
those terms to Brixton, is committed for hard labour, indeed; and we
should imagine that none but a regular “Maid of the Mill,” who had
been accustomed to the tasks imposed at the House of Correction,
would venture upon answering the advertisement.
ALARMING
HEIGHT OF PUFFERY.
HABERDAstrºy and slapdashery
are going hand-in-hand, arm-in-
arm, and neck-or-nothing, with
the most alarming rapidity. The
puffing linendrapers are becom-
ing so openly audacious, that
they make no secret of their
opinion that a boldfront is every
thing, and each man attempts
to put on a bolder (shop) front
than his neighbour. If a man
in these days wants to open a
linendraper's, he and his family
must sleep in the cock-loft, for
the shop occupies the whole four
stories of the house, from the
basement floor to the garret ceil-
ing. In St. Paul's Church Yard
there are a few specimens of the
new school of linendraperyarchi-
tecture, and where we presume
the goods are chiefly intended
to attract the observation of
persons perambulating the outer
galleries of the cathedral, for in
º, º is it possible
to catch a glimpse of the articles displayed in the Windºw; --
It is all *::: to write up half a mile high, “Look here!,4s. 9d,
but how is any one to look, or, at all events to see, without atelescope?
It is no longer possible for the fair occupants of carriages to catch even
a glance at the display of haberdashery as they ride past, and it will be
absolutely necessary to invent some new kind of vehicle, with a sort of
Pisa-like tower, into which it will be possible to ascend in order to

inspect the dresses, shawls, and other contents of the Metropolitan
Magazins des Nouveautés.
Our attention, by the way, has been called to the last new linen-
drapery trick—a trick worthy of the well-known addition in thin
pencil marks of 1134, to the bold black figure of 1 shilling, when the
intention is to charge a customer double the price apparently appended
to an article. The last new trick of the trade is to attach to a number,
supposed to be º an initial, of such a dubious form, that it may
do duty either for an Sor an F, and the shopman canthus change the
sum into either shillings or florins, according to the probable greenness
or gullibility of his customer.
PUNCH'S OWN RAILWAY.
EveRx now and then there app amidst the Railway. Intelligence
of the day, an account of a meeting of proprietors of the West London
Railway. The usual clamour is raised against the directors of the
North Western and Great Western for refusing to recognise the little
affair, and stop their trains at is modest station. The attempts of the
proprietors to keep up a constant communication between Wormwood
Scrubs and Warwick Square savours of an enthusiasm that would be
better employed in a better cause. “Develope our traffic” is the con-
stant cry of the shareholders, who seem to sigh for a return of the days
when an empty omnibus ran backwards and forwards to the terminus,
and a newsman shouted “Times, Chronicle, Daily News,” through the
hollow and ºf shed of the deserted platform. Well do we
remember the fitful attempt at a cab-stand which was got up on the
opening of the line, when, first the waterman dropped off, then the
hºrse was detached from the cab to graze at leisure on the grass
growing up between the stones before the office door, and at last the
cab itself was drawn off as a hopeless affair, amid the jeers of the
bystanders and the tears of the station clerk.
No one can wish for a repetition of these melancholy manoeuvres,
which must be the result of the re-opening of the line, if it has no
better resources for traffic than those it formerly starredu But
while the trains of the Great Western and North Western fly past the
West London Station, with proud contempt for the desperate signals
of its one F." and the frantic contortions of the superintendent
of traffic, hoisting his hands, hat, and handkerchief, in an agony of
excitement, to hail the engine driver of the larger companies, the
º to open the line is one which we cannot conscientiously
second.
A Nice Look-Out.
MR. Dickenstells us, in David Copperfield, that MR. McAwºn
was always on the look-out for something "to turn up.” He lived in
that hope. It was the only prospect he had before him.
Now, if MR. McAwark had lived over a London churchyard (St.
Saviour's for instance) he would have seen in, one day, merely by
looking out of his window, rather too many subjects" turning up.”
though how far he would have enjoyed the prospect before him, we
cannot say.

when the Ring was put on PALL's Finger (Dick first having fumbled

KING COAL AND HIS NEW PALACE.
mº
HE most precious jewel in the crown of
England is from the treasury of KING CoAL
—dug from his mines in Newcastle. There-
fore, it was a significant and seemly inten-
tion of QUEEN VICTORIA, in her own person,
to do graceful fealty to the tremendous Po-
tentate—blacker than SHEBA and stronger
than SoLOMON.—on the house-warming of
his Exchange Palace, in Thames Street.
For the QUEEN OF ENGLAND, with all her
might and glory, is only the feoffee of
another power. Without KING CoAL, what
a dwarfed thing were, English royalty—
without KING CoAL, what a pauper place
were England. Whilst with him, the Bri-
tish diadem shines, a ...? ring to the
nations;–and his broad black pennant, from a thousand funnels, floats
in every sea.
QUEEN ELIZABETH, in her state-barge, on solemn days and holidays,
was truly a fine sight. RALEIGH wept courtier's tears to look at her.
But QUEEN ELIZABETH, in her golden boat, is but as discrowned Queen
Mab in a cockle-shell when thought of with the idea of QUEEN VICTORIA
afloat upon the Thames, and bound for Custom-House wharf. QUEEN
ELIZABETH was pulled by mere brawny emen–QUEEN VICTORIA
would have been borne onward by the greatest king of the world—KING
CoAL. He is on board the Elfin steamer, and though himself unseen,
has let fly his black pennant. With a hauser of twisted gold-thread,
KING CoAL takes in tow the royal barge, and—and—
But as this sheet must be in print long before the water pageant takes
place, we cannot report the solemnity of the time from the evidence of
our own eyes. . We must ask of KING CoAL to favour us with a private
view—as the fossil Toy HILL saw a private eclipse of the sun the day
before the F. exhibition—and to this end, with that domestic
wand, a steel poker—a wand worth all the wands of fairy for the
happiness it casts about a circle-we shall compel his Majesty of Coal
to show to us, in a series of dissolving views, his history from the
earliest down to the time of his latest triumph—to Tuesday last, at his
Palace Warming in Thames Street.
With the hearth-wand, to housewifes known as a poker, we have
begun our coal-compelling spell. There!—right in the yielding heart of
the fire. And small white jets of flame blow and blow—and the fire
talks—talks audibly.
—Another ten minutes, and the spell works—the show begins.
KING CoAL, now so mighty in England and ". the seas, shows us, as
in a burning mirror, his earliest history; the beginning of his vegetable
life, ere mineralised into the black wealth he now vouchsafes to man.
Yes, in KING CoAL's own fire, we see, in dissolving views of *::::::
topaz, and ruby, here and there emerald-tinted, the story of KING CoAL’s
growing majesty.
The fire burns hollow. A red sky rests above a burning earth
where many colours live, and creep, and change into one another. And
now, grow up ferns and trees—thick and tall, KING CoAL in his
vegetable days, when not a beast or bird stirred his leaves, or rested
on his boughs—when all was silent save the solemn heavings of the
early sea. And there in the fire grows the Forest of KING CoAL, and
strange flowers of all tints run up his trunk and hang upon his
branches. And now the forest falls; KING CoAL is thrown upon his
back and buried—deeper and deeper buried. And there he lies—hidden
out of sight; crushed and crushed, and changing and changing.
Another wave of the poker | A few thousand years have passed
and negro KING CoAL is awakened from his transforming sleep to do all
sorts of service. We see him at work in the embers. There he is,
smelting iron, hammering, melting it. There is a village—a town—a
city; and KING CoAL is warming every hearth, for we can see him
respiring from a thousand chimneys.
The fire falls. . And there, a burning ocean; and in it a burning
ship—a naked ship—with a fiery pennant. That is KING CoAL gone
to sea in his new steam-ship.
Another dissolving view. A thick-built town: with tall chimneys
shot into the molten sky. That is Cottonville, and there KING CoAL,
with his new working companion, Steam, is tearing cotton—teazing-
spinning—weaving it.
Again,_a glowing sea. And thousands of ships with dusky sails,
. black swans, swimming onwards. All the ships of rich KING
OAL.
Another change, and now the Thames. The wharves rise on either
side, and flowing through them is the burning river; and there is the
Elfin, KING CoAL’s special steamer, towing along a golden barge
barges following, the whole fire alive. and dotted with craft, an
pierced with masts, and—the embers fall, and no doubt QUEEN VIC-
toRIA’s Husband and Children, have landed at the Custom-House,
and are on their way to the Palace of KING CoAL to pay him homage.
Father Thames himself-(by the way, we noticed him in the embers a
minute since)—has, with much pains and difficulty, washed himself
clean for the occasion; whilst every collier below bridge dons a new
suit of white satin sails, worked by the maidens of Sunderland and
Newcastle, with legends in honour of KING CoAL.
We pass the ceremony at the Hall; for that will be duly registered
by our fellow chroniclers. Neither shall we dilate upon the magnificent
throne of polished coal, cunningly contrived for the state of HER
MAJESTY; we shall also leave to others to describe the coronet, with
specimens of the Coal Flora for strawberry-leaves, and polished “nut-
coal” for pearls, of the attending MARQUEss OF LONDONDERRY. Of this
we feel, assured; that KING CoAL will be mighty in his kitchen,
doing his best at boiled and roast for the Princes, who honour him;
Indeed, KING CoAL will, in London City, be triumphant at a thousand
ranges. -
We read that MR. LANG has enriched the Exchange with scenes, in
encaustic illustration of Coal History. We have not seen them—but
we feel certain that we can divine them. - -
The “Richmond Shilling” is no doubt a prominent subject. The
shilling upon every chaldron granted by thelº. care of CHARLES
The Second to his bend-sinister son, the DUKE OF RICHMOND; the
shilling since commuted at the cost of £490,833—for a perpetual annuity
of £19,000 to the house of RICHMOND, in whose coronet coals may be said
to burn at a great price. This, were a sweet, waggish touch of the
Merry Traitor to make his royal virtues fire-side gossip. MR. LANG
has, of course, taken this theme, encircling, it with the RICHMOND
motto—“En le charbon de terre je fleurie.” -
The “Limitation of the Wend” is, of course, another subject treated
by the artist. For by this legalised conspiracy at the pit’s-mouth, the
necessary of coal comes heightened to the poor, as a luxury. e
London weaver has, however, the satisfaction to know that if he pays
30s, per ton for coal,—his cosmopolite brother at St. Petersburg, ma
warm himself with Wall's end at ſittle more than half the price. Wit
this fact before him, MR. LANG has no doubt shown us a Russian family
very jolly over roaring sea-coal, and a family in Spitalfields with starved
fingers and blue winter noses. -

veniences—MR. LANg has no doubt painted the ceremony of commencing
the bridge, substituting for the ſoundation stone, foundation coal.
Be this as it may, KING CoAL's new Palace is opened. Compared
with the power and purpose of which it is the representative and free
type, what a Prison-Palace is the Palace of St. Petersburg! What
a wigwam, hung with bleeding scalps, the Palace of Vienna!

Wilful Waste of Water.
At the present moment, when the metropolis is absolutely panting
for pure water, it is positively shocking to hear that the fountains in
Trafalgar Square consume no less than 1000 gallons per minute. From
the effect produced, we should have ºf the consumption at about
half-a-pint every half-hour, and our kettle actually boils ºver with in
dignation at the idea that the paltry spouts at Charing Cross are sup-
plied at such a dreadful sacrifice of an element that is so much wanted
in London. There must be some fearful neglect of hydraulic science in
the arrangements of these shabby jets, for we would undertake, with a
pail of water and a hose of six-squirt power, to make a far more effective
pair of fountains than those which now sprinkle their miserable tears
or spit their impertinence out, upon the head and face of the disgusted
bystander. We almost wish some patriotic turncock would and
cut the water off on his own responsibility, and Punch would be the
first to move a resolution to the effect that he had "deserved well of
his country.” The best thing that England can possibly do with the
miserable eau d’artifice, whose playing is the merest child's play, at
Charing Cross, is to goat once to the Basins in Trafalgar Square, and
wash her hands of the thing altogether.
It’s Astonishing how Distance Grows.
ALBERT Hous E is found to be such a distance now by hundreds of
fashionables, who once made it their daily haunt, that Lords and
Ladies have been known to set out from Belgrave Square as early as
3 o'clock in search of it, and to return at 7 without having been able
to reach the end of their iº
The distance, in fact, is found to be so great from the West End, that
when a lady is about to pay a visit to Albert House, she makes pre-
parations as if she were º: on along expedition, and her sense of the
distance is best conveyed by her always directing the coachman to
“DRIVE To Hupson BAY.” It is needless to state that the carriage
never gets any nearer than the corner of Piccadilly.
Indeed the fashionable traffic has so completely ceased in that
quarter, that a sporting Marquis has offered the sum of £500 to any
carriage that explores the passage of the Hyde Park through the
Albert Gate.
An Unnatural Son.
MR. LEwis, a son of the old Actor LEE, IEwis, has left a legacy of
£10,000 to the Trustees of the National Gallery, on condition of their
hanging the portrait of his father. One is tempted to quote. Hoºge
on the subject: “Delicta majorum immeritus lais.” Anglice, “Oh,
LEwis, your ancestor didn’t deserve it.” - - -
We have heard of prodigal sons who consigned their family pictures
to the garret, but it is new to find a pious child paying £10,000 to have
his father's portrait consigned to the coal-hole.

THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE CIRCULAR.
WE copy the following extraordinary announcement from the Morn-
ing Chronicle of Oct. 23. It was found under aheap of dusty intelligence
from Leipsic, and, as we thought it too precious a jewel to be lost, we
have taken the trouble of re-setting it to adorn the casket of our pages:
“Civet cats were in great demand; Wolf very dull; as also Virginian foxes, of which
only one parcel of 2000 were sold. Bears were in great demand, and were bought up
:#. by the Poles. Badgers were neglected. White Fox without sale. Blue Fox
d
cient. Grey Fox abundant, but high. Country Foxes were bought up rapidly at
any prices. A great deficiency of Cats, both black and blue. Weasels were of very
inferior quality.”
We could make neither head nor tail of the above mysterious mixture
of all sorts of animals taken from the well-known miscellaneous
collection of the Happy Family. First of all, we were deeply pained to
hear that the “Badgers were neglected,” for we have always looked
upon the Badger as a favourite, animal that was greatly run aſter.
ext, we were rather rejoiced to be told that there was a “deficiency
of cats, both black and blue.” This is lucky for the Leipsic larders,
though cooks must feel the scarcity dreadiully. By-the-by, we never
}. of a “blue cat.” This must be the voracious cat that is sure to
devour a leg of mutton when the policeman calls.
We were a little surprised at the announcement that the “Bears
were bought up eagerly by the Poles.” . We should have thought that
the Poles had had : of the great Russian Bear to last them all
their lives. It may be, that some of our stock-brokers went over to
“bear the market,” though again the highness of the article may be
accounted for by the simple fact, that all Bears have a tendency to rise
when brought in sight of a Pole. -
But the whole article mystified us. Could it be MR.TYLER, we
asked, who has gone over to Leipsic to make fresh purchases for his
Zoological Gardens Who is it that can want such a number of
animals? They cannot be for our House of Commons, for that Bear
Garden is quite large enough. They may probably be for our sporting
squires, for we notice, amongst the choice items disposed of, that
“country foxes were bought up rapidly.” Our º gentlemen have
been long complaining of the growing scarcity and dearness of foxes,
and this new investment, we said, has undoubtedly been made to
remedy the deficiency. England will be overrun with Reynards of all
colours, and our intrepid sportsmen will race with one another to be
“in at the death,” in order to present their wives with the brush of a
“blue fox.” We must confess we do not envy much the NIMRop who
had to carry home the nice little “parcel,” above mentioned, of “2000
Wirginian Foxes.” - -
Our fears, however, have run away with us, and it appears that they
have not the slightest ground for doing so, Riish homesteads are not
to be desolated once more with ravenous wolves, and English ducks and
hens will be allowed to “sit” in peace and quietness, without any im-
pertinent fox (who from his, breeding should know better,) “dropping
in " upon them. If any of the animals above specified are imported, it
will not be in a live state, but their hides will be so well tanned, that
any lady will be able to wear a “blue cat” round her neck, and any
gentleman have the pleasure of pressing a badger to his bosom, with the
greatest impunity. The alarming sacrifice of bears, civet ca's, badgers,
and weasels, turns out to be only a quiet sale of furs! We have been
nearly frightened out of our skins, -but nothing more. The Trade
Circular has deceived us this once, but we will take good care that it
does not “catch a weasel asleep” a second time.
Protectionist Pumps.
Mr. Everys, the Protectionist Member for West Surrey, at the late
Aºtus Dinner at Guildford is reported to have told his audience
at-
“In times of difficulty they should all set their hands to the work, and if the ship
were leaking that was a reason why all hands should go to the pumps.”
All hands should go to the pumps! What does that mean? That
the agricultural interest should have recourse to the Protectionists?
| ANOTHER TALE OF A TUB.
|
A.YOUNG gentleman (of Trinity College, Dublin), whose motions of
| Ancient. History are infinitely too Rollin', for they apparently have
gathered nothing, will insist upon it that our old friend DioGENEs was
no more a cynic than LYNN, or QUIN, or PyM, but that his great object
in carrying about a tub every where was only to sell oysters.
. He maintains that the fact of DioGENEs being an ovsterman suffi.
ciently accounts for his being the first man on record who “astonished
the natives.”

But which the very masons when they saw,

From sight of bas-reliefs found a relief in “bah.”

That veils the future from the scoff of scorners.)

Thus—in a baked apple and 'tater stall!

An Island that understands Self-Government.
THE Daily News says, “Malta at this moment has no Governor, or
Chief Secretary, or Commander-in-Chief of the troops present—they
are all away on leave, and yet the machine works on as well as usual.”
In fact, we should say much better than usual, considering the Governor
is no less a personage than MR. MoRE O'FERRALL. By-the-by, since
that honourable gentleman receives his salary all, the same, he must be
id by Government to keep away from the Island. Viewed in that
ight, he is well worth his salary.
We advise the Colonial Secretary to take a lesson from Malta, for it
is rumoured that his temper is so uncertain that he would be all the
better at times for a little Self-Government.

HOW TO INCREASE RAILWAY TRAFFIC.
ALL sorts of speculations—some of them very bad speculations-
have been afloat as to the cause of the diminution of Railway Traffic
throughout, the country, but the most ingenious mode of increasing
it is one that our own little Railway has hit upon., At, the recent
meeting of this promising little concern, it was stated that the directors
had sent three parcels down their own line by way of experiment, or
more probably pour encourager les attres, though the result was not
very encouraging, for it was stated at the same meeting that only one
of the parcels reached its destination. This mode of increasing traffic
may be applied to the passenger as well as the parcel, department, for
any railway may send its clerks and porters to it. tickets and run up
and down the line, by way of giving life to the concern when it seems
to be languishing.
The idea is not altogether a novel one, for it, is only a modification
of the principle of the unknown author who used to order a copy of his
own work, and pay for it in order to promote a sale at the §.
The result was, that he, in time, |...} paid for and got upon his own
shelves the entire impression of the work with which he had hoped to
make a favourable impression on the public. There is something truly
TootsIAN in the notion adopted by the directors of our little line in
despatching parcels directed to themselves by their own line, at their
own expense, for their own satisfaction.
The Kilkenny Cats in Paris.
It seems that there are two parties in the French Chambers. The
debates are always interrupted by “A Voice on the Right,” and “A
Voice, on the Left,” and considering how seldom the debates are
argued on the former, it is no wonder that the divisions should always
prove for Freedom to be over the latter. . But this division of parties
#. somewhat account for the pugnaciousness of its members; for
udging them by their disputes, their boxes on the ear, their challenges,
º duels, never were representatives so fond of hitting “right
and leit.
THE TIES AND NECK TIES OF HOME.
THE literature of the cravat must now be added to our products of
the march of intellect, for a book has just been published on the subject
of the neck-handkerchief, and the work is illustrated by a vast number
of engravings, showing the different modes of arranging that important
article of male attire. When we consider how necessary it is to know
how to hold one's head up in society, and when we reflect how much
the tie of the cravat may tend to the formation of other ties of more
tender character—for the arrow of love has often reached the female
heart from the bow round the neck of a gay cavalier—when, we repeat,
we remember these things, we cannot be surprised that the adjustment
of a noose, by which a dearer noose is frequently effected, should have
become the subject of a literary i.
We wonder }. BURRE, the heraldic author, who is so great on the
topic of old family Stocks, does not take the new stocks of the existing
generation under his cognizance. As far as stiff-necked pride is con-
cerned, we do not see that it can have anything more appropriate than
a well-starched stock to rest upon, and we hope therefore...MR. BURRE

The Great Tailor for Bucks.
THE Edinburgh Review says that “Cabbage is found to be richer in
muscular matter than any other crop.” On the strength of this, the
Morning Chronicle recommends MR. DISRAELI to raise the cry of
“Cheap Cabbage.” Till his Utopian schemes for relieving the agricul-
tural distress were perfected, the cabbage would certainly be something
to stop the farmers' mouths, and prevent their crying... It would have,
also, this further advantage; in all measures where there is cab
there is generally something else. Now, MR. DISRAELI might identify
himself so thoroughly with this new measure, that he could find the
riculturists not only in their Cabbage, but in a magnificent Goose
also. We have no doubt either, if the great M. P. for Bucks, were
i. pressed, that he would not mind cooking it for them into the
argaln.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 179
: A BONE FOR BONNYCASTLE.
GREAT, arithmetical puzzle —which would
defy the astuteness of the calculating boy
himself—is now pervading the streets of
London, and the western suburbs. This
modern Sphinx, to which we have for some
time been vainly endeavouring to play the
F. of CEDIPUs, is the fare of a Kensington
mnibus. It purports to be threepence
from Sloane Street to Charing Cross, and
sixpence from Charing Cross to Sloane Street
—a result which has no parallel except in
the extraordinary case of the wonderful
Rhinoceros that, according to the Show-
man's description, measured 44 inches from
the snout to the tail, and 88 inches from the tail to the snout.
We defy BosNycASTLE himself, or the old original Tutor's Assistant,
with the aid of his own Key, to discover, with anything like certainty
the fare by a Kensington Omnibus. We have tried it every way, an
endeavoured to work it out in every possible manner, but when we have
seen 3d. distinctly painted on the window of the Omnibus, we have some-
how or other found that the money we pay cannot be got to agree with
the sum indicated on the vehicle. As the Arithmeticians say, ‘Give
6d. To Find, the Change out of it.” Let any one try it, and he
find it almost impossible. -
We sometimes fancy there must be a system of pantomime scrolls
applied to the windows of the Kensington Omnibuses, for though you
see 3d. as º: as life on all parts of the vehicle, get in where you may,
and get out where you may, you will find, by the close inspection of some
almost invisible type, that yours is not a case for change out of sixpence.
Sometimes even this coin will not suffice, and, by a most unintelligible
effect of the atmosphere on the fare, a wet night will raise it to a
shilling, and you will have the door slammed in your face without
another word, if you decline being taken in on the terms of the
conductor.
We are no advocates, for unreasonably low fares, and we have no
desire to enjoy the ºf: of ‘. drawn for twopence by cattle so
debilitated as to be scarcely able to draw anything more than their last
breath, but we must say we like a little uniformity, and we should be
glad to know what the fare really is on the Kensington Road, for the
H. is at present as variable as the Share List, and seems to be regu-
ated by the arbitrary, will of the conductor for the time, being. As a
glut of buyers in the market sends shares up, a number of riders
will in five minutes double the fares on the road to Kensington. ..
We highly appreciate the value of permanency in all our institutions,
and we shall not be satisfied till we see the principle applied to the fares
of the Omnibuses we have been speaking of. It is true that the Com-
pany, having a monopoly of the road, may do what they like with the
road, which is exclusively their own, but a little wholesome º
may yet be found to bring the Company and their fares to a level. A
fitful attempt was recently made with a retired Chelsea bus, and a
pair or so of brutes so exquisitely attenuated, that—
“Nothing lived 'twixt them and dog's meat.”
But though this “unreal mockery” of an opposition dismally failed,
and the Chelsea cavalry retired before the ridicule of the enemy—the
i. horses looking as if they were fed upon nothing but chaff from
the drivers and conductors of the rival Omnibuses—it is not improbable
that a more earnest, and consequently a successful, attempt will be made
to break up a monopoly that threatens to place the weary feet of the
western traveller in the hands of a little band of determined 'bus-men,
H. º 3d. painted on the panels, and 6d. or 1s. engraved on

NOBILITY OF THE MIND AND POCKET.
... We have great pleasure in giving publication to the following
interesting instance of
CONSCIENCE MONEY.
“The DUKE OF nts his compliments to the Directors of the York, New-
castle, and Berwick Railway, and begs to return them the sum of £5000, which he con-
siders is the lawful property of their Company, as it was the amount of profit upon
certain shares that were presented to the Duke by MB. HUDson.”
We have no doubt that this liberal * will be largely followed
by other members of our proud English Nobility, who were not too
proud at the time to participate in MR. HuDson's gains, but who, we
are sure, will be far too proud to keep those gains now that they
know by what dishonest means they were obtained. We hope in a few
days to be able to publish a long list of the most aristocratic conscience
monies. We shall not be surprised to find one or two Duchesses'
names amongst them.
BLUE BOTTLES IN THE WATICAN.

A BARGEE'S BALLAD.
IT was off Bankside sooer,
Our gallant barge she lay-
A noble craft as you don’t see
Her ekal every day.
And as ve lay at the Bankside,
A hawful groan I eared,
And under our stem an old gent I’spied,
With pea-green 'air and beard.
Like an elderly mud-lark he did rise
His body from the sludge;
Says I, “You’re a come here, prigging coals,”
Wich he did answer, “Fudge.”
“I’m FATHER THAMEs,” he says, says he;
Out of my bed I’ve rose,
To seek for a drop of decent stuff,
To wash my face and clothes.
“For I’ve heard tell of our noble QUEEN,
To the City how she sails,
With the royal ALBERT, her Consort,
And also the PRINCE or WHALEs.
“It’s long since poor old Thames as 'ad -
The honour a Queen to carry,
Thof often I carried É. QUEEN BEss,
KING JAMEs, and bloody MARY.
“And as for Whales, ’tain't many o’ them
That I sees come my way;
Except that one at Erith stairs,
As they cort t'other day.
“But in them old and ancient times,
I was fit for to be seen;
My bed it were both smooth and sweet,
My waters bright and clean.
“My 'air it warn’t as now you see”—
And he squeeged it with his 'and,
And all sorts of nasty slimy things
Dropped out of every strand.
Says he, “There never was river ran,
hat, at my time o' day,
*As been treated as bad as they treat me,
Nor sarved in such a way.
“They pisons me with sooerage,
#: rubbidge, shoes, ºts, -
With chimicals, coal tar, and gas,
And with dead dogs and cats.
“And though a water Power I be,
You'll think it werry funny,
I can’t raise a drop of the real stuff,
Either for love or money.
“Now, as Ivants to do my best,
And be fit for to be seen,
(As any river in England would,
If axed to bear the QVEEN),
“I wish you’d speak to the water works,
Orvatever's the proper quarter,
And ax if they can't spare FATHER THAMEs
A drop of clean soft water.”
THE STANDARD OF SHERRY-WHAT IS IT?
THERE meets our eye, at many a turn, a placard headed with the
unintelligible F. HE STANDARD OF NATURAL SHERRY. We
cannot comprehend the existence of any wine in a state of Nature, and
we cannot imagine the sort of Standard which Natural Sherry has
adopted. Can it be the flag that has braved a thousand years the bottle
and the breeze f or, is it the Standard at Cornhill, in the neighbourhood
of which a good deal of Sherry—rather more artificial than natural-is
to be met with ? Does the song of the Standard Bearer refer to the
Standard of Natural. Sherry, and what is the meaning of the “Nutty
Flavour,” spoken of in the advertisement we are alluding to ? Perhaps
the whole mystery lies in a nutshell, but even if it does, we are at a loss
what to make of it. Are we expected to believe that Natural Sherry is
a production of nature, and not of art?—a sort of wine in the wood, just
as the oak and sapling are to be met with in the forest? We pause
for a reply—but whoever attempts a reply must be good enough to pay
the postage.

YOUR MONEY, OR.—“COMPEN.
SATION.”
It seems that no less than 8000 writs
were issued last year by the Palace Court.
These were properly 8000 cases of ex-
ersecution, purposely taken
into the Palace Court to swell the costs,
The Court, we are told, is to be abolished
at the end of this year, but compensation
is to be given to every one who had an
interest in it. Compensation for what?
For the maintenance of a vile sinecure,
for a public wrong, for a wholesale rob-
bery. If any one should be compensated,
it ought to be the 8000 persons against
whom the writs above mentioned were
taken out. They are the real sufferers—
but there is no talk of compensation for
them. The persons who shared the
lunder are to receive a further plunder
in the shape of compensation money, but
those who were plundered are not even
to have the money of which they were
shamelessly plundered returned to them.
Surely, there is something faulty, some-
thing almost wicked, in this system of
compensation. "We pay people because
they have been thriving all their lives
upon abuses. The greater the abuse,
generally, the greater the compensation.
We would not give these Palace Court
gentlemen a farthing. If the Palace Court
be paid, we shall not be astonished to see
MR. HUDsoN come forward and demand
compensation
THE
FUN AT FARMERS’ DINNERS.
MR. PUNCH will really be obliged to
invite himself personally to an agricul-
tural dinner; a kind of banquet whereat
the good cheer, (notwithstanding agri;
cultural starvation) and the equally good
fun, seem, united, to form a treat which
Mr. P. cannot longer deny himself. He
would have given away several numbers
of his popular periodical, gratis, to have
been present, the other day, at the Guild.
ford banquet, could he have foreseen the
sport which befel there. The newspaper
reports of the festivity are, however,
more than droll enough, and from these
records Mr. Punch, in convulsions of
mirth, with difficulty transcribes the
following extracts:—
“At the conclusion of a substantial repast, the
usual loyal toasts were given, and drunk in rapid
succession.”
(So it would seem).
“The Chairman then observed, that the present
was an agricultural and not a political meeting,
and that any gentleman who trespassed on the
forbidden ground of politics would be at once
called to order.”
This announcement, it is stated, was
received with “cheers.” . The reporter,
doubtless, meant “laughter,” and if
he had not attended more to his dinin
than his reporting, would have ...i
us that the worthy chairman uttered the
above words with a marked ironical em-
phasis, and followed them up by making
a face and º sight at the company,
who responded by cries of “Over the
left,” and appropriate gestures. For he,
immediately afterwards, having given
“The Army and Navy,” coupled with
the name of LoRD EGMONT:—
“His Lordship, in acknowledging the toast,
said he regretted to observe that there was rising
up in this country a base Republican faction, which was endeavouring to
squeeze a too squeezeable Government into accordance with their views,
and to destroy that glorious free Protestant constitutional monarchy of
which this country had so long justly boasted.”
&c. 1 &c, 1 &c. 111 &c. 1 &c. 1 . . . .
In this style (after the usual loyal toasts, &c.) proceeded
the noble Lord to the end of his oration, without any other
interruption than “cheers.”
For the enjoyment of all the humours of a political debating
club, (to follow a substantial repast and the usual loyal toasts),
commend Mr. Punch to an agricultural dinner where politics
are tabooed, and where anybody who refers to them will be
at once called to order.
THE DUSTMAN.
I KNEw the dustman years ago;
I see his open visage now:
His fan-tail'd hat, his footsteps slow,
His velveteens, his honest brow.
A chord is touch'd which but requires
A breath to blow away the rust
Which time deposits on the wires
That vibrate to the cry of “Dust.”
I view within his mournful eye
Reflection's melancholy trace ;
Thousands may pass him coldly by,
Volumes are written in his face.
It bears an impress ſull of thought,
| A lesson that we all may trust;
n The proudest may by one be taught
| Who knows so much of common dust.

oLD BAILEY LADIES.
, to Miss CHARLOTTE
From MISS LOUISA
“MY DEAREST CHARLOTTE,- - -
“I HAVE just come home from the Old Bailey Dock in that
horrid Newgate, and you can’t think what a flutter I’m in. , Dear me !
If it isn’t more exciting than the Opera; and then, you know, love
... * it more delightful, it’s all true. Butlet me tell you all
about, 1U.
“Our CHARLEs knowing dear MR. — (he is one of the - of the
City of London) got tickets for myself and ARABELLA to hear the
whole of the trials of those horrid, dreadful creatures, the MANNINGs.
Coming late (for you know what a girl ARABELLA is; never ready when
everybody else is) there was no room for us upon the Bench, where I
saw those girls the PIERREPOINTs (who always push themselves every-
where); and so we were obliged to take a seat, with the dreadful blood-
thirsty creatures in the dock. I didn't much like it at first; but after
half-an-hour or so, got quite reconciled to the situation, as it enabled
us to see all the movements of each of the criminals’ countenance—the
monsters. - -----
“There were many ladies in Court; as our. Post says, “notabilities.’
I think I saw MADAME Tussauld : but then her visit was, of course,
purely one of business. - -
“When the creatures came into the dock, I was all in a twitter, and
upon my word and honour, do you know, I felt for a moment as if
murder was catching. The villain MANNING was dressed in plain
black; and looked such a wretch, the Sunday F. not making him
half monster enough... (By the way, I’ll send you his likeness in a
locket, with, if possible, a bit of his hair, and then you can judge for
ourself.) MRs. MANNING was very nicely dressed, indeed. When I
ooked at her, I thought the jury must find such a black satin gown
not guilty—but they didn't. Besides the black satin, she had a plaid
shawl of the Stuart pattern. Wore avery beautiful º that I have no
doubt will be fashionable, with such beautiful lace lappets, and lace
ruffles that—no, I never ! It did seem to me impossible that such
hands, with such lappets, could commit a murder; but, then, such
doubts made the sweetness of the interest. -
“Well, the trial went on, and I felt myself so much at home with the
horrid prisoners that, once or twice, I caught myself about to offer my
eau-de-cologne to the wretched culprit at the bar—but I didn't. As
the witnesses were examined, if it wasn’t much better than a º
I’m not here, that’s all. MR. SERJEANT WILKINs was a little har
upon our sex;, but then you know, he was paid for it—and that
explain everything. - -
Well, my dear, to beshort, the judge summed up, and the jury retired,
and the interest was delightful. They came in at last, and the judge
began to pronounce sentence, when . MANNING—well! didn't she
show her spirit !—called every body a pack of wretches, and threw all
the sweet and bitter herbs before her, upon the wigs of the lawyers.
It was *:::::: a great deal finer than GRISI’s Norma, and much more
real than MRs. WARNER's Lady Macbeth. However, the judge went
on, and sentenced the horrible criminal to be hanged; and MRs.
MANNING flounced out of the dock, telling 'em to go and be
ashamed of themselves. -
“Having broken the ice, if they are executed I think I shall go and
see the sight. For if ladies make the Old Bailey fashionable, I don’t see
why they shouldn't patronise the new drop. It is so exciting: and as
I said before, so real.
“Goodbye, for I’m going to dress for dinner—but I wouldn't miss
the post. Should there ever be another trial, you must come up to
London, and go to Newgate, with (my dear girl)

MONOMANIACS OF THE EXCHEQUER.
THE daily acknowledgments of the receipt of conscience-money made
by, the CHANGELLOR of THE ExchEQUER in the Times must have
induced a suspicion in the reflecting mind that, somehow, there must be
a vast number of lunatics at large. The announcement, last week, that
he had received £50 “pro bono publico’’ is a clear proof of the insanity
of somebody, evidently unfit to be trusted with his own cash. It is the
opinion of Mr. Punch that both the penitents and benefactors of the
hequer, the P.G.'s, F.W.’s, X. Y.'s, and A. S.S.'s, are simply one
eccentric old gentleman, with more money than brains, and slightly dis-
ordered in respect of the latter.
... As the mania. of this cracked unknown develops itself, he will, very
likely, be sending the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer his watch,
rings, and snuff-box, and overwhelming the Treasury with baskets of
game, or swamping it with hampers of wine. Nothing is more painful
to think upon than misdirected benevolence, and there is an office (85,
Fleet Street) to which the stream of bounty we have been just contem-
lating might just as well be diverted from that of the Exchequer.

A NATION COMMITTED TO NEWGATE.
THERE are no less than 40,000 persons imprisoned for political
offences in the Kingdom of Naples. If it goes on at this #:
NAND will not have a single free subject left. Every man in the kingdom
be a prisoner; , every house will be a jail. There will soon be
nothing but dogs and babies seen in the streets. His Ministers must
have new titles. They will be receiving fresh appointments as follows:–
Chief Secretary for Hard Labour.
First Lord of the Hulks.
Chancellor of the Duchy of the Penal
Settlements.
Hereditary Lord High Constable and
Chief Beadle. -
Hereditary Usher of the Birch Rod.
Lord High Keeper of the Stocks.
Paymaster-General of Policemen in plain
clothes.
First Lord of the Stone Jug.
Lord Privy Turnkey.
Lord High Policeman.
Chancellor of the Condemned Cell.
Commander-in-Chief of the Sheriff's
Officers.
Home Secretary for Newgate.
Foreign Secretary for Botany Bay.
Master of the Handcuffs.
Lord President of the Treadmill.
KING FERDINAND may boast of ruling over the largest prison in
Europe. His kingdom should be walled in like an immense Newgate.
Should the odd fancy ever seize him to wash his royal hands, we are
afraid, that not all the Naples Soap in his kingdom will get them clean
agalm .
A New PRoverb.-Reading in the late reports of Railway Investi-
gation Committees of the cost of what they call “rolling, stock,” we
should propose “stocks” for “stones” in an old proverb, and write
“Rolling stocks gather no moss.”

- BIRD, from the top of
a date-tree, have been rendered into the most scrupulous English by
a gentleman attached to the Foreign Missionary Society, and who
sed, the very prime of his life among the Makūana race of Cape
elgado, on the Coast of Mozambique.
The meeting was proclaimed by beat of wooden drum, to be held an
hour after sunrise, in the centre of the village. The purpose of the
meeting to take into consideration the benighted, condition of certain
individuals, known as the Committee of the British and, Foreign
Society. At the first gleam of light the people left their cabins, and
were assembled in the square. Shortly after, the Makūana Chief,
black as night, attended by the oldest men of the tribe, appeared—
silence was cried—the chief took his seat upon a bamboo seat, over-
spread with a tiger's skin, and an old man stepped forward, carrying a
small packet carefully enfolded in palm-leaves. Ceremoniously untying
the leaves, he very reverently drew forth – a London newspaper.
Whereupon the savage multitude bowed their heads in sign of venera-
tion of #. token of truth and human refinement. Three or four women,
with the passionate impulsiveness of the sex, dropt upon their knees,
and taking their gold ornaments from their necks, laid them upon the
earth, as an offering to the picture of the Lion and the Unicorn,
printed—tattooed, as they doubtless believed—upon the brow of the
aforesaid newspaper. . - -
The old man—his grizzled hair was, white as sea-foam, and his
appearance, for a savage, benign and intellectual—addressed the multi-
tude. He had, it was known, in the strong days of his youth, when
he could have griped, the life from a young lion, and raced down
the ostrich in its earliest speed, he had been sold to the English,
who “wear clothes, ride upon elephants, climb into houses, and are
gods.” The wonderful English 1. They had taught him their tongue:
they had taught him that, when he was put into the earth, he should
still travel beyond the sky, and, like the sun, be bright and glorious for
ever, They had given him a Book that had put wings to his back—a
Book that had softened his heart into honey—a Book that bad him cast
away his war-club, and hug even the Sowauli as brothers. (Here the
savages shouted, and clapped their hands). But the mighty English had
fallen into the dust. They had made, even of the Book itself, a thing
to hurt and to destroy. This was the truth: for it was written in the
paper, the Morning Tongue, that though silent, talked to the English
: He would, however, make the paper speak, so that all should
ear Illin.
Here the old man, with great facility, translated into his own bar-
barian language the pure English of the morning º reading
therefrom a report of the proceedings of the Britis and Foreign
Society. According to such doings, the young women who folded and
stitched the Bibles and Testaments for the º Scripture
Slaves as the old man called them—could not, one with the other, earn
more than 5s. 6d. a week. ; And here, it was curious to observe with
what intelligence the speaker described to his hearers the º -
separable from such wages. It was of no more worth, he told them,
in England, than a hundred cowries in Mozambique; it would only bu
a few dates, a calabash of milk. And then, he said, the poor Englis
things must pay for houses to live in, and for clothes to wear. They—
poor dears!—they had not the same sky and the same freedom as the
tribes of Makūana.
A young man then addressed the meeting. If all that they had
heard was a true thing, he would no longerlook into the Book that had
been given to him by the English—he would no longer listen to the
English sent among them. How could the Silent Tongue of the Book
talk truth? And could they believe men who said they love all men as
brothers, when they starved their wretched sisters? For what became
of them? Did they lie down and die?—He, for one, would never look
into that Book again. After what he had heard, it was sewed with
heart-strings—tattooed in blood—and covered with human skins.
A second elder rose. He told the last speaker that he was no better
than a quagga. The Silent Tongue was no less true, because men were
untrue to it. Because the English sealed their ears with wax, and
whilst they could earn cowries or get much cattle – plenty more
elephant tooth and palm wine—would let the Tongue talk beauty, and
heed it not, -making white slaves, and spotting white souls—and all
to save the black man—to send white into the pit, and black into the
sky., All this was like snake that with .." colour—pretty to look
at—had poison in tooth. Still, because snake have poison, no reason
that there be no pretty colour.
At least a dozen other speakers descanted upon the doings of the
Society, that starves the bodies, and endangers the souls of wretched
#. and women upon miserable pittance. “The Committee of the
ritish and Foreign Bible Society”—it is thus our translator renders
the words of a Mozambique savage, “offer manna to black man, and
ashes to white girl.”
After further discussion, the chief—with his hand commanding silence
—rose. He spoke gravely and fluently. His words were to this
meaning.—“The English people had, no doubt, done much good among
the black races. They had taught the Mozambiques many things that
were wise and good. They had sent them books that gave them souls
in the sky. But this was in former times. The English of to-day, it
was plain as his hand, were no longer the same as the English before
them. They had forgotten the preaching of the Silent Tongue, and
thought of nothing but stores of ivory and gold, dust. Though still
white men without, they were black men all inside. Now, he would
put this to the Makūana race. (Here was a sudden hush, and the mul-
titude gathered closer about the chief). These were his words: let
them sink into their hearts like water into sand. In days gone past,
the English had taught them good. Now, as the English had forgotten
what they had taught, let some from among themselves depart from
Africa—let them send Mozambique missionaries to enlighten the British
and Foreign Society,+and, taking a copy of the Book, make them learn
its true beauty and spirit. And when they had learned them, they would
. longer send the news of salvation abroad, at the cost of goodness at
ome.”
This º. was loudly applauded; and—in due season—a depu-
tation of Mozambique blacks may be expected on their charitable mission
in London. ..It is to be hoped that the º Committee of the
British and Foreign Society, who sell cheap Bibles at the likely cost of
female purity, will give patient ear to the teachings of the philanthropic
Savages. A LITTLE BIRD.
MAKING THINGS PLEASANT.
ADDING some thousands under head “Revenue ; ”
Imagining traffic, that no body ever knew;
Changing losses to profits, to creditor debtor;
Making fair returns monstrous, and bad returns better;
Clapping some four per-cent. on to a dividend;
Squaring bad bookstill they right as a trivet end;
Rigging the market your shares to dispose of; , .
When a shareholder grumbles straight ºns his nose off;
With others' cash buying to sell to yourself;
Making shares out of nothing, and pouching the pelf;
Humbugging share-buyers, share-sellers, share-holders;
Thinking no lie too heavy to take on your shoulders;
Blowing of bubbles, sans thought of their bursting;
Flinging sops to directors, for pickings a-thirsting;
Building up rotten hopes, on a sandy foundation;
Making gamblers and tricksters of half of a nation;
Of widow and orphan inveigling the pittance;
So to Commons and Lords winning easy admittance;
Oh! this is the fashion which, though not at present,
KING Hudson has practised of “making things pleasant.”
The Lay of the Last Feargus.
FEARGus O'Connor laid down his life again last week. This is
really a fact. The awful sacrifice took place at Brighton, at the
Financial Reform Meeting. FEARGUs never enters a public meeting
now, but what he lays down his life with his hat and gloves on the table,
F. to addressing the people. His whole political career lately
as been paved with lives he has laid down in all the cities he has
travelled i. In the market-place at Nottingham a small stone is
shown to the curious, that is almost worn out by the number of times
that FEARGUs has laid down his life upon it.

Louis-NAPOLEON'S LAST THROW.
Iouis-Napoleon has for sometime been riding the high horse, but
he has at last come to a throw, which, although it may be considered as
a throw for a very t stake, is of a decidedly desperate character.
With such a skittish steed as Louis Napoleon had tº guide, it was of
course very difficult to hold the reins, and he may perhaps be right to a
certain extent in refusing to “give her her head.”
to use the curb may lead to a great deal of inconvenient restiveness, it
may nevertheless be said to France:-
“You helped to set your master on your back,
He likes his seat, and makes you show your paces.”
. Whether these paces will not eventually leave the rider in the lurch,
is a question that time will not take very long in answering.
A NEW LOAN FOR NICHOLAS.
Should Russia or Austria require another loan for the purposes of
despotism, we hope that either of them may be induced to apply to
one of our London Loan Societies. We cannot wish the Czar or any
other foreign oppressor any more effectual punishment than to get
regularly into the clutches of one of these concerns, and we are quite
sure that if Nicholas and a London Loan Society were once to come
into contact, the awful catastrophe that is to expected, “when
Greek meets Greek,” would be fully realised. We are convinced that
even the most arbitrary of despots might take a lesson in cruelty and
persecution from the practice of a Loan Society, and we can only
repeat our hope that when Nicholas wants º: Loan for a bad
purpose, he may put himself in hands similar to those which tore to
: unfortunate Jones, whose case has lately excited so much
attention.
Father Thames and his Royal Visitors.
Poor Old FATHER THAMEs must have felt rather ashamed of himself
on the 30th of October, when he examined his own bosom and found it
quite impossible to make a clean breast of it; for in his present dirty
state he is really quite unfit to receive the distinguished company that
lately honoured him with a visit. We wonder that the City authorities
after going to such vast expense to do honour to their guests, were not
induced to add a trifle more to filter the water of the river, or, to speak
allegorically, to put upon old FATHER THAMºsaceanfront to conceal his
dirty bosom. There had been some talk of including the river, among
the toasts at the déjeuner, but it was soon decided that to drink the
Thames was utterly impossible.

LEND ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS.
“LEND me £500” ought to be the heading of at least twenty adver-
tisements that appear every morning in the Times newspaper. Perhaps,
however, Give me £500 would be a still more appropriate “catch line”
to those ºf cool applications to the full-pocketed and empty-headed
portion of the community. The following piece of coolness is really
quite cucumbrian in its character.
ANTED £500, AMPLY SECURED. Salary 4:3 per week. Duties re-
quiring attendance from 6 in the evening until 10. A gentlemanly occupation;
and for seven years. The lender will have the entire control, and
repaying himself. Apply to V.
the means of
This announcement presents several points where the imagination
may dwell for a few minutes and take a discursive revel in the realms of
fancy: “Wanted £500” is all matter of fact enough, but when we come
to “Salary £3 per week,” there is food for the idealist. What is the
salary to *: for, and to whom is it to be payable? We get a little
insight into the matter from the ensuing sentences, notwithstanding
their curt, incoherent, and disjointed character. “Duties requiring
attendance from 6 in the evening until 10," is an intimation that opens
to us a vague idea of a check-taker's place at a theatre, or a toast-
master's situation at public dinners; or the office of bonnet and cloak
protector at an early concert room. The next sentence, however, is
puzzling, for it alludes to “agentlemanly occupation; and for seven
years;” the period having a perplexing affinity to the customary term
of transportation, and being suggestive really of nothing else: for it is
impossible to hit upon any occupation either gentlemanly ºr otherwise
which can be called septennial. The grand climax to the advertisement
is at the conclusion, which announces in simple language the broad
fact that, “the lender will have the means of repaying himself,” a most
consolatory reflection truly, for the lender, and equivalent to a confession
on the º of the advertiser, that the lender will have to look to
himself for getting the money back again. -
It may be presumed that he who has the means of lending, will have
the means of paying, and thus the hypothesis in the advertisement m
be supported; but we recommend any person having £500 to part wi
on the faith of an advertisement, to consider well whether he really has
“the means of repaying himself,” without looking to any other source
or therestoration of his money. To any party in this position, with a
superfluous É500 in his pocket, such advertisements as the one we have
been noticing may offer several really very “eligible opportunities.”

Fashions or DESPOTISM.
A TURIN paper announces that the Duke of PARMA has given the
galley slaves a new costume, and a hat exactly resembling that adopted
by the Liberal party. We dare say the new costume for the galley
slaves consists of something in the way of a stripe for their jackets;
and as to the hat, we presume from its resemblance to the chapeau of
* that it is intended to bestow a topper for luck on both
partles.
A New Word wanted.
At the last Nenagh Assizes, one John O'BRIEN was sentenced to
fifteen years transportation for attacking aminer, named Curry. He
has since, beyond a shadow of doubt, been found innocent of the
crime: whereupon, the Lord Lieutenant, as the representative of
Justice, took solemn counsel with himself and graciously granted a
“free on” to the guiltless wretch. . Now, if innocence be “par.
doned,” what—when mercy interferes for crime—what other word
shall serve for forgiven wickedness? Is Justice so very stupid, as well
as blind,-that she cannot learn the simplest “meanings?”

“REMEMBER, remember, the fifth of November, Still, when shares you’d allot him, and so at the bottom
Is gunpowder treason and plot,” Of a Company got him, it blew up at last.
And to keep up the season, there still may be reason,
Though GUY FAWKEs and his treason be almost forgot. His face bluff and burly was a mask, late and early,
Wherein honesty surly, physiognomists saw :
Rags motley and tattered, a hat vilely battered, When by hook or by crook you could balance his books, you
By bone-grubber scattered, from scare-crow down blown, Found in spite of stout look, you’d a mere man of straw.
Of straw a few snatches, a lanthorn and matches, -
A mask for a face, and a chair for a throne; The lanthorn he carries is the light whose vagaries,
Like a will-o'-the-wisp far from honesty's way,
Such, in brief, the receipt is (with which every street is To purls and to pitches, in dirt and in ditches,
Enabled to greet us) for making a “Guy”— In wild-goose chase for riches led millions astray. '
And few years but may lend us a GUY as tremendous,
As he who'd have sent King and Commons sky high As the street Guys are shown too, a chair was his throne too,
Whence in absolute tone to his slaves he gave law,
This fifth of November, our Guy sits as member, And though none then were dreaming of his underground scheming,
Of that very house his original had blown up; Of a blow-up from him even Dukes stood in awe.

That for Mammon's Guy god-son, Punch here would have shown up. Rotten now is his credit, as the fabric that fed it;
Out at elbows in character, credit and cash,
His dealings in stock sure, so crafty and cock sure, Like a Guy he is fleered at, and scouted and jeered at,
If not Faur prove him For, sure—as 'cute and as fast: And all that’s he good for’s squib-firing and smash.

Monk to bring back CHARLEs STUART, how prettily he might at

good of his own dear England. Restored to the throne, it was well
when he hunted * worse than moths with LADY CASTLEMAINE-
(the Dutch Fleet in the morning of the same day blazing in the
Medway and threatening the Thames). -
Now, we do not mean to aver that HENRY THE FIFTH-with his eye
on the French throne, and acting to the French people—is not at the
resent moment everything that his admirers tell of him. “His
eatures,” says his last worshipper in print, in this month's Fasºr,
“are delicate, but still retain all the strong characteristics of the

slain its hundreds of thousands. “A clear eye of deep bleu de roi!”
What is king's blue for an eye, we know not: though of late the
blueness of the looks of certain kings has been none of the most
sprightly:-
“A peculiar earnestness of gaze; a classically modelled chin, and small, well-shaped
mouth. He has recently adopted the fashion of a tuft on the chin, and a very short
beard, which united to the whiskers, conceal the natural fulness of the countenance.
It is a face altogether remarkable for its aristocratic contour, its peculiar sweetness,
its strong intellectual expression; this is the opinion of all the fairer sex, who may be
heard exclaiming as he passes by, “Mon Dieu, qu'il est beau!'"
What a pity it would be to spoil the freedom of such a picture!
How it glows and beams in the beauty of distance! Call the shining
light to Paris; and experience tells us, it is just twenty to one, that a
crown would act like an extinguisher upon the glory.
No, no: the Bourbons flourish so beautifully in exile, it is a pity to
dwarf them by tºº. them to the soil of France. Somehow,
they cannot now strike root there.
THROWING COALS ON FIRE AT THE COAL EXCHANGE.
It was remarked that SIR RoPERT PEE, and, LoRD JoHN RussELL
were once or twice thrown side by side at the recent ceremony of
opening the Coal Exchange. The reporters state that the two distin-
uished statesmen did not speak to one another, but we have reason to
elieve that a little good-humoured banter passed between them. . The
following may (or may not) be relied upon as a small snatch of dialogue
supposed to have been uttered by the ex- and the ex-isting Premier.
ir R. Peel. “So, LoRD John, you have come to have a peep at the
coal, preliminary, I presume, to having your ash settled.”
Lord John.”’ſ amat all events surprised to meet you, SIR ROBERT,
among the coals, as I should have supposed, you might have been
satisfied with the sack which you got long ago.”
It was at this point that the tºº. was seen to advance,
and place himself between the rival statesmen, as reported in the
newspaperS.
Who Is HAYNAu?—This is a question that we have often been asked
of late. All we can say in answer is, that HAYNAU is one of the EMPEROR

A WYLD GOOSE CHASE OVER THE GLOBE.
. MR. WYLD has just published a Map of the North Pole. His
industry certainly goes to the utmost limits. We doubt if there is the
|smallest scrap of the world left him now to make a map of... He has
| scoured the whole globe, as clean as a new door-plate, and left the name
of “ºyſuº engraved in large letters upon it. He has even used up
the Arctic Regions. Go, search the North Pole, and you will find one
of WYLD's Maps dangling at the end of it. The force of mapping can
surely no further go.
| ALEXANDER wept because he had not another world to conquer. We
can imagine WYLD often sheds bitter tears that there is not another
globe to lay down at his feet in seven-shilling “rollers | *
| There only remain the Moon, the Sun, the Stars, and the centre of
the Earth at all open to a Map. The Artesian wells that are about to
º up all over London may help MR. WYLD to get an insight into
the latter, and, for a man who makes it his business to see further than
anybody else, an insight would be all that was sufficient. There is no
difficulty, but what, MR.WYLD, when he has a mind to compass anything,
can instantly get through it him have but one peep, and we should
have the next week a “Grand Map of that delightful spot, the Centre
of the Earth, published for the use of Emigrants.” But then MR.WYLD
| would never stop half way. He would be sure to push his discoveries
further, and Science would soon be favoured with a “carte du pays” of
the interior of the earth, by which means we should be able to travel
somewhat like a monkey, by jumping from Pole to Pole. We are
positive such a short cut is to be made, and there can be no question
that WYLD is the “scientific cutter” (as they say at NUGEE’s) to do it.
We shall go through the world instead of round it. You will get into a
snug little descending room, like, the one at the Coliseum, , and
be quietly “dropt”.. at New South Wales, in less than an hour
after you have left the Duke of York's Column, in the St. James's
|Park. It will be done on the principle of buckets in a well,—as one
party goes down another will come up. The only difficulty will be to
|distribute the respective weights, for it stands to reason, six lean tra-
vellers dropping down from London, would never be able to E. up six
stout, Dutch-built voyageurs, coming direct from Sydney. But this is
a mere feather in the scale of difficulties, which any one, at all gifted
with, a pair of scientific, lungs would blow away at once with the
smallest “Pooh! pooh!” We are confident this new method of
travelling will be the ruin, of railways at no very distant day, and we
are equally confident that MR. WYLD will publish Maps of the country
as soon as it is discovered, if not before. Talk of an Irishman, being
in two places at once, why, our parliamentary friend of the Strand must
be nearly all over the world at once.
| We went into his shop some time back to ask to look at a Map of the
Court of Chancery; for, ºf by some stupid accident got into it, we
were extremely anxious to find our way out of it as soon as possible:
|“Certainly, Sir; by all means,” said the ubiquitous map-seller, not at all
disconcerted, “ be to kind as to take this 'Seat of War.’ ” and he offered
us a chair with the Map of Hungary lying crushed upon it:
“Here it is, Sir;” he exclaimed, quite pleased, “be kind enough to
cast your eye over this.” We did, and found he had brought us the
verything—it was a view of the Queen's Bench. He has maps for
every out of the way, or in the way place. e would not mind wager-
ing, if a picture were discovered this afternoon in the Vernon Galºi
that MR. WYLD had a map of the place published to-morrow morning !
If MR. Wyld's brain should be ever discovered (we will be bound he
has a Map of it inside his hat), we should like to have a peep at it, for
we have a suspicion that the twohemispheres must be printed, warnished,
and glazed, exactly like a pair of globes.

BARELY CIVIL.
Poor dear MR. URQUHART has been stripped of all his clothes by a
irate, asserted by MR. U. to be a Russian. We should recommend
W. U. to avail himself of this incident to change his motto to-"Bare

UNNATURAL COLLISION.
THE Worcester Herald gives an account of a coach accident; a colli:

happened since the Tories quarrelled with JAMES THE SECOND.
EFECTIVE SMELLING.—NEW DISCOVERY.—85, Fleet Street.
The Organic Olfactor, an extraordinary, powerful, small, newly invented instru-
ment for loss of smell, entirely original, to surpass anything of the kind that will ever
be produced. It is modelled to the nose, so that it can be worn or disused at Pleasure,
and, being of the same colour as the skin, is, in some instances, even ornamental. The
powers of this valuable new invention are so great as to bring very defective smellin
to its perfect and natural state, and even to enable Common Councilmen to distinguis
putrefactive odours, to discern the perfume of Smithfield, and to be sensible of the emana-
tions from sewers. This contrivance for re-opening a door to “Wisdom at one entrance
quite shut out,” is respectfully recommended to the notice of the civic authorities by
Mr. Punch 85, Fleet Street, within scent of St. Bride's Churchyard.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DISAGREEMENT OF THE DOCTORS.
THE field of inquiry into the cause of Cholera has been all along a
sort of dry skittle-ground, every new theory being a sort of .
which has only been set up, that it might be straightway knoc ed
down again. The latest instance has been the very recent downfall of
DR. BRITTAIN's theory, which, after appearing to stand for some time,
has just been bowled over by some clever hands at the College of Phy-
sicians. The report that has appeared within the last few days com-
letely overturns the hypothesis by which the Cholera was believed to
É. tº: at last accounted for. -
The following is the order in which the overturning of DR. BRITTAIN's
scientific skittles has been effected:- -
1st. The alleged irregular cells, which were supposed to be peculiar
to the disease, have been found to have no necessary connection with
it, and the irregular cells have been disposed of as regular sells to the
doctor who thought he had found important facts enclosed in them.
2nd. The kind of vegetable tissue upon which so much stress was
laid, as having been full of great facts, has been found to contain no
facts of any consequence at all, and the vegetable tissue has been cast
aside as a tissue of falsehood. - - -
3rd. The search for these cells and tissue in air and water led to a
negative result, and the two negatives were not productive of any
affirmative, for they amounted to nothing, and any attempt to derive
evidence from the negatives was a positive failure. -
4th. On applying powerful flºº. to the air supposed to be infected,
there was perceptible a sort of disc over the top, but on looking closely
at the glass, and inspecting it most minutely, the examiners elicited
from the disc-over it no disc-overy. - - - -
5th. After collecting together all the results of their inquiries, the
examiners caused the whole to be held for some time in solution, and
there being no result, they attempt to offer no solution of the mystery.
A REGENT STREET MELODRAMA.
TREATMENT OF A LADY WITHOUT Her HUSBAND.
THE º: have lately contained reports of a scene of startling in-
terest, that appears to be occasionally enacted in a shop in Regent Street,
The locality is not one peculiarly suited for romance or mystery; but
a fearful drama appears to be sometimes performed in some of the shops
that skirt that gay and crowded thoroughfare.
A lady recently applied for advice to a magistrate, to know how she
should act in consequence of her ºf gone into a shop in Regent Street,
attracted by some tickets in the window, and, having found nothing to
suit her within, having been literally imprisoned in the shop and prevented
from passing out, except on the condition of her becoming a purchaser.
Matters are indeed becoming serious when the ticketing shopkeepers
of the Metropolis establish a sort of reign of terror over the ſemale
mind, and have in view their timid, lady customers instead of their
goods, when they write up in ominous red letters, the words–
“ALARMING SACRIFICE.”
We are not constitutionally nervous; but we shall really never pass
the Regent Street fur-shops, without a shudder at the idea that some
unprotected female who has been lured within by deceitful promises
of “Bargains,”“ º or goods “Given away,” may perhaps
be undergoing the horrors of “unmerited persecution,” as the victim
of some O'SMITHIAN sort of shopman, who bars her egress until she
can be content to purchase a pair of half-crown cuffs for half-a-guinea.
. To those who are fond of a piece of chivalry, we recommend an occa-
sional sally into a Regent Street .*. on the chance of finding
some fair maiden to be rescued from the grasp of the dragon, of
humbug and puffery. ST.GEORGE might have a very busy time of it
in these days if he would, make it his business to go about the
West End, dragging injured innocence out of the clutches of com-
mercial roguery. e little thought that the imperative announcements
of a necessity and a determination to “have cash,” were backed up
by the recklessness of the desperado, and the brutality of the ruffian.
We shall never look again upon a shop exhibiting these external signs
of daring and adventurous trading, without fancying we hear within
the shrieks for aid of some fair captive being forced against her will
to become a customer.
TREATMent or A LADY With her HUSBAND.
Can nothing be done to save him P
WE see a book advertised under the frightful title of the “LAwYER's
CoMPANION FoR 1849.” We did not know that, even in these des-
perate times, any human being could be found so reckless as to be the
companion of a lawyer for an entire year. Who can he be?, Some
poor unfortunate victim that probably is expiating some fearful crime
by carrying a lawyer's blue bag for the term—or four terms rather—of
along, heavy, dragging, twelvemonth. Or is it a callous sheriff's officer?
For he is too frequently the Lawyer's Companion; statistics having
cruelly proved that wherever a lawyer has gone first, the sheriff’s
officer has always walked in afterwards. , Whoever, the “Lawyer's
Companion for 1849” may be, we wish him good luck, for we are
sure that long before the period of his punishment has expired, the
poor fellow will need it.
“WE HAVEN'T DINED SINCE YESTERDAY.”
THE Protectionists çomplain of their poverty, and yet they are
feasting all over the land. They eat, drink, and are not merry. Their
meetings are graced with “every delicacy of the season” (including ||
DISRAELI), and, notwithstanding, their talk is Starvation. We cannot
understand it; for one thing is perfectly clear, that in the midst of all
their starvation, they are never in want of a Dinner, or at a loss for a
Guinea to get it !
ONLY A SHADE OR TWO DIFFERENT.
It is said that Louis-NApoleon, as a coup d'état may throw himself
into the hands of the folks of the Red Republic. If this be so, it is
the progress of colour not of government; a move from the Red to
the Purple.
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER was asked if he had seen anything of the
German Fleet, when he was in Prussia? “Oh yes,” replied the naval
schoolmaster abroad, “I saw six funny-boats at Berlin, that were out
on the Spree.”

HEROISM IN WANT.
LET Punch speak a word to the rich and well-to-do for WILLIAM
oRD, late policeman, now nothing., For the history of his present
nothingness has about it a glow of real glory, that should not beits only
reward; seeing that such reward results in want and final starvation.
Qn the 14th of May, 1849, WILLIAM TRAFFORD of the S Division of
police was present at a fire in College Place, Camden Town. He saved
the lives of seven persons from a certain and agonising death. Two
persons, screaming for aid from a top storey, were desired by TRAFFORD
to fall upon him. They did, so, escaping with little injury. But
TRAFFORD the hero was terribly shaken; the shock he suffered for
some time rendered him utterly helpless; and he has only partiall
recovered his former strength. He received £20 reward and a-medal.
He is now with a wife and children without the means of support, in
consequence of his long illness and his inability to go to any active work.
he poor man's case was, incidentally made known last week at the
Mansion House. Before this sheet appears, we doubt not that many
blessed with the means of aiding heroic misfortune caused by a virtuous
act, will have undrawn their purses in favour of WILLIAM TRAFFORD.
His medal must not be his only piece of silver. Though, by the way,
who would not rather have the solitary medal of a TRAFFORD than the
| score of medals of a HAYNAu? The one Order of Virtue tried by Fire,
-than the Austrian's twenty Orders of Fire and Murder?
What Lies at the Bottom of Ireland's Misery p The Potato.

teeth against him, and the poor Serjeant has been dropt, comme une

eland's next move will be to throw out the potato altogether, since it
has already begun by flinging over a MURPHY.

ROASTED ORANGE.
IF Old Fox were living in these days he might add a chapter to his
“Book of Martyrs.” . Know all Englishmen, that in the North of
Ireland–Irish though the statement, itself may seem—Protestants
have just been roasted alive by Kentish fire., The Ulster Prºtestant
Association held a meeting at Belfast on Tuesday last week. Thereat,
the DEAN of ARDAGH made a speech, in the course of which he
alluded to the Battle of the Boyne and WiLLIAM THE THIRD. “Here,”
says the Times, “the meeting set up the Kentish fire, and continued
performing it for some minutes.” little further on we read that (in
connection with something about a Popish, bishop) “groans” were
uttered; no doubt by the sufferers in the flames: for the groans in
relation to Popery were almost incessant during the Dean's oration.
On MR. Jones, High Sheriff of Down, rising to address the Meeting,
the Kentish fire again burst forth “from all parts of the hall.”
the next speech, by the Rev. M.R. M'ILLwain E, no less than four
outbreaks of Kentish fire occurred, and—in prºof that we do not mis.
represent facts—the report informs us that “The reverend gentleman
concluded amid the Kentish fire by declaring that he did not despair of
the Protestant cause.” -
The ARCHDEAcon of DROMORE evidently shared, the fate. as he
quoted the words, of LATIMER. At the end of his address he “called
upon his brethren to be of good cheer, for that day would kindle a
flame in England which he trusted ... would never be extin-
guished.” Thereon immediately followed Kentish fire. -
The REv. MR. DREw rose “amid a tremendous demonstration of the
Kentush fire, with cries of ‘keep it up.’” - -
It is manifest that the fare at the Belfast Meeting consisted of stakes
for several. The victims, however, it must in candour be stated,
rushed voluntarily into flames of their own kindling; and those who
are fanatical enough to play with Kentish fire must expect to burn
their fingers.
A True Astrologer.
WE perceive that ZADKIEL's Almanack is advertised as “JustOut.”
ince MR. ZADRIEI, last year, predicted nothing but woe and calamity
to happen to these islands during the present; whereas prosperity-
thank Heaven, but in spite of the stars—is daily increasing: his adver-
tisement of "just Out,” at least, tells the truth about his Almanack.

A FRIENDLY WORD WITH MR. ROPER.
We believe MR. RoPER, secretary to the Needlewomen’s Society, to
be a proper sort of man. We would fain hope that he has not even a
pin's head spot of the plague of cant upon him—spots with which
sundry persons of laborious piety come out very thick indeed. No. We
would rather think him clean and sweet as a “chrysom child.” Still,
wherefore should he go out of his way to deal a buffet? Why, when he
returns thanks, in very untutored English, for the charity bestowed
upon MRs. FITzGERALD and her daughters, should he plant a thwack
upon the cheek of Rowland HILLP
“The voice of a Christian public [says MR. RoPER) is very properly raised on behalf
of the young men at the Post Office; but how many of the opposite sex are working day
and night (Sundays not excepted)? and through the late affliction left in such a weak
state, that if assistance is not given ere the approaching day of humiliation, it will only
be a mockery upon their feelings, he must entreat all district visitors to go forward.”
The Christian public—at least the greater portion of it, whose
Christianity best showed itself in believing good intentions until evil
were proved—the Christian publicis, at the present moment, very com-
fortable with respect to the score of young men at the London Post
Office; seeing that the twenty, employed a few hours in the Metropolis, set
free hundreds, for almost the whole day, in the country. The Christian
public is now perfectly reassured in the belief that the sun will rise on
the Monday morning—the sea ebb and flow, and the earth have its
seed-time and harvest,-the whole course of nature not being struck
into confusion by the impiety of Downing Street. We know there are
superfine people, who consider the oven of the Sunday baker as only a
small type of the fiery furnace; and baked potatoes—brown and melting
—as Dead Sea applesunder another arrangement. Nevertheless, Sunda
shoulders continue to be baked, and potatoes are flowery in the mout
of a Sabbath-dining generation. For which iniquity, MR. Row LAND
HILL is no doubt answerable, he having instigated the perpetration of
the evil an age or so before his birth, though very properly sent on after-
wards to answer for the misdoing.
When MR. RoPER speaks of the “squalid poverty” of the outraged
workwoman—of her “bed of straw" -of a dying girl “in the last
stage of consumption, covered merely with a piece of calico,”—most
sadly do we go with the unvarnished and unvarnishing advocate of the
wretched. ut, somehow, we apprehend a peril for RoPER when he
drags “the young men at the Post Office” into his picture—not, of
course, designedly to give it effect—wilfully to throw it up as a
“little bit of colour,”—but then, it will look so. If it be art, it is not
fine art—for it is not hidden. We are tender of the reputation of
MR. RoPER. His function is almost a sacred one; for he has to be the
almsman to the hapless wretched. Therefore, we would have him pure
from all suspicion—cleansed in the daily waters of truth, that none—iſ
º none—of the taint and earth of mortal prejudice and modish
igotry should hang about him. Thus, in tenderness of his repu-
tation, we earnestly, advise him to take no heed of “the young men
at the Post Office,”—but to give all his heart and all his soul to the
alleviation of starving misery on beds of straw. The young men at the
Post Office, in their º need not—we would hope—the
solicitude of MR. RoPER. e do not say, that MR. RoPER has in him
one spot of cant, but then, we conjure him, by the sacredness of his
function, to give no cause for doubt. When the Plague is raging, it
is not sufficient for comfortable neighbourhood, to be free from the
pest,--we must be also unsuspected. Övergood intentions do some-
times sanction strangest means. MR. RoPER may remember that a
rigid Sabbatarian placed a ladder across the road in the way of the first
Sunday letter omnibuses. This, no doubt, was his notion of Christian
zeal., Nevertheless, we cannot commend him for his religion so
developed. We are rather apt to believe that such a religionist would
—if he could—lay flat even the ladder of Jacob, if communicating from
earth upon a Sunday.
The Same Thing.
UNDER the title of the Dramatic and Harmonic Union, a new society
is advertised, among the objects of which, are “Facilities for dramatic
and musical authors in the production and publication of new works.”
Conceive a society of forty playwrights, each with a deskful of plays,
and fifty composers, each with a portfolio full of operas; and all asking
at once for the “Facilities” aforesaid! It is an odd coincidence, that
such an advertisement should come immediately after M. JULLIEN's
announcement of “The Row Polka.”
IF THE BLACK CAP FITS, WEAR IT.
HAYNAU has been called “The Jack Ketch of Hungary.” By-the-
bye, whenever a King, or an Emperor, or any fine despot has a pet
executioner, it would not be amiss to address him by significant title
of “His Royal HAYNAUs.”

MILK FOR THE MILLION.
A suggestion has recently been made for the supply of the Metro-
polis with pure country milk, in lieu of that wishy-washy triumph of
art over nature, which flows morning and afternoon into our jugs and
mugs, from a thousand milk-cans.
... The announcement has shaken, as if with a panic, all the metropo-
litan pans; and those purveyors who have dealt in new milk from the
ump and chalk-pit, without ever having been possessed of a cow, have
een cowed all of a sudden by the very thought of the introduction of
the genuine article into London. So unaccustomed are we to any-
thing else but the well known chalk mixture, that the probability is
the pure article will—like the genuine squeak of the pig in the fable, be
pronounced far inferior to the imitation with which use or abuse has
rendered us familiar.
London, in fact, knows nothing of real milk, which differs as
thoroughly as chalk is unlike cheese, from the spurious stuff we are at
present contented with: Commercial milk is a compound which any
conscientious cow would indignantly repudiate. The Londoner, as we
have already hinted, knows literally nothing of milk; for of the stuff he
has been taught to accept as milk, he knows it would be idleto attempt
to skim the surface. We understand that the Chalk Market has
already begun to show symptoms of weakness at the bare rumour of
real milk being introduced into the Metropolis.

A LEARNED JUDGE ON MUSIC AND DANCING.
A Few days ago, MR. SERJEANT ADAMs, whose heart—we are sure
of it—is a huge lump of the best fresh butter, made a very sensible
speech on the music and dancing of the people. If SIR PETER LAURIE
be in delicate health—and we hope, on the contrary, he is as sound as
his congenial Grampians—it W. have much endangered him. had he
heard #. learned Serjeant debate upon the present system of licensing
that restricted the number of places where good music and º:
were made cheap for the masses. "Let there be more music an
dancing,” said the astute Serjeant; “for the more decent houses were
licensed, the better they would be watched, the better they would be
under the care of the public.” Bad characters would not dance in
darkness, in holes, and corners, like illicit, mice. No.: they would
dance in the broad gas-light, with the wakeful eye of the law upon
them. There is excellent sense in this... We cry, with SERJEANT
ADAMs—“Let there be more music and dancing.” We rejoice to
have a musical—a saltatory judge. -
Indeed, if ever we have the º we shall call upon SER.
JEANT ADAMs for a song: and fondly hope, ere Christmas goes out, to
meet him in Sir Roger de Coverley.

NOVEMBER FOGS SEEN THROUGH AT LAST.
THE discoveries of Science present an astound-
ing spectacle at all times; but Science
has just presented to the world an as-
tounding pair of spectacles in the form of
a new invention, called Fog-Glasses, the
wearer of which, it is said, is enabled to
enetrate the darkness of the thickest
ondon November atmosphere.
We should like to test the alleged power
of these glasses, by putting them on, and
plunging our head into a tureen of cold
pea-soup, when, if we could read an inscrip-
tion pasted on to the bottom of the inside
of the tureen, we should be very happy to
furnish the inventor with a testimonial to
sº the efficacy of his Fog Glasses. He can-
not have chosen a better period of the
year for bringing forward his discovery;
and, if the experiment succeeds, we shall be glad to give it a good
word by expressing an opinion in the usual “evening paper” phrase-
ology, that “The Fog-Glass ought to be on the bridge of every
gentleman's nose, on the -
eye of every omnibus
horse, and on the figure-
head of all the Thames
tars, among whom it is
a very poor look-out in
fo y weather.”
ſe have not heard
whether the newly-invent-
ed Fog-Glass is º:

the natural atmosphere;
but if such is the case,
we should strongly advise
the exportation of a few
specimens of the article

Omnibus men are not

THE OLD BARRISTER'S REMONSTRANCE.
OH, weary fall the papers that won’t leave us at our ease;
And weary fall the Government that's cutting down our fees;
And weary fall the Treasury Clerk that round last circuit went,
To tax our costs unto the tune of fifty pounds per cent.
'Tis well to talk of Law’s delay, how when a case is o'er
At Nisi Prius, litigants must stand one trial more.
'Tis our wise wish to show Law’s dear to assailants and attacked,
And we believe “one trial” ain’t “enough to prove the fact.”.
Ere you grumble at an ** in Banc, you ought to know
Ours is the Bank in the duet whereon the time doth grow.
A Bank but of deposit is the Bank of Westminstere,
And that’s why Issue out of it is none for many a year.
You’re angry that a Counsel's not in the Common Pleas
When he’s in the Exchequer at that moment earning fees;
Which surely is unreas’nable, till a rule of Court declare
That a Counsel like a bird shall be at once both here and there.
You say that misdirection is of verdicts an upsetter
That it makes Wii Prius Law look like a mere dead letter:
When a letter’s misdirected it comes back to you as fit,
When a jury's misdirected, you but go back to it.
You say, we barristers adopt an angry wrangling tone;
Remember, pray, when who fall out true men come by their own.
You say we are too many; think of SoLoMon and his doom,
When he says that “in the multitude of councillors is wisdom.”
It isn’t true the County Courts bring law to all men's doors,
For if to yours they bring it, they take it, mind, from ours;
To bring Law home “to business and bosoms” you will find,
Is to take in a lodger that’s anything but kind.
You say we plead all causes, for good or bad we fight;
But tre find all our clien's declare they’re in the right.
That a pleading, like a pudding, has two sides the Counsel see,
But which is right, which wrong side, we don’t find folks agree.
You say that Law’s not necess’ry, you say that Law is dear;
But your declaration’s double, as must at once appear:
What’s not necess’ry is luxury, and it needs no science deep
To prove things can’t be luxuries, and at the same time cheap.
CURIOUS FACT IN TETTER, WBITING.
It is a curious fact, that, fond as women are of corresponding, they
rarely write to the newspapers; thus, we are sure to have a letterevery
day, in some paper or other, from the “Father of a Family,” but we
never recollect seeing in the Times or any other newspaper, a com-
munication from “The MoTHER or a FAMILY.”
This says a great deal for the sense of the sex, and proves that
women do not fritter away their time so absurdly as mendo, and we
hope MRs. ELLIs in her next edition of “The Mothers of England” will
make eloquent, mention of this flattering fact. But perhaps, after all,
this curious absence of all female correspondence in our newspapers
is to be accounted for by the simple reason that a Lady has always so
many private letters to write, that she has no time to scribble public
ones; or, more probably, because ladies' letters are invariably so long,
that no newspaper of the present small size could possibly room for
one! Why, the Postscripts alone would fill a Supplement :
ORDNANCE CONCHOLOGY: OR, THE ECONOMY OF J
SHELLS.
“WHEN WULCAN forged the bolts of Jove.” thunder was cheap.
What a pity our Ordnance Department has no WULCAN. The amount
that thunder costs us per peal—that is, broadside—is awful. The Times
quotes from a Blue Book the value of a single shell at lls. 3}d. . That
sum does not include the charge—either of gun-powder or carriage—
for delivery. In such a shell there is an egg that an agricultural
labourer and his family could live §§ a week. At the siege of
Gibraltar, it is said, the besieged could distinguish between the missiles
pitched upon then, ; and would cry, “Here’s a shot,” or “Here comes
a shell.” When John BULL sees a shell fired now, he will be disposed
to cry “There goes lls. 3}d!”. It must take an immense amount of
damages to the enemy in an action to answer, the expense of such pro-
i. many of which must, necessarily, missing their mark, make a
hole in nothing but a guinea.

Post-OFFICE “MOTHS.”
HE author of “Eothen,” says, “I wanted light;"
having pitched his tent in the Desert. “They
brought me a taper, and immediately from out
of the silent Desert there rushed in a flood of
life, unseen before. Monsters of moths of all
shapes and hues, that never before, perhaps, had
looked upon the shining of a flame, now madly
thronged into my tent, and dashed through the
fire of the candle :”
Is it not the same with the human moths,
“unseen before?”. Let a taper be lighted in the highway to dissipate
social darkness, and what a cloud of monster moths dash at it? . Mar:
wellous is it to think of the strange, odd, spectre moths, death's-head
moths, and moths of every monstrous make—of every fantastic pattern
—that, as though resenting the intrusion of light, blindly beat it with
their wings! e have only to look at the º, Herald to find
moths of this frantic sort—moths dashing through and through the
Sunday Post-office candle. We could not believe in the existence of
such curious creatures were they not attracted from their holes, and
corners by the suddenness of light. Who, for instance, could have
dreamt of such a Moth, as the “Constant Reader” Moth that, in
the Herald, flutters after this fashion? The Moth has “heard” that
“strangers” are to be brought into the Post-office “on the ensuing
Sabbath,” to do the Sabbath-work. Whereupon, the Moth asks of
English bankers and merchants—
“will they tamely submit to such an alternative? Can they have any guarantee that
the men who for money will break the fourth commandment will not also for money
break the eighth 2 And that letters containing property will not be abstracted by
strangers, during the Lord's day work.”
Upon this reasoning of the Monster Moth, the Postmaster-General is
hardly to be trusted with a Sunday money-letter, seeing that he gives
his countenance to Sunday sorting.
is is only one specimen of the “Monster Moths” that, for the
past three weeks, have dashed wildly through the columns of the Herald,
—brought from the strangest places by the Post-Office candle. Expe-
rience had prepared us to allow much for human folly and human
perversity in the way of indignant correspondents, but—we confess it
—the Moths that have fallen foul of the early Sunday taper of Row:
LAND HILL, beat all our former experience in ugliness and wilful
stupidity.
#. Herald himself—in a solemn leader upon the Thanksgiving Day
—steps out of his path; and—to show his piety—throws Post office
mud at the Ministry. He asks, with lacquered cheek—
“Are Ministers going to appear before God, professing to offer him thanks for his
goodness in removing the pestilence, and yet Resolving to INsult him by dragging
their poor clerks to the Post-office work on the day which He has set apart for his wor-
ship 2 If there be such a sin as Irypocersy, where can we find it more legibly written
than here *
Where? Let the writer open his waistcoat, and take a good look
“nearest his heart.” If– º as he must know, that Sunday
labour has been greatly diminished by the last, Sunday postal regula-
tions—if he does not see about the region of his left breast

written “more legibly” than in the doings of Ministers—why, then,
the vice does not show through, , Bad blood, unlike lemon-juice, cannot
be warmed into characters readable.
GUY FAWKES AND HIS FRIENDS.
(To the Editor of the “Standard.")
- IT is beginning. They are at it already. The judgment-seat
is under the control of the Vatican. The Papists have actually com-
menced a persecution of Protestants under the form of law. Only last
week, a number of worthy people were brought up at the Thames Police
Office. For what? Theft, swindling, or being drunk and disorderly
No, Sir. Merely for the expression of their feelings as Protestant
Englishmen, by ſetting off fireworks on the Fifth of November. Their
sole crime was the proper observance of the day. But this is a trifle to
what I am about to call your attention to. According to the Police
report—
“The first offender, in excuse for his conduct, said he let off fireworks in accordance
with the Act of Parliament, and on being asked what Act, he replied the Guy Fawkes
Act, which ought never to be forgotten, and he considered he was doing a very meri-
torious act.”
Such has been the supposition of many a martyr to Popish bigotry
and intolerance. . Now, Sir, what think you was the reply given to this
loyal and conscientious individual, whose conduct was dictated by
Protestant zeal and regulated by Act of Parliament? Read; but be calm
—if you can.
“Mr. YARDLEY good-humouredly observed, that the sooner the Gry FAwkEs Act was
disobeyed, and forgotten, the better, and discharged the defendant with a reprimand.”
What! is it come to this? A magistrate on the Bench actually
recommending disobedience to an Act of Parliament. And why?
shall be told, because the Act in question is mischievous and obsolete.
Obsolete, indeed! Sir In the words of the mighty, though
anonymous Bard, Gunpowder Treason “sha LLNEVER BE FORGOT.” But
I am persuaded, that was not the motive. I ask you, Sir, solemnly,
seriously, whether M.R. YARDLEY’s language can be explained on any
other supposition than that of his having received from Rome a dis-
pensation to set at nought the laws which he is bound to administer
Assuming this to be the case, should you not say that he is decidedly
ilty of High Treason 2 Now, then, what ought to be done to him
'his is a grave question. I should say—should not you?—that the
man—not to say magistrate—who could make such a speech, would be
much too lucky to escape with transportation for life.
Sir, we ought to be up and stirring. Depend upon it the extinction
of the Fifth of November squibs will be preliminary to lighting of the
fagots of Smithfield, where I only hope that ere long you will not be
accompanied at the stake by
Your respectful Contemporary,

SHAKSPEARE IN AMERICA.
We learn from a Liverpool paper that a shipment has been made to
America–
“In the shape of 500 casts of the head of ShaksprAge, taken from the monumental
bust of the poet in the church of stratford-upon-Avon, by Will. WARNER, the artist of
that town. They are consigned to an eminent firm in New York."
Punch has since discovered that the casts have been ordered by
Mr. Forrest, who, in a praiseworthy fit of penitence, has resolved to
distribute the vera effigies of the world's humanising poet amongst the
benighted men hired by the actor to pelt and put down MACREAD.Y.
We further mderstand that, as an especial mark of his remorse for
injuries committed upon the Bard by MR. For REST himself, he has
ordered that beneath every bust shall be inscribed these words-

A PAGE FROM THE MIDDLESEX SESSIONS' MINUTE
BOOK.
THE Learned Judge (MR. SERJEANT ADAMs) in addressing the Grand
Jury, said, that he wished the country should be informed, and there-
fore he mentioned it to them, not that they had anything to do with it,
for he begged them to dismiss such a notion from their minds, that
justice could be supplied at a much cheaper rate at the Middlesex
Sessions than at the Central Criminal Court. . Of course it didn't
become him to dilate on the quality of the article, but he believed it
would be found that a good, useful, prosecution could be had there for
twenty-three shillings, while the same article at the Old Bailey was
charged four guineas-and-a-half. Besides this, prosecutions could be
turned out in a much shorter time at Hick’s Hall than in the Old Court
or the New either. Still people went to the Old Bailey
understand the reason. Besides cheapness and expedition, the public
at the Middlesex Sessions would get his (SERJEANT ADAMS's) lectures
on things, in general. He would now dismiss them to their duties,
assuring them that he couldn't conceive what earthly use they were of.
Edward ToDGERs, a boy of fourteen, was found guilty of stealing
half-a-crown, the property of his father. The Learned Judge observe
t, here was a case where the parent was able to support his son, yet
he prosecuted him, and so got rid of the expense of keeping him.
Thomas ToDGERs, the parent, said the boy was always stealing. He
had given him a good flogging, but it was of no use.
The Learned Judge said, here was a case in which a boy had been
ven to crime, no doubt, by the bruſal treatment of his father. Now
what was he to do with this boy He didn’t know, and he would like
anybody to tell him.
One# the Magistrates on the Bench said, that Parliament might do
Something.
The Learned Judge didn't think that Parliament had sense enough
to do anything. They never did do anything he recommended. Had
the boy any mother ?
Thomas ToDGERs said his mother was dead. .
The Learned Judge said, that no doubt here was a boy driven to
steal because he hadn't a mother. His father ought to be ashamed of
himself. Why hadn’t the boy a mother ?
Thomas ToDGERs said, that after the death of the boy's mother, he
had married again.
The Learned Judge said, that no doubt here was a boy driven to
steal because he had a stepmother. No doubt she behaved brutally to
the boy...Step-mothers, always did. He had been reading “David
Copperfield” that morning; and he found it laid down that DAVID
CoPPERFIELD's step-father MURDstoNE treated him brutally, and
theretore he was bound to conclude that this boy's step-mother treated
him brutally. Now what was he to do with this boy?
No one being able to answer the question of the Learned Judge, the
boy was sentenced in the usual way to three month's confinement in
the Westminster House of Correction, and the next case was pro-
ceeded with.

GRAND METROPOLITAN STEEPLE CHASE FROM
PUTNEY TO ST. PAUL’S.
THIs splendid sport comes off every ten minutes
throughout the day from Putney and Brompton to
St. Paul’s Cathedral. The competitors are the
omnibus drivers and cads, who are distinguished
by the various appellations of Putney Pets, Fulham
Fowls, and Charing Cross Chickens. The Steeple
Chase consists of a single heat, or, in other words,
one continued state of perspiration into which the
horses are thrown from the moment of starting to
the moment of arrival.
We witnessed one of these little affairs a few
mornings ago from a seat in one of the competing
'busses, into which we were pitched from the step
on to which we were allowed just time to place one
foot, when the cad, familiarly known as the Sloane
Street Slasher, gave us a Å; forward, which sent
us flying on to the floor of the vehicle, and a slam
of the door, which sent the horses flying on their
accustomed career of MAZEPPA-like impetuosity.
When we had time to recover our senses and our
seat—an operation very difficult on account of the
undulation of the omnibus, which rocked like a
steamer on the chops of the channel—we perceived
that we were º in a Steeple Chase, with the
Pimlico Game Cock on the box, and the Cheyne-
walk Chicken acting as backer in his conductorial
capacity. We were side by side for some time,
when we got away cleverly by clearing an apple-stall
of the whole of its contents with our near wheel,
and we eventually won by a neck, which was no
other than the broken neck of a passenger, vainly
attempting to alight during a temporary stoppage.
We think that if these great Metropolitan Steeple
- Chases are to be continued, it would be desirable
º, that some, specific rules, should be laid down for
their guidance, and that the farce of professin
to take passengers should be altogether abolished,
as ingress or egress into or out of the vehicles can
only i. j by dodges, hops, skips, and jumps
of a most perplexing and dangerous character.
We should suggest also that the apple stalls, and
other articles, cleared in the course of the chase,
should be arranged at proper intervals, so that the
| proprietors might, at all events, know which are
º to be sacrificed, and might take necessary precau-
tions for their own personal safety, which, from
the unexpected course of the competing vehicles,

/ lºs Perhaps, also, stuffed figures—or a few of the
- worn-out murderers from MADAME Tussaud's
collection, who have lost their interest in the
late rapid succession of startling novelties, would be found quite as
effective as living objects, to be run over, knocked down, or ºherwise
dispersed by the Brompton and Putney Steeple, Chasers. We don't
know whether the affairis worth the attention of the sporting world, but
as the matter, in its present state, is sport to some that may end in death
to many, we feel that our suggestions are, at all events, entitled to be
considered.
Selling a Parent.
AMong other odd things announced for sale in the newspapers, we
see one of CANTELO's “Artificial Mothers.” As the reverse of frtificial
is natural, we thought at first that this must be one of the unnatural
arents one reads of in novels, and sees on the stage in melºdramas.
W. were familiar with the English practice of selling wives, but this
of selling mothers seemed a step beyond Smithfield. But the name of
CANTElo recalled us to Leicester Square, where, we are informed,
“chickens daily burst, the shell in the presence of visitors,” and we
jumped to the conclusion, that an artificial mother is a hot-water tray,
which, if properly regulated, produces chickens, but if over-heated,
omelettes, As we cannot suppose the chicken feels much affectiºn. for
such a parent, we are reconciled to this new traffic in “artificial
mothers,” which otherwise would have given us a bad impression of the
filial piety of the feathered race.
SORROW FOR SALE,
We saw the other day advertised in a newspaper “A Genuine
Concern to be Disposed of.” We should advise speculators to look
suspiciously at such an advertisement, for, depend upon it, the man
who has a “genuine concern” must have lost money.

EVERY ENGLISHMAN’S PEW HIS CASTLE,
THE liberty of the church-going subject has been shamefully violated
in the Parish Church of Cheltenham. The scandal cries aloud in the
newspapers. A Christian gentleman, with two or three friends, were
in a large pew—the pew only half filled. Unpewed sinners stood at the
door—there were no seats to be had. The Churchwarden suggested
to the pew Christian that he might make room for his fellow-back-
sliders. Whereupon, the miserable sinner “firmly held” the door
inside, resolving to have the luxury of º space, though fellow-
sinners were jammed and jaded. The Churchwarden—a man of action
—orders the beadle “to break open the door;” the beadle is an obedient
servant, and—the door is broken open. We see “Book safes” adver-
tised for security—under any violence soever—of books and documents:
we would advise for the protection of such pew-loving Samaritans as
our friend of Cheltenham, a “Church safe,”—where he might remain,
a choice dish, set apart for a banquet of grace. It is gossiped about
gossiping Cheltenham, that the aforesaid Christian has taken counsel's
opinion, “whether his pew is not as inviolate as his house, and whether
he may not, by arms or otherwise, resist any attempt to enter it.” We
are not in possession of the opinion given, but the gentleman has been
heard to express his intention not to attend Church next Sunday
without pistols. ...
If folks will cultivate the exclusive gentility of pews—carrying caste
to Church with them, as they would carry it to the theatre—we think
they ought, by the terms of lease, to be permitted to protect them like
gººden and orchards, and to exhibit this notice to the unseated-
Man-traps and spring-guns set in this pew.”
Freeze Cartoons.
THE paperstell us that the decorations, by MR. SANG, in the New
Coal Exchange are very cold. Now the subject treated are coals—an
if anything required a warmth of colouring, it should be coals. We
cannot imagine “cool tints” and blazing Walls'-Ends mixing well
together. But MR. SANg's genius has achieved this difficult associa:
tion. We are assured, in fact, that his brush has such a wonderful
F. of subduing everything, that if he had to paint the Fire of
ndon, he would execute it with the greatest SANGºſroid.
THE CIVIC SUCCESSION.
THE annual change has
just occurred in the
the Sovereignty of
City, and the late Mo-
narch of the Mansion
House retires upon his
SIR JAMEs DUKE-dom
from the Mayor’s nest
he has so worthily oc-
cupied. There is some-
thing pleasing in the
contemplation of the
extremely pacific pro-
cess by which the civic
crown passes from
brow to brow, and the
chain of office circu-
lates from neck to neck
without any connect-
ing link between the
one and the other.
Every year in the City
there occurs a kind of
revolution of 1688,
which is effected by
the abdication of one

sion of another; the
new Lord Mayor, or
King of the City, re-
resenting a sort of
rince of Orange, and
we see nothing more than this representative of Orange coming into new
quarters. The whole thing is, in fact, a complete substitution of one
reigning family for another, though the Civic Constitution remains the
same, and the dinners, which form the glory of the Civic reign, proceed
as usual, though there is an actual change of dynasty... -
The public who witness the splendid parade attending the inaugura-
tion of a new Lord Mayoralty, can form no idea of the smallness of the
actual amount of change that takes place when one Civic Sovereign is
succeeded by another. We would venture a wager that a carpet-bag
and dressing case would include all the personal movables of the out-
going potentate, and that a portmanteau will most probably comprise
ſhe hire of the effects” that go in with the new wearer of the
cockney diadem. The alteration resolves itself aſter all into a simple
question of luggage; and as it was said at Louis THE EIGHTEENTH's
restoration, “nothing is changed except that there is a Frenchman the
more in France,” so it may be said on a new Mayorally, “nothing is
changed, except that there may be a pair of boots or slippers more (or
less) at the Mansion House.”

Friday, November 2, 1849.-Up, and by Appointment to MR. WAG-
staffe's, and so with him to Westminster Hall, to see my LoRD
CHANCELLOR and the Judges, after Breakfast with my Lord, this being
the first, Day of Michaelmas Term, open the Law Courts in State, in
their Robes and Wigs., Wethere at 12, the Hour set for the Cere-
mony, but, we found, only for the Beginning of it by Breakfast, which
had we thought of, we had taken our Time, as knowing that my Lords
would be sure to take theirs. Nobody in the Hall when we got there
but a few Country Folk staring about them; and clear that we must
have Patience, MR. WAGSTAFFE did say, like many beside us in West-
minster Hall, and think ourselves lucky to be in no worse Case. So
we went out to look at the New Houses of Parliament, and to see how
the Masons º with the Building, which will be mighty fine when it
is done, and MR. TRANsonſ do commend the Style, and I admire it too,
both for the Proportions and also for the Heraldry and Lions. Then
back again to the Hall, where now a few more People; and presently
comes marching in a Party of Policemen, large enough to have taken
up all present, and yet hardly have had one Prisoner a-piece; but the
umbers did by Degrees, increase, and were, I did note, mostly of the
better Sort; which the Police do explain. Among them divers Bar:
risters-at-Law, some with their Sisters, some with their Wives, and
others with such as did seem like to be their Wives, many of whom

expected, not thinking they could care for Law Matters, or to see the

whetherit be to see or only to be seen. There for the first Time I did
behold MR. Toyºkyns, the young Barrister, in his Wig, wherein he do
look mighty sedate, and Itelling him, I hoped he would come to open
Term himself, made Answer as it might be some while first, he º
I might live to see it. The People now crowding about the Doors of
the Courts, the Police did make a Lane between them for my Lord
CHANCELLoR and the Judges to walk down, and MR. Wagstaffe did
call it Chancery Lane.
now we had a Sample of the Law’s Delay, and did pleasantly lay the
Lateness of the Breakfast to the Account of the MasTER of the Rolls.
But they at last come, and we opposite the Court of Common Pleas
got a good View of them to my Heart's Content. First comes the
ace, and a Gentleman in his Court Suit, wearing a Sword and Bag
and with them the Great Seal; then my Lord CHANCELLOR, and º
walk down to his Court at the End of the Hall, looking, the better of
his Sickness, which I was glad. After him the other Judges, of whom
most did enter the Door whereby we were, and mighty reverend they
looked, but º in good Humour, and beamy and ruddy after
their Breakfast. But to see MR. Justice TALFourp come last of all,
shaking Hands with his Friends on both Sides, he newly made a
Judge, being a Poet, did most content me; and MR. Wagstarre
did say he looked in §. Case, and by no means puisne. The Judges
all entered, the Rabblement let into the Hall, and we away, fearing

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
IHE GIBBET AND THE DEATH-BED. .
OUR LITTLE BIRD looks from a chimney-top.
A gallows stands upon a prison-roof. A mutter and slow roar of
voices drones upward through the morning mists—upward as from the
tº: pit; and then gabbling mockery, shouting, and blaspheming
ughter.
A man and woman are to be put to the death, that, forfeiting life, they
may in the agony show how sinful it is to kill. Authority is to do sacri-
ficial reverence to the vital flame of man, * treading it into darkness!
The early sun shines through upon the house-tops. The mists melt
apart, and in its stark black nakedness, stands the unmuffled gibbet.
The bell tolls, and upturned from below there is a pavement of stony
faces.—Qne broad compact mass of inwedged human feature, with ten
thousand differences, yet making one vast up-looking monster, with
thousands of straining eyes, whetted for a feast.
Still the solitary gallows waits. And in the pause, fancy beholds a
shade, man-shaped, seated on the scaffold. Is it the shade of CAIN, of
the First Murderer–branded by GoD, that the Homicide might NoT BE
KILLED; that every throb even of the fratricidal heart might teach a
fearful reverence of human life –
The white tips of the wands appear—and now there is CHRIST's
minister, not shadowy, but in the flesh; eloquent, tuneful with CHRIST's
own words, touched with immortal music. Words that promise starry
crowns to the two penitent heads, crimson with homicide—blasted with
murder. A moment, and if strong repentance bear them upward, they
at whom their fellow-men recoil as at things outcast and hellish—they
shall be among the blessed. Happiness shall be anticipated by remorse-
ful cruelty, and the trap of the gallows shall be as the vestibule to the
Abode of Glory.
For the hangman hangs not for the other world. Christianity,
that, where we read it, sheds no blood to prove the preciousness of
blood outpoured, crowns the penitent. And human law, in its grave
ungling—in its ceremonious, circumambient coursings—only speeds the
evil-doer to the fruition of his hopes. The sword of justice cuts off a
few years of heart-ache in this world; whilst the sustaining priest pro-
mises joy eternal to a full remorse.
But there is one remorseless, stony. She rejects the hope of an
immortal issue. A few momen's, and to her own desolate thought, even
now shuddering upon annihilation, she will be so much weight of clod
—the clay image of a murderess. . In what chapter, what verse, what
sentence of the Book of Christianity, does spectacled Law read its
right to deal death upon this crimsoned woman, foredating her distant
natural hour, that, with its gradual advance, might bring benigner
influence, touching that stony heart to flesh?—
The priest reads on. The hangman hears the signal word—a Gospel
Word!—the bolt is drawn, and man and woman are, by human pre-
sumption, cast beyond human **i. the moment a part and
parcel of the tremendous Future. , And Law is vindicated ' And the
sacredness of life has been made manifest to all men—nay, is yet
solemnly manifest in the two swayed carcases, not yet cold from the
retributive dealing of hangman justice.
Yes, human life is sacred. A hundred thousand human eyes behold
the proofs. The hangman—ghastly mountebank!—upon his scaffold,
may look grimly complacent at his work, and cry aloud—“Good
Christian people! Life is sacred. You may not doubt it; for I have
killed this man and woman that you may know what a solemn thing is
life—how very, very sacred is human blood.”
Man and woman are duly slain. And, with the act that rids the
earth of their abomination, there seems for the time to come a new
freedom upon the world. . We breathe, as though relieved of a foul
. We have got rid of the besetting presence of a daily
charnel wickedness that seemed to taint the air we drew—to poison
the social atmosphere. The idea of the atrocity did at times intrude–
a household nightmare. Convinced we are, that thoughts of the
horrible pair in their last night of life, troubled the sleep of many a
good man and woman in many a virtuous homestead. Assured we are,
that many, even behind comfortable curtains, were unwillingly made to
count the hours of the doomed man and wife—so arbitrary É. become
the thought of murder among us; so unceasingly and familiarly was it
made to mingle with our daily imaginings. And for much of this, let
us thank, the coming hangman and those gentlemen ushers of the
gibbet, who do the preliminary ceremonies in Sabbath print. The
murderer kills one man; and the law, in due process of killing the
murderer, enables the men who make a º: of the gallows to
kill the decencies of human society. For days together, they make
about our common way a very haze of blood.
The hour has passed; and the show ends. The living man and
woman, an hour since ſainting and stumbling up the narrow stair to
their doom, are now sent downward—readily handled—with the seal of
human justice on their clay faces. ... And death, even shameful death,
redeems something of the foulness that awhile ago festered them; for
they are now the cast-off coverings of immortal spirits: and what their
destiny, and where are they?, The very question that the clay suggests,
pleads with an unthought charity for the clay itself. May not the
wisdom of human law be somewhat perplexed by the tranquil face of a
gibbet corpse, law's own black handiwork, done on law's presumption?
|Let the dead lips seem to ask of the Iaw—"Wherefore didst thou
thrust forth my spirit into eternity? By what Christian rule didst
thou outrage the holiness of death by making death infamous?” And,
to our thinking, we know not where Law shall find a justifying answer.
Human justice, to our thought, stands baffled even by a murderer's
corpse. There is no balance so nice, that it may weight human blood.
Our Little Bird takes sudden flight. Away towards the 'Surrey
hills. Two or three minutes on the wing, and now it settles upon a
tree that gently, waves beside a chamber window. There is a deep
*:::::: about the house, for death is only lingering ere it crosses the
threshold.
In the chamber is an old man dying. He is crowned with the
righteousness of a beautiful life. His days have been alike profitable
to his fellow-man and to his own soul. Kindred and friends wait and
watch about him. Every tear that falls is a sweet offering to death;
a tribute to its consummating holiness of mortal hopes. The man has
layed out a long life for the calm glory of the time—for the hallowing
loveliness of this parting hour. And it falls upon him and about him
and the hum of earth stills, then deepens into immortal music. An
this is death, the inevitable—and thank God! inevitable—fate of the
righteous man, whose life has been a daily excellence.
And yet this death, the best reward of the best—we in our perverse-
|ness make the worst punishment of the worst. The same cup that the
| saint drinks of, we force to the lips of the murderer; and both alike—
with the blessing of penitence—drink life eternal. And by this
ignorance—we would speak with humility—it has ever been our faith
that the sacredness of death is outraged; that holy, consecrating Death
is affronted in its solemnity when hurried from its certain purpose, when
suborned by man to do a seeming, ignominy upon his fellow. For the
infamy is but ceremonial: man himself denounces the presumption
that would punish beyond the stroke of death. Man—legislative man!
—becomes so modest, merciful, when looking dimly forth upon the
Unknown—the Impossible ! -
The good man, on Sunday next to be hymned and wept to his honoured
grave—and the murderers, thrust prayerless to-night in a prison-hole,
a meal for burning lime that cheats the worm—all lie in the same wide
bed. Death makes all even, but—we say it—death's sanctity by force
is violated. -
We would seek punishment of life. Of the living hours would we
make a scourge for murder. Of the running sand would we make
withering seconds. Every hour should fall with its weight, and the
murderer’s grave be “thoroughly earned.” Not that we have unre-
flecting tenderness for crime would we save the criminal, but that we
would not desecrate the holiness of death; death, that, when men shall
be better taught, will be revealed in his true beneficence: the deliverer
and not the tyrant. -
Finally, where is our right to summon death to do our self-willed
handiwork? We can find no written warrant for it in Christianity—
though a sort of Christianity is prone to put on Urim and Thummim to
enunciate it. Any way, when we would make an offering to the sanc:
|tity of life, should we strangle a man to vindicate the holiness of
existence P - - -
And you would let the murderer live? Yes...That even his liſe
respected, might preach to men the solemnity of life. ... But his life
should be continual mortification—constant penance. Like the dial, in
the sunniest time, his soul should know the present hour only by the
shade. A LITTLE BIRD.

GRAND VEGETABLE BANQUET TO THE POTATO ON HIS LATE RECOVERY.:
(From our own Correspondent in Vegetaria).

That º: vegetable, the Potato, being now, it is hoped,
thoroughly re-established in health, it was determined by a few leading
members of the Vegetable Kingdom to offer a banquet to the worthy
and convalescent root on his happy recovery. The arrangements for the
dinner were on a scale of great liberality, and the guests included all
the principal vegetables. The invitations had been carried out by an
efficient corps of Scarlet Runners, and the Onion occupied the chair.
He was supported on his right by the head of the Asparagus family,
while Salad occupied a bowl at the other end of the table, and was
dressed in his usual manner. The Potato, though just out of his bed,
was looking remarkably well, and wore his jacket, there being mothing
to mark his recent illness, except perhaps a little apparent blackness
round one of his eyes. After the cloth had been removed,
The Onion got up to propose as a toast, the Potato, their much
respected guest. (Immense, cheering.) He, the Qnion, had known the
Potato ſtom infancy; and though they had not always been associated
in life, they had frequently met at the same table. They had some-
times braved together the same broils,and had found themselves often
together in such a stew (he alluded to the Irish stew) as had brought
them, for the time being, into an alliance of the very closest kind. He,
the Onion, was delighted to see the Potato once more restored to his
place in society; for he, the Onion, could say without flattery, that
59;iety had endeavoured to supply the place of the Potao, in vain.
(Hear, hear.) They had heard of Rice having been suggested to take
the place of his honourable friend, but the suggestion was really
ridiculous. Risum teneatis, amici, was all that he, the Onion, had to
say to that. (Loud Laughter, in which all but the Melon jºined). He,
the Onion, would not detain them longer, but would conclude by pro-
posing health, long life, and prosperity to the Potato.
The toast was received with enthusiasm by all but the Cucumber,
whose, coolness seemed to excite much disgust among his brother
vegetables. The Onion had, in fact, affected many of those present to
tears, and the Celery, who sat next to the Horseradish, hung down his
head in an agony of sensibility. When the cheering had partially
subsided, the Potato rose, but that was only a signal for renewed
LEGAL TIME-TABLES.
-- THERE is much want felt, alike by suitors and professional men, of a
Westminster Hall Time-ſable,” or “Legal BRAnshaw.” It should
give the starting-time of the several Courts, and a table of definitions
into the bargain. As an example—
The Courts adjourn (in banc) till 10 o'clock, which means, in
Queen's Bench.
10 minutes past 10. |
Again, the definition table would enable the public to correct legal
by lay time. Thus, “Stands for argument on 10:h November, 1849,”
would be at once unders'ood as equivalent to “may come on about
May 8th, 1850, unless counsel choose to have it stand over till after the
long vacation.” A want of understanding the true import of the Legal
Time Vocabulary makes litigants unnecessarily impatient; for nobody
now “knows the time of day” in Westminster Hall, except the lawyers.

enthusiasm, and it was some minutes before silence was restored. At
length the £otato proceeded nearly as follows:–
“Friends and fellow vegetables. It is with difficulty I express the
feeling with which I have come here to-day. Having suffered for the
last three or four years from a grievous disease, which seemed to
threaten me with total dissolution; it is with intense satisfacion I
find myself once more among you in the vigour of health. (Cheers.) I
should be indeed insensible to kindness, were I to forget the anxious
inquiries that have been made as to the state of my healh, by those who
have held me in esteem, and sometimes in a steam... (A laugh, in whic:
all but the Melon joined.) I cannot boast of a long line of ancestors. I
did not, like some of you, come in with the ConquEROR, but I came
in the train of civilisation amidst the memorable luggage cf. SIR
WALTER RALEIGH, in company with . Right Honourable friend the
Tobacco, who is not now present, but who often helps the philosopher
to take a bird's eye view of some of the finest subjects for reflection.
(Immense cheering, and a nºd of assent from the Turnp Top.) Though I
may be a foreigner, I may jusly say, inat I have taken root in the soil,
and though I may not have the grace of the Cucumber, who seems to
have come here in no enviable frame (loud cheering), I believe I have
done as much goºd as any living vegetable; for, though almost always
at the rich man's table, I am seldom absent from the poor man's humble
board. (Tremendous applause.) But,” continued the Potato, “let me not
get flowery, or meaſy-mouthed, for there is something objectionable in
each extreme. I have undergone many vicissitudes in the course of m
existence. I have been served up, aye, and served out (a smile) in
sorts of ways. I have been roasted by some; I have been basted by
others; and I have had my jacket rudely torn off my back by many
who knew not the treatment I deserved. But this meeting, my friend
repays me for all. Excuse me if my eyes are watery. (Sensation.)
am not very thin skinned; but } feel deeply penetrated by your
kindness this day.
The Potato resumed his seat amid the most tumultuous cheering,
which lasted for a considerable time.
The Horse Guards' Clock.
REPORT states that the Horse Guards' Clock will probably be brought
under the operation of the Winding Up Act, in consequence of some
irregularities that have lately been observed. We regret to say that
its old hands have not been so faithful as heretofore, though there has
been no actual stoppage of the works. We cannot undertake to say
the cause of this melancholy change in the habits of the Clºck, but
there is reason to believe that there are, as the saying is, "wheels
within wheels.”
WELL, PLACED.
THE President of the French Republic has presented the Army and
Navy Club with a piece of tapestry. The question is, where to put it.
SIBthorp suggests that, “As it is Gobelin, it ought to be put in the
dining-room, which might then be called the ‘Salle de Gobblin.”

COMFORT THE CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS.
YESTERDAY a numerously attended Temperance Meeting was held
at Punch's Moderation Reading Rooms, and House of Call for the
Poorer Classes. The assembly was formed, principally, of inmates of
Mººsing Houses. The highly respectable Proprietor occupied
the Chair.
WILL Woof, addressing the assembly, hoped they would not think
that, because he was a weaver, he was going to spin them a long yarn.
He was sorry to say that till lately he had been addicted to drinking. As
soon as he got his wages he used to go to the public-house, and there
sit and soak, till he had spent all he had. Half next week he was ill,
and couldn’t work. In consequence, his wife and children had often
neither bread to eat, clothes to their backs, or shoes to their feet. All
was pawned for drink. Now he always took home his earnings to the
old woman; and she and the young 'uns was all º and comfortable.
He was employed regular, and his wages had lately been riz. . But how
come this here change? Why, in his drunken days he lived in a nasty,
beastly, abominable undrained court. He wouldn't make them sick by
describing of it. What then? Why, his life was a misery. There F
they were, he and his wife, and six children, all huddled together in one
hole. Nothing everywhere but sench and filth; no comfort nowhere.
Except one place. The Public House ! There was elbow-room, air, a
ood fire, clean saw-dust on the floor, and no smell, worse than baccy.
othere he went, and smoked his pipe, and drownded his troubles in
gin. The end on it was information of the brain. He had a narrow
squeak, . Thanks be, however, he come round at last. ...The doctor
advised him to move to the Model Lodging Houses. He did. He paid
less for his lodgings than what he did afore, he had lots, of room, and
water, and everything handy: besides the Baths and Washhouses to
#. to... Now his place was meat and tidy, and ship-shape; and he was
ond of his home. He took his drop of beer and his pipe of an evening
by his own fireside, and set a example to his children. The dro
wasn’t a drop too much, neither. He had turned oyer a new leaf, an
what had made him do it was the Model Lodging Houses.
ToM AUGER related how, previously to his adoption of the Modera-
tion system, he was constantly quarrelling in the streets, and getting
into the Station-House.
JACK LAST confessed that before his amendment he was in the habit
of welling his wife.
SAM PLUMMETT, PATRICK HopD, Joe KIPPERs made similar avowals,
and exhibited the traces of wounds and other injuries which they had
received in moments of inebriety. All agreed in laying their reformation
to the door of the Model Lodging Houses.
Dick ALLwright stood before them in a steady attitude, which till
lately he could not have done for a long time. He had been a sad
drunkard. He was ashamed to say so. Drunkenness was a degrading
vice, certainly ; for it lowered a man to a beast. But there was too
much cant about the badness on it; bad as it was. Drunkenness, to
be sure, led to all sorts of crimes. ... But drinking warm’t like stealing,
cheating, or telling lies. People didn’t get drunk deliberate. A poor
feller was miserable. He took a glass to cheer his spirits. The medicine
So he went on till he past the
pint of discretion, , Drunkenness was like scratching one’s self for
itching, and scratching too hard. It come of impatience, which was a
sin, he know’d, but let your comfortable people consider the temptation.
Model Lodging Houses and Baths and Washhouses made poor people
comfortable; and cured them of the low wretched spirits that was
’casioned by filth and stench. So then they left off a keeping of their
sperrits up by pouring of sperrits down; and of course the ſect stopped
when the cause did—it stood to reason and materal philosophy.
The CHAIRMAN was delighted to find himself in so respectable an
assembly of reclaimed sots; reformed through the establishment of
dging Houses. There they were formerly living like pigs in
a sty; here they were now like doves in a cage. One important point,
which no speaker had mentioned—from modesty, he supposed—was, that
they now never forgot, as they formerly did sometimes, to pay their
rents. This led him to the resolution he had to propose, namely—
“That this Meeting earnestly requests the co-operation of capi-
talists in the cause of Temperance, by investment in the no
º: profitable than benevolent scheme of Model Lodging
ouses.’
Bob Jolly proposed three cheers for the Chairman, which having
been given, the Meeting separated.
. Buy your Leaves.
Another enormous Blue-Book, has just been issued by the Select
Committee appointed to enquire into the Woods and Forests. . We
understand that there will be several more reports, and it is probable
that every, tree in every wood and forest will eventually have a separate
leaf. Perhaps, if the result is that the Woods and Forests turn over
new leaves, the expense may be beneficial after all.
WHAT WE SHALL HAVE NEXT.
“I am the ‘Father of a Family’ who writes to the Mornin
Herald. But that, excellent Daily Paper (whose principles are ad-
mirable) does not admit illustrations, and I cannot express my feelings
on the subject of the Fº letter, without the aid of a sketch.
“Sir, Ihave long lost all control over the wardrobe of MRs. B–
and my daughters. Every day they come out in some new abomination
—a few weeks ago, it was those appendages of cutlery, and ironmongery
jangling, and dangling, and cutting one's legs under the table, an
{. upon chairs when one sat down, all knives and scissors, and other
sharp points. - -
“At another time I find them suddenly expanded to twice their
natural size by strange contrivances, which must be horse hair by the
way they rustle and stick out all round. MRs. B-, I am thankful to
say, has lately subsided from this tubby state into her actual dimensions,
(which are considerable,) but only to burst out into something she calls
“a bear-skin,' a kind of rough garment, like that worn by cabmen,

“The girls have followed her example. and I declare to you that
from behind, as we walk out, I seem to be conducting four unwilling
convicts in winter clothing, or to be showing the lions to a party of

ANECDOTES OF THE THAMES.
“ALLow me to drink your health,” exclaimed a Tea-totaller, raising
to his lips a fumbler of water just drawn from a London, cistern.
“Never!” cried the individual addressed, ..". the tumbler with
a motion of his hand. “Never, my friend, shall, you drink my health
at the sacrifice of your own.” Both parties stood silent for an instant,
when a sediment at the bottom of the tumbler revealed the awful fact
that the liquid thus happily disposed of had been supplied by a
Metropolitan Water Company.
Anecdote, No. 2–An unfortunate railway speculator had for some
time exhibited a morbid depression of the spirits, which it was feared
by his friends might take a turn towards suicide. Every º
had been taken to keep all implements of mischief out of his reach,
but a few days ago the unhappy man was seen to make a sudden rush
at the cistern—which is supplied with Thames water—and had he not
been seized by a trusty domestic, there is no doubt he would, in another
minute, have drawn and swallowed the fatal draught.

Hansom CARMAN (boldly). “Six Shillings, Sir.”
Old Gºnt. “What! Why how many miles do you callit from Temple Bar to the Bank?"
CARMAN. “Oh! If you want to make it a mere mercan-tile transaction, you shall

BRITANNIA’S THANKSGIVING DAY DREAM.
AN awful Plague went through the land: it thinn'd the close-pent town,
Swept the scanthamlet, crossed thestream, and clomb the breezydown;
Unseen it breathed, till poison seethed in the sweet summer air;
Before its face was terror, upon its track despair.
For three sad months BRITANNIA mourned her children night and day,
For three sad months she strove in vain the pestilence to stay:
Medicine, helpless, groped and guessed, and tried all arts to save,
But the dead carried with them their secret to the grave.
Sudden the dark hand ceased to smite : BRITANNIA drew free breath,
As passed away the shadow of the minister of Death:
And upon all her children a solemn charge she laid,
That high and low should bow them down, because the plague was staid.
Then in the night that followed on that thanksgiving day,
BRITANNIA saw a vision, as on her bed she lay:
Of a great region stretched about, a crowded careful land,
Wherein men plied all labours, of head, and heart, and hand.
In it a city, high o'er which a golden temple shone,
Wherein the great god Mammon was sitting on a throne,
While millions round about his feet, men, women, old and young,
| Offered their hearts in homage, with various tone and tongue.
Ill matched that city’s dwellings; low hovel, palace high;
Saloons with stately pageants, huts where wretches slunk to die;
Well-ordered streets, with tracts hard by wherein the labouring breath
Inhaled the subtle poison that makes life a lingering death.
There for aught save Mammon-worship there were few hearts to care,
For aught but Mammon-service there were few hands to spare;
Still the pale slaves grew paler, the task-masters more stern,
Few there of wise had time to love, of ignorant to learn.
Death sat at the gaunt weaver's side, the while he plied the loom;
Death turn'd the wastinggrinder’s wheel, as he earn'd his bread and doom;
Death, by the wan shirtmaker, plied the fingers to the bone;
Death rocked the infant's cradle, and with opium hushed its moan.
Nor in the City only did the Spectre hold his place;
In the village and the hamlet, too, he showed his constant face:
In the ſoul sty where sire and son, mother and maiden slept,
Where the infant round its playground, the dunghill, crowed and crept.
At bed and board, in cup and can, in worktime and in play,
In the street as in the dwelling, in the night as in the day,
Sat Death in Life, a presence that none did seem to note,
Until the grim Guest sudden rose and bared his arm and smote.
Then was weeping in the hovel, and wailing in the hall,
And over all the land was fear, stretched like a funeral pall;
And even Mammon's vot’ries paused in their absorbing prayer,
And looked up from their worship, with a daunted, doubting air.
And turning in their trouble unto their God and Lord,
They saw Death sit on Mammon's throne—’twas Death that they adored.
His bare jaws set in scornful smile, the Spectre from his shroud
Stretched forth his fleshless arm across the pale and palsied crowd.
“Your day of thanks,” it said, “is come, your day of thanks is o'er;
Millions to-day have prayed their prayer, that never prayed before.
What reck I of your thankfulness, ye fools, or of your prayer?
One plague hath passed from out your homes, how many still are there f
“What can one day of prayer avail, if from the church ye go
To your homes unswept, ungarnished, to your world of wealth and wo?
Pray as you will, my stronghold's still in every ditch and drain;
Though now my servants hide their heads, they will come forth again.
“Why shrink from Death, ye that build up his seat in every home f
How be thankful at his going, ye that ever bid him come?
What wonder he makes revel, when still ye spread his board *
Need he be chary of his plagues when still ye feed his hoard P
“I am a giant. Would ye learn to nip me in my growth?
Bring light of Heaven and rain of Heaven to those that pine for both;
Build homes for toil, where toil may live in decency and health;
Let ignorance and want have tithe of knowledge and of wealth. .
“Show that the bond of brotherhood that linketh man with man
Will no less bind, though never forged, since first the world began;
Unlearn that sinful selfishness, that ye so sore have rued,
And strive to find in common grief the seeds of common good.”

QUEEN VICTORIA'S STATUE.
A TALE OF PIMLICO.
THERE nestles on the borders of Grovesmor Place a square of modest
dimensions, to which fancy and a painter, plumber, and glazier, have
combined to give the name of Victoria Square. In the centre of this
retreat from the 'buses and the bustles, the cabs and the cabals, of this
noisy world, there stood upon a foot and a half of sº granite the
two feet of HER MAJESTY, supporting a Statue moulded by the mallet
and chipped by the chisel of WYATT. The sculptor had not done
justice to the Sovereign's graceful form, and “all nature,” from the
ird on the wing to the boy on the kerbstone, seemed to mark with
indignation this large lithographic libel on royalty; The sparrow had
built its nest in HER MAJESTY's back hair, the spider had spun his web
over the royal eye, the lady-bird had found its way to the royal ear,
and it was at length determined to rescue the stone representation of
Majesty from these indignities. The Statue has been accordingly re-
moved from Victoria Square, and has been lately consigned to the
New Road, where it has taken its place among ornamental chimney
pots and damaged stone potentates.
We are not sorry that the removal has taken place, for the sculptor
had performed his chiselling anything but gently, and had produced a
figure that bore no resemblance to the gracious original, whose resi:
dence near the spot gave the inhabitants frequent opportunities of
seeing how little justice the artist had done to their Sovereign.
THE GREAT UNwash ED.—Old Father Thames.
“It’s a Long Lane that has no turning,” as the old woman, who

STOCKS AND STONES.
WE have no hesitation in saying that whoever, after reading some
of the recent disclosures in the Morning Chronicle, can wear a cheap
| stock, must have a heart of stone. If we were PRINCE ALBERT, we
| would at once insist on the total release of our royal name from those
hateful ties which are paraded in the shop-windows as ‘Albert ties,”
and for the making of which only 6d. a dozen is paid!. It is a libel on
his Royal Highness, who has lately shown so much warm-hearted
interest in the cause of the industrious classes, to couple him, even
nominally, with those stocks and neck-ties, whose wearers—if they
knew the horrible sacrifices entailed by the low price manufacture-
would be ashamed to hold up their h over even the stiffest of these
odious articles.
We shall never look upon one of those cheap stocks again, without
feeling our choler raised in an extraordinary degree; and we could not
put such a thing round our neck without a sort of throttling sensa 1On,
engendered by the knowledge that, for the production of these stocks
and ties, rapacity has taken necessity by the throat. The wealthy
capitalist, who watches the daily fluctuation of the funds, has thought
hitherto but little of the fearful consequences resulting, from the
downward tendency in the prices of another kind of stocks. A fall
in Spanish may diminish, by a few thousands or hundreds, the gain of
the millionaire or the less opulent speculator; but a fall in the Albert
Stock-market curtails the already insufficient crust of the poor
needle-woman, and sends tottering into the abyss many who were
...: on the edge of the slippery partition between starvation

“The Albert Stocks used to be 3s.6d. to 4s. a dozen, when they first
came up. They’re 2s. to ls. 9d., now;” says the informant of the
Morning Chronicle. And we venture to assert, that the decline in the
Stock Market is more appalling in its consequences than the ups and
downs of that other Stock Market in which knavery and jobbery
avarice and recklessness, folly and cunning, pursue their unhallowe
course. Henceforth, whatever we may hear said of prosperity in con-
nection with rises in the funds, we shall cease to have faith in the
soundness of the state of things, until we are satisfied that the Albert
Stocks are looking up.

A Hint to Lexicographers to Come.
As HAYNAU passes current now as a synonyme for everything that
is cruel, and wicked, and bad, we think the word “heinous” could be
made more expressive if it were spelt “HAYNAUs.” The same with
the word “heinousness.” It would gain greatly in meaning and
cruelty of expression, if it were to be written, for the future, “HAY-
| NAUSNEss.”

The Great Moral Lesson at Horsemonger Lane Gaol, Nov. 13.
THE LESSON OF THE scAFFOLD ; or, THE RUFFIAN's HOLIDAY.
WE was havin a kevarten wen BILL he says, says he, Thicker flocked the crowd apace, louder grew the glee,
“To-morrow is the hanging-match; let us go and see.” There was little kids a dancin, and fightin for a spree;
I was game for anything: off we set that night; But the rarest fun for me and BILL, and all our jolly pals,
Ha! the jolly time we spent until the morning light. Was the squeakin and squallin and faintin of the gals.
'Neath the timbers whereupon the conwicts wos to die, “Time’s up !” at last cries BILL. “Why, sure, it ain't to be a sell!"
Never. It can’t be, I should think. All right ! There goes the knell!
See, here they come, and no mistake, JACK KETCH and all his crew:
The Sheriffs, Parson, and—that's them! Hats off in front, there, you!
(And ugly black the gallows looked atween us and the sky)—
More than thirty thousand on us shouted, yelled, and sung,
Chaffin about murder, and going to be hung.
Each public-house was all alight, the place just like a fair; “Quick, JACK's about it. There he's got the fust beneath the beam;
Ranting, roaring, rollicking, larking everywhere, And now, the other! Not a start, a tremble, or a scream
Boosing and carousing we passed the night away, All's ready. There they stand alone. The rest have gone below.
And ho! to hear us curse and swear, waiting for the day. Look at him—look—he's at the bolt! Now for it ! Down they go!”
At last the morning sunbeams slowly did appear, 'Twas over. Well, a sight like that aſore these eyes of mine
And then, ha, ha! how rum we looked, with bloodshot eyes and blear: |I never had—no sort of mill, cockfightin, or canine.
But there was two good hours at least afore the hanging yet, Hurrah! you dogs, for hangin, the feelins to excite;
So still we drained the early purl, and swigged the heavy wet. I could ha throttled BILL almost, that moment, with delight.
But, arter all, what is it? A tumble and a kick!
And, anyhow, 'tis seemingly all over precious quick,
And shows that some, no matter for what they’ve done, dies game !
Ho, ho! if ever my time comes, I hope to do the same !

THE GREATEST CURIOSITY OF ADVERTISING
LITERATURE.
EING desirous to save trouble to any future Dis-
RAELI, whº might have to look very far indeed,
before he found such another Curiosity of Lite:
rature as the following, we print it at once, in
its entirety, and the gem is so precious, that we
trust, the compositors will not spoil even the
minutest point in the setting:—
APARTMENT. Furnished, pleasant and airy part
of Barnsbury-road, Islington, for gentlemen or others
without small family. No children in the house. Two
parlours, with folding doors, together or separate, with a
moveable bedstead; the front one, with every attendance,
boots included, 6s. ; both rooms, 8s. 6d. Good reference
given and expected to two gentlemen who have occupied
the front parlour (both have been newly papered and
painted) removed to the west end. Omnibuses every quar-
ter. Address
Now, let us analyse this delicious composition,
for the result will well repay the trouble of the
process. In the first place, the advertisement
plunges in medias res, or, at all events, into the
; of the “Furnished, pleasant, and airy
part of Barnsbury Road, Islington.” We were
not aware that any part of this road was furnished,
though there is nothing strange in the fact, for we have seen, many
furnished roads, where furniture is piled outside the shops, in the
thoroughfares where brokers “most do congregate.” “No children
in the house” is an important announcement, and well deserves the
honours of a full stop, both before and after it. . -
The next sentence almost confounds us with its startling effects and
astounding ambiguities: “Two parlours, with folding doors, together
or separate (this may mean that the folding doors can be closed or rudely
torn apart) with a moveable, bedstead; (this, implies the possibility of
restlessness in the lodger, and a desire to be wheeling his bedstead about
his room, instead of quietly lying down upon it). The front one (that
is the front bedstead) with every attendance, (“every is a large and
comprehensive term,) boots included (whose boots? does it mean the
party will be found in shoe leather?), 6s, both rooms, 8s. 6d.” Here
we are allowed the pause of a period to take breath, but time is no
sconer up, than we are hurried off into the following labyrinth of unin-
telligibilities. “Good reference given and expected to two gentlemen
(what right have the two gentlemen to expect anything of the kind, and
what satisfaction will it be to the new lodger that a good reference has
been given to these two anonymous gentlemen?) who have occupied the
front parlour, both have been newly painted and papered (we have heard
of gentlemen being whitewashed, but newly painted and*: gentle-
men must be º indeed), removed to the West End, (where, in
their newly painted and papered state they must excite the most intense
curiosity), Omnibuses every quarter.” (They must be a great boon
to any lodger who only requires the accommodation of an omnibus every
quarter day to go and receive his dividends). - -
We have seen a good deal of mystification in the advertising columns
of our contemporaries from time to time, but if this advertisement does
not present many more nuts to crack, and much harder nuts also than
any in the mouth of the .# we will undertake to eat our own head,
or, at all events, our own heading to this article.
In compliment to the splendid hospitalities of SIR, JAMEs. DUKE,
his mayoralty is known in City history as the Duke dinnersty
(dynasty).

Monday, November 5, 1849—(Guy Fawkes' Day). At Breakfast
this Morning off a new-laid Egg, cost me 2d, but cheap for the Time of
Year, did hear a shrill Hallooing in the Street, which my Wife, looking
out of Window, told me was made by the Boys, going by with their Guy
RAwkEs... I did then call to Mind that this was Guy Fawkes his
Day; and, did in Haste swallow my Breakfast, and put on my Boots
and Qver-Coat, and so out and about the Streets and Squares to see the
Sport, the Bells ringing for Church, and a Scarecrow of a Guy, borne
by Urchins on a Handbarrow, with Rough Musique at almost every
urn and Corner. Mighty droll, Guy FAwkes his Effigies, with his
Fingers sticking out like Spikes, and his Feet all awry, his Body and
Limbs stuffed with Straw, a Mask for his Face, with a Pipe in the
Mouth, and a Lantern and Tinder-Box dangling from his Wrist, and on
his Head a Paper Cap, like an old Grenadier's, but a Cross on it, and
meant for the Pope his Crown. I did remember, the Mirth it used to
be to behold Guy with his Company, borne by the Police in State to
the Station House, but they this Year mostly let alone, and more Guys,
and ragged Regiments of Boys shouting after them, than ever I think I
did before see. The Warlets, as they went, repeating Doggrel Verses,
bidding to remember the Day, and asking j. they met for
Money for a Bonfire to burn their Guy, and did beg of me; but I gave

the Back Ways and Streets to Fleet Street, Squibs and Crackers in the

to Tower Hill, where the Banging and Blazing of the Fireworks the
reatest of all; and the Roman Candles and Pin-wheels mighty pretty;

was a Cracker pinned by some Scapegrace to my Goat Tail and
did make me to jump, and the Standers-by to laugh : which did
vex me to the Heart; and MR. GREGORY do say, served me right
for countenancing such Doings. . But to see the Mob flinging Ser-
pents at each other, and burning and singeing one another like
Devils, did much divert me, till a Squib, whizzing past me did scorch
me in the Face. Truly Guy FawkEs his Day this Time was mighty
well kept, and MR. HowLETT do rejoice in its better, Observance,

agree with MR. WAGSTAFFE that Protestancy is not a Doctrine of

burn him any more.

THE MANNINGS AT HOME.
THERE was a good old notion about to die, but in a manner preserved
by MADAME Tussaud, that much mischief might be done by wax. In
this fashion. An elderly woman—if with a beak nose, and a haired
wart upon her chin, all the better—took a bit of wax, and warming
it by a fire fed with fat from murderers' gibbet, and certain unrighteous
unguents, moulded it into the small similitude of a living man or
woman. ... This bit of wax, warmed by flame, wasted - and as it
wasted, it was supposed that its great prototype, by diabolic sym-
thy, wasted too. Well, later wisdom turns topsy-turvy early know-
É. We do not imitate the living in wax, to kill the living; but
we make a similitude of the dead, to do an injury to those in no way
like them in the flesh.
MADAME Tussaud, cunning in the witchcraft of the nineteenth
century, takes so much wax, and makes of it the likeness of MARIA
MANNING and GEORGE MANNING—(the last Murder Dummies)—and
does a grievous injury to her generation by the handiwork. The witch
works in wax, and helps to destroy the living decencies.
AME Tussaud is the artistic continuation of MR. CALCRAFT.
When the hangman has done his work, the wax witch takes it up and
beautifies it." There was a horrid crowd to see the MANNINgs hanged
—and where the wonder P. Ignorance, barbarism, vice, cruelty, all
attended the invitation. For how iong had a Sunday press invited
them? And the wicked ones did not weep, or smite their pensive
breasts, but laughed and drank the daylight in, and mustered their
best spirits to assist at the show. But these were the forlorn, the
wretched outcasts of decent life. People, comfortable to do, and
with handsome clothes upon their backs, behave better.
We witnessed the crowd that—prompt to MADAME TUSSAUD's card
of invitation, that, like a blotch of blood, stands filthily out from the
columns of the papers – gathered in Baker Street, to see MARIA
MANNING and GEORGE MANNING, in wax, at home. The crowd
behaved remarkably well. But then, several of the curious spectators
came in their own vehicles—many in cabs; and those who came on
foot were all decently habited. We were deſighted to remark that not
one of them squeaked like Punch—(the low fellow in the street)—
or committed any other unseemly breach of etiquette. On the con-
trary, very genteel people mounted the steps of the show, mincingly;
some of them running the tips of their tongue round their lips, as
anticipating a “sweet bonne bouche.”.
We are bound—conscientiously critical—to give MADAME Tussaud
the very highest praise for her artistic ability. Age cannot wither her, nor
the custom she continues to receive at the hands of a generous public,
stale her infinite variety. MARIA MANNING, as done in wax, is really a
chef-d'oeuvre. Dear thing!, she would be a treasure as a lady's maid at
a hundred a-year, with all the cast dresses. Never did assassination look
so amiable—so like a quality to be introduced to the bosom of families.
We confess the weakness; under the waxen wand of the enchantress, we
felt for a moment towards MARIA MANNING, as in earlier, whiter days,
we felt towards the Maria of STERNE. She only wanted a lamb to be
quite a duck: , Beautifully has MADAME TUss AUD elevated the cha-
racter of the fair destroyer of the mercenary PATRick O'ConnoR. A
lively rose-blush, pervades her full-blown face, and her large, ripe lip
seems pouting with the first syllable of “mur-der.” . And then her head
is so tastefully, so touchingly enveloped—as though drest at the jury
—covered with old point lace, made classic by MRs. SIDDONs in 1.
Macbeth, and continued by MRs. WARNER. We think the artist should
have placed just a sprig of rue between the fingers of MARIA—the now
historic rue she pitched so strong at the lawyers. However, if the rue
be wanting, the . satin gown is unexceptionable. There she stands
in silk attire, a beauteous thing, to be daily rained upon by a shower of
sixpences.
EORGE MANNING is greatly improved in his appearance under the
hands of MADAME Tussaud. He has the look of a very clean under-
taker, a little above his business.
Perhaps, the huge satisfaction that possessed us, was a little lessened
when we thought of the transitoriness of wax-work glory. Where was
GREENACRE * Pushed back for GEORGE. Where Good? Set aside
for MARIA. But such is fame.
... We have no doubt, to the honour of public taste, that this murder
in wax-work will be very popular. Fortunately, the low brutes who
behaved so ill at Horsemonger Lane will not be able to disgust a
thinking º: by their licence in Baker Street. They can't afford
t t People who can pay their money, respect at once decency and their
esters.
Might we be allowed to give a hint to such a worldly-wise establish-
ment as that of the Tussaud, we would suggest, that as a band attends
in the evening, a sort of musical pasticcio might be put together, that
should describe the Bermondsey horror from the course of O'Connor's
first wooing, until the final appearance of MR. and MRs. MANNING on
the roof of Horsemonger. We think this would have a great attraction
for families.
exhibition for himself. As the political Conservator of public de-
cency, he will then know the exact amount of Government notice that
such a show demands of his authority. , Possibly, the magistrates of
the district might likewise be induced to attend. . Plays, must be
licensed, not so murder in wax-work. We perceive that a hard-
working manager, by name CAMPBELL, at Stockton-upon-Tees, has been
oor man! Should
prosecuted for representing RUSH upon the stage.
the worst come to the worst, we hope MADAME Tussaud will give
the manager a post—if only as money-taker—to RUSH in wax.
The MANNINGs will no doubt form a great attraction in the approach-
ing season. They cannot be made too familiar to families. Christmas,
with all its delights, will soon be upon us.
As we have the MANNINGs
in wax, why should we not have them in sugar for Twelfth-cakes P
“Sweets to the sweet!”
A STRONG GAL.E.
A LIEUTENANT GALE proposes to go in a balloon to look for SIR
JoHN FRANKLIN. Jack Frost, we fear, would soon say to GALE,
“Cease, loud Boreas;” and we cannot but think that GALE, if he
...; the attempt, would only be the ill wind “that blows nobody any
goo º
Imagination forms icicles on the tips of our nose, as we figure to
ourselves the daring GALE “blow high, blow low,” with the thermo:
meter 15 degrees below zero, his gas contracted, his balloon congealed
into a flying iceberg, or like the head of an airy giant with his night-
cap on, while the poor frozen out aeronaut surveys his brandy-bottle
solidified into a mass of ice à la Cognac, and his cold fowls too cold for
his knife to penetrate them.
The mere picture throws us into a chilly pickle; and we trust GAIE,
for his own sake, will not be able to raise the wind for so absurd a
purpose,
RITCHEN STUFF AT GUILDHALL.
THE Commissioners of the City Police have been complaining to the
Court of Aldermen, that at the Guildhall banquet their Chief had no
appointed place, but was subjected to the indignity of coming in contact
with waiters, and the refuse of the kitchen. This is too bad; but we
suppose the City Magistrates will find their excuse in the well-known
fact of the Police never being so much at home as when they are down
in the kitchen... We have no doubt, the arrangement was generously
made in order to bring the Police all the nearer to the great divinity
they worship—the cook. We admit the indignity was rather severe
upon a talented man like DANIEL WHITTLE VEY, but probably the
Stewards were of opinion that the kitchen, after all, was the best place
in the world for. Whittles. (We are perfectly aware that this joke has
been made before, so we beg no one will take the trouble to inform us of the
Any way, we beg that SIR GEORGE GREY will drop in and judge the fact. —Ed.)

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
DON MIGUEL AT HIS “POST.”
A FEw days ago—as the Post with serenest satisfaction publishes—
DoN MIGUEL and suite attended at the office of the Early JENKINs
“to inspect minutely the various departments of the establishment.”
JENKINs had arrayed himself in his warmest plush, and dredged him-
self with his whitest flour, whilst his gold-headed cane shone resplen-
dently from the best plate-powder for the occasion. The Prince
“graceſully recognised the consistent support afforded by the Morning
Post to the principles of legitimacy and good government.” This was to
be expected, as a trifling acknowledgment for past and present favours.
The Prince was taken into the editor's room, and minutely inspected
the ink-bottle through a microscope of peculiar power. The bottle
—the dregs very .#" i. all sorts of human animalculae—small,
crawling things that—as the cochineal insect dyes some red, and some
urple—turn white to black and black to white. The Prince was much
interested by the exhibition; taking particular notice of the ink-bottle
insect that, by its peculiar, crawling, traced, the letters that made u
“infidel” upon any political opponent...The illustrious Prince observed,
that “he thought that sort of thing” was gone out in England, but
smiled very blandly when begged, upon the evidence before him, to be
assured to the contrary. - -
The illustrious Prince, in acknowledgment of the devoted sincerity of
JENKINs to the “principles of legitimacy,” graciously bestowed upon
him the smallest Portugal onion.
THE PROPER TIME FOR PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.
The Humble Petition of the Newgate Weekly Press.
To the Commons in Parliament assembled.
WE, the undersigned, proprietors of the Sunday Drop, the Scaffold
Weekly News, the Old Bailey Enquirer, and the Life in Wewgate, news-
papers published on the morning of the Sabbath, and for the benefit of
that truly great, intelligent, and multitudinous British public which cannot
afford to waste its week-day time in the perusal of the daily newspapers,
humbly submit to your Honourable House the great evil which is done
by the present system of executions in this country, or rather by the
neglect of a simple means by which the performance of the last sentence
of the law might be rendered a thousand times more useful, terrible,
and public as an example to the nation, and a warning to evildoers.
The injustice which is done to ourselves by the present system of
º; on Mondays or, Tuesdays is manifest, and calls for a remedy
at the hands of an equitable British nation. For WHEREAs, upon the
tº." of a criminal, we notoriously spare no pains to furnish
the nation with his complete .."; employing literary gentlemen,
of thegant education and profo knowledge of human nature, to
examine his birthplace and parish register, to visit his parents, brothers,
uncles, and aunts, to procure intelligence of his early school days,
diseases which he has passed through, infantine (and more mature)
traits of character, &c. AND WHEREAs, we employ artists of eminence |b
to sketch his likeness as he appears at the police court, or views of the
farm-house or back kitchen where he has perpetrated the atrocious
deed. AND WHEREAs, regardless of expense, we entertain intelligence
within the prison walls with the male and female turnkeys, gaolers, and
other authorities, by whose information we are enabled to describe
every act and deed of the prisoner, the state of his health, sleep, and
digestion, the changes in his appearance, his conversation, his dress
and linen, the letters he writes, and the meals he takes—it is manifestly
hard, cruel, and unjust, that having thus carried a man, with intense
sympathy and watchfulness, through his examination, commitment,
trial, and condemnation into his condemned cell, we should there bé
unkindly separated from him, and that the daily prints should be
allowed to take him in hand.
In the case of the late MR. MANNING we ask, what energy, did the
latter-mentioned journals exhibit compared to our own? Did one of
the morning papers present pictures º: party and the partner of
his bed and crimes? Week aſter week, on the other hand, we kept the
British public acquainted with the minutest details regarding the
prisoner’s words, actions, and behaviour; we supplied our readers with
elegant pictures, we ransacked every corner for paticulars regarding
the very earliest lives of the beings about whom it was so important
that the people of England should know everything.
Now, it is manifest, that had the Judge but ordered MR. and MRs.
MANNING to be hanged on a Saturday morning, the ends of justice
would have been answered equally; the public would have been in-
duced to purchase many thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands more
of our papers than we have been enabled to sell; and the people, after
perusing our accounts (written under the glow and enthusiasm of the
moment) would have had wholesome and solemn subject for Sabbath
conversation;–whereas, by the lapse of days between Tuesday and
Saturday, the enthusiasm has had time to wear away; the glow has of
necessity cooled; or the reader has slaked his thirst for knowledge at
other and less authentic sources than those which we supply. We
have sown, but others. have reaped. We are, but permitted to glean
a few straws and a little chaff on a field which by right should be
Our own.
As then it is right that executions should be public, it is clear that
they should be as public as possible: to make them so public, it is
evident that the agency of the public prints is necessary; hence the
statesman will see that the more º: that are sold the better.
Let the weekly papers then, let trade and literature, let useful knowledge
and sound morality, be encouraged by Justice, and hanging on Saturdays
be henceforth the law of the land.
And your petitioners will ever pray, &c.

The Smashing Business.
SoME of the London linendrapers seem to have united to their own
Hsiness, as a regularly recognised branch, the business of smashing.
We saw the other day an advertisement in which a firm was described
without any circumlocution whatever, as “Linendrapers and Bank-
rupts.” It seems that in these days no large concern can go on for
|
any time without an Extensive Failure, or an Alarming Sacrifice, to
give it a fillip. In some houses it has even been in contemplation to
keep, a Bankrupt permanently on the premises, to superintend the
smashing branch, and preside at a counter specially set apart for
giving things away and going to ruin.
Encouragement to Young Beginners.
We have found a joke where we least expected it. As we are sure it
will surprise our readers as much as it did ourselves, we transcribe it
literally for their astonishment:-
... “‘The Golden Calf” is a most leaden bore.” . As a first effort, we call
it remarkably good, and we hope our witty contemporary will persevere,
and give us next week a joke in two syllables. We expect great things
after the above display, and we have great pleasure in congratulating
our new rival upon its successful début, for, without any jealousy, we
must say, that unless we had seen it with our own eyes, we never should
have thought it was in the Athenaeum.
A MESSAGE THAT SHOULD BE CAREFULLY DELIVERED.
We beg to remind LoRD CLARENDon of the Message that was once
addressed to the celebrated MR. FERGUsos, of illustrious memory. H
may, find it useful in the event of LoRD RöDEN’s party making Dublin
199 hol, to hold them. It will apply capitally to the Orangemen:-
“Gentlemen, you don't Lodge here.”

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
HOW THE CABINET HAS SLAIN TWELVE
THOUSAND.
WE at the same time wonder and blush at the apathy—the irreligion
of the English people...There is in Downing Street a knot of men who,
never since Political Billingsgate first drew foul breath for filthy words,
were approached for, certainly, their unheard of iniquities, never-
theless, they are rermitted, like chartered ogres, to feed upon the
rights, the affection, the piety, and, what is worse, the money of the
people !
Wine PETER THE HERMIT take his stand at the comer of Shoe
Lane, and preach destruction to the Whigs? . . -
Will no new SolomoN EAGLE, with a pan of lighted coals upon his
head, run up and down Parliament Street, calling—“Wo, wo to LoRD
JoBN RUsse LLP” -
But it is clear the people know not the fullness of their wrongs.
Like the nobleman who was so deftly decapitated, that he did not know
his head was off until he tried to shake it, John BULL is kicked,
robbed, desecrated, spat upon by the existing Government, and has no
notion of the extent of the criminality, the grandeur of the shame,
until called upon to move.
But the Morning Herald has declared that these iniquities shall no
longer be hidden. The Government is answerable, by its sins, for
.. of the 15,000 victims succumbed in London only to the
Cholera.
Here is the Herald's bill of mortality against the homicidal Whigs.
To being “unsteady, if not absolutely unfaithful, inits religious
course and conduct" - - - - - -
To “lavishing favour and kindness on the chief enemy of the
Church of God, the Roman apostaey” -
To “throwing much power, both in Ireland and
the hands of this Antichrist” . - - -
To “refusing or neglecting many opportunities of spreading the
knowledge of the Gospel, both at home and abroad” - -

Total increase of deaths in London only, in 1849, due to Ministers . 12,000
Astounding as it is, such is the sum worked º the trembling piety
of the Morning Herald. For, it asks, “after these offences” (as re-
cited above)—
“What wonder was it, that the same visitation which in 1832 destroyed only 3000 of
the inhabitants of the metropolis, was permitted, in 1849, to destroy 15,000?”
Thus, there have been 12,000 graves in London only, dug by the
present Government. The domestic agony, the domestic privation,
with all the many clinging ills that fall upon the living from the deaths
of husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, sons and *::::
brothers and sisters—all have been the demons’ work of HER
| MAJESTY's Ministers. Even the florin—as struck by the Whigs—has
been the root of evil, and with terrible growth, has come up a destruc-
| fire to their proper destroyers?

Nevertheless, is it not sustaining, º: to know that there is a

take godly account of the human sacrifices—booking them in letters of

healing thought is checked in its progress, when we remember that,
after all, there will be no impeachment—no axe—no block—no, not

solatory thought—a thought like “a bundle of myrrh.”
the gentle- ia: it was given to his intelligence, sharpened by his
charity, to discover in the policy of the QUEEN’s Ministers the sacrifice
of 12,000 souls. After all, this is something sweet for him to sleep upon.
The Lays of Modern Babylon.
FEARGUs O'ConnoR has been laying down, his life again. At the
meeting, of the National Conference in Dublin, he is reported to
have said:—
“But sooner than throw an apple of discord amongst them he would lay down
his life.”
We are told that the Prime Minister of England has 120 livings in
his gift, but these are nothing to the number that our friend FEARGUs
has, considering he gives away a fresh life every time he speaks in
public. FEARGUs's political life must be one of considerable vexation,
since he is always talking about a laying it. If Macaulay ever writes
the “Lays of Modern Babylon,” we hope he will not forget, the
countless Lays upon which FEARGus O'Connor has lavished the labour
of innumerable Lives.
WE WONDER IF TALENT WILL EVER BE RECOGNISED
WHEN a public building is opened by Royalty, you would imagine
that, if anybody was thought worthy of a title, the first person selected
would be the architect. But no such thing; he is the last person
f." thought of, if he is ever thought of at all. To bestow an
honour, however small, upon the architect, would be to recognise
|talent, and the recognition of talent in England would be such an
unusual thing, so contrary to all precedents, that we almost think
the Bank would stop payment if the innovation, were to be attempted.
|. Lord Mayors have been knighted and baronetted before, and
consequently may be again, without any national convulsion resulting
from it. Therefore, when a public building is inaugurated by the foot
º: Royalty, it is always the Lord Mayor who engrosses the entire
| honour.
It was thus when the Royal Exchange was opened; it is so
now with the Coal Exchange. In both instances the Lord Mayors
}: been remembered, in both instances have the architects been
orgotten.
We do not mean to insinuate that the Lord Mayors were not well
deserving of the titles that were conferred upon them. On the con-
of it, but, at the same time, we think there are others who have earned
it fully as much as they. Surely the men who by their talents raise
two noble edifices deserve the same honour as the men who by their
accidental position merely show Royalty over them?
It would be just as absurd if the QUEEN, when she goes to hear
MacREApy, were to knight the gentleman who lights her to the Royal
box; or if PRINCE ALBERT, at the completion of the Tubular Menai
Bridge, were to make a Baronet of the Railway Director, or the Stoker
that expresses him down to the spot.
MECHANICAL
trary, they have earned the Royal compliment, and we wish them joy
|
WE have had accounts of an artificial Leech, which draws twice the |
blood of its natural brother in half the time. The Government, we
believe, entertain the motion of starting a mechanical Tax-gatherer on
the same principle, which won't take an answer, and will not be affected
by the abuse that sometimes disarms or terrifies the unfortunate men
now employed in the disagreeable duty of bleeding John Bull.
There is a good opening, it seems to us, for a Mechanical Cat, con:
structed exclusively to catch mice. The destructive habits of the real
domestic Cat are well known, and it is not easy to calculate the number
of legs of mutton, fowls, remains of cold joints, pounds of, butter,and
pints of milk that one Cat will eat, exclusive of empty bottles, kitchen-
|stuff, and breakage, , -

keeper can indulge in, from those depraved habits of the real animal

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT.
ONCE upon a time, when the Birds and the Beasts had a
Parliament, there was waged between them a fierce conflict, in
which the former contended for Free Trade and Progress, and
the latter for Protection and Toryism. For a long while the
event of the contest was doubtful, and the Bat, taking advan-
tage of his ambiguous nature, kept aloof. At length, when
the Birds seemed to prevail, the Bat joined their forces, and
became active in debate; but a rally being made by the Beasts
which looked likely to be successful, he went over to them ;
yet, after all, he was found at the end of the day among the
ranks of the losing party. At last the Bat's policy has come
to be condemned by both parties, so that, being acknowledged
by neither, and therefore deprived of influence in the House,
he had better shuffle off as he best can, and hide his diminished
head in holes and corners, never venturing to come out except
in the obscurity of an Agricultural meeting.
Excitement for Slaves.
It is stated by the Boston Emancipator that an inquest being held
recently on the body of a female slave whipped to death by her master,
a jury of planters returned the following complaisant and considerate
verdict—“Died of apoplexy, brought on by excitement.”
The Yankee jury omitted to notice the important fact, that the
cruelly murdered victim who thus died of excitement was lashed up to
it by her master.

PUNCH'S LAW REPORTS.
The Great Ham Case, REGINA v. GALLEARs.
HAVING observed an utter absence of Reason in some of the Law
reports, it has struck us that Rhyme may be employed as an efficient
substitute. We have therefore instructed our Attorney-General, M.R.
BRIEFless, to report for us the Great Ham Case, which came of the
other day in the Exchequer Chamber, when the Court sat in error,
and the learned Counsel argued in total error for at least half-an-hour.
The Case it was this—There was tried at the Sessions
A prisoner, guilty of divers transgressions,
And wishing at last for a relishing cram,
His career he had finished by stealing a ham.
At the trial objection was made—that the joint -
Had been badly described—and reserved was the point.
For the prisoner; HENNIKER rose in his place
To contend the Fº were bad on their face.
He urged “that the article now in dispute
Had been very likely a bit of a brute,
An animal, ferae naturae, whose hocks
Had been made into ham. (See the QUEEN cersus Cox),
Where some eggs had been stolen, and there 'twas laid down,
The indictment was bad on the i. of the Crown,
Because of the eggs ’twas not plainly averr'd
Whether those of a crocodile, adder, or bird.”
Per Pollock, Chief Baron: “The question one begs,
In refusing to recognise eggs, Sir, as eggs;
I’m convinced such objection could never be made
As to hold that an egg was improperly laid.”
Per PATTEson, Justice: “The point I see well,
For the whole of the argument lies in a shell;
But suppose with the eggs there had been an assault,
Will you venture to if. that justice must halt
If the egg’s undescribed? on your law I can’t flatter ye;
To call it an egg is sufficient in battery.”
Per PLATT, Puisne Baron : “Suppose for a change,
An epicure fancies a dish somewhat strange,
And orders the ham of a fox or a rat,
There’d then be a property surely in that ?”
MR. HENNIKER humbly submitted that dogs,
Whom he ventured to couple, in this case, with hogs,
(He made no reflection, and wished not to pass any),
Had become very recently subjects of larceny.
Per PLATT.: “But the law, Sir, had always its eye
Qn a toad in the hole, or a dog in a pie.”
The learned Chief Baron conferred with the judges,
Who declared the objection the poorest of fudges.
The pris’ner's conviction accordingly stood;
The ham and indictment were both pronounced good.
A GOOD PRICE FOR A GOOD ARTICLE.
WE are always told that “the English Constitution is the envy and
admiration of the world.”. We do not doubt this; we may be pro-
foundly admired, we may be deeply envied by every nation; but the
question is, if we do not pay a little dearly for this universal homage.
The cost for it is 45s. per º large sum to pay in taxes every year
to be envied and admired. It is said that we never can pay too much
for a good thing; and, according to this, the British Constitution
ought to be the very best of its kind, considering the large price that
“º Englishman is called upon to give for it. -
We thould be very sorry for England to lose this “envy and admi-
ration of the world.” It is a pleasant thing for an Englishman to
know that the entire population of the universe is looking at the
British Constitution with the water in its mouth; but we cannot help
thinking that we pay somewhat heavily for this water-rate, when it is
laid on at a cost of 45s. per head. Envy and admiration are at all
times expensive luxuries. "We have known many a man ruin himself
in the vain endeavour to procure them. Millions have been spent
upon their purchase; and at the very moment when a parvenu has
thought he has succeeded in obtaining the envy and admiration of his
fellow-creatures, he has been compelled to walk through the Court.
England must take care that she is not ruined in the same way. The
very goodness of her Constitution may be the death of her.
. After all, we suspect that this “envy and admiration of the world”
Is aº deal of Qur, own fabrication. The English Constitution may
be admired, as undoubtedly it deserves to be; but the “envy.” is quite
another thing. , What nation is likely to envy a Constitution that
requires, upwards of £59,000,000 every year to keep it in repair! Why,
such a Constitution, enviablé as it may be, would be the annihilation
of any other country but England. We do not generally envy the man
that has a millstone round his neck.
For instance, it is very doubtful whether the Russian or the American
envies the Englishman so much. The Russian pays for his Consti-
tution 9s. 9d. a year, and the American only 9s. 7d., and the Constitution
of the latter is not such a bad Constitution either. Is it likely that
|. w | envy a thing that costs nearly five times as much as they have
O pay
The Fº is naturally proud of his Constitution, and takes a
national pleasure in the “envy and admiration” (whether real or ima-
ginary) which the world honours it with, but we think he would like his
Jonstitution all the more if he had somewhat less to pay for it. Cannot
we be envied and admired under 45s, a year?
EXTRACT FROM THE LETTER OF A GENTLEMAN
THE SERVICE OF THE EMPEROR SOULOUQUE.
# # sk + * *
THE blood of African kings which flows in my veins having
rendered me an object of unjust persecution in my native country of
New Orleans, I resolved to come to Port-au-Prince, and try my fortune
there. I had the good fortune to please HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNEss
PRINCE BENBow, Lord High Admiral, for whom I made the tight
embroidered pantaloons of his office, and, have since been in consider-
able favour among the Court and nobility, as Court and fashionable
tailor. The coronation of the Emperor enabled me to exhibit my skill;
I invented a robe for the Lord Chancellor of the Empire, and a coatee
for the General Officers, which have been greatly admired, and I hope
will bear a comparison with the first efforts of European, or even
Broadway, artists.
The Court is at this moment in mourning. Mourning here, I need
not tell you, is not black, but a becoming light pink; that of the Royal
and Imperial family is yellow. The Imperial House is at present en deuil
for the seventy-sixth wife of KING Bosh, of the Niger, who had died
of a superfluity of rum, to the grief of her Royal consort.
White men are tolerated at Port-au-Prince, though of course not
admitted into society. At Church and the Theatre places are set apart
for them : and the domestics of their Majesties are selected from this
class of human beings. They are treated generally not unkindly, but
the hot blood of the African noblesse is proverbial, and the poor devils
occasionally suffer from this irascibility. I remonstrated the other day
with HIs HIGHNEss. FIELD MARSHAL PRINCE PIERRQT, who was about
to whip an Oxford Gentleman employed as tutor to his two sons; and
had him tied up to a cocoa-nut tree, when I happily succeeded in
diverting the Prince from his intention.
At dinner, his Majesty is waited upon by six English footmen in
the Imperial livery of nankeen, laced with blue galloon. They were
selected from among the largest of their class in England; but not being
here allowed to wear stockings, their calves have a very different
appearance to that of their brethren in their native country. When
the Emperor is pleased, or has had enough, he dabs a portion of the
meat from his own plate into the mouth of the Field-Marshal, Prince,
or Grand Dignitary of the Empire, sitting next to him. When angry,
his Majesty flings his dish or his cup at the heads of the footmen in
attendance. It is fine to see the unflinching courage with which they
receive these marks of the Imperial discontent.
The cook, who has been created DUKE of CABoosia, is an artist
from an English man-of-war. . He, and the dancing-master of the
Imperial family, are of pure African blood : a Frenchman previously
acted in both capacities; but having made love to several of the
princesses, he was dismissed, and blown from the mouth of a 24-
pounder off Fort Banjo.
The dining hall is richly decorated with works of art. On the North
side of the wall there is a fine picture of Edward THE BLACK PRINCE
serving KING John of France at supper, and the BLACK PRINCE is a
fine likeness of His IMPERIAL HIGHNess THE GRAND DUKE BoBo, the
eldest son of the Emperor.
CAESAR falling at Pom PEY’s Statue is another fine work in the grand
hall. CESAR is a fine mulatto, and Pompey a mandingo of the purest
national colour.—Both figures are considered very fine, 'specially
Pom PEY’s.
The Empress and daughters sate for the beautiful picture of CLEQ-
PATRA sailing down the Nile, and the º Queen is represented,
as History has painted her indeed, of the most brilliant Nubian jet.
The two pages are the two youngest sons of the Empress, THEIR IM-
PERIAL HIGHNEsses PRINCE DAY and PRINCE MARTIN.
But I must lay down my pen and resume my scissors: an order
comes from his Majesty for a jacket and pantaloons for a Court
Ball: he says he will have epaulets on the latter—to hear is to obey.
Farewell.

EveRYBoDY knows that Mr. Punch is a mortal enemy to Jack
KETCH. We need not, therefore, say that we cordially approve of the
object of the anti-capital-punishment meeting which was held on
Monday last week at }. Bridge House Hotel, Southwark. We wish
we could affirm the like of all that was uttered at that assembly;
wherein certain opponents of the halter most unfortunately exemplified
the proverbial consequences of being allowed plenty of rope. Remarking
on whom, says our old friend, the Morning Post:-
“Then there was a reverend, but not very reverent gentleman, who funnily related
how Moses committed murder, and ‘looked round to see that there was no policeman
near’—a joke which told with such amazing effect on the risible faculties of the
audience that we have no doubt the worthy parson, encouraged by this essay, is even
now agonizingly labouring at a Comic Pentateuch, to be published in due time at the
Office, and likely, we should think, to prove quite as amusing as any of the
dreary series of works bearing that epithet.”
MR. J.ENKINs is mistaken in his implied assertion that the Punch
Office is a mart for blasphemous publications. We would thank him
to point out any joke, or attempt at a joke, in reference to religion or

THE PERILS OF PENMANSHIP.
THose persons who do not happen to be among the most amiable or
straightforward in the world should be very careful what, when, and
where they write, for a new profession has just started up, consisting
of the alleged art of reading the character in the handwriting. We
think we can guess a few of the leading rules, which we beg leave to
promulgate for the benefit of those who would like to know the sort of
persons they are corresponding with. - -
A running-hand to an acceptance may indicate a disposition on the
part of the acceptor to run away from his liability. A cramped-hand
from a creditor demanding payment of a debt shows that he will require
very stiff interest if he grants time; and a smeared signature shows
that the writer has no objection to a blot on his name, while if a man
asking to borrow, money fails to unite his O, it is certain he is not
likely to bring matters round very easily.
COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS–COURVOISIER—
AND THE “EXAMINER.”
EEP your peace nine years.” CoM-
MISSIONER PHILLIPs, the counsel
and legal confidant of Courvoisi ER,
has acted on the Horatian precept.
Wherefore, for his own quiet, did
he not enlarge the term of silence
Had he a strange, morbid craving
for public sympathy even though it
should only endure some few fleet-
ing days P Did he wish, at any
future price, to stand cleansed, and
sweetened to the world's eye and
nostril on the 20th of Nov. 1849,-
tven though, on the 24th of the same
month, he should be re-dipped in
the Eraminer's ink-bottle, to come
forth darker than ever ? But so it
is. In the weariness and wayward-
ness of common life, a man is apt
to pay any cost for a fleeting en-
joyment—a new pleasure. Sweet
is a spotless name, though fleeting
its spotlessness:
“Ev’n as the snow-flake in the river,
A moment white, then gone for ever.”
MR. CHARLEs PHILLIPs, conjured by the officious afficion of MR.
SAMUEL WARREN, “writes to the Times.” Here it is CHARLEs who
may now ask of SAMUEL–“Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me
up P” With, however, an uneasy doubt of the future, the CoM.
MissionER declares that he will make no further reply. No damaging
rejoinder shall twit from him another word. No matter what provo.
cation, the Brazen Head will not speak again. This, the concluding
sentence of MR. PHILLIPs's letter, is the only saving piece of prudence
in the whole sinuous, tape-worm-like epistle. -
MR. PHILLIPs breaks “the contemptuous silence” of nine years to
"notice inventions too abominable he had hoped for any honest man to
have believed.” MR. PHILLIPs has read his three hours' speech at
Courvoisiek's trial reported in the Times, and accepts its fidelity. In
the teeth of this avowal, he has still enough of his old Old Bailey courage
left to answer as below:—
Mr. Phrillips, in the Times of 1849. MR. PHILLIPs in the Times of 1840.
I am accused, secondly, of having “ap- It was not his business to prove who did

this deed of darkness.-aimes Ireport of
Trial, June 22nd, 1840.
CHARLEs PHILLIPs, hired counsel of the murderer—upon the mur-
derer's own confession—knows his guilt, and yet, in his defence, with
“well-painted passion,” dares to mouth “THE OMNIscIENT God,” as
alone knowing the criminal. This is in 1840; and in 1849, the Cow.
MISSIONER—with his memory newly refreshed by careful perusal of his
speech, His horror-stricken at the i. of an “appeal to Heayen”
in justification of the innocence of a known assassin. Could he so
outrage Heaven, and not expect to be answered by Heaven's lightning?

speech, and MR, PHILLIPs's contrasted letter—may judge between the
tº: of his oratory, and the serenity of his expectations.

MR. PHILLIPs suffered an awful night preceding the day upon which
he did his best to terrify a jury by conjuring to their fears the probabi-
lity of being haunted by the ghost of a gibbet-murdered man—that
man at the time ºf in the conscious eye of the counsel, dyed
from head to foot in the Blood of his sleeping victim
What a weight must have been lifted from the heart of MR. PHILLIps
when the Jury-contemptuous of his threats—returned the verdict,
“Guilty.” e read what the over-wrought counsel suffered the
previous night, “ſevered and horror-stricken,” scarcely slumbering for
a moment, no doubt agonised as the honorarium—Courvoisier's gold—
was burning in the legal vitals' Thus was he racked and tortured
between his duty and his fears. What, then, would have been the
counsel's horror, what the effect of his remorse, acting upon a mind of
such exquisite sensibility—had his disturbing oratory frightened the
Jury into an acquittal, had the eloquence of the ſeverish and horror-
stricken, counsel caused Newgate door to turn upon a golden hinge,
letting slip the man-tiger, Courvoisier, for, it might be, another feast
of blood | º was it for the future peace of the counsel, that the
counsel was saved from the impious rant of his own genius—from the
awful audacity of his own silver-hung tongue.
MR. PHILLIPs denies that—after the confession of Courvoisier—
he sought to asperse, the character of others. The following is from
his defence in the Times—from the report which he accepts as alto-
gether ſaithful:—
. . . His learned friend demanded, who murdered Lord W.M. Russell? he (MR.P.)
was not bound to show that ; but he had a right to know who placed the bloody gloves in the
prisoner's trunk between the 6th and 14th of May, when the prisoner had been already
three days in gaol P Had there not been practices here? “Thus bad begins, but worse
remains behind.” This man, it was evidently determined, should be made the victim of
some foul contrivance. . . . Some villains must have been at work here to provide
proofs of guilt against the prisoner, and endeavour to make the jury instrumental in
rendering him the victim, not of his own guilt, but of their own machinations.
He wished not to asperse the female servants. God forbid, &c. &c. It was not at all
necessary to his case to do so. . . . . . The prisoner had seen his master retire to
his peaceful bed, and was alarmed in the morning by the housemaid, who was up before
him, with a cry of robbery, and some dark, mysterious suggestion of murder. “Let us
go," said she, “and see where my Lord is.” He did confess that that expression struck
him as extraordinary. If she had said, “Let us go and tell my Lord that the house is
plundered,” that would have been natural; but why should she suspect that anything
had happened to his Lordship? She saw her fellow-servant safe, no taint of blood about
the house, and where did she expect to find her master? Why, in his -room, to be
sure. What was there to lead to a suspicion that he was hurt? Counvoisier, was safe,
the cook was safe, and why should she suspect that her master was not safe too?—
Times, June 22nd, 1840.
LoRD BRough AM (as quoted in the Eraminer) has declared that
“An advocate, by the sacred duty which he owes his client, knows, in the discharge
of that office, but one person in the world, that client AND NoNE other. To save that
client by all expedient means,—to protect that client at all hasºrds and costs to all others,
and among others to himself—is the highest and most unquestioned of his duties; and
he must not regard the alarm, the suffering, the torment, the destruction, which he may bring
upon any other."
According to this soul-sustaining principle, CHARLEs PHILLIPs, when
he did his worst against the innocent witnesses, like ToM THUMB, “did
his duty, and he did no more.” Is, however, the opinion of LORD
BROUGHAM ample and whole enough to shelter a man against the
opinion of all truthful society? Let MR. PHILLIPs find what comfort
he may in the answer.
We have quoted enough of PHILLIps v. PHILLIPs, and the reader
* the evidence in significant black and white. As for MR. SAMUEL
ARREN, whose anxiety provoked the unfortunate Letter, to the
Times, he no doubt meant well for his friend, and must not, suffer
remorse, however amiable in its cause, to take too ºf hold upon
himſ We repeat it. He meant well; so did the bear that, to kill a
fly upon his sleeping master, killed the man outright. -

PHILLIps; to pour balm into his wounds; to anoint his slandered
head; to sluice him with rose-water—indeed, to, make him smell all
over Araby, Very pleasant was it to observe this readiness on the
part of the press to remedy the evil it sometimes inflicts. Thus, a bit

MR. CHARLEs PHILLIPs was º Fº and we somewhat
rejoiced at such healing goodness. ell, MR. PHILLIPs is answered

all by his motion, and those º (at least at the time we write)
most eloquent in sympathy with his self-acquittal make nº acknow-
ledgment of the wrong suffered by the journalist assailed. The Daily
Neºs is certainly an exception, doing justice to the Eraminer, and the
Post observes—
“The defence set up by Mr. PHILLIps, which appeared to be in substance satisfactory;
has no longer that appearance in our eyes. The rejoinder of the Examiner, we cannot
but regard as one of the most complete and crushing pieces of personal criticism that
we have ever read.”
Wherefore such gushing sympathy (towards the Qld Bailey practi.
tioner, and such grudging acknowledgment of the claims of a journal,
whose º and progress are associated with the highest moral
courage and the best dignity of the English press? What the social
value of all the Old Bailey practice of MR. PHILLIPs, compared with an
hour of LEIGH HUNT* What Mr. PHILLIPs's forty years' chequered
pleading at the bar, against the Examiner's forty years' pleading for
truth and liberty to the world? The Scotsman well says, as r

that we do not respect ourselves.”
MR. PHILLIps is one in authority. We are sorry ſor it. He-the
defender of the confessed Courvoisie R and the justifier of a wrongful
defence—sits in judgment upon the imprudent and the unfortunate. A
word of his falls crushingly upon the improvident and the helpless.

THE LAST SQUEAK OF SMITHFIELD.
THE fashionable cry, now-a-days, is for compensation. We
have already told our readers how the Palace Court gentlemen are
counting up their writs with the view of demanding compensation
from Parliament next session for the loss of every one of them.

we do not see how it can possibly be refused to the gentlemen ot

inclined, much as we are averse to the humbug of compensation,
to say, in this instance, “Compensate both.” But we are de;

THE RETURN OF THE SWANHOPPER.
How heavily, how lazily, we drag upon the Thames!
The water is all sewage, which now our brave barge stems;
In, our bow the waves are steaming, with vapours foul and dank,
Like reptiles in whose deadly veins the blood is creeping rank.
The river seems to speak our sway; strange matters round us glide,
Strange things come up to sicken us, the masters of the tide;
In our wake, disgusted, hissing, follows even our own Swan,
Oh, proud must be our Alderman and Cor-po-ra-ti-on!
Oh! would I were our Alderman, to govern o'er my ward,
In some few years to reach the Chair, and then be called my LoRD ;
I’d shout to yonder swan, that follows in our lee,
“Some day, my bird, I’ll purify the river Thames for thee!”
Qh 1, would I were our Alderman—though he looks queer to-day—
With several Common-Councilmen his orders to obey
Who'll vote for him and Smithfield, for shambles, fifth, and gore,
And dine with him off turtle-soup whene'er we reach the shore.
Still queerer looked our Alderman, and queerer as we crept,
Yet still he sipped his cold-without, unless 'twas when he slept;
Then he peeped out on the water, and declared that he could see
Two Swans—although there was but one—that followed in our lee.
He woke but for a moment—for soon the drowsy god
Again his eyelids stealing, again he ’gan to mod;
Sleep gave dulness to his visage, it gave labour to his breath,
And he looked like some prize animal full fattened up for death.
A knowing wink and whisper passed round us where we lay,
For we saw our jolly Alderman too well had soaked his clay;
So, for air, on deck we bore him, when overboard rolled he,
And we heard a hiss and flutter in the water on our lee.
All might we scrubbed his Yº...? who, tumbling in his snooze,
Head over ears had soused himself in foul and fetid ooze:
And ever from that moment he resolved the Thames should be
Made wholesome for the creature that had followed in our lee.
THE DUEL-ITY OF THE FRENCH MIND.
DUELs seem to be quite the order of the day, in the Assemblée
Nationale. If they go on increasing at their present rate, France wi

by Ayes and Noes, but by Swords and Pistols. As two refractory
members leave the Tribune, the President will call out, “Cafè et Pis-

in the Bois de Boulogne, and order the necessary breakfasts aſter they
have seen that the nation's honour has been fully satisfied. What an
honourable nation France ought to be, considering its representatives
are continually fighting to prove that they are men of honour! Every
representative must be satisfied on this point—in fact, what opponent

or a sword .
Little THIERs has distinguished himself on this new political ground|
in a most satisfactory manner. His duels are almost as numerous as
his errors in his “Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire.” He accepts
cartels as freely as if they were cartes d'invitation for a champagne
party; and boasts that, often as he has been called out, he has never
met with the Frenchman yet who was his match. . The fact is, he is so
small that it is no such an easy thing to hit him. One fastidious
member refused to fight with a man who, he said, was so far beneath
him, unless Monsieur THIERs was put on a beer-barrel.
This French P. of duelling is growing to such an extent, that
the 25 francs, allowed to each representative will be barely sufficient
to pay his shot. It is j to increase it to 50 francs, with an
ounce of powder per diem.
There is a great coolness at present between the civil and military
ies in the chamber, if there can be any of the former in a house that
is perpetually quarrelling. But the civil men will not fight with the
military men, because, they say, the chances are not equal. The militaires
are perfect in their sword and pistol exercises, but the hommes de plume
cannot plume themselves, upon any such proficiency. To remedy this
inequality, which might lead to the annihilation of all the Editors of
France, it is recommended by the Minister of War to erect barracks in
the neighbourhood of the Assemblée, where members can be instructed
in those accomplishments that are so indispensable to the education of
a perfect gentleman. Lessons will be given, at the lowest charges, by

encourage the sport and steady the aim of the Montagnards, and similar
laster likenesses, only much larger, of VICTOR Hugo, Jules FAvRE,
AVAIGNAc, and PIERRE BUQNAPARTE (the latter in carton de Pierre),
will be held out as tempting targets for the amusement of the
Legitimists. Thus, pleasure and business will be beautifully combined
in the same building.
It is frightful to contemplate what will be the state of things when -
the members are equally skilful... The Kilkenny cats will be kittens
to them, for it must end in their all shooting one another, till only one
member will be left in the House, and that one will, of course, be none
other than Mons|EUR THIERs. Is there no CLYTEMNESTRA in France

REVIVAL OF THE MENDICANT TRADE.
THE sudden setting-in of the cold weather gave a wonderful impetus
to the begging trade, and there was a brisk demand for small children.
who fetched, during the frost, at least fourpence a-head above the
average. The demand was considerable for infants accustomed to the
trade, and warranted to continue crying for an hour at a pinch—it
being an ascertained fact that all those who, at a pinch from the osten.
sible parent, can burst out into a good continuous fit of bellowing, will
supply the source of a roaring trade to the borrower. Five-year-olders,
in pairs to resemble twins, always fetch a high price in wet or frosty
weather; and opium, which, during the summer, is literally a drug in
the mendicant's market, has lately been much sought after. There has
been also a fearful inundation of the gardening trade, on the part of
those who rush into it at this season, for the purpose of being imme-
diately frozen out again. Clean white aprons and widows’ weeds were
done at improved rates, and the public will be done at the usual rate,
unless care is taken of its interests.

Ministry (which has already been nicknamed “Le Ministère de Tous tes
Talents”) will last longer than any other, as there will be an unity and
£ºmpactness about it which will be the safest guarantees of its indivisi-
bility. We need not mention that, in the present state of things, the

WHAT’S THE ROW AT DRURY LANE p
THE great feature at the concerts
of that Mont Blanc of Music, the
Mons. JULLIEN, has been a com-
position called the Row Polka,
At first, in our simplicity, we sup-
osed it to be a Polka on the
avourite air of, “Row, brothers,
row,” but on going to hear what
the Row really was at Drury
Lane, we found it to consist of a
variety of airs, ending in a regular
breeze, and a tremendous Row-de-
dow on all the drums in the
orchestra.
The Mons, never composes a
piece of music without going into
the scenes he describes; and, as
he went through, Switzerland, in:
stead of perambulating Smithfield
to get hold of the true Ran:
Paches for the Swiss Quadrille, it
is most probable that he got him-
self into a regular row before he commenced the composition of the
Row Polka. His description of it in his bill is not quite so graphic as
most of the productions of the Mons...and we therefore give him the
benefit of our own powers of high colouring, as a hint for future
programmes.
THE ROW QUADRILLES.
Ringing of the street-door bells. Distant knocking at the doors,
and wrenching off of the knockers. Far off is heard the lowlowing of the
young calves, whose well-known cry of Lul-li-e-te has such an effect on
the imaginations of the police, that they come down in, shoals, fas-
cinated by the sound, and follow the plaintive yoices in all directions.
The distant tramp of the Inspector is heard beating time upon the
beat; the watch-fires of the baked potato cans are lighted up, and the
cry of “all hot” is heard sº diminuendo and crescendo, until it
is lost in the distance. Suddenly the cans are overturned, Policeman
A. is brought to the ground with a roulade on. A flat, and the
Quadrille terminates with a general row, introducing several staves
of music, in every one of which the policemen's stayes are dominant.
There are already imitations of the “Row, Polka” in every direction,
and as the plagiarists will require some cheap mode of carrying out
their piratical design, we recommend them the shovel, poker, tongs and
saucepan, as easy substitutes_for the trombones, triangles, bassoons,
and ophicleides of the Mons. Julien's Orchestra.
HAYNAu’s FASHIONS FOR LADIES.

DEEP ran the river and wide, and various the scenes that it traversed;
High from its spring in the Cotswolds, by cloisters of clerical Oxford,
Under the round tower of Windsor, and on through the locks, past the
sedges,
Till by the steamers at Richmond its holiday waters were ſurrowed,
Pure and pellucid at starting, but darker and dirtier growing,
Till by the Six Bells at Putney, Old Thames washed his face for the
last time.
Foul were his habits thenceſorward, and mighty unsav'ry his feeding;
Gas-water tippled he freely, nor scrupled to linger at bone-works;
Mopped up whole oceans of sewage, with dye-stuff and waste of
distillers;
Made astrong stock for his soup out of dead cats and dogs, and such offal,
Till the last thing in the world that his water was fit for was drinking.
Slow by the marge of these waters, the day of a corporate dinner,
Wandered the city NARCIssus, of appetite whetting the edges,
Till on a damaged retort, on the wharf of the great Phoenix gas-works,
Breathing the sweets of a sewer, he sat himself down to repose him.
O'er his white waistcoat his plump hands he folded, and, head upon
bosom,
There yielded up his great mind to the glory of turtle and ven’son,
Big with the sense of his blessings, an emblem of city contentment.

THE SAD FATE OF THE CIVIC NARC ISSUS.
A Herametrical Sketch, slightly altered from Ovid's Metamorphoses, lib. iii.
There, while he thought about nothing but dinner, he stooped o'er the
waters,
And as he looked in the depths of their stagnancy saw his own
image; |
Equally muddy the stream and his face, with as little announcement
What might be lying perdu at the bottom of man or of river:
Both man and river alike unfit for the function of cleansing,
Both richly freighted with wealth, but diffusing a scant share of blessing;
Both with the power of conveying to homes and to hearts round about
them,
Cleanliness, comfort, and health, but both with that power misdirected.
Long lay the city NARcissus, and wondered, and loved what he
looked on,<-
That number one, which deserves to be chalked up, wherever in council,

THE SKATING SEASON.
SKATING was in full force last week, in the streets, if not in the
Parks. Horses are beginning to skate better than men, and it stands
to reason that they should, considering the long practice they have had
| on the wood pavement. We noticed many a horse slide on his four feet
in a style that would have moved the heart of a charity boy with envy.
How one jaded BUCEPHALUs did go along, to be sure! We thought he
never would stop. There he kept slipping away for yards, dragging the
unfortunate cab after him, as if it were no more weight than his own
tail, chasséing now to the right, now to the left, then balancéing
with an apple stall, and after that, quietly doing the chassez croissez
round the crossing sweeper, till he fell as much from fatigue as from
the slipperiness of the ice, and sat himself on the wood pavement, coolly
waiting for the applause of the audience. . The £º of that poor
octogenarian, horse was something wonderful. ...We never, witnessed
such scientific skating, and we have come to the conclusion, that a
horse has a great º over man with a pair of skates, inasmuch
as he can balance, himself much better on four feet, than we can on
two. It is rather degrading, but strictly true.
By-the-bye a great novelty can be introduced into the Prºphète next
year. , Why not do the Quadrille, des Patineurs in the skating scene
with horses instead of men? A little wood pavement could easily be
laid down; and a few cabs would not cost much if hired by the hour.
The horse we have mentioned above, would be well worth his bushel of
oats per night. He would clear the stage in a minute, and have
innumerable bouquets of , cabbages and wreaths of , carrots thrown
to him every evening. His address is, No. 1 on the Cabstand on
the wood pavement opposite, the Pantheon in Oxford Street. He
may be found going through his exercises in the most saltatory and
lively manner, at any time that the ligneous pavement has been in
ice over might. He answers to the names of CERITO and DADDY-
LONGLEGS.
We must inform such of our readers as are fond of a little Skating,
that it is better fun to enjoy the sport out of a cab, than in one; for if
}. expect much enjoyment inside a spirited HANSoM, with the horse's
eels flying up every minute in your face, we are afraid you will only be
ultimately thrown out in your expectations.

whatever provisions may exist for the relief of an estate from it:...in-
cumbrances. He intends laying before, Parliament a series of Bills,
including washing bills, tailor's †. and bills of exchange, which he
has read a . and third time, and which form the encumbrances
from which he desires that the DuNUF estate may be relieved. The

THE GREAT WASH.
A GREAT deal of abuse is lavished upon the Corporation in the City,
and Boards of Guardians elsewhere, for their opposition or indifference
to measures of cleanliness.
Are these ready abusers married men living in small, houses? Do
they know the misery of a “Great Wash,” when an avalanche of dirty
linen descends upon the whole establishment, and swamps everything
like comfort, till it is washed—with often-repeated painful ringing up
of servant-maids in the dark, and untimely raps at the door of extra-
neous washerwomen, gin-loving, consumers of cold meat, gossip-given;
then dried, with cost of horrible choke-damp and linen steam, and a
sense of present smother, and future fire-contingencies. Then got up,
with much, recourse to patent mangles, and infinite scorchings, of
ironing blankets, whereof also is a smell, intolerable to men, and im-
pelling husbands into infinite space and the outer bachelor world, far
from cold-mutton make-shift dinners, and other, such like washing
miseries, whereof every husband's memory is too full for eyen speak-
ing: so that, upon the whole, he would rather drop the veil of night
and darkness thereupon.
. But to us, thinking of the wretchedness of a “Great Wash,” there
is unspeakable sympathy for poor, ... Aldermen and
Guardians, having indeed, as for themselves, no intense, horror of dirt,
and with olfactories subdued to what they work in, in their resistance
to the greatest of all washes—the wash of our cities and towns, where
the foul habits of generations, are heaped up for, CHADwick knows
what, Sanitary Bath and Wash-house system to deal, upon. Truly a
Great Wash and great discomfort must needs come of it!

Or rubicund with healthful glow.

Yes—chalk is in a milkman's line,
And with his business tallies well.

THE FOG SCREAMER.
AN instrument with the quaint title of the Fog Screamer has just
been invented, for the purpose of enabling *} to scream in a fog,
and to be heard on all sides at six miles' distance. The inconvenience of
this seems to be, that, when the instrument is used as a warming of
danger, it will be impossible to say whether the danger is six miles off
or quite imminent. There will, indeed, be something quite stunning in
the jºr a November fog, if the use of the Screamer should become
general.

To alarm a whole neighbourhood for six miles round, in order to
prevent a collision between a couple of cabs, seems very like stunning
a man, and depriving him of all his senses at once, as a preventive against
toothache. A modification of the Fog Screamer might, we think, be
tried at the Vernon Gallery, where the constant collisions among the
visitors lead to much inconvenience.
Ocular Demonstration.
A REVIEw says, “MR. HERBERT's Lear in the House of Lords is
most º marked, and stands out far beyond all the rest.” We do
not doubt this, but it strikes us it will be very unpleasant to HER
MAJEsty, whenever, she appears in Parliament, to have MR.HERBERT's
Lear staring her full in the face. It will be very disrespectful, and we
must object to any such ad captandum manner of catching the royal eye
by means of a Lear. We hope that in the presence of HER MAJESTY a
curtain will be always drawn over it. We ask if a Leer is exactly the
sight for a QUEEN.
The Lads for California.
To CHANCERY LAWYERS, ATTORNIES OF LANDED GEN-
TLEMEN, STEWARDS of Estates, and TREASURERS of Companies and

California, not less for their own benefit than for that of others. They may be assured
of finding Californian diggings even more lucrative than home pickings. It must be
recollected that they possess peculiar facilities for separating the precious metal from
its accompanying impurities. For this purpose, they will require neither sieve nor
cradle; they will need only to pass the auriferous earth through their hands, and
assuredly i. the gold in it will stick to their fingers.

THE HEROES OF THE NORTH POLE.
THE gallant fellows who manned the Enterprise and Investigator have
been paid off. Having, fulfilled their heroic service, with most heroic
endurance, most unflinching spirit; having,borne and confronted the
terrors of Arctic winters, they are paid their wages, and discharged.
Very right. The Lords of the Admiralty would, when necessary to
dismiss them, pay their butlers, their footmen (who had grown ripe and
sleek in the pantry and hall), their wages and dismiss them, and no fur-
ther ceremony needed. But, we put it to their Lordships, ought. Blue-
jacket Jack from the North Pole to be turned off five liveried joint
Has the sailor's service been of no more account than the plate-cleaning
of the menial? Is there nothing national, nothing heroic in the highest
sense of human enterprise and endurance, in the service of the crews
returned from a world of ice—from the very region of dismay and
horror, where nothing but their own bold hearts gave hope and courage
to them? Did they merit no sort of acknowledgment—no kind of
grateful courtesy—no little favour done them—(Jack is not over-
... weening; his own generosity enlarging, the smallest kindness to him-
self), as a sort of national testimony to their humble greatness?
Well, a few days since, the men were paid off at Woolwich, when, we
are told, they “were exceedingly well-conducted, and appreciated the
accommodation afforded them at the pay-table.” It seems their past
heroism was not wholly unregarded, for they were not paid in a scramble,
but-in some way—accommodated at the pay-table. -
Now, Punch would have suggested another sort of accommodation,
and another sort of table. Punch, visiting the Enterprise and the
Investigator, would have piped, all hands to dinner in the Hall of
Greenwich, Hospital. The Hall should have been drest, with flags,
befitting the sailor-triumph. To that Hall, through the town of
Greenwich, the crews, should have marched, flags flying, and music
playing. In that Hall the Polar sailors, waited upon by Greenwich
pensioners, should have eaten and drunk, toasting sweethearts and
wives, whilst the Governor of Greenwich Hospital, in a “neat
speech,” should have acknowledged the services done by the oak-
hearted guests to humanity, and to the national character.
This little banquet would have been only decent; nothing more than
a cordial and no less proper farewell to the heroic tars, every one of
whom would have thought himself personally thanked by all his
countrymen. But mo, heroic Jack is turned off like a lazy footman
—though, to be sure, the hero is accommodated, we know not how, at
the pay-table. , Punch puts it to the Lords of the Admiralty,+s not
the omission shabby:

THE LATE QUEEN DOWAGER.
IN death this estimable lady manifests the simplicity and
delicacy of her nature. We are given to understand that in her
final letter—delivered after her decease to the QUEEN–she desired
that, in her case, there might be no embalmment of mortal clay,
that there might be no lying in state, and lastly, that she might
be borne to her grave by “her sailors:” certain of the crew of
the ship in which she made her voyages to Madeira and Malta.
The process of embalmment—for which Egypt, in her creed, may
give a reasonable motive—has always appeared to us the last
miserable custom in which the mortal pomp of Christianity
vainly strives to vindicate itself; a poor design to cheat the
levelling worm, and set aside the universal sentence of dust to
dust. It is well enough, and a part of the morality of the men,
that such persons as HENRY THE EIGHTH and GEORGE THE
FourTH should be filled with spices and swathed in cere-cloth,
to be sweetened and preserved from decay; made mummies of
departed arrogance; but for QUEEN ADELAIDE, her memory is her
best embalmment. She is preserved in the recollection of her
abounding goodness. Neither was it required that a lady, whose
acts of life were finest truths, should, in her coffin, “lie in state.”
For what a mockery is the ceremony at best What comment
on the carcase within is the gold and velvet without, the gorgeous
hangings, and the trappings of the ceremonious mourners! Truly
it is “lying in state,” and most melancholy lying, too.
We close this brief motice of the departed QUEEN with an
anecdote that may be usefully considered by the savagely virtuous;
by those whose ferocity of chastity too often makes them neglect
the appeal of the erring of their own sex. The story is given
upon undoubted testimony; and the moral beauty contained
in it demands and insures its preservation.
The DUKE OF CLARENCE, in the lifetime of MRs. Jordan, was
frequently behind the scenes in Drury Lane Theatre. Indeed, it
is said that the royal autograph is extant in the Saturday Treasury
book for MRs. JoBDAN’s salary. Thus, in after times, a few of
the old Drury actors always met with a cordial reception at Bushy,
and none more so than DowTo.N. Upon a certain “benefit”
occasion the actor waited upon the sailor Duke, and was received
with the old kindness and simplicity. In the course of the
interview, the Duke observed the actor look significantly at a
portrait over the chimney—the portrait of MRs. JoBDAN. “Yes,
DowTON,” said the Duke, “she was an excellent woman; and, by
the way, I’ll tell you a little story about that picture. It always
hung there: but some time before I was married to the Duchess
I caused it to be removed. Well, shortly after I brought the
Duchess home, I found one morning the picture in its old place.
‘This,” said the Duchess, “was done at my desire. I discovered
that the picture had long hung there; it was the picture of the
mother of your children, and it was not fit it should be displaced.
You must gratify me, and let it remain.’”
Let those who withhold their aid from the daughter of NELsoN,
because the daughter of LADY HAMILTON, consider this, and know
that the best chastity is best adorned by the largest charity.
A LITTLE BIRD.
HUMOURS OF THE NAVY.
LAST week SIR CHARLEs NAPIER wrote a letter to the Times, exposing
the disgraceful state of Old England's Wooden Walls, which, § his
account, seem regulated by heads of their own material. The gallant
officer has made some extraordinary disclosures. From his letter, it
appears that “conversions,” to a vast amount, have occurred in the
British Navy. This announcement may lead some to suppose that a
great many of our ships have gone over to Rome; whereas, very few
of them have gone anywhere except to Jericho. The conversion of bad
vessels means turning men-of-war into convict and coal hulks, lazarettos
and receiving ships, and even into fire-wood, by breaking them up, and
thus fulfilling on them, the nautical imprecation, “Shiver my timbers.”
We find that, since the war, lll two-deckers and 125 frigates have,
in some mysterious manner, vanished; actually disappeared alto-
gether; and after this, we shall not be surprised to, hear Jack Tars,
making nothing of the Flying Dutchman, tell us of between two and
three hundred sail of Flying Englishmen—the missing ships—seen on
the eye of a hurricane. The document, in question further informs us,
that “LORD SPENCER's Admiralty built a whole lot of flat and useless
gun-brigs, and called them aſter his lordship's hounds;” not, perhaps,
without reason, since it would seem that they were about as capable of
chasing a fox as an enemy. But it gives another instance of naval
nomenclature even happier than the last; that of twenty-four ships of
28 guns, built since the war, being called “Donkeys,” named, we must
conclude, after their designers. The majority of these proved donkeys
that wouldn’t go, and were consequently “converted.”
. So far SIR CHARLEs NAPIER's revelations partake of the character of
jokes; but now comes a statement which cannot at all be classed in that
category. “The Admiralty costs £136,303–f4500 of which goes to a
First Lord, who knows nothing.” . In fact, the First Lord of the
Admiralty is a landsman; although, in the execution of his office,
certainly, always at sea. The upshot of all this pretty management,
according to the Times, is, that ninety millions of money have been spent
to no purpose; so that what might have been now a grand floating
capital has been irrecoverably sunk. Thus there has “gone down,”
together with the “love of woman,” and the other precious things
alluded to in MRs. HEMANs's noble song, “The Treasures of the *.
as also with the “wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,” &c.,
mentioned by SHAkspeaRE in Člarence's Dream, no less a sum than
£90,000,000 sterling !
MUSIC BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.

IT appears that songs and pieces of music are now sent from Boston
to New York by Electric Telegraph. Our American brethren have
among them such remarkable musical instruments, and in fact such
astounding lyres, that nothing coming from the other side of the
Atlantic can take us by surprise; and we are, therefore, not altogether
dumbfounded by the announcement of music having been carried from
one portion of the States to another on the wires of the Electric Tele-
graph. It must be delightful for a party at Boston to be enabled to
call upon a gentleman in New York for a song.
The grand point of the invention, however, seems to be, that, if songs
can be carried along the lines, our popular vocalists may treble or
quintuple their present salaries, by singing in four or five places at
once. Our own JENNY LIND, for example, who seems to be wanted
everywhere at the same time, will have an opportunity of gratifying the
subscribers to HER MAJESTY's Theatre, and a couple of audiences
many hundred miles off at the same moment. The tº: being
found applicable for singing, may also be used by the shareholders who
are beginning to ºf out pretty loudly for their dividends, as well as
for the directors, who have been obliged to sing rather small during
the last twelvemonth. -
We hope the music of the wires may have the effect of restorin
harmony to the railway world, which has long been out of tune, an
which has lately been acting by no means in concert.

: Louis NAPOLEoN AND His “council.”
CALIGULA wished that his enemies had but one neck among the whole of them,
but Louis NAPOLEoN goes further, and wishes his Ministers to be without any
head at all. If his Cabinet consisted of females, his policy would be unobjectionable,
for he would be likely, if the well-known adage is true, to secure good members,
by taking care to select women by virtue of their headlessness.

If there should be a series of historical pictures grow out of the career of
Louis Napoleon, we should suggest that a sitting of his Council could not be
more truthfully represented than by a painting showing his Ministers in a headless
condition, in accordance with that state of moral decapitation, to which they have
º doomed by the President’s determination to permit the use of no head but
s own.
AWFUL WRECKIN THE WESTERN ROADS.
It is not often that our columns are devoted to the annals of disaster; but
a wreck has recently cccurred in the Western Roads which we feel, it our painful
duty to chronicle. There had lately been launched from the Omnibus deck-yards
a remarkable bit of craft, in which there was indeed as much cunning as craft; for
the ostensibly new teak-built Kensington Bus was nothing more than an old Chelsea
hull cut down upon the principle adopted in our national ship-building establish-
ments. She had been repainted from stem to stern, with a new figure head, an
enormous 3d. stuck into her gib; and having been fitted up with one-and-a-half-
horse power, was manned with two boys, one fore and another aft, for the Ken-
sington mail and female service. She had been on the station for the last week
or so, and nothing remarkable had been discovered about her, except that she
rolled a good deal when heavily laden, and pitched occasionally when fairly under
weigh with a full cargo.
She was one day last week carrying her full complement, amidst remarks
anything but complimentary from the crews of the opposition craft, and had passed
the new straits of the modern Gibraltar at GeoRGE HUDson's bay, without any
thing particular having happened. She had, however, not gone very far along the
Western Roads when, in trying to avoid the shingles which lie in shoals about the
tº she gave a lurch to the leeward, and whilst yard-arm and yard-arm with one of
the Northern-lights, belonging to the Gas Company, she gave a roll, and her, one:
and-a-hall-horsepower having failed, she pitched forwards on to her figure-head, and
the hawser coming off each horse, they scudded for a few yards under bare poles,
when in an instant the whole concern turned over on to her beam ends, and an
immediate wreck was the consequence. No recklessness is attributable to the
parties in charge, who behaved throughout with wondrous coolness, for they coolly
asked the passengers to keep their seats, though the whole of those who were on
deck and occupied the fore part were thrown on to the mud bank in the vicinity;
Several hats were picked up by the natives, who rushed to render assistance, and
humanely scraped, with a road scraper that chanced to be close at hand, the coats
of those who, in addition to their natural crustiness, had a crust of mud forming
rapidly all over them.
We understand neither craft nor cargo had been insured, and the Elder Brethren
of the Trinity House have protested against the Younger Brethren—the conductor
was a mere boy—being employed on these perilous voyages.

GOOD CHEER TO LADY FRANKLIN.
BE of good courage, Lady! still, though tried,
Maintain the trusting heart,
The faithful Consort’s part,
So as befits a gallant sailor's bride.
Yet live in hope; though better tidingslack,
Thy husband and his crew
Have left no happier clue;
But not a sign of shipwreck marks their track.
Sound were the barks those hardy hearts that bore;
Soon may we see again
Him and his iron men
Injoy and honour standon England's shore.
Think of the brave who sought their kindred band,
In ice illimitable bound,
And drifting o'er the vast profound,
Freed on a sudden by a viewless Hand.
That Hand of might, outstretched upon the sea,
That broke the frozen continent
Wherein those mariners were pent,

CHESS, THE CHEAP DEFENCE OF NATIONS.
MR. STAUNToN, the Mighty Shah of Chess, has º:
e
powers. This mode of warfare will be much cheaper than
|the present; and, in the end, every way as efficacious. We
now pay, it appears, £47,000,000 annually for wars past
and wars in prospect. Now, a thousandth part of this sum
will pay a .." handsome salary to CHEss-GENERAL STAUN-
|Ton, finding
im a most efficient staff, besides his Board.
It cannot be forgotten that the hero STAUNToN had his
Chess Waterloo in Paris a few years since; though-
we blush for the meanness of Parliament in some matters-
not a farthing has hitherto been granted to the victor for
the purchase of a single rood of estate; neither has he
been called to any House whatever, either as Knight or
Bishop. However, the better sort of glory is its own re-
ward, and of this sort is Chess.
Chess-GENERAL STAUNToN having received his commis-
sion at the hands of Friend GURNEY-(who has calculated
the ruinous cost of powder and shot within a decimal frac-
tion)—has wholly remodelled his forces. All his new Chess-
men have a peculiarity, beautifully significant of their
enlarged object, -the pacific defence of England. Hence-
forth disagreements are to be played out—not fought. In
order, however, to conciliate certain prejudices, every move
will be accompanied by a discharge of artillery, of greater
or less volume, according to the hit made by the player.
Thus, there will still be the flavour of gunpowder to give a
relish to the contest.
GENERAL STAUNTON's new Chessmen greatly differ from
all Chessmen heretofore. For instance. The King has a
Crown of Olive, and the Queen a Coronet of Heart’s-
Hºsº symbolical. The Knights bear £ s. d upon
their Shields, denoting the expense of War, and the Castles
are a fac-simile of Dover. Castle, in its present state of
Debtors' Prison. The Bishops are filletted with Palm
Leaves, and the Pawns are wonderful likenesses of dis-
tinguished Members of the Society of Friends. We recog-
nised among them SAMUEL GURNEY, CHARLEs GILPIN,
John BRIGHT, Joseph STURGE, and others.
On the first war that may break out between France
and England, GENERAL STAUNTon will take the field,
sitting down either in the Gardens of the Tuileries, or the
Palais Royal, before the enemy. Of course, during the
campaign—that may extend over half-a-dozen games-all
relations will cease, between the two countries. The
games, however, being played out, peace will be settled
upon the like satisfactory basis as that which ever results
from an appeal to arms.
Who shall prophesy events, from the present state of
Continental politics? Who shall, say how soon CHEss-
GENERAL STAUNTon may be called into play?. However,
let the call be made when it may, we have in the past the
liveliest hope for the future. A statue is still wanted in
Trafalgar Square. After a few campaigns, CHEss-GENERAL
STAUNTON, as one of his own Knights, may take the oppo-
site corner to GEORGE THE Fourth.

NOTHING CAN COME OF NOTHING.
THERE have lately come into fashion in
musical circles some German compositions
called “Songs without words.” These must be
- an immense improvement on the productions
- of our modern English ballad writers, whose
§ songs would have been unobjectionable, had
§§ there been no words introduced into them.
& We ourselves have serious thoughts of bring-
ing out a volume of these songs without
words, for we often feel within us that we
are a muffled MooRE, or a tongue-tied TEN-
Nyson at least, and if the public would only
accept our songs without our being under the
necessity of furnishing the words, we should
acquire the reputation of a “mute,” but not
an “inglorious MILTON.” The principle of
songs without words is not quite a new one,
for we have long been accustomed on the
stage to jokes without point, and plays with-
out characters. It is nothing more than the
old story of Hamlet without the Prince ºf
Denmark over again, and though the public
has taken very warmly to these songs with-
out words, the idea is not entitled to any
praise on the point of novelty. ,
Encouragement to Farmers.
In the Diggings it is well known, there is
an utter absence of Protection, so that each

yet there is no place in the world where the

'Twas the Britannia, CAPTAIN BULL, a good ship as you know,
Was cruising in the Channel, when the Times great guns did blow;
And ADMIRAL NAPIER, being on board, his glass set to his eye,
When four hundred and fifty sail he all at once did spy.
Then said John BULL as walked the deck, “That’s the British Fleet,”
says he,
“From ordinary they’ve comed out to sail upon the sea.
It's many a million pound they cost, but let them look for squalls,
As grudges what it takes to mend them precious wooden walls.”
But ADMIRAL NAPIER shook his 'ead and turned his quid and spoke:
“If them ain't Flying Dutchmen I wish I may be broke.
That there's the British fleet as was, but many a year 'twill be
Afore you see one o' that there fleet a-sailing on the sea.
It was when we had thrashed the foe all in the year fifteen,
Thirteen three-deckers we had then, as has never since been seen;
With two-deckers an 'undred and seventy and ſour,
And a good four hundred smaller craft, wich now they is no more.
There’s ne'er a one, mate, see these ships for to go down at sea,
Nor took in action, neither, by the French enemy.
And that’s wot puzzles me,” says he, “and ort to puzzle you,
To find out where the blazes them wessels is gone to.
But them's the gosts of that there fleet, and ven it blows a gale,
Right in the Admiralty's eye you’ll see them for to sail.”
John BULL he swore and says, says he, “Where they comed from well
I knows,
And blest if for the future I don't see where they goes.”
KNIFE AND Fork MEMORIES.–SIR PETER LAURIE always comes
out conspicuous on great occasions. He is no more to be confounded
with humbler individuals than is the zebra at the Zoological Gardens
with the wild ass of the desert. No: he is ever very marked and
very fine. On the death of the QUEEN Dowager, a Court of Alder-
men was, of course, convoked “to express its sense on the melanchol
event.” Upon this SIR PETER “felt the greatest anxiety” to clu
his share of sense of condolence. And upon these grounds: the
QUEEN DowAGER had done “him the high honour of visiting the
Mansion:house in his mayoralty.” But SIR PETER was not to be
alone in his sorrow. Certainly not. For ALDERMAN HUMPHREY must
contribute, his “grateful recollections,” inasmuch as he (HUMPHREY)
was, on the royal, visit, Sheriff to Laurie's Mayor. The marvel
of the matter is, that any royal person, soever should or could die,
M. º “partaken of a déjeiner” with such a Mayor and such
a onerlit.

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF A PICTURE.
I Have had many tumbles in my life-elevated to-day, and cut down
to-morrow. If I were a mere common picture—an Art-Union daub of
a thing—I should not so much mind it, but when I tell the reader that
I am the chef d'autre of my master-and he painted some hundreds
in his day—I do think my treatment is a disgrace to a country that
professes so much love for the Fine Arts. - --
I was nursed at the Royal Academy, when the Royal Academicians
used to “hang out” at Somerset House. I need not say I was the
pride of the Exhibition. Thousands paid their shillings to see me
and thousands went away without having seen me, such was the crow
daily collected round me to pay homage to my beauty. . . . . .
After three months of the est praise, I was carried in triumph
to my new home. It was a triumph, for there Imixed with the best of
English company. My merits were eagerly, canvassed by my fellow-
pictures, but always kindly, and, I was bade welcome in the most
lowing manner by TURNER, and with such a gush of animal *:
f. LANDSFER, Cooper, and others, that I felt quite, proud of the
profession to which I belonged. I recollect it was at the house of a
gentleman, who had covered his walls with the choicest wall fruit, not
only from LANCE, but from every member of the Royal Academy: this
gentleman lived for Art, and his last act was to bequeath us to the
. ion, indulging in the hope that the Nation would take every care
OI us.
I cannot say that the Nation, as yet, has sufficiently appreciated the
value of my master's noble gift, but I suppose a brighter day will dawn
upon my fellow captives, who are at present pining and wasting away
in a miserable little dungeon, several feet beneath the level of the
ginger-beer fountains of Trafalgar Square.
Into this dark dungeon was I cruelly cast—several link-boys lighting
the way—and there remained for several weeks perishing by square
inches, for no other offence in the world than because I was a British
}. and my noble master was dead. In my agony I remember
raming the ungenerous wish that I had been born a spurious Holbein,
for then I should have had a warm room, and the best accommodation
upstairs, with the pick of the Old Masters. This base wish, however,
was only momentary; a º: of shame stole over my classic features,
and I then swelled with pride at the thought that I was a British
Picture, and that some day my beauties would be brought to light.
I don't know whether it was this shame, or the pride, or the warmth
of the F. or of my feelings, or whether it was a natural weakness,
but all I know is, I felt a gra-
dual, softening of the brain,
which ended, one º morn-
ing, in my feeling my head was
decidedly cracked. I have no
doubt it was brought on by
melancholy, from hanging too
much upon the degradation of
my position. Itook to crying,
my eyes were weeping the bit-
terest oil of turpentine from
morning to night, and my face
of longer and longer every
aw.
- #he noise my head made as
it kept splitting attracted the
notice of one of the charwomen
left in charge of the place;
and, upon a candle being brought, it was discovered Iwas all topsy-
turvy, and that my eyes were down in my mouth, and that my chin was
buried in my waistcoat-pocket. -
To remedy this topsy-turviness, it was proposed to turn me upside
down. I was accordingly set upon my head, with my heels dangling
in the air. This, however, did not º the condition of my frame;
and my new position only had the effect of turning my nose, from a
beautiful. Roman, into the most decided turmup. But I felt myself
snubbed in more ways than this. It was true the sharers of my cap-
tivity could not witness my disgrace,
and I was afraid to speak lest they
should distinguish from my voice how
º Iwas “down in themouth.”
My sufferings, however, were none the
less. Ilost every bit of colour. I was
washed, towelled, rubbed and scrubbed
all over with every sort of brush; but
they could not make me myself again.
I grew worse; a dark eruption spoilt
my little remaining beauty; and soon
I had not a feature which, let them
turn me up or down, was recognisable.
I was quite black in the face, as if it
tº: * painted originally with alead-
rus
One last effort was made. A sapient
Doctor, who had taken his degree of
R.A., discovered that my colour had
disappeared only from its sinking too
deeply into the canvas. “If you put
the picture, therefore, on the ground, with its face towards the floor,
º upon it, its colour will all come back again.” Iwas accordingly
laid flat on my stomach for a fortnight, and heavy catalogues of defunct
Exhibitions were placed on my back, to press the colour through, but
this process answered no better than the one of hanging me by the heels.
am now a perfect skeleton, so wasted away, that any one can see
through me. Life is not yet extinct, and I use my last breath to save
the companions of my captivity from the same horrible fate to which I
have fallen the first martyr. If they are not quickly taken out of that
abominable dark, hole, º may take my dying ". for it, that every
picture there will soon be, like myself, on its last hooks.
HANDWRITING AND CHARACTER.
oRTUNE-TELLING has fallen to a dis-
count. Horoscopes are a drug in
the market, and even the feeblest-
minded maid-of-all-work is reluctant
to part with her pence to see her
future husband in a looking-glass.
The Vauxhall Merlin can scarcely
secure histhree-penn'orth of rum to
, keep the cold out as he sits in his
cave, ready to cast nativities at two-
pence per nativity; but a “new
dodge” has lately been started,
which for audacious humbug is
quite on a par with all the rest of
the impostures that have robbed
imbecility of its penceorits pounds.
The “dodge” to which we allude is
an undertaking by sundry adver-
tising experimentalists on public credulity to tell the character by the
hº in return for a certain amount in silver or in postage
stamps.
*: test of the value of these written characters, we may mention
the little fact of an individual having been desirous to test the accuracy
of two professors, and having received from each a totally different
character, while from one of them, who had been written to twice, there
proceeded two characters, totally at variance with each other, of the
same applicant. If we may be allowed to take the liberty of reading
the character of one of the professors in his handwriting, we should be
disposed to give him the benefit of the following:-
“The hand before us is an old hand, or, to use a more appropriate
phrase, the writing indicates a knowing hand....We should be disposed
to say that such a hand might claim kindred with light-fingered qualities
to a certain extent, and would have a finger in any pie without being
at all particular. Perhaps, however, we should becoming nearer to
the mark, in our estimate of the character of the Professor in this
case, if we were to say that, judging from his handwriting, in which he
has placed in black and white the proof of his own process being utterly
deceptive, he may be said to have no character at all.”

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
233
CHARLEY FILLIP AND THE “MORNING
CHRONICLE.”
MistER PUNCH,--I burst through a contempt of more than 9 days to
ask you to put in what’s below. A person in the Morning Chronicle has
written about my weights and scales as costermonger in the New Cut—
I mean the person who’s called “Special Correspondent,of the Metro-
politan Districts.” In a shameful piece of writing about the respectable
costermongers of this ancient city, he says-
“The profit is made up in deficient weight. I was shown pound weights varying
from 12 to 8 oz., which are used according to the liberality or meanness of the purchaser.
This, with the 2 oz. draught of the weighing machine, and the other ounce that is gained
by the dealer placing the article at the extremity of the weighing pan, will reduce the
huckster's pound to 9 or 5 oz., according as he pleases.”
Again, Mr. Punch, on periwinkles:–
“Periwinkles they sell 3d. a quart, and if they cannot get that sum for them, they
call them at 1d. per pint, and serve them out in a short measure. The measure is a
pewter pint pot, with a tin lining made like a funnel. This is called a short pint, and
is less than half the proper quantity.”.
And last of all upon “cod-fish,” and short weight:-
“The weight he was “working' was 12 oz. to the pound. My informant told me he
knew this, because he had borrowed his 12 oz. pound weight that morning. This, with
the draught of 2 oz. in the weighing machine, and the ounce gained by placing
the fish at the end of the pan, would bring the actual weight given to 9 oz. per
pound, and probably he had even a lighter pound weight ready for a ‘scaly'
customer.”
Well, Mr. Punch, as the eyes of all the world’s been set upon me
by this charge of using false weights, and not caring a pin about my
measures, or my balance,—I’ve begged a few of my friends to write
me their notions upon the matter, and to speak to my character as a
costermonger, of thirty years' calling. It’s not my case alone, but the
case of every costermonger, out of whose cod-fish and º:
mean his character—any man, with an iron pen in his' hand, may cut
himself a dinner. I might print a precious lot, but I let you off
with the following. (Please mend the spelling.)
Letter from WILLIAM MIzzLE, Costermonger.
“Papement, New Cut.
“My praF CHARLEY,+You're as innocent as the babe that may never
see the light. You never did use false weight, but always gave them
more than any costermonger in this blessed town. Don’t mind’em,
but flare up and join the Union.
“Yours, my dear CHARLEY, for life,
“WILLIAM MIZZLE.”
From SAMUEL RABBITs, Costermonger.

Lane.
“DEARCHARLEY, -I have examined your periwinkle pot; an honester
pot never broke the bread of life. It hasn't a bit of tin in it, what there ||
is, is all silver. “Yours for ever,
“SAMUEL RABBITs.”
From RoBERT WHELks, Costermonger.
“Clare Market.
“MY DEAR MR.CHARLEs, FILLIP,-Treat with cold-drawn contempt
-cold as castor-oil-what they say about the fish and weighing it “at
the end of the pan.’ You never did anything of the kind, for I’ve
always watched you. Qn the contrary, it’s giving over-weight, that’s
ever kept you low. If you hadn’t had the weakness to be unjust to
yourself, and over just to all the world beside, you’d have rid in your
carriage years ago, and been drawn by four piebalds.
“Yours very sincerely (and ashamed of the world
“For your sake),

NEWTON CONFUTED.
WE are sorry to be at issue with such a great authority as NEwTON,
or SIGNOR NEw-TONE as the Italian image-boys respectfully designate
him when they offer him for sale in plaster of Paris, but we really must
deny the universality of his rule as to the earth's attraction. Let any
9ne who doubts us go to Vauxhall when 4000 of the additional 5000
lamps are put out by the rain or blown out by the wind; let him go to
an agricultural meeting during a dull Protectionist speech; let him
enter the House of Commons when CHISHoly ANSTEY is on his legs,
and it will be admitted at once, that to these spots of earth the New-
tonian rule does not always apply, for, on the occasions described, they
possess no attraction whatever, "We are º to overturn in part the
great theory of the earth's attraction, but there is no rule, from a
3-foot rule to a rule nisi, without an exception.

FL0ATING BEER SHOPS, G --
-
's
SoME of the River Steamers plying between Dyers' Hall and West-
minster Bridge have, we are told, been converted into floating beer-
shops, or public-houses, and have been licensed accordingly. As it is
not everybody that likes to find himself in a tap-room when he fancied
he was entering a steamboat cabin, it is expedient that the hoisting of
a sign should be a sine qué non with the1. of these amphibious
establishments. There should be a motification that there is a good dry
skittle-ground in the hold; and a bar should be erected across the
fºliº an ordinary public-house sign should depend from the
unnel.
“The Old King Coal” would be a good name for one of these con-
cerns; and as things, as well as men, “should be what they seem,” we
hope these river public-houses will at once adopt the external emblems
of their real character.
LOGIC AT REIGATE.
THE following singularly logical plea for Protection was put forward,
according to the Times, by a MR. Robinson the other day at the
Reigate meeting:—
“They rejoiced that Protection was blown to the winds, but did they know that the
principle was almost a universal law of Nature ?”
Well then, one would think, we should let Nature take her course,
and leave her law to regulate Protection as it does the wind, so that the
very wisest plan is, absolutely, to blow the former to the latter.
MR. Robinson added:—
“Did not all in the creation require Protection, from the QUEEN of ENGLAND to the
meanest of her subjects, and even the meanest of all created things?"
Certainly: may we never be deprived of that Protection which her
Majesty requires, together with F. people and insects.
}. the practical consistency of the meeting beat even MR.Robinson's
In one of the resolutions it was moved,
“That the agricultural, colonial, and other interests of this country are at the present
moment involved in intense suffering and difficulty, and are fast hastening to a most
fatal condition of general distress and ruin.”
On the foregoing, the Times report ſurnishes this pregnant com-
mentary:—
“A sumptuous dinner was given in the evening at the White Hart, covers being
laid for about sixty.”
Come; the Reigate agriculturists are not starving. We believe
they mean to petition for a dissolution. It is to be º: that,
if they complain of their distress to the QUEEN, HER MAJESTY will be
pleased to return the following gracious answer:—“Pray, gentlemen,
at the White Hart the other day, what did you have for dinner P”
A PROMINENT BODY.
THE City of London Union is the only one in the Metropolis which
relieves the casual poor. Like the figures on the pedestal of NELSON's
Column, the Union stands out in bold relief.

Mr. Pips
Thursday, December 6, 1849.-Did set my Wife, poor Wretch I this
Evening to mending my Socks, which is a pretty Employment for her
Leisure; and myself to Drury fame, to Monsieur JULLIEN his Concert.
The first Part of the Concert all DR. MENDElssohn his Musique,
which I did long mightily to hear, and, so to do in Confort, !". a
Ticket for the Dress Circle, cost me 2s 6d., but found the Seats all full,
and obliged to stand the whole While, which made me mad, but a
pretty full-eyed young Lady being forced to stand too, and close by me
though with her Brother, did comfort me a little, not that she coul
not sit, but that she was by me. Heard a Symphony that did well
please me, seeming to liſt me into the Clouds, and was mighty mystical
and pretty; and the Musique in the Midsummer Night's Dream did
give me much Delight, the Twittering throughout the Overture putting
me in Mind of Singing-Birds and Fairies and I know not what, and the
sleepy Passages very sweet and lulling. Mightily taken with the Pre-
lude to the Mock-Tragedy, Bottom his March, as droll Musique as I
ever heard; but what did most of all delight me was the Wedding March,
a noble Piece, and I did rejoice therein, and do think to hire a Band to
play it under our Window on §§. Day. Monsieur JULLIEN
in his white Waistcoat and with his Moustachios mighty spruce and as
grand as ever, and did conduct the Musique, but so quietly in the first
Part that iſ could scarcº have believed it, and methought showed
Reverence for the Composer; which was handsome. But good Lack! to
see him, presently, when he come to direct “God Sare the Queen,”
flourish his Batoon, and act the mad Musician! All the Company rising

and taking off their Hats was a noble Sight, and grand, the While, to
hear that majestical Anthem, till presently, some most, ridiculous and
impertinent W. set all the House a laughing and some hissing,
and I do suspect Monsieu R JULLIEN had a special Audience this
Night, that would not away with such Tricks. Between the Parts of
the Concert, I into the Pit to walk about among the Sparks, and there
a great Press, and the House crammed to the Ceiling. Did visit the
Refreshment, and Reading Rooms, where young Blades and I asses
drinking of Coffee and eating of Ices, and some reading of the News,
and with Shrubs and Statues round about, and the House all White
and Gold, and brightly lighted, mighty gay; and the Sparks jaunty, but
not, I think, wearing such flaming Neckcloths and Breast Pins as they
were wont. Did stay out the second Part only because curious to hear
the Row-Polka, and heard some ºf of the Prophète, full of Snorting
of Brass Instruments and Tinkling of Triangles, and along Waltz that
did give me the Fidgets, and nothing wherein I could take any Delight
at all, save in JETTY TREFFZ her singing of “Trab. trab.” which was
retty. At last, the Row:Polka played, and well-named it seemed, to
|. and very droll and absurd, with Chiming-in of Voices, and other
monstrous Accompaniments, making a good ridiculous rough Musique.
But many of the Hearers did hiss, methought with Unreason, the
Polka being no worse than any other Polka, but better, as less empty,
having some Joke in it. Home, the Wedding March running in my
Head, and glad to find goou Musique drawing so great a House, which
I do hope will be a Hint to Monsieu R JULLIEN.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
235
Punch To THE FRENCH PRESIDENT,
MoNs. LE PRESIDENT,
I HAVE to acknowledge an act of º courtesy on your
part, towards my illustrious tº: R. RoBERT STEPHEN-
son, engineer, who, says your Moniteur, “has been named a Knight of
the Order of the Légion of Honour.”, Besides the courtes , there is a
delicate touch of satire in the act—though, I fear, too delicate to be
felt by the ruling powers of perfidious Albion. ...We don’t honour
Literature, Science, or anything of that sort. We now and then
acknowledge the existence of prodigious talent, when we happen to
want it. We bow down and worship an Iron fluke, but we pay no
distinction to an Iron Genius. The battle of Waterloo-the fact is
now so historical, that you will pardon my allusion to it—was a splendid
affair, no doubt; but, to my poor thinking, of much less account to the
interests of mankind, than the tubular bridge, across the Menai Strait.
That is an iron victory of a somewhat nobler kind. However, nothing
like gunpowder to make º Iron, founded into cannon,
ıkes Dukes; iron, worked with the most marvellous skill, that even
Homeric º must applaud and marvel af, calls for no distinction
at the hands of John Buil. ... He just nods approval, and there an end.
It must be confessed you do these things better in France.
A few days, ago, we paid off a couple of ships’ crews returned from
the North Pole, making no more account of the gallant hardihood, the
indomitable courage of the noble fellows—of courage exercised in the
holiest cause, than if they had been, so many stokers of the Dais
and the Moonlight, plying between London
I can ...ºf other treatment for such heroes in France. Why, Sir
they would have received a national acknowledgment. They would
have been banquetted at the Hôtel de Ville, or at the Invalides. All
France, in the person of the Minister of Marine, would have thanked
the tars; sending them home with their hearts' throbbing with a new
love towards their country. We do nothing of the sort. No : we
“accommodate.”—so say the newspapers—“the brave fellows at the
pay-table.”. We throw down their wages, and there an end. We
discharge them as we would discharge a waterman, who takes us from
Battersea to Westminster.
And is this fault only the error of our Government? Certainly not.
Our journalists, are tainted to rankness with it. They want mutual
respect—mutual advocacy of the dignity of their calling. They spatter
ink at one another, whilst, they vainly endeavour to cover with many
coats of whitewash—though the black will come through—even an Old
Bailey Barrister-(why is there not a Brazen Lectureship for the reward
of living brass as well as the Golden by to the disadvantage of an honour-
able fellow-labourer. The hireling of the Old Bailey is pure as a “rose:
jº. cherub:” the brother journalist is a knave who eats the bread
of Iles.
Feeling and lamenting this miserable want of public recognition of
the claims of genius—lamenting that those whose proper function it is
to teach and vindicate the dignity of intellect, are too prone to ignore
its noblest dues, HI learned with the greatest satisfaction that, with a
delicacy honourable to yourself, and satiric of us, you have distinguished
that great man—that wonderful conqueror of the impossible—Robert
STEPHENson." His iron triumph live when the triumphs of round
shot shall have ended.
However, Paris is now brought within nine hours of London, and we
may by-and-by learn better. In the meantime, M. LE PREsident,
allow me sincerely to thank you, even for the Legion of Honour!

NELSON'S “RELICTS” AND NELSON'S DAUGHTER.
UNDER this title, there is an appeal in the Times, in the shape of a
letter to the hero-worshippers—an appeal for “an old cook of LoRD
NELson’s.” She is nearly 80. She is *::...; She has scarcely
food to eat. The writer of the letter feels assured that her case has

belonged to I.QRI, NELSON would not be suffered to want food, if
persons knew of it.”
We believe, with the writer, that a cat of NEIson's—a well-authen-
ticated cat—a cat identified, and youched for by the very best authority
—would, at the moment, #. in a thousand benefactors and bene-
factresses. *We have little doubt that even the present EARL NElson
himself would, to such a cat, afford food and shelter; even though
the cat, from “increasing age and infirmities,” were unable to pay for
such aid and protection the tribute of a single mouse. There would,
on all ii. }. little to fear, for NELSON's cat; as for NElson's
Cook, w;"can, ºnly, say, we wish her better luck than has fallen to
NELson's child." But then kitchen bars have a better taim on the

THE competitors for this grand, annual affair have been all the year
in training for the great event, and the result is, that many have arrived
at the glorious goal of plethoric pinguidity. The contest has been
somewhat the reverse of a race, for, inasmuch as the latter is decided
by the rate at which the animals run, the victory in the enormous
ºf: of fatness, is to those who are brought most effectually to a
dead stand-still. - - -
Among the oxen, a mountainous brute, No. 19, who seemed quite

in the funeral obsequies of his dog Pincher, which had been long ailing."
The paper then i. on to enumerate the pomps of sepulture; a
coffin, covered with black velvet, silver-headed nails and handles, and
a solid silver plate | We ask why does not our contemporary publish
the name of this late Member of Parliament—this criminal against the
claims of suffering human nature? With the misery existing about us
—-the misery "...ºf and crushing young and old-we would gibbet
the offender's name for the contempt of the world. ... We hold him
guilty of sacrilege against the wretchedness of his fellow-man, and
denounce him accordingly.
“The undertaker (continues the account) made, not an elm coffin covered with ordinary
black cloth, but with real velvet, silver-headed nails and handles, and a solid silver
*: on which was engraved, "Pincher, for nine years the attached and faithful dog of
. G., Esq., Obiit 10th of October, 1849.”
As “W. G.” has buried his dog with more than the lavish expense
laid out upon a man, so when the offender departs from a world whose
good sift; he so wretchedly misuses—so . we have him buried like
a dog. “W. G.” can only save himself from contempt at the expense
of his reason. Can he be sane?
THE BAY of BiscAY INTERPRETED.
A MUSICAL critic in the Morning Post, in noticing the “Wednesday
Concertº,” talks of “HERR. FoEMEs's interpretation of Davy's nautical
ballad “The Bay of Biscay.” Interpretation? How so? We mus
suppose that HERR FoRMEs had, a German audience if he attempted
to interpret that truly British ballad.
One look foolish in the newspapers the next morning.
YE SHIP BUILDERS OF

(After CAMPBELL.)
YE ship-builders of England,
That load our native seas
With craft not fit to brave a year
The battle or the breeze:
Such rubbish do not launch again,
Top heavy, dull, and slow;
As they creep through the deep,
Whatever wind may blow.
LADIEs should be particular
to have their shoes half a
size smaller than their feet,
and be also very careful,
in case any questions are
raised as to their being too
tight, to say “Oh dear, no!
they’re much too large: "
for it is a most remarkable
fact that no lady was ever
known yet to wear a tight
shoe.
The soles of Ladies’ shoes
should be made as thin as
possible, for it stands to rea-
son they last much longer,
from the obvious cause that,
as a lady is sure to catch
cold with them, she will
not be able to wear then
so long as she is confined
to her bed, or in-doors.
Gentlemen had better not
go to the Promenade Con-
certs with a new pair of
boots, as the crowd is not
generally very particular
whose leet it treads upon,
and the density of the mou
makes it difficult to detect,
much less punish, the de-
linquent who has nearly
crushed your favourite toe.
Bootmakers have great
faith in their shoe-leather.
A tight pair of boots was
never tried on yet but what
the suffering martyr was
assured “that it would be
But while the leather is coolly
The spirits of retrenchment
Shall start from every wave,
For in the sea economy
Through you has found a grave.
Thousands and thousands you have sunk
In ships that will not go;
For they creep through the deep
Whatever wind may blow.
The costly ships of England
For fire-wood yet may burn,
Till to the models of the past
Her shipwrights shall return.
Then, then, ye clumsy ship-builders,
Our song no more will throw
All the blame on your name -
Which now merits every blow. |
THE
Greatest Improvement in Light.
WE were lately much startled by
seeing a “Revolution in Light”
announced in a morning paper. For
our part we are quite satisfied with
the existing laws of light as ex-
º by Newton, whatever may
e our opinion of the enactment on
that subject which emanated from PITT.
The freer the operation of the New-
toNIAN laws of light, indeed, we
think, the better, and therefore would
remove all impediments to it by repeal-
ing the window-tax.

CROWDED TO SUFFOCATION.
WE perceive by the advertisements and play-bills that one or more
Theatres in London every night are “crowded to suffocation.” This
is an awful fact, indeed, if it is a fact at all, and we implore some
humane Member of the Legislature to move for a return of all the
ersons suffocated in any given week at any metropoli'an play-house.
he allegation cannot be mere puff, for the critics sometimes tell us, as
they did the other day of Julii EN's Masquerade, that the place was
“crowded to suffocation.” How long are our Theatres to be turned
into black-holes of Calcutta, or how long are we to be horrified by the
announcement of suffocations, which have no existence anywhere but
in the criticisms (?) and the tops of the playbills?

T H E HO R Ro Rs o F Box 1 N G D AY.
jº
THE day is .." approaching when every one who wants at
Christmas what he calls a Box, prepares to make a demand on
John BULL’s chest. We have already noticed some of the most alarming
symptoms of a contemplated attack upon our pockets, and all those
who wish to get their hands in, are commencing their practice in this
harassing species of rifle exercise. . The dustman begins to call more
loudly and more punctually for his dust, while he is already on the look-
out for a dog with a dent in one eye, to prove the eye-dent-it-eye of
the “regular” claimant of our household ashes. The waits are heard
at midnight going through their classical quartette concerts on three
trombones and a drum, and we know the result of this brazen conduct
will be a demand on Boxing day from “your constant waiis,” who, in
many cases, will have to wait long enough before they obtain the
reward of their constancy.
Our postman, whose independence all the year (although very much
under-paid) has been so great that we have ſº mistaken him for
a colonial minister in the Windsor uniform—which by the way is the
postman's costume to a shade—our postman, we repeat, who has all the
year scarcely condescended to greet us with an odd nod, has, evidently
with a view to his annual box, been making a series of low bows,
which ſor some time we thought were ironically meant, until we re-
membered the compliments of the season, and it occurred to us that
another kind of compliment would be looked for in exchange.
MAGPIE MOURNING.
MR. MAGPIE deals in black and white. MR. MAGPIE would make
the most of his commodities. MR. MAGPIE, is a tradesman, and in the
pursuit of thrift, will say anything. MR. MAGPIE's º." the
tongues of magpies—being cut with silver to be made eloquent. Do
we blame MR. MAGPIE * Certainly not. He picks up his early worm
upon a royal grave, as in Magpie instinct bound to do. Magpies
must live. . .
Qur quarrel is with the Magpies—not of the sº but of the Press.
It is well enough for Mourning Magpie to chatter about “all-absorbing
feelings,” the while he cocks his head, and has his cold blue eye upon
the slit of his till; it is only the nature of the biped (not in feathers)
to make his nest cozey and warm, at all ventures. Therefore, let
Our newspaper boy, instead of pitching our daily print into our area,
as he has done since last Boxing-day, without even troubling himself to
ring the bell, has begun to stand at our door, vociferating, in a sonorous
tone of voice, the word “Pa—per,” with an emphasis which smacks
strongly of an expec ation of the usual gratuity. The beadle,
whom we have never seen since last Christmas, and whom,
during the year, we are accustomed to regard, as a myth, has
come across us, like a phantom, in his gold-laced coat, with crim-
son cape. And we have heard of the bellman – a functionary
who comes, like the grottos, “ º once a year,”—having purchased
a rhyming dictionary, to enable him to come out strongly in his
“copy of verses” for the coming holidays. The milkman has begun
for a while to put a little less of the pallida mors, or deadly whitewash,
into his milkpails; and even the butcher boy is on his best behaviour,
for he has only broken our bell-wire once a week for the last month,
instead of every other day, as he has been in the habit of doing when
Boxing-day was not imminent. Poor JoHN BULL, at the “festive season,”
—as it is humorously called—is like GULLIVER at the mercy of the
Lilliputians, for every {i,j. extortioner takes the opportunity of having
a pull at his pocket. It is a pity that he has allowed himself to be tied
down by custom to such exactions as are usually practised upon him at
Christmas, and, though he has been loosening the bonds for some time
past, he has not yet cast them off altogether.
MR. MAGPIE perch upon a royal hearse, and call all the world about
him, while he chatters lamentation, and now calls out “QUEEN
DowAGER,” and now “PRINCEss CHARLOTTE.” Nay, let MR. MAGPIE,
if he have tongue and brass enough, insinuate that he-MAGPIE—has
been made the depositary of Court secrets as to Court Mourning, upon
which lie, let him rejoice consumedly, but—let not Press Proprietors,
for so much money paid over the counter, print, in Magpie black and
white, the trading abomination. If MAGPIE will turn the commercial
penny upon mock misery and Brummagem woe, Hat least, let the news-
paper proprietor stand with [ADyERTISEMENT] before the grºssness, to
give warning of the nastiness of thrift; not make himself, by lack of
warning, part and parcel of the trading indecency. Let the advance
guard of £ s. d.show that it is wholly an affair of pocket, and not of
pocket-handkerchieſs,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BAKER STREET A PENAL SETTLEMENT,
THE Capers lately going on at the Cape, seem likely to be imitated-
and not without cause—by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood of
Baker Street, who are looking with alarm at the degradation into
which the whole º is thrown, by having in its centre what may
be fairly termed a penal settlement. -.
*The reception * MADAME Tussaud of all the º worst of criminals
—not simply in their habits as they lived, but in their attire as they
hung—is found to be giving a sort of reputation to the whole locality,
and inoculating it—we had almost said, wavinating it—with a morally
poisonous atmosphere.
We should not be at all astonished to hear of the formation of an
Anti-Convict Association in Baker Street as at the Cape, for the purpose
of protesting against the reception of any more # those characters who
are now, as a matter of course, conveyed straight from the jail and the
scaffold to the Wax Work colony. Not even Norfolk Island can make
such a show of murderers, as MADAME Tussaud boasts of in her bills,
where she displays, the names of the MANNINGs and Rush, as, the
manager of a theatre would parade the combination of two or three
“stars” on the same evening. . . - -

mendºus announcement of “ #é tifiers in one night,” to "com

her best to revive the days of this morbid appetite for that which must
be repugnant to every healthy taste; and we could not, therefore,
refuse our sympathy to any rising among the Baker Street populati
with the view to the rescuing of the place from the odium attaching

"I === y
one of THE Effects of the “chamber of HoRRoRs.”
We have heard rumours of an Anti-Convict Association having
| already met, and of resolutions having been formed to strike a blow at
the evil in a legitimate way, by refusing the supplies to the Convict
establishment. If the whole public would,support the Bakerites in
such a laudable resolve, and abstain from furnishing the funds necessary
for maintaining an establishment of which murderers are the prominent
feature, and where, if one malefactor waxes worse than another, he is
sure to find the readier admission;-if, we say, the Baker Street Anti-
Convict Association could º obtain the co-operation of the public in
stopping away, and º the tide of respectable emigration towards
the spot, it would soon be found “not to pay” as a penal settlement,
and the mºst hardened of the criminals in the collection would very
shortly melt into some more respectable character.
It is not altogether impossible that on the arrival of the next cargo
of Convicts at the Bazaar, the Anti-Convict Association will be pre-
#. to assume a determined attitude, in order to prevent, the intro-
uction of further depravity into their degraded neighbourhood.
Should an effort be made to º the Convicts with clothes through
the agency of CALGRAPT, the hangman, it is not unlikely that the
communication will be cut off, or that the functionary in question will
himself be compelled to cut off rather rapidly.

- Morning Chronicle's, “Special Lºndon Cor-
espºndent,” to whºse º ;"| is indebted for the compre-
ensive idea of the inquiry, and whose large intelligence and untiring
energy in the ºvelºpment of this monster wickedness, this wide-
wasting misèry, society cannot too gratefully acknowledge.
The persons, especially the rich patrons of the man-eating slop-seller
—for he is no less-are answerable as accessaries to the selfish iniquity
that destroys the operative, that makes the terrible distinctiºn between
the comfort, and the ghastly wretchedness of his condition. The
“Correspondent” observes:–
“The very dwellings of the poople are sufficient to tell you the wide difference between
the two classes. In the one you occasionally findsmall statues of ShakspeaRE beneath
glass shades; in the other aſſis dirt and fetor. The working tailor's comfortable first-
floor at the west-end is redolent with the perfume of the small bunch of violets that
stands in a tumbler over the mantel-piece; the sweater's wretched garret is rank with
the stench of filth and herrings. The “honourable' part—[the two classes are
distinguished ‘honourable' and “dishonourable")—of the trade are really intelligent
artis while the slop-workers are generally almost brutified with theirincessant toil,
wretched pay, miserable food, and filthy homes."
Thus, when a man rejoices in the very, very cheap garments {".
chased of NEBuchadnezzar. AND Co., his self-complacency should be
somewhat lowered by the thought of the moral wretchedness, and
domestic filth he has done his part to create in the patronage of the
aforesaid NEHugh AnNEzzAR, who—in prose and doggre!—blatantly
“defies competition.” . . . . . - ---
An individual case of misery is given; one that depicts the condition
of the class of slop-workers—the serfs of MºssRs. NFBuchannezzº.
Doing 12 hours' work a day, the man could clear 7s.6d, a week. This
man was sick in what was his bed. The “Correspondent” visited him:
** Look here, cried one of his friends, dragging a cont from off the sick man's bed.
* See here; the man has no covering, and so he throws this garment over him as a
shelter. [It was a new pilot cºat that was to be taken in that evening for the shop.]
I expressed my surprise that the bed of the sickman should be covered with the new
garment, and was informed that such in the winter time was a common practice among
the workpeople. When the weather was very cold, and their blankets had gone to the
pawnshop, the slop-workers often went to bed, I was told, with the sleeves ºf the coat
were making drawn over their arms, or else they would cover themselves with the trow-
sers or paletóts, according to the description of garment they had in hand. The ladies'
riding-habits in particular, I was assured, were used as counterpanes to the poor people's
beds, on account of the quantity of clothin the skirts.”
The sick man is stopt in the narrative of his sufferings. Suddenly
there was
“A loud voice below stairs. One of the slop-servants had come to demand a certain
garment. It had been pawned when completed to keep the sick man's family from
starving, and when the poor fellow was told the cause of the noise below stairs, he
trembled like a leaf, and the perspiration again started in large drops to his forehead.”
With the few facts above stated, the customers of º
and tradesmen of his “defying” class, must wear their coats
trowsers with unexpected sensations..." The MARQUEss ºf —”
must feel, his flesh greep when he thinks that his coat-sleeves haye
goyered the arms of the sleeping tailor in his loathsome garret:
“Lord ’s” blood must tingle when he surveys his trowsers, or
pulls about him his paletót, once the night covering, of the wretched
slop-workers. And then the “ladies' riding-habits!” What a thought
to check the triumph of a canter in Rotten Row, to imagine that the
flowing robe has been used as a counterpane for the filthy slop-worker
and his squalid little ones. - -
Beware of cheap tailors Shun the doors of the NEBuchadnezzars!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW DOES A RAILWAY LOOK UNDER A COM-
MITTEE OF INVESTIGATION?
WHY it looks anything but pleasant. - -
You would scarcely know it to be the same railway that it was a
short twelvemonths ago. But it was happy then; and now it has
scarcely a smiling feature left. It looks prematurel old and rusty.
All its lines, that ought still to have the bounding elasticity of youth
about them—for they are barely out of their teens—are hard and
º sunken, and seem like heavy lines of care, giving its young face
a look of wrinkled childhood, as unpleasant to contemplate as the
Railway Share List. -
Yet we can recollect when it was gay, very gay, and had a joke for
everyone. During the week it was so Iollowed, you fancied it was a
perpetual Greenwich Fair Day, or an everlasting Derby. On a Sunday
it was run after by thousands, and was so proud, it was a difficulty
sometimes to get near it. Hundreds were content to remain outside,
and to look at it with long faces through the railings, thinking them-
selves too happy, if they heard its merry whistle. Mothers held up
their innocent babies to see it; old men hung for hours upon their
crutches to get a Fº at it; and the little dogs assembled
regularly, to bark as its Engine dashed buoyantly along. The very
cows leaped for joy directly they heard its hysterical scream of ecstatic
delight; and horses, sheep, and pigs, and even countrymen, all felt
within them a new impulse, and were violently moved, jumping over
hedges and ditches sometimes, in their mad excitement, so much were
they carried away by the animal spirits of the giddy thing before them,
All that came near it felt its joyful influence. The porters frisked
about., The smart superintendent slammed the doors, with almost a
musical air; the sprightly lampman mostly carried “a light in his
laughing eye;” and the chivalrous guard wore his knowing cap cocked
.# on one ear, and had generally a flower in the corner of his
mouth.
Every now and then, a busy, fat, rounded, Nassau-balloon of a man,
would attract attention by some lively sally, at which were invariably
discharged by all around him several loud Ha! ha's like the favourable
report of double-barrelled guns. He was a Director, and always had
a first-class carriage to himself. He was too big to be shovelled in
with the small dust of other passengers. How proud that great man
always looked! and no wonder, considering what spaniels, almost
licking the bright DAY AND MARTIN off his boots, all the splenuid-
looking officials were to him. It he left his sandwich-box, behind him,
the train was stopped. It he had dropped his pocket-handkerchief, the
train went back or it. If he was too late for dinner, another engine
was sent forward to clear the road for him. A director was something
like a director in those days. As he spoke, all hats flew off with the
practised energy of a sudden gust of wind..., Purses flowed into his
pocket, like sewers into the Thames. Gentleman ran errands;
mothers kissed the tips of his gloves; Lords dunned him for
favours; Dukes prayed that “he would take charge of a few thousands
they really did not know what to do with:” and Bishops were not too
proud to beg of him to be the larder for their supernumerary loaves
and fishes. What is a director at present * Run, ask the deserted
banks of the Hudson' -
The railway altogether is different now... It looks haggard, careworn
seedy—as if it had been going too “fast,” and began to show the il
effects of its career. -
At times it appears positively unhappy, and long attenuated groans
are heard to issue from its deep tunnels, as if the guilty creature had
something on its mind that was driving it to an early grave.
The §. are no longer the same. Their eyes scan their shoe-
strings — the porters hang their heads on their heaving chests; the
arms of the Telegraphic Signs droop pointedly to “Danger,” and every-
thing has a lowering, downcast air, as if it were quite impossible just
at present, for anything connected with railway property to be
looking up. The engine is put on a half-allowance of coals. The
stokers, the policemen, greasemen, guards, all walk about with an air of
injured innocence, as much as to say, “It wasn’t 1, Sir, who did it.”
The little gardens attached to the stations are withered and neglected,
and are too plainly vegetating only in the hope that is ever blooming in
the bosom of MR. MICAwBER, of something “turning up.”
k into one of the once noisy offices. An unwholesome silence per-
wades,the place, broken only by the fitful scratchings of steel pens. The
desks are groaning (grateful word) under, the oppressive weigh of false
leagers. Mysterious conferences, take place in sly, corners in muffled
whispers. Papers are exchanged, long bills examined, heaps of vouchers
sifted and re-siſted; but it is cruelly impossible, the balance wiLL Not
come. . They begin afresh: when out of the surrounding darkness, in
which it is almost vain to distinguish one figure from another, the first
streak of a fraud begins to dawn upon them, and, gradually looming
larger, bursts at last, into the broad, blushing light of day. A chili
runs, through all, which rises into horror, then sinks into despair, as
fraud fast follows fraud. There seems no end to the train.
Suddenly a clerk is called away. He is summoned for examination.
e goes out with the grace of a man that is summoned to an inquest.
As he leaves his comrades their faces grow longer. On his return he
is surrºunded and eagerly questioned. Their faces grow longer still,
and at last drop, lower than their own shares, as they learn that their
fellow clerk is dismissed They wonder with fear whose turn it will
be next?, From that moment a big Sack hangs over the office-door.
And what is that fearful room with the closed door, that every one
passes on tiptoe . Not a person dares look at it. The station-keeper
subdues his whistle as he approaches the awful sanctuary. All hurry
past it, holding their breaths. From time to time, the door is opened
and closed as carefully as if it were a sickroom, and out issues a pale
wan-looking clerk, the apparent messenger of Death. What can it be?
Does the º: dwell there? No, not quite so bad as that, but the
Committee of Investigation sits in it from day to day! BLUE BEARD's
close was not more dreaded. Few Directors that enter that chamber
ever leave it alive.
The scene gets too painful,-so let us turn to the glorious Director.
But where is he?. That is the question, for he cannot be found. He
is summoned but he cannot attend,-he is too ill, and true enough, for
he is, said by report to be no ſonger himself, having fallen away
completely to nothing; a fit end for one whose greatness was only the
stuffing of others, millions of geese having been plucked for the enrich.
ment, of one: , .
When will this state of ºf: come to a terminus P. We hope soon,
for among the many strange things travellers see in their travels, none
is more strange, and none certainly more sad, than that of a Railway
under a Committee of Investigation.
HERE ARE YOUR FINE FRENCH WATERLOOS!
UR London Directory is full of meaning and sug-
estion to the philosopher of quick perceptions.
he study all depends upon a man's address.
What applies to the London Directory, holds
equally good with the Almanac des 25 mille
Addresses. The latter is full of the most
cunning truths that play at bo-peep with the
reader round the corner of every page. The fol-
lowing, which we first spied on the Rue Rivoli,
and after pursuing it along the different Quais,
finally caught at the Hôtel de Ville, is well worth a five minutes' romp
with any one who is fond of a little intellectual fun.
In running through the pages of that most amusing Christmas
volume, we were surprised at the number of streets which have been
Christened after their several victories., The city seemed as if it had
been built upon one immense battle-field. The victories succeeded one
ano her so rapidly, that we could not refrain from smiling at the
military vanity of the thing. After smiling most good-humouredly at
this national egotism, we recollected how fond the French were of
laughing at us for the continual advertisement that is repeated all over
London, of Waterloo ! Waterloo! . Nothing but Waterloo, from the
finest bridge in the world, down to the sºnallest potato-can in the
New Cut.
If we are fond of our Waterloo, how much fonder are our laughing
neighbours of their Waterloos—some of which are so extremely weak
and diluted, that we must, in the same spirit of laughter, call them
Milk and Waterloo.
... We subjoin a sample list of a few of these victories, which, like
NAPOLEON, take their rise from the Directory:—
Quai d'Arcole. Rue Neuve de Trévise.
Pont d'Arcole. Quai de Jéna.
Grande Rue d’Austerlitz. Pont de Jéna.
Pont d'Austerlitz. Passage Isly.
Quai Napoléon. Quai Montebello.
Rue d'Erfuth.
Rue Moscow.
Rue de Navarin.
Rue Mazagram.
Impasse Mazagram.
Passage Mazagran.
Rue Mogador.
Cité de Trévise.
Rue de Trévise.
Rue de Rivoli.
Rue d'Ulm.
Rue d'Aboukir.
&c. &c, &c. &c., &c., &c., &c.
Paris, in fact, is quite running over with a deluge of Waterloos. It
spreads from the Place des Victoires all the way up to the Champ de
Mars, and would probably overflow entire France if it were not checked
in time at the top of the Champs Elysées by the Arc de Triomphe.
Left-Handed Compliment.
THE newspapers, speaking of the sailors who were to have borne the
QUEEN DowAGER's j to the grave, say—“They behaved with great
propriety.” Of course, it was expected that they would sing a song or
dance a hornpipe; and the reporters were correspondingly surprised
at the tars’ “propriety l’”

NELSON'S DAUGHTER ADOPTED BY FRANCE.
OUR LITTLE BIRD, who has never yet been found at fault, informs
us that Louis NAPOLEoN has forwarded a brief address, to be inserted,
in the course of a day or two, in the official Moniteur, to the following
effect:—
“The President of the French nation, in discharge of the high and
solemn function with which he has been invested by the people, desires
to vindicate in an especial manner the magnanimity and generosity of
| France. Genius and valour are of too sublime and dear account in the
heart of every Frenchman, not to be worshipped and acknowledged
under whatsoever sky, and among whatsoever people, they may be
developed. They may have been in their operation hostile, nay,
mischievous to France; the greater the magnanimity of Frenchmen to
do them rightful homage when their active influence shall be a portion
of history—shall belong to the irrevocable Past. France cuts down the
enemy, but she respects, nay, honours the scar that her sword has
left.
“NELsoN was the foe of France. The unmitigable, insatiate foe.
But NELsoN was the child of valour; the incarnation of that heroic
principle that is the sacred fire in the heart of man. NELSON conquered
France on the Nile, off Trafalgar. A French bullet struck the hero,
who fell and died upon the breast of Victory. Peace be with him, and
eternal greenness freshen his laurels'
“NELson bequeathed a child to the care of England. And England,
in her prudery, ignores the bequest. Consistent England, that gilds
| the name of NElson with a munificent pension, and leaves the blood of
NELsoN to chill in penury and neglect ' Let France, then, adopt
HoRATIA—let France take to her bosom the sacred legacy, rejected by
England. Thus nobly will France avenge the discomfiture of the Nile
—thus, on the very hearth of England, re-conquer the memory of
Trafalgar.
“Let all good Frenchmen aid in the magnanimous work. All may
contribute something. Not a sou that will not bring a drop of blushing
blood to the cheek of BRITANNIA.
“The President charges himself with the receipt of subscriptions to
be received at the bureau (to be hereaſter indicated) at the Elysée.”
We guarantee the above as a faithful, may, a severe translation of
the official document about to appear. What will the Iron Duke—
DUKE MULCIBER—say to it, asks OUR LITTLE BIRD,
JUSTICE FOR THE ARMY.
THE subjoined paragraph appeared last week in the Times:-
“We are enabled to announce, upon what we consider the most substantial authority,
that in the ensuing Session of Parliament a strenuous effort will be made to alter the
constitution of naval and military courts-martial, so as to render them more courts of
equity than, as hitherto, courts of honour. In this movement the lead will be taken by
LoRD BROUGHAM.”
At present courts-martial are, in every respect, as unlike as possible
to courts of equity, and partake a great deal too much of the dunder:
head, if not the drum-head character. May LoRD BROUGHAM succeed
in assimilating the former courts to the latter in all particulars but
one! If, however, they are rendered altogether like the Court of
Chancery, the inconvenience will be that there will certainly be no end
of them. Still this difficulty will be easily met by making the illustrious
HARRY himself the Lord Chancellor at War, in which case he will
doubtless give a suitable quick march to the proceedings of these
military tribunals.
Protectionists Protected.
THE Times' Express from Paris announces the acquittal of certain
persons who had been “prosecuted by the Attorney-General for havin
conspired to overthrow the Government.” Fancy LoRD STANLEY an
MR. DISRAELI being tried on a like accusation. Protectionists should
at least be thankful that we enjoy free trade in politics.
DISCOVERY IN DENTAL SURGERY.
MR. PUNCH, 85, Fleet Street, begs to introduce an ENTIRELY NEw
DEscFIPTION OF TEETH, being the Teeth of the Facts which Protec-
tionist Orators are continually making their assertions in.
WOL, XVII,
WHO’S THAT KNOCKING AT THE DOOR 3
EveRYBody has heard by this time of the new mansion in Piccadilly,
built for himself by MR. HoPE, and everybody has also heard with dis-
i. that some shabby dog, or, as our artist insinuates, some mischievous
onkey, has wrenched off, under cover of nocturnal darkness, the
highly finished knocker. Some mystery has been excited as to who is
the thief; and though we cannot hit upon the man-we wish we could,
for the blow should be a severe one—we can hazard a guess, at any rate.
In the first place, he must have been a fellow without a single rap, or
he never would have stolen a knocker. It is a pity, by the by, that,
when he was at the knocker, there was no one at the bell to ring his
nose for him.
THE CHRISTMAS ANNUAL.
THIS Annual, which is elegantly bound in the *iº has
been brought out with, the usual unfailing effect: It is full of the
nicest things; , and, when cut up, will be worthy to lie }. any
entleman's table. The frontispiece is very pointed; and, when the
ead is boldly taken off, it will form one of the handsomest plates of
BAcon we have feasted our eyes upon for a long time. . The body of
the Annual promises a rich treat; but we have not had leisure yet to
#. through it. We feel not the slightest doubt, however, that, when we
iñº it, we shall find it has got the real stuffin it. -
his splendid annual is also adorned with a nice little tale, which,
towards the end, takes a most unexpected turn, and concludes with a
well-rounded flourish. The other parts will be devoured by every person
of true taste, and altogether, we have rarely seen so bulky a volume
that contained so many tid-bits. -
The thing, by this time, is looked upon as a perfect prize, and is no
sooner seen than it fetches £5, which we consider a small sum for a
work that has so much in it. It was on view for three days, at the
Smithfield Cattle Show. We need º inform our readers that the
title of this splendid Christmas Annual, which has been continued now
for so many years with the greatest success, is—PRINCE ALBERT's PIG.
Probable Etremmes on New Year's Day at Paris.
MEssRs. THIERs, PIERRE BuonapaRTE, ET CIE., went out on New
Year's Day, and having met several of their friends in the Bois. de
Boulogne, made the usual advances to them, and then, presented Fire.
These pointed little presents were not only received, but returned, on
the opposite side, in the warmest manner. After these little ºffaires de
casur, the parties shook hands and separated the best of friends.
OUR FRIENDS THE MOSQUITOS.
THERE appears to exist at the Foreign Office a disposition to embroil
this country with the American Government in behalf of the KING OF
The Mosquitos. Surely England might as well leave to fight his own
battles a potentate who can raise a swarm of such subjects about the
ears of any aggressor.

CHRISTMAS-BoxEs have for ages ranked, amongst the festivities of the season,
though the festivity must, come more, home to those who have to receive them, than
those who have to º them. Gentlemen have long indulged in the festivities of
the latter kind, and they now intend (for the times are so bad, and we should like to
. when they were not ?) to try a small taste of the festivities of the former
quality.
We have been told of an instance of a nobleman, who keeps his carriage, but does
not have his liveries made of Long, Noses AND SON, whose intention it is to start on
Boxing-Day, and regularly take the round of all his tradesmen in order to solicit
Christmas-Boxes of them.
He will first call on his butcher, and demand a few Bank notes of him, for the
enormous price he has charged him all through the year for meat.
He will next call on his grocer, on his bootmaker, on his fruiterer, and poulterer, and
demand of them a few Christmas boxes, handing in his card and crest as proofs that he
is the regular gentleman whom they have had the honour of serving and overcharging
for the last twelvemonths.
After that he will call on his undertaker, but mo, he will defer that call as long as
he can, as he would rather be without a box of any kind from him, for fear of getting
into the wrong box. -
By these means the Fine English Gentleman of the present day may be able to live
within the compass of his means, without being compelled to box the compass in all
manner of means in order to bring himself round at the end of the year.
The nobleman in question will be known by the mark of a strawberry-leaf on his left
arm. No other is genuine.
ENGLAND'S AND NELSON'S EXPECTATIONS REALISED.
We are happy to announce that NElson and England are at last about to have
heir expectations realised, for every man and every boy engaged on the column in
Trafalgar Square is beginning to do his duty. For some time the shaft was at a stand-
still for want of capital, but, more recently, the column has actually been standing
destitute in Trafalgar Square for want of a little out-door relief, in the shape of the
base-relief needed for the pedestal. -
This relief is at last forthcoming, and though it has been dealt out with rather a
slow hand, we,are happy to, say that the Nelson monument is not much longer destined
to be a “baseless fabric,” but it ma , ere very long, be expected to form one of the
leading columns of the Times. The lions are now É. prepared as a grand addition
to the existing lions of London, and the delay in their execution arises from the very

potentates of the woods and forests, may happen to be concerned,

No longer a harvest can reap,
By a cool application for boxes.
Such impudent claims on the purse
By many are doomed set at nought te be;
And here we our burden reverse,
Singing, “Christmas is quite what it ought to be.”
Though wholesome the downfall may be
Of customs whose end is extortion,
At Christmas the hand should be free,
Not numbed by the coldness of caution.
Of beef, of plum pudding, of beer,
Permit not the neediest short to be :
To all here's a happy new year,. . .
Whose Christmas has been what it ought to be.
GOOD SPORT |
UNDER the above promising title, we find recorded
in the Sunday Times, that “two Gents lately shot, in
Glen Urquhart, 436 rabbits.”
Now, what the sport of shooting near upon 500 ani-
mals in one day can be, we cannot possibly imagine.
But, of course, we all have different notions of sport.
We really believe there are milk-hearted gentlemen
who would drive oxen from Smithfield Market to the
slaughter-house, and there dispatch them by the hun-
dred, and call it “ º sport.” What these lovers
of sport are to do, when the Game Laws are abolished,
we are at a painful loss to imagine. They must, take
to the shambles, or hire a fine preserve in Cephalonia,
with the right of shooting over peasants, or follow
the French army in Algeria, in order to sport upon the
Moors. If 500 rabbits, are considered Good Sport,
we suppose 1000 would be looked upon as the Height
of Heavenly Bliss. If we recollect right, there is no
shooting in Utopia. This omission would be fatal to
the two Gents; for they could not conceive a Paradise
without rabbits.

PUNCHPS REVIEW.
“The Book of Booty, with Steal Engravings.”
Published and to be had of all Butchers, Under-
takers, Waiters, and a large number of House-
a hold Servants.
§ This “Book of Booty” is a very seasonable
work, and will no doubt be in the hands of all
families., . Indeed, no housekeeper's library can
be complete without it. The contributors, it is
plain, write under assumed names, but there is
no mistaking the identity of the authorship. The
tale entitled "Sirloin Bull” is from the steel skewer of a yº
butcher, who, in his sharp and trenchant way, pleasantly, shows the
manner of “cutting up,” as he calls it, the monster public into the
most profitable joints. The portrait of the Butcher is in the line
manner, in the style of MR. Doo.
“The Ostrich Plume,” y'an Undertaker, who boasts that he serves
...the nobility and gentry,” is a charming development of burial profits,
The grave is shown to be the true
religious necessity of silk hat-bands insisted upon with particular
solemnity. There is also salt in the motto adopted by the Undertaker,
and jº addressed to the young and enterprising of the trade,
—it is this: “The Early Blackbird catches the early worm.” .
“ The Pickled Walnut,” by a Waiter of 40 Years' standing, is a
withering denunciation of the meanness of the Diners-Out, who have
appeared in the Times, couched in the spicy guise of apologue. A
melancholy wag, indicating his right to coppers in a Latin thesis on
... Date Obolum Bellysario,”—signs himself an “Im-pennytent Waiter.”
This is yery poor, and shows the desperation of the class.
Punch cannot enumerate all the articles in “The Book of Booty.” He
must, however, allude to the “Christmas Boar,” whose antiquity and
household value are variously asserted by various pens from the
Butler to the Kitchen-maid.
It is needless for Punch to recommend at this season “The Book, of

THE LAY OF THE LITTLE BARRISTER,
I’M a little Barrister, taking little fees;
Raising knotty little points, and signing little pleas;
Making little motions in a little Court;
Causing by my speeches not a little sport,
I’m a little Barrister, in my little wig,
Feeling rather little, when looking very big;
No one knows my modesty—but my little self,
For I feel I’m little more than on a little shelf.
I’m a little Barrister, in my little gown,
Getting now, I must avow, not a little brown:
As I’m called a Junior, you would little guess
I’m fifty and a little more—rather than little less.
I’m a little Barrister, in my little home,
in to which at Camden Townſ from Chambers r0am ;
ith my little children climbing up my knee,
As with a mutton chop I make a dinner of my tea.
Though annoyed with little notes demanding little bills,
I do my little utmost to conquer little ills; -
But often to my countenance there comes a little smile,
As I think that all our troubles last a very little while.
THE KING OF THE MOSQUITOS.
. THE last, advices from the Mosquitos contain an account of an
interview between an American sea-captain and the Mosquito, King.
His Majesty appears to be an extraordinary animal, a sort of odd-fish,
and quite worthy to take his place by the side of the Queen Bee in
natural history. His costume is described as rather picturesque than
finished, though he was clothed from top to toe, or rather from head to
heel, for he wore a cocked hat and a pair of gilt spurs; the uniformity
of this uniform being broken only by a red sash round his waist.
The º: adds, that the Sovereign was rather intoxicated, and, in
fact, the KING OF THE Mosquitos i. been evidently very busy in
bussing bottles. He was seated on an º cask, by yº of throne
having no doubt absorbed the contents into the system, for he roiled
about in the course of conversation, and his throne, by a sudden revo-
lution, rolled from under him. The Mosquito Monarchy is evidently in
a rather unstable condition, and we scarcely wonder at it when we find
a spirit of fermentation—the cask had contained whisky—taking pos.
session of the head of the nation.

at the Street-door of No. —.
Crawl (suppressing an impulse to whistle). They’re a precious long
while inside afore they bring out the gin. . -
Creep. Shouldn’t wonder if they ain’t going to cut off our gin too.
Pretty games they want to pl º funerals, now !
Crawl. Cut off our gin § , what’s Christian 'terment coming to,
after that ? -
Creep. Shouldn’t wonder. Why, there’s a pack of heathens writing in
the Times aginst the use of feathers. No feathers at a funeral! Where
do such people, when #º die, expect to go to ? -
Crawl. Well, once I ... as soon thought of seeing a peacock
without his tail, as a decent burying without feathers. Feathers is
what respectability goes for What next?
Creep. It’s all §: wickedness of the times that gets worse and worse.
he fact is, human natur’ is now so had and so greedy, that it grudges
every penny spent upon the dead, that it may lay it out upon itself.
It’s what they call ammon worship and—'pon my soul, I think they
do intend to stop our gin!
Crawl. We’ll give 'em five minutes more, and then knock:
Creep. It’s a worship of money, that makes people despise what I
call the rights of the worm. There's infidels as grudges a, cambric
pillar for the dear deceased, and s it wrong he should have a
mattress, when so many of the living have nothing better than door-
steps. They think five pounds too much for a nice lead coffin—and five
pound ten a waste upon a stout elm case, as will last for eyer, covered
with the best superfine cloth, in which there isn't a bit of shoddy, or
what the perfane call devil's dust,
Crawl. It’s disgustin’. -
Creep. They make no more account of a hearse and mourning-coach
than common wehicles. I expect to see the day when hearses and
mourning-coaches will be upon any coach-stand, to be called of when
wanted, to do the job by the distance.
Crawl. Like a hack or a Hansom.
Creep. Percisely. And then for nails and ornaments to Coffins, that
our fathers' fathers were buried in, like Christian people, I expect to
see nothing but four deals in the rough, to be bought at a minute, like
a packing-case. ... Agin, for the silk hatbands for the undertaker, and
the sextin, and the clerk—things that don't come to more than a dirty
guinea and a half—they’ll come down to dyed calico, if they don't
repeal 'em altogether. And them, as I say for feathers, feathers is
almost a sight for sore eyes.. . - -
Crawl. Well, it’s my 'pinion—and I’ve long been coming to it—
that the cholera, that some folks say was brought upon us–which was
a godsend for our bis'ness—was not pervoked by the money given to
the Catholics, or the words taken from the money, I mean the florin;
but all on account of the want of proper respect that’s coming up to
the dear deceased in the argiment of funerals. Depend upon it, as for
the cholera, feathers was at the bottom of it. - - - - - - -

It is reported that MR. John O'ConnELL is about to retire from

CHRISTMAS WAITS.
AMONG the Waits that make their appearance at this season of the
year, we have observed the following:—
MR. DISRAELI waiting for something to turn up.
The Farmers waiting for Protection. - -
The Railway Shareholders waiting for a dividend.
Naval Veterans waiting for promotion. .
Every Body waiting for the good time coming.
THE HEAVIEST CHRISTMAS WAIT or ALL-Ninepence for a pound
weight of Butcher's Meat I
THE SHOPS AT CHRISTMAS.
How they blue out on the Winter night, how warmly and how cheer-
ully
THow º fied their eyes at them, how smallboys peep askance and
eariully - -
How poverty, heart-sick for work, beguiles perforce its angry leisure
With gazing through those windows sadly, at their pomp, and pride,
and pleasure
See those velvets, darkly damasked, TITIAN-like, so warm and mellow;
Shawls of Indian woof barbaric, barred with black, and red, and yellow ;
Silks and satins gem-like changing, filmy gauzes flung in showers,
Riº winding, rainbow-hued, like tropic snakes through tropic
Owers. -
Here’s another, through its curtains see those nimble hands preparing
Silk and satin, gauze and velvet, into forms for ladies’ wearing—
Armoury of women's weapons, hung with killing caps and bonnets, .
Future . for many a face that, thanks to them, may prompt its
SOnllets. - -
Then the goldsmith's gorgeous window, all with precious metals glowing,
Qaryen chalice, frosted flagon, sately candelabra showing;
Mellow gold of ancient fashion, flashing bracelets, bronzes sober;
Stately mazers, telling tales of ruby wine or brown October.
Then the grocer's spicy store-house, tempting poor men's Christmas
money -
Crystal sugar, candied citrom, clotted currants, raisins sunny, , .
With its porcelains quaintly figured, chests and caddies, and devices,
Brute and human Chinese monsters, and the well-penned cards of prices.
Then º of the Twelfth Cakes what words may suffice for
In
Or the blue rosetted prize-joints, with their tallowy mountains swelling?
Qr the poulterer's, turkey tapestried; or the oyster-shops, where study
Gets perplexed amid the barrels, and the rows of lobsters ruddy?
Yes, the Christmas shops are splendid, and to all the senses cheering,
Though the fog be hanging yellow, or the sleet through streets careering;
And there is a wholesome pleasure to our hard-worked English reason,
With all gifts of man's contriving thus to grace the joyous season.
Were’t not well to pass a moment from the wares and wealth we
write of,
To some sights and scenes, that Christmas joy should, least of joys,
make light of
From the shops turn to the streets, and mark, amid their motley
thronging,
The many shrunken cheeks, whereto there seems no joy belonging.
See that man, with wife and children, creeping, separate and sadly,
Never looking at those splendours, or if glancing, glancing, madly;
As if cursing all that wealth that spares no penny from its heaping,
To help them to more food and clothes, and fire, and place ſor sleeping.
That gorgeous velvet, that makes pale all tissues where they’ve laid it—
What if the weaver's passing by, whose wasted fingers made it?
Oh, richly broidered are those scarves; but think of her who, sighing,
Drew the sore stitches—o'er her work for hunger slowly dying.
Capital vies with capital, to add wonders to our city,
Each underbidding each, without remorse, or ruth, or pity;
Still doth labour crowd the market, and still takes the task that’s
proffered— -
Curses, and works, and curses still the less’ning pittance offered.
And so about our splendours hangs a blight that spreads, till nei her
Employer or employed is found, but each is wroth with either;
Till no love remains of high to low—no trust of low in higher, .
And the more we grasp the golden fruit, the abyss yawns ever nigher.
Yes, these are sorry thoughts to be haunting Christmas season,
For lack of human brotherhood is to Christmas special treason;
When Love to man did light on earth, and there was joy in heaven-
Oh, for the spirit of that time more English hearts to leaven!
“Stands Scotland where it Did P”
“WHA sae base as be a slave?” says the Caledonian ballad; but that
Liberty has received her death-blow in Scotland is proved by the
Caledonian Mercury. Our Northern contemporary states that—
“Thomas Dowling, a dumb man, was, on Saturday, convicted of committing a breach
of the peace, and sentenced to ten days' imprisonment."
Farewell to Scottish freedom, no longer secured by the Palladium
of a fair and impartial trial by jury. , THOMAs Dowling, being dumb,
was, of course, condemned without a hearing.
