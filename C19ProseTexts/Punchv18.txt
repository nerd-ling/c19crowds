R. PUNCH presents his profoundest sense of admiration and respect to HIs Roy AL HIGHNess
Prince ALBERT.
MR. PUNCH, having completed another Volume—always a national event—ventures to address His
Royal Highness, as the originator of the Exhibition of the World’s Industry in 1851; convinced that, as
His Royal Highness is deeply interested in the successful issue of that great endeavour, His Royal Highness
will learn with peculiar delight the intentions of MR. PUNCH with reference to his own proposed contributions
on that eventful occasion.
MR. PUNCH proposes to send, to be enshrined in the Crystal Palace, his Nineteen Volumes, superbly
printed on sheep Vellum—the sheep segregated and fed on the aromatic herbage of Mount Hymettus—
and illuminated with colours of gem-like lustre. The Nineteen Volumes will be bound in the skins of
unicorns; with, at least, one phoenix feather in each, by way of marker.
But the pageant contemplated by M.R. PUNch—the procession from his cell, 85, Fleet Street, to the
Great Glass Hive in Hyde Park—will, MR. P. humbly believes, afford to the foreign nations, awhile boarding
and lodging in England, matter of most valuable instruction and most abounding amusement.
Even as the Camel carries a copy of the Koran to Mecca, so will each and every of the Nineteen
Volumes be borne from 85, Fleet Street, by some animal of significant species, (the animal richly caparisoned,
and duly mounted and paged,) to the Palace in Hyde Park.
Will your Royal Highness vouchsafe to MR. PUNch two little minutes, that he may just hint, in general
phrase, at his preparations for the great event?
Volume I. will be deposited in a superbly carved chest, to be borne upon an Elephant; the Lord
MAYor himself—as Punch's fellow-citizen—having offered to ride on the neck of the beast, and to take every

iv PREFACE.
charge of the precious tome. The Elephant is selected as typical of the united strength and gentleness of
PUNCH-of the power that can root up the upas, or play with a rose-bud.
Volume II. will be carried by an Ostrich. And wherefore ? Is not the pen of PUNCH as white as
the primest plume of the bird?
Volume III. upon a Lion—descended in a direct line from the original British; and though, when
roused, pouring forth a roar quite equal to the earliest note of his great progenitor, nevertheless, a Lion in
whom silent magnanimity is the greater quality than noise.
Volume IV. will be consigned to the Hippopotamus : only a just tribute to the good-nature that
redeems ugliness, and turns what would otherwise be a monster, to quite a pet.
And thus, MR. Punch proposes to lay his Nineteen Volumes on the backs of beasts and birds, too
various for your Royal Highness's patience to be particularised. Suffice it to say, there will be the graceful
Stag, the grisly Bear, the massive Brahmin Bull—ditto John, represented by a distinguished amateur from
Smithfield; the Giraffe, the Alpaca, the Porcupine; and, saving your Royal Highness, the very cream and pith
of the animal world, for the nonce made active members of the Parcels' Delivery Company; and guided and
waited upon by a whole army of riders and attendants, all of them living representatives of the thousands
of pictorial individuals that at the present moment people the pages of PUNch, as thickly as fire-flies burn
in a tropic might.
When the procession shall have reached its Crystal destination, the Nineteen Volumes—to triumphant
blasts of trumpets—will be duly deposited within the shrine prepared for them. A guard of honour, composed
of individuals of all nations—so that all the inhabitants of all the globe shall be represented, clustered around
the marvellous work—shall take their post, to be duly relieved, pending the Exhibition. Already MR. PUNch
has a thousand letters, from writers in cvery nook of the world, supplicating the enjoyment of such honour.
And thus, your Royal Highness, you may assure yourself—from the admiring and loyal zeal of PUNch—
of a new glory for the Exhibition of 1851. And that the thought of it may cast an added light, and impart a
newer pleasure to your yet merrier Christmas, and your still happier New Year,
Is the wish of your Obedient humble Servant,
àºund.

HERE’S TO THE WOLUME.
Tone of the recent banquets given by Punch to himself, in comme-
moration of the commencement of his Nineteenth Wolume, he had
the honour of proposing his own health, and returning his own thanks for
his own compliment. In reply, he begged leave to excuse himself from
| rising, as he was already on his legs, and always meant to be, but, with
his own permission, he would sing himself a song, if he would permit
himself. The proposition from himself having been acceded to by him-
self, with a hearty inward cheer, or chuckle, Mr. Punch proceeded to
chaunt, with a voice as clear as chanticleer, the following Bacchanalian:—
Here's to the Volume of jolly Nineteen,
or June, eighteen hundred and fifty;
Here’s to old JUDY., of humour the queen,
And ToBy, the house-dog so thrifty.
Let the wine flow,
Rapid or slow,
I warrant 'twill prove an excuse for bon mot.
Here’s to the artist whose cuts we so prize,
Here’s to the writer of fun, Sirs,
Here’s to the brain that the satire supplies,
Here’s to the man with the pun, Sirs.
Let the wine flow, !.
Here’s to the SIBTHORP, who lets his tongue go,
As if he were playing bob cherry.
Here’s to the HUME, that very old Joe,”
At which we have laughed and made merry.
Let the wine flow, &c.
Let them be clever, or let them be dull,
I tickle them all with my feather;
So, pour me a bumper of ink out, quite full,
And I’ll toast them and roast them together.
Let the wine flow,
Rapid or slow,
I warrant ’twill prove an excuse for bon mot.
Who's my Uncle?
A various and important controversy is now raging in the Chronicle
—whether Louis-PHILIPPE, when he dropt upon his knee at Stowe to
Louis XVIII., was addressed as “ my, nº hew,” and whether the said
Louis-PHILIPPE replied “my uncle!” rtain correspondents affirm
that the Duke could not call the King, his “uncle,” there being no
avuncular relationship between them: others maintain that, “particu-
larly as regards Royal houses,” the term uncle is indefinitely used on
the continent, as a term of affection; even, we presume, as it is some-
times used in houses, not Royal, in England; when folks speak of certain
objects, bearing peculiar interest, they name them as being under the
especial guardianship of their “uncle.”

THE INSOLENCE OF BEADLEDOM.
... BEADLEDOM, has been for some years growing upon us, until at last
it has come to be looked upon as one of the Institutions of the country,
and as such it is liable to abuse, for the guarding against which all our
vigilance is required. Beadledom, once confined to the parish, has
crept into our squares, insinuated itself into our arcades, and, indeed,
me so general, that to say we are literally swarming with beadles
would be no extravagant figure. . As an Institution, when it grows with
vigour, is liable to run into prurient excess, so the increase of beadle-
dom has been attended with results, in some respects, deplorable.
The cocked hat has been cocked up somewhat too high, and the staff
has been brandished a little too boldly in these latter days, when,
indeed, we might have expected that one of CARLYLE's latter-day pam-
hlets would have been devoted to beadledom. Its insolence -
owever, received a blow, at the hands of the respectable Court of
Aldermen, whose wives and daughters were, in a recent instance, treated,
by mistake, as if they formed part of the public in general. It is the
usual practice of edom to cringe to authority, and play the Jack-
in-office to the outer world; and as a flunky may not know all the
members of a numerous family, so a beadle may now and then make a

W. are i. at seeing the humbled head of abashed beadledom
bruised by the hand of º: authority, and though it is only civic in-
solence that has felt the blow, welfeel that Jack-in-office-dom all over
the world has received a lesson which will not be lost upon the whole
universe of underlings, who generally act upon the principle that the
i. ºil, they legitimately possess, the more will they assume to

A Vehicle for Satire.
THERE were, of course, hundreds of equipages of all sorts at the
House of Lords on the night of the grand j on Lord STANLEY’s
motion, but it was remarked by ourselves as a very odd coincidence
that the carriage of the CHEVALIER BUNSEN was immediately followe
by a very shabby BROUGHAM, which gave the idea of a most disrepu-
table turn out.
Prize Medal for the Exhibition of 1851.
We are informed that the legend, selected for the Prize Medal is,
“England hopes for with all the world.” The obverse is to be
BRITANNIA with a Young, Lamb, vice the Old Lion. What if, for the
reverse, the Committee chose a head of PALMERSTON, sparrant, with
the legend, “Memo me impunè lacessit.”
PAVILION OF 1851.
EVERAL persons are of opinion that the prevailing
character of these, desi which have been shown
º that eminently Civil Institute of Engineers—is the
absence of any character at all. -
There is the long design—of the early English Shed
character, extremely plain—ugly in the highest degree:
There is ditto with domes, loo like a system of
gigantic rat-traps. There seem to be only two ob.
jections to a dome of the size proposed in most of
these designs. The first is, that it is very doubtful
whether it can be erected at all, and the second, that
it will be of no possible use if erected. The Com-
mittee have, therefore, determined on having such a
dome. Then there are the florid composite desigms,
which are in no style at all, being of all styles together.
Soyer has of course sent a plan, which ought,
properly, to be called a recipe. e illustrious man
is bent on becoming an Architectural as well, as a
Gastronomic Regenerator. His design is remarkable
for the prominence given to the culinary department;
and ps, if the dome proposed by the Committee
could be turned upside down, the illustrious chef
might make it useful as a soup-kettle of all nations.
SoYER clearly sees in the Exposition a glorious
opportunity for º: the industry of the kitchen

Who served in the Peninsula—is now an aged man-

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE NINTH.
MRS. MOUSER POLITELY BEGS THE ATTENTION OF LORD ASHLEY.
HEARING, Mr. Punch, to my great pride—and what aunt PEAcock
called a proper pride, I was always proud to confess to ; for pride, as
she used to say, to human creatures, is like wings to a bird, there’s no
etting up in the world without it—hearing, Mr. Punch, that my little
unday Bill of Parliament, with which I was so bold as to trouble you
last week, has been taken in the most affable manner by LORD AshLEY,
and what the Exeter Hall beadle calls his Lordship's Bird of Paradise
Tail, meaning, as he says, no disrespect to MR. DE NEwgATE, MR.
STUMPTREE, and such others ;-hearing, as I say, that what I must
call my little maiden effort at a Bill—for ¥ousen says it's a word I’ve
still a right to in such amatter—has set LoRD AsHLEY and his friends
a-thinking how to give proper effect to every one of my claws, I am
still more emboldened to go on, putting Sunday in decent mourning, for
the benefit of my fellow-creatures, whether they will be benefited or no.
Supposing IORD AshLEY is determined to put Sunday into a strait-
waistcoat, what has Sunday to do, but to sit down and accommodate
itself to the clothing? His Lordship knows best what is fittest for
Sunday in this world; and has, no doubt, as they sayin the newspapers,
intelligence, private and exchusive, from the next. We ought to bless
ourselves, as the beadle says, that we’ve such a pillow of camphor
among us--such spikemard in the House of Commons, such Bank
incense to keep Parliament from corruption.
And therefore it is—whatever MoUSER might say to the contrary—
that I’ve kept awake and restless these two nights for the good of my
country, and out of the highest respect to LORD AsHLEY in particular.
I feel, as I tell MoUSER, that every female ought to be with his Lord-
ship in his struggle with the Sabbath. When the dear good man has
º and steamboats against him, we of the weaker sex—as man
in his conceit (and it’s just like his impudence!) calls us—we of the
tenderer sex ought never to rest until to a woman we’re with him.
The prºper way to begin with Sunday—as I say to MoUSER—is in the
kitchen I Cold meat is the first step to a pure state. The roasti
jack, as I observe, is the prime mover of ic sin: it works, thoug
nobody sees it—but it does work for all that, with the steam-engine
on railways, with steamboats, and with the penny post. Stop the
Sabbath roasting-jack, and you bind Row LAND HILL over in chains
to keep the peace all the Sunday. -
And, therefore—at the Fancy Sackcloth Sabbath Fair, which is about
to be held, but of which I shan’t say another syllable at this moment
—therefore arm’t LoRD AsHLEY’s blade-bones mat’rally expected to
carry all, before 'em! For it is well known to, all his Lordship's
kitchen that he always—Qut of example to the nobility and gentry who,
somehow, won't follow him—always keeps a cold Sunday. I’d defy
any living creature, with the sharpest of eyes, let him watch the
whole blessed day, to see a single whiff of smoke come out of any of his
Lordship's Sunday chimmies. Wii his Lordship, for these five years
past, a cold shoulder of mutton is the Sunday dish—and all to his glory!
Which brings me to the blade-bones. When I was a girl, I remember
reading about a BARON TRENOK who married some Emperor's sister
against his will, and was seized upon in the very first step of the honey-
moon and shut up in a cell, where he cut all sorts of fancy-work upon
his tin mugs; which mugs fetch more than virgin gold. Well, the
beadle of the Hall tells me—and though MoUSER won't believe it, I’ll
be sworn for every syllable—that there’s Exeter Hall, with portraits of
LORD.ASHLEY, MR. DE NEwgATE, MR. STUMPTREE, and others,
beautifully cut on each of the cold shoulder-of-mutton blade-bones of his
Hºlº which, with a running text going round ’em in a hemlock

family being expected to feel comfortable without one.
But, Mr. Punch, supposing that at the Fancy Sackcloth Sabbath
Fair about to be held, as I hear, in the Thames l—being a com-
fortable and serious e, quite away from flaunting i. daylight—
supposing that the HoN. Miss WERJuice, who has kindly undertaken the
Blade-bone Stall, has all his Lordship's bones for the last five years, why
how many will that be? Let's see; for after all, as Mouseſ, says, not
that I quite believe him, “the basis of every moral object is arithmetic;”
let’s see the number:-
A shoulder of mutton once a week for a twelvemonth 52
Multiply by five years • . . . . . 5
Total blade-bones . . . . . . . . 260
Now, taking, as MoUSER, says, morals at the lowest ebb, and sup-
posing every cut and carved shoulder-blade fetches only three º,
this will give us—. 260
3
Price of blade-bones at £3 . . . . . £750
expected to bring any amount of money; no really pious
Well, with this—we'll call it eight hundred pounds, for of course
many people won't think of taking change out of their five-pound-notes
—with this eight hundred pounds, I propose that we shall buy a
iece of ground in the very heart of London—if it has a heart, which
doubt—and having bought it, that we (that is, a Society, that’s as
easily hatched out of the Hall—the beadle assures me—as a dove's
egg’s hatched under MR. CANTELO) that we make over the whole plot
to LoRD AsHLEY, to rear a yº Sunday upon after his own heart,
entirely for the ... out his own will and pleasure, and to the con-
. º the stiffnecked and vain-glorious of all Sabbath-breaking
gland.
“MousPR,” said I, wanting a name. “When we’ve bought the plot,
what shall we call it?”
“AshLEYopolis,” said MoUSER; and though I don’t know what it
means, it sounds well, and, as the beadle observed, rolls full out of the
mouth, like double out of a bottle.
AsHLEyoPolis—built upon Sunday blade-bones—will have a moral in
the very foundation that is quite reviving to think of when we remember
the beginnings of some places. Why, Mr. Punch, there’s nothing in
all Pilgrim’s Progress like it. And won’t it in a space of London—don't
| think we could get Smithfield –like a lump of ...i. help to
eep all sweet and wholesome about it? Then his Lordship can reall
show us what he means to make of Sunday—and folks be edified an
converted accordingly.
Whilst the Fancy Sackcloth Fair is only upon the carpet, I can't be
expected to go fully into it; but as I feel my thoughts upon the matter
growing like mustard-seed, you must allow me—money being the great
matter—to offer another notion that’s come into my head, to show how
a handsome sum might be raised upon his Lordship's Fancy Portrait.
And—if you please—in this way.
It was only yesterday that I went to the Zoological Gardens to see
the doings of the Arab Snake Charmers, JABAR ABOU HAIJAB and his
friend, with the horrid reptiles of the establishment. Tt was altogether
curious, and pleasant, i dreadful to see JABAR take up adders and
rattlesnakes and tie 'em into true lovers' knots, and put 'em round his
legs, like any Knight of the Garter. As for boas, he minded 'em no
more than ! - -
Well, Mr. Punch, the thoughtless and giddy world, with mouths wide
º wondered, and that was all. Not so with your humble servant.
No, Sir; I flatter myself. I looked a little deeper. Not a single snake
that, as the poet says, I didn’t point a moral with his tail! And
for the charmer himself, I saw no JABAR Abou HAILAB from stony
* but in my mind's looking-glass, LoRD.ASHLEY, Member for

Yes, Mr. Punch, there was his Lordship, and there—that Tost-Office
Snake, only in the shape of the worst serpent of the lot—RowLAND
Hiii! There was the Charmer from Bath, making no account at all of
the speckled reptile—(and if I didn't see, thousands and thousands of
Post-Office i. worked and embroidered in his skin, I never saw any-
thing!)—but twisting him round and round; and at last, tying him in a
double knot—(as he has done in the House of Commons) and throwing
him in a corner, to untie himself if he can! -
That is what I said, Mr. Punch; and that is what I should like the
people of all England to see. Therefore, I humbly º to one of
our artists, or any other Royal Academy man, to draw a portrait of
QRD AsHLEY, the Post-Office Snake Charmer: showing his Lordship
tying up the Serpent Row1AND HILL in a Tyburn Knot, as a Sunday
Moral for all Chimney Pieces. - - -

DURING the late trial sittings in the New House of Commons, it was
remarked that Sir Robert Peri, shifted his seat repeatedly, sitting
alternately on both sides of the House. -
What a pity it is that no special accommodation has been provided
for SIR Robert, who, with his accustomed relish for “three courses,”
finds only “two courses” provided for in the benches of the New

“WE—RoRERT KEELEY and Edwarp WRIGHT-find in the Times
the subjoined paragraph in reference to the motion of LoRD BROUGHAM
to turm M. H. the Prussian Minister, out of the Peeresses'
Gallery of the House of Lords.
“‘Our brief report of Lond Brough AM's speech can give but a faint idea of the
scene. Imagine WRIGHT at the Adelphi, or KEELEY uttering a tissue of coarse drolleries,
and giving effect to every point by contortions of face and figure; and still the image
will fall short of the reality. The gaunt-figure of the noble and learned lord, as with
his strong Border “burr” he delivered his points, must be brought before the
imagination.'
“Whereas the above-drawn parallel, in which it is attempted to place
us in the same point of view, as professional comedians, with HENRY
LoRD BRough AM, amateur low comedy man to the House of Lords, is
highly detrimental to our professional character as actors, and singularly
unpleasant to our feelings as men, we protest against the repetition of
any such parallel as untrue to the purpose intended, and cruelly unjust
to ourselves. And for these, among other especial reasons:—
“We materially differ from Lohn BRough AM, inasmuch as we consci-

This amusement derives its title partly from the circumstance that
the scene of it is one of the Royal Parks ly from its fun consisting
in making_fools or #. of the British Public. The present long
evenings afford great facilities for the diversion under notice; which is
got up by the gate-keepers of the Green-Park, for the delight of the
rabble. The game is played in the manner following:—As many pas-
sengers as may present themselves are let into the Green-Park at #.
Park Corner up to 10 o'clock. At 10 precisely the gates are closed,
and the gate-keepers take their departure. The Park remains shut
until 12, when a gate is opened to relieve guard, and the imprisoned
Public may take the opportunity of obtaining relief at the same time.
In the meanwhile they are confined like birds in a cage, and some
º in after times will perhaps discover that Birdcage Walk was
so called from its affording a promenade to the muffins collected of
an evening to enjoy the vexation and annoyance of the unlucky persons
†. in the Park adjoining, and gesticulating and vociferating on the
other side of the railings, or making ludicrous efforts to clamber over
them amid the derision and execrations of the beholders.
MR. CAMPKIN, the Librarian to the Reform Club, who called attention
the other day to this waggery of the Woods and forests in the Times,
well remarks that “written notices, seven or eight feet high are not
very legible at dusk.” We may add, that if the notices *...;
hours of closing the Parks were ever so conspicuous, it is not everybody
that runs who could them in the present state of popular education.
The New Royal Game of Goose may be very droll; but surely the
Woods and Forests, and the Gatekeepers, and the Ranger, might
devise some practical joke more harmless than that of cooping people
up in the night air from 10 to 12, in this country of bronchitis and
consumption.

T H E PROSE R.
ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
WI.-ON AN AMERICAN TRAVELLER.
As you sit in the great drawing-room at the Megatherium or any
other club, Idare say you will remark that as each man passes the great
mirror in the middle room, be he ever so handsome or homely, so well
or ill-dressed, so hurried or busy, he nevertheless has time for a Fº
survey of himself in the glass, and a deliberate examination of his
clothes and person. He is anxious to know what the glass thinks of him.
We are anxious to know what all reflective persons think of us. Hence
our constant pleasure in reading books of travel by foreigners: by HAJJI
BABAs and Fº Princes; by LEDRU RolliNs or German phi-
losophers; by Americans who come to England; and the like. If the
i. gentleman in St. Paul’s Churchyard, who was called away from
his broom the other day, and lifted up into the Nepaulese General's
carriage in º of interpreter, writes his account of London life
its crossings sweepings, I have no doubt we shall all read it; and
as for the Americans, I think a smart publisher might bring over a
traveller from the States every season, at least, so constant is our
curiosity regarding ourselves, so pleased are we to hear ourselves spoken
of, of such an ing interest are We to Us.
Thus, after reading LEDRU Ro LIN's book the other day, and
the dismal yiew supplied of ourselves by that cracked
dingy old Estaminet looking-glass, I, for one, was glad to survey my
}. in such a bright and elegant New York mirror as that of MR.
2ARKER WILLIs; and seized º at a Railway Station, upon a new
volume by that gentleman, bearing the fascinating title of “People I have
Met.” PARKER WILLIs is no other than that famous and clever
N. P.WILLIs of former days, whose reminiscences have delighted so many
of us, and in whose company one is always sure to find amusement of some
sort or the other. Sometimes it is amusement at the writer's wit and
smartness, his brilliant descriptions, and wondrous flow and rattle of
spirits; sometimes it is wicked amusement, and, it must be confessed, at
WILLIs's own expense—amusement at the immensity of N. P.'s blunders,
amusement at the prodigiousness of his self-esteem; amusement always,
with him or at him; with or at WILLIs the poet, WILLIs the man, WILLIs
the dandy, WILLIs the lover-now the Broadway CRICHTON, once the
ruler of fashion, and heart-enslaver of Bond Street, and the Boulevard,
and the Corso, and the Chiaja, and the Constantinople Bazaar. It is
well for the general peace of families that the world does not produce
º such men; there would be no keeping our wives and daughters
in their senses were such fascinators to make frequent apparitions
amongst us; but it, is comfortable that there should have been a
WILLis; and (since the appearance of the Proser) a literary man myself,
and anxious for the honour of that profession, I am proud to think that
a man of our calling should have come, should have seen, should have
conquered, as WILLIs has done.
“There is more or less of truth,” he nobly says, “in every one of the
stories” which he narrates here in “People I have Met”—more or less, to
be sure there is—and it is on account of this more or less of truth, that
I for my part love and applaud this hero and poet so: and recommend
every man who reads Punch to lay out a shilling and read WILLIs... We
live in our country and don’t know it: WILLIs walks into it and
dominates it at once. To know a Duchess, for instance, is given to
very few of us. He sees things that are not given to us to see. We
see the Duchess pass by in her carriage, and gaze with much reverence
on the strawberry leaves on the panels and her Grace within: whereas
the odds are that that º: has had at one time or the other
a desperate flirtation with WILLIs the Conqueror; perhaps she is think:
ing of him at this very minute as her jewelled hand presses her perfumed
cambric handkerchief to her fair and coronetted brow, and she languidly
...}} to purchase aruby bracelet at GUNTER’s, or to sip an ice at Howell
and JAMEs's. He must have whole mattresses stuffed with the blonde,
or raven, or auburn memories of England's fairest daughters. When
the female English aristo this title of “People I have Met,”
I can fancy, the whole female peerage of WILLIS's time in a shudder:
and the melancholy Marchioness, and the abandoned Countess, and the
heart-stricken Baroness, trembling as each gets the volume, and asking
of her guilty conscience, “Gracious goodness, is the monster going to
show up me * .
“The greater number of his stories,” WILLIs says, “embody such
assages in the personal history of the eminent men and women of
Šurope as the author came to the knowledge of, by conversance with
the circles in which they moved”—and this is the point, rather than
their own liveliness, elegance of style, and intrinsic merit, which
makes them so, valuable to English ers. We can’t hope for the
facilities accorded to him. As at Paris, by merely exhibiting his pass-
port, a foreigner will walk straight into an exhibition, which is onl
visible to a native on certain days in the year; so with £º
aristocratic society, to be admitted into that Elºi, you had best be
a stranger indeed, how should it be otherwise? A lady of fashion,
however benevolently disposed, can’t ask every body to her house in
warped, an
Grosvenor Square or Carlton Gardens. Say there are five hundred
thousandFº in London (a moderate calculation) who have heard
of LADY P.’s Saturday evening parties and would like to attend them:
where could her Ladyship put the thousandth
the outside must be content to hear at secon
which the initiated enjoy.
With strangers it is different, and they claim and get admittance as
strangers. ere, for instance, is an account of one BRowN, an
American, (though, under that modest mask of BROWN, I can't help
fancying that I see the features of an N. P. W. himself): BRows
arrived in London with a budget of introductions like the postman's
bag on Valentine's Day; he “began with a most noble Duke” (the
sly rogue), and, of course, was quickly “on the dinner-list of most of
the patricians of May Fair.”
F. of them 2 We on

“As I was calling myself to account, the other day, over my breakfast,' said Brown,
filling his glass, and pushing the bottle, “it occurred to me that my round of engage-
ments required some little variation. There’s a “toujours perdriz,” even among lords
and ladies, particularly when you belong as much to their sphere, and are as likely to
become a part of it, as the fly revolving in aristocratic dust on the wheel of my lord's
carriage. I thought, perhaps, I had better see some other sort of people.
“I had, under a presse-papier on the table, about a hundred letters of introduction—
the condemned remainder, after the selection, by advice, of four or five only. I deter-
Inined to cut this heap like a pack of cards, and follow up the trump.
“‘John MIMPson, Esq., House of MIMPson and Phipps, Mark Lane, London.'
w The gºds had devoted me to the acquaintance of MR. (and probably MRs.) John
IMPson.”
After a “dialogue of accost,” BRowN produced his introductory
letter to MIMPson, whom he finely describes as having “that highly-
washed look peculiar to London city men; ” and MIMPSON asked
BRowN to lunch and sleep at his villa at Hampstead the next day,
whither the American accordingly went in a “poshay’ with “a pair
of NEwMAN's posters.” BRow N might, as he owns, have performed
this i. in an omnibus for sixpence, whereas the chaise would
cost four dollars at least, but the stranger preferred the more costly
and obsolete contrivance.
“MBs. MIMPson was in the garden. The dashing footman who gave me the informat
tion led me through a superb drawing-room, and out at a glass door upon the lawn, and
left me to make my own way to the lady's presence.
“It was a delicious spot, and I should have been very glad to ramble about by myself
till dinner; but, at a turn in the grand walk, I came suddenly upon two ladies.
“I made my bow, and begged leave to introduce myself as ‘MR. Bhown.'
“With a very slight inclination of the head, and no smile whatever, one of the ladies
asked me if I had walked from town, and begged her companion (without introducin
me to her) to show me in to lunch. The spokester was a stout and tall woman, who h
rather an aristocratic nose, and was not handsome; but, to give her her due, she had made
a narrow escape of it. She was dressed very showily, and evidently find great preten-
sions; but, that she was not at all glad to see MR. BrowN, was as apparent as was at
all necessary. As the other and younger lady who was to accompany me, however, was
very pretty, though dressed very plainly, and had, withal, a look in her eye which
assured me she was amused with my unwelcome apparition, I determined, as I should
not otherwise have done, to stay it out, and accepted her convoy with submissive civility
—very much inclined, however, to be impudent to somebody, somehow.
“The lunch was on a tray in a side room, and I rang the bell and ordered a bottle of
champagne. The servant looked surprised, but brought it, and meantime I was getting
through the weather, and the other common-places, and the lady, saying little, was
watching me very calmly. I liked her looks, however, and was sure she was not a
MIMPson.
“‘Hand this to Miss ARMSTRoNg,' said I to the footman, pouring out a glass of
champagne.
“Miss BELLAMy, you mean, Sir.’
“I rose and bowed, and, with as grave a courtesy as I could command, expressed my
pleasure at my first introduction to Miss BELLAMY—through THOMAs, the footman!
Miss BELLAMY burst into a laugh, and was pleased to compliment my American
manners, and in ten minutes we were a very merry pair of friends, and she accepted my
arm for a stroll through the grounds, carefully avoiding the frigid neighbourhood of
MBs. MIMP8oN.”
There’s a rascal for you! ... He enters a house, is received coolly by
the mistress (and if MRs. MIMPSON, had to receive every BROWN in
London—ye Gods ! what was she to do?) walks into chicken fixings in
a side room, and, not content with MIMPSON's sherry, calls for a bottle
of champagne—not for a glass of champagne, but for a bottle; he
catches hold of it and pours out for himself, he rogue, and for Miss
BELLAMY, to whom THOMAs introduces him. And this upon an in-
troduction of five years’ date, from one mercantile man to another;
upon an introduction, one of a thousand which lucky BROWN possesses,
and on the strength of which BRowN sneers at MIMPson, sneers at
MRs. M., sneers at M.'s sherry, makes a footman introduce him to a lady,
and assumes a bottle of champagne | Come, BRowN!..you are a stranger,
and on the dinner-list of most of the patricians of May Fair; but isn't
this un peu fort, my boy? If MRs. MIMPsqN, who is described as a
haughty lady, fourth cousin of a Scotch Earl, and marrying M. for his
money merely, had suspicions regarding the conduct of her husband's
friends, don't you see that this sort of behaviour on your part, my dear
BRow N, was not likely to do away with MRs. M.'s little prejudices?
fshould not like a stranger to enter my house, pooh-pooh my Marsala,
order servant about, desire an introduction to my daughter
through him; and deferentially think, BROWN, that you had no right to
be impudent somehow to somebody, as in this instance you certainly
Were.
The upshot of the story is, that MRs. M. was dying to take her
daughter to ack's, for which place of entertainment BRow N, t
one of the patronesses, LADY X., “the best friend he has,” could get as

many tickets as he wished; and that, to punish MRs. MIMPson for her rudeness,
and reward Miss BELLAMY for her kindness, BRown got tickets for Miss
BELLAMY and her Mamma, but would get never a ticket for Miss MIMEsox and
hers—a wonderful story, truly, and with a wonderful moral.
THE HOUSE OF LORDS ORDERLY.
It has long been known that a
certain noble and learned
lord is able to turn his
hand to any thing; but
few, perhaps, were aware
that the grasp of that
marvellous organ is so
comprehensive as to in-
clude the truncheon of

the noble and ed

proved himself the javelin-man of the Supreme Court of Justice. All e
that he has signalised himself in such, a way as to deserve promotion for it; but
opinions differ as to whether he should be created LoRD HIGH Constable, or
elevated to an Earldom under the title of Bum BLE and WAux.
º
A NATIONAL RELLEF.
It seems very probable that England will be effectually relieved in a short time
from the heavy burden she has been labouring under for some years, of readi
the Parliamentary debates. The House of Lords is reduced to such a state º
deafness, that it is quite impossible to hear, a single word, and the new House of
Commons is, it seems, equally hard of hearing. Under these happy circumstances
—as the complaints, instead of improving, only grow worse—we may hope to see
the joyful day when there will be no more Debates in the land, from the simple fact
of its being no longer possible to report them. But in our joyfulness we should
not forget the claims of a very intelligent class of the community, who will be
suddenly thrown out of employment by this improved prospect, of things. Their
trials have been as severe as their patience in enduring them has been sublime.
We know of nobody of men who, in their painful course of business, suffer more
and complain less. We allude to the reporters, the laborious. gentlemen whose
hard vocation it is to weave into long ropes of sentences the flimsy yarns which
Honourable Lords, and Members spin, every might. But if those gentlemen
cannot hear a word of these interminable yarns, it is very clear that there must
rapidly be an end to their weaving; for º: proprietors, with all their
libe §: will soon tire of paying a la corps of contributors in proportion to
º ents, when those talents are only exercised in the difficult art of doing
nothing.
They might as well be sent to report a Quakers’ meeting as sit for hours in
the º: of either House, in the º of hearing a word of the causes that are
facetiously “set down for hearing.” In the joyfulness of our own escape we must
not forget the price which others will have to pay for it, and we only trust that,
in the event of the Debates being shortly occupied, according to our best
hopes by a congenial blank, every reporter will receive such compensation from
Government, as will not only make his old age comfortable, but allow him to look
back with some degree of º upon the sufferings of his º: youth. If a
mere solicitor of the lately-deceased Palace Court receives £2000 for the loss of his
situation, we think a reporter will not be over-paid upon being presented with five
times that amount. Martyrs must be paid for, and we do not consider £10,000 by
any means too much for a person who has been condemned for years to listen to
the speechesofParliament every night during the lingering session. We are sure the
country will not object to pay this sum, if it is only relieved from the Debates.

CONVERSATIONS OF THE SUNDAY-BOUND
LETTERS.
We have received a communication, signed St. MARTIN-
IE-GRAND, of so wonderful a nature that, if it had come
from anybody but a saint, and from any saint but St.
MARAIN-LE-GRAND, we should never have believed it. St.
MARTIN avers that the letters detained in a provincial
Letter Box, have been, in the interval between Saturday
and Monday, owing to the stoppage of postal communica-
tion in the meanwhile through puritanical legislation, so
impatient of the delay, that they could not contain them-
selves, and have been actually heard to compare notes. He
gives the following as a few out of many of their con-
versations:- - - -
To letter A–which excites attention by heaving a dee
sigh, as if from the heart of the writer—says letter
“What are you about? You seem very sentimental; and
you are sealed with a heartskewercion narrow.” Ahſ.”
replies A, “I am addressed by a poor mad young fellow,
head-over-ears in love, to the object of his affections, who
as unaccountably neglected to answer his last six billets.
He writes to say that he will destroy himself unless he
hears from her by return of Post. What is your news?”
“Mine?” answers B, “why, rather urgent, I should say;
briefly this:– Your father has had a fresh attack-pu
yourself into a postchaise and come up instantly, if yºu
want to see him alive.’” “ *...", particular?” asks
letter C of letter D. “No,” answers D. “I’m only from
a wife who writes to tell her husband that an executiºn
has been put into their house in his absence, and that, he
must return home directly, and not wait till the next day,
or their goods will be all sold off at a loss, and she and her
children turned into the street.” “My tidings,” remarks
C, “are of some little importance.”. “So I should judge.”
observes E, “from your black seal.”, “They are these,”
says Cº-Dear Tom. Your poor uncle has died sudden 'i
He named you as his heir. me up instantly, or that old
woman will make away with everything in the house.”
“And I,” says E, “am to a surgeon of Bartholomew's, nºw
in the country, begging him to come up instantly, as the
danger is imminent, and a patient's only chance is an
operation.”
Saint MARTIN-LE-GRAND says, that such news as that
above instanced won't keep, and ought not to be *g:
even on Sunday; and we would take the word of St.
MARTIN against that of St. Ashley, or St. PLUMPTRE.

You have lately done a very handsome

FROM AN OLD FRIEND IN A NEW PLACE.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“As the Echo of the House of Commons, I don’t know to
whom I can better address myself than to you, who are the Echo of
Public Opinion.
“I have been shamefully abused of late. I am accused of not doing
my duty of fetching and carrying the utterances of the collective
wisdom of the country. I am charged with dropping all manner of
words in their passage from ‘the floor” to ‘the gallery, with making the
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER commit fearful blunders in arithmetic,
with, losing the points of Colon EL SIBTHORP's jokes, and shamefully
mutilating MR. HUME's grammar.
“Sir, it is sometimes very lucky to have an Echo to fall back upon,
But I appeal to the past. "Do I deserve this? I, the old and tried
servant of Commons, who, have had the honour of acting as
repétiteur for every House since the time of SIMON DE MonTEORT; who
saw through all the hard work of the Long Parliament; who assisted at
the last dying speech of the Rump, and carried CROMwFLL's *i.
‘Take away that bauble!” to the scared ears of MR. SPEAKER; who
saw JAMES out and WILLIAM in;, who reported the Debates all
through the reign of GEORGE THE THIRD; and have had the honour
of being word-bearer to a SELDEN, a MARVELL, a PITT, a Fox, a
BURKE, and a GRATTAN–I to be accused, in my old age, of faili
to do my duty; of allowing Honourable Gentlemen to be “inaudible in
the gallery'." -
“No, Sir—I throw back the accusation with scorn. I am as service-
able, and hard-working, and able-bodied an Echo as ever I was. I have
not lost that power of discrimination which I have acquired through
nearly ſfive centuries of wearisome experience. I still know nonsense
when I hear it. I have heard enough, and not now, any more than ever,
do I º more than is absolutely necessary. If the country only
knew what I do not carry, they would feel proper gratitude towards a
public servant who has saved them from more, false grammar, bad
jokes, verbiage, rhodomontade, and Billingsgate, than any gentleman of
the press who ever ‘took a turn” in the gallery.
“I repeat it, Sir; the fault is not with me. In the Painted Chamber
at Westminster I did my duty in the days of the Plantagenets. In St.
Stephen's, Chapel, I was generally acknowledged to be irreproachable,
down to the recent calamitous fire that burned out meand my employers.
In the late º House I made myself at home, and satisfied
Honourable Members; but I confess that MR. BARRY has been too much
for me. In one word, Sir, it is all that new House! What with
panelling, and ††† and finnikin, and finial, and arched recesses,
and tragery, and slish and slash, and snip and snap, and filagree-work
of all kinds, I cannot keep my sounds in decent order. I defy any
Echo going to carry a message safely from any part of that room to
any other. They will be off, playing hide-and-seek among the fret-work
and frippery, lurking in the darkness of the strangers' gallery, bolting,
on the sly, in among the ladies who sit behind the bars up there, like so
many doves in a cage. It was only the other day I found the darlings
all in a titter at a bon-mot of Mr. STAFFORD’s which had got up there,
the sly thing, undetected by me or the House, and was having it all its
own way among the ladies.
“I don’t know how many withering sarcasms of MR. RoEBUCK may
be at this moment taking it out in the sunk panels of the ceiling, or
how many of SIR CHARLEs, Wood's Stamp Bill calculations may be
§3. ugh the dark in the unexplored recesses behind the Speaker's
alr.
“In short, Sir, I will not be answerable for any message that may be
entrusted to me in the new House. If any other Echo can be found
to do the business, let them engage that Echo. . There is one at Exeter
Hall, who has had a good deal of experience in the Evangelical and
BoANERGEs line of business; and perhaps now that, LORD ASHLEY’s
Resolution is carried, he may have no conscientious objections to work
for the House of Commons. They talk about the Echos employed at
the theatres. I should like to see the Covent Garden Echo in our new
House. You might just as well set MARIo in SIR GEORGE GREY’s
place, and tell him to make a speech on the Interment Bill. -
“No, Sir; depend on it; I am all right enough, if MR. BARRY will
only give me fair play. -
“I don't know whether that gentleman is a friend of MR. THOMAS
CARLYLE's. But if the architect had considered how he might best
bring about the consummation so much desired by the ingenious author
of the Latter-Day Pamphlets, of reducing Parliament from a speakin
to a silent body, he . have hit upon a cleverer or more effec
way of doing it than by building such a House of Commons. They
don’t hold their tongues in it, it is true. But what they say can't be
heard, which comes practically to much the same thing, Trusting that
this will meet the ear of the Public,

A BIT OF MY MI N D.
BIT THE TENTH.
MRS. MOUSER PROPOSES AN EXHIBITION OF LORD ASHLEY’s
MODEL SUNDAY.
THE finger of fortune is in it, Mr. Punch, and ſº out Smithfield
as the very place for the model AsHLEYQPOLIs. I’d hardly put my last
“BIT’’ in the post when I saw the Parliament Report that recommends
the repeal of Smithfield as a market-place for cattle; which leaves it
beautifully open for our moral experiment on a grand scale; for the
large and wholesome exhibition of Sunday, according to LoRD AshLEY:
which brings me to a notion that, at once, as with a pair of tweezers, f
feel it my duty to nip in the bud. Which is this, -
There’s that MRs. HoRNBLow ER—if she could only hear what people
said of her, I think she'd look a little, more after her family concerns:
mending public morals is very well, when there isn't a single hole in a
stocking at home—well, there's that MRs. H., I hear, has writ a letter
—and like her impudence!—to PRINCE ALBERT, to ask for a few acres
in the new Exhibition, which they’re weeding Hyde Park for at this
minute of all the British oaks—to show a Model British Sunday, as a
specimen of Parliament Manufacture, for the improvement and con-
version of all the foreigners that's coming. A Model Sunday, as she
says, that will put all, Paris to the blush, and not leave Brussels or
Vienna,a single leg to dance upon Now, Mr. Punch, if this was granted
—not that it will be, the dear Prince has too much sense for that a
grand idea would be cut up into a little kickshaw—just as though a mag-
nificent venison pasty for Guildhall should be frittered away into nothing
better than ...} pies. - -
No, Mr. Punch; Smithfield is to be hired, and it will be a beautiful
satisfaction to the calves and sheep that have suffered there, to have
their market turned into a place, where the wickedness of human
nature may be rebuked—as the Beadle of the Hall says—by the hockey-
stick of MR. STUMPTREE. It will be sweet and ºrji. where
bullocks have been baited, to put an iron-ring in the noses of worldly
pride; charming, where little lambs have bleated for the water-brooks
and didn't find 'em, to mortify the flesh of Sunday sinners, thirsting for
country air, and—it may be—a steam-boat on the Thames.
ishould be ashamed of §º if I could doubt that the
money taken at the comi kcloth Sabbath Fair would not be enough,
and more, to hire Smithfield for once a week—for the Exhibition of the
Model Sunday would, of course, only be wanted every seventh day while
the Park Show lasts—and then as for the building, all we want would
be a monster tent, painted black with a sort of doom—an allegory the
Beadle says it º be—fire red, to hover above the top of it.
Why, Iquite burn and glow with the thought. As the Beadle says, my
spirit’s like an axle tree–(not that I know where the tree grows)—that
kindles as it turns, with the idea! Again, as money—say twopence, for
it wouldn’t be right to i. higher than, St. Paul's—as money woul
º at the doors of the Tent, the Exhibition would more than pay
itself.
There’s no doubt of it, that five hundred families—running, we’ll say,
five apiece—could be accommodated under the Tent, to carry out
Sunday in a way that should preach, as the Beadle says, thunderbolts,
In order that the whole day might begº; done, the families should
meet, not later than daylight, on the Sunday morning, to begin with the
beginning, and not leave before twelve at night, to go through the
model day. And first for the people showing themselves.
LoRD AshLEy—as they say in the º expected to preside on
the occasion. With him there will be more than a sprinkling of the
heads of the Church; with MR. STUMPTREE, MR. DE NEwgATE, and
all the majority that sealed up the Sunday post. Everybody is to show
a pattern of º helping himself on the Model Day; so that the
ºul be own footman, and the mistress her own maid-of-
-Work.
As for the time between the hours of devotion—which, of course, is
to be according to everybody's conscience—that is to be passed in a
way that will strike home to the hearts and hearth-stones of the
thoughtless wicked, for whose good the exhibition is intended. It
isn't for me to give rules outright; I can only embolden myself so far,
as to drop here and there a hint.
I am aware that I º a delicate subject—shaving. Neverthe-
less, in these times, people are to speak out. I think all shaving, and
so i have told MouseR, should take Fº on the Saturday night.
Neither do I think that water ought to be set to boil on Sundays; int
that people, with a proper interest in their own welfare, will only do
what is right to take a serious breakfast of cold tea.
| A hot dinner is, of course, an abomination—the oven being by no
means second to a fiery furnace. If people would only think of things
in their proper light, wouldn’t they–says the Beadle of the Hall–
wouldn't they shudder, at the very notion of a shoulder-of-mutton
baked; with the ſº hissing among the potatoes beneath P , They’d
see in that scorched shoulder, and hear in that bubbling and hissing
gravy, a warning and a sermon that is too dreadful to think upon.
As for Sunday clothes, nobody under the Tent will presume to wear
anything but the deepest black; silver grey, perhaps, being allowed for
infants and the younger branches. As for ribbons, they must be looked
upon as carmal ties; and so much as a single flower in a bonnet, little
better than flower of brimstone. - - - - - |
The time under the Tent not spent in service is to be enjºyed in per-
fect silence; everybody sitting and wondering at and applau his
own goodness—and, as the Beadle says, patting his own spiritual head,
and thinking how, in that sweet, sad-coloured tent, he is so much better
than the flaunting, forlorn people, who—having been to church-go into
the fields; and letting their º like butterflies, rove from tree to
tree, and flower to flower, have in 'em no more religion than the larks
above their heads, that are singing they don't know why, and are happy
in their ignorance because they can't help it. -
The Beadle of the Hall tells me—and he had it from the black man
with the broom that is now the esquire to the Nepaulese Ambassadors
—that there’s an Indian God that does nothing but sit cross-legged,
thinking of nothing soever but his own sweetness and goodness—his
own elevation above all other creatures. Now, that’s the state I wish
to get into: that’s the state that everybody who—with proper earnest-
ness—makes one, for LoRD AshLEy's Model Sunday, must, hope to
arrive at. For why does his Lordship, MR. STUMPTREE, MR. DE
GATE, and so forth, take the Sunday Post out of the hands of the
wicked: Why, for this humble reason; they know best what is right,
and therefore—with a beautiful boldness that comes of true piety, says
the Beadle—will make the Seventh Day for other people. . -
I hope, however, that when his Lor §§ is place in the Smith-
field Tent, he will “improve” upon the Sunday, to the profit of this
wicked land, and to the further delight in particular, of his
Lordship's faithful servant,
The Honeysuckles. AMELIA MoUSER.
NOT TO BE DELIVERED UNTIL MONDAY.
NEW DALLY SUMMARY OF THE DEBATES.
When both Houses of Parliament will be finished.
THE House of Lords met yesterday at a quarter-past four, and sat
for six hours. As not a word of the Debates was audible, we are saved
the trouble of reporting them. - -
The House of Commons assembled early in the afternoon, and did not
adjourn till long past midnight. We are sorry we are not in a position
to say what the Debate was upon, for though we were in the gallery all
the time, we did not hear a single syllable.
Editor's Remarks on the abore Summary.
We are spared the necessity of offering any comments upon the sub-
ject of the Debates that occupied the attention of our two Houses of
£iº for so many hours last night, from the simple fact that we
are perfectly at a loss to conjecture what the subject of those Debates
was. We could not ascertain, nor could any one inform us. Under
these circumstances our task is very slight, for we have only to act upon
the old rule which enjoins every rational creature never to talk unless
he has something to talk upon. As we have absolutely nothing to say,
we congratulate ourselves upon the great prudence we display in holding
our tongues.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UR daily experience teaches us
that, Nemoomnibushorissapit,
and it is equally a fact that
everybody is playing the fool
at all hours. The present
practice of what is called the
fashionable world is to kill
time, not merely in the old
established modes, but to
shuffle the hours together in
such an extraordinary way,
that it is quite impossible to
form any notion of time's
º existence what-
ever. We find the beaumonde
dining when it ought to go
to bed, dancing when it ought
to be taking its luncheon,
going to bed when it ought
to be getting up, and having
its breakfast when it ought
to be taking its dinner.
There is such an inde-
scribable confusion of hours,
as to remind us of the
worst days of St. Clement's Clock, or that disgraceful, series, of
escapades in which the timepiece of the Horse Guards indulged when
it used to resort to the figure of “hands across, and back again,” or
indulge in a “grand round” of all the hours at once in the course of
twenty minutes. We are in !". that the reductio ad absurdum that
has been effected in the hours kept by the world of fashion will soon
work a cure, or lead to an essential improvement, inasmuch as it is quite
impossible that the present #. of dining between 9 and 10 P.M.,
dancing at noon, and breakfasting in the evening, can be persisted in
much longer, if the beau monde is to claim credit for sense of the very
commonest character. -
We confess ourselves also thoroughly nauseated by the names given
in the fashionable papers to the entertainments of what are called the
higher classes, who have introduced what they term thes dansantes, or
dancing teas, and other similar absurdities. we are to have a series
of dancing teas, why not a course of musical dinners, lyric luncheons,
scientific milk-and-waters, literary bread-and-cheeses, or any other
ridiculous combination of what the vulgarians would call “grub” and
iety? We shall be hearing * that the WiscountEss WHIRLIGIG
has given an eau de vie dansante, and, as CAPTAIN Johnson would have
said, “Why not?” for it would be quite as rational as a dancing tea,
and far more spirited. We have never yet been to a dancing tea, but
the subject always brings to our mind the magnificent tableau of BARON
NATHAN and his popular fandango among the eggs and breakfast-cups.
THE FOOLERY OF FASHION.
THE PENNY-POST-CARRIER PIGEON-SUNDAY-SOCIETY.
A NEw society is about to be organised with the above title. Its
object is to deliver parcels on a Sunday between neighbouring towns.
At a distance of every thirty miles there will be a fresh relay of pigeons.
By this means a letter—we mean a {º} be conveyed from Lon-
don to Manchester very much quicker than if it had been sent through
the post. A pigeon will start every two hours, thus enabling a person
to send a letter and receive an answer on the same day. It is calculated
that each F. can with the greatest safety carry twenty-four letters,
the size of which will be limited by a scale; and as some hundreds of
pigeons would fly off at once, it is º calc how enormous the
returns will be in the course of a day, for the number of pigeons would
only be restricted by the number of letters. Pigeon-holes would be
established at different parts of the metropolis for the reception of
letters, only when we say letters, of course it is understood we mean
- cels. The only difference would be that the letters would have to
be strung round with coloured thread, for fear the Post office might cry
out against an interference with its monopoly, and prosecute private
individuals for deriving any emolument from the execution of a duty
which it refuses to carry out itself. We wish this new Carrier-Pigeon-
Sunday-Society every success.
| -----
A Nice Little Wolume.
| AMong new works lately advertised, we find—
“The Great Gorham Case: a History, in five books. In one vol. 3s.6d...cloth."

We can confidently recommend the perusal of this book—by way of
penance for heresy on the subject it relates to, provided the Court, of
Alºnd the Privy Council, between them, can agree as to what
leresy is.
HYDE PARK IN JEOPARDY.
WE live in an age of mutation,
And a warehouse as big as an Ark,
To exhibit the goods of each nation,
Will illustrate that truthful remark,
By the pleasant and nice alteration
Its erection will make in Hyde Park.
No more the º classes
Will parade their vain elegance there;
But your blithe lads and frolicsome lasses
Give the place quite a different air:
*Twill be crowded, in fact, by the masses,
And by Greenwich instead of May Fair.
No longer fine ladies shall amble,
With their delicate airs, in the Ride;
The soft Guardsman no longer will gambol
At the frivolous horsewoman's ..
But the holiday-mob push and scramble,
Scorning all ostentation and pride.
With tobacco the gale shall be loaded
ow so fragrant with bouquets and scents,
And the Waterloo cracker exploded,
Mid much noise like the tearing of rents;
Whilst we're rather—not much-incommoded
By our backs being rasped by the gents.
The i. and mild conversation,
Softened down by Society's law,
Will give place to the rough exclamation,
To the lively and boisterous jaw,
To the loud, jolly, bold imprecation,
And the roaring and hearty guffaw.
The flowers will no longer their sweetness
In the Gardens of Kensington waste;
They’ll be plucked with surprising completeness,
And the grounds will be ...i. defaced.
Never care for their order and neatness—
After all, that’s a matter of taste.
The great human tide will ebb nightly,
And its scum in the Park leave behind,
There to harbour-nice characters, slightly,
It may be, unto pillage inclined;
If Belgravia and Pimlico lightly
Weigh this danger—why then, never mind.
THE DEEP AND ARTFUL IN FOREIGN POLICY.
PUNCH hereby gives notice of a motion to have the following passage
from MR. Roebuck's red in defence of LORD PALMERSTON's policy
printed in letters of gold:–
“Now, Sir, I at once acknowledge that I wish the people of England would entirely
withdraw from these miserable consultations and diplomatic relations with all nations.
(Hear, hear.) I feel degraded when I see the name of England prostituted in such dis-
cussions. (Hear, hear.) I want no representative in the shape of an ambassador to any
Foreign Court, to protect our rights—let it be the great name of England—and let it be
on the Mediterranean our ships and nothing more.”
That 's the plan for BRITANNIA in dealing with forei
ers, to abandon
the artful dodge, and conduct her manoeuvres only on
e deep.
Shakspeare a la Française.
To some tastes SHAKSPEARE, like railway accounts, must be cooked
in order to be made pleasant. Qn the occasion of some recent festivities,
M. SoYER, as we learn from the Morning Post, uced an invention
in gastronomy. Our contemporary informs us that “the new culinary
innovation ” (a rather peculiar kind of innovation that must be), “was
named Croustade Shakspearienne à la Halévy Scribe.”
Croustade, friend SoYER. Qughtn't it to have been salmi & Surely
if you meant to concoct a Shakspearian dish in the style of SCRIBE an
HALÉvy, you should have made a hash of it.
A JOKE FROM MR. SPEAKER.
As the tellers on the Vote of Confidence division advanced to declare
the numbers, the Speaker—with doubtless, a prophetic sense of the
majority of 46—said, with a benignant, smile at isters—“Gentle-
men will be pleased to keep their i.

MR. SEESAW'S CONDUCT IN PARLIAMENT
DURING THE LATE DEBATES.
THE conduct of MR. SEESAw in the circumstances which have been
of late engaging the attention of the country, and calling forth the
eloquence of both Houses of Parliament, has been exceedingly puzzling
to M.R. SEESAw himself, and such as all his friends expected of him,
Unbiassed by party, his motto, “measures not men,” his firmly expressed
determination being to “rally round the British Oak,’ the independent
electors of Noodleborough, of which town the distinguished gentleman is
a native, chose him lately as their representative, in place of the veteran
DADDLEs, who thought that, because he had represented the borough
since the Reform Bill, he might dispense with treating and the usual
ceremonies which he had performed at the previous elections. Having
º his intentions to this effect, MR, Pou Nce, Solicitor, and Mayor
of the Town of Noodleborough, discovered with regret that MR. DADDLES
was no longer a fit person to be returned to Parliament by such a con:
stituency as that of Noodleborough, and proposed the accomplished and
wealthy MR. SEESAw in opposition to the former member., M.R.
DADDLes was vanquished in the contest, and MR. SEESAw has been in
Parliament for the last three years. - - - - -
Five or six courses were open to MR. S. on his commencing his parlia-
mentary career: to join the ministerial party, or that of the opposition,
or that of SIR Robert PEEL, or that of the advanced liberals, or to be
himself a party open to all and fettered by none. This latter line
MR, SEESAw chose, and sometimes, voted one way, and sometimes
another, with a praiseworthy impartiality which had its merits and
vantages. -
A man who has his vote in his pocket is always an interesting
character. When you see MR. WIGSBY º; down to the House, or
SIR John HAwBuck, nobody cares to know how they will vote. Their
opinions are the opinions of their party, and DoN PACIFICO is either an
injured individual who merits redress, or an old rogue who deserves to
i. his house turned out of windows, according to the opinion of their
eaſters.
Now SEESAw is not a thick, and thin Protectionist like HAwBUCK,
or a mere ministerial minion like Wigsby. He has lodgings in Saint
James's Street, half-way between BRooks's and the Conservative; and
when he first entered Parliament, he declared that one club, the Oxford
and Cambridge, was quite sufficient for him, and that he must wait for
a year or two, and economise after his electioneering expenses, before
he could afford to pay the entrance-money to any other club.
He always said, he was free to avow, that he thought the Govern-
ment of the country should be sº cautiously, though
emergetically, progressive. The Corn-Laws being repealed, it was his
firm opinion that the Free Trade system should have a fair trial: at the
same time, if it was found that our agricultural interests (and our
manufactures through them) suffered so much that some protection was
absolutely necessary to maintain them; he, for one, reluctantly but
firmly, would consent to a modification of the present system.
An enemy to religious cant, and a friend to tolerance and freedom,
MR. SEESAw could not but see, was proud to see, that ours was emi-
nently a religious country; and admiring as he did the honesty and
hilanthropy of LoRD AshLEY, and the great and good whom
e represented (with some of whose extreme views he could not how-
ever take upon himself to concur), and subscribing from the depths of
his heart to the doctrine that the Government officials—and by conse-
quence those in the Post-Office—should have every possible labour
spared to them on the Sunday; MR. SEESAw, though he would not
vote with the noble lord, yet certainly on that subject would not vote
against him—and warmly complimented LoRD JoHN upon his resolution
not to interfere—a compliment which must have surprised and delighted
his lordship, and given him a high opinion of MR. SEESAw's consci-
entious patriotism.
From the day of his entrance into the House of Commons, MR.
SEESAw made a point of cultivating the acquaintance of gentlemen of
all parties, and being an agreeable person of much anecdote, and
leasing humour, had soon a pretty large acquaintance.
eavens ! what a brilliant wit, what a tearing invective, what a
consummate rhetoric, MR. DISRAELI possesses! he would say, when
the Honourable Member for Buckinghamshire spoke, whom MR.
SEESAw invaribly cheered with frantic enthusiasm. What a spirit H
there is about Lokº JoHN,-the same panegyrist would remark—what a
high-minded English statesman, what a plucky man he is! which
remark he made with special enthusiasm with regard to his Lordship's
contest on the Sunday Bill. He cheered the chivalry of Colon EL
SIBThoRP: he would go a hundred miles to hear CoBDEN, and MR. Fox
was as great an orator as his illustrious namesake. He admired honest
men of all opinions, MR. SEESAw generously said, but SIR RoBERT and
SIR. JAMEs he did not like so well, because their opinions were not
decided, and he did not like vacillating men. -
. As MR. SEESAw had always a case of the yery best cigars in the
º in his pocket, and offered them liberally to the young fellows
of all parties in the House, he became speedily acquainted with many,
cementing the acquaintance º handsome dinners at Greenwich,
whither he invited the young Whig and Tory gentlemen; and, after a
brief space, he became on terms of friendship with some of the young
men's families, and his name might be seen as among the company at
some of the most fashionable lº in London.
It is impossible to say how keen was MR. SEESAw's anguish when he
heard that LoRD STANLEY (a man whose honesty and admirable powers
as an orator he thought could not be too highly praised.) was determined
to push his motion against LoRD PALMERSTON in the Lords. His own
opinions on the case had always been delivered in a perfectly straight-
forward manner. No man could doubt the integrity of LoRD PALMER-
ston ; that our fellow subjects had been insulted, robbed, imprisoned
and denied redress in Greece; and that because a state was mean and
despicable, that was no reason why it should bully and robus. But
then what a rogue this old PACIFICQ was Qught we to send fifteen
sail of the line to get £150 for his bedstead? Might not conciliation
have been used? and were the good offices of the French (though he
must own they were making a nefarious government job of the quarrel)
to be rejected ? It was altogether a lamentable affair, and the right
thing, the patriotic thing, as he thought would have been—to hush it
ſ: Nevertheless, that we had been insulted, and grossly insulted,
there could be no question.
On the night of LoRD STANLEY’s speech in the Lords, MR. SEESAw
ot a place, and after bursting with laughter at the little incident of
oRD BRQUGHAM turning out, CHEVALIER BUNSEN, and rushing out
and heartily condoling with his Excellency, he listened with rapt
admiration to LoRD STANLEY’s wonderful oration. LoRD CANNING's
was a masterly oration; LORD ABERDEEN’s, he thought, was needlessly
bitter; and how galiantly LORD EDDISBURY went in and tackled to him
The vote of the Lords, he said, was a º matter, most pregnant
with grave ..". and one which must make every man in
England think, and think deeply.
MR. SEESAw would gladly have subscribed to any worthy picture of
LoRD PALMERSTON, to be presented to her ladyship; but his opinions
about high art were known; no man was fit to paint a great picture of
so great a statesman, but, MR. SoANDso, or MR. WHATDYoucALLEM,
It was to the painter he objected, and unless they would have a Royal
Academician, he thought they were paying but a poor compliment to
the wife of a Minister of the Crown.
I)uring the debate in the House of Commons, SEESAw of course was
in his place... No man cheered more loudly, when loRD PALMERSTON
made his noble speech; no man was more delighted when SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM said we have had enough of nisi prius. He thought SIR
WILLIAM MoLEsworth’s excellent speech was unanswerable; and no
one was more astonished and pleased at MR. CockBURN's fierce assault
upon SIR JAMEs and magnificent defence of the Government. SIR
RoBERT PEEL's speech, so calm, so statesmanlike, so masterly, so
melancholy, filled SEESAw with a sad admiration; and, at four o'clock
in the morning, when he was going to say a few words himself and give
his own views on the question, and just as he had returned from looking
over his notes, whilst MR. DiskAELI was speaking, in the cool dawn
before St. Margaret's church, what was SEESAw’s astonishment to find
that the House had divided, and that Government had a majority of 46.
He rushed up to LoRD PALMERSTON. “Heaven bless you, Sir,” he
said. “This is a great day for England indeed!”
Building Glass Castles in the Air.
A HUGE dome, 200 feet in diameter—which, in point of size, is to
make the domes of St. Paul's and St. Peter's and the Pantheon, look
like º small dish covers—is run up, or rather, is intended to be run
up, as the great feature of the proposed Building for the Industrial
Exhibition. It is a question, however, whether this monster dome can
be erected in the short space of time allowed for the construction of the
whole building. For ourselves, we have no hesitation in asserting, that
if the opening is made dependent on the completion of this great
DANIEL LAMBERT of a Dome, the Industrial Exhibition will most
decidedly never be opened till Doom's-Day.
The Most Liberal Measure of the Session.
It is said, in defence of the very limited accommodation in the new
ouse of Commons, that MR. BARRY, in return for certain interferences
with his plans, made the mistake on purpose, and instead of measuring
the bodies of 656 members, simply took the measure of their intellect.
Judged by this new standard of measurement, we are compelled to con-
ſess that not only is there plenty of accommodation in the new House,
but that it is much too large for any purpose to which the present Par-
liament can possibly devote it.
LIBERAL PATRONAGE.
We are informed that Government has, with the greatest liberality
granted MR. BRIGHT the use of Leicester Square for trying, on a sm
scale, the experiment of Cultivation of Cotton in India.

out with a new “Inspiration.”. It pro-
mises, we think, to divide the public ear with
his famous Row Polka, for it is in every
measure as noisy. It is called the “Derby
Polka,” but why, Derby, we cannot make
out. It is true that JULLIEN imitates the
action of a jockey, and uses his baton as a
whip; and that many of the instruments run
a dre race together, to see which shall
come in first ; and that a bell rings to an:
nounce that the fiddles have started; and
that JULLIEN drops down on his chair, as
an intimation that the cornet-à-piston has
won; still so many things are wanting to
complete the picture of the Derby, that the
Polka was deficient in that strik Werl-
similitude for which all JULLIEN’s Polkas are
loudly distinguished. -
In other respects, JULLIEN acts up to his
potamus at the one, and JULLIEN at the
other. Our French ORPHEUs, who º to

He draws fully as much as the Hippopotamus, without, resorting to
the same artifices for catching applause. Besides, the Hippopotamus
has no moments of “Inspiration ; * excepting when he is in the
water, and then he is invisible, he is as heavy as a City,Councilman

frame, half a line in an eighteenpenny advertisement. The Hippopotamus
may just at present have got the start, but, in the long run, JULLIEN
will be sure to leave his bulky competitor far behind him, and we are
prepared to take any odds that he wins the race, even in spite of the
slowness of his Derby Polka. Who'll take a 1000 to 1 on Julli EN
against the Hippopotamus?
A BLINDED NATION.
HoMER was blind, TIRESIAs was blind, MILTON was blind, HANDEI,
was blind; but there never was any cataract, or eyen amaurosis, equal
to the blindness of Prussia. The Times has already informed an indig-
nant nation, that

As there is no way for Punch into Prussia by the Post-Office, that
unfortunate country may be compared (in one solitary respect), to the
immortal author of “Paradise Lost,” having
“Wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.”
Provisional Arrangements for the Ballet.
WE observe that the “PROVIDENT SocIETY of DANCERs” held their
annual meeting on Thursday, last week, in the saloon of the Haymarket
Theatre, the use of which had been afforded to the Charity by
Mr. Webster. The formation of a Provident Society is one of the
best steps that we ever heard of on the part of the Terpsichorean body.
The knowledge that dancers are actuated by forethought will give us
additional pleasure in witnessing a ballet, and we shall re their
bounding movements with the ter satisfaction from the consider-
ation that they look before they leap. We hope that the Public will not
be wanting in support to this Association for providing, boiled mutton
in old age to those who, in youth, have so often gratified them with
capers.

A Miser ABLE CHARACTER.—“I tell F'. Sir, he is a mean man! I
really believe, Sir, that man is capable of robbing the toll-box of South-
wark Bridge"
A LITTLE SPEECH FROM A LITTLE BLUE-COAT
BOY.
Forty boys connected with Christ's Hospital, waited with a deputa-
tion of the Masters upon HER Esty, previous to the last Drawing-
Room. This is a visit paid, we believe, every year, when the boys
exhibit their maps, and charts, and drawings, and make a little speech.
As this speech has never been printed, we are too happy to have it, in
one respect, to give a verbatim report.
The speech on this occasion was made by a youth, whose humble
garb showed too plainly the lowness of his condition. He was dressed,
it is true, in the uniform of this school, but his clothes were made of
such poor material, that they betrayed the struggle that had evidently
been made to attire him, even respectably. His appearance deeply en-
rossed the sympathy of HER Esty, who listened with the most
vely interest to every word of the following address:—
“MAY IT PLEASE YouT MAJESTY, -
“We belong to a School which was called by the good Bishop
of Calcutta the noblest, institution in the world.” We are all poor
boys; there is not a rich boy amongst us; we are, every boy of us, the
children of poor persons. If it were not for Christ's Hospital we should
receive no education at all, for our parents are much too poor to educate
us. We should be running about the streets, and getting into all sorts
of mischief, and perhaps turn out bad characters, and make our parents
ashamed of us. But now they have no fear of that sort, they know
that we are fed and lodged and educated all for nothing, and they are
º to get us into so good an institution. Many rich persons try to
et their sons into Christ's Hospital—which is a great compliment to
the school—but it will not do; they only try in vain, for it would not
be fair, YoUR MAJESTY, that rich boys should receive the benefits which
were intended by our good King and Founder, Edwarp VI., only for
‘ destitute orphans’ and poor boys. Our Governors are often teased out
of their lives to give ‘presentations’ to persons who keep their carriages;
but they º at those persons, and ğ. there are Eton, and West-
minster, and Harrow for those who have money, but that Christ's
Hospital was built and endowed only for those who have no money for
the education of their children. We are at present more than 1200 boys
on the foundation, and I can say, without telling a fib, YoUR MAJESTY,
that there is not the son of a nobleman, or an alderman, or a common
councilman, or anything of that sort, amongst us. We should like You R
MAJESTY to come and see us and getus a holiday, and then YoURMAJESTY
could judge for yourself whether what I have been telling you is not the
truth. But please YoUR MAJESTY, Ishould like you to come on a week-
day—I mean not on a visiting-day; for Your MAJESTY might think that
the carriages you saw then waiting outside, were the carriages of our
fathers, and nothers, which would bºoing a great injusticº to an
Institution of which I am a . .' I i. YoUR MAJESTY
will come, and I will promise You R MAJESTY to sing ‘God save the Queen’
all the days of my life.”
The QUEEN patted the pretty, little yellow-stockinged boy on the
head, and promised him “she would be sure to come.” #. promise has
thrown the boys into the greatest tumult of delight, but the Governors
of Christ's Hospital are in a state of feverish consternation, lest the In-
stitution should not exactly come up to the expectation of HERMAJESTY.
Strange to §. key of the strong chest, in which is locked up the
Charter of Christ's Hospital, has the last few days been missing. We
only hope it will be forthcoming on the occasion of the royal visit, as it
may give HER MAJESTY a key, in more senses than, one, to the real
intentions of the munificent founder of this much libelled charity.
American Independence.
THERE never was such a thorough specimen of natural American
Independence as was exhibited at the Botanical Gardens in the
Regent's Park, by the celebrated, American plants which were adver-
tised to appear in full bloom, at least three weeks earlier than they
condescended to show themselves. Everyone was asking a month ago,
how it was that the American plants did not show according to promise
but º obstinately remained shut ºp in their buds, as if when looke
for to blossom, their reply had been “If I do, I'm blowed.”
SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING.
... WE cannot sufficiently express our surprise. There was a Protec-
tionist Meeting at Salisbury lately, followed by a disturbance. There
was nothing so very surprising in that, for the one always follows the
other. But Mr. FERRAND was present at the meeting, and yet his name
does not appear amongst the speakers. We can only account for this
extraordinary accident by supposing that the Hon. M. P. was actively
engaged at the time pursuing his new vocation. Depend upon it, he
Was busy “wool-gathering.”

1S PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FRIENDLY HINT to Young Ladies who wear Those
DEAR DELIGHTFUL BARêge DREsses. Always LET THE
Slip (or whatever. The Mysterious GARMENT is called),
BE. As LoNG as THE OUTER DREss?
A NIGHT OF PLEASURE AND “PROPHETE.”
In a Letter from a Foung Man in Town to a Foung Man in the Country.
“MY DEAR Guss,
“I THINK by this time I have lº you all over town. I
have taken you to every Exhibition, and made you follow me through
every Long Acre of a Panorama, that is at present dragging its slow
length along the Continental streets of London. You must be tired,
old fellow; for pleasure grows tiresome, even when we have nothing to
pay for it. One more visit, and then I will let you off, for really this
weather is getting too warm for sight-seeing.
“In all my excursions through this fairy Maze of Wonders, I have
endeavoured to send you the feelings with which I have enjoyed each
of them. I hope you have seen them in the same light, and derived as
much pleasure from the yiew as I have done. . If so, the many shillings,
the pocket-full of half-guineas I have expended infeasting my eyes, have
performed double duty; and I shall, expect you on my return to the
country, to refund me at least one-half of the handsome little fortune I
have disbursed in prosecuting our mutual expedition in search of pleasure.
“This is a bargain; and, on the faith of it, I do not mind taking you
to the Opera. The cab is at the door, so get out your opera-glass, and
as you read this letter, put on a white neckcloth and a pair of white
kid gloves, and fancy you are seated in the middle of the pit of the
Royal Italian Opera. I send you the bill and the book, so that nothing
may be wanting tº help the delusion; and that you may be convince
at once that it is Thursday evening june 27th, 1850. Set your watch
at eight o'clock precisely, and the charm will be perfect.
“You are a lucky fellow, Guss; for if you look at the bill, you will
see what a treat there is in store for you. It is the Prophète—an opera
in four acts, which has never been performed anywhere in London,
but at the Italian Opera House. I am no musician, you know, and it
is fortunate for you that I am not. Otherwise how I might have
dazzled you with a grand display of musical fireworks! I would have
astonished you with such a discharge of ten thousand arpeggios, mixed
with a flying shower of softenutos, and whirling, whizzing, hissing,
cracking Galt's, &c. &c., that you should have heard nothing, seen
nothing, and understood still less. As it is, in my profound ignorance
of musical pyrotechny, I can only send you a poor, dry, catalogue of
my sensations, and the effect the Opera produced upon me. -
“The effect was that of reading a beautiful story, or, rather, of listen.
ing to a beautiful story whilst it was being read to me by some
loved voice. I seemed to read with my ears. The interest began at
once: I was charmed from the very first page. Events rapidly followed
events, and were told in such lovely language, that it became a pain
when the lecture ceased, and I longed for it to continue, so that the
pleasure might flow on uninterruptedly to the end. The finish of each
act was like the interruption of a ‘bore that drops in for five minutes,
and makes a black gap in the perusal of some exciting romance. The
relief you feel at his * when you can resume your enjoyment,
was the same I experienced when the curtain again rose, and my ears
were enabled to .. up once more the broken thread of the melodious
narrative. The opera was a long, stirring, musical romance. As I
it, I became conscious of nothing else. I knew no more that I was in
the pit of that theatre, than a schoolgirl who is secretly reading a novel
at night knows that she is in bed. º own feelings were interested in
the fates of that poor Fides, who, writhing at her son's feet, more like a
worm than a human being, liſts her drooping head, and º with her
eyes to be crushed sooner than to be called upon to deny him. But her
son is in danger: a hundred poniards are pointed at his breast, and,
with a heart that almost breaks audibly in your ear, she shrieks out the
‘No!’ that saves his life.
“I am afraid to go into extacies, Guss, in case you should laughat me,
but, my dear boy, I shall never forget the interest of that scene. No
boºk ºver chained me to its livin pages with half the force of that
terrible contest between mother and son. I am sure my own existence
ceased. I was not in Covent Garden Opera, but in that same Cathedral
of Munster, watching the growing intensity of the struggle, and longi
to lift up the crushed form of the mother, as she lay fimbled to deat
upºn the pavement. With the shriek of denial, that, sounded as if it
had been wrung by some iron instrument from her soul, the curtain fell
like a portcullis, and I was astonished to find a great chandelier of gas
glittering over my head. I was a prisoner for another half-hour till the
rising of the curtain set me at liberty again to pursue my delightful
story. The conclusion is mournful, like the conclusion of most romances,
but one passage delighted me beyond all limits. Fides and the Prophète
meet in the prison to which she has been condemned. The mother
pours her burning reproaches on her son's guilty head. He, so recently
triumphant, cringes now before the just wrath of his disowned mother,
and at last falls on his knees, and with self reproaches implores her
forgiveness. She, so lately trodden upon, now towers above him. It
is her turn now to triumph, and she is about to disown the son who so
publicly disowned her, when her turns to pity, and she only
triumphs, in opening her arms to fold him to her breast.
“Guss, I must not make my letter too long, or else you will never
read it, and I should like you to read to the end of my stupid rhapsodies,
if it was only to share the exquisite enjoyment, the almost new sensation
of Fº music spoke to me that night with almost a new voice
-I revelled in that same Thursday evening. The music of the
Prophète is the conversation of a cherished friend, who talks to enter-
tain you, and not for the meresake of talking. Youlisten unconsciously,
are pleased, charmed, and are only aware that it is music when the music
stops. Here and there a pretty expression, a poetical thought rises to
the surface of the conversation, but, generally speaking, the words fit so
aptly to the subject chosen, are so plain and yet so expressive, that
you would feel inclined to call it common-place if it were not for the
general feeling of happiness it leaves upon your mind when it is all over.
“The illustrations, too, of this beautiful romance are in the most
complete and artistic keeping, as if nothing should be wanting to mar
the perfection of the whole. Never has LoNGMAN, nor MURRAY, with
all their profuse liberality, produced a book in all its details so gorgeous
as the Prophete. The Čºronation scene would not disgrace West-
minster Abbey, and the dresses seem as if they had been dyed in one
of MAcLise's pictures, so vividly bright is their colouring. -
“Another act was added to the Prophète the evening I was present,
Guss, and it was an act that materially heightened the enjoyment, the
witching surprise, of the whole entertainment. The act in question was
played by the audience, if playing can be applied to anything so natural,
so real, and so unaffected. It was when the QUEEN entered the theatre.
It was but three hours after she had been attacked by one, whose
only excuse for his action is, that he is insane, and so has ceased to
have the feelings of a man. Upon her entrance, up rose the whole
theatre, moved by the same strong impulse, to congratulate the QUEEN
upon the happiness of her escape. F. heard such shouting it
was the very madness of affection. It was a deafening tumult of love,
in which a thousand voices were trying to outvie one another in giving
the loudest expression to their sympathy. It was a loyal competition
of sound, in which a thousand hearts were thrown, like so many hats
simultaneously into the air, every one of them struggling which coul
be thrown the highest. Then came god Sare the §º and soothed
the angry waters into something like a calm regularity of flow, until
the surging voices rose musically together, and formed one loud swelling
wave .# devotion and enthusiasm. The QUEEN smiled, and held out
her hand, with outstretched º as if her heart was inside it; and, to
my fancy, it is the very best Ball of State she can carry before her. It
is Ball and Sceptre melted into one
“My paper is exhausted, and so must be your patience, Guss; but
I have been so pleased, that I could not keep myself within reasonable
bounds. Extend your usual good-nature to

Sunday have the very best intentions; so, no doubt, had . well-
meaning, but rather violent º: who once upon a time roasted their
kind in Smithfield. There is, therefore, a sort of best intention, which
it is, the duty of the selected victim of well-meaning earnestness, to
knock down, get rid of, in the shortest and concisest manner possible.
Where best intention will put his nose into the affairs of his neighbours,
the more vigorously the said nose is wrung, the better, says Punch.
Best intention has for a time, closed the Sunday letterbox 3 very well;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DLARY OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.
As many of our country readers naturally feel anxious to know how
the º: asses his time in a strange land, where he is so far
away from home ...' all his relations, we have gone to the expense of pro-
curing the following particulars, which are now printed for the first time.
The Hippopotamus gets up generally about six. The first º:
does is to wag his tail; he then ts, nodding his head all the while
to the Arabian, which is his peculiar method of saying “Good morning!”
At seven he has a pail of porridge and maize, which he prefers to tea or
coffee. . After that he washes his hands—we mean his feet—in the tank
which is | in his room as his washhand-basin. He sleeps till ten,
when he turns out to receive the numerous company that is always
waiting to see him. He takes several rounds in the park that is attached
to his dwelling-house, bowing to his guests politely as he passes ...;
After this exertion, he lies down in the hottest patch of sand he can pi
out, and curling himself up, till he looks like an immense ball of india-
rubber, he goes fast º: He rarely wakes up till the latter part of
the day, when his first thought is to run and tap at the door of the
Giraffes, who hang out in the next room to him. This act of civility
over, he, takes his bath, which sometimes lasts two or three hours.
During this time very little more than his nostrils are visible above the
water. The fact is, the hº is of a modest, retiring dis-
position, and likes to hide himself as much as possible from the public
eye. At six o'clock he leaves his bath and retires to his bed-room. He
never sees any one after six. A small bucket of porridge and maize, of
which he is amazingly fond, is brought to his bedside, and the Arab boy
feeds him with a spoon. . After this he generally feels very sleepy, and
lies down. He lays his head on the '.. lap, and, throwing his legs
round his neck, is very quickly in the arms of MoRPHEUs.
Proper Names for Litigants.
LAST week there came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Judicature at Bombay,
in an action to which the parties were Dolubi Ass PETTEMBERDAss
AND OTHERs v. RAMLOL THAckoors EYDAss AND OTHERs. The re-
markably euphonious names of these Indian gentlemen may provoke a
smile; but they ought also to suggest a reflection; namely, that people

LINES TO HENRY BROUGHAM ON HAVING BEEN GOOD.
How much more pleasant ’tis to praise
Than to rebuke or blame;
We’d rather say “Well done !” than raise
The cry of “Fie, for shame!”
For instance, now, when HENRY 's good
It always gives us joy–
How much we wish he never would
Act like a naughty boy!
And HENRY has been good and brave,
A check to try and put
On Mawworms who, on Sunday, have
Our letter-boxes shut.
Thus to behave is prettier
Than being, even in fun,
Rude to a foreign Minister,
Or rude to any one.

PUNCH TO THE WORLD ! !
The reader is respectfully requested to remain calm while perusing the
following merely preliminary announcement of an intended EXTRA
NUMBER, which has been for some time in preparation, and will be
published during the month. It is felt necessary to break by degrees the
particulars of this startling fact. We do not at present feel ourselves
justified in going further into detail, but ice simply intimate to everybody
the necessity of restraining his curiosity and preparing his threepence, until
it may be deemed erpedient for us to satisfy the former and receive the
latter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

“THERE, BABY DEAR, Look AT THE PRETTY SoLDIERs!”
A BIT OF MY MIND.
BIT THE ELEVENTH.
MRS. MOUSER SUGGESTs A DOMESTIC IMPROVEMENT As REGARDS THE
ExHIBITION OF 1851.
MR.PUNCH-At this minute I write in deepest darkness. Whether
Hyde Park, as MR. MouseR says, is to be roofed in as a brick tenement
or whether the world’s to meet in Battersea Fields, is at the moment f
hold my quill in the bosoms of the Fates. Destiny, no doubt, has already
taken her measures; and all we have to do is to sit quiet, like Patience
on her monument, and wait for 'em. Though, if I may be allowed, as a
fragment of the female public, to give my mind upon the matter, I would
certainly object, to what MRs. HoRNRLow ER, calls the desecration of
Hyde Park by bricks and mortar, and with 'em no end of chimneys.
To be sure, I’m told that there’s to be an Act of Parliament to compel
the chimneys, for the sake of the herbage and the trees, to digest
their own smoke, -but I’ve no faith in 'em. It’s all very well to talk
about Aphrodite coals; but there can be no Aphrodite without fire,
and no fire without smoke. But this is not the grist of my present
writing.
What I burn to make public is this. Whenever the Exhibition may
be gº. whatever it may have to show, from a piece of the walls
of China, to snow-balls from the North Pole—the whole business will
be a mocking-bird, an illusion and a snare, if conducted wholly and
solely by the monopolists, as I am bold to call 'em, of the creation,-
need I observe, mere men? Unless the mind of woman sets her mark
upon the show, it will be nothing more than a big, selfish bachelors'
rty of all the world; or, what’s the same thing, a Club House of the
rds of the Creation (as they give the nobility to themselves), with
the Ladies stopping at home. A proposal, throbbing at the heart of
your humble servant, carried out at the fullest extent, would make a
very different thing of it. ..
MR. HoRNBLower—(I dislike the man, for I never know—or rather
Idoknow, too well—when MouseR goes out with him, when he’ll come
back)—MR. HoRNBLower, the other night ºf in, and as usual
all over tobaccosmoke, remarked that the whole world would be packing
". its carpet bag by next º directed “London:” men from the
ountains of the M. Timbuctoo, and the Beginning of the Nile.
“There’ll be a pattern-book of colours.”—(MR. H. is a tailor in a great
way, and inventor of the Butterfly Paletót, though he might, as I say,
leave his shop at home when he comes into other people's drawing:
rooms; especially, who are not tailors)—“a pattern-book of colours of
all the men in the world.” “And why not,” said I, “of the women
too? How, in an Exhibition of all the world, can the women be left
out? Why, without 'em,”—said I, for I felt my blood rising; and
if I hadn't felt it, I could have seen it in MouseR's looks, who, when
I’ve my heart at my lips, too often likes to frown it back again-
“without 'em,” said I, not seeming to see MouseR, “without 'em, the
great globe itself, as somebody calls it, would be only like a plum-
pudding cut in half; and I won’t say—or I could—which half is the
richest and the best, with most of the fruit and spice in it. Why not
all the women, too?” I repeated in a voice that, I could see it, rather
astonished MR. HoRNBLow ER; “if we are to have the Lords of the
Mountains of the Moon, why not the Ladies of the Moon too ! If the
GREAT CHAM’s to come, as MouseR calls him, why not the GREAT
CHAMEss? Are we always to be left at home at gala times; thrown
into a corner like every-day clothes, as if we weren't good and handsome
enough to be worn on holidays?”
Well, Mr. Punch, this question—which MR. HoRNBLower couldn't
answer, and therefore, in a mean way, he shifted his ground, as I after-
wards heard, to some tavern; taking, of course, MouseR with him—this
question remaining, I may say, in my mind, went to bed with me;
and the consequence was, one of the sweetest dreams that ever came to
anybody in the world upon goose-feathers. All the sweeter and prettier
too, because it can be carried out, when the world’s wide-awake; there
º in it that isn't as plain as pancakes. Which is this:
I dreamt that the Exhibition, which wasn't in Hyde Park after all,
though, being awake, I can't be sworn where—was, as it ought to be, a
palace of very crystal, the skylooking through every bit of the roof upon
all nations under it. And the nations, Mr. Punch, were in my m,
as they should be, not represented by halves, but men and wives com-
plete. Here and there it was like a tulip-bed with beautiful creatures
of all colours, from the lily-white Circassian—(though, after all, none
of 'em came up to the Red and White Roses of England, as I’m bold
to call myself and country-women,)—to the tawny Cherokee. . And
there they were, some of 'em with their children little and big, sprinkled
about—among the goods of All Nations—the Chinese lady on her
chest of gunpowder—the Turkish with prize rhubarb—the woman
from the Sandwiches with grass baskets—the Russian lady with black
fur boas—the maidens of Cachemire with such loves of shawls, like
being wrapped in Paradise—the Persian Sultaness with otto of roses
º a real American lady from California with necklaces of gold-dust
and virgin ear-rings to match.
t may be said, this is all very well in a dream. But why, I ask—as
I asked of MouseR when I woke—why shouldn’t it be carried out in
broad, daylight? Why, when the Chinaman tea-dealer comes to Hyde
Park himself-supposing it to be Hyde Park—why should his poor wife,
with crushed foot and broken spirit, be left at Pekin at home? If
we’re to have Russian merchants with their beards, why not their
wives with their boast. If we’ve a Cachemire man in a turban, why
and wherefore not a Cachemire maid, in a shawl? Without the other
and superior sex, as I insist on calling them, it will be an Exhibition of all
the World } halves, and the worst halves too, as I needn't insist upon.
Besides, if the Exhibition’s to be only carried out with men, what it
pretends to go for will go for nothing. “The Show,” says Mouse
‘will tighten the bonds of peace; will draw people across seas, an
mountains close to one another.” I don’t believe a bit of it, if the
women of all nations are to be kept at home. Let 'em all come with
their fathers, husbands, and sweethearts-let us have a great Petticoat
Meeting of all the World, when the Exhibition’s done—and then, if we
don’t bind the world over to keep the peace; if we do not send gun-
Fº out of fashion: and pluck all th. armies of the earth of their
eathers like geese at Michaelmas don't let us ever open our mouths
again, that’s all; and I can’t say more. - -
Poor women are never more scandalised in one earthly thing than in
this—they are snubbed with admiring soldiers. To love the fine
clothes—the gold lace—the fluttering feathers—the flags of silk and
'broidery that flap so proud in the wind: they are said to dote upon
the colour of red; º quite the reverse of turkeys, to run after it with
pleasure and happiness. Mr. Punch, this is only one of the hundreds
of unmanly vulgar errors that the other sex invent against us. Give us
our meeting of the Ladies of All, Nations at the Exhibition that’s
coming; and, if we don’t make all the world embrace in peace and
quietness, never again put faith -
In yours, most faithfully,
The Honeysuckles. AMELLA MouseR.
P. S. The Nepaulese Ambassador reads Punch. It is translated for
him, MouseR tells me, with his morning's curry, by the young man, who,
for the last two or three years, swept the Cheapside ºf Will #.
then, beg of his Excellency, the N. A., not to go about as he does from
#. party with those aggravating emeralds—those heart-breaking
amonds? Even Duchesses—as I say to MouseR, who, upon m
word, I don't think quite believes me—Duchesses are but mortal fles
and blood; and it isn't in either one or tºother to see that shower of
diamonds on one cap-and that cap a man's; for, after all, except for
a ring, or perhaps a shirt stud, men have no business with diamonds
which, in my opinion, were created for women only—it isn't in mortal
flesh to see those precious jewels, and always to know what to do with
one's fingers. It was only last week that at the – fête, I was crowded
very close to Juggur Jum, and upon my word—for we’re wonderfully
made-looking at his diamonds, with the tips of my fingerstingling,
I did feel myself, whether I would or not, almost getting—as Mouser
says—very near the Old Bailey.

WHAT MAY, OR MAY NOT BE EXHIBITED
Tô H. R. H. PRINCE ALBERT,
This simple Design for the proposed Building in Hyde Park is humbly submitted by
THE ARCHITECT.
IN MAY, 1851.
THERE are various wholesome “conditions and limita-
among others, there is a clause declaring that “all
spirits, wines, and fermented liquors, unless derived
from unusual sources, are inadmissible.” We think
there will be some difficulty in acting upon this
vision, and that many illicit distillers, who “do their
iriting gently” in a back attic, may claim to exhibit
their productions as having been derived from unusual
sources. We can scarcely, perhaps, regard the Cham-
º yielded by the too generous gooseberry as coming
rom an “unusual source,” for, alas! the transition
from the gooseberry bush to the Champagne bottle is
only too natural. Port wine, too, must for the
same reason be shut out, inasmuch as, although Oporto,
as far as its wine-producing purposes are concerned,
may be looked for in the map of London, still this
does not constitute an “unusual source,” as the fact is
that most of our Port is made at home by a sloe,
but by no means uncommon process.
cox TRARY to commons’ sensE.
REALLY Loºp John Russellought to take the sense
of the House of Commons respecting the propriety of con-
tinuing the present Sunday arrangements in the Post-
Offices. We have suffered quite enough by this timefrom
the non-sense of the House in regard to that matter.
THE TERRORS OF THE THAMES.
It is alarming to contemplate how many inhabitants of London are
annually drinking themselves to death by imbibing the water of the
Thames. We have given to a certain spirit the name of aqua vitae,
and in distinction we should bestow on the river the title of aqua mortis
for not even aqua fortis is of a more destructive nature than the stuff
which flows through our cisterns into our urns, which might º
be termed funereal urns, from their devotion to deadly urposes. ere
are "...º. who find a watery grave than those who come to their
end by drowning. We have heard that water will always find its level
but if the Thames water found its proper level it would be banishe
from all decent society. Let any one who delights in Rambles by
Rivers, take a stroll along the banks of the Thames between Limehouse
and Battersea. He would, after going a yard or two, find himself up
to his knees in slush—the sort of º Death which we are daily
drinking—and though every step, would add mud, there would be
nothing to ad-mire. Let him watch the juvenile bathers on the banks,
and he will fancy himself just arrived on a foreign shore, whose natives
are negroes up to their knees, while from the legs upwards they belong
to a white opulation. -
. If we º not happen to know the source of the Thames, we should
imagine it was an arm of the Black Sea, or a leg of the Niger, or a
black eye of old father NEPTUNE. It is said that every one, on an
average, eats in his lifetime a peck of dirt, but we are convinced that
every one who drinks Thames water consumes his peck of dirt in a
week or two.
It does not require much knowledge of chemistry to analyse the
contents of the river, for a mere glance of the eye will satisfy the casual
observer that the Thames holds in solution a considerable uantity of
ead canine, as well as feline, and other animal matter, together with a
strong infusion of cabbage-leaves and miscellaneous vegetable refuse,
with the voluntary !. of the various sewers of the metropolis.
Now that the eyes of the public are opened to the state of the Thames,
we wonder that their mouths are not peremptorily shut against it.
FASHION FOR COQUETTES.
In the “Fashions for July,” Le Follet makes the statement that-
“For a young married lady who only goes out in her carriage, and is proverbial for
coquetry, a splendid mantelet of sky-blue taffetas, embroidered in bouquets of roses, of
white floss silk, and trimmed with two flounces of point d'Angleterre, with a narrow
ruche of blue ribbon, is now being prepared.”
A rather simpler costume than this, we should think, would be appro-
priate to the young married lady who is proverbial for coquetry, as the
style of dress to make her public appearances in. The attire that would
best suit her would be a plain white sheet; and, instead of a parasol, a
large mould candle in her hand would set off the coquettish garment to
remarkable advantage.
THE SMOKE NUISANCE.
INAs Much as that meddling body, the Commissioners of Sewers, has
instructed Mr. Sºon, the Medical officer of Health of the City of
London, (and, as suc 5 considerably overpaid in the estimation of
London's wizard, SIR PETER LAURIE), to report upon the smoke of
London, with a view to putting down the said smoke; and inasmuch
as any successful attempt to such effect must be followed by a decrease
of income of certain parties, who rightfully consider º a vested
interest, it is ºf by Punch that compensation be duly made to the
under-mentioned individuals:-
To all London painters and gilders, to whom smoke is the means of
daily bread; they consuming the same in the shape of wages for house-
painting, gilding of weathercocks, the three balls of pawnbrokers, &c.
ºf laundresses, to whom London smoke-upon the strictest calcu-
lation—is worth two shirts a week per head of the working classes.
To all soap-boilers, smoke being at the present time their most
profitable patron.
To all London florists, London smoke being to myrtles, roses, &c.,
the air they breathe, and having it, droop and die.
And, finally, to the Dean an Chapter of St. Paul's Cathedral, that
edifice, after a time, losing its customary coat of coal soot." A coat so
significant, and distinguishing; inasmuch, as the pile having been
originally built upon a tax on London coal, it has up to the present
time appeared in Wallsend black. However, with London smoke
abolished, the dirtiest spots pertaining to St. Paul's will be the hands of
the money-takers.
PUGNACITY OF THE PARTY PRESS.
WHEN we speak of the pugnacity of the Party Press, we do not
allude to the parties in politics, but to the parties of the fashionable
world, whose chronicles are couched sometimes in language befitting
such a circle only as the Prize Ring.
We read the other day the account of a party given by that benevo-
lent and amiable lady, Miss BURDETT Courts, who was, we are told
by the reporter, “supported right and left by the ARchbishop of CAN-
TERBURY and the American Minister, and faced by the MARCHIoness
of WESTMINstER.” Now when we read about “right and left,”
and “facers,” we are reminded rather of a passage in Bell's Life than
of an article in a journal whose ordinary regard to the “proprieties”
is inconsistent with this unseemly mixing up of archbishops, ambassa-
dors, and marchionesses, with “facers,” “right and left,” and other
jargon of a decidedly pugilistic colour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL - 23
THE BLACK PRINCE.
HE Nepaulese Ambassador
and his suite are being drag-
ed round the town, and
onised at every place of
entertainment to such an
extent that their names are
beginning to be looked for
as part of the attraction in
the bill of every suburban
tea-garden. They are to
be found enjoying the Bag:
pipes playing the Hieland
}ºie Scottish
Fête, the balloon at Waux-
hall, and the terrific ascentof
the intrepid MADAME SOME-
Body at Cremorne. They
have been advertised as a
strong half-price to the Sur-
rey, and we may shortly
expect, them to be seen
sympathising with the re-
cognised victim of...every-
thing unmerited at the Victoria. Such are their ideas of magnificence,
that they offer to purchase everything they see, from the services of the
crossing sweeper at St. Paul’s Church Yard, to those of the dancing Lords
and Ladies at affe given in honour of the strangers by a distin D-. hed
member of the aristocracy. So delighted were the Nepaulese Princes
with the specimen of the fashionable ballet of private life which was set
before them, that they looked upon the dancing Dukes and Duchesses,
Lords and Ladies, as a troupe of coryphées and enquired of the noble
host the terms on which the corps could. be transplanted entire to
Nepaul, for the amusement of the native Prince in his own palace,
hough the illustrious strangers are easily amused, it is very difficult
to provide them with an entertainment in the truly English sense of the
term, which includes the celebrated knife and fork exercise, without
which we fancy we can never do the civil thing to a foreigner. The
Nepaulese Ambassadors will share in our amusements readily, enough;
they will cry, “Oh, oh!” at our Vauxhall fire-works; they will exclaim
“brava” with us at the grace of CARLOTTAGRISI, and the pºlitº offer
of a private box would probably bring them to join in the cry of “Bravo,
Ix,” at the Britannia Saloon; but when we come to ask them, to
dinner, then it is that we discover their uncongeniality with our habits
and feelings. If they accept our invitation they walk away directly the
meal is served, and i. popular notion is that they eat nothing but what
they kill at the moment. - -
The only way we can suggest in which to entertain them after their
own hearts—by setting before them something they can kill and eat at
the same time is to place before them a few dozens of nice fresh, live,
unopened oysters, and thus they would be able to enjoy the luxury of
illing and eating the natives. At all events, in spite of little differ-
ences in our habits and customs, it is delightful to see the Nepaulese
Princes, mixing with all classes of English society, and we have no
doubt that, by brushing about, a brilliant polish will be imparted in
time to Nature's blacking.
PLATITU DES.
(By our Old Codger).
THE French Republic is always represented with a Phrygian head-
dress. The fittest ornament for it, I think, would be a “Mob-cap.”
I do abominate all parrots, perroquets, and cockatoos, and the awful
noises they make. I am sure they are only tolerated by ladies, because
they are such “delicious creatures” (screechers). -
It is very curious that men never know they have grey hairs. The
discovery is always made for them by other people. -
We are astonished at the Ostrich for swallowing pennies, and yet I
know a }. man who has devoured £100,000, and, strange to say, he
is thought nothing of. - -
There is no peace-maker in the world like a good dinner.
There are partners almost in .# business, but I never recollect
seeing two partners keeping a public-house. Is it because drinking
tends to quarrelling 2 - - -- -
We do not dislike men, so much who are ruining themselves—it is
only when they are ruined.
rance should be painted, like Fortune, standing on a wheel—for she
seems to have quite a turn for revolutions.

If you wish to hear all your faults freely canvassed, have your portrait
taken, and invite your friends to come and keep you company.
The best part of a public dinner is that there are no children after
dessert.
THE BELGRAVIANS” LAMENT.
(Being a MS. which dropped out of Col—N–L S.–BTH-P’s hat during
the Debate of Thursday Night.)
THERE is a sound of sorrow through Wilton's Crescent fair;
The Dowagers of Lowndes Street are tearing of their hair;
The muffins stand in Eaton Square uneaten on the plate; |
The footmen group in º round many an area gate. |
And rents and hearts are going down in paltry Albert Row, |
Aghastly line of blank “To Lets” the #. oor windows show;
The white cross on the old Park elms the sorry lodger sees,
And straight prepares his trunk to go, like the unhappy trees.
The word is spoke—'tis past a joke—Hyde Park the spot shall be,
Where to the skies shall soon arise the #. of Industry—
Pile high the bricks, the mortar mix, knock up the scaffold-poles
Tread out the green, cut up the turf, with ruts, and hills, and holes.
The Prince commands—in ready hands the trenchant axe is nigh:
Soon maimed and marred, upon the sward, the headless trunks will lie.
Wain º law, BROUGHAM's power of jaw, and SIBTHORP's
Jolly row—
A Prince to please, not only trees, but Woods and Forests bow. |
When sudden, hark, into the Park wide Albert Gates are flung,
And lo! a band that suppliant stand, the noble, fair and young;
Right well we know of #. Row the glory and the pride,
The Maidens in their habits, the noble Swells beside.
Then up and spake a lady—that round her neck did wear
A halter for a habit-shirt—a la EustAcE St. PIERRE:
“Our necks are thine, all in a line to string up, if you please;
And none shall cut us down, if you will not cut down the trees.
cc. #. but these trunks, we give our heads; and ladies, as they ride,
In days to come will talk of us for Rotten Row that died;
'Tis no plebeian !. thus rudely you invade;
The sacred ride for noble swells and high-born ladies made.
There’s Regent's Park is parvenue; there's Battersea is low;
What harm to cut up snobbish turf, and 'sparagus also?
Qr is there not the Isle of Dogs by Thames’ salubrious side?
Oh, thither you might cut your stick, and cut no stick beside.
“But to come down on Rotten Row, to mar “The Ladies’ Mile!”
To spifflicate the railings, where lean the gents and smile !
Oh, pale, I trow, sweet cheeks will grow, that, wan from ball-rooms hot,
Repair the galope's ravages with a gallop or a trot.
“Think, cruel Prince, how much there is that with these trees must fall,
The scandal of the drawing-room, the chitchat of the ball—
RQGERs' last not unspread will go; MACAULAY's last good thing
Like a bad shilling ne'er will pass, because it has no Ring /
...Then take our lives, and spare our ride, the only place we know
Where ladies, pent in London, for exercise can go.
'Tis not with us as with our Lords; for they, the Park beside,
Have got the House of Commons, where their hobbies they may ride.”
The Prince looked grim—it was his whim—humbugged he would not be ;
When lo—a stately Lady is kneeling at his knee. -
“I too would ride,” she sweetly cried, “so, ALBERT, if3. please,
Don't—there’s a darling for mysake—please don’t cut down the trees.”
He fain had spurned—and restless turned—but—

THE MOUNTAIN OF LIGHT.
THE presentation of the great diamond, the Mountain of Light, to
HER MAJESTY, at the recent levee, contributed to make it in every
sense of the word a brilliant reception. . It is said that this magnificent
jewel came from the famous peacock throne of the KING OF PERSIA,
and used to adorn the peacock's head, but all we have to say on this
head is, that there is no reliance to be placed on the tale. This valu-
able diamond was given to a Venetian Jew jeweller, to be cut as a rose
but he seems to have had a cabbage rose in his eye, for he resorte
to the untradesmanlike act of cabbaging as much as he could of the
recious material. It weighed, before the cabbaging, nearly 800 carats.
ince then it has been the subject of some half-dozen robberies, and we
believe it has never, until it was made a present to HER. Most GRAcious
MAJEsty, come honestly into the hands of anybody.
Such is our brief history of this Mountain of Light, which, to look at,
appears less of a mountain than a molehill.

LEAVES FROM THE ARTICHOKE.
“Artichoke Hotel, Perriwinks, July 6.
“You R PARDON, MR. PUNCH,
“For thus breaking in upon your important minutes. But I
am the Landlord of the Artichoke Family Hotel, at this rising Watering-
place of Perriwinks—(Sands like a Carpet, and donkies, side-saddle or
otherwise, quiet as sucking babies, besides Čhairs for Invalids, and Flys
for Parties)—which is much patronised by the Nobility and Clergy, with
a great promise of Members of Parliament, Two having gone away, last
season, and anxiously looked for to return. And, Sir, as the Landlord,
and knowing it is the delight of your heart to give a lifting hand, to
struggling worth–(not that it becomes me to say so for myself, but
being so bold as to speak for an innocent wife, and a º continued
every twelvemonth)—I beg leave to call your notice to a habit which is
disgraceful to people # call themselves Ladies and Gentlemen, a
habit of making remarks in the Book which lies upon the Table of every
Respectable Hotel, for the names, and any little compliment they may
choose to taper off, for the Good of the House, and the Credit of the
Landlord. What I stand upon is this: if people aren't satisfied—and
I’ve been too long in business to attempt to satisfy everybody—as little
as they can do is only to put down their names, and say nothing about it.
But no, Sir; they won't do this—but will go on taking away the cha-
racter of everyt in a House, from fleas to Bottled Porter.
“To show you, Mr. Punch, that I do not complain without a cause, I

civil; port good; sherry very nutty; salmon, perhaps, a little
ante-diluvian; and where do they get their iſ. House
commands a noble prospect of the sea, when it covers the mud.
MRs. S.–as a wife and mother—would suggest to any lady to
assure herself that the sheets of this house are aired. Land-
lady civil; but MRs. S. cannot refrain from expressing a suspicion
that all the children have not been vaccinated.
Miss TERESA S. has seen and read of a good many moons;
but can confidently recommend the moon of this place, as it edges
the rippling wave with a fringe of silver.

so bitten in all his life. His opinion is, that some East India
family has slept here, with their luggage; and crossed the fleas

— FELIX Dove, Esq., of Niſhingºlº Lane, Highgate. Here all
alone, and never so happy! Beautiful walks; with an uncommon
quiet coh; Madeira, astonishing for such a place. A little too
much of the British Lion in the brandy—but, , altogether,
delighted. Should jº. Heaven forbid!)—happen

Wonderful place, this, for geography. Only two steps from

maternal creature. The Dove-cot well worthy the attention of

— M.R. SQUAREtoe, Sol., of Size Lane, cannot leave the Arti- h
choke without expressing his disgust, and it is his wish to use
the strongest word—his disgust—at what is called soft sugar,
served in the house with the coffee. MR. SQUARETOE is per-
fectly well acquainted with the elastic properties of the English
law of libel; and, therefore, only expresses a hope–a hope,
it understood—that the spittoons of the Artichoke and the soft
sugar basins are not filled from the same sack.
— MRs. ToMBs, of the Yew Tree, Bury, in quite a Christian
i. and loving her neighbours as herself, would suggest to
the landlady of the house, if it be a necessary evil, consequent
upon keeping hotels, to º chamber-maids,--that it is not, she
submits, equally necessary that the said maids should wear such
very emphatic caps, trimmed with such cherry-coloured ribands.
— ALFRED TOMBs, JUN. (mother being safe in the coach at the
door), has run in to write down in this book, that he thinks the
caps very spicy, and the cherry ribands quite the bounce.
THE MERRY COMMONERS.
HEY for the Merry Commoners! the jocular M.Ps.
How very little wit it takes their little minds to please;
How rampant is their laughter at each attempt at fun;
And gramercy what loud guffaws at every little pund
Hey for the Merry Commoners! who says debates are slow,
When at each sentence out there drops a beautiful bon mot?
So from the newspaper reports the fact at least appears,
For after every paragraph there comes “a laugh’’ or “cheers.”
Hey for the merry Commoners' how jovial their life,
With oceans of facetiousness to season party-strife!
Two hundred jolly Momuses upon the benches sit,
The country to illuminate with ever-sparkling wit.
Hey for the merry Commoners! how nobly they adhere
To what’s been handed down to us from distant year to year !
Attachment to antiquity through all their labours runs;
The spirit of the past pervades their quips, their jokes, their puns.
Hey for the Merry Commoners! how pleasant ’tis to know
That all that’s novel in their jokes to Punch alone they owe
From the debates, each morning, we might select a bunch
Of gems, that prove the Commoners both read and mind their Punch.
THE PUFF DIRECT.
WE looked through the Official Report on the Smoke Nuisance with
intense interest, expecting that the test of all smoke nuisances—the
cigar—would have been at least incidentally touched upon. We regret
to find a total omission of all allusion to the offensive weed, from which
our streets require to be weeded, and we have engaged one of our own
commissioners to throw into form a few facts with reference to the effects
of the cigar smoke nuisance on the health and comfort of the metropolis.
In the first place it is ascertained that cigar smoke, like other smoke,
covers surrounding objects with a black crust; for when puffed in the
face of anyone, the features assume a black look, indicative of extreme
crustiness. It soils the linen of the passers-by to an extent that adds
nearly ten thousand a-year to the washing-bills of the metropolis, to say
nothing of the wear and tear of the tub which lacerates the bosoms of
so many million shirts, and sends home their mangled remains to
thousands of grieving families.
There is no doubt also, that cigar smoke acts as an irritant, for how-
ever much the love º: may induce us to delight in a puff, when
it meets our eye casually, none of us can be said to desire it when it is
administered to our very face in a large volume, and thus cigar smoke
becomes an irritant, of a very exciting character.
For these and other reasons we have come to the conclusion that all
persons choosing to convert themselves into walking chimneys in the
ublic thoroughfares should be compelled to follow the law id down
or engines, and consume their own smoke, as coming under the
description of those “mortal engines” with “rude throats” that
SHAKSPEARE has alluded to.
Hyde and Seek.
It is a pity that so much blindness has been exhibited about the site
of the intended Exposition of the year 1851; for it was easy to have
foreseen that Hyde Park, as one of the lungs of the metropolis, would
not have been willingly surrendered by the Londoners, who require all
their lungs for their very little breathing-time. It has been objected
to Hyde Park also, that it is approachable by neither water nor rail;
but surely this ...} has lately been supplied, for no place could
ave had so much cold water thrown upon it, or been so generally
railed against.

THE LAST MOMENTS OF A CONDEMNED.
“DEAR PUNCH, - -
“I AM the gentleman who used to go every night to the Lions
and Tigers at Drury Lane, in the hope of seeing Van Amburgh devoured.
I am fond of excitement. I went every night but one that MADAME
SACQUI ascended the tight-rope, from the stage to the gallery, and
never shall forgive myself that the only night I missed was when
the rope broke in the middle of the ascent. I love all the national
sports and pastimes of England; but, alas! where are they? Every
one is ually leaving us. Cock-shying has shamefully gone out of
fashion; bull-baiting has followed the same deplorable, mistaken track;
and I cannot sufficiently control my indignation when I mention that
Smithfield is also about to be abolished. I was in the habit of attend-
ing in Cow Lane every market-day, and many a |. hour of excite-
ment have I passed there! How I have been elevated at the enlivenin
cry of “Mad bull!” How my heart has bounded high into the air as
watched the career of that ‘mad bull’ down the street! and how I have
jumped, leaped for joy, when he encountered in his disputed path old
women, children, apple-stalls, and charity schools. I often longed to

decreed in a committee its downfall: Iboldly announce that, if Smithfield
is taken away, I shall exile.myself to Spain, and seek in a foreign land

SABBATARIAN SLANDER.
MY DEAR LORD BROUGHAM, - -
IAM very sorry to be informed that your Lordship is a hater
infidels. If anything can add to the concern which this intelligence gives
me, it is the circumstance that I, myself, am said to be your comrade
and associate in command of the regiment of unbelievers. We are in-
debted, my Lord, to a newspaper called the Christian Times, for
gazetting us two as the captains of that profane corps. Says our cha-
ritable contemporary, alluding to the House of Commons' resolution,
which stopped the delivery of letters and newspapers on Sunday:—
“No sooner had the fact become known, than a deadly, malicious, and calumnious
onslaught was simultaneously made by the non-religious part of the press, and by the
motley horde of religion-haters, under the captaincy of Lord Bhough AM and Mr. Punch.”
Having thus promoted us to be Commanders of the Unfaithful—an
army which a defamatory §§§ calling itself Christian, is rather likely
to procure recruits for—the Sabbatarian print continues:—
“These worthies have written in every form of vehement vituperation and slander;
they have arrogated to themselves all the wisdom of the question, and credited the
advocates of the Sabbath rest with every attribute of folly, intolerance, cant, and
selfishness.”
Now, my dear Lord, don't you think that there are some people who
coolly “arrogate to themselves” the exclusive claim to be §.
I do; and I say that the Sabbatarians are such people; and I totally deny
their pretensions, and assert, and insist, that th. have no more reason
or maintaining their own peculiar and private views to be Christianity
than the Ebionites had, or the Quartodecimans, or the Omphalopsychoi,
mentioned in Church History, who believed their souls to be in their
navels, or, indeed, than the Joanna, Southcoteites, or any other subdi-
the Judaistical observance of Sunday is a mere persuasion, which they
have every right to entertain, certainly; but none whatever to enforce
their own practice in regard to it on others. Let them show me one word
in support of their tenet out of the Book, and I am dumb. If they have
nothing else to offer me than their own infallible authority, I am much
obliged to them, but there is already a Pope at Rome, if i want proof
of that description. Pray enter your protest in the Journal of the
House of Lords against being called an Arch-infidel, because you defend
religious liberty from the encroachments of Sabbatarian fanaticism, and
to your own name adjoin, by proxy, that of the maligned, traduced,
injured, innocent, 33'552C#.

He may, however, send letters by tying a piece of string round them.
and so making parcels of them; but then he must send them by the
railway, and not through the medium of the Post.
He may receive messages by the Electric Telegraph; but he may not
receive those same messages, if folded up in a penny letter and sent
through the Puritanical channel of St. Martin's-le-Grand. .
He may travel on a railway with the Mail-Post; but he is a fool, or
worse—an infidel, if he expects to receive at the destination of his
journey any one of the letters that have been travelling with him every
inch of the way in the same train.
He may buy postage-stamps on a Sunday; but he is forbidden to
receive a letter that is stamped with one, though it is there before him
lying on the counter of the same shop.

paper; but he cannot read it at home unless he chooses to wait

morning. --- - -- -
He may go to hear a political lecture, or attend a Socialist meeting,
or join a van party, or rise at five o'clock in the morning for a cheap
excursion, .. a horse or a donkey, or travel in a cart, carriage
cab, omnibus, steam-boat, velocipede, or balloon; he may do aii
these things, and a quantity more, on a Sunday; but he must be
†. from all letters and newspapers, for none are delivered on
that day.
He may send to the hotel for his dinner, to the wine-stores for his
wine, to the pastry-cook's for his pastry, to the green-grocer's for his
dessert, to the cigar seller's for his tobacco, and they will all be sent
home to him; but he may in vain send to the Post-Office for his letters
and his newspapers, for they will not be given to him, because it
happens to be a Sunday.
THE BEST SITE AFTER ALL FOR THE EXPOSITION
OF 1851.
WHILE every body's ingenuity has been tried to suggest a site for
the Exposition of 1851, there is a site that has been i.i. over-
looked in the most unaccountable manner. The place we speak of
ranks among the Metropolitan Parks, and its adoption will prevent a
necessity for encroaching on the Park of Hyde, the Park of Victori
or the Park of Battersea. The public will at once perceive the eligibility
of the position of that most central of all localities, Whetstone Park,
which is in the very heart of the Metropolis, and may be approached by
almost every kind of conveyance. There are no aristocratic inhabitants
to complain of their neighbourhood being injured; there are no fashion-
able promenaders to cry out against the invasion of their lounge, and
we are quite sure that the residents would most willingly accede to the
selection of the spot for the purposes of the Exhibition.
It cannot be said that any lung of the Metropolis would be stopped
up, for Whetstone Park can never be considered as a lung, and its
temporary filling up would amount to nothing more than a slight ob-
struction of one of the smallest air vessels. We strongly urge upon
the Commissioners the propriety of a survey of the capabilities of this
hitherto forgotten Park, and we hope that º animosity may be buried
at the corner of Little Turnstile.
THE EXCURSION SEASON.
WE are glad to see the usual summer excursions are at their height,
and, though some of the proposed migrations might, from their oddness,
lead to the exclamation of 6. migratious! from the feeble mind, there
is an abundance of reasonable plans for seasonable locomotion. We
confess we do not feel inclined to go literally all the way with some of
those excursionists who are tempted by a promised trip of more than 200
miles to go to Margate or Ramsgate in a single day, by a train that
continues getting progressively later and later, at every station, until
the last traveller finds he has no sooner reached his outward destination
than it is time to take his#. in the train home again. , Nor are we
greatly attracted by the offer of a half-crown marine treat, whose pro;
jector promises to make for no particular point, but to go wherever wind
and tide may bear his gallant vessel. An enterprising tourist, who had
set his heart upon the buoy at the Nore, would be rather º:
at the wind wafting him to Battersea, or his being tied by the tide to a
voyage in a direction quite opposite to that in which he had made up
his mind to travel. One might almost as well advertise an excursion
by 'bus, the route taken to be dependent on the turn the horses might
think proper to take, instead of its being a matter of choice with the
assengers. However, novelty is everything, and there is something
}. and invigorating in the idea of starting to go we don't know
where, from London Bridge and back again.

HIP, HIP, HIP, FOR THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.
EveRYBOBY is still running towards the Regent's Park, for the pur-
pose of passing half an hour with the Hippopotamus. The animal itself
repays public curiosity with a yawn of indifference, or throws coldwater
on the ardour of his yisitors, by suddenly plunging into his bath, and
splashing every one within five yards of him.
Much disappointment has been expressed at the º: in
consequence of its not being exactly up to the general idea of a sea-horse,
and many hundreds go away grumbling every day, because the brute is
not so equestrian in appearance as could be desired. Many persons
thought the Hippopotamus was a regular sea-horse, kept expressly for
running in harness in a sea-captain's gig ; but as the creature turns out
to be very like ºf there are many j. o the entire animal in finding
fault with him." The consumption of milk is still something terrific,
though the pump has been called in as an assistant wet-nurse.]
THE DUELLING SEASON.
THE Duelling Season has set in again at Paris with unusual warmth.
Little parties are made in the Bois e Boulogne, where everything goes
off with the greatest éclat. The festivities are often prolonged to a very
a, late hour in the morning, after which the guests generally adjourn to
Some % on the Boulevards, at which champagne is the “order” of the
day. This plan of entertainment is prevalent now amongst men of all
parties, and politicians of all colours. If two members are at all distant,
a Duel is at once proposed, and they are brought together again in the
most conciliatory manner. A pupil of the Ecole de Médecine is engaged,
and some pistols are borrowed, more for the form of the thing than any.
thing else, and the two angry foes never meet without separating the
best of friends. This form of invitation, however, has not been so
fashionable lately amongst the Members of the Left, as it was discovered
from certain reports, which unfortunatel turned out too true, that
many of the Montagnards were not worth their “powder and shot.”

A GROWL FROM THE BOUDOIR,
“R-R-R-R-R-ow! . . . .
, “SoMEBODY, Mr. Punch, has heen
writing lately to the Morning Post to complain
of ferocious dogs.” The grievance of this in-
dividual is, that there is no remedy against a
dog till a person has been bitten by him. It
is rather too late then, I know, especially if
the unhappy dog is mad; and I admit that
such of us as can't keep our teeth to them-
selves ought to be muzzled—so, by the way,

placable hostility to our race seems excited by what our enemy calls
the bare idea of that dreadful thing, hydrophobia.’...From this peculiar
sort of phraseology, and from its having been so liberally underlined,
I conclude that the writer of the letter is a female, and I believe I know
who she is. She says that she and her famil

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE TWELFTH.
MRS. MOUSER ON THE SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF LADIES AFTER DINNER.
THE ABUSE AND THE REMEDY.
ONTEMPLATING so-
ciety, MR. PUNCH
Twhich, as aunt
PEAcock used to
, say, she considered
to be very like a

made by a needle-
woman, without a
proper eye for
matching of co-
lours, the reds, and
the blues, and the
yellows, are so
mixed up with
and kill the quiet
patterns,—in con-
templating, I say,
society, there is
- nothing that has
struck me with a stronger blow than the English habit—(for in France,
I'm told, they know how to behave themselves towards women)—than
the custom of banishing the ladies to the drawing-room, in a very few
minutes after dinner; as if whatever was talked of after they were gone,
was of too high and lofty a kind—“too philosophic, and embracing
subjects too asthmatic,” as MouseR once said to me, when, by the
way, he could hardly speak ten words—“for the limited range of the
female brain.” And so, while the Lords of the Creation are talking of
the stars, and the tides, geography, Mahometanism—for this is what
MousPR says—natural history, and the like, women are to be sent away
with the children, with nothing to do but to talk to themselves in the
drawing-room.
Not that they always will talk. It was only last week that MouseR
and I dined with the CRAwFORDs—fine people; amiable people, with
the best, show of plate of any of our acquaintance. Well, the dinner
went off beautifully—I never enjoyed myself more out in my life. The
ty, too, was so genteel! We had the cousin of the gallant CAPTAIN
UNGLE, who has so distinguished himself in India; the own brother of
the new Bishop of Heligoland; and a whole host, as MouseR calls 'em,
of notorieties; besides Mr.Srint, the travellerºsuch agiewer creaturi
—who's been round the globe, with nothing but a tooth-brush, a
note-book, and a complete suit of striped cotton. Such a dear, rattling
fellow !. jià so make us laugh with his account of a suttee, when the
widow insisted upon being burnt, and—the stupid creature! it served
her quite right to let her have her own way—and when it was all over,
how he, MR. SPIRT, said it looked like a GUY FAUx bonfire, without
the *. The brother of the Bishop of Heligoland was, to be sure,
very high upon the matter. “That young man”—said the Bishop's
brother to myself— that young man Iowers everything; he would trace
the source of the Nile to his own ink-bottle, and let down the Garden
of Eden to an apple-stall.” I couldn't but agree with the Bishop's
brother; nevertheless, I thought MR. SPIRT one of the most pleasant
creatures that ever lived ' Much more funny, indeed, than the Bishop's
brotherſ -
But don't let me º what I began with ; which is the savage
custom of sending away ladies from the dinner-table. For we were all
so pleasant at the CRAwroRDs’; the gentlemen delightful, and, I must
say it, the ladies, bearing their part—some of 'em, perhaps, over-actin
it a little—bearing their part delightfully. All as full of smiles an
sweetness—as the Bishop's brother whispered to me—as a rose-garden.
Well, the horrid minute came ; MRs. CRAwroRD swept her eyes round
the table, looking us off our chairs; and the Bishop's brother, running
to the door to open it, asked “if they must lose us so soon P’—and let
us out.
We all left running over with smiles, and rustled our way up stairs.
Upon my word, Mr. Punch, when we got into the drawing-room, and
took our seats, I do think that not a soul we’d left would have known
us again!. Even CRAwfoºp might have stared at his own wife; and
for myself—I confess it—I felt the change. There wasn't a lady of the
§. for MRs. CRAwford she looked on a sudden frost-bit, from
head to toe—not a woman that didn't seem as she’d been suddenly
iced in her muslin and satin. To have seen us smiling and sparkling
as we went out of the dining-room; and again to have seen us as we
glumped—(I don't know whether, there, is such a word; but if there
isn't there ought to be)—as we glumped in the drawing-room, nobod
would have #"; us the same delightful creatures. As I say—as
confess myself—I found the difference. I could have talked for ever
down stairs, and on a sudden, directly Istepped into the drawing-room, I
felt in a hard frost.
Well, we all dropped somewhere; all silent and some savage. Some
got to Albums, and Books, and so forth. But what’s Books of Beaut
to us women (unless, indeed, one’s own picture happens to be in 'em)
I never saw a book of the sort I’d give a pin for. And so, after we’d
rustled and rumpled the leaves, and that for the most part in the most
horrid silence that I ever knew—except now and then there was such
a shout of laughter down-stairs that made one's blood boil again, and I
could see MRs. CRAwroRD felt so, though she did try to smile, and said
more than once—“The gentlemen seem to do very well withoutus—it’s
pleasant to think we’re so soon forgot,”—after sitting mum-chance for
about an hour, MRs. CRAwford, in a desperate moment, as I_verily
believe, to do something, asked that dreadful Miss Peony—and Inever
meet that girl—girl! she’s four-and-thirty at least, anywhere, that I
don’t seem to smell the paint)—asked her to sing a song, and º blood
went colder at the words. In a moment, and before she was we §
Miss PEoNY was down at the piano, with her hands out for mischief.
Of course we had that horrid º 'll never own my love / no-no
—no /*—with that dreadful jingling of the no—no—no, like the rattling
of a bunch of keys.
Now, I put it to you, Mr. Punch, as a person knowing human nature,
and woman's nature to boot, -what pleasure, what interest is there,
what curiosity, I should like to know, can there be in eight or ten
ladies being made to listen to one of their own sex—(and four-and-thirty
as I said, at least,) screaming to a piano that she won't own a love, that
it's very well known she never had, and if she had, that she might
advertise it in the Morning Post, and nobody care a button about it?
But this is one of the miseries that is brought upon women by their
being packedoff—banished into exile—as M as HARRottie yery †† y
observed, whilst men are “passing the port,” as they call it, and talking
their own philosophy, and giving their own.views of life, as MoUSER
says, in the dining-room. Now, it’s a Yºlº thing when a lady
sings a love-song in a mixed company. “That,”—as MRs. HARBOTTLE
said to me—“that is a º relation which communicates with the
latent sympathies of people; and everybody—or at least .# other
body—takes an interest in it upon their own account,”—which I thought
very deeply, and very beautifully said. And MRs. HARBOTTLE was going
on, when there was another shout in the room below that, upon my
word, almost shook us off our chairs again. ...
Whereupon MRs. CRAwFoRD, with a cutting smile observed—“the
gentlemen seem enjoying their philosophy.” And then she made an
angry snatch at the bell, and I couldn't wonder at it—for we’d been
waiting an hour—and said to the servant when he came—“RoBERT,
É. my compliments, mind, my compliments to your master, and
im if the ladies may hope to see him before they go home.” Robert
left the room; and MRs. CRAwFoRD smiled at all of us, and of course
we smiled again, supporting her.
“Hush,” said MRs. CRAwFoRD, and we listened. The man delivered
his message ; there could be no doubt of that ; and CRAWFORD-as
Mouser confessed to me-delivered it to the company afterwards; for
there was another shout of laughter that, as MRs. HARBOTTLE declared,
and as I myself felt, was positively an insult! A defying insult!
It was another hour—another hour by the time-piece—that we, poor
women, were left alone to our own resources, and you may jº,
Mr. Punch, how dull we were, before the gentlemen joined us. ny
we were two hours—two hours wrecked, as MRs. HARBOTTLE prettily
expressed herself-wrecked upon the squabs and sofas of MRs. CRAw-
Ford's drawing-room.
And now, Mr. Punch, let me suggest a remedy for this. A remedy
that shall make men in their own defence, either insist upon our re-
maining at the table till they rise themselves—or that shall make them,
like needles to the pole, immediately come after us up stairs. My
remedy is this:— -
Gentlemen “take ladies down.” I propose that ladies should “take
gentlemen "#. and in this way.
Let it be the business of every lady taken down by a gentleman to
make herself acquainted with his faults; faults of looks; faults of
manner; faults of every sort that can be seen in him or made for him.
Then, when the ladies are sent away by themselves, let them put
together all they’ve thought of 'gainst the gentlemen who took 'em
ºn-and throwing the collection in a common stock, make the most
OI ll.
I’ll be bound, Mr. Punch, that if this was done, we women should
H. the time in the drawing-room a little more pleasantly than we’re
o
om'd to now-sitting, almost saying nothing—with the further aggra-
vation of laughter down stairs. -
When the gentlemen felt that all their faults were being talked about,
and made more of; when they felt that every lady taken down, had in
return, taken a gentleman up, when, in a word, all the gentlemen felt
certain that there was nothing beside going on, but that they were being
picked to bits in the drawing-room, wouldn't they in a minute, come
up stairs; if only to look after the pieces?
Yours, truly,
The Honeysuckles. AMELLA MoUSER.

LEGAL CHANGES.
THE new a ents in the higher departments of Westminster
Hall, will materially affect the position of several other members of the
Bar, whose names have not been mentioned in connection with the
more important changes. . The very proper elevation of SIR John
JERVIs to the Bench, will leave a vacancy for another Queen's Counsel
in the first row, and thus an opening will be afforded to MR. BRIEFLEss
which will materially alter his views; for, by the gap that will be left,
he will be able to see his way to the Bench, which, as long as another
learned gentleman sat immediately before him, was quite impossible.
The other changes consequent on the alteration with regard to the
Great Seal, will place the small wafers at the disposal of MR. DUNUP, for
he will now be able to sit nearer the centre of the back row, where the
little wafer-box—for the general use of Junior Counsel—will be directly
under his fingers.
It is rumoured throughout Westminster Hall that both our learned
friends, MR. BRIEFLEss and MR. DUNUP, are looking forward with the
sanguine hope of eventually attaining to the high office of “Keeper,”
and that they are endeavouring to qualify for the post by the most
emergetic efforts to “keep” themselves.
MR. DUNUP has, it is stated, made some inquiries preliminary to an
application for the coif, which cannot be assumed without an expense of
several hundred pounds. The learned gentleman, it is believed, will
propose to take the coif by instalments of fifty pounds per term; and
if his proposition is acceded to, he will give rings with the motto,
“Westigia nulla retrorsum,” or, in other words, “What’s done, or who-
ever is done, it can't be undone.”

STANDING FOR A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT.
IT seems that there are only
seats for three hundred mem-
bers in the New House of
Commons, whereas six hun-
dred at least are required.
This deficiency of accommo-
dation, however, can easily
be overcome. We are always
enjoined to rise with every
#. so we propose that
Baby Jumpers be provided for
those who have no seats; and
if that is not rising with a
difficulty, we do not know
what is
Whenever a member (the
Member for Ayr, suppose we
say) wanted to “occupy the
floor” of the House, the
Serjeant-at-Arms would take
him off the hooks, and hook
him up again as soon as he
had finished. A new appoint-
ment would have to be made
—“The Silver Hook in Waiting.” We hardly know how the members
sitting underneath would like this new arrangement. For instance,
we cannot imagine it would be very pleasant to the feelings of Lond
John, when he was making a long speech, to know that. DISRAELI
Was º his head, ready, the moment he had finished, to
“drop into him.”
But then, again, the plan would be attended with certain conve-
niences; for how easy it would be for LoRD JoHN, if he felt DISRAELI
(or UPPER BENJAMIN, as he must be called after his new elevation) had
taken the unfair advantage of him, to rise, as soon as he had resumed
his seat in his Baby Jumper, and gently “pull him down,” so saving
himself and the House the fatigue of another long speech.
We hope to hear of an early sitting being appointed to try, in a full
house, this experiment of the Baby Jumpers; if three hundred are run
up, we should say it would be sufficient.
CANNLBALISM IN THE ARMY.
.WE have heard occasionally of awful scenes on board ship when pro-
visions ran short, but really, we can, find
things dimly shadowed forth in the following advertisement which lately
appeared in the Times newspaper:—
“Messman wanted for a Cavalry Regiment quartered in England. He must be a
person without encumbrance, who cooks HIMsRLF?"
We ask the reader, is there not something frightful in the very idea
of a man cooking himself, and does it not suggest the still more awful
uestion—when he has cooked himself who is to eat him? Humanity
shudders, the blood turns to curd in the middle of its way, the heart
takes a º leap into the mouth, and the brain commences a
reel at the bare supposition of a messman “cooking himself,” and the
stipulation that he must be without encumbrance adds to the horror of
the suggestion, for it shows that an act is contemplated, which might
leave a wife and family desolate.
... We know that the epicure, or rather the gourmand, will, by excessive
indulgence so vitiate his taste and destroy his
extraordinary will be required to rouse his deadened powers of enjoying
food of the customary kind; but this advertisement for a “messman
who cooks himself,” is an outrage, not only on the best, but on the
second best (and we might even add the every-day suit for common
wear), feelings of our nature. We wonder that the advertisement did
not add an intimation that “the messman must be in quarters a week
before he begins to cook himself.”
It is to be hoped that the War Office will inquire into the circum-
stances of this case, for the “Cavalry Regiment” has something dread-
ully wrong in either its humanity or its grammar. Wherever the fault
lies it ought to be corrected.

THE REPUBLIC POUR RIRE.
If it is true that “nothing kills like ridicule,” the French Republic
must, by this time, be virtually dead, for although the upsetting of
dynasties, thrones, and constitutions must generally, be re j aS
“no joke,” there never was anything more universally laughed at, both
at home and abroad, than La blique Française. It is burlesqued Oll
the stage, squibbed in the press, caricatured in the shops, and quizzed
everywhere. For some time there was a show of outward respect for
it within the doors of the Assembly, but now the Republic has become
one of the standing jokes of those men who are entrusted with -
its laws and carrying on its government. A few days ago, the Member
of Justice termed the whole concern a “catastrophe,” amid the applause
of all but a few, who, when they attempted to windicate the dignity of
the Republic, were met with shouts of laughter, as if the idea of there
being anything respectable or agreeable in the new order of things,
was one of the wildest vagaries that an ill-regulated brain could have
wandered into.
.The Assembly was, in fact, thrown into a state of contemptuous
hilarity by every effort at expostulation against the word “catastrophe.”
having been applied to the revolution, and when an insignificant little
knot of avowed Republicans threatened to resign, the guffaws, were
loud and general. only wonder now is, how long the French will
put up with a system that one and all repudiate. A joke's a joke, but
no farce ought to be allowed to last too long, id if, therefore, the
French mean to have a form of goverment intended for other purposes
than to be jeered at in every possible mamer, the sooner they set about
it the betterit will be for their interest, as well as for their dignity.
THE CONWICT'S GASTRONOMIC REGENERATOR.
HERE is something quite gratifying to see what
advances humanity and civilisation are making in
prison-discipline. . The Hampshire Independent
contains the subjoined interesting statements:–
“By the conditions attached to the contracts for supplying
provisions, &c., for the use of the convicts on board the hulks
at Portsmouth, we perceive that the provisions are required
to be of a much superior character to those which two-thirds
of the population of these towns are able to procure—they are,
indeed, required to be of the very best qualities it is possible
for even a tradesman or a man of affluence to procure for
himself. The beef must be “good ox or heifer, sound, sweet,
and fresh (bull, cow, or stag, will not be received), in fore and
hind quarters alternately.' . . . The mutton, too, must be
“the best wether mutton, to be supplied in equal proportions
of fore and hind quarters;” and the bread be “the best wheaten.'”
Our Southampton contemporary grumbles a little-not, perhaps, with-
out some show of reason—at rogues and thieves being supplied with
better food than honest hard-working men can earn; and remarks how
hard the dockyard labourer, in particular, must think it. that the con-
Vici in the his fare better than himself. This is a slight anomaly,
no doubt; but the philosophy of criminal reformation obliges us not to
mind it. It has been established by scientific research, that all
maliciousness, ferocity, dishonesty, scroundrelism, rascality, and the
like weaknesses of character, are “vices of the blood,” to use a
SHARspEARIAN term; or arise from “bad blood,” as we say commonly:
Hence the reformatory process must commence with the purification of
that fluid, whose vicious condition is the primary cause of crime. The
mind depends on the body; the body is continually undergoing a process
of waste and repair; change a rogue's diet for the better for a sufficient
length of time, and you renovate the whole man. Indeed, something
more recherché than plain, wholesome, bread and meat should be the
dietary of gaols, to produce a thorough refinement of their inmates:
M. SoYER ought to be employed to invent a system of prison cºokery,
adapted to the criminal º There ought to be baruf à la Penton-
ville; cºſtelettes à la Milbank; soupe au lait a la Parkhurst. Newgate
should have its hors d'oeuvres; the Compter its entrenets. The care
should include pâtés de foie gras a la Coldbath Fields, and rol-au-cent à la
Horsemonger Lane. he connection between crime and the use of
intoxicating liquors being notorious, the beverages of the prisoners
should be limited to light French or Rhine wines, with now and then,
perhaps, a glass or so of old dry port. -
To complete this plan of correction by kindness, the convicts should
be employed in light elegant task-work, alternating with amusements.
The female culprits should be occupied with crochet instead of oakum-
picking; the men employed in .# documents, or making drawings:
the intervals of labour being occupied by light reading, or by singing in
classes, superintended by competent persons recommended by MR.
HULLAH. Walking exercise should be taken every morning on the
prison lawn; and about twice a week the day should conclude with an
evening party, at which the gentlemen and ladies of the neighbourhoºd
might ‘. invited to assist: and in order to the due observance of the
proprieties of the Polka, a slight addition should be made to the County
rate, in order to provide the convicts with white kid gloves.

THE GREAT CLOCK CASE AGAIN.
EveRY one will, admit, that however Heroes or Statesmen, may
illustrate the age in which they live, we must trust to the clocks
to mark the present time. For this reason we must censure the
neglect that is shown towards the clocks of our own day,+a class
containing some frightful instances of irregularity, and giving evidence
of hours untold, of works unprofitable, and of idle hands. We have been
in the habit of blaming the clocks themselves for these erratic ways
but we have now too much reason to believe that they have suffere
from other bad hands besides their own, and that they have been fre-
uently the victims of a system over which they have had no control.
he following extracts from a newspaper of recent date, will at all
events vindicate all the barrack clocks in the kingdom from the charge
of irregularity, and will explain how it is that there are so. many
military dials without a civil tongue to tell us the time:—
“GoverNMENT RETRENCHMENT.-Among other Government “savings, an order has
been issued to the various barracks to stop all separate allowances for winding up the
clocks. In consequence, this duty at the Fulwood Barracks will hereafter be trans-
ferred from MR. SIMPsox, clockmaker, to the barrack-master.
The saving is about
£6 a-year.”
When the goings on or stoppings still of a clock are dependent upon
new and untried arrangements for somebody or other to wind it up, we
cannot be surprised that its proceedings are as uncertain as the wind.
As military time is always ten minutes in advance of any other, a
barrack-master who has the charge of a clock will naturally be for ever
crying, “forwards,” but “right face” will never be a direction appli-
cable to a clock whose face is never right but always wrong. e

look for in a watchmaker, and when a military hand performs the

“Down with your dust! ” is the appeal of the Commissioners of the

the London public, resorting for air and exercise to Hyde Park, when
the multitude with which it will be crowded shall have worn its turf
away, and pulverised its soil. By-the-bye, why should the turf of Hyde
†. be wasted? As it must inevitably be walked off why not cut it,
and sell it, and let the proceeds go in aid of the fxhibition, which, we
fear, is not supported with the liberality a project so laudable in itself
deserves, owing, no doubt, to the obstinate disregard of public opinion
shown by its promoters in their determination to inflict this preposterous
building on the Park.

THE DRAMA IN CHANCERY.
AST Friday, there appeared in the
papers a report of the º, in
one of the Equity Courts, which
would really have made an admirable
scene in a farce or comedy of the old
school, where a testy guardian in a
º Court suit, a coachman's wig, and a
gold-headed bludgeon, is refusing the
request of a romping young ward
in a pink sash, a white muslin frock,
and a luxuriant head of corkscrew
curls, for which she is indebted some-
what to Nature, and six-and-sixpence
to the barber. The Court of Chancery,
as everybody knows, has a .
of wards over whom it does not always exercise immediate perso
control. But the scene to which we have alluded would, seem to...show
that Equity is resolved to play the “cross old guardy” to the life, on
all future occasions. -
An application was made to one of the Vice-Chancellors to allow a
o º ward in Chancery—to go to Boulogne ºf the summer,
utthe guardian would not accede to the proposal, from the lips of counsel,
and decidedly refused the application, ; saying, rather testily, there were
a great many wards wanting to É. to, Boulogne this season. º
the cautious guardian is afraid that the rush of wards will send up the
price of apartments at Boulogne, and thus the refusal may proceed from
motives of economy; but, at all events, we dare say there were very
good reasons for the determination come to by the Vice-Chancellor.
We are only afraid that if the part of guardian is played so resolutely
upon the Bench, we shall be seeing a parcel of skittish young ladies
tripping into the Courts, of Changery, and º. to wheedle
their “cross old guardy,” by chucking one of their Lordships, or their
Honours, º º, the chin, and entreating him in the usual
farce phraseology, to be “a d guardy pardy, and let his little
wardy pawdy go in the little boaty poaty, over to º pancey.” .
Though their Lordships and their Honours may be able peremptorily
and bluntly to resist the formal applications of MR. HUMDRUM, Q.C.,
or MEssRs. BLUNDER, THUNDER, or, DUNDER, of the outer bar, we are
afraid that, should any of the young ladies themselves appear in propriá
persond to urge their own suits, we may occasionally hear an undignified
“Whew 1, you insinuating little gage,” chuckled from the Bench,
. by an intimation, that “the coaxing little hussey must have
an order as prayed.”
STRANGE LIKENESS BETWEEN THE OLD BAILEY AND
THE OPERA.
A CoRREsponDENT of the Times complains that he was refused ad-
mission to the Old Bailey, because he would not pay one shilling at the
doors. The figure of Justice is generally represented with a pair of
scales in its hand. At the Old Bailey these scales must be for the
purpose of weighing the money, to see whether, it is light, or of the
proper legal weight; or perhaps they may be used to regulate the scale
of admission. fact, a strange likeness may be traced between the
Old Bailey and the Opera in more features than one. For instance,
when there is some very great attraction, Fashion and the Nobility
resort there, with their kid gloves, and Opera glasses, to watch the
performances, and a seat in the gallery rises in value in the same pro-
Fº as a stall at Her Majsty's Theatre on a JENNY, IIND night.
ike the Opera, too, it has no half-price, and no play-bills, and the
doorkeepers have the same º of turning back any one whose
costume they object to. By-the-bye, a series of “Long Thursdays” at
the Qld Bailey would prove, we think, very attractive, providing the
first legal talent was engaged, and the Judges could promise a constant
succession of novelties.
A west-end agent, also, should be appointed, as many a gentleman
and lady, upon going to MITCHELL's or SAM’s to inquire “what was
ing on this evening * 'would give the preference to the Old Bailey, if
they could be certain of a good seat. Who would care for a crowd at
the Royal Italian Opera when they could be sure of a Rush at the
Central Criminal Court, -or admire WIARDoT GARCIA, when they could
go into extacies for less, money over some crazy PATE, who had been
taken up for assaulting the QUEEN ? We are confident there is a fine
fortune to be made at the Old Bailey, if the scales are only taken out
of the custody of Justice, and put into the hands of some “enterprising
lessee.” At present a shilling is much too low, for really it is putting
the first Criminal Court in the Kingdom on a level with the Chamber
of Horrors at MADAME Tussaud's. It should be raised to a guinea at
least, and season tickets should also be issued, for which there could be
no difficulty, in obtaining forty guineas a piece. The taste for the
horrible kind of amusement is so strong in the British public, that,
with good management and a little puffing, the Old Bailey might take
the lead of all the operas, theatres, and Grecian Saloons about town.
IT IS ALL A MATTER OF CONJECTURE.
THE Observer writes biographies in a peculiar manner. It is all done
on conjecture. For instance, on Sunday, June 30, it pretended to write
the life of an unhappy ruffian, and started off with the eccentric intima.
tion that it had nothing to tell. It candidly informed us that “its
information was too scanty to base any views º excepting those of
mere conjecture.” You would imagine, after this, that it would have
had, the discretion to have held its tongue. Not at all; it went on
talking for half a column; indulged in a tissue of fanciful facts; told
us, in a fine, metaphorical style, a number of incidents that might have
happened, but none of which did happen; and wound up by warning us,
that “this was necessarily all hypothesis, and conjecture.” . This is
doubtlessly very amusing, but we hardly think it fair, or charitable, to
the person who is in prison awaiting his sentence. - -
Supposing we were to write the character of the Observer, in a similar
style? Supposing we were to say as follows:—
“We know nothing whatever of the Observer, but as we are e to say some-
thing about it, we do not mindsaying what we have been told, but at the same time must
beg our readers to take it only as hearsay, and not as strict matter of fact. The Observer
then, is a paper full of bad grammar, and worse taste, and still worse circulation, and is
the recognised organ of all the fashionable areas. A Lady's maid in May Fair writes its
Fashionable Intelligence, and it derives its government information from the servant who
has the emptying-out of Lond John's waste-paper-basket, and it pays the box-keepers of
the different theatres so much a line for the }. articles they send upon the new
pieces produced. It is distinguished for its impartial biographies of all celebrated
criminals, which are written generally after supper by the united corps of contributors
as they are assembled round a table, smoking and enjoying themselves. Each con-
tributor gives, in turn, a fact—either a birth, or an early trait of cruelty, or a marria
or an unequivocal symptom of insanity, and the whole of it is taken down in writing
the waiter who is in the room. When all the paper is in type, the Proprietor tucks up his
shirt-sleeves and proceeds to the engine-room, where, smoking a cigar, he strikes off at
his leisure the weekly impression of 50, and, taking it under his arm, drops the copies
down the respective areas on his way home. We remind our readers that they must
not take these facts as literally true. We tell them we know nothing' whatever of the
Observer, either good or bad. It may be the best paper in the world, for what we know
or care, but as it was expected we should say something about the Observer, and that
that something should be bad, we have compounded the above little curious history
respecting its management, which we entreat our readers to read, with implicit faith,
but at the same time to recollect that it is ‘necessarily all hypothesis and conjecture.'"
We do not, think the above would be liberal, manly, charitable, or
kind, to our talented contemporary, not even supposing it were in priso
awaiting in the greatest suspense the trial on which the very life an
proceeds of the Journal depended. We do hope the Observer will try
its clever, conjectural pen on some other amusement, less dangerous
than that of Criminal Biography.
LOUD CRIES OF “NAME! NAME! NAME!”
A LAw has been passed in the Chamber of Deputies, that all articles
which appear in a French newspaper must, for the future, be signed
with the names of their respective authors. On the part of the English
press, we can only state that we shall be too happy to conform to the
same regulation. The British Public would then have an opportunity
of being astonished at the tremendous list of our contributors. Not a
person of any talent in the United Kingdom, but who has been too
roud to have his cleverness immortalised in our pages!
§. of every profession, from WIDDICOMB down to the DUKE OF
The highest
ELLINGTON, have emulated one another in sending their best things
to Punch, and many a bon not has been repeated from our collection, at
the royal table, whilst the illustrious author was present. In proof of
our honesty, we append, to this present article the name of the
writer, and, though it is the most modest of our rich collection, still
it may be taken as a ... of the veins of sterling metal
that run like so many undiscovered streams of Californian gold,
through our columns. The name in question is, we are proud to confess,
no other than,

caused a yelling, and with it sulphurousemanations, better con-
ceived by the º of an AshLEY, than described even by the

THE FASHIONABLE ORGANS.
ATTERLY two of our morning contem-
oraries have been engaged in an
ignoble competition for the doubtful
honour—and possible profit-at-
tached to the position of the fashion-
able organ, whose practice it is to
perform the task—and pocket the
contingent cash—of chronicling not
exactly the “small beer,” but the
dancing teas, &c., &c., of those
whose ambition it is to get classed
—at the rate of a guinea a pa.
ph—among the votaries of
1011.
We really blush for our brethren
of the press when we witness, the
Y paltry style of literature to which
/ the two journals addict themselves,
for the mere sake of the few shil-
lings that are to be picked up by
announcing the postponement of
LADY Mush Room's inee, or
MRs. SMITHIE SMYTHE SMITH's intended fºte in her grounds—six
yards wide, by twenty-three feet long—at Pimlico. . .
We shall really be delighted when the season is fairly over, that we
may be spared the nausea of reading the weekly list of “Fashionable
arrangements” and “Further arrangements” in the columns of the
namby-pamby newspapers. Who cares to know that “IADYTIMKINson
threw open her salons to about 150” male and female nobodies, among
whom the penny-a-liner has. “particularly, noticed”—because he
been paid for º noticing—a small bundle of fifth-rate outsiders
of the world of rank or fashion?
What matters it to us, or to the world, that the BARONESS DE
BoMBAsFEN has “postponed her déjeiner”—or whether she turns
her déjeiner into a dinner, or whether she ever gets any breakfast at
all, or whether she rushes into a la of bread and cheese and
teisu
onions, or, in fact, who cares what the old woman either does or refrains
from doing *
In this practical of common sense, we think it would be much
wiser for the idle and useless classes decently to keep their mode of
passing their lives out of the notice of the world at , which is be-
inning to estimate people, by the worth of what they do, and not by
the means they possess of doing nothing.
THE GREAT OWERWORKED.
WE must positively issue a commission of our own to inquire into the
condition of the working classes. Notwithstanding all the recent inves-
igation into this subject, it appears that *::: the sons of Toil thereis
a body of white slaves—if we should not rather say white and black
slaves—whose existence heretofore has been quite cted. In the
late discussion on the Ecclesiastical Commission Bill, MR. GIAPSTONE
made the following remarkable assertion in reference to an individual of
this class:–
“He ventured to say that the Brshop of London worked twice as hard as any
working clergyman in the diocese.”
The perspiration of the mitred brow, then, is a great deal more copious
than most pº are aware of . An opinion prevails that the principal
employment of a bishop is comprised in ordaining, co ing, consecra-
ting churches; making visitations of the nature of angels' visits;
º when he has nothing, else to do; and writing works on
inity during leisure hours. ese occupations are spread over so
much time, that they cannot be veryonerous; and an occasional evening's
attendance in the House of Lords during the session, can add no very
back-breaking weight to them. How is it then that a prelate is so
monstrously overworked P. Nay, we must and will send an emissary to
Lambeth and Fulham to ferret all this out.
We have a dark suspicion that the spiritual meditations—if not
duties—of the right reverend Bench, are rather interfered with by
business relative to wills and ecclesiastical property; so that a bishop
has to do his own work, and a lawyer's, and estate-agent's, too. If this
is the case, perhaps Lord ASHLEY will bring in a Ten Hours Bill to
abridge episcopal labour; or, as that plan may not be very practicable,
º: the PREMIER will emancipate the prelates altogether
from their secular serfdom. Something must be done to cure the
headache, which, if MR. GLADSTONE is right, is enclosed in the mitre.
It is strange, however, that a Lord Spiritual can generally find time to
marry members of the nobility who are above being united by a
“working clergyman.” Nevertheless, if the work of the British hio,
is proportionate to his pay, it certainly is something enormous.

ExHIBITING
“OLD 'ARD BILL! HERE's ANOTHER HIPPERPo'TAMUs.” .
LORD BROUGHAM'S WISIT TO AMERICA.
At the last meeting of the Society for Promoting the Amendment of
the Law, held very appropriately in Chancery Lane, LoRD BROUGHAM
announced his intention of proceeding to America.
“WHITHER HE HAD BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO CONFER witH HIS
BRETHREN THERE RESPECTING THE AMENDMENT OF THE LAw.”
Directly this intelligence met our eyes, we called for a best sheet of
elephant paper, nibbed our peacock pen—used only upon rare and
eventful occasions—and dipping it in our perfumed ink, º:
sented to us by the Duchess of “”, who with a whole bottle
of attar of roses had scented the fluid—we immediately indited a
Letter of Introduction to GENERAL TAYLOR, the American President,
and forthwith sent the epistle to dear LoRD BROUGHAM. Well, to our
astonishment and somewhat to our annoyance, we find that garbled
copies of the epistle are at this moment circulating throughout society
—indeed, we know not to what amount of floating letter. Hence, we
complain—as, indeed, a distinguished and º good-tempered
young nobleman of irreproachable Manners had, recently, cause to com-
plain of the publicity of his Poems, before published; and—following
that poet's noble example—we are resolved to print the complete Letter
for the satisfaction of ourselves, of BRough AM, and of TAYLOR. To be
sure, we understand that LORD BROUGHAM himself made a point of
reading our missive of introduction to every party he visited; but such
confidence on the part of the noble, learned, and ingenuous Lord, does
in no manner justify its publication by any of its hearers, or eaves.
droppers. However, we will not lose our temper; we will not pelt
eople as penny-a-liners and so forth; but, in our calm sense of injured
ignity—print the letter.
“To GENERAL TAYLOR, President of the United States, Favoured by
HENRY LORD BRough AM, Member of the French Institute.
“DEAR TAYLOR, - - -
“I HAVE much pleasure in making yourself and my friend
BROUGHAM—the BRough AM, whose fame is not European, but world-
wide, personally acquainted. With all his little drolleries, he is an
excellent fellow; and with all his oddities, he has worked like a Her-
culean stable-boy at our Augean, Courts of Law. He has cheapened
costs; he has well-nigh destroyed the race of sharp attornies—(the more
Hebrew, by the way, the more sharp), for the jew is still pastoral, and
flourishes on sheep-skin. Indeed, if you would seek BRQUGHAM's
uonument, look around every attorney's office; and you will not see
BROUGHAM's picture. You will, see the Draconian ELLENBoRough-
you will behold, in ebon frame, the Doubling ELDON,+but you will not
see the Čost Controlling BRqugh AM . His picture, like the effigies of
old, is the more lustrous as it is not shown
BROUGHAM to a fraternally legal conference. I am glad of it. Like
invitations have been sent him from the lawyers of the Sandwich
Caribbees. But BROUGHAM, 1 that your necessities, as a people,
are greater than either Sandwich Islander or Carib, pays you the t
visit. He comes, with an amendment of that American law that lays
violent hands upon every, free black—locking him up in gaol, like a
pest-tainted bale of goods, lest the plague of negro liberty should spread
all over the Union. He comes to prove to you that your Declaration of
Independence, in which you set out that all men are born free, whilst
among you negro man is bought and sold like a beast, is no other than
a Declaration of Impudence; a blasphemy uttered to the Maker of
man, and an affront to the common sense of all mankind (American-
kind, perhaps, not included).
“And now, dear TAYLOR, that little burst got rid of—for it would
break out, I couldn't button it within my waistcoat—let us have a little
pleasant gossip. - -
“You will, I know—for Jonathan is aboundingly ºt. with a
heart as flowing and free as his Mississippi—you will, I know, give a
may save us, a future war—we will not lose our BROUGHAM.. I
know HENRY's ardent, impulsive temperament. You will be giving
him a public banquet; and there and then, after a i. description
of the mighty energies of your mighty country—after claiming Orl
brotherhood with all of you, -he insist—(and I know the force, the
subtlety of his eloquence too well, not to be aware that it will cause
you a struggle—a very severe struggle to refuse the favour)—he will
insist upon being immediately made an American Citizen. But for the
obstinacy”) of M. CREMIEUx, our BROUGHAM would, at this moment,
have been a French Citizen! In danger, it may be, of the next
Presidency; and—by the *H. #ou naturalise him, I wouldn't
give yourself much chance of a re-election. You will therefore be on
your guard. Our HENRY must return to us: his genius is the property
of the Human race—but his citizenship is with England. Take any

“How you will enjoy BROUGHAM after dinner; whilst the American
women in the drawing-room will hang upon him, bright and thick, as

a greater fatness of humour-no man sings a song like hi
way, when he is in full force of spirits, do—now, pray, don't miss this—
do ask him to sing The Three Little Pigs / You will never forget it:
from that moment, The Three Little Pigs will become dear as your
national eagle. Moreover, set some of the women on him—if, which is
not at all unlikely, he do not volunteer it—to do the conjuring trick of

A BIT of MY MIND.
BIT THE THIRTEENTH.
MRS. MOUSER APPLIES FOR A PASSPORT TO JOIN MOUSER IN FRANCE,
AND was NEVER “so INSULTED BEFORE.”
. MR PUNCH,-As the time is come and past when the Prime Minister
in the House of Commons has drowned what MoUSER calls the blind
kittens of the Session—by which, I suppose, MoUser means the Bills
that arm’t to see the light this present year, as then, I say, LoRD
JQHN has F. his customary kittens into the pail, and what is called the
wisdom of the country is about to separate—crumble to bits—like a
plum-pudding that's over-rich,-you will allow me to call the attention
of my sisters of England to a scandal and abuse at which LoRD
PALMERSTON (as I believe is his name) is at the bottom, as he is the
Foreign Office head; an abuse that strikes at the root of private families
(if I’m not using too strong language)—and violates the dearest secrecy
of domestic life, HI mean a lady's age.
Yes, I must ask, what is LoRD PALMERSTON.—(if that is his name),
what is he about, that he should suffer an Englishwoman, that pays taxes
through her husband, to be insulted by the rudest, and I will say it,
the most unprovoked and unmanly question that can be put to any
gentlewoman,—need I say, a question that goes to inquire º age?
But, #. Funch, you shall hear, and through you all the women of
all01.
..MR. MoUSER is at this moment abroad. A fortnight ago I made up
his portmanteau, and let him go alone; for, as I said, how could we
both go, and leave the painters in the house? So he went, of course,
and left me to be poisoned, as I might, which I shall not go into at
resent, but come to the affront I’ve suffered; the worst affront that can
ut º a woman; I mean, of course, the insult put upon her age.
ell, MoUSER, as Tsay, being gone—and the painters at last bein
dome-f got my things together to follow him. My boxes (and if
pride myself upon anything, it is, that I never travel with more than
six i. two bonnet boxes and one bag, and a moderate basket, even
if I leave home for a month)-my boxes being almost ready, I went
to get ". passport; for MouseR, wrote to me that they wouldn't jet
me join him on a foreign soil without; though he never so much as
breathed the insult which, as his wife, he must have known would have
been put upon me, when left by myself.
However, what I write I write as a warning for the wives of England,
that, if they dotravel, they may takecare and goabroadwith their husbands,

never so much, as MoUser says, moved a muscle. I’d heard, so much
of French politeness; and did expect such a_sample of it at the
French Ambassador's, that I must confess it, I felt for the moment
quite staggered; whereupon, for my presence of mind never forsakes
me—and presence of mind to a female, as dear aunt PEAcock used to
say, is worth a pistol at full-cock—whereupon, didn't I draw myself up?
I should think I did -
There Istood, and the Ambassador never so much as flew for a chair;
but if he didn't look at me, and while with one hand he twiddled a pe
and with his other fingers coaxed a ferret-coloured moustachio, an
ulled a few hairs at the end of his chin, as if they were a bell-rope, and
#. could get ’em all the lower by pulling.’em—well, if whilst amusing
himself in this manner, and never speaking a word, he didn’t actually
begin to whistle!— - - -
§ you may believe that my blood rose, and I did begin to wish
myself a man. However, as, I never forget myself, that is, before
strangers, and out of my own house—for with one's own husband, and
under one's own roof, it’s quite a different thing, as I’m always cool
out, I smiled what I felt to be an icy smile, saying to myself, “ IS
the French Ambassador; but let’s see how it will end.” . . - ---
There I stood; and the Ambassador, going on with his whistling,
stared at me from head to foot. Yes, from the ribands of my bonnet,
to the very tips of my Adelaide boots. Not that I cared a bit about
his staring; łºś think not—I’ve seen a little too much of the
world for that—not a bit; for I took his looks as if I’d been a marble
statue; looking at him again, and giving him, I should think, a little
better than he sent. -
However, still staring, he began—for I could feel it, that I could, as
if the very pen was in my flesh—he began to write me down. Where-
upon, as was natºral, I looked composed; for I’d seen MoUSER's pass-
É. and though he's not so handsome a man as I might, if I’d only
iked, have .# for a husband, he’s by no means-I should think not-
the fright they made him.
The Ambassador smiled a bit, and went on writing. “There go §
eyes upon the *;" said iſ to myself, as he looked at me; an
whether or no, id feel 'em twinkle. “And that’s my nose, I’m
sure of it,” for it suddenly burned so; ... and that's my mouth,” and I
couldn't help smiling at the thought, +“and that’s my complexion,”—
for I felt a flush,_“and that’s my hair; and now I’m finished.” And
having given my name, of course, I thought it was all over; when the
Ambassador—as if he had been asking for the coolest thing in life—said,
in a sort of English that even a e might be ashamed of—
“What is your ?”
“What!” cried I, and they might have heard me in the street. . .
“What is your age?” said the Ambassador once more, twisting his
ferret moustachio in such an aggravating way that I could have torn it off.
“Well,” said I, “what next?” And that’s all he got out of me.
“What is Madame's age * said the Ambassador, beginning to laugh.
“What a question for a polite Frenchman!” said I, laughing too.
“Ask a lady's age' Well, I’m sure!”
“I must know Madame's age,” said the Ambassador.
i. It’s like your impudence,” said I, “and you’ll know nothing of
the sort.”
“Then Madame can't go to France,” said the Ambassador, throwing
down his pen.
“What is it to France how old I am? France is very curious. Per-
haps I’m five-and-twenty,” said I.
“Five-and-twenty,” cried the Ambassador, and where, he learnt the
words I can't tell, “suppose, Madame, for sport, we go double or quits?”
My blood did boil, but I contrived to say nothing—only to laugh.
… y, Madame,” said the brute, beginning to be gruff, “I must
have your age.” - - -

WE MUST ALL BOW TO CIRCUMSTANCES.
E have no objection
to bow to circum-
stances, like all the

that there is some-
thing rather un-
pleasant in being
obliged to bow
under such a very
disagreeable cir-
cumstance as the
lowering of a
steamboat funnel

in passing through

NAPOLEON CROSSING THE ALPS.
This grand historical sight may be seen three or four nights a week at the
Surrey Zoological Gardens: NApoleon crosses the Alps in a manner that is not
mentioned, we believe, by THIERs, or Bourkſen NE, or SIR WALTER Scott, or
“Chambers’ Tracts,” or any other historian. The manner in which he effects it is
by sliding on at a slow pace across a large sheet of water, and, as he is on horse-
back, the reading, it will be clear, is quite a new one. What lake there is up in the
Alps we do not know; and whether Napoleon crossed it on his celebrated white
horse, which seems to have had a wonderful talent for standing on his hind legs,
we have looked into every kind of history, including the authentic versions
published every year at FRANconi's and Astley's, but cannot find, to our disap-
ointment, the smallest record of the fact. However, as NApoleon did everythin
erently from everybody else, it is very probable that he did as he is represented,
or that he would have done so, if there had been a lake. Another curious circum-
stance is, that NAPOLEoN crossed the Alps amidst a brilliant display of fireworks
—so brilliant a display, in fact, that if it had taken place at the elevation of Mont
St. Bernard, or Mont Blanc, or from any other of the great heights to which
Napoleon's ambition delighted to climb, the reflection must have been seen all
over Europe; and the result would have been that MR. BRAIDwoop would have
been gallopping for days all over England with his engines in search of the fire.
We have always understood that Napoleon crossed the Alps in the daytime, for
the ascent would have been too perilous at night with a horse like the one DAVID
has given him, which must, in one of its extraordinary amphitheatrical jambades
have tumbled, rider and aii, over the first precipice that came in its way; and
if NAPOLEoN did cross in the daytime, it is very clear he never would have done it
in the company of a grand display of fireworks, the effect of which would have
been perfectly lost. NApoleon was not so fond of hiding his candle under a
busheſ as to burn ten thousand Roman candles in the broad daylight. He was
% clever enough to know that a kind of jeu like that certainly ne ralait pas
chandelle, or at least so many chandelles.
Beyond this, we must say the coup-d'oeil is very good; and if NApoleoN had
to go over the Alps again, there is no doubt that, knowing the love the French have
for theatrical display, he would give orders to have it performed in perfectly a
similar manner tº the one Messrs. DANson and souriny have so cleverly
arranged for him; although we doubt if he would ride across a lake on horseback;
and we have our misgivings, also, whether he would allow his Grand Marécha
Jullies –and a Maréchaſ juniºn certainly is in his way, for has he not his
bâton?—to play “God sare the Queen’’ just as the last discharge of Catherine
wheels were running about like mad, in the astonished atmosphere.
With these small exceptions, we are positive that NApoleon would not wish to
cross, the Alps in better style than he does three or four times a week at that
grand shilling’sworth of beasts, flowers, music, and fireworks—the Surrey Zoological.

THINGS FOR A GERMAN TO CALCULATE.
WE always thought that an American was the best person
to calculate; but it seems that there is in London an extra-
ordinary “ Calculating German.” We have not yet had the
pleasure of hearing this wonderful Deutscher, who, we are
told, throws sums and figures about, and catches them
as skilfully as RAMo SAMEE did cannon-balls, but we take
the liberty of Fº to him the following simple calcula-
tions, to which we shall be too happy to receive the proper
answers.
Will he be kind enough to tell us—
When the Great German Empire is likely to be founded,
and what city is likely to be the capital of it?
When those facts are ascertained beyond the fraction of a
doubt, if he would endeavour to calculate the longest
period the said, German Empire is likely to last, and,
supposing it lasts six months, how far distant that great
fact will be from the Millennium of the world?
How often has Austria committed bankruptcy, and what
is the sum total of its several bankruptcies, º whether it
is capable of paying a kreutzer in the pound?
at is the number of political prisoners in Austria,
Prussia, and the little despotic principalities of Germany?
Calculate what good the long-denounced, long-delayed
Constitution has done Prussia, and whether it was worth
while waiting so very long for so very little?
Calculate the revenue Nassau and Baden-Baden derive
from their own resources, and tell us how many times
flºº or lesser they are than the revenues they draw from
those German “sinks of iniquity,” the gaming tables?
Ascertain, if you can, and tellus the name of the German
who does not smoke *
Also ascertain, and pray tell us once for all, “Was ist das
Fairland” for we have heard it many hundred times,
but we never could make out.
THE MONSTER STRAWBERRY.
TRAwBERRIEs have now-a-days
such “greatness thrust upon
ºi. the application of
the forcing process at the
hands of the gardener, that
it is quite alarming. So
* has been thesize
of some of these specimens
of enormity which we have
witnessed, that we are quite
sure there would not have
been room for more than one
in a bed of these gigantic
Strawberries. If the system
of forcing is applied gene-
rally to all other fruits, as
it has been to the Straw-
berry, we shall be having
the common cherry weighing
a stone, and the bigaroon
growing bigger and bigger,
until “two bites at a cherry”
will no longer be ºld
as an absurdity.
Exhibition of Industry.
THE Exhibition of Industry, as far as it has gone, shows
the following results:–
The Industry of complaining, and the Industry of finding
fault, and the Industry of making mistakes, but with very
little Industry to repair them. -
There has also been a wonderful Industry in collecting
money, but a shameful lack of Industry on the part of those
who have the means to pay, and ought to pay, but somehow
will not pay.
THE Polly or A NIGHT.
This Sunday-letter-stoppage business has become so
absurd, that it is almost wanting in good sense to treat
it seriously; so we recommend that some great elocutionist,
MR. Jones, MR. John Cooper, or MR FREDERick Web-
stER, be deputed to wait upon the Post-Office, and try to
cure it of the ridiculous “impediment in its delivery.”

A LEGACY TO FLUNKLES.
To MR. RUFUs RUFFY, Patriot.
INCERELY, dear RUFUs, you will rejoice to
hear that the system of artificial aristocracy,
which you abhor so vehemently, has re-
ceived a very damaging blow.
“You, RUFUs, if you had the ordering
of affairs, would cause the coronet to be
torm from the brow of the decorated lord-
ling, and trampled beneath the feet of an
#: pº e. Not so I., I would as
soon think of bereaving an Ojibbeway of
his top-knot, or an inmate of St. Luke's
of his diadem of straw; may, of depriving
you, my RUFus, of your honest brown-
paper cap. But if you could anyhow per-
suademy Lord quietly, to unbonnet himself,
and dispose of his pericrania embellishment
to MR. NATHAN, the masquerade ware-
houseman,—I think that would be advisable.
“Flunkeyism, dear RUFUs, is not extirpated by the destruction of
its outward shoulder-knots, plush, and gold lace. Witness the French,
and others. If you would Annihilate if attack it in its T. and prin-
ciple—its inward vanity and baseness. The stroke which I congratulate
you on its having had, was thus aimed at its vitals. I allude to the hit
inflicted on flunkeyism, posthumously, by SIR ROBERT, PEEL, in the
request that none of his family should accept of any distinction for
services which he may be considered to have rendered to the State.
“SIR Robert PEEL was a wise man, RUFUs; a great statesman.
To find one as great, we shall have to go back very far in English
history, and I wish you could tell me where to stop before we come to
KING-flºwerver Airmed. I don't mean to compare the two. Ioni
mean to say that PEEL was better than a WALPoLE or a CECIL; an
has he not been a greater benefactor, at least, to us, than PITT *
“Now, this wise man declares by solemn testament, that he will not
have his family ennobled on his account. This is either, a protest
against the principle of hereditary rank, or, it is an expression of con-
tempt for title altogether; and very probably it is both. We know,
Rufus, that PEEL might have been made a Peer over and over again;
but he preferred to remain plain RoBERT PEEL, with no other handle
to his name than a Sir, which, as the world went, he could not have
thrown away without turning Quaker.
A
“A man is ennobled by his deeds. at name, simple of itself, is
a sufficient inheritance of dignity for any family. Men are born unequal
—not equal, as you say, RUFUs—unequal in the scale of humanity, from
the zero of fatuity upwards. Let us be content with the honour and
lory that come naturally to us, and consider, them as derogated from
y investiture with ribbons and trinkets. We won't edizened
and lackered, and silvered, and gilt, and embroidered, to be admired
and envied—envied, mind, my RUFUs, as well as admired—by the
ignoble herd.
“Thus I paraphrase the departed statesman's injunction to his family,
and I reverently say ditto to Robert PEEL. enuine, cool con-
tempt, Rufus, is the only influence that will wither Flunkeyism. In-
digmation rather tends to encourage it, being generally a testimony
: the importance of its honours borne by an unhappy flunkey out
of place.
“Yours, dear RUFUs,

AN IMAGINARY DIALOGUE ON THE EXHIBITION
OF 1851.
(Between DR. JoHNson and Boswell.)
Boswell. WHAT do you think, Sir, of the Exhibition of 1851?
Johnson. Sir, I think it would be a very good thing in its proper place.
It will promote international sociality, and augment the trade of London.
But, Sir, I am sorry it is to be held in Hyde, Park; though the disfi-
gurement of the Park will happily be obviated by the substitution of
M º PAxton's magnificent glass fabric for an unsightly edifice of brick
and mortar.
boswell, Don't you think, Sir, that a public Park ought to be used
for a public purpose? - ----
Johnson. Sir, you . as well ask whether a public building ought
not to be used as a }. lic-house. Sir, the Park is used for a public
pur It is used for the purpose of taki
oswell. But, Sir, are not they who use
air and exercise.
yde Park for that purpose
alimited class of persons, consisting principally of gentlefolks and people
of quality? -
ohnson. No, Sir. The great people ride in the Ring and Rotten
Row, and the common people go to look at them. The fine folks area
pretty show. The diversified liveries of their servants are pleasing, their
complacent countenances impart cheerfulness, and their gay apparel and
handsome equipages exhilarate the spectators. Sir, did you never
observe how the populace shouts for joy to see a splendid carriage going
to the races?
Boswell. But how, Sir, will the Exhibition interfere with the diversion
of walking or riding in the Park?
Johnson. Sir, by creating a miscellaneous concourse of persons who
will be noisy, and whose trampling will wear away the turf. They will
thus destroy the quiet and verdure, which afford refreshment to the eye
and tranquillity to the mind. And, Sir, they will overrun Kensington
Gardens, and probably injure and deface them, besides committing
depredations in the vicinity.
aswell. But has it not been proved, Sir, that the notion that the
Pº will do mischief, if admitted to such places, is erroneous?
Johnson. Yes, Sir. #it a promiscuous rabble, such as collects at a
fair, and such as will be attracted by this Exhibition, is not the people.
Sir large numbers of the people will be incapable of attending the
fxhibition at aii. The agricultural labourers, and the poorer mechanics
throughout the country, will neither be able to afford the time nor the
money requisite for a journey to London. Besides, Sir, if the Exhi-
bition were ever so much the people's concern, it ought, nevertheless,
to be assigned a suitable place. Sir, the people do not want their Park
to be turned into a fair-ground any more than a nobleman would like
his own to be served so. Sir, if you had a conservatory, and I were to
tell you that you ought to convert it into a kennel, simply because
ad a right to do what you pleased with it, you would think that either
I insulted your understanding, or was a fool.
Boswell. But where would you have the Exhibition, Sir? .
Johnson. Sir, in some place, where the neighbours would be glad to
have it, and not in one where they will consider it a nuisance.
Boswell. But you would not recommend a shabby site for it, Sir?
. Johnson, Sir, I do not mean to pun; but the Exhibition, wherever it
is, will include a sufficient sight in itself. The site of Covent Garden is
shabby; and yet §. of fashion will go there to hear Italian Qperas,
No, Sir. Let the bition of the Industry of all Nations be established
in a situation, where, while it is admired as a stupendous spectacle, it
shall not also be execrated as a monstrous bore.
LOOK AT HOME, GENTLEMEN.
A LARGE deputation of Provosts from Glasgow have waited, it seems
upon LoRD JoHN RUSSELL to entreat of him to enforce the new postal
regulations on the Sabbath. Might we recommend to these too zealous
Provosts to busy themselves a little more with the purification of their
own city?, Surely there is plenty to occupy them at home, without
rushing all the way to London to seek for moral employment? If we
have been rightly informed, Glasgow is the most immoral town in the
whole United º than receiving or
- om, and that many worse thi
. letter occur there every Sunday. enness, we are told,
runs about the streets in the most debauched state. If this be true,
and we are afraid there is no doubt of it, it is very evident that these
worthy magistrates may be acting up rigidly to the Letter of the
Sabbath, but at the same time they º, overlook the Spirit.
A New Way to Pave Old Ones.
WESTMINSTER BRIDGE is in a very bad state, and so is King's Road,
Eaton Square. At present they are almost useless, and all but im-
passable. We propose, therefore, that Westminster Bridge be pulled
down to repair the King's Road, and that a new rate be levied on the
MARQUIs of WESTMINSTER, or LoRD GRosy ENOR, or the parish, or
whoever the shabby delinquent is, for the erection of a new bridge. At
all events, the º: would have gained one good way instead of
§ lº. ones, which we call a very good way of getting over two
culties.
Charity made Easy.
LoRD John Russell would not accede to MR. HuME's amendment
of £8000 a-year to the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE,--the e must have
£12,000, because he was expected to be charitable. Mr. Punch-upon
his own responsibility—offers to find any number of individuals who
will be twice as charitable as the present, Duke upon exactly half the
grant. How droll charity may be! You give a Duke a heap of mone
that he may be benevolent, and then laud him to the skies for this pai
philanthropy!

SMITHERs, and the LATE UNPROTECTED FEMALE enjoying then-
selves at the tea-table. The LATE UNPROTECTED FEMALE occupies
the place of honour.
Mrs. Smithers. Another cup, my dear—
you really must.
Late Unprotected Female. Oh! no in-
deed—I couldn’t really. It’s getting
so late. I’ve had a most delightful day!
I really must be going.
Mr. Smithers. Then I’ll ring for the-
[Rings without concluding his sentence.
Enter Maid with tray and tumblers. MR. SMITHERs goes to the
cellaret, and brings out an elaborate liqueur case.
º Unprotected Female. Oh–no, I really couldn't—I never do. No,
really—now.
Mr. Smithers (cordially). Pooh-pooh-come, I know if Jones were
here, he’d insist.
Mrs. Smithers (coaringly). Just a leetle, very sweet and weak.
Remember you’ve an hour's ride before you.
Late Unprotected Female. Well, you’re so kind—but I declare I had
rather not.
[MR. SMITHERs, mires a small tumbler remarkably sweet and
tolerably stiff. MRs. Jones discusses it with unconscious relish.
Clock strikes nine.
Late Unprotected Female. Oh, dear, there’s nine o’clock! And how
ever I’m to venture home alone, in that omnibus P I’m sure MR.
Jon Es won’t like it.
Mr. Smithers. Well, if he will go and leave his wife (he smiles), he
must take the consequences. Catch me leaving MRs. SMITHERs.
Mrs. Smithers. Nonsense, MR. SMITHERs. How can you? He's
such a man, MRs. Jon Es!
Late Unprotected Female (proudly). Oh–so is MR. J., I assure you.
Mr. Smithers. But I’ll tell you what, MRs. Jon Es, I'll drive you
home in my pony-chaise. There !
Late Unprotected Female. Oh-but are you sure it’s very quiet P
Mr. Smithers. Quiet as a lamb. I’ll trundle you to Coram Street in
half an hour.
Late Unprotected Female. Oh-thank you—I’m sure.

Erit MRs. SMITHERs, with LATE UNPROTECTED FEMALE, to
put on “her things.”
[Scene changes to the road, with MR. SMITHERs and MRs. Jones in
the pony-chaise. The LATE UNPROTECTED FEMALE is harassed
with vague terrors, in no way justified by the conduct of the pony.
Late Unprotected Female. Oh-there’s an omnibus ! ôº ºft be
rumi; away. Do hold him tight.
[Tries to grasp the reins, for the purpose of assisting MR. SMITHERs
in holding him tight.
Mr. Smithers (testily). Don't—Marm—
confound it—don't, or you’ll upset us. I tell
you he’s steady as a rock—chck-chck-
Late Unprotected Female. Oh-I know
—but they will shy so. I declare when
drove me down to Kew, last Sunday
fortnight, I was quite ill. He would go so
close to the omnibuses and things!
Mr. Smithers. When do you expect Jon Es home *
Late Unprotected Female, Oh-I should have expected him to-day-
but he hasn't written. He always writes when on his journeys-Ibegged
him to, and I must say he has been very thoughtful. Oh-what is that
white thing by the roadside?
Mr. Smithers (gallantly). Well, I’m glad Jones didn’t come back to-
day, or we shouldn’t have had the pleasure of your company.
Žate Unprotected Female. Oh, you’re very kind, I’m sure. I should
have had a very lonely day at home, so I sent the maid out, and thought
I’d run down and see MRs. SMITHERs.
Mr. Smithers (humorously). And me, too, MRs. Jones, eh?
Late Unprotected Female (playfully). Be quiet, do—you foolish crea-
ture | Oh–there’s something with lamps! (During these and other
such passages of mingled alarm and badinage, they have reached Coram
Street, opposite MRs. Jones's door.) Oh, gracious goodness! Oh, dear!
MRs. Jones is taken very uncomfortable.
Mr. Smithers (pulling up short). What's the matter now *
Late Unprotected Female. Oh, look—there’s a light in the parlour.
Qh, look—it’s going upstairs!, Oh–see—it’s on the first floor! Oh,
there must be thieves in the house—I’m certain there are thieves'
Oh, dear me!
r. Smithers. Pooh, pooh-thieves wouldn't go about with lights,
that way. It’s the servant come back.
Late Unprotected Female. No, she couldn’t get at the candles. They’re
locked up. ... She’s so waste It’s thieves. Oh-hadn’t we better
go for a policeman. Oh, there’s one ! Here! [About to summon A 22.
Mr. Smithers. Stop—stop!, Don't make a fool of yourself. Here,
policeman. (A 22 º Just stand at the pony’s head, willyou,
a minute—and keep an eye on the door—there. É; to Jones's.
A 22 (anticipating beer). All right. [He takes up his position.
Mr. Smithers. Now, MRs. JoNEs. [Offers to hand her out.
Late Unprotected Female. Oh-I daren't—I never can goin.
Mr. Smithers. Come along. Ain't there me, and the Policeman?
Late ſº Female (is with difficulty got out of the chaise; they
pause at the door). Oh-I’ve the key somewhere. . (Institutes a rigorous

SUNDAY MALLS FOR MINISTERS.
AHA!. You see now why LoRD John Russell and his colleagues
have resisted so gently the Sabbatarian invasion of the liberty of the
subject. St.Martin-le-Grand has let the cat out of the bag in the
following notice:—
“BY CoMMAND of THE PostMAstER-GENERAL-To all postmasters, sub-postmasters,
and letter receivers.-General Post-Office, July, 1850.-With reference to instruction
No. 21, 1850, relative to the discontinuance of the collection and delivery of the letters
on a Sunday, it must be clearly understood that the regulations therein laid down do
not apply to the letters addressed to Cabinet Ministers, or to the officers of Government
mentioned in Section 18, Partº of the Book of General Instructions to Postmasters.
These letters must still be forwarded on Sunday by the ordinary despatch.”
It is not surprising that Ministers should put up contentedly with a
public inconvenience which does not affect themselves. As one man
may steal a horse whilst another may not look over a hedge, so may the
Premier be allowed to have a letter of this sort forwarded to him on
Sunday:—
“DEAR John NY, “Woburn, July 21.
“ Déjeiner & la fourchette here early. If you have nothing
better to do, come. “BEDFORD.”
Whereas, such an epistle as the following may be kept lying a whole
day in the Post-Office.
“DEAR FATHER, “Manchester, Sunday Morning.”
“A sad change has come over poor Mother suddenly. Return
directly, if you wish to see her alive. -
“Your affectionate Son,
“W. WEFT.”
Sunday is a dies non to the public at large, but the Ministerial non of
the day is non-observance. Such is Sabbatomaniacal legislation.
A Though T FOR MEt. HORSMAN.
CHEMISTRY teaches that every particle of matter which disappears in
combustion or evaporation may be obtained in a liquid or gaseous form.

A SIGN.Y QUA NON.
The proposition of the French
Government that i. d i. i
every newspaper sno sign
with the jº name, would, if it
were applied to this country, cause
some extraordi revelations re-
lating to the Mysteries of the Press.
It would have an odd and rather
startling effect to find a beauti-
fully eulogistic criticism on Jon Es’s
last new novel signed “JoBN
Jones;” and it would be rather
amusing, at the termination of a
long article in praise of MR-
GAGGER's acting, to arrive at the
words JAcob GAGGER, appended to
the end of it. The world would be
a little astonished now and then by
the disclosure of the magmates of the
diurnal press; and would marvel to
times very Wee people after all.

THE PARLIAMENTARY JOE MILLER.
MEMBERs of Parliament are becoming such professed jokers, that
we really tremble for our livelihood. It is too bad of Hon. M.P.'s to
interfere with our bread and cheese, as we do not attempt to interfere
with theirs. We can conscientiously assert, we never resorted to
bribery or corruption; we can proudly confess that we never, to the
best of our recollection, barked like a dog, nor crowed like a cock, nor
whistled like a steam-engine. It must not be supposed that we are
jealous of “Honourable Members.” Their jokes are so bad, that
without any affectation, or pulling up of our shirt-collars, we coul
not make them, if we were to try ever so much. Their facetiousness
has all the compilation and weight of a Blue-book about it—so much
so, that if we were reduced to the verge of jocular destitution, we
could not stoop to pick up anything so cumbrous and heavy. It
would be like putting a policeman's boot, on the legs of a butterfly.
It is not jealousy, but mere prudence, that makes us speak out. It is
the infection of bad joking that we dread; for whereas one bad orange
will spoil an entire cargo, so a number of bad jokes being thrown
into ! e market, will spoil the pure commodity, and lessen the demand
Ot. 1U.
The debates are quite heavy enough, without the addition of any
extra heaviness, and it is really growing a pain from which no chloro.
form can relieve us, to wade through the facetiae of the large corps of
Parliamentary farceurs. It is like reading one of the early editions of Joe
Miller. The jokes of the Clown in the Ring are positively new compared
to those which are followed in the reports by “Laughter,” “Great
Laughter,” “More Laughter.” We imagine that, as Hon. Members are
indebted to MR. BARRY, for their House, so they argue that they should
be equally indebted to his namesake, Mr. BARRY, of Astley's Amphi.
theatre, for their speeches. If this taste for punning is not checked in
its early stage of Pº. St.Stephens will become very little better
than a Circus, and the sooner WIDDIcomb is installed as Whipper in
the better it will be for the dignity and general ºl. of the
House. We have put ourselves to the trouble of collecting a choice
number of these legislative pleasantries, and in a week or so we hope,
if our co holds good, to astonish the poor reader with a specimen

ADWERTISEMENTS IN HIGH LIFE.
APROPos of certain contemplated reductions in the Civil List, LoRD
BROUGHAM is reported to have said in the House of Lords that—
“The English aristocracy would be lowered if such things were allowed to pass as he
knew were now passing, namely, that a lady of the highest rank, connected with the
families of dukes and marquesses by the nearest ties, was reduced to the humiliating
necessity of advertising for the necessary employment.”
Whose fault is this, HENRY, but that of the dukes and marquesses
themselves?, The “nearest ties” whereby this poor lady is connected
with her noble relations seem to be purse-strings, which she has a
pull upon that draws them uncommonly tight. The meanness of
persons of quality in allowing members of their order to advertise for
employment would look less vulgar if a #. er were started under the
name of the Aristocratic Advertiser, in which the thing might be done
in proper style. The column of advertisements for situations should be
headed “WANT PLACEs UNDER Gover NMENT OR ABOUT THE Court.
—All Letters to be sealed with a Crest.” Subjoined are imaginary
examples of the “Wants.”
As MAID OF HONOUR. A young Lady, who can be confidently recom-
mended as niece to a Duke, sister-in-law to a Peer, and first cousin to several
Baronets. Address to Lady A. B., 984, Park Lane.
S GROOM OF THE STOLE. A noble middle-aged Lord, the proprietor
of half a county, accustomed to attend to his stable. Direct to the Earl of X., care
of MR. SMITH, House of Lords.
As REGISTRAR TO A BISHOP, or something of that sort.—The
younger son of a family of rank, who enjoys a high degree in fashionable estima-
tion, but had the misfortune to be plucked at Oxford. As the young gentleman's
abilities are moderate, and his habits expensive, lightness of employment would be an
object, combined with largeness of salary: i a regular sinecure would be pre-
ferred. Direct to S. S., Esq., Albany, Letter Z.
Aº DIPLOMATIC EMPLOYE.—A Baronet, aged 24, who finds it neces-
sary to dispose of his estate. Has no encumbrance except his debts, and no objection
to travel. Can have a three years' character from his place in the country. Address
to PARCHMENT AND WELLUM, Solicitors, Chancery Lane.
In other parts of the paper, Gold Sticks, Black Rods, Stars, Garters,
Ribbons, and other valuables of that nature might be advertised for, to
the great mutual convenience of noblemen and gentlemen gommanding
: on the one hand, and of the Ministry for the time being on the
other.
But to return to LoRD BROUGHAM's distressed noblewoman. Her
case may be dealt with easily enough by certain, individual members of
the House of Lords, whom it concerns. Would that their collective
Lordships could as easily dispose of that of the millions who can obtain
no employment, although they advertise for it, and pay a most monstrous
tax for so doing!
CLAIMS OF THE BRITISH CHORUS.
To Mr. Punch.
oNSIDERING, Sir, you fre:
quently oblige the world

to implore you to give us
a little employment oc-
casionally. At present we

tion for want of an en-
rement. We have seen

English times were con-
tinually in requisition as

sorry to say, we are en-
- - º superseded by our
foreign rivals, Tra. La Lira La, We submit that they have no ad-
vantage of us whatever, either in respect of sound or sense, and are
Sir, your obedient humble Servants,
Tol DE Rol, LoL.
THE HARDEST WORKED MAN IN THE CITY.
A. For EIGNER, writing of London, with the usual ignorance of
foreigners, says, “The duties of the City Remembrancer are to remind
the Aldermen and Common Councilmen when they forget themselves.”
We can only say that, if these were his duties, no one man could do it.
LOST TO ALL SENSE OF Touch, sight, AND FEELING.
THE Keepers of the Records know so little of the Records entrusted
to their charge, that, when asked for any particular document, their
answer invariably is, “Non mi Ricordo.”
SUNDAY AT THE MINT.
John Thomas, full private of the 190th Greens, and a Sabbath man
to the back bone, thinks his a partic'larly hard case.
LoRD AsHLEY-(and may he never, be, a Cabinet-made, Minister,
because as I read tºother º the Warrior's Gate tap, all Cabinet.
made Ministers are to have their letters delivered to 'em on Sundays
whether they will or no)-LORD ASHLEY has stopped Sunday labour at
the Post-Office, though they do say the labour’s to begin agin, but
that’s not it.
LoRD AsHLEY is asked to look at the ºf in the army;
and most partic'larly at the beknighted state of the loyal 190th Greens,
at present doing duty at the QUEEN’s Mint.
É. the last three Sundays, have I, John THOMAs, full-private, and
cetera, been upon guard as sentry during the very hours of forenoon
church. Here have I been walking up and down, hugging Brown
Bess—(which, if it come to fighting, they'd make me load §. and
fire away upon the Sabbath, thick as pepper,)—here have I, on Sunday,
been guarding the Mint, and therefore, in a manner in which there can
be no mistake about it, serving MAMMON, while, all the Post-Offices is
shut, and LORD AsHLEY in Sunday pew blessing himself for the
Post-Offices being at church.
Now, I put it to LoRD AshLEY, whether the souls of the loyal 190th
Greens are not to be cared for by Parliament House as well as the souls
of Post-masters and missuses? And why should the army do duty on
Sundays ('specially at the Mint, where is the root of all evil), when, as
LoRD AsHLEY can prove as well as he's proved the wickedness of
Sunday letters, that on Sunday even the Army of Martyrs was made
and intended to do nothing but stand-at-ease?
Postscript.—The loyal 190th Greens cannot help thanking MR.
STUMPTREE, MR. DE Rºw: and the other friends of LoRD AshLEY,
for having pº down the Ponish florin. Only them as has had to do it,
can judge of the feelings of the 190th, called upon to do duty at a Mint,
with a Paypist Master at the head, and no DEAF FIBD, upon the silver
that came out of it, which fully accounted for the blight in the ’tatos.
God save the QUEEN.—John THOMAs.
THE NEPAULESE HUNT.
THIS famous hunt still, continues. No sooner is a sight caught
of the Nepaulese Princes, than the whole company raise the hue and
cry, and run in full pursuit of them. The Chiswick Fête, was a grand
day of this description. There could not have been less than ten
thousand persons in the field, including a goodly muster of the fair se
who enjoyed the sport rarely. The Nº. Ambassador was hunt
under a scorching sun, for full two hours, in the most determined
manner. How he managed to keep up so long was astonishing, and we
think he would have been run down at the first burst, only, from the
vast extent of the #. when once he was fairly started, he could
not well escape. He got in the Duke of Devonshire's kitchen-garden
amongst the cabbages, and could not get out again. As it was, he kept
dodging in and out, from tree to tree, running from one tent to another,
in the hopes of cluding his pursuers, but all in vain; they never left him
for a minute, and, wherever he went, there were always some hundreds
close upon his heels.
It is a question whether, for our own pleasure, we have any right to
inflict so much pain and positive torture upon a living creature, and
the poor persecuted Prince must have suffered tremendously. As it
was, many ladies were severely punished, and we noticed on the ground
the mangled remains of two or three valuable parasols, which must
have been literally torm to pieces in the intensity of the rush. Ulti-
mately the poor, panting, Nepaulese Aºi. was caught, and
carried off in a carriage, to be uncarted again at some future festive
occasion for the amusement of HER MAJESTY's respectable subjects.
W * to give the earliest intelligence of the day appointed for the
meet.
The End of Repeal.
Though Repeal has not succeeded, it may be said to have gained its
end, or at all events its own end, for it came to a termination last
Monday week, and a short funeral oration was spoken by MR. JoHN
O'Conn ELL. The poor thing has died in the most distressed circum-
stances, with all its rent in terrible arrear, and with scarcely a roof
over its head: for it was intimated that the existence of Repeal had
become a landlord's question, and that the landlord of the Hall would
no longer tolerate such a miserable tenant. MR. John O'Connell
intimated that the cause of the death of Repeal was the neglect of the
country to “speak out,” but it is perfectly well understood that the
neglect of the country “to fork out" was i. real cause of the catas-
trophe. An old woman and an elderly man in a bad hat and bankrupt
circumstances were the last to adhere to the “dear departed;’ and
when the Hall-keeper came to “clear out,” they reluctantly retired.

THE SEA-SIDE SEASON.
DELICATE STATE OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUs. IT IS ORDERED CHANGE of AIR, AND A LITTLE SEA.BATHING.
THE fashionable lions will be soon “ running down” to the sea-side,
and if such refreshment is required for the “fashionable lions,” why
not for that greatest of all the lions of the season, the Hippopotamus?
We think it is high time that the poor animal obtained #. enefit of
the invigorating sea breeze after the labours of the past few months,
during which he has been the “observed of all observers,” and the
centre of attraction to the whole metropolis. There is also another
reason why the animal should quit town, at least for a time, in the fact
of the arrival of a rival in the shape of the largest Tortoise in the world,
who threatens to dislocate the nose of the Hippopotamus. This Tortoise
is said to be a hundred and º years old, though we are not aware
whether the certificate of his birth is in existence.
It is said that four sailors can dance, and have danced, a hornpipe on
the animal's back, which proves that the poor creature has been very
much put upon. There will, no doubt, be a sharp competition between
the Tortoise and the Hippopotamus in the ensuing season, and as slow
and steady frequently wins the race of public favour, we would scarcely
mind betting that in the long run—which in this, instance must be a
walk—the Hippopotamus may be left in the rear of his more deliberate
antagonist.

THE FRUITs of RAILWAY TRAVELLING.
THERE is a certain tunnel on the North Kent Line, which may be
considered as a sort of rendezvous for luggage trains, imbecile engines,
and runaway locomotives, which occasionally effect a somewhat incon-
venient réunion within the dark recess alluded to. A few days since, a
cargo of fruit got fastened in the tunnel, after several fruitless efforts
to get out, when a passenger-train came running merrily along,
and was converted into a sort of jam among the currants and goose.

Making Jokes by Steam.
THERE is not much general resemblance between a steam-engine and
a stage-coach, and yet there is a small point of similarity between them

It at HEIt Bell EVEs sile ANSWERS IT.
WHEN Fº: was found out, of course, Mr. Punch, it wasn't to be
thought of that women were to take the liberty of the press. Oh, no!
printing types, like razors, are only to be considered as belonging to the
masculine gender. A woman may carry a mountain of wrongs about
with her, and not so much as put one before the public. She is expected
to die, and never so much as squeak. This is the old story; and
MouseR-as I intend to let all the earth know—is only like the rest of
the world, which I little expected when I married him.
The little letter * printed for me last week; a little letter—I will
say it—big with the wrongs of woman as regards her age which is,
perhaps, the most serious thing in life; that letter has drawn upon my
devoted, and I will say it, affectionate head, the most heart-breaking
reply. If I was a stºck’ or stone which Mousº knows I'm not;
quite the reverse—I could not have been treated with colder indifference
not to say contempt. And all for what? But you shall hear. I sen
you MR. MouseR's letter; I don't say that I mayn't be sorry for it
when I see it in print, and my passion’s over; but I’ll risk t i-and

52 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
as in revolutions people are often compelled to leave their lodgings, I
don’t know when your dear, dear, dearest letter arrives—[No, not a word
about MY arrival.]—where your own MoUSER may be.”
And that, Mr. Punch, is what I have received from an absent husband;
that is the reward of an affectionate wife, and
Your constant writer,
AMELLA MoUSER.
The Honeysuckles.
UNCH is anxious to give publicity to an insti-
tution which, under the above title, or some
other, equally expressive, must positively be
established for the purpose of securing a pro-
vision for the destitute widows and orphans
of Royalty. The necessity of its formation is
º by a case, which a sense of decorum
did not prevent the Premier from bringing
before Parliament, and, therefore, will not for-
bid Mr. Punch to mention. The late DUKE OF
CAMBRIDGE, having º in the receipt
of £27,000 a-year, leaves his children in such a
- state of such extreme indigence, that Govern-
ment, being obliged to provide for them, prevails upon the Legislature
to give the eldest son an annual pension º £12,000. Mr. Punch must
say that, if any one of the distinguished writers with whom he is
acquainted had held, for a lengthened series of years, an engagement of
upwards of £500 a-week, and had died without making a provision for
his family, he, Mr. Punch, would have been highly scandalised; and a
sense of duty to his Order compels him to remark that the dereliction
in question is a gross instance of the improvidence of non-literary men.
t is said that the £27,000 was chiefly spent in charity; a plea which
suggests, the obvious reflection that charity should begin at home.
That such will be the commencement of that admirable virtue in the
practice of Royal Dukes and Princes, is the result to be hoped from
the foundation of the Royal Provident Fund, which of course is to be
self-supporting, and will be mainly dependent on the class whom it
more º concerns. Like any other benevolent institution,
however, it be open to subscriptions from everybody; and there
can be no doubt that it will receive an amount of encouragement com-
mensurate with the public's appreciation of the importance of main-
taining all the connexions of the Crown in splendour. Were a Prince
of the Blood to get his allowance from a Fund like this, he might ride
his two hundred guinea º idºl. without exposing him-
self to such, invidious remarks, as “There goes £12,000 a-year, and
nothing to show for it but the clothes ;” or, “There goes the equivalent
to two dozen superannuated men of science or letters, comfortably
provided for with £500 a-year each.”
The Royal Provident Fund will anticipate an objection which some
future Parliament may entertain to enabling Royal Highnesses to be
charitable at the expense of...MR. John Bull. That gentleman does
not much like penniless families to be devised to him, even when the
parents’ claims are considerable. NELsoN bequeathed HoRATIA to his
country, but the legatee has not yet administered to the will.
LIEUTENANT WAGHoRN's widow enjoys a pension some . degrees
short of £12,000 a year. It is to be feared that if MR. BULL's wishes
were consulted, the Royal Provident Fund is all that Royalty's poor
relations would have to look to. -
It may be a recommendation of the Royal Provident Fund, to state
one rather important element in its arrangements. The pensions derived
from it will, in every case but that of absolute imbecility, be annexed to
situations and employments; and the duties of the latter will be pro-
portioned as nearly as possible to the amount of the former. It may
occur to the reader that LoRD JoHN RUSSELL might as well have had
this principle in view when he gave away £12,000 per annum of the
public money the other day.
PUNCH FAIRLY PUZZLED.
WE are not very easily baffled in an attempt to solve a comundrum;
we have seen through a deal board when it has been riddled all over
with shots; we have never had a difficulty about a charade, and as to
a rebus we have gone to it, so boldly that our fortiter in rebus never
could be for an instant questioned; but we admit qurselves to be fairly
puzzled by an advertisement, appearing almost daily, in the papers,
headed, “The oldest Juvenile Dépôt in Lo e cannot under-
ndon.”
stand the compatibility between old age and juvenility, which that
announcement implies. Perhaps, however, there is a jolly-buckism or
old-boyishness about the concern which justifies the title given to it in
the advertisements; but at all events, in the absence of any authorised
º we admit ourselves unable to say with confidence what the
“Oldest Juvenile Depôt in London” can possibly mean.
SUMMER NOWELTIES IN BALLOONS.
THERE seems to be nothing ...i. excepting balloons—and
they are “up and stirring” in every direction. The householders who
live in the neighbourhoods of Vauxhall and the Cremorne Gardens,
must have a nice time of it. What with the shouting, and the crowds,
and the noise, and the fireworks, they must detest the cry of “Balloon!
Balloon!” almost as much as a lady abhors the announcement of
“Please, ma'am, the kitchen chimbley’s on fire.” These detestations,
too, must be rather heightened by the probability of a parachute, with
a live tiger in it ºf in the back garden, or of a number of sky-
rockets falling throug the .. and astonishing the master and
missus, as they are ...; solemnly with their candlesticks up to bed.
The rage for experimental balloons must be stopped, or else all sorts
of extravagancies, animal and pyrotechnical, .*. committed in the
name of science, and every little tea-garden, or suburban saloon that
commands six square yards of open space, in front, or in rear, of the
house, will be advertising a “Wonderful Ascent,” either with or with-
out fireworks, or else with a pony, or a horse, or a donkey, or something
of that sort. The mania of imitation exists as strongly between capitals
as between individuals, and, as it extends, is sure to increase in
absurdity. Now, as Paris has lately witnessed the ascent of a Balloon
with a pony, all “alive and kicking,” London is certain to be favoured
before long with the exhibition of some intrepid aeronaut, who will
richly, deserve the laurels, as well as the appellation of GREEs by
ascending with a bull, or a giraffe, or, it may be, an elephant. Whº,
knows, # this public appetite for Balloons grows more ravenous, that we
may not be astonished some fine morning at breakfast, with the
announcement in the papers of a piece of insanity, like the following :—
UNPARALLELED, ATTRACTION.
In his celebrated Fulham Balloon with the
HIPPO POTAM US
(Of the Zoological Gardens)
Who has kindly lent his valuable services for this occasion only.
At the altitude of 200 feet above the level of Chelsea, Mr. GREEN will
descend from the car on to the back of the Hippopotamus, and discharge a
BRILLIANT DISPLAY OF FIREworks.
N.B. For Seats on the back of the Hippopotamus, apply at the Box Office
of the Gardens.
Won DERFUL AscENT THIS EVENING of MR. GREEN
The only question is, if the above absurdity is *. to be per-
petrated, who is there to | it? We are afraid that, from their very
nature, Balloons are out of the reach of the Law, and if a policeman
were sent to “take up' a balloon, the chances are that he would only
be taken up himself. As there is a class of policemen expressly for the
river, there may probably be instituted a new class of aerial policemen
purposely to navigate the “silent highway” of the clouds. It will be
rather awkward, though, to º a balloon whilst it is discharging
a brilliant display of fireworks, and difficult, as well as unpleasant, to
take it into custody whilst committing the act.
THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS.
BROTH is said to suffer materially from a superfluity of cooks; and if
the rule applies equally to an over-abundance of domestic servants in
every other department, we wonder how the Chiltern Hundreds can
exist under the plurality of Stewards that are constantly tendering their
services. If these hundreds were thousands, there might ºf be a
Steward for every icular unit; so numerous are the acceptances of
the office, in which there appears, nevertheless, to be a perpetual
vacancy. The new Chief Justice of the Common Pleas has, we learn
from the London Gazette, just taken upon himself the Stewardship of
these Hundreds, as a sort of relief, no doubt, to his severer duties; for
the Chiltern Hundreds appear to impose upon their stewards no occu-
pation that may not be combined with any other employment, however
arduous or dignified. -
We wish LoRD CAMPRELL would employ his leisure, in giving to the
world the Lives of the Stewards of the Chiltern Hundreds, an account
of whose stewardships would form a series sufficiently long to furnish
ample materials for even his untiring industry. We should be glad to
know whether the Chiltern Hundreds employ in addition to a Steward,
the usual establishment of butler, footman, page, cook, and housekeeper.
We should recommend the hundreds who “want places,” to write down
to Chiltern at once, and ascertain whether the Hundreds, which have
i. a vacancy for a steward, may not find room for other classes of
omestics.

MR. MALONYPS ACCOUNT OF THE BALL
GIVEN TO THE NEPAULESE AMBAssador BY THE PENINSULAR AND
orienTal-CoMPANY.
O º choose to hearthenews,
B I cannot pass it o'er:
I’ll tell you all about the Ball
To the Naypaulase Ambassador.
Bº: this féte all balls doesbate
t which I worm a pump, and I
Must here relate the splenithor great
Of th’ Oriental Company.
These men of sinse, dispoised expinse,
To fête these black Achilleses.
“We’ll show the blacks,” tº: “Almack's,
And take the rooms at Willis’s.”
With flags and shawls, for these Nepauls,
They hung the rooms of Willis up,
And decked the walls, and stairs, and halls,
With roses and with lilies up.
And JULLIEN’s band, it tuck its stand,
So sweetly in the middlethere
And soft bassoons played heavenly chumes,
And violins did fiddle there.
And when the Coort was tired of spoort,
I’d lave you, boys, to think there was,
A mate buffet before them set,
Where lashins of good dhrink there was
At ten before the ball-room door,
His moighty Excelléncy was
He ºi and bowed tº ail the crowd,
Sogorgeous and immense he was.
His dusky shuit, sublime and mute,
Into the door-way followed him:
Ando the noise of the blackguard boys,
As they hurrood and hollowed him!
The noble Chair,” stud at the stair,
And bade the dthrums to thump; and he
Did thus evince, to that Black Prince,
The welcome of his Cumpany.
O fair the º and rich the curls,
And bright the oys, you saw there, was;
And, fixed each oye, ye there could spoi,
On GINERAL Jung BAHAwth ER, was
This Gineral great, thentuck his sate,
With all the other ginerals,
(Bedad his troat, his belt, his coat,
All bleezed with precious minerals;)
And as he there, with princely air,
Recioinin on his cushion was,
All round about his royal chair,
The squeezin and the pushin was.
OPAT, such girls, such Jukes, and Earls,
Such fashion and mobilitee!
Just think of TIM, and fancy him,
Amidst the hoigh gentility!
There was Lord DE L'Huys, and the Portygeese
Ministher and his lady there,
And Ireckonised, with much surprise,
Our messmate, Bob O'GRApy, there;
There was BARoxess BRUNow, that looked like Juxo,
And BARon Ess REHAUSEN there,
And Countess Roullſen, thatlooked peculiar
Well, in her robes of gauze in there.
There was LoRD CRowHURST (I knew him first,
When only MR. PIPs he was)
And Mick O'Tooie, the great big fool,
That after suppertipsy was.
There was Lond FINGALL, and his ladies all,
And Lords KILLEEN and DUFFERIN,
And PADDY FIFE, with his fat wife;
I wondther how he could stuff herin.
* Jawes Mathesos, Esquiae, to whom, and the Board of Directors of the Peninsular
and Oriental Company, I, Timorºus Matoxy, late-stoker on board the Iberia, the
Lady Mary wood, the Tagus, and the Oriental steam ships, humbly dedicate this pro-
duction of my grateful muse.
There was LoRD BELFAst, that by me past,
And seemed to ask how should I go there?
And the WIpow MACRAE, and Lord A. HAY,
And the MARCHIoness of SLIGothere.
Yes, Jukes, and Earls, and diamonds, and pearls,
And pretty * was spoorting there;
And some beside (the rogues!) I spied,
Behind the windies, coorting there.
O, there’s one I know, bedad would show
As beautiful as any there,
And I’d like to hear the pipers blow,
And shake afut with FANNY there!
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
Ust now there are all the usual
symptoms of the close of the
Session being at hand; and
measures that would other-
wise have proceeded by the
slowest and easiest stages, are
being jerked through both
Houses in the most sudden and
precipitate manner.
The Bills of Parliament,
like some bills of the º:
have met with, seem to bear
upon the face of them the
information that “an interval
of some time is supposed to
elapse between the first and
second acts” or first and se-
cond readings—though, in fact
there is no interval at all: but
conclusions are jumped to by
the legislature with the same
amount of recklessness that is
displayed by the dramatist
when the denouement is de-
sired. Many of the members
- - - have already left their seats
in the House for their seats in the country; and so as a sufficient
number of “reading men” can be kept together to read the remaining
bills of the Session, that is all that appears to be required.
Legislation, which at the commencement of the Session drags its
slow length along, is, at this more advanced period, carried forward at
railway speed; and measures instead of being deliberately forwarded,
and gradually carried, are shoved from stage to stage, pitched from
house to house, and ultimately made law in batches of a dozen or so
at a time; while the Government, like a threepenny’bus, is allowed to
carry just as large a number as it pleases, * the smallest regard
to safety or convenience.
The legislative conductor and driver, feeling their labours to be near
their close, are only in a hurry to get to their journey's end, and will
carry whatever happens to be ready; but will leave behind anything,
however importants that is not exactly prepared to jump up, or imble
on to the roof, or cling to the step, or hold on somehow or anyhow to
the State vehicle. Some passengers, like the County Court Extension,
for instance, may be suddenly deprived of a parcel of the most whole-
some provisions; but with a shout of “Dropp'd aparcel! very valuable
is it? it can't be helped! we can't stop now for anybody or anything.”
the poor victim is hurried off, and, in fact, “carried,” with the loss,
perhaps, of the greater part of that for which the expense and trouble
of being conveyed through all the previous stages had been gone to.
The Smithfield Life Pill.
SMITHFIELD has been somuch extolled lately for its salubrity, and city
medical men have been soloud in their praises of the purity of its atmo-
sphere, and the general healthiness of its neighbourhood, that we wonder
that no Life Pill has yet seized upon its valuable name as a guarantee to
cure everything. ethink, if º advertised, and backed with a
few strong testimonials from well-known Aldermen and Common
Councilmen, that the SMITHFIELD LIFE PILL would be a sure fortune
to any one who does not mind imposing upon the credulity of the British
Public. We should like to do it ourselves, for there is a difficulty now
a-days to make your fortune, unless you º to be a quack, only we
have a few foolish doubts as to the honesty of the transaction.
... WELCOME ARRIVAL-The “Great Bull from Nineveh” will arrive
in September, just in time to put an end to the GoRHAM controversy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RATHER SU SPICIOU. S.
Sentimental Young Lady. “WILL You BE so obliging, MR. Tongs, as to cut
of F A LoNG PIECE of HAIR WHERE IT will NoT BE Missed.”
THE CAMBRIDGE JOB OF £12,000! PER ANNUM.
THE matter is settled—the bargain is struck—between the Ministry and Parliament,
with little further preface, little more time, than a lady who markets for herself takes
to cheapen a pair of ducks or a solitary sucking-pig, and the bran-new DUKE of
§§.*. a crown jewel in cotton—is wrapt for life in £12,000 per annum.
We may not object to Dukes; nevertheless, we may have them with a little too
much gilding. Besides, whatever may be our loving weakness towards a Duke in the
abstract, there are times when we would rather consider the object as a necessary than
a luxury. Human nature is apt to get sulky with an article it º too dearly for.
A Duke at a fair and moderate ſº as Dukes might go, would be assured of a
more continuing respect than a Duke paid for at a ruinous sacrifice. We did not
expect, the Duke of CAMBRIDGE to offer himself as a decided bargain; nevertheless,
when he asks £12,000, we must—though we be charged with a higgling spirit ungra-
i: tºwards the splendid article proffered us—we must inquire, “is º the very
owest?”
Twelve thousand pounds a-year for the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE! And at the present
time circulars lie, in all Government offices; circulars calling upon all clerks to set
down their several amount of salaries, with duties performed, extra-official profits, and
so forth, that the smaller functionaries may, in ories phrase, be .." somewhat
of their incomes. An interesting sum this for certain of the arithmetical clerks to
work; viz.: “How many of us make one DUKE of CAMBRIDGE: How many common
goose-quills are worth the plumage of a golden goose royal?”
When, however, it is determined in the resolute breast of a Minister to obtain a
thumping grant for anybody whom the Crown º to honour (out of the pockets
of the people), it would be pleasant, were the result not so very costly, to enjoy the
ministerial ingenuity and courage, ever so fertile in strong, yea, in seductive reasons
for the extravagance. When the House voted the late Duke of York £10,000
a-year to pay certain visits to his old blind father at Windsor, we think it was the
tragic price of oats that—pathetically illustrated by the Minister-carried the grant.
If, however, it was not oats, perhaps it was the then price of horse-flesh; if not horse-
flesh, why, then, it was the market-rate of filial love! Sure we are, however, that the
Minister had one of these reasons, all equally potent,
wherewith to bend the ductile Commons. -
And Lord John Russell has been no less fertile, no
less successful in his argument for the yearly £12,000
for our novel GAMBRIDGE. His Royal Highness is ex-
pected to be charitable ! MR. Huyſe's proposed £8000
would afford no fund of benevolence to the Duke.
Now, give him the £12,000, and we set him up at once
a dinner excellence—a mahogany philanthropist. Very
well. Only, be it understood that when the Secretaries
of the Welsh Flannel Infirmary, the Royal Pº
Asylum, and, the Coal-and-Blanket Institution,
over the subscriptions after annual dinners, com-
mencing, as with a flourish of the human trumpet
“H. R. H. THE DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, £50”
“H. R. H. THE Duke of CAMBRIDGE, £40”
“H. R. H. THE DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, £20.”
—when these glad tidings are rung forth, we do protest
against any applause. Men shall, hot be duped into
smiting the table with knife-handles—they shall not
rattle glasses—they shall not “hear, hear,” in per-
spiring admiration, fired and glowing with a sudden
sense of the Royal Chairman's charitable beneficence.
No: LoRD John has put the looked-for-expenditure in
a business light; has made a trusteeship of the £4,000,
and H. R. H. THE DUKE of QAMBRIDGE, when he
puts down, his name for £50, and when he pays it—as
of course he will, for when did bird of roya eyrie ever
play the part of shabby decoy-duck?—let the money be
taken quietly, decorously: received as a public t
from the people who, by rigour of the Commons, have
made the Duke their almoner. Surely his Royal High-
ness the easiest conditions of philanthropy; seeing
that he is only expected to give what, for such purpose
has been assuredly entrusted to him. . .
Nevertheless, the new Duke has been lucky in his
year: he has obtained from easy 1850 what he might
have failed to win from ugly, threatening, 1851—for
that is the year financial; the year when L.S.D.—
unrelenting fates!—will really open Parliament, though
HER MAJESTY may nomi perform that ceremony.
Again, the Duke has been fortunate, inasmuch as he
has preceded certain claims—the claimants as yet in the
nursery—upon the public exchequer. . He, of course,
has been at a high figure, that certain little *. le,
bearing precedence of him, may range at a yet higher
numeral. Question: if a Duke of CAMBRIDGE has
£12,000 a year, how much above the Duke is the right
of a PRINCE ARTHUR-a PRINCE ALFRED F
LoRD BRough AM—who has lately elected himself
the special protector, the Chancellor off the woolsack
and without a salary, for royalty and aristocracy—LoRD
BRough AM voted for the Duke's £12,000, and would
vote for all such grants so long as the Royal Marriage
Act was in force, and royal dukes “were not allowed to
intermarry with subjects of this country endowed with
wealth.” Truly this is another argument for the repeal
of “the unchristian law.” If, for instance, H. R. H.
THE DUKE of CAMBRIDGE were permitted to take his
coronet into the home marriage-market—whether at
the West-end or in the City—he would, no doubt,
obtain for a º share of its glory a most sufficing
sum. Were he permitted to the rich heiress of a
dry-salter, or a grocer's widow gilt with a million, we
as a people should save in money, though of course we
should lose in blood. As it is, the Duke—like his
father—may, marry a German Princess in German
verty; and like his father come to us for a further
nt for conjugal housekeeping. Now we expressly
hint that LoRD BROUGHAM on his return from America
will bring in a bill for a home trade in royal coronets!
Why take to Germany at a certain loss, what may be
disposed of at a ready profit at home.
Sunday at Sea.
ADMIRAL Bowles, on the Mercantile Bill, moved a
clause to prevent Sunday labour at sea. And very right:
because it is now a well-known fact—at least to Lord
AsHLEY and all the Sackclothites—that on Sundays at
sea there is never any wind, but a fair and gentle one—
that billows never break—androcks, at least on Sundays,
never threaten. Perhaps, the perfection of a Sunday
cruise—a cruise which we earnestly recommend to the
Sabbatarians—is a cruise upon the Dead Sea:

THE BURIAL OF THE BILLS.
Not a joke was heard, not a troublesome vote,
As the bills into limbo they hurried;
Not e'en INGLIs discharged a farewell shot, .
O'er the grave where the Jew Bill was buried.
They buried them darkly at dead of night,
For bed all the members yearning;
With the aid of the Speaker to keep them right,
And GREEN’s parliamentary learning.
Novain discussion their life supprest,
Nor did truth nor talk confound them;
Thiſ passed a few, and as for the rest,
They burked them just as they found them.
For most of the Session’s task was done,
The supplies marked the hour for retiring;
And as August drew nigh, each son of a gun,
At the grouse, in his dreams, was a firing.
Few and short were the words they said,
And the Speaker looked on, without sorrow,
To the time when he might get his rest in his bed,
Nor a snooze in his chair have to borrow.
MR. BROTHERTON seemed to be dying for bed,
And DISRAELI was dreadfully yellow;
And there sat LoRD JoHNNY with harass half dead,
Unpitied, the poor little fellow.
Lightly they reck through what troubles he’s gone,
And for his slow coaching upbraid him;
But little he cares, so but tight to stick on
To the Treasury Bench they will aid him.
So they settled the Bills—other folks’ and their own—
Never destined to figure in story;
They shed not a tear, and they heaved not a groan,
But they burked them alike, Whig and Tory!
PHYSIC AND FARMING.

RAILWAY ROMANCE AND REALITY.
SoMETIMEs the chief beauty of a story is that there are two ways of
telling it, and an incident may be made * by a little romance
which has nothing attractive in the reality. , Large firms have been
known to ...] a poet, whose office it is to lard an ounce of fact with a
pound or so of fiction, but the Railway Companies would appear to have
in their employ a genius whose duty it is to exercise an opposite func-
tion, and instead of exaggerating the truth, to diminish it to the yery
minimum, and pare it so completely down, that there is scarcely anything
left of it... We are frequently very much struck by the wonderful faculty
displayed by the Railway Historian, whose duty it is to prepare the official
report of an accident, and who manages invariably to make the danger
and inconvenience to the public “beautifully less” than, according to the
accounts of the sufferers themselves, they seem to have experienced.
We subjoin a specimen of the two styles of reports, the one official,
and the other non-official, of a
railway casualty, and we must leave the
public to the task of reconciling, the jº,
accounts, which might perhaps fairly meet each othe
between the two

two trains did when they came into collision in the tunnel:
NON-OFFICIAL REPORT.
FRIGHTFUL COLLISION ON THE SLAP-
DASH RAILWAY.
Yesterday evening at ten o’clock,
just as the up-train entered the
Great Hearse Tunnel, being three
quarters of an hour. after its time,
a luggage train, which was an hour
and a half before its time, was
vainly trying to make its way out
of the Tunnel, with an old worn-out
engine, that was on its way to the
terminus; to be broken up in the
foundry. The result was, that the
tender of the passenger train was
driven with fearful force on to the
last of the luggage trucks, several
of which were immediately smashed
to pieces. The hot water from the
boiler was scattered in all directions,
fearfully scalding the engine driver
and stoker, while the carriages were
driven together with a fearful crash
the horrors of which were increase
by the frightful screams of the
passengers. The , most alarming
confusion prevailed, for the dark-
ness was intense, and after a delay
of about five hours, a fresh engine
was brought to extricate the
alarmed, agitated, and wounded
sufferers from their horrible po-
sition. The amount of injury expe-
rienced by the passengers cannot
be as yet correctly ascertained, but
there is too much reason to believe,
from the jº. of many who
were brought bleeding and mangled
into the station, that there will be
several most serious, and a few
fatal results to this most unwar-
rantable accident.
OFFICIAL REPORT.
TEMPORARY STOPPAGE OF A TRAIN
ON THE SLAP-DASH RAILWAY.
Yesterday evening, while the
up-train was going through the
.* h el with i. usual
punctuality, the regular. luggage
train, which was proceeding at its
custo moderate speed, met
with º check, which some-
what retarded its progress through
the Tunnel, and slightly interfered
with the admirable routine of traffic
on this well-managed line of rail-
way. In consequence of this trifling
deviation from the ordinary course,
the tip of the tender touched the
outer edge of the last luggage van,
*le *** ht jº º:
CauSe (1 a. ial spilling o e
liquid, and the engineer and stoker
sat for an instant with their feet in
warm water, while their hands were
also washed in it. As is usual with
women and children, when taken
by surprise, a few female or in-
fantine"exclamations were imme-
º, uttered. Everything that
could be done by the Company was
immediately done, and we must
add that we could see no reason
for alarm ; and after a pause, the
assistance of a fresh engine was
procured, to continue the progress
of the train on its merry jaunt to
the Metropolis. We have not
heard whether any harm has been
done to any of the passengers,
but a few scratches, and a bruise
here and there, will, no doubt,
be the extent of the injury arising
from this trifling contretemps.
THE FORTIFICATION OF SMITHFIELD.
WE understand that the Corporation of London has it seriously in
contemplation to fortify Smithfield. . The artillery for the defence of
that odoriferously strong hold will be formed of the most stubborn brass,
and several thousand, pounders, of aldermanic calibre, will be ready to
open the fire on invaders. The gabions will be constructed with gabies
of the densest description. A moat (which will afford ingress to animals
and drovers by means of a º will be dug round the encamp-
ment; and into it will be turned the filth from the neighbouring
slaughter-houses, which will render it an impassable gulf to the sanitary
invaders, the boldest of whom will be afraid to poke his nose into it.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison will be AIDERMAN SIDNEY,
and his staff will be composed of DEPUTY UBBARD and MR. TAYLOR, with
several of the most influential slaughtermen connected with the Livery.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKE AND CONSTRUCT.
OMNIBusses are generally constructed to hold 15, but somehow they
are made to hold 18, and on a wet night frequently more than that.

A HEAVY BLOW AND SORE DISCOURAGEMENT.

NExt to last week's heart-
breaking announcement
of LoRD BROUGHAM's
—of “the gentlewoman,
nearly connected with
noble families, reduced
to seek some necessary
means of support by la-
bour”—there is nothing
that has inflicted such a
stab on the glorious in-
stitutions dear to every
Briton, as the recent
intelligence of the minis-
terial intention to cut
down the expenses of
: our diplomatic establish-
ment.
We are deluged with
4 letters on the subject.
Indeed it is fortunate
that this is a time of ge-
neral mourning. Black-

manifesto, which we append :-
From SIR JASPER, J9HDISON, C.B., Knight of the Guelphic Order; Knight of
the Order of St. Ahasuerus; Grand Cross of St. Donnerundblitzen, Companion of
the Order of the Holy Cucumber ºf Cologne; F.R.S., and Honorary Member ºf
several learned Societies; Enroy to the Court of his Most SERENE HIGHNess,
THE HEREDITARY PRINCE OF Hohen-STRUMPFEN-KATZEN-ELLENBoGEN, in the
Principality of that name.
The Undersigned presents the assurances of his high and distinguished considera-
tion to Mr. Punch, and begs to submit to him, for communication to the British
Public, the subjoined notes of the tjndersigned inst any reduction of the allow-
ances for the diplomatic establishment, with which the Undersigned has the honour of
being connected.
The Undersigned Protests,
Article 1–Because the Undersigned, as the representative of the British Sovereign
and the upholder of the dignity of the British Empire, at the Court of Hohen-
Strümpfen-Katzen-Ellenbogen, considers it his duty to spend twice as much as the
Envoys of France, Russia, Prussia, Austria, and the other Great Powers; and is
convinced that the credit of Great Britain in the eyes of Europe, is much deter.
mined by the success of the Undersigned in counteracting the intrigues of the
representatives of the above-named powers, which counteraction cannot be effectively
carried out without the aid of dinners.
Article 2–Because the º has always hitherto spent his allowance,
and has not found anything left at the end of the year.
Article 3.−Because the Undersigned fears it will be impossible to keep up the
resent amicable relations between the Court of Hohen-Strümpfen-Katzen-Ellen-
ogen, and the Court, and Cabinet of Great Britain, unless, the Undersigned is
enabled to pay his bills regularly in the City of Kalbsbratenheim, the capital of
the above-named Principality.
Article 4–Because the Undersigned is convinced that nothing below a salary
of £2000 a-year ought to be offered to a gentleman.
Article 5.--Because the Undersigned has two sons in the diplomatic service, and
would certainly not have devoted them to that service, had he anticipated that
any reduction of diplomatic salaries would be made. -
Article 6.-Because, on a reduced salary, the Undersigned would find it perfectly
out of the question to keep up such a table for the Chancellerie of the Legation,
as the gentlemen attached to the same have been accustomed to. - -
Article 7-Because the Undersigned has to pay large sums for secret information,
rendered necessary by the intrigues of the representatives of the Great Powers in
all the German Residences, and more especi {}}". extremely delicate state of
the relations subsisting between the Court of this Principality and that of the
neighbouring Grand Duchy of Poppenheimer-Pumpernickel, which is notoriously
under the influence of Russia.
º
(There are twelve more Articles, which we have not
room for, but, from which we gather that a Euro War
is extremely likely to break out, if the salary of the Envoy
to the Principality of Hohen-Strümpfen-Katzen-Ellenbogen
is in any way meddled with.)
THE PALACE PERIODICAL.
CIRCULARs in general are regarded as things not to be
read, and perhaps the Court Circular may be included under
the same head, for there is certainly little in it to repay
erusal. The number of that silly little periodical for the
§ , and we looked in
4th of July was especially meag -
vain along its columns for something, that might be re-
ded for an instant as an “amusing article.” The
“leader” simply stated that the QUEEN and PRINCE had
taken an early walk in the Park; but beyond this the
writer gave us nothing in the shape of fact, while he wholly
abstained from comment.
The next article was a short paper upon the PRINCE of
WALEs, and the younger members of the Royal Family,
who were stated to have “walked and rode as usual.” It
is gratifying to know that the children of HER MAJESTY
walk and ride, like other people's children, and that there
is nothing unusual in theirimode of doing so. The next
contribution is devoted to LoRD JoHN RUSSELI, “who,”
says the writer, “had the honour of joining the Royal
inner-party.” On the whole, we can scarcely look upon
the Court Circular for July 24th as an average number;
for though the incident of IoRp John Russºil and the
dinner-party is well—or at least concisely—told, there is
a feebleness, a languor, a want of cerve, and an absence of
pith in the article on the walking and riding of the younger
members of the Royal Family.
We are quite sure that the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT
are not desirous of being . made, every day, the staple
subjects of a very, dull periodical. It is most gratifying
to the nation, to know they are well, and enjoying their
domestic happiness, but sure
“No news” might in this
case be regarded as “Good news,” in order, that their
privacy . t not be perpetually invaded by the authors
of the foolish little work alluded to.
to have a return of the number of subscribers to the Court
Circular—for we doubt if it circulates at all—the amount
We should be glad
paid to the Editor, the salaries of the contributors, and the
cost of printing and publishing.
A WORD OR TWO ON WATER.
WE are afraid that writing upon water is as useless as
writing upon sand, and indeed so much has been lately
written on water, and so little impression made, that who-
ever goes into the subject, however º for the good of
the public, can only expect to have, cold, water thrown
upon him for his pains. A book has been lately published
by a DR. HAssFIL, who favours the world not only with
his own views, but the views of an artist, on the water
we drink; and these views, painted literally in water
colours, show us in all their, disgusting variety of tint and
form, the specimens of animal and vegetable matter we take
in with every drop of aqueous fluid we imbibe. Since we
have seen these alarming pictures, they have haunted us,
and we have been troubled by a perpetual attack of Thames
water on the brain. Every drop is a sort of menagerie in
itself when subjected to the i. of the microscope, by
whose aid we may perceive the water devils, the testacea,
the infusoria, the crustacea, and other abominations, flitting
and floundering about to an extent the contemplation of
which makes our blood run almost as thick as Thames
water in our veins. In the book we have mentioned, there
is a specimen of the water of every, Company supplyin
London, and there is not one of them but may be §
as a species of Grand Junction of everything that is un-
wholesome and revolting to look upon.
The old song of “Drink to me only with thine eyes.”
could never have been adapted to... the water-drinkers
of the present day, for to drink with the eyes shut is
the only resource of the modern votary of our metropolitan
river-gods.

T H E PROSE R.
ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
VII.-ON THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC.
7--> Y rising young friend
HITCHINGs, the author of
“Randolph the Robber,”
“The #. of May
Fair,” and other ro-
mances, and one of the
chief writers in the Lictor
newspaper—a highly libe-
ral, nay, seven-leagued
boots progressional jour-
mal, was discoursing with
the writer of the present
lines upon the queer de-
cision to which the French
Assembly, has come, and
which enforces a signa-
ture henceforth to all the
leading articles in the
French papers. As an act
of Government, Hitch-
INGs said he thought the
measure most absurd and
- tyrannous, but he was
- not sorry, for it, as it
- would infallibly increase
the importance of the profession of letters, to which we both belonged. The man
of letters will no longer be the anonymous slave of the º proprietor,
HITCHINGs said; the man of letters will no longer be used and flung aside in his
old days; he will be rewarded according to his merits, and have the chance, of
making himself a name. And then HITCHINGs spoke with great fervour regarding
the depressed condition of literary men, and said the time was coming when their
merits would get them their own. - -
On this latter subject, which is a favourite one with many gentlemen of our
profession, I, for one, am confessedly incredulous. ... I am resolved not to consider
myself a martyr. I never knew a man who had written a good book (unless, indeed,
it were a Barrister with Attorneys), hurt his position in society by having done
so. On the contrary, a clever writer, with decent, manners and conduct, makes
more friends than any other man. And I do not believe (parenthetically) that it
will make much difference to my friend. HITCHINGs whether his name is affixed to
one, twenty, or two thousand articles of his composition. But what would happen
in £ngland if such a regulation as that just passed in France were to become
law; and the House of Commons omnipotent, which can shut up our parks for us
which can shut up our Post-Office for us, which can do anything it will, shoul
take a fancy to have the signature of every writer of a º article?
Have they got any secret ledger at the Times in which the names of the writers
of all the articles, in that journal are, written down? That would be a curious
book to see. Articles in that ºf. have been attributed to every great man of
the day: at one time it was said BROUGHAM wrote regularly, at another CANNING
was a known contributor, at some other time it was SIR. Robert PEEL, LORD
ABERDEEN. It would be curious to see the real names. -
Foreign Secretary’s articles would most likely turn out to be written by Jones
or SMITH, I mean no disrespect to the latter, but the contrary—to be a writer
for a º requires more knowledge, §. readiness, scholarship, than
ou want in Saint Stephen's. Compare a good leading article, and a speech in the
ouse of Commons: compare a House of Commons orator with a writer, psha!
Would JoWEs or SMITH, however, much profit by the }º of their names
to their articles? That is doubtful. When the Chronicle or the Times speaks now,
it is “we” who are speaking, we the Liberal Conservatives, we the Conservative
º when Jones signs the article, it is we no more, but Jones. It goes
to the public with no authority. The public does not care very much what Jones's
opinions are. They don't purchase the Jones organ any more—the paper droops;
and, in fact, I can conceive nothing more wearisome than to see the names of
SMITH, BRowN, JONES, Robinson, and so forth, written in capitals every day, day
after º under the various articles of the paper. The public would begin to cry
out at the poverty of the literary dramatis personae. We have had BRowN twelve
times this month it would say...That RøBINson's name is always coming up—as
soon as there is a finance question, or a foreign question, or what not, it is SMITH
who signs the article. Give us somebody else.
Thus BRowN and Robinson would get a doubtful aud precarious bread instead
of the comfortable and regular engagement which they now have. The paper
would not be what it is. It would be impossible to employ men on trial, and see
what their talents were worth. Occasion is half a yº writer's battle. To sit
down in his study and, compose an article that might be suitable, is a hard work
for him: twice as hard, as the real work; and yet not the real work; which is to
fight the battle at two hours' notice, at the given place and time. e debate is
oyer at twelve o'clock at night, let us say. Mr. Editor looks round, and fixes on
his man. Now’s your time, CAPTAIN SMITH,” says he, “charge the enemy, and
rout them,”—or “advance, CoLoREL Jones, with your column and charge.”
Now there may be men who are Jones's or Robinson's superiors in intellect,
The Chancellor's or the b
and who—give them a week or ten days to prepare—would
turn out such an article as neither of the two men named
could ever have produced—that is, very likely. I have
often, for my part, said the most brilliant, thing in the
world, and one that would utterly upset that impudent
JENKINs, whose confounded jokes and puns spare nobody
—but then it has been three hours after J.ENKINs's pun,
when I was walking home very likely—and so it is with
writers; some of them possess the amazing gift of the
impromptu, and can always be counted upon in a moment
of necessity—whilst others, slower coaches or leaders,
require to get all their hea #. into position, and labori-
ously to fortify their ãº. ore they begin to fire,
Now, saying that RoßINsoN is the fellow chiefly to be
intrusted with the quick work of the paper, it would be a
most unkind and unfair piece of tyranny on the newspaper
proprietor to force him to publish Robinson's name as the
author of all the articles d'occasion. You have no more right
to call for this publicity from the newspaper owner, who sells
you three yards of his printed fabric, than to demand from
the linen, draper, from what wholesale house he got his
calico; who spunit; who owned the cotton, and who cropped
it in America. It is the article, and not the name and pedi-
e of the artificer, which a º or any other dealer
as a right to sell to the public. I get a letter, (which
Heaven forbid!) from MR, TAFEs my attorney, I know it
is not in TAPEs's own hand-writing; I know, it is a clerk
writes it—so, a newspaper is a composite work got up by
many hireling hands, of whom it is necessary to know no
other name than the printer's or proprietor's..., , .
It is not to be denied that men of signal ability will write
for years in papers and perish own—and in so far their
lot, is a hard one: and the chances of life are against them.
It is hard upon a man, with whose work the whole town is
ringing, that not a soul should know or care who is the
author who so delights the public. -
But, on the other hand, if your article is excellent, would
}. have had any great renown from it, º the paper
ad not published it? Would you have had a chance at all
but for that paper? Suppose you had brought out that
article on a broad sheet, who would have bought it? Did
you ever hear of an unknown man making a fortune by
a pamphlet? - -
Again, it may so happen to a literary man that the stipend
which he receives from one Fº is not sufficient to
boil his family pot, and that he must write in some other
quarter. If BRowN writes articles in the daily papers, and
articles in the weekly and monthly periodicals too, and si
the same, he surely weakens his force by extending his line.
It would be better for him to write incognito, than to pla-
card his name in so many quarters—as actors understand,
who do not perform in too many pieces on the same night;
and painters, who know that it is not worth their while to
exhibit more than a certain number of pictures. . -
Besides, if to some men the want of publicity is an evil:
to many others the privacy is most welcome. Many a young
arrister is a public writer, for instance, to whose future
prospects his fame as a literary man would give no possible
aid, and whose intention it is to put away the pen, when
the attorneys begin to find out his juridical merits. To such
a man it would only be a misfortune to be known as a
writer of leading articles. His battle for fame and fortune
is to be made with other weapons than the pen. Then
again, a man without ambition—and there are very man
such sensible persons, or whose ambition does not go beyon
his pot aufeu, is happy to have the º of .#
and honourabl adding to his income: of occupying himself:
of improving himself; of paying for ToM at college, or for
Mamma's carriage—and what not. Take away this modest
mask—force every man upon the public stage to appear with
his name placarded, and we lose some of the best books,
some of *. best articles, some of the pleasantest wit that
we have ever had. - -
On the whole, then, in this controversy. I am against
Hitchings; and although he insists upon it that he is a
º being, I do not believe it; and although he
eclares that I ought to consider myself trampled on by the
world, I decline to admit that I am º and protest
that it treats me and my brethren kindly in the main.

next from the Lyceum; the next, again from the Lyceum ! And so on. As

“P.S.. I had almost forgotten to tell my AMELIA, that I have run all
over Paris to buy her some pretty little presents—but, I am deeply
grieved to add, without success. [Why?], I tried to purchase a lace
veil—ſ The tº ºf I wantſ—when the thought came over me, as I
looked at it, that the article might be bought better and cheaper in
London. [Of course.] My next endeavour was at a jeweller's. There
I pitched upon what seemed to be a very beautiful chain, when a friend
who was with me—one of my old bachelor friends whom I haven't met
since I was married—one of the steadiest fellows, by the way, in the
world—when he compelled me to remark, that French jewellery, how-
ever fine, was nothing so good-so solid as our own. I assented to
the observation, though not without a pang; and—must buy my AMELLA,
what I do buy, at home. -
“Again, I had this consolation. I am the worst smuggler in the
world. With my foolishly innocent face, the articles would have been
detected upon me, and—isn’t it, my love, better as it is?”
Now, Mr. Punch, I have scarcely made a remark, upon all this. I
have— *N. * at a ruinous sacrifice to my feelings—said almost
nothing. No. I resolved to remain quiet until I’d got MouseR safely
at home. I was calculating upon it, when—you might have knocked me
down with a straw –there came this letter!

“Most ºf business compels me to diverge a little from
my route homeward. My darling, direct, Post-Office, Brussels!

. Indeed! But, Mr. Punch, at this moment, I will not tell you my
intentions, I will not put upon paper the scorpions that—but it’s no
matter. I wish to say is this: if you receive a letter with a foreign
post-mark, don't be surprised if it’s from
Yours (packing up),

“TERMs—cash only.”
THE. Debates last week contained a discussion upon “turnpike
trusts.” This sounds rather like a misnomer; for we always thought
that a turnpike was one of those things that insisted upon ready
money, and never gave any trust.

CHARIVARI
GENEROSITY TO POOR SOLDIERS.
A corresponpENT of the
Times, in the subjoined
º has invited pub-
ic attention to a pretty
graceful act on the
of the House of Com-
mons, and to a judicious,
considerate, feeling, re-
mark on that of the
Secretary-at-War:-
º “The House of Commons
on Friday, with but one dis-
sentient, agreed that the pri-
vate soldier who had earned a
good-conduct medal should be
muleted of one week's pay or
more out of his scanty wages
as the condition of his obtain-
ing the certificate of honour.
The Secretary-at-war, with
that nonchalance so usual in
a-rich man when he treats of
the out-goings of the poorer,
says, “it is no great exac-
tion.”
It would be “no great
exaction,” to deprive
poor soldiers of their
week's pay, eh, MR. Fox
Mºre? No great ex-
action; no, only a little
one. Weil then, perhaps
it would be no great
generosity, Right Ho-
nourable Sir, if you were to subscribe a week's salary towards finding them medals
gratis. In that case, the men may be willing to keep the baubles; otherwise, it is
probable they will be inclined to sell them for what they will
fetch. And it would,
no doubt, pay any enterprising speculator to buy them up, and send them over
to some country ill-disposed towards us, to be hawked about as curiosities—sold
as extraordinary illustrations of British meanness.
RAPID ACT OF ASSMANSHIP.
THERE is at, present, such a glut, of the balloon-market,
that the aeronauts are
jostling each other in the air, and the veteran GREEN’s car is stopping the way
of the car of the veteran GRAHAM. A mere act of simple straightforward balloon.
ing has, however, lost its effect on the public mind, which refuses to be aroused
º anything less exciting than an aeronaut on horseback, who runs a fearful risk
of being sent on the same journey that a beggar is said to
he turns equestrian.
Last week the veteran GREEN was announced to ascend
back; and when the ºf came, a poor little pony
with his legs stuck into socke -

in a balloon on horse-
was brought forward,
ts—like a couple of pairs of candlesticks—and the
veteran, supporting his feet upon a pile of ballast-bags, ascended in the balloon
with the animal between his ſegs; but resting none of his weight on the dimi-
nutive quadruped. The whole affair was a

MR. NonTON, the Lambeth Magistrate, had been taken, and a wooden horse had
been used, instead of a real po

of the word, and he will then spare the feelings of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to the Dumb Species. The air is not the proper element for eques.

Astley's in the skies above the suburbs.
BONNYCASTLE AND BROADCLOTH.
There is doubtless an affinity, between weights and measures, but the substi.
tution of tailors' weights for tailors' measures—a state of things to which we
are approaching—will have in it something rather
culiar.
The advertisements
now continually inform us that we may purchase paletóts weighing only so many
ounces, and we shall soon be expected to buy our clothes by the pound, as we do
our tea and sugar... We shall be sending to our tailors shortly for such and such a
quantity of mixed garments, including so many ounces of strong boys' black,
and a quarter-of-a-pound or so of green, or any other serviceable colour. The
cheap tailoring, like the cheap tea-dealing, leads, of course
to the introduction of
a quantity of spurious trash, and we recommend the public not to try more than
an ounce at a time of those articles which they see announced in the puffing
advertisements.

for in that house everything is very hard of hearing.

BALLOON SCIENTIFIC PREPARATIONS FOR
THE ENSUING WIEEK.
Monday. The veteran GREEN will ascend on the veteran

ardens.
Tuesday, MR. BARRY, the Clown, will mounton a donkey,
and sing “Hot Codlims” at the altitude of 600 feet.
Wednesday. The veteran GREEN will, in the character of
an old witch, mount on a broom, and dance the witches
dance in the air.
Thursday, LIEUTENANT GALE will disguise himself as the
Courier ºf St. Petersburg, and ascend on the backs of six
blind horses. -
Friday, MRs. GRAHAM, or MADAME WHART.ox, will
make her ascent on horseback as Lady Godiva. -
Saturday. Grand race between six balloons with six
horses, and six balloons with six donkeys. N.B.-None
but English donkeys allowed to compete.

STATUEs and monuments of many kinds are to be erected
to the memory of PEEL. We rejoice thereat; and, rejoicing
wish the number doubled. But how about Woºdsworrº
No monument to him—or only one at most? SHELLEY
has called poets “the unacknowledged legislators of man-
kind.” WoRDsworth has been a most potent legislator;
something more than M. P. for Rydal Mount. Nevertheless,
as only being a legislator in print, and not in Parliament, he
is a ºtorunacknowledged. LoRD JoHN proposes no
statue for him.
THE STATES MAN's DREAM.
ALDERMAN Humph ERY, in the course of a debate on the
new House of Commons, said, that, in consequence of its
limited accommodation, Members would often go out totake
a map in the Library. We are quite sure that no Member
anxious for a nap will take the trouble to go out into the
Library. He will merely keep his seat during a debate, and
exhausted nature will soon find repose.

:
HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN THE HOUSE.
ART I –A night in February.—Hour half.
past 10 p.m. Order of the day; Bill for re-
gulating the parement of Belgraria. House
already in Committee; MR. KERNEL in
the Chair. About fire hundred Members
present, and all awake.
MR. DE NEwgATE moved that the
Chairman do report progress. (Tre-
mendous cheering from all parts of the
House.) They had been sitting two hours,
and the measure was far too important
to be pressed further to-night. (Hear!)
In his opinion they had gone too far already, and, considering the
lateness of the hour, he hoped there would be no opposition to his
motion. (Cheers.) - -
CoLoREL SIBTHORP cordially concurred. He would stand by his
excellent friend to the last; ay, to the death. (Oh! Oh! from MR.
John O'Connell.) It was very well for the Honourable Member to
cry “Oh!” Would he do the same? No, he would not l. He knew
better. He talked once of “dying on the floor of the House,” but
it was all moonshine, Sir-humbug—disgusting rubbish—and so was
everything that came from that side of the House.
MR. John O'ConnELL complained of being misrepresented by the
gallant Colonel. He had not cried “Oh!”. He had cheered the Hon.
and gallant Member. He too, like the gallant Colonel, would stand to
the death in resisting this indecent attempt to force an important—he
would add, an Algerine—measure upon a reluctant and overpowered
House—and he begged to tell the Hon. Member that, notwithstanding
the sneers at his proposal “to die on the floor, if necessary,” in now
repeating that proposal, he was now as much in earnest as ever he was.
(Loud cheers from the Irish Members.)
Colon EL SIBThorp accepted with satisfaction the apology of the
Hon. Member—might he say, Hon. friend—
MR. John O'Connell, acknowledged the compliment in the usual
manner.
LoRD JoHN RUssell thought that the discussion on a bill like this,
of comparatively small importance, (No.' No 2 and terrific "...ſ.
all parts of the House,) might be allowed, at this early hour, (renewed and
boisterous expressions of dissent)—why, it was only half-past 10 o'clock,
(general disapprobation,)—to go on to the end of the first clause. If at
11 o'clock they had not got so far, he would then willingly consent to
the postponement of the measure for another evening.
[Cries of “Report progress,” “BRoth ERTON,” “Time / Time!” &c.,
‘c., &c., amidst which LoRD John Russell, resumes his seat.
Many other Members having in rain essayed, amidst the storm
which ensued, to obtain a hearing, the question to report progress
is put by MR. KERNEL, and carried without a }... T
further consideration of the measure is put off for three weeks.
PART II—A morning in August, hour 2 o'clock a.m. Order of the day:
Bill for putting the Army, Nury, Constabulary, Judicial and other
Establishments, upon a new footing, and for vesting the management

That this House do now adjourn.

LORD DOUBLEJOHN.
THERE dies a great philosopher or bard
Leaving his wife and children to the Nation;
A meagre pittance is the State's award, .
Barely enough to save them from starvation.
To all complaint replies the Premier ºf
“True, ’twas a hard case—deeply he deplored it;
More Government would give, but”—with a shrug
He adds—“the fact was, they could not afford it.”
A public maintenance a Duke demands
f Royal stem—herein his sole pretension—
The liberal Minister, with open hands,
Gives him twelve thousand pounds a year for pension.
“Come, come,” pleads HUME, “you know you’re in distress:
Eight thousand were an ample patrimony.”
“Twelveſ” insists John—“we couldn't think of less.”
Oh, Humbug" Humbug' sure thy name is JoHNNY.
FLEETING POPULARITY.
THERE is a gentleman named HAMET who is enjoying just now a large
amount of popularity as the bed-fellow of the Hippopotamus. Un-
fortunately, the career of this individual hangs on a slender thread—the
thread in question being the life of the animal from whom he derives all
the éclat that at present belongs to him. Should anything happen to
the Hippopotamus, it is too clear that poor HAMET will be no longer a
subject of interest. Hippopotami are so rare that it is very unlikely
he another would be found to attach himself to HAMET, who would at
once fall into the ranks of wretched insignificance. There have been
many instances of this sort of reflected fame, and there have been
known one or two cases of renown having been shed on humbler persons
by the companionship of LoRD BRough AM, whom we may describe as
the moral, social, intellectual, and political Hippopotamus of the present
day, for his Lordship is certainly in all respects a prodigy.
Places not Wanted.
By an act lately passed, there are certain appointments to be made
of persons who are to be styled “Directors” of various prisons. The
salary is good, but there is such a horror of the very name of “Director,”
with the odium and liabilities attached to the office since the bursting of
the railway bubble, that it is feared no one will be found willing to
accept the office of Director of any thing.
THE PARLIAMENTARY PAIRING SEASON.
EveRY day, the paper contains a short list of what may be termed
… "º. pairs,” consisting of a number of “blessed couples” of Members
of Parliament, who have “paired” for the remainder of the session.
In every instance "º. paired are by no means well matched,
and, looking at the difference of opinion on both sides, we should say
there never could be more decided cases of ill-assorted unions.
Sabbatarian Fraternity.
THE Morning Post of Monday last week stated that some persons of
authority in the neighbourhood of Mecklenburgh Square, Doughty
Street, Foundling Hospital, had on the.P.": Sunday caused the
pump in that ". to be actually locked up—secured with a strong
iron chain and padlock. This tyrannical behaviour towards a pump
shows how very little the Sabbatarians are actuated by brotherly love.
MR. John GAYTER (nodding encouragingly and deprecatingly). All #.

The Ayes have it. That this be the Pre-
amble. Opinion say Aye! contrary No! The Ayes have it. That I do

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWARL

FOUR EQUERRIES AND THREE CHAPLAINS.
THE first acts of the reign of His Roy AL HIGHNESs THE DUKE 9F
QxBRIDGE will have been read with edification by the British public.
By the first decree Royal Highness appoints four equerries to wait upon
him, by the second decree Royal Highness appoints three chaplains for
his Royal Establishment. -
The equerries are privy councillors in jack-boots, and secretaries-at-
arms, ... Highness.
When Royal Highness is inclined to take a drive, CAPTAIN THE
HoNou RABLE LANCELOT PRANCE will ride on his right hand, MAJOR
THE Honour ABLE TRISTRAM TROTTER, on his left, CoLoREI. THE
HoNour ABLE ARTHUR WHIPPINGHAM will ride in advance, while the
fourth equerry, BARON SPURZINSTERN, will bring up the rear. -
The equerries will take it by turns, two and two, to attend at his
Royal Highness's meals; the muffins and newspapers for breakfast, and
the two first entrées for dinner, being brought in on horseback by the
officers in attendance. -
His Royal Highness will examine his letters mounted: transact his
business at a canter: look over his accounts at a hand-gallop; a
receive petitioners and grant interviews at a full trot. Business generally
will be transacted at the rate of eight miles an hour.
As Religion has ever been the accompaniment of Chivalry, his Royal
Highness’s three chaplains will be in constant attendance upon the
PRINCE and his Royal Suite. The REv. MR. BENEDIck will say #:
before dinner, the REv. MR. CHANTRY after dinner, and the REv.
Mr. Lºup ask a blessing on the second course.
The equerries will say their Catechisms every morning on horseback
in the front yard of Oxbridge House. The household will be instructed
in learning generally, and the Royal Footmen and Maid-servants will be
put through a course of “ Hatts's Hymns.” -
A chaplain will always sit on the box when Royal Highness drives
out, and will improve the time by, delivering a lecture: the footmen
behind will officiate as clerks, and the equerries in waiting will be
examined as to the text and the discourse.
The reverend gentlemen will each take two days in the week on
which they will deliver sermons to the Royal Household: on Sundays
all three will preach of course, when the whole establishment will
expected to attend.
or of what use are three chaplains to a Prince of the nineteenth
century, if he does not intend to make use of them? What is the
meaning of a reverend gentleman being chaplain to a Royal Highness,
if the duties of the chaplain are merely nominal? t can a Prince
want, with three chaplains, or three chaplains want with a Prince?
What can a quiet, kind #. and simple gentleman, Prince though
he be of the British Blood Royal, want at this present period of time
with four equerries and three parsons in the Gazette & e these cere-
monies now-a-days useful and decorous, or absurd and pitiable; and
likely to cause the scorn and laughter of men of sense? When the
greatest and wisest Statesman in England dying declares he will have
no titles for his sons, and, as it were, repudiates the Peerage as a part
of the Protective system which must fall one day, as other Protective
institutions have fallen—can’t sensible folks read the signs of the times,
and be quiet? When LoRD JoHN comes down to the House (with that
pluck which his lordship always shows when he has to meet an unpopular
measure), and asks for an allowance, which the nation º ts
to its pensioners, when the allowance is flung at his Royal Highness
with a grumble, is it wise to come out the next day with a tail of
four equerries and three cle en?
Ah, noble Prince' reflect that, besides your Royal Highness, there is a
family of great-grandchildren of GEORGE THE THIRD, who look to aloyal
British nation for maintenance and house-room; that, as Marlborough
House is wanted for one Royal Highness, and granted, not without
ſº so others will naturally want board, and lodging, and Red
ion House, or Bloomsbury House, or Baker House, ma required
for the Royal brothers of the PRINCE of WALEs; that t ese. Princes
º increase and multiply, and that their sons will want establishments
and Parliamentary grants, as your Royal Highness does at this day.
Say that there are four Princes, and that each has three sons: put six
uerries and four parsons apiece for the elder Princes, and your own
allowance of four and three for the younger potentates; we have then
(of the elder branch of your illustrious House, sixteen Princes attended
by seventy-two equerries, and fifty-two chaplains. What a calculation!
If our noble Minister, LoRD JoHN, is Premier forty years hence, there
is no doubt he will have the courage to pro allowances for them
all; and as the cost of their maintenances jº. most unpopular with
the country, my Lord will with only the more ardour advocate their
rights. But what a public ferment there will be meanwhile, of which
according to his nature, my Lord will take no heed ' What a general
scorn, and laughter, and indignation These Court trains, people will
say, are monstrous and unseemly. Princes might wear pig-tails as well
or touch for the king's-evil. Among the men of sense, the working and
thinking people of the empire, the men of this day, eighteen-hundred-
and-fifty, do you suppose it is sufferance or respect with which these
nd |tious” in its Parliamenta
old-world ceremonies and superannuated Court antics are held P. The day
for such draws to a close, and the time is here when it is best to shut
up the old pig-tails, and trains, and gold sticks, and frippery—at which
the working world now looks with scarcely more respect }. at PRINCE
WIDDICOMB's procession, when he enters the ring with his gentlemen,
and his grooms, and his jester.
A NEW CRY.
IF any of the Members of the House of Commons should wish to
“go to the country with a cry” during the recess, we beg leave to
call the attention of Honourable Gentlemen to a cry, which appeared
for the first time on Friday last, in the report of the debates in
Parliament.
The cry alluded to is one that we may often expect to meet with
again; for of all the cries in which Honourable Members are apt to
indulge, there is none more likely to be appropriately called into use
than the cry in question. It appears that . REYNoLDs was making
a facetious s —we beg leave to say that we use the term “face-
sense—when, among other venerable
matters, he introduced the old story of Paddy doing nothing, and ToM
helping Paddy. Now, although the House of Commons may be used
to this sort of thing; and though in all the jokes of Honourable. Mem-
bers the venerable is the prominent, feature, the story to which we
have referred smacked too much of the antique for even a legislative
audience; and the walls of Parliament rang, for the first time we
believe, with the cry of “Joe MILLER.”
The difficulty of getting anything like novelty in the shape of a cry
must be, acknowledged by all who are familiar with the attempts of
Honourable Members to imitate the early village, and other varieties of
the cock tribe, as well as the more congenial bray of the donkey, and
numerous other sounds which nothing short of collective wisdom
been able to originate. The cry of Joe MILLER is something quite new;
but since the House of Commons has taken to joking in right-down
serious earnest—and there is nothing half so serious as a legislative joke
—we may expect the words Joe MILLER to be heard continually in the
course of the debates, during the ensuing session.

Of the behaviour of the men themselves under fire I cannot, of course,
speak, as they have as yet seen no actual service in any field, except the
ordinary operations of husbandry. Nor can I form any conjecture on
this subject; for the probability of their ever being called upon to act—
except in the sense of playing the part of soldiers—is, in my opinion, as

AS REGULAR AS CLOCK-WORK.
THE expression of “as regular as clock-work” will never
ply to the clockworks of London, for it is a question whether
there are any clocks in the world that do their work so irre.
gularly as the clocks of London. First of all, one half of them
never do their work at all, and the other half get through
their work in such a slovenly manner, that we wonder their
faces do not turn crimson with blushes every time a person
looks at them. It is impossible to tell the hour of the day from
them, and we would recommend that the whole company of
Iondon clocks be thrown into Chancery, in order that they
may be stopped, or broken up altogether, or else be made
amenable, like railways that are in a similar state of suspension,
to the stirring clauses of “The Winding-up Act,”—for we must
say that “A clock that can work, and will not work, ought
to be made to work;” unless, perchance, the public clocks have
been stopped by order of the Sabbatarians, who openly object
to anything working on the Sunday.
A Judge Knocking at the Door.
THE papers last week contained an account of some un-
seemly opposition to the opening of a door for the Judge, at
Newcastle, when his Lordship was desirous of getting to his
colleague, to consult him on a point of lawº: a question
of life or death to a prisoner then under trial. The blockading
party consisted of a number of County Magistrates, who had
a most appropriate leader and spokesman in an individual
named Nº. for the whole affair, as reported, very
like a remnant of truly monkish ignorance,
STATE OF THE RAILWAY-MARKET.
We begin to wonder that there is any railway market at all,
after the protracted fits of º and countless instances of
relapse to which it has been subjected. There must be a sort of
cat-like vitality in the market to enable it to survive so many
severe shocks, for every bulletin announces either some fresh
“relapse,” or the continued absence of “all signs of recovery.”
It is a pity that somebody does not go and put the railway
market out of its misery at once by killing it off-hand, for, in its
present weak state, it must be wretched to itself, as well as a
nuisance to others. We are beginning to be quite tired of
hearing that the railway market is “no, better,” and we shall
..., glad when there is an end to, an invalid, who
has long ceased to be productive of even the most moderate
interest,

CRUEL CASE OF JEW-DROPPING.
Guildhall, July 30.
QRºgºžić35 some hard-hearted and cruelly-disposed person has
dropt between the Statues of Gog and MAGog, Guildhall, a Full-Grown
Male Infant of the Jewish Persuasion, swathed in bank-notes, and in a
basket, bearing a direction worded—“To the Care of the Electors of
London, to be kept close until neart Session,”—any Reward commensurate
with the Cruelty of the Deed will be given for the Apprehension of the
Offender, who is suspected to be a little, wiry man, frequenting
Downing Street and the House of Commons.
FARNCOMBE, Mayor.
A DONKEY ON BALLOONS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“I AM a public jackass; in a word, I am the very donkey
that, from the days of my foalhood, has been #". ‘up’ for the ‘other
twopence.’ I know what it is to be elevated above the world; and
therefore beg to be heard—in reply to MR. Norton, the worthy
magistrate of Lambeth—on his unguarded opinions expressed a few
days ago upon the meditated ascent from Vauxhall of a horse, belly-
...i to a balloon, with MR. GREEN upon the horse's back.
“MR. Norton said, ‘a wooden or hobby-horse would serve just as
well.” By no means; for the whole fun of the thing—the whole
interest of the matter—is in the chance whether the horse shall not
come tumbling from the sky (with the balloon-man upon or off his
back), so much dog's-meat.
“Why, Mr. Punch, did the people drop their mouths and º their
eyes with wonder and exultation, when they saw me—(for of late, the
lice have forbidden my professional exertions; and I am now, for the
i. of my health and the exercise of young ladies, on the donkey-
stand at Gravesend)—when they saw me, I say, tied helpless to a
ladder; and that ladder balanced upon the chim of the man monster who
thus supported me? Why, the whole pleasure was in the thought
that I might come down with a smash upon the stones—that I might
break my legs, or my neck; or haply tumbling upon my persecutor,
break his neck into the bargain,
“Without this pleasant stimulus, do you think that even an en-
lightened º: would have clubbed the ‘other twopence’ to
send me “up?' hy, no. But the money was subscribed (too often,
1 shudder at the thoughts of it, too quickly subscribed) in the fiendish
hope that I should no sooner be up than down.
‘It is upon the same principle that a humane and º people
put down their shilling to see a horse carried into the clouds. It is º:
danger to the poor brute that is the intellectual sauce to the refined,
the money-giving Christian!
“Mr. Punch, I have often thought of writing my Recollections under
the title of The Ladder of Life. next winter I can keep out of the
hands of a sandman, or any other such low dealer, I shall have time
enough, and will certainly attempt it. Then I’ll let the world know
with what º with what contempt, an elevated jackass may look
down upon the mob! Then will I describe the emotions of disgust and
scorn, sublimed by an asinine sense of superiority that possessed me;
whilst from the Ladder, with meekly-seeming face, but with an out-
raged and burning heart, I, the four-legged ass, looked down upon the
biped donkeys beneath me. -
“I don't know, at the time I write whether MR. GREEN will go into
the clouds upon horseback; but if he does, I know what I’d i. if I
only had the power; I'd make him for his pains take his next trip into
the sky not on the back of a horse, but on the back of a porcupine.
“Your obedient servant,
“TwopeNCE MoRE AND UP went THE DONKEY.
“P.S. As I write this on a Saturday, I have sent it under cover to
LoRD RUSSELL, that—he being a Minister—you may get it early
through him on Monday morning. Perhaps you’ll be ºilſ. surprised
at the elegance of my literary style. I feel it myself. But the . is,
all the Midsummer holidays. I’ve every day carried Miss INDIGo—
a lady who’s drinking our milk here for weak health, and who has at
this minute a book of promising poems somewhere in the press.”
THE CITY COMMITTEE'S REPORT OF
SMITHFIELD MARKET.
THAT Smithfield Market is the healthiest º: not only in Englan
but perhaps in the whole world. It is a well-known sanitary fact tha
slaughterhouses are highly conducive to health, and so well convinced
are medical men of their beneficial effect upon invalids, that they
always send their most delicate patients to take lodgings in the neigh-
bourhood of the market, and so rapid is the change that takes place in
their constitution, that they rarely ever see them again. . . - -
That §. Market, far from being the noisy spot it is maliciously
described to be, is distinguished for its extreme quiet.. There is a
legal, learned stillness in i. air, that many students prefer it to the
| Temple Gardens, or any of the Inns of Court. It has the further
advantage, too, of being as still during the night as during the day—so
much so, that the repose of the above-mentioned invalids is rarely dis-
turbed after the first week.
That the cry of “Mad Bull” is always an occasion of great sport to
the street in which it is raised, more especially to the little boys who
always join in it with the greatest glee and harmlessness. -
That the shopkeepers rather, like the bulls walking into their shops
than otherwise, declare that if it were not for the difficulty of
getting them out again, they decidedly should be very fond of it.
That the sensation of tossing is far from disagreeable; and that
the Committee have been told of the instance of an old man who lives
at a public-house in Cow Lane, and is so fond of tossing, that he is
always ready to do it for a pint of beer, or even less.
That very few accidents occur about the market, and when they
do, it is invariably the fault of the parties who are injured by the
accidents, and not of the poor animals who commit them. -
That these accidents, however, are rarely fatal, from the simple
reason that those who escape with their lives from the first accident,
rarely put themselves in the way of receiving a second.
That those bigoted persons who persist in asserting, contrary to all
evidence, that Smithfield is a nuisance, evidently know nothing about
it, and if the Market were to be held to-morrow in the Horticultural
Gardens at Chiswick, they would still maintain that the place was not
good enough for them. . . - -
That, to conclude, Smithfield Market is, if anything, too good
for the purposes required, and the Committee are unanimously of
opinion that the animals ought to feel themselves proud to be sold in
such a locality; and the residents in the neighbourhood should be
too thankful to the City for having brought such advantages, not only
to their doors, but actually within their shops, and occasionally carrying
them into the very heart of their back-parlours.
THE JEWISH OATH QUESTION A CENTURY HENCE.
(From Posterity's History of England.)
THE singular inconsistency which marked the conduct of our ancestors
during a period which has deservedly been styled the Age of Humbug
was strikingly exemplified, just a century ago, in the course of the
struggle of Bºron Rothschip to obtain possession of his seat in the
House of Commons. The opponents to the Jewish claim to participate
in the Legislature first resisted the demand of the Baron to be sworn
on the Old Testament. Defeated on this point, they next objected to
his omission, from the prescribed adjuration, of the words “On the true
faith of a Christian.” They thus refused to recognise the validity of an
oath unaccompanied º profession of a creed which, if plain gospel is
its exponent, forbids all oaths whatever; they disallowed a request to be
sworn on the book which alone contained their own justification of
swearing; and required as essential to the juratory act that it should be
performed on that very volume which seems expressly to prohibit it.
Conversations of Lord Brougham.
A Little book with the above taking title will shortly be published.
It will consist of the conversations held by LoRD BROUGHAM in the
House of Lords, either on presenting petitions, or whilst the debates
are going on. It is expected not to exceed 18 volumes, uniform in size
with the “Conversations of Lord BYRON.” The announcement has
caused an unusual excitement amongst the butter-trade.
RIDDLE FOR LORD AshLeY.
Q. WHY is the eondition of a medical man without patients like that
of a Sabbatarian eating a hot dinner on a Sunday?
A. Because it is Profession without Practice.

Proctor (to UNDERGRADUATE). “PRAY, SIR, will you be so good as to TELL Me
whetheR You ARE A MEMBER of the UnivERsity, or a Scotch TERRIER!”
HUDSON TAKES A STEP FORWARD.
THE Grace-Digger in Hamlet was wont to wear some dozen legendary
coats; in fact, he was all coats, like an onion. He used to take them
off, shout increasing upon shout at every removal. However, the
business of the scene never permitted him to put the garments on again:
he made his exit peeled and slim. It is otherwise with the uncrowned
HUDsoN. His coats, one by one, have been plucked from him; he has
been shown pretty well bare; but, it appears, there is a chance that he
may be again coated—whitewash coated. The Yorkshire Gazette declares
that MR. Hudson has released himself—head and hands—very grace-
fully from the pillory in which, on a late trial, SERJEANT WILKINs
fixed him. - - -
“In his evidence in the trial alluded to we believe he has made a good step forward.
We have ourselves seen and heard read nearly or quite a half dozen letters from as
many men of good position in society, present in York at the trial, to different
individuals, all speaking of the great and favourable change made in their minds in
MB. Hudson's favour by his evidence.”
We are almost prepared for the time when MR. Hupson's reputation
will be made so very “pleasant,” that a remorseful and conscience-
stricken generation will appear by deputy at Albert Gate, to present to
MR. Hudson the keys º the #. of England (of course, upon an
assured understanding that he will then and there return them), and
bearing with them a bunch of silver lilies, typical of his odorous whiteness.
Then will the actions of HUDsoN— - - - - -

even in the gold-dust of the railway unfortunate. For MR. HuDson
has made one “good step forward”—not, the step of St. Denis, cer-
tainly, for that was without his head, which MR. HUDsoN, in his arith-
metic, never lost; whatever other organ was deficient in his cash book
cookery. We have, upon the whole, little doubt that in the year, --,
MR. HUDsoN will turn up like the shield of SCRIBLERUs, polished from
every speck of vulgar debt...The Iron, Crown will duly glisten again.

use it.
“The Decline of England.”
LoRD BRough AM tells us that “an absolute prostration of the under-
standing takes place, in this country, even amongst the bravest men,
whenever the word ‘prince’ is mentioned.” We were not aware of this
debasing fact, but if £ English understanding does become “prostrate”
on such occasions, we can safely answer it can be only amongst “theflats.”
THE SLBTHORP CABINET.
The puzzling question “Who is there to succeed the
Whigs?” was partially answered a few nights ago in
the House of Commons by a little episode, or farce, or
whateverelse it may be called, in which the Lord Mayor
of Dublin and our own gallant Colonel sustained the
two º characters. MR. REYNoLDs, the Irish
Lord Mayor, expressed himself ready to give his support
to “any Government formed by Colonel, SIBThorp,
if the Colonel, on his part, would only promise certain
things with reference to Irish affairs, in return for the
support thus offered him.” Without a moment's hesita-
tion, the gallant Premier in posse rushed across the floor
of the House, and was engaged for a few minutes in
earnest conversation with -
cheers and laughter of all parties.
that the feasibility of the formation of a Sibthorºplax
Cabinet was the ºt of the brief consultation between
the Colonel and his volunteer supporter on the occasion
of the mirth and cheering of the House having been
so vehemently displayed. We can imagine the style
of measure that would be brought in by such a Govern-
ment as that of which Colonel, Sibthorp would form
the head, and we are sure that among the earliest bills
would be one for denouncing, annihilating, and utter
putting an end to what the gallant Premier would
that “monstrous piece of humbug, the Exhibition of
1851.” How far the well-known opinions of the new
Premier may affect the amount of confidence HER
MAJESTY is likely to repose in him, it is not for us to
conjecture.--We suspect, however, the kissing hands on
the occasion of his taking office will not be avery pleasant
operation to the Sovereign.
PARLIAMENTARY Doves.-August is the month when

PANORAMA OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION.
PANQRAMAs are the fashion–LoRD John Russell, with the wisdom
of a Whig, proposes to avail himself of the mode; and during the recess
to superintend a very moving display of his one pet subject—his subject
F. on the floor of the House, on all occasions, namely, the British
onstitution, with the very best Whig designs. The history will begin
with the Death of CHARLEs THE FIRST at St. James's, with a solemn
yiew of the Death-bed of the K. when he hands over the sceptre and
ball to CHARLEs THE SECQND, who thereupon, amidst the acclamations
of a doating people, ascends the Throne. The old superstition as to the
existence of CROMWELL will be treated as a myth; as–see the no Arms
of the Commonwealth in the New Houses of Parliament—it undoubtedly
is: a myth, in which a brief popular effervescence has been ignorantl
yersonified by superstitious historians, as a Brewer, who brought rebel-
ion to a head. The Panorama will give the flight of JAMES THE
SECOND, the Battle of the Boyne, the accession of WILLIAM and MARY,
and so on; the whole to conclude with the advent to office of Lord
John Russell amid a shower of fireworks; with a brilliant display of
coloured lamps in the word—“FINALITY.” -
“England Expects Every Bishop to do his Duty."
THIS is the º signal recently flung out by the improved LoRD
NE1son at the Church conference, that ended in a strong and stern
resolution, unanimously carried, to do nothing. LoRp NELsoN declared
that the bishops must expect to meet persecution, and more: “to return
to the early poverty of the Church 1” After this, his Lordship, in the
§." innocence of his soul, regretted and wondered to see “so few
ishops present.” -
MONSTRUM HORRENDUM.
It is reported in the Paris *. that the Mountain intends coming

A BIT OF MY MI N D.
BIT THE SIXTEENTH.
MRs. MoUSER “cooks.” HER PASSPORT IN ORDER to JOIN MoUSER.
An UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL DELAYS HER DEPARTURE.
Y my last letter,
Mr. Punch, you
will perceive that
I flung down my
pen, and was go-
ing to run to my
wardrobe and my
drawers, deter-
mined to pack up,
and go to Paris
or Brussels—for i
was, as every wife
would be, in suc
a state of almost
frenzy at MR.
MouseR's letter,
—I hadn’t for the
minute , presence
of mind to deter-
mine which.
As I say, there
I was with my
wardrobe open,
and all my draw-
ers pulled out —
and my eye upon
my bonnets—not
- - - knowing how
many gowns to take, and uncertain in my mind whether to go in full
ess, or only to travel quite a fright, the more to punish MoUSER.
There, as I observe, Istood, quite bewildered, with MouseR's letter,
and with all my gowns #. through my head, and not being able to
fix—though I rather inclined to take 'em all, so that when f chose I
might go out like a rainbow-for, after all, as sitting down for a minute,
I said to myself—after all, it’s poor spite to make one’s-self suffer for
the cruel neglect of a husband.
There I was, rummaging about, when what should turn up among my
things, but that scandalous passport, of the wickedness of which you
already know all concerning!, In, a minute—would you believe it? I
was as cold as a stone. If it had been a viper, or a rattle-snake, among
mythings. I do believe I couldn't have shuddered more!"Go to Paris
with that insult about me, I wouldn't; , and then—screwing myself up,
and with a wrench to my feelings which is better felt than described,
and locking my bed-room door at the same time—for you, Sir, who know
everything, know how much safer one is with one's emotions with a
door locked—I looked once more at the passport.
It was a great º: It flashed upon me like a July sunbeam I
may say, I felt inspired with the notion. And it was this.
The French Ambassador—and like his impudence! — had, after
“Agée” put the figure of 5–(and they call themselves a gallant nation)
—with another figure following, which I don't and needn't mention.
Yes, Sir; and now I’ve got over the brutal affront, and can look down
upon it, i don't mind repeating the first figure. was 5, Sir–5!
It’s done in a minute, I thought to myself: so, taking a penknife
...; with the least little scratch in life, and with the
smallest twist of the pen, the 5 stood 3.
If put upon his oath, the Ambassador himself couldn’t have sworn
that it wasn’t his own 3!
Not, that for myself, I cared a straw about it... The Ambassador
might have written a 6, or 7, as well as 5, (and, by the way, one would
have been quite as º as the other—quite) only it was the laugh-I
can fancy it as well as if it were i. in my ears this very minute—
the unfeeling laugh that MoUSER would have had of me. Now with
the 3, I felt more as Iought to do: altogether more comfortable and sure.
Well, Mr. Punch, a little more myself, I'd run the gowns through my
head, and had determined upon my boxes—ſhow, like a pigeon, thought
I to myself, I shall drop down upon MoUSER when he's never expecting
me!)—when, a knock-knock-knock came at the door that went i.;
every artery of my body.
I can't say how it is with other people, but with me there’s a some:
thing in the street-door knocker that never deceives me. Sometimes I
feel it, as if it was a bit of myself.
Well, I looked out of the window, and there were two cabs, at the
door, with luggage on the roof. With the eye of a hawk I looked for
MouseR's carpet-bag; but there was nothing that belonged to MouseR.
Then, remembering the cap I’d on, I drew my head in.
“Marm, Marm,”, cried SysAN in a minute,. rattling, at the door,
“here’s a lot of French officers with their wives, and I don’t know
what; and one Frenchman—as well as I can make him out—with a lot
of silver on his shoulders, says he must see you!”
“It can’t be the Ambassador,” I thought to myself, “come to
apologise.” - - -
“They’re bringing in all their luggage, Marm,” said SUSAN.— .
a saying of
“Then SUSAN,” said I, feeling myself roused, and usi
dear aunt PEAcock's—“then I’m down like a thunderbolt. -
Before a Bird of Paradise could put its feathers straight, I was in my
plum-coloured silk, and rustling my way into the parlour. When I got
there—
Would you think it? Five Frenchmen, with their three wives, and
four children. They all bowed, and curtsied, and begged to embrace
me. At last, putting the dining-table between us—(I’d sent, hurried
as I was, sent for Mrs. HoRNBLower, as she speaks French better
than I)—I begged to ask, putting the question somehow with my
fingers, what they did me the honour to want. Whereupon, one of the
Frenchmen, a private National Guard, as I now know, with his hand
upon his heart, and his §. upon the ceiling, gave me a letter. The
hand-writing shot right through me; for at a glance I knew it was
MoUSER's. And this it was:–
“My dearest AMELIA, “Paris, Cafè des Maris Inconsolables.
“The cab is at the door that is to take me to the train to Brussels.
However, I must snatch a few minutes to send this letter by the hand
of Mons. MIGNONETTE, who, with his wife, a dear little woman’—
(She was drest in red and amber like a balloon, and had already dropt
in my chair, as if the house belonged to her! #owever, to go on.)
A little woman, who has been cery, very civil indeed to me, a stranger
and a foreigner in this wearisome city. Mons. MIGNONETTE is a soldier,
and, with some thousand of his countrymen, proposes to visit London—to
make a fraternal risit. You, my lore, as a true daughter of John BULL,
as it is my boast to know you, will I am sure, hold forth the right hand of
fellowship, and throw open your doors in the true spirit of English hospi:
tality. T'need say no more. MADAME MIGNONETTE will tell you how I
hare longed to return; and I daresay will make you smile at the expense
of your foolish home-sick husband. She is such a timid creature—too full
of sensibility to smuggle—or I would hare troubled her to bring a reil for
you. But, my lore, this pleasure I reserve for myself; and waiting that
delight, I am, “As ever, your own Affectionate Husband,
“JoHN MoUSER.”
P.S. I shall be very unhappy and very angry if I don't find a letter
from my AMELLA, at the Post-Office, Brussels.
Well, by the time I had read this, MADAME MIGNONETTE had thrown
off her shawl and bonnet, had taken off her three children's things;
whilst all the other Frenchmen and their two wives had done the same
and more than that, in a minute, MADAME MIGNONETTE jumped up and
§º her hands, and frisking upon her toes, declared that MoUSER-
for though I don’t speak French, can understand every word that’s
said—that MoUSER was a “charming man,” and “an angel,” and I don’t
know what besides—quite enough to make a wife's blood boil; however
I only smiled, as I can smile when I choose, and with a curtsey left the
room, for I heard MRs. HoRNBLoweR.
My first determination, as I told her, was to make an apology to the
MIGNONETTEs, and to tell 'em I was going to France; but MRS. HoRN-
BLower—(poor thing ! she has her own troubles!)—a little over-ruled
męż, and went tº the parlºur: - -
“I suppose, Marm,” said SUSAN, looking at me like a ghost,” I sup-
pose, Marm, they won't want any dinner?”
Dinner! And no doubt MouséR thinks that out of my weekly money
I am to lodge and board all the National Guards, besides all the national
wives and national children of Paris. ... Dinner,” said I, “why it’s
impossible! How can so many people think of dinner.”
d after a little while MRs. HoRNBLow ER came back, and—(after all,
she’s a clever creature!)—and said that as MoUSERwastaking his pleasure
in Brussels, why shouldn't I enjoy myself in London P ... She said that
when you know her, MADAME MIGNONETTE was really a delightful
woman; and that her brother, Mons. LA Nose (the handsome fair man
—an officer with silver epaulets) quite a specimen of the gentleman.
To be short, after a struggle, I thought it best to get an early dinner
and then—as MouseR was enjoying himself, and as it was only right f
should show myself a hospitable Englishwoman—go and take the
French to see the hippopotamus. Which determining,
I am your's, in better spirits, AMELLA MoUSER.
P.S. MRs. HoRNBLoweR has desired me—for something HoRN-
BLow ER has said, must be annoying her—to ask you, Mr. Punch, if a
marriage can be a lawful binding marriage for life, if the ceremony's
gone through by only one clergyman? as H. (she is so nervous j
says she has her doubts; or why should we now see so often that folks
are married “by the REv. MR. MATTHEw,” assisted by the “Rev. M.R.
LUKE?” What, in the holy state, is meant by assistance?. Are
people harder to be brought together in high life t common folks,
that it is necessary to have two clergymen to bind 'em. For my part
—as I tell MRs. HoRNRLoweR-with regard to the marriage claim, she
needn't have any doubts; for I’m sure of it, one clergyman will
strike the rivets quite as firm as fifty.

BARON ROTHSCHILD ON A WHEELBARROW.
MARTIN LUTHER says of the Jews—“They sit as on a wheelbarrow,
without a country, a people, or government.” This was said three
hundred and fifty years ago; and the Jewis on the wheelbarrow still.
At this moment he sits at the steps of the House of Commons, True
isit, he has been promised rest; has been wheeled hither and thither;
but as yet he has not been shot into a fixed seat. He is still-unhappy
moveable!—squat and expectant on his barrow; still may he not stretch
his legs and, taking his ease, sit down. -
Since February as the wheelbarrow of Rothschi LD–with Roths-
CHILD onit-stopt the way: And Rothschild, meek as one of HERod's
babies, looked for his friend and compeer, the Christian Lond JoHN, to
wheel him into the House of Commons, and hand him into his seat.
Months and months passed on; and Rothschild, still upon his barrow
—like a Chaldean Shepherd, enquiringly, yet patiently, tried to read his
fortune in the stars. And still Rothschild sat upon the barrow; and
still no Russell came.
But patience—even Hebrew patience—waxed warm; and Rothschild
cried out with a loud voice from his barrow—“Hoy! Halloo! Here, ye
knowing ones of the City! See that, as Loºp John fails to take me
up—see that I am straightway wheeled into the Parliament House, that
I may get off this accursed barrow, and, like a gentleman of the Hebrew
persuasion, sit-down.” -
Whereu Rothschild, on his barrow, was straightway wheeled
into the House of Commons, and straightway—wheeled out again!
And then Christian gentlemen delivered themselves of thoughts, pro-
found and various, of the qualities of a House of Commons oath.
What was the breadth of a vow—the depth of a vow? And there was
vast learning, curious subtlety, manifested as regarded vows. There
were intellectual Magi, who would weigh you the precise weight of a
vow, even to a scruple. Moral geometricians who would give you the
superficial inches of a vow, even refining to a line.
And Rothschi Lp, seated upon his barrow, said to himself—“Of a
verity, here are, Christian gentlemen dealing with an oath, even as
certain of the fallen of my race in the Minories, in Houndsditch, or in
Field-Lane, have dealt with pewter shillings and brass sovereigns;
silvering and gilding with an outside show, to make the counterfeit pass
for the true thing. On the faith of a Hebrew,”—said Rothschild on
the barrow—“this is a melancholy matter.”
Nevertheless, it must have been a balsamic comfort to Rothschild,
still on his barrow, to know that LoRD John Russell talked so sweetl
of the British Constitution; proving it to be good and sufficient for a
men in all cases. “Fling a man into the Thames,” said LoRD John,
with his eye upon his red box, “and if he devoutly believes in the
British Constitution, he will not sink! If your house is in flames, only
read Magna Charta, with a believing faith, and there will be no need of
a fire-engine—for of itself the conflagration will go out. I boldly avow,
Sir,”—said LoRD John—“that the Act of Settlement, properly applied,
is a specific for the tooth-ache—and, with respect to the case of BARon
Rothschild, that an operative faithin the necessity of the Whigs will
fully meet every condition of the question. Ishall not shrink from my
duty at the propertime; and most certainly not because odium may be
attached to it; for I am not backward to confess, that I rather admire
odium. Like a pickle, a little odium gives zest and flavour to minis-
terial life. Odium, Sir, I consider as the * onion to the official
loaves—the soy, anchovy, and cayenne to the Cabinet fishes.”
Meanwhile BARon Rothschild still sat upon his barrow; and friends
gathered about him, and told him that as there was no helpfor him from
LoRD John, there he must still sit. Which Rothschild mightily
lamented; because in him were the hopes, the amended prospects of
|Young Israel! For whereas, hard-bosomed man had flung it in the
teeth of the Hebrew that, as with a foul instinct he had sought to fill
ºdirtiest º º: ºłº # the º moisome
ings—and at the great -Fair of Trick, and Usury, and Chicane,—
had ever pitched his Marine Store Booth to turn the nasty penny—
whereas, such reproaches had been made, and the Baron lamenting
them, hoped that with his removal from the barrow, the people would
find a resting-place, and thereupon eschew foul employments, and pull
down the Booth of Dirty Pennies, whereas the Baron hungered for
this goodly day, and the day by LaRD John was deferred, the Baron
was rightfully wrath with his Guildhall companion, and cried, “Woe is
me! that I must still sit upon the barrow !”
And INGL1s and NEwbegATE, and also SpooxER, laid their heads
together; and swore that, with their consent, BARON Rothschild
should never leave the wheelbarrow. “A wheelbarrow was the destiny
#." ..and his people; and the Baron should never come down
Thereupon, some one said, it would be a goodthing if the wheelbarrow
could be straightway wheeled to Jerusalem, and them and there emptied.
And another clapped his hands, and took his hat, and said he would
instantly go to Exeter Hall, and therefrom issue a Proclamation, calling
º all men to gather together, and not to remove the Jew from the
w ºrrow, but to remove the wheelbarrow itself with the Jew
upon it!
But this may not be. No. Rothschnip must come off the wheel-
barrow. Rothschild must take his seat in the House of Commons.
The Marine Store Booth shall be struck: and Young Israel, freed from
his civil disabilities, will also be freed from his unseemly yearnings.
Yes: with Young Israel represented in Parliament, will not You
Israel be a gentle, urbane, and most conscientious presence in the City:
For the present, however, the BARon De Rothschild—(let him thank
the Prime Minister for it,) must remain where he is; and, perhaps, in
1851, LoRD John Russell will then stretch forth his statesman
to help the Jew off the wheelbarrow.
A Poet's Idea of the Submarine Telegraph.
ONE of our poets, who has been rather slack of work º and
whose eye has . rolling in a fine frenzy to º, little purpose for the
last fortnight, has furnished us with an idea on the subject of the sub-
marine telegraph. He says “it is like using the lightning conductor
for a steel pen, and the ocean for an ink-stand.” He might have added
that the cliffs furnish the blotting pad, the shore supplies the sand, an
the whole world the sheet of paper to write upon.
THE TRUTH WILL OUT.
A SABBATARIAN being requested a day or two since to do what he
could to get the Post-Office re-opened for Sunday delivery of letters
made the following reply:-"I have questioned my conscience, and i
really find I cant.”

ELECTIVE AND COLLECTIVE WISDOM.
--S WE can scarcely be surprised at the somewhat
inferior quality of the collective wisdom, when we
find the elective wisdom to consist of such materials
as the Lambeth constituency has just given us a
sample of . In looking over the report of the pro-
ceedings at the nomination that has lately taken
place, we scarcely know which to hold in greater
contempt—the speeches addressed to the electors,
or the remarks they elicited : we are really unable
to decide which is the greater trash, the poorer
stuff, the more downright rubbish—the text or the
comment.
The first step in the way of appeal to the un-
derstanding of the constituency, was the hoisting
of a great flaunting Union Jack, and the first
argument on the side of the electors was a volley
of abuse, under which the Union Jack was hurried
out of sight again. We pass over the speech pro-
posing the successful candidate, for nothing was, in
fact, said, and nothing becomes positive wisdom in comparison with what
was really uttered. The plea on which MR. RAIMER was put forward, was
the fact of his being the son of his father, which was met by the ordinary
election argument of “Oh!”; and though an O means nothing, we can
Scarcely find fault so far with the reply of the constituents to what had
been addressed to them.
The proposal of SIR CHARLEs NAPTER, however, it was that elicited
all the strength of reasoning on one side, and all the power of refuta-
tion on the other. The mere mention of the candidate's name was the
º for a truly electoral clincher, in the shape of “Groans, and cries
of “We won’t have him I’” which was certainly conclusive, if not
altogether so logical as a schoolman might have desired.
e now come to the speeches of the candidates themselves, and
MR. WILLIAMs being the favourite, we shall find it unnecessary to
allude much to his remarks, which were of the customary common-place
kind, and were responded to by the usual ious shouts of “So we
will,” “Bravo Wri.LIAMs,” “Give it to Old CHARLEy,” “Stick to him,”
“Do you hear that old chapf’’ “Sack him altogether,” and other similar
specimens of the intellectuality and liberality of a large metropolitan
constituency. MR. PALMER next came forward, with , the wise
suggestion, that as he had done nothing, no fault could be found with
him; but he urged his claims by virtue of an alleged “connection with
the borough,” which might have been just as urged by any other
gentleman º to occupy a lodging in Lambeth. This candidate,
on the strength of a probable first or second floor, was met by what the
enlightened electors themselves would have º termed a
floorer, in the shape of a flat assertion of “We won’t have you.” Poor
MR. PALMER then ventured to hint his claims as a working man, earning
his bread by his profession; but a vigorous shout of “Gammon, MR.
PALMER,” convinced him at once, that however he might get his bread,
the Lambeth voters would supply no butter. The remainder of the
candidate's speech elicited a roaring accompaniment of “That won't
do,” “Oh, hold your tongue,” cries of “Stuff.” “That'll do,” and a
variety of very intelligible, but not particularly intelligent comments.
The coming forth of SIR. C. NAPIER was the signal for the putting
forth of all the powers of the constituency, and as he was the candidate
they most wished to defeat, we have a right to take their observations
on his speech, as containing the very concentration of all the argumenta-
tive force of which the voters could avail themselves. His very
appearance was greeted by a sort of preliminary objection to any thing
he might have to urge, and an enormous cat-o'-nine-tails was shaken
about as an embodiment, no doubt, of at least nine points of the argu;
ment to be urged against his election. As soon as the gallant Admiral
was permitted to open his mouth, he commenced by addressing to his
audience a piece of reasoning quite worthy of their capacity, for he told
them that though a sailor ought to represent a sea-port, yet as the
Thames washed one side of Lambeth, Lambeth might be regarded as
pro tanto, a sea-port, and therefore an Admiral was a fit person to be
entrusted with its interests.
If we were in the House of Commons, and were allowed to make
venerable attempts at effete wit, we should compare this to the old case
of Goodwin Sands and Tenterden Steeple, but as our readers are not
used to such treatment, we beg leave to withdraw the offensive para-
graph; The rest of the speech was interlarded with “Groans,” cries of
“Go home,” and the brandishing of a great cat in the candidate's face,
by an agent of the most liberal of the liberal candidates. A slight allusion
to financial matters extracted from the crowd the off-hand shout of
“Oh hang the national debt; ” and after a few more specimens of the
trenchant style of disposing of great questions, the Admiral retired amid
a shower of “We . want you's,” “We wont have you’s,” and a
miscellaneous collection of liberal epithets. -
We really cannot help feeling rather humiliated at such disgraceful
stuff as this forming, as it almost always does, the staple of the report
of any election proceedings, where the suffrages of a large and liberal
constituency are solicited. We do not quarrel with the result in a
political sense, but the empty, senseless, and almost brutal character of
the preliminaries may fairly furnish a handle to the opponents of an
extension of the suffrage, while superior men, who wou #. be
proud of representing large constituencies, naturally shrink from such a
contemptible ordeal as it seems every one must go through before he
can obtain a seat for any numerically * town or borough. In
.*. but their barbarous violence, the old Covent Garden days of
dead dogs and cabbage stalks seem to survive at our metropolitan
elections, and the brutal brandishing of cats in the face of one of the
candidates, would seem to show that if the scene was prolonged as it
used to be, there would be found quite as much ruffianism, and quite as
little intelligence, as ever, disgraced the mobs, when SIR MURRAY
MAXWELL had his eye knocked out, and Orator HENRY HUNT, having
been proposed by a chimney-sweep, and seconded by a costermonger,
gloried in the existence of “two honest men” in Westminster.
THE WHITEBAIT'S INVITATION TO THE MINISTERS.
“CoME away, come away, ye merry men all,”
Sang voices from under old Thames's flood;
And it was the song of the Whitebait small,
As soft and as clear as their native mud: !
“Come away LoRD JoHN RUSSELL,
A truce to bother and bustle:
Come my lads, take your pleasure,
Give up motion measure,
Cut contest and struggle and tussle.
“Bring your barren toil to a close at last,
For swiftly the hours of the season fly;
If you wait tillanother bill |. ’ve past,
e are sure that we shall not be fit to fry:
Try no further to budge on;
We’re nearly as big as gudgeon;
We are getting irate,
And if longer you wait,
We shall stick in your weasands, in dudgeon.
“In the goblet of punch all memory drown
Of blunder, disaster, defeat, disgrace;
And wash it with us in a bumper down,
Rejoicing to feel you are | in place:
your whitebait in utter
Content, with brown bread and butter;
Ön which side of your bread
*Tother substance is spread
You’re aware—so at least some folks mutter.”
SALE OF ENCUMBERED ESTATES.
SINCE we read so much about the Sale of Encumbered Estates, we
wonder that a particularly encumbered estate in the centre of London
has never been put up to auction. We allude to Leicester Square,
which has the strongest claims upon the Commission in question; for
we are sure that, in all our miserable experience, which includes Ireland,
of course, we have never witnessed an estate that was more painfully
encumbered than the one situate in Leicester Square. The encum-
brances consist of numerous mounds of deceased dogs and cats, small
hills of oyster shells, and large mountains of animal matter. We would
recommend the Sanitary Commission to take a stroll, on some sultry
afternoon, through that little hotbed of corruption: for really, in these
days of Reform, it is like retaining a rotten borough in the very heart
of the Metropolis. It is an evil which is most offensive to the common
sense—or scents, rather—of the public; and the sooner it is sold, swept,
and carted away, the better.
Abolition of Offices.
AMONG the offices recommended for abolition by the Committee on
Official Salaries, is that of Lord Privy Seal. This mode of dealing with
the Seal, proves that the Committee have been upon the watch for
economy. We have not heard whether the Seal will at once surrender
the key of office, or whether it is to be simply understood that the die
of the Seal is cast as to any future vacancy.
A BAD ARTICLE.—There are two Houses of Commons at present,
but the new House is called, par ercellence, “The House,” from the
simple fact of every one being “deaf-in-it.”

GRAND SCRAMBLE OF DIAMONDS PREVIOUS TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE NEPAULESE AMBASSADOR.
“LADY Rouge Lion presents her compliments to Mr. Punch.
“LADY R. having heard that it is the intention of the dear Nepaulese
Ambassador at ...i. party of the season (ere he leaves for his native
mountains, the home of the bulbul and the gazelle) to make a delicious
demonstration, begs that Mr. Punch, as knowing all things, will favour

MASTER JOHNNY’S HOLIDAY LETTER.
“Downing Street Classical and Commercial Academy, August 13th, 1851.
“MY DEAR GUARDIAN, MR. PUNCH,
“Now the holidays are approaching, I take up my pen to write
you an account of the way in which I have been pursuing my studies,
and have been going on and conducting myself generally #. ś 3.
“I am very sorry indeed to be compelled to inform you that I have
made very little improvement, and I am afraid that you and all my
friends will be extremely dissatisfied with my progress. |
“In my Algebra I have remained quite stationary, owing to uny want
of zeal and diligence, which has prevented me from using the application
requisite to enable me to understand the Representation of Numbers.
Accordingly, I have made no attempt, I am ashamed to say, to solve
that problem, which you are so anxious to have settled, of the enlarge-
ment of the Šuffrage. - -
“With regard to my Classics, all I have to mentionis, that in common
with the rest of the Class, I have had much difficulty with my Greek;
but we flatter ourselves that we got out of that nicely.
“My Arithmetic has ğ. me some trouble, and would have given
me more if I had attended to it much, instead of neglecting it greatly.
With the kind assistance of my schoolfellow Wood, .# have
got over one little sum in subtraction, having taken the duty on bricks
from the amount of taxation. I had also the Window-Tax, and the
taxes on Paper and News, set me to subtract; but I couldn't do
either of these sums; I fear you will say, because I did not try. On
the other hand, I have done a very heavy sum in compound addition,
which came to £12,000. This was not a regular task; but I cannot
say that I did it of my own accord; and, to confess the truth, it was
an imposition.
“I have been very frequently punished—although not so often as I
know I deserved. I have had several floggings, both in this House and
the other; and I hope the correction I have received, will do me good,
and cause me to be a better boy, and to mind what is said to me.
*I have not behaved at all well to the new boy that you recommended
some time ago, NATHAN. I have neglected to introduce him to the
other boys; and when he tried to mix with them of himself, I stopped
him, and have put him off for another half year.
“With a deep sense of my remissness, I acknowledge that when a
small number of meddlesome Puritanical boys shut up the Post Office
on Sunday, I stood by, and did not exert myself to prevent them, as I
might have done.
“To make amends for my deficiencies in other respects, I have
endeavoured to distinguish myself in Elocution; but as I am aware
that you think nothing of mere talking, I shall say no more about that.
“Begging you to accept my duty and respect, and to present the
same to my indulgent friend and patron, MR. BULL, and hoping next
half year to turn over a new leaf, and behave in a way more deserving
your approbation, believe me, my dear guardian,
“Your dutiful Ward, John Russell.”
“P.S...My holiday task is a question in Cyphering, ‘To adjust the
Income, Tax according to the Rule of Proportion.” § is very hº
and will keep me in and make my head ache; and I hope you wi
intercede, and get me excused from doing it.” -
SHAMEFUL ROBBERY COMMITTED ON MR. WASHINGTON, IRWING.

;
GENTILEMEN'S FASHIONS FOR THE SEA-SIDE.
THERE are fashions for the Sea-side just in the same way as there are
fashions for the Opera, or for a wedding, or for a morning concert, or
for an evening party. These fashions are so broadly marked, that they
would produce the greatest consternation if worn anywhere else but at
the sea-side. A gentleman in sea-side costume, if seen walking down
Fleet Street, *i. be followed by a ragged regiment of little boys, and
saluted by the cads and conductors of every passing omnibus.
These fashions are distinguished by a kind of easy laissez aller
maritime freedom and elegance. The trousers are ample, and flap about
like the sails of a ship. Straps are discarded. . The chaussure is of a
slipper kind, so slippery that not unfrequently a shoe is left behind the
owner, imbedded in the sand. The fashionable colour is a buff, a colour
which causes the owner to be facetiously hailed by his acquaintance by
the name of buffer." -
Chapeaur are rarely seen in the mafinée. A straw hat of a nautical
shape and height, is the general ornament for the head. It is set off by
a black-band and under-lining, and, in windy weather, is fastened to the
right button-hole by a piece of green string. -
'he ties are also as free and as open as the sea. The throat is
à moitid découvert, after the fashion of Hilliam, in Black-eyed Susan.
They are fastened in a loose knot, and the ends are allowed to coquet
(French style) with the idle breeze. -
The shirts are very much after the counting-house ledger style. If
not ruled in red lines, they are in blue. The collars are large, and hang
down on the side à la - º
Waistcoats are not generally worn. The same remark applies to
braces; or, if these latter are indulged in, they should be of a highly
floral decorative pattern, such as are exhibited for sale in the Burlington
*...* but of course they must have been worked by the hand of
ve.
Coats are cut after the celebrated military shell-jacket pattern; that
is to say, without tails. They are like the coats worn by the garºons in
the French cafés, but of course, without the .*.*.
We have seen some of a hight, grey, Portland stone couleur, but they
are too much a la mode of the footman in undress livery, and do not
look well, excepting on the back of a bold ferocious foreigner. -
Walking sticks are vulgar. The prevailing substitute is a light
telescope, sometimes fancifully slung round the neck by a black ribbon,
sometimes playfully dangled in the main droite.
No gloves. - -
The walk must be of that quick, independent, * step, the
peculiar gift, of a captain walking his deck. The whole demeanour
seasoned with a dash of the salt which is found in the ocean.
The evening dress for the parade or the library is a frock-coat, of a
colour not too gay, not too sombre, but a soft medium between the
two, like an autumnal twilight. Trousers of a summer complexion, and
a well-assorted waistcoat, to keep them in a contented countenance.
Hat à la Kensington Gardens; and a pair of polished boots, not too
young, not too aged. We have known a. }. sensation created by
the tasteful addition of a pair of yellow, kid gloves; but gloves of some
sort (excepting always, Berlin) must be worn. Light Regent Street
cane, with just a few drops of jewellery. General demeanour, gentle
and vacant, that of the Hyde Park flaneur. A Gibus under the arm
combined with the sleepy insouciance of the Opera crush-room, and
freshly-curled hair, produces so prodigious an effect, that perhaps it
º be wise not to repeat it in the same place more than twice.
FREE DISCUSSION IN FRANCE.
THE other day, during one of the debates in the French assembly,
the members had been amusing themselves and abusing each other in
the usual form, when the President, after vainly trying to obtain order,
expressed his “wish that he had the Tower of }. at his disposal,”
for if he had, “he would freely use it.” This little fact is one of a
series of every day occurrence, all tending to illustrate the sort of
freedom of discussion that prevails in France, where even the members
of the Legislature are threatened with a state prison if they don’t know
how to behave themselves. Everything may be very free just now
among our neighbours the French, but it is certainly much more free
than welcome to the great majority amongst them.
We are certainly without the boasted liberty of a republic in this
country, and we trust we may long continue so, when we find the fruits
of republican liberty to consist in laws against the press, restrictions on
the expression of opinion in any and every form, amounting to no less
than a menace of imprisonment to such members of the Legislature as
do not exactly conform to the notions of the President. ... We presume
that under a republic we should be having the Speaker of the House of
Commons regretting he had not a Bastile at hand as a safe deposito
for some of the members, but intimating that Brixton is not far off, *
that they had better behave themselves.
OH WHERE, AND OH WHERE, IS THE AGED
TORTOISE GONEP
We have as yet seen no announcement of the appearance in public of
the venerable tortoise who, it was expected, was about to make his
first appearance these hundred and ninety years in the Gardens of the
Zoological Society.
We cannot understand why the début of this distinguished animal
has been delayed, unless it has been for the purpose of preventing any
interference with the “run” of the hippopotamus. e suspect that
the friends of the tortoise may have had something to do with the post-
onement; for the new candidate for public favour would in all proba-
ility be voted rather “slow ’’ in a race with the sea-horse for the prize
of public favour. Perhaps the tortoise may have not been able to come
to terms, about a sufficiently permanent engagement to suit its very
longevital merit; for when we recollect that it is at present compara-
tively but “a young thing,” though 190 years old, we cannot be sur-
prised at its being anxious to make hay while the sun shines, and to
secure in the days of its youth, the means of retreat for an old age that
promises to be rather durable.
We have not yet heard whether the day is fixed for the tortoise to
come out; but as two attractions can scarcely ever command success
at the same time, we should recommend either that the hippopotamus
should accept some provincial engagement, or that the tortoise should
go through a round of his performances in the country, previous to his
#: §º º ience. We ". heard º* ".
ifficulty in getting the hippopotamus, who is a go puried up
with popular applause—to . the “business” with the new comer,
who, on his part refuses flatly to appear as a sort of walking gentleman,
while the hippopotamus is doing all the light eccentric comedy of the
Regent's Park establishment.
THE FRENCH INWASION.
THE words “French Invasion,” used to be a bugbear, or rather a flea
in English ears, but we may now fairly say that the Invasion of England
by the French, has taken place under circumstances which the most
tº of British bosoms would not rebel against. The invasion
may, in fact, be considered to be going on from week to week, though
one of the most dreaded instances happened a few days ago, when the
coast was invaded by no less than fourteen hundred French, who poured
into the Folkestone Hailway Station, overrun the whole of the carriages,
and placed under contribution to their service the whole resources of the
South Eastern Company. On the arrival of the invading party at the
London Bridge Terminus, they deluged the platform, inundated the
cab stand, overflowed the omnibuses, and pressed into their service
everything in the shape of a vehicle that was available. “The porters
fled,” not “for safety and for succour,” but for a fresh supply of cabs,
flies, and busses.
The invaders penetrated into the western portion of the city, and
taking up, their quarters in the vicinity of Leicester Square, soon ex-
hausted all the provisions of the frugully supplied inhabitants. Famine
was rapidly setting in, when the timely aid of neighbouring butchers and
a friendly understanding with some outlying bakers, supplied the ga
that had been caused by the demands of the French incursionists. }
must be said to the credit of the invading party, that they honourably
paid for everything they took from the ºilºt.
Over Speculation.
THERE is some talk of erecting a building over Waterloo Bridge, but
we fear if the proprietors should succeed in covering their bridge, they
will never cover their expenses. The projectors taſk largely of profit,
but the scheme savours strongly of building castles in the air, which the
proposed pile will much resemble if it is ever thrown acrºss the river.
The object is to furnish a very large room for the sale of fancy articles,
and we presume for the payment of fancy or imaginary dividends. We
wish success to any scheme the unfortunate proprietors may carry out
for the recovery of their lost funds, and we only hope they may find
their room more profitable than their company.
THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE.
HITHERTO, Members of Parliament have been accustomed to take
the oaths and their seats: the former before the latter. But now that
the space allotted to each Member is so tight a ſit, being from 16 to 20
inches each Member, you will have hon. gentlemen—if moderately stout
—taking their seats first and swearing afterwards.
IT IS THE CAUSE. IT IS THE CAUSE.
MANY persons are continually asking the cause why there is absolutely
nothing .." in railways. Our answer is that is impossible there can
be anything doing when everybody has been done.

OUR FRIEND BRIGGS CONTEMPLATES A DAY'S FISHING.
HE Is HERE supposed To BE GETTING HIS TACKLE IN oRDER, AND TRYING THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS RUNNING LINE.
DOWN GO THE BRIDGES, OH !
WE, begin to feel that epidemics affect not only the animal and
vegetable world, but that inanimate objects are liable to diseases of a
catching character. . The London clocks have had their period, of
derangement, and it has been a shocking time, or no time at all, with a
reat many of them; but just now it seems to be the turn of the
šºn Bridges to suffer from an incurable malady. . Poor old
Westminster has been the first to give way, and it is now said that, its
neighbour Blackfriars is in a feeble and .."; condition. Waterloo,
being younger and stronger in constitution, has apparently escaped,
and #. rford, though in a state of much, suspense, not yet been
visited; but Blackfriars is said to be in such a state, that it will not be
able to keep up without the aid of doctoring. We hope that the
disease will be met by professional skill at once, and not by mere
quackery, which prescribes a sort of homoeopathic treatment in, the
º of an infinity of small and extravagant, because ineffectual,
repairs, when vigorous measures applied at once would restore strength
to the patient at a moderate outlay. Poor Westminster has been so
††and plastered, and has had so many operations performed, that
it is now scarcely able to hold together; and there has been such, a
eneral break up, that people are *. to think it had better be
f. in for the remainder of its . until it sinks exhausted into
the bed that old Father Thames always keeps at its disposal.
Parliamentary Agitation.
LEGISLATION has often been impeded by the unseemly heat of debate,
and the consequent loss of temper of the different and indifferent
Members of Parliament. We regret to say that, t are not likely
to be mended when the sittings are regularly held in the new palace at
Westminster; for as the Lower Assembly is only calculated to hold
something over four hundred persons, while the number of members
exceeds five hundred, we have reluctantly brought ourselves to the
melancholy conclusion that the House of Commoºs will never be able
to contain itself.
THE CAMBRIDGE MONUMENT.
SURELY we have voted a most magnificent monument to the glory of
the late DUKE of CAMBRIDGE. Do we not give his son (whose latent
É. has already broken out into an eruption of equerries and chap-
ains) the trifling amount of £12,000 per annum ? A pretty golden
monument! Say that the present gorgeous young Duke shall live fifty
years to bless the Exchequer. Fifty times twelve thousand pounds.
12.000
wº
£600,000
Imagine six hundred thousand piled sovereigns; and say, is it not a
most portentous pile of gold—a column of monumental significance,
when it is considered to whom it is raised, and from whose pockets it
is obtained? To be sure this is not a voluntary tribute. This is a
monument erected by the House of Commons—and not by the people.
They are only compelled to find the material that shall make it.
The late DUKE of CAMBRIDGE is, however, to have another monu-
ment, raised by voluntary means. So be it. Loan Grosvenon moves
a resolution, which avows of the late Duke that “his whole life and
fortune were devoted to the protection and affectionate cure of the sick
and afflicted.” Is it really so? A whole life and fortune?. This is a
deep, a touching claim upon the gratitude of mankind. Why was not
the Noble Lord armed with something like a balance-sheet in pleasin
corroboration of his large avowal? As another meeting is to be hel
we may yet hope to hear of such a document. Anyway, we would
suggest a cheap and ready mode of doing monumental honour to the
memory of CAMBRIDGE: . It is jº. this. Let his statue take the
F. at present held by his brother York in Waterloo Place. It would
a fine double touch of justice to remove from the pillar the bronze of
a Duke who never paid his debts, in order to place in his stead the
statue of his brother Duke, who upon the sick and suffering lavished,

PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE SCIENCE OF THINGS
FAMILLAR.
THE REv. DR. BREWER—who evidently does nothing by half-and-
half—has lately published a very useful little work, asking in a familiar
way some thousands of very familiar questions, and answering them in
a very pleasant, though rather roundabout manner. Among other things
he asks, “Why do you black-lead a flue?” and though we should have
thought it was in order to give the flue a polish, DR. BREWER tells us
we do so “in order that the heat of the flue may be more readily
diffused about the room; because black lead radiates heat more freely
than any other substance.”. We are then asked, “Why does a sauce-
pan that has been used, boil in a shorter time than a new one?” Our
answer would have been, “Because the old un’s used to it; * but the
doctor tells us in much finer phraseology, º perhaps coming to the
same thing, that it is “because the bottom an
soot, and the black soot rapidly absorbs the heat of the glowing coals.”
It is as well to know this, no doubt; and it is at all events consoling to
those who have got an old saucepan, and can’t afford a new one, to be
assured by a man of science that they are better off than the possessor
of a more expensive article. There are a few of the Doctor's Why’s,
which we should look at as rather otherwise, and there are many pro-
positions he seems to take for granted, upon which we should be com-
pelled to join the dissenting party. for instance, he asks, “Why do
we feel a desire for activity in cold weather,” and he then explains the
alleged fact by saying, something about, “fanning combustion in the
blood,” when the truth is, we feel no desire for activity, but rather a
desire to sit cosily over the fire in cold weather; and as to º; our
blood, we emphatically declare we might be blowed if we should
e it.
There are a few questions on things familiar, which we have been in
the habit of answering for ourselves in a style with which the worthy
Doctor would not at all sympathise... We, however, take leave to add a
few specimens, which will show that if our guide to the scientific
knowledge of things familiar is not always strictly correct in a philo-
sophical H. of view, it is never disagreeable.
Q: Why does lightning turn milk and beer sour?
# . the º: #. º: º to conduct itself, .
perhaps, use on the principle of two of a trade never agreeing, the
º: fluid and the i. or beery fluid cannot come into contact
without the two latter getting soured by the former.
Q. Why is mortar adhesive?
. A. Because it is of a confiding nature, and imagining that every object
is a brick, it will attach itself to anything.
Q: Why ought potatoes to be boiled in their skins?
A. Because no potato can be said to be properly dressed unless it
appears in a jacket.
Q. Why does a kettle sing?
ut §: the same! reason that a ploughboy whistles—for want of
Ought.
Q. Why does a cat run after a mouse?
4. Because the mouse runs away from the cat.
Q. Why is it necessary to cut the grass?
A. Because the grass, though composed of nothing but blades, has
not one sharp enough to cut away itself, and prevent the necessity of
the scythe being applied to it.
... We might go on multiplying these questions on any fine day, ad
in-fine-night-um, but we have no doubt the reader may suggest them for
himself, and exert his scientific powers in finding the best solution he
can of such difficulties, as his own inventive faculties may present to
him. We all delight in home-made articles, and we, therefore, leave the
reader to enjoy the cracking of a few nuts of his own growing.
CAN ANYTHING BE MORE INTOLERABLEP
AN American author (DR. HowARD) tells us most sºriously in his
book, which rejoices in being Revelations of Egyptian teries, that
earthquakes in cities are owing to the exertions made by the over-
loaded earth to get rid of the “intolerable weight of ºf. We
doubt this Yankee theory very much, because, if it were true, Trafalgar
Square would be in a constant state of earthquakism. More than this,
not a º would pass during the Session, without an earthquake
bringing forward a motion for an º which would have the
effect, of making the House instantly break up; and we must say,
considering the Sunday Postage question, the Jewish Oath discussion,
the Cambridge Pension, and other jobs, combined with the little busi-
ness done this year, that no building with the tremendous weight which
we all know exists in the House of Commons, has lately proved itself
more “intolerable,” and consequently more deserving of the honour of
an earthquake. e almost regret that DR. HowARD's theory is not
based upon better grounds, but perhaps the English people may take
the earthquake into its own, hands, and, by a strong “pressure from
without,” send this most intolerable building to the right about.

GLASS HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
PUNCH to Joseph PAxton, Esq.
DEAR MR. PAxton,
You can, at a word, relieve the country from all further
suspense in the important matter of lodging, the collective wisdom of
º known by a flattering, legendary fiction, to mean the members
of both Houses of Parliament ºf is now clear that Mr. Barry will
never finish his structure. Two millions of money are already doomed
to stone, bricks, and mortar; two millions upon an uncertain, unsatis-
factory pile. And as it is now high tragic time that we should really
think, of housing Lords and Commons, quickly, cheaply, and commo-
diously—we ask of you, at once and forthwith, to erect for them—two
Glass Houses of Parliament.
Sir, you can do it in a morning. You have only to don your working
coat; to clap on your considering cap—that pretty, tasteful thing, bent
from a leaf of the Pictoria Regia, and the matter is done. There; 3rawn,
made manifest, plain to even the lowest capacity of even the Houses
of Lords or Commons, is a perfect plan of the structure; a crystal
senate-house, fit council-place for human senatorial chrysolites. While we
write, the fº proclaim the progress of HER MAJESTY, on her way to
prorogue the Parliament. Say the word, MR. PAxton, shall the QUEEN,
next February, open the new Houses of Glass? Älſ we want is your
romise. For, as the princely DEvoNSHIRE bears honourable, and
ionouring testimony—“MR., PAxton has never attempted anything,
which he has not succeeded in fully carrying out.” §. with your
promise given, MR. BARRY may be required to adapt his structure to
the future wants of the PRINCE or WALEs. This will give the architect
another nine years to accomplish his work; with due allowance of
time to accommodate the structure to the domestic convenience of Hi
Royal Highness. Any number of stables may be added; and as for
Mºrough House, let it remain the Vernon Picture Gallery, even
as IL IS-
The more we consider the plan, the more we are convinced of its
various conditions of facility, utility, and economy. With the Glass
Houses of Parliament determined upon, it is clear MR. BARRY can
ask for no more money. As it is, he proposes to himself (we know this
by our so potent art) to come down to Parliament for a grant of some
£20,000 more to be laid out in musk and attar of roses. MR. BARRY
has read in the oriental book of the sage EBLIA EFFENDI (he is quoted
by SouTHEY), that “in Kara Amed, the capital of Diarbekr, there is a
mosque called Iparie, built by a merchant, and so called because the
builders mixed with the chalk seventy Juk of musk, so as always to
rfume the building.”, Moreover, “the mortar of the Mihraub mosque,
having been mixed with musk, exhales the sweetest perfume.” Now,
it being notorious that the New Houses of Parliament, in so far as
finished, reek horribly of that dreadful odour, the odour of job; an odour
that exhales from nearly all our public buildings—MR. BARRY may feel
the further outlay of £20,000 to be invested in perfumes for the
mortar still to be trowelled, as absolutely necessary to render the
Houses sweet and decent; to make them, as Parliament Houses
even habitable. Now, there is not an atom, a touch, a taint of job
to be nosed in the grant of a house to the PRINCE or WALEs—
an º grant of nine years forward. But to our Parliament
Houses of Glass.
We all know the hubbub that you, MR. PAxton, have so magically
hushed. Our Park was to be desecrated—torn from us. The turf-
every root of grass intertwined with the very strings of the #.
cockney heart—was to be destroyed for ever and for ever. The number
of bricks had been calculated—the tons of mortar—even the million
tinklings of the future trowels had been nicely numbered—in a word,
the Great Lung of London was to be choked with a hideous, huge,
mountainous heap of burnt clay—and men, so great was their madness,
looked wildly forward to Chancery for a remedy.
And then—Joseph PAxton came ! With all the quietude of an
assured power, with the serenity of practical genius, Paxton unrolled
his plan before the Commission. There should be no brick—no
mortar. As for the projected dome, let the abomination pass away,
the fading fragment of an architectural nightmare. No: the structure
that should cover the samples of the world's industry should have the
lightness of crystal, with the abiding strength of iron. And, as the
º told over his plan, the Commission, with, much-relieved
eads and sparkling eyes—beheld a fairy Palace of Glass, the whole
structure fitted, with the fitness of eometry upon paper, and calculated
with the minute conviction of *ś. And the Prince clapt his
hands and said—“PAxton, go forth into Hyde Park; take glass and
iron, and-beauty wedding strength—produce the Industrial Hall of
Nations!”
And is there an ardent Londoner who—contemptuous of his late
dread of brick-and-mortar innovation, of builder's nuisance—looks, not
to the coming spring for something brilliant and beautiful? Something
that, towering and glittering in Hyde Park, shall look like a huge
glass globe blown by the concentrated breath of the hundred-headed
BRIAREUs, every mouth blowing for the like purpose, and with the
same accord * -
This done—for we consider it accomplished—we entreat you, MR.
PAXTON, forthwith to send in your plan for Glass Houses of Parliament.
Consider the fitness, the significance, of the material—glass. . If
interesting and beautiful to watch bees at work in a glass hive, how
much more delightful and instructive to see M.P.'s at work in a glass-
house! Honey-bee and M.P." How aptly, too, they assimilate in
their labours and their objects. How like, too, virgin honey, and
virgin Bills and Acts' How alike composed of the essences of remote
things, sweet, and foodful, and enduring ! And, as the cell of the
honey-comb is a triumph of the limits of space, no such space con-
taining so much with so little lost, so is an Act of Parliament, a
constant wonder of intellectual condensation; no such amount of brain,
and nothing else, being discoverable upon the same superficial inches
of §. -
lass Houses of Parliament! Do not all of us—all the represented—
see all our members hard at work?—whilst it cannot be objected to
permit the unrepresented, the unfortunate creatures without members,
to look on too. How deli htful to watch the senatorial hive! To
mark DisBAELI, entering with his gathered honey.
“Behold each wing ! A tiny van,
The structure of its laden thigh;
How fragile ! yet of ancestry,
Mysteriously remote and high!"
To see all his collected wisdom end in a deep cell! How fine to mark
PALMERSTON, with foreign wax, gathered from Hymettus! And even
should his Lordship be impeached, as he may 3. be, for throwing open
the Thames to a Russian fleet, beautiful, under a glass, hive, to mark
the ceremony that shall doom his head: and haply, in the devotion of
his adherents, to behold the renewed incident of Xenophon—“and
when the head was suspended, and became hollow, a swarm, of bees
(all ºr. of the Reform Club) entered it, and filled it—with honey-
combs.”
And as a crowning spectacle for the Out of Parliament world, how
delightful to see the Queen Bee Victoria enter the Glass House of
Parliament, and for a season send away—as she is now doing while we
write—all the bees (and drones) to English stubble and Highland heather,
MR. PAxton, you must achieve the Glass Houses of Parliament.
Here and there, as you please, you can insert a pane of magnifying
power, to make any favourite minister look a greater man than he is:
you may further have all the arms of the reigns blown in the glass, of
course i. out the arms of OLIVER CRQMwFLL–indeed, we are
so, confident in your genius that you may do what you please, if you
will only promise to build. - - -
Glass #. of Parliament will, with a triple diadem of crystal, crown
your reputation. Namely:- -
Your Glass Garden of Eden at Chatsworth; where flourish palms
without rattle-snakes; and sugar-canes with no yellow fever.
Your Glass Palace for the industrial congress of all nations; where
all the world will come to school (leaving their swords and bayonets at
the door), and all the world learn of one another., , . -
Your Glass Houses of Parliament (that must be) in which statutes
shall be made with so much light in them that, like glow-worms, they
will be at once known and studied by their own radiance.
Pray do this, dear MR. PAXTON, and accept the assurance of my
highest consideration.

THE SEA-SIDE LODGING-HOUSE MARKET.
ood front parlours, with a view of the sea from
the garret windows, are brisk at thirty shillings
a-week, and a “bed out” is considered a capital
turn-up at half-a-crown a-night. Boots on the
same footing, viz., 2d. per pair. Plate is still
quoted as an extra, though it has given rise to
as many disputes as the river of the same name,
–for the tenants and the lodging-house keepers
have a great difficulty in agreeing as to the
real boundary of the Plate. The latter have a
notion that the greatest extent it ought to run
to is half-a-dozen tea-spoons and a couple of
forks; whereas the former demand yety º;
an extension, and threaten to leave if the lodging-
house keepers attempt to show them any of their
Britannia metal. Linen is still used in sp
out the bill, though many persons object to the dearness of the spread,
and cry out against a dinner in which the plate and linen cost them
almost as much as the dinner itself. Drawing-rooms range from three
to five guineas a week, but the price rises with a balcony that faces the
“briny ocean.”
There is a demand for small houses, though the demand ceases

SCIENCE HEAD OVER HEELS.
A Newspaper report tells us that an enthusiast attending the
meeting of the British Association, desirous of testing the merits of a
newly invented article, called a “ Šafety Stocking,” plunged headlong
from the Newhaven Pier, relying only upon the virtue of the stockings
in question. His life was thus allowed to hang-not perhaps on a single
thread—but on a small quantity of cotton. We do not see how safety
stockings can be of any use in water, unless to an enthusiastic sarºnſ,
to whom it may be immaterial whether he is standing upon his head or
his heels—and it is pretty clear that, with a pair of hose not calculated
to sink, the heels of the wearer, when in the water, must have been
uppermost. - -
t is to be regretted that there was no Pons Asinorum at Newhaven
from which the leap could have been made, for this was all that could
have been required to complete the character of the experiment.
A GOOD-TURN, FOR TOURISTS.
LWAYS in starting for a
tourthere is something
tobedone besides pack-
ing one's luggage; you
must not only make up
your portmanteau, or
your carpet-bag, as the
case—we mean the
acking-case—may be,
ut you must make up
your mind where to
take it to. The plea-
sure-seeker is now torn
by so many various at-
tractions, that the diffi-
culty of deciding be-
tweenthem allisalmost
insurmountable. He
has made up his mind
to go humbly to Herne
Bay, or modestly to
Margate, when he sud-
denly finds a set of
boardmen performing
a sort of pas defascina:
tion before him, and
brandishing before his
eyes huge placards,
inviting him to make
one of several hundreds
in an “Excursion to
Paris and back, for
Thirty Shillings.” . He
- has just allowed him-
self to be allured by this promise of Continental travel at a startlingly
low figure, when a sort of demon of discord comes forward, in the shape
of an emissary of a rival line, unfurling before, the distended eyeball of
the puzzled holiday-seeker a gigantic poster, hidding him “trip it merrily”
to. “Southampton and back, for three shillings.” g away be-
wildered from the sight, he is about to weigh the merits of the two tours
presented to his notice, when there comes upon him like a thunder-clap
with a terrific bang—“Bangor and back, for a Guinea.” He is about
to rush, in the enthusiasm of the moment, across the road for a pro-
s , when his way is suddenly impeded by a monster van, suggestive
of a trip to the Rhine, in the course of which almost everything is to
be seen for almost nothing, and all kinds of advantages, including little
less than a personal introduction to all the sovereigns of all the States
the excursionists pass through, are to be had at the very lowest figure.
If relief from so much perplexity is sought in a consultation of the
columns of the newspapers, the would-be tourist is immediately whirled
is wasted in the cooking, that
about from Homburg to Hamburg, from Broadstairs to Baden-Baden,
from Rams to the Rhine, from Heidelberg to Herne, Bay, and he
rises from the perusal of the advertisements with his head in the state
of a map that has been cut to pieces, and had all its parts shaken
together in a cab-horse's nose-bag. “Oh, where? and oh, where?” is
the universal cry of every one who has a few days to spare for going
somewhere or other, but who get the old incoherent ºr rather echo-
herent answer, “Where,” which is the established circular sent by way
of reply to all enquiries that are not easily responded to..
§. ve, however, hit upon a plan which we think will save a great
deal of trouble to many a vacillating holiday-maker, who may in future
select his trip by shutting his eyes and pricking with a pin the circle of
which a plan is attached to this article. To many it matters literally not

a pin where they go, and it is quite proper, therefore, that, where there is
scarcely a pin to choose, the choice should be left to the pin in the
mode we have suggested. Of course, if the place indicated should be
further off than the tourist can afford to go, he will feel his conscience
E. as well as the pin, and he will thus be deterred from what would
e otherwise an act of º: extravagance. At the railway termini,
from which a variety of places may be reached, it might be as well to
keep a board with a kind of needle or arrow appended to it, which the
º: ht be invited to twirl for the purpose of fixing their
estination. The scheme has been found to answer with
inger-bread
nuts, and why should it not be equally popular when Mºisi to railway
travelling?
Wanted a Professor.
AN undergraduate at one of the universities—we won’t say which,
for we only make caps, but do not undertake to fit them on—has written
to request our aid in finding for him the “Professor of Law,” whose
services our correspondent much desires, being maturally anxious to
“learn something for his money.” We know no better method that our
would-be studious correspondent can adopt for attaining his object, than
by inserting in the º an advertisement, expressing a hope that the
Law Professor will soon return to his disconsolate pupils, and inti-
mating that all will be forgiven, as all has been already forgotten, by
those who happened to know anything.
Policemen in the East.
IT seems to be the destiny of the Police force to keep perpetually
‘..Moving on.” They are themselves the pioneers in obeying the
directions they are always giving to others. Recent advices inform us
of Policemen having been established at Constantinople, where the
British Bull's-eye will henceforth throw, a light on the mysteries of
crime, and the British truncheon smash the turban of Turkish turbu.

compelled to “move on,” and the hard, uncomfortable stretcher will be
the fate of the luxurious Ottoman who has been living, “not wisely,
but too well.”

They haven't been and fasted more strictly than of old;
The salt ling isn’t harder than most salt ling you’ll see;
The eggs have been as fresh as London eggs can hope to be;
A roaring trade in masses St. Bartholomew's has driven;
The buxom City madams have, as usual, sinned and shriven;
Where theimageof St. Alphage's winked three times, theirs winkedfour—
Then what is it, ye worthy monks, your pious souls doth bore?
*Tis that, all through yesternight, they could neither sleep nor pray,
For the noise in neighbouring Smithfield of the hammers’ busy play;
All night perpetual pot-boys were serving out strong beer;
There was swearing, and much language which monks ought not to hear.
Against the dawn they’ve fenced the lawn with palisadoes tall;
By the east gate the Royal state, of purple and of pall;
And the challengers’ pavilions, with streamers blazoned gay—
KING EDward holdeth tourney for ALICE PIERs to-day.
Gay squires to breathe great horses are pricking all about;
And armourers from Aldgate and Chepe are hurrying out;
And heralds in their tabards points of blazon are discussing;
And early burghers shaking hands, and burghers' wives a bussing.
#. troops are flocking in, through the squares of garden-ground,
From the City, and from Westminster, and the villages around:
From the May-flowered lanes of Islington, the fields of fair St. Giles,
They group about the greensward, and gossip at the stiles,
And cluster round the measured lists, as thick as bees in swarm,
And hear well º the armourers’ clink as the goodknights they arm;
And note the lords that stately ride, retainers at their i. :
With bent bows and bright badges, in morion and jack.
A rain-bow sea of satin-hoods, a foam of snowy necks;
Smiles and sheep's-eyes, and greetings, and laughs, and nods, and becks;
Gay gallants, steady citizens, with pouch and sober gown;
And guards employed in pulling small boys from barriers down.
A shattering blast of trumpets—a murmur and a rush—
And then a sudden holding of the breath in solemn hush,
And then a burst of welcome that makes the welkin ring,
To the cry of twenty thousand English throats, “God save the King!”
Sixty esquires of honour first on barded horses riding;
Then sixty ladies daintily their milk-white palfreys guiding;
Each leading by a silver chain an armed and helméd knight,
And a noise of many minstrels, and heralds tabard-dight;
Then, under state of cramoisy, doth stout KING Edward ride,
Fair. ALICE PIERs, the lady of the Tourney, at his side;
Bold-faced and bluff his greeting to the crowd that shout acclaim,
And sweet, though somewhat sad withal, the smiling of his dame.
They seat them in the Royal seat, and the challenge it sounds forth,
From the four trumpets, to the east, and west, and south, and north;
The Knights-adventurers ride in,_each strikes the opponent's shield;
The tilt’s begun—a course is run—a knight rolls on |. field.
The rs shout—the trumps ring out—another, and another;
The lances fly, the dust rides high, the lists are in a smother;
The summer day they joust away, and the poor monks at prayers
Scarce keep their thoughts from wandering, their eyes from sinful stares;
Until the dewy night comes down upon the º plain, .
When with torch and flaring cresset rides back the Royal train;
And the chroniclers may nib their pens to tell to after years
How in Smithfield †KING Edward held a joust for ALICE PIERs.
A. D. 1850.
Nobody has had any sleep the length of Goswell Road;
All are awake in John Street, though no early cock hath crowed;
Through the broad street of Farringdon the burghers are alert;
Upon Snow Hill no shopkeeper but is pallid as his shirt.
To-night it is a Sunday night, but the sounds that strike the ear
Are anything but § sounds for Sunday night, I fear;
Not thy old note, fair Priory, of Aves and of Paters,
But the noise of brutes in hooves and horns, and brutes in leathern gaiters.
Smithfield hath still her tournaments whereof to tellin rhyme;
But now-a-days, men are not fierce as in the elder time;
And gentler manners we can boast, since the rude age is gone
When knights could skewer each other, and ladies could look on.
Qur gallant knights are pricking still—but it is oxen's flanks;
The lusty squires they still bear staves—to welt the kyloes’ shanks:
One drover 'gainst a hundred calves they battle on the plain;
With fearless breast and goad in rest the sheep they charge amain. :
The stalwart knacker's man moves on, his grim face set in frown;
Pole axe in fist that, with a twist, can fetch a “wet’un” down :
In azure vest, with shiny crest, the carcase-butcher’s there,
His apron red with gore new shed, his chopper bright and bare.
Now range ye, knights-adventurers—the challengers are nigh—
The droves of panting oxen, foot-sore and red of eye;
With angry low, half-blind they go—now, gallants, wholdemurs
To show a squeamish world how Smithfield drovers win their spurs ?
Dig in their flanks, smash at their shanks, hit hard upon their horns—
Show how the cry of “Cruelty” the Smithfield gallant scorns—
With lusty knocks teach each dull ox the road, and if he fail . .
While on the stones make ye no bones to twist his stubborn tail.
A pleasant sight for Sunday night is this—a glorious thing;
See them coerce, with goad and curse, the oxen in a ring;
With battering blows upon the nose, and hands that push behind, , .
Andtonguesthat swear, and links thatglare, and throttling ropesthat bind.
Stout and sereneupon the scene the aldermen look down;
The manly game with pleased acclaim and mild applause they crown;
And talk with sneers of by-gone years, around their City feasts,
When men tilted at each other, and not at hormed beasts'
A TURKISH BISHOP.
UNDER the head of “Oxford Intelligence,” it was stated the other
day, in the Times, that—
“The Bishop of Exeter, it is said, is taking steps to bring MR. GoRHAM before the
Arches' Court, for heresy, as held and taught in his book.”
Really, the right reverend prelate might be content with the high
ground which he has taken in order to pull down MR. GoRHAM, without
straining to reach him by taking steps to boot. Should he prosecute
that gentleman for º heretical work, he will give occasion
to the saying, that since he had failed in the endeavour to bring MR.
Goniº to book, he had resolved to bring the book to MR. GoRHAM.
This remark, of course, will be made in comparative, allusion to the
story of MAhom ET and the mountain; and people will add, that they
did not know that HENRY EXETER was such a Turk before.
A Novelty in Travelling.
THE Edinburgh newspapers contain advertisements of “Cheap
Excursions to London, and back again.” We do not think the latter
art of the advertisement will be any great temptation to Scotchmen tº
join the excursion, however cheap. Now if the advertisement had said
“Cheap Excursions to London, and Not to come back again,” it would
have been much more to the tastes and habits of travelling. Scotchmen;
and we doubt if the Railway company would have been able to provide
sufficient carriages for the extraordinary number of applicants.
PUNCH's LABOUR LOST.
WE have been requested by a Cantab, who is discontented with the
carriages on the Eastern Counties Railway, to “smash” the said
carriages forthwith. We should be sorry to interfere with an occupa-
tion . used to be understood was always left to the servants of the
Company.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
87
HEY!
FOR SCOTLAND'S LAW.
ONSCIENTIOUSLY
we always used
to look upon
the law of Eng-
land as the very
acmé of the un-
intelligible, and
We Were accus-
tomed to think
that mystifica-
tion could no
furthergo, when
it had taken the
shape of a de-
cree in Equity.
Our attention
has, however,
been called to a
recent Scotch
judgment – or
interlocution,as
it is termed—
pronounced by
- one of the
learned Judges who preside in the superior Courts at Edinburgh. . It
sets out with the following intricate labyrinth of words, from which,
after scratching ourselves nearly to pieces among the brambles of
obscurity, we emerge in as blessed a state of ignorance as we were
in when we made our first rush into the maze, which we now invite
the venturesome reader to dash at.
“The Lord Ordinary having heard parties' procurators on the conjoined processes of
suspension and interdict, and declarator, and thereafter made avizandum, and con-
sidered the closed record productions and proceedings.”
We here leave off for a moment to allow the taking of breath; and
we beg leave to ask in the joint names of LINDLEY MURRAY, Doctor
Joh NSON, poor old DILworth, the two MAvoRs, father and son,
MRs. BARBAULD–her of the hymns, we mean—and MRs. TRIMMER,
what it all means. As a “process of suspension” is spoken of, we
ume of course that the judgment relates to a hanging matter; but
arther than this, we are not prepared to go. The “interlocution”
then proceeds thus:—
“In the suspension and interdict repels the reasons of suspension (the culprit, it
seems, is not to be hanged) and discerns; and in the declarator sustains the defences,
assoilsies the defender from the whole conclusions of the libel, and discerns.”
Here we must pause again, lest against the extreme hardness of the
words, we “dash out our desperate brains.” What does the learned
judge mean by “assoilzying a defender?” Is it a genteel way of saying,
“gets him out of the soil,” or “picks him out of the mire,” or “helps
him when stuck in the mud?” We will not “pause for a reply,” because
we might just as well keep our pause off; but we proceed to what the
#."#. in his great discernment, says that he “discerns.”
Well then, he
“Finds the suspenders and pursuers liable to expenses [What! both sides pay in
Scotland, do they?] of the conjoined action, allowing an account thereof to be given in
and remits the same: [Oh, ho! Then the judge himself pays the costs, does he? Oh
yes, certainly, for he “remits the same 1 to the auditor to tax and report.
We have a great mind to have this Scotch judgment º in the
window of our office in Fleet Street, like the patent lock in BRAMAH's
window, with an intimation that whoever can produce a key to it shall
receive a reward of Frye HUNDRED Pounds—of Wall's End coals.
We have seen in our day a large assortment of Chancery decisions,
which would have justified any non-professional parties in resorting to
a half-crown or a halfpenny to toss up, for the g." of determining
which side had gained the advantage, but this Scotch “interlocution”
makes our English equity a simple sort of matter, in comparison to the
intricacies in which we have found ourselves entangled #. now. We
can only exclaim, “Well, we never, LoRD BROUGHAM, did you ever?”
We are sure LoRD BRough AM will admit that “No, he never,” and we
hope * Lordship never may have to sit upon such a case in the way of
appeal.
The Sunday. Post Delivery.
A. P.E.A.N.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
The Sabbatarian crew,
Our letters that º: -
At last have been whopp'd;
For which thank—you know who'
Too HoRRIBLE To CoNTEMPLATE!—If a lady who hesitates is lost,
what must it then be for a lady who stammers or stutters!
A MONUMENT TO LORD ASHLEY.
YESTERDAY will long be remembered in the annals of the libro d'oro
of the Beadle of Exeter Hall. There never, has been such a meeting in
the "...”. the oldest Sabbatarian; and it was confidently prophe-
sied that Time may stand upon tiptoe to watch the advent of such
another and never behold it.
It is the peculiar felicity of a grand idea to beget a number of smaller
notions, bearing some resemblance to the original thought. Alike, but
very different. Thus, it was no sooner determined to erect a monument
to the benevolent genius of a great statesman; of a man who, whilst he
patronised the cheap loaf, did not loftily eschew the patronage of art
and letters, than a monument was determined for his late Royal
Highness the DUKE OF QAMBRIDGE ; a monument, as it now appears,
utoff until next season, in consideration of the calls upon Parliament,
grouse and the German spas. In the meantime, the architects of
ngland have, until February next, to mature their designs for a monu-
ment to departed royalty, whose peculiar goodness it was—boldly
avouched LoRD GROSVENOR-to have subscribed every minute of time,
and every farthing of money, towards the necessities of human nature.
To etermise such a fame (when duly proved, as no doubt it will be when
the shooting season ends), will tax to the highest the creative genius of
*: ... worthies. In a while, and progressing at the rate
we have travelled for the past month, monuments will start into stony
existence, rapidly as mushrooms.
LORD AsHLEY is to have a monument; and his Lordship deserves
one. It was this deep conviction of his merits—a conviction #ºf
at the hearts of his admirers—that yesterday filled Exeter Hall wit
the elect of the wicked City of London jº together to pay
homage to the bold and subtle genius of that "pious and excellent
nobleman,” as the Times º called him, who “stole a march
upon Parliament” on the day of the Derby, to shut up the Sunday
post-office; and, with the dexterity of a professor of the persecuted art
of pea-and-thimble, worked a work of zealous holiness.
he chair was taken by MR. DE NEwgATE, who called upon every
really pious man with a heart in his breast and a shilling in his pocket
to come forward with his sixpence. They would § such a monu-
ment to the good intentions of the noble and pious lord, that an
admiring posterity should go down upon its knees to it. Their º:
ments had flung it in their teeth that a certain place, to which at that
meeting, it was not necessary for him more particularly to allude, was
paved with good intentions; he, however, came not there to dwell upon
the enlargement of that pavement, but to propose a monument to good
intentions. LoRD AshLEY had been §. (groans), wickedly
defeated by a mammon-loving Government; but his Lordship's inten-
tions remained the same: he would not only have gone the whole hog,
but have compelled every man, woman, and child, to wear a Sunday
inner garment of its bristles. (Cheers.)
MR, SLEEKLocks rose to move a resolution. For his own part, he
wished to express to the noble, the heroic, but defeated lord, the pious
admiration of his disciples in the most significant and .# material
-of course he meant gold. The iniquitous Sunday letter-delivery had
been stopped. . A sinner under sentence of death had been reprieved;
but—the mail-bag remaining at the Post-Office—the evil-doer was, for
the day, kept in ignorance of the mercy; and, thereupon h
thoughts directed as they ought to be; whereas, had the sinful post
run upon that day, the malefactor would have been rejoicing. -
SLEEKLocks thought that a handsome gold ink-stand in the shape of a
death's-head should be presented to LoRD AsHLEY in commemoration
of his triumph-a triumph to be renewed next session—(Cheers)—over
the carnal authorities of St. Martin's-le-Grand.
MR. PHosphor thought a lucifer-box, delicately chased with the
armorial, bearings of his Lordship, would—to use the express words of
the speaker–ºfind an echo in the heart of every genuine Sabbatarian.”
Here ensued a long and desultory conversation, which it is needless
to report. We shall therefore omit all details, coming at once to the
determination of the meeting, which was, namely—
To erect, immediately opposite to the jºice an obelisk to the
memory of LORD AshLEy’s fleeting triumph, made of the very best and
most enduring black sealing-wax.
From a Very Old Friend.

when compared with the privilege of private viewing claimed, or at
events exercised, by our young friends “the boys.” . We have seen

is so truly primitive, that the hoarding looks like saving indeed. We
cannot give an opinion as to how the workmen get on with their

DAMAGES, TWO HUNDRED POUNDS.
SPECIAL Jurymen of England' who admire your country's laws,
And proclaim a British fury worthy of the realm's applause;
Gaily compliment each other at the issue of a cause
Which was tried at Guildford 'sizes, this day week as ever was.
Unto that august tribunal comes a gentleman in grief, -
(Special was the British Jury, and the Judge, the Baron Chief.)
Comes a British man and husband—asking of the law relief, -
For his wife was stolen from him—he'd have vengeance on the thief.
| Yes, his wife, the blessed treasure with the which his life was crowned,
Wickedly was ravished from him by a hypocrite profound.
And he comes before twelve Britons, men for sense and truth renowned,
To award him for his damage, twenty hundred sterling pound.
He by counsel and attorney there at Guildford does appear,
Asking damage of the villain who seduced his lady dear:
But I can't help asking, though the lady's f was all too clear,
And though guilty the defendant, wasn't the plaintiff rather queer?
First the lady's mother spoke, and said she’d seen her daughter cry
But a fortnight after marriage: early times for piping eye.
Six months after, things were worse, and the piping eye was black,
And this gallant British husband camed his wife upon the back.
Three months after they were married, husband pushed her to the door,
Told her to be off and leave him, for he wanted her no more;
As she would not go, why he went: thrice he left his lady dear,
Left her, too, without a penny, for more than a quarter of a year.
MRs. FRANCEs, DUNGAN knew the parties very well indeed,
She had seen him pull his lady's nose and make her lip to bleed;
If he chanced to sit at home not a single word he sai ;
Once she saw him throw the cover of a dish at his lady's head.
SARAH GREEN, another witness, clear did to the Jury note
How she saw this honest fellow seize his lady by the throat,
How he cursed her and abused her, beating her into a fit,
Till the pitying next-door neighbours crossed the wall and witnessed it.
Next door to this injured Briton MR. Owers, a butcher, dwelt;
MRs. Owens's foolish heart towards this erring dame did melt;
(Not that she had erred as yet, crime was not āj in her)
But being left without a penny, MRs. Owers supplied her dinner—
God be merciful to MRs. Owers, who was merciful to this sinner!
|CAROLINE NAYLOR was their servant, said they led a wretched life,
Saw this most distinguished Briton fling a teacup at his wife;
He went out to balls and º and never once, in ten months’ space,
Sate with his wife, or spoke her kindly. This was the defendant’s case.
Pollock, C. B., charged the Jury; said the woman's guilt was clear;
That was not the point, however, which the Jury came to hear,
But the damage to determine which, as it should true appear,
This most tender-hearted husband, who so used his lady dear,
Beat her, kicked her, caned her, cursed her, left her starving, year by year,
Flung her from him, parted from her, wrung her neck, and bºxedier ear,
What the reasonable damage this afflicted man could claim,
By the loss of the affections of this guilty graceless dame?
Then the honest British Twelve, to each other turning round,
Laid their clever heads together with a wisdom most profound:
And towards his Lordship looking, spoke the foreman wise and sound;
“My Lord, we find for this here plaintiff damages two hundred pound.”
So, God bless the Special Jury! pride and joy of English ground
And the happy land of England, where true justice does a and'ſ
British Jurymen and husbands; let us hail this verdict proper;
If a British wife offends you, Britons, you’ve a right to whop her.
Though you promised to protect her, i. you promised to defend her,
You are welcome to neglect her: to the devil you may send her:
You may strike her, curse, abuse her; so declares our law renowned;
And if after this you lose her, why you’re paid two hundred pound.
THE BULL-FIGHTS IN PARIS.
It is said that Spanish Bull-fights are about to be introduced into
Paris from Spain, and the journals are talking of the project as one
likely to be very attractive from its novelty. Bull-fights may be novel
enough on the other side of the water, but they are no novelty here
which may account for their being so unattractive, for Smithfield an
its avenues, where our London Bull-fights take place twice a-week, are
avoided by nearly all who are not compelled to resort to them if the
Parisians really want to have a specimen of Bull-fighting, let some of
the French excursionists—whom we rejoice to see among us—take a
walk some Monday morning to Smithfield market, and there they will
witness quite enough to initiate them in the sport, which, it is said
Paris is prepared to patronise. We have occasionally found ourselves
obliged to take suddenly the part of a picadore with the point of our
umbrella, and once or twice we have thought it prudent to resort to the
banderillos, by brandishing our pocket-handkerchief in a mischievous-
looking animal’s eyes, in order to divert his attention from some more
precious object. If Bull-fighting is to be turned into a public amuse:
ment, let it be done in the regular "º.
into an arena, but a state of things which compels a quiet passenger to
become every now and then a matadore malgré lui is rather à.

FLUNKEYISM IN EBONY.
ERTAINLY, it must be gratify:
ing to the Savages' Friend
Society—if there is one—and
to all the º:
and Negro-Fanciers of Exe-
ter Hall, to learn that Euro-
eantaste and refinement are
eginning to be emulated on
the coast of Africa. The
United Service Journal thus
describes an exhibition of the
splendour of sable Royalty
as displayed on board one of
HER ESTY's ships cruis-
ing in the river Cammaroon—
“KING BELL was the first to
come on board, accompanied by
his favourite wife and twelve of his
chiefs; he was dressed in the full
dress of a mail-coach-guard, with
a petticoat instead of trousers; next
was the eldest son of old AQUA, wear-
ing an English General's full-dress
coat and epaulettes, no breeches,
nor any substitute for them; last
came TIM Aqua, the younger
brother; he wore the full dress of
a general officer, and was decently
clad in a pair of white duck trou-
sers and ankle boots, also a white
beaver-hat, and on it, in-letters of
gold, “KING-AQUA.'”
“My Stars and Garters!” must be the exclamation of BRITANNIA on
contemplating the above picture, of the pomps, and vanities of the
African portion of this world. The Ethiopian Monarch had “KING
AQUA’’ emblazoned in letters of gold upon his hatband—very well—
Honi soit qui maly pense / Those who smile at KING-BELL’s combina-
tion of mail-coach-guard’s habiliments with female finery, should re-
member the androgynous GEORGE THE Fourth at MADAME Tussaud's,
in his coronation robes, º himself, quite in the taste of BELL.
In bedize his person in the full-dress coat of a British General, the
elder of the brothers AQUA evidently made a stride in civilisation; and
although he j have stridden in a costume more befitting the move-
ment, his resemblance to BRIAN O'LINN as to the lower extremities
was probably involuntary; . It may seem strange that notions of ornament
so similar to those exhibited at an English Levee or Drawing-room
should co-exist with the puerility—not to say idiocy—betrayed in the
following, incident. Divers presents, inclusive of a general officer's
uniform, having been made to the Royal brothers:—
“The PRINCE Roy AL proposed to divide the coat by cutting it down from the centre
of the back, and the King to have one epaulette, and himself the other.”
The º of his Roy AL HIGHNEss might be thought pro-
portionate to his taste, if our own courtly wigs, and cocked hats, and
gold lace, and shoulder-knots, did not indicate a feeling for decoration
pretty much on a par with that evinced by these blackamoors. Are
they not flunkies and brothers?
ENGLISH GRATITUDE.
MR. G. WALKER was the first to attract public attention to the
evils arising from Intramural Interment. He spent several years in
the investigation of the question, and large sums of money in the
accumulation of evidence. Mostly owing to his exertions, the new
Interment Bill has been passed. Appointments have been given away
under that measure; but not one to poor MR, WALKER. His existence
is ignored by Government. Services like his, deserving of some high
acknowledgment, are passed over in the coldest contempt.
We often think that England is a most ungrateful nation. France,
and other nations, are not so tardy, in rewarding their benefactors. MR.
Row LAND HILL received nothing but the “cold shoulder” from minis-
ters, for several years. MR. WAGHoRN was allowed to die almost
in want; and numerous other examples could be cited, in proof of the
little encouragement given in this country to men of science and
enterprise. And yet we prove our gratitude in the most liberal manner,
wheneyer a prince of the royal blood is to be the happy recipient of
it. We do not begrudge £12,000 a-year to a young Duke of Cambridge,
whose only public claim is, that he is the son of his father; but we
have not a farthing to give to a man whose claims are based upon
the strong ground of an universal good. It is a pity MR. WALKER
had not been a member of the Royal Family; for then, instead of
receiving nothing for doing something, he would have come in for
something like £10,000 for doing nothing. For the future, when we
are, told of Government patronage of men of talent and energy, we
shall very politely exclaim, “Walker" -
“NOW, BY ST. PAUL’S, THE WORK GOES BRAVELY ON”
THE naves of St. Paul's are happily exempted henceforth from the
truly “knavish trick” of extracting two-pence from the pocket of the
visitor; and we only hope that the Deans and Chapters of other
cathedrals will take a chapter out of the Dean of St. Paul's Book.
Westminster Abbey is still one of the show-shops of the Metropolis,
and there are several cathedrals throughout the country which might
place over their portals the words—“Pay here.” - - -
At Canterbury, in particular, the old extortionate principle prevails
of “making no charge, but leaving it to }. generosity;” and if your
generosity is not quite up to the notion of her own value entertained by
the Abigail in attendance, you are treated, with a description of your-
selves, in rather more forcible language than is employed in the very
brief allusions to the objects of interest in the cathedral. This mode
of converting those visitors who have not come down handsomely with
a gratuity into a portion of the exhibition is very ingenious, if not
altogether º and we think the authorities of the cathedral
would do well either to abolish all fees or fix the amount, so that the
visitors would not run the chance of being apostrophised as a “beggarly
set,” if they chanced to err on the side of economy.
THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA.
Being LADY NIMROD's Journal ºf the past Season.
WHEN my husband's father, SIR John NIMROD, died, after sixteen
years' ill-health which ought to have killed a dozen ordinary baronets,
and which I bore, for my part, with angelic patience, we came at length
into the property whic ought, by rights, to have been ours so long
before ... I am sure I would never have married NIMRoD, or
gone through eighteen years of dullness and comparative poverty in
second-rate furnished houses, at home and abroad), and at length monted
my maison in London. I married NIMROD. an artless and beautiful
young woman, as I may now say without vanity, for I have given up all
claims to youth or to personal appearance; and am now at the mezzo
of the path of nostra vita, as DANTE says: having no pretensions to flirt
at all, and leaving that frivolous amusement to the young girls. I made
É. sacrifices to marry NIMROD: I gave up for him. CAPTAIN (now
ENERAL) FLATHER, the handsomest man of his time, who was ardently
attached to me; MR. Pyx, then tutor to the EARL of NooDLEBURY

for jilting them, as they call it. But how could Ido otherwise? Mamma's
means were small. Who could i. that a captain of dragoons at
Brighton, or a nobleman's tutor and chaplain (who both of them adored
me certainly), would ever rise to their present eminent positions? And
I therefore sacrificed myself and . inclinations, as every well-nurtured

eighteen years. What I suffered no one can tell. NIMRoD has no
powers of conversation and I am all soul and genius. NIMROD cares
neither for poetry, nor for company, nor for science, and without ; :
without poesy, without society, life is a blank to me. Provided he

at Brighton, or at Paris. We receive company at Hornby, for a fort-

whether SIR SIDNEY SMITH was not an Admiral: he generally overeats

both SNOOKER's and TooDLE's, and returns home after six weeks to his
stupid Cumberland solitudes. Thus it will be seen that my lot in life

THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAWIA.
Being LADY NIMROD's Journal of the past Season.
ONTINUALLY have I
been asked, What
is a lion ? A lion
1S a man Or Woman
one must have at
one’s parties — I
have no other an-
swer but that. One
has a man at one's
parties because one
sees him at every-
body else's parties;
cannot tell you
why. It is the way
of the world, and
when one is of the
world, one must do
as the world does.
Vulgar people,
and persons not of
the world, never-
theless, have their
little parties and
their little great
men (the foolish,
absurd, creatures!)
and have no
doubt that at any little lawyer's wife's tea-table in Bloomsbury, or
merchant's heavy mahogany in Portland Place, our manners, are
judicrously imitated, and that these people show off, their lions,
just as we do. I heard MR. GRIMSTONE, the other º telling of
some people with whom he had been dining, a kind, whº are not in
society, and of whom, of course, one has never heard. He said that
their manners were not unlike ours, that they lived in a very comfortably
furnished house that they had entrées from the confectioner's, and that
kind of thing; and that they had their lions, the absurd creatures, in
imitation of us. Some of these people have a great respect for the
Peerage, and GRIMSTONE says that at this house, which belongs to a
relative of his, they never consider their grand dinners complete without
oor foºd Muppieiºn to take the lady of the house to dinner.
oRD MUDDLEHEAD never speaks; but ks unceasingly during
dinner time, and is there, GRIMsTone says, that the host may have the
pleasure of calling out in a loud voice and the hearing of his twenty
guests, “Lord Mupplehead, may I have the honour of taking wine
with your Lordship P’” -
I am told there are several members of the tº who let them-
selves out to be dined, as it were, in this sad way; an do not dislike
the part of lion which they play in these inferior houses. -
ell then?—what must we acknowledge?—that persons...not in
society imitate us; and that everybody has his family circle and its little
lion for the time being. With us it is NELSON come home from
winning the battle of 'º. with others it is Tom SMITH who has
ined the silver skulls at the rowing match. With us it is a Foreign
inister, or a Prince in exile; with others it may be MASTER THQMAs
who has just come from Cambridge, or Mr. and MRs. Jones who have
just been on a tour to Paris. Poor creatures! do, not let us be too
ard on them! People may not be in society-and yet, I, dare say,
mean very well. Ihave found in steam-boats on the Rhine; and at tables
d’hote on the Continent, very well informed persons, really very, agree;
able and well mannered, with whom one could converse very freely, and
get from them much valuable information and assistance-and who,
nevertheless, were not in society at all. These people one does not, of
course, recognise on returning to this country (unless they happen to
get into the world, as º do); but it is surprising how like
us many of them are, and what good imitations of our manners
they give.
§. instance, this very MR. GRIMSTONE–LADY TOLLINGTON took
him up, and, of course, if LADY ToLLINGTON takes up a man he goes
every where—four or five years ago in Germany I met him at Wies.
baden; he gave me up his bed-room, for the inn was full, and he slept
on a billiard-table, I think, and was very good-natured, amusing, and
attentive. He was not then du monde and I lost sight of him: for,
though he bowed to me one night at the Opera, I thought it was best
not to encourage him, and my glass would not look, his way. But
when once received—difficulties of course vanished, and I was delighted
to know him.
“O MR. GRIMsTone!” I said, “how charmed I am to see you
among us. How pleasant, you must be, ain't you? I see you were
at LApy Tollington's and LADY TRUMFINGTON's; and of course you
will go everywhere: and will you come to my Wednesdays?”
“It is a great comfort, LADY NIMRop,” GRIMSTONE said, “to
be in º at last—and a great privilege. You know that my
relations are low, that my father and mother are vulgar, and that until
I came into the monde, I had no idea what decent manners were, and
had never met a gentleman or a lady before ?”
Poor young man! Considering his disadvantages, he really pro-
nounces his h’s very decently; and I watched him all through dinner-
time, and he behaved quite well. LADY BLINKER says he is satirical:
but he seems to me simple and quiet. -
MR. GRIMSTONE is a lion now. His speech in Parliament made him
talked about., Directly one is talked about, one is a lion. He is a
radical; and his principles are, I believe, horrid. But one must have
him to one's parties, as he goes to LADY TOLLINGTON's.
There is nothing which I dislike so much as the illiberality of some
narrow-minded English people, who want to judge everything by their
own standard of morals, and are squeamish with distinguished foreigners
whose manners do not exactly correspond with their own. Have we
any right to quarrel with a Turkish gentleman because he has three or
four wives?, With an officer of Austrian hussars, because, in the course
of his painful duties, he has had to inflict personal unishment on one or
two rebellious Italian or Hungarian ladies, and whip a few little boys?
Does anybody cut DR. HAwTREY, at Eton, for correcting the boys?—
my sons, I’m sure, would be the better for a little more. When the
Emperor's aide-de-camp, Count KNOUTOFF, was in this country, was
he not perfectly well received at Court and in the very first circles?
It gives one a sort of thrill, and imparts a piquancy and, flavour to a
whole party when one has a lion in it, who has hanged twenty-five
Polish colonels, like Count KNouTOFF; or shot a couple of hundred
Carlist officers before breakfast, like GENERAL GARBANzos, than whom
I never met a more mild, accomplished, and elegant man. I should sa
he is a man of the most sensitive organisation, that he would shr
from giving º has the prettiest white hand I ever saw, except
my dear Bishop's; and, besides, in those countries an officer must do
his duty. These extreme measures, of course, are not what one would
like officers of one's own country to do; but consider the difference of
the education of foreigners!—and also, it must be remembered, that if
oor dear. GENERAL GARBANZos did shoot the Carlists, those horrid
arlists, if they had caught him, would certainly have shot him.
In the same way about remarkable women who come among us—their
standard of ..". it must be remembered, is not ours, and it is not
for us to judge them. When that delightful MADAME ANDRIA came
amongst us (whom GRIMSTONE calls PolyANDRIA, though her name is
ALPHONSINE), who ever thought of refusing to receive her ?, Count
ANDRIA and her first husband, the Baron D. Fatºr, are the best
friends imaginable; and I have heard that the Baron was present at his
wife's second marriage, wished her new husband joy with all his heart,
and danced with a Royal Princess at the wedding. It is well known
that the PRINCE GREGORY RAGAMOFFSKI, who comes out of Prussian
Poland—(where I hope Miss HULKER, of Lombard Street, leads a happ
life, and finds a couronne fermée a consolation for a bad, odious husban º
an uncomfortable, hide-and-seek barn of a palace as it is called, and a
hideous part of the country)—I say it is well known that RAGAMOFPSKI
was married before he came to England, and , that he made a
separation from his Princess & l'amiable; and came hither expressly for
an heiress. Who minds these things?, RAGAMOFFSKI was everywhere
in London; and there were Dukes at St. George's to sign the register;
and at the breakfast, in Hyde Park Gardens, which old HULKER gave,
without inviting me, by the way. Thence, Ísay, it ought to be clear to
us that foreigners are to be judged by their own ways and habits, and
not ours—and that idle cry which people make against some of them for
not conſºlin; to our practices ought to be put down! Cry out against
them, indeed! MR. GRIMsTone says, that if the EMPERQR NERO,
having slaughtered half Christendom the week before, could come to
England wit #. of money in his pocket, all London would welcome
, and he would be pressed at the very first houses to play the fiddle
—and that if QUEEN CATHERINE OF MEDICIS, though she had roasted
all the Huguenots in France, had come over afterwards to Mivart's, on a
yisit to QUEEN ELIZABETH, the very best nobility in the country would
have come to put their names down in her visiting-book.
A GROAN FROM THE COUNTER.
A TRADESMAN writes us a letter, in which he expresses the wish
that all gentlemen and noblemen leaving town, would follow the noble
example set by the Royal Italian Opera management, at the end of the
season. He says he should like uncommonly to have seen from many
of his customers, and he sends us their names, an advertisement set
forth in a style somewhat similar to the one published by the above
establishment, and he forwards us the sort of thing he means:—
REVIOUS TO GOING ABROAD.—All Tradesmen having Claims on
LoRD LEvant, 302, Belgrave Square, for long out-standing accounts, are requested
to send in their accounts immediately, and to call on Saturday next, at 2 o'clock for
payment; as it is his Lordship's intention to leave town on the following Monday, and
it is quite uncertain when his Lordship will return.

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS IN A NEW CHARACTER.
UR fat friend” at

tainly not beau-

He is as cer-

He has an excel-

What his effigy
is meant for —
whether as an or-
nament for the dinner-table, or a toy for the boudoir—we have no con-
ception. We are aware he has already figured as the head of a breast-

is coat mysteriously buttoned. -
“What do think I have got?” he asked, in a voice tremulous with

opening his coat, and displaying the novel bijou. “A º
breast-pin' Isn’t it stunning?” And , he had / . The infatuated
young man (who has £200 a-year besides his pay, and spends £800 to
our knowledge), had gone to a great expense to have modelled for him
a correct likeness in little of this singularly ugly animal, and was
wearing it, with the pride of a discoverer, in his cravat. -
Of i characters in the world that can be assumed by the india-
rubber-coloured mammal, which is now attracting the public to the
Zoological Gardens, we can conceive none that he has less pretensions to
figure in than as a work of art. If ladies wear him in their hearts,
infatuated guardsmen may carry him in their bosoms. But as an
independent statuette we must protest against him. No doubt the
modeller may plead the horse on which the DUKE OF WELLINGTON is
mounted on Grosvenor Gate. We admit that is ugly; perhaps as ugly
as the Hippopotamus; but one error in taste cannot be pleaded as an
excuse for another; and the abundance of ugly statuettes of horses in
the Metropolis is no justification of a novel ugliness in sculpture in
the shape of the Hippopotamus. Much as we respect that animal in
his pen, or in his bath, we cannot admit him as an inmate of the atélier,
or an intruder into the salon.
“Knocking up dome here at 2d. a-week."
WE are told by our agreeable friend “Household Words,” that a new
kind of business exists at Manchester, called “knocking up.” This
consists in “knocking up” factory people at an early hour in the morn-
ing, in order that they may be in time for their work, One woman
earns as much as four-and-twenty shillings a-week by “knocking up”
persons,—which since a lady is concerned, is much better than knocking
them down, Couldn't this “knocking up” business be applied to Par:
liament? It would be quite a relief to W. BROTHERTON. Instead of
his rising always to adjourn the House, and getting laughed at for his
pains, some old woman, “for 2d. a-week,” might, punctually as the
clock struck twelve, knock at the door of the House of Commons, and
cry out, “Come, get up;” and the House º would rise, and
o about its business. At all events, the plan would be so far good,
that it would have the effect of waking up the members, for it must be
confessed that occasionally—as, for instance, this last session—the
House is excessively º and sadly wants stirring ºp; One thing is
very certain,_that if the fouse is ever *knocked up,” it will never be
from the quantity of work it has done.
The QUEEN AT ostenD.
THE reception of the QUEEN at Ostend is described as dull. We
might have expected the people of Ostend to have been a little more
Ostend-tatious in their demonstrations.
and the more especially, so oleaginous a pastor as the Bis
THE PUFFING SYSTEM AT ST. PAUL’S.
It would seem, from a letter in the Times, that the taking off of the
twopenny poll-tax in St. Paul's Cathedral is a piece of news “too good
to be true,” and that the old, principle of “Walk up, you are now in
time, only twopence,” is still º in force at the door of the
sacred edifice. The correspon
been attracted by the report of the abolition of the charge, he went to
St. Paul's, and found the doors beset by persons claiming free ingress,
and being met by the old demand of twopence from the doorkeepers.
If this is really the cause, it is positively disgraceful that a false rumour
should be put into circulation, which would naturally have the effect of
causing an unusual attraction, and securing an additional influx of the
“filthy lucre' from those who having come all the way to St. Paul's,
would rather pay the twopence than go all the way home again for
nothing. If the twopenny charge is still in force, let it be well under-
stood, so that the unholy harvest may not be augmented by an unworthy
artifice.
-
THE MARQUEss of CLANRICARDE is one of the best-natured of men.
To be sure, it is difficult to withstand the instrumentality of a bishop;
i. of Oxford.
Great, indeed, is his secretion of the oil of gladness; an oil with which
he has softened the already soft heart of the Postmaster-General. One
Z. W. Davis, illuminating 25, Princes Street, Mile End, writes thus
joyfully to the rejoicing Morning Herald:—
ent of the Times asserts, that having
“Sre, You will be glad to hear, that through the kind instrumentality of the Lord
Bishop of Oxford, R. G. HowLETT, the letter-carrier, who was dismissed from the
General Post-Office in November last, for distributing hand-bills against Sunday labour
therein, has been re-appointed to a situation in that branch of the public service by the
Postmaster-General, the MARQUEss of CLANRicarde.”
Very kind, very forgiving, this, of the Marquess; the more so, inas-
much as the discontent and conspiracy of the tribe of HowLETTs were
mainly instrumental to the manufacture of the petitions with which
LoRD AshLEY, armed in the innocence of sheep parchment, attacked
the Sabbath-breakers in the House of Commons. º is notorious, that
the treasonous practices of the country. Post-Office servants were of
fatal influence º the idleness and indifference of the mass of the
º'. idle an
ost was considered no other than an immºaning
“think they’re pious when they’re only bilious.” . Every ten years at
most, some phosphoric prophet foretells the end of the world, giving the
day and the hour; nevertheless, folks do not go into sackcloth, and
wder their heads with ashes: and tradesmen are no whit less indif.
erent to the tender of a bad shilling. And thus it was with the bray of
the Sabbatarians. The world received it as only an evidence of length
of ears, taking no heed of its menaced heels. And the Derby-day came,
and—in the House of Commons—the bray became a note of triumph.
But all is to be forgiven and forgotten. The hundreds of people who
have suffered the piety of Lord AshLEY: the sick, with the survivors
of the dead; the anxious and the harassed, all pardon his Lordship the
tyranny of his saintly goodness; for which no doubt his Lordship, in
the º of his heart, is very properly penitent, and abundantly grate-
ful. AsHLEY shall be forgiven, and HowLETT restored.
evertheless, the MARQUEss or CLANRICARDE, by his º
ment of the treasonous HowLETT, has taken a large trump card from
the hands of the Sabbatarians. It was the misfortune of Punch to
censure HowLETT into the receipt of £50, indignantly laid down for him
by some well-meaning soul, shocked and outraged by the harmless
lenity that Punch—according to his wont—poured upon the head of the
discharged postman. HowLETT, blistered by Punch's ink, was salved
and comforted by a sanative bit of bank paper. But Punch required
further and better treatment of HowLeft; when, lo! the merciful,
kind-hearted Marquess steps in—or is rather pulled into the rescue by
a Bishop—and HowLETT, the martyr, is restored to his original con-
dition. Is there no abiding reward in this world for the lowly champion
of truth? We had hoped to see HowLETT maintained in Sabbatarian
clover, the pet example of Post-Office piety.
“For he on honey-dew has fed
And drank the milk of Paradise."
This should have been the amended condition of the victim ex-
#. had the Postmaster-General been less yielding to a bishop.
owlett would have been the stall-fed martyr of Exeter Hall. And,
as in Catholic countries, certain relics are on certain days exhibited to
the populace; so, on certain gatherings, would our HowLETT, with a
ruddier tint upon his cheek, a sleeker texture of skin, and a growing
dignity of abdomen, been presented to the elect of the Hall, as a lovely
and flourishing example of well-rewarded piety, carefully taken in .
abundantly done for by Lord AshLEY and his cinder-loving followers.

as
Even with HowLETT restored to the Post-Office, he, is a daily, hourly example to his
fellow-labourers of the impunity that may attend official treason and revolt :, but with
HowLETT, kept at Sabbatarian expense-HowLETT, grown, sleek as a º beaver—he
would have been a twofold example of the prosperity of the conscientious, lowly, and the
enerosity of the Sabbatarian rich. HowLETT, fat, and thriving, would have afforded a
elightful gloss to the pious text of Qur AshLEY preaching.
Again, the Bishop of Oxford, in his all unworldly way, has missed a chance. . Why did not
he comfort and harbour HowLETT *. Could he not have clothed him in episcopal purple,
and suspended him at the back of his coach, showing a stiff-necked, generation what glory
was, vouchsafed a Post-Office martyr, whom a bishop, delighted to honour. This Oxford
might have done; and this, with his characteristic meekness, he has foregone and missed.
e must, therefore, be content to leave HowLETT at the Post-Office. We trust, however,
that he will have an extra bit of gold lace to mark his worth and past suffering. Possibly
the MARquess of CLANRICARDE has already provided for this, saying with Bassanio when
he engages Lancelot Gobbo,
i. Give him alivery
More guarded than his fellows: see it done.”

TO SEA-SIDE LODGERS.–IMPORTANT.
MR. Punch,
MINE is a hard case. I am a sofa–a º and horse-hair sofa–at a watering-
º on the coast of Kent, for I won’t be too particular. As a sofa, I expect to be put upon;
ut even, sofas may have more than they can or ought to bear. I come of homest mahogany,
and the first horse-hair. My mahogany, in its green state, grew in Honduras, where (as I
heard a º sing one of your songs last Christmas, four of 'em sitting on me at the same
time)—where, Mr. Punch—
“Oft in my boughs birds of rare plume
Sang in my bloom; ”
and for my horse-hair, that is from the manes and tails of more than one racer, who, although
long since gone to the dogs himself, has still left silver-cups to posterity. And this much,
Mr. Punch, for my respectability. Now comes my grievance, which I, make known to you
as a warning to every body—’specially unprotected females—coming to the sea-side.
MRs. FINGERCADDY, of Seagull Cottage, lets, what she calls, furnished º Last
week our parlours were to go out on Wednesday morning; and two elderly maiden ladies to
come with their trunks at night. No sooner had the first lodgers left than I–the mahogany

“Why, that º and horse-hair sofa,” says the other lady, her voice rising, “that

“Oh, that sofa,” said MRs. F., and I trembled with shame when I heard her, “That sofa,
ies, was only hired.”

“Hired and gone home; but for only half-a-crown a week, you can have it here and welcome.

The head waiter, in returning thanks, so affected
his fellow-waiters, that they were compelled to
absorb their tears in their napkins. -
The piece of plate was a salver with an inscrip-
tion, in which the head waiter was salved over
with compliments to an immense extent, and
there was inscribed in the centre, as a motto,
the words “Coming, coming,” in allusion to
which the recipient was frequently spoken of as

to hand five hundred breads in forty minutes,
wipe three hundred glasses in half an hour, pour
out eighty glasses of champagne, and exclaim,
“Coming directly, Sir,” to eighty applicants at
once, without going near one, or giving offence
to any.

CONSTANTINOPLE REMOVED TO REGENT
STREET.
Y at least two miles less of water in it, Constan-
tinople differs from all other Panoramas. We
have been overrun with so many rivers lately,
that it is quite a relief, after having had nothing
but cataracts in our eye, to see the land again.
The cockney, who has been eight hours on
board a steamer, could not behold Margate
jetty with Fº delight, than we hailed the
minarets o Constantinople, after being tossed
about for months and months on the broad
waters of the Nile and the Mississippi. We
have been in the water so long-swimming
and floating over half the globe—that a little
walking has done us an immensity of - -
It must be confessed that the walking is very different to a stroll u
Regent Street, or a lounge in the Park. The walk is invested with all
the interest which the first walk in a new º: affords a stranger.
Two eyes are scarcely sufficient to notice the strange sights that
meet you at the corner of every street; and one mouth is at a loss to
find exclamations—much less words—to express the wonder upon
wonder that fills you at the discovery of each new beauty. There is
nothing so delightful as this kind of walking. You choose some dark
corner of the room, and there unseen by everyone, and seeing no one
you leave England, and all thoughts of duns and debtors and ousehold
cares, far behind you. The next minute you open your eyes, and find
ourself wandering about in the streets of some foreign capital. You
}. no necessity to leave your seat; only give yourself up to the
ictorial influence of the scene, and let your eyes walk instead of your
j It is more amusing, less fatiguing, and does not wear out shoe-
eather.
You are in the Polytechnic Institution—at least you were a minute
ago—for now you are in the Cemetery of Eyoub—unlike the cemeteries
in London, for it is outside the town; but then you must not be surprised,
for you should recollect that we, English, are the most civilised nation
in i. world, and that Turkey is only as yet in a half barbarous state.
This leads you into the Street of Tombs. , Make haste, bend yourself
double, for that fine gentleman on the white horse like Timour the
Tartar is the Sultan, and, if you fail to give the passing salaam, a
gentleman may come behind you and whisk your head off as cleanly as
if he were playing at knock-'em-downs, and your head was the wooden
incushion. }. Sultan is followed by a long escort of dogs, who are
ghting away, “like regular Turks.” These animals lead a perfect cat-
and-dog-life, for they are always quarrelling, and if an unhappydog becomes
a pauper and is thrown on the parish, it is unfortunate for him if it does
not happen to be his own parish, for all the other dogs set upon him and
hunt him to death. In this way is he passed from parish to parish, so that
he is a very lucky dog, if he reaches his own parish with a whole skin.
The traveller should not snarl, like a cynic, over these misguided
creatures, for he should recollect that but a short time ago paupers in
England were treated very little better than dogs.
hat building opposite, which reminds you of the Clifton Baths at
Gravesend, is a mosque. You need not wait to look at it, for you will
see plenty more in your day's ramble-Constantinople is full of such
mosques. They are somewhat like the Pavilion at Brighton, only highl
ilt. They have beautiful domes, to which the domes we see in #.
'errace, Rºº, Park, are mere thimbles. No stranger is admitted
into them, not even upon payment of money, which is rather astonish-
ing, for considering the late Sultan introduced into Turkey many
European usages, we wonder that he overlooked the admirable two-
penn º systems of St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey,
which rank, with justice, amongst the highest proofs of our superior
civilisation. . .
The next object, you are told, is the Golden Horn, only it is as much
like a horn as Battersea is like a Sea of Batter. Fountains, which, we
are reluctantly compelled to confess, .*. in elegance our pum
invite you to drink in every direction, and from the fountain we are }.
by a natural spring to the Bath.
These Baths are very different to our Baths and Washhouses, and
seem to be much fumier. The figures are very amusing, and we regret
there are no Turkish baths in London, for we have long disbelieved in
the Mahommedan origin of MAHOMMED, ever since he last answered us
in an unmistakeable Irish accent. The regulations of these baths seem
to be on the dinner principle, of three courses and a dessert, the latter
consisting of a cup of coffee and a pipe. In appearance, the establish-
ments look like immense Dyers' and tiºnſ. , and we noticed a big
fat Alderman of a Turk, who, in the first course, was of a dark chocolate
colour, come out at last an elegant rosy-pink complexion, not unlike a
prawn. These dyeing baths would
Vauxhall, have lost all their colour.
A visit to Constantinople without going to a Bazaar would be like
be of high value, to many of
our young men, who, from a long curriculum of study at the Casino and
visiting London and not going to see the Exeter Change Arcade. The
idea that there is any similarity between the two will be dispelled after
one moment's stay, for in a Turkish bazaar there is activity, and life
and business, and shops not only with goods but with customers, and
no Beadle to parade |. up and down, as a make-believe that the
place is an immense thoroughfare."
A Turkish Bazaar, again, is different to the Soho Bazaar, or the
Pantheon, for the stalls are served by huge men, who look so big that
you cannot help believing they have been stall-fed. There are no pretty
i. with pretty º: in them, to tempt you to buy useless things you
o not want. It is different to the łºś. Bazaar, and the Marine
Bazaars you meet at watering-places, for it has no raffles, or comic songs
sung in character, nor even a wheel of fortune. It struck us as being
more like the Lowther Arcade than anything else—for all the goods
are thrown out of window, and run all over the pavement, giving you
the notion that they had been shot out of a cart, like coals, preparatory
to being stowed away in a cellar. There is this difference, however,
that the º of the Lowther Arcade do not sit, like tailors on
their boards, in the midst of their ºl. for as most of the Lowther
works of art consist of tea-cups, and tumblers, and Bohemian glasses
from Birmingham, this Turkish method of keeping a shop would be
attended with no little danger.
The time is wearing on, and we have not half finished our walk.
There is the Grand Mosque of St. Sophia, which reminds us once more
most painfully of the barbarism of the Turks, for it has not a single
pew, and, greater blessing still! not a single pew opener. We have not
yet visited the Slave-market, where, we are told, the slaves are so fond
of being sold, that they actually pray, and cry, and go down upon their
knees, to be bought, which reminds us of the equally probable story of the
eels not at all disliking the process they undergo previous to being cooked
—nor have we been into a coffee-house, and smoked a chibouk,+nor
penetrated into the interior of any of the mosques, but, as you are not
allowed to enter without taking off your boots, it may be as well to
remain outside, for, upon our asking for a boot-jack, we were told there
was not one upon the premises. There are also the Burnt Colu
which has been the hero that has stood a hundred fires, and never flinch
once,—and the Hippodrome—and the Sublime Porte, which is more the
colour of Sherry, or Bucellas, than the sublime liquid it has drawn its
name from-and the beautiful view of Constantinople from the Bos-
Shorus, with its thousand minarets, which look like a forest of
W.s. ever-pointed pencils, or more like many silver cases of caustic,
—the black points exactly resembling the protruding bits of that very
lunar compound...We have all these to see, besides the Seraglio–the
veil of which is lifted, and its mysteries shown to the inquisitive eye of
every harem-scarem youth. Our time is precious—so must we bring
our promemade to an abrupt termination—and take leave of MR. ALLOM,
after thanking him for having guided us so eably through the
parlours, and shops, and palaces, and cellars, and secret cupboards of
Constantinople. He has shown us what no other Panorama has done
before him—he has thrown open the doors of a whole city, and allowed
us to peep inside. The Panorama of Constantinople has one ; :

THE Correspondent of a morning paper, describing the street prepa-

Louis NApoleon, on his recent visit to Lyons, recalled the words of
the Emperor, and requested the City of Lyons to love him. He did his
best to clothe himself in the second-hand habits of his illustrious uncle,

of the ignobler animal in the Lion's skin.

THE PIMLICO 'BUSSES.
WHEN we were at school, we used in our themes to select FABIUS
as our great standing example of delay, but if we now required a stand-
ing example of delay, we should select a Pimlico 'Bus as our staple
commodity. The manner in which these vehicles “drag their slow
length along” is something quite unique in its .# and we frequently
make the mental observation, that as speech is often used to conceal
thought, so a Pimlico 'bus is resorted to in order to retard a journey.
We have heard arithmeticians talk of a fixed quantity, but we never
saw the idea so thoroughly carried out as we § the other day, when
we noticed a quantity of passengers fixed at Hyde Park Corner in a
Pimlico omnibus.
SHARSPEARE talks about somebody having been “fixed as great
Atlas' self,” but we must say for the Atlas omnibuses, that we never
saw one of them “fixed” for any considerable time; and if the Bard of
Avon had said, “fixed as great Royal Blue's self” he would have
approached much nearer to our modern motions of a fixture.
t is true that the public has its remedy—as well as its threepences-
in its own hand, and it would do well to discourage the stagnant omni-
buses by declining to ride in them. We can only say, that
If we saw an omnibus what wouldn't go,
Do you think we'd enter it? No, no, no.
We’d take out a summons, and cry, “So, so,
You're pulled up, Jarvey !”
It seems that the officers of the Blues—that is to say, the conductors
—are not remarkable for knowing how to conduct themselves, however
expert they may be in conducting their vehicles. It is a pity there is
no academy for a cad in want of a stock of good manners. It is true
we cannot expect much civility to be thrown into the bargain, when the
fare is only threepence, but we had rather ride a shorter distance for
our money than go further and fare worse at the hands, or rather at the
tongue, of the conductor.
Fairy Land.
MANY persons have a curious notion of Fairy Land. For instance,
the bills of the Terrace Gardens at, Grayesend tell us that “the
magnificent hall is illuminated by 10,000 brilliant º presenting such
a magnificent coup d'ail, as to remind one instinctively ºf Fairy Land.”
We are sorry to contradict a play-bill, but on the faith of the above
announcement we were allured to the Terrace Gardens, and must say
that we were anything but reminded of the beautiful country alluded to
for the very first person we met was MR. ToM MATTHEws, the celebrated
clown, who is, we believe, a very deserving personage, but scarcely the
kind of ethereal creature you would expect to meet in Fairy Land!

THE CAMBRIDGE MONUMENT.
Hough almost everybody is out of town,
it is still a comfort to know that London
banking-houses are still open, with clerks
to match at their desks. It is further de-
lightful to contemplate the fact, as given
in an authorised paragraph crawling the
rounds, that the London bankers, “are
evincing a deep interest” in the visionary
Cambridge Monument. With the present
tremendous glut of gold, London bankers
are doubtless ready to take an interest
in anything. monument could not
have }. chatted about at a better time.
And, as we have said, Metropolitan
banking-houses continue open, willing
victims may still forward cheques from
ºrs or the heather. A great and abiding comfort, to be assured
oi tills
It would seem, however, that a certain faintness of heart came over
the committee self-interested with the duty of raising a cairn to the
memory of CAMBRIDGE. The money has not poured in: indeed it has
hardly drizzled. Whereupon, some great moral genius, some Magi-
cian of the Heart in Connexion with the Pocket, has caused it to
blown at all ends of the kingdom, that it will be proposed at the next
meeting, to be held on the 5th of November:
“That The NAMEs or ALL such CHAIRMEN AND SECRETARIES, As well. As The
INSTITUTion with which THEY ARE CoNNECTED, shall be INSCRIBED on the
PEDESTAL or The Monument.”
This is deep and admirable as profound. MUGGINs is a chairman
and BUGGINs is a secretary. MUGGIN’s heart now melts and overflows
in admiration of the dead Duke, and he sees himself going down the
tide of posterity--(how the apples swim the golden pippin CAMBRipGE
and the crab Muggins!)—on the same wave with a royal philan-
thropist! From this moment, MugGINs gives all the energies of his
soul to the pedestal of the monument; the Monument to the Good
DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE, and the Pedestal to the Active Chairman
Muggins.
And mow, considering the case in its natural expansion, must we not
feel for the $º uaintance, and deeply compassionate the
dependents of MuggiNs? Is there friend or workman to be spared by
Muggins: By turns he begs, smiles, and bullies, “Your money for
the good DUKE of CAMBRIDGE” whilst his soul runs a whispering
accompaniment, “ and the earcellent Chairman, MUGGINs.” The ke
varying, the words are the same—“Money for CAMBRIDGE, AN
MUGGINs.” From this time forth, MUGGINs will haunt the sleep of
many a victim. He will be the nightmare MUGGINs, squat upon the
breast of his dreaming acquaintance, with a plate in his hands, with
shining eyes changed, into ghastly º; ieces, with under jaw
mowing, and inarticulately mumping—“Good CAMBRIDGE—excellent
MUGGINs | * -
We honour, we reverence in a fashion, the Committeeman who has so
adroitly forced the goodness of a CAMBRIDGE into common cause with
the conceit of a Chairman, the vanity of a Secretary, It was a beautiful
touch of brain that has thus set loose upon hundreds of unprotected
pockets a band of marauders, who, with masks of royal purple, will
present a plate and roar “CAMBRidge" with the sweet, recurring
under note of “MUGGINs 1”
And yet, large and beautiful as is the original idea, its magnitude
. be increased, its beauty deepened. Wherefore should the Chairman
and the Secretaries have alone a nominal record? Why should not
MUGGINs, Chairman, and BugGINs, Sec., be further companioned with
WIGGINs, contributor? Why should it not be in the power of WIGGINs
to purchase, P. one guinea, a square one-eighth of an inch for his
descendant of the Fortieth century to glow and swell at, and to point
out to his children—“That was your ancestor; that was the W1GGINs
of 1850?”. Why, we repeat it, should not Wiggins, contributor, have
his guinea's worth of posterity, alike with MUGGINs, Chairman—with
BUGGINs, Sec.? It not satisfy us to assert that no pedestal tablet
can be of sufficient magnitude to admit all names. For it is only to
reduce the names to the dimensions of the man who originated the
thought of the inscription, and so wondrously small must they become,
that a common j ill hold any number of thousands. many
animalculae in a cheese would require far wider space.
Again, as we would do rightful honour to all subscribers without dis-
tinction, so would we correspondingly punish the lukewarm and the
backsliding. We would have a tablet of infamy, an ignominious black
slab upon which, for the abhorrence of J.; we would brand all
the names of those Englishmen proved capable of the Income Tax,
who should be found unwilling to make subscription to the Monument
of Cambridge. Upon that black slab of shame we would offer up, or
down, to posterity the name of every defaulter of £150 per annum. For
whilst it is made open to a man to buy the approving smile of posterity,
let him also, failing in his duty, be punished with its frown.
And finally, we have to make another º rewardful of all
Chairmen and Secretaries. It is this. That they should have upon the
Cambridge Monument not only their names, but—in alto relievo–their
busts. The expense, as we consider it, would be trifling, and the
material common and easy.
- Has not the reader beheld, stamped with wooden stamp upon a pat
of butter, the figure of a bird, intended for a swan, but looking more of
the goose? In this fashion, and on this material, would we have the
medallions of the Chairmen and Secretaries. Their faces cut in wood,
and stamped on butter—yes, Cambridge butter.
LAY OF THE IMPRISONED LONDONER.
(By a Foreign-Office Clerk, who had his holiday early.)
My eyes are tired of street and square,
My constitution lacks sea air:
My ear is sick of Opera squalls,
My legs are quite knocked up with balls;
I would that I were once again
Boxed in a first-class Dover train,
Bound somewhere 'tother side the sea—
That were the time of day for me!
As to Whitehall I sadly hie
The Railway cabs they rattle by;
I mark the luggage piled outside
The happy looks of those that ride;
I know they’re going far away
To scenes of no work and all pla >
And sigh to think, while they are free,
'Tis all work and no play with me!
No more at eight they’ll have to rise,
Though hot and heavy be their eyes;
Of office work to face the bore,
Although they polked last night till four.]
No more précis they’ll have to write,
No more draft letters to indite;
As idle as they like they’ll be—
And that’s the life that pleaseth me !
A FEW WORDS ABOUT OURSELVES.
It is not often we speak about ourselves. Though, perhaps, forming,
as we do, one of the chief subjects of the day, we might be excused for
talking occasionally of that which is in the mouth of every one. Perhaps
the most common iii. that is said about usis, the every day observation,
that “it is really marvellous how, week after week, such a magnificent
collection of wit and wisdom as our publication comprises, can be con-
tinually got together.” We are ourselves often thrown into fits of
*:::: and admiration at our own splendid achievements.
t is indeed marvellous that, now for a space of more than nine years,
Punch has come forth with punctuality and brilliancy, as regular—we
were going to say as clock-work—but clock-work is fickleness itself in
comparison to the certainty and precision with which we have come
before an appreciating world every Saturday. How Punch is got
together, may, indeed, form a puzzle to ingenious curiosity, or curious
ingenuity. ith the brilliant corps of contributors and artists, some-
times scattered in all corners of the earth, the § still appears,
rendered only more prodigious by the apparent #. ties with which
the production of a number of Punch, every week, is surrounded. Yes;
the por populi is, in this *T. right. ... We are a miracle. We
know it; and we are glad to find the public sensible of the fact, of
which we thus offer an acknowledgment.
A Dispensary Indispensable.
THE Dispensary for the Diseases of the Ear has beenholding its anni-
versary meeting. We wonder if the new House of Commons is amongst
its patients, for its hearing is extremely bad—infinitely worse even
than the old House—in which the people universally complained that
they could never get the members to hear a single thing that they
wanted. If the New House is no better, we can tell the Commons
that they will have the House brought about their ears in a way that
they would not like.
F TOM BROWN, WHO WENT UP IN A BALLOON ABOUT SEVEN
ears ago, and has not since been heard of, does not return within ten days to
his disconsolate wife, she will consider herself to all intents and purposes a widow
and perfectly at liberty to sell off the business Tom Brown left behind him, an
marry whom she pleases.

LIGHTS, LIGHTS, I SAY!
CoMPLAINTs have been made, through

It is rather too bad, when the sover-

of the public, who may well begin to
declare that the Bank will lose weight
with the country, if such a practice
should become general. These deficient
sovereigns, when they have once had
a light thrown, upon them by the im-

against them, should no fº be

O U R L | T T L E B I R D.
A WORD FOR THE NIGHTINGALE,
ERTAIN of our friends in print take it in
dudgeon that JENNY LIND should have so
gathered about her all the hearts of Liver-
jºi should have been so attended to
er ship by the “aves vehement” of affec-
tionate thousands; for there was real heart
in the shoutings that were sent to her
\o across the Mersey. Good friends, think
* again; reconsider your discontent. When
there is so much lip-homage—so much eager
voluntary self-debasement—so much licking
of the shoe-leather of absurd pomp, that
has no more in it or upon it, to justify the
- .idolatry, than may iºn in the barren
letters that spell, a title—in the imagined heap that piles a banker's
account-when there is so much nauseous worship of the Capitolian
geese, that only, cackle, and do not protect—of the golden calves, that,
Saye to themselves, are not of the worth of shambles' veal—when, in
this age, so , precipitant in adulation of prosperity, so that it be
rosperity, when no questions shall be asked—at a time when the
evoted breeches pocket lºyalty to a railway king has foamed itself into
yirtuous wrath, the said king's ºl. crown being sent to the old
iron, shop—at a time so full of sad, umiliating examples of the human
tendency to crawl to the mere images of position and success; at such
a time, we take comfort and rejoice in the manifestation of esteem,
even though deemed extravagant and in superflux, when paid to a
geºus–to a genius so often shown the handmaiden of good.
We, have the hardihood to confess the preference. Yes, we
mightily prefer the applausive shout sent from the throats of a
º crowd, a shout of happy wishes to a JENNY LINd, to the
stupid, thundering bluster of a Portsmouth salute, stunning, in the
mame ºf senseless ceremony, a quiet elderly gentlewoman. The cannon,
with, their 'adamantine lips,” bellow—“You’re a duchess;” and not a
word, a º: more. Human thousands shout to the somewhat more
than Duchess of song; and in that shout, so brief and sudden, there is
acknowledgment, thankfulness for sweet, ennobling emotions; as for
ºf good. , How many of the sick, with the thought, the know-
ledge of...that shout, might add their prayers, and grateful blessings
to sanctify the acclaim!
Gºod friends in print, anxious for the stiff sobriety of the English
mind-friends and guardians of propriety, fearful of unprofitable and
unseemly enthusiasm when lavished only upon genius and virtue—take
heart, be confident. There are still wooden idols enough, and more
than enough, to keep alive and rank the old religion. se-worship
and calf-worship will not so soon pass away. There is yet enough of
the national heart left untouched to pulsate at the ring of current coin
—there are yet thousands and tens of thousands of ham-strings, to
work, obediently as the threads of painted, paper toys, at the look, the
*}. of those earthly gods, for whose Pantheon see DEBRETT's
eerage.”
Is there any lack of idols? Any backsliding in idol-worship? A
young Duke has successfully made off from the House of Commons—
(composed of hustings lynxes, that, after the election, are prone to sleep
like hearth-rug spaniels)—made off with a booty of £12,000 per annum;
the yieldin Whigs all guiltless of a blush, HuME's arithmetic might
off-hand calculate the number of household chattels, at a given price,
that, sold by the tax-gatherer's warrant, would make a monetary year
of that self-same Duke; a monstrous young Duke so considered, with
more legs and arms about him than a Hindoo God; with this difference
-they are the legs and arms of tables and chairs confiscated to the
Exchequer. It is pregnant of thoughts salutary, if not blitheful, to
consider how ‘. unjust shilling, voted by way of pension or expense
may become a visible, working tyrant at the hearths of the poor seized
upon for taxes. . If we may trace the dust of CesAR to a bungºhole, so
may we follow the last blanket of the shivering poor into the pocket of
the pensioner.
Is it not monstrous, a crying wrong, that, this new DUKE of
CAMBRIDGE should sit so heavily upon the backs of the people; and
et, let his Royal, Pursiness appear as visitor in any town, or city, and
air ladies would, flutter their handkerchiefs, and the crowd shout
hurrahs at the Illustrious Pensioner. Now, when we are so ready to
huzzah human packages, because labelled with a high figure, why should
we stint our breath at leave-taking of human genius exercised for
human happiness, ...and made so often nobly ministrant to human
suffering * Will all the “Contents” and “Non-Contents” that a
Cambridge may utter value one trill of JENNY LIND P Or rather, may
they not cost the country a hundred times the amount that JENNY, in
her goodness, has thrown about her.

reconsidering the matter, may rejoice too. It is surely no ill sign when
*OL. XIX. M
a vast commercial community acknowledges something beyond the
ledger. Who knows, some day, the painter may personally have more
honour for his pictures, than the mere noble for his heraldic bearings—
the sculptor for his statues, than the commercial owner of vast granite
quarries—the writer of one immortal little book, more even than the
possessor of a paper-mill who turns his weekly thousands? And if this
should come to pass—(and the homage to JENNY is only a homage to
art and goodness, not an indirect reverence to her banker)—why should
our friends of the press sneer and repine? Qught they not rather to
applaud the feeling—to foster it, and rejoice in its fullness? Shall it
be said that the porcupine, with all its upright, independent quills, has,
in its present condition, somewhat too much of the toad eater?
To return to JENNY. It seems she is to give a concert on board the
ship for the benefit of the sailors. Very good. As, in the course of
the j. it is certain she would be called upon for music—it is well
she should sing for the profit of poor Jack. And she will sing:

The worst, however, awaits JENNY upon her landing in New York.
There, showman BARNUM lies, in wait for her, it is said, with a pro-
cession '... We are truly sorry that JENNY should have fallen into such
mercantile hands. BARNUM's commodities should still be dwarfs and
manufactured mermaids. He should have had no dealings with JENNY
LIND. Poor soul!'. We wish her safe back again; even though, to the
amazement of our friends, Liverpool should give her welcome worthy
of their farewell. For łº, plauded the woman as well as the
singer. It is not every Nightingale that makes to herself wings of
hospitals. A LITTLE BIRD.
PUNCH'S HAND-BOOKS FOR TRAVELLERS.
Mr. PUNCH, envious of the reputation of MR. MºRRAY and his
celebrated Handbooks, announces his intention of publishing a new
series of Handbooks, which he is sure will soon be met with in every
railway, auberge, bierbrauerci, gasthof, hotel, palazzo, and mountain top

The reporter of the Times, in giving an account of the Peace Con-

This is not worse than our English janitors, who invariably make a

French call him—was compelled to sleep in a cockloft)—the Nepaulese,
we were about to say, was always known, by the humbler class of
fondoners as the New Police Ambassador, there being a vague motion
about, town that his mission was in some way connected with the
establishment of a police force, in the East, for the detection of the
light-fingered portion of the dark-faced population. The “Das ist

ABRAHAM PARKER!” with which IBRAHIM PACHA used to be saluted
by the gaminerie of London.

of conscience P If shareholders return
conscience money to railways they may
have defrauded, why should not railways
also make the same conscientious offerings
to the innumerable shareholders they
have helped to defraud all over the

But this proposed system, however just,
would be attended, unfortunately, with
one great difficulty—the want of means;

A RACE FOR AN EMPIRE.
ONSIDERING the extreme
smallness of the qualification
necessary to constitute a can-
didate for the head of the
State in France, we are sur-
prised that others have not
rushed into the field to take
an "equal chance with the
Count DE CHAMBord (HENRY
sº the FIFTH) and Louis NAPO-
a LEON. We are sure that every
English heart will ask, at this
= eventful moment, where is
GoMERSALP The accounts of
the proceedings of the other
individuals aspiring to give a
& dynasty to France are suffi-
cient to show that everything
º done by them is of a
purely theatrical kind, and
therefore it could all be done
much more effectually by our
old friend Gomers AL. . He
has been familiar all his life
* with the Coulises, while the
performers that have recently
een acting their parts—the
one at Wiesbaden, the other
at Besançon, Lyons, &c., &c.,
—are evidently new to the
sort of thing, and consequently
fail in giving due effect to the
numerous dramatic points they
- - are intent upon ..
For instance, who can read the report of the scene enacted by the Count DE CHAMBORD,
when he called the outriers round him and, insisted on their drawing close enough to him to
enable him to hear their hearts beat?, Who, we ask, can read this, without seeing the
figure of GowensA1, with the foot;lights before it, and feeling that the situation was just the
kind of thing for him to have done justice to? Amateurs are always awkward, and the
Count DE CHAMBORD cannot, have been as much at home in this part, of the performance
as a man like Gom ERSAL would have been, who has been accustomed all-his life to beat his
own bosom, rush into all sorts of arms, cling round all kinds of necks, and turn back the hair
from all sorts of foreheads, with every species of shriek, from the high soprano of joy to the
double-bass of the deepest misery. - --- -
Where then, we again ask, is GomeRSAL * There seems to be an empire awaiting him,
if he will only pack up his carpet-bag, pay his fare by the boat, and
old adherent to the Empire (at ASTLEy's), the evergreen WIDDIcomb. The latter will only
be required to place his hand on his heart, and illustrate les dour sourenirs, while Gomersal
has only to run his eye over the prompt-book of the Amphitheatre; refresh his recollection
about the different cues; look at his dictionary of dates with reference to Austerlitz, and all
that sort of thing; get his nose into good snuff-taking order; borrow a pair of imperial |
eagles from Astley’s property-man; take a few lessons in French pronunciation; stuff
his pockets with a few of the old crosses of the Legion of Honour which he used to
distribute among the supernumeraries; and, thus prepared, we will back him against any-
one for creating a favourable impression among Frenchmen at the present moment. -
WIDDIcomb must, of course, equip himself as a French Field-Marshal; but as there is, no
doubt, a pair of NEY's breeches, a coat of KELLERMAN's, and a cocked-hat of MoRTIER's, in
the wardrobe of the Theatre, there will be no difficulty in rigging out the veteran according
to the traditions si touchantes of la grande armée. If WIDDIcomb's cocked-hat and feather
should not go directly home to every Frenchman's heart, and if GomeRs.AL's redingote does
not appear rampante in every Frenchman's eye, we are no judges of the Gallic character. .
THE CAMBRIDGE BUBBLE.
WHAT is the true gauge of “feelings?” Is it, in the case before us, the breeches'-pocket?
The Committee for the Cambridge Monument in smoke (for it will be of no more enduring
material than that which puffs and rolls from the kitchen chimney of the London Tavern)
—the Committee, speaking through E. F. LEERs (name of congenial greenness), Hon. Sec.,
assure the placid public that, they “are anxious to collect” money enough, “to raise that
description of monument which do equal justice to their own feelings, and,” &c. &c. Does
not this leave the style of monument a matter of profound mystery? o is to judge of the
architectural order best illustrative of the feelings of a Committee ? Why, do they not
at once publish specimens that we might judge of, and, if possible, sympathise with the
architectural symbol of human emotions as living in the breasts of Committee men, many of
wºme." it is elsewhere promised as a pleasant bribe, “will be inscribed upon the
estal.”
The plate will serve as an ample tablet for the names of the Chairmen and Secretaries of
the Committees, whilst at the same time it will illustrate the persevering means employed
to collect subscriptions. The knife and fork will stand keenly and pointedly epigrammatic
of not a few of the unwearied services of the late Duke of CAMBRIDGE in the cause of
e with him, as an ||
charity. Poor, good Duke ' What a shame it is
that a man—because a Duke—cannot have passed
decently and good-naturedly through life, eating
the fattest thereof, and drinking of the richest
and rarest – without being monstered into a
hilanthropist, hardly second to PROMETHEUs!
f these matters are known in the shades, the
Duke—with all his sublimated good-temper, can
hardly take it as a compliment that his proposed
monument is to be little other than a sort of
card-tray to hold “the names of the Chairmen
and the Secretaries” of money-begging Com-
mittees. -
Reader, you may have seen a busy fellow in-
tent upon a statue—the figure of Fame, Hope, or
Charity. Was he rapt by the beauty of the statue
in the abstract—was he touched by reverence
for the quality it figured? And now he has
walked away, and you walk, and then, close to
the statue, pause in his footsteps; when, look-
ing, you behold scrawled on the garment hem of
Charity—“John GUBBINs, GENt.” Now, GUB-
BINs is the chairman or secretary to a CAM-
BRIDGE Monument Committee.
THE RENOVATION OF THE THAMES.
THAMEs, King of Streams—at last, it seems—
Thy bosom’s to be drained of
That perilous stuff of dingy buff
Which we’ve so long complained of:
And putrid loam and filthy foam
No more shall clog the river,
Where darts shall not be longer shot
From fell Miasma’s quiver.
Its, waves no more shall, reeking, pour,
Toothick almost to ripple,
With what, right sure, makes good manure,
But very nasty tipple,
Vivacious all, the eels shall crawl
The fresh and wholesome sludge on,
Whose present stench would e'en kill tench,
And has destroyed the gudgeon.
The swans shall ii. upon a tide
Sweet as a nut—or sweeter—
Swall-hoppers, too, shall swans pursue,
'Mid fragrance 'stead of fetor.
Inº the gladsome lark
he pure stream will admit on,
Off Rotherhithº, as fresh and blithe
As º. Thames Ditton.
Off Puddledock—the early cock
His sprightly clarion blowing—
Shall bathers dive, like fun alive,
"Mid waters crystal-flowing;
Which, now too queer for making beer
At Chelsea Reach, by Jingol
Shall, at Blackwall, brew strong or small;
The best of swipes, or stingo.
And tea to make shall housewives take
The stream as low as Deptford,
ow running there, corrupt as eler
Was Stockbridge, or East Retford.
The town first named for trout is famed,
Good three or º lumpers;
The trout there sell almost as well
As whilom sold the plumpers;
And London trout—the Thames cleaned out—
As hard shall strain our tackle;
And Bridge below the angler throw
Deftly the killing hackle.
Nay, as for fish—exclaim not “Pish l’”
Reply not “Stuff!” or “Gammon | *
Just caught, hard by, yourself and I
At Greenwich shall eat salmon.
HOB AND NOB.
“THE Hebrew mind,” said Hob, in his short
hammer-upon-mail way, “as developed with us,
no notion of wit, no regard for humour.”
“Nevertheless,” said the good-natured Nob,
“you must allow this much—the Jew has a won-
derful sense of interest.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PARLLAMENTARY JOE MILLER.
ATELY we spoke of an amusing little book
bearing the above title, and the following
are some choice extracts therefrom. They
will be found to be the best bon-mots
uttered during the late Session.
“MR. BRIGHT said that the eloquence of the Hon.
Member for Tiverton was very much like travelling
through a railway tunnel. It was some two or three
miles long—and profoundly dark from one end to
another. The House had listened in perfect silence
—in the hopes of hearing or seeing something—but
it was only when the Hon. Member had reached the
extreme end of his long tunnel, that the House
began to perceive a little daylight. He must say,
that no engine in the present Ministry had the
talent of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, for
dragging people with such extraordinary rapidity
through the dark." (Laughter, and cries of “Order.”)
“MR. REYNolds took the liberty to remark that
certain Members were in the habit of making
speeches, in the same way that PENELopk did her
Berlin wool-work (laughter); that is to say, they spun
a long yarn in the morning, and picked it to pieces again in the evening, or the next day.
The monster yarn about the Sunday Post-Office was a yarn of this description—and
much as he complimented the Hon. Member for the City of London for the ingenuity
with which he had spun it together, still, it was nothing to the admiration he felt for the
cleverness his Lordship had afterwards displayed in picking his own handiwork to
pieces.” (Roars of laughter, in which Lord John heartily joined.)
“MR. Dish AELI said, that the CHANCELLoR of the Excheques had such a wonderful
talent for persuading people, that, if he went in search of the North Pole, he would only
have, on his return, to flourish his walking-stick in the eyes of half a dozen Members,
and say, ‘Gentlemen, this is the North Pole,' and the House, in the boundlessness of its
faith, would believe it.” (General laughter.)
“SERJEANT MURPHY boldly told the Hon. Member for Limerick that there was this
difference between him and his father—that, whereas DANIEl O'Connell was the
Ophicleide of agitation, he (John O'Connell) was merely the penny whistle." (Long-
continued laughter.)
“Mr. Qsbohse said Mr. Unqun ART's speeches seemed always to be copied after
one model,-'A Railway Guide.' They were always full of the closest figures,--and were
quite as interesting—and they had this further resemblance, that it was utterly
impossible in either to find out a single thing you wanted." (A laugh.)
“Colos EL Sibthorp always trembled when the Hon. Member for Manchester rose to
speak. He could only compare his seasations to the alarm he felt when he first saw
BAkon NATHAN dance the hornpipe amongst the tea things—he made sure that every
minute the Hon. Member would put his foot in it." (Loud Laughter.)
“MR. DRUMMosd called the Colonial Secretary the “lightning conductor of Powning
Street'. He was continually bringing down the lightning that played over Ministers
heads, but then, he saved their lives. His position in the Ministry, he was confident,
was merely to draw off the thunder that had accumulated in the overcharged politicai
atmosphere.”
“Lord John reminded him" (said MR. Cobden) “of the celebrated little mouse in
the nursery-legend of “Dickory, Dickory, Dock,' which, with the permission of the
House, he would now recite:—
“Dickory, Dickory, Dock,
The mouse ran up the clock;
The clock struck one,
And down he run,
Dickory, Dickory, Dock.'
(Laughter.)
“Now, what had Loan John done all this Session? He had merely run up the Par-
liamentary clock, and what for? why, for no other purpose, it could not faii to strike
one, than to run down again." (Long-continued laughter.
We might give many more bright examples of the Collective Wit of
the country, for they are as numerous as the paving stones of London,
but we are sure the reader will cry with us, “Hold! Enough.”
HOW WILL GLASS AFFECT THE HUMAN FRAME?
“DEAR SIR,
... I cannot tell you how glad I am that the glass dome of the
grand building for the Exhibition of Industry is not to be erected, for
it would have been my duty to stand under that monster dome ten
hours every day. I do not know whether glass cases have the same
effect º the human frame as they do upon cucumbers. At all events,
I should have dreaded the experiment, for I am already six feet two
and I have no doubt that before the Exhibition had been over, I shoul
ave grown to that extent that it would have been requisite to cut a
hole in the roof to enable me to put my head through—unless I had
laid down upon my back, in which case it would have been dreadful to
contemplate where my legs might not have stretched to As it is, I am
half afraid of MR.Paxton's plan, as that is to consist mostly of glass—
and the result will be for those inside, I suspect, anything but ‘as cool
as a cucumber. However, I shall keep an accurate register of my
height, and if I find it to become a growing evil, I shall make an application
to the Committee that my salary shall rise every week in proportion to
myself, as I am not going to stand (ten hours a day) having the ‘rise
taken. Qut of me by inches, without being paid for it.
“Will you be kind enough, Sir, to put my fears before the eye of the
public, for the experiment of shutting a man in a large glass case
never been tried fore, and I happen, I am sorry to say, to be

NExT YEAR's ExHIBITION.”
THE TRUSTWORTHY GUIDE TO LONDON.
WE have received a communication in the form of a printed circular,
marked “Private and Confidential,” and signed with the name of an
Irish gentleman. It embodies the prospectus of a new Guide to
London, to be brought out in January next, under the title of
“WHAT'S WHATP
IN 1851.”
“What’s What?” we are informed, will be published with a view to
the vast influx of foreigners that may be expected next year, both in
French and English, and
“Will contain a guide to every place worth visiting, and EveRY TRADING
Establish MENT where Purchases can be Most ReasonABLY AND satisfactorily
MADE. It will recommend readers where to seek every article connected with his
sic) wants and requisitions—of taste, luxury, and utility. These recommendations
will be printed in both languages; and, of course, only those gentlemen with whom
Private arrangements are made, will be mentioned.”
The mention of a “gentleman’s” name in “What's What?” or the
“name only of any Establishment” will cost 5s; and for “recommen-
dation occupying one page,” the charge is five guineas. A blank form
of application for the insertion of advertisements, which, in the indivi-
...? document before us, has been filled up by a gentleman named
GREEN, completes the money-trap. -
As the value of any recommendation is a matter of some little
importance, it may be as well for purchasers to know that the good
word of “What’s. What?” is worth from a crown to £5 5s. Such
tradesmen as are disposed to think the commodity worth the price, had
better follow the example of MR. GREEN; who has kindly permitted us
to use the influence of his name in putting both customers and dealers
up to “What’s What?”
ROYAL ADDENDA.
WE have a statue in London to the DUKE of KENT.
We have, as every Englishman knows to his shame, a statue to the
DUKE of York.
We have a beautiful statue of GeoRGE THE FourTH.
We have a pig-tailed statue of GEORGE THE THIRD.
We have a pale plum-pudding looking statue of WILLIAM THE
FourTH.
We are promised a statue of the “Good DUKE” of CAMBRIDGE.
Why not complete the list, and have statues erected to every member
of the Royal Family? Two members at present are sadly missing.
Accordingly, we, propose that subscriptions be instantly made for the
following laudable objects:—
A STATUE TO THE Duke of Sussex.-We are sure he deserves it
as much as the DUKE QF KENT, and a great deal more than the “First
gentleman in Europe,” who sits in Trafalgar Square without any
trousers on. ---
AND A STATUE TO THE DUKE of CUMBERLAND.—We are positive
he is as deserving of it quite as much as the DUKE of York, and that
his statue could not fail to give pleasure to all classes.
A Vacancy for a Public Man.
VICTOR Hugo, in a beautiful speech, recently delivered in Paris,
said, “Great men make their own pedestals: Posterity places their
statues upon them.” This is precisely the case with the pedestal in
Trafalgar Square. -
Posterity to place the statue upon it.
THERE's No PRESERVE LIKE IT.

there is only one kind of preserve, as far as we know, in which it is used
at all,—and that is, in sea-bathing—which, we are all aware, is recom:

THE domestic misery occasioned by the closing of the Sunday post
has been acknowledged even to the avowed shame of some of the

last, ſº the day on which the post was re-opened, LoRD AsHLEY
would do penance in St. George's Church, in a huge white sheet of

collected, in the expectation of seeing his lordship, who, however,
did not appear.

PUNCH*S ROYAL PROGRESSES.
THE PROGRESS TO OSTEND.
Being an Epistle from the HoNou RABLE CoNsTANCE BLANK,
Maid-of-Honour, to the LADY BLANCHE Four STARs.
THANK NEPTUNE, dear BLANCHE, we are once more at Osborne!
How little your CoNSTANCE eer fancied she was born
To be lady-in-waiting on board the steam-yacht-
But at last my turn came, and I fairly was caught— .
Entre mous, though HER MAJESTY 'scapes the commotion,
To which most of her subjects are subject on ocean,
She might just consider the suff'rings which we women
Feel aboard ship, who are not such great sea-women—
And one knows ere one starts—which is rery consoling,
The Wictoria and Albert’s a sad boat for rolling. -
Well—this time, they made a mere run to Qstend of it-- . .
But, short though the voyage, how I longed for the end of it!
My state-room is fitted up couleur de rose,
But what’s that, when one’s heaving in sea-sickness's throes?
What's the use of gilt mouldings and maple-wood panel,
While one's life is a mere toss up in the Channel?
With the engine throb—throbbing in tune with one's head,
And the waves keeping up a swish—swish by one's bed.
Of course, my love, eating was out of the question,
One shuddered, you know, at the simple suggestion-
So for twelve hours, as wretched as wretched could
Your CoNSTANCE lay tossing—and so did the sea.
Till on Thursday at nine, to the joy of your friend,
I was told we were heaving in sight of Ostend; -
And heaving in sight on't (you won't feel a doubt of it).
Was good news to one who’d been long heaving out of it.
So I huddled my things on, abom’nably fast,
And managed to scramble on deck, love, the last!
Where I found all the party (of course not the QUEEN),
Looking what dear Lord GADABout called a sea-green.
And we saw, as we gazed tow’rds the land from the poop,
About half-a-mile of what looked like pea-soup;
And then the low line of the Dykes, as they call 'em
With which from the sea these low country folks wall 'em ;
With such little soldiers, their gallant defenders,
And clustered behind 'em the worthy Ostenders.
For every house, up from area to attic,
Was set full of faces so fixed and phlegmatic, -
You’d have fancied these staid Flemish cits and their wives
Had seen a º land every day of their lives; .
And no wonder, for when we steamed up to the jetty, (new
Scoured down for the day), without any retinue,
KING LEopold, walked in plain olive surtout,
And welcomed the Queen with a “How d'ye do?”
And then the Prince Consort, and then the Princesses;
Then the Princes, (so meat in their man-o’-war dresses)
And then turned about, quite sans façon, to greet
With a welcome to Fºl. poor us of the suite.
In short, my dear creature, you never did see
A royal rencontre so sans cérémonie;
And had it not been for the little sº
Who stood up in their stocks, like small boys in the pillory—
And rather more crowd in the town than you’re wont in it
To find, when you land here, en route for the Continent—
And the flags and the gay carillons from each steeple,
You’d have thought it a meeting of every day people.
And then we drove off, in a brace of landaus,
To the funniest palace that ever you saw ;
A plain yellow house, in a plain yellow street,
With an ugly square door and square windows en suite;
And, sºle sign of royalty, each side the entry,
A small sentry-box, with a still smaller sentry.
And then, love, to think for a moment that tie uphold
That beautiful Claremont for poor dear KING Leopold,
At some twenty thousand a year, while at home
º 're quartered in this style—no wonder they roam
And one sees, when one has the Court Circular {.
How the King and the Queen of the Belgians have landed
At Woolwich, or Folkstone, or Ramsgate, or Dover,
Poor things | When in England they must feel in clover !
But I must do the dear King the justice to say
He did all he could for our party that day.
We walked on the ramparts, went back, dined, and then?
Iet’s see-yes—we walked on the ramparts again;
For unless you go into the . love, you know,
The rampart's the only place left you to go;
ut, conceive, after dinner, on counting the heads,
His Majesty found he could not give us beds;
Qnly think, love, a king whom his subjects adore, "
nd not six spare bed-rooms for friends come ashore—
They did talk of putting LoRD GLUMP in the stable,
Thought GADABOUT might rough it under the table—
And, for my part, I’d rather have slept on the floor,
Than have gone to that horrible steamer once more, .
But HER MAJESTY quite º all our demurrings,
Though we offered to pack ourselves close as red-herrings;
And declared, since the palace room couldn’t afford,
We must all of us put up with beds, love, on board.
Of what that night was I won’t try a description—
But one thing I will say—that never in ...'s
Not the horriblest picture that dear Eugen E SUE,
Or that darling DUMAs, in his wildest, e'er drew,
(And on uncooked pork-chops I’d allow you to sup, too.)
That horrible night of ours ever came up to; -
LORD GLUMP, poor wretch, retching, and heaving, and sighing-
LoRD GADABout firmly convinced he was dying-
LADY MELLON confessing her small peccadilloes-
And I giving up my whole soul to the billows.
They say in a cottage bliss may be your lot;
In a cottage it may be, but ne'er in a cot;
And how oft through the night as I struggled for breath,
I fancied that berth, love, would sure be my death.
Yes, I felt, I believe, dissolution at hand,
When, at last, to the comfort of all, we made land
And Her Mºsty º ashore, fresh as a rose–
But how we all looked I leave you to suppose. . .
* you ne'er know what 'tis, love, at sea to be ill–
But if they continue these voyages still- -
I'll resign—I’m resolved—let Pasay what he will !
a thousand adieus—and write soon, dear, to thank,
For her long lucubration, your own CoNSTANCE BLANK!
“ HOUSEKEEPER WANTED.”
THE following advertisement is so deliciously cool—cool as the
weather—that we give it in its entirety to our readers. It is taken
from the Esser Standard of the 23rd ult.:-
OUSEKEEPER WANTED. — The Advertiser (without any family)
wishes to meet with a respectable Female, of limited income, who would be willing
to act as Housekeeper, and pay him Ten Pounds a year towards the expenses of a com-
fortable home.—Apply, by letter, , Essex Standard Office, Colchester.
Times are changed, indeed! Servants are now called upon to pay
their masters. We were painfully aware that governesses were often
made by cruel necessity to give their time, trouble, and talents for
nothing, but that a housekeeper should be publicly solicited to É. ten
pounds a-year to her master surpasses everything we have ever heard in
this brazen age of impudence. We wonder this Colchester native, who
seems to be dreadfully close in “shelling out,” did not ask for a suit of
clothes as well, by way of a livery, for it is but right, since he is ready
to accept wages, that he should don the proper costume of a servant. He
talks of a “comfortable home.” Delicious comforts they must be, when
purchased with the means of his poor dependents | Why, he must be at
the mercy of his housekeeper; and if he said anything harsh-and,
judging from what we already know of his character, we should say
that he would be very capable of the greatest harshness—she wºuld be

all his servants are hired upon the same terms!, If his Cook gives him
five pounds a year, and his housemaid three, and his scullery-maid finds

DANGERS OF OMNIBUS TRAVELLING.
“DEAR SIR,
“I AM a great Omnibus Traveller—not by necessity but, b
choice. Omnibuses are crowded, and probably always will be crowded,
with nuisances; but of all nuisances nome are so sharp, or being so
continually thrust in gentlemen's faces, as, ladies' parasols. I have
noticed that every lady who enters an omnibus is sure to bring in a
parasol with her. She may not carry abundle, either dead or alive, in
the shape of a baby, -she may, perhaps, be without a bird-cage, she
may, by some curious chance, be free from everything in the shape of
luggage, beyond a small reticule no bigger than a gentleman's carpet-
bag, but I have never yet seen the phenomenon of a lady invading an
omnibus without her being duly armed with a parasol!
“Now the parasol, Sir, is the most formidable weapon of defence
(and offence too, as I am prepared to prove) drawn from the female
arsenal of warfare. A woman without her parasol would be defenceless
indeed! If a lady is annoyed by a dog or a beggar, or pursued by a
mad bull, or insulted by any one in the street, the first implement
brought into action is invariably the parasol. There are other means of
female protectioniſam aware, which are not unfrequently had recourse
to by #. female hand, but I maintain that it is invariably “The Parasol
first; Nails afterwards.”
“But in an omnibus, this “Female Life Preserver, for so I call the
parasol, is only used as a .*. of offence (unless a lady has more than
the usual share of pride, and hides her face with her parasol, for fear of
being seen by any of her Belgravian acquaintances inside an omnibus!)
and a most offensive weapon it is too!
“Why, the nuisance obtrudes itself every where; you cannot sit
down, but a lady is sure to exclaim, “Oh! Please, Sir, take care of my
ol!’ You cannot arrange your legs, any how, without an over-
grown umbrella (but which, by courtesy, is promoted to the rank of a
parasol) finding itself between them; and you are asked by the lady
opposite “if you are aware that is her parasolº', You cannot turn to
# right or to the left, but there is certain to be at either turn the
point of a parasol ready to dot your eye. If you are sitting at the end
seat it is fifty times worse. You are then sitting in a prickly bush of
parasols; or, to come nearer the mark, your head seems to be revolving
inside a large wheel, of which the ladies' parasols are the spokes, and
your nose the axle.

ANOTHER PUNCHAT PUNCH*S
RAILWAY.
... The shareholders of our own dear
little railway at Kensington are again
indulging some wild and fantastic
ideas of getting their line “worked,”
as if we had not worked it pretty
well for them to all intents º pur-
oses. Their present
hopes are
ounded upon the vague idea that
some sort of traffic may º be
developed by the Exhibition of 1851;
but we regretto say that we must
once more smash the expectations of
this small suburban concern, for we are
bound to declare thatarailway between
Wormwood Scrubs and Warwick
uare—the one a barren waste, the
other a cul de sac of private houses—
cannot be made *†: for Exhibi-
tional purposes. Supposing, even,
that the Wormwoodites were to en-
deavour to furnish specimens of the
industry of the Scrubs—by the manu-
|. of scrubbing-brushes, for ex-
ample — their transfer to Warwick
Square would not bring them much
nearer to Hyde Park than they were

power—the cart of Pope, the local
carrier—would still be required to com-
plete the transit. With reference to
º: traffic, the public coming
om town would have to a mile
and a half beyond the Exhibition be-
fore they got to the Railway by which
it is proposed to carry them, and
when carried, they would still be a
mile and a half from where they wish
to go to.
ladies' The narrow avenue is screened by a bristling palisade of
arasols, piled together like the elephants’ tusks, only much more
ormidable, you see at the entrance of anatomical museums; or all
touching at the top, like the points of bayonets on a stand of musketry.
Unless you have the º: of ARNOLD voN WINKELRIER, and allow
them all to meet in your breast, as that patriotic martyr did with the
Austrian lances, you may depend upon it an opening never will be made
in the enemy's ranks. Really it is not e carrying an omnibus at
the point of the bayonet.
“The difficulty of coming out is no less great! You have the same
thicket to traverse, and you are lucky if you escape without a single
wound; scratches innumerable, you must expect to have, for no lady
ever dreams that her parasol is in the way, or that it is unpleasant for a
entleman to have it sticking in his whisker. I would not complain so
É. on this head-I mean my own—but latterly, the ferules of
ladies’ parasols have become considerably sharper, and now they have
arrived at a point of perfection that is really unendurable. They are
made of ivory, which is sharpened finer than any Whitechapel needle,
and I must say, for one, that it..". me a violent turn, and quite runs
through me, whenever I am made to give an eye, not to one needle,
but to a whole packet of such needles in the course of a day. My eyes
are filled at the mere thoughts of it!
“Sir, I am the last man who would attempt to interfere with the
amusements of any one, more especially the ies; but I would
propose that a notice be affixed to all omnibuses, delicately intimati
that “No BABIEs or PARAsoils will BE ApNitten AT ANY PRICE;
or, if this law be too severe to be ever enforced, that the conductor
be empowered to take away a lady's Ql upon her entering the
omnibus, and putting it out of the reach of ". in a parasol stand,
similar to the one they have at the National Gallery, which should be
kept at the door of every omnibus. I would advise that the charge of
one penny be made for everyº so detained, and by these strong
means, the nuisance, I am confident, would soon be abated; for I have
observed that ladies are infinitely more sensitive in their pockets than
gentlemen. It requires a much stronger muscular power in the arm of
a woman to open her purse than in that of a man. Levy, then, this
tax of a penny upon every parasol, and I live in the hope that ladies'
Fº º effectually, put down in every omnibus, without SIR
ETER LAURIE being called in, a remedy which might be almost as bad
as the evil. - - - -

“This morning HER MAJEsty, accompanied by PRINCE ALBERT, took her customary
walk upon the slopes.”
Wherever HER MAJESTY goes, the above paragraph is sure to follow
her. It must annoy her almost as much as those salutes which they will
fire after her, as if the only way of catching the royal ear was by firing
above ubiquitous paragraph was at Castle Howard, and if HER MAJESTY
ascended Ben Nevis, or visited the Giant's Causeway, or took a trip
to the Hebrides, we almost believe that the next morning's account
would inform us that
“The QUEEN, and PRINCE ALBERT, after breakfast, took their usual morning walk
upon the slopes.”
To do justice, however, to the much-abused editor of the Court Circular,
we must say that he does sometimes neglect to record the valuable fact.
For instance, very recently, when the QUEEN went to Ostend, no
- For two, nay
three consecutive days, neither the §. nor PRINCE ALBERT
“walked upon the slopes.” Accuracy like this is its own praise, when
oyal personages were on board the Royal Yacht.
The stage had neither sound nor tread,
SoNTAG and WIARDoT are fled,
GRISI and all are dumb.
E’em Le Prophète, that |. stood,
With music loud and high,
Has, like a storm, passed by.
Les Huguenots their work have done,
Finished is La Tempesta’s run,
Still'd is CARLOTTA’
For the last time LABLACHE appears,
No longer through a thousand ears
His wondrous notes shall flow.
Come! let the curtain quickly fall,
Procrastination’s vain;
Before the lights we will not call
SEASON. (AFTER CAMPBELL)
On Covent Garden's well-known track,
I sorrowfully turn my back;
No bouquets now I need.
Pinks, roses, jonquils, are ..
They lie unsold on shopman's board,
wondrous good, Or run—uncut—to seed.
About the Park I cast my eyes,
The sight they meet is dire;
A dismal row of shabby flys,
Let—by the job—on hire; -
The cab that speaks a dearth of cash,
Striving in vain to cut a dash,
With broken-winded mag.
I can’t remain—adieu, Pall Mall;
The Boulogne boat to-morrow shall
Receive my carpet bag.

THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER.
The CoMTE DE CHAMBORD is all but given up by the Legitimist
party in France. They pay a pilgrimage to a desired HENRY CINQ, and
they find the poorest creature: a mere fussy thing of recollections and
traditions, about as fit for the world in its progress, as the memory
of Louis THE FOURTEENTH-could it be reproduced—to dance, a
saraband. Nevertheless, though Legitimist France despair of her king
of bran and tiffany, our own Morning Post has at confidence in the
ńliºd male dºll of St. Louis's, and º ue homage to “that
charm of voice and manner, the peculiar and inestimable quality of his
ace.”
Now, if the voice and manner of HENRICINQ be so potent for fasci.
nation, why does he keep in idleness the miraculous #. Why does
he not begin in earnest to charm the serpents of the Republic, making
no more of them than our Mussulman friend in the ºf. Gardens
makes of his snakes, hooded and rattle?.. But the days of miracles are
gone; especially of miracles courtly. Once j it was believed
that legitimate kings could touch away evil: but now, and even in
their own case, somehow—despite voice and manner—the evil will
stick.
A TIMELY COINAGE.
THE people of Sheffield have voted an address to LoRD John
RUSSELL praying him to cause an increased issue of copper: more
farthings, halfpence, and, penny-pieces. The premier should look to
this; especially if—as in the case of MRs. Waghoº N—it may be found
necessary to give pensions to the widows of men of genius. Farthings
may be wanted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PEACE CONGRESS,
ow the world would st
it not for the follies of the hair-
brained and enthusiastic | Hap-
pily, they now and then make the
sides of the grave and wise to shake
with wholesome laughter; even
though the aforesaid gravity and
wisdom quick subside into com-
assion—profoundest pity of the
tº. jians. How many laughs has
wisdom º at the cost of
speculative folly!
There was one HERVEY, who
avouched a discovery of the circula:
tion of the blood. And the world
laughed, and then rebuked him ;
ºf...", his outrageous non-
sense—punished him by depriving
him of his practice.
There was one JENNER, who—having speculated upon the hands of
certain dairy-maids, theorised upon vaccine virus—and declared that
in the cow he had found a . for small-pox. And the world
shouted; and the wags were especially droll—forételling, in their excess
; yº fancies, the growth of cow's horns from the heads of vaccinated
ables.
When it was declared that our streets should be illuminated by
ignited coal-gas—the gas to flow under our feet—the world laughed;
and then, checked in its merriment, stoutly maintained that some night
London, from end to end, would be blown up. WINSOR-the gas-man
—was only a more tremendous GUY FAWKES.
When the experimental steam-boat was first essayed at Blackwall,
and went stern foremost, the river rang with laughter. There never
was such a waterman's holiday. -
When STEPHENsoN was examined by the Parliamentary sages upon a
railway project by which desperate people were to travel at the rate of,
aye, fifteen miles an hour, the Quarterly Review laughed a sardonic
laugh, asking, with killing irony, “Would not men as soon be shot out
of a gun, as travel by such means?” -
And when, last week, the Peace Congress met at Frankfort, did not
the wise ones laugh at the tinkering pacificators—the simple ones in
broad-brim and drab They met in St. Paul’s Church (did they pa
twopence?) and tiger HAYNAU listened to them, and was not there an
ate, were
then changed to a lamb; neither was a single piece of cannon turned,
by the eloquence of the talkers, into honey.
The wise world has laughed at the circulation of the blood—at gas—
at steamboats—at railways. Why should not the world enjoy its horse-
collar grin at the preachers of peace? Why should not arbitration
(until an accepted principle) be quite as ridiculous (until triumphant)
as vaccination? If JENNER was a quack, why should not the dove—
the symbol of peace—be pronounced a most fabulous goose?
Meanwhile, and only a few hours after the departure of the Peace
Congress from Frankfort, England and France are tied together by the
electric wire, and the lightning carries messages between the nations—
the natural enemies! K. electric wire from Dover to Cape Grisnez!
What a line of comment on the laughers |
-----
Childish Cries.
It is very strange that the cry which gives the most offence in a
Republic, should be “Aire la R publique.” Yet the popularity of the
President of a Republic has been tested, during a recent trip, by the
prevalence, or absence, of that cry. Louis-NAPOLEoN himself would
not shake hands with a man, because he shouted it in his ear. His
followers actually kicked a man out of the room because he dared to
raise that republican cry in the presence of their republican chief—and
so on, through theatres, balls, fields, reviews, and Préfectures. France
lately has been doing nothing but cry, cry, cry, from morning to night,
and, like a pet child, rather too much attention has been paid to its
crying. We cannot help thinking that a nation has arrived to a strange
childish state when it is always crying; and, really, like a child, does
not know what it is crying for.
Widow Waghorn's Pension.
THE Government has recently added £15 to the previous £25 pension
to the widow of the man who first brought. India within a few weeks of
England. £25 and then £15. “The quality of mercy is not strained,”
says SHAKSPEARE. The quality of government, reward is not strained
either. “No,”, says the Minister, tapping his red-box, “it is not
strained—it is filtered.”
A NOWELTY IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER.
SEPTEMBER is not generally the month of novelties. It is a month
of unbroken London dullness, when a Singing Mouse would be wel-
comed with the delight almost of a JENNY LIND. We were astonished,
therefore, at being told of a novelty in Regent Street, that was sur-
§ the one or two loungers that are still left in town. Scarcely
elieving this rumour, which we feared was too good to be true, we
wended our way to that highly-deserted locality, editing in our minds
the choice little dinner, which we determined upon having, by way of
consolation, at WEREY’s, in case we should be disappointed.
We reached the Cosmorama Rooms, and, to our delight, really did
find a novelty. We bounded upstairs, and rushed madly into a room
when a wild'African, flourishing a spear over his head, suddenly checked
our exuberance. e were about to leave the place, half-disappointed,
and more than half-terrified, when a black lady, about the § of
MR. Robert KEELEY, stalked majestically into the room, carrying a
big pitcher on her head. A glance at her dress, which consisted of an
immense buffalo's hide ornamented with large brass mails, induced us
to remain. Another glance at her ears convinced us we had really dis-
covered a novelty—so great a novelty, indeed, that it would make the
fortune of the proprietor, if everybody but ourselves had not unfor-
tunately left town.
This black lady carries her snuff-box in her ears, and wipes her eyes
with an egg-spoon. Isn't this a novelty? and yet it is perfectly true.
The snuff is º into a tube exactly like a needle-case, and this needle-
case, no broader than a lady’s little finger, is thrust through the fleshy part
of her ear, where it hangs as a sort of ear-ring. She never sneezes, but
crles º: collecting her tears in a sort of bone spoon, which she
rubs up and down her eyelids for the purpose. This young lady is very
interesting, notwithstanding the habit she has contracted of taking
snuff, and might be called pretty, if it were not for her hair, which she
rubs over with a kind of red paint, for it seems that red hair is con.
sidered in South Africa very beautiful, and is all the fashion with the
natives. This hair hangs in little red worsted curls, and does not add,
we think, to the lady’s beauty. She is sixteen years of age—sweet
sixteen—and dances with bare feet, singing as she stamps the floor.
}. e are sorry we cannot say much either for her singing or her
ancing.
†iusband is the wild African gentleman who frightened us so much
on our entrance. He comes from the Cape, and has brought a very
º: one with him, in the shape of foxes' tails, which hang round
is neck like so many ladies’ cast-off boas, not two of the same length,
and give him the appearance of the most eccentric fur-reigner we ever
saw. He is very good-natured, and wears large brass bed-curtain rings
on both his naked arms.
His great pride, however, is his hair. Hair-dressing at the Cape must
be a profitable business, for every native seems to devote his head to
nothing else. e never saw such hair. It is worked and stitched,
and beeswaxed up most elaborately into a perfect bowl on the top of his
head—and you imagine that it must have been arranged to catch balls,
such as you see conjurors do in the street. It must be very incon-
venient in rainy weather, for the bowl must get full of water, and the
Zuloo (for he comes from that “hair” tribe) must stand on his head, if
he wishes to empty it.
There is another native, still more good-natured than the other two.
He wears, a regal mantle of Kangaroo-skins, and carries a bundle of
spears in his hand, as a beadle carries his staff. He is very good-looking
has a faultless figure, worthy of a copper Apollo, but we are asham
to say, he paints—and the painting is not done with a very artistic hand
either, for it is smeared all over his nose, his eyebrows, and his forehead,
in a style that does not say much for the delicacy of his touch. The
colour, too, which is used, is a r brick-dust, and the effect of carrots
on the top of chocolate (for such is the colour of his complexion) is not
very charming. His hair is likewise discoloured by this anchovy-coloured
tincture. We are told that he lived “in the bush.” We are sure, then,
from the colour he has brought away all over him, that it must have
been a red-currant bush. No Republican can be more Rouge than he is.
The exhibition, however, is a most interesting one. You are brought
in contact, hand-in-hand, with these simple-hearted natives, and they
laugh with you in the most familiar manner, without waiting for the
absurd formality of an introduction, You may pull them about as you
like—they only grin, and show their beautiful white teeth. Their
tractability is most wonderful, for they obey the H. in the most
willing, loving manner, when they might transfix him in a moment with
One f their spears, if they chose.
Altogether we have not seen so great a novelty for a long time—and
it is extraordinary how it can have come to light in this dark, empty,
month of September. Out of sympathy with those poor unfortunate
creatures, who are detained in town like ourselves, we publish the fact,
and advise them to pass a dreary hour in laughing with the handsome
Kaffir, and taking snuff with the good-natured Zuloo, and his
Amaponda-ry wife, who are at present lodging on a first-floor in
Regent Street.

MARRY.
N the present occasion,
Mr. Punch offers his feli-
citating compliments,
Mr. Punch feeling that
†T.
º the interests of the blissful
º rite of marri are best
honoured and advanced
by a serious and faithful
#. thereof, begs to
inform the nuptial world
that marriages—(when the
breakfasts are satisfactorily
splendid, and the cakes
punctually attended.
Mr. Punch is induced to
offer himself, and to throw
open his journal, to wed-
. (of the highest
consideration) from a sense
of impatience and dissatis-
faction at the manner in
which the most important
moment of human life is too
frequently dismissed by the
unreflecting and incapable.
Young ies are really
thrown away at the altar;
when, with a little judi-
cious treatment, they might
- be made a most attractive
feature in the public newspapers. Now, it is the purpose of Mr. Punch, either to
attend himself, or to give the necessary credentials to one of his young gentlemen,
who, capable of treating the ceremony like an artist, shall take care that brides,
like flowers, do not bloom to blush unseen; who shall wander from bouquet to
bouquet of the bridesmaids, like a honey-bee, and who shall be further warranted to
carry away in his eye every bonnet, cap, gown, jacket, visite, victorine, &c., &c., of
the party.
It § be the object of Mr. Punch to make the weddings of private families public
to the meanest capacity; and thereby carry out to the fullest a principle but poorly
attempted by certain brighton contemporaries. Mr. Punch subjoins a skeleton
specimen.
The ABODE OF THE BRIDE.
The morning sun glows on the climbing roses. The skylark, poised immediately
over the chimney, throws a gush of notes down the fireplace. e hearth, where
the infant feet of the bride, &c., &c. And still the lark sings, tira-lira, tira-lira, &c.
The GATHERING OF the NEIGHBOURHOOD.
The meadows are dotted with all classes of persons, mostly women. The dots
become lines—still women. The church-yard becomes crowded—and overflows, prin-
cipally with women.
INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH.
Not less than a hundred and fifty new bonnets—white, the prevailing colour.
School-children anxious and mottled in the gallery; Silence is so profound that the
watch of the clerk is heard convulsively ticking. Moment of intense excitement. The
Church-door opens. It is the Bride! No-the Beadle. Has on a new pair of shoes
that creak despite of the aisle.
CONSIDERABLE SENSATION. The BRIDEGROOM AND HIS BROTHER.
... The bridegroom wears the mustachios of the Royal Sanguinary Buffs, and the
jingling of his spurs brings the colour to more than one fair cheek. It is remarked
that the bridegroom has bright buttons on his coat; and his brother, vindicating
his fraternity on so interesting an occasion, also has his buttons bright y
THE BRIDESMAIDs
The fourteen bridesmaids (the Misses ETCETERA) descend upon the church floor,
thereby disproving the old poetic error that Birds of Paradise do not touch the
ground. They are all drest in rainbow º with apple-blossom skirts of the Garden
of Eden, and it is further remarked by the casual spectator, that each of them has
in the words of the lamented BAYLEY, “Grace in her steps, heaven in her eye, an
in every gesture dignity and love.”
ARRIVAL OF THE BRIDE |
The Bride appears, and the organist in the loft is about to play God save the
Queen, he is so struck with the wonderful likeness of the interesting fiancée to HER
Most GRAcious MAJESTY; the bride being a sparkling brunette. She is drest in
a mist of orient silver, flounced with aphrodite lace. She wears the veil of the
morning, and is crowned with the apples of the Hesperides.
THE GROUP. -
Looking at the gorgeous group of distinguished friends that adorn this eventful
sufficiently tasteful)—are [i.
moment, we rejoice to observe the noble (here parties will
of course supply the proper names) and the excellent -,
and the gallant —, and the much-respected —,&c., &c.
THE CEREMONY.
The bride, whose colour comes and goes, but stops when
the ceremony is completed, behaves, with a fortitude that
must, could it be possible, still further endear her to her
now gallant lord. The ceremony is performed by Doctor
TYE, assisted by the REy. MR. KNott, and we were de-
lighted to hear that a relay of three more clergymen was
ready at a minute's summons, had such assistance been
deemed necessary.
EGRESS FROM THE CHURCH.
THE bride is led radiant from the altar, when the spec-
tators can no longer control their natural anxiety, but mob
the happy, pair; bidding defiance, to the efforts of the
ooming bridesmaids to rejoin their beauteous charge.
At the hour we go to press, three bridesmaids are missing;
which fact will, we trust, illustrate the quietude and decorum
with which fashionable marriages are at present acted
before HER MAJESTY's subjects.
THE WEDDING CAKE
Is carved with the sabre of F.M. The DUKE OF WELLING-
Ton; the Duke himself not being able to give the bride
away.
THE HOMOEOPATHIC SYSTEM OF REWARDS.
A KNIGHTHood has been offered to MR. STEPHENSQN,
and the honour courteously declined. We have a singular
scale of rewards in England. Lord Mayors are made
baronets by the dozen. Generals, who carry off victories in
India, are made lords and marquesses. A peerage is given
to a banker, from the overpowering merit which a million
sterling was supposed to confer upon him. And yet to an
Engineer, who occupies the first rank in his noble Fº
sion in England, perhaps in the world; to, a man who has
fought with Earth, Air, and Water, and left a beautiful
work upon each as a monument of his victory; to one
who has enriched his * with gifts of genius, such
as the Tubular Bridge, the High Level Bridge, and the
Border Bridge; the offer of a º: is made | If MR.
STEPHENson had been a tallow-chandler, and had had the
honour of opening the Temple Bar to HER MAJESTY during
one of her visits to the city; if he had been a Lord Mayor,
and had eaten a public dinner with PRINCE ALBERT; if he
had been the Attaché for years to some Hanwa Yard of
a German Principality, or the Complete Letter-Writer of
some grateful minister, a smaller compliment could not have
been paid to him We are glad that he sent back the
insulting offer, for we should have considered it a national
disgrace, and have grieved for it as a national sorrow, if
a man, like MR. STEPHENsoN, whose works, from their
magnitude and noble grandeur, are looked up to all over
the world, should have done anything § and mean to
have caused their author, and the science he honours, to be
looked down upon

Britannia ruling the Waves.
THIs extraordinary feat may be witnessed any day by
repairing to either of the Telegraph, offices, at Dover or
Calais, when the whole process of will be shown to
the stranger. At present, BRITANNIA only rules the waves |
with one line—but in a short time it is expected she will
become so perfect as to rule it with twenty or thirty lines.
In fact, it is considered that the ocean eventually will be
nothing but an immense copy-book, which BRITANNLA will
be continually ruling, the better to enable, historians, to
write her proud achievements upon it as well as assist her
in corresponding with other nations in all the gentle terms
of peace and good-fellowship. May Science, as, in this
instance, always guide BRITANNIA's hand in ruling the
WaWes:
A “PERFECT * JOKE.

“WHAT is the reason of a blow leaving a blue mark after
it?” asked an inquiring young gentleman.
“It’s easily accounted for,” answered a medical student,
who was reading Bell's Life; “for you know that Bloto

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAYNAU’S TASTE OF BARCLAY AND PERKINS’S ENTIRE.
By this time the reader is
aware of the brewing
extraordinary which too
}. the other day at
ARCLAY AND PERKINs's
—the storm brewed at
that establishment by
GENERAL HAYNAU.
HAYNAU, in the public
eye, stands branded with
deeds of the basest atro-
city—themerciless hang-
ing of brave men, and
the dastardly flogging of
noble women. He is a
slandered man, of course.
No demon, even, but the
meanest as well as most
malignant in devildom
would have perpetrated
cruelties so execrable
and infamous. This gal-
lant officer and amiable
gentleman goes about, the object of universal hatred, through (doubtless) a mere deception,
which has been unaccountably practised on the newspapers, ji. by their means.
With his detestable character pinned to his back—albeit bold as brass in conscious innocence
—did BARON HAYNAu, according to the Times and other journals—go on Wednesday last week
to visit Barclay and Peakins's brewery. Armed with the breastplate of an untainted heart,
he wrote his name—little thinking what a name it was—in the visitors' book. The pen might
as well have been a lighted match, and the page a train leading to a powder-barrel. What
was the consequence? “His presence,” says the Times—
“Became known all over the brewery in less than two minutes, and before the general and his companions
had crossed the yard, nearly all the labourers and draymen were out with brooms and dirt, shouting out, “Down with
the Austrian butcher,' and other epithets of rather an alarming nature to the general. He was soon covered with
dirt, and perceiving some of the men about to attack him, ran into the street to Bank-side, followed by a large mob,
i. of the brewer's men, coal-heavers, and others, armed with all sorts of weapons, with which they bela
general.’
The Baron fondly imagined himself a simple lion; and had no idea that he would be received
as a Tiger—the beast with which he is confounded by a yulgar, error. But had he really been
the unmanly miscreant, he was mistaken for, how poetically beautiful would have been the
termination of his adventure —
" He ran in a frantic manner—”
Frantically as a women-whipper might be expected to run:—
“He ran in a frantic manner along Bankside, until he came to the George public-house, when, forcing the doors
open, he rushed in and proceeded upstairs into one of the bed-rooms, to the utter astonishment of Mas. BENFIELD, the
landlady, who soon discovered his name, and the reason of his entering her house. The furious mob rushed in after
him, threatening to do for the “Austrian butcher,' but fortunately for him the house is very old fashioned, and contains
a vast number of doors, which were all forced open, exeept that of the room in which the General was concealed.”
If–only if, mind–BARON HAYNAU were indeed the HAYNAU of the journals—how delicious
to behold the brave General that º the fair sex, taking shelter from chastisement beneath
a woman's petticoat! What a sight for the shade of BATTHYANI to see him lie there, “covered
with dirt,” but more thickly bedaubed with ignominy!
Happily the injured innocent escaped with his life.
and—as above, see the Times:—
“A police galley was at the wharf at the time, into which he was taken and rowed towards. Somerset House,
amidst the shouts and execrations of the mob."
The Morning Post states that
“He was conveyed over the water in a most deplorable state, the clothes having been actually torn off his back,
besides several very severe blows having been inflicted on him.”
The police came timeously to the rescue,
feeling mind must condole with GENERAL HAYNAU on the treatment which he
Every rightl

human nature.
MEssRs. BARCLAY AND PERKINs, it is stated, have been investigating the matter, with a view
to discover the ringleaders in the attack on the gallant Č.". was misunderstood to
have hanged heroes and flogged ladies. Even had there been no misunderstanding in the case,
the conduct of the draymen would certainly have been illegal. Nor would it have been exactly
justifiable morally; for, as we all know, it is, a duty not to let our blood, boil over under any
rovocation, and we ought to #. a philosophical calmness even in the presence of HERod
resh from the slaughter of the Innocents, or of NERo red-handed from his mother's murder.
Here’s to your speedy amendment, BARON HAYNAU! and lest new acquaintance should be
forgot, perhaps you will pledge us in BARCLAY, PERKINS AND Co.'s ENTIRE.
Contracting Bad Habits.
TJNLEss you wish to contract bad habits, we should advise you not to purchase your clothes at
a cheap tailor's, for, as the cloth is invariably bad, and the way of making it up generally too
small, the chances are, that, with every coat, waistcoat, or pair of trousers you purchase, you
will be contracting a deplorable bad habit. The only consolation is, that you will have no diffi-
culty in breaking yourself of the habit, for it is sure to break of its own accord.
HEALTH OF THE HIGH COURT OF
PARLIAMENT.
THERE is not a reproach to the Govern-
ment and the Legislature more scandalous
than their neglect of the medical profession.
Among the officers, whether of the Lords
or the Commons, there is neither physician
nor surgeon; a fact, which shows how little
either of the Houses of Parliament care for
the Constitution. These remarks are sug-
gested by a return lately published of the sit-
tings of the House of Commons during the
last session. The number of days on which
the House sat, was 129 altogether, and in
July amounted to as many as 23; the sit-
tings, on the whole, occupying 1,104 hours
14 minutes; and averaging hours,
minutes, and 35 seconds a day: now, of
course, all this sedentary occupation must be
highly injurious. Of the time thus spent, no
less than 108 hours and a quarter were after
midnight: and the pernicious effect of keeping
such late hours must be obvious. Sedentary
habits, it is well known, are particularly pro-
ductive of liver complaints and indigestion;
and nothing is more likely than that such
votes as the Sabbatarian resolution are come
to under the influence of bile, and that bodil
dyspepsia—which is known to affect the mi
—is the cause of ill-digested measures.
The Commons, at any rate, ought to have
a medical officer to regulate the habits of
the House; to feel its pulse previously to its
entering on exciting questions, and to ex-
amine the tongues of honourable members
before they are allowed to speak. But it is
boured not probable that any such wise appointment
will be made. Even if Parliament were aro
to anxiety about its health, it would never
call in a regular practitioner, but would q
itself with the patent pills, and other poisons
of which it encourages the sale.
FIRST APPEARANCE THIS SEASON
OF THE AMERICAN SERPENT.
THE American Sea Serpent has come up
again. We made sure he would as soon as
Parliament was closed. His season then
begins. He commences his summer circuit.
This year he has been favouring Ireland
with a round of his favourite characters. In
addition to his former representations, he has
been trying a number of feats in the style of
the celebrated American Jumper-with this
difference, that he has been i.p. up to a
certain height, inst of from one. One
correspondent informs us that the Serpent,
when fired at, leapt up in the air 40 fathoms.
This extraordinary feat appears to us so in-
credible, so profoundly mysterious, that with
all our faith, knowing that the statement is
made by an Irish correspondent, we cannot
fathom it. But the Serpent's trip to Ireland
seems curious. We thought that St. PATRIck
drove all the reptiles, and serpents so effec-
tnally from Ireland, that they were never to
return to it. Perhaps the American Serpent
has heard of the Irishman's love of the mar-
yellous, and has paid him a visit purposely,
in order to see how he can enlarge upon his
dimensions. Nothing will be too wonderful
for the American Sea Serpent in the hands
of “our Irish Correspondent,” and we have
no doubt it will last him long enough to
run through the winter till Parliament opens
agaln.

If that train didn't go-'taintino fault o' the stoker!
For I felt myself almost too big for my station,
To think I was stokin' the 'ead of the nation'
Well, at last to the Euston, the QUEEN she comed down,
But bless you, she hadn't no robes, and no crown-
But, º like amylady you’d see in the street,
Wich the PRINCE was the same, and the rest of the sweet;
But Lord, JEM, that MARCHIONEss DQURq's a beuty,
(Wich Princesses and Princes to muss it’s her dooty,)
And sea Ito myself—“Bless your sweet face,” sex I, “ma'am,
If I goes off the line with you, blow me sky high, ma'amº"
So with that, when the young PRINCE or WALEs and his brothers
And sisters was settled long-side of each others, -
Off we goes! QUEEN and PRINCE they bows out of the winders,
And, Lord, didn’t we just astonish the cinders.
Though I say it that should’nt, there ne'er was a hingine
Behaved herself better—the pace it was swingein’;
Soon we sighted the Wolverton Station, and in it
We stopped her, just under the hour, by a minute.
There #. ºd lunch—wich we broke through the Wolverton rule,
And actilly took time for the soup to get cool!
Wich, as all will admit as has stopped there to dine,
Was the loyalest thing could be done on the line.
Well—we started again, and was bilin' a pace,
When, what should I see, just outside of the place
But the boys and the girls out o' Wolverton ool,
Drawed up by the line, JEM, as straight as a rule;
I thought I'd ha’snivelled to see, mongst the rest on 'em,
M. little MARIA as meat as the best on 'em.
I don't think the QUEEN got a werry good sight on 'em,
Nor they one o' her—but still, JEM, it wer right on 'em:
‘Twas the same all along o' the line, dash my buttins!
A top o' the bridges, and over the cuttins,
Each side of embankments, and round about stations,
It was people in heaps—all a’waitin with patience,
And hoorain like mad, as we slapped past in style-
For we did it all through, JEM, a minute a mile,
Wich ain't a bad pace, if you take in the stopping;
Wich so sure as we stopped down them Lord Mares was droppin.
With their maces and swords, and their big corporations,
All a fizzin and blowin off congratylations.
Once, I thought I’d a laffed till I busted my biler—
We’d pulled up permiscus to water and ile i.
When down comes a Mare and a train of them aldermen
(I don’t think I ever see fatter or balder men)
Well, just then I wistled, and turned on the steam—
You ought to a seen 'em, so broad in the beam,
How they scuttled and panted alongside the train,
A tryin to shove their address through the pane.
The short-windeder on 'em, they soon º behind,
But the Mare he kept on till he run isself blind,
His address in the winder a tryin to thrust—
He'll be a long time gettin' over that bust
But Mares and such like ain't no good in our day,
It's Directors that now has it all their own way;
It’s them meets the QUEEN both at startin . stoppin',
With refreshments upon her keeps always a poppin',
Has the honour to hand the young Princesses down,
And the Prince, wich they tell me is hair to the crown—
In short, wenyou cipherit up you’ll agree
That the rail is the one thing HER MAJEsty see.
Qny look at Newcastle, now-vere was the town?
From the High Level Bridge on the Tyne she looked down—
She never saw nothin' of coal-pits and stuff,
But she did see the station—and that was enuff.
As a stoker—you see, JEM-I’m matrally proud,
We ort for to old up our heads in the crowd;
For railways, depend on’t, is wonderful things,
d they don't care a fig if it’s Queens or it’s Kings
That they tosses from England's one end to the other,
In their long iron arms, with a scream and a smother;
And I could’nt but think though I be’s but astoker,
With the QUEEN in the carriage, and meat the poker,
How with royalty goin' at this sort o' pace,
Qld loyalty must, somehow, show a new face;
When HER MAJESTY's carriage, though fit up in style,
Gºes by just the same road as the penny-a-mi
We live in queer times—“go ahead” folks all scream,
And the omething we seems for to vally is steam;
Which is all werry well, if the rails be well laid,
And the stoker and engineman up to their trade;
Butlet a train loose with steam up, you'll agree,
That the faster the it’s the worserfor well
Sometimes, JEM, I think with our stirrin” and strivin'
Wethinks too much of page, and too little of drivin'.
Howsumever, you’ll say that’s no ways here northere,
And no more it ain’t, JEM-I’m quite well aware—
But such was my thoughts, as across the High Level,
"Mid the roar of a fight, and the glee of a revel,
We steamed, and shut off at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
From wich we took on by the North British line,
And reached Edinburgh safe, after no end of speeches,
And was welcomed by folks, some of wich 'ad no breeches—
But no matter: HER MAJESTY's not broke no bones,
Wereby for the same she may thank Yours, BILL Jones.
Rupture between England and France.
WE regret to announce a rupture between England and France,
which occurred last week, by the Submarine Telegraph suddenly break-
ing. All friendly communications between the two countries were
instantly suspended, and though it was evident that there was a “screw
loose” somewhere, it was only after a deal of fishing and sounding,
that it was discovered that the rupture was owing to the softness of one
of the “leaden conductors.” This is not the first time that a “leaden
conductor” has, by his softness, created a distance between the two
countries, and plunged them head over heels in difficulties. The mis-
chief, however, was soon patched up, and communications from Doyer
to Calais have been since ...”by the same line of communication
as before. We only wish that all ruptures between England and France
were as easily mended!

Louis NAPOLEoN has outdone the doings of the renowned BARON
NATHAN. The Baron—it is matter of undying history-dances through
a hornpipe in a circle of eggs, and though blindfolded, never touches
One º them. Louis Napoleon has danced through his progress,
seeing no further before him than the Baron; and though he has
shuffled through at least fifty speeches, he has never touched the word

BARCLAY AND PERKINS’S DRAYMEN.
NEw WERSION.
GENERAL there was on Austria's side,
A Baron who ruth did lack, man, ... ...
He hang'd brave soldiers, and—tan his hide!
He wallopp'd the female back, man.
Whether he ever did much in fight,
Is more than I’m able to say, man; . .
But I know that he nearly got killed outright,
By BARCLAY and PERKINs's Draymen.
Our Baron bold, who whopp'd the fair,
- Of hanging who had the k, man,
- = Came over here to England, where
He could have no ladies to whack, man.
For gibbet and halter in vain he sigh'd,
At hanging unable to play, man, -
So in quest of amusement, a visit he tried
To #º and PERKINs's Draymen.
The British Drayman's blood boils high
On woman a whip if you crack, man;
It makes him mad—the reason why-
A *Tis#:tº: : dastard black, man.
ccor y his tury rose,
When the Baron came in his way, man,
And his eyes flash’d fury and “Butcher, here goes!”
Swore BARCLAY and PERKINs's Draymen.
The Baron was seized with blue despair,
And his teeth like mill did clack, man;
Cries he—“Were shall Iron? ah were !
To esgabe vrom deir addack, man?”
“You blood-stain'd thing! we'll make you feel,"
Though you may be dead to shame, man!”
So, though in lang less genteel
Čried Bangº and Perºns's Draymen.
sº they, “If truly our mind we tells,
our skull we should like to crack, man;
For really your name so nasty smells—”
And so they went at him—smack! man.
You can’t think how my heart it pains
To have such things to say, man;
They pelted the Baron with mud and grains,
#. and PERKINs's Draymen.
The Baron at running tried a match;
They followed him in a pack, man,
Crying, “Down with the Butcher!” and “There goes Old Scratch!
That scratched the lady's back, man!”
They tore his clothes and they punch'd his head,
ntil he look’d not like the same man,
While he, like a hunted hyaena, fled
From BARCLAY and PERKINs's Draymen.
With frantic speed down-street he flew,
With the mob upon his track, m
And a ginshop door he darted tiº,
And hid in a two-pair-back, man.
“This here land,” cries the crowd, “is free,
We'll teach you the ladies to flay, man;”
“And don't show your face here no more among we,”
Says BARCLAY and PERKINs's Draymen.
The New Police came just in time,
('Tis said that they’re sometimes slack, man,)
And rescued him cover'd with bruises and grime,
And carried him off in their smack, man.
*With and fear he did glare and grin,
Says they—“You are well away, man; ”
“And don’t let us catch you here agin,”
Says BARCLAY and PERKINs's Draymen.
British and Foreign Industry.
AMONG the various wonderful things we shall see exhibited next year
at the Great Exhibition, there will of course be included a sufficiency of
specimens of a certain clever continental invention, contrived for the
purpose of promoting that international communication and familiarit
which the Exhibition itself is meant to encourage....Conspicuous .#
the marvels of foreign ingenuity, doubtless—duly illuminated, framed,
and glazed—will be a numerous variety of Passports. John Bull, poor
greature, has nothing of the kind to show—but then, on the otherhand,
he has the submarineflectric Telegraph.
THE ORIGINAL “INEFFABLE FLUNKEY.”
OH, Loyalty, Loyalty, “ou diable was tu te nicher?”
Art thou totally to degenerate into addresses from Mayors and
Corporations, and bowing Directors, and the ineffable flunkeydom of a
Royal Railway Progress? -
We had fancied that Englishmen were the most perfect flunkeys in
the world, when they take to flunkeyism. Is there anything so snobbish
as a vulgar Englishman's worship of a lord? Is there anything so
universal as the spice of this snobbishness that leavens our JoHN
BULLISM P - -
But we have discovered the flunkey—helives at Edinburgh and writes
to The Scotsman. We won't mention his name for fear of ruffling his
modesty, or flattering his vanity, for we are not quite sure what effect
such mentioning might have. *. -
The flunkey has stalked the Royal party! He has been successful in
his waylaying and eavesdropping ! ran in upon them, as they started
for Arthur's Seat!
He reached the top two minutes before them! He saw the Prince
of Wales come up! He actually saw his “kilt, and pouch, and black
velvet jacket!” He beheld him (oh, ecstasy') mount the pinnacle and
seize the flag-staff, and cryout, “I am at the top! I’m up first l’’ and he
had the felicity of calling out, “God save the Prince of Wales!” and
the Prince jää at him / and he looked at him for nearly a minute!
And in another minute he saw the QUEEN come, leaning on her husband's
arm / And she was “none the worse;” and he shouted “God save
the QUEEN' Welcome to ARTHUR's Seat!” And the QUEEN saw
him—the inevitable flunkey at her side—the flunkeydom, that, had
dogged her all the way from Euston Square, was here, embodied and
intensified in this #. snob of snobs, thrusting itself on her
privacy—watching her every movement—drinking in her, every word
with the same intensity of vulgar relish with which it jostled the Nepau-
lese Princes, or crushes to see the Hippopotamus, and with as much of
the fine flame and glow of loyalty for its QUEEN, bless its idiotic im-
pudence, as it feels for the said # potamus.
But he wasn’t satisfied with ‘ º save the QUEEN". He must
again cry out, “God save PRINCE ALBERT!” and his Highness lifted
his hat and bowed politely. Then they walked about and Snob followed
them, and eaves-dropped and reports their little chit-chat... And then
“they enjoyed themselves for a quarter of an hour or so.”—the PRINCE
and the QUEEN, and the PRINCE ALBERT, and the Snob, and by this
time there were assembled about thirty other Snobs, but THE SNOB
still was paramount. There was no Snob_so pushing, as THE SNoB |
He assisted in handing the PRINCE OF WALEs off the grass to the
attendants, and he shook hands with him! and he assisted the other
little Princes, and he shook hands with them And he hopes the worthy
Provost won’t think him intrusive, for “he believes the Royal Party
wouldn't have got up to the top so easy, had he not shown them the
way,” and he is “happy to say, not another visitor intruded on the to
but himself and one eavesdropper—and he (eavesdropper) only remaine
one minute, but he (Snob) remained all the time! and he thinks he did
nothing more than his duty.”
Oh Snob, Snob, triple Snob! Thou hadst some misgivings, but
flunkeyism was too strong for thee, and thou couldst not see that the
QUEEN and the PRINCE are a lady and a gentleman, and that they have
a right to their privacy; and that thou hadst been rightly served had
some one been by to have boxed thy long ears for an intrusive, eaves-
dropping, under-bred flunkey, and Snob-Royal as thou artſ
“All Soldiers are Gentlemen.”
THE Englishman (Indian paper) gives a letter of the Commander-in-
Chief, in which SIR CHARLes NAFTER writing of one SERGEANT Rowe,
lays it down as an unquestionable truth, that “he who wears an
uniform is of higher rank than he who makes it.” The soldier before
the tailor—the eagles of war before the geese of the shop-board.
Further, says SIR CHARLEs, “all soldiers are gentlemen, and tailors are
only tailors.”, Very good. Yet the self-same file of Indian papers
detail a terrible flogging inflicted upon a soldier for charging his
Colonel with cowardice. All soldiers are gentlemen! Wherefore,
then, the triangles P. How, SIR CHARLEs, can a soldier be a gentleman
when made cat's-meat?

“HAVE you heard,” asked Hob, “that the sea-serpent has eared
off the coast of Ireland, and, was moreover, seen to scratch itself
against certain rocks called the Barrels?” “ſhave heard it,” answered
9B. “Have you further heard,” said HoB, “that the sea-serpent
left some of its scales upon the rocks.” “I have,” said Nob; “and I
have discovered why the sea-serpent left those very scales, behind it.”
“Why?” asked Hob; when, quick as the electric wire, the wag Nop
replied, “Seeing its appearance has been doubted, the sea-serpent left
the scales, to weigh the evidence.”

EveR anxious for the public good, we have quadrupled the salary of
one of our contributors, insured his life in every office in London—as
well as in the Railway Loss of Life and Accident Company—for the
benefit of the most inconsolable of widows, and we have purchased for
him a first-class ticket on every line, in order that he may be kept
constantly travelling, with a view to the exposition of Railway
grievances. He has undertaken the task with a thorough appreciation
of what he may have to encounter in the shape of irregular trains

THE SABBATARIANS LAST APPEAL.
LoRD AshLEY and friends are not discomfited. No: they will have
the management of the Englishman's Sunday—they will stop his letters
—they will gag the mouth of the Sabbath post. These over-zealous
dressed to the convictions
divers causes, compulsory
- - of the persecution. An
one of these is the relief of an exceeding large class of persons,
“Consisting unquestionably of hundreds of thousands, who, although not possessed of
firmness enough to refuse to receive or open letters on Sundays, do nevertheless desire, as
their recent petitions have shown, that the cares and business of the week should no
longer beforced upon them.”
Thus, it is commiseration for the weakness of erring flesh, unsuccess-
fully struggling with the temptations of the Sunday post, that incites
RD AshLEY and party to endeavour to put the hands that will break
seals into Sunday º waistcoats: and to make the law a substitute
for wanted firmness. Very amiable this of Lord AshLEY and Co.; but
why—in their active. beneficence—stop at the non-delivery of Sabbath
letters? Wº not, in all social and domestic cases, stand between the
the tempter?
ousands of well-meaning people do not possess sufficient firmness
and the pockets of the pure; summing u
|to prevent them from running in debt—why does not LoRD AshLey
ead a society for the putting down of the tally-man?
. Multitudes of the well-meaning cannot resist the misery and destruc-
tion of intemperance—by all means let Lord AshLEY find means to
stand between the drunkard and the gin-shop.
how many improvident unions are contracted, because the
arties want firmness to await the fitting season? Why should not his
ordship call for an Act prohibiting marriage under certain adverse
conditions? If a substitute for moral firmness is to be supplied by Act
of Parliament, by all means begin with the reckless, the en, and
the improvident. When they are tied over by statute to be thrifty,
temperate, and prudent, then let his Lordship—in the dearth of allother
º up the Sunday post; an achievement, he will again
se when he has put down every other social evil (which a Sunday
letter is not), and not till then. #. his Lordship will never jockey
another ferby : never again will his winning post fe the Sundays.
THE SUB-MARINE TELEGRAPH. PROTECTION FOR THE
ELECTRIC EEL.
“I HAVE, the honour to represent a numerous class in the
domain of º: inclusive of all that portion of the sub-marine
population which is formed by the Torpedos, that important branch of
the great RAY Family. We are distinguished from all other inhab-
itants of these dominions by the striking characteristic of procuring our
subsistence by the exertion of electric power; an endowment which
Nature has implanted in our tails, and of which we have §: the
privilege from time immemorial... I invoke the aid of your forcible pen
in defence of our vested and ancient rights; in behalf of Protection to
Native Electricity. The grasping spirit of Commerce perverting to its
own purposes the might of unfeeling Science, has established a Sub-
marine Electric Telegraph across the Straits of Dover. We cannot but

--
necessarily destroy all the fish in the neighbourhood. When Sub-
marine Electric Telegraphs, become universal—as without legislative
interference it is to be feared they will be-they must and will utterly
annihilate our vocation, with which the well-being of our fellow-subjects
is so inseparably connected. It is ridiculous to suppose that we can
compete with mercantile companies possessing, through dint of capital,
the means of generating electricity to any amount. You, Sir, as a
naturalist, well know that our power of production is limited by the
capabilities of our nervous system; and that after a certain º ture
of electrical energy we become exhausted. I am fully prepared to prove
these assertions by an array of facts and figures, which would, however,
be less suitable perhaps to your pages than to some of your contem-
poraries. BRITANNIA is the Ruler of the Waves. Exhort her, Sir,
with your accustomed eloquence to beware, lest, in withholding Protec-

essentially depends.

SKULLS AT COLOGNE AND WIESBADEN.
ON their way from Frankfort, certain members of the Peace Congress
were caught and welcomed at Cologne; and—doubtless to the embar-
rassment of some of them—were introduced to the skulls of the Three
Kings; of the “wise men,” says, Holy Writ (but the questionable
flattery of tradition has crowned them) whose names were—says the
legend—BALTHASAR, JASPAR, and MELCHIOR. They followed the star
to Jerusalem, and did homage with º of myrrh, gold, and frank;
incense. How they afterwards arrived at Cologne, it might be deemed
ill-manners to inquire too curiously. There they are, however; at least,
to the believing; and their tomb, says an account in the Daily News,
“was opened and lit with gas, and the skulls shown through the golden
works to the greatest possible advantage.” A beneficial result not
always obtained by casting beams of light upon, the rottenness, of
superstition. After all, however, an imaginary dialogue between the
traditional BALTHAsAR and the real ELIHU BURRITT, between the
legen JASPAR and the veritable. Joseph STURGE---would be more
profound, more instructive, abounding with deeper significance, than
the real talk of the skull of Legitimacy at Wiesbaden, with its pro-
fessing believers and worshippers. - - -
Take either of the three; traditional BALTHASAR, if you will; and is
not the skull—in its metallic, golden works—as well fitted, as well
furnished, for all human purposes, as that relic of the past, that Bourbon
skull—with its halo of ST.LOUIs—on the head of the Count CHAMBORD;
that old, old relic of divine right—that .."; charnel thing of old;
world legitimacy? Compared with the Bourbon in his mediaeval
majesty, with the light of 1850 showing it, not like the upon the
three nominal sovereigns, late of Bethlehem now of Cologne, to the
greatest possible advantage—compared with the talking skull, the stern,
grim meaning of the naked bone that was the head of legendary BAL-
THASAR has ponderous eloquence. HENRY CINQ is the shadow-the
ghost—the outline of long defunct legitimacy, gibbering of vanities—
now BALTHASAR is a re º silently discoursing solemn truths—
giving utterance of the tomb and the judgment. '. -
At Wiesbaden, the skull of legitimacy cries to its believers:-
“He whom you regard as your chief, as your king, and who, I may say, is your
dearest friend—he will always set you the example; and should France ever be in
danger, ah! tell all our friends how proud and happy I shall be to fly with you to her
defence?”
IFor all the wants of the day, of even France in her progress, would
not the skull of BALTHASAR serve as well as the head of CHAMBORD,
filled with the reek of St. Louis? For how many generations has a
human blight been permitted to scourge mankind—and its name is
Bourbon ſ If France must have a king, and the nephew of his uncle
should miss the crown, we would rather have JASPAR, BALTHASAR, or
MELCHIOR, in honest brainlessness selected for the royal head of
France, º the head of a Bourbon. The name is a synonym for ||

THE Peace Congress is a capital joke. It’s so obvious a subject for
fun that we haven’t thought it worth while to waste a laugh on it.
All manner of pens have been poking the public in the ribs about it—
aper pellets .#. colours and weights have been slung at it—arrows
rom all quivers have been emptied on its vulnerable sides.
“Preach Peace to the world!”. The poor noodles! ... “Inculcate
the supremacy of right over might!”. Ineffable milk-and-water
spoonies'. “Hold out to nations, brotherhood for warfare, the award
of juice instead of the bayonet!” The white-faced, lily-livered prigs!
‘Why it’s the merest Utopianism,” says the Economist.
“It’s neither more nor less than Christianity,” sneers the Statist.
sº Tºde is the true peace-maker,” says the Doctor of the Manchester
001.
“Diplomacy keeps the world quiet,” oracularly declares the Red-
tapist.
: Peace indeed, the designing democrat" growls the Absolutist.
“Peace, with a bloated aristocracy still rampant!” snarls the Red
Republican. And they all drown in a chorus of contemptuous laughter
gº ºins voices of the poor Peace Congressists in the Church of
. Iſaul.
But there are some, voices which refuse to join in this chorus,
some thoughtful faces that look on with interest and sympathy at this
strange º in the mineteenth century against, the appeal to, brute
force, which is the only way of settling its quarrels that the world has
tried for eighteen centuries since Peace was preached on Earth, and
good will to men!
... And there are some, too, of the wise and the great, who can discern
in this gathering of friends of peace, this little Babel of various
tongues, this tiny Congress of many races, a thing in no way to be
ridiculed, any more than the acorn is to be ridiculed, when science de-
clares that its heart contains the oak.
ALEXANDER Von HUMBOLDT is, of all persons now living in Europe,
the most experienced in men and Courts; the most deeply learned; the
most comprehensively and thoroughly informed. He has traversed the
domain of knowledge as widely as he has travelled, the countries of the
globe. ALEXANDER von HUMBOLDT does not laugh at this Peace
Congress. There is no sneer in well-weighed words like these:–
“The general peace which our continent has now so long enjoyed, and the praise-
worthy efforts of many Governments to avert the oft-threatening dangers of a general
European war, prove that the ideas which so *"...". occupy your minds are in
accordance with the sentiments called forth and diffused by the increased culture of
humanity. It is a useful enterprise to inspire such sentiments in the commonwealth
by public conferences, and at the same time to point out the way through which wise
and sincere Governments may, by fostering the progressive and legitimate develop-
ment and perfectibility of free institutions, weaken the long accumulated elements of
animosity.”
Perhaps the grey-haired philosopher is laughing in his sleeve," or
drivelling, when he tells the #. ongress that, -
“The whole history of the past shows that, under the protection of a superior power
a long-nourished yearning after a noble aim in the life of nations, will at length fin
its consummation.”
Poor HUMBOLDT' Visionary Enthusiast! At his time of life, too;
and a man who knows courts and countries, and science, and so on!
It’s amazing.—perfectly amazing!
But then he's a German,—and these Germans are such dreamers!

THE LION HUNTRESS OF BELGRAVIA.
Being LADY NIMRoD's Journal of the past Season.
Among the mºst considerablelions who have figured in my menagerie,
I may mention, BoBBAchy. BAHAwper, the Prince of Delhi, who came
over on a confidential mission, from His Imperial Majesty the EMPEROR
AURUNgzEBE, their august º and master. No soirée was for
some time complete without the Bobbachy. Of all the Orientals who
have visited our shores, it was agreed that he was the most witty,
interesting, and accomplished; he travelled with a small suite of
Hookabadars, Kitmeltgars, and Lascars; and the sensation was pro-
digious which was occasioned by the intelligence, that the distinguished
Envoy had it in command from his imperial master, to choose out from
among the beauties of Britain a young lady who would not object to
become EMPREss of DELHI, in place of the late lamented wife of the
sovereign, for whose loss His Majesty was inconsolable. It was only
after he had been for some time in the country that this the real object
of his mission transpired: for, for some time, the Bobbachy lived in the
most private manner, and he was not even presented at Court, nor
asked to a turtle dinner by the East India Company. In fact, some of
the authorities of Leadenhall Street said that the Bobbachy was no
more an Ambassador than you or I, and hinted he was an impostor; but
his Excellency's friends knew better, and that there are differences
of such a serious nature between the East India Company and the
Delhi Emperor, that it was to the interest of the Leadenhall Street
potentates to ignore the Bobbachy, and throw all the discredit
which they could upon the Envoy of the great, widowed, and injured
sovereign.
LADY LYNX took this line, and would not receive him; but the
manner in which her ladyship is liée with some of those odious
Directors, and the way in which she begs, borrows, and as I believe,
sells the cadetships and writerships which she gets from them, is very
well known. . She did everything malice and envy could suggest, to
bring this eminent Asiatic into disrepute; she said he was not a Prince,
or an Envoy at all, or anything but a merchant in his own country:
but as she º tries to sneer at my lions, and to pooh-pooh my
#. and as I was one of the first to welcome the distinguished
obbachy to this country, the very ill-will and envy of LADY Lynx
only made me the more confident of the quality of this remarkable
rson, and I do not blush to own that I was among the first to welcome
him to our shores. I asked people to meet the Ambassador of the
EMPEROR of DELHI. That I own, and that he denied altogether that
he was here in any such capacity; but if reasons of state prevented
him from acknowledging his rank, that was no reason why we should
not award it to him; and I was proud to have the chance of presenting
his Excellency to society, in opposition to that stupid, uninteresting
Hungarian General whom LADY LYNX brought out at the same time,
for he spoke English with a decided Connemarabrogue.
lodgings in Jermyn Street, and lived at no expense, but happening to be
staying at the Star and Garter at Richmond, where he one day came to
dinner, I introduced myself to him in the hotel gardens; said I was
the LADY NIMRod, one of the chiefs of English society, of whom
perhaps he had heard, and that I should be glad to do anything in my
power to make the metropolis welcome for him, and introduce him into
the best company. He put both his hands before him on his breast, as
if he was going to swim at me, MR. GRIMstone said, and made me a
most elegant bow: answering in very good English that my humble
name and the º of my parties . often formed the subject of
conversation at the Court of Delhi and throughout the East, and that it
was a white day in his life in which he had the delight to see the
countenance of one who was so illustrious for beauty, as ń. was pleased
to say I was “Ah!” he often said afterwards, “why has, Fate dis-
º: so early of such a lovely creature? What a lucky individual is
he (meaning NIMRoD) who possesses such a pearl! It is fit to be worn
in an Emperor's turban, and I must not speak about you to my master
or show your portrait to him unless I can take you to him; for he will
certainly, when I get back to Delhi, chop, my head off from rage and
disappointment at my returning home without you?
This speech, though Oriental, at least shows he was well-bred. As
for my marrying the Emperor, that is out of the question, for NIMRon
is alive in the country, and we have no means of pursuing your Oriental
}. of bow-stringing here. I told the º at once that the
mperor must never think of me, must never be spoken to about me,
and that I must live and die an English, not an Indian lady. But this
was in aftertimes, and when we grew more intimate together. Mean-
while it gave me great pleasure in introducing into the world this
amiable and polite exotic.
. At first, as I have said, he lived in a very humble and retired manner
in Jermyn Street, when I called upon him in my carriage with my
footmen. The door was opened by a maid of all-work: who told us
with wonder that “the Injan gent,” as she called him, lived on the
second floor. Itoiled up to his apartment (how different to the splendid
halls and alabaster pillars and sparkling fountains of the palaces of his
native East!), and there found His Excellency on a horse-hair sofa,
smoking his hookah. I insisted |. taking him a drive into the park.
It happened to be a fine day, and there was a throng of carriages, and
most eyes were directed towards the noble stranger as he sate by my
side in the carriage in a simple Oriental costume with a turban of red
and gold. I would have taken the back seat, and have let him sit
cross-legged, but I had Miss Higgs, my companion, and FIDo on the
back seat. I mentioned everywhere who he was, took him to the opera
º and had him at my Wednesday, with a petit diner choisi to
meet him.
He had not been at Court as yet, nor with the East India Company,
for the reasons I have stated; until the presents for HER MAJESTY
with which the Burrumpooter East indiaman was oaded, had reached
London—presents consisting of the most valuable diamonds, shawls
elephants, and, other, choice, specimens of Oriental s lendour—had
arrived in the East India Docks, it was not etiquette for him to present
himself before the sovereign of this country. Hence his quiet retreat
in his Jermyn Street lodgings; and he º at the audacity of the
landlord of the odious house. “Landlord,” he said, “he think me
rogue. Landlord he send me, biſi Landlord he think Boºchy
BAHAwper not pay. Stop till Burrumpoofer come, then see whether
landlord not go down on his knee before the Emperor's Ambassador.”
Indeed His Excellency had arrived with only two attendants, by the
steamer and the overland route, leaving the bulk of his suite and the
invaluable baggage to follow in the Burrumpooter.
He was a fine judge of diamonds and shawls, of course, and very
curious about the jewellers and shawl merchants of London. Itook him
in my carriage to one or two of our principal tradesmen; but there was
very little which he admired, having seen much finer brilliants and
shawls in his own romantic land.
When he saw my house he was delighted and surprised. He said he
thought all houses in London like that lodging in Jermyn Street-all
sofas black, all sky black; why his dam secretary take him to that black
hole? Landlord-dam secretary’s uncle-charge him hundred pound
month for that lodging. I ſº how atrociously His Excellency
had been imposed upon, and that if he intended to receive company, he
should certainly transport himself to better apartments. It is wonder-
ful how these simple foreigners are imposed upon by our grasping
countrymen! -
The Bobbachy took my advice, and removed to handsome rooms at
Green's Hotel, where he engaged a larger suite, and began to give
entertainments more befitting his rank. He brought a native cook,
who prepared the most delicious curries, º and Indian dishes,
which really made one cry—they were so hot with pepper. He gra-
dually got about him a number ºf the most distinguished people, and,
thanks to my introduction and his own elegant and captivating manners
was received at many of our best houses; and when the . object of
his mission came out (which he revealed tomein confidence), that he was
anxious to select a lady for the vacant throne of Delhi, it was wonderful
When the Bobbachy first came to this country, he occupied humble
how popular he became, and how anxious people were about him. - The

was hung up in his princi ing-room; and though a vile daub, as
most people said, especially that envious GRIMSTONE, who said he must

expect from an Indian artist? and the picture represented a handsome
young man, with a sweet black...beard, a thin waist, and a necklace of
diamonds worth millions and billions of rupees. -

were to show their own beauties! Everybody read up about Delhi,
and was so anxious to know about it from His Excellency! MRs.

was nearly torn to pieces. It was “BoBBACHY BAHAwDER and suite,”
| “HIs ExcellENCY BoBBAchy. BAHAwDER,” “His ExcellENCY
PRINCE BOBBACHY BAHAwper,” everywhere now, his name in all the
newspapers, and who should be most eager to receive him. -
The number of pictures of young ladies of rank which my friend
received from all parts of the country, would have formed a series of
books of beauty. There came portraits from Belgravia—portraits from
Tyburnia—portraits from the country; portraits even from Blooms-
bury and the city, when the news was public of the nature of His
Excellency's mission. Such wicked deceptive portraits º sent up too!
Qld Miss CRUICKSHANKs had herself painted like a sylph or an opera
dancer; MRs. BIBB, who is five-and-forty if she's a day old, went to a
great expense, and had a fashionable painter to draw her in a crop and
a pinafore, like a school-girl. Fathers brought their children to walk
up and down before His Excellency's hotel, and some bribed His Ex-
cellency's secretary to be allowed to wait in the ante-room until he
should pass out from breakfast. That LADY LYNX said that the only
ady money which the mission got was from these bribes, and the
}. I must confess, were sold upon the Minister's withdrawal
rom this coun
try.
A sudden revolution at the Court of Delhi occurred, as is very well i,
known, in May last, and the news of his recall was brought to my
excellent #. The demand for his return was so peremptory, that he
was obliged to quit England at a moment's notice, and, departed with
is secretary only, and before he had even had time to take leave of me,
his most attached friend. -
A lamentable accident must have happened to the Burrumpoofer India-
man, with the diamonds and elephants on board, for the unfortunate
ship has never reached England, and I daresay has sunk with all on
arol.
But that is no reason for the slander of ill-natured people, who want
to make the world believe that there never was such a ship as the
Burrumpooter at all; and that the Bobbachy and his secretary were a
couple of rogues in league together, who never had a penny, and never
would have made their way in society but for my introduction. How
am I to know the pedigrees of Indian Princes, and the manners of one
blackamoor from another? If I introduced the Bobbachy, I’m sure
other people have introduced other dark-complexioned people; and, as
for the impudence of those tradesmen who want me to pay his bills, and
of MR. GREEN, of the hotel, who says he never a shilling of His
Excellency’s money, I’ve no words to speak of it.
..Besides, I don't believe he has defrauded anybody: and when the
differences at the Court of Delhi are adjusted, I’ve little doubt, but that
he will send the paltry few thousand pounds he owes here, and perhaps
º back to renew the negotiations for the marriage of his imperial
master.
An Expensive Game of Marbles.
Joh N, BULL is again engaged in a ruinous game of marbles with the
Great Marble Arch, by which he has already lost so much, in front of
Buckingham Palace. Poor John is called upon once more to “knuckle
down” to a very extravagant tune, for the removal of the Arch, and,
even then, the material difficulty is to know what to do with the material.
The reconstruction of the Arch will cost more than it is worth, and it
has been suggested by an indignant economist, that it would be better
to hand over the whole concern to the Arch-fiend, as the natural patron
of an arch that has been productive of so much wasteful expenditure.

PUNCH'S NOTES AND QUERIES.
As Michaelmas Day is at hand, perhaps some of our readers will let
us know whether the “goose look” mentioned in SHAKSPEARE was
in the eye, or the nose, or whether it was a peculiar feature of
the times. Sympathetic cures used to be much in vogue, but we
cannot undertake to answer the query-though accompanied by a £10
note—of the individual who wishes to know whether he can cure a pain
in his side by curing a side of bacon.
We have heard that eating snakes was formerly reputed a good
method of growing young. We can recommend something that would be
perhaps quite as efficacious, and a little less nauseous possibly, than
eating a snake, namely, to swallow some of the Serpent-ine.
The practice of using manuscripts and unsaleable printed works for
the lining of trunks doubtless had its origin in the superstition, that
the excessive dryness of the matter would keep the water out. ere
may be something in this idea, for the substances in question are quite
incapable of absorbing anybody or anything.
The Irish-American Sea Serpent.
THE Irish seem to be *ś American Sea Serpent “quite intirely”
out of the hands of the Yankees. It is a difficult labour to imagine an
Irish-American Sea Serpent. The only picture we can draw of him is
with a short pipe in his mouth, brandishing a shillelagh with one of his
fins, shouting out, “Will any jintleman just tread upon my tail?”
ENGLISH LOCUST.S.
In the East they have armies of locusts that quite darken the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE'S ANNUITY.
THE Times calls attention to the fact—the melancholy fact to long-
suffering Englishmen, with the prospect of a renewed income-tax—that
“ the first quarter's payment of the DUKE or CAMBRIDGE's annuity of
£12,000 § become payable on the 10th of next month.” His Royal
Highness will then touch £3000! ...There is, however, a glimmer of hope
among the gold coin—it is this: “the annuity is to cease should the
Duke become the sovereign of any foreign, state.” On these terms,
should Hanover, or any newly-created kingdom, want a sovereign, we
are prepared, at a minute's notice, to supply a potentate for nothing.
This first quarter's payment of £3000 should, however, be comme-
morated in some way. Will not the Duke's tradesmen dine together
in honour of the event? They might, moreover, enlarge the mahogany
on the occasion, for the accommodation of those disinterested chairmen
and secretaries of the Good Cambridge Testimonial, whose charity is
whetted by ambition, and whose names are to be engraved upon the
monumental pillar—a Pillar of Real Smoke, we take it—-erected to the
memory of the late good-natured chairman and amiable diner-out.
Any way, the tradesmen must illuminate. And what fitter, what more
significant blaze than the numerals in coloured lamps? As thus:-
G. º ºt.
4:12,OOO!
The notion suggests a pleasant mode of divination, by which—if we
may imagine a sympathy of whale oil with ducal worth—we might
arrive at the real yearly value of his Royal Highness. As thus: if every
lamp burnt steadily—the whole
£12,000
going out together—we might accept the consentaneous extinction as
illustrative of the fact that the Duke was worth the £12,000, to end
only with his life, and not a figure less. But supposing that the £12,000
burnt as thus:
£ 2,OOO
Or thus— &12,OO
Or thus— 321 OO
Or even, yes, even thus— £ O
The gradual subtraction of sum by the extinction of figure or cypher
might, in the bosoms of the superstitious, patriotically tender towards
our monetary institutions, indicate a probable deduction as the years of
His Royal Highness waned, ſlickered, and went out in smoke. Be this
as it may, let us by all means have the
£12,000
—exchequer cherubim in burning, row, testifying to Englishmen the
cost of royal cousins and the pliancy of Whigs. And, whereas, in
England the human animal is only made by money, so let an appro-
riate motto set forth the characteristic creation of His Royal Highness.

F. M. THE DUKE of WELLINGTON has accepted the office of Ranger
of the Parks—a post which, to our ears, smacks e ingly of beadle-
dom. We know that the abilities of His Grace have comprehended a
very wide range, but the part of Ranger is, at his time of life, rather
onerous, for if its duties are performed in person, we shall be occasionally
startled by a situation something like that of the disguised Beefeater in
SHERIDAN's Critic, for when we are taking a quiet stroll by the
Serpentine, we shall perhaps have one of the park-keepers throwing
back his gold-laced collar, and standing revealed before us as the hero
of Waterloo.
- We should have thought that the hand so long familiar with the Field
Marshal's bâton would have found it rather infra dig. to begin grasping
the beadle's staff, and the voice once accustomed to command in the
field, to persuade in the Senate, and advise in the Council, must be
rather ingloriously occupied in exclaiming, “Hallo! come off the grass,”
or in murmuring, “Come, come, this, is not allowed,” to some idle
infant, ºº, pebbles into the Serpentine. There seems to
us something like bathos in the “hero of a hundred fights” coming
down to be the Ranger of half a hundred gravel walks, and Inspector-
General of park-palings.
Fortunately, the British “Boy” is an animal that is easily alarmed at
the very appearance of a park-keeper, who has only to shake his staff
to create a º: panic in the juvenile breast; and, therefore, it
is not probable that any park-keeper will find himself compelled to
give chase to a turbulent urchin who will cut his name upon a tree
or indulge in any other freak that it is the office of a Ranger to guard
against.
The Duke, in addition to his other duties, will, of course, have to
regulate the cake and apple-stalls in the various parks, and control the
curds-and-whey tariff, for His Grace has the reputation of attending to
small things as well as great, when it is his duty so to do, and the
public may, therefore, eat its ha'p'orth of gingerbread, quaff its milky
coagulated matter, and discuss its spice nut with the fullest confidence
in such illustrious Rangership.

BARCLAY AND PERKINS’S DRAYMEN TO
PUNCH.

that our Firm is
this, and a pot to
come in, in the Con-
stitution of England
—for who knows how
much of the sinews
of the country is got out of pewter, and how much of its sense from the
Head atop of it—I say, #. all this, and moreover feeling that the
Eyes of the World, like so many burning-glasses, is upon us--I 11
my Pen to write you our sentiments, as men, as Englishmen, an
as BARcLAY AND PERKINs's Draymen, about this little brush with the
Friend of BARON Rothschi.I.D., M.P., with nothing as yet to sit down
. and after what has º: if he goes to the Poll again, I
should say, with certainly not a leg to stand upon.
And First to Begin with. ...We—BARCLAY AND PERKINs's Draymen
—won't hear of what is called a Testimonial. What we’ve done, we
could no more help doing than if a steam-engine of 1000 Horse-guard
power had druv us to, and we won’t be silvered or gilt a bit for it. . I
am emboldened to say this at once, because we’ve heard that, we’re
all to have a silver tº: a-piece made in the shape of a wild beast
—a HYENAU on his hind legs, with precious blood-coloured stones for
eyes—which we at once deny, and refuse, being content with a reward-
ing conscience and humble pewter.
, Sir, I am chose as a humble, 'dividual. (you will with your 'customed
liberality excuse and touch up bad spelling), to set our case before the
world. Sir, we’ve been blamed for pelting a Gen'ral Butcher with
grains. Permit me to ask, if there isn't worse pelting than what comes
out of a brewery? What’s grains to ink? d, Sir, there’s been so
much of it flung at us, that if it could only have stuck, our wives and
families wouldn’t have knowd us.
First, we, BARCLAY AND PERKINs's Draymen, are rebels and damy-
crats., Sir, do you remember a certain 10th of April, when BARCLAY
AND PERKINs's Draymen all went and turned themselves into specials,
and had the thanks of the Government, with LORD JoHN RUSSELL
ready—(only we wouldn’t trouble him)—to come down on the 11th, to
the Brewery, and shake hands with every one of us? We wasn’t
rebels then—but reg’lar bricks!
Second.--It was a plan brewed, and bottled to attack the red-coat
butcher... I repeat, what we did, we couldn't help doing. Afore we
knowd that HAYNAU was in the Brewery, we knowd that something was
wrong. Mr. Punch, we felt it about us, just as you feel, there’s
thunder and lightning at hand—we felt, just as my poor old grand-
mother couldn't abide a cat, and was all in a fume and a fidget, with
her blood simmering, if even so much as a blind kitten was shut up in
a cupboard, though she didn't see it. I can’t account for it, no more
than I can, tell why the lectric fluid carries a message through the
bottom of the sea, without being put out. All I knowed, is, there was
a kind of lectric fluid went through every drayman's heart-(and he
ought to be ashamed to look a honest horse in the face again, if it
j. been so)—and what we did, we couldn't º
Mind you, if it was to be put to us in cold blood to plan a licking of
the sort, we wouldn’t do it. No; we should have time to think of the
matter-time to get up contempt—but contempt, Sir, though I’m
no scholar, as you see, is a thing not at hand on a sudden notice. No,
Sir, contempt, I take it, is red-hot passion grown cold. Bless your
heart! Mr. Punch, if HAYNAU could only come * us Once more,
he’d find we’d now contempt as cold—yes, cold as the corpses made
by his own bullets.
And then, as for trying to kill the Man-Cat that clawed poor naked
Women, we never, dreamed of it. All we wanted was, to disgrace him. has al
There he was in the eyes of all of us one bit of muddy blood—and we
flung dirt at him. He had burnt houses by hundreds, with the poor
souls in 'em,-and what did we do? Why, we just give him a taste of
the cinder-bin. But, then, HAYNAU was such an old man! When he
golden ball—(all of
flogged the poor lady, whose husband shot himself, I do persume he
was no chicken. . An old man! Well, if you want to make the Devil
*...* he is, clap a wig of white hairs upon him, that’s my
thought!
And then as for cutting of the Tyger's beard, why, Mr. Punch, do
you know what it was tried for P Just to sell locks of it to those very
fine folks who’d like to carry a remembrance of “the brave old man,”
—as I’ve seen the monster writ down, all of 'em, I’m bound, willing
to pay a handsome price for the relict. For my part, I’m sorry we
missed the beard. At only twenty shillings a hair, it would have made
a tol'rable sum for the English # —that is, if they’d have
pison'd their hands with a farthing of it.
I’m sorry, too, we throw'd the jº. his hat—sorry that he got off
with his rags of clothes. They’d have been worth any money to
MADAME Tussaud, to stand aside Rush in the Chamber of Horrors.
Howsomever, I understand the whole thing’s to be done in a painted
|Panoramy; beginning with the Dropping of the Truss of Straw—the
Hustling—the Flight along Bankside—the Hiding in the George Public-
house with the Retreat to the iustibin-the Police Delivery—the
Taking Water at the Bankside—and View of Bedroom at Morley's
Hotel, with HAYNAU a Drinking Hot Brandy-and-Water between the
Blankets. The whole to conclude with the Departure of the Tyger
from England in a suit of clothes handsomely sent to Him by BARON
Rothschild, with affectionate Wishes for the Journey. All BARCLAY
AND PERKINs's Draymen have º: to sit for their Picturs bigger
than life. Wouldn't it make a lovely show, framed and glazed for 1851?
As for the Visitors' Book, where HAYNAU’s name was writ, there's
a great fear it’s quite spiled. They tried to scratch HAYNAU-(which,
though writ with black ink, turned as red as blood)-out of the page;
but it sunk through and through, as if the letters had been changed into
red-hot iron; and though I don’t know how many leaves have been
torn away, and how many quarts of vinegar have been laid out, -the
whole book smells, as one of our old porters says who was at Waterloo,
like a bit of carnage three days arterwards.
And now, Mr. Punch, I shall º down my bit of iron. I only wish
to repeat that we want no reward for what we’ve done—no HYENAU
mug—no silver warming-pan for our wives—no corals and bells for our
babbies. What we did, we couldn’t help doing—it was a bit of whole-
some indignation that’s done us good; and so, Mr. Punch, feeling that
virtue is its own reward, whether in silver or in ha'pence,
I remain your Comstant Reader and (for the body of us)
BARCLAY AND PERKINs's DRAYMAN.
P.S. Some of the gents of the Press call for the treadmill for the
ruffians (meaning us) that thrashed the Tyger-Cat. Very well. Praps,
Mr. Punch, GENERAL, HYENA HAYNAU would like to come to the
Brewery again just to 'dentify us?
FEATHERED CHORISTERS FOR CANTERBURY.
THE natural historian will learn with interest that an extraordinary
migration of the feathered race will take place this year. Besides the
nightingales, swallows, cuckoos, and all the other regular birds of
passage, alarge flight of goldfinches, chaffinches, greenfinches, bullfinches,
yellow-hammers,
- - ets, robin redbreasts, wrens, larks, thrushes, black-
birds, tom-tits, water-wagtails, and hedge-sparrows, will take their
departure from these shores. is pretty warbling quire will join the
Canterbury pilgrimage, in addition, we presume, to the surpliced
choristers who will be necessary to complete the character of that
shovel-hat exodus. Our Eraminer says, that
“The emigrant vessels for Canterbury, in New Zealand, not only carry out houses,
and every necessary for domestic comfort on landing, but every variety of English
singing-bird, which, on landing, the colonists will release, in order that they may
propagate.”
Together with their singing-birds, the Canterbury emigrants should
not forget to carry out a sufficient number of those truly ecclesiastical
birds, jackdaws and owls. Their ornithological exports will include a
great many geese, of course; for such must be the case with people who
are going to pay three pounds an acre for land when they might get it
for one, all because they will be tied to a Bishop's apron-string.
Alarming Prodigy.
THE Scotsman relates that one of the lionesses in Wombwell’s Royal
Menagerie has given birth to two fine cubs, “and, strange to say,”
adds our Caledonian contemporary, “they are pure white.” We are
not superstitious, but we cannot help regarding this circumstance as
very portentous. Wherever a White Lion has appeared hitherto, it
ways been a sign to the Public (house).

COST OF OUR CONSULAR
ESTABLISHMENTS.
WE are told by LoRD PALMERston
that we ought to pay Ambassadors ten
thousand a year, that they may be en-
abled to invite a few tip-top travellers
to dinner now and then, though we con-
fess that, as ordinary voyagers, we do
not very . appreciate this sort of
Barmecidal hospitality. When we pay
five francs for a passport fee, or contri-
bute our share to the estimates required
for diplomatic purposes, we feel no sa-
tisfaction in knowing that Lord Tom
NoDDY may have dined at the Ambas-
sador's table once in his life, though
we have got nothing for our money.
The sort of consulship we really de-
rive benefit from is that at Folkstone,
where His Excellency MR. CoNsul
FALKNER, if he does not ask us to dine,
will enable us to get our dinner at an
hotel, while he courteously and econo-
mically gets our luggage through the
Custom-house. We should not object
so much to the salaries of our Ambas-
sadors and Consuls if they would really
perform some kind of service for us,
and were not above meeting us, either
in person or by deputy, at the different
douanes to assist us in passing our
luggage.

be worth while to ascertain whether the

THE COURT THAT IS ALWAYS ADJOURNING.
THE Commissioners of Sewers are always adjourning. The only
object of their meeting seems to be instantly to adjourn. . - - -
e have known them to adjourn four times at one meeting, and it is
considered a very fair day's business if the Court only adjourns twice.
On the occasion when we had business—a little business which
involved the draining of a very unhealthy district of a crowded popula:
tion of 6000 poor people, amongst whom fever was then raging, and
which business had already been adjourned from two previous meetings
—there were only three Commissioners present.
It seems that six Commissioners must be in the room to “make a
Court,” and as there are rarely more than four or five who attend, the
Court is always adjourning. - - -
The CHAIRMAN began the proceedings as usual, by adjourning the
meeting for half an hour. - -
During that half an hour a messenger was sent off to a Commissioner
who lived in Russell's uare, begging his immediate attendance.
wº answer brought back was that the Commissioner “had gone to
Margate.”
#. CHAIRMAN “regretted the delay exceedingly, but, under the
circumstances, he had no other remedy than to adjourn the Court for

A BALD-HEADED CoMMIssionER remarked, that perhaps it would be

The CHAIRMAN thanked the Hon. Captain for his admirable sugges-
tion, which, he fully agreed with him, would save time; and instructions
were given accordingly. - - - - - -
The CLERK observed, that it would be impossible to do it in so short
a space of time, as one of the Commissioners lived in the Minories.

he CHAIRMAN said he had but one duty to perform, and that would
Phalf an hour.
At the expiration of the hour, it was discovered that two Com-
. answered to the invitation. This occasioned an unusual
stir in the Court, and the Chairman was about to proceed to business,
when a voice exclaimed, “We are only five!”. -
“It’s perfectly true—I’m very much obliged to you,”, said the
gentle y CHAIRMAN, bowing—“I’m very sorry, but, at this period
of the year, it is very difficult to get gentlemen to attend. However, we
will try once more. We will adjourn the Court for another half an
hour, and that will give us plenty of time to send to two more Com-
missioners, one of whom I know is in town.”
The Court was once more adjourned, and two messengers were once
more despatched in two cabs. By-the-bye, the running account for
cabs must, at the end of the year, form no inconsiderable item in the
general expenses of the Court of Sewers, for the only public business
transacted seems to be in rushing, about, in cabs. The Metropolitan
cabmen must feel especially thankful to a Court that patronises them so
largely.
ºbountiful supply of newspapers helped to wile away the tedious
hour. Those Commissioners, who did not read, wrote notes, and, from
the quantity of letters which during the many pauses we saw written,
we are inclined to believe that every Commissioner must reserve his
correspondence “for a sewer day,” so that he may have something to
occupy himself with whilst the Court is doing nothing.
At last the two messengers arrived, but no Commissioner! One
was at Baden-Baden, and the other had taken his family to Cremorne,
to see a balloon ascent.
It was now half-past two o'clock. Gentlemen began to look at their
watches. The Chairman looked care-worm. . The Clerk forgot him-
self so far as to yawn. The newspapers were lying on the floor, having
been evidently read through and through, Supp and all. The note
º: was no longer touched. The Commissioners had left their seats,
and were looking out of the window. The children, playing in Soho
Square seemed painfully to interest them, and from their long anxious
faces, you, woul º were so many unhappy culprits looking
through, their prison bars. The number of Commissioners never rose
higher than five ; at a quarter past three it had sunk to two, and the
Chairman seeing, that if he remained much longer, he would probably be
left alone with the Clerk, very wisely adjourned the Qourt. K. a vote
of thanks had been proposed to the Chairman “for his impartial conduct
in the Chair,” and unanimously carried, the meeting was adjourned to
that day three months, when the Chairman “hoped six Commissioners at
least would be present, and so prevent the necessity of any more adjourn-
ments, which really had been going on now infinitely too long.”
To secure this desirable state of things, might we be allowed to
suggest that perhaps it would be better to have Paid Commissioners,
who would make it their duty to attend, instead of a Board of Gentle:
men Commissioners, who, being Unpaid, make a favour of attending !
The change, we are vain enough to believe, might be the cause of a
little work being done, for we cannot help thinking that the present
Gentlemen (if you can call Gentlemen present who never are so),
are not working, but only playing at Sewers /

ful acting of MR.

that he dedicates to
the artist “a cauli-

O all.
We advise MR. Bishop to carry the matter into a higher court. Bouquets much
!. and far less useful, than a cauliflower of some magnitude, are received in
to
ens of honour and distinction flung at tender warblers and fragile fays—yet
HIGGIE rejects a cauliflower! -
Had the cauliflower been thankfully received, on some future might an acknow;
ledged heroine of domestic drama, betrayed and deserted, might have received
the homage of a bunch of turnips; and the turnips received as every well-meant
offering ought to be, patronage tangible and increasing might have succeeded. The
}.ºn in º: is it too much to believe that legs of mutton would have
ollowed :
MR, Bishop had, but disdained to make use of it, an excellent defence. The Mouse,
it appears, is taken from the French; and MR. Bishop thought a cauliflower ought
to go with the cabbage.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BARRICADES.
THE French make their barricades of stones, and everything they can get hold of.
If there is an omnibus or two on the top, so much the better; but their barricades
º last more than two or three days.
e English make our barricades in a much more lasting manner. When we
erect a barricade, it is a good one, and lasts sometimes for a month. It is much
more dangerous, too, we think, than its Parisian brother. If you attempt to walk
over it, the chances are that you will be precipitated down a yawning abyss some
20 feet underneath you, and, when you recover, that you may find yourself floating
down the Thames. The paviours, and rival gas-men, take good care to make it as
formidable as possible, so that all thoroughfare through the street shall be completely
blocked up for weeks together. Communication between the opposite sides of the
street is even cut off, and if two shop-keepers, who face each other, wish to exchange
a word of compliment on business, they must do so through their second-floor
windows, and make known their wants through the º medium of speaki
trumpets. It is true that a middle path is always open to them across the road,
and rather too open, for if they attempt to cross it, and meet half-way, they run
the risk of topping over the narrow plank, and finishing their discussion at the
bottom of the sewer, or else clinging on to a projecting gas-pipe, with their legs
dancing midway in the black atmosphere, and pick-axes flying in, all directions
about their ears. This is a superior kind of barricade to the French species, and
we are indebted to our gas º: companies, and our Commissioners of Sewers,
for the vast improvement.
Another kind of barricade is not unfrequently |. by stones, and bricks and
mortar. This is not attended with the same danger as the barricade that takes
place right in the middle of the street, but still it is a t nuisance, and stops up
the thoroughfare frequently for months. This sort of barricade is caused by building
a new house, the olding of which runs over the entire pavement, and overflows
one half of the road. This nuisance is more applicable to public buildings, which
are not renowned for the same rapid mushroom growth as private dwellings, but take
their time about it. The National Gallery, the Nelson Column, and the whole
of Trafalgar Square, was a standing proof of this for years; though if we were in
want of a great illustration, we need not run through the scaffolding-poles of the
past, when we have so prominently in view the ladders and wheelbarrows of
the present. Look, at the New Houses of Parliament, with what a sluggard’s
slowness they have been rising out of the bed of the river! In fact, they are not
“up” yet, and will not be properly dressed and finished, we will make any wager,
for several years to come. They do not impede the public highway much, it is
true, but still they stop the way of public business; for no wonder that ministers
have sometimes such a difficulty in “making a House,” when the architect will
not make one for them. Taking the slowness of the building into consideration, and
the delays and impediments of which it has been the prolific
cause, we think we may safely point to the New Houses of
Parliament as the fuel BARRY-CADE that has ever been
erected in England.

ALARMING RAWAGES OF MICE IN THE PARKS.
THE Session being over, and politics in abeyance, in
the present quiescent state of the dominions of her Majesty,
our contemporaries are reduced to fly for intelligence to the
vegetable and animal kingdoms. Qne of them, the other
day, thought it necessary to call public attention to a des-
rate attack made by a sparrow-hawk on a goldfinch.
Wonderful turnips make their appearance by cartloads, and
a regular shooting season of stars has commenced in the
columns of the journals. The sea-serpent has again shown
himself, in spite of having been crushed by PROFESSOR
Owen, and continues to hold up his head at intervals, not-
withstanding that there are six rifle-balls in it, fired by aS
many Irishmen, right through his eye. For, our part-
always prepared to comment on the topics of the day—we
have an observation to make on the extraordinary ravages
which certain Mice are committing in the Parks. , The
western extremity of St. James's, Park is laid, completely
waste; the plantation which formerly flourished there having
been destroyed as if by locusts. A large portion of the
Green Park is disfigured by an inclosure of wood, which
these insignificant but mischievous creatures have con-
structed to surround the Marble Arch; by way of hoarding,
for much longer than the winter. Th: damage done by
these animals in the Parks will cost from first to last, it is
apprehended, at least £17,000 or £18,000.
By a transition from Natural History to Moral Philosophy
—and taking into account the circumstance of the sittings
of Parliament being suspended, and MR.J.QSEPH HUME,
as well as the most influential persons of the metropolis
being out of town—we may remark, that the conduct of
these mice, which constitute the Woods and Forests variety
of the mouse, only serves to exemplify the good old adage,
that “when the cat is away the mice will play.”
Tribute to Haymau.
“A LETTER from Vienna,” says the Morning Post,
“states that GENERAL BARQN. HAYNAU, is to be imme-
diately raised to the dignity of Field-Marshal.” By giving
HAYRAt a Field. Marshal's idion, the Austrian Govern.
ment will certainly show its gratitude towards him; but
it would evince a more discerning sense of his services
if it were to present him with a hangman's cat. Perad-
venture the lifton is meant to compensate, the woman-
whipper for that stick which he was obliged to cut the
other day.
A QUESTION TO THE FRENCH.
Now, be candid, and tell the truth! Would you not
be glad to part with all your change if you could but get

• THE STOCKS IN AID of THE PULPIT.
WE all know, that secular and religious instruction, ought to be
united; indeed that the former is not worth a button, unless combined
with the latter. Therefore everybody agrees that religion must be
taught by all means. In the meantime nobody has succeeded hitherto
in devising any means, by which it, may be taught effectually. The
affections rather than the intellect have to be tutored—there is the
difficulty. It is easy to cram the head with creeds: but how to
inspire the heart with pious sentiments? łº, all men, to know that
this discovery—which, of course, infinitely beats the invention of the
Electric Telegraph—has been made; and that, will it be believed ? by
some humble country, magistrates whose very names are at present
unknown. The Lincolnshire Times first, announced it to the world in
the subjoined unassuming pa ph, which we copy from the Morning
Post, under a heading furnished, we suspect, by our oligarchical con-
temporary:—
“SALUTARY PUNIshwe NT.-Gainsborough has been kept in a state of considerable
excitement during the week, by the exhibition of a number of boys being placed in
the stocks in the Market-place, for the crime of Sunday gaming. They were sentenced
to be confined three hours each ; two of them had their turn on Monday morning,
between the hours of seven. and one; others were confined on Wednesday and
Thursday.”
This is the way to teach the proper observance of the Sabbath, and,
by parity of reason, religious knowledge at large. Rightly to direct
the steps of youth—put their feet in the stocks. How beautifully
simple! Whilst the philosophical preceptor is lº himself in
the endeavour to soften callousness and enliven stupidity, so as to beget
some sort of sensibility to celestial influences, the Gainsborough
justices solve the problem in a trice by their converting apparatus.
The annoyance of an uncomfortable position and the stimulus of
banter must obviously produce the impression which the Post or the
Lincolnshire Times “salutary;” in other words must dispose the
mind of the patient to serious and contrite meditation. No doubt
the stocks have convinced these boys of the wickedness of Sunday
chuck-farthing; for it is not probable that they desecrated the day
by lansquenet, or any other species of gambling equally high. This
is the age of machinery; but here we have a mechanical. instru-
ment performing a spiritual function; the stocks superseding the
~
preacher. The Gainsborough authorities must really send this inge-
nious instrument—their contrivance for the conversion of juvenile
sinners—to the Exhibition of 1851, to be tried by all those who are
willing to put their foot in it.
THE FRATERNAL DEMOCRATS.
WHEN folks of choicest º and best education champion
HAYNAU, as only the sanguinary tool—the material whip or sabre in the
hand of Austria, and therefore ask for him the most charitable construc-
tion of the soldier's dastardly and bloody doings—they ought not to
marvel when the unlearned humble give utterance to their exultation
at the º teaching of the executioner at the henceforth historical
brewery of BARCLAY AND PERKINs. A few persons self-dubbed the
Fraternal Democrats, have met to express their sympathy with the
teacher draymen; but we should hope that, however the teachers ma
receive the meaning of goodwill, they will reject the mode in which
such sympathy is expressed. One frate speaker declared his
Fº regret that HAYNAU had not been boiled in a vat ; another
ull of brotherly love was profoundly touched that the General had not
been sent to the infernal regions to keep a place for his master. All
this is very wrong—but when we find Austria supported in choicest
leading articles written by scholars and gentlemen, are we to wonder at
the strong Doric of costermongers, º: in opposition?
As for the Fraternal Democrats, whence—after such homicidal
aspirations—do they derive their fraternity? From ABEL: Surely
not; but from ABEL's brother. We advise them straightway to drop
the connection.
No doubt these men, in their way, admire Liberty; but we would as
soon trust the mountain, nymph to admiring satyrs, as resign Liberty
to the brotherly love of the Fraternal Democrats.
ATTRACTION OF THE BOTTLE.
SoME “bottle-nose whales” have been seen of Ireland. It is but
fair to infer, then, that they were pointing their noses towards Cork.

THE REAL STATE OF THE CASE.
From the “Own Correspondent” of the “Wiener Zeitung.'
LL the facts of the
conspiracy to which
our beloved hero had
lately well-nigh fallen
a victim, have been
traced to theirsource:
and we can state from
undisputed authority
that the BARCLAY-
PERKINs Is H dray-
men were not in the
a slightest degree im-
plicated in that ne-
farious transaction.

formed accounts have
averred, the English
|. brutally pre-
- judiced in favour of
their own method of brewing, and preferring that horrid compound of treacle and logwood, &c.
ºE. negroes are continually boiled), to the purer and thinner beverage of the continents
of Europe.
And as the British beat their wives, and are encouraged by law to do so, zwar with a stick
that is only finger-thick, it is not to be º that the correction of a female by the rod,
as performed by the orders of the officers of His Imperial and Royal Majesty, in the ever-memo-
rable-and-over-the-Hungarians-victorious campaign, should inspire, any indignation in the
Thames capital. The real truth has only lately, and in an irrefragable manner, come to light.
Spies or Government subordinates were set upon the dwelling of the Field Marshalso soon
as His Excellency reached —'s; nor of this can it complained be, as the practice is adopted
universally in our own parental state. And it being ascertained that he was about to visit the
BARCLAY-PERKINsish Brewery, the enemies of this great man, who are the enemies of order
and peace in Europe, determined this great peace-and-order-supporter to destroy.
Emissaries of the O— were º: to Bankside to agitate the thousand
workmen there; but these men, knowing nothing of foreign disputes, and careless whether
FRAU Von MADERsBACH had or had not met with a treatment which is of daily occurrence in
England, refused to listen to the instigations of the Minister of the F-O—, and that
spirit of mischief was left to work for himself.
Two hundred thousand barrels dºppel X, two thousand tuns of “stout,” two hundred
fifty-two thousand “hocksheads” of “schweips,” were ordered for the Court cellars from
MEssRs. BARCLAY and PERKINs, and the price of the cerevisian supply £175,000, that instant
paid by LORD P-, with a check at sight on the First Lord of the Treasury.
RARCLAY was made a Realm-Peer, under the title of Baron Swipington; his eldest son
a Bishop; and his daughter a Maid of Honour.
PERKINs, was created Knight, of the Garter of the first, class, and Colonel of the 10th
Guard Regiment; his son was raised from the rank of Midshipmite, Marine-Officer of the 10th
-º-º:-

| class, and made Admiral of the Blue; MRs. PERKINs was created Countess Tunbridge,
–for PERKINs, º be of the popular party, refuses any title but his own of simple
baronet, which gives him his seat in the Unter-haus.
By these bribes to the chiefs, and by the promise that B– Parliament's mitgliep for
the grafschaft of Middlesex, would give the men and their families a white-bait “feed” at
Greenwidge, the men of the BARCLAY and PERKINSIsh establishment were withdrawn from
the Brewery, and their places were supplied by the clerks of the F-Q—.
LoRD P-, the Secretary for F-n Affairs, LoRD E., the Under Secretary, each commanded
a division: LORD P. wore a shovel-hat, which, by Bishops and draymen is alone worn in
Briton. LORD E. was in breeches of crimson plush, with the national boots called high-lows.
HERR Q.F., G. X., and the runners and officials of the office, were placed about the premises,
along with the most athletic Members of the House of Commons, who support the desperate
policy of the Foreign Minister.
When His Excellency the Baron appeared, the signal was given by the overthrowing of a
grain-shovel full on his head, and then the attack too #. whereof our papers have given an
account only too faithful, and for which every subject of His Majesty the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA
and KING of HUNGARY will demand a bloody reparation. You may rely on this account as
the only genuine one.
INTERPRETATION OF AMERICAN SENTIMENTS.
Kossuth in captivity—from which speedy liberation to him—writing to GENERAL CAss–
calls that officer “a worthy interpreter of the generous sentiments of the great American
people. - -
º: brave Hungarian may not know, perhaps, that certain sentiments of the great American
º require, interpretatiºn, and that ºf a very partial kind, to be understood as generous,
heir notion of human flesh being if black—“a species of property,” bespeaks a sentiment
rather short of generosity. The sentiments, too, which dictated their recent law, in regard
to runaway slaves, need a clever interpreter to reconcile them, with anything like nobility
qr magnanimity, except a magnanimous contempt of the Christian religion, and a noble
disregard of common justice and humanity.
THE DUKE IN THE PARKS.
THE DUKE of WELLINGTON, has been ap-
pointed to the Rangership of the parks. For
many years he has, by bronze, proxy, and almost
in primitive gardening attire, held gership of
Hyde Park; but now he is actual Ranger on full
service. e Times hopes that His Grace will
turn his attention to the improvement of his
nominal domains; and Punch is, of course, ready
with a practical suggestion.
The greatest of men have delighted to end
where the first manbegan,-inagarden; CowLEY’s
picture of DiocLETIAN in the shade is, in these
days, familiar to the lightest reader. Moreover,
yeterans delight to fight their battles over again.
Therefore, says Punch, let the Duke combine the
two delights; and whilst soothing his last days
with the amenity of trees, and shrubs, and flowers,
—let him, in a manmer, so lay out and plant
Hyde fark, that the world may have green and
growing recollections of two or three of the
mightiest achievements of ARTHUR, the Ranger.
Thus, the Duke might give us Torres, Vedras
beautifully laid out; and every year describe,
upon a small scale, the field of Waterloo, marking
the different, armies , with different coloured
rockets, double and single. Nothing could be
prettier than to have a field of battle rendered
in flowers: things of death and bloodshed “turn’d
to prettiness and favour.” . A very respectable
Belgian Lion might be planted and cut in cedar;
a lion that should afford from its tail and mane
a sprig for the button-hole of every member,
foreign and British, of the Peace Congress, who,
in Hyde Park, would hold most triumphant
gatherings. The Duke, in his day, has surely had
sufficient of parks of artillery—there is now open
to him a new command in the laying out of parks
of timber; parks with walks instructively ordered,
and beauti ": illustrated. With just half-a-
dozen lessons from MR. PAxton, and F. M. THE
DUKE OF WELLINGTON will cultivate fresh
laurels on the fields of Hyde and St. James.
And thus, instead of rushing to see the Duke
review the Household Troops, we shall have all
the world at gaze, delighted with WELLINGTON's
Tulip Show.
THE WERNON GALLERY'S HOLIDAY.
PAssING, the other day the end of Pall Mall,
our eye, which is always tumbling from side to
side, ğı upon the gates of Marlborough House,
where we read the intimation that "The Vernon
Gallery is closed for the holidays.” . The idea of
pictures requiring a holiday, struck us, at first,
as rather odd, but when we remembered how long
the unfortunate inmates of the Vernon Gallery
were confined in a dark cellar, we felt that to
grudge them a holiday, for the purpose of getting
a little fresh air, would have been an act of
cruelty. Many a painting which had been once
“the picture of health,” had begun to lose its
colour in the black hole, at. Trafalgar Square,
and we have no doubt the holiday has been given
in the hope that the members of the gallery may
find means of renovating their frames, and im-
proving their complexions, after the very lon
confinement they underwent in the close crowde
cellar to which public parsimony and bad taste
had consigned them.
The Force of Experience.
It seems that the Constabulary force is to take
the Census of Ireland next year. This appoint-
ment is not so ridiculous as, at first sight, it
may appear; for, with the pugnacious habits of
the country, it stands, to reason that none are so
well qualified for taking the Irish population as
the Constabulary.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BYRON'S MAZEPPA.
ASTLEY’s Edition.
STLEY’s has long been the Theâtre His-
torique of the Surrey Side of the water,
where the student may have seen peculiar
lights—the dramatic footlights — thrown
upon some of the principal events of both
the ancient and modern era.
Not stopping short at our histories, the
administration of ASTLEY’s have sometimes
taken our poets in hand, and . ByRoN's
Mazeppa has, for some time, enjoyed the
benefit of an Amphi-theatrical edition. The
ability and success with which this has
been brought out, may be judged from the
fact of the great popularity of the ASTLEY
- version, of which there has been a re-issue
this year, and we were present not long ago, with some thousand or
two of other subscribers, on the eighty somethingth—we plead guilty to
the coining and uttering—occasion of its delivery. -
There are, some important deviations from the text of BYRON in
the Asſº's edition, as the following analysis of the latter will
testify:—
The curtain rises on a court-yard, with a sentinel on the watch, whose
duty, like those of stage sentinels in general, appears, to be to mistake
human voices for the wind, and to see nothing. While he is pacing the
practicable platform, a portion of the “Machinery by MR. R. SMITH"
-a stalwartform—that of Mr. Hicks—crosses the stage, and invokes
Olinska in a voice which induces the sentinel to remark on the loudness
of the wind, and to walk off at the wing—a palpable desertion of his
post-for the purpose, probably, of ascertaining ‘what's in the wind,”
instead of looking before him to find out who is in the court-yard. The
coast being quite clear, Olinska, a young creature in Adelaide boots and
a brown i". appears at a window, from which she issues to stand
upon a sort of coping stone—for there is no balcony. The interview is
not very satisfactory, for Olinska, seized with a sudden sense of the im:
ropriety of the proceedings, declares, she will have “no more of this.”
at, in fact, MR. Hicks must “ask Papa,” and, hopping off the ledge,
she retires within the window.
The next scene reveals the fact, that Olinska has been promised to a
Palatine whom she has never set, eyes on, and MR. Hicks, who seems
tº get a private interview with the young lady whenever the exigencies
of ; plot require it, proposes a flight to the Desert. At this Qlinska
turns patriotic, and won't go among “her country's enemies; ” when
her papa coming in, takes no further notice of her tete-à-tée with MR.
Hicks, than to appoint him “officer of the men-at-arms,” or head beef.
eater. The arrival of Olinska’s intended now takes place, combining
“a splendid cavalcade” of six horses, who will insist on dancing to the
music, and the rear is brought u % a sort of French bedstead on
wheels, from between the curtains of which issues the “werry identical”
Palatine. We had forgotten to mention that the cortège is received
and marshalled by a comic Chamberlain of the Household, who
exclaims every now and then, “I believe you, my boy” to Drolinsko
a sort of facetious gentleman-usher, represented by that renowned
“clown to the ring,” the famous BARRY. M.R. Hicks is in a frightful
state during the whole proceedings, Apostrophising his “rebel nature”
as he would a too playful º he desires it to “keep down;” he
shakes his fist at everybody and everything, though nobody sees him.
He mutters “vengeance or death” in Olinska’s ears, and not only
exemplifies the great truth, that “none are so blind as those who won’t
see;” but also that in refusing to see, there is none more resolute than
a dramatic rival, father, chamberlain, attendant, or courtier. On the
night of our visit, the energetic tragedian positively tumbled over a
W
2x
ole row of tassel-booted feet of nobles, which, if the Polish aris-
.*. as liable to corns as our peerage must be, º from the
great EISENBERG testimonials, must have rendered them painfully
sensible of MR. Hicks's presence.
We next find the lovers enjoying another tete-à-tête without any one
being at hand to look after the young lady or to collar and kick out the
gentleman. He reproaches, her, as a “fair pestilence,” a “beauteous
treason; ” he might as well call her a “lovely measle,” a “precious
rheumatism,” or “an enchanting burglary;” and she, overpowered by
these harsh epithets, declares her heart is his, though her hand must
be another's. This is quite enough for MR. Hicks, who swears to
deserve her; and the comic Lord Chamberlain, who has been present,
with his eyes and ears shut, during the whole time, prepares to escort
Olinska to the Tournament. The tourney comes off in sight of Olinska,
Papa, and the Palatine, all seated under an ornamental shed; while
MR. Hicks and others contend, first with battle-axes, then with lances,
and, ultimately, having come to fisty-cuffs, they pelt each other with
their helmets. MR. Hicks, of course, yanquishes every thing that
comes in his way, and has a wreath dropped on to his head from the hand
of Olinska. Papa, who has no doubt found it dry work, calls for a
goblet, and drinks the health of the affianced pair in a long draught of
wool—the usual dramatic beverage.
The tournament is closed in by a pair of flats which form the
Palatine's bedroom, and we find the Palatine escorted to bed by several
attendants, with ordinary links—such as are used by our modern link-
boys—and who leave him to undress and “turn in * by the light of a
solitary candle. He is just going to make himself comfortable for the
night when a gentleman in a black velvet dressing-gown, put on the
wrong side before, coming open at the pack, and displaying a large red
cross on the wearer's chest, rushes iſ, and challenges the Palatine to
single “cumbut.”. A fight ensues, the Palatine yields, the intruder's
dress comes off all in one piece, as if he was going to change into
Harlequin, and MR. Hicks stands revealed before us; alarm bells are
rung; Olinska’s papa appears, and dooms MR. Hicks to be sent adrift
on the back of a wild horse that has been found quite untameable.
The horse is brought, and the groom, in order to show off the animal's
wildness to the best advantage, makes him walk on his two hind-legs,
and by various pinches tries to frighten him into a sufficient state of
savageness. The brute, of whom Byron says—
“'Twas but a day he had been caught,”
but who is, in fact, a veteran member of BATTY's stud, a most attentive
horse to his business—never missing a cue, or ºf at a rehearsal,
but always with his eye on the stage, manager—is then led off that
MR. Hicks, may be fastened on to his back, and a sieve of oats being
shaken on the O. P. side, the animal darts across the stage from the
P. S. wing to make for the tempting provender. A fresh sieve being
stationed at the exit from each of the three ranges of platforms, the
sa º: beast canters from side to side in pursuit of corn under
culties.
In the next scene we have the horse standing as quiet as a lamb,
chewing a bean given him to keep him steady—most probably by the
adroit hand of Mazeppa himself, who attributes the courser's quiescence
to “exhausted nature” instead of to the farinaceous bonbon that has
just been administered. The bean being discussed, and the well-known
sound of the corm-sieve being heard at the wing, the horse moves
towards the “old familiar,” measure, and MR. Hicks, exclaiming
“Again he urges on his wild career,” is carried off by the business like
quadruped.
In the next scene we find him between two set pieces of water, one
of which has a wolf's head mailed on to the top, which the hand of a
carpenter alternately raises and depresses, while a judicious manage-
ment of a few oats by another hand keeps the mouth of the horse
continually bobbing up and downto give it a sortof undulating movement.
While this is going on, that “well-known property,” i. theatrical
“bird of prey,” who flapped his wings for one hundred successive
nights in Der 'Freischaf, and who having lost all his youthful buoyancy,
is obliged to be supported in the air by wires; that feathered member
who looks like a couple of funeral plumes fastened on to a small hearth-
broom for a body; comes and hovers over MR. Hicks, to represent the
“expecting raven” who is supposed to be waiting to pick a bit of MR.
Hicks at the earliest opportunity. An apropos display of oats at the
wing, sets the horse once more in motion; until at length a storm
opportunely comes on, which knocks down a tree, behind which four
grooms are enabled to tie the animal’s legs, hold him down by his tail,
and otherwise prepare him to show the effects of “exhausted nature,”
when the tree is cleared away, and a tableau is discovered, in which the
horse is seen thoroughly worn out, with the exhausted Mr. Hicks still
secured to him. The horse has, it seems, found his way to Tartary,
where there is a poor old Khan in a very tottering state, who ought to
be called a water-khan, for he is constantly in tears, which flow still
more rapidly, when he discovers in Mr. Hicks his “child!” his “boy lº
his “long-lost son P’ who is recognised by a “jewelled star” on his
“boosom,” which §§ so tremendously shaken, has never been taken
away from him. The Khan has two conspiring generals, who want his
throne—a small camp-stool brought on
sceptre—a sort of dusting-brush made of feathers, and used for ºf
picture-frames. The Khan has a court of three faithful elders wit
very long beards of yery white tow, and rather scanty cloaks, evidently
| made of the same piece of stuff, as if the elders had bought between
them a cheap remnant.
The conspiring generals have got twelve soldiers, who say “We Will!”
to everything that is proposed; but when a dispute arises between the
Khan and the rebel chief, the former orders a curtain to be drawn aside,
and the very same twelve men—we know them again by their high-lows
—are standing ready drawn up to assist their º in some unin-
telligible plan for “invading Poland.” MR. Hicks himself, now the
acknowledged heir of the Khan, is placed at the head of the cavalry—
a body of six in chintz dressing-gowns—and mounts the “Wild Horse,”
whose wildness has all been taken out of him by a good feed, and he
becomes instantly civilised, falling into his place in the procession,
keeping time to the music, and conducting himself in every way like a
decent member of MR. BATTY's company.
The Khan and his subjects proceed to invade Poland with the ten
horse, the twelve foot, and several young women whom we had seen
y a stage-carpenter—and his

before at the Court of Laurenski, and who are now leading a zebra, who
goes to every battle at ASTLEy's, a couple of miniature poneys who were
certainly at the siege of Moultan, and a refractory stag, who is obliged
to be kicked, pushed, and }; to make himi" . anywhere.
On arriving in Poland, Olinska’s bridal festival—having been put of
all this time for dramatic effect—is being celebrated by a characteristic
{. when MR. Hicks, appearing at the top of the staircase, claims his
eloved; and as he is not allowed to take the lady, he proceeds to take
the whole kingdom, which is speedily effected by the twelve highlowed
mercenaries who said “We Will!” to all the propositions of the rebel
general. Poland succumbs, in the midst of blue and red fire—a large
shovelful of which is suddenly thrust out from a hole in the front of the
stage—and MR. Hicks, clasping Olinska in his arms, with the poor old
Khan overbrimming with emotion at his side, waves a Tartar flag, and
the curtain falls on the
TRIUMPH OF MAZEPIPA.
We ought not to terminate our analysis of this Astleian edition of
BYRON without adding that it is brought out in splendid style, like
everything else at this popular place of amusement, and that MR. Hicks
gives the utmost possible effect to all the words set down and the situa-
tions prepared for him. Though the Mazeppa of AstLEY’s is not exactly
that of the poet, it is a great deal more effective than the latter could
have been for the purpose designed, and we should have no objection to
read Byron all through with the aid of Mr. Barry's brilliant spectacles.
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PARKS.
CUT up the Parks? And wherefore not,
To please an influential taste?
Fear we the People * Not a jot.
They'll see their “Playgrounds” all defaced,
And only raise a futile growl,
An empty hiss, a harmless howl.
The People? Nonsense! Who are they?
The Rabble, Populace, and Mob;
Think you we care for what they say?
What can they do to stop our Job 2
Why, we’ll shut up their “Playgrounds” next,
They’ll only grumble if they’re vexed.
The Press 2 And what’s the Press to us?
It tells us what the Public think.
Well—let it make its daily fuss,
And waste its weekly floods of ink:
It only pelts us with its wit,
And we don't feel that when we’re hit.
The Statue upon BURTON's arch,
Not merely the Duke’s monument,
Commemorates a glorious march
Stolen upon GENERAL Discontext.
And so we’ll treat the Parks, in spite
Of clamour, just as we think right.
We know we’re safe—there; that’s the fact.
No Opposition we’ve to dread.
Were we from Office to be pack'd,
Whom could you have just now instead?
The Court won’t much blame what we do:
And for the Nation—pooh, pooh, pooh!
As long as in the People's House
The People have their present share,
At least we will not stick to chouse
hem out of exercise and air;
And with their pence º ducks and drakes
To fill their ornamental lakes.
Headless Hoax.
THE boldest of the Irish gentlemen who have described the Sea-
ent, infers that it is a great electric eel, from the circumstance that
an individual of his crew received a shock of electricity from one of the
sprats disgorged by the nauseated monster into the boat. If the same
sensitive person were to pick up a partridge just shot, it is to be pre-
†. º some of the charge that killed the bird would hit him in
e Iland.
THE Austrians say that thrashing women is perfectly allowable in war;
for FREDERICK THE GREAT notoriously thrashed MARIA THERESA.
WHY did NAPOLEON thrash the Austrian Generals when he said so
many of them were old women?
THE FRENCH IMPROVING.
To M. SCRIBE.
Y DEAR Monsieu R,
- I Ask you, as
a great Operatic au-
thority, whether the
usual conduct of
our people on pub-
ic occasions, is not
precisely , like the
acting of chorus-
singers and super-
numeraries on the
- stage of a theatre
N. Whether your in-
N surrections—revolu-
tions—political de-
monstrations – are
not, in fact, so much
melodrama? I think
ou will reply, yes.
§. will probably
confess, also, that
this melodrama is a
little too serious.
Real bloodshed —
firing with actual
ball, you will admit
to be somewhat
over-melancholy. , And besides that, as compared with our Adelphi per-
formances in this kind, you will own that those enacted in your streets
are remarkable for an absolute want of fun. You have plenty of
O. SMITHs, but no MR. WRIGHT or MR. PAUL BEDFORD. Your horrors
and sentiment lack the relief of drollery. I speak generally; and very
glad I was to observe a case of exception to this rule which occurred
the other day on your President’s return to Paris. Whilst your mob
was hallooing and bawling with their usual enthusiasm, says the Times’
correspondent, L
“An omnibus passed, or tried to pass, through the dense crowd, and the driver, who
must have been somewhat of a wag, stood up in his seat, and taking off his large and
yellow glazed hat, bowed with the utmost gravity and politeness to the right and left,
to the windows on both sides, and kissed his hand to the women who were waving their
pocket-handkerchiefs, just as if he were fully convinced that the cries of ‘Vive le
Président 1 ''Vive Napoléon 1' and even “Vive la République / " were solely intended for
himself. This incident restored every one to his good humour; ‘inextinguishable
laughter’ met his improvised dignity, and the only unanimity that was observed on
the occasion was when the shout of ‘Vive le Cocher /' followed him to the end of the
street.”
This bit of jovial buffoonery is delightful, after one has been nauseated
by reading of maidens in white offering bouquets to the President, and
such like imbecilities. The whole occurrence is the most hopeful indi-
cation that has been evinced by your public for some time. Such an
appreciation of ...]"; on the part of Frenchmen, is like a touch of
compunction exhibited by a supposed reprobate. I am very much
delighted, indeed, to find your countrymen beginning to laugh at the
moc ‘...". : susceptibility of that kind would have saved them from
many sad fooleries believe that they have acquired this perception
from us; with whom, to the immense diversion of everybody, a ro
procession or any other grand display, is invariably closed by a butcher
on horseback. The omnibus-driver—a capital fellow, whoever he is—
must have been imbued with English ideas. International commu-
nication is already benefiting you; British numour is correcting French
melodrama; and with the assistance of the submarine Electric Telegraph,
we shall, in time, make you jolly good fellows.
Accept, Monsieur, the assurance of my distinguished consideration,

PUBLIC indignation ought to be violently excited by a flagrant wrong
which is inflicted on the proprietors of powder-mills. The other day, a
fireworks-manufactory in Spitalfields exploded, and blew up the greater
rt of three streets. Similar occurrences are by no means rare.
here is no law, it would seem, to prevent fireworks-makers carrying on
their business in the most crowded neighbourhoods; subject, of course
to these casualties. It is most unjust that an adventurous individual
should not be suffered to work a powder-mill, under the same circum-
stances, and at a similarly trivial risk of blowing the surrounding
district into the air.

recent highly-popular cartoons of the Pre-

they are supposed to be, observes, that we
have made a random hit, and that the
“supposition” was the correct description,
for that “LoRD John Russell was one
day last week seen enjoying himself with
his children in sending up paper balloons
into the air, and chasing, them over the
lawn.” This in an ordinary personage
would no doubt be a pursuit bespeaking a
mind at ease, and wholly unoccupied with
graver objects; but is it not quite clear,
that in the case of LoRD JoHN RUssell,
the sending up pieces of #. is to be
in sport made statesmanship in earnest?
It is always essential for a Premier to know which way the wind blows,
and as the throwing up of a straw often determines the course of
events, why may not the despatching of a balloon lead to the same
important conclusion? The fact of LoRD JoHN's chasing the breeze-
wafted objects over the lawn would be called by his opponents a most
characteristic proceeding, for they would say, a Whig Minister always

THE INCOME-TAX RAISED UNDER THE ROSE.
“AN INHABITANT of HAMMERSMITH,” describing himself as “a
poor author,” has written a letter to the Times, complaining that,
whereas he returned himself, in answer to the income-tax queries, as
making £50 a-year by his pen, he has been assessed at £300, at which
rate he will be diddled out of nearly one-fifth of his earnings by the
Government. From other information we have received, we believe
that an extra wrench, generally, has been given to the vice of income-
taxation. Now is it, or is it not true, that the following communica-
tion has been issued to the Income-Tax Assessors?
“On Her Majesty’s Service, strictly Private and Confidential.
…
“You will * in the first place, to understand that your
situation will depend on your keeping this memorandum a profound
secret.
“The exigencies of Government ... require that the
Income-Tax should be rendered as available as possible for the increase
of the Revenue.
“You are aware that we are under the necessity of reducing our
embassies and consulates; that we cannot afford £2000 for the comple-
tion of the Criminal Law Digest, and are ºf: to make the veterans
whom we decorate, buy their own medals. rther, that we have had
to incur the heavy expense of MRs. WAGHoRN’s pension, whilst we
have been unable to allot more than the pittance of £12,000 a-year to
His Roy AL HIGHNEss the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE.
“It is also well known to you that we shall require above £26,000
for the alterations in the Parks, and a considerable sum besides to
build the PRINCE OF WALEs a coach-house and stables. "Our wish is
so to effect these important objects as, whilst giving full satisfaction to
illustrious personages, not to incur the unpopularity of proposing a
new impost.
“Our end would be gained at once by a direct increase of the
income-tax. But, warned by experience not to attempt that, we must
have recourse to its virtual augmentation; for which we require your
assistance.
“You will therefore please to have the goodness forthwith to raise
your assessments of all incomes derived from trades and professions;
and, in cases where a return has been made, to assess the income of
the party making the return as considerably higher than that stated
therein. It is needless to add that zeal in the performance of this
service, united with discretion, will not be forgotten.
“You are not to exercise any needless caution in making an advance
on your assessment of professional persons or tradesmen. HER
MAJESTY's Ministers are emboldened to impose almost any exaction
under the name of income-tax on those classes, by the consideration
that want of time, owing to the requirements of business, makes it
practically impossible for such persons to appeal against an overcharge.
Also, that the dislike, or dangers, of revealing their pecuniary affairs,
will induce them to submit to what, under different circumstances,
might perhaps be called the grossest extortion,
“We have, moreover, a strong reliance on the patience of those who
have so long—unresistingly, if not uncomplainingly—suffered their
casual earnings to be taxed as highly as the interest of fixed capi
“HER MAJESTY's Ministers can never forget the demonstration in
favour of loyalty and order made on the ever-memorable 10th of April,
by the classes that pay income-tax under schedule D., The Government
has no doubt whatever that they will repeat their admirable behaviour
on that occasion whenever it may be necessary. We therefore fearlessly
desire you to augment their assessment, under the said schedule, con-
fident that scarcely any provocation will overcome their love of peace
and quiet; and that they will the more willingly endure the burden,
from the idea that it has been imposed to maintain the splendour of the
DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, to please the taste of the Prince Consort, and
to provide for the PRINCE OF WALEs’s recreation.

the wickedness of railway directors who, in the
ursuit of the root of evil—which grows as I

Because the workpeople in the neighbourhood

Blind Competition.

tribute works of Art and Industry to the Ex-
hibition of 1851. The prize, however, must
be carried off by Government, if it, only thinks
of sending in as its contribution the WINDow

most perfect specimen of Blindness that was ſever
put before the eyes of a nation.
PENNY-A-LINING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
THE i.p.: snobs who are employed to eaves-drop under the
windows of royalty, complain very bitterly of the difficulty of getting
near HER MAJESTY and PRINCE ALBERT at their retreat in Scotland.
An unhappy penny-a-liner, writing from “CRATHIE,” says:–
“Balmoral Castle is well situated for seclusion. It is a work of time and labour to
approach it.”
It seems there is no inn nearer than two miles off, and—
“These two miles give no idea of the distance to be traversed between the two
laces, because, the Inn being on the opposite side of the Dee, when you have gone the
ength indicated, you are only opposite, not at the Castle; you must continue your
journey until you reach a bridge—a rather ricketty suspension—which will be found
at Crathie, a mile farther on; that crossed, you have then of course to retrace your steps
another full mile; so that the real distance between the Royal residence and that of
any stranger is somewhat more than four miles.”
We congratulate the QUEEN and PRINCE on the inaccessibility of
their position, which has doubtless been chosen, for the purpose o
baffling those impertinent imbeciles who would otherwise waylay them
in their walks, and dodge their movements, in order to contribute a
column or two of trash to “our own reporter’s” department of the
newspapers. Thanks to the judicious selection of their retreat, the
royal pair supplied material to the baffled penny-a-liner for nothing but
the remark *
“This week has been wholly spent by the Court in the enjoyment of quiet.”
We are rather amused at the idea of the “ricketty suspension '.
over the Dee, for we have a shrewd suspicion that the bridge alluded
to has º placed there as a piège to the audacious penny-a-
liner, who, in his ardour to force his way into the family circle of the
QUEEN, might be tempted to trust himself once too often to the
ricketty bri ; and find himself the victim of a well-merited ducking.
We wish that some ingenious mechanist would prepare, to exhibit at
the forthcoming Exposition, an article on the principle of the steel-trap,
to seize intruding noses, as the latter article catches hold of trespassing
legs, for we are convinced that a little machine of the kind would com.
mand the patronage of PRINCE ALBERT as a sort of corrective to im-
pertinent curiosity. . If any artist, should be successful in inventing
something of the kind, we would suggest the Anti-Proboscis as an
appropriate name for it.

THE CELESTIAL FAMILY.
THE newspapers ought really to open a new department of BIRTHs,
to chronicle the frequent and almost daily increase which the stars
are making to their already numerous family. We find from a recent
letter of MR. J. R. HIND, who writes to the Times from the “Inner
Circle of the Regent's Park,”—which is perhaps a “ring” of one of the
planets overlooking the vicinity specified—that he has to record “another
interesting addition” to the solar system, by the introduction of a new
member, of which the constellation Pegasus has been safely delivered:
This “new member” is announced as “the twelfth of the group,” and
the third in reference to which MR. J. R. HIND has been, as he says,
“fortunate enough” to act as a sort of astronomical accoucheur, or
scientific man-midwife. -
We have made enquiries at the Greenwich Observatory, and are glad
to hear that the great planet PEGAsus, and the little one, are both
going on very favourably, and are, indeed, “doing as well as can be

ST. PEOPLE'S PARK.
MR. PUNCH,-I, for one,
will not believe in
the wicked report
that some enemy to
the House of Guelph
has set afloat, that it
is the intention of
the QUEEN — sup-
}: and abetted by
her Ministers—to cut
off a large slice from
St. James's—I mean
St. People's Park, in
order to add the
stolen bit to the gar-
dens of Bº
Palace. Is it like her

to take from her thou-
sands of children, of
larger wth an

tary bitofgreensward,
that the PRINCE of
WALEs and his bro-
thers and sisters
might enjoy the bit
of turf so scurvily acquired? I won’t believe it.
Such an act would cloud the eyes of a *... that have ever
looked affectionately upon our little QUEEN. She º gain an acre or
two of land, but it would be at the cost of a large bit of the nation's
heart. Talk of court mourning; why, Mr. Punch, with any, portion of
St. People's Park taken from the People, I would certainly advise a
people's ing; rib and green at every man's button hole.
on every woman's bomet, on every defrauded infant's cap. But it
cannot be—I won't believe it. . -- --
Again, would the Whigs strike such a coward's blow? Is it likely
that the chivalrous RusséLL would wait until the House of Commons
was left to the nocturnal mice, and he, the Minister, was far away on
the everlasting Scottish hills, before the attempt to purloin the people's
roperty was made, in the name of the QUEEN ? Is it likely that any
nglish Minister, would incur the charge of such flagrant injustice,
masked by such pitiful poltroonery? I won’t believe it. -
Further: would the DUKE, OF WELLINGTON accept, the Rangºrship
of St. People's Park, only by his valiant name to authorise court pillage;
“Why, that’s it,” says Chartist—“that’s exactly it. The ster
believed that º any attempt to defraud the people of their property,
the people would rebel; and the Duke was, of course, made Ranger that
he might bring his military genius to the aid of the Crown, and by any
means, awe and put down the discontented mob.” So says Chartist,
but ºf won't believe it. -
And, finally, is it likely that a wise regard for the growing fame of the
Prince or WALEs would put his innocent boyhood in a false position,
making him and his brothers and sisters the despoilers of tens of thou-
sands of brothers and sisters, the born inheritors of the greensward of
the Park of St. People? Such a beginning would be sullenly accepte
as an evil omen. Folks looking through the magnifying glass of time
would be all too likely to behold in little PRINCE ALBERT a future
bloated GeoRGE, THE FourTH, of gold-frog memory. No, Mr. Punch,
it is impossible that this can be: i to conclude,

THE IRISH SEA SERPENT.
(From Punch's own Correspondent).
. QN my, arrival at Kinsale, faithful to your instructions to get a
sight of the Sea Serpent at all hazards, I took a vessel, and put out
instantly, in spite of wind and weather, both of which were dead
against me, determined, as MR. Roger W. Travens says, “to go any
. ” to satisfy myself and your readers of the existence of that
monster.
My desire was soon gratified. An object resembling the letter S,
after the lapse of about three quarters of an hour, appeared in the
Iorizon, and gradually neared us, getting larger as it approached. At
the distance of a mile we could lainly see that it was an enormous
reptile, but whether of the º or saurian class we could not
te till it had come close to us. Even then our zoological knowledge
Fº inadequate to its exact classification. In your scientific opinion
think it would have appeared very like one of the cetacea. MR.
TRAVERs is incorrect in stating that it is rather over than under }.
fathoms long. The reverse is the case, I should say, by an inch an
six-eighths. In diameter it may be about seven feet, ‘ſ will allow.
But the length and size of the Sea Serpent—for serpent, on the
whole, it appears to be—are not half so wonderful as its conformation,
which sets every canon of matural history at defiance. Depend upon it
wen,
although he may be a respectable man, deceives himself completely if he
believes in that imposture.
The head of this anomalous inhabitant of the deep, being covered
with scales, in some measure resembles that of a reptile, and this
similitude is heightened by the form of the snout, which is that of a
crocodile's, º terminating in a sort of trunk, like an elephant's.
The mouth is full of long, sharp teeth, besides a pair of enormous fangs
in the upper jaw. But the latter are like the canine teeth of a ºf:
ape, and this mark of alliance to the simiae extends to the cranium, the
frontal portion of which is as elevated as it is in the chimpanzee. In
§. of the length of the jaw, therefore, the facial º: is considerable.
nlike any other reptile that I have ever seen or heard of, the Sea
Serpent, moreover, has undeniable ears, which I can affirm, from close
observation, are as conspicuous as those of an ass. Its eyes are fur-
nished with regular, lids, as it proved by continually winking the left
one whilst it stopped looking at us. From the bloodshot appearance of
this eye, I have no doubt it was that which MR. TRAVERs and
friends fired their four bullets into. The crown and nape of the neck,
are surmounted, not with a mane, as has been erroneously stated, but
with a crest of feathers, and from above each eye protrude a species
of horns, which the creature draws in and out like those of a snail.
... Its body was certainly not that of an eel. It had no gills at all;
its respiratory apparatus consisted in a series of spiracles, or .#
oles, arranged in a row on either side of it, along its whole length,
marked by a line of a greenish hue. Above this line, and over the back,
the integument had a leathery appearance; below, it consisted of scales
of a silvery, whiteness. Between the spiracles, of which there were
forty in each row, were situated the organs of locomotion, being an
alternation of flappers and fins. Its tail was of a spiral form, like a
corkscrew, and terminated in an apparatus of loose bones, the collision
of which, I should have mentiomed, proclaimed its approach when at
least two miles off. It remained stationary on our starboard bow about
ten minutes, and then suddenly dived and disappeared.
Two large mamma, situated between the pectoral flappers, seemed to
d|indicate that the creature was a female.
From the above description the scientific naturalist will discern that
the Sea Serpent—the Irish variety at least—is a combination of the
lizard, the elephant, the ape, the cockatoo, the snail, the fish, the por-
oise, the rattlesnake, and the caterpillar. On the anatomical difficulties
involved in this complicated structure, I need not dilate, but, commend
them to the consideration of the College of Surgeons. -
Whether for our amusement, or its own, the Sea Serpent, whilst
under our inspection, kept alternately, tying itself up in knots, an
untying them, accompanying each contortion with a peculiar whistle,
I had a capital opportunity of shooting it, which I waived, aware that
you disapprove of the wanton destruction of animal life.
The Prince of Wales's Studies.
THE Court Circular every evening informs us that “the PRINCE of
WALEs enjoyed his usual exercise.” We have been given to understand
that his usual exercise” is half a º e of “Latin, Delectus,” and it
is a proof of his Royal Highness's re ; for study that his exercise is
matter of “enjoyment” to him. The Prince takes great pains with
his translations, and has already, it is said, asked his tutor when the
progress of his studies will bring him to the “translation of a Bishop,”
which the royal pupil has heard spoken of. The tutor, it is believed,
looks forward naturally enough to becoming himself the subject of such
a translation at the proper period.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AUSTRIAN SOLDIERS RAMPANT.
ALTHOUGH the stripes of HAYNAU have been salved by the sympathy,
and washed with the tears, perhaps, of his Tmperial Master and compa-
nions in arms—their smart does not appear to have derived much allevi-
ation from the unction of popular commiseration on the part of his
countrymen. From a Vienna letter in the Kölner Zeitung, as quoted
by the Times, we learn that, -
“Owing to the state of siege the news of the outrage committed upon GENERAL
HAYNAU met with a favourable reception by part of the population. ‘Three cheers
for Old England' was proposed in the coffee-houses.”
But the decorated of FRANCIs Joseph will perhaps care little for
ublic opinion—not impressed as it was the other day on the drubbed of
º. AND PERKINs's Draymen. And what are the sentiments of
his vulgar countrymen to the horsewhipped hero against the condolence
of his brother braves? one of whom, according to another account from
the above sources, thus characteristically expressed his indignation at
the flogging of the woman-flogger.
“In the Café Daum, which is haunted by our officers, there was, amidst the portraits
of other royal personages, a portrait of QUEEN Victoria. I say it was there, for it was
yesterday assaulted by a Croatian Officer, who, drawing his sabre with a volley of
imprecations, smashed it into atoms, while his comrades cheered him and cried ‘Bravo.’”
Bravo!—bravissimol Gallant º: gentleman'. A sword
drawn, with a volley of imprecations, on a lady’s picture, is an improve-
ment upon the peculiar gallantry of the Austrian army—a gallantry,
doubtless, equally peculiar in regard either to a woman or a foeman.
The valour of heroes of the HAYNAU breed really seems to consist in an
instinctive antipathy to the fair sex. Should there ever be a genuine
“Revolt of the Harem,” these would be the fellows to quell it! They
would prove a veritable scourge to the rebellious Odalisques. One more
specimen, in continuation of the foregoing, of the manhood of these
(unacknowledged) sons of MARs:—
“They rattled their swords in a most alarming manner, and they curse the islanders
“whom they cannot get at,’ and whom they long to ‘shiver, as the officer did the picture
of their QUEEN.”
Should they ever have the misfortune to “get at ” the denounced
islanders, the shivering, it may be pretty confidently expected, will be
rincipally on the side of these warriors who are such Tartars to the
les.

“SIR,-We understand that the Irish Roman Catholic Synod at

the Colleges are intended to purvey mere intellectual º:
the ºš. mutriment unobstructed to the legitimate vendors,
to anathematise them is, on the part of the priests, équivalent to cursing
butchers', bakers', or grocers' shops established by protestants, even
whilst their reverences are at liberty to consecrate, or purify if need be,
the beef, loaves, tea, sugar, and butter. They might as well have ex-
copamunicated the Indian meal and other provisions which Government
sent to Ireland to relieve its physical destitution. As Pius THE NINTH

STATUES OF THE GREEN AND GOOD.
THE Good Duke of CAMBRIDGE shall have a statue; an enduring
memorial of the cheerfulness and greenness of his old age. A statue
in much cheaper, and far more significant material than stone or
bronze. Althousand pounds or two would be demanded by the sculp-
tor tasked to produce a rera effigies of the distinguished diner-out;
fifty, or a hundred pounds at most, would purchase the material, an
liberally reward the artist proposed by Punch, to enshrine the memory
of the virtues of departed royalty.
The reader has, probably, among his oldest acquaintance, peacocks cut
in yew-tree; with, possibly, a dragon, or so, in box; original crea:
tions of the Dutch mind, flourishing in our gardens in the time of
Dutch William. Apam and Eve in hornbeam, all alive and shoot-
ing, were often found in the Edens of England. We have somewhere
read of a pig grown in lavender, that exhaled its sweetness in the
garden of a i. citizen, Now, all that Punch, proposes is, an
immediate return to the good old custom of growing the figure—as our
y primitive. Certain commentators on the Koran
make a fanciful affinity between man and trees, declaring, that from the
remainder of the clay of which ADAM was formed, were created the
cocoa-tree, with its black nut—“on which all the parts of a man's
head may be seen, mouth, nose, eyes, eyebrows, hair and whiskers”-
together with palm trees, and other arboreal benignities. There is a
beauty in the fancy, a reverence for palm and cocoa in the teful
superstition. But to proceed with our Man-Trees or Tree-Men of
verdant England. A
At the present time, there is a magnificent opportunity for Lord
SEYMoUR—our new sylvan Minister—to distinguish himself. Let
him lay out what remains to us of St. James's Park with an eye to
the planting of yew, box, holly, and other vegetable statues of men who
have deserved well of their country. Let him show how the Dutch
mode of clipping trees into peacocks and monsters may be improved
and elevated, by turning his creative shears to the cutting out and
pruning of men. Let us suppose that GEORGE THE THIRD and his
sons the two Fourths with, if you will, the Duke of York, flourished
in monumental yew in St. James's Park—should we not gain by the
change from metal to vegetable? Anyway, we may begin with the
statue of the Good Duke of CAMERInge, and the statue—or rather,
the tree for the statue—might be inaugurated with a º: serious-
ness, a glad º: due to the gravity of the subject, and highly
º to the feelings of the noblemen and gentlemen of the
mmittee.
And first, what tree shall be planted to grow, perennial statue, of the
good-natured CAMBRIDGE: Yew-tree? No: it is too funereal; even
the bees reject and shunit, Nevertheless, upon, occasion, a statue in
yew. may be found desirable, symbolic; namely, when an English
Sunday shall be put in deep black, and an Act of Parliament shall
dumb-found the very birds on the Sabbath, and stop the flow of the
Thames on the seventh day—then º we have a statue in congenial
ew of the noble, bilious Lord who shall achieve such glory, to etermise
s fame:–
“Nor wilding green, norwoodland flower,
Arise within its baleful bower.”
No, we will have none of yew for our CAMBRIDGE,--but a holly-tree,
holly, and no other. There are thoughts and recollections of Christmas
and Öhristmas fare—beef and plum-pudding—that, as other trees are
sacred to certain heathen heroes, as the poplar to HERCULEs, make the
#. the especial tree of the Good Duke of CAMBRIDGE. It is decided
en.
Our first green statue in St. James's is that of the good Duke, and Duk
the tree, the holly.
We cannot in our present page draw out a programme of the cere:
mony of planting the ducal tree; but the rite may be performed
with many significant meanings. Cicero—on the authority of PLINY
—would often irrigate his plane-trees with wine; and, in our day,
animals are buried under the roots of trees to make them fruitful;
witness the renowned tom-cat deposited under the gooseberry-bush
that, ever after, bore hairy gooseberries. Well, the holly planted—the
holly...that shall afterwards bear a monumental º (when
artistically cut) of the Good Duke of CAMBRIDGE, may be irrigated
with port or claret, º forth by BENJAMIN Bond CABBELL, from
an historiº wine-cooler of the London Tavern. A haunch of venison,
from the larder of the same hostelry, may also be deposited under the
roots of the holly to enrich and stimulate its sap. Holly, fed by claret
and yenison! it possible to º: a more fitting, a more truth-
s . monument to a man who eaten thousands of dinners for
the good of his country?
Well, the holly is planted, and the gardener-artist goes to work with
|into another and a better hero. Thus, a George the Fourth mig
THE Fourth duly planted, may demand of the artist an improved touch.
And so the gardener-sculptor—
From hollywood
Clips CAMBRIDGE good,
And then he trims the Georges, oh!
And here we may briefly ask, whether the custom of planting and
cutting tree statues of great men may not give more fitting employment
to much unregarded genius, doomed to the stone-yard, or we should
say, the stone-cupboard of the Royal Academy? Many a man who has
no chance of making a figure in marble, might flourish for years in
holly, box, or hornbeam. There would be work two or three times
every year upon the same effigy. For instance. Here is
cAMBRIDGE IN THE SPRING,
-ND IN THE win TER.
Thus, with memorial effigies cut in trees, there would be a ve
wholesome demand for surplus sculptors; and when St. James's Par
is green and alive with budding, shooting heroes, when it is an arboreal
Walhallawith the GeoRGEs, for instance, as green as were their subjects.
economy will have embraced beauty, and much ill-used bronze be sent
to the melting-pot. Again; if any of the tree-statues outlived the
reputation of their originals, the trees might be suffered to run wild—
to grow at their own sweet will—for a year or two, and then be º
e
suffered to outgrow even his own abdomen, and then be cut close to a
SHAKESPEARE or a Newton. And so, the sap that gave viridity to the
spendthrift king, may feed the necessities of the poet or philosopher.
Nor do we see any difficulty in the matter of inscription. On the
contrary; the inscription may be in admirable harmony with the
material of the effigy. Let us take our first holly statue—the Good
Duke of CAMBRIDGE. On a given piece of earth, at the foot of the
statue, may be grown, cut, and continually renewed, a record of the
e's many excellent qualities in cress and mustard. They would be
symbolical and pungent of the tavern salad. Or, indeed, the inscrip-
tion might be pricked out in civic º In the old heroic day we
know thatº crowned the temples of the hero. Very well; with
us it is said hero-worship is turned topsy-turvy; so let our great men
have the parsley at their feet.
A Common Councilman on Lending.
MR. CoMºMon Council MAN ANDERTON opposed the motion made to
lend books from the City Library. He was quite against such free
circulation of knowledge. The wizard further observed, “the worst
thing a man could do was to lend.”. ANDERton is wrong—grievously
wrong. The very worst thing a real man can do is to—borrow.

THE PARKS AND THE PEOPLE.
º Ust now it seems the
- |
Woods and Forests must
play at ducks and drakes
with the public money,
and, as it appears, that a
Park is necessary as a play-
ground for this costly and
yery unpopular sport, we
beg to suggest, that, in
order to spare Hyde Park,
St. James's, and the Green
Park, another Park should
be set apart for the Woods
and Forests to º their
pranks in. With a view to
carrying out this arrange-
ment, we have the pleasure
of submitting our own
Whetstone Park to the
notice of the authorities.
If a Park is wanted merely
for the purposes of jobbing,
there cannot be a better
locality, as there are two
orthree job-masters already
on the spot, and therefore
a few jobs more or less
cannot injure the neigh-
bourhood. We do not see
why a Rangership with a
“tremendous, salary” should not be attached to Whetstone Park,
and as to “alterations” designed for the º: giving jobs to
contractors and others, Whetstone Park, though limited in space, is
quite large enough to admit of the erection and pulling down of
arches, #. digging out and filling in of ground, together with such
other costly operations as are occasionally carried on in Parks more
frequented by the public than Whetstone, and therefore more deserving
of protection against the pranks of the Woods and Forests.
We could easily “hit off” a little plan for applying to Whetstone
Park a great deal of the expense—and consequent patronage—now
being occasioned by what is going on in those Parks that have been
called emphatically the play-ground of the Londoners. -
We would begin by throwing up an esplanade, commencing on the
south side of Little Turnstile, and terminating at a point exactly
opposite to the northern end of the pump-handle in the neighbourhood.
ere would be no difficulty in throwing up an embankment, for the
purpose of elevating the level, for the materials are all on the spot, as
the neighbourhood abounds in oyster shells, old shoes, and other similar
articles. We would, in fact, pledge ourselves that there shall be no
“engineering difficulties” in the way of raising the ground, if the public
will only raise, the money. At the Gate Street corner of Whetstone
Park we would erect a cistern, so that the gutter, now running through-
out the entire centre of the Park, may be converted into a piece of
ornamental water, which in purity, if not in extent, would be very
superior to the Serpentime. e would then lay down a “rotten row’’
from east to west, and a portion of the materials would be supplied from
the articles cast from their windows by the inhabitants.
When we reflect that all this and a great deal more might be done in
Whetstone Park, without cutting up the green turf, of which we have
not a foot too much for the recreation of the smoke dried iondoner.
we feel doubly the cruelty of the goings on in the West End Parks, and
we wish, at least, that the direction addressed to the public, who are
here and there requested to keep off the grass,” were respected by
the authorities themselves, and that they, with their waggons, their
Fº and their hoardings, would “keep off the grass” for the
uture.
–
Haymau's Entire Honours.
THE Times correspondent says—“The Austrian government will
show its sympathy for the insulted general by raising him at once to
the rank of a marshal.” How much will he owe to Barclay, and
Perkins ! May we not then trace the noble rank of Haynau till we
find it issuing from a bung-hole * What conquest in battle has not
done, a retreat from a brewery has effected. He who is not rewarded
for standing lead and iron, is made a Marshal for running from pewter!
SHAMPOOING MADE EASY.
ENGLISH travellers are informed, that on landing at Continental
custom-houses, where the practice of searching the person for contra-
band articles of traffic is enforced, the searchers, in the strenuous execu-
tion of their duty, will SHAMPoo them GRATIs. -
FEMALE BARRISTERS.
.AN attempt is made, every now and then, by an energetic lady, the
wife of an incarcerated barrister, to appear in the courts of law, and
argue before the judges. Whenever this lady presents herself in
counsel's place to make a motion, a terrible com-motion is the conse-
quence. . The learned judges are naturally opposed to the principle of
hearing ladies in court; for the precedent would be dangerous indeed,
as a fair pleader would, as a matter of course, make her own rule abso-
lute. A female bar would, no doubt, soon restore to Westminster
Hall its reputation for eloquence, and the name of “utter barrister”
would become appropriate indeed to a sex remarkable for its abundance
and volubility | utterance. The honours of the profession would not
be sought alter very º: for every female barrister would remain a
juni as long as she could; and the idea of being ranked as a
“senior” would be quite insupportable. . Perhaps, however, the offer
of a “silk gown” might occasionally be found irresistible, though we
do not see how the forensic costume could be preserved, inasmuch as a
ublic avowal that she wears a wig could never be expected from a
emale advocate.
THE GORDON IS CUMMING.
A ROAR FROM A WILD BEAST.
THE GoRDON is CUMMING, oh dear, oh dear!
The GoRDON is CUMMING, oh dear, oh dear!
To slaughter us wholly; that’s clear, quite clear.—
(I've a bullet of his in the rear, the rear).
He’ll cut us all up, branch and root, and root,
No creature he spares from pursuit, pursuit:
The King of the Beasts he will shoot, will shoot,
And the antelope, also, poor brute, poor brute!
He blows out the elephant’s brains, his brains,
His hand with giraffes’ blood he stains, he stains,
As he in his volume . explains,
Disregarding the animal’s pains, its pains.
The sea-cow he peppers, pop, pop, smash, smash!
She flounders and rolls in her gore, splash, splash!
At last goes a ball through her skull, crash, crash!
What a mercy it settles her hash, her hash!
Perhaps we were made with intent, intent,
That balls through our sides should be sent, be sent,
Our nerves were contrived to be rent, be rent,
And our bones to be shattered were meant, were meant.
If that is why we were sent here, sent here,
Of course ’tis all right—though 'tis rather queer—
And to put us to use in our sphere, our sphere,
MR. GoRDON is coming—oh dear, oh dear!
THE ATHOL PASSPORT OFFICE.
. AN office will shortly be opened in Edinburgh for the * of
issuing passports to Glen Tilt and other impassable passes of the Athol
estate. It is to be called the ATHol. PAssPoKT OFFICE. Travellers
will be expected to give their names, addresses, and occupations, and
motives for travelling, besides finding two sureties for their respect-
ability and good behaviour. Another stipulation also is, that they are
to carry neither gun, nor fishing-rod, nor fowling-piece, nor stick, nor
sword, nor knife, nor pencil, nor sketching apparatus, as the Duke is
determined that nothing, not even a view, º be carried off his estate
—at all events, not till a Court of Law has thrown it open, to the
public. Every passport will have his Grace's signature and seal, and a
rice, somewhat less than what is charged by LoRD PALMERston for a
"oreign Passport, will be demanded for it, so as to keep the country
within the walks of the very highest. This measure will have the effect
of increasing the Duke's income, even though it should close and make
still narrower the respect that is universally felt for the narrowness of
his ways, and the unenlightened selfishness of his views.
Haunted Churchyards.
It is º generally known that churchyards in this country
are infested by ghoulcs and vampyres. One “JUSTITIA,” however,
writes to the Times, stating that on sending a person lately into
Walthamstow churchyard to cut a new inscription out on his family
tomb, the man was pounced upon with a demand of ten-and-sixpence
and two half-crowns, by three horrible creatures in the shape of
the parson, the sexton, and the clerk.

THERE is a society organising in favour of the heads of society against
the hats of the same. Never was there a movement which deserved a
rofounder sympathy or a more universal adherence. The Red Repub-

demanding “a million hats,” and that demand we beg to echo.

does not shade us from the sun, it does not shelter us from the rain; it
is ugly and expensive; you cannot wear it in a railway carriage, it is
always in your way in a drawing-room; if you sit upon it you crush it,
yet it will not save your skull in a fall from your horse; it will not go
into a portmanteau, you are sure to forget it when suspended from the

THE moment it was known by what vessel JENNY LIND was about
to cross the Atlantic, we dispatched an efficient corps of reporters, and
correspondents on board, who were present in various disguises about
the º for the purpose of watching every movement of the Nightin-
gale. One of our most esteemed contributors might have been seen
flitting about in a dreadnought and sou’-wester, from spar to spar,
and yard-arm to yard-arm, dodging the delicious song-bird, as she
hopped from paddle-box to pad ebox, utterly regardless of wind and
wave, while a juvenile member of our extensive establishment was on
board, in the humble disguise of a lob-lolli-boy.
It has been erroneously supposed, that because MADEMOISELLE
JENNY LIND was seen to i. iverpool waving her white handker-
chief from the very top of the deck-house over the companion, and was
seen to enter the American harbour waving the same white handker-
chief from the top of the same deck-house, it has been, we say, erro-
neously, though naturally supposed, that, from the time of her starting
to the moment of her arrival, JENNY LIND was constantly employed in
the way in which she is represented to have commenced and terminated
her journey. We are enabled to assure the public, on the very best
authority, that such is not the case.
"The time occupied in the voyage passed very pleasantly. Every
evening there was a concert for the benefit of somebody or other,
concluding with one for the benefit of the crew, which was somewhat
marred by the boisterous state of the weather. The piano was soon
sent up to an inconveniently high pitch, the glasses insisted in joining
in, as musical glasses without much regard to harmony or effect, but
keeping up a sort of jingle during the whole time, there was an
occasional accompaniment of wind and stringed instruments by BQREAs
playing fearfully on the ropes of the rigging, and every now and then
everything was rendered a great deal too, flat by a too rapid running up
of the ascending scale and coming very abruptly down again.
The voyage having been safely got over, we now come to the pro-
ceedings in America; but we are bound to say that our contemporaries
have so fully occupied the ground—and their own columns—that room
is scarcely left even for us to say anything. -
For some days before the steamer was expected, New York was in a
state of intense excitement, so that when the ship actually came in
sight, the only mode the police had of keeping the enthusiasm of the
crowd within decent bounds, was to check their cries by knocking the
breath—as far as practicable—out of their bodies. Millions had their
heads turned, and hundreds had their heads broken, but all was of no
avail; and in spite of the exertions of the constabulary to stave off the
people with their staves, the quays were in a state of dead lock from the
throngs that covered them. As the vessel entered the harbour, the Night-
ingale was seen perched on the deck-house, supported on either side by
MESSRs. BENEDICT and BELETTI, MR. BARNUM, the enterprising show.
man who has speculated in JENNY LIND, as he has already done in Tom
THUMB, and other popular idols, was running a race along the pier with
a MR. 8. a rival showman teach holding an enormous
bouquet, and a fearful struggle took place as to which should be the
first to clamber up the paddlebox. ARNUM made a desperate spri
on one side, while Collins took a terrific leap towards the other, an
the latter being the more fortunate, or the more active of the two—or
}. he had been taking lessons in i. beforehand of some
ndian-rubber brothers—succeeded in being the first to stand at the
Nightingale's side, and to º: her with a nosegay twice the size of
that which BARNUM pushed into her hand a moment afterwards.
Either to see better, or to escape from the energetic Collins and the
frantic BARNUM, “JENNY LIND moved to the larboard wheel-house,”
and seeing the American flag, the Nightingale—with a sly sense of
humour, no doubt, and a general recollection of all she had heard about
the slave-trade, and the treatment of MR. FREDERIC Douglas, the
“coloured” newspaper editor—exclaimed, “There is the beautiful
standard of freedom, the oppressed of all nations worship it.”
As the ship neared the pier, every mast seemed to be made of eyes,
noses, and mouths; every window was a mass of heads, and the roofs
of the houses looked as if they were slated with human beings, and had
men and women, for chimney-pots. The Nightingale was so struck
with the respectability of a Yankee mob, that she asked “where the
poor were P”—intending, no doubt, if there had been any poor, to have
i* once—sung out from the top of the paddle-box—for their
eneill.
It now became time for JENNY LIND to land, and at the pier gates
was drawn up in readiness BARNUM's carriage. When one hears of a

showman’s carriage in this country one’s mind naturally travels to a
van into which the public are invited, indiscriminately, to “walk up ; ”
but such was not the vehicle in which BARNUM was prepared to receive
his Nightingale. The horses were ſigged out in a style well adapted
to advertise the museum of which BARNUM is proprietor; and, though
the trappings were well calculated to act as |; and catch the
eye of the vulgar, good taste could not help feeling that the “capari-
sons” were odious.” The Nightingale entered the carriage with the
assistance of BARNUM, who then mounted the box, ordering his
servant to make a circuit towards Irving House, it being very clear to
all what he and his coachman were driving at. The progress to Irving
House was one tremendous crush of beings, so densely packed together
that an exceedingly ripe cheese, in spontaneous motion, is the only
thing to which it would bear comparison.
The Times, having devoted a first leader of mearly three columns to a
digest of the proceedings—including the telegraphing of MRs. and
Miss BARNUM, who were coming up from Cincinnati, the rush of
... and Clergy, the crowd of “fashionable ladies,” the deadly
scramble for the stone of the “identical peach,” supposed to have been
eaten by JENNY LIND at dessert, the search for a “sensible old horse,”
who must be a rare animal among the tribe of senseless donkies in the
States—these things, we say, having been sufficiently dwelt upon else-
where, we think reiteration of the facts would be superfluous. We
are, however, expecting to receive telegraphic dispatches of a some-
what startling character, nor should we be surprised if the next
“Latest from America” should announce the dissolution of the
Republic, and the proclamation of JENNY LIND as Queen of the United
States, with BARNUM as chief Secretary for Foreign Affairs a post
for which his long acquaintance with such foreign affairs as ToM THUMB,
ºil Serpent, and other contents of his museum, renders him fully
Q €01.
Our anticipations are realised, the following is the
LATEST FROM AMERICA.—JENNY LIND.
BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
Mr. Punch’s Office, 85, Fleet Street.
WITHIN a minute of going to press, we have received the following
important intelligence from Liverpool —
“The Tarnation, CAPTAIN SMART, has just arrived from New York,
after five days’ passage, and brings the following authentic information.
“JENNY LIND does not return to Europe. On the conclusion of her
engagement (which will be considerably shortened) with BARNUM,
JENNY will be crowned Queen of the United States, the actual Pre-
sident politely retiring. JENNY accepts office under contract always to
sing, in so many airs, to the people of the smartest nation upon earth,
what has been hitherto printed as Presidents’ Speeches.
“Two stars and one stripe have been added to the American flag:
the stars are JENNY’s eyes, and the stripe a lock of JENNY’s hair.”
ADDISCOMBE GEESE.
WE received a letter last week from a Corporal—not in the Guards,
but in the Honourable Cºmpany's Establishment at Addiscombe. This
communication is signed “TRIM,”—which betokens an acquaintance
with literature that we are glad to meet with in a young soldier; and
there is only one grammatical error in it; but even that, we believe to
a mere slip of the pen, not at all deserving corporal punishment.
Our correspondent wanted to know how he was to divide one goose
equally between ten cadets, a problem which the liberality of the
onourable Company would require him to solve on Michaelmas Day.
Could we have answered our young SHANDEAN friend in time, we should
have advised him to cut the goose into small bits, and serve them out
by spoonfuls; by which means he would at least have afforded his com-
rades the satisfaction of a perfect mess. Not five East India Directors,
we will venture to say, ever sat down with but a single goose at table;
and it was shabby to expect twice that number of young men to dine o
a bird which though “too much for two’ is “not enough for three.”
We are not, however, altogether sorry to hear that there are ten cadets
at Addiscombe with only one goose among the lot.
Complete Pacification of Ireland.
THE wisdom of the Synod of Thurles—a wisdom denouncing the
godless colleges—a wisdom, no doubt, as wisely, as sincerely, and,
withal, as reverently admitted by MR. Gavis DUFFY, of the National—
bids fair to stir up the passions of the land, renewing the ferment that
hopeful folks believed about to be stilled. N. there may be
grounds of hope for the ultimate tranquillity of Ireland, in the prophecy
of GIRALDUs, CAMBRENSIs, who declares that that country shall be
tranquil a little before Doomsday—“vir paulo ante diem }}.} ” A
little, before Doomsday! After all, may not GIRALDUs CAMBRENSIs be
a little too sanguine?
LEADING ARTICLE ON THE ADMIRALTY
AND THEIR IRON STEAMERS.
WE never think of CINDERELLA without being reminded of the Lords
of the Admiralty, because an iron war-steamer is an invention so
analogous to a glass slipper. To dance in glass shoes, it is manifest,
would be about as practicable as to fight in iron vessels; and either
material would be equally likely to stand a ball. CINPERELIA’s glass
dancing-shoe, however, is a harmless fable; but the Admiralty’s iron
fighting-ships are serious fabrications. As to the slipper, the yo
lady never put her foot in it, which cannot be said of my ords in regar
to their iron steamers. - -
Surely it might have occurred to any being but an animal which
shall be nameless, that a vessel made at a foundry would be certain to
founder. We cannot conceive how anybody could think of using iron
to build vessels of war with, unless in consequence of having taken an
over-dose of a chalybeate, of which the iron got into his head. Did the
Admiralty distrust the valour of the British sailor, and think to depend
on the metal of the ship, instead? Doubting, it would seem, the
strength of our naval bulwarks, they changed them for defences which
are mere bulrushes." The harmony with which they united in the per-
petration of their Iron Follies can º be explained on the supposition
that they are harmonious blacksmiths. Indeed, their unanimity, in
such absurdity would induce one to believe that they had but one mind
—and that a disordered one—to share among their whole number.
Of course, the iron vessels cannot exist a moment before any gun
but a pop-gun. Had this not been demonstrated º experiment, the
iron determination of the Lords of the Admiralty would doubtless have
soon converted our whole navy into a material Wii. can only stand fire
in the shape of a kettle or a saucepan. In fact, we should have thought
that to construct a man-of-war of such a substance could have occurred
to nobody at all connected with nautical affairs, except the son of a sea-
cook. The same ingenuity that would have built iron line-of-battle-
ships, would probably have furnished them with tin sails, cotton
cordage, anchors of gutta percha, and wooden cannon.
The idea of putting to sea in a wash-tub is quite distanced by that of
going into action in an iron pot, as would soon have been done when
every dockyard in the country had been converted into a marine pan-
technicon. - -
We hope the Admiralty will no longer file their mind with a view to
supersede the British oak, if they can produce nothing better for that
urpose than iron filings. We trust that they will have no more such
irons in the fire as iron war-steamers, but will rather commit all their
plans and designs of such monstrosities to the devouring element. If
they intended their ferreous freak in naval architecture for their amuse-
ment merely, they have been amusing themselves most unjustifiably, at
the expense of the nation, in a strain of bitter irony, far too severe.
Fortunately, they have drowned none of our brave sailors in their war-
kettles; but they have sunk a mint of capital. We wish they could
convert their ironmongery back into gold; but such alchemy is far
beyond those, who, quacks though they may be, are no conjurors.

WOMAN AND THE CAT.
It seems then that, with our thumb in our mouth, we must stand rebuked. We must accede to
the diction of certain of our contemporaries that it is a necessary part of generalship to flog women.
Authorities have been sought out to find cat companions for Tiger HAYNAu, Even the Duke of
WELLINGTON has, in the course of his long and glorious life, bestowed six-and-thirty lashes a piece on
a dozen women: “None but the brave chastise the fair.” To be sure the women º in Spain
were trulls of the army; Moll Flaggons, who plundered and pillaged, and in many cases did not quietly
set themselves down to wait º close the eyes of the wounded before they possessed themselves
ºf the personal effects of the dying-watches, purses, epaulettes, whatever the booty might be. “And
booty,” says Suwarrow, in his Sºldier's Catechism, “booty is a holy thing!”. Thieves and suspected
murderesses were flogged by the Iron Duke in Spain: the truth of this is shown by the evidence of
a Highlander; evidence quoted in Scott's Paris Revisited; and therefore, HAYNAu is to be held free
of odium for floggin ADAME MADERSEACH, a matron of spotless honour, whose only crime was
sympathy with the imº. MEG D9NALpson “the best woman in our regiment, for whatever
she might take she did na keep it all to herself”—MEg, the liberal thief, takes rank with a noble,
high-souled woman, whose husband, maddened by the infamy wreaked upon his wife, blows out his
brains, leaving the outraged lady a desolate widow. And these are the examples set forth in defence of
HAYNAH! Why not go further. In his time, CALCRAFT the hangman has, we doubt not, flagellated
female thieves and wantons. Why not produce his example in extenuation of the acts of the Austrian?
There would be some sort of fitness in pairing the hangman and the butcher; but we protest against
any use of the Duke in aid of the Marshal: HAYNAu must not be whitened by the pipeclay of a
ELLINGTON.

CEREMONY of rRESENTING THE BATON to THE “WARRIOR” HAYNAU.
LAYING ON THE CAMBRIDGE BUTTER A LITTLE TOO THICK.
MR. Colis MACKENZIE assures us, in a "letter to the Times, that none of the subscriptions for
the proposed testimonial to the “good DUKE” of CAMBRIDGE have been drawn from the funds
of any Charitable Institution... We would not contradict, the word of any Secretary, but we will
swear that, amongst the printed subscriptions to the above object, we saw the following line:–
“Drury Lane Theatrical Fund . ... +10 10s.”
This sum is drawn, not from a flourishing fund, but from one that is rather struggling for means.
Have the CAMBRIDGE Testimonial Committee accepted the £10, and, if so, do they intend to keep it?
Do they mean to go upon the principle laid down at the bottom of the Drury Lane play-bills—
when Drury Lane had play-bills—of “No Money RETURNEp?”. If so, we propose that at the next
anniversary of the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund Dinner, at which, of course, the present Good Duke of
CAMERIDGE (“goºd” for about £25,000 a year of the people's money) will preside, the above Committee,
with MR. Colin, MACKENZIE at its head, be made to walk round the room of the Freemasons' Tavern,
in pursuance with the plan generally followed out at public dinners by schools, and other recipients of a
charity, Really, this erecting a monument on a poor-box is bringing disgrace on the very name it is
wished to honour. It is taking the bread of the living to give a stone to the dead.
Goop Nºw’s For THE KITCHEN.-We find, from the astronomical intelligence of the month, that, on a
iven day, “the moon willenter Aries.” We have received several communications from cooks and others
in the domestic interest, who are anxious to know, whether, as the moon is likely to enter Aries, there
is any chance of the sun entering underground kitchens, to which that luminary has long been a stranger.
A TESTIMONIAL TO MR.
WALKER AT LAST!
If any manly breast is the better
for a tº: of honour, there certainly
is one special case in which that part
of the human body ought to be de-
corated. The thorax within which is
a heart truly philanthropic should, of
all chests, have a Star on its exterior.
Sanitary heroes in particular—the men
of intrepid souls and indomitable
stomachs, who face typhus and nose
sulphuretted hydrogen, who brave
Death in the mouth of his own
gravepit—deserve to be adorned as
to the pectoral region...A great con-
queror in the field of filth might be
most appropriately invested with the
Order º }. Bath and Washhouse.
To which might be added—in case of
need, which generally is the case—
another order; a cheque on the Trea-
sury for a certain annual sum, not less
than £25, nor exceeding £12,000.
It is contemplated by Government
to accord some such tribute as that
referred to last, to that really enor- |
mous benefactor of his species in
gene
riety thereof in particular, the author
of “Gatherings from Graveyards,” and
of all the d there is in the Inter-
ments Bill, MR. GeoRGE ALFRED
WALKER. Vulgar incredulity need
not echo this gentleman's surname.
We have stated the fact, Government
is about decreeing a Testimonial to
WALKER.
Be it, however, understood that the
Government alluded to is not the firm
of MEssRs. Russell and Co., Tax-
masters and Providers for the Royal
Family. That concern has quite re-
linquished the higher departments of
State-business, such as the promotion
of political and social reform, and, |
with a view to it, the reward and en-
couragement of eminent merit. Their
patronage, of late, has been confined to
that comparatively unimportant district
of these dominions termed Flunkey-
dom; and they have nearly limited
their operations to the aristocratic
estate and agency line. The Govern-
ment which is going to tº MR.
WALKER a Testimonial is the Govern-
ment of His MAJESTY THE PUBLIC, to
which the Downing-Street Cabinet
leaves the consideration of all matters
of higher consequence than six-and-
eightpence—except, always, the salaries |
of Royal Dukes, and such like.
No other tax will be imposed on
account of the WALKER Testimonial
Fund than a small per-centage of con-
silence-money. In
necessary to state that the sums now
due for this object from national grati-
tude may be paid to the credit of Lord ||
DUDLEY Cottts STUART, at the Trea-
sury–MEssRs. CouTTs and Co.—or at
the branch offices, which are all other

THE POACHER OF WESTMORELAND.
Dedicated to LORD B–M AND W-x.
I FIRST began as a lawyer; in
time I was made a Peer,
And I served my country
faithfully for more than
forty year,
Till I came down to poaching;
the truth you soon shall
hear:
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy
might to fish with met and
spear!
As me and my companions
our nets a laying were,
The water bailiffs was watch-
ing us, but for them we
didn't care;
For we thought we should be
a match for them if they
dared to interfere:
And ’tis my delight of a hazy
might to fish with net and
spear!
There was me and the MARQUIs or Douro, and our lady-folks and BILL;
Likewise John WHITE the gardener, renowned for art and skill;
And Robson too, and ARMSTRONG, both old hands well known uphere:
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy night to fish with met and spear !
All in the river Eamont our nets we scarce had laid,
When down the watchers came on us with PEERITH at their head,
And arter us they boldly plunged in the stream so bright and clear:
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy night to fish with net and spear !
They tried to seize our tackle, which we wouldn’t stand, in course,
And our side pulled away ’gin theirn with all their might and force;
Whilst me and noble Douro did our companions cheer:
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy might to fish with net and spear !
There was SIR GEORGE MUSGRAVE's gamekeeper a pulling for his life,
When what does John NY PEERITH do but helps him to a knife;
By which means of our tackle he cuts off eight yards, near :
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy night to fish with net and spear !
John Robson, notwithstanding, held on to it so tight 3
That they dragged him out on t'other side, when he offered them to fight;
“Come on!” he says, “I’m ready for the best man standing here:”
And ’tis my delight of a hazy night to fish with net and spear!
The skrimmage being ended, afore the beaks we went,
For to have the case decided, which warn’t to our content,
As they gave it dead agin us; yet still we’ll persevere:
Oh, 'tis my delight of a hazy might to fish with met and spear!
Bad luck to fish-preservers, all that dwell in every shire,
The same to water-bailiffs, who won’t let us drag and wire;
Success to every poacher, by river, brook, or mere:
And 'tis my delight of a hazy night to fish with net and spear!
The Cambridge Monument.
LEERs, the Hon. Sec. to the embryo Cambridge Monument (“the
nature of which, whether a charitable institution or otherwise, will be
decided” when the money is collected, which, we take it, is giving a
8. long day)–LEERs has called another meeting of the General
mmittee, to count the halfpence up to, the present time, subscribed,
and to solicit further contributions. All we have to say is—“Gentle
Public, take care of your pockets.” LEEKs is evidently not a moving
hand at a begging advertisement. Why, then, does not the Committee
cashier LEERs and try Onions?
THE “MANIFold WRITER.”—MR. G. P. R. JAMEs.
THE GOVERNESS-GRINDERS.
WE were taught from the nursery songs of our infancy to have a
decent horror of those monsters whose practice it was to “grind the
bones” of their fellow-creatures to “make their bread,” but the process
of grinding down human beings is not unknown in these days—the
scene of the operation being often the nursery itself, and the victim the
nursery-governess. We are sorry to say the purpose of this revolting
rocess is not so justifiable even as the object attributed to the giants
in the fairy tales, who were in the habit of grinding bones, at all events,
to “make their bread,” but the governess-grinders of the present day |
the
resort to their inhuman practice for the purpose of renderin t
OS
task of “making bread” so irksome and difficult as to be
impossible.
We are determined to “put down,” wherever we can detect it, that
mingled mass of pride and meanness, that base compound of affectation
and cruelty, which is to be met with amongst people who like to boast
of “keeping” a governess, when they know they are insufficiently
maintaining an educated person to do double the work of the domestic
drudge, at scarcely the wages of the lowest menial. We beg leave to
ask any one not belonging to the governess-grinding class—and even
some of them would blush to be found out in such an affair as we are
about to disclose in the following well-authenticated case—whether the
person making the stipulations set forth below, is anything better than
an impertinent humbug, if, having got a poor wretch to enter the
domestic Pandemonium implied in an attempt to fulfil the annexed
conditions, she, “the lady”—as one of the contracting parties is, in
these cases, by courtesy, called—has the impudence to boast of “keeping
a governess”? The following proposition—the truth of which has
been respectably guaranteed to us—was made, not long ago, to a
well-educated young lady who had advertised for the situation of a
governess.
“She was to sleep in a room with three beds, containing herself,
four children and servant; to rise at a 4 to 6; give the children their
baths, dress them, and be ready for breakfast at a 4 to 8. School,
9 to 12; 4 past 2 to 4; and BEsines THIS, to give two hours’ lessons
in music. #. teach drawing, rudiments of French (speaking it as much
as possible), and general knowledge. To be proficient in plain, and
fancy work, which she was to spend her evenings in doing, not for
herself, but for her mistress. She was to have the baby on her knee
while teaching, and to put all the children to bed. Salary 10 guineas
per annum, and to pay for her own washing.”
Putting aside the downright brutality of this proposal, there is a
degree of ignorance º characteristic in the bare expectation
of being able to meet with a female CRichton, who should com-
mand all the qualities required, and execute the educational part of
her duties “with the baby on her knee.” Perhaps the “lady” wishing
her “governess” to be a model to her children of all the virtues, is
anxious to place her in positions which must bring out the attributes of
a saint, if she is fortunate enough to be possessed of them. Patience,
Humility, Endurance, Industry, and fifty other admirable qualities,
would be necessary at every hour of the day for the proper discharge
of the various tasks set down for this paragon of a ten-guinea governess.
She must have no pride, for she is to sleep as one of six in a room with
the servant; she must discharge the duties of a nurse, but she must be
satisfied with far less than a nurse's wages, and she must spend her
evenings in needlework, without even the paltry earnings of a needle-
woman being paid to her. She must give separate lessons for two
hours each day in music, and, in fact, do the music-master's work
without getting one farthing of the music-master's money.
In addition to this, a certain adroitness in the art of leper de main
will be essential; as, “while teaching she must have the baby on her
knee;” a piece of manual dexterity that must require some experience
in the science that “PROFEssoR" RISLEY and other posture-masters
are in the habit of practising.
We will simply ask what the parent deserves, who consigns four
children mentally and bodily from morning till night, beginning at the
wash-tub, Fº through the primer, the piano, the exercise-book,
the French language, and terminating at night in the bath—we ask
what does a mother deserve who consigns four children for all these
purposes to “one pair of hands” at ten guineas per annum ? Would
she not be rightly punished if the unfortunate brats were to be half-
washed, half-taught, and occasionally half-killed, by accident, or by
each other, owing to the confusion existing in the bewildered brain ºf
the less than half-paid “governess” employed to nurse, educate, and
otherwise completely “do” for them *
We admire the affectation of such persons as the would-be contract-
ing party in this case, who, when they really want a very humble descrip-
tion of maid-of-all-work, have the audacity, to insult the educated
ortion of the female community, by advertising for a “governess.”
et things be called by their right names; and henceforth, let the
words, “WANTED A Dom ESTIC DRUDGE''” be placed at the top of all
similar advertisements.”

THE GREAT WELSH EISTEDDWODD OF 1850.
ſ− = HERE has just been held
L- * at Rhyl, among the rills
and mountains of Wales,
a great Congress of Bards
to celebrate a feast called
an Eisteddvod. The origin
of this feast, though the
learned have had a tre-
mendous hunt after it in
the forests of antiquity
has not been found; an
the learned might just as
well have indulged their
antiquarian sportsmanship
by hunting a Welsh rabbit.
An irreverent inquirer
has pretended to ascertain
that the Eisteddvod was
originally a feast of Eisters
—now written Oysters;
but as Wales never was
the source of Oysters—
for who ever heard of
Whales with oyster source
—we reject the
thesis. Better authorities
tell us that PRINCE GRUF-
FUD—an Irish Welshman
or Welsh Irishman —
having a tolerably dee
voice (acircumstancewhic
has no doubt given us the
word Gruff, from GRUFFUD) invited some Hibermian minstrels to hibernise or pass the winter
in Wales, and practise their music. This led to a triennial meeting, when degrees were con-
ferred, a 'Master of Music being called a Disgyblaidd; and from these blaidds or blades, they
selected their Mus. Docs, who were called by some name, which is consonant no doubt to Wels
feelings, but consisting of nothing but consonants, is not at all consonant to ours, and we
therefore beg to take the privilege of omitting it. The Welsh Mus.Doc, was supposed to have
“muzzed” such an extent, as to know, among other matters, 40 cuclicm, 20 cydgerdd,
with a smattering of the 3 micchucl. when, if he was tolerably well “up” in all these un-
ronounceable affairs, he was himself pronounced competent. In the infancy of the art, the
W. 13ards' favourite companions were their pipes; but the advance of improvement soon
put their pipes out, and the bards adhered stringently to stringed instruments.
GIRALDUs CAMERENsis tells us, that formerly all their music was in one key; but unless it
had been a street-door key, we doubt whether it would have been sufficiently capacious for their
purposes.
#"we thought fit to parade our learning, we could tell how Twm Bäch—poor ToM BACH,
the ancestor no doubt of our old friend SEBASTIAN–was a celebrated harper in ELIZABETH's
time, and how one Powel, who lived in the reign of GEORGE THE SEconD, has gained celebrity,
or rather got a handle to his name, by the notice and friendship of HANDEL. Coming, however,
slap down upon the Bards of 1850, we find them in some old ruins at Rhyl, where they
have planted themselves among the crumbling brickwork of the dilapidated Castle of Rhuddlan.
The Welsh are sufficiently English to be unable to do anything without a dinner, and there
was a sort of picnic in the ruins. There were some patriotic speeches of such a stirring
character in the Welsh tongue, that it is a wonder the teeth of the orators were not cracked to
H. by the rush of consonants, which was so terrific, that in the utter absence of anythin
ike an a e i o or u, it was quite refreshing to meet with even a stray w; and when the excite
auditory burst out with roars of “Clytech, Clytech,” the ear felt relieved by having something
pronounceable to dwell upon.
Those who could not understand the speakers had a fortunate escape, for the Welsh rant turns
out to have been an appeal for ramming the Welsh tongue down all our throats, insisting on
“the leek, the whole leek, and nothing but the leek,” as a great political principle. It is
evident that the leek—unlike the onion—has no affinity with the sage, at least in the mouths of
the Welsh orators. -
The contest for the *: was the real business of the Eisteddvod, and ten Bards were com:
petitors for a gold medal, to be given for the best variations on “Pen Rhaw,” but most of
them deprived the Pen of all its pith and point, besides completely spoiling the Rhaw material.
Judging by the effect of the Welsh harp on ears not naturalised, or having had their sensibility
destroyed by that odious nightcap—suitcd only to the dark ages—the Welsh wig, we should
say that the Welsh harp ought to be hung up for ever in Tara's halls, if Tara will allow of such
a nuisance at the bottom of his, staircase. If the Welsh can have an Eisteddvodin Wales on the
strength of their instruments, the Jews might certainly get up with their harps in Holywell Street
a kind of Ouldclousiodd of an equally interesting character, nor do we see why the Scotch should
#l come boldly to the scratch and hold an opposition gathering by virtue of their Scotch
1010116.
We can imagine the installation of SMouchEE, the Rag-Fair Bard, executing in a minor worthy
of the Minories, a strain like the following, which is at all events more intelligible than the
song beginning, “Gutell n'ar guein yie'r Medd per hidlard,” sung at the Eisteddvodd.

The Eisteddvodd was unpleasantly brought
to a close—though every one had thought
that its coming to an end must always be a
subject of congratulation—by one of the gal-
leries †: with the surrounding
ruins, and tumbling to pieces. Happily no
one was seriously hurt, and the only wonder
is how the timbers stood so long under the
infliction of the very heavy music. Its weight
might have crushed a more substantial struc-
ture in half the time; but, though it stood
the affair as º as possible, wood and brick
—like flesh and blood—may be taxed past
endurance; and if there were any doubt as
to walls, having ears, the point was settled
at the Eisteddvodd, where the walls exhibited
sufficient ear to refuse any longer to listen to
the twangs and moanings of the Bardic com-
petitors.
After the harping was all over, there was
held a Gorsed Gwynnedd, or Assembly of
Druids, where a Norma-like proceeding was
got up in the Castle, courtyard, with twelve
mile-stones in a circle, and a couple of large
stones placed on each other in the centre–
as if the Druids were going to have a game
at duck—just as we have seen it arranged
on the stage of the Qpera. There was no
admission for anyone but the Druids them-
selves; unless anyone had been fortunate
enough to have j out in his bed-clothes,
when, in this curious specimen of sheet-
armour, he might have been mistaken for a
Druid—such as we have seen them in Norma
—and gained admission among the mile-
stones.
Old customs are very good things to *:
up when they are y respectable, but
this Bardic mummery appears to be so essen-
tially heavy, unmeaning, and “slow,” to the
eyes and ears of nearly the whole of the exist-
ing generation, that we are inclined to re-
gard the whole thing as a silly riddle, that
ought to be “given up "immediately.
THE DUCKS AND DRAKES IN
ST. JAMESS PARK.
THE public is requested by the flattering
ºl. of many signboards “to protect the
valuable collection of aquatic fowls in St.
James's Park.” We wonder no one has
listened to this appeal by scaring away the
ducks and drakes which Ministers have been
recently playing with that, property; for
though it may be most delightful playing to
them during their vacations, it can be any-
thing but agreeable sport to those who are
compelled to look on, and quietly witness
the damage which their ducks and drakes are
committing in every direction. It is time
they were driven out, or else there may be
no end to the mischief these villainous birds
will leave behind them, wherever they are
allowed to play. “Play”, is a curious term
for that which is so serious in its conse-
quences; but in this instance it is perfectly
well, applied, for the ministerial game of
Ducks and Drakes in St. James's Park during
the recess, when there is no possibility of
stopping it, is certainly the greatest instance
of “fowl play” we ever witnessed.

154 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SHERIFF CARDEN ON “THE ARMY AND NAVY.”
-- Goose is sacred to
… v. Michaelmas ; and
MR. ALDERMAN
CARDEN, bran-new
sheriff, sworn in on
the morrow of St.
Michael, delivered
himself of a speech,
quite worthy of the
legendary vigilance
and sagacity of the
= feathered monitor.
= CARDEN spoke of
peace and war; and
when he had spoken,
surely asympathetic
cackle must have
been heard on every
moor and common,
- and in every farm-
~ yardof the kingdom.
The multitudinous
ese of the fens of
incoln must have
raised themselves
- upon their legs, and
with van-like flapping of a hundred thousand wings, cackled—“Io
CARDEN.” The sage owl was dedicated to GENGHis KHAN; let the
tºnion goose be henceforth quartered and taken to the arms of
ARDEN.
MR. ALDERMAN CARDEN, at his inauguration banquet, gave “the
mealth of the º and the Navy;” thereupon declaring that “it was
the interest of all mations, he believed, to be prepared for war, for in
that consisted the best means of preserving peace.”
Thus, it is the interest of all nations to play at beggar-my-neighbour
in building ships, enlisting men, and casting cannon, that the ships may
never be launc the men never be brought into the field, the cannon
never be fired. CARDEN is for preserving peace; but then it must be
peace at the “make-ready” position. nations may be at amity, if
all nations have their artillery at full-cock.
ALDERMAN CARDEN was, in his early days, a soldier. “But the
prospect of peace soon convinced him”—said Miń. BULLock, Common-
sº and official eulogist of the callow Sheriff—“that the army
would no longer afford sufficient occupation for his energy and industry.”
Whereupon, MR. CARDEN, taking the bull by the horns, “became an
eminent member of the Stock Exchange.” MR. CARDEN “employed
himself in the monetary transactions of great nations in amity.” He
turned from gun-metal, and subsided to bullion. Nevertheless, like
a bit of old cartridge-paper, CARDEN.—the financial and peaceful CARDEN
—continues to smell woundily of gunpowder.
And yet ALDERMAN CARDEN has latent hopes of peace. Yes—
“He also was of opinion that the mighty idea developed to the world by PRINCE
ALBERT, with reference to the great Industrial Exhibition of all Nations, would afford
a better chance for the continuance of peace than all the Peace Congresses, whether
held in London or Frankfort, or in any other quarter of the world, or all the rhodo-
montade speeches that might be spouted in such assemblies.”
In 1851, SHERIFF CARDEN, as an important civic officer, will doubt-
less have to entertain the representatives of the commerce and industry
of the world, conjured into PAxton's crystal palace, by the “mighty
idea developed” by PRINCE ALBERT. Well, will the Sheriff, should he
speak to or of these men, will he dilate upon the glorious manifestation
of the world's industrial and commercial power, only as the preface to a
martial charge? Will he, in the fulness of his heart, discourse of the
family of man, and the common interests and common blood of human
nature; only to advise every member of the family on his return home,
to build ships of war, and maintain standing armies? Peace may grow
her palms in the glass-house of Hyde Park; but, nations of the earth
for all that-implies CARDEN-keep a sharp eye upon your grape and
cannister. We would rather advise that nation should “take stock”
of nation—but CARDEN says no; let every nation be armed to the teeth,
and then, and only then, it may enjoy the º sweets of peace.
Thus, were we to ask a modern councillor of the CARDEN class, “by
what means shall we best hope to love our neighbour as ourself?” we
might expect this pithy answer—“Buy a blunderbuss.” A man once
ignorantly sowed gunpowder for onion seed, and waited in confidence
for a crop. CARDEN, in his intelligence, would sow bullets, that he
might sit under the shade of olives.
great year is before SHERIFF CARDEN; therefore, we submissively
hope that he will forget he was once a soldier. That he may do so,
we incline to offer him a brief story. .
Once upon a time, a butcher, with a basket on his arm, was carried
at full ºil. into a regiment of dragoons at a review. The old horse
had once been in the service, and ambling along, º; legs and
shoulders of mutton, heard the well-known trumpet, and forgetful of
his later calling, º: to the ranks. He was laughed at, and
spurred, and beaten back. ... Therefore, let no stockbroker CARDEN, in
the days of his youth a soldier, trust himself to drink. “The army and
navy.” There is, we allow it, a ºf music in the syllables;
and the civilian, in the fervour of port, is too apt to feel his neck
§§ with a cravat of thunder, and to paw the mahogany, and to cry
“hee-haw.”
THE PURSUIT OF JOURNALISM UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
A KINDLY sympathy prompts us to offer a hint calculated to meet the
difficulty under which |...}. journalists now labour, in being obliged
either to write tamely, or to expose themselves to prosecution through
the law, which compels them to affix, their names, to their leading
articles. Here is a fragment of a model spirited leader relative to an
imaginary ministry; an article which, as far as the authorship is con-
cerned, would, we are bold to say, defy indictment:-
“The consequences of LoRD MoUNTBUSHEL's accession to the
Premiership (BRowN) are manifesting themselves with a vengeance
(Jones). The funds—the nation's pulse—are (Robinson) falling fear-
fully (ToMKINs). Discontent is (Johnson) ripe at Manchester; fifty
|mills have already closed, and the streets are thronged with (SNOOKS)
frantic crowds, exclaiming (STYLEs) Bread or (Nokes) Blood! (HoPKINS).
A hundred thousand men have already assembled at Birmingham, pre-
pared, if need be, (BRiggs) to march on London (Hobbs). Now is the
time, or never (STURBs). Awake! arise! or be for ever fallen!
(MILTON). Raise the song of the patriot in every street (DOBBS).
Britons never shall be slaves!” (WALKER).
Thus might Liberty—Goddess of the French Press–dance a mighty
pretty hornpipe in fetters.

PUNCH, OR THT LONDON
CHARIVARI. 155
BOARDER IIFE IN ENGLAND.
QUR feelings have been much shocked, and our Glauber Salts accord-
ingly exhausted, at the perusal of an advertisement commencing as
follows:–
Bºº (Private and Superior).--Terms, for single gentlemen, Foreign or
English, of good position, from 25s. to 30s. per week. A Married Party, 45s.
When we had got thus far, we could proceed no further, so shocked
were we at the idea of a married party.” being advertised for as
inmates of a British Boarding-house. A “party” must, of course,
include more than two, or a “married couple” would have been the
term used; but a “married party” evidently points to the Eastern
practice of a plurality, of wives, and, the advertisement is clearly
addressed to some travelling Pacha, or other matrimonial pluralist, whom
the facility of communication with all parts of the world may have
brought to England.
We trust this humiliating proposal does not reflect a true picture of
the Boarder Life of England, which, though presenting some remark-
able phases, is, we hope, free from that polygamical tinge which the
advertisement we have quoted would seem to attach to it. The
announcement adds, “The present party small and select; from which
we may infer that there is §. in the house a case of the kind, and
that the “married party” is not very large, though we must protest
against any number beyond two, as opposed to all our views of
Pºiº
As a further specimen of the Boarder Life of England, we may cite
other advertisements in the same paper, some of which are quite
Herodian in their emphatic intimation that “children are objected to;”
while in several there is a rich vein of pride, indicated by hints that the
advertisers are actuated by a wish for society rather than for cash, and
one “lady, occupying her own cottage, with nearly half an acre of
garden,” “is not accustomed to boarders,” but has no objection, for
the magnificent consideration of a pound a week, to put up with “an
inmate.” We do not envy the Boarder, whose position, of course,
must be that of a kind .# thing that the “lady occupying her own
cottage” has “not been accustomed to.”
There is occasionally a rich specimen of the Boarder tribe themselves
in the advertisements, and we met with one the other day who wants
to board for £60 a year, in Russell Square or one of the Parks, and has
no objection to “visit ſtaly, German , and France,” if the family hap-
ned to be travelling. He º; might meet with a few residents
in the Park, who take Continental tours—the noble owners of Stafford
House and other mansions—but we very much doubt whether it would
be worth the while of any of the noble owners, for the sake of £60
a year, to receive the “gentleman” as “an inmate,” and take him on
the tours he expresses himself quite ready for.
We will conclude by expressing our astonishment at the exceedingly
“select” character of the Boarder Life of England, for almost every
one of the advertisers “mixes with the best society.” We may,
perhaps, infer from this, that, as a late member of the aristocracy used
to take pills by the hundred, and rub in ointment by the pound, to give
“a grace and a glory” to a certain Professor's advertisements, so there
may be lords and ladies who “go out” to attend Boarding House
dinners, and enable the establishments to boast of the “best society.”
Case of Conscience for Teetotallers.
THE Yorkshireman tells a story about a sow fattened by a farmer at
Thirsk, on rum and milk, in the proportions of three half-pints, of the
former to a quantity—not stated—of the latter daily. Upon this diet
the sow became an habitual drunkard—drunk to an extent exceeding
the normal drunkenness of a sow—as drunk as a sot. She increased in
weight at the rate of 5 stone 2 pounds in a few days, and, when killed
weighed 42 stone 10 pounds, without the head, into which probably a
good deal of the rum had got besides. Now, as the animal's }. must
ave been saturated with alcohol, it becomes a question whether .
person pledged to total abstinence could conscientiously partake of suc
rum pork—except, of course, medicinally.
The GLORIOUS TENTH.
.ON the 10th instant the tradesmen of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE
dined together to celebrate the payment, of the first quarter's salary,
namely £3000, paid that day to his Royal Highness. The festival was
held at the George and Bore.
Sagacity of American Cats.
A New York paper says–
“While the cholera raged at Harper's Ferry all the cats left the place. They went
in droves by night.”
The fact is, all these animals were of a Pennsylvanian stock; and
they adopted the cholera as a subterfuge merely, to repudiate their bills
for cat's-meat.

you ask such a question?

hating you by nature, and
that our wish is to tyran-
nise over you and keep you under If your young men come to
college with our young men, don't you see, you idiot, that in the
course of a few score years, your lads, being born to the full as clever
as ours and six times as numerous, may win the prizes and scholarships,
get the government-places, and snug-berths, fit themselves for the
learned professions, and so forth, and turm us out of what at present we
hold? § course we vote for John of TUAM and PAUL CULLEN, not for
poor D. MURRAY,
DR. MURRAY is a well-meaning man, but he's a class º:
PADDY, and that’s what we hate—especially when he doesn’t legislate
for our class—whereas John of TUAM and PAUL or ARMAGH, those are
the right sort of fellows: they want you to remain ignorant; be cursed if
you ..i. go and learn grammar and lan , or mathematics and
astronomy, with Protestants and heathens. Believe, with PAUL CULLEN,
that the sun is six feet in circumference, accommodate your mathematics
to his Grace's (God bless his most Reverend Lordship), and see how
you'll get on as an Engineer, my boy. .
Why are you, forsooth, to learn history and mathematics, law, or
chemistry, from the best professors are can get? These things are not
to be taught to you by people selected for their capability, but by
people of your own religious way of thinking: gentlemen properly
trained at Maynooth, where.they will learn three-fourths theology and
one-fourth science doctored orthodoxically: if we want a good surgeon
or a good lawyer, we won't ask what his religious opinions are; we
want the best of advice from the best people, who learn their business
in *:::best way, teach it in the best way, are paid the best price, and
so 10ttin.
Whereas you, you poor ragged Pappy. Don't look at the stars
through that viſiºn, iono Rosse's glass, ask Father Tim to lend
you a peep through his dirty old telescope: if you’ve broken your leg,
| don't ask the Surgeon G to set it, the pestilent Protestant; get
a smart young chap from Maynooth who has learned a little surgery
along with his humanities; see that you have an orthodox dancing
master for your daughters, and, if they learn to sing, send for DoN
Basilio. Of course we are for John TüAM.
In that way we savage Saxons shall have no need to be afraid of you.
Which has the best chance to learn a thing, think you, he who has the
best master, or he who has a twentieth rate instructor? Give us the
good men. You take the others, PADDY. Give us the railway train to
travel by—you wait to hear whether the Holy Father approves of the
priest beside you.
O, PADDY, PADDY, you poor old humbugged PADDY!

since the tale of the glass slipper, no glass seems so likely to become immortal in story.

model Bishop (not from Thurles). Indeed, there will be an entire model Ireland, on a small

“Mr. Paxtox being recognised just as his carriage was going to start from the hotel door, he was cheered

occupied a seat with his father in the front of the carriage."

“A SEA OF HEADS.”
| WAs it the Black Sea—the White Sea—or,
the Red Sea? No matter, the sea was the heads
|of 6,000 persons—so no doubt a sea of all the
three colours—that made the ocean of brains
that JENNY LIND first sang to in New York.
On that occasion BARNUM offered a handsome
sum to the governors of the Madhouses of the
| City for the most incurable lunatic, to attend to
report the proceedings. The poor fellow was
relieved of his strait-waistcoat; and, being fur-
ther stimulated with cobbler and gin-sling, pre-
pared for the task. Be it understood, that to
make the madness perfect—if perfect madness
be allowed—the maniac dipped his iron pen in
his flesh, and wrote as follows in his own red
1. :—
“A vast sea of heads swayed to and fro, sparkling
beneath the starry lights in the firmament of song, here and
there thickly sprinkled with the foam of beauty, anxiously
expecting the Aphnopite of music to rise amid the waves,
while the Tritons, with their horns and sonorous shells, in
awkward groups hung around the scene, immediately to be
graced by her advent."
The heads, sparkling beneath starry lights of
song, were sprinkled with the foam of beauty!
Amidst this foam of their heads, JENNY LIND
was to rise, like MINERVA, from the brain of the
Thunderer! As for the Tritons, we give them
up, horns and shells, and all!
However, idiots are respected in the East;
and, just now, madness has its exceeding great
reward in New York; for the hopeless maniac
who penned the above, has been crowned with
a diadem of straw in the Broadway. Should
JENNY LIND refuse the Presidentship, it is be-
lieved that in the present temper of the Union,
the dignity will be offered to the lunatic afore-

THE HAT REFORM.
EveRY one agrees that there ought to be a
reform in Hats, but, after putting on our con-
juring cap, as well as our considering cap, without
deriving any assistance from either coiffure, we
are still at a loss for the means by which the
great result is to be accomplished. Can society
go back to its original hatlessness, and begin as
it were, da capo, fly abandoning the day cap, as
it has already, in many cases, flung away the
might cap? In the East, we know the Fez was
forced on to the polls of the people by an arbi-
trary power, which would not have scrup
take the head into its own hands, if the head-dress
had been objected to by the owners; but in this
country such a course could not be adopted even
though martial law should be proclaimed, and
a GENERAL HATs-off placed at the head of the
nation. -
A proclamation could never accomplish a hatty
reform; but we are not º to say some-
thing might not be done by shrieval interference
º, would be consistent with those º
Institutions that all Englishmen cherish. Yes,
yes; º towards a reform in hats might
perhaps be safely attempted by a hatti-scheriff!

unbearable to have our attention disturbed by the shrieks of innocent
helplessness echoed by angry, recommendations to “take that child
out,” or by more considerate, though equally noisy suggestions to the
mother, to exercise one of the sweetest offices of maternity.
People are obliged to leave their bonnets at the door when they enter
the boxes, and why should not the same system be adopted with refe-
rence to babies. There should be a sort of nursery attached to each
entrance, where babies could be ticketed and left, either to be hung up

ANOTHER CANDIDATE FOR A STATUE.
If a statue is erected to the “Good Duke” of CAMBRIDGE, the

charitable individual, than erect a statue to him. This gentleman, it is
true, has, not the high advantage of being born a Royal Duke; but
putting this advantage aside, his claims for a statue are, in every respect,
as strong as those of the “ Good Duke.” He presides at public dinners
as often as he is invited—his name is never denied to a public charity,
and, what is more, he not only gives his name but his subscription also.
The sums he has bestowed during along life of voluntary subscriptions on
publiccharities must amount to many thousands. The nameofths gentle-

Glazing for the Queen's Colleges.
Those of the Irish Roman Catholic Bishops who oppose the Queen's

would have allinstruction coloured with their theological views. These
over-zealous Prelates would allow nobody a study unless it had storied
windows. Their lordships don't consider that though “adim religious
light” may be the illumination most suitable for worship, plain sunshine
is the fittest forwork.
A COMING EVENT.
THE blackamoor, under the scrubbing of the Post and Standard, is
fast becoming an albino. MR. GEORGE Hudson is about to return to
the politest and the highest life.
“The actions of the just
Smell sweet, and blossom in the dust.”
Especially if it be gold dust. There is in that auriferous soil, a trans-
muting power that, after a time, turns hempseed into laurels. Let the
world º to read something like the subjoined announcement in the
Morning Post:-
“MAGNIFICENT PARTY AT ALBERT GATE-Last night, GeoRGE
Hudson, Esq., M.P., on his return from Coventry, entertained a vast
assemblage of bon ton. Covers (all gold) were laid for 100. A ball
followed in the evening, which the magnificent and hospitable host
opened, dancing the first quadrille with the hereditary Duchess of
monobuster. Nothing could exceed the splendour of the entertain-
ment, except the suavity, and high breeding of the founder of the
east; who, on his return from Coventry, was welcomed with a fervour
and, indeed we may say, affection, commensurate with his expected
dinners, if not with his deserts. -
“The exterior of the mansion has been newly stuccoed with a pure
and brilliant white, in which colour the just and thoughtful may recog-
mise a touching fitness. The stags' horns and hooves have been gilt
inch thick; and StopB and MoRTIMER have orders to furnish the
animals forthwith, with emerald eyes.
“It has been stated that Mr. Hudson had purchased of the Govern-
ment the marble arch to replace the small stone erection, at Albert
Gate. It is true that overtures have been made, and the subject
entertained; but the statement of absolute purchase is a little
premature.”
RIFE-RAFE ON RAILWAYS.
THE º graph which ought to have been printed
on the most delicate pink note-paper with scented ink, has recently
appeared in the London journals:
Baranton Railway.-We understand there is a great outcry at Brighton against
the Brighton railway for the “raff” it is pouring into Brighton by its “travelling for
the million.” Res ble inhabitants are fast leaving their houses in consequence, and
it becomes a question whether, if it go on, it will not presently much affect the season
tickets, and the first and second class riders. Should it do so, the Brighton policy will
be to bring in pence for the present to lose pounds hereafter.
The sensitiveness of the Brightonians is of a very peculiar kind; for
while it winked at, or rather gloried in, the doings at the Pavilion
which caused the importation into the town of less than doubtful
respectability and decency, the inhabitants are beginning to turnu
their noses at the poor, harmless railway excursionists, who are enable
to enjoy a sea-breeze on Sundays for three-and-sixpence. . The
Brightonians, perhaps, think that the sea was made exclusively for
them, and regarding it as a portion of their capital, they will, perhaps,
deny the “raff” the privile e of even dipping into it.
e “respectable” inhabitants are, it seems, “fast leaving their
houses,” because,once a week BRows, Jones, or Robinsºn, may be
met walking on the beach with their wives and families. We should
like to see a ſº published under the superintendence of the
Brightonians, for the guidance of cheap excursionists, telling them
where to go inconsequence of the sea coast being prohibited. Bath and
Cheltenham must, of course, be excluded from the Atlas for the use of
the “Raff,” and indeed we see nothing, but the Isle of Dogs, as a
watering º in which they would be tolerated; for when Brighton
begins to be squeamish about “respectability,” Margate and Ramsgate
may fairly lay claim to exclusiveness.
No Benefit of the Act.
EveRY now and then we hear of laws being continued just as they
were about to expire...We know there is a very wholesome objection
to the taking away of life under any circumstances, but there really are
some acts of Parliament which we think might be allowed to die a
natural death without a prolongation of their misery. The renewal of
their term of existence is often but a Zamiel-like sort of proceeding at
best, and the acts thus allowed to continue their course are frequentl
found to #. at last to where they might just as well have been suffere
to go at first for any good that has been got out of them.
THE SPOONS OF WAI-
A writºr in an Altona paper calls upon the women to subscribe
towards the war between Holstein and Denmark. He asks for the
precious metals in any shape. “Give up,” he says, “one table or tea:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMPROVE YOUR WAYS IN CHANCERY.
WE read that the Chancery suit of ATToRNEY-GENERAL v. TRE-
veLYAs, has already lasted 166 years. A great outcry has been
raised about improving Chancery Lane. It is aii very well, but
it strikes us as beginning at the wrong end. Is there not another
Lane, as long, more tortuous in its windings, much narrower in
all its ways, and which causes much greater obstruction, than
Chancery Lane In fact it is a long Lane that has no turning, ex-
cepting to the workhouse. The reader will already have guessed
that we allude to the Court of Chancery. Does that require no
improvement? We should like to see a little º raised
to pull down a few of the obstructions that cause the cruel delays
which take º every year in it.
Imagine being detained waiting 166 years! What are a few
minutes lost in an omnibus, or a quarter-of-an-hour wasted inside
a comfortable carriage, compared to a monster delay like that!
Chancery Lane is doubtlessly a great nuisance; but it is swallowed
tº: a cork in the Maelstrom, in the whirlpool of the Court of
Chancery. Improve your Lane by all means, but do not forget the
poor people who are wandering up and down that marrrow Court,
and have no means of getting out of it. In short, since public
attention has been directed to the matter, our cry is, “Improve
all your Lanes in Chancery.”
FLOWERS OF FASHIONABLE SPEECH.
# Le Follet, as quoted by the Morning Post, informs the fashionable
world, touching the fashions for October, that
“The morning dresses of white or pale blue cachemire, are lined with taffetas,
which turns over and forms revers, showing the quilting in wreaths of roses, pinks
and foliage. Small slippers of quilted taffetas, the same shade as the dress,
trimmed with a plaiting of ribbon or narrow lace, are worn with this toilette,
and form a complete chef-d'oeuvre of coquetry and good taste.”
The context, carefully studied, will show that, “revers” is a
bit of untranslated French, and not of fashionable, orthography,
meant for “rivers,”, as might be surmised by the masculine
reader, labouring under indistinct ideas about etas, and con-

AMERICAN ELECTRICITY.

. It would rather astonish the world if the Presidency of the British
Association for the Adyancement of Science should be filled, at the
| next Meeting of that Congress of Philosophy, by Mr. Punch. All,
however, that, Mr. Punch can say is, that there is a corresponding
| Society, of which he considers, himself to be the fittest person living
for the Chairman. The learned body here alluded to is the American
counterpart to our own, which blends amusement with instruction,
observant of the HoRATIAN adage respecting seasonable tomfoolery.
The American Association for the Advancement of Science trims the
Professor's cap with bells, and its President occasionally sits with his
tongue in his cheek, listening to a lecturer whose thumb is at the tip of
his nose. This is a statement requiring, corroboration; which shall
follow, on authority no less trustworthy than that of Qur grave con-
temporary, the Athenaeum, given under the regular head of “Scientific
Gossip.”
“The American Association for the Advancement of Science has been holding its
third Annual Meeting, at Newhaven, under the Presidency of Prof. A. D. BACHE.
* * * A communication was made by PRor. Loomis, of novel, and to us curious,
phenomena of electrical houses. His statement was as follows:– Within a few years
past, several houses in the city of New York have exhibited electrical phenomena in a
very remarkable degree. For months in succession they have emitted sparks of con-
siderable intensity, accompanied by a loud snap. A stranger, on entering one of these
electrical houses, in attempting to shake hands with the inmates, receives a shock,
which is quite noticeable and somewhat unpleasant.'"
The unscientific reader, who, may not see the fun of all this, is to
know that to be chargeable with electricity a house would require to be
built on glass or resin. That the shock would be received immediately on
touching the knocker, and that as its force would be equivalent to that
of a small flash of lightning, the recipient would be electrified once for
all. The next joke is more passable.
“Ladies, in attempting to kiss each other, are saluted by a spark.”
Very likely, if ladies will do such things in the presence of gentlemen.
But to proceed with this tissue of shocking stories:
“A spark is perceived whenever the hand is brought near to the knob of a door, the
gilded frame of a mirror, the gas-pipes, or any metallic body, especially when this body
communicates freely with the earth.”
When FRANKLIN got a spark from the string of his kite, he inter-
of a fried snowball.
cepted its communication with the earth by a non-conducting medium,
and precisely owing to such communication have lightning conductors
hitherto conveyed electricity harmlessly away.
Jerking of course his thumb over his left shoulder, the Professor
continued, addressing his no doubt winking audience:–
“In the house which I have had the opportunity to examine, a child in taking hold
of the knob of a door, received so severe a shock that it ran off in great fright. The
lady of the house, in approaching the speaking tube to give orders to the servants,
received a very unpleasant shock in the mouth, and was much annoyed by the electri-
city, until she learned first to touch the tube with her finger. In passing from one
parlour to the other, if she chance to step upon the brass plate which serves as a slide
to the folding-doors, she receives an unpleasant shock in the foot.”
Let the reader who has any doubt about the possibility of the last-
mentioned fact, get an electrical machine, and endeavour to electrify
any given brass plate let into any given floor—except a glass or
resinous one. The result of his experiment will be precisely equivalent
to that of whistling jigs to a milestone, or of remonstrating with
Government on the inequality of the Income-tax.
The funniness of PROFEssóR Loomis's facts is nearly equalled by the
drollery of his theory to account for them :—
“After a careful examination of several cases of this kind, I have come to the con-
clusion that the electricity is created by the friction of the shoes of the inmates on the
carpets of the house.”
Punch need hardly observe that so extraordinary a consequence of
walking must be all WALKER. In order to the generation of a quantity
of electricity sufficient to produce the alleged effects, by the means
specified—“sitch a gittin' up stairs” as mortal “never did see” would
be indispensable. PROFEssoR Loomis and his scientific associates
might test the practicability of the thing by an hour's exercise on a
gigantic ºft carpeted with wool or velvet—which, he states, are
the materials of the carpets of his electrical houses. And if he can
electrify any house but an insulated one, Mr. Punch will eat him, boots
and all, or, what will perhaps be more pleasant to the Professor, his
boots without himself, and will invite-PROFEssoR LOOMIs to Greenwich
to dine at the same time off electrical eels.
PoAcHER's Fund.—The Derby Mercury states that the Mansfield
poachers, “have actually established a protective fund.” Punch is autho-
rised to declare that LoRD B–H–M has not been elected the treasurer.

CHANCERY AND CHANCERY LAN.E.
HANCERYLANE has, plainly enough, got into
the Court of Chancery: it is so narrowed
in its circumstances—so rotten in its con-
dition—so dangerous to all who deal with
it—so unprofitable to all and everything
that pass through it. Chancery Lane must
be widened, is the deafening cry of its
tenants and its daily passengers. The
Court of Chancery must be widened too
—widened, yes, thrown open to the light—
exclaims the Chancery Reform Association,
gathered together for the cause of the
cheated, the bemocked, and the oppressed.
“The suitors and the public” (cries the
Association)
“(For all are concerned) are earnestly invited to
send in their names and subscriptions to enable the
Council to gather strength effectually to reform the
monstrous abuses of the ‘British Inquisition,’ called
Chancery, by which hundreds of thousands will be saved to the suitors in their costs,
and years of misery to them and their families be prevented.”
At this moment (our authority is a paragraph in the Morning
Chronicle) the Chancery suit of the ATToRNEY-GENERAL r. TREveLYAN
is now one hundred and sixty-four years old. Why, it is plain that
that mysterious individual, the oldest inhabitant, is invariably a suitor
in Chancery.
One hundred and sixty-four years old ! In which time how much
misery, how many anxieties, how many wearying, hopeless hours, how
many heart-aches, to the Trevºss? Cân #! with her ever
true arithmetic, count them No: she won't try, and for very shame.
Again—hear the Council of the Chancery Reform Association:—
“The Council also desire to effect the liberation of a large number of their fellow-
creatures, many of whom have been in various prisons for periods of from 20 to 40
years.
The homes of merry England'
law.cursed land! How dreadful, when the Bastille was tumbled to
the earth, how dreadful the revealed pictures of wrong and captivity
Old men, blinded by the sudden light—white-bearded captives,
shrinking and tottering from the air of heaven. The prisoners of the
Chancery Bastille —the captives “for periods varying, from 20 to 40
years”—are to the full as ghastly; every whit as terrible presences, a
crying wrong to heaven, against the º and tyranny of fellow-man.
Truly it is well that Chancery Lane should be widened—but it is better
that we should so widen Chancery Court, that if a coach-and-six are to
be driven through it, at least the vehicle shall have Justice, alias
Equity, as the inside passenger.
As to the marrow condition of Chancery Lane, many, and touching,
and significant, are the daily occurrences in that small vein of the Me-
tropolis; a vein that certain folks would have changed into an artery—
we presume that it might then lead to the heart of JUSTICE; a heart
that at present has no connexion with it.
“A tenant of mine,” writes one J. L., “told me
“That a short time back, a waggon met a funeral in this narrow strait, and a most
unseemly obstruction of some duration occurred.”
Was the deceased, obstructed on the road to the grave, a late suitor
in Chancery If so, the hindrance was in the finest harmony. Be it
so or not, it is surely enough that Chancery has relentless hold of the
living; it should sheathe its talons at the dead. Or must Chancery,
unlike the lion, prey on carcases?
Chancery-Lane is like a bottle, the neck end towards Holborn.
There is room enough to admit a coach or cab, but none to turn. A
rat-trap might be constructed on this principle, and called the “Chan-
cery Rat-trap; or, Every Housekeeper his own ELDON.”
MR. John RoRERT TAYLOR, of 54, Chancery-Lane, supplies the
most significant, the most ominous incident, bearing upon | danger-
ous character of his whereabout:-
“During the racing which generally ensues after the omnibuses have been fairly
unlocked at the Holborn end of Chancery-lane, about 2 o'clock this afternoon, one of
the horses in an omnibus actually cast his shoe through one of my plate-glass office
windows, which might have killed more than one person who happened to be standing
near the window at the time. This shoe may be seen by any person calling here,
who will scarcely credit such an extraordinary instance of the strength of the horse.”
An omnibus horse loses his shoe on his way through Chancery Lane.
What is this, but another proof that nothing can approach the Court of
Chancery without a sacrifice of metal? From bran-new gold to old
iron, Chancery will have its penn'orth. Has MR. TAYLOR yet sent the
shoe to the Chancellor He ought; for we understand that one of
the immortal Six Clerks has a tame ostrich that, from its Chancery
habits, can digest even bars of iron—always excepting prison bars:
they remain entire : dedicated to the Chancery captives of “from 20 to
The gaols, the Chancery gaols of this I
40 years.”
MR. TAYLOR has written urgent letters to the Babes of the Woods
and Forests. The innocents! They can do nothing. They put their
thumbs in their mouths; and with a wondering stare shake their heads.
They “have no funds at their command for purposes of metropolitan
improvement; ” mo, only of sylvan and rustic depredation. However,
let MR. TAYLOR persevere; and next session the Woods and Forests
may obtain a parliamentary grant, by way of loan, for widening
Chancery Lane only: when ihey have obtained the money, let them be
vigilantly watched, lest they devote the funds to the enclosing of
Primrose Hill, as a mushroom ground for the kitchens of HER MAJESTY
and PRINCE ALBERT. In the meantime, should the cast horse-shoe
still remain in the possession of MR. TAYLOR, let him convoke a
meeting of Chancery Lane inhabitants who, in solem procession, shall
carry i. shoe to the official abode of Lord SEYMOUR ; and there and
then, for good luck, mail the aforesaid horse-shoe over the door of the
Office of Woods and Forests. Our venerable ancestors had great faith
in a horse-shoe so affixed; it scared away evil spirits. And that these
are apt to haunt the councils of Woods and Forests is borne in testimony
against them by ST. JAMEs, despoiled and wailing in his Park. .
THE CONSCIENCE MONEY MANIA.
THE public conscience continues to be visited by these intermittent
or remittent qualms, which manifest themselves in the shape of Bank
note halves, and are felt in that most tender of all places the pocket,
The CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER furnishes by his occasional
advertisements a sort of conscience-ometer, from which we may ascer-
tain the force and value of the scruples affecting the minds of the tax-
paying, or rather the tax-eluding portion of the community. '
This attempt on the part of individuals to restore themselves to moral
health by Vºi resorting to a little pecuniary bleeding when the
conscience is overcharged—and the pocket has been undercharged in
the way of taxes—may be regarded as a very satisfactory omen. It is,
however, to be regretted that this sensitiveness of the conscience
should be limited to those who have, in some way or other, defrauded
the public.resources, and does not affect those who have victimised
private individuals. We should like to see returns of conscience money
in the shape of overcharges made by tradesmen to their customers.
magine a visitation of conscience, among the way speculators or
lº, and conceive—if possible—the business that would have to
e done on the settling day, when the account between persons and
their consciences came to be settled.
We hope this partial visitation of conscience may only be a precursor
to a general attack, which will end in the grocer sending back con-
science money for the sand sold as sugar, or the birch paid for as tea;
in the milkman returning the difference between the value of chalk-
mixture and genuine . in the doctor disgorging the price of the
useless medicine which the patient unhappily never can again disgorge;
and, in fact, in a general restoration of | cash improperly received by
all classes of society. But perhaps, considering the generality, if not
the lºº of the victimising process practised by one upon
another, the shortest plan would be "to grant a general amnesty to
every body's conscience for the past, and let every one undertake to
keep his conscience in a wholesome state for the future.
Register! Register Register!
JUDGING from the number of registered paletóts, stockings, boots,
hats, stoves, baby-jumpers, in fact, registered, everything, from a
shirt to a steam-engine,—we think we can parody the warning which
Sir Robint Pºri stole from Eiaºcoon’s Magazine, and exclaim,
“The Battle of Puffery must be fought in the Registration-Courts!”
“THE DECLINE of ENGLAND.”—We only know one instance, and
that is, England's declining to buy MonsLEUR LEDRU ſtollin's book.

A Little Book has been published under the title of “How to Lay
Out a Small Garden.” We beg to recommend to the notice of the
Woods and Forests a similar little book, which we are thinking of pub-
lishing, called “How to Lay Out £12,000 in Spoiling a Public Garden.”

EMOVAL-The Statue of Victonia, which we pulverised in Punch about
a twelvemonth ago, has been removed from Victoria Square, Pimlico, and has
gone, no one can tell where. It is supposed that the large Globe on which the ugly
effigy of HER MA. Esty stood, has been sold to a neighbouring skittle-ground, where
it is said to be doing a world of mischief among the nine-pins. The Statue itself is
greatly missed by the swallows and all the little birds of Pimlico, who used to make
it their resting-place during the fashionable season, whenever there was a review in
Hyde Park. The inhabitants of Victoria Square illuminate their parlours every
evening in honour of the removal of the unsightly lump of granite. It is rumoured
that the vacancy will not be filled up, which will be a saving, not only to the inhabi-
tants, who could not look out of window formerly without having a continual eyesore,
but to the public in general.

THE NEXT BALLOON ASCENT.
PUBLIC Amusements may be said to have been lately “looking
the numerous balloons which have been in the ascendant durin
the season now at its close. Announcements, almost as j
as the balloons themselves, have promised all sorts of achieve-
ments, by all sorts of aeronauts, who, goaded on by the greedy
appetite of the unthinking, public for dangerous displays, have
been outbidding each other for popularity, by a fearful competition
in the race of folly and audacity. Horseback, ponyback, and
donkeyback, have all been resorted to, in turn, for the gratification
of the sightseers, who found the ordinary perils of ballooning

One fatal result is a providentially small per-centage on the
vast amount of folly—to #. it the mildest name—that has been
ractised during the last few months for the satisfaction of that
epraved and demoralising taste which finds amusement in
witnessing the risk of human life, and which is most fully indulged
when the chances of safety to a fellow creature are reduced to the
utmost minimum. Surely it is time for authority to put a stop
to these brutalising scenes, since it is not many years that one
poor wretch committed suicide by hanging himself in a public
thoroughfare, for the diversion of a grinning crowd; it is still
more recently that “Professor.” Somebody broke a child's neck
in the presence of an ignorantly applauding audience; and it is
but the other day that another º. victim to the public
“taste” was dashed to pieces, out of sight of his patrons, who
were thus baulked of witnessing the great point of attraction, on
the chance of which they had paid their money.
If this sort of thing is to go on next season, some new excite-
ment must be found, for an aeronaut on horseback or donkey-
up” in one sense, for the eyes of Europe have been turned towards
stale and flat without a little extra excitement; and, considering the ||
torture inflicted on the quadrupeds, as well as the folly practised

too small a probability of accident for an enlightened public to part with
their shillings and sixpences. The only thing to be done to keep the excite-
ment alive—whether the aeronaut will be kept alive is another question—
will be to make an arrangement for a balloon ascent, by some of the GREENs

CONVENT OF THE BELGRAVIANS.
VERYBODY who has a proper
veneration for the reredos, and
who, without, holding extreme
- opinions on the subject of the
- dalmatic, feels, correctly on
that of the alb, who has a
soul that can appreciate me-
diaeval art, particularly the
beautiful foreshortening of our
ancestors, and who would re-
vive their ecclesiastical prac-
tices and institutions to an
extent just tastefully Ro-
manesque, will be “ryghte
gladde” to hear that it is pro-
posed to found a Convent, on
Anglican Fº under the
above title. The vulgar, who
think that a minority is ne-
cessarily a sect, will, of course,
call it a Puseyite Nunnery:
that cannot be helped.
| . The Convent will be under
the superintendence of a Lady
ºlº Abbess, who will be a real
* Countess, at the least. One
Al \\\\\" principal object of the institu;
\\ ºf ºt. º - - tion is to recall the good old
T' - - - times when thegentle BLANCHE
or the high-born BRUNHILDA,
, taking the vows and the veil
connected, the hallowed ce
with the heraldic griffin, the
coronet with the cloister.
The Nuns will all make an
engagement of celibacy; but,
to preclude them from con-
tracting any rash obligation,
only for so long as they may remain in the Convent, which they shall be at liberty to quit whenever
they please, at a month's notice—or the equivalent alternative. Each Nun will be required to con-
tribute to the necessities of the Convent at least £10 a week, that sum being the minimum at which
it will be possible to defray the expenses of the establishment, and keep it select. She will be, also,
expected to bring two silver forks, and all the usual requisites of the toilet.
The vow of poverty, pro tem., is also to be taken by the Nuns, as it safely may, because, from the
nature of the establishment, their whole incomes will be expended for conventual purposes. The sisters
will all have separate cells, fitted up comfortably, combining the boudoir and the oratory. Each sister will
be attended by a male and female domestic. # was at first intended that the former should be clad in
the attire of an antique serving-man, but this apparel being likely to incur puerile derision, it has been
deemed expedient, on the whole, that he should wear the Lady Abbess's livery.
The Nuns will have a common sitting-room, carpeted with an imitation of encaustic pavement, the
roof-timbers to be of dark oak, the walls frescoed, and the chairs and §. beautifully an otesquely
carved. Their refectory will have a dais, at which will sit the Lady Abbess and the sisters of title, that
the seemly distinctions of social rank may be observed.

A MEETING WITHOUT AN
ADJOURNMENT.
THE Commissioners of Sewers had
a meeting on October 11th, and trans-
acted business for two hours without
an adjournment! . Such an accident
was never known before, and the ex-
citement it produced in the purlieus
of this quiet little Court may be es-
timated from the fact, that when the
meeting was over there were not less
than three persons present. This is
extraordinary for a Court that can
rarely enlist the attention of an
audience of more than one—and that
one, very frequently, the usher!
We are glad to have it in our power
to publish a º, little fact in
connexion with the Court of Sewers.
The great difficulty the Commissioners
experience in transacting their busi-
ness, is to sit quietly on their chairs,
sometimes for three hours at a time,
and have nothing to do. An old woman,
taking their forlorn condition into con-
sideration, has started, a circulating
library, just º their windows.
The object of this is evidently to
relieve the heavy tedium the Commis-
sioners who are º: have to endure,
in waiting for the Commissioners who
are absent, and we must * it is very
kind of the old woman. The books
are lent at a very moderate rate, and
when we mention that the price is only
a penny a-day per volume, our readers
at once see what a boon this kind
arrangement of the old woman is likely
to be to poor, suffering Commissioners.
The State of the Serpentime.
QUIDNuNgs used to inquire What’s
in the Wind? but the question that
really waits for solution in these days
is, º: 's in the Water? The Ser-
ntine is a subject that now invites
inquiry, but we are not at all disposed
to go deeply into it. Its bed is in
such a dirty state, that a clean sheet
of water is thrown away upon it, and
when the public apply to the Com-
missioners of Woods and Forests, the
only answer returned is a wet blanket.
|It has been proposed to draw off public
The usual diet of the Nuns will be optional—that is to say, of course moderate—in point of quantity. indignation from the Serpentine by
All fast days, however, will be strictly *. by religiously eating red mullet and raspberry jam tart. If
no red mullet is to be had, John Dory, salmon, or any other fish in season may be substituted.
The costume of the sisterhood will consist of a judicious admixture of the conventual style with the
fashion of the day. The Nun will not be obliged to sacrifice her hair, but only to wear it plain, a la
Madonna, and it will be permitted to be partially visible.
Absolute seclusion will by no means be enforced'; indeed it will be incumbent on the Nuns to appear
in society, in order to display the beauty of sanctity. There will be no objection, therefore, but rather
the reverse, to their going to flower-shows and concerts, or even to HER MAJESTY's Theatre, whenever
they please. At the same time, they will thoroughly renounce the world, in the Belgravian sense.
The time of the Nuns will be devoted to practising the charities of life by making morning calls,
and occasiºnally visiting soup-kitchens and model j ing-houses in a properly appointed carriage, or,
if they walk, attended by a footman. Otherwise, their ; will be employed in illuminating books of
devotion, practising ecclesiastical tones, and working slippers for the younger clergy.
A certain number of Bishops shall be elected Visitors to the Convent, and shall be invited to come in
that capacity to all soirées, of which not less than three shall be given at the institution every week—the
company to be admitted by vouchers, on the principle of ALMAck's; so that none but the most eligible
parties shall be introduced.
No austerities calculated to injure the health or personal appearance will be permitted at this Convent.
The sister who rises early to attend matins in cold º: must submit to have her bed carefully
warmed for her, by the time, she comes back. The inordinate indulgence in maceration, encourage
by Rome, will be disallowed; and the only means sanctioned for the restraint of the flesh, will be the
gentle and moderate compression of stays.
That the Anglican Convent, thus constituted, will lead to “perversions” there is no fear. Alas!
the hard multitude will rather say that the Puseyite sisters are only º: Roman Catholics, and
than a
the vile punster will remark that their Convent is more a Monkey-ry
drawing off the water, altogether, but
there is something at the bottom of all
this, which renders it unsafe to try the
experiment.
Temperance Wine.
THERE is a wine advertised, called
“Exhibition Wine.” This is an un-
happy title, we think, for what man in
his senses would drink much of a wine
that, with every sip he took, held u
before, his eyes the reproving, word,
“Exhibition?” He would naturally
count his glasses, lest, from drinking
too much, he should ultimately make
an Exhibition of himself.

“Railroads, Siaº I Hate Railroads, and I shall be very glad

NOTES OF A TOWN TRAVELLER.
I AM a town traveller, for no particular house, and in no particular
line, except the line of threepenny omnibusses, to which I always try
to adhere, on account of the cheap fares, because in paying sixpence
do not go so far and fare worse, while, in paying threepence, I
further and fare better... My trade, if any, is the fancy-trade, for
products of the imagination are what I chiefly dealin, and, if I am
interested, in prices of any kind, it is in the price at which I can
º the publishers to negotiate my paper. I contemplate doing a little
usiness, if I can, as a town traveller, and the sample I now offer will
show the sort of article I am ready to supply at the usual prices. In
the course of my town travelling. I shall endeavour to select those
objects that are either curious and new, or curious and old, or that are,
for any other quality, legitimate subjects of curiosity,
The other day Iscrambled on to the roof of an Atlas buss, and here,
I may observe by the way, that these vehicles are appropriately
designated; for an Atlas carries all the world on its roof, as its name-
sake of antiquity carried all the world on his shoulders; and I may
remark, however, that SHAREspeaRE was wrong in saying, “fixed as
eat, Atlas self,” for I have seldom seen an Atlas a fixture-or even
oitering like some busses in a Liverpool thoroughfare. The Con-
ductors, unlike Conductors in general, know how to conduct them-
selves, and are conversant, with many of the polite arts, which are
usually unknown among the thoroughly numbered but wholly un-
lettered class of men who so frequently may be said to open the door
to abuse, and slam it to, with a terrific bang, against all remonstrance.
The course of the vehicle lay over Westminster Bridge—which has
been tumbling into bed—the bed of the river—for the last fifty years;
and its dilapidated state can cause no surprise, when we remember
that this bridge has always had a Committee of some sort to situpon
it...There is a story told of the triumphs of surgery, which cut of
both the arms and both the legs of an individual, who lived notwith-
standing the quadruple operation;-a case not unlike that of West-
minster Bridge, which is still a bridge after a series of abridgements
that have cut away its arches, its sides, its balustrades, and every
thing but the bare road which still out a miserable existence,
but is the mere shadow of what it former y used to be. On the other
side of Westminster Bridge old Association asks for the Marsh Gate,
when the driver—a member of the new Association—replies, that the
Marsh Gate—a few years ago infull swing—has been completely un-
hinged by modern improvement, and has been superseded by the South
Western Railway, which crosses the road, º keeps a quantity of
hissing, smoking, screaming engines always “on view,” running back-
wards and forwards, or standing upon the arch to “fright” the horses
passing beneath “from their propriety.” -
To the left extends the New Cut, which certainly has the cut of
novelty about it to the unfamiliar eye, for the whole business of the
place seems to be carried on upon the foot pavement. There is along
series of counters along the entire line of the kerbstone, and across the
footway the eye of the traveller is often literally struck by a piece of
heavy merchandise dangling on a pole from the first or second floor
windows. Here a mountain of linendrapery presents a sort of miniature
Alp, snow-capped, as it were, with a lot of snowy white night-caps—all
at 34–and the pass has scarcely been effected before the traveller finds
himself buried under an ayalanche of cheap clothing, that has glided
down from the º heights—the supposed fastness being in fact a
looseness from which he escapes, only to thread the mazes of huge
banks and barriers bristling with cheap ironmongery, or green with
cabbage leaves and other low-priced verdure. The occupation of their
omes appears to be the last thing that the inhabitants care about, for
their habitations form the mere back-ground of the scene, the business
of life being confined to the thoroughfare itself, where many a bargain
is interrupted by the tradesman, the customer, and the goods, being
knocked down in, one lot by the º: vehicle. Though the shop-
keepers do not wish their goods to be depreciated, they expose them to
be run down tedly, and a coal waggon may often be seen wendi
its way, over “Boots for the Million,” “Five thousand. Parasols,'
“Gents’ Pants,” “The Fashion,” “A Dinner Service of 40 pieces,” now
smashed into a hundred and fifty, with a variety of other articles that
“must all be cleared off,” and which are now made to fulfil the decrees
&º: destiny, by forming the materials of one great “ -
The residents of the New Cut have evidently taken their houses for
the purpose of turning them out of window, a*. which is literally
carried out—by the carrying out of their #. s—every morning, on to
the pavement, and the decoration of the front of their premises with
everything, belonging to the interior. The broker, makes, up his
half-dozen beds in the middle of the street, as if to invite the way-
worn traveller to turn in; while under every lamp-post there is a
restaurant, totempt the appetite with the bearded oyster, the smooth-
faced º the meat pie-containing a º: of something
* in º and wrapped also in mystery—the steaming potato
the ballin which popular superstition traces the presence of brandy, and
the toſſy which has put into nearly eve s mouth the name of
Everton. The foreigner who had been told that the English people
never live out of doors, would be astonished at finding, by a visit to the
New Cut, how completely al fresco are all the proceedings of the in-
habitants. The Frenchman who had heard of the dullness of a London
Sunday, would find everything proceeding in the New Cut as if there
were no day of rest or recreation, and nothing to remind one of the
existence of a Sunday, except a church in the centre of the scene,
placed there, probably, by way of contrast. The discriminating eye
may detect, here and there, a member of the congregation of this c
struggling through to its doors, as well as he can, amidst the piles of
Incrºllan the din of traffic, the noisy solicitations of the tradesmen,
and the vociferous º of the customers. š. one who objects
to the sober quietude and calm recreation of an English Sunday, need
only repair to the New Cut, where such a thing as a holiday or
holyday seems to be utterly unknown to the inhabitants. eir
week-day amusements partake of the same, open-airy character, for
about half-way down on the right hand side is a species of penny
theatre, or, as the French would more appropriately call it, a Salle, for
its saleº is conspicuous. In obedience to the genius loci, which makes
externals everything, the outside of the theatre is plastered all over with
the representation of a º deal more than can possibly be seen within,
and disappointed will he, who, having paid his penny at the door,
expects to see one half of the tableaua realised.
ven should his taste be gratified by the exhibition of the two coarse-
looking creatures in bed-gowns, labelled, “All this Talent To-Night,” or
should he be edified by “The Sunning Miss LARRUp" having her
(Highland) fling in her Scotch costume, he cannot expect to see all the
placards, inclu º “Here’s a Lark,” “The Infant Female Stunner.”
‘Young Cole, the Juvenile Screecher,” and other miscellaneous
promises faithfully performed in one night for one penny.
It would be easy to moralise on the effect of this company of
stunners” and “screechers” on the idle boys and girls who form the
chief patrons of these places of entertainment, and some of whom are
tempted to become “stunners” and “screechers” in their turn, if
nothing worse befals them. If the ammals of crime were to be analysed,
how much of it might be traced to habitual attendance at a penny
theatre, is a question that may be asked, but cannot be answered-
except at a guess-by

THE GOLDEN BROUGHAM.
We congratulate all those who are interested in Folklore, on a dis-
covery which will prove that, not without reason do they hold the faith
that there really are “more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in your philosophy.” The Alla California has the following singular
statement:—
“Lond Bhough AM IN CALIroanta-Omr friend and late co-labourer, Roneer
WILson, of Stockton, yesterday exhibited to us a specimen of gold, bearing the most

and the resemblance is most perfeet.”
Here is a fact which will take down that nose which Incredulity has
been turning up so long at the Rosicrucian doctrines. Statuettes are
not made without hands; and it is satisfactory to find the sylphs and

CHANCERY LANE WORTHY OF ITS NAME.
Sever AL correspondents have been beating the gongs of the press,
and making a great noise, about widening the Holborn end of Chancery
Lane. . We admit the very great improvement that would be caused by
one or two houses being removed; but still we should be sorry to witness
the alteration of a single stone in such a venerable street, which is con-
nected with some of our most venerable institutions, as Chancery lane!
The street, as it stands at present, is a brick-and-mortar illustration of
the ways of Chancery. It is broad at one end, and extremely narrow
at the other; very easy to get into, but how difficult to get out of!
It is the perfect history of a Chancery suit. It should be allowed to
stand just as it is, with all its difficulties and nuisances untouched, if it
were only to serve as an emblematic corner-stone of the institution of
which it bears the name;—to tell stupid people in the most practicable
manner what they must expect to encounter, if they trust themselves
in Chancery.
AN ERROR OF THE PRESS.
IT seems we have made a mistake, and we humbly beg pardon for it.
Two weeks ago we said that the “ frury Lane Theatrical Fund” had
subscribed £10 10s. to the proposed monument to the “Good DUKE”
of CAMBRIDGE. M.R. Colin MACKENZIE has written to assure us,
that it is not the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund, but the Committee of
that Fund, who has subscribed the sum in question. Upon the faith of
MR. MACKENZIE's assurance, we rectify our mistake, and withdraw the
comments we made upon it. Will, the Committee of the Drury
Lane Theatrical Fund meet us in the same spirit, and rectify the
mistake they have made; for is it not a †. we ask, to bestow
money upon a monument, when living objects are in want of it?
Now, it is notoriously a fact, that the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund is a
struggling fund. The Theatre is closed. It has not had a complete season
for several years, which prevents the fund gaining any new subscribers,
whilst the claimants upon the charity remain just the same; and the
chances are, that they increase every year. us, with a diminishin
income, and increasing claims upon #. the Drury fame. Theatrical Fun
is in want of every little fraction of support which those interested in
its continuance can give it.
The Committee must know this, and we do hope that, upon second
thoughts, they will, withdraw their subscription from a monument,
which does not require it, and give it to human beings who really are in
want of it. Let them forego the little pleasure of seeing their names
engraved upon the pedestal of a statue erected to a royal personage
and devote their money to a good act of charity, such as the “Goo
Duke himself, if he were alive, could not fail to approve of...If that
was all, the Committee might send it in the Duke's name, . His sub-
scription, of course, has ceased, but how pleasant it would be to hear
MR HARLEY read out, at the next meeting, amongst the list of donations,
an item like the following:—
“The Statue of the Good Duke of Cambridge . £10 10s."
LIGHTS AND SHADES of SCOTTISH JOURNALISM.
THE Edinburgh Advertiser, the other day, in allusion to the QUEEN’s
expected arrival in Edinburgh, said that—
“The arrangements for HER MAJESTY's reception at Holyrood, on Thursday even-
ing, are making satisfactory progress.”
One would suppose that the arrangements, the º of which was
satisfactory to our Northern contemporary, consisted in the laying down
of carpets, airing of rooms and beds, and such like provisions for the
sovereign's comfort. But the Caledonian journalist proceeds –
“In addition to the other preparations, we believe it has been proposed to light a
large bonfire on the summit of Arthur's Seat, which will illumine the surrounding
country, and have altogether a very striking effect.”
The circumstance of a fire being lighted in the royal apartment, which
would warm the surrounding atmosphere, and have altogether a very
pleasant effect, must of course be gratifying to the loyal subject to
reflect upon. But what satisfaction can be derived from a bonfire on
Arthur's, Seat, eonsidered in any conceivable relation to, adult and
|reasonable Majesty? The Edinburgh Advertiser is very easily pleased.
In the next statement it is difficult to say which is the more wonderful,
the delight expressed, or the fact recorded:–
“We are happy to hear that the subscription set on foot to defray the expense has
met with great success.”
This in, Edinburgh—the º of Scotland A subscription in-
|tended to be burnt up in a bonfire has met with great success amon
|Scotchmen, and a Scotch newspaper rejoices at the waste of j
|Perhaps the subscribers fried their watches in their bonfire.
Furthermore, says the Advertiser of Auld Reekie:—
“It is also proposed, we believe, to illuminate St. Anthony's Chapel, and other parts
of Salisbury Craig, with the 'Drummond Light;' and other pyrotechnic displays are
spoken of for the occasion."
Really this is the Scottish prodigal burning his candle at both ends,
So much for the joy of the Edinburgh Advertiser—now for the
Sorrow :-
“we regret, however, to understand that the authorities have been obliged to give
up part of their design with the variegated lamps."
Regret—authorities—their design with the variegated lamps." What
is all this about? Scotland or China-baillies or mandarins—the Edin-
burgh Advertiser or the Pekin Ko-tao? -
The grief and gladness expressed in the foregoing extracts, may
possibly be accounted for by the supposition of a tender solicitude on
the part of the writer for the diversion of the younger branches of the
Royal Family. , According to Phrenology—is it not so, MR. CoMBE –
this would imply excessive philoprogenitiveness and, prodigious vene-
ration, with a development of the organs of the intellect—about which
the less said the better,

A REGULAR CRAMMER.
A RECENT advertisement in the
Times commenced as follows:–
“A LADY of the highest qualifications is de-
sirous of a bed-room and dinner.”
We presume the “highest qualifica-
tions” must be construed as applying
to the “dinner,” and we may infer
therefore that the “lady” is blest with
an awful appetite. Taking this into
consideration, we suspect that the
advertiser meet with very few
who would not prefer her room—that
is to say, the bed-room she is in want
of—to her company. One might as
well admit a young wolf into one’s
amily as a y “desirous, of a
dinner,” and possessing the “highest
ualifications” with regard to it.
When poor little CUFFEY, the Chartist
captive, was asked how he liked the
prison fare, he candidly declared his
ability to “dispose of more;”, but the
avowal of the advertising lady is still
more to the point, and if we let lodg-
ings, we should differ from Othello in
thinking it a hardship to be able to
“call such delicate creatures ours, but
not their appetites.”

AN attempt is being made to get up

in favour of the Welsh language; and

TWO EXHIBITIONS IN ONE AND IN 1851.
WE find from the papers that the
authorities, fearing there will not be
sufficient life and busie" in Hyde
Park at the Exhibition of 1851, have
made arrangements for permittin
the cattle shows of the Agricultur
Society of England to be held in the
same place, at , the same period.
That the crowds, visiting, the ob.
}. of industry on one side of the
ark, may not be tempted to get
away on the other, the north-western
angle is to be devoted to the col-
lection of mountainous beeves, mon-
ster mutton, and pork in the last
- stage of pinguidity. The public will
in fact, be placed in a sort of cul-de-sac by this arrangement, an
the Park, necessarily invaded on one side for the industry of all nations
will be unnecessarily invaded on the other side for the fat of all En land
to stand simmering in the summer sun, and effect, a blockade of the
public pleasure-ground on the side of Bayswater. The introduction of a
cattle show into the already curtailed space of Hyde Park, is what may
be justly termed “going the entire animal.” It may, perhaps, be
thought a piece of fanciful hospitality towards the foreigners who will
visit the Exhibition of 1851, to introduce them at once to the fat of the
land, though it will be, after all, but a Barmecide feast, for they will
only be enabled to carry away as much of it as “they can put in their
eye, and see none the worse for.” The site selected for the exhibition
of monsters, to be seen, as the showmen say, “Alive! Alive!” is appro-
riately enough called the “Battery,” for assault and battery will, no
#. frequently mark the scene, where crowd will necessarily meet
crowd, and the tug, if not of war, of coat tails, pocket-handkerchiefs
and purses, will be of daily and hourly occurrence. As to the poor old
Parks, they seem to be marked out, not only for the devastating pick-
axe and ruthless spade, but—severest dig of all—for the hoof of the
fat-bound, suet-struck cattle. Can we wonder that the lungs of London
should be inflamed at being thus trampled upon? Alas, we must soon
expect to see our Parks deprived of every turf for the innocent lark, or
º fººl, and the green sward without a single blade to fight its
OWIl Dattles.
The Summit of his Ambition.
LQUIs NAPOLEON is busy practising in climbing a Māţ de Cocagne.
The hoop on the summit is festooned with legs, and shoulders of ham
and large joints of cold veal, and embellished with a beautiful garland
of bottles of Champagne. The whole is surmounted with a glitterin
F. of the Imperial Diadem. Louis NAPOLEoN practises seve
hours a day in climbing this greasy pole, which is stationed for his
especial study in one of the inner Courts of the Elysée, but he begins to
find “how hard it is to climb,” and that he makes but little way with
all his violent attempts at progress. He still clings, to the slippery
hope, however, of being able, by the time the next Election for Fij
comes on, to get to the top of the Pole !
Strange, but True.
WE have been told—for really our ignorance of DEBRETT's Peerage
almost amounts to an insult to the House of Lords—that the English
title of the DUKE of ATHoLL is “LoRD STRANGE.” This is, to sa
the least, very strange; but, at all events, no one can call the º
minded, Duke—considering the habit he has of blocking up public
thoroughfares, and closing everything—“LORD Passing STRANGE.”
does not at all suit the English palate.

atents have been taken out. in
We do not know whether any
the savans are busy constructing
England for balloons, but in France - -
and improving that fugitive department of science. It strikes us that
there must some higher motive for this industry than merely
navigating the air, and we at once jump, to the conclusion that this
º activity amongst our flighty neighbours must be owing to a
desire to send over a prize balloon to the Great Exhibition of 1851.
Depend upon it, this is the intention of MEssRs. ARAgo and Bix10,
...? the only questionis, whether arrangements have been made to do
| ample justice to their idea. Have any demands been made for sufficient
space to accommodate bulky articles of the size of a balloon? and
: again, what corner of the Exhibition has been put aside for their
reception?
We have our misgivings about the policy of admitting them at
all, for supposing a balloon was to break loose from its bearings, only
consider the havoc it would produce amongst the glass and crockery
before it could be caught again! It would be infinitely worse than a
bull in a china shop. Then there is a great doubt whether the runaway
balloon would be caught at all. Is it not more probable that, after
taking a large sweep º the interior, it might take a fancy to see what
the exterior was like, and, rising with, the thought, poke its head
through the glass roof, and admiring the airy º of the Park,
drag its heavy body through the big hole it had made, and disappear
of the notion, but consider a few of the inconveniences, such an
awkward admission is likely to bring down upon their, as well as other
people's, heads... We have seen the plan of one of M. Bixio's new
inventions, and it is a large bunch of balloons tied together, like a stick
of cherries. We are sure that with one or two little articles like that,
the Exhibition will have room for nothing else, and if all the balloons
should happen to combine and rise together, the building can never
stand against the outbreak, and must infallibly be carried up to the
World.” We would recommend, if a balloon knocks at the Exhi-
bition for admission, that the door-keeper be instructed to say, as a
fashionable hotel-keeper says in the busy season, when he does not like
the appearance of his customer, “Very sorry, Sir -
we cannot take you in, you had better try somewhere else!” ---
- At all events, if balloons are indispensably necessary for the advance-
ment of science, let there be a separate building, of cast-iron, for their
reception, and let it have a practicable roof, so that the young charges
may be taken out occasion º for an airing, and have a little exercise
in their “native element.” It will be a curious sight to see a covey of
balloons all springing into the air at the same time. But if all the
balloons now hatc in Paris and London, only take wing next year,
we should recommend the householders of our smoky metropolis to
look to their roofs. The mortality amongst the chimney-pots will be
something ul!
from sight ether, Such a freak is not in the least improbable,

alloons, will not allow themselves to be carried away with the largeness||

ASSURANCE AGAINST RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.
We believe it is generally known—for the comfortable intelligence is
placarded at nearly everyterminus and station—that a passenger losinglife
or limb on a Railway can, if he goes on his journey with the agreeable sen-
sation thatlife andlimb are injeopardy, effect an assurance before starting
that will give him pecuniary damages for any personal damage that
may be done to him. There is, ". a Railway. Accident Assurance
Company, which Fº from time to time, a list of its bonuses on
broken bones, and tries to tempt the public, by showing how “a gentle-
man shaken was awarded six pounds”—no great shakes, by the by-in
the way of compensation; and how another gentleman, who received
his mother-in-law unexpectedly and forcibly on the point of his nose,
was adjudged one pound for the disagreeable proximity. Now, there
is scarcely a married man who would consent to receive a mother-in-law
so completely chez lui on these moderate terms; and one pound seems
a very poor equivalent for rendering still closer a somewhat disagreeably
close relationship. A wife's mother is not always the most desirable
person to be brought literally face to face, with by a railway collision,
for there are in most families enough of domestic collisions to render
this sort of contact quite superfluous.
We rather º * scale of *º º º

see how the price of the life will enable us to get at the value of a leg,
an arm, or any other portion of the body. -
We cannot m the matter by a rule of three sum; for if we
state the question thus—If a life costs £2,000, what will a leg come
to? we find ourselves, in the old red-herring and sack of coals fix,
which leads us to nothing º Besides, legs vary in value
according to circumstances; and the loss of a leg to a “fast” man,
would perhaps deprive him of something more valuable to him than
even his head; while the loss of a nose to a person always poking into
his neighbour's affairs would deserve much less compensation than the
loss of a proboscis confined to its legitimate º There is one
thing, however, that it would be utterly impossible to estimate by any
rule, mathematical, philosophical, or otherwise—we allude to a woman's
tongue, which, if it should happen to be lost in a railway accident,
might bea calamity utterly irreparable to the owner, but a real blessing
to all her friends and neighbours.
“BIRNAM WOOD REMOVES TO DUNSINANE.”
We have seen an article in the Morning Post, headed “Visit of the
Admiralty to the Britannia Bridge.” This, we presume, is only a
prelude to a regular exchange of cards and calls *. the public
edifices of this country, and that their movements will be chronicled
with the same exactitude that the actions of Royal personages are
noted down. We expect soon to see announced in the columns of our
contemporary, that “the Mansion House transacted business with the
§."º, yesterday,” or that “Stafford House gave a grand
entertainment in honour of the first appearance of Bridgewater House,”
and that Buckingham Palace had “condescended to be a partaker of
the festivities, St. Clement Danes, Guy’s Hospital, Temple Bar, Mil-
bank Penitentiary, Westminster Abbey, Horse Guards, Reform Club,
Waterloo Bridge, the Thames Tunnel, Devonshire iouse and the
ank being present to meet the illustrious guest; the Royal Exchange,
St. Paul's, and other noble edifices, having been unable to accept the
noble host’s invitations to celebrate the occasion.”
Who knows how far, these erratic propensities may be carried.
Foreign structures, perhaps, will be on the move. The Invalides
for health’s sake, will be paying a visit to the Cathedral at Milan, and
the Campanile at Venice; and the Tuileries will be taking advantage
of MR. CRise and cheap excursion trains to run over to London for a
week; King Leopold's Palace of Lacken, or, as it should be called,
kin', will come to this country, to have a spree with the Duke of
York’s Column; and the monument in the Place Vendôme will stay
with Apsley House, to have a good view of the Exhibition of 1851:
Nay, a paragraph may appear to the following effect:- The Taj of
gra has arrived at Southampton, on a visit to Windsor Castle,
Holyrood, and the principal seats of the Empire. The Tajis accom:
panied by the Mosque of Omar and other distinguished foreigners, and
is attended, by the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the capacity of
interpreter.” - -
Let us hope that humbler buildings will have the same privilege;
and that it may be a common thing, too usual to be publicly noticed,
that the gaols of England will give place for schools, and its work-
houses make intimate acquaintance with bakers' shops.
“PRAY, AFTER You,” as the Glass of Water said to the Pill.

IF Education were beef, and Paddy were invited to partake of a bellyful

The Thurles prelates are warming Paddy off from the Government pro-
visions in this way, and inviting him to pay for, and feed upon, some
potatoes which are not only not grown yet, but for which FATHER Mac has
neither bought the seed nor got the land. -
| Having cursed the Irish Catholic º and middle classes out of the
Colleges, their Right Reverences should curse the poor children out, of the
National Schools and send them back to the old seminaries under the hedges.
The best place for the new Irish University would be the centre of
Connemara, where nobody lives, and, by consequence, no Protestants are
to be . - - -
The Irish University is called Catholic, because Catholic means universal,
º the universal university is to be founded on strictly exclusive prin-
ciples." -
In fact, if it were Oxford and Cambridge itself, it could not be more
intolerant; and if the Bishops of Thurles were so many orthodox British
º could not act more logically, nor would they, very likely, speak
differently.
The outcry about the Godless §: is only an imitation of the cry
raised against the London University College (when founded by the late MR.
BRough AM and others), which was accused of º atheistical surgery,
heretical º: latitudinarian Latin and Greek, and was gracefully deno-
minated Stinkomalee. - -
The Catholic Bishops have as good aright to make their students conform,
as we have to make our young men swear to the Thirty-nine Articles. If a
Unitarian refuses to recite the Athanasian creed, or a Quaker to wear a
surplice, nobody forces them. They must go andlearn sewhere than at
Cambridge and Oxford...If a Catholic cannot take a degree at either of
those schools, why should he not have a University for himself? ..
That wicked Times newspaper proposes that the Irish Catholics should
have “Halls” adjacent to the *. existing Colleges, and march to lecture
under command of a spiritual, sergeant, as soldiers march to church, But
what, on the other hand, would they say at Eton at the idea of a Roman
Catholic boarding-house?...Would not her hundreds of little Protestants be
hurried º should like to know if the Dean of Christchurch or the
Master of Trinity would receive a squad of Roman Catholic gentlemen, or
a body of Unitarians or Baptists into their tutors' lecture-rooms?—and
would welcome FATHER New MAN or MR. PALEY walking in at the head
of their young men?
. That sauce, which by cooks is considered suitable to the gander,
is likewise deemed applicable to the female bird;—don't letus
cry out against Popish bigotry, when we have among ourselves
such a comfortable stablished intolerance.
Talk about toleration! How can honest people be tolerant?
How can Doctor PHILPotts be tolerant of GoRHAM? or FATHER
IGNATIUs of Doctor PHILPotts?. Each holds opinions which,
according to his view, must send the other to the deuce: each
teacher must bring up his young men in his own manner. Why,
there are hundreds of honest English clergymen now, who will not
accept a penny from the Government for their schools, because
Government desires to educate Catholics, Protestants, Dissenters,
alike. These reverend gentlemen are not a whit more or less
honest or intolerant than the pontiffs at Thurles; and are we,
forsooth, to cry out against the º: only?
It is a maxim (we have their own word for it) that all education

herefore, as they are always comminating each other (from the
º motives of course), and GoRHAM differs dreadfully from
HILPorts: and PHILPotts differs fatally from FATHER BARE-
Legs: and the REveREND OBADIAH differs from all three: and
as each has the clear right of educating his people, it is clear that
there should be a university for each sect.
So what a nice country ours will be to live in, if the people
will but be obedient, and let the º have their way! How
we will hate each other; How we will avoid each other How,
each side putting implicit trust in its black-coated general, we

Reverences are trying their best.
How to Rise in France.
THE way to rise in France is to take your stand, early in life,
on an inkstand. The shortest cut to the Chamber is through
an editor's room. To become a leader, you must have been in the
habit of tossing off one every day, in some newspaper or other,
The best plan of gaining a portfolio is to * you are possessed

WE all know that the Ornamental Water in St. James's Park is
not useful for much, but if the Woods and Forests are allowed to

THE Mansfield Poachers have been subjected to so many fines,
that they have instituted a Protection Society amongst themselves.
We recommend that, stanch Protectionist and Poacher, who has

Loud Cries of “Name."
THE French Government seems to be sadly bothered, since the
signing of articles has been made a sine quánon with the writers

ALARMING BALLOON ACCIDENT.
(From our own Paris Correspondent.)
IT will be recollected by our readers, that a fortnight ago M.
PolTEviN made a balloon ascent in Paris on a live ostrich: We should
not repeat this stupid incident, only it was connected with an alarming
accident, which proves more than anything else the danger and folly of
ballooning. -
Five minutes after the ascent, a MADAME EPINARD, the wife
of one of the principal bankers of Paris, was seen coming out of the
Prince de Népaule, one of the first establishments for bonnets and
cachemires. She had on her head and shoulders, at that very moment,
a handsome new bonnet, and a magnificent new cachemire, which she
had been purchasing for 50,000 francs, the fruits of a happy speculation
made by her husband on the Bourse, and presented by him to his dear
She had not proceeded ve steps towards the milk-white columns of
the Madeleine, when she felt a heavy blow on the back of her head,
which completely took away her senses, and sent her bonnet flying
under the wheels of a passing citadine.
The blow was so strong, that
the lady had º sufficient time to run into a pastrycook's, and sit
down in a chair, before she fainted. In that helpless state she *::::::
full ten minutes. When she was sufficiently recovered to look at herself
in the glass, she was so disfigured that she could not have been .
mised by her bitterest enemy. , Her new shawl was completely spoiled;
her dress was ruined beyond the friendly redemption of either cleaner
or dyer; her parasol was a melancholy ruin, whilst it was found neces.
sary to sacrifice her gloves, for which at least thirty-two sous must have
been given, as it was utterly impossible to bathe her hands as long as
she had them on. Surgical assistance was sent for, and the suffering
lady removed at last, after several hours of hysterical fits, ronounced
rfectly genuine by all who witnessed them, to her splendid hotel in
e Chaussée d'Antin. -
Public surmise is at a loss to conjecture the origin of this terrible
accident. It was supposed, at first, that some malicious hand had been
at work—but, no such thing! It was the result of the most capricious
chance. The police immediately proceeded to the spot, and soon
collected evidence which i

Fº the following day—when the intrepid aeronaut and his daring
ird had to pass a most uncomfortable night in prison, some fifteen
lieus from Paris. The criminals were locked up in separate cells, so
that º not be able to communicate together. -
They have since been examined, and the origin of the accident has
been fully explained. At the time that the jady received the blow on
the back of her head, M. Poitevin was passing over that very portion
of the Boulevards. He looked down, and noticed a large white sub-
stance, not unlike an immense ball, filling to the earth. It fell on a
lady's bonnet, but he could notice nothing further, for the balloon shot
into the air immediately afterwards with such wonderful rapidity, that
it required all his attention to attend to it. - -
This story *. with the version of the police. They examined
the ground, and picked up innumerable, little pieces of broken shell,
with which the pavement, was strewed. These were produced in
Court, and they left no doubt upon the judge's mind that the accident
en caused by AN OSTRIGH’s Egg! It was a mercy that this
modern instance of ostracism had not resulted in death ! -
M. PoiteviN was condemned in a new bonnet, cachemire, and
#." of an equal value to those so pitiably destroyed, and in 10,000
rancs for damages done to the lady's nerves. His ostrich was likewise
bound over to keep the peace for two years. This will put a stop for
the present to any more Campagnes d’Autruche.

PUNCH*S RALLWAY TRAVELLER.
WE have received the following from our Railway Traveller, for
whom we were about to issue an advertisement offering several
thousand pounds—the amount we happened to have loose in our till—
for his discovery.
“MR. Pusch, -
“Sir, –You will have been surprised at not hearing from me,
but the fact is, I have been occupied ever since I last wrote in trying
to discover the difference between the second and third-class carriages
—the great discrepancy in the fares raising the presumption that the
former are some º to a hundred per cent superior to the latter.
“The uninitiat #. imagine that the superiority belongs to the
glass for which the highest price is paid, but I am bound, to say that
facts lead one to a contrary conclusion. I find, Sir, that in each class
of carriages there is a hard plank to sit upon; but in the second the
passengers sit so completely face to face, and have so little space for
their legs, that, unable to stretch out their contracted knees, they suffer
what may be termed the knee plus ultra of uneasiness. We hear a great
deal about Railway Extension, but the piece of Railway Extension that
ought to be first carried out, is an extension of the space allotted to the
legs of the second-class passengers.
“As far as ventilation is concerned, the third-class is much better off
than the second, for the very small compartment in which the habitués
of the latter are boxed up, subjects them to suffocation if the windows
are closed, and to the operation of having their throats cut by the
sharpness of the wind if the windows are open. In the third-class the
i. is at least sufficient to admit of something like an adaptation of
the admission of air to the convenience of the travellers.
“It being quite clear that in point of comfort, and convenience the
third-class is superior to the º there remains the question why
any one is found to pay just double for a decidedly inferior article.
Perhaps, Sir, it may be that the company is more select; but now that
the Railways have taken to the practice of shuffling their passengers
all together like a pack of cards, by stuffing third-class passengers into
first-class garriages, the distinction may be considered to be at an end;
and there is positively nothing to be gained, even in the ‘look of the
thing,’ for which some persons are fools enough to pay exorbitantly,
} going in a second in preference to a third-class on a railway.
here used to be a sort of advantage in the semi-civility of the tone in
which the collector asked for the tickets of the second-class; but since
the railway officials have been curtailed in number, and cut down in
salary, they have sunk into a state of sullen barbarism towards all
classes, which vents itself in one monosyllabic growl of “Tickets,’
addressed indiscriminately to all the passengers. -
“My advice, Sir, is, that, until the directors make a decided differ-
ence in the quality of the accommodation, the public refuse to pay the
double price, but make a practice of avoiding the inferior second-class
and going by the superior third-class carriages. I have no fear that
the directors will use my hint in order to make the third worse than
the second, for that is happily impossible.

THE COUNTRY IN ALARM.
As every newspaper teems with letters and advertisements calling
the public attention to the unprotected state of houses in the country;
to the audacity of burglars; and the means of protection against them;
such as gongs, bells, locks, patent albata plate, fire-arms, and other
signals and weapons; we have ventured, to print the copy of a letter
which has been despatched to his amiable lady by a most ...
country gentleman now, in town; and which contains an account of
precautions, which, if followed at the present alarming crisis, will keep
any family in the country secure from depredators and burglars:—
“My DEAR BEssy, A parcel will be sent per railway, and left at
the Funkington Station, for which you will please to send, not any of
our own people (for I do not wish †: to leave our premises un-
necessarily), but either one of BULL's the farmer's men or CLINKER's
the smith's, with our cart and horse, as the parcel is heavy.
“Do not let candles come unnecessarily near it, as the º: con-
tains combustible materials which might blow the cart }. ou had
best open the parcel in a dry cool º alone; and put the packages
marked fireworks into one of the bins in the granary, keeping the key
and the secret, and serving out the articles when, necessary. If Toy
gets hold of them, his infantine spirits might lead him, into, mischief,
and we should have him setting to his sister's frock and blowing
his own head off. - -
“The parcel marked A. is the Patent Exploding Detector, and Bow
Street Fulminator, one of which you will please to hang upon every
window of the house. The pyrotechnist informs, me that it makes a
noise equal to a twenty-four pounder, that each fulminator goes off six
times, and discharges death-balls, which will dangerously wound the
robbers if they are hit. ..
“B. contains the Domestic Rocket and Country Beacon. When the
fires are carefully raked up of a night, you will put one of these up each
chimney, and from our bed to the fire-place, communicating with the
beacon, you will put one of the C. slow matches, so that, at an alarm
by putting your hand out of bed, you may light the match, which will
light the rocket, which will send up blue lights and fireballs, to point
out the way the rascals take if they attack us, and to be seen all over
the country.
“D. ºcanisters of gunpowder, which also, my dear, you will of
course prevent ToMMy from getting at. E. are bullets. -
“The revolver, with two cutlasses, in the parcel F., you will hang up
in our bed. I think, my love, that you might as well take a few lessons
in the first principles of the sword exercise from SERGEANT HQLSTER.
A little # and pistol, for mere show, are for Tow's room... Of course
it will not be i. as the little rascalmight make mischief.
“You will put the blunderbuss with the spring bayonet in Rogers's
bed-room, and let the maids, have a couple of stout cutlasses and a
pistol between them. There is no need of fire-arms anywhere except in
the bed-rooms: having them in the lower rooms is just a premium to
the thieves, who would be nearer to them than we. And it will be as
well, during the day, that the men and the maid servants should wear
a serviceable dagger, and that you have one yourself at your side.

THE BROUGHAM ARMS.
AMONG the various uses of heraldic honours
is one that rather concerns the public
than the possessor. The 'scutcheon of
many a nobleman is the sign of a tavern,
We hope, therefore, that a noble and
learned Lord will not be affronted if we
pro “The BRough AM Arms” as the
style, title, and visible indication, of a
place of entertainment for man and horse.
As the artist who shall have to execute
the required painting may want some
directions for his purpose, we subjoin
them. The reader will perhaps be inclined
to believe that the estimation in which
heralds were formerly held, was owing to
their possession of a prophetic faculty.
Thus, according to Lyson’s “Magna
Britannia,” runs the description of the
arms and crest of the BRough AM family:—
“ARMs—Gules, a chevron argent, between three
fishes (luces) hauriant, proper.
“Chest—A sinister arm embowed, in armour,
issuing out of a wreath, holding a fish.”
THoMAs MoULE’s “Heraldry of Fish”
- contains a cut of the BRough AM Arms
representing them, together with the crest, enclosed in the mystical
vesica piscis; thus it is evident that the BRough AM shield is icthy-
ologous within and without—fish all over. - . . ]
t is needless to dilate on the relation between these armorial |
bearings and a recent transaction in the river Eamont. We cannot,
however, refrain from noticing the particularly curious coincidence that [.
the arm represented as grasping the fish is the sinister one. Could any
§§ be more appropriate to the irregular sportsman—the WALTON of
e Wire :
We must also call attention to the singular circumstance that the
fishes of the Arms of BRough AM are luces...A luce is a full-grown
pike; a pike is the well-known emblem of a pettifogging lawyer, a creature
|among whose tribe, we are bound to say, our great law reformer has
been at least as destructive as he has to trout.
Yes; there must needs be established an hostelry to be called “The
BROUGHAM Arms.”. It must be situated not far from a pleasant meadow
intersected with babbling rills, well stocked, and having plenty of weeds

BROUGHAM HIMSELF AGAIN.
The Sea Serpent Crossing the Atlantic, as
LORD BROUGHAM, as everybody knows from his lordship's own an-
nouncement of the fact, is about to proceed next April to America.
The illustrious peer is no doubt actuated in some degree by a feeling of
consideration towards the Great Exhibition of 1851, and withdraws
from all competition, saying to himself, “There will not be room for
both of us.”
Perhaps he contemplates P. in a new character, and goes to
America with the intention of reconciling all the political self-variations
which he has exhibited through life, and becoming a really United
Statesman at last. It is quite impossible that such a phenomenon
can cross the Atlantic without causing an unusual commotion, and
exciting quite as much attention as the sea-serpent, whom, by the way,
his lordship goes very opportunely to succeed.
We may expect to receive accounts of the appearance of a most
extraordinary animal at sea, in the course of next year; and though we
should be sorry, by anticipating the penny-a-liner to take the bread out
seen from the Yacht “Toby.”—Capt. Punch.
of his mouth, or the paragraph out of his inkstand, we may expect
something like the following to be going the round of the papers in
the course of next summer.
“THE SEA-SERPENT ONCE AGAIN.
“One of the oddest fish that ever was encountered, has lately made
its appearance in the Atlantic; and though in some respects resembling
an inhabitant of the land, the odd fish in question, shows such a won-
drous power of self-adaptation to all circumstances, that it would be
impossible for it to seem anywhere out of its element. An inspection
of its coat proved it to combine all the various colours of the dolphin,
and though it showed a decided affinity to the Great Seal, still on closer
examination, the observer could not help exclaiming,...," Very like a
whale,” when the idea of the Great Seal suggested itself.”
Such is the kind of article that may be looked for under the head
of Naval Intelligence when LoRD BROUGHAM is fairly off for America.
MR. PUNCH TO PIO NONO.
MAY IT PLEASE YoUR Holiness,
I am sure I have always behaved as a friend in my humble
way to your Holin Ess, and also to your Holiness's flock in this
country, although your Holin Ess has never sent me any sugar-plums.
I am still willing to do both yourself and them any reasonable service
in my power, and that is why I take the present liberty of addressing
your HOLINESS.
Will your HollNEss please to tell me what I am to say next session

that you have created an ARCHBishop of WesTMINSTER, particularly

Of course, SPOONER, and PLUMPTRE, and INGLIs will argue that if
ou erect Archbishoprics in the QUEEN’s dominions there is no
nowing to what extent you may choose to carry your interference in
HER JESTY's affairs; and that perhaps we shall have you absolving
her subjects from their oath of allegiance next. And I really don’t see
how I am to answer them, unless your Holiness will inform me. You
see, the behaviour of your Piedmont prelates in setting themselves
above the laws, gives a very unfortunate plausibility to the arguments
of those gentlemen.
Enactments, I believe, still exist in the statute-book rendering some
of your clergy er officio liable to be hanged, drawn, and quartered.
Abortive attempts have been made, from time to time, for their repeal;
but, through the pious care of INGLIs and others, those curiosities of
legislation have been preserved. . When Chish91.M ANstey asks for
their abolition, next year, he will be told, that it is necessary that such
laws should be retained in terrorem. I used to pooh pooh this ratioci.
nation; but now, unless your Holiness will instruct me to refute it, I
shall be as §: as CHIsholm will. Both our mouths will
be stopped with the Archbishopric of Westminster.

how am I to defend the Maynooth Grant against

the admission of Roman Catholics to take degrees at Oxford or

to condemn the QUEEN’s Colleges, which are merely neutral insti-
tutions, whereas, you have all along allowed Roman Catholic youth to
go to the positively Protestant University of Dublin? I always thought
that Roman Catholicity never contradicted itself. Will your Holiness
give a handle to the heretics? -
Whether Fathers ever differed from Fathers, and Councils from
Councils, is a moot point of history. But there can be no mistake
about contemporary inconsistency; and, if this can be detected in your
HoLINEss's system, it will be all up with it, your Holiness, as sure as
my name is Punch and yours is MASTAI FERRETTI.
Your Holin Ess, I imagine I know what sort of influence your
Thurles Bishops desire to exert on education. They want to make
things pleasant to orthodox taste—to cook the accounts of science and
philosophy, an’t please your Holiness. The sun comes out of this
culinary—or CULLENARY-process about two yards in diameter, I
think. If this is so, and Truth is the food of the mind, what reply
shall I make to those who, applying to stewed principles and hashed
facts, a well-known proverb, remark, that Heaven sends good meat, but
a personage from º antipodes to Heaven—saving your Holiness's
reverence—sends cooks? Pray, your Holiness, advise your Holin Ess's
sincere well-wisher, 39&Iſ?C#.

“GooDºº ROYAL DOMEs.Tics.
We learn that HER MAJESTY, in consideration of the wants of the
domestics of the late QUEEN DowageR has, “out of her own purse caused
yearly bounties, varying from £30 to £50, to be awarded to those persons
whose claims are most prominent.” We are sorry for it; and are prone to
attribute the advice given to HER MAJESTY to some spite in the breast of
the ministerial councillor against MR. BENJAMIN Bond CABBELL. We are
not sure if that ill-used gentleman has not a clear case of damages, a case
to be argued before the advertising philanthropists of England against Lord
John Russell, who would not move an appeal to Parliament on his own
º nsibility, and who, by his ill-timed counsel, has deprived MR. B. B. C.,
M.P., of a very touching opportunity of coming forward in advocacy of the
claims of the virtuous and the pampered. ad HER MAJESTY's purse-
strings remained undrawn, our eyes might have been rejoiced with an advertise-
ment for another Testimonial. Such document was already agreed upon–
drawn up-and would have appeared in the morning papers. However,
as we have been favoured with a copy, it shall not be iſ: and here it is:-
THE “GooD" DOMESTICS OF QUEEN ADELAIDE.
At a meeting held sº at the Goose and Gridiron, BENAMIN
Boxp CABBELL, Esq., M.P., in the Chair; it was resolved by a body of
ſº too numerous to be º afficularised, to appeal to the
reasts and Pockets of Englishmen, in º of the “Good” Domestics
of Her Majesty the late QUEEN Dowager. When it was considered that
all these “Good” Servants had devoted their lives to the promotion of the
best interests of themselves—when it was universally allowed that these
admirable domestics had shown a rare example of sagacity, by dwelling in a
palace when they might have pigged in an alley—that many of them, with
the most extraordinary heroism towards the #.
scarlet and gold, when they might otherwise have
—when many of them, for the gratification of the public, had
ridden on birth-days and drawing-rooms, behind a carriage, when
they might have drawn a truck; when all these, and unore than
these claims of singular disinterestedness and self denial are con:
sidered, then may these servants be emphatically denominated
the “Good” Domestics of the late QUEEN DowageR.
Further, the Committee are touched with the liveliest º:
feeling themselves enabled to assure a British Public, that the
valuable and affecting epithet “good,” is not the exclusive pro-
perty of any two, or three, or half-dozen of the aforesaid Domes-
tics, but all of them,-it would seem by virtue of large wages, high
living, snug lodging, and handsome clothing, all of º y
virtue of such advantages, being equally virtuous; that, in fact,
one Domestie is quite as “goon" as another. However, a few
º º, but only as a sample of the others—are below
escrl
No. 1. THE “GOOD’’ Coach MAN.—A man who has devoted
all his life to the promotion of humanity; a man who, in the
most ticklish turnings, always “cried gee, and spared the lash:”
—a man who, though filling a high position, handled the reins of
ower with the lightest grasp;-alman who has condescended–
}. his very boº, and that on a state-day-to-grin at a chimney-
j." and chuckle at Punch-and-Judy;-a man who, in the
Roy Kitchen, never touched neck of mutton, when venison
smoked upon the board;—a man who, without hesitation, would
refrain from beer, resolutely reserving himself for port, in fact,
the “GOOD’’ Coach MAN!
No. 2. THE “GOOD" FootMAN.—A most valuable member
of the Human, Family, standing six-feet-two; and yet with no
more pride in him than Toyſ. Thumb, with his two-feet-six. A
man who had devoted all his life to the attainment and after
nourishment of his own calves. His linen was spotless; and the
maiden's cheek might have envied the blush on his silkstockings,
upon levees and drawing-rooms. A Footman who, though pre:
senting the rare example of being born to stand behind a royal
coach, nevertheless knew “what was taxes;” for—and that for
his own widowed mother—he once paid the water-rate! Many
words, might be built-like cheeses, one upon another-to º:
him; but one word, in its full-bodied fullness, is sufficient: he is
the “GOOD” Foot MAN!
No. 3. THE “GOOD " HALL-Door: Porter.—From his
earliest days, from the time he first stood upon a stool to open
the wicket of the royal back door of a royal garden, No. 3, the
Porter, has devoted all his life to bolting an unbolting And
yet, though born to be a porter, there is, throughout his whole
existence, abundant proof that he never slammed the door even
in the face of his poorest fellow-creature, no fragment of a nose
—not even of the humblest classes—ever having been found
between the royal door and the royal door-post. He was kind to
all, saying nothing but yes and no; and if he growled a little,
never attempting to snap. Whilst, in his unceasing love of art
and letters, he never, though often known to be aroused from
his slumbers, by the importunities of artists and authors, he never
º (as it could be proved) frequently advised so to do-he
never kept a dog suspected of madness to turn loose upon and
bite, them!, The Committee feel that iſ, in search of a word
to declare the merits of No. 3, they were to open the Dictiona
of the immortal Doctor Johnson, as often as No. 3 unel
the portals of the royal mansion, they could find fºr him. º
epithet so abundantly expressive of his virtues as THE “GOOD
LL-Port ER!
No. 4. The “GOOD" TIGER.—Born as he was in the highest
room of a royal house, and weaned upon ass’s- the º
of royalty, No. 4 presents the singular spectacle of a Tiger devoting
his whole life to the human species. A Tiger, nevertheless, of the
most condescending and affable deportment, ha been known
to go heads-and-tails for bull's-eyes with ever so many charity-
boys of ever so many schools—in which the metropolis a
and who, though a regal Tiger, has been seen more, than once,
yes, more than a ; many times, eating kidney-puddings, with
the most unpretending of his species. Let other Tigers desiderate
the epithet Royal; the Committee call, and that emphatically,
No. 4, THE “GOOD’’ TIGER!
No. 5. The “GOOD’’ DAIRY-MAID.—The Committee desire
to recommend the virtues of No. 5; who, though born to a Royal
Dairy, never watered the milk, never chalked it, and never was
known, to the poorest of her species, to give a short ha'porth.

indeed, melted by blushing at her own merits. The Committee may
further say of their Dairy-Maid what SIR. T. Over BURY says of his
Maid—she dare go alone, and unfolds sheep i' the night [and there-
fore a desirable wife for any single grazier] and fears no manner of ill,
because she means none. In a word—the best word—the Committee
confidently proclaim No. 5 to be—THE “GOQD” DAIRY MAID !
The Committee might proceed with numerals up to 30; but conclude
with 5, thinking they have said enough to stir the hearts, and unbutton
the pockets of a sympathising and liberal public.
In the event (which by the way is not to be imagined) of there not
being a sufficiency of funds subscribed to erect thirty statues in Tra-
falgar Square to the honour of the 30 “Good” Domestics, then—
The Committee would recommend the establishment of a triple in-
stitution for the benefit of the aforesaid Domestics—an institution of a
çharacter as universal as philanthropy itself. With this view the
Committee confidently suggest as an asylum for the 30 an Hotel—a
Cook-Shop—and an Alamode Beef-House.

THE MILL OF ATHOLL’S GLEN.
AFTER OSSIAN.
(Wide Times of the 14th and 17th instant.)
WHY is the peeper of ATHoll,
closed? Wherefore is the eye
of STRANGE surrounded with a
ring of purple?

ron knuckle, the fist-mark of

The Autumn winds were
singing the coronach of the
summer in Glen Tilt. A moan-
ing, as of no end of ghosts,
There, with the red and brown
leaves falling around him, stood
the CHIEF of CLAN ATHOLL,
with a party of ladies and gen-
tlemen.
Shrouded in the mist of the
distance cometh SANDY MAC-
LARRAN. With him behold two
stranger forms approaching.
Onward they come, with the
sturdy tramp of youth; stout
are the cudgels which they
grasp in their nervous fists.
HQ, there, ye that range un-
bidden the Glen of Tiit Halt,
e wanderers from the land of
ockney ! Stand, ye jumpers
of the counter!
- º- - We are no jumpers of the
counter: no wanderers are we
from the land of Cockney. We come from the meadows that, are
watered by the Cam,_from the abodes where Learning dwelleth in
her Colleges and Halls. Thither journey we on this beaten track. And
who the deuce art thou that hinderest us? -
Ken ye not the CHIEF or CLAN ATHoLL,-the tourist-baffling Duke,
of the impassable glen?
For the Chief of ATHoll’s Clan we care not a dump ; the Duke of
the impassable glen we value not at a farthing. e have passed
the Asses Bridge, wherefore should we not cross thy glen? CHIEF OF
CLAN ATHoLL, get out of the way! Duke of the impassable glen,
stand out of the sunshine!
Fire flashed from the eye of ATHoLL; wrath blazed from the counte-
mance of STRANGE. By the collar he seized the foremost youth. Back!
Return by the way thou camest. Back! or, by the beard of my ten
thousand ancestors, ye shall rue the day! Back, I say, on your i.
ye sons of Granta! -
Unhand me, CHIEF of CLAN ATHoll, or whoever thou art." Unhand
me, I say, or I will punch thine head. Thou wilt not? No? Here
goeth, then; take that for thyself!
Together they rushed; the son of Granta and CHIEF of CLAN ATHOLL.
swept through the hollow glen.
Furious was the Chief, and wild, and aroused was the Under-Graduate’s
monkey. Blow was exchanged for blow; lunge for lunge; slash for
slash; heavy was the countering, and the knocks resounded. Loud
shouted the gentlemen: shrill were the screams of the ladies.
The Chief was overcome with fury, and hit all abroad. Wary was
the Cantabrigian youth, well trained on the pleasant banks of the Cam
to enoounter in stand-up mill the brawny bargee. Sharp fell the stinger
on the proboscis of STRANGE ; fast flowed the claret from the conk
of ATHöLL. One, two, were planted on the optics of the Chief–
darkness swam before him: then fell a stunner on his ducal frontis-
piece, and he was doubled up by a finisher in the breadbasket. He
staggered—he fell into the arms of his faithful henchman—even the
arms of SANDY MACLARRAN.
To the rescue ! DoNALD of the tufted chin. Roderick of the red
moustaches, to the help of your Chief! HAMISH of the Pipes—
Doug AL the breekless—claymore for CLAN ATHOLL!
The eight hands of the four bold grooms are at once on the collar of the
Sassenach. As many more grasped the coat-tails of his companion-
the Heelandmen were braw. From before the bruised face of their
chieftain they drag away the sons of Granta.
Mourn; for ecchymosis encircles the
the visual organ of ATHoli, is darkened.

THE CAMPAIGNS OF LOUIS-NAPOLEON.
(Written by some Coming THIERs.)
“THE future Emperor displayed all his usual courage in the me-
morable review that, took place, on the celebrated plain of Cramboli,
in the pretty little village of Fiddeldeedee. There could not have been
less than 25,000 soldiers upon the field, but nevertheless our Em-
peror advanced boldly in the midst of them, and, seizing the glass of a
wherefore didst thou darken
Why
Chasseur that was already primed, he put it deliberately to his lips, and
drank it right off in the presence of his brave troops. This daring act
of courage cannot be sufficiently appreciated, unless we state that the
wine in question was a glass of Maçon, commonly known as the rin de
trois sous. The Emperor-that-is-to-be had no sooner drained the glass
than he turned away his head, and tears were observed to come into
his eyes. This uncontrollable act of emotion has been attributed to
the sourness of the wine, but such libels * increase our admiration
#. the object of them, and makes France love its future Emperor
the more.
“Towards two o'clock, when the heat from the enemy’s (kitchen)
fire was the hottest, and the batterie de cuisine, that was stationed on
the brow of the opposite hill, was keeping up an incessant discharge of
saucissons and roasted chesnuts, the proud youth who has the honour
of being the nephew of the “Son oft' Destiny,” rode forward on his
Arabian charger, and, dismounting, with the greatest coolness, picked
up from the ground a marron de Lyon before it had time to explode,
and, biting it with his teeth as if were a cartouche, eat it, amidst the
cheers of his enraptured army.
“Our Emperor-President surpassed himself that day in acts of
gallantry. The English Ambassador was endeavouring in vain to open
a bottle of Stout, of the far-famed MoNs|EUR GUINNEss, for the
restoration of a party of ladies, who had followed the fortunes of the
French army all the way from the Rue Lepelletier, when he was rudely
pushed aside, and the neck of the recreant, bottle was severed at one
coup de sabre, that caused the precious liquid to pour forth in a flowing
stream of the creamiest abundance. Need we state that the blow was
levelled by the unerring hand of Louis-NApoleoN, who immediately
rushed from the spot to avoid the compliments that were awaiting him
on all sides. -
“Whilst the slaughter amongst the chickens and cold ham was at its
fiercest height, the noble form of a National Guard was seen gallopping
across the plain, surrounded by a dense body of dust. As the form ap-
proached, it was discovered to be the uniform of a captain of that distin-
guished regiment, and loud cries of “Wire l'Empereur” rent the air, when
the captain was discovered to be no other than Louis-NAPQLEON. Being
in want of alight for his cigar, he had preferred riding a distance of two
miles right into the midst of the enemy's fire, sooner than take it from
the hi of one of his own suite. Such acts of fearless heroism carry
their own eulogy with them. -
“The campaign commenced as early as one o'clock in the afternoon,
and did not terminate until three. For two hours our Emperor-Elect
never stirred from his saddle but once, and yet he did not look in the
least fatigued. -
“Two thousand bottles of champagne were left upon the field, and it
is calculated that at least six hundred chickens must have perished on
that fatal day. The Emperor that-is-to-be, some day, on riding across
the plain, was i.º. observed to drop a tear as he looked upon the
affecting spectacle of their mangled remains.”

A THOUSAND JOKES IN A THOUSAND HOURS.
This arduous task, undertaken by a veteran punster attached to the
Punich establishment, was º: at 7 o'clock on Saturday night
last. At an early hour Fleet Street was crowded by persons of all
grades, who were anxious to see and hear the veteran punster make his
thousandth pum. The concourse was so great, that there was some
difficulty in clearing a sufficient space outside the Punch Office, to
which it was understood beforehand would be one of a practical
Some anxiety was manifested as to whether the veteran
would be able to finish his arduous task, and bets were made, a quarter
before seven, that he would not get through the entire pun within
twenty minutes.
At a little before the hour, an apple-stall was placed at the corner of
Bride Court, and it soon began to be rumoured that the thousandth
pun would be in some way connected with the stall; an impression
which gained strength when it was observed that the stall was un-
attended by any one in the character of proprietor. A few minutes
before the clock was expected to strike, the punster emerged from the
office door, amid the cheers of the bystanders, who were worked up to
the highest pitch of excitement at the near approach of the moment for
the completion or failure of the gigantic task that had been undertaken.
Presently the police force, under the command of INSPECTOR
WAGGLEs, cleared a way to the stall, when the veteran punster, throw-
ing himself across the top of it, amid several lots of a ples, exclaimed,

cheering was deafening, and, it still wanting a few seconds to seven, the
veteran ran through a course of puns upon apples—including every
appellation of which they are susceptible—with apparent ease, amid the
tremendous enthusiasm of the multitude.
The last pun was completed in ten seconds,-a fact, we believe, that
has been º: and the veteran must, accordingly, be
regarded as the swiftest punster of this or any former period. In
order to show that his punning strength was not exhausted, he conti- f
nued to make a pun every hour up to Monday night; and in the course
of the day made four puns backwards, each of which he completed in
less than fifteen minutes. He afterwards proceeded to be weighed,
when he was found to have lost, during the days employed in the feat,
seven pounds, supposed to be missing from the roof, or upper story,

THE GRAND PACIFIC JUNCTION CANAL.
FROM the melancholy alterations taking place, under the name of
improvements, in the Parks, it is a relief to turn to the operations now
just ready to begin, for connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by
the formation of the Nicaraguan route to California, under, the joint
auspices of America and Great Britain. To most of us, timid harmless
Englishmen, who had rather not go to war any more if we can help it,
because it is expensive as well as murderous, the following announce-
ment in the Times City-article in reference to this undertaking, will give
additional satisfaction:—
“The two Governments of Great Britain and the United States have bound them-
selves to the enterprise by a treaty of protection. All the other powers will accord to
it the same advantage. The territory around it will consist of the first neutral ground
whence, by the pledged faith of all civilised natious, strife must be for ever banished."
This will be trying the Utopian experiment—as your hard-headed,
strong-minded men of the world, call it—of a treaty of universal peace
on the small scale. To be sure this may not answer just yet, and the
advocates of peace must be content in the mean time to be ridiculed by
the strong-minded, who must have some good cause or useful invention,
struggling upwards, to laugh at for the time being—vaccination, copper-
caps, gas, steam—no matter what. However, international arbitration,
like other wonders, may astonish their strong minds one of these days;
for all their present exultation at beholding the Danes and Schleswig
Holsteiners cutting each other's throats for nonsense. Strong minds
will be strong minds; they will chuckle at the early discouragement of
a good cause; just as they will make sport of the disasters of an inven-
tion in its infancy. This remark is not, though it may seem, a digression
rom our point; which is the fact—however our statement of it may be
hooted and groaned at—that the conjunction of the Atlantic with the
Pacific must necessarily have a peaceful tendency.
A SEASONABLE SENTIMENT.

THE EMPEROR IN A BOTTLE.
GREAT events have been shadowed forth in a º: manner. Hens
have laid eggs, with a change of dynasty written in legible characters,
upon the jº, and little boys have been exhibited with words—pro-
phetic words—apparent in the iris of the eye. Some years º a child
appeared at the tian Hall, with NAPOLEON in both eyes; a
wonder that, now º prophesied the advent of the French
President. A newer and later wonder has come to light; for a bottle
of champagne opened at the review at Versailles, was found to contain
a complete effigy, in little, of Louis-NApoleon, ărest as the Emperor.
Of course, we could not expect anything to make a large figure in so
small a thing as a bottle—even in a bottle intended to contain imperial
measure. The figure was, we repeat, extremely small, but who can
mistake the design?
NO MORE BABIES AT THE THEATRE.
“DEAR SIR,
“I AM a bachelor, and necessarily with the very sensible
observations you made two weeks ago, upon ‘Babies at the * I do
not mind confessing that babies are my especial horror, and I believe
they regard me with pretty nearly the same feelings, for a baby no
sooner sees me, than it immediately begins crying. One, half of my
existence has been spent in an implacable warfare with children—more
especially those under twelve months of age, in long clothes.
‘Thank goodness! my exertions have not been totally unrewarded.
I have lived to witness the * day when they were first excluded
from omnibuses. Formerly babies enjoyed a monopoly in every bus.
They could come in in any numbers they pleased, occupy the best places,
make as much noise as they liked, and never pay anything for the
privilege. But at length came the triumphant ‘BARIEs Must BE PAID
FoR. Since then, º: gradually dropt off, and one can actually
ride, at present, from Paddington to the Bank without having one's
shirt-collar and whisker nearly pulled out together by the roots, or the
symmetry of 9ne's wig entirely disturbed by having the back part
º right in front.
“Now, Sir, I would recommend the application of the same law to
babies at the theatre, I believe that at present no charge is made for
a baby that is carried in its mother's arms. Hence the evil, and its
abundance. But if a º was charged the same price as anybody else
-and, for my part, I would have them charged double—you would not
have so º mothers indulging in this unmotherly practice. They
would leave their babies at home, which is certainly, in my opinion, the
best place for them at all times, but more particularly at that time of
might. Only recommend, Sir, that over every gallery and pit door in
Lºndon, be written up, as in every omnibus, the fearful warning,
BABIES, Must ºr PAid Foº, and you may depend upon it, from that
time, a baby will be as rarely seen in a playhouse as a Quaker, or the
members of the British Aristocracy.
‘From the tenor of my observations, Sir, you will at once be able to
see that I am “Not THE FATHER or A FAMILY.”
FROM AN EX-LUNATIC To THE DUKE OF ATHOLL.
My Lord DUKE,
WITH a feeling of tender interest I address you. Pardon me,
I cannot do otherwise. I feel myself irresistibly called in to your case,
and giving myself up to the influence, cannot do otherwise than fancy
myself seated beside you on your native heather—the unprofaned
heather of Glen Tilt, sacred to Dukes and deer. At this moment, your
Grace, I am taking the most affectionate survey of your countenance—
am watching your eyes—and have the most sensitive two fingers upon
your Grace's pulse. Will your Grace condescend to allow me to look
at your tongue? Thank you.
d now, my Lord Duke, whilst there is yet time, let me address to
your understanding a brief narration of my own experience. It is fit I
do so. Knowing what has befallen me—a person, I confess, very con-
temptible in the eyes of gods and men in comparison with your gracious
self—you may in your own majestic mind consider whether or not the
same sort of brain-work, fed by the same blood, touched by the same
nerves, is alike common to Dukes and to men who are not Dukes.
There may, there is—I allow it—the like difference between the noble
—the hereditary brain—and the brain vulgar, as between the web of
the finest cambric and the coarsest towelling; nevertheless, both have
the like cross-work constituting web, however different the texture.
This, º to the present hour, even your Grace may be disposed to
allow; let me then, whilst there may yet be time, warn your Grace by
a short narration of my own story.
For these last fifteen months—(I became unmanageable last dog-
days twelvemonth, when the moon shone on mights as mellow, almost
as ruddy as any one of your Grace's red gold salvers)—I have been an
inmate of Doctor STRAIT's Asylum, Clapton. At first, I was con-
sidered all but incurable; but phlebotomy, blistering, with cool, thin,
depleting diet, has brought me back my brain, I am confident, better
than new. I only remain under the roof of Doctor STRAIT until my
hair is quite grown, not wishing to ap among my friends with an
visible mark of my past lunacy, and having, I hope, a wholesome an
manly objection to the hypocrisy of a wig. now, your Grace,
to the warning contained in my story.
I am a man of large landed property. The whole of Glen Battersea
is a part of my present estate; to say nothing of every inch of the Isle
of Homo parted with—I may almost say, given away to the crown-
for a consideration. Well, my Lord, being a man of landed property,
I considered it mine-mine to the very antipodes—all mine, under my
|feet; and, as I É. to believe, all mine over my head. The moon that
a
shone on Glen Battersea was my own moon; to be produced or put by
like a cheese in a º: as I willed, to treat myself and friends: the
stars burning blue above Glen Battersea were my own lucifer matches,
burning to light my own cigars. I had, as I believed, a very extensive
freehold in heaven—although I had º time to think of the
tenantry. All this grew in me every day: and after a while I became,
as I thought, so large-so vast—that I was too immense for the globe.
I had at times a weeping compassion of the world; for, like a cucumber
fº in a bottle, I that # greatness might out-grow my
its; that Imightwax and wax, until Isplit the wholemundane system,
bringing down sun, moon, and stars, like so many pewter-platters from
a kitchen shelf. But-thank goodness!—your Grace has none of these
symptoms yet: mo, with eye on your eye, and my fingers still on your
wrist, I am assured of that.
My anxious, friends—and I can never forget the solicitude of my
nephew, sole heir to my property—became alarmed at my growin
sense of magnitude. However, they took no steps to confine me until
manifested the following delusion. Every day I would walk, round
Glen Battersea with a key in my hand—an iron key, my Lord Duke, not
unlike the key in the left hand of the naked man, your Grace's crest—
and, pausing at every hundred yards, with this key Iwould take a
resolute turn in the empty air, believing that I had thus double-locked
Glen Battersea (like a butler's pantry) against all men, women, and
children; and resolving to treat all intruders, after such rigorous
double-locking, as trespassers and burglars. Ha! H." Grace smiles a
º: smile at my delusion; I am glad to see it. Let all your friends
ethankful for the growing consciousness of that smile. -
The fact is, your Grace, I had in Glen Battersea, as I believed, a
magnificent variety of rabbits; single, double, and butterfly-smuts, with
the flop-eared and every other sort, dear to the fancier; whereupon, I
resolved that my rabbits should be held sacred from human intrusion.
Upon this point, I was inflexible; and when the barge of the Spectacle-
akers’ Company, during a heavy stress of weather, put in at Bat-
tersea Reach, ordered the Warden and all the Company to be taken
into custody by my, gardener, cook, and housemaid; nor could I be
pacified until assured by those faithful domestics that they had marched
the trespassers beyond the Glen, across, the boundary, to await the
railway at Wandsworth. They tell me, that I had a slight scuffle with
º Spectacle-Maker; but of this, of course, I remember
nothing.
Well, your Grace, not to be tedious—although your sense of atten-
tion gives me increased hopes-next morning I was coaxed into a glass-

coach and soon found myself here, with Doctor STRAIT, at Clapton.
After a time, I ceased to be violent; when—so wise, so humane, so
beneficent is the system perfected by the noble Doctor CoNoLLY-I
was permitted, for amusement, to have the use of scissors and any
amount of foolscap paper. Thus set up, I did nothing for months, but
cut out ground plans of Glen Battersea; , with thousands of every
variety of rabbit; together with a beautiful moon, a nicely vandyked

nobility, and the public in general, will take care not to confound me
with such an arrant impostor as the aforesaid GEORGE HUDsoN, but
that, out of respect to me and my reputation, they will treat his fabri-

THE GRAND NATIONAL CONCERTS.
(By our Impartial Critic.)
URED by an advertisement much
exceeding in grandiloquence the
last puff of Moses, I went to hear
the grand National Concerts at
Her Majesty's Theatre, on the
second night of performance.
I paid my half-crown for a ta,
like a man—I mean, like a fool.
took it for granted that the pro-
menade would be crammed; but
i learned at the cost of ls.,
which was the difference between
the promenade and stall prices—
that I must not take things for
granted.
My eye, instead of alighting on a sea of heads, fell on comparative
vacancy, relieved by two policemen in glazed hats, leanin †: a
sort of isolated stile that stood between the orchestra i the side-
boxes.
The "decorations of the house delighted me with their extreme
simplicity. The absence of the bush, I thought, betokened that the
wine would be good. Seeing no fillagree, I expected to hear music.
The entertainment mainly consisted of Beethoven's Sinfonia Heroica,
divided into two parts, between which intervened a succession of
frivolities, all ins erably tedious to me, and unredeemed by anything
of the slightest interest, except Robert, toi que j'aime—very beautifully
played, in the course of a fantasia, by MR. PIATTI. -
}. tell me to consult a medical man, or to take a blue-pill. I am
not bilious; nor was I then. It is nonsense to talk about a jaundiced
ear, of course; but I had nothing of the sort. The orchestra which
performed all that rubbish was a magnificent one, and played the fine
symphony of BEETHove N, as far as I could judge, gloriously.
But what is the sense or wisdom of setting a first-rate band to
accompany wretched ballads, and to execute the most unmeaning pieces
of commonplace dance-music, which a harp, a drum, and a fiddle would
do abundant justice to ? You might as well have Mr. MACREApy, Mr.
PHELPs, and MR. WANDENHOFF, and such-like artists, to read vaude-
villes from the French—I had almost said, to play the Merry-Andrew
in the ring at MR. BATTY's. - -
Then, dividing the heroic symphony is doing things by halves; and
filling up the interval with ball-times and sing-song, is just equivalent
to laying Macbeth in two portions, and introducing between them a
$º. a farce or two, and a monopolylogue, or the acrobats. .
MR. BALPE and his splendid orchestra may command success, if their
directors will play their cards as well as they themselves will play their
violins, &c. e are not a MIDAs of a public, and if our young sparks
are to be captivated by the Polka's ponderous levities, the Polka, with
its accessories-illuminations, statues, gongs, blue-fire, gilding, refresh-
ment-salon, coffee, and ponche à la Rºmain must be the stunning,
screaming, flare-up tout-ensemble of the unapproachable JULLIEN. The
attempt to rival that man of genius must be a failure; but if MESSRs.
BALFE and Co. will turn their attention to .#. masters, whose
style is more in their way, I have no doubt they soon obtain better
audiences than that of which your humble servant formed part the
other evening, at the irreparable sacrifice of half-a-crown.
THE FIRE ANNIHILATOR.
MR. PHILLIPs threatens to put out all the Fire Assurance Offices.
There are men, whom we could name—men both East and West of the
Bar—who, in our patriotic moments, have caused us much uneasiness,
when we reflected upon what they could, if they so minded, do with
the Thames. Well, we have read the account of MR. PHILLIPs's fire-
annihilating power, and we snap our fingers in security. Even SIR
§: LAURIE is harmless, and the Thames is safe. Here is a barge
blazing:
“A number of materials were placed in the hold, as turpentine, saltpetre, wood,
shavings, straw, and such like combustibles, and set fire to. The chemical vapour was
introduced after the fire had been allowed to burn four minutes and a half, and in three
minutes and a half the whole was extinguished.”
So far so good; but a great triumph remains to be achieved by
MR. PHILLIPs. Let him without delay remove his Fire-Annihilator
into the Diocese of the Bishop of ExETER: a diocese full of com-
bustible matter, contin igniting. At the late consecration of the
church of St. Peter, at Plymouth, the power of the Fire-Annihilator
might have been instantly tested. However, there is little doubt that
another opportunity will soon arise, when if the Fire-Annihilator put
out a PHILPOTTs, the glory of the invention is complete; all other tests
being needless.

A REFLECTION.
“MON CHER PUNCH
| ºf am one Frenchman—I beg you no laugh, if I send to you
| my littel count of my infortunes. I am in one great rage—so big I
cannot hold myself—and am reduced to the bottom of despair.
“I arrive à Londres by the chemin de fer. I take one which you call
cab. I put on myself my spectacels. I place out my head of the
window-et voilà que one littel gamin throws at my nose one large
paquet of papiers. I almost lose my head with the blow—and which is
above that, I almost lose also my spectacels which is in gold. But what
is twice worse still is to come. I put my head out of the other window.
I desire to see le célèbre pont de Londres—but Sir, you believe me, or no
believe me, one d blacky guardë comes up and he smiles to me, and
I say “Bonjour Mister,’ ...? then, without say one word, he plants me
in the figure one tremendous bundel of papers, which is one treat-
ment. I never do receive before out of the hands of personne. Qh, Sir,
I did smell myself—je me sentais—tout blue with colºre. I did tear
the air with my cries—I swear comme un enragé. But still worse is
behind. I again put out my head of the window, and from this side
and that side, and all sides, I did get papers and bills, and pouffs, an
paquets, hundreds thrown all together at me in my face, and I do fall
back smothered on my back without knowledge for ten minutes. Oh!
Sir, I was completely out of myself with the indignité, and not that
only but I was nearly out of the cab also

most mad dog that bites. It is a conduite without paralléle. I shall

And then, because he will not run after your ‘Fashions, you run after
him, comme des sauvages, and pelt him all the way with them. I cry
aloud to Scandal, and I only hope she will hear me. You throw your

Very few alterations will be requisite in the churches of the arch-
deaconry of Pimlico, which will be given over to the orthodox º at

in whitewashing the interior of the building, and simplifying the

ROBBERIES WHICH THERE IS NO NOISE ABOUT.
Tº UsT now much excitement is prevalent
on account of the numerous burglaries
which have been committed of late:
but the robberies which have provoked
a universal outcry are nothing to those
which are submitted to in silence. Be-
tween the Government, the Prerogative
Office, the Proctor, and the officials
legatees are robbed in the Ecclesiastical
Court to the amount of three or four
per cent. An inventor, before he can
secure the benefit of his own device,

in the Patent Office.

A PRIVATE PROTECTIONIST DINNER.
A small but select party of Protectionists dined together yesterday
at LoRD SLIDE AND ScALE’s. Among the guests were the EARL of
their respective ladies.
The cloth having been removed, after the usual common-place
observations, -
SIR SIMON EARs, without, rising, proposed a toast; If their noble
host had no objection, and the ladies would not, think it too horrid a
breach of bienséance, he would ask them to drink “Confusion to Free
Trade.”
MR. PUNsonby was sure that the proceeding suggested by SIR SIMON
could in no sense be regarded as an offence against MANNERs. (Oh, oh!
and mild laughter.) - -
Wiscountess WHEATFIELD declared it was quite dreadful. She did
not mean the toast, but Free Trade, and that sort of thing.
e noble host said it, was exactly so; and in point of fact it was
“that sort of thing” which was the most objectionable part of the affair.
“That sort of thing” was the social change that would follow—egad!
was following—in the wake of Free Trade. , MR. Thomas CARLYLE
was very severe upon Flunkeydom; but #"; him, Flunkeydom rather
than Yankeedom, into which he feared English society was fast
degenerating. - -
e MARQUIs of GRANARY was exactly of the noble Earl's opinion.
The immediate effects of Free Trade were of little consequence, com-
paratively. Competition would keep up rent, Yes; but competition
would bring a totally new set of farmers into the occupation of land—a
H. of independent fellows who would treat the relation between
andlord and tenant simply as a commercial one, and would see you at
the deuce before they would vote your way if they didn't think fit.
What would be the consequence?
CoRNELIUS BARLEE, Esq., said, the consequence would be that the
law of primogeniture—for one thing—would be abolished; for the new
race of farmers would be a part of the shopkeeping interest, and your
shopkeepers would want to get at the land of the country, in order to
be paid their confounded debts. And then what would the nobility and
Wiscount WHEATFIELD should send all his boys into the army.
LoRD SLIDE AND SCALE said, that by Jove there would be no army
to send children into by-and-by, with, those peace-notions continually
gaining ground. He hoped he should not live to see it, but if things
renticed to linendrapers and tailors, as sure as fate.
The Honour ABLE Miss FADDELL would not think of such a thing—
the idea was so shocking!
MR. OATEs saw clearly that, if Free Trade should lead to doing awa
with entails, there would soon be an end of the old families of England.
A jº named Higgs, who happened to be of the party, sug:
ested that it was possible that an old family might perpetuate itself
y_proper conduct, as well as an old firm.
Rp SLIDE AND SCALE, though he did not quite like the comparison,
certainly thought there was something in that.
The conversation then turned on the last large cut in Punch, and

A COSMOPOLITE MOTTO FOR THE EXHIBITION
of 1851.
MR. Paxton, in his speech at Derby, which had sound, strong sense
running like gold thread through every word of it, let fall a sentence,
that, in letters of coloured glass, should appear over the doors of the
ſº crystal palace. He said—“He believed it was a good thing to
ave the conceit taken out of us. He had often had it taken out of
him, but, the next morning, he started with new vigour, and a greater
determination to reach success.” A capital truth, with hope still
brightening it. More; Punch suggests MR. PAxton's own words as
a motto for his own structure. Here they are; in good, plain, unmis-
takeable English; for the eyes and heart of John BULL.
“It Is A GOOD THING To HAVE THE concEIT TAKEN out of Us.”
Now, when John beholds any manufacture soever, in which he,
JQHN, has heretofore considered himself as eminent over all, and in
which, to his astonishment, he confesses himself outdone; let him
confess to the wholesome medicine recommended in the PAxton pre-
scription; and on the morrow morning, let him follow out the PAxton
regimen, “starting with new vigour, and a greater determination to
reach success.”
Punch thought the axiom of MR. PAxton so admirable, so fitting to
the occasion, that he immediately forwarded a copy of the words to
each of the Foreign Ambassadors at our Court, requesting of their
several Excellencies, a good translation of the English; that the
Ambassador's countrymen might, in their own language, enjoy and
lay to heart the wisdom of the apothegm. In almost every instance
Punch met with the most frank and cordial treatment at the hands an
pens of their Excellencies, whose various translations are subjoined.

... The Frenchman, wandering along the Crystal Palace—or threading
its six mile gallery—may, haply, acknowledge the beauty of this when
he finds that he does not as yet make quite as good knives and forks as
John at Sheffield.

This Italian has been forwarded to Punch by CARDINAL WysEMAN,
and has at the present time a touching significance. Pope Pio NoNo's
workmen visiting the Exhibition i. we trust, lay it reverently to
their hearts; and so, let a little of the conceit be taken out of them.

And we have little doubt that every Portuguese, with the humility
that is his great national characteristic, will touch his beaver, and own
the touching truthfulness of the adage.

The German, with his eye upon a butt of BARCLAY and PERKINs—a
sample quadruple XXXX—will think of his own white beer, and confess
that the product of the British vat may take the conceit even out of a
hero from Wienna.

And the i. with the words in his memory, returns, to his
hotel, and, calling for a glass of his native sherry, may haply declare,
with ; sigh, that the English wine-merchant has taken all the conceit
out of it.

And EFFENDI, the Turk, strokes his beard, and, looking at English
beauty, thinks of the flowers of Stamboul, and crying “Allah Bismallah,”
confesses that the lovely infidels do, somehow, take all the conceit out
of them.
Can there be any doubt, that the Paxton axiom, translated into fifty
languages, and emblazoned throughout the glass edifice, will do a
world of service, proving to all nations of the world, that “It Is A Good
THING TO HAVE THE conceit TAKEN ouT OF Us?”

RAPID WIEW OF THE ENGLISH STAGE.
(From the Observer.)
THE Daily News complains that in all the French pieces that have
lately been translated, and are now performing on the London stage, no
allusion is in the least made to the original authors, whilst the names of
the translators are paraded at full-length in the bills... Now this is
being, we think, a little too fastidious. Perhaps the Daily News would
wish the French authors to receive half the proceeds paid for the trans-
lation, and to bow from a private box, or to walk across the stage, and
to receive the applause .."bouquets usually showered M. the happy
translator in consequence of the success? Perhaps, also, the Daily
News would like to see the names of the French authors on the title-
pages of the printed books of the play, and to claim half the proceeds,
when there were any, of the sale? This would be rather, too pre-
terous, and we are sure that our English translators would be the
t persons in the world to wish such a state of things enforced in this
country.
º'Em tlish Drama is flourishing remarkably well as it is, so pray
leave it º and do not attempt to ruin it, by introducing stupid
foreign ſandango notions into it. We have a right to steal the French
dramas as much as we like, but only let the French authors, or actors,
attempt to come over, or to interfere in any way with our stage, and
we tell them that they will be hooted off the boards in the same igno-
and gloriously expelled, two years ago, at Drury Lane. We only want
the French Dramas, that is i. As for their actors, we have far better
than any they can send us; and as for their authors, we do not want
them at all, so long as we have such an experienced body of translators,
who produce pieces even better than the originals. Away, then, with
the canting cry that the English Stage is in a state of decline—we are
positively sick of it!
A DREAM OF WHITEFRIARS.
-- Do not know how it happened the
| other day, that after reading DR.

in my back shop, over a i. of
brandy-and-water, and thinking
what a mild, moderate, artless let-
ter the Bishop's was, Tfell into a
doze, from which I was awakened
by the ''}. of a Friar, with
a map of London in his hand, who
had lost his way to Smithfield,
whither he said he was bound,
having been just appointed Master
of the Charter House and Arch-
deacon of London.
“Is DR. RAIN then dead,”
said I, in the Italian, language,
% == of which I don’t understand a
word.
--
es,” said he. “Have you
not heard? All the Archdeacons,
Deans, and Bishops, and the two
Archbishops are dead; and we
have come over to take possession. Your religion is dead: it died the
night, before last. I am to bury it; and I am walking about this con-
ſº town since morning. Pray, show me the way to the Char.
reux.
My daughter Fanny Punch, who has just come home from a finishing
school in Belgravia, fell down on her knees at the sight of this ragged
old hermit and begged his blessing. Whereas my son Jack, who is a
student at Saint Bartholomew's, looked as savage as might be at the
interesting foreigner; and muttered something in his teeth about
“confound the old Guy FAwkEs, I’ll HAYNAU him : ”.. and he was for
sending the Friar to Pimlico (to Jericho he might go if he liked, Jack
said) had I not reproved him for his discourtesy to a stranger.
Miss Fanny went up the chimney to get a bottle of Eau de Cologne
to wash the dear Father's feet, and to work him a pair of slippers, she
said : and Jack was, in the meanwhile, so struck by the spirited nature
of my rebuke, that he begged pardon of the “old Buck,” as he called
him, and offered his Reverence my glass of brandy-and-water, and a
penny Pickwick, which the old man, putting on his mitre, began
to smoke.
It was a very handsome mitre, made out of a copy of the Daily News,
containing the Pope's letter: , and, having a bottle of red, ink before
me, I painted a few devils on it, with my finger, so that it became the
Friar very well. And Toby, smelling his wallet, began nuzzling his
nose into it, where he found a rack, a thumbscrew, and a stake ready
for roasting.
The Friar turned rather red when ſº pulled them out, and hid
them away up his sleeve as a dentist hides his pincers. I was of course
too well-bred to make any remark, though I saw that my name was on
the stake with a Latin inscription; but went on painting up the mitre
until it was complete, when I presented it to him, and he ſell to
drinking my brandy-and-water, till his eyes began to wink as if he was
for all the world a miraculous picture.
Whilst partaking of the brandy (which is MoRE1's, and the very best
in London), he sang, to a melody of MozART, that, beautiful ganticle of
an early English divine, GuALTERUs De MAPEs, beginning “Mihiest
ropositum in tabernå mori, vimum sit * morientis ori,” &c.;
and as I looked at him, I remembered that I had seen him twenty
ears ago, when I was making a tour with my friends the IyyleAFs.
I remembered him perfectly well. He was the first friar I ever saw-
a regular Rabelaisian. Friar, a dirty, lazy, red-bearded, thick-lipped,
leering vagabond, crawling along a wall in the sunshine-looking, if ever
man did, stupid, brutal, and idle. .
What was the impression on my mind on looking at that fellow? If
I had been a sovereign prince, and administrator of the law, I should
have liked to begin by kicking him soundly, and then would have said,
“Take a pickaxe and dig, you lazy swindler—take a musket and march,
you big beggar—take an oar and pull, a hod, and get to work—do
something to earn your life, stupid! You shall fill your paunch at other
men's charges no more.”
Qur friend MRs. IvyLEAF was one of that company, and saw like me
a Friar for the first time—and what was the impression upon that good
woman, that kind Puseyite soul ? MRs. Ivy LEAF confessed that she
should have liked to kneel down and get ablessing from that venerable
man. So different, in our minds, were the impressions of each, at the
view of our bare-footed friend. One wanted to kick him: one to kneel
down at those red shanks, and beg a blessing from that beggar. The
fellow represented quite different emotions to each of us....To the one,
Friend Barefoot was the symbol of piety, austerity, celibate purity
charity, and self-denial, Touching pictures of convent gates crowded
by poor, and venerable Fathers feeding them; sweet images of pale-f
nuns, in moon-lit cloisters, marching to church, singing ravishing hymns;
magnificent minsters, filled with kneeling faithful, and echoing with
i. ing organs; altars crowned with roses, and served by dear old bald-
leaded, venerable, priests in gilt vestments, and little darlings of white-
robed incense-boys; confessionals, and O such dear, melancholy, wasted,
consumptive clergymen, with such high foreheads, and such fine eyes,
waiting within HMRs. Ivy LEAF kneſt to all these, no doubt, in her
adoration of her First Friar.
Whereas, what was the feeling of Mr. Punch * Think of hard pinched
peasants, and simple women and children, depriving themselves of their
meal to feed that lazy, besotted, ignorant boor; that pampered Flemish
Obi-man, thought I | Think of that fellow's blessing carrying a super-
natural grace with it !—of yonder vagabond assuming to be one of the
celestial chamberlains, without whose introduction one can't get admis-
sion to the Courts of Heaven! Camérier of His Houſ NEss; he carries
his key, along with begged sausages and onions, in his wallet. That
man means ignorance: that man means superstition: that man means
priest-worship: that man means assumption of divine powers by one man
over another; powers to curse and bless; to deny hope and Heaven;
powers to separate wife and man, child and father; powers of occult
rsecution, as it
domination, or open tyranny, or ruthless and bloody
may be-Powers divinely transmitted, says FATHER BAREFoot, sealed
with the seal of the Fisherman, and handed down these eighteen
hundred years–Powers Infernal, I say, to be fought with all weapons,
with hate, with scorn, with ridicule, with reason.
“Hatred—scorn—my son l’” says FATHER BAREFoot. “For shame!
You have good feelings—why do you malign us so unjustly?”
“Look at this image,” says he, taking one out of his bag, “this little
figure of a Sister of Charity. Çan anything be more beautiful than she?
Think of her denying the world and its vanities; gathering together the
little children of the poor, and teaching them; watching the pallets of
the sick; hanging over the lips of the fevered patient, whispering con-
solation, and catching infection and death for her reward. Here is a
missionary in China or England. Death is the end of his career—he
knows, and braves it; and Tuy goes to the sword, or CAMPIAN to the
gallows, martyrs to the Truth which they serve. Or look at this
venerable figure, this white-haired priest with the infant in his arms,
the Almoner of Providence, the Father of the poor. Can all Histo
show a character more beautiful—can any heretic, however hardened,
refuse his love and reverence to ST. WINcENT DE PAUL * *
“Yes, reverend Sir, Saints and Martyrs you can show in abundance;
faith and charity among your people, goodness and virtue, who denies
them P I suppose the most sceptic among us would take off his hat to
FENELON, or ask a blessing of PAscAL. But these, O pious Father, are
not the only figures in your wallet. Show us Alva; show us TILLY:
show us the block and the fagot all over Europe, and by the side of
every victim a priest applauding and abetting. Show us Borgi A burn-
ing SAvoNARola; show us GREGoRY THE Good singing 7e Deum for
the glorious day of BARTHOLOMEw, and all the Friars of Paris, with gun
and dagger, achieving the victory. You say that HENRY and ELIZABETH

persecuted as well as MARY and PHILIP Yes, and, by the same
right, and by the same logic. Grant to you or them the ordering of
belief and the possession of the truth infallible; and persecution
becomes a necessary and laudable means of strengthening doctrine. If
by taking me out of my shop in Fleet Street, and carrying me to Smith-
field, and there roasting me, you can stop my wicked º put an
end to my pestilent publication, and frighten my family and their chil-
dren after them into orthodox faith and certain salvation; it is much
better that I should be roasted. I daresay FATHER NEwMAN would
think it a duty to look on. Ask him whether his Church has been a
persecuting Church or not? Ask him whether persecution is lawful or
not? Ask him, who loves the flogging of the discipline, whether its
application to heretic shoulders would not useful? declare
solemnly, and vow, O BAREFoot, that if I held your belief, and if I had
the power, I would begin persecuting to-morrow ; and I would give a
dangerous philosopher who j about the age of mankind, a touch
of the rack, just to admonish him, as GALILEO was laudably admonished
by the Holy Office.
“Your Reverence says, Psha! old-world bigotry, wicked cution,
and that it is we who are persecutors now—not you.-My dear Sir,
look at the Synod of Thurles. It was bigotry on our parts twenty
years ago to doubt that the spirit of the Roman Catholic clergy was not
one of meekness and brotherhood. What did they want but that our
children and theirs should be educated together? What other desire had
they but that little heretics and little papists should learn A, B, C, on
the same benches, and the rule-of-three off the same slate? Who cºnid
be more quiet, genteel, loyal, and retiring than a poor persecuted
Roman Ecclesiastic before the Catholic Repeal Act, desiring mothing
so much as fraternity; nothing but equal rights; having no wish to ask
anything from Government beyond that fair share which should belong
to every citizen? Now there is a Blessed spelling-book and a Cursed
spelling-book: now there is a Godly rule-of-three and a Godless rºle-
of-three: now division is requisite: hatred must be organised. How
are the Godly and Godless to live together?
“Do you suppose the story is a new one? The REVEREND MR.TAR-
TUFFE began in this way. The worthy man, kicked out by a neigh:
bour with whom he had been playing the same game, first entered
into ORGON's house, by sufferance; hung about as a htmble retainer;
made himself useful by a thousand means; was so good, so gentle, so
| correct in his morals and edifying in his speech; ate so little, and was
really so agreeable and clever, that everybody was glad to give him
house-room, and pitied the poor fellow for the monstrous persecutions
to which he had been subject, and the unkind things said of him in
his former place. We know what came next. He slowly went on
winning favour, the dear man; and setting the family by the ears. He
put the father against the son, and the wife against the husband.
He worked on the terrors of some; the follies of all: until, one fine
day, when he announced that the house was his own, and that he was
no longer dependent, but master.
“And what happened? The good-natured dramatist (that kindest
and gentlest of mortal men), who had the power over his little creation,
brings condigm punishment on Moss. TARTUFFE; and the curtain falls
as he is .# off to prison, to the applause of all the spectators; and
with a compliment to the author's gracious Prince, the hater of hypo-
crisy, the lover of freedom and justice. It was the gracious Prince
who revoked the Edict of Nantes; who (with the applause of the
reverend the clergy) carried fire and sword amongst hundreds and thou-
sands of honest citizens, his best subjects; and who died a driveling
ºld, dotard, wife-and-priest-ridden, his pride trampled down by
Prºstant victories, and defeated by Anglican Schismatics.
'That is what His fioliness caſis us christians in his kind letter,
which creates our country into a province again, and prºlº us with
a dozen Bishops and a Primate. §elcome, gentlemen! Welcome, my
Lords and your Eminence!. Come with cross and banner, shaved heads

and always remains the same. You brag of it. His Hoſiness says
the Church is always the Church. And so it is: with the same art; the
same arrogance; the same remorseless logic; marching pitiless to the
same end,
“And so, FATHER BAREFoot, your Reverence, with the beard
and sandals, is welcome, as the Oratorian young gentlemen with the
lack cloaks and broad brims, who parade our city. Why not these as
well as a Quaker's beaver, or a Bishop's shovel-hat? You can't give us
Englishmen, a Church in Rome; because you are avowedly tyrants, and
intolerant of any creed but your own. But that is no reason why
we should refuse you. Walk in, gentlemen, and you, old BAREroot,
give us your hand, as the practice of Englishmen is, before they
set to.”
“My good Sir, you are growing angry,” the Monk said. “This con-
versation must end. I want to get to the Charter-House, I tell you
before the Angelus; and see the place where our Monks were murdere
by your Protestants.”
“You go through Smithfield,” I said, “where our Protestants were
murdered by your Monks.”
And he got up in a huff to go away. But I suppose I must have
been in a dream. for when he went out I thought my Monk had turned
into DR. Pusey.
PREROGATIVE WRONG.
THE ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY cannot but pray that the heart
of Parliament will be turned towards a due consideration of the mani-
fold iniquities, the growth of time—the fungus of antiquity—that make
the Prerogative Court, his Lordship's own Court, little better than a
den of thieves and a board of cannibals. In the Prerogative Court,
the fatherless and orphans are served up as the standing-dish-the
nominal daily bread—to clerks, registrars, and surrogates. Then there
is the seal of the Court, with its most expensive impress, with warrant
and stamp, stamp and bond, that, according to a correspondent in the
Times, show that “a charge of £4.7s. per cent of the net property
must be paid into this Court before the deceased's children can receive
their lawful portion of the hard earnings of a provident parent.” Now
the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, grieved and oppressed by the con-
tinual consciousness of this robbery of the helpless, for the ſattenin
of sinecurists, will be compelled to bring the matter into the House o
Lords, unless reform originate, with the Government. The prelate, as
the highest ornament of a Church, whose Voice said–º Suffer little
children to come unto me,” cannot endure the reflection that they come
into his Court only to be plundered. He must put down the atrocity;
The spirit of SAwNEY BEAN, the child-eater, must not continue to hold
the scales of Justice (late the property of Shylock) in the Court of
Prerogative.
The Victory of Trafalgar.
The Naval Club celebrated the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar
at the Thatched House Tavern. The Chairman, in an eloquent speech
gave—“The immortal memory of NELson.” Drunk with silence. And
then Mr. Punch—who had received the honour of an invitatiºn-begged
to be allowed to give, in his own way,+“The Oblivion of Nelson's
Daughter.” Drunk, with blushes.
THE GREATEST BULL EVER KNOWN.
The Bull by which the Pope has appointed DR, Wise MAN Cardinal
Archbishop of Westminster. Perhaps the individual thus singled out
for Papal favour will furnish an example of the greatest. Misnomer ever
known, if he should proceed to act upon the instructions the See of
Rome may have given him.

of enlightenment aunong the webs and cobwebs of Chancery, there are
still many dark recesses of legal chicanery—the word th
evidently a corruption of chic-anery—into which Reform has yet to
penetrate. The ºil. of the effects of deceased persons is one
of those barbarisms that are still permitted to exist under the name of
law, whose sanction enables certain persons called Registrars and
Surrogates to take very large slices off very small properties. The very
name of Surrogate seems to imply supererogation, and the items of the
charges connected with him are quite characteristic; for he is, according
to a bill recently published in the Times, paid twice over for the same
thing; inasmuch as “attending before the surrogate” and the “surro-
gate's fee” are two distinct and separate charges. -
We wonder how long it would be tolerated in other professions and
trades, if the system of law costs were to be adopted. Suppose a
dentist were to send you in a bill for “ º your tooth;"
“attending drawing; ” “Filing decayed part of tooth; ” “attending
filing;” “Drawing your attention; ” “engrossing same; ” “m
extract; ” “ *i; extracting; ” with a variety of other particulars
that could easily be set forth, if any other bill were to be made out, on
the principle of a lawyer's. An omnibuscad might as well charge 6s. 8d.
for “a summons to stay,” if you hailed him to stop; and, if you got
into a cab, the driver might as well insist on 10s. 6d. as “fee to horse for
drawing same,” in addition to the fare properly payable. We trust the
time is coming to an end for the existence of these legal extortions, which
are facts quite as oppressive as any of the legal fictions that have been ex-
terminated within the last few years by an improved spirit of law-making.

THE LORD OF THE GLEN.
A Rough Companion to the “Lady of the Lake."
Two enterprising Cambridge men
Were traversing Tilt's famous glen:
Fassing the known but guarded way,
Through copse and cliffs they boldly stray;
*Till, at a rock's huge point they stop,
And out they see a Chieftain pop.
Up, up he springs, with stick in hand:
“Your name and purpose, Saxons! stand!”
Thus they reply: “Laird of the kilt,
There’s right of way across Glen Tilt.”
“You think so, eh?” He whistled shrill,
And he was answered from the hill.
Wild as the yell of the yahoo,
From crag to crag the signal flew.
That whistle garrisoned the glen,
With two great raw-boned serving-men.
Waiting their laird's imperial will,
They stood awhile stupid and still;
With sturdy bludgeon forward flung,
Upon their master's nod they hung.
He scowled, and cried—with sable brow—
“Intruders, say, what think ye now P
These are Glen Tiltian gillies true,
And, Saxons, I’m the Reg’lar Doo.”
THE MONASTERY OF PIMLICO.
A MonastERY of Pimlico is to be founded, to match the Convent of
the Belgravians, as the gander, though in a state of celibacy, matches
its female. This institution will be dedicated to ST. HISTRIO of the
HUMs, and ST. SIMIUs, ABBOT OF Jocko. -
The Superior of the Monastery will be an eminent cle an, recom:
mended for the situation by his ingenuity in interpreting the Articles of
the Church of England in a non-natural sense. .
The Monks are to be young Anglican ecclesiastics of a class now not
uncommon, whose state of mind needs a temporary seclusion; and who,
if they had not an Abbey to go to, would require to be sent to some
other asylum. -
The establishment will derive its support from the resources of the
inmates, until Covent-garden and other alienated Abbey-lands can be
resumed by the Legislature, and re-applied to their original purposes.
In winter the Friars will be clad in a black serge gown with a cowl,
over the ordinary clerical attire. They will also wear a partial hair
shirt—not next the skin, however, but only under the waistcoat. The
wn will sometimes be worn open, so as to exhibit this penitential
i. . The trousers must either be short, or tucked up, because they
...} not accord with the chaussure, which is, of course, to consist of
sandals. Stockings, together with the latter, would be a violation of
costume; therefore, to save appearances, and avoid chilblains too, their
place will be supplied with tight silk fleshings, which will have all the
effect of bare legs, as displayed by the gentleman who enacts the Fran-
ciscan in Romeo, and Juliet. The tonsure, too, which the Monk may
wish to relinquish on re-entering public life, or forsaking celibacy, will be
managed on the same principle, namely, by recourse to a scalp, such as
MR. CULLENFORD assumes, to give a physical verisimilitude to his
personation of age, at the Theatre Royal, Adelphi.
The employments of the Monks of Pimlico will be, for the most part,

GOING RATHER TOO FAR.
cº SIR,
“I HAVE not the honour of knowing the Recorder of Birming-
ham, MR. M. D. HILL Professional people I only know professionally,
and, I must say, my dealings with lawyers have not given me any desire
of a more intimate acquaintance. But whoever or whatever this MR.
M. D. HILL may be, he is clearly an impertinent and short-sighted
person. His proposal to the grand jury at Birmingham is, that the
police shall have authority to arrest such persons as may lie under their
suspicions, and to require them, on º of imprisonment, to give
evidence that they possess means of support, ‘either from their
property, their labour, or the assistance of friends.’
“Good gracious, Sir, do we live in a free country or not? Why, Sir
I should . liable to arrest under such a tyrannous and inquisitorial
law, although I write “Honourable' before my name, and belong to the
best set in London. I have no property (except a few personals of no
consequence, such as dressing, gun, and pistol cases—my wardrobe,
and so on). I have not yet, I am thankful to say, been reduced to the
humiliating necessity of labour, and my friends (confound them l) have
long ceased to give me any assistance whatever. Mr. M. D. HILL
would surely never be so preposterous as to contend that I should be
arrested—a member of the Travellers' and the Coventry, with a stall at
the French Plays, a prospect (entre nous) of getting into the House,
when our people (the Protectionists) come in, the entrée of some of the
best boxes at the Operas (both of them), and the run of some of the most
exclusive houses in town.
“The fact is, Mr. M.D. HILL has omitted altogether the most répandue
and distingué means of support—I mean CREDIT-that which is *: I
am happy to say, open to the man of good family and address, an the
facilities for which are so much greater in this country than under the
wretched democracy across the §.
“I suppose that under this precious scheme.I am to be liable to be
hauled up by the police, at the request of any impertinent tradesman,
and treated as a swindler, because I don't happen to be able to pay
ready-money to my tailor, my hatter, my haberdasher, my wine-merchant,
my tobacconist, and my livery-stable-keeper!
“All I can say is, that if such a law ever come to be passed, England
will be no place for gentlemen. In the mere broaching of such a pro-
Fº I see a working of the same levelling spirit, which has done its
est to do away with that great safeguard of our institutions—the pri-
vilege of freedom from arrest of Members of Parliament.
“Of course, the idea will never be seriously entertained in influential
quarters, but I felt it a duty to society not to let it be even mooted
without recording my indignant protest.

Beef from the Vatican.
AMong the recent importations of foreign cattle, the most remarkable
is that of the extraordinary bull from Rome, though the bull from
Nineveh will probably be the more useful of the two. On arriving in
this country, the Roman bull gave such indications of being likely to
Fº mischievous, that it has been found necessary to take him boldly
y the horns. No intention, however, exists of placing him under an
forcible restraint; and he will be suffered to range at large, unmolested.
It is hoped, that, after all, he will turn out perfectly harmless. Should he
begin to be troublesome, the clergyman mentioned in the papers, the
other day, as having mesmerised a bull, or some other clergyman equally
clever, must set to work and quiet him.

It is very lucky that MoMus's proposed plan, that everybody should
have a window in his breast, so that the world might be able to see
what was passing inside, was never carried out, or else there would not

present day, would have to pay for the Window-Tax!
Starvation of Mind and Body in Ireland.
THE Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland, we are told, are going to

be much better taught than fed.

To subjects no one knows—from side to side

To be embraced—and the loud public voice,
Turning to childish treble, pipes
And whistles for its wants. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange mysterious catalogue,

Sans head—sans tail—in fact, sans everything.

PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
191
THE MEETING OF THE MAYORS AT YORK.
(From our own Correspondent.)
FRIDAY, the 25th of October, 1850, will be a great day in the civic
annals of £ngland, for it was devoted to the return visit of the Lord
Mayor of London to the Lord Mayor of York—that illustrious couple
having within the present year exchanged calls at each other's Mayor's
nests.
Before speaking of the banquet, we may say a few words of the city
itself, which was formerly governed by a Mayor and three bailiffs—the
bailiffs being no doubt descendants of Isaac, the Jew of York—but in
1397, two sheriffs were, by royal authority, substituted for the three
bailiffs ; and by this Shrieval arrangement, the city was shrieved of its
impurity.
ork has been long celebrated for three things—York hams, York-
shire pudding, and York biscuits—all of which were to be had in pro-
flºwn at the late banquet. The bill of fare was of course imagnificent,
or—
“When Mayor meets Mayor, then comes the tug of turtle;”
and trente-deur potages opened the campaign, including huite à la
tortue ...ſº or, in other words, eight of transparent turtle—or
turtle which could be seen through, or,
the clearest character.
There were also four soups, a la PRINCE OF WALEs, which, we pre-
sume, is an elegant little idea of SoYER's, who has given to hare soup
the title of what he, in his foreign accent, might call the hare º:
Among the releves we find six chapons à la NELsoN, by which we
understand half-a-dozen capons sent up without their tails, for to render
them à la NELson, they must not have shown the white feather. Sir
saddleback de mouton would, of course, give sufficient sadlery to enable
every guest to have a bit in his mouth, and a stirrup-cup to have washed
it down would have been very acceptable.
The entrées contained, among other delicacies, huit cotelettes de mouton
à la ricomtesse-eight mutton chops a la viscountess; but as we never
took a chop with a viscountess, we can give no explanation of this dish,
and cannot say if the bone is to be admitted to the mouth as a sort of
bonne bouche à la Bourgeoise. Among the sweet stuffs, we find diº
paniers de fruits glacés à la Lady Mayoress—ten baskets of fruit ††
à la Lady Mayoress; who might be thought to be very cold and stiff,
from this comparison of her ladyship to, g fruits; but the fact is,
there is no foundation for this culinary libel. . . - - -
The guests were many of them of the h tdistinction, but we
miss a few names that we think should have been included. For ex;
* we find “the High Constable of Margate and friend,” and
...The Chief Constable of I e.” but we look in vain for the
“one policeman of Herne Bay,” who, as part of the Kentish force,
should have been, we think, invited with his brother constables. The
“Lord Mayor of fondon's Common Crier” was in attendance, but found
nothing to cry about, and judiciously kept his tears bottled up for
some more appropriate occasion.
The first toast was given by the Lord Mayor of York, who proposed
the QUEEN-a toast which was received with the enthusiastic loyalty
that is always excited by the mention of the name of HER MAJESTY.
His lordship very properly remarked, that though the days of chivalry
were gone, when a thousand swords would have leaped from their
scabbards in her defence, the QUEEN was still surrounded by thousands
and tens of thousands of honest blades, and by millions of hands, which
had substituted, for the warrior's steel, the loom, the shuttle, and the
spade; while, better far, every spade was a trump, and every shuttle
would help to shut up every battle-door. -
The health of PRINCE ALBERT having been drunk, His º High-
ness returned thanks in an excellent speech, which we hope will be read
by every one, and which we will not attempt to mutilate by curtailment
in these columns. The compliment paid to the late SiR Robert PEEL
is far too good in its idea, and in its expression, to be spoilt by an
sportive abridgment, and we leave it, therefore—with the whole speec
—to produce its legitimate impression on all who read it in eartenso in
the reports of the newspapers.
Other healths followed, and the Army was acknowledged by
CoLoREL CAMPBELL, who in the Queen's Bays had won his own
laurels. The Lord Mayor of London was proposed in the honourable,
but rather sombre, character of the “setting sun,” which caused him
to “rise” suddenly to return thanks, and the setting sun ultimately
resumed his seat, amidst a series of “hoo-rays” of the most brilliant
and exhilarating description.
The healths of the Ministers were then º and LoRD JoHN
Russell, was compared to the captain of a ship, in allusion, perhaps, to
his Lordship's alleged readiness to take command of a fleet, .. his
services be required. The Premier, looking at the wine before him,
expressed, sotto voce, his wish that, if ever he undertook the office of a
sea-captain, he should be always in sight of port, particularly such port
as that he now looked upon.
He then made a very fair average Ministerial speech to the general
to come to the point, mock of
that, like herrings
company, which told extremely well; and after a few more toasts, the
º separated at a late hour.
hile we give this meeting of the Mayors the benefit of our own
peculiar version, we by no means under-rate the value and importance
of these social meetings among the municipal bodies of our large cities;
and they are of still more value as the means of bringing royalty into
communication with, and enabling it to show its sympathy of idea and
feeling with, all classes of the people.
THE EXHIBITION PLAGUE.
ood MR. PUNCH,-I am a wife, and the
mother of, at present, five healthy
children; and write without º hus-
band's knowledge, who—except that he
will have his own way, which was never
meant for men, whatever they may say
to the contrary—is as good a creature
(for a man) as ever broke bread. I
write, I say, about this show that they’re
ing to put under a glass case in Hyde
ark. I am told—and I believe it—
that the Exhibition, as they call it
will bring another Great Plague of
London. I hear that in the Union Jack,
evening newspaper, we’re promised the
cart and the bell again; and all along of the millions of foreigners
in a barrel, will begin to wedge up London in
the spring; getting closer and closer through June and July. ..It’s
reckoned, Mr. Punch, in that paper, that every family's circle will be
widened twice its size, just as if you stretched a tea-cup into a slo
basin; and that hardly a cupboard, will exist that hasn't a lodger. In
the scramble that’s to come, it will be a mercy if-for a day together—
people find their own relations. But, Sir, it’s the Plague—or rather
the many Pl —that’s to be brought among us by the swarming
millions: the Plague on one hand, says the Union Jack, and the famine
—for how are these millions to be boarded—on the other? I’m told

Consecration of St. Mary's Church.
MR. GoDw1N’s new and beautiful church of St. Mary’s, Brompton,
was consecrated last week by the Bishop of LONDON. The structure
had been most liberally contributed to : the pile is, indeed, a monument
of charity and piety. GUNTER gave the f. and even on the
day of consecration, the collection, we are told, was most liberal...And
this brings us to the rite of consecration. Were the fees remitted?
The report of the ceremony, otherwise so full, is silent on this head:
we are sorry for it. We should be º to learn that the ground was
consecrated gratis; for, judging from the usual costliness of the cere-
mony, the heathen might almost think that money, and not devotion,
was the episcopal element of consecration—Cash, not prayer. ,

BRITISH AND AMERICAN ELECTRIC FLUID.
CoMPLAINTs are being made of the tardiness of the Electric º
as if its flash of electricity were sometimes a flash in the pan. The
superiority of the American mode of transmitting messages by this
wonderful invention is notorious; and if we did not know that, it was
owing to their Companies being more active, as well as liberal, than our
own, we should ascribe it to the electric fluid which they employ,
being “greased lightning.”

THE CARDINAL'S HAT.
ALL the world—or, in other words, all the readers of Punch—may
not know that the hat, the scarlet hat, the Cardinal's hat of CARDINAL
Wolsey, yet remains among us. It was poked out of a lot of bye-gone
rubbish lying in the Great Wardrobe by Bishop BURNET, when Čerk
of the Closet. From BURNET’s son, the judge, it passed to the
CountEss DowAGER OF ALBEMARLE, who gave it to HoRACE WAL-
Pole, who treasured the relic *i; rarities, in the Holbein
Chamber at Strawberry Hill; until the glories of Gingerbread Castle
were knocked down and dispersed by the Hammer-Bearer—the
Aºr THoR—GEORGE Robins, under the Piazzas in Covent
atolen.
The Hat, when sold from Strawberry Hill, was in a miserable con-
dition; stained, faded, moth-eaten; hardly thread hung to thread.
Divested of its historical associations, it was doubtful whether a
chimney-sweeper, intent upon his May wardrobe, would have accepted
the hat from any large-hearted housemaid. Equally doubtful is it,
whether any boy of decent spirit, with a proper pride in the appearance
of his Guy FAwkes, would have clapt the hat upon the effigy of that
magnificent ruffian; a sad fellow who, nevertheless, has met with scant
justice from posterity. For there are extenuating circumstances—shown
in a recent biography—that ought to tell kindly upon the memory of
FAwkes; since it is now proved that, by his own confession, his
rincipal object in blowing up Parliament “was to blow the Scotch
i. to their own country.” An endeavour that, we think, ought to

PREVENTION BETTER THAN
THE BEST CURE.
NoTHING can exceed the activity of
the Police after a great crime or
robbery has been committed. They
will run their legs off in pursuit of
the stolen horse, as soon as they have
been informed it has been stolen;
but to keep a watch upon the stable-
door, or to try whether it is properly
locked, is a thing that never enters
the area of their imaginations.
The recent burglary in the Strand
furnishes us with another proof of this
tremendous activity that always comes
too late. The accounts agree unani-
mously in saying that #. Police
are in active pursuit of the delin-
uents.” Now it strikes us strongly,
that if the Police were only to bestow
one half the zeal in preventing a rob-
§. they generally display in
finding it out, many thousand pounds,
and º a few lives, would be
saved in the course of every year;
and that, also, there would not be so
many inquiries and cries of wonder-
ment heard, after reading every fresh
case of burglary, as to “Where could
the Police have been?”
THE STEP NOT TAKEN.
THE Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's
have very recently shown a most praise-
worthy deference to the wishes of the
eople, and to justice in the abstract.
he Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s
have taken decided steps in the right
direction: namely,
The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s
have adopted two steps at the north
entrance of the Cathedral.
The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's
have further vouchsafed to the public
two steps to the south of the Cathe-
dral.
But towards the abolition of the two-
ence to the interior of the Cathe-
, the Dean and Chapter have taken
no step whatever.
be charitably considered by an unprejudiced generation. But to return
to CARDINAL Wolsey's hat. -
The hat, within this week or so, has marvellously recovered itself.
Nay, a miracle has been worked in the hat. The thing so old and
faded has become bright and better than new. The scarlet has returned,
and is as vivid in colour as the blood—that thaws every year, to be
continued in the next—in the phial of St. JANUARIUs. And more than
this; the hat that was shapeless, and lopped like a sick ass's ears, has
gathered itself up, as though instinct with the knowledge that it is
about to be called upon to appear again in public, after the neglect and
long .* of centuries. Haply the hat remembers the glories of its
Cardinal Master. -
The hat—for miracles must work in the web—may thrill with the
recollection of the time, when CARDINAL Wolsey—
“Came out of his privy chamber about eight of the clock, apparelled all in red; that
is to say, his upper garment was either of fine scarlet, or taffety, but most commonly
of fine satin engrained; his pillion of fine scarlet, with a neck set in the inner side
with black velvet, and a tippet of sables about his neck; holding in his hand an orange,
whereof the meat or substance within was taken out, and filled up again with the part of
a spunge, wherein were vinegar and other confections, against the pestilent aires. * *
And before him was borne first the broad seal of England, and his CARDINAL's HAT by
a Lord or some gentleman of worship, right solemnly.”
And so the Cardinal would go to Westminster Hall door; and there
he “judged every estate.” And the Hat, the Wolsey Hat, that has
survived to the nineteenth century, like LANDoR's shell, “remembers
its august abodes,” and by the renewed blood-red freshness of its
colour, and the sudden arrogance of its cock, evidently hopes to become
a WYSEMAN in the present generation.

EXPECTATIONS FROM ROME.
HE GENTLEMAN whose pro-
bity and magnanimity, no
less than his sturdiness of
frame and amplitude of
person, whose solid under-
standing, equally with his
capacious habiliments, are
well known to the readers
of these pages—the gentle-
man in whose welfare we
are all deeply interested—
would be glad to know
what are the limits, if any,
of the authority which the
Pope of Rome claims to
exercise in Great Britain
and Ireland, and where
the interference of his
Holiness in the concerns
of these dominions may be
expected to sº R
John BULL, in short, will
thank any learned Doctor
- of the Roman Church, or
other competent persons who will satisfy his anxious mind on these
particulars.
MR. BULL has been told that the º: pretended to * the
Roman PontiFF in this realm is confined to spiritual matters. If by
matters spiritual are simply meant moral and theological doctrines, and
rites of worship, M.R. BULL, says, well and good. Let the Pops, lay
down the law on these subjects, and welcome. MR. BULL will be
happy to return the favour.
ut if, in the pontifical view, spiritual matters are all matters that
may possibly have a spiritual bearing—institutions founded by the
islature for the diffusion of common information, for example, like
the Queen's Colleges—and the Pope holds himself entitled to dictate
respecting, them,-fair, and softly, says MR. JoHN BULL; for MR.
BULL would like exceedingly to be informed, whether there is any one
of our political or social arrangements of which his Holiness does not
think he ought to have the control. All of them are capable of bei
considered under the head of good or bad; all, therefore, have a moral,
therefore a spiritual bearing; and therefore are all subject to the juris-
diction of the Pope of RomE, for aught MR. BULL at present sees to
the contrary. - - - - -
Will his Holiness—possibly, one of these days—take it into his
head to condemn MR. BuLL's railways, as being too convenient and
comfortable, and opposed to the spirit of mortification and asceticism,
and tending, by the promotion of intercommunication, to propagate a
dangerous freedom of opinion, and an increase of knowledge indepen-
dently of faith? - - - -
Will he be pleased to fulminate an edict against sanitary regulations,
and precautions against plague and pestilence, on the ground that they
are based on a heterodox belief in the natural laws, and that we ought
wholly to trust to litanies and supplications instead? Especially as the
axiom of the heresiarch Wesley, that cleanliness is next to godliness,
is an error, being refuted by the practice of divers remarkable saints.
Is, it not considerably probable that he will take upon himself to
anathematise MR. BULI's whole system of legal provision for the poor,
because it discourages mendicity, and therefore charity, or indiscrimi.
nate almsgiving, as the profession exists, and the virtue is practised, in
orthodox cities on the continent, to the great temporal advantage, as
well as spiritual benefit of their inhabitants? -
Has not MR. BULL fair reason to apprehend that the Pope will, as
soon as may be expedient, declare his clergy to be irresponsible to the
law of the land, and amenable only to ecclesiastical tribunals?
May not his HoliNEss be expected to decide, in due time, that a
Sovereign and a Parliament of his own communion are vastly preferable
to a Protestant QUEEN and lature, and to invoke all his subjects,
on their allegiance, to aid and abet in carrying his decision out? -
Lastly, will the Pope or Rowe ever be satisfied with the authority
ssessed by him in this country, 'till John BULL becomes a Papal
BULI, entirely, and he has that stout and worthy gentleman—beaver,
broadcloth, boots, breeches, crabstick, watch, chain, seals, and all—at
his foot, kissing his shoe?
An Attorney-General for Everybody.
It has often been said, that, to secure the ends of justice, we want a

Guardians, and Ministers of all denominations, including those of the
Downing Štreet persuasion, to the advantages offered by their compre-
hensive educational establishment, hitherto known as the MANCHESTER
School, which now presents itself º: notice in a character which
must secure for it the patronage of rational persons, whatever may
be their opinions respecting the corn-trade and import-duties on foreign
commodities. This celebrated Commercial Academy has hitherto almost
wholly confined itself to rearing the politico-economical thought, and
teaching the young financial idea how to shoot: a delightful task, cer.
tainly, but limited in the sphere of its usefulness. The enlightenment
of the sort of darkness that prevails among clowns and 'squires was an
object of great importance; but MR. CoBDEN and his coadjutors feel,
that the time has arrived when the popular teacher must do something
more than, instruct rural, simplicity to distinguish between the right
hand and the left, and to discriminate the caseous product of Cheshire
from the material which constitutes the Hampshire Downs. To the
general inculcation of the fact that two and two make four, they intend
|to add instruction in all the rules of arithmetic, and in mathematics, as
also in the English and other languages, living and dead, together with
history, geography—including, of course, the use of the globes—geology,
chemistry, natural philosophy, and the elements of anatomy, physiology,
medicine, and jurisprudence.
For further º relative to their contemplated undertaking,
see the proceedings of the “Conference ’’ of its friends and supporters,
who met on the 30th ultimo, at the Mechanics' Institution, Manchester,
and resolved themselves into a Society, entitled the “National Public
School Association.” The “National #. School” will be a juvenile
extension of the original Manchester educational establishment. It will
be a real seminary for young ladies and i.e., composing the mass
of the community, É.i to imbue them with common sense and
common information, notwithstanding that their frocks may be made of
calico, and their trousers of corduroy. The clergy of different persua-
sions are particularly invited to patronise this Academy, as the reverend
gentlemen may each rest assured that no doctrines contrary to his own
will be inculcated there.
. In other words, the instruction given in the National School will be
simply secular. Matters of faith and opinion would by all means be
taught in the School, as well as matters of fact and science, were it not
that º would demand that every variety of clergyman should be
allowed to preach to the pupils in turn; an expedient which would be
attended with much inconvenience, and some confusion, and after all,
most probably, would not answer the end proposed. For the funds
necessary to the success of their grand º its promoters look
to the Government; on which they intend to call for the institution of
“a general system of secular instruction, maintained by local rates, and
managed by local authorities.” The prime object of their Association
at present is to arouse public opinion to the urgency and importance of
their demand, which is oppose º . stinginess and bigotry. But
the stinginess which grudges a school-rate is punished with prison-
expenses, and the bigotry, which denies information has had already
some return in kind; and, in case of continued obstinacy, may reap its
final reward in a papal interdict.
MR. C. and his colleagues . that these considerations will have
due weight, and trust to be enabled by the good sense of Parliament to
meet their young friends shortly after the vacation.
A NEW COLOUR FOR A CARDINAL.
THE odd conduct of the Pope of RomE towards the QUEEN and
Legislature of England, in creating an ARCHBishop of WESTMINSTER,
has made a deal of noise, wherein the groans preponderate largely over
the plaudits. , Now if his Holiness wishes to constitute an extraordi-
nary Archbishop, with the approbation of the whole civilised world
Mr. Punch will put him in the way of doing so. What the pontifical
arrangements are, in the Southern States of America, Mr. Punch does
: ºw ; but he conceives they do not include what he proposes they
Should.
What does his Holiness say to a negro metropolitan—say a black
Archbishop of Charlestown, with jurisdiction over South Carolina par-
ticularly, and in general over the whole of the Southern States of
America? Make the black man a Cardinal as well; give him a scarlet
hat, carefully engaging him, of course, not to go to a hop in it. Here
would be a fine º of reading the Yankees a lesson of humility
—of proclaiming the great Catholic ãº, of the essential equality o
the }. race,—and, withal, of dealing a heavy blow at slayery.
Will the only answer to this suggestion be, that the idea of making a
nigger a Prince of the Church, is too ridiculous?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
, train between Bruges and Ghent, a
MORE ABOUT HATS.
By our own Commissioner in search of one.
UR blow at the British hat has been severely felt;
and the British public is at length wide awake to
the importance of a sweeping hat reform. But
we will not leave our work half accomplished.
It is not enough to tear the crown from the
reigning hat; we are bound, also, to find a suc-
cessor more worthy of a place at the head of
British humanity. - -
The subject is acquiring an increased interest
from recent events in Rome. What has the Pope
given DR. WISEMAN ? . A hat? . And see what
communities, who gave the Counts of Flanders such a lesson under the
Arteyeldes. But hats will never, develope themselves thoroughly in
Belgium. There are too many soldiers—an army of 50,000, to a j
lation of between four and five millions, besides 590,000 National Gu !
The bravery of the Belgian is proverbial, but the schako has crushed
the hat. In every railway carriage, you may calculate on three soldiers
to every four §. and º their bodies are puny their head-
pieces are preposterous, Roman helmets of black leather, with spikes
a-top, crested Greek helmets, with great brass cones; hour-glass Lancer
schakos, Infantry cylinders, with shaving-brushes a-top, bear-skin
muffs, kêpis, - every other variety in which the us of the small
German or Belgian potentate runs riot, are seen in place of well-devised
civil coverings of the head. - --- - -
Moreover, of the above four civilians, two are certain to be priests,
and the priest’s hat is an object of our uncompromising opposition.
Its original is the noble sombrero, but superstition has crushed the
a storm-cloud is gathering out of it, black and
threatening, like the Djin out of the bottle, in
- the Arabian Nights Entertainment. -
Having, by order of Mr. Punch, completed a
Hataphobic tour on the Continent, with a mis-
sion “to observe the cities and hats of many men,” I now proceed to
record my experience, under its several ethnical heads—I should say hats.
I did not include France in my lº for several reasons. the
first place, the French are a light-headed people, and light heads are
satisfied with lighter hats than would suit the solidity of the English
nature. Again, people's heads in France having been a deal
turned by recent political events, there has been, in consequence, such a
turning of hats (and coats), that the observation of to-day may turn out
quite valueless for to-morrow. The bonnet rouge quite put the hat to the
blush, for a few months after February, '48. Yet to-day we find every
Frenchman eager to put his mob-cap into his pocket, and mount some
kind of a hat. There is, for example, the chapeau & tricorne—the little,
old, three-cornered hat, which the President, and the Society of the
Dix Décembre have been making a desperate attempt to bring up
clap at the head of everything in France; but it has gone by with the
Emperor — France refuses to be three-corner-hatted, just as she
refused to be bonneted after February.
Then there is the wonderful Socialist º which Louis BLANC,
CABET and CoMPAGNIE declare will fit everybody. This must be a
descendant of Fortunatus's wishing cap, for they assure us that those
who wear it will have everything t º, But the world has never
yet seen a specimen of it tried on. From a momentary glimpse I hare
seen of one (brought over to London by one of the exiles of June) it
strikes me as very like the old cap of º turned inside out, with a
new trimming. Somebody in France must have the famous wind-cap of
KING OLAUs of Norway, of which we are told, that when he put it
on, all winds blew as he listed, and the most dreadful tempests and
storms prevailed, The gentleman who has this headdress in his pos-
session has certainly been too fond of trying it on for the last two years
or so. But, we repeat it, these are not the sort of articles for English
Wearing.
Again, France has helped very much to perpetuate the reign of the
chimney-pot. Had, we been left to the English beaver, not all the
industry of the whole beaver community could have kept its hat above
water. It was positively too hot and heavy, and dear, to be tolerated
even by conservative Englishmen. But in stept the Frenchman, so
clever at giving a new forme to an old fond, ...” invented the French
yelvet hat, a lighter, cheaper, and altogether more wearable shape of
the old nuisance, and we continued to wear the chimney-pot in its
French fashion.
It is to France also that we owe the Gibus or spring-hat. Here was
another ingenious attempt of our inventive neighbours to reconcile the
irreconcileable—to make a hat, which, while a chimney-pot on the head,
should become a soup-plate in the hand, and which thus ventured where
the British beaver never could have thrust itself, into routs and balls,
and under chairs of public dinners, and in the pits of theatres. These
two inventions, we say, have been most injurious to society. They
Were atives of an evil, which but for them must have been swept
away long ago. They were the Reform which has staved off for a time
an inevitable and wholesome Revolution.
For these reasons I determined to avoid France, and took the steamer
to Ostend, with the intention of º by Germany to º
In Belgium I found evidences that even here the days of the chimney-
K. were numbered. Even imitative Belgium has pronounced for felt.
o great amount of taste is displayed in the insurrectionary head-pieces
as yet. , The sugar-loaf form is extensively prevalent; but the brims
loudly demand extension. There is, however, a disposition to recur to
the old form in the new material, which we must describe as re-actionary.
It is the effete monarchy of the chimney-pot attempting insidiously
to re-establish itself under the shelter of the social wide-awake. But
there are not wanting those who are sternly bent on shaking off every
vestige of the doomed cylinder—that Bourbon of hats, which never seems
to learn anything or to forget anything. I noticed with pleasure, in the
this Island. Such a hat can never take root in
crown, while narrow-mindedness has clipped three cantles out of the
brim, and formalism has turned up the edges, till, it now, resembles
nothing but a triangle of spouting set round a blackjelly-mould—taking
up a great deal of room, but casting no breadth of shade—wide as the
pretensions of the Church of Rome, but shallow as her foundations in
- land, any more
than the broad-brimmed, stiff-crowned abominations of FATHER NEw-
MAN’s Oratorians. - - - -
On the whole, I saw little in Belgium to recommend for direct imita-
tion in the new hat era which I trust is dawning for Great Britain.
There was an evident disposition in hats, as in books, towards the
contrefacon Belge, and the servile reproduction of French originals had
obviously cramped all free development of the hat of the Netherlands.
Still, the Belgian hat, though not yet wide awake, is struggling to throw
off its nap, and I see that here also new ideas in head-coverings are
striving to express themselves. My German observations I reserve for
a future communication.
THE LORD.MAYOR'S SHOW.
“MR. Punch, - - - -
“THE new Lord Mayor has reformed his show, bringing it up
to the intelligence of the times. He has a camel, an elephant, *:
(not railway), and so forth. Why he has omitted the º e
perhaps can answer to his midnight º: But why he has left me
out from the procession, it is impossible for human ingenuity to invent
an excuse. Therefore, let him answer to the Corporation of London
why, in the reformed procession, he has omitted the presence of,
“Yours, Mr. Punch,
“A LIVELY (BUT INDIGNANT) TURTLE:
“P.S.–Indeed, half-a-dozen of us, harnessed to a shell chariot, (M.R.
WEBSTER, of the Haymarket, would, with his customary benignity,
have lent the article,) must have had a very pretty effect, drawing
the slowest Alderman of the Corporation. There would also have been
a significance in the crawling pace of the turtle, illustrative of the pro-
gress of Smithfield reform in the City.
“P.S. No. 2.-Though we, turtle, are left out of the procession, I
suppose we shall be found in the tureens.”
TALENT WILL MAKE A NAME.
It is a somewhat remarkable fact, that whenever native talent tries
to make a name, it begins by making a foreign one. Through even the
humblest walks of the drama, we find JEFFERIES expanding into
JEFFERINI, the SILVER family Romanising themselves into the SILVANI,
and one REDISH-a suburban mimic, or country clown”—flourishing
away in the tea-gardens and tavern bills as Mons. REDISHA. We
almost wonder that the infection has not spread from the musical part
of the profession, in which it pervades the very highest ranks, to the
corresponding point of the dramatic world; in which case we should
find MACREApy advertised as SIGNOR FAR PRONTo, and MR.
}. announced as SIGNOR DIRITTO, in the Haymarket and Adelphi
play-blilS.
}. was with some surprise we learned the other day that the DISTIN
family, who have become distin-guished for their trumpet performances,
and who announce themselves as Frenchmen, by the aid of a Monsieur
prefixed to each of their names, are in fact, all Englishmen; and indeed,
that though wishing to be mistaken for foreigners when playing on
their Saxhorns, they have, all of them, the real Sax-horn blood in their
Well].S. -

THE DESTRUCTION OF WESTMINSTER HALL. JENKINS FOR ATHOLL ||
(Being a Legal Lament for “Cras Animarum.”) MR. JENKINs is a gentleman who follows his leader. That is to
oUNTY-Courts BILL came down like a wolf
on the fold
And the agency houses were savage and sold;
And in the Exchequer, the Pleas, and Q. B.,
Was one declaration where ten used to be.
Like prize cauliflowers, in the garden so
green,
The wigs of the leaders last “cras: an,”
were seen, -
Like the same eauliflowers, when a blight
hath come down,
Those i. on this “cras: an ,” look rusty
and
For MR. FrtzRoy's County Courts Bill hath
past,
Tespite of JohnJERVIs, and lawyers aghast;
And the hearts of sharp-practice attorneys waxed chill,
As their clients fell off, and their practice stood still.
There sits the Q.C. at his table so wide, ..
But on it no briefs with red tape neatly tied,
And his parchment-hued cheek turneth white as his shirt,
As he thinks what he’ll come to, now law’s cheap as dirt.
And there frets the Clerk, discontented and pale,
With no half-a-crown now paid down on the nail.
The Courts are all silent, the judges all yawn,
O'er demurrers unargued and pleadings undrawn.
And the Westminster ushers are loud in their wail,
There’s no motion of course in the sad Court of Bail;
And the cause of dear law, by attorneys adored,
Thank the new County Courts Bill, hath gone by the board'
- - - -
TAKING THE NONSENSUS OF THE COUNTRY.
To the Government falls the duty of taking the census of the
country, but it is the peculiar province of Punch to take the nonsensus
of England. As we look around us, we cannot help fearing that when
the returns come to be published, the latter will fºr . in amount
the former.
First of all, there are the Houses of Parliament, both old and new.
In the old House of Commons sit some 658 members, who represent
the collective wisdom of the country. We can scarcely tell whether
this term, “Collective Wisdom,” applies to the members themselves, or
to the persons who sent them there. If the former, it says but little
for the amount of wisdom in the country; and if the latter, it says still
less; for what must those persons be themselves when they select such
pºor specimens to represent them. But, in either case, the old House
of ºn. is fairly entitled to figure at the head of the Nonsensus of
Fº -
. The new House of Commons promises to claim the same proud dis-
tinction, for what can we say of a House that is wanted to hold upwards
of 500 members, and will i, accommodate half that number, unless we
murmur an expression of wonder how, in the name of Nonsense, such a
House came to be erected at all?—an expression which at once would
introduce the new Houses of Parliament within the limits of the Non-
sensus of the country.
Smithfield Market will also figure in the returns; for a market to be
placed in the centre of a large capital, where it can only be productive
of obstructions, nuisances, accidents, and deaths, is such an arrant piece
of nonsense, as could hardly find a place anywhere else but in the Non-
sensus of England.
From Smithfield Market to the City Corporation is a natural jump
for, it is the sticks of the one who uphold the sticks of the other, an
º would puzzle a greater judge than we profess to be, to decide
which was the greater piece of nonsense of the two? But for ages past,
aldermen and common-councilmen have been known for their extreme
love of talking nonsense, and, therefore, it would be an act of great in:
justice to omit their names on the present occasion. The claims of
SIR PETER LAURIE will be particularly attended to, in a document
that addresses itself exclusively to nonsense.
It is not necessary to particularise any more names just at present.
We are busy collecting evidence in every institution, in every court, in
eyery office, in every vestry, in every tap-room, in every nonsensical
little corner in the kingdom, and we are sure that when the astounding
result is laid before our readers, that they will scarcely believe their
eyes when they see what a tremendous amount of nonsense there exists
in England! We can safely declare that the Nonsensus of 1851 will be
say, the Morning Post's leading article of any given day, is generally an
attack—very dull and tiresome—on one which, appeared in the Times
the day before.
Last Friday, however, MR. JENKINs thought fit to honour Mr. Punch
as well as the Times, with his abusive observations. Both of us have
had the misfortune to offend MR. J.ENKINs by the line we have taken
in reference to the closure of Glen Tilt, by the Duke of ATHoll, in
whose service we presume he is. And yet by MR. JENKINs's own .
showing, our offence should be a light one against his master—if the
DUKE of ATHOLL is his master, and the subjoined piece of writing is
not from the pen of the Duke himself:—
“The ownership of this land is maintained by the Duke to be as exclusive as his
Grace's property in his own drawing-room—in the coat which he wears on his back—
or the kilton which the Times and Punch concentrate their facetiousness.”
MR. JENKINs's veneration for his master's wardrobe would, seem to
be extreme, to judge from the indignation he expresses at the Ducal
kilt lºs been held up to ridicule. But then, to be sure, the Duke
was in lu.
Great stress is laid by MR. JENKINs on the alleged fact that the
stion of the public's right of way through Glen Tilt is yet undecided.
ſe don't care a button-abutton with the ATHoLL crest upon it—for
that. JENKINs himself, says—shuddering, of course, at making the
hypothetical admission—
“The Duke of Atholl, may have acted selfishly, or unwisely, or unadvisedly,
but”— &c. &c. &c.
May, JENKINs? may, he has—we know not, May. And the appro-
priate emblem of selfishness is a small creature of the canine species,
and there is no harm in drawing it; no, nor in adding to the sketch a
Flunkey, set to wash the little animal; which would do for the figure
of Servility, MR. JENKINs.
But although we concentrated our facetiousness, on the DUKE OF
ATHOLL's kilt, a cry had been raised against him, and, says JENKINs,
“The cry was taken up by the scurrilous prints which disgrace our press; the
subject of the libel started in the Times was abused, caricatured, and vilified with every
species of malice.”
Further, complains JENKINs, although it has not been settled that
the Duke has the legal right to shut up Glen Tilt-
“Foul abuse and vile caricature continue uncorrected aud unchecked.”
JENKINs, if Mr. Punch were the owner of Glen Tilt, and were to
close it against the traveller, whether legally or illegally, Mr. Punch
would be a curmudgeon, and would deserve to be drawn and described
in his true character.
You are not much to be tulated, JENRTNs, on having exchanged
the plush for the plaid. Best keep to cleaning the DURE of ATHOLL’s
boots; and leave his fame alone.
BACON'S NEW BRAZEN HEAD.
IN the sincerest spirit of penitence, we beg pardon of the publishing
world of America, whom we have from time to time criticised in what
we now feel to be a harsh and uncharitable spirit, for their wholesale
conveyance of English books to their own iri and advantage. The
REv. DR. Bacon, an American, at the Educational Conference, held at
Manchester, has put the matter in a true and startling light, American
booksellers, by printing English books, only show their intense admira-
tion of the commodity. The boa-constrictor, that gorges his half-dozen
rabbits, merely manifests a complimentary taste for rabbits. But hear
Parson BAcon, of the Brazen Head–
“The credit of having their books printed on the other side the Atlantic helps the
sale of a book at home. There is another of your writers, M AcAULAY. I believe he
has more admirers, that there are more who }. read his writings with rapture in
America, though it is understood he is no great admirer of the American people, than
here. How many copies of his last work have been printed in the United States ?
Tens of thousands? No. You may count them by hundreds of thousands ! (Hear, hear.)
We repeat it; we are more than satisfied; we are confounded by the
arguments of the modern Roger. How large, too, is their application'
A pickpocket twitches your Bandana from your poke. Ought you to
cry “Stop Thief,” if the knave be detected; or, if you know your loss,
when the thief—that is, the abstractor—has made clear off with your
goods, ought you to visit that man with amathema, with uncharitable
thoughts? 'Certainly not; for know, that MR. JAMEs TwitchER, the
possessor of your Bandana, has a great admiration for the style of
the article; its elegant pattern and vivid colour have; moreover, found
many admirers in the Minories or in Field Lane. Your stolen hand-
kerchief, is highly praised, and , you ought to be correspondingly
delighted. Again, should you lay down your gold spectacles on a coffee-
room table, and should they, perchance, be carried off; consider the
loss as the highest, personal attention. The gentleman who takes your
spectacles feels it impossible to do otherwise—the gold is so pure; so
touchingly seductive. You are robbed, but how you are complimented
in every way worthy of the country.
in that very act of thieving !

PUSEYITE COSMETICS. THE “ GOOD " BUTLER,
To PUSEYITE CLERGYMEN.—Under the patronage of the LADY to the Forlorn Hope Monument to the good
ABBESs and SISTERs of the Convent of the Belgravians, and of the
FATHER SUPERIOR of the Monastery of Pimlico, with the BRETHREN
of that Establishment.—Mr. Punch begs to offer his PATENT EccLE-
SIASTICAL ACHRQMATICON, or PALLEFACIENT FLUID, for blanching the
CoMPLEXION, and imparting to the FACE that delicate PALLOR which
is the recognised indication of severe Thought and Study. Also his
MACERATIVE ELIXIR, or AscETIC SoLUTION, for the ATTENUATION of
the FRAME, warranted to reduce the stoutest proportions to the most
interesting slenderness, and produce, in the space of a few days, a
personal appearance not to be distinguished from the results of years of
Abstinence. A few doses will occasion such a wasting of the cheeks
as to render the exertion of sucking them in quite superfluous.
Mr. Punch can also confidently recommend his ILLUMINATIVE DROPs
for communicating that peculiar GLow to the EYE which is the natural
result of enthusiasm exalted by frequent vigils, meditations, &c. These
infallible specifics will confer on an Oxford graduate all, the external
characteristics of a young priest from Maynooth, and enable him, how-
eWer º and rosy before using them, to pass easily, in a short time,
for a zealous Roman ecclesiastic. Persons, desirous of obtaining, a
sanctified appearance, as soon and with as little trouble as possible
should have instant recourse to these preparations, which are to be ha
genuine only of Punch and Son, 85, Fleet Street, and at the Depositories
attached to the Anglican monastic establishments in Pimlico and Bel-
gravia; where may be likewise had
PUNCH's CLERICAL DEPILATORY, SHAVING soap,
which will materially facilitate the proceeding of taking the tonsure by
sacrificing the whiskers, a step-contrary to what was of late the
fashion-so necessary in order to become a popular Clergyman among
the Ladies of Belgravia.
N.B. The ACHROMATICON will effectually eradicate the stains of port,
or any other wine, from the face and nose.

WHAT’S TO BECOME OF WESTMINSTER HALLP
IT will soon be a very serious question, what is to become of West-
minster Hall? It would be little better than letting it stand empty, to
devote it exclusively to the Courts of Law and Equity, for such is the
decrease of business, that there will soon be no occasion for any sittings
whatever, as the whole work of the day may be got through standing,
without its being worth the while of their lordships to take a seat at
all. MR. BRIEFLEss, who adheres stoutly to the old institutions of the
country, has commenced, in default of regular instructions, the desperate
practice of instructing himself, and is continually sending in imaginary
motion papers to the usher, in which DoE is computed to owe so many
pounds to ROE.
Once or twice, MR. BRIEFLEss has burst out somewhat eloquently in
the respectable but rather superfluous character of amicus curiae, by
suggesting the Pºi up or letting down of a blind; and the other
day, in defiance of all professional usage, he rushed into one of the
Equity Courts, and joined in helping Counsel to take a decree in some
suit in which he was not at all concerned. -
Poor DUNUP goes the Bloomsbury and Brompton circuits, where he
hopes to lead at the County Court bars of those salubrious and .
litigious suburbs; but hitherto he is understood not to have cleare
Cabs.
It is expected that a large emigration will take place from West-
minster Hall to the precincts, and that the travelling barristers, or blue-
bagmen, will grow into a class as numerous as the commercial bagmen
themselves.
Should this event occur, Westminster Hall will be almost emptied,
and as it will only be required for the administration of the law during
a few minutes each day in term time, it will become a question to what
use such a magnificent building can be conveniently turned. JULLIEN,
it is said, has had his eye upon it for his Promenade Concerts; or
perhaps a Panorama of a Chancery Suit, which would rival all other
panoramas in length, would be an exhibition most appropriate to the
place, and would also serve as a record of that which promises very
soon to become a “thing of the past.”
Hale, Archdeacon-Well Met.
ARCHPRACON HALE has addressed a spirited letter to the clergy of
the Archdeaconry of London, in reference to the papal aggression.
We regret to learn from it that the reverend gentleman has been
labouring under indisposition; but we hope that is now rºot only
HALF but hearty, like the tone of his epistle,_the pluck of which is
singular, whatever may be the preferment of the writer.
MR.INIONs, i.
DUKE of CAMBRIDGE (through the columns of Punch)#. his fººd
wishes to MR. PAUL, butler to MR. HolroRD, of the Regent’s Park.
MR. INIONs, as Secretary to the above Monument, has read with
some alarm, the report of an intention to present MR. PAUL with a
testimonial, commemorative of his valour in the defence of his em:
ployer's house; and further, and pºtiºusly, of his aiming and firing at
the head of the burglar in the bush. -
MR. INIONs has, he hopes, a proper respect for the good behaviour
of MR. PAUL; but MR. I. puts it to MR.P. whether any attempt at the
present time, to reward him with a testimonial, may not divert the
stream of charity now it is hoped beginning to, set in towards the
Cambridge. Testimonial; or, in Fº words, whether the national
gratitude about to be paid to the memory of the late inhabitant of a
palace, may not in the most, untoward manner be dwindled into an
instalment for the immediate benefit of the present holder of a butler's
antry?
p MR. INIONs feels a lively conviction that the habits of MR. PAUL are
habits of inborn respect towards his betters, late Princes of the Blood,
and Royal Cousin at £12,000 per annum included. The Observer, in a
very affecting manner, remarks of MR.P., “it is not because he is a
servant that he, too, should not have a testimonial to his deserts; In
his case, at least, it has been proved that a livery may cover a hero in
humble life, who only lacks opportunity to be really a great man.”
it is proved intens of thousan of cases that alivery—red turned up
with *. or yellow as the regiment may be-may cover heroes. in
humble life; such heroes, for instance, who won Waterloº at a shilling
per day, making three shillings for the entire fight, but MR. I. º:
with the Editor of the Q. that that is no reason for sli º: the claims
of plush. No ; MR. I. hopes that, * up his head and laying his
hand upon his heart, he can ask for MR.P.--"Is he not a butler and a
brother?” Nevertheless, MR. I. has his duties to fulfil; and he must
—even to MR.P. himself-protest against any Pantry Testimonial, until
the Palace Testimonial s be put upon assure a ground as an archi-
tect and bricks-and-mortar can fix it.
When the Cambridge Monument is up—a monument, large enough
to characterise, the universal philanthropy of a man, who gave eve
minute of his life to the .#. of his species—for it is too we
known to be here insisted upon that the º owARD never slept but
with one eye at a time, that the claims of his fellow-creatures might
be always visible to him—when the monument is up, in its univers
philanthropy, such monument will inevitably require a builer. Indeed,
cooks, butlers, and waiters, are inextricably woven in with the memory
of the Good DUKE or CAMBRIDGE; therefore, it will afford MR. INIONS
very great delight to forward the claims of MR. PAUL, as Perpetual
Butler to the čº. Forlorn Hope; MR. P. being permitted, in
memory of his heroism—in like manner as the Peninsular Hero wears a
medal—to be decorated at the button-hole with a silver corkscrew. .
As MR. PAUL will no doubt see the propriety of waiving any claims
he may possess to a Testimonial in deference to the prior claims of a
Duke of the Royal Blood, MR. INIONs will thank M.R. PAUL to forward
to him (MR. I.), and that without delay, any money, or moneys that, un-
thinking persons may, in the ignorance of their liberality, forward to
MR. PAUi, wherewith to purchase any trifle for himself.

CHEAP GAS, AND WHY NOT CHEAP WATER.?
Now that we stand a tolerable chance of getting cheap gas, we think
a stir ought to be made to get us cheap water also. The new City
Gas Company, by putting its pipes into the ground, has put out the
pipes of the old º and we do not see why the water com-
panies should not be subjected to the same sort of competition. Light
and cleanliness being both necessary for the preservation of health, we
would ask why economy should not visit our cisterns as well as our gas-
meters? If we were consulted as to what would be a fair price for the
water at present laid on, we should say that it ought, at all events, to
be “as cheap as dirt,” which is the article it bears the closest re-
semblance to. The only advantage to be gained by the present water
supply is the chance of a fish occasionally being included in our bargain
with the Company; but as the fish cannot notify his arrival, he often
dies in the cistern before his visit is known, and we see nothing of him
till his bones, forcing their way through the tap, come up to us un-
expectedly in the toast-and-water, or the tea-urn.

WESTMINSTER HALL IN MOURNING.
THE Extension of the County Courts jurisdiction has
produced a perfect panic among the barristers, who
are undergoing a thorough famine of fees. The unfor-
tunate dogs of juniors look up imploringly in the hope
of having a bone of contention thrown among them; but
there is really nothing forthcoming to satisfy their
forensic cravings. The other day, we entered West-
minster Hall, and found there had been nothing dis-
tributed among the hu bar, but a few wretched
rules absolute, one of which was in the mouth of one
who had been accustomed to more sumptuous fare; and
in the Exchequer we perceived a silk gownsman lazily
“mumbling the bones” of a motion of course.
The utters talk of utter starvation as inevitable; and
there has been something said about dividing equally the
little that is left, as jã be the case in shipwreck with
a scarcity of provisions; and it is urged that the legal
craft may be looked upon as reduced to that sad con-
dition. A desperate proposal has been made, that the
laws of motion should be removable by certiorari into
the Queen's Bench, for the purpose of being there
administered; for otherwise, it is to be feared, that there
| will be neither law nor motion to be met with in that
august tribunal. It is expected that many of the bar
will emigrate into the County Court districts, and that
the congestion, which has, so long existed in West-
minster Hall will be cured, by a more equal distribution
of the forensic circulation, which has hitherto been so
much confined to one spot, where there has been a
deficiency of action.
A Solecism to Slaveholders.

THE POPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EXHIBITION
OF 1851.
A subject that is now exciting very general attention is, the contri-
bution evidently designed by Pio NoNo for the Exhibition of the Industry
of All Nations in 1851; and as all nations are included, the Pope
imagines that the produce of a decided halluci-nation will not be objected
to. The specimen of Roman manufacture will consist of a Cardinal,
carried to such an extraordinary length as to amount to a cloak, and far
to exceed the bounds of a mere visite, to which Papal manufactures have
been understood to be hitherto limited. The attempt to introduce the
Cardinal into this country is a bold experiment; and it is probable that
certain duties, proving the Cardinal to be an offence against the
Customs of this country, will cause the authorities to regard it in the
light of a prohibited article. The Cardinal, which is, no doubt, a very
ingenious contrivance, is the result of a web that has been for some
time weaving, and the manufacture in Rome has been greatly encouraged
by the knowledge that a vast quantity of yarn of the same sort has been
pºn, and very warmly patronised in England, where it has become
“the fashion,” particularly among some of the weak-minded females in
the neighbourhood of Belgravia. The Cardinal is intended eventually to
supersede altogether Bishop's sleeves, which have not for some time
been so popular as they would assuredly become if the material were of
a closer texture, and were not so liable to split as it has been known to
do in some recent cases, for it is impossible that the very richest and
finest material will maintain its repute if it will not hold together. The
manufacture employed in making the Cardinal is, on the contrary, all of
a piece, and if there are any differences, they are fine-drawn so cleverly,
that no division is perceptible;, whereas the Bishop's sleeves present
i. disagreements painful to the eye, and offensive to the taste and
Judgment.
... We should be sorry to see the Popish manufacture brought regularly
into this country; but if such a calamity should occur, it would be easy
to point to the shoulders the Cardinal ought to be put upon.

A SHOW UP FOR THE AMERICAN SHOWMAN.
Even the American press, ashamed at last at the figure cut by the
Model Republic, in its recent sacrifice of good sense at the shrine of
BARNUM-who seems to be the impersonation of Gammon and Mammon
combined—has lately taken to showing up the showman, but, not until
his object has been pretty well attained. In order to put the Americans
on their guard against being betrayed into another disgraceful exhi-
bition of the same folly which they have lately been guilty of, in allowing
the flame of their enthusiasm to be raised to the highest pitch by
BARNUM's puff, we beg leave to intimate to them that a monster piece
of humbug is in preparation to succeed poor JENNY LIND, when the
Showman has got all he possibly can, by converting her, as he has done,
into an “alarming sacrifice.”
We have heardſon somewhat good authority that BARNUM has given
orders in this country for the manufacture of a Sea-Serpent, complete
with scales, on a scale of magnitude never surpassed, and several
hundred feather dressers are already employed upon a marvellous head-
dress, intended to be worn as a crest by the monster when completed.
The body, it is said, has been *†† to a large gutta percha house,
and the fins have been placed in the hands of one of the cleverest horse
hair workers in England, with instructions to spare no expense in
the production of an article, which for size and fineness of texture, shall
surpass any natural curiosity ever yet exhibited.
he ivory trade has received an impetus, in consequence of an order
for a set of teeth, en suite, with the other parts of the Sea Serpent;
and a celebrated artist has, it is said, received a liberal commission to
. of outlay-an appropriate tail. The Sea Serpent,
when complete, will be several acres in length; it is understood that it
! be removed from this country by the process of towing, and its
arrival in New York will add probability to the story, intended to be
given out, of its having been caught on the voyage.

LORD HOWDEN AND THE MADRID BULL-FIGHTS.
THE celebrated MonTEs, bullfighter at Madrid, having at the request
of our Ambassador, furnished him with the complete set of weapons of
a matador and others, with the bull-slayers' costumes to boot, LoRD
How DEN addressed to SENOR MonTEs a letter, of which we exclu-
sively subjoin a faithful copy:—
“ILLUSTRIous SENOR,-With the profoundest sense of obligation, I
have to acknowledge at your hands, a complete set of weapons, with
the due variety of costume º: and worn in Spain at the Fiesta
de Toros, the feast of the Bulls—the term ‘Bull-fight,’ as I am proud
to understand, being denominated vulgar.
“Most Illustrious Seijor, Your gifts could not have been bestowed at
a happier moment. I shall immediately dispatch them by a ship of war,
that they may be laid at the feet of HER MAJESTY, the Queen of
England and Defender of the Faith, who, in full council will, I doubt
not, entrust the weapons to those hands the best knit, and the best
skilled to use them.
- “Most Illustrious Señor,<It may have met your distinguished ear, that
a ...'. the most tremendous bull yet made—has very recently
appeared in England: a Bull of a glaring, yet sinister gaze; of horns of
portentous size and curve; with a roar that has made itself heard
throughout Great Britain; and, finally, a Bull of a magnitude of body,
that threatens—with the blight of its shadow—to cover at least
thirteen cities and towns of the United Empire. This Bull is not from
the valleys of the Jarana, but from the Chamber of the Vatican; not
fed on green pastures, but f. with old, rotten, jaundiced parchment.
Now this huge, blatant is doomed. The people of England shout
for their Fiesta de Toros—they will have an end put to the Roman Bull;
die he must; and there can be no doubt that the honour of sacrificing
the beast will be awarded to s JAGQ BLOOMFIELDos, of Fulhamos;
a matador of distinguished subtlety; of wonderful cunning at fence,
and (when he likes) strength of resolution; a brother matador—
Illustrious Señor—who, will strike the bull in the very, spinal nick,
albeit, to judge ordinarily of the man, you would scarcely think him
capable of the slaughter of a guinea-pig.
“And, therefore, Illustrious Señor, in the name of my imperial mistress,
I again thank you for your timely presents. The Bullfight will, I have
no doubt, take place in Smithfield; and great will be the rapture of the
people when they behold QARLos JAGo, in his light dress of lawn,
mounted on the high horse, in his right hand firmly holding—as though
it grew out of his fist—his long Toledan blade; and in the left waving
the muleta, or red flag, to distract and madden the Bull, and so to spit
him at the lucky minute.
“You shall have the earliest, and I trust best account, of the Fiesta,
with the precisest relation of the feats of the matador of Fulhamos,
CARLOS JAGO BLOOMFIELDos. In the meantime, illustrious Señor,
vouchsafe to accept the assurance of my consideration.

PUNCH'S RAILWAY TRAVELLER.
To Mr. Punch.
“SIR,--I have not lately troubled you with a line, as I have not
been troubled with a line myself until a day or two ago, when I
took an afternoon’s trip on the North Western. The fact is, I got so
cramped on my last journey that I have had a complaint in my legs,
... prevented me from having a fresh complaint on my hands to
send to you until the recent trip I have already spoken of. There
being no third-class carriage attached to the train, I was compelled to
put up with the second-class, and suffered the inconvenience of the
inferiority of the latter to the former; for, as the Directors are com-
pelled to put lights in the third-class carriages, and not in the second,
they leave the º travelling by the second-class, completely in the
§: which I am determined they shall be no longer, if you will
enlighten them through your columns.
“My excursion was taken in the company of some odd looking
persons with mustachios, whom I never saw before, and, in fact, never
saw at all after I once entered the carriage with them, for we were in
total darkness all the while; and I should certainly never wish to see
my fellow-travellers again, unless I thought there might be some chance
y their returning me my pocket-handkerchief at our next interview.
A lady in the same carriage, who had also been quite in the dark during
the journey, was unpleasantly enlightened, under the gas lamp on the
plat !. by the discovery that her purse was missing.
“Now, Sir, I would beg leave to suggest that if the Directors will
not of their own accord, and cannot be compelled to put lights in their
second-class carriages, incy might at least allow lanthorns to be sold at
the stations, or fix sconces inside the vehicles, so that the traveller
might set up a candle, or even a rushlight, of his own, according to the
extent of his means, should he prefer that course to the uncomfortable
and frequently expensive obscurity which he is doomed to by the
present arrangement. “You R RAILWAY TRAVELLER.”
MR. PUNCH'S TRIBUTE TO SOYER.
ALEXIS SoYER!!
How, I admire you!—You appear to me to be the only man
of our time who has adequately comprehended the mission of the cook.
In your hands the casserole becomes eloquent, and the marmiton utters
its moral. SHAKSPEARE tells us of the
—"tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones”—
and shall the dinner-table be mute 2—shall there be no voice in a pièce
de resistance, no revelation in a relevé substantielle? You have seized
this want, and in your hands every plat has its point, every entremet
its epigram.
I was an honoured guest at MR. LUMLEY’s fete, last season. You
presided over the culinary part of the entertainment; you pleased the
º and you appeased the appetites of 800 guests. You had only four
ys' notice. In your own simple, but sublime words, “C’etait
|impossible, mais cest fait ’’’
remember that luncheon with gratitude. . With your own hands
you pointed out to me a table, and attended to my wants. What
charming invention was there exhibited by you that day ! The fête was
in honour of MEssRs. ScKIBE and HALívy. Do you remember—or
do these inventions pass from your mind like the inspirations of a
SHAKSPEARE-given to the world carelessly; as treasures prodigally
given from a mind of exhaustless invention? - -
But if you have forgotten, I cannot forget. Indeed I write with
the carte *: me. That Round of Beef & la MAGNA CHARTA.!.
What a thought in that!. It is the very philosophy of English º
put into the compass of a dish. Plain, solid, somewhat heavy, cut-and-
come-again, satisfactory. Such was that round of beef, happily
illustrating the legislative bulwark of British liberties.
With what grace you passed from history to art. Your entremets
were criticisms, only more palatable. There were your “Aiguilettes de
petit poussins à la Scribe.” Is it possible to characterise better the
pointed turns and epigrammatic sallies of the accomplished dramatist,
than by “Aiguilettes,” “little needles?” Then your “Escaloppes de
petites soles à la SoNTAG,” crisp, delicate, yet little, exactly like the
vocalisation of that charming artist. Then your centre piece—at once
a compliment—a satire—and a criticism—
“The Croustade SHAKSPERIENNE & la HALÉvy-SCRIBE Tempesta /*
The shattered ship in a pain d'Espagne, with the characters of the
Tempest in sugar, gaudily coloured, tossed by a sea of trifle, and stranded
on a reef of bon-bons—illustrating, how happily, the treatment that the
illustrious WILLIAM had received at the hands of Messrs Scame and
HALEVY-the guests of the day. -
The Nº. ese princes were there, You felt their nationality, and
symbolised it, at once, how gracefully! in a
“Turban d’Escaloppes Aspic de Chevreuil & la Nepaul.”
The race is there, and the man. The “turban.” of Qrientalism, the
“ aspic” of Eastern treachery—the “chrevreuil,” symbolising the light-
mess and agility, the deer-like step of the illustrious stranger.
This tribute comes late; but my admiration has been revived by the
bill of fare for the York Meeting of the Mayors, over which I have just
been shedding tears of mingled admiration and appetite.
Here, again, I find combined the eful courtier, the profound
satirist, and the accomplished archico ogist. To say nothing of the
colossal conception of a dinner, with its trente-deur Potages, trente-deur
Poissons, trente-deur Flancs, and quarante-huit Entrées in one course—
mark the appropriate invention that can create, à l'improvise, a
“Blanc de volaille à la York Minster.”
The bold and biting sarcasm that, at a dinner of Mayors, does not
shrink from uttering itself in an
“Ertravagance culinaire à la Alderman.”
The knowledge of antiquity that reproduces in the nineteenth century, a
“Paon a l’ancienne Rome garni d'ortolans.”
The courtier-like adulation that breathes from the sweetness of a
- “Créme de la Grande Bretagne à la PRINCE ALBERT.”
And the painter-like fancy that closes all with a
“Désert floréal a la Watteau.”
And so crowns the meal, as we crown thee, O SoYER, with flowers |
Shocking Case of Expected Cannibalism.
It is feared that LoRD GROSVENOR and the LoRD MAYOR, despite
the exertions of LEEKs, the Hon. Sec., to extract subscriptions from

THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW.
WE rose early on the 9th of November, having been awoke before
dawn by the ringing of the old LoRD MAYOR out, and the new LQRI)
MAYorin; and when we heard the E. ringing in our ears, we wished
we had the wringing of the ears of those who disturbed our slumbers.
Having made for the city, we repaired to the comfortable quarters of
MR. QUARTERMAN, at the Royal ork Hotel, in New Bridge Street;
and our host being accustomed to entertain the Ministers with white
bait, at his other hostelry, the Crown and Sceptre, at Greenwich, had
abated none of his usual courtesy in giving a reception to ourselves,
who are the recognised Ministers to the †: entertainment, improve-
ment, and enlightenment.
The procession having been advertised to start punctually at eleven,
we took our places on the elegant dais prepared for us at the window;
and we remained for some time on the tiptoe of our highlows and of
our expectations. The assurance offices opposite were filled with some
very pleasing specimens of modest assurance, in the crowds of ladies in
the balconies, who were looking at us, with evident admiration, from
over the way. . We were much gratified, also, by the sort of preliminary
procession that preceded the real one.
In the continuous stream we noticed several individuals smoking
short pipes, intended, no doubt, to represent the Calumet of Peace,
for Peace was to be one of the Great Guns of the Show; and among
these were scattered several persons with tressels and planks, inviting
people to pay for the privilege of standing upon forms, from which those
who stood on neither forms nor ceremonies occasionally, pushed them
off again, Lads came next with small ladders, and a variety of specu-
lators with boards of deal, but these got so shuffled about the pack in
all directions, that many a deal was lost in the confusion.
Not the least agreeable part of the show was the immense mass of
leased and good-humoured faces, which not only thronged the thorough-
ares, but replaced in the shop windows the “sacrifices,” the “look
here's,” the “all at one-and-nine's,” the “town-made kids,” the “double-
sewn gentlemanly superior dog,” and other labelled articles of London
merchandise. Every one seemed to be cheerfully disposed; and not
even a policeman lost his temper; but a playful poke in the ribs with
his truncheon was all that was needed when a polite request to “keep
back” ſailed of its usual efficiency.
At length it became evident that the real procession was approaching,
for a body of police being drawn up in Bridge Street, backed with
beautiful prolusion on to all the toes that happened to be too promi-
nent, while a few officers on horseback .. to clear the way by the
playful switching of the tails of the animals into the faces of the too
er among the multitude.
n a few minutes we caught sight of the Beadle of the Tallow
Chandlers, followed by the banners of the company, with or without its
appropriate motto of “Wir ea nostra coco.” After the officers of two
or three more companies, including the Clothmakers, who seemed some-
what in want of a little “extra drill,” the civic dignitaries made their
appearance, and among them the Remembrancer was the only one who
seemed intent on keeping up the allegory of his position, for he was
continually talking out of window to his coachman, as if the Remem.
brancer desired to refresh his servant's memory, and remind him where
to set down.
With the exception of the equipages of the Sheriffs, which were
on a scale of splendour equal to even this unprecedentedly grand occa-
sion, there was a particularly fly-like look about some of the carriages;
and we fancied we counted four or five functionaries in one vehicle,
which gave an uncomfortably plethoric look to some of the turns out.
Next came “The Aldermen who have passed the Chair,” and after
them, “The Aldermen who have not passed the Chair;” but among
the former there were some who appeared to be in that comfortable
state of obesity, that the process of passing the Chair must have been
one of considerable difficulty, unless the space allowed was exceedingly
liberal. It was easy to distinguish the footmen of the late from the foot-
men of the new Lord MAYOR, for the looks and liveries of the former
were alike faded, while there was a freshness and spirit in the lace and
the faces of the servants of the new potentate.
º to this point the LoRD MAYor's show had been “much as
usual,” but now the new features made their appearance, the man in
brass having given way to metal more attractive. First came PEACE
on a white charger, who seemed determined to let his fair rider have
no peace at all, for he kept bobbing his head up and down, and
striking PEACE with his milky plume, as if to throw it in her face, and
twit her with her display of the white feather. Not anticipating that
PEACE would have been seated on a war charger, our artist, whose
imagination is obliged to be always “a week in advance,” had placed
her on a “lively turtle,” and we have no doubt the civic authorities
will adopt the graceful idea next year; so that the illustration must
accepted as something a twelvemonth in advance, as showing how
PEACE ought to have been mounted.
We trust also, that by the 9th of November, 1851, PEACE will have
found a new pair of wings, for they were of an exceedingly woolly
description, and seemed to have been plucked from a far from “downy”
feather-bed. In the train of PEACE came the four Quarters of the World,
riding side by side; followed by the Horse of Europe, looking rather
restive—perhaps at the idea of the Bull of Rome; the Camel of Asia,
in compliment to whom “The Cam'els are coming” was struck #;
the band; the Elephant of Africa, who seemed to be suffering slightly
from an attack of his old enemy Elephantiasis; and two Deer of America,
who looked as if they had been Deer picked up cheap at Epping.
Next followed a horse with the attributes of Industry, represen
§ a beehive and a wisp of straw;, then the attributes of Art, em-
blemed by a portrait like those labelled “in this style 10s. 6d.” at any
cheap portrait painter's; then the attributes of Commerce, consisting of
a couple of .. chests; and, ultimately, the attributes of Manufac-
tures, exhibited in a small loom, and something between a pump and a
steam engine. Industry, Arts, Commerce, and Manufactures, would
seem to be in a bad way, if the above were appropriate specimens, but
the getters up of the spectacle were not to blame, for the truth is,
there had been a lamentable “falling off” in every department, the
“attributes”, having been falling off the horses' backs all the way
from Guildhall to Bridge Street. -
The grand point of the procession was a car containing four sailors
seated opposite BRITANNIA, behind whom was a globe, with HAPPINEss
rched at the top of it. We observed with much sympathy, that
#. having a severe cold in her head, was continually sneezing
on to BRITANNIA at her feet, who seemed by no means to relish the
sort of thing that HAPPINEss showered down upon her. In addition to
the other inconveniences to which HAPPINEss was exposed, the con-
triver of the car had forgotten to put springs to the hinder part, and É.
HAPPINEss had to try her utmost, while “holding on,” to keep from looking
the picture of misery. Fortunately the weather was fine, November
having suspended her fogs, in compliment to the liberal, exertions of
the civic authorities to give novelty to the LoRD MAYOR's Show, and
we are therefore spared the pain of describing HAPPINEss under an um-
brella in a shower of rain, or with a comforter round her throat to keep
out the damp, which, had LoRD MAYOR's Day looked as black as it
usually does, would have been an inevitable consequence. As it is, we
are very much afraid that PEACE, HAPPINEss, and BRITANNIA must all
have gone to bed with very bad colds, and we can fancy the trio with
their feet in warm water, and basins ofW.". before them, while the
banquet at Guildhall was proceeding. e must add, that the Show
was a vast improvement on former years; and as LoRD MAYORs'
Shows are now regarded as a part of our institutions, it is praiseworthy
to get them up in style, introduce new effects, and endeavour to give
them an allegorical—in the absence of any other—meaning.
Rather Over-Zealous.
We have recently heard of a piece of Protestant zeal, which, not-
withstanding all our heartiness in the cause, goes, in our opinion, a
little beyond discretion. It appears that a gentleman, who feels, an
honest indignation at the recent conduct of the Romish hierarch, has
refused to i. any longer with his butcher, for sending him a leg of
mutton with the Pope's eye in it.

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS PORTENTOUS.
THE attention of the public has been called to almost every peculiarity
relative to the Hippopotamus, but there is one important point in
reference to him which has been overlooked—rather unaccountably,
considering the time of year, when, owing to the dearth of more im-
portant news, there is a demand for extraordinary cabbages, and the
quotations of monstrous turnips are frequent in the papers. We allude
to a “Curious Coincidence,” which might have furnished a subject
for several lines, at—at least—a penny each. It is strange that no
ingenious journalist should have discovered any connexion between the
arrival of the Hippopotamus in this country, and the introduction of
the Papal Bull. In former times, the present from the Nile would
certainly have been deemed ominous of the trifle from the Tiber, and
uaint old AUBREY would no doubt have classed among his “Fatalities”
the fact that the importation of one monstrosity preceded by so little
that of the other.
STATISTICS OF GUY FAUX DAY.
The returns of specie taken by the juvenile population on last GUY
FAUx day are the largest ever known. The demand for old newspapers
for cocked hats exceeded all precedent, and it is calculated that fifty
thousand old journals were consumed in commemoration of old times.
The metropolis has always been divided into Guy Faux districts on the
5th of November, and a good Guy walk, which in other years has
§. an average of half-a-crown in copper, was, on the last 5th of
ovember, known to produce as much as four shillings in halfpenee, and
as much again in silver money, showing that the wealthier classes were
eager to support. Protestantism, even in the guise of Guys; men of
straw were never known to be at so large a premium; and ofd rags,
which had been previously dull at twopence a pound, went up to two-
pence-halfpenny on the morning of the 5th, and in the evening they
went up so i. that they never came down again.

PUNCH*S PENANCE,
Hough our ordinary mood is a
jovial one, we are not with-
out our moments of melan-
choly—all the more intense
from the height of cheerful-
ness from which we tumble.
Sometimes we impose this
wholesome sadness on our-
selves, but more often, we
do penance involuntarily—
finding ourselves in the white
sheet when we least expected
it, and renouncing the pomps,
vanities, and follies of the
world, when we had flattered
ourselves we were about to
enjoy them with peculiar
gusto.
We did such a penance on
- - Thursday night, last week—
in Drury Lane Theatre—at JULLIEN’s Bal Masque. It is impossible for
any monk of La Trappe to have passed a more melancholy night in his
|
cell, than Punch did in his box, at that joyous festivity. And he º |i,
to his surprise, most of the company doing penance like himself, an
assisting at the doleful ceremonial in the gravest and most solemn
manner.
Yes—we never remember to have witnessed a more mournful spec-
tacle than those ranges of boxes and gallery, filled to overflowing with
a set of respectable family parties, who looked on, for five mortal hours,
without a laugh, without a movement, without a sound, at the equally
staid and solemn scene below them. In the area of the theatre move
some five or six hundred persons of both sexes, many of them in fan.
tastic dresses, with sad faces (such of them as one could see), or sadder
masks, sometimes to brisker, sometimes to slower music. But whether
the orchestra indulged in the wildest polka, or the gentlest quadrille,
there was no change in the spirit of determined dreariness, with which
the dancers went about their work.
It is true there was here and there an indisereet foreigner, who, mis-
taking the character of the proceedings, occasionally indulged in an out.
burst of irreverent vivacity and unbecoming animal spirits, but these
misplaced demonstrations were quickly put down. Gaiety could no
more exist in that atmosphere than a mouse under an exhausted
receiver. There was one young man, apparently one of these misguided
foreigners, in the dress of a French Harlequin, who made many laborious
attempts at liveliness, but with the most flat and uniform failure.
When we left the melancholy scene, he was still at it, embracing a red
Indian, and whooping. But his attempts were discountenanced, and
though we admired his perseverance, we could not but smile at his
mistaken estimate of our countrymen. -
Altogether, we had a most salutary might of sad and solemn reflection,
and we were glad to see so many of our friends evidently availing them-
selves of the opportunity for the same purpose.

THE POST UPON DOGS OF WAR.
|
THE Post is wont, in its own profound way, to sum up the
events of the past, week. Every Monday a frivolous world is called
upon to pause, and to reflect upon the historical materials of the past
seven days. A very laudable custom this, and very eloquently vindicated
your golden-mouthed contemporary. Here is a beautiful passage from
“The Week” of the Post:-
“Now, in the 19th century, with half Europe tossed, rudderless, on the stormy waves
of revolutions, the slenderest threads only holding her struggling dogs of war.”
NEPTUNE on the waves, reining his horses, is a familiar picture; but
that half Europe should be rudderless on the billows, and with slender
threads holding struggling dogs, is a grand novelty. However, the
figure satisfactorily settles the breed of the dogs of war: they are
neither mastiffs, nor bloodhounds, nor French poodles, but, being reined
with thread to rudderless Europe, tossed on the waves, can be no other
than water-dogs.

Pope’s “Essay on MAN.”—This last edition of Pope's Essay has

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SHORT WAY WITH THE POPE'S PUPPETS.
To the RIGHT HON. LORD JoHN RUssFL.L., M.P.
My LoRD,
THE Pope, in his scarlet audacity, cuts up merry England like
a cake into thirteen slices, a Twelfth Cake with all the images—
giving a slice to one Cardinal and twelve Bishops. The Pope has
stretched out his crozier, and pulled the stray English sheep into his
fold. And the sheep shall be better fed with the old Watican wafers;
and shall bear on its scarlet wool the seal of the Fisherman's Ring.
Without knowing it, we are all of us the Pope's spiritual subjects; we
have gone over to him in our sleep : in our beds have been carried to
Rome, and are only now awakened to the change. Such are the glad
tidings cried by Doctor NEWMAN ; such the stirring trumpet-note of
the Cardinal of Westminster
And now there are meetings of Protestant divines ; there are ad-
dresses to the Bishop of LoNDoN ; and the Bishop's denunciations of
Papal supremacy come thawed to us in a reply, like the melted tones
long frozen in MUNCHAUSEN's trumpet. Protests have been issued;
the Pope pelted with all sorts of names; and every man and woman
exhorted to declare their unrelenting opposition to Rome—their indig-
nation at its insolence and its ingratitude.
My Lord, this is all very well; but we do not have meetings to
protest against the crimes of pickpockets. We do not gather together
to declare our uncompromising hostility to burglars; we do not avow
our hatred and i. of—and determination never, if we know
it, to take—a bad crown piece. No, my Lord. We pay for a police
to seize the pickpocket if possible, in the fact; we shoot a burglar,
though he may escape into a bush, and scream for mercy; and for the
tendered copper or pewter crown, we may either cut it in twain, and
give over the pieces to the utterer, or nail the pocket-piece inexorably
to the counter. Now, my Lord, in something after this fashion would
I deal with all Cardinals and Bishops appointed with hat, pallium, and
ring, to English counties. In some such way would I deal with the
iniquity of a Church that would pick the conscience of this Protestant
country—that would break into the house, and domineer at the fireside
of every Englishman—that would substitute for the Crown of England,
the rule and potency of the triple crown of triple brass of the withering,
man-destroying power of Rome. The way is brief and easy.
Let your Lordship draw up a small bill. A plain, unmistakeable
bill; with every line and clause as clear and defined as the bars of a
Smithfield gridiron. And let the bill run as follows, with as little
flourish as you may.
“AND BE IT ENACTED, That any person accepting of the Pope
OF ROME, or of any Pope, Cardinal, or Catholic Roman Bishop soever,
any Titular Jurisdiction as Cardinal, or Catholic Bishop, of any County,
City, or Township, of Protestant England, shall be adjudged guilty of
High Treason; and shall suffer the Penalty of High Treason as may be
adjudged in all Cases.
“AND FURTHER BE IT ENACTED, That the signing of any
Address, Mandate, Letter, Order, or Exhortation soever, signed by a
Catholic, as the Supreme Catholic Cardinal, or Bishop, of any County,
City, or Township, shall of itself be adjudged as Proof of the Crime of
High Treason against the Crown and Dignity of the Sovereign of these
Realms; and the doer thereof shall suffer the Penalty of High Treason,
as adjudged.”
Here, my Lord, are two little clauses; a Bill in the rough. Let it
be, on the meeting of Parliament, forthwith cut into an Act, and set—
the brightest jewel—in the Protestant crown of Protestant England.
And in making the crime above recited the crime of high treason, I
have no wish to bring back the days of the hurdle, the halter, the axe,
and the quartering-knife. But I have this desire ; a most lively wish,
that I would carry out by penal enactment. When a Roman Catholic
Pope-appointed Cardinal put on his scarlet hat, and called upon the
city of Westminster to do him, in the name of Rome, all spiritual
obedience, I would immediately seize such Cardinal, try him for High
Treason, and, on conviction, send him, in convict grey, to the antipodes.
The convicted Roman Catholic Bishop of Plymouth should know the
change of air breathed at the still-vexed Bermudas; and the Bishop of
Liverpool quaff the bitter waters of Norfolk Island.
The time has passed when we should protest in the old way
against the powers of the Pope of Rome. Our new mode of protest
should be delivered by twelve men in a box; our appeal—not to the
cºnscience of the Court of Rome, but to the jury of the Court of the
Old Bailey.
I remain, my Lord,
Your obedient servant and humble adviser,
398:190-44.

THE MUSEUM FLEA.
MR. T. HUDSON TURNER, in his Blue-Book evidence, on the condition
of the Reading-Room of the British Museum, says:
“There is a flea generated in that room that is larger than any to be found else-
where, except in the receiving-rooms of the workhouses.”
We think the Reading-room flea demands instant and most earnest
attention. We propose that the Antiquarian Society immediately sit
upon this flea. ...We moreover suggest to that learned body the pro-
priety of grappling with three questions bearing, as we conceive, very
closely upon the flea. Namely—
I. May not the flea be generated in certain books, even as mites are
generated in cheese?
II. May not the flea be the metempsychosis of some rich publisher, as
QURL or, Tosson ; doomed for awhile to jump the earth as a flea, and
further doomed to the Reading-room of the Museum, that the trans-
migrated bookseller may feed upon his old and customary human diet?
III. Ought not a well-authenticated Museum flea-bite to be sub-
mitted to the microscopic examination of ERAsmus Wilson, in order
that that distinguished dealer in skins might report upon the bite,
whether or not presenting proofs of being inflicted by the ordinary
weapons of a bookseller

ASTRONOMICAL EXAMINATION PAPER FOR THE
CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY.
BY PRIMATE CULLEN,
THE Sun is two yards in diameter;
It moves round the Earth;
It is made of bees' wax;
Its shape is triangular;
- It rises in the west, and sets in the east:
It is called the Sun, because it first made its appearance on a Sunday.
The Moon is half a yard in diameter;
It is cousin-german to the Sun;
It is made of green cheese;
Its shape is that of a square;
There is a man living in it whose name is Mooney.
It was called the Moon from the circumstance of its being first seen
on that day which is now known as Monday, but which is, properly
speaking, Moonday.
An old Saw newly Set.
WF learn from a curious article on Water, in the Quarterly Rerien,
that the Bagshot, sands catch (besides rain) 500 tons per acre per
annum of dew; which is one source of the exquisitely pure water }ſo-
º by the Board of Health for the future supply of London. The
Dirt, party in the City, however, are up in arms against the Board;
loudly denouncing their project as chimerical, and their pure water as a
yapid and unsavoury beverage. As it would be literally pure waste to
lavish clean water on palates so lamentably perverted, we would suggest
the propriety of retaining in the City a few tanks of sewage-mixed
Thames water, for the especial drinking of the “Defenders of the
Filth; ” with whom we are certainly not bound to share our sun-dis-
tilled supplies—unless, indeed, on the principle of giving a certain old
gentleman his dew.
THE CURRENCY IN CALIFORNIA.
CALIFoRNIA, according to the ſirerpool Times, now boasts a news-
paper, called the Californian Illustrated News. The price, says the
publisher, “to bring it within the reach of the poorest,” is only one
dollar a number. The Californian gold seems nothing to the Californian
paper.
Double-Sighted Sites.
AN advertisement announces that building-ground, for public or
other large buildings requiring two frontages, can be had in the neigh-
bourhood of the Houses of Parliament. We suppose, from the facility
of getting two frontages in the vicinity of the Legislature, that there
is something about the locality which renders it decidedly double-faced.
A GAME AT HOP-SCOTCH.
THE announcement of JULLIEN's Bal Masqué eontained the extra-
ordinary notification that no Panſaloons would be admitted. The im-
pression, naturally produced on our minds was that the costume was
intended to be all Caledonian, and that decorum would be not only
Scotch'd, but kilt.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LAMENT OF THE MAN IN BRASS.
“THE pot o' beer you ordered's here,” the nimble potboy said,
“It comes from round the corner; they’ve drawed it with an 'ead;
And here’s a pipe, if you would like to moisten of your clay,
But they said, without the money I mustn't come away.”
He lingered on the threshold, but the warrior heeded not,
Upon the board beside him untasted stood the pot;
The pipe lay there unlighted, unopened lay the screw, -
And the Man in Brass, in his cuirass, sat looking black and blue.
There gleams not now upon his brow the casque with nodding plume;
Instead of that, the humble hat o'ershades his gaze of gloom;
Against the board his warrior sword is sadly laid apart, , .
And his breast-plate falls and rises with the heaving of his heart.
-
He hath roused him up to answer the clamorous º s demand—
“Into my pocket, armed at point, I cannot put my hand;
Wait there without—I’ll pay the stout afore I leave the room.”
The boy is gone—and all ſº he speaks out in his gloom'
“”Tis the ninth morm of November—the LoRD MAYor's Day is here—
Instead of sitting by my stout, would I lay in my bier!
Up through the street yelept of Fleet e'en at this hour they pass—
But in the throng that ride along there is no Man in Brass.
In days gone by how proud was I, in º brass that brightly shone,
When to saddle-tree they lifted me, with many a heave and groan–
How, 'midst the jokes of City folks, all solemnly I rode,
Nor heeded laugh, nor small boys' chaff, as on my good steed trode.
My gallant steed, where art thou? In BATTY's stables drear
Art thou neighing for the rider who is sadly sitting here *
Or is thy proud heart chafing, as they yoke thee to the car
Of BRITANNIA, or some such stuff–the humbugs that they are P
There is a work—it's by one BURKE, I think I’ve heard folks say—
Which proves the days of chivalry for ever past ..'ſ,
But times of old had still a hold while in the Lord MAYor's Show
My brazen face retained a place—and now I’m forced to go.
The Common Councilmen, I feel, will rue it bye and bye,
When they find that BATTY's charges is so uncommon high;
For he's safe to send them in a bill that will their hearts appal,
For BRITANNIA, and the camels, and the elephants, and alſ.
And what's the British public, that they expect 'twill hail
A female in a petticoat, instead of males in mail?
For BRITANNIAs, unless it be on coppers, no one cares—
What's elephants to Aldermen, or camels to Lord Mayors ?
My curse upon the City and Corporation too
It’s little that I ever thought to them to bid adoo !
Was I not old and useless—and to old and use-
less thin - -
Ain't there always in the Council a majority that
clings?
It ain't no use! They’ve cooked my goose—what
can I do but die?
How can I live dishonoured, shunned, shut up,
and put by ?
But § the light of prophecy, in my last hour 1

That now the Man in Brass is gone, there’s more
a going to go.

“MR. PUNCH,

Ministers, are again meeting in Council; and
learning that the number of Punch is always laid
upon the table—no doubt for purposes of inspi-
ration-I address you that my long-standing
complaint may reach the ears and touch the
hearts of HER MAJESTY's Councillors.
“Sir-it is very true that we are threatened
by the Pope ; that John Bull has been disturbed
ill.i. pleasant pastures by the portentous scarlet

... It is very true that we are again threatened
with the renewal of the income-tax.
... But these matters are trifles in comparison
with an injustice that has, for years, gone on
increasing; and, unless stopt by statute, threatens
to carry disgust and confusion into every cellar.
Need I say, that I allude to the diminishing size
of what is jocosely called a quart wine bottle?
I am called a quart; and yet blow me, as a bottle,
if I hold more than an imperial pint. Now, why
should not a law determine the size of bottles
as it has already done that of pewter pots? I
ask this of Ministers, and am—for measures
not men— !

THE inhabitants of Regent Strect are very
anxious to get rid of their wooden pavement, and
to walk in the ways of their fathers, if those
ways could only be restored. The broken blocks
in the carriage way are so many stumbling-blocks

respect entertained for those who take after their
arents, the passengers are excessively disgusted
continually tumbling over so many chiº of
the old blocks. \

If it be true that the New. Cut *

KINDRED QUACKS.
I over HEARD two matrons grave, allied by close affinity,
(The name of one was PHYsic, and the other's was DivinITY.)
As they put their groans together, both so doleful and lugubrious:-
Says PHYSIC, “To unload the heart of grief, Ma'am, is salubrious:
Here am I, at my time of life, in this year of our deliverance;
My age gives me a right to look for some esteem and reverence.
#". I feel it is too true what everybody says to me,
Too many of my children are a shame and a disgrace to me.”
“Ah!” says DIVINITY, “my heart can suffer with another, Ma'am;
I’m sure I can well understand your feelings as a mother, Ma'am.
I’ve some, as well,—no doubt but what you’re perfectly aware on’t,
a alm,
Whose doings bring derision and discredit on their parent, Ma'am.”
“There are boys of mine,” says PHYSIC, “Ma’am, such silly fancies
nourishing, - - - -
As curing gout and stomach-ache by pawing and by flourishing.”
“Well,” says DIVINITY, “I’ve those who teach that Heaven's
eatitudes - -
Are to be earned by postures, genuflexions, bows, and attitudes.”
“My ºuis sons,” says PHYSIC, “some have turned hydro-
pathists;
Some taken up with mesmerism, or joined the homoeopathists.”
“Mine,” says DIVINITY, “pursue a system of gimcrackery,
Called Buseyism, a pack of stuff, and quite as arrant quackery.”
Says PHYSIC, “Mine have sleep-walkers, pretending, through the hide
of you,
To look, although their eyes are shut, and tell you what’s inside of you.”
“Ah!” says DIVINITY, “so mine, with quibbling and with cavilling,
Would have you, Ma'am, to blind yourself, to see the road to travelin.”
“Mine,” PHYSIC says, “have quite renounced their good old pills and
potions, Ma'am - - -
For doses of a billionth of a grain, and such wild notions, Ma'am.”
“So,” says DIVINITY, “have mine left wholesome exhortation, Ma'am,
For credence-tables, reredoses, rood-lofts, and maceration, Ma'am.”
“But hºspitals.” says PHYSIC, “my misguided boys are founding,
a'am.
“Well,” says DIVINITY, “of mine, the chapels are abounding, Ma'am.”
“Mine are trifling with diseases, Ma'am,” says PHYSIC, “not attacking
them.”
“Mine,” says DIVINITY, “instead of curing souls are quacking them.”
“Ah, Ma'am,” says PHYSIC, “I’m to blame, I fear, for these absurdities.”
“That’s my fear too,” DIVINITY says, “Ma’am, upon my word it is.”
Says Fº ...Fees, not science, have been far too much my wishes,
a all.
“Truth,” says DIVINITY, “I’ve loved much less than loaves and fishes,
Ma'am.”
Says each to each, “We’re simpletons or sad deceivers, some of us;
And I am sure, Ma'am, I don't know whatever will become of us.”
All Up with the Pope.
MonsLEUR Poltry DN, the French aeronaut, has almost exhausted
BUFFON's Natural History, in endeavouring to find some new animal on
which to make his, balloon ascents. He has gone up on horseback,
donkey-back, ostrich-back, and nearly every other species of back, until,
at last, he has been so hard, pushed for something new, that he
requested an elephant to give him a back, which the sagacious monster
declined. . It is now, we believe, in contemplation by Monsieur
PoiTEVIN to ascend on the back of the Pope's Bull, which will expe-
rience no difficulty in ascending, for it has attained the greatest height
ever known, at least in the way of impudence. -
The Hive Upset.
THE industrious character of the English nation, and particularly
rhaps the tºº. of it in the undertaking of the Great
ºxhibition of 1851, very probably gave rise to an impression at the
Vatican that our swarming millions were a nation of bees. By this
time, our ecclesiastical invaders are probably convinced of their mistake,
having found that their interference with our hive has raised a nest of
hornets about their ears.
How THE POPE's BULL is To BE EATEN.—With DURHAM Mustard.
MUSIC AND MANNERS IN LONDON.
It has been customary to unite together Music and Manners, as if
the one were connected with the other; but we are sorry to say, that
Music and Manners seldom go together in the Metropolis ; for we have
frequently requested an organ-grinder to “move on * with his music,
when he has not had the manners to . at all. The other day we
suffered much inconvenience in an over-the-Water-loo omnibus from a
cornet-à-piston on the roof, who, with an utter disregard of manners,
persisted in forcing his music upon us, dealing, blow after blow upon
our ear, till getting into a crowd collected by a “determined band,” we
were blocked up for several minutes listening to a species of “Concert
Stuck.” These facts lead us to the conclusion, that if music does not
speedily mend its manners—at least in the public thoroughfares—the
term “Music and Manners” will become perfectly absurd.
THE BISHOP OF LONDON'S CHARGE.
Wr always knew that the charge of a Bishop was something very
considerable—we had heard it estimated at about ten thousand per
annum—but the recent charge of the Bishop of LoNDoN is beyond all
price. If we were to add up each of its seven columns separately we
should be unable to give its sum total; but we regret that some of the
most insignificant items take up the most room; a great deal of s
being devoted to old scores that we hoped had been rubbed off. Thus
we have all the items of the GoRHAM affair, which has been already so
eostly to the church, set down again in detail; and the judicious
HookER is rather injudiciously hooked in, to swell a charge which had
far weightier matters to take into account. We find, subsequently, a
very long º occupied with BEVERIDGE, but on looking into this
beverage we find it little more than milk and water, which need not
have been set down at all, and of which the charge might have been
fairly curtailed. Nevertheless we look upon the Bishop's charge as,
on the whole, a reasonable one; and, if the charges of episcopacy were
never more extravagant than the one in question, we do not think the
church economists would have very strong reason to complain.
TICKLETOBY FOR BULLMONGERS.
AMong a heap of old arms and muniments devised in ancient times
for the defence of the British Crown and Constitution, the labours of
legal archaeologists have turned up a curious instrument which seems
capable of being again called into requisition. This ancient, weapon is
in a pretty fair state of preservation—or perhaps it would be more
correct to say, of pickle; for, in fact, it is a rod, which was made in
the time of Rich&RD iſ, for the back of any person or persons who
should introduce, or cause to be introduced, into these dominions, any
sort of document, from the Court of Rome or elsewhere, infringing on
the authority of the Sovereign. This implement of correction is called
the statute of Praemunire, and, though it may have lost some of its
twigs, there is yet birch enough in it to inflict a titillation far from
agreeable on any offenders who may subject themselves to its stripes.
It is to be hoped that the knowledge of the existence of the Praemunire
rod will so operate as to render the application of it unnecessary, and
that disloyal ecclesiastics will be deterred by it from invading the Royal
rerogative as effectually as ill-conditioned and vain snobs are prevented,
§ the fear of a whipping, from insulting the QUEEN. By the way, it
is to be hoped that if certain clergymen, commonly called Oxford
Divines, who rather approve of the |. Papal assault on the Crown,
are named in connexion with Oxford any more, it will be only with
OxpoRD the Potboy.
F-t
A Communication from Mr. Dunup.
“I see that LEIGH HUNT says, “New pleasures have old warrants.”
Now, I am sorry to differ with so great an authority as MR. Leigh
HUNT, but I never could see the slightest pleasure in a warrant, and I
have just been looking over a number of ‘old warrants,’ of which I
have a very large collection, and I must say that the inspection has

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AGGRESSION ON THE OMNIBUS ROOFS.
Y the Papers, I see, Mr. Punch,
that the Commissioners of
Police intend to put down
the seats on the roofs of the
omnibuses. In the first place,
Sir, if the roof-seats come
down, the fares will go .#
to the inconvenience of all,
except the ducal, episcopal,
baronial, and other extremely
superior classes. But there
are several descriptions of
persons whom, the proposed
alteration will particularly
incommode. - -
Being obliged to go inside
omnibuses, which are so nar-
row that people can neither
get in nor out without tread-
ing on their fellow-passen-
ers toes, will be a great
fº to gentlemen afflict-
ed with corns. Sir, unfortu-
mately, Ican sympathise with
those gentlemen. Othergen-
tlemen there are who are in
the habit of dining out. To
such it will be peculiarly
vexatious to be unable to
take a sixpenny ride to the
abode of hospitality, except
at the peril of a succession of
- highlows on resplendent boots. With these
gentlemen, Sir, I have also a community of feeling and interest. Then, Sir, there
are gentlemen, also, who I will not say have an aversion to infants, for that
would be barbarous, but who object to too close a proximity to those interesting
objects, and would rather be out of the hearing º their cries, or, at least, have
those innocent but intolerable sounds mellowed by as t a distance as possible.
To be condemned to the interior of an omnibus is to be doomed, in nine cases
out of ten, to immediate contiguity to an obstreperous babe in arms: a position
most nervous and uncomfortable. It is therefore a severe sentence, and a heavy
punishment to the class of gentlemen I have last adverted to, and in whose
susceptibilities and sensations. I likewise strongly participate. An omnibus full of
fine healthy young women-half a dozen of them with a nursling each in her lap-
is avery common, and, no doubt, a satisfactory sight; and they make, Idare say,
a very pleasant party among themselves, and are a very fit and proper cargo for
the inside of the vehicle. In the meantime, Sir, give me the out; and I hope you
will stand up for the roof-seats, and the comfort :*

AN UNCLE of A FAMILY.
ON BIRDS, BALLOONS, AND BOLUSES.
THE bird of Æsculapius, ought, certainly, to have been a goose; for “Quack,
quack, quack,” should be the great motto of medicine. One professor invents
an ointment for other people's bad legs, which keeps him comfortably on his
own, while another makes a harvest of everybody's corn, and a third publishes a
| to smooth the pillow of every invalid, or a bolus to render his bolster bearable.
another phase of quackery, we find specifics for the hair recommended to those
who are ready to take, any nonsense, into their heads, and will boldly stand “the
hazard of the dye,” in the vain hope that the grey, indicating the twilight or winter
time of life, may be exchanged for the dark, brown tints of summer or autumn
at the latest; and we are constantly being invited to “remove our baldness” in
advertisements, which we know to be the very essence of balderdash.
ckery, however, seems to be successful in some cases, for the public will
swallow anything from a puff to a pill, from music to medicine, from a play to a
plaister, and there is no doubt that (to paraphrase MACBETH, when speaking of
the possibility that Birnam Wood being come to Dunsimane):—
“If BARNUM would but come to Drury Lane,”
he would, by his force of quackery, make that pay him which has paid no one else
during the last quarter of a century. Such is the spirit of the age, that, reading
the accounts from America relative to our own protegée, JENNY LIND, we are
disposed to think that the nightingale is being made a goose of in the United
States—so vast is the amount of quackery with which her name is just now
identified.
As there is good to be got from every evil, we are justified in expecting that the
puff and ºf malady will cure itself, and if things are likely to mend when they
get to the worst, we may congratulate ourselves upon º having reached
almost the antipodes of sense and propriety. The balloon mania has already nearly
exhausted the utmost resources of absurdity; for M. Poitevin on a donkey—
how very like putting butter upon bacon!—has failed to attract, and three or four
women suspended in the air are, now necessary to tempt
the curiosity of the Parisian public when a balloon º
from the Hippodrome. We expect to hear next that
Poſteyn intends going up attached to the balloon by the
hair of his head, for he seems quite silly enough to become
the victim of such a very foolish attachment.

THE CONCERTS AT THE OPERA HOUSE REVISITED.
(By our own Impartial Critic.)
ATELY I repeated my
visit to the Grand Na-
tional Concerts once
or twice, and find that
they are now in some
measure vindicating
their claim to their
title. They include, at
least, one piece of music
in the course of the
evening, which is really
grand; and let us hope
that the serenatas of
MR. M A C F A RR EN,
MR. LoDER, and MR.
GLow ER, will render
them both grand and
national.
Persons who have the control of musical arrangements in this country, too often bear a
resemblance to a very unphilharmonic animal, both in respect of ears and obstinacy. The
directors of these concerts, however, I am happy to report, show that they can take a hint.
MR. BALFE and his band now play symphonies fairly out, executing them by regular process,
instead of murdering them by cutting them in two. When I heard BEETHQVEN's noble
Eroica for the second time, it was like beholding a mighty Colossus in its totality—instead
of seeing a giant, heels first and head afterwards.
Last night I heard the symphony in C minor by the same great man; and I would advise
everybody to hear it too, that would like the emotions of joy, and exultation, and triumph
to be excited in his soul —if he has a soul—for the small sum of eighteenpence, if he can
command that amount of capital. For º part, I paid three shillings for the entertainment,
being driven into the upper boxes by the crowd, which is now deservedly considerable at
this place of recreation, so much so, as to incommode a short fat man like me. The gallery
stalls would have answered my purpose at a less expense, but that the neighbouring
chandelier keeps hissing with its gas in a very disagreeable and unwarranted manner.
Upon my word I don’t regret my three shillings. had WEBER's Overture to Oberon
for it—full of fairy §. and chivalry—into the bargain. I also heard the gentlemen of the
choir of the Berlin Chapel Royal sing a fugue of Jom ELLI's, and wished them no further than
St. Paul's or Westminster Abbey. Iss ANGRI sang Di tanti palpiti, in a very saccharine
manner; and the jubilant Hedding March of MENDELssoHN was played with such spirit
that—if the thought of such a thing were not ridiculous on the part of a little corpulent man
—it might have persuaded me to go and seek to get married.
My three shillings' worth might have comprised a good deal more, inclusive of a selection
from one of DONIZETTI’s operas, and a fantasia on another; also a polka and a galop—
which I dare, say afforded sufficient diversion to those who were inclined to stop and hear
them. But the fashionable music of love and of the dance, does not affect my sympathies,
and if it did, would excite feelings incongruous with my personal appearance.
There is an individual performer at these concerts whom I cannot forbear singling out for
favourable mention. I allude to the gentleman who beats the kettle drums. He drums very
zealously—yet without, too much zeal; he is a drummer who would have just suited TALLEY.
RAND. His delicate, distinct touches tell exquisitely in the symphonies and overtures; and
he is particularly great in the grand thump in the overture to Oberon. I should really like
to hear this artist perform a fantasia on his special instrument. Fantasias, in general are,
to me, mere, musical exercises, and simply wearisome. . But a fantasia on the drum would,
at any rate, be a novelty. I say thus much for an instrument and a performer alike too
commonly neglected; and would not wish to insinuate that the orchestra, generally, is not
quite worthy of the kettle drum.
OMISSIONS FROM THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW.
MESSRs. Gog and Magog, in the purest spirit of civicism, beg (through Punch) to ask
wherefore the LoRD MAYOR’s procession—having once taken to fe. to the injustice of
the Proprietors and Fellows of the Zoological Gardens—failed to number among the stags,
elephant, and camel, the subjoined distinguished members of the animal world? The 9th of
November, 1850, is over and gone; but the labours of MEssRs. G. and M. may not be thrown
away upon the Lord Mayors as yet in the bosom of ſº
An OSTRigh-with a horse-shoe in his mouth, and the freedom of the City hung about his
neck. The iron to signify that, as a citizen of London, he is ready to swallow and digest
any and all of the arguments of the Court of Aldermen.
A ZEBRA-as the representative and type of worldly luck; showing how a species of donkey
may pass through the world in the finest of coats.
º JackDaw—as a bird associated with church towers and steeples; to be carried hawk-
wise, on the fist of the LoRD MAYQR's Chaplain; and to cry, at short intervals, “Twopence—
Twopence—Twopence,” in honour of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's Cathedral.

R E V | V A L S.
EEPLY, sensible I am, and ought to be, of the great privilege which I enjoyed a
few days ago, of travelling from the Paddington Station to Didcot, in ºr.
with the Rev. INGULPHUs. CRABBB. The Rev. INGULPH.Us and I were school-
fellows, and though our lots in life have been very different—he being now
senior tutor of St. Simeon's, as well as amateur father confessor to the Anglo-
Catholic sisterhood of St. Bennett, and the editor (somethink author) of those
very successful Puseyite novels, Žhe Prie-Dieu, Secrets of the Oratory, and The
Stake in the Country, or the Martyrs ºf Mount Street—while I—but no matter for
that—notwithstanding, I say, the difference in our positions, he is always very
affable when we meet, and does not even scruple to converse with me on the
present state of the nation, of which his views are, upon the whole, gloomy.
But I mever remember to have heard him so very dismal as during our
journey on this occasion. He kept drawing the most awful pictures of #.;
stalking through the length and breadth of our island, tearing down the
reredosses, putting out the candles, refusing to join in the antiphonies, building
churches without apses and piscinae—of a latitudinarian clergy, with shirt-
collars and whiskers—of the dreadful abandonment by the laity of the whole-
some discipline of fasts and floggings—and the general indisposition to auri-
cular confession—until I thought an old lady in the carriage would have gone
into hysterics. - -
“Where is the holy and child-like faith of our ancestors?” he asked. “Who
now endows a monastery, or settles his property in perpetuity on a chapter?
No, Sir, now-a-days we establish model lodging-houses, and believe in the
unintermitting water-supply and pipe-drainage. What has become of the
blessed practice of pilgrimages? Instead of them we have excursion-trains.
In place of praying at the shrine of our LADYE OF WALSINGHAM, or walking on
bare knees round the tomb of the blessed St.Thomas of Canterbury, Out
artisans are picture-seeing in the galleries of Hampton Court, or going to
Southampton and back for three-and-sixpence.”
This was the strain in which the REv. INGULPH.Us indulged till we shook
hands at Didcot; where he left us, and was received by two, young
acolytes, in pale faces, stiff cravats without ties, and long coats, one of whom
meekly shouldered his carpet-bag, the work probably, of one of the holy
sisterhood of St. Bennett aforesaid (for I observed embroidered on it, in the
early English style of crochet, a saint, with, pointed feet and erpendicular hands, and an inscription in the orthodox and illegible character,
familiar ; the ecclesiologist on monumental brasses); while the other reverently charged himself with the breviary (bound in *.
with Moyen-age clasps, and a cross patinée on the cover) with which the Rev. INGULPhus had been beguiling so much of his journey
as had not been ºd on the edifying discourse I have
described.
After his departure I don't know whether I fell asleep or not,
but I certainly had what CHRISTOPHER SLY, calls “an exposi-
tion” of veneration, which I have no doubt did me much good,
and which I will try to describe for the benefit of some of the
latitudinarian readers of this publication. - -
My mind, took a retrograde flight, in obedience to the impulse
it had received from the Rev. INGULPHus. I felt myself back-
.sliding, if I may say so, from present faiths and feelings, into past
beliefs, #." royalties, past pietisms.
My first sense was of the iniquity of adherence to the House
of Hanover, and a lively impression of the awful sin of the Act
of Succession, and the wilful wickedness of the Bill of Rights.
I returned to my allegiance and was at the feet of the Pretender,
renouncing “the glorious, pious, and immortal memory,” with great
unction. Of course my religious creed changed with my political.
I made a tremendous effort to stick fast at the High Tory, Tantivy,
Church and King Protestantism of Juxon, and LAUD-but in
vain—I was swept back—back into QUEEN MARy’s blessed reign,
and found myself shaking hands with BISHOP BonnER, as we
assisted at the roasting of a batch of heretics, somewhere near the
present site of the Victoria Park, and congratulated each other on
tº. ects of the true faith.
ere I thought I was secure. But the impetus backwards was
too strong, and (before I had time to take good note of the
changes), f had already done duty to Wop EN, and cooked some
scores of British captives à la panier, in honour of that fine old
Anglo-Saxon divinity. But I couldn't stop there either; and
the last thing I was, conscious of, was making a desperate effort
to stick a mistletoe bough into my cap, as I hurrahed a march of
original Druids, (the leader singularly resembling LABLACHE in
Oroveso) round about the gigantic circle of Stonehenge, on our way
to a human sacrifice.
Such was the effect on your humble servant of the REveREND INGULPHUs's Theory of Developments—in the wrong direction. "

INWASION AND SUBJECTION OF ENGLAND.
TR own icular reasons for
believing that the days of
England—as England, were
numbered—that the Royal
Standard at Windsor or Buck-
ingham Palace would be in-
evitably exiled to the tricolor
—and that the imperial crown
(now shown at one shilling
per head in the Tower)—
would be taken to bits, and
the prime jewels distributed
by the French President
among his Generals for sword
and shirt-studs—
Fº -
anging heavy as millstones
at our heart, we resolved
to enquire further into the
matter; to which end we
cunning man, whose private
and personal acquaintance with
the destinies, had made for
him a startling reputation as
the discoverer of hidden
money, stolen spoons, strayed asses, and bewitched cattle. Retired
CoLou R-SERJEANT BEEBONNET, of the Royal Rainbows, has long
been the acknowledged prophet of the town of Rawhead-cum-Gory-
bones; and to SERJEANT BEEBONNET, with a solemnity of countenance
not to be mistaken, by the sagacity of such a seer, we last week took
our way. At a glance, the Serjeant Prophet divined the cause of
our mission. “It’s all up,” said he ; “BRITANNIA may toast
crumpets with her trident; the House of Guelph may pack to the
Union, and Lords and Commons may squat at the Antipodes.” And
then the old gentleman, quivering from head to feet with the indigna-
tion of a patriot, took a few violent turns about his cottage, kicked
over a stool, cursing the bit of wood, for a scoundrelly Frenchman
and then dropt savagely with all his weight in his easy chair, and
setting the ferocity that stirred in his heart to music, he burst forth
singing—“And Britons ever, ever, ever, ever will be slaves/’”
aving waited until SERJEANT BEEBONNET had ventilated the
furnace of his soul, we at length opened our business. Would he-for
the good of his country and the increasing glory of Punch—would he
condescend to prophesy all the details of the approaching invasion, and
final subjection of England, by the French * º would be a great con-
solation to many families of the nobility, gentry, clergy, and even of the
public at large, at once to know the worst! Would the Prophet vouch-
safe to appear in robes of black-and-white: or, to speak in vulgar phrase,
would he, with pen and ink and foolscap, make manifest the horrors
that awaited a doomed, but singularly unreflecting country?
“It’s no use, Sir; not a 5. cried SERJEANT BEEBONNET, and
again he jumped to his feet, and struck his head, and knocked down
another three-legged stool, crying “Cossaque,” at the prostrate topsy-
turvy moveable. ...It's no use, Sir; Downing Street #. no more ears
than an oyster. When the bayonet is in its bowels, and red-boxes fly
about like blacks at a fire, then—then, perhaps, Downing Street may
think of Colour-SERJEANT BEEBONNET] "
We waited our time; for at length the patriot prophet—with a soft-
ness worthy of CoRIOLANUs in his most remorseful moment, consented
to . his soul into the middle of June, 1851, and upon a fair sheet
of foolscap to write down in order all the events of the invasion, and
subjugation of England, exactly as they will be written by the French
generalissimo commanding. We are prepared for the sarcasms and
unbelief of the headstrong and frivolous. They have no eyes for such
a prophecy; they see no more of it than if the fatal words were written
in ass’s milk upon *::::::: Insensate generation | When the fire of
an invading army shall have warmed that colourless fluid into the nigri-
tude of fact, then—but not till then—with blinded eyes, and gnashing
teeth, will you confess that the man who knew what was really what,
was SERJEANT BEEBONNET.

Yesterday our troops landed in the most perfect manner on Dover
beach. Not a drummer was missing. . The weather, propitious, to the
civilising arms of France, was hazy at day-break, and thickened into an
impervious fog towards noon. In the bosom of that fog we landed;

We formed, and marched to the Railway, when BoMBADIER MILLE-
LAURIERs rushed forward, and with his drawn sabre, cut the electric
wires—as he would have cut so many fiddlestrings—thereby destroying
all communication between Dover and the Metropolis.

ow much have we misunderstood these people! A train in advance
had spread the report of our coming. The populace was, dressed in
their holiday cottons. At the station, all the marriageable maidens,
with flowers upon their heads (a clergyman in attendance), and their
parents and guardians with their dowries in bags, supplicated an
alliance with our brave army. , But, with the voice of glory in his ears, |
the soldier of the Republic is deaf to love.
The army arrived in excellent spirits at Blackheath, where the cam
was pitched,—a part of my staff quartering at Greenwich Hospital. In
order to prevent a surprise by the Pensioners, I gave orders that
every man should, by sunrise, under pain of martial law, give in his
wooden leg!
The eastern approach to London in our
day-break upon the metropolis. With CUNNINGHAM's Handbook.
London, and two cabmen brought in by our Lancers, we no diffi-
culty in deploying upon Regent Street; and here—as before concerted—
our movements were crowned with success.
For at day-break, our gallant troops, lying in secret in the Crystal
Palace of Hyde-Park, whither, according to previous strategy, they had
been conveyed, packed up among the contributions of French com-
merce, to the Exhibition of all Nations—at ºreak our gallant troops
burst, with fixed bayonets, like lightning, forth ! -
The 42nd Light Voltigeurs—for three weeks with short, rations—
shut up in Paris pianos, of an entirely new movement (see Catalogue),
although a little doubled and cramped at first, soon, with the returning
energy of the soldier, stood at ease with beautiful determination.
A company of pioneers, bursting from bales of French, silk, and a
regiment of Sapeurs—too long § shut ". in French clock-cases—
poured like a torrent through the Park. In short, in less than an hour
all our troops, conveyed in French manufactures into the Crystal
Palace, to act in concert with the invading army, had formed. A mine
had been sprung by the brave fellows, to wile away the dreariness of
confinement, and precisely at 6 A. M., the mine was red and the glass
palace blown to atoms. PAxton, the architect, º from his lodg-
ings, hard by, in his morning-gown, to the scene of devastation, was
captured, but spared. I have ordered him a set of chains of 200 cwt.,
in tricolored crystal; and shall present him, when so manacled, to the
nation. As one of our brave fellows blithely observed, when the Crystal
Palace, with the world's Industrial Show, was blown to bits—“C'etait
joliment nettoyé !” -
At 7 A. M. London was ours with an amount of bloodshed quite
ridiculous; but then our gallant army was wonderfully seconded by the
efforts of thousands of our gallant countrymen, women, and children, all
lodgers at the hearth stones of perfidious Albion. Thave issued an
order that every householder shall immediately surrender up his house
and moveables, to be held and enjoyed by those French subjects at the
time of the invasion lodging with him.
It will be seen that, with the tems of thousands of our gallant country-
men domiciled with the unsuspecting Englishman, the downfall of
London must inevitably be un fait accompli. All honour to those
Frenchmen who, whilst enjoying a treacherous hospitality, were not
forgetful of the wrongs of France.
At an early part of the day, we found the animals of the Zoological

diversion. ...All the carnivora and the monkeys were set at liberty. e

they had suffered when gibbeted in the flag of England-turned wit

and leering, as, it , was thought, contemptuously, upon a Chief of

evinced great intelligence in following all our movements; and it is yet
to be seen whether they might not be enrolled as a Light Singerie,
with considerable effect.
The subjugation of England is complete. Of course there yet remain
a few insensate examples of defiance and contempt... QUEEN Victoria,

THE REAL CLERK OF THE WEATHER.
It used to be supposed that the Clerk of the Weather was an
imaginary individual, but a gentleman who is always writing to the
Times from Bermondsey Square, has evidently inducted himself into the
office alluded to. He appears to sit with one eye on the barometer,
and the other on the thermometer, all day and all night long, for the
". of noting the results, and contributing an occasional quarter of
a column to the leading journal. We have lately made some calcula-
tions, upon less elaborate data than the Bermondsey satant, and by
noting the tip of our nose, we found it stood at 40 in the shade on GUY
FAUx Day, and on the 9th, during the Lord Mayor's Show, the same
feature got up to 60 in the sunshine. Our highlows gave us, a
quarter of an inch as the depth of mud, but this does not show the
mean quantity of rain, as watering the roads would account for the
phenomenon. The pressure upon our chilblains was much below the
average of former years, and the freezing point, which we usually have
at our fingers' ends, was, up to the ii. of November, quite im-
perceptible.
Wanted as Tutor—an Accomplished Thief.
AN honest employment could be found now for the genteel high-
waymen and pickpockets of the last century. Some thieves of
courteous manners and light, fingers are sadly wanted to rob the tra-
yelling public, according to law, at the London Custom-house. The
Times says, that it is the practice there to do business so very coarsely
as to wrench open your plate-chest with a crow-bar in spite of your
offering a key. JACK SHEPPARD would have appreciated such polite
attention, and reciprocated it. Cannot some expert housebreaker be
found to teach, these persons to do their spiriting rather more gently,
instead of smashing and destroying as much again as they seize, like a
set of brutal, clumsy, half educated burglars?
SLANG OF THE SERVANTs' HALL.
THE old Post, the other day, recorded a wedding between a baronet's
son and a lord's daughter under the heading of “Marriage in High
Life.”, High life Whose life is high, in these times, unless it is
either led hºnourably or in a garret!. The phrase is a mere flunkeyism.
We now only hear of “High Life” below stairs.
DUBIOUS LOYALTY.
It is contended by some that the acceptance of a Papal bishoprick in
England is not incompatible with loyalty. We are afraid the only
loyalty it is consistent with is that of an IGNATIUS Loyolist.

MR. BRIGGS,
BRIEFLESS ON PUSEYITE BELL RINGING.
A CASE for the opinion of MR. BRIEFLEss was left the other §
with that, gentleman's laundress, who laid it before Counsel—wit
her own little bill—in the usual form, on the following morning. The
case ran thus, “Your opinion is required whether the early bell-ringing
at St. Barnabas, Pimlico, by which the inhabitants are disturbed at
uncouth hours, and rendered contemporaries with the sweeps and
other matutinal nuisances, can be prevented or legally punished.”
MR. BRIEFLEss has forwarded to his Belgravian clients the fol.
lowing opinion:—
“Temple, November 16th, 1850.
“I am clearly of opinion that the bell-ringing is a nuisance, and I
am less clearly—that is to say, rather dimly—of opinion that it will be
difficult to deal with it. If the bell were an external door-bell, and
not, a bell rung by an internal rope, we should have a handle to take
hold of, under the police act, which makes it an offence punishable with
a fine of forty shillings to ring a bell to the annoyance of the inhabi.
tants. Qn the other hand, I am afraid the law cannot grasp the rope
of the Puseyites;, and, perhaps, this may be a wise provision—or
omission—for, if they are left plenty of rope, they will eventually
hang themselves. . If proceedings were taken, and there should be a
conviction against the bell, a peal would lie, as it did in CLAPPER's
case, though the bell might be hung; but still, if it were shown to be
for the waking up of the priests, there might be a plea of benefit of
clergy. Qn the whole case, therefore, I am of opinion that it may be
worth while to take out a summons against the i. calling on
him to show cause why he should not be fined forty shillings for ringing
a bell in a thoroughfare, to the annoyance of the inhabitants.
“J. BRIEFLEss.”
MR. BRIEFLEss having, in the kindest and most considerate manner;

and MR. DUNUP having ...; the obligation, by placing Mr. -

conclusion ; for our belief is, that the Pope’s object in the nomination

LAB O U R A N D T H E R C. H.
By our own Special Metropolitan Correspondent.
O
JULLIEN's MASQUERADE.
UR Correspondent, in pursuance with the instruc-
tions he received from us, proceeded to the
above haunt of labour, in which the industrious
rich most abound, and the following is the
result of the information he collected on the
spot.
Our º begs us to state that he
experienced the greatest difficulty in collecting
any evidence at aii, for all the poor unfortunate
sufferers whom he questioned seemed to be so
ashamed of their vocation, that it, was only
with the most untiring patience and good-hu:
mour he succeeded in eliciting a single word
from any one of them. In genial harmony with
the influence of the place, it was as much as
he could do to get any one to speak; and he
assures us that the task he has just completed
was such an unpleasant one, was so beset with
annoyances an º and insults in every
...}. shape, that he would not undertake
it again for any consideration. How he escaped, being knocked down,
he cannot imagine, for he says—“It is one of jº. peculiarities
of the class of people who labour at an English masquerade to
think it an insult if they are spoken to ; and not unfrequently they
resent it as such, by levelling the impertinent offender who accosts them
at full-length upon the floor.”
It is not necessary to describe the locality in which Our Correspondent
ursued his investigations. Every one is acquainted with JULLIEN's
asquerade and its dazzling glories of gas, and its garlands of coloured
calico, and, its clusters of gilt CUPIDs that are suspended from the
ceiling by the waist, and, by the heat of the chandelier, keep turning
round like larks at a fire. Every one knows JULLIEN, too, and his
memorable smile and white waistcoat, the one, like the other, as unfaded
as the first day he put it on, and every one knows and admires the
fº nature with which, he mimics a musical fanaticism... Every one
as laughed at the good-humoured languor with which the majestic
MoNs. drops exhausted into his regal arm-chair, after having enacted
the most terrific quadrille-storm that ever distracted the baton, of a
conductor, and smiles privately to himself. In fact, JULLIEN always
seems to us to be smiling under his white waistcoat at the fools he is
making of his audience, and we look upon this fine kerseymere smile
of JullLEN's as the greatest proof of his genius. We are confident
mo one enjoys the fun so much as he does.
All these things are familiar to everybody, and we think Our Corre-
#. was perfectly right in not wasting our valuable space in the
thousand told enumeration of them.
The following is the substance of Our Correspondent’s painful
investigations:—
THE RIGHT Honour ABLE SYDNEY SMIRKINgs.--Is a clerk in the
Treasury. Came to the Masquerade because he hadn't anything better
to do. Wishes he had gone to bed. Bought a nose at the door, and
thought it original, but it was pulled off before, he had been two
minutes in the room. Has been walking about three hours; is very
tired and sleepy. Wishes smoking was allowed. Thinks dancing at a
masquerade vu #. Shouldn't mind a Polka in a lobby, if no one was
to see, him. Shall walk about for two hours longer, and then go
home.” This evidence was interrupted by several hems, and hahs, and
yawns, and elongated by the most distressing symptoms of fashionable
tlessness.
THOMAS ToADy, Esq.-This, poor creature was found fast asleep
about two o'clock in the morning, in a private box. It was with the
greatest difficulty Our Correspondent could wake him—“Wishes the
orchestra wouldn't make such a row. It prevents him sleeping. Wh
does he sleep? How can he help it?—the thing’s so precious stu |
Hates all masquerades. Why did he come then? Because it was SIR
ALFRED's box—and a person must go somewhere...Why doesn't he
go down stairs? Because a wild Indian said something funny to him,
and he hates funny º: so he got out of the way as quick as he
could.... Must have knocked the man down if he had stopped. Shall
stop till five o'clock, when SIR ALFRED stands supper at the Bedford.
Hates being bored. Wants to go to sleep again”—and before Our
Correspondent had left the box, he says, the unfortunate wretch buried
his fatigues under a heap of great-coats, and in less than a minute was
competing with the ophicleide as to which of the two should make the
greater noise.
CAPTAIN DE SILLIMAN.—“Is in the Army. Has £5000 a-year,
and expects as much more when the old governor cuts up. Intends to
spend every penny of it, like a brick. fº. hard work, though, this
asquerade. Here I have been these four hours, and, egad! I never
worked so hard in all my life. Will you believe it?—the only fun I’ve
had was bonneting a Charles the Second—here’s his feather—because,
you will scarcely credit, it—the impudent vagabond dared to speak to
me without an introduction. Shall stop till there’s a row—there must
be one shortly—and then won't he go into it!” The evidence of this
misguided, youth—he was not more than five and twenty—was largely
interlarded with oaths totally unfit for publication.
FRENCH HARLEQUIN.—“Refuses giving his name or his card either;
but is a member of the superior classes. Was told it was the ticket?
to go in costume, because it was so expressed in the one he bought;
but shall know better another time. Wishes he was at the Club
playing lansquenet; he’s tired of this fun—if it is fun—for, for the life
of him, he can't see it; and he’s been looking for it everywhere ever
since ten o'clock. Why doesn't he go home? Because he has lost the
key of his chambers, and he must stop out till the laundress comes in
the morning to do his room. Why doesn't he do something to promote
the merriment of the evening. That’s all very well; but why don't
you? why don't the others? He doesn’t see anybody else doing it;
and he doesn't like doing anything that’s singular y, he would be
laughed at Well, supposing it is a masquerade, still, a gentleman
naturally doesn't like doing anything that causes him to be laughed at.
Why doesn't he try to be witty? Because he does’nt choose. Is that
his own costume * Why, of course, it is. Do you think he stole it?
What, he might have hired it? Qh ! you think so, do you? Well
then, here goes,!” and, so, saying, he raised his Harlequin's arm, and
dealt a heavy blow, which Our Correspondent luckily avoiding, fell
upon the unprotected breast of a German student; and soon there was
a general row, which quite deadened the noise of JULLIEN’s band, and
for the next ten minutes nothing was heard save the voice of CAPTAIN
DE SILLIMAN, shouting above the tumult, ‘I’m your man.’”
The remaining evidence is much of the same care-worn texture.
Pierrots, Débardeurs, Barristers, Cooks, Postillions,—persons in the
most nondescript costumes, and others in no costume at all,—gentlemen
sober and otherwise—blackguards affecting the gentleman, and gentle-
men doing (only with a better, success) the blackguard, I-were all
severally examined; but no fresh fact was sifted out of the mighty
heap of nonsense. -
It is unnecessary to state, that the toil was voluntary. It is so far
lucky; for we doubt if any money could have compensated for the
amount of fatigue and suffering which that night must have been under-
gone. It only proves how much an Englishman will endure
------
THE CABMAN.
IN loneliness upon his box the moody Cabman sat,
Close buttoned was his overcoat, sullenly slouch'd his hat; "
The pipe of shortness from his mouth he fiercely snatched away,
Muttering—“We’re very much alike, thou humble piece of clay.
“The bitter world despises us, but calls us at its need,
Uses us up, casts us away when done with–like a weed.
Though right and left with eagerness my starting eyeballs glare,"
Though crying ‘Cab, Sir!’ all day long, I cannot find a fare.
“When from the stand I deviate, along the street to ply,
The stern policeman fixes me, with all observant eye.
Down goes my number in a book, and lo! within a week,
I .# a guilty trembler before the avenging beak;
“Men step from out their stations, by many a wilful prank,
It is the cabman only, that’s fettere § his rank;
From it he dare not move away, his daily bread to gain;
He must, till some one calls him off, true to his rank remain.
“An iron badge he's doomed to wear on his external vest,
They will not i. it anywhere, save on his heaving breast,
'Twould seem that persecution were of their plan a part,
Else why dash down the metal plate upon his very heart?
“”Tis cruelty’s refinement, the bosom thus to brand
With weight of senseless iron, cold as a tyrant's hand;
And if in passion's anguish he hurries it from sight,
A summons may be found at home to welcome him at night.
“The law won't let him leave his box an instant, e'en to quaff
The early purl of day-break, or the morning's half and half.
{...} too must be the grog-nor e'er must reach his lip,
While with his cab–the delicate and egg-begotten flip.
“He mustn't say an angry word, though abuse on him may shower,
Retaliation's luxury is never in his power;
And if to cheat him of his fare a passenger essay,
He can but ask the knave's address and let him walk away.
“Alas! for our fraternity there’s mothing like repose,
Though §ººl sound the cabman's Gees,’ sad are the cabman's
‘Woes.”
Thus let me write my epitaph, my awful fate beware;
i: Urube the murlu until, at last, it urugr me to Nespair.”

A FEW WORDS ON OFFICIAL COSTUME.
In these days when puffery with its thousand tongues is calling upon
us to reform our tailor's bills; when the ten-guinea great coat of
other days is exchanged for the five-and twenty-shilling wrap-rascal, or
the pound paletot of the present, we may be ..". saying a few
words on behalf of economy in official costume. -
We are cutting down salaries to the minimum; we are calling upon
public servants to do a double day's work for half a day's pay; and yet
official costume remains unreformed, continuing as costly as ever. If
a man is made a serjeant-at-law, though the business is not what it
used to be, the full-bottomed wig is as indispensable as ever, and
costs exactly the same; so that the coif is now seldom applied for, in
consequence of the smallness of the chance of profit, and the certain
expence of “dressing for the character.”
A serjeant's wig cuts into an awful amount of horse-hair, and one of
our “learned brethren” having remonstrated the other day with his
wig-maker on the extravagance of his prices, was seriously, informed
that a single wig uses up the tails of six animals; and our friend was
referred to a respectable knacker for a confirmation of the fact. The
ordinary bob-wig of the “utter” will take the best part of a pair of
#. and then it must be a very close shave; while a #. every-
ay head-dress will make a couple of cobs' tails look very
oolish, leaving
º just enough to get a coachman's Caxon out of the remains.
t is true that these wigs have come down to us from our forefathers;
but why should we take their folly upon our own shoulders ? Are we
#: up the toes of our boots and shoes because our ancestors
so
We ask this question, because it is one that comes directly to the
point. Descending from the wig to the gown, we find extravagance
and absurdity pervading the toga or togery of the highest, judicial
functionaries; and we especially protest against the robe of the Lord

THE DEFENCELESS STATE OF ENGLAND.
The alarm about the unprotected femaleship of poor
BRITANNIA has at last come to a head, SIR FRANÇis having
published a book telling us that London is liable to be
walked into by 150,000 Frenchmen at any hour of the day.
is is a sort of story that, is avowedly intended to
stimulate naval preparation, and we therefore recommend
the author at once to “tell it to the marines.” We
are quite sure that if, 150,000 Frenchmen were to be
seen at the Bricklayers' Arms, the common cry would be
“what are the police about,” and MR. INSPEctoR SoME-
Body would at once proceed to the Elephant and Castle;
for the purpose of sufficiently *:::: said “Elephant,”
and preventing the “Castle” from being taken, by storm;
SIR FRANcis proposes the immediate fortification, of
London, in the style of Paris, but really the market
gardeners in the suburbs will tell him we want all our
trenches for our celery, and as to throwing up mounds, we
have quite enough of that in getting ready the beds for
our asparagus. - -
Wandsworth sleeps soundly enough without the aid of
bastions. Brixton would rise as one man if it were about
to be cut off by a moat from Clapham; and Chelsea, if
threatened with being “loopholed,” would find any loop-
hole to get out of the expense. -
Kensington would never quietly consent to be encircled
with a rampart, and Hammersmith would fight with its
last shillin inst being converted into a fort. , Fan
a drawbridge i. pulled up and down at Hyde Park
Corner for the passage of every vehicle, and only conceive
Battersea fitted up with a gun battery to enable it, to
annihilate Putney, or blow Wandsworth into, the water
at a given signal. No! No! we are not so silly as tº
frightened by the shaking of a nervous head, at us. There
ls ºns in it, our elderly female readers may rest
assured.
The Authors of our own Pleasures.
We have received the following from “An Amateur,”
who, we imagine, must have been a contributor to the
defunct Annuals, and other sources of unpaid literature.
“Authors may, indeed, be called the authors of their own
º: for, after all, it must be confessed that there are
ew pleasures in this world to be compared to the ecstatic
pleasure the author feels in reading one of his own articles
in print.” According to this, no man can have so many
pleasures as the sedulous penny-a-liner, for he sees his
articles in print almost every day of his life.
Chancellor, which, we understand, costs several hundred pounds. We
have heard that its costliness, and the time required to make a new
one, will sometimes cause it to be transferred, with the seals, from
Chancellor to . Chancellor, so that the present keeper of the royal
conscience, being much shorter than his predecessor, would have been
obliged to get a tuck or two “run in,” to adapt the long robe to the
little wearer.
LoRD CAMEBELL, on the contrary, had he taken LoRD DENMAN's
costume with his office, must have had a flounce added, or a hem let
down, or a false hem constructed, to lengthen out the judicial gown.
The Chancellor's state robe is a sort of black dressing-gown, with
squares of gold leaf, Dutch metal, or some other glittering material
arranged along the front of it, and reminding the spectator of the good |
old days of the drama, when ToM THUMB was a standard burlesque.
We should be glad to know, why these absurdities of costume
are abolished on the Stage, and still remain on the Woolsack and the
judicial bench, when, we have no doubt, the learned masqueraders
would be glad to be spared the expense of buying, and the trouble of
wearing them.
The Progress of the Times.
WE understand that, in order to show their disapproval of the recent
nomination of DR. WISEMAN to the office of Cardinal, the Protestant
Printers of London have resolved to set their faces, and their types,
against titles lin Roman characters, which are now quite out of every-
body's good books.

FRAGMENTS FROM THE HISTORY OF CASHMERE.
BY THE ARABIAN HISTORIAN KARAGOOZ.
CHAP. 222.
- THE beautiful kingdom of Cash;
mere was, it is very well
known, governed by the
magnificent EMPREss Ko-
HINUR, a sovereign so re-
nowned for beauty, virtue,
and an heroic disposition,
that all the kings of the
earth, paid court to her,
and her banner was re-
spected wherever it was
beheld. She gave her em-
pire in charge to Viziers
of great fame, Russool
JEHAUN, a statesman
the President of her Divan,
and administered the inte-
rior affairs of the Empire;
= while the foreign relations
5 of Cashmere were upheld,
and her enemies made to
tremble by the wisdom and
valour º the undaunted
PULMERStoon. By , the
Cashmerian laws, the hus-
- band of the Empress, is
forbidden, to take a part in political matters: that Prince, therefore, passed his
time in the chase, or in the pursuits of literature, and exercised his genius, in
beautifying the city of Lundoon. . It is to him that the Lundoonees. owed the
beautiful turban which they wore for many ages; and it was he who, with the aid
of two genii, PACKISTUAN and Foox, raised up in a single night that extraordina
palace of crystal, which brought all the people of the earth to visit Lundoon,_an
made it the eighth wonder of the world. -
The kingdom of Cashmere was peaceful and happy: the ports were full of ships;
the bazaars were thronged with merchants and goods; the roads were covere
from one end of the empire to the other, with people travelling in security; the
Cadis did their duty;-in a word, Lundoon was the greatest city, Cashmere
the noblest empire, and Kohin UR the happiest sovereign in the world but for one
drawback—the constant rows of the Mollahs, who were perpetually quarrelling
among themselves.
It is known that for a long time the Cashmerians were followers of OMAR, the
successor of the Prophet; and that, the Chief. Imaum of Mecca had the appoint-
ment of the Chief Mollahs of Cashmere during many ages. The Cashmerian
Sovereigns, jealous of their independence, had always done their utmost against
that arrangement which made their country a sort of spiritual dependency upon
the Holy City of Arabia; and the pretensions and quarrels consequent upon this
assumption, kept the Cashmerians in constant trouble and hot water. The country
swarmed with Dervishes from Mecca; Arabian zealots came and took possession of
the Cashmerian Mosques, and preached to the people in a language they could not
understand; the boldest of them called upon the Sovereigns of Cashmere themselves
to pay homage to the Chief Imaum of Mecca for their thrones: for they said that
the High Priest of Mecca was the Vicegerent of the Prophet, that the Prophet
had given him power over all thrones and kingdoms, and woe betide those monarchs
who disobeyed him. When one of their Mollahs, by name THAMAz UL BUKEET, was
murdered by one of the Kings of Cashmere, they made him go on his bare knees
to the slaughtered saint's tomb; they declared that miracles were worked there:
that the sick were cured, the wicked made sure of Paradise, that the statues round
the tomb wagged their heads and talked, that the pictures winked—who shall say
what other wonders were performed?—I have read them in the Ancient Historians—
round the tomb of THAMAZ | Who shall believe the stories? Let him do so who will.
After some thousands of years, and when not only the people of Cashmeria,
but those of º other countries, began to doubt about the sovereignty which
the High Priest of Mecca claimed, and to declare that not only OMAR, but that
ALI, but that HAssan and HoosseIN, but that other good men could interpret the
Koran for themselves; and that the claims of the Imaum of Mecca were, in a word, all
bosh, and that he was a priest and a man, like another: it chanced that there ruled
a king in Cashmere, who was called KING SULYMAuN THE EIGHTH. And he wished
to put away an old wife of whom he was tired, (her name was ARAGOON), and to
marry a beautiful young houri who was called the PERIANABULANE.
The Imaum of Mecca would not dissolve the marriage between KING SULYMAUN
THE EIGHTH and poor old ARAGOON, and threatened him with curses if he divorced
her. But the viziers and nobles of Cashmere, who trembled before KING SULYMAUs,
a magnificent, prince, who made nothing of cutting their heads off, said the kin
might marry his new wife; accordingly he did so, º his fingers at the bj
of the Imaum of Mecca, who had complimented him upon his religious principles a
#" before, and sent him a robe of honour, with the title f Defender of the
al
. The king was in such a rage at the Imaum's curses, that he caused a proclama-
tion to be made all through his empire that he, SULYMAUN THE EIGHTH, was supreme
matchless for wisdom, was |h
in his own dominions, Vicegerent of the Prophet, and
Defender and Commander of the Faithful; that the name
of the Imaum of Mecca should never more be heard in
any house or mosque in Cashmere; that any man, who
denied that he, SuiymAUN, was the Chief of the Faith,
should have his head cut off. his tongue cut out, his body
chopped in quarters, and his goods confiscated. And he
seized upon all the mosques, caravanserais, hospitals, houses
belonging to the old Meccaites (who were grasping and
greedy, but withal good to the poor), and partitioned them
amongst his lords and viziers, who made no bones about
accepting the plunder. -
As for the Cashmerians, it mattered little to most of
them : they were as glad that the King at Lundoon should
be styled Vicegerent of the Prophet, as that the Imaum of
Mecca should hold that title: they did not like that their
king (for they are the vainest people in the world) should
i.i. homage to any other potentate in Mecca, Medina,
Constantinople, Abyssinia, Jericho, or any other ..".
And they fell into the new order of things without -
culty, excepting some few rebels and obstinate, who were
anged, drawn, and quartered accordingly. For in these
good old times, when Faith was stronger, among us than
it is now, everybody cut everybody else's head off: think-
ing rightly that it was better to ºp an unbeliever's tongue,
than let it wag to the detriment of religion, and the per-
version of simple persons from the truth.
Before he died, SULYMAUN THE EIGHTH cut off ANA-
BULANE's head too, and married somebody else. And his
son, and then his daughter, reigned after him in Cashmere.
The king's son was but very young, and did not reign
very long over Cashmere. And all the time of his reign,
his sister MARIAM, who was daughter of poor old QUEEN
ARAGoon, kept her mother's faith very stoutly, and gave
up her whole º to the Imaum of Mecca. . So that when
the young Prince, whose subjects loved him very much,
died, and the QUEEN MARIAM succeeded, everybody knew
that Mecca was to be in the ascendant once more; and
the Meccaite priests, dervishes, mollahs, and imaums came
swarming ...! into Cashmere again, and the mosques were
handed over to them; and the late king's mollahs and ulemas
began to see that the time for eating had arrived.
AN AFFAIR OF FOLLY.
THE Irish correspondent of the Times stated, that, on
Saturday week last, a hostile *...* took place in Phoenix
Park, between the MARQUIs 9F SLIGO and MR. G. O.
HIGGINs, M.P.; but terminated without wilful murder—
in smoke unattended with fire—through the intervention
of the police. - -
It is to be hoped this account will be contradicted before
we publish the observation, that the Marquis who could
make a mark of himself deserves to be a butt; and the
Commoner who could expose his silly brains to perforation
must be the greatest goose at time grazing on a
common.
“The misunderstanding," says our authority, “we have heard, arose
out of a late election of ex officio guardians in the county of Mayo."
No misunderstanding could possibly have taken place
between persons who could have had no UNDERSTANDING
whatever.
The Force of Habit.
A LITERARY man, quite a greedy bibliomaniac, who had
devoured bookshelves as a little school-girl devours slice
after slice of bread and butter, and whose successes in
literature are in equal proportion to his devouring appetite
(we are sorry we are not at liberty to mention his name),
was so overpowered with *...* topsy-turvied with his
new sensations—upon the birth of his first son, that
instead of taking the fact to the Registrar, he went, as #
he had been the author of a new book, and him.
“Entered at Stationers' Hall.”
Religious Warmth.
AN advertisement in the Times announces a plan for heat-
ing churches by means of hot water. We wonder if the
patentee has any testimonial to show from MR. BENNETT
or any other of the Puseyite priests who have introduce
into #. Church more hot water than has been known there
for the last hundred years.

THE PAPAL USURPATION.
(A CHANT.)
A BEADLE and a Parish-Clerk were heard to interchange remark, and
hold discourse and conversation upon the Papal usurpation in a style
and tone that savoured of delight and exultation.
Says the Clerk, “They’ve been and done it—well, for my part, I’m
lad on it; now their Puseyism is paid for; all turns out just as I said
or: all so much the better, neighbour; Church and QUEEN I’m not
afraid for.”
Says the Beadle, “Them's my notions. I believe these here com-
motions and Papistical pretences will bring people to their senses, from
their unparochial courses, showing what their recompense is.”
Says the Clerk, “Folks long neglected, now begins to be respected;
now some reverence and attention’s paid to parties I could mention,
who was snubb’d by other parties 'fore this Papal hinterwention.”
Says the Beadle, “That sion—for to use a mild expression—
has created a compunction, and restored a proper junction of importance
with the notion of a high parochial function.”
Says the Clerk, “They looks devout, now, when I the psalms give

MORE ZEAL WITHOUT DISCRETION.
WE have lately heard of a Protestant with rather more sincerity
than judgment, who has just discharged an old and faithful servant
because the poor fellow happens to have a Roman nose!

HOW TO AVOID BECOMING A GREAT CRIMINAL.
WE recommend Louis-NApoleon to write over every door, and on
the walls of every room of the Elysée, the following words:—
“I consider. As GREAT CRIMINALs Those who, by personAL AMBITIox, would
CoMPROMISE THE SMALL AMount of stability GUARANTEED US BY THE Cox-
StrtuTION.”
. They may operate as a moral checkstring, in the event of his attempt-
ing to drive, the “Char de l’Etat” too fast, and Louis-NapoleoN
cannot possibly object to the term “GREAT Canºnsis.” for they are
his own words, taken from his own Message delivered at the opening of
the Chamber, only last week.
Awful Reduction and Alarming Sacrifice.
THE prospects of the Repeal Association are getting weaker and
weaker every week; and, indeed, the funds have reached such a low
pitch, that it is a toss-up of a halfpenny whether a penny wi
received. . At one of the recent meetings, the subscription had become
so miserably minimised, that MR. JoHN O'Connell, when about to
announce the collection, found himself quite unable to collect even
self, and finished by declaring that “on this melancholy occasion his
heart was—rent.”
THE PAPACY OUT OF ITs ELEMENT.
XERXEs, it is recorded, pretended to put the sea in fetters, and

attempt on the liberty of the English Sees, will probably be as com-
plctely undeceived.
found out his mistake.
A Short Review of a New Publication.
The Defenceless State of England.—We have read this volume of
foolscap, and its positions are, no doubt, very strong, for there is great
difficulty in getting through them. We pronounce the book altogether
one of which neither headnor tale can be made. -
Another, Criticism.—The “Defenceless State of England” may be
compared to some very small beer with a Head to it; and we all know
that on such occasions the head is nothing but froth.

MR. PUNCH*S APPEAL TO AN EMINENT
APPEALER.
THOUGH I am by profession a vagrant and jester, cracking my jokes
at street corners, setting up, my booth at fairs and taverns, and before
house-windows, whence children and women are looking out, your
Most Reverend Eminence must understand that I am a man and
citizen, a tax and rate-payer, and father of a family anxious to lead a
decent life, to leave a tolerably honest name to my children, and to
keep for them and myself the privileges of free action and opinion, which
the English Constitution awards to me and all other people. An
Englishman he by trade a bishop or a buffoon, has §: right of
be
freedom and fair-fellowship. If I were to die, my children would claim
and have for my body the privilege of becoming sepulture; I should
not be thrust into ground unconsecrated, like poor MoLIERE, for
instance, whom your Eminence's predecessors would have buried like
carrion. I am Punch, but I am Civis Britannicus, and, as such, feel and
think as earnestly upon some subjects as the gravest big-wig among the
subjects of our CAESAR. I think there never was an empire so glorious,
and hold to my rights and my title as strenuously as any Peer of Parlia.
ment, Lord Mayor, or Magistrate can do.
. Hence, if there be a national question—if there were a foreign inva-
sion, for example-I must take my side, and shoulder my musket as well
as another. I think yours is a jº invasion, and must do my best
to repel it; and find myself compelled to adopt a line of conduct rather
different to my usual waggery, in the presence of such an enemy, as
reason or º; leads me to consider you to be. You come hither,
ignoring the religion of my country, as much as if I were a savage or a
ottentot: you arrive, bringing with * the keys of Heaven in your
pocket. I deny your pretences utterly, and with my whole heart; I
scorn your claim to infallibility. I no more care for your Pontifex
Maximus, than for the High Priest of Jupiter, who preceded him; and,
in my quality of Protestant, protest against you, and every bishop,
priest, and deacon under your orders; declaring my belief that honest
people can get to Heaven without you, and in spite of you, and entirely
repudiating your clerical scheme. Anybody who thinks that he cannot
be secure without calling your reverences in, is welcome. There’s no
question of persecution. Qur people may burn a Guy or two; and they
had best leave that symbolical representation alone; but you know that
if you were hustled, Policeman X, would stand by you; and you compli.
ment the Lord Chief Justice, who would give you a fair trial.
| Only, if you hear a shout of defiance and anger from one end of the
| country to the other, do not, most reverend and dear Sir, express a
wonder at hearing it. If we cry out, it is, because we feel ourselves
injured, depend on that. Suppose you were the Cadi of Constantinople,
let us say, and believing no more in Catholicism than in Protestantism,
but having a knowledge of the points at issue, and of the history of the
two churches, is there nothing in the past history and present preten-
sions, of the Catholic Church, which would lead you. to suppose the
possibility of free men and Englishmen hating it? Was there never a
murder of the Hugonots, and a Pope to sing Te Deum for the strages?
Was there never a stake in Smithfield? Do you not lay your ban upon
knowledge now wherever you go, or refuse to deliver to the people any
such that does not bear your supervisional stamp : We hate you,
because we believe you to be tyrants: we scout your pretensions; as
these pretensions go, we hold them to be utterly absurd and untenable.
It is by overthrowing these pretensions centuries ago, that we secured for
the country free citizenship, free press, free commerce. You come among
us as the officer of a sovereign whose own state is the most ignorant
and benighted in furope—whose own subjects hate him, so that, they
would, but for superior force, fling him out of their country; and you
set his standard up here, and wonder you are not popular! We denied
your worship, because we believed it led to ignorance, and tyranny, and
debasing superstition; because it was defaced by monstrous corrup-
tions: nature and reason revolted against it; and we detested and over-
threw it. And, as you make your solemn re-entry into England, with
no small parade j ceremony of jubilation, the people welcomes you,
and tells you how it regards you.
You are here, as elsewhere, as everywhere, to make converts, and to
accept martyrdom—and about that dreadful oath that you swore—yes,
about that oath. Did you, or did you not, (when invested with the pallium
woven by consecrated virgins from the wool of segregated muttons), an
on your knees before the Commander of the Faithful, did you, or did you
not, pledge yourself to persecute and . as far as you could, all
| Heretics? If you had the power, and could silence Mr. Punch, wouldn't
you? Do you allow a free press at Rome Are fair questions of
politics or religion fairly discussed there P. Is there a Holy Office
existent or not? Is the Diario di Roma as large and well-conducted a
journal as the Times newspaper? Will all the Catholic newspapers of
the Legations and Naples publish the letters of our Archbishops as our
Protestant Journals publish yours?—Pooh!—Psha 1-your Eminence
has an eminent sense of humour, and you know that the question is
absurd—that your people are, and must be, tyrants and persecutors–
that you dare not face the light of day—that, having possession of the
truth absolute, discussion is out of the question. .You may invoke
“that love of honest dealing and fair play, which, in joke or in earnest
is the gift of an Englishman;” but you don’t give honest dealing and
fair play in return. You can't. You can't allow a man to think for
himself. Our right and starting point—our safeguard—the right to
which you appeal—the safeguard under, which you put yourself—is
Free Opinion. Your starting point is Authority. As the August Al DER:
MAN LAwRENCE says, in the Common-Council, your church “has always
assumed to itself the same line of conduct, and that is d-nation.”
The word is the yenerable, Alderman's—and rather a grave, one to be
introduced into a Journal whereof the tendency is ordinarily jocular.
But when your most reverend coadjutor, JoHN OF TUAM, calls our
colleges Godless, he says pretty much the same thing as ALDERMAN
LAwRENCE; when your shepherds, writing Pastorals, adopt such a word
as that, and deny to us English and Irish, with love in our hearts, with
a desire of fraternity and benefitting our people by the gift of truth and
knowledge to all; when your Bishops and Doctors call our scheme
Infidel, and denyus Heaven; when ğ. Doctor NEwMAN, on the
appointment of your Eminence and Grace, and their Lordships your
º: suffragans, gets up in chair, and states that the grave is opened,
and that its awful tenant has arisen-indicating by that dreadful image
that we, the people of England for the last three centuries-that his
|fathers and mine—that his mother and mine—have been living and
|dying without Faith and Hope, and are participators in that unspeakable
crime and penalty; are we to feel nothing?—to have no scorn for your
arrogance, no hatred for your intolerance, which bars the progress of
Truth, Love, Knowledge, and Equality—to make no protest against the
decree by which you absolutely withdraw the º of Heaven from
us, and consign the souls of our race and people, of our dearest and best
beloved, to hopeless perdition? You do all this—you have the Truth
absoluté, and can’t do otherwise—and then you wonder at the anger of
Englishmen, and that what you call a death-whoop is raised about
your ears. -
How can you suppose, official Expugnator and Persecutor of Heretics
as you are, that you are to be free to persecute and expugnate, and that
we are not to protest, and to defy you ? Your Chief sends his pastoral
letter, parcelling out our country under the ecclesiastical Fº of
you thirteen gentlemen, and taking no more count of the religion
already existing here, than if Westminster were Melipotamus, which
see to our great regret your Grace has vacated. You have the Truth
absolute; there is but one Church: of course, you can do no otherwise.
We propose a scheme of Education; your Bishops interfere with the
imperiaſ plan, denounce us as Godless and Infidel: of course, you can
do no otherwise. You want to win the country back to the old faith
by expugnation, by persuasion—by what means you can, in a word: of
course: it is your calling: your duty: your business of life. Suppose

we do not deny you on your side the constancy of your martyrs, and the
admirable courage of your opinion—but now, as then, we and you are
enemies. The consequence of our system is toleration; it admits you to
rights which you can’t give us, and secures to you a freedom of which
we never would desire to rob you. You make your claim of infallibility
—we laugh at and scorn it. You rely on your antique pedigree and
ceremonies—we call your ceremonies mummeries—yes, mummeries—
why, not *. What is the cause of this “feeling too sickly and too
ening for indignation?” Of course we thought them mummeries:
that was why we got rid of them. Whether is it worse, to call your
Eminence's red stockings, or the lighted candles of those poor Pimlico
folks mummeries, or to tell us who wish to teach the spelling-book that
we are Godless and Infidel? one or the other of the statements is true,
must be true; and each side has been making it for three hundred years.

of our Bishops would º and stay, they might be very welcome. And
about Westminster? What was the difficulty, which prevented your
Grace from going amongst the benighted Irish in the slums of that

more likely to be converted by Westminster? That you may be the

inveterate, that I believe in the Beadle, the Cardinal, and good SAINT

A SCENE IN WESTMINSTER HALL.
ONE day, during the term that is just over, a jejune junior rushed into
the Exchequer with a motionette, or little motion, and happened to enter
ust as their Lordships, in Banco, were looking into a case that had just
n cited by a QUEEN’s Counsel, who had been in the act of addressin
them, . The junior, unconscious of the state of the case, fancied he had
found just the favourable opportunity to get a hearing, and creeping into
a back row, effected a tremendous clearance of his throat, with a view
to a sustained effort of eloquence. He had commenced, and got as far
as “If your Lordships please,” when the four Barons looked up with
the air of very discontented Barons; and the junior, having got the eyes
of the Court, believing he had also its ear, proceeded as follows:–
“I rise, my Lords, for the purpose—” Here he was interrupted b

ships, an intimation that only caused the determined “utter” to grow
bolder and more distinct in his utterance. He began again, “I rise,
my Lords,” and was once more cut short with “We can't hear you,
Sir,” from the Bench; which urged him to a stentorian effort of
startling vehemence; but “We can't, hear you now, Sir,” was all
he could elicit from the Bench, and he immediately left the court,
remarking that “he knew Justice was blind, but that its deafness was
something he was not prepared to combat with.”

—of voluntarily
- shirking their
duty if they thought that their diplomatic services could be of any service
whatever, and we can therefore only conclude they felt that they should
“do more harm than good”, in their diplomatic capacities--or, inca"
ities, as the case may be—had they remained at their posts during
ate events of interest. The EARL or WESTMoRELAND, we are told b
the Times, has been in London, as the best means of promoting, Britis
interests at Berlin; while LoRD Ponson BY—says the same authority-
our Ambassador of Vienna, has been serving his country by absence
from the scene of his duties. - - -
Our Chargé d'Affaires at Bad-en—the idea is a good 'un—has been
staying at Naples, and there have been other instances of our ".
matists acting on the straightforward, but startling principle, that
though paid very highly to represent England at a Foreign Court, they
are much better "omitted in the representation” when anything of
ticular urgency or of unusually vital interest is happening. If it is
}. that absence enhances the value of bassadors, how much
more economical it would be to keep them always away from their
osts—an arrangement which would have the double advantage of
eing much cheaper as well as more satisfactory. ...The hint...is one
which we have no doubt MR. Cobden and other financial reformers
will be able to improve upon. It would be a curious calculation could
the question be solved—if peace should be preserved in the absence of
the diplomatists from their posts, what would have been the conse:
quence had they remained at their embassies?
Testimonial to the Duke of Atholl.
A MEETING has been got up at Dunkeld for the purpose of sympa-
thising with the begrimed and bespattered DUKE of Atholl, unjustly
dirtied with printer's ink. The presiding operator was one John
Leslie, Esq., from the congenial place of Butterston. Many speeches
were made; and much of the ink attempted to be licked off; but,
somehow, his Grace is as black as ever—the ink will stick. It was,
however, finally resolved to present the Duke with a tangible testimo-
nial at once illustrative of the ducal virtues and of their admirers.
|The necessary sort of testimonial became a matter of intense consi-
deration; when it was finally settled, amid acclamations, to present
his Grace (for next autumn wear) with a faithful copy of the Victoria
stage costume of the Warlock of the Glen. NATHAN, the theatrical
tailor, started by a special train to take the Duke's measure.

HOW TO MAKE A SERJEANT.
THE manufacture of a serjeant is one of those mysteries of the law
which are not usually open to the vulgar eye; and the common im-
pression has been, that i. paying down of some thousand pounds for
the coiſ-in “Cash down, Sir, tho”—as the advertising crockery-
cart used to say, is all that is required. We have heard yarious other
ceremonies spºken of as necessary to the constitution of a serieant;
and among others we have been given to understand, that a Judge o
the Common Pleas putting up his eye-glass knowingly to his eye and
fixing it on the coiffee in embryo-exclaims with a jaunty air, f spy
a brother.” This judicial game at “Eye' spy I'll gives a sort of
pleasing jocularity to the process, which contrasts, rather powerfully
with the serious business of pulling out one thousand pounds—in cash /
—as the price of the dignity.
We have ascertained, However that although money makes the
man, it is not money alone makes the serjeant; for he is called upon
to exhibit his learning in a style somewhat similar to that, of the keen
encounter of their wits, between the law student and the butler, when
the former—over his beer—takes the degree of utter barrister.
Every one knows that a call to the Bar—at all events, at Gray's Inn
—is effected by the candidate for the forensic, toga imbibing a small
quantity of the very smallest of swipes, and declaring, at the same time,
that he “appears for the widow, and claims her dower,” while the
butler, taking the mug and the pleadings out of the student’s haud
announces himself as appearing for the heir, and the two learned
litigants at once proceed to the library. -
The ceremony of making MR. BARON MARTIN a serjeant, upon
making him—to the great satisfaction of everybody—a judge, was con-
ducted much in the following fashion:—MR. BARON MARTIN, reading
from an old bit of parchment, insisted rather calmly that John SMIth
claimed the lands, of which John DoE stood seised, and that John
Smith, being determined not to stand such a seisure, claimed the said
lands, or words to that effect. Upon this a shriek was heard from the
usher, who, starting up in his box, exclaimed with unusual briskness,
“I imparl,”—when some one else in the background growled ºut an
intimation that he “represented the widow; ” upon which MR. BARON
MARTIN, appearing to give up the case as hopeless with such antago;
mists arrayed against him, retired from the bar, as if in disgust and
despair of making any stand in the face of such powerful competition,
Happily, his retirement from the ranks of counsel was speedily followed
by his appearance as a Judge on the bench, to which the profession and
the public have unanimously welcomed him.
We all know that the last feather will occasion a smash to the back
bone of the camel; and we must, we suppose, imagine that it was
something of this sort which forced MR. MARTIN to yield under the
responsibility of his last brief, (with the usher, “imparling” on one
side, and a mysterious growler behind the back rows “representing
the widow,”) rather than “fight it out ’’ under such fearful odds. The
learned counsel abandons John SMITH,-leaves him at the mercy of
DoE,--to brave the terrors of an “imparlance,” and make the best
arrangement he can to pacity “the widow.” Happy are we that
MR. BARON MARTIN has found in the bench a refuge from such endless
sources of litigation, the widow alone being quite enough to drive any
peaceably disposed counsel to distraction.
COURT CIRCULAR.
(Such as Puseyism would, perhaps, like to read it.)
YESTERDAY morning, the QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT took their
accustomed walk on the slopes—with peas in their shoes.
His Roy AL HIGHNESS PRINCE ALBERT, attended by the REVEREND
MEssrs. Hoak ES AND BAM, walked out reading. The volume used
by his Roy AL HIGHN ESS was a highly illuminated legend relative to
St. SwitHIN. The PRINCE returned to no lunch at two o'clock, it
being Friday. -
LoRD John RussFLL left Town for Canterbury by an early train,
and, immediately on his arrival, repaired to the restored shrine of
St. Thomas A BECKETT, to partake of the discipline of the rod. Having
received a sound whipping, his Lordship returned to Town in the
evening, and had an interview with his medical man.
Mr. Punch did public penance in front of his office, in the presence
of a great crowd of spectators.
THREE TO ONE.
THE “Ladies' Companion” has a series of articles called “The Three
Ages of Woman.” We cannot help thinking that our graceful, enter-
taining contemporary has fallen into a strange ungallant error, for it is
too bad to give poor Woman “three ages,” when it is as much as she
can do to confess to one !
THE BULL FIGHT OF LONDON.
THE Guys are going through the streets, the chalk is on the walls;
Besides the usual twopence there's a charge in grave St. Paul's;
And surely any extra charge the fight will well repay,
For the London matador’s to fight the Roman Bull to-day.
A lusty blade’s our matador, with a deft and ready hand,
Right quick to turn, and face about, and sharp to shift his stand;
Two-edged and keen's the sword he wields, and though to dodge inclined,
There's mone knows better where to stick, when he makes up his mind.
The bells º out, the clerks they shout, as to his place he goes;
Firm and well-rounded shows his calf under the purple hose;
His apron is tucked up for work, his eye is clear and keen,
And his round bald head it shineth like polished marble clean.
Bring forth the Bull . . The Bull is brought, within the gazing ranks,—
Upon his head the triple crown, the red-hat on his flanks;
The leaden seal tied to his tail, wide-spreading are his horns—
The obvious joke about his hoofs the courteous minstrel scorns.
He bears him bold and burly, but the knowing ones espy
A something groggy in his legs, and glassy in his eye;
And though he chaſes and paws the ground, and bellows loud and long,
He's not the Bull that once he was, the Roman hills among.
He hath flung his broad brows to the ground, the matador to catch
On the horns of a dilemma, but I ween he’s met his match :
All vain the rush, the sidelong push—for one turn he can take,
The nimble son of London two turns, at least, doth make.
Panting at length, and shorn of strength, the baffled Bull is standing,
And turns an eye that obviously the reason is demanding,
Why this matador of London hath ta'en to welt and whack
The bull that a few years since he patted on the back?
To query mute the bothered brute of course gets no reply;
Forth he hath broke, a final stroke determined to let fly;
But on his heel in one short wheel the matador's at large,
And the Bull goes down, upon his crown, before the fatal charge
RAILWAY GREASF.
“Mr. HUDSON, on his last visit to Sunderland, was solicited by no
less than twenty-five of its poorest inhabitants to stand godfather to
their children. This is a pleasing proof of the very strong hold he
possesses upon the affections of his constituents.”—Newcastle Sycophant.
“A penny subscription has been started amongst the stokers
and guards on the Eastern Counties Railway, to erect a statue in
honour of a late lamented and much beloved Director. We need not
say we allude to the Railway King, M.R. Hudson, whose return to
power will be chronicled amongst the proudest events of the forth-
coming year.”—The York Friend.
“We have authority for stating that offers have been made to MR.
HUDsoN, in the name of the EMPEROR OF CHINA, to proceed instantly
to Pekin, with a view of consulting with his Celestial Majesty upon the
pºssibility of laying down a railway upon the Great Wall of China.
The expense, it is considered, would only consist of the outlay for the
iron and the engines, and a sum exceeding one million was offered to
MR. Hudson by a celebrated Manchester firm, if he would only secure
their establishment the Imperial contract. We are proud and happy
to state, however, that MR. IIUDsqN has refused all these tempting
offers, with the generous intention of concentrating his entire attention
upon railway matters at home, which we are sorry to see suffering more
and more every week from his prolonged absence, and which must end
in the fearful ruin of all parties, unless MR. Hudson is immediately
called in to avert the impending evil.”—Manchester Peeler.
“A Director of the Caledonian Railway sent M R. Hudson, last
week, a brace of grouse; and it was only the week before that he
received, from one of the largest holders of shares in the same line, a
hamper packed full of game. These little presents are flattering evi-
dence of the high trust which all persons who have invested their fortunes
in railways repose in MR. Hudson, and show too strongly how pleased
the entire body of shareholders of the Caledonian Railway would be if
the ex-Railway King would but consent to undertake the management
of their hopeless affairs.”—The Cannie Scotsman.
“MR. Hudson entertained, on Monday last, 300 Railway Directors,
at his princely mansion in Hyde Park. The only topic of conversation
was the universal regret that MR. HuDSON had so long absented
himself from railway matters, and a lively hope was generally expressed
that he would soon return to power, and resume the powerful position
he once so proudly occupied, as the BARING of the Stock Exchange,
and the Rothschild of Capel Court. In such a wish all honourable
men must sincerely concur.”—Railway Weekly Buffer.

CLIMATES FOR ALL NATIONS.
NDouBTEDLY it is a great pity
that the Exhibition of 1851 was
not thought of earlier! All na-
tions will of course throng to
the display of their own industry.
A most serious #. is, how
to lodge them. This might easily
have been solved by MR. PAxton
with sufficient time. He can
grow the indigenous plants of any
country in his glass-houses. It
is evidently, as easy to imitate
natural conditions for an animal
as for a plant. By a well-con-
trived arrangement of large con-
servatories, every human being
under the sun might have been
accommodated with his own cli-
mate. The inhabitant of the
tropics might have been sur-
rounded by tropical fruits and
vegetation, and snakes also, if
required. The East Indian might have had his home near a jungle,
with the option of tigers. With the valuable assistance of DR. FARADAY
(who can freeze water for you in a red-hot crucible), the Norwegians,
Laplanders, and Esquimaux might have been domiciled amid icebergs
º white bears, in regions, to all intents and purposes, perfectly
ctic.
We might have given the Egyptian his Nile and crocodiles, and
the Arabian his Desert, with a mirage for *º and pro-
vided with everything but simooms to make him eeſ quite at
home. California is the only land which would defy imitation. The
composition of the soil of that Tom-Tidlerian territory would be rather
§: º—unles Rothschild would be liberal enough to supply
the needful.
At all events, however, physiologists might avail themselves of
MR. PAxton's contrivances, in order to the determination of the con-
troversy as to whether or no climate produces the diversities of the
human race. Why—but that the women of England are the loveliest
in the world—should we not rear young ladies under glass, and see if
we cannot grow Circassian beauties?
POPERY IN PIMLICO.
It has been rumoured that, in the event of PIUs THE NINTH being
obliged once more to run away from Rome, he will emigrate to Pimlico
and make Belgravia the future residence of the Popes. Lodgings will
be taken in Wilton Place, as a substitute for the Vatican, and the
Church of St. Barnabas will require very little alteration in its cere-
monies to render it as acceptable to Pio NoNo as St. Peter's itself.
The “histrionics” will of course be continued as usual, though a few
more supernumeraries will be required for the processions, and there
wil an augmentation of candles, so that the managers of the
mummery maybe enabled to avail themselves of the great Vauxhall
attraction of so many “additional lights.” NATHAN, the costumier, has
received orders for the º of “entirely new dresses,” and the
… º man” at Astley's is understood to be working night and day
for the completion of the decorations, which are expected to surpass
everything since the celebrated Jewess season at Drury Lane.
Rehearsals are taking place every morning, and several of the weaker-
minded laity allow themselves to be introduced as lay figures into the
spectacles that are being got up, pro bono Pimlico, almost every day.
War without a Wherefore.
HITHER.To we have been undoubting advocates of international
arbitration; but we really almost question whether it could be resorted
to, for the settlement of the dispute between Prussia and Austria.
What is the war-cry?—what is the bone of contention?—what great
principle is at issue?. What controversy is there for any arbitrator to
arbitrate upon It is a pity some pacific salve, some sort of antisan-
guinary, antipugnacious antidiabolical emollient cerate could not be
invented to allay that itching for mutual murder which afflicts most
of the nations of the Continent.
THE QUICKEST way. To Rome.

all roads none will take you there so quickly as the small Tracts that

ELEVEN WORDS ON TOLERATION.
BY DR. NEWMAN.
AMONG various reasons which induce the British public to oppose
the Pops or RQME's attempt at domination in this country, is the per-
suasion, derived from history, that in times past, the Pope's Church,
when possessed of ascendancy, burnt alive, racked, and tortured, or
caused and procured to be burnt alive, and so forth, a considerable
number of human beings, for what it was pleased to heresy.
To us, this persuasion appears as certain as the assurance that
WILLIAM THE CoNQUEROR subdued England, that Richard TURPIN
committed highway robbery, that SIR HuMºHRy Davy invented the
safety-lamp, or that, Mr. THISTLEwood was for high treason.
And is it all the while merely a monstrous fallacy? Is the very type in
which we read of atrocities, whose catalogue is too jº"for
quotation, unreal. In thinking we see letters and words narrating such
roastings and rackings, perpetrated, by states, and sovereigns, at the
- Church, are we, possibly, the victims of some
delusion of the Enemy, imposing upon our own senses with pica which
is not? Or are we º mad? That the common impression on this
. at any rate is false, is, so roundly asserted by nearly all the
apologists of his Holiness, that, Mr. Punch might almost begin to
doubt of its correctness, if he could be talked into scepticism as to the
existence of a nose in his face. But, with the best spectacles on that
nose, Mr. Punch still reads the same horrible º
In reference to those who accuse the Pope's C -
the Rev. DR. Doyle, according to the Times of the 18th instant, spoke,
on the preceding day, as follows:–
“They talk of the edict of QuerN MARY, and lay it at the door of the Catholic clergy.
I deny that it is true; and I refer our detractors to that history which they so wilfully
pervert. . . . . Now, the true version of QUEEN MARY's edict, in connection with the
Catholic clergy, is this: on the very day that that edict was sent forth, that great, and
good, and fearless friar, Alphonze Dr CASTRo, when he preached before the Court, in
the presence of HER MAJEsty, denounced it as most intolerant, unjust, and in every
degree opposed to the glorious principles and spirit of the holy religion.”
... Would it not have been more to DR. Doyle's purpose to have said—
if he could have said—that the Popº denounced and condemned QUEEN
MARY and her fagots? That he did not, was an unfortunate omission,
we will say. , Well; there is time to repair it. Will the present Pope,
authoritatively, and er cathedrá, condemn and anathematise the doctrine
that it is, or ever was, lawful for Christian men to burn, or otherwise
kill, or torture anybody for heresy?. It is surely worth, his while to
annihilate a prejudice, entertained by millions of Englishmen, against
his Church, at the small expense of a “bull” so very short that it would
rather deserve the epithet of “brief.”
In the meantime, what can be said to DR. Doy LE” Eleven words:–
“IN THE Middle AGES THE CHURCH PUT to DEATH For HERESY!"
These are not the words of Mr. Punch ; they are the words of John
HENRY NEwMAN, Priest of the Oratory of St. PHILE NEEI. They
occur in a lecture delivered by him on the “Political State ºf Catholic
Countries No Prejudice to the Sanctity of the Church.” London: BURNs
AND LAMBERT: page 208 of Lecture VIII., bought by Mr. Punch at
MR. Richardson’s, over the way, up the street, for the sum of one
shilling current and lawful coin of this realm. -
The reader is besought to refer to the sentence in which the above
words occur, to see that Mr. Punch has not suppressed anything which
could soften them or explain them away.
Mr. Punch does not quote the words of DR. NewMAN, against those
of DR. Doyle to fix persecuting tenets on any individual Catholic.
He does not mean to insinuate that CARDINAL WISEMAN would wish
to roast ARchbishop SUMNER, or that the present DUKE of Norfolk
would like to preside over a Smithfield Stake Club. Mr. Punch
merely means to say, that if, as DR. NEwMAN confesses—
“IN THE MIDDLE Ages the CHURCH PUT to DEATH Fort HERESY;"
and if the Church is infallible, and cannot make a mistake, it may
rsecute-whether to the death or short of the death—again. There-
ore, that it is not to be trusted; and, though tolerated to the fullest
extent, must be resolutely denied the sanction of titles of honour
derived from any districts within the bounds of Jolly Old England.
In the meantime, Mr. Punch begs thinking persons to observe how
very widely “Doctors”—even Roman Doctors—“differ.”
A NEW TITLE FOR DR. WISEMAN.
It has been suggested by a wit—the writer of this paragraph—that
his Imminence would be a better title than his Eminence, for the New
Cut Cardinal; inasmuch as the insult contemplated by the Pope has
been hanging over us, and has been, therefore, imminent for a long
time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INCREASED ATTRACTION.—INCREASED PAY.
Cheapside, Nov. 10th.
DMIRED SIR-I have a nu-
merous family of godchildren,
It is my custom on the 9th
of November to invite all my
little, charges, to the large
warehouse I have in Cheap-
side, so that they may see the
Lord Mayor's Show. During
the intervals of the proces-
sion, we amuse ourselves with
romps and games, and buns
and cakes, sweetened with
the weakest negus.
“Well, Sir, this year I
thought I would vary the
games a little, and that, in-
stead of a romp in the ware-
house, we would have an
instructive stroll through St.
Paul's Cathedral. . I longed
to point to the admiring gaze
of my young troop the great
incil º their country, and
accordingly had been busy
reading up all the morni
my History of England an
SöUTHEY's Life of Nelson, in
order to be able to dilate with, proper enthusiasm upon the noble
deeds º had done. Well, Sir-for I am an old man with the
gout, and feel I get on but slowly—we started on our merry
trip. I #". twenty-pence in my pocket, for we were ten in number.
It was all in coppers, for I like fo give the money-takers the trouble
—it's a little pleasure I have—of counting them. Well, I presented
the twenty-pence all in coppers; they were . pushed aside.
‘It’s all right,' I said, with all the respect I could summon, for some-
how it does put me in a rage to be compelled to pay for admission to
my own cathedral; ‘we are ten of us, and ten persons at two-pence a-
piece, may I be allowed to remark, makes exactly twenty-pence.”
“‘It’s no such thing,” he said, with the customary rudeness of all
money-takers. . ‘It’s five shillings.” “How's that?' I inquired,
mastering, my indignation. “Impossible!’. ‘Impossible or not, you
must É. it, or you don't goin. I tell you it's five shillings.”
“‘But how do you make it out, Sir,’ for I was ſº angry.
g- 'Why, We ALWAYs CHARGE sixPENCE A-HEAD on LöRD MAYoR's
DAY " '
“So, Sir, because there was a little additional attraction, the prices
were raised. A play-house, I believe, only doubles its price when there
is some unheard of performance to justify it; but here was a Cathedral
trebling its rate of admission, because the Lord Mayor's procession
happened to pass round it. I asked the impudent official if the charge
was made with the sanction of the Dean and Chapter, and he answered
me more impudently than ever, that ‘it was.”
“I refused, with a long protest, to pay the imposition, which caused
the door to be slammed in my face, and I was compelled to walk back
again to Cheapside with my little troop, who were sucking their thumbs
with disappointment. All my morning's reading went for nothing!
“My only remedy, Sir, is to write to you. i. of you to use every
pen you have in º this scandalous state of things till it is fairly
carted away, like so much noxious filth, from the City of London.
- “I remain, Dear Sir,

“P.S.. If there is an advance of prices, public information, at all
events, should be given of the fact. I should not be surprised—at all
events it would be more tradesman-like to do it—to see next year a
placard like the following, hung over every door of the cathedral:—

HOUSEHOLD SONGS.
No. 1.-The Song of the Poker.
I’M a sturdy poker, and all the day,
By the side of the fire I take my place,
And whenever I stir I throw a ray
Of cheerful light on every face.
Of the coal's black looks I make a joke,
A light in its heart I can always raise;
In the ribs of the fire I give a poke
And out it bursts in a laughing blaze.
'Tis not in the summer, when all around
Is wrapp'd in the warmth the sun supplies,
That the poker's real worth is found,
As in polish’d state he coldly lies.
But oh! when the winter's frost sets in,
And abroad in the fields you no longer roam;
Oh, then is the time when we all begin
To find in the poker a friend at home.
No. 2.-The Song of the Shovel.
THEY may talk as they will of the poker and tongs,
Their merit to neither stern justice denies;
But surely superior credit belongs
To the shovel, which furnishes all the supplies.
How useless the poker—with nothing to poke,
Its best occupation were utterly gone.
On the coals in a scuttle how vain were the stroke,
Till I to the fire have shovell'd them on.
Still sweeter the office I often fulfil,
Preventing the coal from burning in vain,
And showing there’s virtue in humbleness still,
By throwing up cinders again and again.
Thus charity raises from out of the dust
The good that may still with its particles blend;
And the shovel, by forming of cinders a crust,
Endows them with brilliance and warmth to the end.
No. 3.-The Song of the Tongs.
THEY may daddy-long-legs dub me,
My shape they may deride,
But they want me—though they snub me,
To grace the fire-side.
The shovel unreflectin
Throws fuel on by foals,
I’m useful in selecting
The choicest of the coals.
To every hut and hovel
The poker it belongs,
And common is the shovel—
But very rare the tongs.
Pride is, I know, delusive,
Of worth 'tis ne'er the sign;
Although to be exclusive
Maybe a boast of mine.
But hence with idle boasting,
Let’s terminate our songs,
By altogether toasting
Poker—and shovel—and tongs.
THE NEW “CULLEN'S PRACTICE OF PHYSIC.”
THE President and Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians have
sent, an address to the QUEEN Hº: her to take measures for
repelling the Papal aggression. The learned doctors declare their
unalterable attachment to our Constitution in Church and State. The
interest, therefore, which they take in the Constitution is more exten-
sive than some people might, suppose. However, we do not notice
their anti-papal address for the mere purpose of making this very
obvious remark. Physicians have peculiar cause for being opposed to
Popish domination. The medical profession boasts of a DR. CULLEN,
who wrote a renowned Practice of Physic. Should another DR. CULLEN's
system get the upper hand, a new CULLEN's Practice of Physic might
become popular, to the great loss and detriment of the Faculty. There
can be no doubt that if the sun is, but two yards in diameter, all
diseases are curable by saint’s toe-nails, or other relics. The establish-
ment of this principle will quite revolutionise the Materia Medica;
calomel, colocynth, and tartrate of antimony, will be entirely super-
seded by holy shin and other bones, and fragments of thaumaturgic
mummies, miraculous old clothes, and canonised rags. No medicine,
indeed, will be taken any more; Apothecaries' Hall be ruined, and the
Doctors’ occupation gone !

THE BERLIN CHOIR TO THE WARS HAVE GONE.
WE have heard of military bands, but a military chorus is something
quite new, and the Berlin choir is the first specimen we recollect of a
body of men, under, a concert engagement here, finding themselves
suddenly disconcerted by being called upon to enter into a military
engagement with the enemy. Our own British chorus-singer is such a
É. y peaceful animal, that though you may encase him in pasteboard
uckler, gird him with a property sword, and put, the most martial
language into his mouth; though he might be made to scream with the
utmost power of his lungs,
“For liberty or glorious death
We gladly yield our latest breath,”
yet º knows that he attends to no other call than the call to
rehearsal, and he draws the sword for no other purpose than to enable
him to draw his salary.
It seems, however, to be a much more serious business with the
Berlin chorus singers, who have not only to scream under a banner, but
to fight under one also, and they are liable to be forced to practise what
they sing, when called upon to do so by their Government. We pity
the poor Berlin, choir, who have suddenly been summoned from the
heat of Her Majesty's Theatre to the heat of battle; or, at all events,
to the chance of very warm work; and we cannot help thinking it was
adding insult to misfortune, to insert in the programme, “Home, sweet
Home,” which they were obliged to sing at a time when the prospect of
going home must have been very far from agreeable. Though our native
chorus singers run the risk of being cut up by criticism, they are,
at all events, safe from the sword; .# we congratulate them on their
pound a-week in peace and quietness, which is much better than getting
called out to fight by way of an annual benefit.
ANIMAL SPIRITS OF THE CHURCH.
THE Bishop of Oxfoºp has written several letters, signed B. Qxon.,
in answer to addresses from his clergy calling upon him to take the
chair at meetings to be held in opposition to the Papal aggression.
These letters breathe a spirit of indignation at the cº of the See
of Rome, and, in fact, from the style of writing Oxon., would seem to be
infuriated Oxon. against the Pope's Bull.
ExTREME MILDNEss of THE SEAsON.— CARDINAL WISEMAN's
Appeal to the People of England.
MOVE ON, THERE!
THE Chancery Bar, and the Chancery suitors, also, are in a state of
some tribulation at the slow progress made in the ford Chancellor's
Court, in consequence of the extreme length of the deliberations of the
present occupant of the Woolsack. A reference to the reports in the
newspapers will show that a column or two of argument from the Bar
is followed by an announcement from the Chancellor, that he wi
“take the papers home,” or “deliver his judgment on a future day;”
but it very rarely happens that an actuaſ decision is chronicled.
Sometimes his lordship will “consult the minutes”—an operation that
often involves not merely minutes, but hours—and while the judicial
grass is growing—if we may use the allegory—the forensic horse is
starving for want of a fresh supply of provender.
Caution and deliberation are excellent qualities in a new Chancellor,
no doubt; but the barristers complain bitterly of the comparatively
small amount of business got through; and some of the older ones
declare they are now reminded of the days of the Eldon slow coach,
#. the introduction of the Fast BRough AM, and the CottenHAM
gence.

WE select the following bit of military trading from a Brighton Paper.
It may be called the latest transaction in the |
“MART of Glory.—It is confidently reported in military circles that the large sum
of £16,000 has been offered by the major of a lancer regiment for the purchase of the
lieutenant-colonelcy, and refused, after two days' deliberation.”
So an English gentleman becomes a lieutenant-colonel, not by merit
but by *ś the force of his pocket, and not the intelligence of |
his head. The ladder by which an Englishman mounts to military pro-
motion is a Ladder of Gold. £16,000 to be a lieutenant-colonel !

worship which inspired the British Army Quadrille might find farther
expression in a similar work of genius, composed in honour of a
kindred service. The Metropolitan Police Force is a valuable body ºf
men, to whom such homage would be highly appropriate, whilst it would
be equally gratifying to a Public which is even more loyal and con-
stitutional than it is musical...We can almost fancy that we hear the
great composition by which M. JULLIEN might glorify our gallant con-
stabulary. A brisk, lively opening indicates the alacrity of the
men mustering at the Station. A measured movement of the kettle-
drums represents the º: the various, divisions along the kerb-
stones. The air, “Oh, the Roast Beef ºf Old England,” is now intro-
duced, to signify the descent of the policeman from his beat into the
area, to meet his cook. This is suddenly interrupted by the Rogue's
March, to which succeeds “’Twas in Trafalgar's Bay,” indicating the
hero's return to the street under a sense of duty, recollecting the ex-
hortation of NELson. “The Horn of Chase” now betokens the pursuit
of a pickpocket, whose flight is expressed by rapid passages on the
piccolò; all the wind and stringed instruments join in the hue and
cry; and the capture of the depredator is denoted by a thump on the
big drum. The well-known air of “We won't go Home till Morning”
now informs us that some tipsy medical students are retiring from the
Coal Hole; a sudden crash explains that a lamp has been smashed by |
the roysterers, and that the police have seized them; a regular row then
ensues, greated by the whole strength of the orchestra, in which the
ophicleides and gongs are tremendously*. their effect being
heightened by watchmen's rattles and small pieces of artillery. In con-
clusion, the National Anthem declares the triumph of HERMAJESTY's
officers. Here are some ideas for, a Metropolitan Police, Force

DRAMAS FOR EVERY-DAY LIFE.
WE have been told—till we are tired of hearing the information—
that “All the World’s a Stage,” yet, when we look around us, we
find no dramas of every-day life written expressly for “all the men and
women” who “are only players.” The social members of the sock
must find themsºves much embarrassed occasionally by the want of a
repertoire, and if they really do “ º many parts,” their Acting must
consist of what, in the language of the green-room, is called “gag;”
inasmuch as there is nothing “set down for them,” and consequently
however anxious they might he to adhere to Hamlet's rule, they would
find it impossible to do so. Taking pity upon our fellow actors on the
great stage of the world, who are in the dilemma so commonly com-
plained of by the professional players, who are always lamenting that
they have no pieces written expressly for them, we have undertaken
the task of writing a few dramas of every-day life, for performance by
“all the men and women” whom SHARspeARE has lumped into one
great dramatic . -
We have no doubt the actors, like a discontented ungrateful set as
they are, will declare that the parts we offer them are not half
enough, but we nevertheless rushinto the perils of authorship regardless

A TESTIMONIAL MOT TO GEORGE HUDSON.
TheRE will now, we take it, never be a testimonial erected to his late
Majesty, GEORGE, of Iron memory-GEORGE HUDson. , Never again
. the plate go round in honour of that overthrown, bit of royalty.
Nevertheless, we have to propose a testimonial that, whilst it shall, in
some measure, palliate the meanness and folly that clubbed together to
glorify the dethroned king-shall commemorate his peculiar fame, by
good service done to one of his victims. MR. Doy LE, one of the pro-
prietors of the heekly Chronicle, appears ab pt, under an examina-
tion that only serves to test and show his honourable dealings. Well;
MR. Doyle states, on oath, that the persecution that drives him into a
Court of Bankruptcy originated in the fact, that—
“He, as editor, refused to allow the Weekly Chronicle to be corrupted by inserting a
defence of MR. George Hudson, written by his son-in-law, Mr. SEYMoUR. He firmly
believed he should not now be in the Bankruptcy Court if it were not for his refusal to
insert that defence, and to be corrupted. He would not consent to the Weekly Chronicle
being made the tool of MR. GEohge Hudson.”
An honourable man will not consent that his newspaper ink shall be
made to do the part of fuller's-earth, and take out spots—the late
Spotted Boy was nothing to look at when compared with the many
wicked specks that may give blackness to an adult dealer in railways–
an editor will not suffer black to be called white; will not praise ebony
as ivory; and he is harassed into bankruptcy. He is a truthful guardian
of the press, and he is ruined.
Now, what we ask is a testimonial for MR. Doyle—a testimonial
subscribed by the parties who laid down their thousands for HUDson.
We ask—say, two. and sixpence in the pound. What could be a
leasanter bit of self-imposed penance? A. B. C. have each subscribed
or HUDSON-say £80 a-piece; well, let them, to sweeten the unseemly
memory of the fact, subscribe £10 each to the account of MR. Doyle.
The ex-king has been gilt inch thick—shall there not be even half-
crowns for his ex-Majesty's victim P
Pope's Essay on (Wise) Man.
It is an old saying, that “What’s one man's meat is another man's
poison;” and the truth has lately been exemplified by the different
reception given in England and France to the news of the Pope having
sent to these countries new Cardinals. Louis-NAPOLEoN in his
“message,” the length of which is the only republican thing just now
in France, calls the grant of three Cardinals by the Pope, “an eminent
proof of gratitude towards the nation;'' whereas we in England regard
the gift of one Cardinal in a very different light, and could have dis-
pensed, so well with the present, that we wish the Pope, while giving
the eminent trio to France, had thrown the “little one in,” in the
shape of Doctor WisemAN. “What is sauce for the Goose” the
proverb tells us, “is sauce for the Gander.” But however well
the Pope's sauce may agree with the Gallic cock it does not at all
suit the British Lion.
SIR JOHN ROSS'S PIGEONS.
-
WE have awaited until doubt ripened into truth, ere we spoke of the
arrival of SIR, John Ross's pigeons at their native home at
Hill, near Kilmarnock, Scotland. These birds were originally the
property of Miss DUNLoP, and that lady bestowed them on SIR John
Ross, who bound himself by knightly promise to liberate the birds as
soon as he should have been comfortably frozen in his winter quarters.
And here are two of the birds—for SIR John Ross took two pair with
him—again in Scotland. They have been examined by PROFEssoR MAC-
TARTANCLAN, the distinguished Glasgow philosopher, and he considers
that they evince unmistakeable symptoms of having been, for some
time, domesticated with the Esquimaux; the birds picking up bits of
chopped tallow candles with hyperborean gusto. He has moreover tried
them with a water ice, which they relished most mincingly. , No dove of
a young lady, after her twentieth quadrille, could have taken it more
prettily. The birds have become national pets, and with very great reason.
Scotland, has cause to be proud of them; inasmuch as they have
beautifully demolished a most ungenerous prejudice. And for this, the
birds are fed upon the sweetest of sweetpeas everyday, with a sprinkling
of peppercorns on Sundays and holidays. Further, when the pigeons
die, they will be stuffed and preserved under domes of crystal, and
treasured in the future Museum of Edinburgh; as real, unmistakeable
evidence of the patriotic fact, that natives of Scotland, once flitted from
º lº have been known—and that of their own free will—to
return to it.

BUSINESS AND THE BAYONET.
* T Birmingham the lamb has
* looked into the cannon's mouth;
the Peace Society has had a
meeting. The dove has cooed
and cooed, and the proving-
house has re-echoed with the
bang-bang of fire-arms. Men
- Z have listened to the old meta-
º º phor that crooks the sword into
- Tº º the sickle, and then went away
to forge new swords the next
morning. And this proved,
ought not the orators
to be all the prouder of their
audience? Are we to expect the
sword-smiths of Birmingham,
and all the other artificers who
make of iron the instruments
of agony and death, to renounce
their trade in order to prove
their hatred of aggressive war?
Are they to starve, that they
may practically protest against
a system that, within the last
two years, according to MR.
CoBDEN, has burthened the na-
tions of the Continent with debts
and losses to the amount of
two hundred millions? Do the legislators of the civilised world
demand such sacrifices of the workers? It is to pay their virtue some-
what too hard a compliment. Nevertheless, that the question of Peace
should be debated in Birmingham, the arsenal—debated to approving
thousands—marks the steady advance of the pacific º e. The
gunsmiths, though livi #y the trade of war, did not exclaim
“Down with STURGE and Cobdex 1 Great is the BELLONA of Bir-
mingham l’”
... Mr. Coppen very happily tore to tatters the miserable sophism, that
it was justifiable to make war, in order to increase commerce—to push
business at the point of the bayonet. Commerce, it is true, has followed
war; nevertheless, we would not have an account opened even with
Japan with howitzers. Bayonets work an ugly kind of treble entry;
nor would we have that Manchester dream fulfilled, that vision that
shows that every Chinaman in a night-cap of cotton is to be realised by
the percussion caps of English infantry. And yet, evidently, there are
commercial men who believe that, with the foreigner, the best and
sharpest of bargains may be made with the sword, stropped on the
binding of a ledger.
Neyertheless, the writer in Chambers's Information—the essayist
chastised by Cobden–has opened a grand idea that, if not to be
carried out in Japan by means of seventy-fours, soldiers and marines
may, in a small degree, be familiarised to us, in London, or even in
Edinburgh. ...What it is lawful for armies to do in order to force trade,
it may, for the benefit of our imports and exports, be allowable to
individual firms and shop-keepers. For instance, London next summer
will be thronged with foreigners—many of them possibly as wilfully
obtuse to the excellencies F. mºtº. as are the Japanese to
our very thickest Whitney blankets, and our best-finished skates.
Why, then, should not the MEssrs. Noses—for the civilising benefits
of trade—be permitted to have a company of their own, in uniforms of
their own shade and pattern, a corps of the Israelovsky's, (old
SuwałRow once formed such a body), who, without a word, should lay
hold upon any foreigner, and carrying him to their Mart, command him
to get rid at once of his cash and his barbarian ignorance P Why
should they not compel him to be measured, and there pay down the
|
|- º Kº - º g
money for the half-dozen suits of clothes, considered barely decent-
the savage—for his necessities? What would be right in Japan, would
be no less right in the Ghetto of the Minories—what lawful with the
edge of the sword, no less lawful at the point of the needle?
Again, with the weaker sex. Let us have corps of light linendrapers,
of lancer mercers, of hussar jewellers, skirmishing the streets of London,
and—for the civilisation i enlightenment of foreign women—let them
compel her to take, and her husband to pay for—or if a spinster, her
rent or guardian—any quantity of muslins, silks, velvets, pearls and
monds. Poor creatures! With no taste, no desire for such raiment
and finery—what real benefit will be exercised, by the compulsion that
makes them customers?
It appears a Peace Congress will be held in the Crystal Palace. . Why
not ?, "We take foreign Princes to show them rocket, practice in
Woolwich Marshes: let foreign peoples, with the world's works of
eace before them, listen to words that shai preach a world-wide amity.

TELEGRAPHIC TARADIDDLES.
UNCH is far from wishing to under-rate the
value of the Telegraph, or to discourage the
enterprising spirit of the newspaper pro-
prietors, who keep steamers with their steam
perpetually up in the Boulogne Harbour;
# and an express train always in readiness at
# Folkstone, to bring to London the latest
Continental news, but it will occasionally
happen that the jeu is not worth the candle,
or rather the s consumed in keeping up
the fires of the engines. On rushing eagerly
to the heading of “Second” or “Third
Edition” in a morning paper, our curiosity
and excitement are often doomed to be repaid
by such intelligence as the following:—
“It was .. in Paris when our-
express left, and there seemed no prospect of
the weather clearing up very speedily. The
President of the Republic was still at the
Elysée, and a º was just being made in the National Assembly,
to allow leave of absence to MonsLEUR BETISE, who represents a dis;
tant department. Nothing grave was attached to this incident; and
though there were a few º hanging about the Passage de
l’Opera, prices were not affected. From Germany, says our Corre-
ndent, there is absolument rien—positively nothing—“unless” he
adds, “the fact of several Hessians having, been seen to walk in
pairs through the streets, may be found interesting by your
readers.”
“Welearn from another source that Austria remains where it did, and
Prussia's position on the map of Europe, has not yet been modified.”
Of course our daily contemporaries, when they have hired an express
train, chartered a steamer to remain always with her steam up, and
prepared to start, whether there is anything worth starting for or not.—
of course, we º: our contemporaries must give ºf by way of
news, under the head of their second or third editions; but we beg
leave to suggest in a truly friendly, spirit, that, we think the greater
part of the information contained in these editions, would keep ex-
tremely well for a few hours, and the cost of a newspaper fleet with

would be likely to prove successful). Good gracious !

MR. Jones's hats on a pitchfork, and stick it up the wash-house
chimney, they might think we had the sweeps.
Sally (taking her orders with compressed lips, and other symptoms of
great energy). Yes, 'm. |
Er-Unprotected (struck by a bright idea). And, SALLY, bring me the
DINNER-BELL. I’ll take it to bed with me !
Sally (jumping at the notion). Oh yes, 'm; and if the burglars gets
in, and we hears the bell— - -
Er-Unprotected (courageously). You can rush to my assistance.
Sally (rather taken aback). Uh, 'm, then we’d all be murdered.

Oh, dear! Oh, dear! SALLY, you're a wicked girl, to put such things
into one's head. I never did hear any one talk so. |

unutterable agony of terror).

RULES FOR THE PREVENTION OF THE PROMISED
PLAGUE NEXT YEAR.
THE arguments of the old women, and that of several newspapers
advocating the fears of the same class, that the invasion of foreigners
next year is sure to be followed by a second Plague of London, are so
convincing, that we are glad to hear some measures are at last to be
taken for the prevention of the evil. A quarantine will be established,
by which every foreigner will be compelled to remain eight-and-forty
hours in some place of salubrity before he is allowed to enter the
Metropolis. We rejoice to state, that Herne Bay has been one of the
places honoured with selection. A supplementary Board of Health is
also to be instituted, for the examination of all foreigners. For carry-
ing out this sanitary purpose, they are to be invested with the most
searching powers.
The following are a few of the rules, unanimously agreed upon, for
their guidance in this delicate matter:—
1- That every Frenchman is to be washed from head to foot before
entering London. For this purpose, Foreign Baths and hyashhouses are
to be established in every suburb round the Metropolis.
2- That no German is to be allowed admission into “the first city in
the world” (the term generally used at all the London dinners), unless
he can prove possession of at least six shirts, as many stockings, and
two clean collars.
3. That two pounds of yellow soap will be presented to eve
foreigner, without favour or distinction, honouring the metropolis wit
his presence next year. For this purpose, a “Foreigners’ Charitable
Soap Fund” will be instantly instituted, and subscriptions are urgently
solicited for the carrying out of this benevolent idea.
.4. That every foreigner must bring a certificate of good health from
his medical man, signed and witnessed by the clergyman of his parish.
5. That no foreigner will be ...] into London, under any pre-
tence whatever, unless he can prove, by authentic marks about his
person, that he has been vaccinated.
6. That camphor-bags will be given away twice a-week in Hyde Park,
to all suspicious foreigners, and that placards will be printed in every
language of the world and largely distributed in the neighbourhood of
the Exhibition, warning all easy confiding foreigners, as they value
their lives, against the purchase of any Patent Life. Pills.
With these stringent precautions it is to be hoped that the evil will
have less room and less chance of displaying itself; and that if the
Plague should break . at all events that we shaji have every remedy|h
already prepared to enable us to arrest it at once in its fatal progress.
With these inspiriting prospects, old women may remain in London
during the memorable year of 1851, with (under the alarming circum-
stances) the greatest possible amount of safety.
CHANGE FOR A BULL.
“DEAR PUNCH,
- “THERE are some people in England who think MR. WISEMAN
right; and that we ought not to be in any way angry because the Pope
chooses to dip a British subject in Cardinal scarlet, conferring on him a
*: without consulting an English Potentate upon that very trifling
matter.
“Very well. But if these good, easy people be as right as they are
good and easy, let them allow HER Esty QUEEN Victor LA a little
hit of ſºil.play. And permit me to make this proposition to the QUEEN's
Council. Table; a proposition that, no doubt, will, in the rightful spirit
of retaliation, be duly adopted. It is simply this (to be strengthened
by a public petition).
“Let the QUEEN be prayed to create SIGNOR MAzzINI President of
Rºme; conferring other corresponding dignities on his adherents and
followers.
“I beg further to recommend that HERMAJESTY be petitioned to use
her kindly offices with the French President, that he may cause to be
withdrawn the French forces from the Roman Capital.
. “I am no casuist, Mr. Punch—I am no polemic—I am no Revolu-
tionist—but this I am—
“A LovER OF FAIR PLAY.”
The Wiseman Paradise.
N. WISEMAN speaks of the “little Paradise” that, under the in-
fluence of his Church, might be all around Westminster Abbey? There
can remain no doubt of the fact upon every just and reflecting mind
that has beheld the perfect Eden that lies all about St. Peter's at Rome.
BISHOPS AND LOBSTERS.
THERE is no doubt that some bishops may bear an affinity to lobsters.
Take the Bishºp of ExETER as an example. He was so long in hot
water, that he began to turn a little scarlet.
NEW STYLE OF REVIEW IN HYDE PARK.
It is understood that the Great Exhibition to be held next year in
Hyde Park, will be succeeded by an indefinite series of similar exhibi-
tions, in the same locality. These, however, will consist exclusively in
the display of the productions of native industry. A strong impression
is supposed to have been created in a high quarter, by the following
remarks which fell, the other day, from MR. BRIGHT:-
“If the relatives of a Prince—in all the relations of life an amiable and worthy
gentleman, and deserving of high respect—visited this country, what amusements were
offered 2 A review in Hyde Park.”
The absurdity of treating our iſſustrious visitors to a game of soldiers,
as a matter of course, as if warfare were necessarily the most interesting
subject to all princes, it is said, has been recognised. The perception
has been arrived at, that to show a King, or other royal person, a sham
fight, intended to divert him as such, implies the assumption that com-
bativeness and destructiveness must be the biggest bumps on his head;
that he must go about in a state of pugnacious irritability, of sanguinary
prurience—itching to instigate charges of bayonets, longing to fli
shrapnel-shells and grape-shot, burning to cannonade and bombard, an
to lead on mankind to hack, hew, cut, thrust, slash, stab, and assassinate.
To pay this species of polite attention, it has been discovered, is equi;
valent to intimating that the genius of Royalty is that of the Royal
tiger, and that the love of carnage is the nature of the beast.
In short, it is acknowledged that to exhibit a Review to a King or a
Prince involves precisely the same compliment that you would pay a
gentleman by getting up a dog-fight for his amusement. In future,
therefore, all the Reviews held in Hyde Park, or elsewhere, for the
entertainment of our royal guests will be Reviews of Industry, in
expression of the principle that the welfare of nations is the chief
consideration of rulers. The illustrious personages whom the QUEEN
shall delight to honour, will be º with a grand muster of the
trades; a muster to be associated with no roll but the baker's, with no
files, but those of artisans. It is now seen that we fight, merely as we
punish, from stern necessity, not for “glory;” and that, if we are to
parade our troops and weapons of war, we might just as well show
off our JACK KETCHES and gibbets.
A PHYSICAL FORCE PAPIST.
DoEs anybody know what has become of poor little CUFFY P. Has
e seen the error of seditious ways, and the impropriety of explosive
bottles? Has he reconciled himself to HER MAJESTY's Ministers, and
to Government in general, and obtained a ticket of leave, and how is
he, and does he get as much as he can dispose of for dinner P Is he as
red as he was, or a little paler—in his views as well as in his features 2
The Pope's mad Bull now running loose, and quite another hubbub
than that of Chartism at present raging, it may seem that CUFFY has
nothing to do with any question before the Public, and has been rather
Nº. up from the Antipodes by Mr. Punch, head and shoulders.
ot so.
That the diameter of the globe intervenes between MR. CUFFY and
his countrymen, is in great measure owing to his indulgence in “open
and advised” speaking. Now, here is some speaking – or writing, which
amounts to the same thing—not less open, nor less advised, and cer-
tainly no better advised, than any piece of incendiary eloquence that the
turbulent little tailor ever vented. Thus writes a MR. AMBRose Lisle
PHILLIPs, one of the Pope's partisans, in a letter lately published,
addressed to the EARL or Širºwseum'."
“My dear lord, you are on your way to the Holy City, to thank onr most holy father
for his gracious regard for our English Church; pray him to bestow again and again
his apostolic blessing upon his children here, who are ready to combat for his sacred
rights, and those of the Holy See and the Catholic Church. The holy father may
count upon us; we are the children of the Crusaders, and will not falter before the
sons of CRANMER and John KNox.”
This is simply an offer to fight for the Pope, if required, against the
QUEEN. CUFFY never uttered anything half so treasonable, and it is
unfair, and a great shame, to keep him in exile, whilst PHILLIPs is
|. to rave much more violently with impunity. Perhaps,
lowever, PHILLIPs has escaped the Attorney-General's notice merely
from being beneath it; and is more lucky than Cuffy, only because
he is more insignificant.
Drilling for All Nations.
SAID MR. CoBDEN, in his speech at Birmingham the other day:- "
“All the Continent is bristling with muskets and bayonets. There are—bear this
fact in mind–500,000 more armed men there, living in the daily exercise of drill, than
there ever had been in the very height of Napoleon's wars; and the nations of the
Continent of Europe have, since the events of 1847, increased their debts by about
£200,000,000 sterling.”
All this drilling that is going on among Continental nations will very
soon drill tremendous holes in their pockets.

Mr. Goodchild. Talking of tips—

I really think I want another pair.
Mrs. G (looking at his hands). You do, indeed, my dear—alas! alas !

What think you of those “Cloth, at fifteen pence?”
Mr. G. I like them pretty well; butlook at those! (pointing to a label)
“Stout double extra, gentlemanly dog,
Tenpence the pair—three pairs for two-and-three.”
These are the gloves for me—I love the dog:
He is nothin skinned creature like the kid,
But tough and honest, stout of heart and hide.

WE STAND UPON A. WOLCANO.
ITHOUGH Ludgate Hill is not exactly
* like AEtna, nor do we literally find Wesu-
vius in the snow of Snow Hill, Holborn,
- still we are justified in saying that the
metropolis stands upon a volcano, for
there is constantly an eruption, or break-
ing up, of the public thoroughfares.
there were another invasion of the Picts
we could not be more completely picked
to pieces than we are by those demons
of fire and water, the Genii of gas and
sewerage. There is certainly something
like variety in a walk to the City, for
we come every now and then to such
a terrific rupture in the ground, as may
well be called a break in the journey.
If we attempt a ride into the City, the affair has all the danger,
without any of the pleasing excitement of a steeple-chase, for the
chances of a casual plug-hole of former days are now superseded by the
terrors of the open trench, and the perils of the precipice. . The wonder
is, that London is not some day blown up by a terrific explosion of gas
for the inflammable fluid is continually pouring out from the lacerated
pipes, and the earth is so full of awful, gashes, that the noxious gases
are for ever mixing with the air, and making combustion imminent.
Every gap in the pavement is a *: bringing every cab to a stand,
and as we fear the gas companies will low up London, we anticipate
matters by blowing up them, in the hope of checking their eccen-
tricities.
THE TURN OF THE TIDE.
THE Chronicle—whose Papal leaders ought to be printed in ink of
congenial scarlet—says rejoicingly, of what it calls the No Popery
Crusade of the City of fondon, “the tide of |. is already turned.”
Is it, indeed? Is it running down from Fulham, and will it soon be
low water at Lambeth P And shall we have what was the boat of th
Fisherman, but is now the three-decker of the Pope, high and dry in
mud, with her ports "g. and her guns run out, and bearing upon
Westminster Abbey?, Shall the Lamb and Flag wave from the mast-
head, fanning, the folks of England, with blessings And—as we
have seen, similar amenities carried out at Cherbourg, between French
and English Commanders—will the Fisherman of London take
oars from Fulham, and visit the Fisherman of Rome off Lambeth 2
"Twill be pretty enough to see them º a turn upon the deck; the
shovel hat in contrast with that, beautiful bit of colour worn by the
Captain Cardinal, the legs of black stepping out and keeping time with
the legs of scarlet. But this the Chronicle promises, and this we shall
see when—we shall see.
Words and Things.
“AND where the harm in the words CARDINAL of WesTMINstERP
What danger in mere title, without authority?” asks Miss Pussy-
KITTEN of M. Punch, and Mr. Punch replies, “All the harm, and all
the danger, Madam. Words, especially. words from the Vatican, are
the Gentlemen-Ushers to things.”

A BOAR “WRITING TO THE TIMES.”
THE columns of our contemporary, the Times are “open daily” for
the redress of grievances, and everybody who has to complain of any-
body in power, or out of power, from a prime minister to a policeman,
or #. a millionaire to a merchant, finds immediate consolation in
“writing to the Times.” . We think, however, it is rather hard upon
our contemporary to tax his good nature to the extent to which we saw
a specimenthe other day, when some individual—a descendant, probably,
of the benevolent enthusiast who walked, side-by-side with a duck, for
half a-day in a . shower, to give the animal the benefit of half of
his umbrella—troubled the Times with a letter, complaining of the
smallness of the sty allotted to the Boar in the Regent's Park Zoologi-
cal Gardens. If the domestic arrangements of the É. are to be taken
º by those, whose sympathy with them is accounted for by a similarity
of name—errors of spelling always excepted—there will be no end to
the correspondence our contemporary will find inundating his letter-box.
Besides, if the Boar is to have a hearing, why should not the Hippopo-
tamus be allowed his say, through the medium of an amanuensis, in the
columns of the press; and if this once begins, there will be no end to
the complaints of bad accommodation, too much confinement, and the
numerous other grievances to which the inmates of a zoological estab-
lishment are liable. The Monkeys, who are for ever chattering, will be
calling %. some one to put their chattering into writing, and send it
to the Times, ºf; no doubt, of the parasol points perpetually
being poked at them, and perhaps of the quality of the biscuits sold at
the door, for the visitors to pelt them with. Though our contemporary
has, very goodnaturedly, allowed insertion to the remonstrances on the
part of the Boar, complaining of his want of “a wooden railing instead
of iron to rub himself against,” still, we advise that the matter should
not be suffered to become a precedent for every animal, to whom the
rules of the world are not exactly the sort he would have selected for
himself, if he had been allowed the choice of them.
COCHINEAL AT FULHAM.
OUR readers may not be aware that the Bishop of LoNDON is as
eat in his knowledge of the vegetable world, of the nature of trees,
#. the cedar to the hyssop, as of Hebrew roots. For some time past
his Lordship has suffered a number of experiments to be made, with a
view to the production of the cochineal insect-the insect that, with a
proper solution of tin, supplies the most brilliant scarlet. For some
time there was, at least in the gardens of Fulham, º'.
that the insect might be acclimated, and so, scarlet be ºbtained frºm
home-growth. At the present writing there seems, on the part of his
Lordship, a desire to give the experiment up. London no longer
stand the hazard of #. dye. Again, there are many of the Church-
friends of his Lordship—who have shown a great §. towards
scarlet stockings—but somehow they cannot bear to think of the colour,
if without a solution of their church tin.

Which will cause you to open your eyes,
A very l portion of History

As fictitious—hatch’d up—fabricated: -
Because not a word of it’s true!
Ti itive f $º. h a myste
'Tis a positive fact—though a mystery—
That authors, abroad and at º
Have nearly all falsified History
To prevent our submitting to Rome.
Every Pontiff that ever existed
Led a life that was free from all taint;
Though his acts have been shamefully twisted,
ALEXANDER THE SIXTH was a Saint:
You must hold him completely exempted
From the charges of which we’ve all learnt;
To poison he never attempted:
SAvoNAROLA never was burnt.

An objection to Rome has been made;
But, in fact, there were no Albigenses,
And no SIMON DE MonTFoRT's crusade.

At the Council of Constance devoted
To the faggots, no more than Joe SMITH.

Oh! the Church would have never consented
To have such a law made in her name,
And let her stray sheep be tormented

[MR. PUNCH lights a cigar and calls back ToBy, and speaks to him
seriously.
Now listen, to me, Toby, my dog., You were just now going to bite the
calves of that gentleman in the red legs, and very good calves they are:-
But you must not bite, Toby, though I give you hearty leave to growl a
little. You see he comes here neither with my leave nor by my leave:
announces himself as spiritual pastor and master of my country, and pro-
duces his commission to govern over me, signed by the Pope of Rome.
Now, my dear Toby, I just as much care about the Pope of Rome as I
do about the Mufti of Ispahan; and my desire for a quiet life is such,
that if the latter were to come in this country and build himself a
mosque and minaret, and bawl out thence that there was no Prophet
but Mahomet, and that he the Mufti was the Mufti of all England, and
his mosque the only place where a man could say his F. with any
advantage, I would let the Mufti speak; making, when need was, a
sº against his bawling, and stating every now and then
. my heart and conscience, that I didn't believe a single wo
O
it.
But I’ll have no persecution, Toby. I say, keep your teeth out of the
Cardinal's legs. The great object is to show that most of us in this
country utterly scout his claim, and laugh at his red hat and red stock;
ings, his ring and his crozier, and his Pontifical, whether he swears upon it
to expugnate us or not. That is the main point, whereof we should con:
vince him—and when he talks of governing us—we say Pooh. Come and
say your prayers, and light your candles and chaunt your services, and
welcome—but as for governing us—you petticoated Roman Prince, as
you call yourself, you who daren't so much as publish a newspaper, and
who haven’t even a railroad—we laugh at §". and your a surd old.
world pretensions—and must every now and then let you know that
we laugh at you.
But for all that, Toby, we'll leave his Eminence's legs, alone. He
has as good a right to his crimson as a quaker has to drab, and must
have free leave to set up his pulpit, as you and I have to act in our
booth. Do him no harm. hen those Irishmen battered, and half
or quite killed the poor policemen the other day, do you think they
advanced their religion by the assault f : No, nor can we by expugma-
tion or persecution hope to make converts to ours. The railroad, the

have won in spite of my Lord Cardinal's º: we intend to keep;

M O R E A B O U T HAT S.
(By our own Commissioner in search of one).
HE letter of an esteemed cor-
respondent, writing from Man-
chester, informs me that when
all English traveller of his ac-
quaintance presented himself,
wearing the hat of his country,
to a * of Choctaw Indians
(who had never seen the ar-
ticle before), they invested him
solemnly with the title of
“Father of the Cooking-Pot.”
Did the hat serve any such
culinary purpose, it might, by
being useful, in some measure
excuseitsnot being ornamental.
But except when an ingenious
Robert Houdin or HERR
DOBLER uses some gentleman's
hat to make a pancake, or toboil
some pigeons in, I never re-
member to have seen the article
used as a cooking utensil. This
digression over, I resume my
travelling observations.
On crossing the Belgian Frontier into Prussia, I was sensible of a
The chimney-
t was nowhere, to be seen, except upon some obstinate travelling
nglishman, and, here and there, on an Anglo-maniac of a German. One
of my companions, who belonged to the former intractable class, persisted
in wearing his chimney-pot in the railway carriage, to his own infinite
discomfort, and the utter crushing, defacing, and unshaping of the thing
itself. The hat at last, feeling itself out of place, took advantage of
its wearer's falling asleep to throw itself out of the window, and I have
no doubt was run over by the train. I found the cap very generally
worn in Germany. The cap, I am bound to say, has many advantages.
It may be sat upon. It may be put into the pocket. It may be made
pretty with embroidery. It can be chosen with an eye to the face, and
constructed so as to draw over the ears. In all these respects, its
superiority to the hat is incontestable. But it is an imperfect head-
dress notwithstanding. There is a want of continuity about the peak,
that fragment of a brim, and in most cases it labours under a certain
meanness and pettiness of character, which must prevent its ever taking
much for general wear, though, in a carriage, it is both neat and appro.
priate. The proneness of the Germans to mount uniforms, on the
slightest jº provocation, has much to do with the H. of the
cap among them. German railway porters are got up like non-commis-
sidned officers, and the commissionaire at your hotel, who blacks your
boots and runs—(no, the German never runs)—w on an errand, has
a coat buttoned up to the neck with a stiff collar, red stripes down his
trousers, and not unfrequently an order at his j. I believe
it is only his poverty which restrains him from breaking out in epaulettes.
russia is peculiarly uniform-ridden. ... I saw as many soldiers as civilians
when I was there, and what it must be now the Landwehr is called out,
and 500,000 men on foot (or horseback), I leave you, Sir, to imagine.
Again, the German princes (as witness a certain illustrious prince,
not a hundred miles from Windsor) have discovered the deep signifi.
cance of hats. They have found out the mysterious connection of white
felt with red republicanism; and in many States such felts are forbidden
for that reason. These potentates do not like anything or anybody that
is wide-awake. But the dangerous contamination does not seem to
extend to black felts, and these may be said to cover all heads in
Germany not appropriated to the cap. Such black felts, a la Tyrolienne,
with narrow brims and steeple crowns; or with broad brims and low
crowns, a la Cavalier; or with round crowns and brims turned up all
round, a la fancy flower-pot, might be encountered in every steamboat,
and round every billiard table, from Cologne to Prague, so far as the
And wherever the State did
not lay an embargo on the article, the white felt, broad-brimmed,
and Cavalieresque—the Heckerisches Hut (as it has been called, after
the lamented Baden patriot of that name, who, like our own CúFFEy,
has now “left his country for his country's good”) came out in all its
breadth of shadow and variety of slouch.
And a most picturesque and convenient hat it is, Sir. I had two
confiscated during my journey, and very nearly owed to my second a
visit of some duration to Spandau. But still I persevered, from a real
admiration of the form ºf colour. And on the whole, the hat I have
seen which most realises the conditions of the ideal head-cover, is this
same revolutionary white, grey, or drab wide-awake—somewhat broader
in the brim, and higher in the crown, than the last-conceived attempts
of the same kind exhibited in our own shop-windows.
This hat has real vitality. Neither Prussian persecution, nor
Austrian absolutism, has been able to put it down. It has survived an
association with a cause anything but creditable, and bids fair, before
long, to make its way to the head of united Germany, which Prussia
.#Austria are just now each insisting ought to be on its own shoulders.
In my next article, Sir, I propose, with your leave, to combat objec-
tions to the discrowning of the reigning chimney-pot, drawn from the
unpicturesqueness of the rest of our costume, and to point out the
steps to be taken in 1851 to set # rational hat, which is destined
to replace the national hat of England.
DRAMAS FOR EVERY-DAY LIFE.
THE following drama is upon a subject that will come home to the
heart and tongue, the lungs and the . the epiglottis, and the affec-
tions, of every Englishman. There is not a theme in the whole range
of every-day life, that so frequently furnishes the matter of conversa-
tion, and there can be none, conse "...; so universal in its interest,
as the one which forms the subi º the drama we are about to present
to our readers. In every circle, at every hour of every day, the first
point started by every one meeting with another, and taken up by that
other with the keenest relish, is-The Weather. The title may not
appear at first sight a promising one, for the purposes of the dramatist;
but if he can succeed in presenting to his countrymen a type of a drama
for every-day life, divested of those common-places which long habit and
an apparent exhaustion of the theme may have thrown about it, he will
be content to hang up his harp on the first hat-peg of “Tara's,” or any
one else's “hall,” and repose, as well as such a substitute for a mattress
will allow him, upon his already-acquired laurels. . But without further
prologue, we will “ring up,” and let the curtain rise for the drama of
THE WEATHER.

I’m very warm with walking. [Sits at a distance.
1z's. D. Probably.
But walking somehow never makes me warm. -

between the bars of a parrot's cage, as if playing with the bird,
receives a savage snap, but says nothing, as the affair is not
remarked by anybody. --- -
Mrs. Y. What think you, MistER MUFFLE, will it rain?
You gentlemen can always judge so well. - -
Mr. M.,(walking to the window, partly, to conceal the pain of his
finger). Why that depends a good deal on the wind.

M; glass deceives me often.
Mrs. M. (in a mental aside). Rather say
Your glass tells often some unpleasant truths.
Mr. M. * weather-glass, dear Madam, is my corn.
Mrs. M. Why, really, MIsTER M., you’re quite absurd;
Have we the means of guidance such as that:
You're positively rude.
Mrs. Y. (laughing). Oh, not at all;
He’s trod upon no tender place of mine.
Mrs. S. I’ve heard some story of the tails of cows
'Tis said that when to the wind's quarter turn'd,
They augur rain. Now tell me, Mr. MUFFLE,
Do you believe in that?
r. M. ... I'd trust a cow's,
As well as any other idle tail.
Mrs. Y. That’s saying very little.
(For your opinion, really, I respect,)
Are mackerel-looking clouds a sign of wet?
Mr. M. I think it probable that mackerel clouds
Betoken wet, just as a mackerel's self
Puts us in mind of water.
Tell me, now,
Mrs. S. . ... Are you joking,
Or speaking as a scientific man? -
rs. Y. You're such a wag, there’s never any knowing
When you are serious, or half in jest.
Dear MRs. MUFFLE, you that know him best,
Shall we believe him?
JMrs. M. Oh, I can say nothing.
[All laugh for some minutes, on and off, at the possibly intended wit
MR. MUFFLE ; and the tittering having died off gradually, there
18 a pause.
Mrs. M. (to Mrs. Y.) Have you been out much lately?
Mrs. Y.
The º in the air prevented me.
Mrs. S. 'Tis rather drier now.
Mrs. K. I think it is.
I hope I shall be getting out next week,
I can find a clear and frosty day.
Mr. M. I think 'tis very probable you will.
Mrs. Y. I’m quite delighted to have heard you say so;
But º, quizzing us? You’re such a quiz!
Mr. Y. (with serious earnestness). Believe me, MRs. YAWNLEY, when
No, indeed,

Mrs. Y. I know your kindness, and I feel it much;
You were my poor dear husband's early friend.

avoid being involved in the scene.
I feel that though with cheerful badinage

When with a serious appeal addressed,

Mrs. M. (rising, and kissing MRs. Y.) You do him justice, but we
must be going.

And take some luncheon P
Mr. M. ank you; no, indeed;
We must be getting home, I fear 'twill rain.
Mrs. S. I think you go my way—I’m in a fly,
And shall be Nº. glad to set you down.
Mrs. M. Oh, thank you; that’s delightful.
Mrs. S. (to MRs. Y.)
So, I’ll say
Goodbye at once.
Well, if you will not stay.

[MR. and MRs. MUFFLE, and MRs. SHIVERs, eaeunt by the door.
MRs. YAwNLEY goes to the bell. MR. MUFFLE taps on the
weather-glass; the bell rings ; and the glass, which is going down,
walls considerably at the same moment as the curtain.
Speaking Likeness.
WE have seen so many speaking likenesses that were so little like the
ugly objects they were supposed to represent, that we really believe
if these “speaking” likenesses had the power of speaking, they would
experience a very great difficulty in telling the names of the persons
they resembled.

matter, we are sure he has been
more than sufficiently punished for
his Letter, by having to read all
the answers that have been sent
to him in reply to it. MR. ST.
BARNABAs BENNETT, for instance,
sent him the other day a very
agreeable communication, only five
columns long, which he had the
refined cruelty to call his “First
Letter.” This threat is so obvious,
that we really think MR. BENNETT
- -- might be taken into custody upon
the charge of having written a threatening letter to LoRD John
RUSSELL, with a view of working upon his fears, and intimidating
im in the execution of his duty. Who would remain Premier of
England, with the dread constantly before him of receiving from
MR. BENNETT a letter, only five columns long, once a week? We only
know if we were Prime Minister, the prospect of receiving another
Letter like it—and there is no knowing how many more—would make
us instantly resign.

GREEN GROW THE CRITICS, OH !
: DRAMATIC criticism is rather at a low ebb, and the critics, in self-
defence—plead a sort of “confession and avoidance,” that is to .
they confess that there is very little in their criticisms; but they add,
with much truth, that there is very little to criticise.
We wish, however, that they would at least endeavour to throw the
charm of novelty into their phraseology, which is, becoming fearfully
stale from frequent repetition. We are sick of hearing that, “MR.
So-AND-so was respectable in the small part of the Captain;” or that
Miss JolifiLLE “had nothing to do but to look pretty, in which we need
not say she acquitted herself to the satisfaction of the audience.” We
should also feel refreshed by something in place of the old intimation
that “MR. B. convulsed the house by his usual quaint manner;” or
. … Mº. M. threw his usual amount of unction into the part of the
eneral.”
We are not sufficiently skilled in theatrical, chemistry to be able to
analyse the style of MR. M. or MR. L., or MR. ANYBody, with such
nicety as to admit of our extracting the “unction”—putting it, as it
were, on a separate plate—from the rest of the acting, and weighing it
in a scale, as a sort of guide from which to form an estimate of the
“usual” quantity. We are tired, moreover, of being told that “the
part was one which enabled MR. CHARLEs Matthews to º his
customary coolness,” especially when the piece is far more calculated
to display the extreme “coolness” with which the playwright has stolen
it from the French, and put his own name to it. We admit that there
is little in the present state of the drama to encourage criticism to an
honourable exertion of its best powers; for we are quite ready to own
that the breaking of butterflies on the wheel is not a more superfluous
operation than submitting the Grub—or Grub Street—to the same dis;
proportionate punishment. However, feebleness reacts upon itself, and
a healthy criticism might do something towards the restoration of a
healthy drama; but, as things É at present
the wish-wash of the press
makes the wishy-washy stuff o
the stage, which it lives upon.
THE LAUREATESHIP.
WE are glad to find the Laureateship filled up at last, if it is only on
account of the numerous expectants who were kept in suspense, in the
hope of obtaining the office. A popular comic vocalist sent in a tender,
we believe, with specimens of congratulatory odes, and an offer to
attend and sing them himself at any or all of the Palace dinners ; and
men of some pretensions to the post furnished estimates, but as these
were, in most cases, over-estimates of themselves, no attention was
paid to them. Considerable disappointment is said to have been caused
to one of the candidates, who prides himself on being a great impro-
visatore; but he consoled himself partially under his vexation, by the
remark, that he failed entirely owing to pºlitical causes—for, being an
improvisa-Tore, instead of an improvisa-Whig, he could scarcely have
expected an office at the hands of a Whig government.

THE CAMBRIDGE MONUMENT.
THERE has been a great demonstration perpetrated in favour of the
Cambridge Testimonial. At least forty enthusiastic individuals met by
advertisement, to prove that they were dreadfully in earnest; and after
a splendid display of eloquent fireworks, separated without, doing any-
thing. And this was very judicious, because it supplies them with a
very proper excuse for meeting again. Seven plans were discussed as
significantly bearing upon the best means of sending the late DUKE of
CAMBRIDGE down to posterity. Plan 6 was “a bronze equestrian
statue !” We are very sorry that this plan should be abandoned.
London is very naked of statues, and Cambridge in Trafalgar Square
would have very nicely balanced the bronze effigy of the lamented GEORGE
THE FourTH, whose virtues as a man cannot be too earnestly studied,
and too zealously copied, by the British youth. The statue being out of
the question, Plan Number 2—for an asylum for widows of non-commis-
sioned officers and privates of the arm ...}. to become the
favourite. One speaker talked very jº, of the yearly subscriptions
to be expected from the non-commissioned officers and privates of the
130 regiments of the line. When we consider the large amount of pay
enjoyed by every full private, when we reflect upon the difficulty that
continually besets him in the pleasant and rational expenditure of his
entire shilling * diem, the Cambridge Monument comes in delightfully
to his aid; and he will have the proud satisfaction of feeling that he
has contributed to the memorial of a man who with a princely income—
for º many years doubled § viceregal pay—left his son and daughter
to be found in board and lo § by an admiring people. That the
iate pure or Cºriogº should become a yearly charge to the private
soldier, must endear his memory in a manner that it is almost too
affecting to contemplate; though in a general sense and as a matter of
national delight, we think the £12,000 per annum enjoyed by the
present illustrious Duke is a sufficient and an abiding memento of the
name of CAMBRIDGE. -
The only One Thing that Never Changes.
We see from the foreign correspondence of the newspapers that
* PRINCE TAxis has been ordered to make an immediate advance.”
It is very curious, but directly there is a war, or even the rumour of
a war, it is sure to be followed—no matter in what kingdom—by an
immediate advance of Taxes.
The Triumph of Industry.
MR. BRIEFLEss intends sending in

other than the dummy motion, which
has been lying now on MR.BRIEFLEss's
table for the last ten, or twelve, or
fifteen years, in fact, as long as MR.
BRIEFLess can recollect he has been
ractising at the Bar. MR. BRIEFLEss
intends to send it in as the nearest ap-
proach that has yet been made to the
grand secret of “ Perpetual Motion ; ”
and he has sanguine hopes of receiving
the prize offered by Government for its

ONE WAY TO OPPOSE PAPAL AGGRESSION.
THE public will be glad to hear that the Bishops and Clergy have re-
solved on adopting a course which is calculated effectually to arrest
the progress of Papal usurpation. It is said that, in recognition of the
cordial assistance which they are experiencing at the present crisis at
the hands of Dissenters of all denominations, they have determined on
seriously revising their articles and formularies, to see if there are not
really certain essential points, agreement on which would be sufficient
for their mutual union. It is, however, reported that they intend dis;
tinctly to renounce all claims and pretensions founded on or derived
from that theory of infallibility against which they now find themselves
obliged to protest. Rumour has likewise circulated the welcome in-
telligence that they are about to apply to the Legislature for a strictly
equitable adjustment of Church property, with reference solely to its
legitimate purposes. . .
The story further goes, that the Dissenters have decided on relin-
uishing any whims or crotchets which may hitherto have been, on
their side, obstacles to coalition. Lastly, § is declared that of
the parties, being now awake to the consequences of allowing the
#." tº remain in ignorance, will earnestly co-operate in the
iffusion of knowledge, with a view to the cultivation of reason and
the extension of common sense, which will be as important a step as
any that may be taken to resist papal aggression. -
“Popery in Flower and Popery in the Bud."
LORD.ASHLEY, at the Crown and Anchor, spoke of Popery in the
above two-fold condition., Punch immediately set to work to obtain
specimens; and subjøins the flower and the bud. The full-blown flower
was obtained from the garden of the house attached to St. George's

Y way of change
- for “Shocking
Catastrophe,”
“Frightful Ca-
sualty,” or
« Mélancholy
| and Fatal Qc-
| currence,” the
| Morning Post
| of Thursday,
last week, re-
lates an acci-
dent, under a
heading equally
strikingandori-
ginal—thus:-
“Vulgae Sports.-On Tuesday last, the floor of a room in a beer-house in Manches-
ter fell in with an assemblage of 35 or 40 men, who were enjoying the intellectual gra-
tification of witnessing a celebrated terrier worry a number of rats, in a given number
of minutes. A man named ToolE had his spine fractured, and has since died. A second,
named CAER, had his right thigh broken, and is in a dangerous state, and several others
are much injured.”
What would the gentleman who dishes up the Post for fashionable
breakfast tables think of such a description as the subjoined, of an
accident, attended with loss of life, occurring among sportsmen of the
superior classes?—
“ARTstocratic AMUsements.-Yesterday, the brow of a gravel-pit gave way with a
party of noblemen and gentlemen who were out with the QUEEN's hounds, enjoying the
intellectual gratification of beholding a number of dogs worry a stag. A nobleman,
named Montague, had his skull fractured, and has since died. Another, named
Howard, had three of his ribs broken, and lies in a precarious condition, and several
gentlemen besides were severely him tº
Perhaps this would appear to our friend of the Post a somewhat
over-light and airy style of reporting death and fractures. Peradven;
ture those mischances, with the accessories of stags and hounds, would
be looked upon as rather more serious matters than they seem to have
been in connexion with rats and terriers, by that gentleman—or gentle-
man's gentleman.
GRAND TERPSICHOREAN FEAT.
WE are informed that the BARON NATHAN is practising a step, which
is to leave all his other steps, many thousand steppes behind. This
step is no other than dancing a hornpipe amongst the toys and tea-cups in
the Lowther Arcade / The time selected for the grand terpsichorean
achievement will be five o'clock in the afternoon, and any one who
knows the almost . state of the Lowther Arcade at that hour
of the day, will be able to appreciate the many hundred thousand diffi-
culties, in the shape of .# n's drums, and babies' tea-things, which
the indefatigable BARON will have to meet with in his way. He is
very sanguine, however, of success, and has adopted an ingenious
mode of training, which we cannot resist the temptation of recording.
He gives directions, every morning after breakfast, that his study may
be instantly “put to rights.” This study contains some of the finest
specimens of art, in the shape of Bohemian mugs, China cows, chalk
Apollos, Wedgwood Venuses, Parian milk-maids, and medieval chim.
ney-sweeps—mostly the gifts of grateful noblemen and §§ eresses,
who have not blushed to receive instructions from the gifted feet of the
BARON. When the room is “put to rights,” and the disorder conse-
uently is at the very highest, the bold BARON dashes frantically into
the middle of the confusion, and there indulges for hours in the wildest
flights of genius amidst the heap of scattered things. As yet the BARON
not even broken off a branch of the gilt tree which sº grows
out of the back of the peculiar breed of China cows, sold in England,
and he expects by Christmas—which is the period when the Lowther
Arcade is the most crowded with the ephemeral trifles of the festive
season—to be quite perfect. We hope that good fortune may smile
upon both of the BARON's legs, so that he may not put his foot into a
single Christmas Box. At least £1000 is dependent upon the result.
Stray Piece of Wit Picked up at the Promenade Concerts.
ON, one of the most crowded nights the visitors overflowed the
vacant space at the back of the orchestra. This vacant space is filled
with statues standing in the midst of small patches of Saloon Garden-
ing. The growd kept, flowing faster and faster, and a little gentleman
was carried away by the strength of the current: “Don’t pray don’t
push!” he screamed out, from the middle of one of these patches,
with his arms clinging for support round the waist of Apollo. “Don’t
push so, I’m standing in a flower-pot.”—“Well, then.” retorted a
malicious Guardsman, “Since you are in the flower-pot, my little fellow,
you may as well stop there, and grow.”

“Submit patiently to the taunts of the profane, the abandoned, the
reprobate wretches. When you are reviled . the monsters, revile
them not in return—the odious, detestable, abominable wicked mis-

their execrable heresies. Deny, without, acrimony, their slanderous
accusations; their dreadful, horrid, appalling, terrific lies. Gaze on

250 PUNCH, OR THE L
ONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR CHARLES WOOD’S TALES OF WONDER.
N what account should
we disbelieve in
the winking pic-
ture of Rimini, or
in the liquefaction
of the blood of
ST. JANUARIUs,
when only last
week so astound-
ing a statement
as the following
was made in the
Times *—
“The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER
acknowledges the re-
ceipt of £80 to the
credit of Income Tax,
inclosed in a letter
from Plymouth.”
Considering the
want of equity—
in plain terms the
iniquity — of the
operation of the
Income Tax, one
can hardly be less
surprised at the
above ammounce-
ment than one
would be at
this;–
“Mr. Punch acknowledges the receipt of £100 inclosed to him in a letter from ‘Q. P.,
Surrey,' as ‘conscience money, being the amount concealed by a mis-statement from
burglars, when the house was broken into the other day.”
But the wonder of wonders is to come. The Times paragraph goes
on to say,
“The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer also acknowledges the receipt of £6 from
‘MEDICUs,' as a repayment of public money received when not legally entitled to it.”
The wonder, however, here is not the restitution, but the circumstance
of their being anything to restore...Of all the novelties of these extra-
ordinary times, the strangest, to the mind of Mr. Punch, . fact,
that there exists a medical man who has received any public money to
which he was not legally entitled. If Punch had a farthing of such
money, he would frame it and glaze it; if he had two farthings, he
would send the second to the British Museum; if the whole £3 had
been transmitted to him, he would, instead of paying the:sum into the
Exchequer, have sent a farthing a piece to all the union Forkhouses in
the Únited Kin dom, to be preserved, by way of ento, in the
board-room .#the remainder he would have distribºſed between the
surgeons of those establishments—thus making, proportionally, a very
considerable addition to their incomes.
WISEMAN IN HIS DINING-ROOM.
Nicholas WISEMAN has been cruelly libelled by the press. He has
been charged with receiving Catholic visitors and neophytes in state in
the dining-room attached to St. George's Chapel. It was said of him,
that “he threw himself comfortably back into an arm-chair, and that he
exacted more than the extreme rigour of royal etiquette.” No such
thing, says ALEXANDER Goss, of St. Edward's, Liverpool; and we im-
plicit believe him. No doubt, malignity has strangely jumbled the
two &: ºniº WisemAN, at St. George's, and Cardinal
Wolsey, at the Haymarket. Theatre. That Wiscº is, at the present
moment, only Wolsey in his early state—like a young hedgehog in the
wool, to come out all over prickles, and not to be touched by lay º
—we can readily believe; but that Wise MAN–give him his growth-
would be Wolsey in all his lory, we have the authority of his un-
changing and infallible Church for our assurance. At present, however,
we can believe Wise MAN the very combination of istian humility
and gentlemanly º; We can believe him with paternal affection
receiving “young friends, entire strangers to him, to dinner”—even if
the young #j. are merely neophytes, desirous of foregoing the
irksomeness of daily labour as means of daily bread, for—in due course
—the more ascetic life of father confessors. We do not believe in the
present royal appointments and royal etiquette of the temporary
Cardinal; no, looking very closely, we rather see upon him a hair-shirt,
an iron girdle, and—at least—half-a-pint of unboiled peas in either of
is pastoral sandals
SoMETHING very PATENT.-That some reform is strongly needed in
ROEBUCK, THE POLITE LETTER-WRITER.
. MR. Roebuck is, unquestionably, an honest man. MR. Roebuck
is, indisputably, a candid man. MR. Roebuck is, assuredly, a bold
man. And, therefore, so gifted, MR. Roebuck is very right, upon the
least possible, aggravation, to flourish his honesty, his candour, his
boldness, in the face of the universe. His flowers of rhetoric were
never intended to blush unseen—his jewel of a good name is not to
i. merely in the privacy of life. No; he makes a regular flower-
show of his eloquence, on the lightest occasion, and sports his good
name for plain-dealing, as jauntily as a Sunday apprentice sports his
smallest diamond-pin. Hence, MR. RQEBUCK writes a letter to LoRD
John Russell upon his lordship's late epistle to the Bishop of
DURHAM.
And here let us thank the Pope's Bull that has caused to be turned
up such a polished specimen of the epistolary style, as that subscribed
John ARTHUR Roebuck. Its i. its delicacy, is delicious.
Perhaps there is no public man who could so delightfully redeem the
harshness of political contest by such elegance of manner, such refine-
ment of expression. We treat ourselves with a morsel of the true,
instinctive gentleman. MR. Roebuck tells LoRD RUssell that he
will not quote Hansard against him; he will assume no such ungrateful
task. . No : MR. Roebuck will only deal with the amenities of life;
and, from the nettle controversy, pluck the flower of good breeding;
and here it is, a flower odorous of the best manners:—
“As I have no desire to convict you of mere inconsistency—and as I believe that
even a most minute investigation of all that you have ever uttered in Parliament would not
greatly conduce to my edification—I would rather address you as the Prime Minister of
England, than deal with yodr sayings as recorded in Hansard.”
We have marked the true beauty of the sentence in italics, as we
would, were we able, mark a beautiful pansy with an additional “freak”
of jet: it deserves to be made to come out with greater force, for the
honesty, candour, boldness, and good-manners, combined in a few words
-unprovoked words—that say to a gentleman and the Prime Minister of
England—“You have been talking for some thirty years in Parliament
—your name is associated with the most important political changes—
you are the First Minister, and you have never uttered a syllable that
would edify me, JoHN ARTHUR Roebuck!” It was so necessary to
the writer's case—so inseparable from the argument levelled against the
writer of the letter to the Bishop of DURHAM, that all his antecedents
should be put down, badged, branded—upon most minute investigation
—as the labours of a nobody, a nincompoop.
Now, MR. Roebuek's plain-speaking might tell a man, so burthened,
that he had a lump on his shoulder.
MR. RoeBuck’s candour might point to the pock-marks in another
man's face; whilst MR. Roebuck's perseverance, as a public character,
might volunteer to enumerate every pit. -
..MR. RoºBuck's boldness might, ſºlely risking his own nasus, in-
dignantly charge a third man with the possession of a pug-nose.
And in each and all of these qualities, namely, the plain-speaking of
R. Roebuck—the candour of MR. RoeBUCK–the boldness of MR.
Buck,-would be grandly prominent; but not more prominent than
the delicacy of MR. Roebuck—the courtesy of MR. Roebuck—and,
above all, the chivalrous good-manners of MR. Roebuck.
Parody for Puseyites.
Though crosses and candles we play with at home,
To go the whole gander, there’s no place like Rome;
We’ve statues and relics to hallow us there,
Which, save in museums, you’ll not find elsewhere.
Rome, Rome, sweet, sweet Rome!
for allus Tractarians there’s no place like Rome!
PLEAs' DoN'T.
SoMEBody has prepared for the forthcoming Exhibition “a process
for water-proofing any stuff, from the finest lace to the coarsest fustian.”
If the discovery is applicable to “any stuff,” it may, we hope, be
adapted to that precious “stuff,” a special plea, which frequently fails
from its being utterly unable to hold water.
Punch and the Pope.
We understand that Pio No-No, that great double negative, who has
been attempting to make himself an affirmative in this, country, ex;
pressed extreme sorrow, almost amounting to despair, when, he heard
that Punch was ºr. to his recent proceedings. Pio, who under-
stands the English language, though he does not seem to understand the
#. people, remarked to one of his attendants in a half-mournful
half-merry tone, “Alas, alas! I should have cared §. little
about the probable failure of my attempt to get the English to swallow
the bowl of Bishop I have been brewing for them, but it cuts me to
the absurd laws that apply to Patents'
the quick to perceive that there is no chance of their having their Punch
à la }.

following directions which are offered, by way of hints, as to the course they had
better pursue, with the view to defeat the national determination to put down the
PoPE's attempt to domineer over England:- -
As soon as meetings cease to be held, and addresses to be voted, in reference to
the Papal invasion, begin to pooh-pooh the whole movement, and go about saying
that all interest in the subject is subsiding. -
When the question of legislative resistance to the Pope comes to be discussed,
treat it as a religious one, although you know very well that its nature is political.
Pretend that the authority f Popish Bishops is merely spiritual, whereas you
º: i. them use it to resist the laws in Sardinia, and to oppose the Government

Persist in calling the outcry, which has been occasioned by the Pope's attack, a
shout of bigotry against the Roman Catholics at large-you being periºus aware
that it is merely a protest against the ſº of their priesthood."
Keep repeating, no matter how often you are contradicted, Gr-how, false you.
see your assertion to be, that the demand for prohibiting the "Popish Prelates to
assume territorial titles, is a call for reviving the penal laws against the practice
of the Roman Catholic religion. - -
Nevertheless—utterly regardless of consistency—at the same time, harp con-
tinually on the question, “What’s in a name?”—as though the Pope and his
Bishops would insist upon names if they were of no consequence; and as though it
is not obvious that they want the use of those, names to give their Church the
ap º of a national character, and thus authority in the eyes of the ignorant

LODGING-HOUSE KEEPERS’ LOGIC,
THE Lodging-House Keepers of London are beginning
to calculate the probable profits of the Great Exhibition
season of 1851, or in other words, they are “counting their
chickens before they are hatched; ” that is to say, before
they, shell out. Somebody has said that 4,000,000 of
strangers will be poured into London, and as there are not
more than 1,000,000 beds to let, the rules of arithmetic call
upon us to divide one by four, and as four into one won't
go, we recommend some of the intended visitors, before
they leave a comfortable bed at home, to “sleep upon it,”
until they have made sure of a substitute. The bedstead
trade has received a tremendous impetus, and sacking is in
fierce demand, as if it were expected that the invasion of
1851 would lead to the sacking of the whole city. Lodging-
House Keepers are looking out, in all directions É.i.
steads, or for anything that will turn up to serve instead,
and we have heard of a proposal having been made to a
family requiring apartments, to make up a bed in the cistern
for two of the children, by drawing off the water in the
evening, and †† the infants up and dressed before the
water is turned on in the morning. If the company should
take it into its head—its New River Head—to sluice the
sewers in the course of the night, which does happen now
and then, of course the poor children might be unexpectedly
"washed and done for,” as well as boarded and lodged in
the way described.
It is expected that º will rise to a dreadful
height; that meat will be sold by the mouthful instead of
the pound; that bread will rise, without reference to any
particular quantity of yeast; and that butter will be found
to be fetching a shilling an ounce, by those who are sent to
fetch the butter. As to milk, we have heard that a “Pure
Milk and Cream Company” have taken thelease of a chalk;
pit near town; and new-laid eggs are being already laid
in lime, with a view to the approaching season. Sand is
being brought to this country as ballast, to be thrown on
to the sugar market, at the proper moment, when the de-
mand is at its height; and foreign sloe-juice is being carried

… - CHAPTER I. - -, * *
OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN AN: Action, FROM Its comyſ ENCEMENT TO
ITS TERMINATION.
Actions are divided into Real, in which there is often much sham;
Personal, in which the personality is frequently indulged in by Counsel,
at the expence of the witnesses; and Mixed, in which a great deal of
pure nonsense sometimes, prevails. The Legislature being at last sen-
sible to the shamness of Real, and the pure nonsense of Mixed actions,
abolished all except four, and for the learning on these subjects, now
become obsolete, we must refer to the “books,” which have been trans-
ferred to the shops of Butter, from the shop of Butterworth.”
There are three superior Courts of Common law, one of their great
ints of superiority being their superior expense, which saves the
mmon Law from being so common as to be positively vulgar; and
its high price gives it one of the qualities of a luxury, rendering it
cariare to the million, or indeed to any but the millionnaire. These
Courts are the Queen's Bench,--a bench which five Judges sit upon;
the Exchequer, whose sign is a chess or draught-board, some say to
show how difficult is the game of law, while others maintain it is
merely emblematic of the drafts on the pockets of the suitor; and thirdly,
the Common Pleas, which took its title, possibly, from the fact of
#. lºſer finding the profits such as to make them un-Common-ly
eas (1.
The real and mixed actions not yet abolished, are—lst, the Writ of
Right of Dower, and 2d, the Writ of Dower; both relating to widows;
but as widows are formidable persons to go to law against, these actions
are seldom used. The third is the action of Quare Impedit, which would
be brought against me by a parson if I kept him out of his living; but
as the working parsons find it difficult to get a living, this action is also
rare. The fourth is the action of Ejectment, for the recovery of land,
which is the only action that cannot be brought without some ground.
Of personal actions, the most usual are debt, and a few others; but
we will begin by going into debt as slightly as possible. The action of
debt is founded on some contract, real or supposed, and when there has
been no contract, the law, taking a contracted view of matters, will have
a contract implied. , Debt, like every other personal action, begins with
a summons, in which VICTORIA comes “greeting; ” which means,
according to Johnson, “saluting in kindness,” “congratulating,” or
“paying compliments at a distance; ” but, considering the unpleasant

in the style of putting the contending

is of such remote antiquity, that nobody
nows the beginning of it, and this ac-
counts for no one being able to appreci-

and blundering of several generations,

greeting” is, misapplied. The writ commands you to enter an
appearance within eight days, and, by way ef assisting you to make an
appearance, the writ invests you, as it were, with a new suit.
he action of covenant lies for breach of covenant, that is to say, a
promise under seal; and under wafer it is just as binding, for you are
equally compelled to stick to it like wax.
The Action of Detinue lies where a party seeks to recover what is de-
tained from him; though it does not seem that a gentleman detaining a
newspaper more than ten minutes at a coffee-house would be liable to
ſºugh the action would be an ungentlemanly one, to say the
east, of it.
The action of Trespass lies for any injury committed with violence,
such as assault and battery, either actual or implied ;, as, if A, while
making pancakes, throws an egg-shell at B, the law will imply battery,
though the egg-shell was empty.
The action of Trespass on the Case lies, where a party seeks damages
for a wrong to which trespass will not apply—where, in fact, a man has not
been assaulted or hurt in his person, but where he has been hurt in that
tender part—his pocket. Of this action there are two species, called
assumpsit, by which the law—at no time very unassuming—assumes
that a person, legally liable to do a thing, has promised to do it, however
unpromising such person may be ; and trover, which seeks to recover
damages for property which it is supposed the defendant found and
converted, so that an action might perhaps be brought in this form, to
recover from Popery those who have been found and converted to the
use, or rather lost and converted to the abuses, of the Romish Church.
Having gone slightly into the different forms of actions; hº
tapped the reader on the shoulder with a writ in each case, which, b
the way, should be personally served on him at home, though the baili
runs the risk of getting sometimes served out, we shall proceed to

UNPROTECTED ENGLAND.
BEING A GROAN FROM THE EX-UNPROTECTED FEMALE.
“To Mr. Punch.
HOUGH MR. Jones, SIR,
has a great objection. º
my, appearing in print,
for he declares that I’ve
made myself ridiculous
and him too, by the way
in which I’ve come be-
fore the public in your
entertaining Journal,
(though I’m sure MR. J.
was ridiculous enough,
without any letters being
written upon that sub-
ject); still I feel that as
a female, though not now
unprotected (if Mr. j. je
any protection, so much
from home as he is on
his journeys), I ought to
, uplift my humble voice
against the present awful
unprotected state of the
country. I don’t allude
to burglars at present
(though I must say your
artist never can have seen
—sº me, or he would never
have made me in that
- mightcap). . But, Sir, if
it had been only me talking about the unprotected state of the country, you might
have said, as MR. J. altrays does, “There, MRs. J., you’re talking nonsense
again!’ but I don’t speak as a poor, weak woman, now, because I’m afraid, but
I’ve seen it all proved in a book, written by SIR F. B. HEAD, BART., with all the
figures in it, and calculations made, and I feel the serious attention of the married
women of England ought to be called to it. All husbands are not like MR. JonEs,
and one will fisten to reason, though it comes from their wives.
“SIR F. B. HEAD dedicates his É. (in the most flattering manner, I must say) to
unprotected females, in general. Little did I think, when I saw the work on
MR. SMITHERs's table, with such a mice, clean, white cover, what awful things it
had inside of it! I took it up quite promiscuously, but oh, Sir, the state of mind
I was in before I laid it down!
“First, it shows you that there’s France with 408,630 soldiers, and 2,501,000
national guards, and all know what those nasty foreigners are by the specimens we
see in the streets; and there’s Austria with 378,552 soldiers, all horrid, frowsy,
tobacco-smoking butchers ; and Prussia with as many just as bad; and Russia, with
950,000—and what can be expected from men fed on tallow, raw hides, and brandy?
and then there’s poor England with 123,758 soldiers, and no more, and many of
them, I’m afraid, no better than they should be, running after the maids ; for it
was only last week that SMITHERs's cook was near taking laudanum, because of a
corporal in the Scotch ºf . who got all her wages to buy a discharge and go
into the green-grocery and general line, but spent it all, and is a corporal at this
moment. and and never comes near her /
“And if this is the way the British army behaves, in time of peace, to poor British
| females, what is to be expected from these dreadful foreigners in a war? And,
then that horrid book shows that the English men ain't to be trusted—I’ve
º; thought so in regard to one, in particular—and that their confusion increases
with their numbers; as I’m sure, any one may see, who's ever been to a recielo
of the Surrey yomanry, at Wormwood Scrubs, (where I was with the SMITHERs's
no later than last summer) and the mess they got in with one regiment, I’m sure
Ícan’t think what it would be with half a dozen.
“And as for ships and men of war, and navies; every body knows that those
Dover and Boulogne steamers can bring over loads of soldiers, the book says, in
two hours; but, I’m sure, when I went to Boulogne, it seemed a great deal º:
than that—but one thing I must say that I º has forgotten, and that is the
dreadful state of sea-sickness the foreigners would be in—to judge by what I felt
you might knock them down with a feather: until they’d a nice cup of tea, and
a good night's rest.
“However, there is no doubt that any number of these dreadful foreigners may
come up to London tomorrow—and there's that Erposition—who knows whether
the machines may’nt be full of gun-powder and things, and that the artisans and
people, who come over with them mayn't be soldiers in disguise, with belts stuck
# of pistols and daggers—under their—what d'ye-call-em-blue smock-frock
ings .
… $. may believe, my blood did run cold, when I came to where the book
describes the “two hundred thousand young enthusiastic French soldiers, waving
banners in our pure English air, on which are mentally inscribed these words—we
jº, shudder as we transcribe them—(I’m sure I quite shuddered when I
read them)

“I declare as I came to those words, I saw our furniture smashed and the
plate melted, and me struggling with a foreigner in mousta-
chios—and Jones with his throat cut from ear—butiºn't
ear it—
“When the book has made out how easy it would be for
a French army to invade England (and it seems so easy,
one wonders why they haven’t done it ever so long ago),
comes the awfullest chapter—“The Capture of London by a
French army.” It makes one's hair stand on end, to think
of foreign armies encamped in each of the Parks, another |
between Clapham and Camberwell, and a third about
Brition and "Battersea! That couldn't be far from the
SMITHERs's, and how, knowing this, they can have such
a book in the house, I can't think. Then there will be the
horses in the churches, and the officers in the best houses
ºf comrse we should have one at least in Craven Street,
if it was only for my writing this letter; and people may
say what they like about Frenchmen being polite, I’m
sure I found them perfect brutes in the custom-house at
Boulogne—and detachments in the Milbank Penitentiary–
a very proper place for 'em—and in the National Gallery,
and the Docks, and Regent Street. But oh! that chapter
at the end of the book, ‘On the Treatment of Women in
War.” It’s not so much what it says, but the hints are
enough to drive a poor unprotected female out of her
Senses.
“Sir, I have just put the book down.. I feel it’s my duty
to write to you, and call upon the females in the kingdom
rotected and unprotected, to atcaken their husbands, and
É. and fathers, and male relations generally to what
is hanging over us! I don't know SIR F. #. HEAD, BART.,
but I feel what a debt of gratitude is due to him from me
and all the young women—yes, Sir, and all the old women—
in Great Britain, Ireland, and Scotland, and I remain

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION.
T a moment like the present, when
everybody is asking whether the fire
of war, so long smouldering in Ger-
many, is to burst out into flame or to
end in smoke? whether France is to
see the spectacle of Liberty devour-
ing her own children, or her own
children devouring Liberty? whether
England is to become a province of
the Papal dominions, or whether the
Pope will discover that he has gone
beyond his province in doing what he
has done?—though these and other
important interrogatories agitate and
divide the public mind, the question
which really absorbs the attention of
the whole world is—When are we
to have PUNCH'S ALMANACK? This question is being answered
in typographic thunder and telegraphic lightning, by the steam-struck
advertisements of the newspaper press, and the electro-agitated wires of
the Railway Companies.
One half the world is asking “When will PUNCH'S ALMANACK
be published?” and the other half is answering “On the 23rd ** No
one has yet ventured to surmise what the result will be, and we dare
not trust ourselves to divulge the grand secret which in a few days will
burst upon the senses of enraptured millions. What we have already
done has surpassed the wildest anticipations of the most boundless
fancy; but what we are about to do, will as far surpass everything that
has gone before, as Pelion, Ossa, and Olympus, piled one upon the
other, exceed in altitude the pebble on the pavement. We are about
to fire into the country a tremendous broadside of wit and humour
which shall wondrously surpass our ordinary weekly feu de joie' and
though even this comprises a mitraille, as the French would call it, of
a round of shot from sixteen columns, each comprising some fifty to a
hundred jokes, the volley we are about to deliver can only be slightly
conceived by multiplying every fifty by five hundred, and recollecting
that our ammunition has no lead in its composition, but consists of a
material like the diamond, with all its most brilliant and most cutting
qualities combined.
POLICE REGULATIONS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF
PUNCH'S AIIMANACK.
N order to preserve order during the exe-
cution of the orders for Punch's Almanack,
the following orders will be issued as to
the order in which the public will present
themselves at the office on the 23rd.
All persons belonging to the trade must
enter Fleet Street at the Farringdon
Street end, and form in six rows along
the south-side as far as Bride Court.”
Private individuals, requiring single
copies, must enter the City through
Temple Bar, or Chancery Lane, and fall
into the line at the Law Life Insurance
Office. As soon as the line extends to
the corner of Bride Court, a fresh row
must be formed, and so on untill there are
twelve abreast, after which no more will
be admitted into the City; but those coming may leave their names with
the City Toll Collector, which will entitle them to a place in the pro-
cession on a subsequent day.
After being served, the trade will draw off by St. Bride's Church, and
retire over Blackfriars' Bridge, entering the City again by London,
Southwark, or any of the other Bridges, should they require to do so.
The public after having obtained their copies, will pull off to the north
side of Fleet Street and retire by Clerkenwell, re-entering the City,
should they desire to do so, by the City Road and Moorgate Street.
Foreign Ambassadors, producing their credentials under the sign
manual of their respective Sovereigns, and presenting them to the City
Toll Collector, will be allowed to proceed without reference to the
foregoing rules.
BARON WON REICHENBACH*S PHILOSOPHY
OF A KISS.
(A Lecture for the Ladies' College.)
“WHAT’s in a kiss?” demands a once popular song, ladies.
“There’s no harm in a kiss,” replies the self-responsive lyric.
“”Tis a pure pledge of friendship to man.”
The answer is vague, if not evasive.
most of those lips which lend the question its interest, prove rather
trying—“Physico-Physiological Researches on the Dynamics of Mag-
netism, Electricity, Heat, Light, Crystallisation, and Chemism, in their
Relations to Wital Force.”
Von REICHENBAch writes this book to prove that he has discovered
a new force or principle in Nature, similar to electricity, only immensely
more subtle than the electric fluid. This—what d'ye call it?—the
Baron calls Od. Well he may, some of you will perhaps remark—
judging merely from the sound of the word. Others may suggest that
the letters should have been reversed, and that the 0d is, properly
speaking, a Do. Od, according to BARon Won Reich ENBAch, emanates
from everything in Nature, more or less; but especially from magnets,
crystals, the sun, moon, and stars, and the tips of the ſingers. It is
luminous in the dark to sensitive persons; it affects their nerves of
touch; and it is what operates in animal magnetism. Besides escaping
from the fingers' ends, it also issues powerfully from the lips; and this
brings us to Won REIchenbach’s theory of a kiss. Punch quotes
DR. AshburtNER's translation, page 257, of the treatise of the astound-
ing Baron;–
“We here arrive at a not uninteresting explanation of a hitherto obscure matter—
the import of the kiss. The lips form one of the foci of the biod, and the flames which
our poets describe, do actually blaze there. * * *
“It may be asked, how this can agree with the circumstance that the mouth is
od-negative? This, however, does harmonise very well with the fact; for the kiss
gives nothing—it desires and strives merely, it sucks in and sips. The kiss is, there-
fore, not a negation, but a physical and moral negativity.”
“Biod,” ladies, means vital Od; the mesmeric influence, in fact. The
somewhat curious description of a kiss, as being “not a negation, but
a physical and moral negativity,” is simply as much as to say, that the
kiss is a decided fact; but that the act of kissing is not conferring a
favour, but taking a liberty; which seems true.
Certainly, a genuine kiss, is not a negation, but, on the contrary, a
strong affirmation, which the lips cannot express so forcibly by any
articulate phrase—“Je vous aime”—“Zoë mou sas agapo”—or ditto in
plain English.
But neither can a kiss be a “negativity” in all cases—at least, accord-
ing to the experience of Mr. Punch. It may be so when A snatches a
kiss from B. But if every kiss is a negativity, when A and B kiss one
another at the same moment, the kisses of both are negativities. Now,
negativity implies positivity. Therefore, if A is kissed by B, and B by
A at the same moment, their kisses are both positivities, because they
are both negativities, which is absurd. If negativity does not imply posi-
tivity, then, when A and B mutually kiss, neither of the two imparts
any Fº gratification to the other, which is still more absurd. And
on the last supposition, the answer to the question, “What’s in a kiss?”
would be, “Nothing at all,” the absurdity of which is self-evident.
BARON voN REICHENBAch leaves reciprocity out of the question, as
if he had no idea of it. His od theory of kissing shows that he is little
versed in the practice, which, if it were all a “negativity,” would be
truly odious. There would be nothing more pleasant in lovers' kisses
than there is in kissing the book to make an affidavit. The Baron
should try a few experiments relative to this branch of his subject: he
had . come to England at Christmas, and perform them under the
mistletoe.

IMPORTANT LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.-PROBABLE
SECESSIONS FROM THE BAR.
We have heard with considerable regret, that the same spirit of
ceremonialism, which has caused so much division in the Church, has
at length penetrated to the Courts of Law, and is likely to lead to some
secessions of a very sweeping character. For some time, past MR.
BRIEFLEss, immediately on his arrival in Westminster Hall, has been
in the habit of going through a series of absurd mummeries, which have
at last attracted the attention of the Judges. It seems that the learned
gentleman, no sooner appears upon the back row, in any of the Courts,
than he bows with great pertinacity to the Bench, and if the salutation
is not noticed or acknowledged, he proceeds to cough with such violence,
that attention is sure to be attracted towards him. He, also, has dis-
covered, or believes that he has discovered, somewhere in the books, an
allusion to an office connected with that of Ancient Serjeant, and to
which he gives the name of Ancient Junior. By virtue of his supposed
right to this imaginary position, he claims pie-audience of | other
juniors, and he sometimes causes much confusion in the Court by alter-
cation with any of the younger members of the bar, whom he will not
allow to rise without molestation, until they have recognised his ancient
juniorship, when he permits them to proceed by courtesy.
He has also, on more than one occasion, behaved in such an extra-
ordinary manner with respect to motions of course, insisting upon
handing them in direct to the Judge, without the intervention of the
Usher, that once or twice the Bench has expressed displeasure; but
MR. BRIEFLEss insists that as the barrister hands the motion in, the
old law knows no intervening hand, and he cannot conscientiously avail
himself of such a go-between.
These ceremonials are now carried to such an extreme, that the
highest legal authority will probably be called upon to interfere, and the
result may be the secession of the learned gentleman from the Hall of
Westminster. Some correspondence has already passed between MR.
BRIEFless and a high legal authority, but we do not at present ſeel
called upon to give it publicity.
MAIDS OF ALL-POPERY-WORK.
A LATE Puseyite, turned inside out to a Roman Catholic, and
rechristened upon his turning, IGNATIUs—FATHER IGNATIUs (the
Loyola is for a time suppressed)—has called on all Catholics to send
female servants of their own creed—servants ºf the lowest degree, even
to that of scullions—into the houses of Protesants, that the heretics, or
at least the forlorn and foredoomed children of the heretics, may be
lured into the fold of the Pope. FATHER IGNATIUs has not preached
to careless hearts or deaf ears: many female servants, from lady's-maid
to the above-named scullion, are at this moment in the bosoms of Pro-
testant families, wriggled there to carry out the blessed intentions of
FATHER IGNATIUs. The subjoined correspondence—(for the present
we cannot disclose the source whence we obtained it)—directed to
FATHER IGNATIUs, has been forwarded to CARDINAL Wise MAN, who,
in the handsomest manner, has offered fine paper copies for the service
of MR. BENNETT, late of St. Barnabas.
“Belgravia Square, Day of St. Tippets.
“Most REveREND FATHER,--I entered my present service on the
day of St. BLANCMANGE; and—my character as a Protestant lady's-maid
who could dress hair, having deceived the scrutiny of even the heretical
andmother, I was very soon received into the confidence of
Rs. *, *, * and her three daughters. In another month, and they
will all be brought over. They have thrice attended mass—service
believe they call it, at St. Barnabas; and, as I say, in a month at most,
they must i. at the feet of the Cardinal. I have insinuated under the
tº: of each of the young ladies a pocket º of the pious and
lessed PETER DENs, and the good fruits of that holy book are livelily
apparent.
‘I have promised Miss LEONorA—(she proposes to call herself

stubborn heretics, only fit for the Cardinal to deal with—but at last
have hopes. Last Sunday but one we had a goose, which I singed
with a copy of his Holiness's Bull; which has done, precious work.
Besides this, I’ve had all the night-lights of MR. and MRs. JENKINson

But he’s now quite used up—and perhaps it is as well.

To point an antipapal speech, should we get applause thereby ?
No; your hearers all would laugh at you, and would sing out “All my

“SIR, “Mildew Hall, Dec. 13, 1850.
“I am an old gentleman, and of an old way of thinking. I
hate all new-fangled notions. Most of the advertisements that 1 meet
with in the newspapers annoy me. Nine out of ten of them are puffs of
some stupid invention, or other novelty pretending to be an improve-
ment. But now here, Sir, is an advertisement copied from the Times
of this day, which really was quite a treat to me to read. It shows that
the fine jà spirit of John BULL is not yet extinct, in spite of all your
“progress” and philanthropy. Here it is, Sir; and much good may it
o you, as it has done me:–
RIMLEY MURDER—The Winter approaching, and taking into con-
sideration the late murders and burglaries, it behoves all persons, either town or
country residents, to be armed with a weapon of defence; all parties desirous of so
doing will find a very large ASSORTMENT OF PISTOLS AND GUNS, at all
prices, Life Preservers, Blunderbusses, &c., at"— &c., &c, &c.
Eh, Sir? What do you say to this? Doesn't it, remind you of the
fine old times described by FIELDING, when a walk from Westminster
to the City had the excitement of adventure, from the chance of being
robbedº Here, Sir, we have the glorious days of DICK TURPIN an
JERRY ABERSHAw come back again. We shall now be in a position
thoroughly to enjoy the Beggar's Opera—which excellent old play, I
hope will be revived at some of the theatres—as once more holding the
mirror up to society. Of course I do not mean to say that I should
like to be robbed and murdered; but, Sir, I must confess I do feel a
sort of pleasure and gratification in the idea that it is once more neces-
to keep arms in the house. Often have I sighed when I recollected
the old blunderbuss that I used as a little boy to see hanging on the
wall when I went with my father to the County Bank at Mouldyhurst.
There is nothing in my opinion, Sir, like shooting a thief when you
catch him; and I hope we shall return to that sensible plan, and to the
good old precaution of setting steel-traps, and spring-guns; for it is
quite clear that 3. modern preventive police is no protection what-

Cardinal and Goose.
REALLY, it is too bad of the public to hiss and hoot that very clever
actor, MR. Rogers, when he plays Cardinal Pandulph to MR.MACREADy’s
King John, at the Haymarket. We all know, of course, that the dis-
approbation is meant for the character itself, and not at the manner
in which it is acted. But it is not usual to hiss Iago or Shylock, because
their characters are odious; on the º the more perfectly their
personator expresses roguery, and malice,, the more he is applauded.
As sibilation is always an unpleasant sound to a performer's ear, Punch
would suggest that popular feeling as regards Cardinals might be
evinced much more pleasantly to MR. Rogers, as well, as more un:
mistakeably, and even more loudly, by cheering that gentleman instead
of hissing him.
The Queen at the Cattle Show.
WE are glad to see that the QUEEN honoured the Cattle Show this
year with her presence. HER MAJESTY had seen beef-eaters before:
she has now seen what they are made of; and must, no doubt, have
been highly gººd by a sight proving how many of them she has
among her subjects.

A GENT'S OPINION ON HATS.
ERTAINLY, Jolly
- OLD PUNCH, I
- must say that, in
: all your observa-
El tions about hats,
; you have hit the
right nail on the
head. Nothing
can be more in-
= convenient than
our present cha-
peau. Now, wit-
S ness the hats at
* the Promenade
Concerts, or any
of our theatres,
Nºs when ‘God save
the Queen' is being
: sung. . There is
an instant cry of
: ‘Hats off!’ Yes
it’s all very we
to cry ‘Hats off!”
but when you
have taken your
, hat off, where are
- you to put it
* to ? Your arms
are 'pinioned to
|your side as tight
(as a trussed fowl.
Your hat is con-
{sequently either
knocked off, or smashed’in, or else wedged tight over your eyes;
in which elegant position every one takes advantage of giving you
a friendly knock on the head, whilst you have not even the pleasure
of seeing who your assailant is; and if you do succeed in lifting
off your hat in time, it is very little better off than on, for you
are obliged to hold it up in the air, whilst all the solos are beingſº
with innumerable variations, on the cornet, bassoon, ophicleide, an
iccolo; or else you must hold it by your side, or between your legs—
in which position it is sure to issue forth more like the saucer to
a flower-pot, or the iron lid of a coal-hole, or anything else that is
round i flat, and not usually worn on the top of a gent's head.
“No less than six valuable hats of mine were ruined in this way, and
you are at liberty, dear old Punch, to inspect their mangled remains at
my rooms, any day you like. Latterly, I have grown wiser, and always
go to the concerts in a Turkish, or a felt or a smoking cap; something
which I could either stow away in my pocket, or wear on my cranium,
as I liked. In fact, our present style of beaver is quite unfit for any
place of amusement, and to take one to an º; party, why, it is
º dangerous. I suppose some one comes in for the good hats,
ut I know I never take a bad hat to a soirée, but I am sure to come
away with a worse one.
“Some reform, as Joey HUME would say, is terribly wanted, for I
know a whole gang of young fellows who, like myself, are heartily tired
of being treated like so many tenpenny-nails, by having a body of arms
descending, like a shower of hammers, and knocking us perpetually on
the head. We are not to blame—the fault lies in our hats. #

PUSEYITE CATTLE SHOW.
MR. PUNCH is happy to publish the announcement, that a new
Smithfield Club is to . established on Puseyite and Mediaeval prin-
ciples, to promote retrogression, in opposition to the spirit of the age.
Instead of the fattest of cattle, will be exhibited the leanest of kine–
anchorite, hermit, and recluse stock; sheep of the skin-and-bone foreign
variety (for shearing), and ascetic pigs. A list, placed over the head of
each, will specify the articles of diet on which the creature has been
starved down to its particular extreme of emaciation—as split-peas,
ulse, oatmeal, sorrel, dandelions,— perhaps thistles—and red-herrings.
he dead stock up-stairs will include thaumaturgic mummies and relics
in great plenty, and an extensive assortment of scourges, hair-shirts,
iron belts and collars, and the, like implements of self-annoyance.
There will be store of images and beads for those who have a taste in
such articles, and of course, an abundance of crosses; but the most
remarkable crosses in the Exhibition will be those shown below—the
crosses between the Roman Bull and the Oxford breed of soft-horns.
SMITHFIELD CLUB CATTLE SHOW.
(From our own Protectionist.)
THIS melancholy event came off last week, when prizes were dis-
tributed to the breeders of the very leanest stock—a brass band, the
horns and ophicleides draperied with black crape, playing funereal airs at
intervals. The results º free trade were never more shockingly con-
spicuous than in the shadowy forms of steers and oxen; whilst there
was a pen of a dozen pigs, scarcely one of which was visible to the
naked eye. We observed more than one benevolent lady weeping pearls
over indefinite things that had vainly struggled to become porkers.
There were sheep that were nothing but the merest bladebones, here
and there covered with threads of worsted. The QUEEN and PRINCE
ALBERT, with two of the little Princes, visited the spectacle, contem-
plating it with becoming gravity. The Prince carried away the prize
for a bull that was only visible when placed under a glass of forty Opera
power. Occasionally, an acute ear might detect sounds that a liberal
mind might interpret as ghost-like bellowings—spectral bleatings—with
now and then an asthmatic attempt at a grunt. The DUKE OF WEL-
LINGTON's battering-ram is not to be seen when looked at in front;
but only from either side. It is said to have been fed upon old drum:
heads, with occasionally the ribands of a recruiting-sergeant chopped
and made into a warm mash. We ought, by the way, to have remarked
that the DUKE of RichMond attended, as President, in deep mourn-
ing; and bore in his face and manner the profoundest traces of unutter-
able woe. However, let us proceed to give the list of prizes, all of them
so many triumphant proofs of the withering influence of Free-Trade.
OxEN OR steers.
The DUKE, OF RuTLAND carried away the £30 prize for the thinnest
steer. It had been fed on waste copies of Protectionist pamphlets with
the tune of “The Roast Beef of Old England,” º in A flat
on a tin trumpet. Some idea may be entertained of the nicety with
which the animal had been brought to the lowest point of life, L-when
we state that five minutes after the noble duke received the
rize, the thing died; all the brass band braying “The Roast
eef of Old England” for half-an-hour in the vain hope of reviving
it. The beast was distributed among the Marylebone poor; all of
them ordered to appear in spectacles to see, if possible, their proper
quantities.
LONG-WOOLLED SHEEP.
The DUKE of ATHQLI, bore off the first prize of £20, for an extra:
ordinary specimen of highland sheep, that both puzzled and delighted
the judges. The sheep had been reared upon Highland thistles, accord-
ing to the Duke's well known hospitality; and these thistles sojudici-
ously served, that they had taken the place of the wool growing through
the animal's sides, and coating them all over with their brushy points.
The REv. MR. BENNETT, was present, and was much delighted with
his wool of thistles: he is to be presented with a comforter—the thin
will be very popular by Christmas, to be called the Atholl Bosom Frien
—woven from the fleece. The web, in place of the vulgar linen shirt,
is expected to become very general with the ladies and gentlemen who
feed upon the honey hived at St. Barnabas.
PIGs.
CoIONEL SIRTHORP took the prize for the Pig of Lead; so small a
#. that it might creep down the tube of a MoRDAN’s pencil. MR.
IsrAELI sent the shadow of a sow; one of his practical epigrams,
showing he had ceased to have even a real squeak for Protection; he
also sent a porker that, from its largeness of size—where smallness was
the object—was deemed hopeless of any reward. However, MR. Dis-
RAELI carefully removing a muzzle from the pig's snout, the animal
collapsed flat as a crush-hat. The fact is MR. DISRAELI had, as he
afterwards averred, seemingly fattened the hog. upon a pair of bellows.
There are, we have heard, pigs that see the wind; whether MR. Dis-
RAELI's pig is of that sort, the eloquent Protectionist said not. He
however took a second prize; and next year promises to exhibit a whole
; of the smallest pigs in the world, suckled upon phials of aqua-
OrūIS.
COWS.
The leap of the Cow that lº. over the Moon was exhibited b
the Duke of RichMond. This Cow had been fed on the printer's #.
from the Standard newspaper, which sufficiently accounts for the daring
altitude of its flight. The Duke was proffered the gold medal, but
resolutely refused any such vanity.
In conclusion, we are happy to say that the Exhibition was well
attended. The thousands º our countrymen who witnessed the
wretched condition of the cattle must have carried away with them
the profound conviction, that the days of Free Trade are numbered;
and that a º return to Protection is called for by the interests
of man and brute-from Dukes to steers, from Parliament men to
plgS.

As to inform the driver that my sister

EXTRACTS FROM THE IRISH HUE AND CRY.
* Tony GºwAN is advertised as having lost “A Pig with a very long
tail, and a black spot on the tip of its snout that curls up behind.”
A Cow is described as “very difficult to milk, and of no use to any
one but the owner, with one horn much longer than the other.”
John Hawkins is alluded to as having “a pair of quick grey eyes,
with little or no whiskers, and a Roman nose, that has a great difficulty
in looking any one in the face.”
Betsy WATERTON is accused of having “absconded with a chest of
drawers and a cock and hen, and has red hair and a broken tooth, none
of which are her own.” -
The Manager of the Savings' Bank at Dunferry, near Goofowran, is
ken of in these terms: “He had on, when last seen, a pair of cor-
uroy trousers, with a tremendous squint rather the worse for wear,
besides an affected lisp, which he endeavours to conceal with a pair of
gold spectacles.”
A burglar has his portrait taken in the following manner. “He has
little or no hair, but black eyes on a turned-up nose, which is dyed
k to conceal its greyness.”
THE PREMIER'S LETTER_WRITER TO THE POPE.
MR. Punch, as private and confidential Secretary, to the Premier
begs to transmit the subjoined letter, together with a more forma
official communication, by the ordinary medium of conveyance, to His
Holiness:–
“MY DEAR SIR, “Downing Street, Dec. 14, 1850.
“I wish to address you—plain MASTAI FERRETTI—as equally
lain John Russell. My object in writing this note is, to render the
#. message º: it P. clear to you; so that
there shall be no mistake about it. Of course you are aware, by this
time, of the violent excitement which has been occasioned among us by
your division of England into bishopricks. Do not suppose that this
was in the least degree created by my letter, directed to the country
through the Bishop of DURHAM. On the contrary, to that letter alone
it is owing, that the excitement was not much more violent. If I had
not written it, I don’t know what would have happened, and I know
not what will happen if I do not fulfil the pledge it contains. I have as
good as º the people legal redress, by abolishing your bishops'
territorial titles. That has, comparatively, quieted them. I must keep
my promise, or be universally scºuted, or you must take the affair out
of my hands, by revoking your bull,and retranslating your bishops to
Melipotamus, and Utopia, and Jericho.
“As Vicars Apostolic, or whatever else you may please to call them
except bishops of places in England, there, is no objection at all to
their remaining here. Our people don't wish to te them in the
slightest manner, or to prevent them from º; and teaching their
peculiar doctrines with perfect freedom; but the British public, mind,
you, will not have those doctrines preached and taught under what
appears to be its sanction and approval.
‘Now, my dear Sir, you must see that to call a MR. Solomon,
ARCHBishop of WesTMINstER, is nothing more nor less of a trick than
making use of Westminster's name to indorse a bill. So with the rest
of your bishopricks throughout England-I forbear from qualifying
these transactions with the terms which Ishould be justified in apply-
ing to them; but really, my dear Sir, I must say that this kind of thing
won't do; and you cannot be allowed to take these liberties with our
credit. Understand, once for all, that John Bull, is resolved to be a
bull to himself; and let me recommend you-Ispeak vernacularly, not
as an expositor-to draw in those horns of yours, or else you will place
me between those of a very unpleasant dilemma. I have the honour to
be, my dear Sir,
“Yours, as you behave yourself,
“The Rt. Rev. Mastai Ferretti, “John Russel.L.”
Bishop ºf Rome.”
THE WOMEN OF WINDSOR,
THE Women of Windsor have been petitioning the Qºns on the
Papal aggression, and among other matters, they express" the gratitude
of their hearts for the atmosphere with which the court is surrounded.”
We know that some º: about a court give themselves precious
airs, but we cannot say whether these form part of the atmosphere so
prized by the Women of Windsor. The address has too much of the
scent of Windsor º about it to please us, and we are pretty sure that
HER MAJESTY's good sense will revolt somewhat against the conclusion
come to by the Women of Windsor, that “the royal example has thrown
a lustre over their maternal duties;” or in other words, rendered it
genteel” to have a family. The maternal duties when properly per-
formed, as in the case of Wigton LA, give lustre to the highest station,
but as to their deriving any lustre from it, the Queen herself would tell
the Women of Windsor that the first and most natural of our affections
can require no sanction from a court to add to their respectability. We
never wish to be hard upon the soft sex; however, we must tell the
Women of Windsor that there is quite enough twaddle and toadyism
in the world without their adding to the stock, especially when they
address it to an illustrious lady whose aversion to humbug of every
description is proverbial.
Going a Little too Far.
THE BIshop of London wrote to MR. St. BARNABAs, BENNETT
the following mild caution:-
“I really fear you are carrying things too far.”
We agree, for once, with the Bishop of London, and must say that
when a gentleman runs from Pimlico to Rome, and carries his princi.
ples to the extreme lengths, which MR. St. B. BENNETT has done, that
it is “carrying things a little too far.” If the reverend gentleman were
to carry his principles out altogether—we mean out of the Church of
England—we think it would be very much better for the interests of all
parties.

PUNCH ON SPECIAL PLEADING.
CHAPTER THE SECOND.-OF THE DECLARATION.
THE writ being now served, it is next to be returned, and this is
sometimes done by giving it back at once to the bailiff or throwing it in
his face. Such quick returns as these would bring such very small
profit to a plaintiff that they are not allowable, and the writ can only be
returned by the sheriff bringing it back, on a certain day, into the
superior court. He then gives a short account, in writing, of the
manner in which the writ has been executed; but, if the bailiff has been
pumped upon—as we find reported in ShoweR-or pelted with oysters,
as in SHELLEY's case, or kicked down stairs, as he was in Foot against
the Sheriff, it does not seem that the particulars need be set forth.
If the defendant does not appear within eight º: after the writ has
o you,” the plaintiff
may, in most cases, appear for him; and this shows how true it is that
appearances are often deceitful and treacherous; for, when a plaintiff
appears for a defendant, it is only to have an opportunity of appearing
against him at the next step.
The pleadings now commence, which were originally delivered orally
by the parties themselves in open Court, when success might depend on
length of tongue; but, the parties themselves being got rid of, in the
modern practice, and the lawyers coming in to represent them, success
usually depends on length of purse. The object of pleading, whether
oral or written, is to bring the parties to an issue; which means
literally, a way out; but, in practice, the effect of getting plaintiff an
defendant to an issue is to let them both re y in.
Almost all pleas, except those of the simplest kind, must besigned by
a barrister; who does not usually draw the plea, but he merely draws
the half guinea for the use of his name. The pleading begins with the
declaration, in which the plaintiff is supposed to state the cause of ac-
tion; but in which he gives such an exaggerated accountof his grievances,
that not more than one-tenth of º
force and violence, seized, laid hold of, pulled
with his fists, gave and struck a great many violent blows, and strokes,
on and about, divers parts of the plaintiff's nose.” If JóNEs has been
É. into custody by SMITH, without sufficient reason; and Jones
rings an action for false imprisonment; instead of saying, “he was com-
eiled to go to a station house,” he declares that the defendant. "with
orce, and arms, seized, laid hold of, and with great violence pulled, and
dragged, and gave, and struck a great many violent blows and strokes,
and forced, and compelled him—the plaintiff-to go in and along divers
public streets and highways, to a police office; whereby the plaintiff
was not only greatly hurt, bruised and wounded, but was also kept.
If SNooks's dog bites Thomson's pet lamb, S.Nooks declares “That
defendant did wi º and injuriously keep a certain dog, he, the defen-
dant, well knowing that the said dog was and continued to be fierce and
mad, and accustomed to attack, bite, injure, hurt, chase, worry, harass
tear, agitate, wound, lacerate, snap at, and kill sheep and lambs, and
that the said dog afterwards, to wit, on the-day of , and
divers other days, did attack (&c. &c. down to) and kill one hundred
sheep and one hundred lambs of the plaintiff; whereby the said sheep
and the said lambs (it will be remembered there was only one lamb.)
were greatly terrified, damaged, injured, hurt, deteriorated, fightened,
depreciated, floored, flustered, and flabbergasted, to the damage of the
plaintiff of £–., and therefore he brings his suit.”
The various forms of declaration are so numerous, that they fill a
volume of 700 large º of Chitty, who is quite chatty on this dry
subject, so much does he find to say with regard to it. To this able and
amusing writer we refer those who are curious to know how a school-
master may declare for “work and labour, care, diligence, and attend-
ance of himself, his ushers and teachers, there performed and bestowed in
and about the teaching, instructing, boarding, educating, lodging, #.
ging, enlightening, thrashing, washing, whipping, and, otherwise soundly
improving divers infants and persons.”. These, and almost all other
. causes of action, are dealt with fully in the pages to which
we allude, and all therefore who wish the treat of going to law, are
referred to the treatise alluded to.
Musical Intelligence.
THE celebrated Harp of Ireland is, we are informed, to be thoroughly
repaired and improved. The old strings, that were always º: or
jangling, are to be replaced by entirely new ones, manufactured from

capabilities of the instrument, rendering its powers equal to the tune of

MR. PUNCH'S ADDRESS TO THE GREAT CITY OF
CASTLEBAR.
E Men of Mayo! MR. HUGHEs,
the ºg of the Castlebar
Industrial Society of Gentle-
men' Your letter, with its
enclosures, has come to hand;
and as the Castlebar Industrial
Society appears desirous to give
º to its resolutions, I
ve the honour to print them,
in this the last number of my
eriodical, which appears in this
Fe=º ast week of the melanchol
| CASTLE tº ... j. “ y
“REsolved: That in consequence of
the attacks made on the Catholic
religion of this country, as well as on
all Catholics indiscriminately, all over
the world, by that notorious paper
called Punch: notorious for many
falsehoods and wicked intentions; and
although the subscription is paid for
some time in advance, the Committee
are unanimously of opinion that it
would be encouraging a repetition of
similar falsehoods and designs, as well
as encouraging that fanatical system
of ignorance and intolerance in the
misguided English people, to receive
it, for the future, into their Reading-
Rooms; and our Clerk is directed to
give intimation of this our intention
to the Proprietor, as well as to send
him a copy of this Resolution; and
that the Telegraph, the Freeman's
Journal, and Tablet newspapers, be
supplied a copy, requesting that same
will be. º”. their patriotic
papers.
It appears from the above statement, (1) that in consequence of the attacks made
by the notorious Punch on the Catholic religion of Ireland, and, indeed, of all other
countries, (and although, the subscription is paid for some time in advance,) the
Committee of the Castlebar Society will not receive the misguided English people
into their reading-rooms; and (2) that the Clerk is instructed to inform the Pro-
rietor; and that the editors of three lish newspapers shall “be supplied a copy” of
#. resolution, requesting “that same” will be inserted in their papers.
As the Proprietor of the benighted English people, I must grieve that the doors of
your Athenæum are closed to them; considering “the subscription is paid for some
time in advance,” this measure is hard upon {m}. people; but as your Committee
has come to the resolution, I have but to record “that same,” and deplore the loss
which has befallen this infatuated nation,
Sir, and good friend—this is the end of the . my paper will appear upon a da
which, since the first of Christmas Days, has been consecrated to peace and good.
will; and I am not going to lose my temper at this season, or have a word of any-
thing but kindness, for you or any other. Irishman, Anglican, Roman, Puseyite,
Gorhamite, Mormonite, or what not. This is a truce day-and ought to be held as
those days were held in the Peninsular campaigns, when the French and the Anglo-
Irish outposts came down and talked to each other in a friendly manner, and handed
each other their beef, or their brandy-flasks across the water with a “Bonjour
PADDY!” or “How d'ye do, Mounseer?” I hope, in the neighbouring capit
of Tuam, His Grace }. Lord Archbishop will have as good a #. as my Lord
Bishop. I hope his Eminence at St. George's and his Lordship at Fulham will be
pretty cheerful; and Doctor ADIER will, have a comfortable turkey (without
sausages) and DoctoR Cum MING a pleasant dinner, though they both of them belong
to sects which are not in the habit of º: Christmas.
And I would that, the year ending so, the next could begin and continue so; and
that you and I, MR. Hughes, could have no cause for disputing. But before you
accuse me and others of making attacks upon Catholics all over the world, see, my
good Sir, how it is, and since when it is, that these hostilities have begun. Not
two months ago we were living in peace and quiet; not two months ago, and I had
the benefit (or somebody to whom you showed that touching mark of confidence)
of your subscription to my paper; not very many months ago, when your people of
Mayo were in straits, who came to help? whose money was it that supplied you?
who brought Indian corn and rice to you?, Did relief come from Rome or from
London? It was the English Protestants that helped you—and who showed that
their meaning was peace and jº -
What was it altered the relations of amity? Who was it began war? Let the
Lion of St. Jarlath's himself say, was the truce broken by us, or was it the Pope's
§ that marched upon, us to take possession of our territory?, Industrial
Castlebarians! we appeal to you, and, ask who gave the º for, the fight, and
whether it was not Eminence with his pastoral crook that first occasioned
the Shaloo? Yes, it was the march of that confounded prelate from the Flaminian
Gate, who came upon us “rubente tibiá sacras jaculatus arces,” and caused this
abominable strife and uproar.
Before that, we were living in peace and freedom; before that, if the services of the
|A|| º
* Ll
Bishop of MELIPOTAMUs were not required at that remote see, he was quite welcomellik
to live in Golden Square; before that, our Catholic friends
lived in confidence with us, and we laughed and worked
together; FATHER IGNATIUs was as much at liberty to
wear a beard as MR. MUNTz; FATHER FABER might wear
his cloak; MR.BENNETT mightlight his candles; the Lion of
St. Jarlath's might growl now and anon—but Chume is a
distant place and the voice of Mayo is not very loud in this
city; we were all at peace and loving each other, ortolerating
each other, which is the next thing; when his Eminence Y.
his confounded crimson foot into our premises, and our whole
empire is at strife; LoRD John begins to cry out “Mum-
mery!”. Doctor NewMAN begins to tellus that we are all
—I need not say what ; the Bishop of LoNDON begins to
blow out poor MR.BENNETT's candles; the boys begin to hoot
the Oratorians in the streets; the Irish begin to thrash the
policemen (“I’et the Pope, give the word, we’re the
childthren of the Cruseeders,” as MR. AMBRose, PHILLIPs
says); Punch (who mustalwaysbe a Protestant) begins to cari-
cature his Eminence, and to laugh at his stockings; and my
honest Castlebar Industrial Society publishes, not a bull, but
a resolution full of bulls; and there’s brawling, and bicker-
ing, and broken heads, and friends parting, and fighting
and fury all round.
Ah, MR. Hughes—ah, ye men of the Castlebar Athenayum!
it’s hardtothink that the Pope of RoME, who had been got
to allow one little Protestant Chapel to exist in his city, in
the midst of these verydisputes—in the midst of these shrieks
for freedom and fair play and liberty of conscience with
which his officers are invoking the genius of our country
—it is hard, I say, that the Pope of RQME should have had
that one little Protestant gº shut up ! On this
Christmas Day our P. can find no refuge within the
Pope’s city, but must go out of the Flaminian Gate to say
their prayers. . Round the walls of his capital, monuments
imperishable of the constancy of Christian men, are caves
ºcatacombs, in which the first bishops and believers in
his faith worshipped and died in secret. The symbol of
his creed is raised up triumphantly in the arena, where its
martyrs of old braved torture and overcame death; and the
apartments of his º: are still decorated with pictures
representing, and lauding the slaughter of . Protestants.
º me! that Christian people should ever have sale for
those portraits or painted them'. You who sneer at the
beadle who keeps guard at the shrine of SAINT Edward,
what say you to the librarian who shows you the medal
of the Yº. of BARTHOLOMEw? If a Pope could
absolve from allegiance to ELIZABETH, excuse us at least
for thinking that the same fate might befal the successors
of either. See, at any rate, that there are reasons why we
must differ from you; and why, when you make your own
claim, plant your own standard, appeal to your own pedi-
gree, we should advance ours in our turn.
And when the battle begins again—MAY THE RIGHT
SIDE WIN–that is a toast which we all of us can drink on
this day of truce; and which concerns the humblest persons
engaged as much as it does the Primate of all England, in
whichever part of Lambeth he be. May the Right Side
all Win, and the fight be conducted with manly fair-play.
The Sweating System.
THE venerable old proverb has recorded the melancholy
fact, that “It takes nine tailors, to make a man;”. and
really, from the miserable way in which the Jew “sweating”
masters treat them, one might be induced to believe it as
a truth; for their wages, are so shamefully small, that it
may be said, “It takes the wages of nine tailors to make
the pay of an ordinary workman.”
HEAVY SLEEP.
A PERson cannot sleep, we are told, when he has any-
thing heavyweighing upon his mind, and we have felt this
heaviness of sleep ourselves, most particularly at this time
of the year, when we have found it totally impossible to
compose our minds comfortably to sleep, owing to the
number of Christmas Waits.
The Cardinal Controversy.
Both sides in this controversy declare that the question
is so plain, “that it is quite unanswerable;” but from the
number of letters that have been written upon the subject,
and #" endless answers they have received, it hardly looks
6 1U.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHRISTMAS BEEF IN THE CITY.
EARLY all the streets of Lon-
| don last week, were more or
ºf less hung with prize beef.
Tallow-chandlers, and , soap-
boilers, as they looked upon
the carcases, paid homage to
the fat, and cooks and kitchen-
maids dropped curtsies to per-
quisites in perspective... But
of all the show-beef exhibited
no carcase soworthily appealed
to the admiration of a discrimi-
nating public as the carcase of
an ox, destined, as we heard,
for the LoRD MAYOR's table
during the dinner festivities of
the season—it was no other
than the carcase of the last
bullock, that, driven from
Smithfield market, broke
shop-windows, knocked down
horses, and in Bowling-Green-
Lane lifted an old woman
“into the . air several feet,
letting her fall near the walls”
ofanappropriateburial-ground,
which, as a final tenant, she
narrowly escaped. Further
the bullock gored a man name
THOMAS LAGAN; who two
days afterwards died in St.
- - Bartholomew's.
It will be readily conceded that this bullock was—especially for the
City of London—the prize bullock of the season, as windicating the
civic wisdom that clings, to Smithfield Market as a no less vital than
venerable institution. The carcase was tastefully decorated with black
ribands; and will be brought to the civic table to solemn music, the
“Dead Margh” taking, for the nonce, the place of “The Roast Beef of
Old England.” All the champions and defenders of Smithfield Market
have been invited, by the LoRD MAYOR to partake of what may em-
phatically be called, the City Prize Bullock.
BARE PROBABILITY.
WE have heard of a state of surliness comparable only with that of
“a bear with a sore head;” but it has been found that a bear with a
$ore eye is a still more unmanageable animal. Science has therefore
been |...} occupied in operating on the ursine organs of vision, as it
occasionally does upon the human eye for cataract. A curious account
has lately appeared of the treatment of bears for this affection; and,
We are º to say, the attempt has been so far successful, that we
shall not be under the necessity of seeing at the Zoological Gardens a
lot of º: bears, or bears with eye-glasses and spectacles.
The bear who was a E. on a late occasion. was kindly regaled
with a draught of chloroform, which rendered him insensible to all pain.
So great was the gratitude of the bear to the medical entlemen, that he
would have acknowledged their attentions with an affectionate hug, if
he could have got near enough; and as it was, there streamed from his
eyes a cataract of tears of joy, which pleasingly replaced the cataract
from which he had been suffering.
The Affairs of Grease.
WE, are sorry that the fat cattle did not sell well this year. Their
9verºbesity seems to have been one of the causes of their going of so
heavily—which is no wonder. Fat oxen cannot be expected to be brisk.
Now this truth has been brought home to graziers, perhaps they will
abandon the system of fattening animals so enormously; which is the
merest infatuation.
The Sovereign CoNTEMPT-The KINg of PRussia!
WERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM.
AN eminent Tallow Chandler in the City, being asked what he thought
of the great candle difference between #. St. BARNABAS BENNETT,
and the BISHOP OF LONDON, replied that “he could see very littlé
difference between them—it was six short sixes of the one against
half-a-dozen of the other.”
For EsighT of ouR, ANCEstors—It was extremely kind of our
ancestors to place Smithfield Market so near a Hospitalſ
TRIMMINGS FOR TRACTARLANS;
OR, ROMAN “NOSES". IN BELGRAVIA.
MEssIEURs Noses have found—without very great search–
There’s a slight disagreement, just now, in the Church.
Some parties by daylight wish candles to burn,
Or this way or that way would bow, kneel, or turn:
But others not liking the views of those gents,
The result has been recent unpleasant events.
The discussion of questions like these I decline;
In fact they are quite out of Noses's line
All but one, and ºn that a few words I will Say,
Because public opinion assures me I may.
MESSIEURs Pusey AND Co. lay on one point great stress;
Which is, as of course you’ll anticipate, ress.
Now I’ve mentioned a theme that's contested by none
To be quite in the province of Noses and SQN. .
Where they see demand brisk, prompt supply to iºt,
In Belgravia they’ve opened a splendid branch-mart;
Qf their business still further extending the scope,
MEssIEURs N. AND SON there sell stole, amice, and cope;
Best chasubles, too, may be had very low,
And Tractarians will also find albs, quite the go.
In the first style of fashion prevailing at Rome
Every article's cut—so they’ll feel quite at home.
To their palliums the Noses attention direct;
Their pontificals all are extremely select.
If your Puseyite wants under-clothing that hurts,
He had best go to NoSES AND SON's for hair-shirts,
it...i expressly of super-stiff bristles, -
That will sting you like nettles, and prick worse than thistles.
There’s a large stock of sandals from which he may choose,
At Noses's #. besides boots and shoes,
Which will fit to a T, should the customer please,
Or leave room, if he likes, for a number of peas.
For those, too, whom satire calls clerical Bats,
There’s an ample and various assortment of hats,
From tiara to plain sacerdotal black cap,
Qr friar's flat wideawake, wanting in map; , .
Which, with cloak, hood, cowl, cassock, and girdle to match,
Is, at Noses's prices, a regular catch. -
Aſ these garments, in short, would have just suited LAUD,
And the stock Pio NoNo himself would applaud.
Come, run then, ye reverends of Pimlico, run,
And be rigged out like Romans, by Noses AND Son |

time, generally
present a juvenile
invocation to a
parent, commenc-

touching, and, ac-
cordingly, very
taking words, “Do,
Papa, buy me so
and so.” As the
idea is gettin
stale, when appli

isms, and matters of that infantine class, we suggest that it might be
rendered more telling and novel by something like the following:—
“Do, Papa, buy me. PETERspoRFF's Abridgment: it’s in sixteen
beautiful volumes, so mice, so large, and so cheap-only twenty guineas!”
“A Real Lad of Wax."
If one were called, upon to give the best instance of undaunted
courage, we would point to the bronze medallion, which has just been
ut up on the Trafalgar Column, and which illustrates the fact of
Nº. calling for a candle and a piece of wax for his letter, refusing, for
fear the enemy should think he was in the least hurried by their guns,
to seal it with a wafer. We maintain that the above fact is the strongest
proof on record of unwafering courage. (Bravo! Three cheers, boys,

SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE AND THE EXHIBITION OF 1851.
WE understand that South Staffordshire will be aspertinently repre-
sented in the Crystal Palace as in the House of Commons; where
LoRD LEwish AM supplies the senatorial porcelain clay, to the advan-
tage alike of the county and the country. His Lordship attended a
late Protection feast at Sutton Coldfield; and greatly daring, dimed”
in honour of a hopeful return to º prices. His Lordship, moreover,
made a speech; flinging a few pearls and diamonds at, what he happil
called, the Great Exhibition of Reciprocity in Hyde Park, in whic
“industry was to be forced like early asparagus;” and his Lordship
might have added, like, much after-dinner eloquence, "under a glass.”
Further, his fordship, “putting FreeTradealtogether on oneside, reall
did hope that the º would take * MR, Mazzºni, an
others of that stamp who belonged to the Republican Club in
London, did not give the nation a specimen of their industry also, on
the occasion.”
The wisdom and fºg. taste, ºf this allusion were not lost upon the
commercial men of Staffordshire; for next ing a deputation
masters from the Potteries waited upon his Lordship, earnestly praying
of him that he would condescend to sit for a Mug—a Monster Mug-
to be formed out of his exaggerated portrait, of the very best sº.
shire clay, as a triumphant specimen of the county manufacture,
this vessel—tº be known as the Lewisham º so constructed,
in order to illustrate the peculiar faculty of his Lordship as a senator
and an orator, that, whatever may be poured into it shall always rise
above the top; so that, whilst the mug shall really contain nothin
#. it shalſhever fail to display to the world—an enormous head of
TOUll.
“HERE THEY ARE ALL A-GROWING,”
THE Proprietor of the Baker-Street Bazaar (which, by the bye, is
rather a Bazaar of Butchers t fakers) has been solicited by the
Smithfield Cattle Show Committee to enlarge his premises. This is
evidently done with the wise provision—or rather the foresight of
future provisions—that, if the animals keep growing in the same ex-
traordinary proportions they have hitherto done, not only must the
doors be enlarged to receive them, but the whole Bazaar considerably
widened to contain even, one-twentieth part of them. The pigs, alone,
are swelling out to such tremendous dimensions, that they will soon
outgrow all recollection of their primitive size. It would not be a bad
lan, we think, tº hang one of MoRLAND’s pictures up in the Pig
º: in order to give the spectators some idea of what the size
of the pig originally was. The same plan might be carried out with the
other animals. LANDSEER, or SYDNEY CoopFR, should be commissioned
to paint portraits of the Sheep and the Bull and the Cow in days of
yore, so as to give the nºn-mangel-wurzel public some estimate of what
those animals respectively were in weight before they had become “per-
manently enlarged,” in the hands of the fattener and the cake-seller.
Some scale of measurement will be absolutely necessary, or else our
children will be imagining that the cows and bulls in the bucolic days
of VIRGIL were of the same Brobdignagian proportions as those, half-
a-dozen of whom at present cause an overflow, (which every manager of
a theatre must envy,) at the Baker Street Bazaar.
England's Peace-offering.
THE Crystal Palace, may be looked upon as a noble Temple of Peace
where all nations will meet by appointment under the same roof, an
shake each other by the hand. It is very curious that one half of Mr.
Paxton's name should be significant of Peace. We propose, therefore,
that over the principal entrance there be erected in large gold letters
the following mottº, so that all foreigners may read it as a friendly
salute on the part of England:-
“PAx(ros) Woºlscum.”
The Battle of Hastings.
WE all know that Hastings is very near a little place called Battle;
and, from the belligerent manner in which SIR. Thomas Hastings has
been writing to MR. Cobden, we should think the noble Admiral was
anxious to put himself up as a finger-post on the high road to Battle.
We recommend, to artists, as a companion picture to their oft-painted
“Finding the Body % Harold,” the following pendant—“ A. the
Head ºf Hastings.”. They have only to read through his correspondence
first, and they will at once see, in all its gloominess, the inviting
grandeur of the subject.
DESCRIPTION OF Pusey Is M.
A LADY, being asked for a description of Puseyism, said, “it ap-
peared to her like an Acting Charade—the meaning of which it was
very difficult to find out.” Like all puzzling Charades, then, which it is
impossible to guess, the sooner Puseyism is given up the better.
OUR MODEL OF SMITHFIELD MARKET,
E have not seen the model that was exhi-
bited by the City Corporation of their
Smithfield Market; but we can imagine
exactly what it was, if it was in the least
true to mature.
We can imagine it contained twice as
many sheep and oxen as there was any
convenient space for.
We can imagine that the drovers were
subjecting the poor animals to all kinds of
cruelties, in order to force the above
number into the small space allotted for
em
We can imagine the place to be knee-
deep in filth; and the market to be one
immensescene of rioting, confusion, swear-
ing, and quarrelling.
e can imagine all the numerous public-
houses round it to be choke-full, and that
the drinking does not much contribute to
the gentleness of the drovers' tempers, or
considerably lessen the tumult of the
scene.
We can imagine sheep to be lying down
on the ground in the last stage of ex-
haustion, and infuriated oxen to be plung-
down the streets in all directions.
e can also very easily imagine a man
or two being gored to death, and several
- old women being tossed in the air in con-
sequence; but no, it requires no imagination to believe the latter facts,
§ !.* of the last week prove but too painfully that they are
ruths.
All the above incidents should have been represented in the Model
of Smithfield Market, if it was in anyway a faithful copy of the Market,
as it at present exists, or must, under any improvements, exist, as long
as the nuisance is allowed to continue in the heart of a Metropolis,
which, at present, numbers a population of near upon two million
people. - -
A YORKSHIRE JURY.
A RUFFIAN, named JoHN Robinson, was tried last week at York.
The fellow had made one of a wedding-party; and growned his festive
mirth by perpetrating the worst offence * the weaker sex, of
which tiebrute and the coward can be capable. The dastard was found
ilty: there was no doubt, whatever, of the extent of injury suffered
§§ hapless victim; an innocent young woman,—one of the brides-
maids. º a Yorkshire Jury, after five hours' deliberation, return a
verdict of guilty; tempered with “a strong recommendation to mercy
on the grounds that he was not quite sober at the time, and excited by
the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed.”
Thus, with a Yorkshire Jury, drunkenness palliates the atrocity of
felon lust; and the mirth of a º affords peculiar circum-
stances of extenuation to the cowardly villainy of a TARQUIN Robinson!
The women of York ought, by, some significant testimonial, to comme-
morate the manly wisdom of their Civic J ". Weº they were
allbachelors, without any female relations. Indeed, after such a verdict,
it is made rather difficult to believe that twelve such apologists in a box
ever had mothers.
Specimen of a Bit of London Fog.
THE specimen of a slab of fog, toothick, until broken, to pass through
Temple Bar, has been brought to Mr. Punch, who—in the proportion of
one-twentieth of an inch to a foot-here gives its
in and texture. It has a very fine sulphurous
avour, and is º the best specimen of the
real London article. Mr. Punch th that London
fog might become a very profitable article of com-
merce, inasmuch as there can be little doubt that,
when cut, it is susceptible of a very high polish, and
as mourning-rings or shirt-studs.
PROCRASTINATION IN REWARDs Is THE THIER OF MERIT.
Governmºst is, generally speaking, very dilatory in its system of
rewards, such as ºil. and marks of merit and promotion, to poor
military heroes, but we never heard yet of an instance of a mark of
well-earned merit—a pension, for instance-being delayed in its pº-
º to ºvernment unctionary some twenty or thirty years after
retirement.

PUNCHS Hot DAYS
HOW TO ENJOY A HOLIDAY.
S. you close the door of your house, leave all thoughts of business behind you.
Never mind about that bill—that appointment—or that #.º. }.

left open—or that * the cellaret—but surrender yourself unconditionally to
the thought of the day's enjoyment, before you. at peace, with all men,
and with all things, but more especially with yourself. It is indispensable that
you shºuld be in the highest goºd-humour, with a soul above trifles, excepting
to laugh at them. Hold out a hand to the world, and shake it with the
heartiness of a friend you, have not seen for many a week. Then take its
arm, and saunter forth, with your heart upon your face, determined to enjoy
yourself. Lºok at Nature, through a smile. 1. a rainbow encircle all your
thoughts. Begin the day by giving something to a beggar. . Do not imagine
he is an impostor, but thoroughly believe he is in want of it, and, if your
charity has * no further than a penny, you cannot fancy how much better
ſou will feel fºr it. For that day—for the smiling space of four-and-twenty
ours-let no black thºughts flit across the pure heaven of your mind. If a
dog runs between your legs, if a chimney-sweep blackens or a baker whitens
you, if yºur straps break, or your gloves burst, or your boots gape, or your
ºnly creditor sits opposite to you in the omnibus “all the way to Mile end.”
let no hard monosyllable drop from your mouth, as if you learnt your
manners in Cursitor Street. You must be liberal, for meanness and enjoyment
are two things that never yet ran together. So give the reins to your #.
keeping a curb oyer it all the while, for unbridled expense will throw you, if you
have not a care, beforef." have travelled through half the day. Prudence, also,
must be your guide, for it will never do to walk six miles at night because
you have not reserved sufficient to pay for your
omnibus home. You should, likewise, keep a
watchful eye upon the time, for the hours run
round with two pair of hands when you are en-
joying * and you may have to sleep in a
damp bed in an unsavoury village inn because
ou did not start five minutes earlier to catch
he last train. Be determined to enjoy yourself,
and that being the first half of the enjoyment
gained, it is wonderful how quickly the other half
will follow iti
A JOURNEY UP THE MONUMENT.
If the reputation of London were built upon
pillars, the W. on Fish Street Hill is one
of the three that the Capital might be said to rest
upon. The holiday seeker in the Metropolis can-
not be said to have reached the summit of satis-
faction until he has, arrived at the top of this
Column, from which he may look down upon his
fellow men, and be astonished at the littleness of
the world below him. A journey to the top of
the Monument may be regarded as a cheap sub-
stitute for the Ascent of Mont Blanc, or an
economical enjoyment of a strange climb, when
more distant climes are inaccessible. Its circular
staircase converts, the expedition to the top into
one uninterrupted round of such satisfaction as
the place . and those who can enjºy a tour,
#}} convert themselves into determined tourists
if they persevere until they reach the summit.
We are, however, getting on too rapidly, and
the car of Fancy is pulled up rather abruptly
by the demand of a toll of sixpence from the
janitor who ds the entrance. This individual passes his life in one long game of prisoner's base, for he is confined, as it were, a sort of
prisoner to the base of the column. At the hour of our visit we disturbed him in the middle of his frugal meal, to which art had contributed
a mutton pie, and nature had given a salad. Civilisation spoke in the plate that held his repast, for commercial intercourse was emblemed in
the pepper; the softness of Italian luxury was represented in the spoonful of oil; and the knife and fork seemed in their clatter to talk of
the anvils and forges, the bellows and blowpipes of busy blustering Birmingham.
But ſet us pause a moment before “we go up, up, up,” and inquire into the origin of this wondrous piece of masonry. The column, was
erected in a fluted form, in memory of the Fire of fondon, the flute being suggestive of the fact that, on this spot the fire, ought to have
been promptly played upon. The order having been given, the workmen took the necessary steps—345 in number—and the pile having been

iled up—a flaring urn was placed at the top, as a type of the accident:
#. how an urn can .# fire we know not, unless it should be a
tea-urn filled with Thames water, and the heat, of the heater should
have set the Thames on fire. The city was partially restored by money
raised from a tax on coal, for it was equitably determined by the au:
thorities of those days, that as fire had done the mischief, coal should
stand the damage. It is a curious fact that London should have been
raised from its ashes by the aid of coal, which was made to come down
with the dust for the rebuilding of the city. -
Before going to the top of the Monument, let us examine the basso
relievo at É. bottom. The old lady sitting like a veteran CINDERELLA
on a heap of cinders, is supposed tº be London, while behind her is Fame
acting as a sort of policeman, by lifting her up and telling her to move
on, while CHARLEs. THE SEcond steps forward to assist, like one of the
old fondon Charlies. Near him is a Lady with a hat in her hand
marked Liberty, and leading to the inference that unless she has picke
up somebody else's hat in the row, it is Liberty herself that stands
forward... In the background is Fortitude #. a tame Lion, as if
to show the fortitude with which the Lions of London met their fate at
the fire. , Some historians, who wrote better than they spelt, have
regretted the Lion was not in readiness to turn on his e when the
conflagration first happened.
e now commence the ascent of the column—a
task which those only who have been adherents of the
common-wheel, or contributed a paragraph to the history
of Brixton and the Brixtonians, can possibly appreciate.
But this simile is not complete, unless we blend with
it the beautiful allegory of the blind horse, mathema.

the labourers of the brick-field. Willingly would we
haye relinquished our task when we had gone way,
but another party were º up behind, and there
was no loophole, except the *#. in the wall,
that we could have got out of. ving reached the
summit and proceeded to, the outer gallery, we hired Nº.
the telescope, which is let by a local optician at a penny

make smoke and obscurity visible. sº
Father Thames was in his bed, with his usual cur. Fº

altogether was so studded over with chimney-pots, that
the only artist we were reminded of was PAUL Potter.
Here and there, we discerned a family’s weekly wash Hº
!ging out to dry and to blacken on the house-top; Elº
while in one or two instances we saw infancy making &
a playground of some very limited leads; and on the -
top of a house in a narrow street we witnessed a game
at cricket ºf played, with a stack of three chimneys
for a wicket, the runs being taken along a gutter.
: Having feasted our eyes with a ramble over a million tiles, and our
vision * made a steeple chase after a hundred steeples, we com-
menced the descent of the Monument, and discovered #. WIRGIL's
talk about facilis descensus is a mistake; for it is quite as difficult and
uncomfortable to come down in the world as to go up in it.
WIND SO R.
WHEN you go to Windsor—un-
less the State Apartments are
shut §. care to get a
Lord Chamberlain's ticket of
admission to view them; which
is to be had, in London, of
MessRs. CoINAGH1, or AcKER-
MANN, MR. Moon, or MR.
MITCHELL. These tlemen
}\º possess a peculiar faculty of
º º Hºnº, by physiognomy,
º who are respectable enough to
be let in, and who are not.
It is HER MAJESTY's com-
mand that no payment for or
in reference to these tickets
--- - be made to anybody whatever
- - º - and every dutiful subject will
º this behest of his sº with singular pleasure. -
ou had better get to Windsor as quick as you can; namely
by an early Great Western or South Western train; for "officia
arrangements at the Castle will make you particularly sensible of the
value of time. , -
From Henry the Eighth's Gateway, rush at once to the State Apart-
ments. Don't stop to make reflections on the time-honoured residence,
&c., suggested by the majestic structures that tower around you, or you
may be too late. A red Porter, but evidently a gentleman of publican,
not republican leani gives you ingress to the abode of Royālty. ...You
run upstairs in breathless haste, and then probably have, to wait ten
minutes in a lobby. An attendant is taking the last batch of visitors
round the rooms, which you will have the pleasure of circumambulating
in your turn, in about the same space of time. During the short hours
of our English summer's daylight, this Royal Exhibition opens at 11,
and closes at 4; hence, to accommodate as many parties as possible, the
necessity of revolution succeeding revolution as fast as possible, around
the very Throne. -
In running the circuit of the State Apartments, you will see the
rtraits §§n. I, the DUKE, OF WELLINGTON, BLUCHER, LQRD
AstLEREAGH, and various other kings, warriors, and statesmen; but
stand not to muse on the lineaments of any one of them, or the deuce a
glimpse will you get of any of the others. In the State Ante-Room,
tour attention Wi. be arrested by a comical transparency of GEORGE III.,
xed in a recess over the chimney-piece, and apparently representing
His Majesty up the flue—a strange place for any Sovereign but one
who, like soot, had derived his origin from CoAL. You wonder at
the splendid decorations of St. George's Hall, and also at your cicerone
showing you a little lumber-room f
of the carpets belonging to it. It

may be interesting to inquire whether he means to intimate that the
Knights of the Garter are carpet-knights.
The Guard Chamber contains some historical relics, the holiest of
which is a part of the foremast of the Victory, with a hole right through
the middle of it, and the cannon shot that made the hole at its foot.
Having scampered through the apartments of State, you bound like a
kangaroo to the Round Tower, which, if you are before 4, you are at
liberty to ascend; otherwise not. Hence, standing beneath the Royal
Flagstaff, you may survey twelve counties, and, if you choose, fancy
yourself monarch of all you survey, and how, if you were so, you would
order . Lord Chamberlain to be considerably more accommodating
towards your subjects.
Descending, you now bend your steps in what direction you please,
leaving the sentries to tell you that you must not go there, as one of
them will do at almost every corner: when, if you are in a good
humour, you pull your hat off, and make the son of §: a polite [.
If he shouts to bid you get off the grass, and you have a mind to walk
on it, your best * is to step leisurely up to him, and ask him in what
part of the Castle you will find the MARquis of Westminster.
Frºm the North Terrace you may enjoy an extensive view, including
the distant spires and antique towers alluded to by the poet GRAY,
whilst beneath you are the Slopes, rendered so celebrated by the Court
Circular. This É. you may have on any day of the week, but
you can see the Castle Gardens only on Saturdays and Sundays. The
chief reason why you cannot be admitted on any other day is generally
believed to be, simply, because that day is Monday, Tuesday, Wed.
mesday, Thursday, or Ériday.
... If yºu find that fine mediaeval edifice, St. George's Chapel, open, step
in, and gaze your fill on the groinings, carvings, decorations, banners
'scutcheons. You will observe one fine painted window; and several
that will remind you of the transparencies of taters all-hot-venders.
Among these “storied windows” you will look in vain for the story
of St. GEORGE: one of the greatest that was ever told.
Leaving the Častle you might, some years i. have had a pleasant
walk through the Home Park; but what was the level pathway is now

sunk into a sort of a ditch with a fence on either bank. In those days
you might have gone and culled a daisy beneath the remainder of the
tree said to be HERNE’s Oak; but now you are prevented from per-
forming that act of devotion by the ditch and the fence above mentioned.
These inconveniences will shortly be remedied by the establishment of
a new path, which will take the pilgrim out of the sight of HERNE’s
Oak altogether: -
On Snow Hill, at the top of the Long, Walk in the Great Park—
where you might expect to find a Saracen's Head—you find, instead, a
colossal statue of a monarch, whose costume would lead you to take him
for AUGUSTUs Qāsar, but whom, from an inscription on the pedestal,
you find to be GEORGE THE THIRD.
A strong attractive power here draws you towards Virginia Water.
A stronger pulls you in the direction of Stoke Pogis, where rest the
remains of the, Poet GRAY, in a churchyard consecrated by himself.
A stronger still takes you back to Windsor to dinner, which, with a
knife and fork (out) you will find ready for you at the White Hart.
When you have leisure to yield your mind up to the influence of
Windsor Castle, you feel that it is a grand building. In this centre of
the monarchy the very air seems to resound with “God Save the xx.
and “Rºle Britannia.”. Imagination peoples the battlements of the
Round, Tower, with beef-eaters playing the trumpet. No doubt this
assºciation with Wombwell's menagerie is owing to the idea that the
edifice we are gazing on is the den of the original British Lion.
GREENWICH PARK, GREENWICH FAIR, AND GREENWICH HOSPITAL.
To write an Act of Parliament, in the round of a silver penny, even
when the penny is obtained, is easily to write in a large engrossing hand,
and then ſeave room enough for a rider; this, we say—or would say—is
a facile stroke of art, compared with the task to which we have volun:
tarily, devoted ourselves, a task that shall satisfactorily set forth all
the glories, historical, social, dramatic, and vagrant of Greenwich.
GREENwich PARK has, perhaps, the finest avenues of chesnut trees
in the country. And for this reason. They are the growth of the very
choicest chesnuts found in the cupboard of the Admiral's ship, when the
winds blew and dispersed the Spanish Armada. These chesnuts were
lanted by QUEEN ELIZABETH, in state; and such was the length and
elicity of i. reign, that she survived to eat of chesnuts from these very
trees. HER MAJESTY, QUEEN VICTORIA, in memory, and out of com.
§. to her sister Bess, has chesnuts roasted from these trees every
hristmas; an interesting historical, fact, that cannot be too widely
#. though strangely omitted by the chronicler of the Court
rcular.
After the chesnuts, the most interesting objects—especially on holi-
day occasions—are the Greenwich Pensioners that dot, and stud, and
stump the Park. A favoured few are allowed to make the most of
their telescopes, and will show to the curious their individual windows
Twith the cat looking out, if there—from, Blackfriars to Limehouse:
These gallant men sustained a great loss by the reckless and unprinciple
removal of the culprits gibbetted at Blackwall; always objects of undy-
ing interest to an enlightened public. We fearlessly repeat," reckless
and unprincipled;” because, although the bodies were removed, and the
gibbet taken down, there, was no compensation made—no, not a
farthing's worth—to the gallant men who had invested their hard-earned
gains, won in the battle and the breeze, to purchase the necessary
telescopes. However, we hurry from the oppressive consideration of
liamentary injustice, to discuss a more picturesque, a tenderer theme.
É. we then at once to the wooden legs of the Pensioners.
It would be impossible to show to an incredulous, world a more
triumphant evidence of the vitality of the British Oak than the wooden
legs . Britain's Greenwich, Pensioners, since every such leg is a growth
of the national tree; an enduring piece of timber, ever-living, as with its
first sap; a fact, incontestably proved by the circumstance that, from
the first foundation of the Hospital to the present hour, there has been
the same number of wooden legs—not one less, or one more; not one
inch less, or one shaving longer. Hence, to a philosophic and con-
templative mind, the wooden legs of Old England's Pensioners,
are pegs whereon to hang the most pleasurable and most profitable
emotions. - - - - - - -
In Greenwich Park, too, the philanthropist, having paid his tribute of
devotion to the relics of the brave, may throw himself upon the deer
in this place so tame and gentle, that it is plain they have never hear
of the London Tavern, and currant-jelly, is a thing unknown to them;
d|Their coats are, it will be observed, of the most singular sleekness, said
by MR. JEsse to have originated in the reign of QUEEN ANNE, when
the animals were fed upon the cast-off silk petticoats of the Maids of

Honour. We must, however, venture to think that the legend wants
authenticity. No offence to Mr. Jesse.
We should not have done with the Park, were we not unwillingly
held within its precincts by a sense of sterner duty, bound to consider
an abuse too long connected with the locality—we mean the holiday
ractice of (we think it is so called) Kiss-in-the-Ring. We trust that
ord AshLEY will, if necessary, move an address to HER, MAJEsty
upon this c ublic disorder, putting it down with the strong
timber of the Constable's staff. ight we take the liberty to advise
his Lordship, we would suggest that he should move for a Return of
the Kisses given since the Accession of the QUEEN.
GREENwich FAIR, held twice a year, is now mainly noticeable as
the hotbed of the rising drama—a drama that, it may be expected, will
in a few years, perhaps months, perhaps weeks—altogether supersede
the “slow” performances put forth under the false pretences of SHAK-
sPEARE, SHERIDAN, and “all that.” Here the condensing genius of a
NElson LEE extracts, from the raw material of a murder and a ghost,
a complete tragedy in five minutes. Here the whole purpose of comedy
is given in four verses of a funny song; and two “screeching...farces
º in the vermilion crescents of the clown's cheeks... We are
appy to say that British managers and British actors, ever alive to the
spirit of their day, have been frequent and earnest students of the
Elson school, that, so like NELson, takes everything from the French,
and re-christening the
them as of the British Navy.
In other respects a too conscientious sense of duty will not permit us
to eulogise the revels. Perhaps we are getting old; but the sausages
seem smaller than they were; and the gingerbread is, certainly, more of
the bread than the ginger. To be sure, as we advance in life, we see
too far through the gilding;, and, at two-score, the chanticleer-in;
pantaloons is not the same gold bird as when it found us at sixes and
Sevens.
GREENwich Hospital, is to be seen from the river for nothing; and
—save on Mondays and Fridays—the Painted Hall and Cha
pence. . (Wherefore, in such case, should not all the week Mondays
and Fridays?) In the Hall are many pictures, much too numerous to
dwell upon. We must, however, name a few. Wetherefore begin with
T. P. Cooke: he is, it will be observed, performinghis admiredhornpipe,
and is in the middle of that happy passage denominated, “the double
shuffle;" epigrammatically illustrative of the treatment of LADY HAMIL-
Ton—NELson’s LADY HAMILTON.—by a grateful Government.
In the Hall are the Coat and Waistcoat worn by NEI son when he
“received his death-wound on the quarter-deck of the Wictory, 21st Oct.,
1805.” Hush! And now Nelson is in the cockpit, and almost his
last words are—“Remember, I leave my daughter HoRATIA as a legacy
to W. country. Never forget HoRATIA.”
ell, we look at the Coat and Waistcoat, and—ashamed at the
º of a nation that, treasuring the old clothes of a hero, leave
the hero's flesh and blºod to H. and neglect—we go no further.
Nevertheless, the reader, if he have the stomach—may.

I have some very
magnificent pic-

which is almost too hot to look at in this weather, a SEBASTIAN BEL
Piombo which I esteem to be one of the very greatest pictures in the
whole world; a VELAsquez, most sumptuous, and which I can’t help
thinking beautiful, whatever MR. ConinghAM and MR. Moore may say,
and although it has been flayed alive by MR. EASTLARE.; a RuBENs
landscape; and some charming Hoganths, which, though they are hung
in a not very satisfactory gallery, are yet worth looking at where they
lang. I have an exceedingly fine library in Bloomsbury, under the care
of a most respectable gentleman, by the name of PANIzzi, who has been
for some time preparing a catalogue for me, and who, with a score of the
kindest and most civil attendants in the world, will get me any book I
want, and spare me the trouble of putting it back in its place, as I, must
do with my little wretched set of books. I have in the same building,
in Russell Square, a collection of Greek and Ionian marbles which give
me the greatest delight and pleasure; some wonderful Nineveh
sculptures with arrowheaded inscriptions, which I shall be very glad
to show my friends; some Egyptian antiquities and mummies; and
stuffed birds, and fossils, and mouldy old camelopards and rhinoceroses
stuffed with straw, which anybody may admire who likes, as I confess I
don't. I have this vastand magnificent collection of books, manuscripts
rints, medals, marbles, and mouldy camelopards, with a cºuple o
Fººd entlemen to take care of them and me, and not as to
pay; and I own that for all these benefits I am exceedingly gra to
a grateful country.
Out of town I have some as delightful parks and gardens as ever
were seen, and where I shall be most º to welcome the reader. At
Kew I’ll show him such a marvellous collection of the flowers of the
field and the trees of the forest, as Solomon in all his glory certainly
never could have mustered, much less equalled, I will sit with him
under a ºf palm-tree as if he were an Arab Sheik, or under a
banyan tree as if he were a Bramin; and in ring the marvellous
varieties and beauties of the creations of Providence all bountiful, I
think we can feel as much exquisite delight and interest, as much
reverence, and awful and tender gratitude and wonder for the wondrous
maker of all these beautiful things, as much charity and love for our
brethren round about, with whom we share these kindly emotions in
common, as we could get by hearing the very best sermon that ever was
º by the very best Bishop out of Oxford, or any other University
or Nee.
Again, after church on a Sunday, a favourite walk of mine is in a
park I have at Richmond in Surrey, near the Star and Garter Hotel-
where of late I keep to the º walks chiefly, having given up the
main three thousand acres of cover, green, gorse, &c., to the
who keeps his pheasants there. He may be a 'most charitable and
good-natured and hospitable gentleman; but, then there are, so
º other people besides pheasants, who would like to have their
pleasure.
My favourite house and garden of all, however, is one which I possess
upon the banks of the Thames, about twelve miles from town, very
nearly º the Swan at Ditton. I run down thither on a Sunday
by the oad—I did so last Sunday after church: I walk about in my
gardens; I look at my fountains; I ramble under my magnificent
avenues of chesnuts, or take a basket of cold º there with my wife
and children. I feed the gold fish in my basins; I look at the swans
floating on the river ºf: my wall; or I go with my pretty º
friend, Miss Smith, into the queerest little shrubbery, or maze whic
my gardeners have constructed there, and in which we always lose our-
selves, and seem as if we never should come out again, which makes my
poor dear wife absurdly jealous and impatient.

This place has some rather fine old buildings upon it; and indeed seems to me
far pleasanter and handsomer than Versailles, or Sans Souci, or the Escurial, or
the Summer Palace at , Czarkoe-Zeloe; or, the EMPERQR, or CHINA’s palace at
uang-Chingchoo; or indeed than any, royal residence that, I have seen, except,
of course, "HER MAJEsty's at, Windsor. There is a cheerfulness about my
old house and grounds which I don't knºw elsewhere. Lºrd! how wondrous was
the variety of the green! how rich, the chesnut avenues!, how magnificent therho-
dodendrops looked last Sunday! And Miss SMITH, who joined, our º in her grey
dress and white shawl and bonnet, how pretty she looked. Didn't she?' My wife of
course says No. -
This place has been in my family some time, though we’ve been kept out of it by

HOW TO SPEND A HOLIDAY SHILLING.
WHEN you are about to take a holiday excursion on a
small sum, it is desirable to make a shilling go as far as
it will, because the owner will, of course, go as far as
the shilling. Some persons think they are fiely to go
a great way for their money, if they take the halfpenny
boat; but this is not always judicious, for in the event
of an explosion—which may sometimes happen—the
passenger by the halfpenny boat may go further than he
wished, or bargained for. The mereloyer ºf locomotion
for locomotion's sake may get a liberal º worth
in the shape of a sea º to Ipswich, where pas-
sengers are conveyed at about twelve-pence perhead,
but, in estimating the amount per head, the speculators
seem to think they are not bound to provide accommo-
dation for the arms, legs, and rest of the bºdy. ---
Perhaps, under all circumstances, a holiday shilling
may be better spent in the Metropolis itself, than in
any attempt to, excursionise.
#. instance, begin a cheap breakfast at a coffee-stall
in Piccadilly, where the holiday maker, may see life
and character, and eat thick bread-and-butter with a
cup of coffee, for 2443 and may meet with an applogy
for the earlybird in the shape of a street-lark, which is
constantly kept up hy those who have sung and sworn
that the º not “go home till morning;” and who
arc º the conditions to which they have pledged
themselves.

Holborn, who is worn as a necklage by the proprietor
of the show, and who darts his head among the audience
to “clear out” when the visitors appear dissatisfied.
Take your dinner—the well known “regular good One
for 2%d.”—at CANN's in Holborn, and visit “at half-
price” all the small peep-shows that come in your way,
selecting a private box in a bye-street, wherever you
can, unti tº: remainder of your holiday shilling is
expended.

6. PUNCH'S HOLIDAYS.
A HALF-HOLIDAY AT HAMPSTEAD.
R AMPSTEAD Hill is only less steep than
a ladder, so, unless you are expert in
climbing up perpendicular heights, you
had better find out some secret path
through the fields that leads you to
the Heath with very little more trouble
than walking over a carpet. The dis-
tance may be a little longer," but then
you fin soft grass for your feet, instead
of the pointed pebbles of the public
path, which, for i. with thin shoes,
or gentlemen with tight boots, is like
ºft. on penknives with all the
blades, open; and, moreover, you win
beautif hedges and new-mown hay,
- - and the quiet of the country, in ex:
change for the hot brick-walls, and the dust, and the smoke, and noise of
the high road it is true the fields are not what § used to be. Where
a field formerly had four hedges, it has now probably only two, and the
other two are replaced by low houses that squat ºn the ground, like
gipsies, only they are not half so, picturesque. Like gipsies, too, they
seem to wither and eat, up everything around them. In this manner
whole fields have been nibbled away, and, if the appetite for building at
all continues, we may expect shortly that there will not be a blade of
grass visible anywhere, excepting in a blackbird's cage, between Prim-
rose Hill and Jack Straw's Castle. Paris has been Called France, but
London promises to be literally #. and if it keeps growing as it
has done of late years, we doubt if England will be large enough to hold it,
Scotland will be obliged to be taken in as a Metropolitan suburb, whilst
Wales will, doubtlessly, be resorted to as the fashionable Westºn.
We only hope that łiº Heath will be saved from this Goth-
like invasion of bricks. Our public lº. have been sadly cut to pieces
recently—so much so, that many of them are but small remnants now to
what they once were—and we do hope, if we are to have “a bit of
een” within a day's view of London, that Hampstead Heath will be
the favoured spot spared to us.
London not so many play-grounds that it can afford to lose one of
the best of them, Besides, the great advantage of a play-ground is its
being attached close to the School of which it forms a part, and, if we
miserable Cockneys, who are shut up in town generally six days a week, are
given half a holiday, it is highly essential that we should not have to run
all the way to Stonehenge, beforewe can find an º spot where to enjoyit.
Moreover, cºuld Stonehenge give you,such a view of London as
Hampstead? You would not have the Metropolis lying almost at the
toe of your boot, all but asking you to play at foot-ball with it. How
quiet i. monster seems under its black veil of smoke, as if it were too
modest to show its face . It looks like some great Titan of a coalheaver,
that was lying, on his back, reposing, after the fatigues of the day,
with the coal-dust still flying about him, and the dome of St. Paul's as
his fantail pulled over his brow to keep the sun out of his eyes.
It is curious that º Heath has but few telescopes. Is it
because there are no wooden legs to show them? no red-coated pen-
sioners, with noses to match, to point out the bumps of that great
swollen, monstrous head of Tomdom? There are no ginger-beer or
lemonade merchants either, though this is a relief. In exchange there
is a most #. flag-staff, which may be seen, we are told, from, a
whole mapfull of counties, and wooden seats, on which old men delight
to sit of an evening, and point out with their crutches the different
objects in the distance. ere are plenty of horses, and ponies, and
donkeys, also, and the feats of horsemanship and º which
you witness in consequence, would astonish BATTY's Circus, and elicit
many learned remarks and playful cracks of the whip from Wropicoma.
The whole Heath is one “gay, tournament.” At one moment, you
admire the prowess of a fat lady, who gallops on unmindful of the
parasol she has left behind her; and the next you are interested in a
race of some six ladies, who are calling out “Stop!” in vain, to some
six young gentlemen in summer trowsers who are running after them
with big sticks in their, hands. Suddenly, you rush forward. One of
the young ladies has fallen, off. By the time you have arrived, she is
on her legs and on the donkey's back again, and has rejoined her com-
panions, laughing like a school-girl, for it is ve ‘...."; the only
occasion when a young lady does not faint is when she falls off a donkey.
But, the prettiest sight of all is a long cavalcade of donkeys which
suddenly turns, the dark corner of the Hendon Lane, and unwinds
slowly into the high road. It is some twenty little girls, from six to
ten, all on donkeys. Their voices jingle with the bells, and they are all
as merry as possible. You stand still and they break into little laugh-
ing streams on each side of you, and disappear, like a small cataract,

Jack Straw's Castle—a straw which is embalmed in the amber of
WASHINGTON IRVING's pages, besides being preserved in that t
granary of fashionable heroes, The Newgate Calendar. Dine, there,
unless you have the patience to explore some of the m ſºi
lanes about the Heath, which, if hedges had ears as well as walls, coul
tell many a tale of loyers' vows made and broken, and, let us ń. a
few of them kept. You must not expect whitebait, or game, or ohn
Dorys, or truffles, at these quiet humble inns, but you will have a
country dinner, as solid and as plain as the country girl who waits upon
you, but which, with the appetite you have picked up, with the joy of a
new shilling, on the road, you will enjoyfully as much as º of the above
delicacies. But beware of the ale—for it is strong—and its strength
may be partly owing to the scarcity of water about Hampstead—but
beware of it, for it is as strong as a house-dog, and must not be allowed
to run about too freely. Leave early, f your cigar, and stroll down the
hill before it is dusk. You cannot tell what a beautiful perfume a real
Havannah and new-mown hay make combined together! The perfumer
who could compound the two has his fortune ready made in a “two-
shilling bottle.”
We have spoken of the “country” throughout in the above descrip-
tion, for though only two miles from town, it is to our dusty notions as
fresh as the country, and much more welcome than the country can
to a person who sees it every day of his rural life. But we maintain
that it is the “country,” and this in no cockney point of view, but
in a real view of beautiful English scenery, and we feel grateful to the
founder of London, whoever the great Čupprt of that day was, for
having placed this metropolis so near it. We hope the Heath may io
be spared the desecration of bricks, so that we may enjoy many an
many a pleasant HALF-Holl DAY AT HAMPSTEAD.

an omnibus. The bold artisan who is “game” to take his folks for
#, holiday, may gallantly make a descent on Richmond in the van.
Then there is the Railway, and also the River, and whilst there is a
balance, of foliage at the banks of the Thames, the humble traveller
will find the silent highway preferable to either of the noisy ones. On
landing, from the steamer at the foot of the bridge, you are generally
received, with several punches in the stomach, by cards being thrust
at you by touters from adjacent eating-houses. This displeases a
gentleman who means to dine at an hotel, and considers that fact
obvious from his personal appearance.
Bearing in mind, the observation of the Hibernian tourist, that the
F. thing tº be seen in Richmond is the scenery around it, you
immediately make for Richmond Hill, up which a light tug, § a
- waste of steam, if it is hot, is waiting to convey you. Nothin
intercepts your passage, but hands that offer late strawberries, and,
perhaps, a suspicious ſooking gentleman in shabby black, who tenders
agreeably on the roof of.
you a tract, which you decline, having a much more edifying tract
(of country) awaiting your perusal. -
The eye from the brow of Richmond Hill contemplates an expanse of
such magnificence, that perhaps there exists nowhere a more splendid
spread, or, so to speak, *: for the vision, and it is very doubtful
whether M. Soºn himself could provide” a feast, to correspond.
Through the valley below there is the Thames, winding like a silver
eel, serene, as if fearless of being spitchcocked. º far away,
stretches an ocean of foliage bounded with cloud-like hills, and inter.
spersed with serious shadows and laughing villas; the whole prospect
suggesting an idea of immense wealth that must necessarily pay an
income-tax... In the extreme distance, on a fine day, are ...' the
towers of Windsor Castle, and in the immediate foreground, under the
same conditions, individuals of fair sex and fashionable exterior
promenade to and fro continually. - -
The traveller now follows his nose, which takes him to the left in the
direction of the Star and Garter, whence a delicious culinary aroma is
continually exhaling. Happy, if circumstances allow him to take the
hint, and step in and order dinner at this hostelry, renowned for its fine
cookery, fine wines, and fair prices, and for haying been recently the
residence of Louis PHILIPPE, who doubtless found it a much more
comfortable place than the Tuileries.
But a perfume more fragrant than that of turtle, on the other side of
the way—the balmy breeze—attracts us to Richmond Park, which is
like Life, being full of #. downs, only they are all pleasant. Here
you have timber, with glimpses of London through some of the clumps,
ponds, fern, and deer lying about in it, more numerous than ever the
stags were in Capel Court. Here is, the “Great. Lodge,” once the
abode of SR Robert WALFOLE, and at which GeoRGE THE FIRST
used to tipple punch with his ter. Here is also another ministerial
residence, the smaller Lodge, occupied by LoRD JoHN. Russell, a
statesman whom History will also mention in connexion with Punch,
Richmond Park was celebrated until lately for open air collations, but
the Public are now debarred from the right of pic-mic; and notice-boards
inform trespassers that, the roads excepted, the keepers who shoot the
deer have no directions to mind where they fire. , Were you to yenture

was to telegraph the execution of ANNE, Boley'N; and we view the
spot with a feeling of astonishment that the earth did not open, and
swallow his Majesty.
The visitor to Richmond Park must not leave it without giving three
mental cheers to the memory of MR. John Lewis, Shoemaker, of
Richmond, who by an action at law against AMELIA, daughter of
George THE SEcond, the then Ranger, defeated her attempt to
exclude the public. Unfortunately there are no similar means of re-
moving all restriction on enjoyment of the Park; but, with a view to this
object, let all writers at any rate persevere in the Lewisian system.
Quitting Richmond Park-with some sense of indignation as a
Briton, you go where you like, which may as well be by way of pleasant
fetersham to peaceful Ham Common, where, “in a season of calm
weather,” you will feel yourself as º as any donkey you will find
grazing there—unless you are as dull as a donkey yourself. Thence
you proceed through a quiet green avenue of elms to shadowy myste-
rious old Ham House, where you may hearken to the wind whisperin
among the solemn pines, and the birds warbling among the ilex an
lime-trees, and then, going a little way up the river, hear the jocund
guſlaws of the reveilers on Eelpie Island.
Here you may hail a passingboat, and proceed to drop a tear as you

hitherto, of going to pass along summer's day at Kensington. It is
our aim to open out before the public eye the resources of the place, to
explore its gardens, to leap about its gravel pits, to examine the beauties
of its renowned lace, and, in fact, to do ample justice to Kensington
and the Kensingtonians. Placed by nature at the extremity of the one-
and-a-half milestone on the Western Road, and selected by our military
º as the first station for sºldiery out of London, Kensington may
said to hold the keys of the Metropolis against a foreign, enemy,
* the foreign enemy to contemplate an incursion við Hammer-
stillth.
There are numerous modes of reaching this spot, which is equally
favoured by geography and the dust contractors, for the distance is
easy, and the contract, for watering the roads is liberal, There are
yarious opinions as to the actual extent of the space which separates
Kensington from London, for while measurement calls it a mile and a
half, the cabman invariably calls it two miles and three quarters; while
the mile-stones which seem to have been moved in one or twº
instances without much regard to their inscriptions, give a sort of
middle version of the affair, and meet both cases -way without
stirring an inch towards either.
Intending to dilate on the antiquities of Kensington, we made dili-
gent inquiries for specimens, but we could get a clue to nothing older
than the oldest inhabitant. Unfortunately we were somewhat tºo
successful in this discovery, for the inhabitant was so thoroughly
ancient that he had º everything we were anxious to know,

ceeded to the Baths, which form one of the principal features—say the
mouth—of. Kensington. These baths are embosomed in a sort of
leaden declivity or dell, to which imagination might lend the title of
“a hundred cisterns.”
To a neighbourhood which has nothing but the nauseous Serpentine,
which, from its smell, º be called the River Oder, it is, indeed, an
advantage to possess a, Bath, free from the deadly impurities of the
Pontine Marshes which characterise the º swamp that
lags along the centre of Hyde Park, and forms, indeed, the scenter of

By this time our summer's day is half over, and we begin to look
about us for a hostelry, when our eye is caught by the sign of the
King's Arms, where we rush to taste the cheerful cheese, quaff the
foaming tankard, masticate the crisp crust, and spread upon the yielding
loaf the *if butter. . As we sit within the coffee-room, we hear
from the lips of the enthusiastic waiter the praises of the Assembly
Room, and, having taken the last munch of the hunch that constitutes
our lunch, we repair to the rear of the premises, for the se of
seeing the Kensington Assembly, Room. It is a pile in Wii. elegance

with their flowing robes, or the patent-varnished highlow beat time to
the vibrations of the fiddle-string, the toodle-oodle of the flute, and the
grunt of the ophicleide. Wizards, Polyphonists, and º meetings
have usurped the place once sacred to Apollo; and the making of
pancakes in hats, the frying of imaginary sausages over a candle, the
conyersations between a fictitious man in an ideal chimney and a sup-
positious woman in a visionary kitchen, are now the chief attractions of |l
a spot once devoted to the assemblies of that place whose bon ton was
so famed as to have given to the village of Kensing the name of
Kensing-ton.
Having sufficiently feasted on the attractions of the town itself, we
turned towards the far-famed gardens, and had no sooner entered within
the western gate, got beyond the watch-box, and caught in our eye the
sun-dial, than the spirit ; poetry overcame us like a summer cloud, and
taking out our calf-skin memorandum book, we prepared a leaf, and
wrote as follows:–
How beautiful the prospect, how marvellous the scene;
How very red the palace bricks, the grass how wondrous green;
How dignified the beadle, how terrible his scowl;
How dirty the aquatic birds, how bold the water-fowl |
How long and straight the gravel walks, how black the rooks or crows :
How silently the Serpentine steals on the eyes—and nose;
How numerous the nursemaids, the juveniles how small;
How the former stare about them, and how the latter fall!
How gaily dress'd the company that come to hear the band;
How ogling one another the gents and ladies stand;
How noble their employment, how singular their worth,
How they’ll be miss'd, when, anyhow, they are removed from earth!
How elegant the carriages, the liveries how º
How wondrous how the owners get all the cash to pay;
How recklessly his mad career the thoughtless spendthrift runs,
With two splendid bays before him, and behind him fifty duns !
This little gush of poetry fresh from the heart, like ginger-beer from
the fountain, caused such an effervescence of feeling, that, having once
got into the subduing company of the Muses, we mused away an hour,
and found ourselves one of a party of thirty-four outsiders, on a Rich-
mond 'bus, at the close of our summer's day at Kensington.

continually being lost, and found with the ſº difficulty, only to be
ost again. Great excitement caused on board by a black nurse. A
lady with a yellow feather makes a journey to the forepart, and rallies the
gentlemen on their want of gallantry. She succeeds in carrying off two
or three timid young gentlemen in white trowsers and crimson blushes.
THIRD Hour.—More “ducks” drop in, one by one, The ice is broken.
The polkas grow fast and furious. The cheeks of the cornet-à-piston
look pitiably warm, as he sits with his back to the funnel. The poodle
very troublesome. Steward very º with pale ale and bottled porter.
Curious stone bottles produced for the first time. General inspection
of wicker baskets, and mutual exchange of sandwiches. A stout
gentleman very active and funny. A baby begins to cry, and the
rest follow. A grand extemporaneous concert, the principal per-
formers being, the three babies, the poodle, the band, and the waste
pipe, assisted by the slender indy. If continues till the steamer lands
at Rosherville. The cornet-à-piston discovered fast asleep.
Fourth Hour.—Simultaneous exclamation, on entering the gardens,
of “Lor, how beautiful!” Very curious fact—nºt a person, has been
at Rosherville before | The poodle refused admission. “No dogs
admitted.” Grand indignation of the lady, who folds her darling to
her lacerated bosom, and walks away. º breaks up into twos and
twos. Tender inquiries by fathers and mothers after their daughters,
who “cannot be found anywhere.” Stout gentleman buys sixpenn'orth
of detonating balls, and feeds the monkeys with them. Extraordinary
consternation of the latter when they proceed to crack them like nuts.
FIFTH Hour.—Dinner in the Grand Baronial Hall of the Barons
of Rosheryille. Only one waiter amongst three hundred peºple,
but three bands of music, which keep playing different tunes all at
the same time. Plenty to eat, but no knives, and forks to eat it
with. After admiring the gorgeous crests, , and the coats of arms
and the oriel windows, and the pillars as slender as tobacco-pipes, and
the fretted roof waving with a thousand flags that look like so many
silk pocket-handkerchiefs hung out to dry, you abandon all thoughts of
dinner, and determine to make up for it at tea. You turn round to
ick up your hat, which during the dinner you have placed on the floor
ehind you, and find it filled with dirty, plates. You accuse the stout
entleman, but “he has never troubled his head about your hat,” and
É. ntly recommends you to take it to the first ball at the Palace, and
exchange chapeaus with the Nepaulese Ambassador.
Sixth Hour.—The gutta percha Mermaid, the Irish Gipsies, the
Wheel of Fortune, in which “you may win ten pounds,” and the Maze,
in which you are sure to lose yourself, and your patience too, in this hot
weather, till the purchase of a penny guide proves to you how, in medio
tutissimus ibis,”—these, with º: Round Tower, the correct likenesses,
and the moving figures, that look as if they had gºt St. Vitus's Dance,
make the sixth hour fly with the rapidity almost of a lover's minute.
THE SEVENTH Hour flies, away on the same butterfly wings. The
clocks all move by steam at Rosherville. There is the Archery, at which
the oldest and §. stiffest unbend, for as “non semper tendit arcºm
Apollo” (old school-theme reminiscence), so the proudest aristocrat, the
most perpendicular Dombey that ever strutted about, with the con-
viction that the world was made expressly for, him, takes, the kitchen;
poker out of his dignity at Roshery.ille, and pulls of his white-kid
gloves, to join in the general sport. The impression seems to preyail
about these pretty gardens that one must try everything, see everything,

cordingly, old gentlemen pull strong bows, and §: the arrows with

machines, that look like ornamental º uffers; and elderly

EIGHTH HouB.—Tea on the lawn, and great fun occasioned by there
being no milk, when the stout gentleman hands the waiter a large lump
of chalk, and bids him “bring a pailful directly.” Shrimps—but very
small. Stout gentleman declares that the shrimps have been gradually
ſº smaller, ever since MR. CoBDEN's motion for the reduction of
the army. Lots of bread and butter, and incessant cries for more.

NATHAN requested by stout gentleman to waltz round the brim of his

ship is quite well? and would the Baron favour the Nepaulese Princess
(pointing to the black nurse) who is here in disguise with his celebrated
veterinary-college hornpipe amongst the tea things?”
NINTH Hour.—Grand Display of Fireworks in the Arctic Regions.
These Arctic Regions, painted only in two colours—in fact, only one—
a sort of sky-blue, which fully accounts (says the stout gentleman) for
there being no milk at tea. A better subject could not have been
selected to display the boundless resources of the chalk that grows in
such luxuriance upon the premises, for really, from the quantity of snow
there is about the º; it looks like a chalk-drawing. Fearful
Descent of Il Diavolo Somebody on the slack rope, in truth, so slack

With the last rocket, the bell rings for the steamer.
TENTH Hour.—Mothers and fathers rushing frantically about for
their daughters, who cannot be found anywhere, but who, according to
their own representations, were all “down in the cabin.” Steamer
waiting half an hour for the steersman, who at last makes his appearance
with the black nurse on his arm.
ELEVENTH Hour.--Thin lady discovered walking up and down the
deck with the fat, poodle clasped close to her breast. More dancing,

He then, “just for the fun of the thing,” proceeds to rub the face of
the black nurse, who has also fallen asleep by his side, with chalk.

Great amusement when they wake º and laugh at one another.
Distress of the lady on missing her, darling Fido, aggravated by, the

TWELFTH Hour.—A great deal of dancing, and laughing, and loud
talking, and carrying about of glasses of brandy-and-water. The poor
poodle will get *: the legs of the dancers, and is kicked most
unmercifully by everybody. The thin lady is in a state of open warfare
with the entire steamer. Great hilarity, laughter, and cordiality, which
is a strange contrast to the coldness and distance of the gentlemen at
starting. The boat reaches London Bridge at an anonymous hour of

THE POET AT BATTERSEA.
THERE's brightness over
Battersea,there’s bril-
liance in the wave,
} That in a bath of liquid
light its bosom seems
to lave:
But 'tis the merry sum-
shine that, in the sum-
mer time,
Illumes the Thames,
which otherwise were
black as any slime.
And yet I love thee,
Battersea; thy ver-
dant valley yields
The beauty of the buttercup, the fragrance of the fields
The chirrup of the grasshopper, the playful pony’s neigh,
And at the solemn evening hour the donkey's dismal bray.
I’ve known thee in the winter time when cover'd o'er with snow;
I’ve known thee in the summer, when green thy rushes grow;
I’ve known thee in the autumn, when §: margin float
The civic barge, the steamer, and the ordinary boat.
But, oh! the time I loved thee most, the time which I would sing,
Is when thy shores were danced upon by silver-footed Spring;
When every gentle step she took }. the early flowers,
And to reflect her radiance linger'd the evening hours.
Yes; Battersea at springtime is Battersea indeed;
#." her verdant meadows the leaping lamblings feed;
The hoary-headed waterman—the winter being º: -
Across the neighbouring ferry expects a fare at last.
The long-neglected hostelry, upon the weltering shore,
Puts on a gay exterior, and opens wide its door;
The pigeon, too, no longer now fills the ignoble pie,
For by the hand of sportsmanship ’tis privileged to die.
Yes, travellers may sneer at thee, affecting to despise
Thy level flats, O Battersea, thy reach, Red House, and rise;
But often in my chamber, at eventime alone,
I think of thee, my Battersea, my beautiful, my own!
FRIMROSE HILL AND ITS PROSPECTS.
PRIMRose HILL-An eminence upon which are to be found flourish-
ing, (in baskets) the very finest dragon's-blood and, Seville, oranges,
with nuts (in wooden measures), equal to any plucked from Barcelona
hedges. No young man fresh from the country, and determined to
make his way in the metropolis, can have finer views of London
society opening upon him than from this Hill of Primroses. We would
advise an ascent at sunrise, upon a glass of new milk (without the rum,
sugar, and nutmeg). Arrived at the summit, the young man-(and we
know no better way of beginning a holiday)—may set himself to ch90se
a profession. There, to the left, as the clouds draw WF, 8. golden
. of the morn—there he may behold St. Pauſ's Cathedral;
and, eschewing all º of the vain and, carnal twopences taken
at the door, he may think of the, pleasant, prebendal stalls within. So
thinking, he may determine whether he will become a Bishop !
thickest and blackest, being sure that under them is the Temple.
To the right of St. Paul's he may behold—or might, if the Hill were
high enough-Apothecaries' Hall. He may then take counsel with
himself whether he will study physic, so that, in the fulness of time, he
may go to Court, be knighted, and become the Royal Physician!
If as yet undecided, he may pitch his thoughts where the clouds º
to work, and ask of himself,
then he may set his fancies vigorousl
“Shall I go the whole ermine? Shall I start for Lord Chancellor **
Let him not be in a hurry to decide; for, turning still to the west,
there's the Horse-Guards! There, with that flame-coloured cloud,
glowing like the flag of Mars, over it. Will the young man be a soldier?
Wii hē ſº to India—to the Peninsula—to France? Will he have the
thanks of Parliament—the grants of a nation—the title of a peer—
house and lands, and statues, bronze and marble?
Here’s a variety of choice. An Archbisho

Court Physician—a

And JoHN BIGG, the young man, has, in all, five shillings in his
pocket; and without a thought of St. Paul's, or the Horse-Guards, re-
solves to have a day in the fields; to dust himself of the cobwebs of the
shop, and take in a bellyfull of fresh air, and carry home with him
thoughts of country sights and country sounds, that shall keep his spirit
sweet and º for the next fortnight. No disrespect to the reverence
of prebends, the skill of physicians, the wisdom of chancellors, or the
valour of field-marshals, but is not, JoHN Bigg a wise fellow in his
time? And knows he not how truly to enjoy and make the most of
Primrose Hill?
BLACKWALL AND WHITE-BAIT.
H-
-
Fº
º
º
EQENT experience convinces us that no summer
holidays can have been conscientiously fulfilled,
without a serious visit to Blackwall; so named,
because, says STRYPE, it is a wall of the
Thames; and further, because of the blackness
of the º that grow on the other side.
What these plants were, whether ebony-trees
or London geraniums, the Antiquarian does not
specify; but we incline to think they were the
blackthorn that, since the fall in Chinese bohea,
has obtained a very general circulation, like
much of the shot of the royal arsenal, in canister.
Perhaps there are few things that can better
reconcile a man to his unredeemed stamp, than a comfortable seat at
the window of LovEGRove's Tavern; called the Brunswick, from the
accession of GEORGE THE SECOND and his QUEEN, who were accus-
tomed to eat sprats incog, at a house on the site of the present
tavern. The silver gridiron-type of conjugal condition royal
delights—used by, the , QUEEN, became the property of HoRACE
WALPolk, and at the sale of the Strawberry Hill effects, was purchased
by MR. PLUMPTRE, under the amiable delusion that it was the identical
gridiron used in Smithfield, and chronicled in Fox’s “Book of Martyrs.”
Seated, we say, at the window of the Brunswick—with the dinner in
short perspective-man is prepared for the sweetest impressions; and
one of these is, white-bait. This is a small fish, pronounced for a long
time by the learned to be little other than the rudiments of fish;
blighted whiting, or infant haddock. It is now, however, º
determined that, the, white-bait, small as it is, is nevertheless a full-
own fish; in the like way that LoRD JoHN Russei, however little,
is, for LoRD JoHN RUSSELL, a full-grown minister. For our own part,
after the experience of many years—for we are proud to show hair
grown grey in the consumption of white-bait—we are inclined to believe
the fish a composition of the most delicious elements; the principal of
which are iced punch and brown-bread-and-butter, without which no
white-bait can be complete. -
We understand that the most scrupulous attention is necessary to
the proper cooking of white-bait. The fish must be cooked within an
hour after it is ...i. and it must be taken in nets of gold and silver cord,
netted by mermaids for the purpose; meshes of common twine inevitably
ruining the delicacy of the fairy-flavour. The cook must prepare him-
self for his task, by reading out one of the most delicious stories from
“The Arabian Miº by way of purification from the grosser business
of daily life. The kitchen-boy assisting will be of all the better service
if skilled in the harmonicon, or any other tender instrument that “gives
delight and hurts not.” The fish is cooked in water of the Pactolus in
a golden pan; from which they are removed in a jewelled skimmer, once
the property of PRESTER John, and from him passing into the posses-
sion of the great LoRD CLIVE, from whom it descended it is here need.
less to follow the zig-zag)—to the landlord of the Brunswick. The fish,
removed by the skimmer, are thrown on a stratum of flour, ground from
wheat grown in Elysium, flour, contained in a napkin woven, by Graces
and Bacchantes. When deliciously smothered in the meal, they are
laced in the sieve of the Danaidae, and superfluous particles removed
y skilful and tender sifting. They are next thrown into melted lard,
composed of the marrow of WENus's doves; where an extraordinary
sort of ebullition takes place. . They are then removed by skimmer to
cullender to drain, and served hot as love. , Cayenne, from the Island
of the Blessed, with lemons from the Gardens of the Hesperides, at
i. well-served party, invariably attend them. We feel we should
insult the most inexperienced er of either sex, did we seem to insist
on iced punch. That is of such paramount importance, that no white-
bait can be complete without it, ,
