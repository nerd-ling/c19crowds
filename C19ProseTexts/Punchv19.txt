UNCH now stands Eighteen Volumes high in the world, without his
stockings. And as he grows a Volume every Six Months, it is a
calculation which he defies Joseph HUME to disprove—that he,
PUNch, is, with the present balmy June, exactly NINE YEARs OLD.
PUNCH,-twiddling a sprig of geranium between his finger and
thumb, a radiant bit of La Reine des Français; white as though
nourished with the milk of VENUs’ doves, and pink as though
reflecting VENUs’ blush—PUNch bethought him of a Fitting Presence,
whereto he might dedicate this, the closing Work of his Ninth
Year.
There was inspiration in the thought. PUNch leapt from his
velvet chair. “We will dedicate it to skittles 1 yes”—said we,
glowing with the grateful notion,-" we will dedicate the close of
our Ninth Year to Nine Pins !”
PUNCH gently subsided into his seat, took his Vulcanic pen,
spread out his elephantine sheet of paper, and, beginning his
Dedication, wrote,
“TO NINE PINS.
“This Volume, the fruit of -”
A sharp knock at the door, and enter Mr. Respectability. We tossed him the sheet, and in few
words, made known our intention, whereupon Mr. Respectability, drawing himself up, and throwing a glance
at us, sufficiently withering to blight—even in June—a whole wall of peaches, in a sort of cold, hissing
voice, said—but we give the dialogue. -
Mr. Respectability. In the name of all our institutions, the Three per Cents., the Court of Chancery,
and the Best Pew of the Church, in the name of all these, what are you about 2
PUNch. A debt of gratitude, dear Sir. Many a jolly hour, in bye-gone days, has PUNch had with
skittles. Dear nine old friends ! true friends, for with all the readiness in life, they’d be knocked down
a hundred times to serve us. Can't always say as much for flesh-and-blood, eh?
Mr. Respectability. My good PUNch, this was all very well when you squeaked in the street; but
you must remember, you are now a householder with fine plate-glass windows; you never appear but—as
housewives have it—in print, with illustrations sparkling about you that defy the most golden evening-waistcoat.

iy PREFACE.
PUNCH. What’s that to do with it 7 Nine-pins are nine-pins just the same. Hearts of oak were
they in old times and—in a word—skittles shall have our Volume.
Respectability (throwing himself between PUNCH and his Sheet of Paper). I protest against it. As
your friend—your bosom friend, MR. PUNch.
MR. PUNCH. Friend! Fiddlededee When we were friends with skittles, you turned up your nose
at poor PUNCH.
Respectability. Sir, that painful gesture is sometimes a stern duty of life. Society, my dear friend,
is frequently saved by the judicious turning-up of noses; and if it was my hard position to be compelled
to despise you when in the gutter, have I not—PUNCH, I put it to your beating bosom—have I not
cultivated you ever since you lived in a house?
MR. PUNch. There’s no denying it. Nevertheless, whatever may be the consequence, I dedicate the
fulness of my Ninth Year to Nine Pins.
Respectability. Then PUNCH, I’ll tell you the consequence. You’ll be cut, Sir; cut. You’ll never -
dine beyond Baker Street more—you will never again, surmounting all obstacles, have your glittering name
registered as guest in the Morning Post; and, in a word, Sir, that great hope, end and aim of your daily
life, that vision of your sleep, and torture of your nightmare, to shake hands in open Pall Mall with a
Duke, that glorifying triumph, that social apotheosis, will be for ever and for ever barred, denied you.
Thus spoke Respectability, and cowardice—like an ague—crept over the heart of PUNch.
“What must we do?” we faltered, looking entreatingly at our stern but truthful monitor. “The
Volume must be dedicated, and, if not to Nine Pins, to what—to whom, then * *
“To whom?” cried Respectability, rising upon his toes, and distending his mostrils, “Why, to
THE NINE MUSES : *
“Be it so,” said PUNCH, with compelled resignation; “be it so;” nevertheless, it would have looked
much better, truer, and altogether more delightful to our recollections, had the Volume been offered
TO NINE PINS
However, Custom—says the Poet—is the King of Men. Now, if Custom be the King, how often is
REsPECTABILITY the Tyrant?

CALIFORNIAN GLOSSARY.
Californian. English.
Dust-bin . - . . A Pocket
Dust-hole - - . A Sacramento Bank of issue.
Dust to Dust - . . Man, go and dig.
Dusty Bob . - . A Shilling's worth of Gold.
'Ow dust you . . . What are you worth?
Flying Dustman . . A Spendthrift.
To dust a jacket. . . To lace a coat.
Devil's Dust Money.

Dig-nity - . Getting Money.
In-Dig-nity - * . Not getting Money.
Spade-husbandry . . Digging Gold and keeping it.
Poor . - - . . Having plenty of Gold, but
nothing to buy with it.
CALIFORNIAN MEASURES.
One inch given = One ell taken.
One foot of digging = Two inches of a bowie knife.
One summary measure = One Indian tribe massacred.
PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE.-There will be visible fre-
quently in the neighbourhood of Smithfield a collision be-
tween Taurus (the Bull) and Gemini (the Twins), by which
the Gemini will be thrown into the Libra (or Scales). The
Dog-star, in a state of hydrophobic rabies, will rush away
from Aquarius (or the Watering-pot); and the Virgo (or
Maiden lady) will become a falling star, and drop to the
ground suddenly.
To GAME PREservers.-On the 14th of February give
your gamekeepers a holiday; for, on this day, the feathered
tribes pair: so that the poachers will not be able to destroy
a single bird.
Suspicious CHARACTER.—Nothing in England carries so
much suspicion upon the very face of it as-a moustache.
SoLAR PHENoMENA.—Among the Eclipses for the year
sºsºs.-->
1850 we must not omit to notice the total Eclipse of “DID You want YER Door swept, MARM "
the Sun, which occurs every day in the Vernon Gallery.
MEMS. FOR PAYERS OF ASSESSED TAXES.
Tax on BurchERs' HoRsks.-Always having to trot ten miles an hour, and to go hardest
over the stones.
ON Horses Not ExceedING 13 HANDs HIGH.—Having to drag a four-wheeled chaise,
with a stout gent, his stout wife, and four healthy children.
ON CARRIAges.—if the tax on a carriage be £5 5s., and the tax on “every additional
body used on same carriage" be £33s., required the tax payable on a Hammersmith 'bus, with
sixteen additional bodies on the roof.
ON SERVANT-MEN.—Masters have to pay for one, £1. 4s.-N.B. This does not include
breakage, beer, or board wages.
For every WAITER IN ANY TAveh N or EATING-House.—One penny per meal, if you wish
to be looked upon as a gent.; or all your loose coppers, if you wish to be considered a gentleman.
GENERAL Directions FOR RAILWAY
TRAVELLErs.
TIME-Depends on the Railway. To ascertain it on the
South-Eastern or North Kent Line, you must go to every
station and wait till a train comes.
CHILDREN.—Children under 10 years of age charged half
fare, which is not half fair, when they're big for their
age. Infants in arms may not be strangled, though every
one travelling out of town in their company is certain “to
to the country with a good cry,” —as recommended by
R. Dish Arli.
Smoking—Not allowed, from obvious motives; except to
the locomotives and the axle-boxes.
RAILway SERVANTs—Are generally their own masters
and yours into the bargain. A book is kept for complaints,
called the Station Book, because, though complaints be
entered in it, they very seldom get out but remain
stationary.
Luggage.—The best adhesive label you can usc is to
stick to it yourself.
Railway CoN.—Why are all English Railway Directors
French Railway Shareholders? Because they all always
take a Lyons share.
THE YouNg Cuckoo A CRicketer.—Fact; for the old
Cuckoo lays her egg in the hedge-sparrow's nest, and the
young one, soon after it is hatched, bowls the young hedge-
sparrows out.
HIGH AND Low WATER.—It will be low water at the
Charing Cross Fountains when it is high water at the
adjoining Baths and Washhouses.
A BLAck Suspicion.—That accomplished young vocalist,
JETTY TREFFz, takes a trip to America; and the Yankees
won't go and hear her on account of her Christian name.
Fire Insurances must be Paid To-day (Jan. 8).-Better not.
Be burnt out like a man, and trust to friends.
Good Wishes for January.—May you ne'er want a friend,
and a barrel of oysters to give him.
To FIND THE WALUE or A Cook.-Divide the services rendered by the wages paid; deduct
the kitchen stuff, subtract the cold meat by finding how often three policemen will go into one
area, and the quotient will help you to the result.
To FIND THE WALUE or A FRIEND.—Ask him to put his name to a Bill.
To FIND THE VALUE or TIME.-Travel by a Bayswater Omnibus.
To Find the VALUE of EAU de Colognk.—Walk into Smithfield Market.
To FIND THE WALUE of PATIENCE.-Consult BRADshaw's Guide to ascertain the time of
starting of a Railway Train.
Fight to come off IN FEBRUARY.-The mill between Spring and Winter will take place
this month. It is expected that Old Snowy will show play; but the odds are ten to one on the
Werdant Youth.

LADY DAY's BIRTH-DAY.
I SHALL come into the world—full-grown—on the 25th of March. It is by no
means improbable that my disposition mayFº both of the Lion and the
Lambi, my voice, something between a roar and a bleat. All my ancestry—from
the first Lady Day that smiled on Lady Eye-has been romping and hoydenish;
sweeping and bouncing about the earth like a jolly fat girl in a drawing-room.
He not surprised, if you see melay, hold of the trees, and give them a lusty
shaking-all for their gºod: to stir the bloodin their veins, and make it circulate,
and burst intº green life. And further, should you hear me rattling at your
window, or—if more boisterously given-should see me playing with and pitching
tiles, like quoits, from the house-top, -take it all in good part, as of no mischief
meant, but as proof of my vigorous lustihood, with my loud, clear voice, I may
wake millions of things from their winter-sleep: shake the drowsy bat in the
church loft; call back birds from over the sea; cry out to the rooks to mend their
nests; and, kissing the waters, startle the fish, quickening them with my breath.
And, if you have an eye and a heart for such matters, you will see me sporting
with the young lambs; and blowing gently amid their white, tender wool; and
now giving them arouse that makes them leap from the earth, frolicking with
Lany Day. And more; whispering about the hives, you may hear me calling out
the bees to come to the banquet of spring flowers, that Lady Day wears in her
hair, and holds in brimming bunches in her hands: snowdrops, violets, with tulips
that glance fire even into the heart of a Dutchman. My roughest singing is fun
of promise; a promise of fruit and blessed corn. So learn this moral § m Lady
Day:-even in the voice of a tempest to hear the accents of hope; in the roar of
a hurricane to have faith in gentle airs and pleasant sunshine.

|U2'--
midsummer's Birth-DAY.
THE world may safely reckon upon my birth on the 24th of June. This year
I propose to enjoy myself—to make up for the pinchings that my elder
brothers, MasTERs Midsummer Forty-Eight and Forty-NINE-(poor fellows!)—
suffered at the hands of men; having nowhere to recreate, and no money to spend.
Therefore, gentle friend, expect me, on the 24th, to look in at your window—which
pray leave open–with a gracious smile, and a delicious whiff of flowers. I shall
then observe, “Arise, my friend, and come forth-taking the arm of Midsummºn.
Let us away to Covent Garden, and consider the peas in their sweetness, the
strawberries in theirglory. Let us pluck our roses while we may; eat our whitebait
while we have health and strength; and quaff our modest glass of hock with the
pleasant hour as it passes. And so wander with the wife of your bosom, or the
wife that is to be, sipping from flower to flower, and be the ice at Grangen's the
only coldness that shall ever come between ye. And as Crab is the zodiacal
genius of my birth, so do proper homage to the sign, by sacrificing to a Lobster at
the supper hearth. º then come with Midsummºn into his fields, and take
pleasure and gather wisdom from what Midsummºn there hath done for you. Listen
to the cuckoo, and take heed how you do nought but talk of yourself; behold the
grasshopper, how merrily he sings and vaults, because he has nothick blood in
him. See the millions of flowers that smile upon you, and—dropping on-a
haycock, a throne for Arollo—consider what a beautiful world is above you,
and about you; and take heed you do your best to be worthy of the goodness that
abounds in it, and is heaped in all places.”
DIRECTIons. To Make a will.
Take a light dinner, with three-
fourths of a bottle of sound genial port
to open the pores of the heart. Cut all
your animosities off with a shilling.
If, however, you have a design against
the artist who painted your portrait,
you will bequeath it to the National
Gallery. To insure society to your
widow, only leave her your fortune on
express condition that she marries
again. After this, should she prefer
poverty, the compliment will be doubly
valuable. Should you have a grudge
against any particular parish, leave a
leg of mutton and trimmings to be
rung for three times a week at all the
churches.—N.B. If you make your will
yourself, make it short and straight-
forward, like the wordson a finger-post.

former takes what it likes, and the latter gives more than he likes. In short,
every Englishman may be said to possess two shadows—his own genuine, true-
born shadow, and the Government presentation shadow; but there is this
difference between the two, that, whereas his own shadow merely walks after
him, the Government shadow walks into him if it is not paid the moment it

SET FAIR.
BARLEY-WATER FOR THE HEALTHY.
Soak common barley in water, and set by in heaps till it begins to sprout, when dry it
by exposure to a tolerable heat. Pour on the barley, thus prepared, hot water in proportion
to the strength of which you wish the liquor to be. Strain, and flavour according to taste,
with an infusion of the dried leaves of the Humulus Lupulus, or common hop-plant. Add to
the compound, before it has cooled, a small quantity of baker's yeast, and let the whole
remain in a warm place till an effervescence, which will occur in it, shall have subsided.
Then draw off into convenient vessels—wooden barrels are preferable—and reserve for use;
the best place to keep it in is an ordinary cellar. This beverage may be made in quantities
of from 10 gallons upwards, and from half-a-pint to a pint of it forms an agreeable draught;
though some will drink as much as a quart at a pull.
To TELL THE Moon's AGE.-It being, in our opinion, ungallant, if not ungenerous, to
tell a lady's age, we shall give the moon the benefit of her sex, and will say nothing about
her age to anybody.

Light is a scarce article, that is laid on by Somerset House at so much a pane, and which

the extinguisher of the Sun, and in this manner does Government increase the enlightenment
of the people by keeping them in the greatest possible darkness. The window-tax is the
blindest measure that was ever put upon a nation, to keep it in the dark.
HOW TO MARE THINGS PLEASANT AT A DINNER PARTY.
Talk incessantly of your dear departed wife—or railway shares—or the prevalence of small-

Michael-Mas DAY's BIRTH-DAY.
ON the 29th of September, I shall descend upon the world—upon the back of a
fine fat stubble goose. The goose I shall fly in at the kitchen window, offering
the bird as sacrifice to the fireside gods. You will be sure to invite a chosen few
-or not a few, according to the circumference of the mahogany, (I dote on a
round dinner-table)—to keep the Birth-day of Michael MAs. The house will, at an
early hour, smell like a Pagan altar with odoriferous herbs and squillae. You
wiii after dinner give the Immortal Memory of Queen Elizabeth, as she appeared
at Tilbury Fort, preparatory to the cooking of the goose of the Spaniards. You
will then, if your Port be particularly good, in a meat speech, give the British
Constitution, requesting the company to be so good as to remember what they
have escaped by the destruction of the Dons. How, at this minute, they might be
able to talk nothing better than Castilian; how Sherry might have defeated
Barleycorn; how the national hornpipe might have given place to the fandango,
and the graceful and no less equivocal paletot for ladies have been laid upon the
shelf by the odious mantilla. How Spanish flies might have blown in our larders,
to the destruction of the English blue-bottle; how the sweet freedom of Exeter
Hall might have knelt to the tyranny of the Inquisition; and even decent Smithfield
been turned into a place for bull-fights. That you have escaped all these national
horrors, you owe to the tutelary genius of England, strong in a certain Michaelmas.
Tax-gatherers might have levied with the thumb-screw, and the water-rate been
enforced by the strapado. Dos NARwarz might have been Jack of the Red Box
at the Foreign Office, vice Wiscoust PALMEaston nowhere, and the English
3 per cents been only a shade higher than Spanish Bonds. That all this is all
otherwise, you will thank the spirit of English Michael Mas, and drink his
lusty health, and in his honour, roast Spanish chesnuts accordingly.
REGISTRATION or births.
When a child is born, it is necessary,
within 42 days, to give notice to god-
fathers and godmothers, what name or
names the blessed infant is to bear, that
the initials may be duly registered in
the silver mug expected.
BREAKFAST ABROAD.
On some fine morning, the city which
you reside in undergoing a siege, you
ring for your egg and toast; instead of
which there comes a shell and a roll of
musketry.

PljMCH'S Al, Mºſſ: F9R 850.
HOW TO MAKE LIFE EMINENTLY DISAGREEABLE.
(By a strong-minded Married Woman).
Always provide for everything beforehand. As things are sure to turn out differently from
what you have arranged, this will familiarise you with disappointment.
Always go back upon a mistake or a misfortune, and so take the º of proving how
much better things would have been if something had been done that hasn't.
Never give way in trifles, as there is no saying how soon you may be called upon to give
** in matters of more importance.
mistress may talk at her servants, but should never lower herself so far as to talk to them.
Never dress for your husband, which will teach him to value you for your gifts of mind,
not your attractions of person.
Never give expression to your affections, as there is no saying how soon they may alter,
and you may thus be guilty of great inconsistency.
Never consult the taste of your husband, or he will in time come to look on his house as a
Club, where all is comfort and self-indulgence. -
SENTIMENT IN SPRING-The solitary rambler will now observe that the meadows, after the
vernal showers, are adorned with the ranunculus or bachelor's button; and will wish he could
say the same of his shirts when they come home from the wash.
TYPOGRAPHICAL EARTHQUAKE.
Last year a severe shock of an earthquake was felt on the extensive grounds of the English
Language, which trembled to that excess in consequence, that it nearly lost all its parts of speech,
and for weeks could hardly articulate. The shock was the most severe in the Strand, on a
small spot occupied by the office of the Fonetic Nus. (“Pece 2 iſ, hashes!") Every dictionary
was turned topsy-turvy, and words were found wanting to express the consternation that was
experienced on reading the newspaper that was published soon after the earthquake. Not a
syllable had been left standing in its proper place; broken nouns and damaged adjectives were
strewed about in every direction; verbs were knocked into the most disfigured mass of verbiage;
indefinite articles were rendered still more indefinite; and prepositions, participles, and pronouns
lay in such a preposterous heap of unpronounceable rubbish, that it would have puzzled any
lexicographic coroner to have pronounced a single sentence upon them.
Wishing. Them MANY happy returns.
We see that Tobacco is to be included amongst the provisions to be sent out to SIR John
FRANKLIN. We hope Government will not forget to send him, for the good omen of the thing;
a liberal quantity of short cut and returns, so that SIR John may soon “pipe all hands
cheerily for England.
The TRIUMPH of Good HUMoUR.—Waiting whilst a stuttering man gets through the word

A FEW GOLDEN RULES TRANSMUTED INTO BRASS.
The BRAzen Rule.
1. Put off till to-morrow the dun who won't
be done to-day.
2. When another would trouble you for a
trifle, never trouble yourself.
3. Spend your money before you have it; and
when you have it, spend it again, for by so doing
you enjoy yourmeans twice,insteadofonly once.
4. You have º'. do a Creditor willingly,
and he will never be troublesome.
The Goldren RULE.
1. Never put off till to-morrow what you can
do to-day.
2. Never trouble another for a trifle which
you can do yourself.
3. Never spend your money before you have
it, if you would make the most of your means.
4. Nothing is troublesome that we do will-
ingly.
A DIFFERENCE OF AGES.
Man has Seven Ages. Woman has but Two—the age of twenty, and the age of thirty-nine.
A woman who had lived beyond the age of forty would be immortalised throughout the world as
a female Old PARR, and would make the fortune of several quacks, by bequeathing her name
to a Life Pill, to be used, of course, only by gentlemen, for women, it is well known, have a
decided objection against growing old; and if they took a Life Pill at all, it would be one to
make them grow younger and not older.
PRESENCE OF MIND IN PRESENTS.
Every present should have a hidden meaning in it; for instance, if a gentleman is despe-
rately in love with a young lady, he cannot do better than give her a foot-muff, as it implies,
in the openest manner, that he is a muff always ready to lie at her feet; and if a young lady
is dying to be married to a young gentleman, she can tell him so in the most flattering,
insinuating way; by giving him a most beautiful embroidered slipper—mind, only one, as
it is the very oddness of the present which confesses to him that, to complete the happy
pair, he alone can supply the handsome fellow.
To PERSONs ABout to CoMMENCE Housekeeping.—Of all housekeepers there is not one
that will keep a house longer than the Court of Chancery. It will keep it for a hundred
years, and, at the end of that period, the house will be so thoroughly cleaned out, and swept
from top to bottom, that no one shall know it to be the same.
KENSINGTON GARDENING OPERATIons.—Mothers should prepare for the season, by planting
out delicate off-shoots with a view to grafting on to young sprigs. For the purpose of grafting,
it is better to select the older branches, which should be nailed with care.
Licenses.—A marriage license costs five pounds, and a pawnbroker's license costs fifteen.
It has never yet been decided by the law authorities, whether a marriage license may be
dispensed with in cases where a pawnbroker's license has been obtained; the latter, perhaps,
conferring the power of pledging one's vows, and popping the question.

THE COMMERCIAL VIEW-The muslin home-market is in a state

the article is a mere drug. Hands can scarcely command a purchaser,
and the inquiries for hearts are very few. Sempstresses are quoted at
lamentably reduced figures, and domestic servants, at no time parti-
cularly brisk, are now duller than ever. The colonial trade in this
description of goods, however, is still lively, they being especially in
request in Australia, whither some shipments of them have been
already consigned; and it is to be hoped that every facility will be given
to their continued exportation.
THE, CyNICAL VIEW -Wherever there is mischief, women are sure
to be at the bottom of it. The state of the country hears out this old
flying: All our difficulties arise from a superabundance of females.
. only remedy for this evil is to pack up bag and baggage, and start
em away.
THE ALARMIST WIEw.—If the surplus female population with which
we are overrun increases much more, we shall be eaten up with women.
What used to be our better half will soon become our worse nine-tenths;
a numerical majority which it will be vain to contend with, and which
will reduce our free and glorious constitution to that most degrading
of all despotisms, a petticoat government.
IN A SERIES OF WIEWS.
THE DOMESTIC VIEW.—The daughters of England are too numerous,
and if their Mother cannot otherwise get them off her hands, she must
send them abroad into the world.
The Scholastic WIEw.—The country is fast losing its masculine
character, and becoming daily more feminine. Measures must be taken
for restoring the balance of gender, or there will soon be no such, pro-
erty as{.. qua marihus in Great Britain, and not a stiver We
ave to bless ourselves with of aes in praesenti.
THE NATURALIST's VIEw.—On the Cockney Sportsman's game-list
there is a little bird called commonly the chaffinch; by Hampshire
youth, the chink; and by LINNAEUs, Fringilla caelebs., LINNAUS was a
Swede, and called the chaffinch celebs, because in Sweden and other
northern countries, in winter, the females migrate, and leave the males
bachelors. It is to be wished that our own redundant females were far
enough north to take wing, like the hen-chaffinch.
Our own View.—It is lamentable that thousands of poor girls
should starve here upon slops, working for slopsellers, and only nºt
dying old maids because dying young, when stalwart mates and solid
meals might be found for all in Australia. Doubtless, they would fly as
fast as the Swedishhen-chaffinches—if only they had the means of flying.
It remains with the Government and the country to find them wings.
A Glorious Resolve.
AN important resolution has just been come to by the Corporation of
Rºchester, whose members, we are told by the public press, have
determined to wear appropriate costume on all future public occa-
sions.” There must be some very determined characters among the
Corporation of Rochester, for it requires no little determination in
these days to resume the masquerade dresses of a Mayor and Alderman,
after it has once been agreed to abandon them. It is rare, indeed, that
we find persons desirous of hugging their chains, even though they be
of an Aldermanic character.
The Dignity of Coal.
THE New York Enquirer says of the “Negro Emperor,” that “...his
colour is the most thorough coal-black.” Can this personage be iden-
tical with our ancient friend, KING CoAL? If so, we hope His Majesty
will º up his famous concerts with renewed spirit, and that, the
merry old soul, with his fiddlers and trumpeters, will be merriºr than
ever, now that he has been promoted to be Emperor. .CoAL will make
as good an Emperor, no doubt, as anybody, in the face of his.com:

TRAPS AND RATTLE TRAPS.
THERE must be something quite Hindooish in the constitution of the
British female of our own day, for in spite of every warning she is
continually rushing to the alarming sacrifice. Directly a linen-draper
raises the alarm, and intimates to the pullic an extensive smash or
crash, the British female runs forward to be smashed or crashed, as the
case may be, and to implicate herself in the meshes of some ruinous and
tremendous failure. The Linendrapery Juggernaut has an uninterrupted
stream of female victims throwing themselves constantly beneath it,
and we can scarcely pity them, when, having voluntarily placed them-
selves in the power of the victimiser, they find their retreat rudely cut
off, and their escape impossible.

THREE BUTCHERS BRIDE.
| A LADY, residing in Aldgate, writes a letter to the Times in defence
of the high charges of butchers, on the plea of the hardships endured
by that, class of persons. “I have been,” says this good lady, “a
butcher's wife on and off for the last 26 years”—a piece of information
which she explains by stating:—
“I have had three husbands all butchers, and my last died only six months ago."
| Nevertheless, she asks
“How would my lady customers like their husbands to come to bed at 1 o’Clock,
smelling of beef or mutton suet, and other things too delicate to mention?”
Considering that the worthy widow has had a threefold experience
of such, husbands, we must say she appears to have been singularly
wedded to butchers.
The Experiment of Lodging-Houses.
PUNCH hails with all his heart the opening of the lodging-house for
234 single men in Spitalfields. He sincerely hopes that the success of
the establishment, as regards the single, will lead to its wider appli-
cation to the married. He supposes it was tried on first with the
maxim—“Fiat experimenium in corpore vil.”

I came up a month ago, next Wednesday, to keep house for AUGUSTUs,
who I hope and trust will succeed, in his profession, and in his poor
Uncle's time, when he lived in the Cottage, having none of our own
we considered him as such, and used to wash him in the country. f
know he’ll never forget his poor Aunt, and how nice his things used
to be sent him, without speck or spot, as white and as sweet as
lilies, without a rumple or a crease, and not a button off any of them.
So, when I got here, I took and looked over his linen, when lo, and
behold you, it was all shrids and fribbits, the pleats of the shirt-fronts
slit all up, the gussets unripped, the backs all in holes, and the rest as
rotten as a pear; and his sheets the same, and his night-gowns, and
night-caps, and his doileys, fit for nothing but to make tinier of and
that is no use now they have those dangerous congreves. . His best silk
handkerchiefs I bought myself, and gave five shillings a-piece for, worn
to rags, worse than old dusters; his drawers and under-waistcoats,
fine merino, patched all over with calico, and his poor toes coming
through his socks. ‘Gracious goodness? AUGUSTUs,' I said, “how
you have been wearing out vour things.” “Well,” he says, “Aunt, I
don’t know how it is.” “Well,” said I, “it’s v strange.” But I
soon found out the reason. Not more than twice I sent my own
things to the wash, when home they came; my frills that I had only
just made up myself; my capes and cºllars bran new ; my shimmyzetts
and everything in jags and tatters. Shameful! Shocking! Scandalous!
My linendraper's bill had just come in, five pounds ten and sixpence:
halfpenny, if a farthing; and all my nice things spoiled. Abominable!
You may suppose I gave our Washerwoman a pretty talking to; but
what do you think I found out? I said to her *** [We are under

AND I Found IT was ALL BECAUSE THEY Use BLEACHING Powder |
Yes, Mr. Punch; that is what the nasty lazy old creatures do to
save trouble. They might as well steep things in vittril, or º them
into the fire to be cleaned, as I have heard is done with clothes made
out of ashb-stis. This is how my beautiful aprons, every one, and all
Augustus's table-cloths, and each bit of under-clothing we have either
of us got, have all been ruined. Besides, the bleaching only whitens
the dirt— doesn’t get it out, so it is nasty as well as destructive. I
have no patience with those good-for-nothing washerwomen that eat up
our clothes, worse than moths, in this way; it is a sin. There is quite
waste enough in every house without that... Do, pray, Mr. Punch, try
your best to put down this wicked system of washing; and the save it
will be, and the distress you will remove, and the dreadful scenes of
passion and scolding that you will prevent, there is no saying. Do, Sir,

DEPOSITS FOR THE SINKING FUND.
WE present MR. DisBAELI with the following small deposits for his
Sinking-Fund.
Westminster Bridge, which looks in such a very weak state that we
are sure it is gradually sinking. -
The new façade to Buckingham Palace, which has sunk the remainder
of the building to the very lowest insignificance. - - -
MR. CHARLEs PHILLIPs's Letter, which has been the means of sinking
him in the public estimation. - -
And lastſy, MR. DisBAELI's speeches on agricultural questions, which
we are sure are heavy enough to sink anything.
The above are sufficient, to start the famous Sinking Fund, for at
present it is a mater of such very little account that we doubt if there
is any foundation for it at all. We really believe the Fund in question
is nothing more than a mere Fund of Humour, upon which MR.
DiskAELI draws pretty freely as often as he wishes to pay off the poor
Protectionists.
Midwinter Barvest.
In the course of a suburban walk last Saturday, in company with an
acquaintance, we passed a horse-pond, out of which some conſectioner's
men were loading a donkey-cart with ice. On our observing that this

tleman, said “that it certainly was making hay in fine weather.

OUR LITTLE BIRD.
ºf PROPOSAL FOR A MONUMENT TO THE LATE QUEEN DOWAGER.
TheRE have been made several propositions for a monument of some
kind to tell to future generations the abounding goodness of the late
Queen Dowagen. Öme writer proposes that the sum of a hundred
thousand pounds be raised in subscriptions of no larger amount than
half-a-crown, so that eight hundred thousand persons may have a small
share, a stone or brick in the church, to be called Adelaide Church—
an edifice that shall make memorable the piety of the departed lady.
Another kindly projector suggests the erection of a Cross only—a
simple Cross. At which suggestion, we take it, Exeter Hall shakes its
stony head, and glowers with becoming scorn. - -
Another thinks a certain number of Alms-houses, in which poor
gentlewomen may meekly wait to die, would in a manner, significant
as useful, illustrate the active virtues of the noble gentlewoman
who has made so gracious an end, rebuking, nothing save the vanities
of the undertaker, that might follow her; and which, indeed, were not
to be altogether rebuffed even by the last words of an anointed QUEEN.
Pomp would somewhat assert itself.
e meddle not with any of these projects. . If the money be forth-
coming, if the half-crowns leap to the willing hand, let them be paidin,
and let the masons set forth with to work, the trowels tinkling har-
moniously. All we ask is, the enjoyment of our right to propose the
notion of a Queen ADELAIDE Monument, such memorial to be solely
undertaken and wholly carried out at the expense of government.
But then, it may be urged, the expense of government is only a
phrase of course—so many shifting words, the true meaning of which is,
the expense of His Majesty, the People. In this case, however, we
do not propose to lay even an extra pennyweight upon the aforesaid
people. No; the Adelaide Monument shall stand fair and beautiful in
the light, and not cost the people an additional farthing. For the
Monument shall not be of ephemeral Purbeck stone or decaying
granite—but of enduring stuff: of nothing less than Paper—of paper
white and spotless, and typical of the purity of the memory it etermises.
Our plan is wondrously simple—and tº: sovery facile of execution.
One hundred housand pounds a year is saved to the revenue by the
loss of the good QUEEN ADELAIDE. We simply propose that, saving
this much, we repeal the excise upon paper. For consider, what a
serious thing—what a grand thing, is paper! How lofty—how sub-
lime, may be its functions! A sheet of paper is as the physical wing to
the spiritual thought, carrying its presence round about the world.
Upon such wings do the philosophers and poets, the jurists and the
journalists, fly. Upon such wings do all mute words enter into the
souls and hearts of men. What is the paper of a letter, but the wings
bear avoice?
Well, knowing this, it is a little irksome to human patience to know
the many tyrannical and foolish practices wrought upon paperpinions
by the fantastic exciseman. How they are cut and plucked, and Jaden
by a hundred stupid and despotic caprices. The Egyptians, who had a
deep meaning in all their symbols—so deep, it often baffles usin its
darkness—shipped Isis, when she searched for the remains of Osſºrs
in a bark of papyrus—a paper boat; for even the crocodiles respected
the papyrus, never so much as snapping at it. There can be no doubt
that in this the Egyptians intended to manifest the solemn function
of paper as º sacred to the Intellect—a vessel that even the
instinct of savage ignorance should respect. Such was the paper boat
of Isis. How different the fate of the paperboats of Britamia—the
millions of craft made on the banks of her thousand rivulets and
streams' Why, in every paper mill-dam lurk twenty alligators, who,
at any hour, may turn up in the shape of excisemen! And how the
overhaul the boats, what pranks they are duly licensed to play wi
them, it would take too much paper here to tell.
And yet the Sate professes to venerate the function of paper. In
our love of its sublime utility, we make schools for raggedness, and
hope to save from shipwreck the soul of ignorance in a paper boat.
And we do all we can to overload, even to sinking, the paper vessel
with the weight of taxes flung aboard. Wonderful is it to think how, I
with such a crew of excisemen, paper swims?
wº to proceed with our plan for a Paper Monument to the
enor
would ł. a beautiful memorial, and lasting as touching. Her late
Majesty, from her shelf in St. George's Vault, subscribes towards the
repeal a hundred thousand a year.
“Very true,” answers a statistical familiar; “but then the Paper
duty-the tax laid upon the wings of knowledge—was for 1848, not
one hundred, but seven hundred and fifty-one thousand pounds. Thus,
it is clear that the dropped pension of QUEEN ADeLaine, would not
ive even a seventh of the tax. To be sure, the whole mater might
disposed of in a trice if certain of the living would subscribe to the
Monument. If, for instance, a king would send from Hanover a
subscription of £21,000 a-year—if a king in Belgium would do some-
thing—if sinecurists, the white ants of the State, who devour anything
of Queen ADELAIDE. The repeal of the excise on the fabric
in the shape of taxes, and some of whom especially, feed, upon letter-
Fºo; the family tree of a GRAPTon is in truth only a bulrush;
ost Office Fº *—if these, the teeth of the State, would forego
somewhat of their provender, paper would instantly, like Noah's dove,
fly free-nor fly without the olive. But this is not to be hoped,” says
our statistical friend; “and so we must seek a Monument to Queen
ADELAIDE in other materials. Paper is forbidden us. But what think
you of an Advertisement Monument? The amount of duty on
advertisements in 1849—the price paid to the State for permission to
ask custom, or to ask employ in print, was only one hundred and
fifty-two thousand, nine hundred and twenty-six pounds. The late
QUEEN Dowager, in her lapsed pension, at once contributes one
hundred thousand of the sum—whilst the odd fifty-two, why, it is not
to be spoken of-the Life Guards would contribute it in abandoned
gold-lace, or the Maids of Honour offer it in pocket-money. What say
you? An Advertisement Monument to the QUEEN DowageRP”
A most felicitous thought. Far better than the half-crown subscrip-
tion is the eighteenpence saved to the poor who, seeking labour
through the newspapirs, must pay the additional one-and-sixpence to
the Exchequer, or hold their peace. Abolish the advertisement duty;
make such abolition monumental to the memory of the QUEEN
Dowagen, and consider for a moment the number and the condition
of the people who are made to feel the relief granted by QUEEN
ADELAIDE even in her grave. The “Young Lady who wants a situa-
tion as Governess,” feels the royal bounty in her own narrow pocket.
The “Wet-nurse, a respectable married woman,” is eighteenpence the
richer; and “A Good Plain Cook, with no objection to the country,”
saves her one-and-sixpence to help her on her way by rail or coach, the
situation carried. From the schoolroom, —down to the scullery
—the eighteenpenny benevolence would be felt, and the memory of
QUEEN ADELAIDE be efully enshrined.
An Eighteenpenny Monument to the QUEEN Dowagen, by all means.

THE LAST DAYS OF THE PALACE COURT.
As Pompeii was swept away or rather buried under a stream of lava,
so has the Palace Court been destroyed by the volcanic burst of indig.
nation which, within the last year, has broken over it. Its own piteous
wº has been washed away in the lava emanating from that avenging
esuvius, the public mouth, which had sent forth in words that burn,
the doom of the Palace Court.
Friday, December the 28th, will be remarkable in the annals of
enlightenment, as the last day of the sittings of this tribunal. The
Judge was on the bench, but the bar was absent from the melancholy
scene, and a solitary usher attended as chief mourner at the solemnity.
Two attornies acted as mutes, for they never opened their mouths, and
as if to perform an act of pity in its last moments, the Court refused to
make an order upon a poor woman, who attended for her sick husband,
at the suit of a tally-man.”
The case was one with which the Court would, no doubt, have dealt,
in its days of vigour, and rigour; for though the defendant's bed
had been pawned, and the family were starving, there was nothing to
distinguish the case from hundreds of others that had gone before,
and would have come again if the Court had continued to exist;
Happily, the recording angel has something to place among the final
records of the Court which may be accepted as a partial expiation of
some of its past enormities. De mortuis nil nisi bonum. The Palace
Court is dead; so is our enmity.
University Prizes.
THE subjects proposed to the º for prizes in the Univer-
sity of Cambridge, would certainly do credit to the authors of that
popular farthing serial which comes out at four sheets a penny, under
the title of “Nuts to Crack” at Christmas time. The Cambridge nuts
are peculiarly adapted for those who have cut their wise teeth; and
perhaps a dog-tooth or two may be useful in digesting such dog Latin
as Shakesperus, and other terms, in which the University illuminati
luxuriate.
One of the themes for Latin prose, is “SHAKESPEARE and HoMER
compared,” which seems to pave the way for the still greater puzzle in
an ensuing year, of a comparison between Goodwin Sands and Ten-
terden Steeple.

POKERS AND PANTOMIMES.
THE usual outcry,
that things are not as
they used to be, is
applied now-a-days to
everything; and one
would almost imagine,
that “As you were,”
is the only word of
command that pru-
dence ought to ad-
- dress to us..
Among other"lamentations over the past, we are always inundated
about this time of year, with regrets over the fact, that Pantomimes
are not what they used to be. We must admit that they are not; and
we particularly miss the red-hot poker that once played such a promi-
ment part in every pantomime. Clown used to produce, nearly the
whole of his “effects” with this implement; and in fact he presided
over the whole fun of the evening with a red-hot poker, or, in other
words, ruled it with a rod of iron. Poor Pantaloon had the red-hot
'poker continually at his fingers’ ends; and there was not a scene
throughout the Pantomime in which the poker was not introduced for
|some purpose or other. Sometimes it was brought in, that a verbal
{: might be made, and that Clown might say, “Come, you want to
be stirred up.”. Or it was required, in order that a beggar might have
it thrust into his face, with the announcement, “Here, poor fellow;
here's something warm for you.” -
This Poker, which was kept permanently red-hot, never missed fire,
and we can understand how essential it must have seemed to pantomime
writers in the days of our forefathers, whose ideas of wit and humour
were chiefly confined to acts of cruelty on the part of Clown towards
|Pantaloon, or pieces of roguery in which both were concerned, or feats
of gluttony, such as the swallowing of an unlimited chain of sausages.
The days are, however, gone, when fun could be poked at the public
with a Poker. Pantomime writers have now so many other irons in
the fire, that red-hot fire-irons have quite gone out, and it is very
unlikely that they will ever come in again.
Hope for the Rail.
THE depression and sinking of so many Lines of Railway is, in great
measure, attributable to the sleepers; the shareholders, till lately,
|having been for the most part dormant; but they being now fully awake
to their position, it is to be hoped that, in consequence of their future
vigilance, every sunken Line of Rail will be ultimately elevated to its
|proper level.

8 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
* HOW MR. PUNCH SPENT BOXING-NIGHT.
N many occasions Mr. Punch has
lamented the space afforded by his
#. contemporaries to the consi-
eration of the Drama: has as often
lamented the needless expense which
a majestic part of the Press is wont
to incur in the outlay upon dramatic
criticism. No sooner does a new
drama appear, than it is discussed at
monstrous length in daily and weekly
columns, to the exclusion of thrilling
accidents and offences, and the origin
and growth of mighty gooseberries.
Mr. Punch, on the morning of Box-
ing-day, resolved to show to his con-
temporaries a more compendious way
of attending to the interests of the
Drama. When new playhouses spring
up like asparagus, it behoves the
journalist to be chary of his atten-
tion; for if he proposes to notice at
length every work of art—if he rashly
determines to discuss and analyse the
pretensions of every actor—he will
soon have no room whatever to chro-
nicle the mightier events of the time.
ven a popular Murder will be cast
into the shade by a new Tragedy;
and a MARIA MANNING neglected in
the undue attention bestowed upon
merely the Heroine of the Domestic
Hearth-stone.
Punch, therefore, laid . a wager,
against his own pocket, of a supper
at the Clarendon (a celebrated hos-
telry for criticism), that he would
alone criticise every new piece pre-
sented at every. “placed” London
Theatre on Boxing-night. It was a
quarter to seven when he tº:
into his own hackney-cab at 85, Fleet
Street, drawn for the occasion by
a horse from the Parnassian Stables
—a horse now backed by THALIA,
and, now by MELPoMENE, in their
- sky-blue riding-habits. The Olympic
being a bran-new edifice, with its bloom upon it fresh as May hawthorns, Punch drove first thither.
OLYMPIC.—New theatre: commodious, beautiful: light as fairy-land at mid-day, and cosey and
convenient as an easy chair after dinner..MRs. MowATT, the American lily, looking purity—
breathing odour. Opening address. The fair lady dropping a diamond in one line, and a pearſ to
rhyme to it in the other. Delightfully given, retires in a shower of Camellia Japonicas. Two
Gents. of Werona gave capital promise, and every appearance that the new pantomime by LEE
NELson—descendant of the immortal HoRATIO—would be a greater blow than Trafalgar; House
fººley so crowded, impossible for a single housemaid to get a single apple out of
er pocket.
DRURY-LANE-The boards that GARRICK trod—that KEAN (as Richard) died upon. New lessee.
Spirited undertaking ! Tenderest wishes of the good and gentle wait upon it. House crammed.
F. ANDERson's Shylock worthy of the Asylum of Deaf and Dumb; not a word heard—and there-
fore, it is to be hoped, not a word thrown away. Miss ADDISON's Portia. Beautiful in fragments
as they reached us. Casket-scene magnificent. The Golden Casket, we are informed, from gold
sent by a distant dramatist, now picking up the best materials for a new play in California. Row
in the gallery—too crowded." Mr. Andºrsos offered the malcontents £5 a head and his own
º, to make room by quitting the building. Indignantly refused. Storm lulled. Pantomime
egan. Work of Rodweiſ, the 1850. Magician. Harlequin and Good Bess nobly handled. Produced
in us a melancholy but philosophic thought. In the year 2000, another Rodwell—if Nature has
stuff for another—may write Harlequin, and Good (or Better) Queen Wictoria. Pantomime terrific hit
—full of points as a pincushion. Author called for at conclusion, and bouquets of mistletoe and
#." to him Pressed them to his bosom; and, in the very moment of triumph, pricked
gerS.
HAYMARKET-Loving Woman (why will woman love in this desperate manner?) and King Rene's
Daughter. Audience wide awake to the pathos of MRs. KEAN; melt marble, and make cast-iron
run. New burlesque-The Ninth Statue. Evidently a statue of load-stone; made to draw. Full
of hits as a prize-fight. Authors called for. The Gemini BROUGH appear in full Court dresses
and are greeted with rounds of applause, and—in recognition of the season—two plum dumplings.
Authors bow and exeunt, picking out plums.
PRINCEss's-Reader, hast, thou ever, seen Venice?. Hast thou ever seen Venice Preserved?
Hast thou ever gazed upon the Lion of St. Mark? Hast, thou ever mused upon the pigeons that
flutter about his edifice? Hast thou ever marked a gondola? Hast thou ever stood upon the
Rialto P Because, whether thou hast or not, it is no matter, since thou hast seen, or very probably
wilt see a pantomime, which thing originated in Venice, and which matter brings us to the panto-
mime of King Jani, produced at this
theatre.” King Jamie (also by Rodwell,)
“Full of stuff as Highland plaid,
And just as full of crosses,”—
but stuff of wonderful web, and, crosses
enlarging into circles of delight. The
antomime was more successful than any
uture pantomime ever can be... Never-
theless, as revering our institutions; as
defending Magna Charta, the Right of
Succession, the Income Tax, and all the
other Palladiums of once Merry England
(when Traitor PEEL was yet in the future)
—we must protest against this irreverent
usage of our kings and queens. Let the
Chamberlain look to it. The revolutionist
—foiled at Kennington Common—lurks
in the theatre. . The Chartist deprived
of his pike, seizes his iron pen. He
cannot overturn our institutions, so he
knocks down the º of hº as
Clown and Pantaloon, and—but we hope
we have said enough to alarm the weasel
vigilance of LORD BREADALBANE, who,
as a Scotchman and a Lord Chamberlain,
must be particularly sensitive to the sub-
ject of the pantomime, King Jamie, or
Harlequin and the Magic Fiddle. It is,
however, but bare justice to MR. MAD-
Dox, the proof-spirited proprietor, to
state that the piece is fº up reckless
of all expense. Even the fiddle has all
its strings. The outlay upon catgut must
have been tremendous.
LycEUM.—The Island of Jewels—MR:
PLANCHE’s “entirely new and original”
work—is the Serpentine Wert of the
Countess D'ANors. Still, under the
reviving hand of the adapter, †:
Wert becomes an Invisible Green Prince
—just as, in Holywell Street, an Invi-
sible Green Coat is made “better as
new.” Need we say that, the Island q
Jewels is gorgeous? With such a loo
of reality that the paste would not be
detected even by the Keeper of the
Crown Jewels P All the actors did more
than they could to ensure a success that
was inevitable even before the curtain
rose. As for MADAME WESTRIs, it is
plain that
“She on honey-dew has fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise."
She looks more blooming than ever, and
warbles like the º: not to be
“trod down” by “hungry generations.”
The author was called for when the piece
concluded, and retired amidst a shower
of kid gloves—Paris made.
ADELPHI.-Frankenstein is here made
killingly droll. The Model Man of MR.
PAUL #ºn might be improved if
he could only conquer a besetting timi-
dity that ever seems to check his gushing
humour. Why will he not surrender his
genius to the gallery?, Why, as the poet
says, will he “dwell in inevitable decen-
cies” for ever? What a rich humourist
he might be, but then he is so modest.
WRIGHT's Frankenstein is wondrous. Six
children in arms were taken from the pit
to the nearest apothecary’s, in convul-
sions of laughter. In common with thou-
sands of WRIGHT's friends, we await the
result; but we much fear a verdict of
“unconscious infanticide.”
STRAND.— Diogenes and his Lantern.
Like a red herring; full of salt, with a
* Mr. Punch begs, with his customary probity,
to state, that as all this was written a month ago,
it is not to be taken into account as a part of his
work on Boxing-Night.

well-developed tale. A nightly relish for millions. MRs. STIRLING as
Minerva. An owl that makes night lovely.
MADAME Tussaud.—This instructive establishment is not to be
overlooked. Punch, in common with his daily contemporaries, treats
the place with his best deference, and on boxing-night visited it
accordingly. The Chamber of Horrors was tastefully decorated with
holly, and the band played a new composition, “The Bermondsey Polka,”
which seemed to impart a thrilling satisfaction to the audience. Let
us not omit to state that MADAME T., with her º, taste, had
caused a large bunch of mistletoe to be suspended over the figure of
MARIA MANNING, with permission—price 3d. extra—to any of the
company to salute the waxen individual, a permission that was gladly
purchased by numerous spectators.
Some of the Eastern Theatres, and the Surrey Houses, Punch—he
confesses it—did not visit; but he understood, on the best authority,
that they were all crowded. The Victoria, for instance, was so crammed,
that the proprietor had to provide beds out of the house for those who
would not, during the domestic drama, sleep upon the premises.
LEGAL LOWE-LETTERS.
“MR, PUNCH,
“The Law in regard to ‘Breach of Promise of Marriage”
has long been in an unsatisfactory state. Allow me, through your
columns, to give the Legislature a hint on this subject. Let no pro-|:
missory note, or other writing, engaging the subscriber to marry the party
therein addressed or specified, be considered valid or binding unless
stamped. The amount of the stamp should be proportionate to that of
the income-tax paid by the writer, to prevent the abuse of cheap
stamps by the unprincipled rich. Let my proposal be adopted, and
the consequences will be:–1. The most unsuspecting female will put
no trust in a billet-dour which is not stamped. 2. The expense
attending false promises of marriage will discourage those base
attempts at deception. ... 3. Marriages will become generally more
rational, because men will think twice before signing an engagement
which will at any rate cost them a stamp. 4. The stamp-duty on
marriage-promises will be a source of revenue to Government, and of
income to your humble Servant,
3.
“A SoLICITOR AND DISTRIBUTOR OF STAMPs.”
FOWL IS FARE AND FARE IS FOWL.
ENGLAND is at this moment undergoing a glut of poultry, for every
description of fowl, from the guinea to the eighteenpenny, is being
brought over in spite of foul winds from the Continent. Such has
been the arrival of Turkeys, that the markets appeared to have a great
Turkey carpet laid down over them.
The arrival of chickens has been something so extraordinary as to
cause a glut, which has led to an awul panic, and the dealers have
become so chicken-hearted as to be afraid to speculate. , We, however,
hope the consumption will be quite equal to the supply, and that no
fowl will be left on the hands of the fair dealers.
THE FINEST COLUMN IN THE WORLD. :
BRITANNIA is a great deal happier in her heroes than she is in her
attempts to perpetuate their memory. It is fortunate that the actions
of her great men suffice for their own monuments. Those which she
erects, to them do nothing for their fame except to associate it with
something ludicrous. All that can be said to account for this is, that
there is a stone-masonry in British Art. It were better, henceſorth, to
give an allogether new form to these testimonials. Let them no longer
consist of sculptural and architectural monstrosities; but cast them, in
every instance, in the shape of a column, to be provided by the largest
amount of subscription obtainable: and that the memoriaſ may be as
lasting, and at the same time as magnificent as possible, let the column
º#. ; honour of the soldier—the statesman—the poet—be a column
Of Punch.
Gunpowder Honours.
WE condole with the DUCHEss of KENT, the victim of noise. She
takes boat at Osborne, and steams into Portsmouth, when “HER
MAJESTY's ship Wictory and the garrison battery fire royal salutes!”
Now, without waiting to calculate the value of the powder-the price
of so many wheaten loaves blown from the cannon's mouth, to split
the ears of the Duchess—we may ask, is it not a monster folly that an
elderly gentlewoman cannot go to and fro to pay a visit to her children
and grandchildren without, being thus rudely and º saluted
by the “adamantine lips” of 42 pounders? We think all powder
wasted upon a lady-pearl powder, of course, excepted.
THE FARMER'S STORY.
floº -º-º:
-º-Lping
Re-units. *
THE Farmer's story par ercellence, is the upper story of No. 17,
Bond Street, where the Protectionists have got rather a large rocm
with rather a small company. Protection has for some time occupied
what in England we term a floor, and the Scotch call a flat—the latter
*. being in this case the more appropriate. -
e believe a ruined farmer is always on the premises to receive
people who come to be melancholy over the fate of Agriculture; and,
as there are other lodgers in the house, we think it would be only fair
to have “Pull the top bell for Protection,” inscribed on the door-post.
We suspect that the British CEREs must be a very brazen-faced crea-
ture, or she would never cry out to be placed again under Protection;
which, if it did not ruin her in means, most certainly destroyed her
character. We cannot help seeing, nevertheless, that she is better off,
as well as more respectable, without the protection to which she
foolishly wishes to return; for when an alliance with Agriculture is in
the Market, where there is a farm for sale, the competition, is quite
large enough to show that the connection is not considered by any
In eans rulnous. -- - --
Looking on the two pictures our artist has here drawn, it is difficult
to reconcile one with º: other; for while taking a farm seems to be
the object of the most eager desire, to be a fºrmer would appear to
be certain bankruptcy, despair, and ruin.

Reduced Circumstances.
WE, have seen some very gratifying accounts of the reduction of
rents by various landlords, but if there is any actual merit in receiving
a reduced rent, we think there is not a more meritorious person in this
respect than MR. O'Connell. He has been lately taking such a very
reduced rent, that it will amount to a reductio ad absurdum, if it goes
on much longer in the same direction, and at his weekly audits he will
at last have to say, “Thank you for nothing,” to his auditors. Every
rent-day exhibits some diminution in the receipts, and it is to be ex-
pected that before long the subscribers will not only take off something
from the rent, but will take themselves off altogether.

Lull'd by the sound of fancy's gong,
Sought in his visions for a theme
Whereon to found a simple song.
Upon his ear there chanced to fall
A shrill, and old familiar cry;
The Butcher at his market stall
Was shouting, “What d'you buy, buy, buy P*
As quick as the electric spark
Runs o'er the telegraphic wires,
The poet's mind no longer dark,
Blazed with imagination's fires;

Looks with an anxious eye about;
Conscience accuses him of wrong,
He knows the world has ...; him out.
Stern retribution comes at last;
The trembling Butcher heaves a sigh,
And to the prices of the past,
He sobs a sad “Goodbye, bye, bye.”
No more the Butcher gaily drops
His customer a smile and bow;
There’s such a fearful fall in chops,
The Butcher's quite chap-fallen now.

His shoulders are no longer high;
Upon his legs a weakness steals,
They’ll fall much lower by-and-bye.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOBSON'S CHOICE.
OR THE TRIBULATIONS OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH OF A MAN SERVANT.
EroRE my wife's dear mother, MRs. CAPTAIN BUDGE,
came to live with us—which she did on occasion of
the birth of our darling third child, ALBERT, named
in compliment to a Gracious Prince, and now seven-
... and-a-half years of age—our establishment was in
Hº, rather what you call a small way, and we only had
=" female servants in our kitchen. -
I liked them, I own. I like to be waited on by a
meat-handed PHILLIs of a parlour-maid, in a nice-fitting gown, and a pink
ribbon to her cap: and I do not care to deny that 1 liked to have my par.
lour-maids good-looking. Not for any reason such as jealousy might suggest
—such reasons Iscorn; but as, for a continuance and for a harnless recre:
ation and enjoyment, I would much rather look out on a pretty view of
green fields and a shining river, from my drawing-room window, than
upon a blank wall, or an old-clothesman's shop: so I am free to
confess I would choose for preference a brisk, rosy, good-natured,
smiling lass, to put my dinner and tea before me on the table, rather than
a crooked, black-muzzled frump, with a dirty cap and black hands. I
say I like to have nice-looking people about me; and when I used to
chuck my ANNA MARIA under the chin, and say that was one of the
reasons for which I married her, I warrant you MRs. H. was . not
offended; and so she let me have my harmless way about the parlour-
maids. Sir, the only way in which we lost our girls in our early days,
was by marriage. One married the baker, and gives my boy, ALBERT,
gingerbread, whenever, he passes her shop; one became the wife of
Policeman X, who distinguished himself by having his nose broken in
the Chartist riots: and a third is almost a lady, keeping her one-horse
* and being wife to a carpenter and builder.
Well, MRs. CAPTAIN - -
she insists that I should call her, and I do so, for it, pleases her warm
and affectionate nature, came to stop for a few weeks, on the occasion
of our darling ALBERT's birth, anno domini 1842; and the child and its
mother being delicate, MRs. CAPTAIN B. staid to nurse them both,
and so has remained with us, occupying the room which used to be my
study, and dressing-room ever since. When she came to us, we may
be said to have moved in a humble sphere, viz., in Bernard Street,
Foundling Hospital, which we left four years ago, for our present
residence, Stucco Gardens, Pocklington Square. And up to the period
of MRs. CAPTAIN B.'s arrival, we were, as I say, waited upon in, the
parlour by maids, the rough below-stairs’ work, of knife, and shoe-
cleaning, #: done by GRUNDSELL, our greengrocer's third son.
But, though Heaven forbid that I should say a word against my
mother-in-law, who has a handsome sum to leave, and who is besides a
woman all self-denial, with her every thought for our good: yet, I think
that, without Mamma, my wife would not have had those tantrums, may
I call them of jealousy, which she never exhibited previously, and which
she certainly began to show very soon after our dear little scapegrace
of an ALBERT was born. We had at that time, I remember, a parlour
servant, called EMMA Buck, who came to us from the country, from
a Doctor of Divinity’s family, and who pleased my wife very well at
first, as indeed she did all in her power to please her. But on the very
day ANNA MARIA, came down stairs, to the drawing-room, bein
brought down in these very arms, which I swear belong to as faithfu
a husband as any in the City of London, and EMMA bringing up her
little bit of dinner on a tray, I observed ANNA MARIA’s eyes look un-
common savage at the poor girl, MRs. CAPTAIN B. looking away the
whole time, on to whose neck my wiſe plunged herself as soon as the
girl had left the room; bursting out into tears, and calling somebody
a viper.
“Hullo!” says I, “my beloved, what is the matter? Where's the b

might be, with a pleasantry). “Who is the serpent P”

shoulder, and MRs. CAPTAIN B. scowling sadly at me over her daughter.

the club, indeed! Wasn't I forbidden to see ANNA MARIA P Wasn't
I turned away, a hundred times from my wife's door by Mamma
herself, and could I sit alone in the dining-room, (for my eldest two, a
boy and girl, were at school,)—alone in the dining-room, where that
very EMMA would have had to wait upon me!
Not one morsel of chicken would ANNA MARIA eat. (She said she
dared to say that woman would poison the egg-sauce.) She had hys-
terical laughter and tears, and was in a highly nervous state, a state as
dangerous for the mother as for the darling baby, MRs. CAPTAIN B.
remarked .# ; and I was of course a good deal alarmed, and sent, or
rather went off, for BokER, our medical man. BokER saw his interest:
ing patient, said that her merves were highly excited, that she must at all
sacrifices be kept quiet, and corroborated MRs. CAPTAIN B.'s opinion in
every particular. As we walked down stairs I gave him a hint of what
was the matter, at the same time requesting him to step into the back-
Fº and there see me take an affidavit that I was as innocent as the
\lessed baby just born, and named but three days before after his Royal
Highness the Prince.
. “I know, I know my good fellow,” says BoKER, poking me in the
side, (for he has a good deal of fun,) “that you are innocent. Of course
you are innocent. Everybody is, you sly dog. But what of that? The
two women have taken it into their heads to be jealous of your maid—and
an uncommonly pretty girl she is too, Hobson, you sly rogue, you. And
were she a Westal Virgin, the girl must go if you want to have any

peace in the house; if you want your wife and the little one to thrive
—if you want to have a quiet house and family. And if you do,”
says BoKER, looking me in the face hard, “though it is against my
own interest, will you let me give you a bit of advice, old boy?”
We had been bred up at Merchant Tailors’ together, and had licked
each other often and often, so of course I let him speak. -
“Well then,” says he, “HoB, my boy, get rid of the old dragon—
the old Mother-in-law. She meddles with my prescriptions for your
wife; she doctors the infant in private : you .. never have a quiet
house or a quiet wife as long as that old Catamaran is here.”
“BoKER,” says I, “MRs. CAPTAIN BUDGE is a lady who must not
at least in whouse be called a Catamaran. She has seven thousand
pounds in the funds, and always says ANNA MARIA is her favourite
daughter.” And so we parted, not on the best of terms, for I did not
like Mamma to be spoken of disrespectfully by any man.
What was the upshot of this? When Mamma heard from ANNA
MARIA (who weakly told her what I had let slip laughing, and in con-
fidence to my wife) that BoKER had called her a Catamaran, of course
she went up to pack her trunks, and of course we apologised, and took
another medical man. And as for EMMA Buck, there was nothing for
it but that she, poor girl, should go to the right about; my ºil.
EMILY, then a child of ten years of age, crying bitterly at parting with
her. The child very nearly got me into a second scrape, for I gave her
a sovereign to give to EMMA, and she told her Grandmamma; who
would have related all to ANNA MARIA, but that I went down on my
knees, and begged her not. But she had me in her power after that,
and made me wince when she would say, “MARMADUKE, have you any
sovereigns to give away ?” &c.
After EMMA BUCK came MARY BLACKMoRE, whose name I remember
because MRs. CAPTAIN B. called her MARY BIACKYMORE (and a dark,
swarthy girl she was, not at all good-looking in my eyes). This poor
MARY BLACKMORE was sent about her business because she looked
sweet on the twopenny postman, Mamma said. And she knew, no
doubt, for (my wife being down stairs again long since) MRs. B. saw
everything that was passing at the door, as she regularly sate in the
parlour window.
Aſter BLACKMoRE, came another girl of MRs. B.'s own choosing:
own rearing I may say, for she was named BARBARA, after Mamma,
eing a soldier's daughter, and conſing from Portsea, where the
late CAPTAIN BUDGE was quartered, in command of his company of
|Marines. Of this girl MRs. B. would ask questions out of the Catechism

her blundering answers. But from a demure country lass, as she was when
she came to us, Miss BARBARA very quickly became a dressy impudent-

tuated
“MARMADuke,” MRs. CAPTAIN B. said to me one morning, after this
GRIzzEL had brought me an oniony knife to cut the bread; “women-
servants are very well in their way, but there is always something
disagreeable with them, and, in families of a certain rank, a man-servant
commonly waits at table. it is proper: it is decent that it should be so
in the respec: able classes: and we are of those classes. In CAPTAIN
BUDGE's lifetime we were never without our groom, and our tea-boy.
My dear father had his butler and coachman, as our family has had ever
since the conquest; and though you are certainly in business, as your
father was before you, yet your relations are respectable: your grand-
father was a dignified clergyman in the west of England; you have
connections both in the army and navy, who are members of Clubs, and
known in the fashionable world; and, (though I never shall speak to
that man again,) remember that your wife's sister is married to a
barrister, who lives in Oxford Square, and goes the Western Circuit.
He keeps a man-servant. They keep men-servants, and I do not like to
see my poor ANNA MARIA occupying an inferior position in society to
her sister FREDERICA, named after the Duke of York though she
was, when His Royal Highness reviewed the Marines at Chaham; and
seeing some empty bottles carried from the table, said x-
“In mercy's name,” says I, bursting out, for when she came to this
story Mamma used to drive me frantic, “have a man, if you like, Ma'am,
and give me a little peace.”
“You needn’t swear, MR. Hobson,” she replied with a toss of her
head; and when I went to business that day it was decided by the
women that our livery should be set up.
A SMASH AMONG THE PROTECTIONISTS.
THE Protectionists are everywhere meeting, but they are nowhere
meeting with the success or sympathy they desire. In several instances
the accounts of their gatherings are headed with the ominous words
“Protectionist Failure,” and in many cases the reports of their speeches
are seasoned with interpolations, far more “spicy” than complimentary.
At Salisbury, the other day, the first cry that assailed the ears of the
tters up of the “Protectionist” meeting was, “Three cheers for
IRROBERT PEEL!” and the chairman, LoRD NELson, took his place
amidst “much confusion and riot.” His speech was interspersed with
allusions to the price of corn, which were met with volleys of “chaff.”
from his auditors, and his eloquence, as the report tells us, was cut
short by about “twenty fights taking place simultaneously” in all
parts of the building.
The next speaker was a MR. R. P. Long, whose oration was punc-
or rather brought to a series of stops, by cries of “Murder!”
and "Police !” which may be compared to so many commas, semicolons,
and colons, with which his harangue was dotted, until it wound up
with a crash of windows, and a volley of stones and groans, which put
a full stop and furnished a note of exclamation to his discourse.
We are disposed, nevertheless, to patronise the Protectionist Dinners,
for two reasons; first, because the failure of the business part of the
affair will in time convince the parties of the weakness of their cause;
and secondly, because good cheer is of itself a good thing; and, in the
case of the Trish farmers especially, the banquets may relieve some of
*: from that “lean and hungry look” which has so long disfigured

THE CATERPILLAR AND THE BUTTERFLY.
(A FABLE.)
THE caterpillars, when one of their number, having been laid up as a
chrysalis, arose as a butterfly, leaving his case behind him, used for-
merly to gather up the exuviae, and deposit them in the earth with a
prodigious deal of ostentation and pageantry. At length, however,
once upon a time, one of the caterpillars climbed up a rose-tree into
the light of the Sun, when a butterfly that he had known in the
creeping state came to sip honey from the roses. The caterpillar
related to the butterfly with what splendour and magnificence the
chrysalis shell, which he had left behind him, had been interred.
Whereupon the butterfly, smiling, answered that he dared say that the
caterpillars meant well by what they had done, but that the honours
that had been paid his old case had given no satisfaction to him, for,
being now a butterfly, he cared no longer for the mere covering he had
lived in, and regarded it as nothing but a worn-out, cast-off suit. So,
after this, the caterpillars put the chrysalis-cases into the earth without
parade or unnecessary ceremony.
The spirit that ascends has no concern with the senseless relics which
it leaves below. Cease to accompany funerals with absurd and expensive
mummery.

destructiveness to linen in one week, than Joseph Ady writes in a

would publish more, but that we have too many irons in the fire to be

CHIT-CHAT BY TELEGRAPH.
ET us express the great delight with which
we learn that “the right to establish an
electric telegraph line between France
and ..". a sub-marine communi-
cation across the Channel,”, has been offi-
cially conceded. By the aid of a single
wire, and of two persons only—one in
France and one in England—a message of
fifteen words, including address and signa-
ture, may be delivered in one minute!
These wires will, of course, communicate,
viá South-Eastern and Boulogne railways,
with either capital: thus London and Paris
may, when they will, gossip with one
another. The amenities produced between
the two countries, by this practice, must
be of the most rapid growth and of the
widest influence. Let us give a few ex-
amples of the probable questions and answers put and answered by
parties, high and low, of both kingdoms:-

Woman, indeed Want—well, I want—but you know what I want.
How can I tell? Now, this is the last time.

. These are a very few, and very meagre, samples of the international
information that will tremble along the wires through the domain of
NEPTUNE; who, by the way, according to the song, once tried Wul-
CAN’s thunder, but afterwards—it being of no use to himself—made a
present of the bolts to BRITANNIA. However NEPTUNE may have
failed with the , thunder, there is little doubt that he will succeed
admirably with the lightning.
THE THREATENED INUNDATION.
THE alarmists of the public press succeeded, about a week ago, in
throwing us into a state of the most horrible consternation, at the
prospect of Father Thames being about to take a sort of Saturnine
turn, and gobble up a number of his children. We were told that his
swelling bosom was shortly to give way with a terrific burst of Nature;
and those who did not consider themselves born to be hanged, began to
prepare very seriously for the popular alternative of drowning.
In the kitchens south of the river's banks, washing-tubs had been
launched, and tin foot-pans were lying at anchor, with a view to the
riding out of the inundation had it taken place; and clothes-horses
were in readiness to enable the inhabitants of a house to mount the
high-horse in the event of such a mode of self-preservation having
been required. The kitchen-dressers had been laid out as a reef of
rocks, : small articles could be deposited high and dry, instead of
being left to take their chance on the ground, and every prudent house-
maid stowed away the contents of her work-basket.
To the relief of the expected Noyades and the discomfiture of the
penny-a-liners, the inundation did not come off, and the whole thing
remained almost as imaginary as a theatrical overflow. When we last
made our enquiry on the subject, Father Thames was reported to be
confined to his bed, where he is expected to remain for the present.

WE may well say “Odd Rat it,” when we hear how much better they
still manage some things in France, for we find the scavengers of Paris
have lately been dining together, to celebrate the destruction of 600,000

enter into a treaty to exterminate the rats, and we ourselves would see
it properly ratified. Mort aur rats was, one of the toasts, at the

THE past looms dark behind us, the future rises fair,
Though ne'er so bleak the shore we seek, across this waste of waters;
Hard step-mother, O England, and niggard of thy care,
Still hast thou been, great Island Queen, to us thy hapless daughters!
As to the vessel's side we throng to look our last at thee,
Each sunken eye is dead and dry—what cause have we for weeping?
We leave no homes behind us, no household ties had we;
In one long coil of heavy toil our hours went creeping—creeping.
We hawked about thy stony streets what skill we could command;
For work we prayed, if so but bread might to our need be granted;
And in a wolfish struggle each wan and wasted hand
Clutched at the pay, that waned each day as waxed the crowd that
wanted.
And so we strove with straining eyes, in squalid rooms, and chill;
The needle plied until we died—or worse—oh, Heaven, have pity!—
Thou knowest how ’twas oftener for want we sinned, than will—
Oh, nights of pain and shameful gain, about the darkling city'

Body and soul we gave for food, nor yet could we be fed; .
Blear-eyed or blind, we pored and pined, and battled like our

And the city roared about us, and over each weak head
Washed the wild waves, till in our graves we rested from our labours.
Till came among us eyes and pens, and to a wondering world,
That gathered pale to hear the tale, revealed in part our story;
Then hopes from out the darkness were on sad eyes unfurled,
To those whose aid our suffering stayed be honour and be glory.
Now speed thee, good ship, over sea, and bear us far away,
Where food to eat, and friends to greet, and work to do await us–
Where against hunger's tempting we shall not need to pray-
Where in wedlock's tie, not harlotry, we shall find men to mate us.
Lift up your hearts, my sisters! and to the fresh sea air,
Oh wan and weak, give each pale cheek, till it forget its sorrow :
Our yesterdays were gloomy—but our to-day is bright and fair-
And loving powers will guide the hours of our uncertain morrow.

gone through its last day on Friday, December 28th, it gave a convulsive

he “last scene of all” was marked by rather an affecting in-
cident, for when the judge, retired to his robing-room, he was
followed by the attorneys, who expressed a wish to present him
with a testimonial. -
His Honour, having consented to receive the proffered compliment,
found a sheet of paper thrust into his hands, with the thanks of the
attorneys inscribed upon it in fine bold text characters. , Whether the
testimonial was exact 3. the kind of thing his Honour had expected, we
cannot tell, but he folded it to his bosom—or, in other words, placed it
in his breast-pocket. He declared in a sad tone of voice that he had
always tried to hold the scales of Justice with an even hand, however
odd the proceedings of the Court may have appeared to the public in
neral. The usher went through the process of breaking his wand in
imitation of Prospero, as a sort of farewell to his prosperity. The
office-keeper, being unable any longer to keep his office, drew down the
blind, raked out the fire, shut the door with a slam, and strewed some

THE BRANDY AND WATER FISHERIES.
THESE Fisheries are the most abundant in the Parks...The plan
of fishing is very simple. . You venture on the ice with a pair
of skates, and where the ice is thinnest, of course you go in. You cut
a flounder or two with your skates, and after going to the bottom, just
to feel, your footing, you come to the surface, where you find, a rope
presented to you. This you accept with all the warmth possible, and
at the end you will find in your hands a glass of warm brandy-and-
water. The best fishing is in Hyde Park, for there they give you the
best brandy, and the least water. . The Regent's Park preserve is not
so good; and it has been found necessary to plant on the ice large
placards, marked-

so as to warn enthusiasts from being taken in. A whisky fishery has
lately been started in St. James's Park, but it has been described as
very weak, and not at all equal to the current of “warm within,” that
flows through the famous Serpentine.
“Look on this Picture” if you can.
IT is said that one of the pictures in the Vermon Gallery has sustained
a slight injury at the hands of the artist employed to copy it. The ex-

having been done to a picture in the hole appropriated to the Vernon

“SEAson your admiration for a while,” readers. No Court in Fleet
Street has become the Court of Pius THE NINTH... As yet the Roman
Pontiff has not sought an asylum over the way. His Holiness of Fleet
Street is a Protestant; nevertheless, he is every inch a º: :-nay, several
inches more of a Pope than the great HILDEBRAND. For he is the founder
of his own Popedom; not being in the least indebted for the same to the
FisherMAN; and he will prescribe your ſaith by his mere ipse dirit,
independently of Scripture, or tradition either. This plus-quam-papal
Protestant Pope is the Editor of the Record. -
4. His Holiness of Fleet Street published, the other day, a letter signed
“ENQUIRER,” signifying that a series of readings ſrom SHAKSPEARE,
commencing with “Macbeth.” and “Othelio,” was about to be given at
Exeter Hall, and demanding whether it was “as a sort of preparatory
school to Drury Lane” that the building in question was founded?
To this was appended, in the shape of a note, the following pontifical
rescript:—
.. have been considered profane (considering the usual characters of the
performers, and the spirit of the majority of the listeners) by some of the choicest Divines
this country has produced. Miscellaneous Concerts, it has generally been conceded by
Scripturally enlightened persons, breathemuch more of the spirit of the world than of the
Gospel. They constitute common ground where infinite mischief is done. These have
* become apparently the staple subjects of profit to the shareholders of Exeter
Hall. Now we have readings of Othello. Proceeding steadily in this downward career,

a good theatre. It seems full-time for the proprietors to consider whither they are
bound.—EdrroB.]”
Fearless of the thunders of the Fleet Street Watican, we protest
against the above allocution. If the first sentence of that document
has any meaning, it is a gross and unchari'able insinuation against both
the singers and the audience at the Sacred Harmonic Society's perform-
ances. Here is a pretty Pope, without any º: of the keys, except
that by which he unlocks the floodgates of calumny! ....."
The next ensuing papal position is not very clear; for, if Miscellaneous
Concerts “breathe much more of the spirit of the world than of the
|
|
Gospel,” they must breathe some of the latter; and how can that be, if
even Oratorios themselves are profane f : No doubt, however, it is

on this point,

The “Scripturally enlightened” may be aware that this authentic
tale is figuraſive. Possibly they may know who is meant by the Father
that is mentioned in it. Will § presume to say that. He who related
it would, if music—even dancing music—were in itself evil, have
represented it as bearing a correspondence to anything of that Father's
institution? -
Let us return to our Bull. - -
Having denounced music, it could be only expected that our Pontiff
should anathema'ise dramafic reading. Yet a better authority than his
Holiness, who once lived in Bolt Court close by him—DR. Johnson–
wrote a play, and went to seei in a red coat. Under the papal favour we
submit that there is occasionally a deal of bigoted raving in Exeter Hall,
to which the mostranting recitations from Othello would be infinitely pre-
ferable; and that the career which tends from STIGGINs to SHAKSPEARE
is the reverse of downward. Although Miscellaneous Concerts were
even very sinful, they might still be less wicked than fanatical howling.

JENKINS AND MRS. MOWATT.
MR. JENKINs, last week, favoured the limited world in which he
moves with a notice of the first º of MRs. Mowatt's
comedy, Fashion; or, Life in New York, a play which, according to the
Times, “has been acted with success at º chief city in the Union,”
and was received at our Olympic here with “tumultuous applause.”
“It may,” says JENKINs,
“By some weak persons be thought ungenerous in us, when speaking of the production
of a lady and a stranger, we employ any language that is not highly complimentary;
but genius is of no sex.”
And then JENKINs proceeds to abuse the lady and stranger's play,
elaborately, in every particular, with all his mighty soul and gigantic
strength. For the dead set that he thus makes, he must of course have
a motive, which, had he limited himself to strictures on the production
itself, might possibly have been supposed to be a no meaner one than
an excess of critical zeal. But, MR. JENKINS not content with yelping
at the play, must needs have a snap at the authoress. “When the
actors,” writes gently-sneering JENKINs,
“Had indulged us with another glance at their persons, a very general call from all
parts of the house brought Mns. Mowatt on the stage. The noise was then tremendous,
and the shower of customary bouquets more weighty and continuous than we ever re-
member it to have been. The affair was a little overdone, for not only were the flowers
provided too profusely, but the lady, in our eyes, appeared to be ready dressed for the
occasion.”
Why could you not have moderated the rancour of your pen a little,
JENKINs P Why attack the lady and stranger personally * Is it your
individual self or your order – JENKINs or Flunkeydom-that
MRs. MowATT has offended? - - - - - -
JENKINs, you say, that “genius is of no sex.” Neither is criticism,
as personified by you. At any rate it is not manly.
HOBSON'S CHOICE,
OR THE PERPLExit IES OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH CF A SERVANT.
ETER, GRUNDSELL, the knife-boy, the
youth previously mentioned as son
of my green-grocer and occasional
butler, a demure little fair-haired lad,
who had received his education in a
green baize coat and yellow leather
breeches at Saint Blaize's Charity
School, was our first ſoot-boy or page.
Mamma thought that a full-sized
footman mightoccasion inconvenience
in the house, and would not be able
to sleep in our back attic (which in-
deed was scarcely six feet long), and
she had somehow conceived a great
fondness for this youth, with his pale
cheeks, blue eyes, and yellow hair,
who sang the sweetest of all the
children in the organ-loſt of Saint
Blaze's. At five o’clock every morn-
ing, winter and summer, that boy,
before he took a permanent engage-
ment in my establishment, slid down
our area-steps, of which and of the
kitchen entrance he was entrusted
with the key. He crept up the stairs
as silent as a cat, and carried off
- the boots and shoes from the doors
of . our respective apartments without dis'urbing one of us: the
knives and shoes of my domesic circle, were cleaned as brilliant as
possible before six o'clock: he did odd jobs for the cook, he went upon
our, messages and errands; he carried out his father’s potatoes and
cauliflowers; he attended school at Saint Blaizº's; he turned his
mother's mangle:—there was no end to the work that boy could do in
the course of a day, and he was the most active, quiet, humble little
§º. ever knew. MRs. CAPTAIN BUDGE then took a just liking to
the lad, and resolved to promote him to the situation of page. His name
was changed from PETER to PHILIP, as being more genteel: and a hat
with a gold cord and a knob on the top like a gilt Brussels sprout, and
a dark, green suit, with a white galloon stripe down the trowser-seams,
and a bushel of buttons on the jacket, were purchased at an establish.
ment in Holborn, off the dummy at the door. Mamma is a great big
strong woman, with a high spirit, who I should think could protect
Merselſ very well; but when PHILIP had his livery, she made him walk
behind her regularly, and never could go to church without Philip
after her to carry the books, or out to tea of an evening, without that
boy on the box of the cab.
. MRs. CAPTAIN B. is fond of good living herself; and, to do her
ustice, always kept our servants well. I don't meddle with the
itchen affairs myself, having my own business to attend: but I believe
my servants had as much meat as they could eat, and a great deal more
than was good for them. They went to bed pretty soon, ſor ours was
an early house, and when I came in from the É. after business, I was
glad enough to get to bed; and they got up rather late, for we are all
good sleepers (especially MRs. B., who takes a heavy supper, which I
never could indulge in), so that they were never called upon to leave
their beds much before seven o'clock, and had their eight or nine good
hours of rest every might. -
And here, I cannot help remarking, that if these folks knew their
luck; sua si bona nárint, as we used to say at Merchant Tailors'; if they
remembered that they are fed as well as lords, that they have warm
beds and plenty of sleep in them; that, if they are ill, they have
frequently their master’s doctor; that they get good wages, and beer,
and sugar and tea in sufficiency: they need not be robbing their
employers, or taking fees, ſrom tradesmen, or grumbling at their lot.
My fi iend and head-clerk, RADDLEs, has a hundred and twenty a
year, and eight children; the REveREND MR. BITTLEs, our esteemed
curate at Saint Blaize's,has the same stipend and family of three; and
I am sure that both of those gentlemen work harder, and fare worse,
than any of the servants in my kitchen, or my neighbour's. And I,

Magnolia Road South, Camden Town,) on º walks from Hampste
of a Sunday evening:-I say, who have seen these people, and thought
about my servants at home, on the same July evening, eating buttered
toast round the kitchen fire—have marvelled how resigned and con-
tented some people were, and how readily other people grumbled.
Well then, this young PHILIP being introduced into my family, and
being at that F. as lean as a º. and as contented with
the scraps and broken victuals which the cook gave him, as an alderman
with his turtle and yenison, now left his mother's, mangle, on which,
or on a sack in his father's potato bin he used to sleep, and put on my
buttons and stripes, waited at my own table, and took his regular place
at that in the kitchen, and occupied a warm bed and three blankets in
the back attic.
The effect of the three (or four or five, is it?—for the deuce knows how
many they take,) meals a day upon the young rascal, was speedily evident
in his personal sº is lean cheeks began to fill out, till they
grew as round and pale as a pair of suet dumplings. His dress (for the
little dummy in Holborn, a bargain of MRs. CAPTAIN B's., was always
a tight fit.) grew tighter and tighter—as if his meals in the kitchen were
not sufficient for any two Christians; the little gormandiser levied con-
tributions upon our parlour dishes. And one day my wiſe spied him
with his mouth smeared all over with our jam pudding; and on another
occasion he came in with tears in his eyes and hardly able to speak,
from the effects of a curry on which he had laid hands in the hall, and
which we make (from the Nawobb of Mulligatawney's own receipt) re-
markably fine, and as hot, as hot—as the dog-days. -
As for the crockery, both the common blue and the stone china
Mamma gave us on our marriage, (and which I must confess I didn't
mind seeing an end of, because she bragged and bothered so about it,)
the smashes that boy made were incredible. . The handles of all the tea:
cups went ; and the knobs off the covers of the vegetable dishes; and
the stems of the wine-glasses; and the china punch-bowl my ANNA

on the table; he spilt the gravy on the cloth; Lord! Lord! how, I did
wish for my pretty meat little parlour-maid again. But I had best
not, for peace' sake, *: again upon that point. , . -
And as for getting up, I suppose the suppers and dinners made him
sleepy as well as fat; certainly the little rascal for the first week did get
up at his usual hour: then he was a little later; at the end of a month
he came yawning down stairs after the maids had long been at work:
there was no more polishing of boo's and knives: barely time to get
mine clean, and knives enough ready for me and my wife's breakfast
(MRs. CAPTAIN B. taking hers and her poached º: rashers of bacon
§ bed), in time enough, I say, for my breakfast, before I went into the
ity.
Many and many a scolding did I give that boy, until my temper

At last there came a crash, which, though it wasn't in my crackery, did Master

—MasTER PHILIP, mimicking her to the women servants, and saying, “Look, this
is the way old Mother Budge goes!” And, pullinganapkin round his head (some-
thing like the Turkish turban MRs. Captain B.. wears), he began to speak as
if in her way, saying, “Now, PHILIP, you masty, idle, good-for-nothing, lazy, dirty
boy you, why do you go for to spill the gravy so?” &c.
Mrs. B. rushed forward and boxed his ears soundly, and the next day he was sent
about his business: for flesh and blood could bear him no longer.
Why, he had been kept so long, as I said before, I could not comprehend,
until after PHILIP had left us: and then Mamma said, looking with tears in her
eyes at the chap's jacket, as it lay in the pantry, that her little boy Augustus was
something like him, and that he wore a jacket wi h buttons of that sort. Then I

HAMPTON COURT HOSPITAL.
THE existence of this charitable institution is not, perhaps, generally known. It
forms a considerable portion of Hampton Court Palace, and, together with the
remainder of that establishment, is supported wholly by involuntary cºntributions
or taxes, which, according to a statement recently made by MR. W. WILLIAMs,
late M.P. for Coventry, amount to £7,000 per annum. The objects of this valuable
charity are the decayed members of that large but necessitous and deserving class,
the aristocracy of this country, who are therein provided with a comfortable asylum,
secure from the contamination of inferior pampers. It has, however, perhaps not
without some show of reason, been alleged that a potion of the benefits of this
State Hospital might as well be extended to a few of those who, or whose relatives,
have done the state some service; and if this view should be adopted, the destitute
widow of LIEUTENANT Wagnoºn may be considered a worthy candidate for
admission to begin with.
A very Raw MATERIAL-M.R. DisrAELI says that the land is the landlord’s
raw material; and soil is. But landlords have a much rawer material in the minds
of those farmers whom they delude into continuing to pay excessive rents under the
fallacious hope of a re-enactment of the Corn-Laws.

It's MR Jones, who is in the City, and has always come
with me to draw my dividends; and he said he would meet
me here to-day, at two; but the horrid cabman would get
into a stoppage, and it’s past three, and I don’t see him;
and I’ve got all my papers here; and if you please, do you
think they’d give me the money? and where am i to go?

HALVING THE CENTURY.
Fºr- UST mow our table
) is cracking and
groaning under a
heap of letters on
bo'h sides of the
controversy about
the completion of
the first half of
the century. One
correspondent il-
º: his Y.
y proposing that
| we should drink
the half of a hun-
dred barrels of
stout in as many
years, and informs
us that half the
hundred barrels
will have been
drunk so soon,
but only so soon
as the last pot of
the fiftieth barrel shall have been swallowed. Our only objection to
this mode of deternining the question is, that he has not sent us
the means of trying his experiment. We may apply similar observa-
itions to the propositions of those who ask us to smoke so many bundles
of cigars, eat so much cheese, and wear out so many suits of clothes in
|half a century. The quantities of these articles are represented as
given quantities, but all we can say is, that we have not received any
of them. As to the matter in dispute, we need only remark, that if
the year 1800 was the first year of the century, 1801 was the second
year, 1849 the fiftieth, and the present year of grace, 1850, is the filty-
first. If not, then otherwise. To us, the question would seem, per-
fectly clear, but for the following communication, which, being brief,
we publish in eartenso:—
“MR. Punch, .
“My cousin BRIDGET, to my knowledge, was born on January
1, 1800. . If we are now begiºning the second half of the century, she
must just have entered her fifty-first year. Yet a lady's word is unde-
º: and all who have been acquainted with BIDDY for the last 20

only thirty.

Rogues in Grain.
A CoRREspospent of the Times says, with reference to “Servan's'
Poundage,” “I know of one corn-dealer who invariably sends to his
west-end customers three and three quarters for four bushels in every
sack.” If we were so treated by our coin-dealer through the
connivance of our groom, we would send the former his corn back again,
and give the latter the sack.

“The Alderman said, he, of course, could not take the evidence of a creature
who knew nothing whateverofthe obligation to tell the truth."—wide Times' Police
Report of Wednesday, Jan.9.
So, says the law, which the Alderman has to administer. But
- are not these a conversation and a result worth noting, good §
e
of this wonderful time of Railways, Rºgged Schools,
Lodging-houses, Soup-kitchens, Model Prisons, and other excellent
crutches for helping along this society of ours, which still stumbles
somehow, most sadly, in spite of them?
Here is the raw material of a citizen—a boy well half way to
manhood, who knows neither oath, nor book, nor prayer, nor God;
has but heard of the Devil even—and whose sum and substance of
knowledge is “how to º crossing—that's all.” A crossing-
sweeping machine this, with a º soul in it apparently,
—that no man, or set of men, has thought it worth while to waken
-a tongue that the law ties—a sort of brute biped in the eyes of
all-who, introduced to a worthy Alderman and apolice court, sud.
denly hears of the oddest things, oaths, and books, and prayer, and
God, and Devil—ideas which had not developed themselves in
crossing-sweeping.
But though Society leave this lump of Man to his besom and
his blank ignorance of right and wrong, and the powers thereof.-
and though Law, when he rises to say what he has seen—for he can
speak-says to him, “No! Be dumb, brute, how should'st thou
lift up thy voice among men?”—this same Society and Law would
use a very different tone, if once our brute biped should begin to
develop himself brute fashion—if he should strike orbite—or kick,
or take to satisfy his hunger—to prey, in short, wild-beast-like on
the world in which he is as a wild beast. Then Society would be
alert with its policemen, and committing magistrates and cells-
and Law with its judges and juries, and learned barristers, all
arrayed to deal justice upon this poor neglected brute, as if he
were a man. - - -
A strange sight and one worthy of being weighed in these
times above all others. Our bluntancestors went roundly to work.
If they saw without concern brute men gathering and growing
about them, they flogged, and imprisoned, and ironed and racked,
and hung, with right royal brutality of punishment. But now we
have changed the laſter half of their system, while we leave the
former unaltered. While the animal sleeps, we let him sleep. But
once let him wake to show the animal in act, and we make a man
of him. His cage must be comfortable, - with. "a regard
shown to his feelings”—his diet must be varied and suc-
culent—he must have sweet air º cleanliness—and all,
in ſac", that was denied him till the brute propensities awoke to
active life!
If any painter of our new Houses of Parliament want an allegory
for our Great Britain, we give him this-
Let him paint a great tree with a worm at the root; with
healthy boughs and withered; with fine fruit, and sickly; here
blossom, and there blight; and Benevolence, and Piety, and States.

carefully nursing a dwarfed flower on that; and the crowd round
about clapping their hands and applauding the mighty work of
improvement; and all the while, a new scabby fruit, and a new
defective, flower, appearing for each that is nipped off, or nursed
into sickly comeliness; and a few poor timid spectators hinting
that, º this work about fruit and blossom, is vain, while
something must be wrong with the roots;” and nobody
listening to them—and the worm working and working towards
the heart of the tree, and “very general satisfaction with our

LONDON CHARIVARI.
ALL THE TOWN'S A SLIDE.
(A Parody for the Frost.)
ALL the town’s a slide,
And all the men and women merely skaters.
They have their slippings and their flounderings,
And one man in his life has many ſals : . .
His fate having seven stages. At first, the infant,
Shivering and shaking in his nurse's arms; , .
And then the shuffling school-boy, with his highlows
and hobnailed sole and heel, cutting-out slides
Instead of going to school...And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, till with woeful tumble
He and his mistress lie low. Then a soldier,"
Wearing odd skates, and bearding all the park;
Jealous of others, sudden and quick in turning,
Seeking the bubble reputation -
Even in the deepest holes. And then the iceman
In fair round hat, with a good cape on, lined
With oilskin clear, and coat of formal cut,
Full of ice-saws and modern instruments; .
And so he plays his part. The sixth stage slips
Into the lean and slippery pantaloon,
With icicle on nose, and stick in hand,
His India-rubber shoes a world too large.
For his shrunk feet; and his poor trembling knees
Straggling apart like childish helplessness,
He tumbles on the ground! last scene of all
That ends this cold and frosty history
Is a sharp wind-upsetting everyone, "
Sans stick, sans cloak, sans hat, sans everything.
HORRIBLE EFFECT OF THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS,
Such is the influence of evil example, that we shall be having our
doll-makers taking their models from the assemblage of waxen horrors
in Baker Street. Men are but children of a larger growth, and if full-
sized people can be amused by murderers got up as mere dolls the size
of life, it is to be expected that the smaller fry will take delight in
having, as puppets to amuse their play hours, the miniature repre-
:* of those atrocious monsters in whom their parents take an
interest.
The very prospect of such a profanation of one of the most pleasing
instincts of º irlhood—alove of dolls—is sufficient to inspire us with
a determination : put down, a nuisance, which is badenough when it
corrupts the taste of our elders, but which becomes ten times more

The Bath and Wash-house for Old Masters.
A gºat deal has been said both for and against the picture-cleaning
at the National Gallery. It seems undeniable that the cleaning of the
ºldmasters brings out their tints, but unfortunately, with such strength
as to lay bare their canvas.
THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE BRITISH STAGE.
New characer has lately sprung up into the pantomimic
sphere. He is—as little boys should be—seen, but not
heard. His name is the Sprite. All his talent is con-
centrated in his body, arms, and legs. He is kicked
about, thrown about, tumbled, twisted, and turned
about in all possible and impossible directions. One
moment he is a wheelbarrow—the next he is a human
cracker, bounding across the stage, and ultimately dis-
appearing through a chemis's window. He prefers
walking on his hands to his feet. His skin is mostly
greer, when not red—but if it is not red, then it is
mostly green with red stripes. His head is sometimes
furnished with a pair of crimson horns, and his eyes,
when he winks and ogles at the gallery, are not
*...* to look at, though generally rewarded with
a loud cry of “Brayvo!”
The Sprite is on familiar terms with the Clown and Pantaloon, and
allows them to take what liberties they please with him. He is open to
all sorts of blows, smacks, and insults, and only skips and tumbles the
merrier for them. The more he is kicked, the better heisnleased, and
he rarely leaves the stage without some bodily affront. He respects,
however, the Columbine, excepting in the first scene after the changes,
when he joins hands with her without any pride, previous to falling flat
upon his face with Clawn and Pantaloon, by express order of Harlequin's
wand. But it is in the last scene where he is the grandest. Look for
him in the final “Bower of Sugar Candy,”
and you will see him on his head, standing on
the topmost bar of the glittering cage of
wickerwork. He is the crowning glory of the
evening. If there is a “Cataract of a Thou-
sand Bottles of Champagne,” wherewith to
send every one home madly intoxicated with
the evening's Pantomime, you will behold the
Sprite dangling by his feet in an ocean of blue
fire, kissing his hands extatically to the pit.
The Sprite is proud of his high position, and
he has one great virtue, which many a Clown
might borrow. from him, with advantage—he never talks. There is
another p-culiar merit about his caoutchouc performances; and that
is, like Boxing-Day, he only comes once a year. It is especially for
this rare merit that we rank the Sprite far higher on the English
Stage than many other performers whom we could mention. The Sprite
has so identified himself, body and bones, with the British Stage, and
has obtained so firm a hold round the necks of Clown, Pantaloon, and
the British Public, that nothing short of the total annihilation of George
Barnwell, or the sudden conflagration of all the copies in the world of
Jane Shore, can possibly kick him off those boards that have been so
nobly trod by GRIMALDI, and still feel the stupendous stamp of Tom
Mathews.
CORN AND CROWN.
THE existence of the Monarchy is to depend upon the re-enactment
of the Corn Laws. QUEEN Victoria's Crown is to be secured in the
sack of Protection or—or—but let MR. RoPER, who spoke a day or
two ago, at the Dublin County Meeting, speak the threat for himself-
**Gentlemen," said Ms. Chamueslºop ºn, “if we are to have American prices for
provisions, Time People at Lºgru will have A*saucan Palaza rom Govºnºr.””
And we are told that this observation was received with rapturous
cheering. If corn is to range below 50s, let MR. Swift, the keeper of
the Crown Jewels, look warily to his charge—if Indian cobs come in
duty free, what a blight upon that bed of strawberry-leaves, the House
of Lords! If the landlords do not protect high rents, they will have

HOPE FOR HUDSON.
THE Chronicle, in a very philosophical article on the treatment of
spots and slains, shows how they may be discharged by proper means
—shows how dirt, though inch-thick, will rub off reputations, when the
dirt is well-dried.
“Thus [says the Chronicle, breathing hope to Hudson] in the course of not many years,
by the effect of a prudent silence, and a decorous retirement from observation, a dis-
ſº public man not unfrequently reverses his attainder, and—albeit slightly damaged
the eyes of those who remember the circumstances of his case—if he has courage
enough to put a good face upon the matter, may recover his position.”
Contemplating this sentence, we leaned back in our chair, looking—
as is our wont when in meditation—upward to the ceiling; and there-
upon, in a few seconds, we read, or seemed to read, these lines:
“From the Morning Post, Feb. —, 1860.
“Last night, at least 800 of the beau monde were entertained by GEongr HUDson, Esq.,
who, after a retirement of some years, in consequence of delicate health, though not
indigestion, as generally believed, has again returned to a brilliant and numerous
circle, of which he was in bygone tiime the soul and ornament; and whose long-lamented
absence has thrown occasional gloom over those réunions where (the emotion could not
always be suppressed) some kind voice has whisper'd, “I wish he were here.” We
cannot give a list of the company; suffice it to say, it was composed of the leading stars
of fashion; of all that makes life wise, and , and noble, and brilliant, Dancing
was kept up until a late hour, and the supper was of a most profuse and costly descrip-
tion. We are happy to hear that, called by the unanimous voice of the constituency,
MR. Hudson goes down to stand for Sunderland next week. He will, of course, be
returned with one burst of triumph. By the way, one small incident may speak the |
amiable good-nature of the rich and worthy gentleman. Though much pressed for
time, he has, at the request of the citizens of York, consented to sit for another full-
length, for their Mansion House. Condescension like this is above all comment."
And this was the handwriting on the ceiling with the foreshadowed
- ====
date of 1860.
LONDON MILK AND LONDON WATER.
THE principal difference between London Milk and London Water,
after having been subjected to a careful analysis, appears to be pretty
nearly as follows:–In the case of London Water you expect to find

NELSON'S DAUGHTER.
THE hard frost set in at an unlucky hour. We have it, upon what
we would fain take as authority, that just as certain dignitaries of the
two professions of arms—the field Marshals and the Admirals—had
warmed themselves into a late determination to become the bud of a
Committee to keep NElson's HoRATIA from the patronage of France
—a visitation threatened in loftiest wording by the .. as
the heads of the Navy and Army had resclved to appeal to the English
nation in aid of NEison's daughter, the frost set in—the quicksilver
dropt in the glass, and with it fell the sympathy of Marshals and
Admirals. Like MUNCHAUSEN's trumpet, their spirits were frozen
in their martial bodies.
Otherwise, and had only the frost held off, we should have seen ere
this, the name of the DUKE or WELLINGTON, with the names of all the
Waterloo men, of the men of Trafalgar, shining-shining in a cluster—
like the best of their own blood-bought stars. They would have been
thered together, the lustrous Committee—with power to add to their
rilliants—for the *...* of vindicating the right of NELsoN to the
gratitude of Englishmen; a right, living and beating in the veins of his
child. But just at the moment, the frost as we say, set in, and
Marshals and Admirals, with their fingers prepared for the operation,
could not—they were so cold—unbutton their pockets.
We know that the name of NELson is already chargeable. Excise,
or Customs, or Assessed Taxes, have one of the nibbles out of the
many thousand, at the daily substance of the Englishman, such nibbles
put together, making these º (without a word upon the sum
s
that bought the NElson lands,) thus allotted—
EARL NELson, son of the nephew of ADMIRAL NHLsox ... e2000
Countrss of NELson, wife of the above - - - ... 1000
DowAGEB CountEss, widow of the Admiral's nephew - • 2000
To name of NELson . . 25000
This is a good sum; very handsome salaries enjoyed upon the luck
of alliance with hero's blood heroically shed. As for the Earl Admiral's
brother, who inherited the 'profits of Trafalgar, and bobbed in for the
coronet that missed the dead—he was in heart and soul as much allied
to the sailor, as a barnacle upon the coppers of the Victory was a portion
of her heart of oak. Nevertheless, they took, PARsqn BARNAcLE, and
gilded his simoniacal head with a coronet, and he-keeping, the tenor
of his way—cheated LADY HAMILTON, duly robbing the sailor's child,
NELson's orphan HoRATIA. Whereupon, the PRINCE OF WALES
wrote letters of sympathy that, like all such epistles from his royal
hand, were by no means worth the ink that blotted the paper.
In the meanwhile, HoRATIA's mother dies. The woman to whom
England was indebted for the intelligence that made victory sure—for
it took NELson alongside the French fleet—dies in a corner of Calais,and
with little other than a pauper's funeral—(two Englishwomen clubbed
old silk petticoats to serve for a pall)—was laid in earth, now turned to
a timber-yard. The Parson Earl did not erect a hand’s-breadth of stone.
Yet, to him, stone must have been cheap enough. The man must have
carried a quarry inside of him.
Nevertheless, England is very grateful to the memory of her hero.
England buys a magnificentestate for NELson's black brother: England
dresses the parson as Earl, and gilds him and his successors—and wives
to boot, -inch-thick with the alchemy of the tax-man. d so we
honoured the hero NELson. We honoured him at St. Paul's; and we
honoured him, dressing up a human lay-figure in his name—in the
House of Lords.
And still, we honour NELson in his Trafalgar coat. For is it not to
be seen in a shrine of plate-glass at Greenwich P There it lies, a thing
of daily honour—open to all worshippers.
d do we not honour NELson in the very bullet-in the mortal bit
of lead that deprived HoRATIA of her father, to be exposed by her
father's brother ?...Yes; we do honour even to that bit of mischief,
since associated with the fate of NELson—for only a while ago did not
PRINCE ALBERT receive as a precious gift, that bit of lead; and did he
not—if Court historians write truly—in a very graceful speech, express
. glue of the gift, and his determination to treasure it as a dearest
relic
We honour the Nelson, coat-we honour the Nelson bullet—but
NELson's child, NELSON's living flesh and blood, are not of such value
as moth-eaten woollen, or an ounce of old metal. -
As, however, the Lords of the Admiralty permit the Victory to be
shown, and, as where NELson was shot is marked by an engraved plate
-We ºf: to them the eligibility of cutting a till-slit through the
plank where NELson fell, and placing a money-box below, with another
plate above, thus marked—
* “subscripTIONS FOR HORATIA.”
In this way, Nelson's countrymen, desirous of contributing to a Fund
for Nelson's daughter, wil know in what place to deposit their money.
We do not suggest this without due cause, for, at this moment, we are
beset by a difficulty, having received a subscription for HoRATIA, which
is worded thus:-
“FIVE Pounds FoR HoRATIA FROM An old MAID.”
Now, as the frost has prevented the formation of the Committee, and,
indeed, as the body of Marshals and Admirals may never thaw, to
congenial point again, we know not what to do with the subscription
forwarded by our Correspondent, “An Old Maid,” whose good heart
shows that she deserved the best of husbands, and that husband the
very best of sailors. Any way, we will wait a few days for the probable
formation of the Committee. If, however, the hard frost seems likely
to continue—and if, again, the Lords of the Admiralty will not
comply with our suggestion, by establishing, in default of greater
measures, a subscription-box aboard the Wictory, so that we may forward
the £5 to the fund there to be garnered—then, and with deep regret,
we must return the money to the kind hand that sent it forth upon its
journey of goodness—upon its task of true and gentle sisterhood, to
e further directed where the hand shall it list.
But let us, hope better, both from the Lords of the Admiralty, and
from a genial thaw.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVARI.
'SMOKING THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.
WE are sorry to say, that the City has lately held the Hero of Waterloo
$9 cheap, that London has been, what is vulgarly called, smoking the
Duke with volumes of its celebrated smoke, until every statue of his
Grace has become thoroughly graceless from the quantity of soot by
which it is shrouded. We know that WELLINGTON swept everything
before him on the Continent, but his statue at the Royal Exchange,
looks as if he had swept everything behind him, including the chimnies in
the rear, as well as all the flues of this great metropolis. We do not
wonder at the Iron Duke being black in the face, with the neglect
he has been made to experience. He that never, showed an alteration
of countenance at the fire of the enemy, has positively changed colour
at the fire and smoke of the citizens. - -
We know that every statue may exclaim, “To this complexion must
we come at last;” but surely the Ramoneur may provide something in
the shape of a remedy. . We would have the Duke first thoroughly
swept, and then kept regularly hearth-stoned every week; for his
present, condition is really a most distressing one.' When the wind is
northerly he receives in his ear the whole of the smoke from the Bank
parlours, while a western breeze turns the whites of his eyes into black
with the culinary apparatus from the Mansion House. We are not
favourable to what may be termed Hero Wash-up in its ordinary sense,
but we would certainly have the hero of Waterloo undergo a regular
Wash-up once or twice a year should occasion require. Fº
MAKING WERY LIGHT OF IT.
A MR. DART, who seems actuated by the most laudable aims, has
lately been lecturing on the philosophy of a candle. ... Though the
subject is, a simple one, we think that a candle, in judicious hands,
might still serve as one of the lights of the age, notwithstanding the
advance that gas has made, wherever it can find an opening. The
philosophy of a candle must, at all events, put us up to snuff, and if an
enlarged view is taken of the world of candles, the “mould of form *
will come in for its due share of illustration. To those who are not
prepared to take a bold plunge into the regions of tallow, it may be
convenient to take a dip with the accomplished lecturer. It may
seem like º: back in the world of philosophy to return to the
common candle, but revenons à nos moutons is a maxim that is not at all
times to be discarded. The philosophy of the candle will, no doubt,
bring to light some curious phenomena, as to how many times one
pound of candles, which, by the ordinary rules of duration, will not go
into two candlesticks, may be found to go easily into one grease-pot.
We do not wonder at the illuminati seizing on a candle as a means of
general enlightenment.

PUNCH, oR THE LONDON CHARIVARL 31
PREVENTION BETTER THAN CURE.
N the days that we went floundering a short time ago, we thought we had used every
precaution to avoid the many a slip between the heel and the hip, which the frosty weather
exposed us to. We never recollect to have seen such a perfect process of “holding a
mirror up to nature” as the streets exhibited, for the pavement was like glass, and every
one who walked along could not only see himself in it, but felt himself on it rather too
frequently. Hoping to preserve our standing in society, we resorted to gutta percha
soles, but bitter was our disappointment after making them our sole reliance. The gutta
perchas gave us no purchase or hold upon the pavement, and our legs slipped away from
under us, in consequence of our precautions having proved altogether bootless. It is
true that, after the frost had disappeared, the papers were good enough to tell us how
to get ourselves rough-shod for frosty weather. It seems we ought to have got a lot of
old iron, reduced it to filings, mixed it with emery scrubbings, &c. &c., and having made
the whole mixture thoroughly red hot, we ought to have put our foot in it. A person
who could stand this might, we think, stand anything, as well as stand anywhere, and
so far there would appear to be virtue in such a remedy against slipping in frosty
weather.
In the event of the return of the ice, it may be desirable for our skating readers to
be supplied with some means of maintaining that equilibrium which is so essential to true
dignity. A balancing pole,supported by two footmen, will furnish the aristocratic votaries
of that pleasure, which glides away faster than any other, with the means of pursuing it unalloyed by those casualties which prostrate the
best energies, and reduce the highest and the humblest to the same dumpy or bumpy level.
THE WAITER,
I MET the waiter in his prime Time takes us on through many a grade; * I’ve mark'd him now for many a year;
At a magnificent hotel;
His hair, untinged by care or time,
Was oiled and brushed exceeding well.
When “waiter,” was the impatient cry,
In accents growing stronger,
He seem'd to murmur, “By and by,
Wait a little longer.”
Of “ups and downs” I’ve had my run, I’ve seen his coat more rusty grow;
Passing full often through the shade | His linen is less bright and clear, 4
And sometimes loitering in the sun. His polish’d pumps are on the go.
I and the waiter met again Torn are, alas! his Berlin gloves-
At a small inn at Ongar; They used to be much stronger;
Still when I call’d, 'twas almost vain— The waiter's whole appearance proves
He made me wait the longer. He cannot wait much longer.

HOBSON'S CHOICE,
OR THE PERPLEXITIES OF A GENTLEMAN IN SEARCH OF A SERVANT.
Y the time I had had two or three more boys in
my family, I got to hate them as if I had been a
second HERod, and the rest of my household,
too, was pretty soon tired of the wretches. If
any young housekeepers reads this, I would say
to them, Profit by my experience, and never
keep a boy—be happy with a parlour-maid, put
up with a char-woman, let the cook bring up your
dinner from the kitchen: get a good servant who
knows his business, and pay his wages as cheer-
fully as you may: but never have a boy into
your place, if you value your peace of mind.
You may save a little in the article of wages
with the little rascal, but how much do you pay
in discomfort! A boy eats as much as a man,
a boy breaks twice as much as a man," a boy is
twice as long upon an errand as a man; a boy batters, your plate and
sends it up to table dirty; you are never certain that a boy's fingers
are not in the dish which he brings up to your dinner; a boy puts your
boots on the wrong trees; and when at the end of a year or two he
has broken his way through your crockery, and at last learned some
of his business, the little miscreant privately advertizes himself in the
Times as a youth who has 2 years' character, and leaves you for higher
wages, and another place. Two young traitors served me so in the
course of my fatal experience with boys.
Then, in a family council, it was agreed that a man should be engaged
for our establishment, and we had a series of footmen (our curate
recommended to me our first man, whom the clergyman had found in
the course of his charitable excursions). I took John ToMKINs, out
of the garret, where he was starving. He had pawned every article of
value belonging to him; he had no decent clothes, left in which he
could go out to offer himself for a situation; he had not tasted meat
for weeks, except such rare bits as he could ſº from the poor Curate's
spare table. He came to my house, and all of a sudden rushed into
§§ again. He had a comfortable supply of clothes, meat, fire, and
lankets. He had not a hard master, and as for Mamma's ...; he
took it as a matter of course. He had but few pairs of shoes to clean.
and lived as well as a man of five hundred a-year. Well, JoHN Tom KINs
left my service in six months after he had been drawn out of the jaws
of death, and after he had considered himself lucky at being able to get
a crust of bread, because the cook served him a dinner of cold meat
two days running—“He never ad been used to cold meat; it was the
custom in no good fam’lies to give cold meat—he wouldn't stay where
it was practised.” And away he went, then—very likely to starve
agalm.
Him there followed a gentleman, whom I shall call MR. ABERSHAw,
for I am positive he did it, although we never could find him out. We
had a character with this amiable youth, which an angel might have been
roud of—had lived for seven years with GENERAL Hector—only left
ecause the family was going abroad, the General being made Governor
and Commander in Chief of the Tapioca Islands—the General's sister
MRs. 80LONEL AJAX, living in lodgings in the Edgware Road, answered
for the man, and for the authenticity of the General's testimonials. When
amma, MRs. CAPTAIN B., waited upon her, MRs. CAPTAIN B. remarked
that MRs. Colonel's lodgings were rather queer, being shabby in them-
selves, and over a shabbier shop—and she thought there was a smell of
hot spirits and water in MRs. &; room when MRs. B. entered
it at 1 o'clock; but, perhaps, she was not very rich, the Colonel being on
half-pay, and it º have been ether and not rum which MRs. B.
smelt. She came home announcing that she had found a treasure of
# servant, and MR. ABERSHAw stepped into our pantry and put on our
very.
Nothing could be better for some time than , this gentleman's
behaviour: and it was edifying to remark how he barred up the
house of a night, and besought me to see that the plate was all right
when he brought it upstairs in the basket. He constantly warned us,
too, of thieves and rascals about; and, though he had a villanous hang.
dog look of his own, which I could not bear, yet Mamma said, this was
only a prejudice of mine, and, indeed, I had no fault to find with the
man. Once I thought something was wrong with the lock of my study-
table; but, as I keep little or no money in the house, I did not give
this circumstance much thought, and once Mrs. CAPTAIN BUDGE saw
MR. ABERSHAw in conversation with a lady who had very much the
appearance of MRs. Colon EL AJAX, as she afterwards remembered,
but the resemblance did not, unluckily, strike Mamma at the time.
It happened one evening that we all went to see the Christmas
tomime; and of course took the footman on the box of the fly, and
treated him to the pit, where I could not see him; but he said
afterwards, that he enjoyed the play very much. When the pantomime
was over, he was in waiting in the lobby to hand us back to the
carriage, and a pretty good load we were, our three children, ourselves,
and MRs. CAPTAIN B., who is a very roomy woman.
When we got home, the cook, with rather a guilty and terrified
look, owned to her mistress that a most “singlar” misfortune had hap-
pened. She was positive she shut the door—she could take her Bible
oath she did—after the boy who comes every evening with the paper;
but the policeman, about 11 o'clock, had rung and knocked to say that
the door was open—and open it was, sure enough; and great coat, and
two hats, and an umbrella, were gone.
“Thank’Evins! the plate was all locked up safe in my pantry,” MR.
ABERSHAw said, turning up his eyes; and he showed me that it was
all right before going to bed, that very night; he could not sleep unless
I counted it, he said—and - - - -
Lord! to think that while he was so º and unsuspicious, enjoin'
of himself at the play, some rascal should come in and rob his kind
master | If he’d a knowd it, he never would have left the house-
no, that he wouldn’t.
He was talking on in this way, when we heard a loud shriek from
Mamma's room, and her bell began to ring like mad: and presently,
out she ran, roaring out, “ANNA MARIA! Cook! MR. HoBson'
Thieves? I’m robbed, I’m robbed!”
“Where’s the scoundrel?” says ABERshaw, seizing the poker as
valiant as any man I ever saw; and he rushed upstairs towards MRs.
B.'s apartment, I following behind, more leisurely; for, if the rascal of
a housebreaker had pistols with him, how was I to resist him, I should
like to know?
But when I got up—there was no thief. The scoundrel had been
there: but he was gone; and a large box of MRs. B.'s stood in the
centre of the room, burst open, with numbers of things, strown about
the floor. Mamma was sobbing her eyes out, in her big chair; my
wife and the female servants already assembled; and, ABERSHAW
H. the poker, banging under the bed to see if the villain was still
there.
I was not aware at first of the extent of MRs. B.’s misfortune, and it
was only by degrees, as it were, that that unfortunate lady was brought
to tellus what she had lost. First, it was her dresses she bemoaned,
two of which, her rich purple velvet, and her black satin, were gone:
then, it was her Cashmere shawl: then, a box full of ornaments, her
jet, her pearls, and her garnets; nor was it until the next day that she
confessed to my wife that the great loss of all was an old black velvet
reticule, containing two hundred and twenty-three pounds, in gold, and
notes. I suppose she did not like to tell me of this; for a short time
before, being somewhat pressed for money, I had asked her to lend me
some; when, I am sorry to say, the old lady declared, upon her honour,
that she had not a guinea, nor should have one until her dividends
came in. Now, if she had lent it to me, she would have been paid back
again, and this she owned, with tears in her eyes. -
Well, when she had cried and screamed sufficiently, as mone of this
grief would mend matters, or bring back her money, we went to bed,
ABERshaw clapping to all the bolts of the house door, and putting the
great bar up with a clang that might be heard all through the street.
And it was not until two days after the event that I got the numbers
of the notes which MRs. CAPTAIN B. had lost, and which were all paid
into the Bank, and exchanged for gold the morning after the robbery.
When I was aware of its extent, and when the horse was stolen, of
course I shut the stable-door, and called in a policeman-not one of
your letter X policemen—but a gentleman in plain clothes, who
inspected the premises, examined the family, and º the
servants one by one. This gentleman's opinion was that the robbery
was got up in the house. First, he suspected the cook, then he inclined
towards the housemaid, and the young fellow with whom, as it appeared,
that artful hussey was keeping company; and those two poor wretches
expected to be carried off to jail forthwith, so great was the terror
under which they lay.
All this while MR. ABERSHAw gave the -
tion; insisted upon having his boxes examined, and his accounts looked
into, for though he was absent, waiting upon his master and mistress,
on the night when the robbery was committed, he did not wish to
escape search—not he; and so we looked over his trunks just out of
compliment. - -
The officer did not seem to be satisfied—as, indeed, he had discovered
nothing as yet—and after a long and fruitless visit in the evening,
returned on the next morning incompany with another of the detectives,
the famous Scrogg|INs indeed.
As soon as the famous Scroggins saw ABERSHAw, all matters seemed
to change—“Hullo, JERRY | * said he ; “what, you here f at your old
tricks again? This is the man what has done it, Sir,” he said to me;
“he is a well-known rogue and prig.” MR. ABERSHAW swore more
than ever that he was innocent, and called upon me to swear that I had
seen him in the pit of the theatre during the whole of the performance;
but I could neither take my affidavit to this fact, nor was MR. SCROG-
GINs a bit satisfied, nor would he be until he had the man up to Beak
Street Police Court, and examined by the magistrate.
oliceman every informa-
then it was that he cried out, Lord!

Here my young man was known as an old practitioner on the tread.
mill, and, seeing there was no use in denying the fact, he confessed it
very candidly. He owned that he had been unfortunate in his youth,
that he had not been in GENERAL HEctor's service these five years;
that the character he had got was a sham one, and MRs. AJAx merely
a romantic fiction. But no more would he acknowledge. His whole
desire in life, he said, was to be an honest man; and ever since he had
entered my service he had acted as such. , Could I point out a single
instance in which he had failed to do his duty? But there was no use
in a poor fellow who had met with misfortune trying to retrieve him-
self: he began to cry when he said this, and spoke so naturally that
I was almost inclined to swear that I had seen him under us all night in
the pit of the theatre. -
There was no evidence, against him; and this good man was dis-
charged, both from the Police office and from our service, where he
couldn’t abear to stay, he said, now that his Hhonour was questioned.
And MRs. BUDGE believed in his innocence, and persisted in turning
off the cook and housemaid, who she was sure had stolen her money:
nor was she quite convinced of the contrary two years after, when MR.
flºw and MRs. Colonel, A.JAX were both transported for
Orgery.
THE PRIDE OF THE THISTLE.
THE beauty, the tenderness, of a poor Highland Girl is very well in
}. but is an awful visitation upon the pride of an old Scotch
amily, “one of the oldest and most respectable—the descendants of
the celebrated Lord President For BEs l’”
trophises his Highland Girl—
“Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower
Of beauty is thy earthly dower,”—
the dowry of lilies and roses is of allowed value in verse; but not worth
a bawbee when estimated by the “present possessors of the extensive
estates of Cullodem.”
We have been mightily instructed by a recent instance of morality
manifested by Scotch nobility. A young gentleman—positively one of
the descendants of the PRESIDENT For Bes—falls in love with a poor
Highland Girl “of considerable personal charms.” The couple take
flight, and are duly married. There is not a word to be said against
the bride, if we except the one worst word—poverty. , And then what-
ever roses she may have in her face—she has no blood, no old ennobled
fluid in her veins. She is merely a good, beautiful, loving girl—and
that is all. What a fatal match—what hymeneal degradation for one
of the “descendants of the PRESIDENT Forbes!”
The lovers are pursued to Glasgow. “Fast as the priest can make
them they are one.” They are moreover fast asleep; but, says the
account—
“The friends of the young gentleman soon roused them from dreams of love, and
used persuasions, arguments, and threats, to induce him to desert his newly-married wife,
and return to his brother's mansion; but in vain—he had made his choice, and resolved
to live and die in the society of his blooming bride.”
Magnanimous descendants of the PRESIDENT For BEs. We cannot
but admire their devotedness to the nobility of honour and truth. They
threaten and wheedle the young man to desert the woman he has, an
hour or two before, sworn to cleave to for life; and when he will not
abandon the young creature who has confided to him more than her
existence—
“He was told that in a few days he would receive the small fortune secured to him as
a younger brother by the family settlement, and that for the rest of his life he would be
disowned by the family. The friends then left him, pursued their way northwards, and
left the young and loving adventurers to their own resources.”
This is truly noble. The young man’s “friends,” the illustrious
descendants of the PRESIDENT Forbes, in their anxiety for the purity
of the family 'scutcheon, do not see how it can be blotted, either by the
falsehood of a man, or the broken heart of a woman; the man, i
one of the great folks of Culloden, and the woman only a poor Highlan
girl!—A girl who, we doubt not, might stand for the poet's picture:-
“Thou wear'st, upon thy forehead clear,
The freedom of a mountaineer;
A face with gladness overspread,
Soft smiles, by human kindness bred.”
Any way, we would wager it, her “forehead clear” will not be
deepened by the blush that ought to have possessed the faces of the
“friends” of the bridegroom, earnestly entreating him to vindicate the
nobility of his blood, and be a rascal. Such is the pride of the Thistle,
as worn, by the descendants of “the celebrated LoRD PRESIDENT
FoRBEs 1” We wish them joy of it.

A TEETOTAL PHENOMENON.
OUR American correspondent has met, in New York, with a convert
to teetotalism, who, whereas, before taking the pledge, he used to see all
objects double, now sees only their halves.
WOODEN HEADS OF SEWENOAKS.
1. How the Kent Farmers treated their Friend.
ECENTLY at the Sevenoaks meeting for
the artificial augmentation of rents last
week, EARL STANHoPE is reported to
A have made the following confession:—
“I had the honour of presenting in the House
of Lords upwards of 80 petitions proceeding from
almost every parish in Kent. They were not
considered worthy of a single observation from
either side, and I might as well have laid before
them a number of old newspapers. As for ad-
dressing the House of Lords, I have occasionally
thought it my duty to do so, but, for all the
effect, I might just as well have walked into my
vegetable garden and addressed just so many
cabbages and cauliflowers.”
At which words the noble Earl's agri-
cultural auditory exclaimed “Hear.”
Now, if the Kent farmers had felt any
sympathy with EARL STANHOPE, any
indignation at the disrespectful treat-
ment which hisłLordship described himself to have received from his
Peers, they ought to have cried “Shame.” . . - - -
If they thought the House of Lords right in taking no notice of him,
to shout “Hear” was consistent enough.
But it was very cruel.
2. Philosophy of an Agricultural Mind.
Subjoined is a special manifestation of the Landed Wisdom in con-
tº: above-mentioned, at Sevenoaks assembled. A MR. J. BELL
said that—
“There was an interest behind—one to which MR. CoppEN and those who acted with
him were content to act as jackalls—the great moneyed interest (Cheers)—the great
creditor class—the owners of public and private debt—the fund-holder and mortgagee,
the money-jobber, usurer, and placeman it was, who alone had benefited from the low
prices which had prevailed during the last 35 years (Cheers). If the present system
should be persisted in, he would not give two years' purchase for the rent of England
or the dividends upon the funds."
-
Firstly, how sensible is the complaint of the lowness of prices for
the last 35 years, uttered by a gentleman who, in the same breath,
bawls for a restoration of the Corn-Laws, which have existed during
the greater part of that time! ... -
Secondly, how sagacious that estimate of “the great moneyed interest”
which supposes that the debt-owners and fundholders, are seeking to
maintain a system, which, if persisted in, will cause the dividends to
cease to be paid. Either they, like pigs swimming, are cutting their
own throats, or as suicidal an act has been perpetrated by MR. J. BELL,
at Sevenoaks, with the rope which he was too liberally indulged with.
THE SMITHFIELD PHILHARMONIC CONCERTS.
THESE celebrated réunions continue to be attended every Monday
and Friday by numerous assemblies, of a refinement corresponding to
the delicate atmosphere of the locality. The performance on Monda
last presented no novel features, but afforded, as it never fails to afford,
extreme gratification to the habitués. A barcarole by a sheep-dog at-
tracted our especial notice, and a vocal symphony of hogs ſº a
curious contrast of the trebles and tenori with the bassi, though con-
taining, we thought, several discords introduced with more effect than
scientific skill. Another piece performed by these artistes had a strong
resemblance to the Concert Stick. The Southdowns and Leicesters were
strong as usual in their pastoral chorus, to which the cows gave effect
by the addition of their low notes. An allegro furioso passage dashed
out by an ox, and accompanied by a horn movement, told greatly on
the crowd, at whom it was evidently directed. We have still to com;
lain of the bad accommodation provided at these entertainments, and
!. not whether to refer their maintenance on their present incon-
venient site to the obstinacy, or folly, or cupidity of their directors, or
to all three causes together.
Shakspeare among the Cheap Tailors.
THE Shade of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, having perused certain ac:
counts of tyrannous tailors, begs leave to suggest from a little º of
his own, what he conceives to be a pertinent motto, to be painted, in
red letters over their shop-doors. The motto will be found in a play
called “Othello,” and runs thus:
“A sweating DEVIL here.”
And therefore, as W. S. further suggests, a devil to be incon-
tinently avoided.

A Fond Father's Advice to his Son.
As you make your bed, my son, so you must lie in it, but if you stuff
it full of bills, you will soon find it very hard, lying to keep matters in
the least straight. Drive the Dun from the dºor, and you need never
trouble yourself about bolting; but if the bailiffs once begin knocking
outside, you will never know again a moment's rest. So be careful, my
son, how you make your bed, and avoid debt, for, believe, me, many a
young man has had his bed snatched from under him, and been thrown
on the world, simply from sleeping on tick.-The Registered Chesterfield.

THE WEATHER AND THE PAWEMENT.

The Serpentine, during the frost, afforded frequent instances of a Tarantula-like effect upon the

they slided into the pastime which they should have checked as dangerous.
THE LION QUEEN.
ALL our readers know that the Lion QUEEN-a young creature of seventeen-in the course of her
performance, has been killed by one of her tiger subjects. One minute, the girl was alive, in all her pride
of domination, ruling the beasts for twopences—the next, the tiger had fixed his teeth in her neck, the
jugular poured out the life; and, in brief course, a Coroner's Jury sat upon the body. “Accidental Death.”
... What has become of the tiger? Has it been killed? Or will the human blood that, in its ferocious
instinct, it has shed, make the brute a more valuable beast—a greater attraction to the show * Will
the tiger remain a more important member of MR. Wombwell's º will it, as it has been
suggested—become the only quadruped tenant of MADAME Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors, the Tiger

e brute.
The Chronicle has a fine essay on the miserable taste, the low craving for excitement, fostered by the
performances of what are called Lion KINGs and Los QUEENs—the Potentates—as it has appeared
with other Powers, in these days of revolution—occasionally made quick conveyance of by their rebellious
subjects. “We trust,” º: our contemporary, “that the recent frightful catastrophe will be the last
ºf its kind, and that in pleasure, as in all else, we may see a healthier state of things brought about.”
We trust so too, and indeed, if we may credit a report—be it understood we only give it as a rumour-

the very highest example will henceforth tend to discourage all such brutal exhibitions.

“almost worry aman,” says the Cowrier,

They patronise, nothing that is not

suggests that they should have their

their eggs laid by widowed hens...And

CHARTIST STATISTICS.
T a meeting of the Chartists at the London
Tavern a few evenings ago, one of the com-
pany out-did almost all former efforts by
insisting that the Charter had become
actually necessary in consequence of “16,000
ounds having been paid last year for
utter, eggs, and bacon for Buckingham
Palace.”
We do not pretend to know the data on
which this assertion is founded, but we can
only say, for the story of the £16,000 worth
of butter, eggs, and bacon, that we cannot
swallow one half of it. The speaker seemed
to have the butter quite pat, but, unless the
practice of putting it upon bacon prevails to
an awful extent in the Palace, we really
cannot, see how the consumption can be
- effected, while, as for , the eggs, we are
sure there are not half as many laid in England as are laid in his
indictment.
It is rather ingenious on his part to suggest to the country that the
Charter is the only mode by which its bacon can be saved, though it is
obvious that, unless the royal household lived on eggs and bacon all the
year round, the bill for these items could not amount to one hundredth
part of the orator’s estimate. We suspect he has got several wrong
pigs by the ear, and we are satisfied that so much bacon as he alleges
could neither be cured nor endured by the inmates of Buckingham
Palace. To feed the household on nothing but salted swine would be
rather scurvy treatment, and we can only come to the conclusion, that
the Chartist DEMOSTHENEs, in enlarging on the quantity of pig con-
sumed in the Palace, was merely giving way to the propensity for goin
the whole hog, which is a characteristic of the party he is a member of.
THE TEA DEPUTATION.
ON Wednesday, the 16th of January, a deputation from Liverpool,
headed by its members, waited on LoRD JoHN RussBLI, and the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, with the laudable desire of obtaining
their consent to a reduction in the Tea duty.
The business commenced by a few words from SIR THOMAs BIRCH,
who was very appropriately selected on this occasion, for, as the
Premier (must have mentally) remarked, “BIRGH has always been
looked upon as one of the principal representatives of Tea in this
country.” - - -
MR. CARDwell, went into the arithmetic of Tea, and proved that,
while in the United Kingdom the consumption amounted to only a
pound and three quarters per head, it was nine pounds per head per
annum in the Australian colonies. This, at a spoonful each, and one
for the pot, gave several million, cups of tea to the colonists, while, at
the same strength of #. there would be little more than a dish
(of Tea) per diem for the inhabitants of Great Britain. ,
MR. Epwarp BRODRIBB enlarged on the social merits of Tea, and
insisted that, although mere spoons had sometimes made a stir in Tea,
there was now a small but determined Tea party springing up in the
kingdom, and, with all respect, he would say that the Government would
eventually be teased out of the duty.
Another Member of the deputation took a view of the matter in
reference to the agricultural Interests, urging, that, so long as the genuine
Tea was kept out of the country by the heavy duty, the hedges of the
farmer would never be safe from those depredators who plucked a
urious sort of Twankay from the sloe, and stole for the Tea market
that which was neither Hyson nor His'm,
After a few further remarks from other Members of the deputation,
LORD JoHN Russell courteously acknowledged himself the friend of
Tea, and though some called it mere slop, sent over by our foes the
Chinese, he was not one of those who regarded it as a “weak invention
of the enemy.” After intimating his willingness to take a Tea leaf, if
racticable, out of the book of free trade, he assured the deputation that
e and his friend, the CHANCELLOR 9F THE ExchequER, would, some
day, after dinner, take Tea—into their best consideration.
The Romney Cat.
'ſite ºadstone Gazette states that the EARL of Romney has, at the
| last Kent Sessions, shown a lively desire to employ the cat upon grown
men. Five poor wretches, aged from 24 to 30, who, starving, had
stolen six loaves, were recently whipped by sentence of his lordship!
The nobleman's arms has for supporters two lions. We think his
Lordship, had better assume a couple of cats. His Lordship's motto is
22
“Mon sibi, sed patria.” We would—circumstances of the lash con-
sidered—suggest an alteration: “Non patriae, sed sibi.”
MARRIAGES IN EVERY DAY LIFE.
AT about this period of the year the newspapers amuse their readers
with occasional lists of marriages in high life, and we do not see why as
much interest should not attach to the intended pairing off of humbler
couples. We have, therefore, authorised our “own correspondent” to
poke his nose into private life, and our worthy Secretary for other-
people's-affairs has favoured us with the following:–
The marriage between Young HowARD, surnamed the Prince of the
ouse of Coburg—he being an assistant in Coburg House—and the
|fair MATILDA Jones, familiarly known as the heroine of Waterloo
a soubriquet she has gained by a long engagement on the commercial
field of Waterloo House—will take place before the spring, as the bride
|and bridegroom must both be in town for the commencement of the
Season.
|... The nuptials of ORLANDo SNookEy, the attorney’s clerk, with MIss
|ELIZABETH READYTIN, will be solemnised as soon as the bridegroom
has saved up the money for a clandestine license. MR. SNOOKEY
will be given away by a senior clerk, and Miss READYTIN will throw
herself away with the assistance of the clerk and pew-opener.
The long-talked-of match between MR. JAcob SLowcoach, of the
Long Room in the Custom House, and Miss MARTHA MAYDAY, of the
| Soho Bazaar, is still upon the tapis, the difficulty being to find the
necessary sum for tapisserie, for the newly-wedded couple, should they
mislead one another to the altar. MR. S.LowcoACH was understood to
|have stated that he had furnished a floor; but it seems he had only
furnished an excuse for not having done so earlier. -
The wedding of the gallant, dashing. CAPTAIN CUTAWAY, with
DAME MERVEILLE, the fascinating milliner—not millionaire, as was
once stated by mistake—will take place as soon as the habeas can be
obtained for the removal of the gallant bridegroom elect from the
Queen's prison, where he is at present confined with a severe indis-
position to pay his creditors.
The above are a few specimens of the sort of domestic news furnished
by some of our contemporaries, but we have taken our intelligence from
a somewhat lower range of society, whose every-day life seems to us to
Fº quite as much interest as that of what are termed the upper
circles.
FRIGHTFUL CASE OF STITCH IN THE SIDE.
Yesterday, the family of the Most Noble the MARQUEss of Four-
HUNDRED-THOUSAND were thrown into the greatest alarm by the sudden
and, apparently, violent illness of the Marquess, who rose in his usual
health, and partook of his breakfast with his usual vigour. The
Marquess, having dressed himself to go out—it was observed by certain
members of the family that he º in a new coat, one of the
newest things of the season, brought only from the East, the previous
evening—was suddenly seized with the most violent pains—with the
most tremendous attack of what is vulgarly known as stitch in the
side. Medical assistance was immediately summoned, when, after a
long and critical examination of the sufferer, it was discovered by the
intelligence of the physician—intelligence, it must be confessed, extra-
º the cause of the attack was not in the anatomy of
is Lordship, but in his Lordship's new coat. The coat, it appeared,
had been made under the despotism of a “sweater,” that it might be
made dog-cheap, and—it is plain there must have been “magic in the
web”—every stitch in the garment transferred itself into his Lordship's
flesh. Never was nobility, so dreadfully sewed up. His Lordship,
having desired the coat to be given, as a conscience offering, to the
Home, for the Houseless, felt immediate relief; and is now going on as
well as can be expected.
“Our Own Correspondent.”
THE Post’s “Own Correspondent,” writing from Paris, says, very
profoundly—
“Having exhausted that interminable topic, the weather, there remains, unfortu-
nately, little else to speak about.”
This exhausting person-exhausting the interminable—is, no doubt,
a descendant of the Irish sailor, who, pulling up what seemed to him
an interminable rope, gave it as his opinion that some murdering villain
had “cut the end off.”
CHEAP BIBLES.
THE wages paid to the wretched women by the British and Foreign
Bible Society prove that, whateyer else they may desire to make of
religion, they have no wish to make it “binding.”

Punch—in his last number but one—took occasion to speak, of

tarian zeal—as “A Victim to Let.” And the Victim was to Let. Punch
dwelt upon the ungrateful fact... HowLETT received much sympathy
through the columns of the Herald—much praise, but no reward. The
commendation was great, and frequent, but there was not, for the
destitute man, whose destitution was so piteously bemoaned, a single
cut of solid pudding. Punch, thereupon, called on the platform Christians
who had bellowed their piety, and, in their charity, pelted LoRD
RUSSELL-a man of earnest, unaffected, religion—with the foulest
words implying the foulest motives, to comfort and shelter the destitute
HowLETT; to show that their Christianity was a little deeper than
their lips, descending even to their breeches-pockets. Punch was not
the apologist of the offender HowLETT, who—as Punch still believes—

OBJECT TO HAVE DISSIPATED BY Post-OFFICE THEORIES AND ATTACKs

the length of his signature, may be the Sea-Serpent into the bargain—

HowLETT-and so, like indignant virtue, comes down rap with £25 for

“I beg-(says ONE, &c.)—with all my heart, and with many thanks to HowLETT–to
send him, through your kind hands, £25, and to request you to give it to him on
Tuesday, the 29th instant; and I beg to say publicly that if any individual, or number
of individuals, shall in the aggregate send you, on or before that day, for a similar
purpose another £25, then I will, on the 30th instant, send you a third £25 for the same
purpose; and I hope we shall thus be able to give him a lift towards setting up in a
respectable line of life.”
There is heart in this, at least. Of the brains shewn in the letter,
we would ſain not speak, seeing none. Nevertheless, we will give an
instance or two of “ONE of The PUBLIC’s ”no-meaning.
“One feels the utmost disgust at which the professed withas attempted, as he thinks,
to dismiss the poor man's case.” º
Punch did not attempt to dismiss it; Punch dwelt upon it; and
the result is to the jocund HowLEtt—£25. “Give Punch,” says
“ONE”— - - -
“Give Punch the vapid arid sentiments and vain heart-drying philosophy of his
friend the Times to glorify, and he is grand and full of repetition; but give him the
poor (who can make no return) to defend in simplicity and single-mindedness, and his
professions prove as pot-bellied as the simpering portrait he weekly draws of himself.”
Yes; “A working-man” says “ONE,”—“a working man who can't
afford to pay threepence for Punch, is of no account.” Yet here has
Punch championed the destitute Howiett, causing more good to the

PROSPECTS OF POLITICAL TRADE.
WHILE every other kind of business is fortunately looking up, the prospects of the Political
Trade are, to the traders themselves, far from encouraging. -
There is not much of the raw material of popular ignorance to give employment to the
Great Grievance Manufacturers who have usually found a market for their stuffs, and the con:
stant, clack of those, ever-working mills, the tongues of the talkative, members, will in all
probability be stopped for want of the usual supply to keep them going. The work of the session
is likely to be slack, a circumstance that is extremely satisfactory; for when the work of
legislation runs short, all other work seems to enjoy a state of healthful activity.
There appears no chance of any fresh importation of material for working up into yarn,
with the exception, perhaps, of the usual cargo from Ireland, which always, provides the
heaviest commodities of the session. The º provided by Government for the production
of such legislative fabrics as may be in demand, will, it is expected, furnish the requisite supply;
and though the usualattempts will be made by some of the disaffected, to break the machinery
up, there is every reason to believe that the peace of the house will not be seriously disturbed
by the Parliamentary malcontents. -
The weavers of the legislative web-work, which usually gets into a state of entanglement
at an early period of the session, will most of them be out of employ, but everything out of
doors will be much brisker in consequence. Even the firm, or rather the infirm of DisrAELI and
Company will be working at a dead loss, if they continue to work at all, for their manufactured
stuffs cannot obtain a price in the market. There has been such a glut of their wares,that the
public have become quite weary, and though DiskAELI and Company may continue to open their
mouths very wide—as the commercial phrase goes—they will not command a single offer.

COATS 1–THE NOWELTY OF THE SEASON.
MR. Punch-as an universal genius—has produced a Coat, that may be called the Novelty
of the Season. It is denominated the LIVE- ANjiàºf fivº CôAf. being a most com-
fortable garment for every time of the year, imparing an honest and pleasurable warmth to the
heart of the purchaser, and being made upon the premises, is not contagious with the Sweating
Sickness—a disease that centuries ago ravaged England—and has of late re-appeared with more
than its original violence, many alarming cases—from the use of contagious garments—having.
appeared in the very highest ranks of life, endangering coronets, marquisate and ducal.
The LIVE-AND-LET LIVE is of the best and noblest materials—the wool interwoven
with Goose Down; the Geese treated upon the most liberal principles, being only plucked
once with the most scrupulous regard to justice:–the LIVE-AND-LET-LIVE Geese being
by no means such Geese as the Eider Ducks, of which animals it is written by Mupſe, in his
“British Birds,” as follows:-"The nest of the eider duck is lined with exquisitely fine down,
which the bird pulls from her breast; and as the eggs are deposited”–(eggs made, by a
certain modern process golden ones)—"she covers, them with more of that down. The bird
is so tame that she allows the people to lift her from her nest, R.E.Move THE Down, AND Eggs In
PART, and again replace her, where [she lays afresh, and pulls MoRE pown! This process
is continued, not only till the female can furnish no more down, but till the male also is in part
denuded, as he comes to assist as soon as the supply of the female becomes exhausted.”
Man, in his multifarious inventions, or, rather, adaptations, is under the deepest debt to
the lower animals, although he has rarely the justice even to confess the obligation. As the
coachmaker owes the thought of his spring to the leg of a grasshopper, so does Mr. Punch
owe the idea of his LIVE-AND-LET-LIVE
COAT to the sufferings of the Eider Duck.

coats, and sell, not garments, but the blood and
not be plundered Eider Ducks, but Geese, made
to contribute down, for down's worth—Geese
plucked with the fingers of mercy, and fed with
the hand of justice.
The smallest quantity of goose-down obtained
upon these principles has in it the warmth of an
*:::: wing. It defies all cold, and even in
a deluge, lets the torrent run off it, like water
from a duck’s back. Many persons suffering
under what was considered by their best friends
and bitterest acquaintance, the most incurable
contraction of the heart, have-wearing the
LIVE-AND-LET-LIVE-rejoiced in a sudden
expansion of the organ. That “hollow muscle.”
—in the phrase of anatomists—has dilated with
the warmest and most generous fluid, and-
wonderful to relate—all the world and all its men
and women, have been regarded with sympathising
and affectionate eyes by the LIVE-AND-LET-
LIVE professor.
Mr. Punch has no wish to underrate the works
of his fellow-labourers. It is only to repeat a
many-told fact to state that there are Coats made
upon such principles that the pockets they contain
are narrow and comfortless as a rat-trap, and,
therefore constantly shunned by the fingers of
the wearer. It is otherwise with the pockets of
the LIVE-AND-LET-LIVE. They are ample
and cosey, and have a magic in the web of their
lining, that upon every just and merciful occasion,
incontinently draws the hand of the wearer into

Trembling on the Verge of a Joke.
THE Morning Chronicle wasyery nearajoke last
week, but not quite. Talking of the shabby
conduct of Ministers towards the M.P. for Cock-
ermouth, it said that last session they completely
“unhorsed him off his hobby.” As the ill-used
M.P. in questionis MR. HoRsMAN, the Chronicle
might as well have completed its joke, instead of
leaving it to us to do, by calling him MR. UN-
horsman. (We do not wish to be too hard upon
the “Chronicle,” but it really must make its own
jokes for the future. A list of our charges may be
had at the Qjice, from £50 upwards.)

QUADRILLE DES PATINEURS.
Arrangee pour les Chevaux d'Omnibus, &c.
BARQN NATHAN has just been composing a new set of
Quadrilles for Horses, to be danced in the public streets
whenever the slippery state of the roads will allow.
We subjoin a slight sketch of the equestrian figures:–
The first dance is L’Hiver, which has evidently been sug-
* gested by L’Eté, and is danced as follows:–
First Omnibus advances.
Second Omnibus advances.
º They do the vis-à-vis for several minutes, then perform the
glissade from right to left, and from left to right, and fall
on their respective knees, after several balancee, but, finding
they cannot balance themselves, they execute a few tremble-
mens de pieds, and rest their bodies at full length on the
wood pavement.
Cad jumps down, and does the cavalier seul.
Policeman advances, and, waving his right hand, orders
them “to move on.”
Both Omnibusses maintain their first position.
Passengers get out, and chassez in all directions.
Omnibusses wheel round, and make the best of it.
Grand Finale. Horses retire to the knackers!
The second figure is much more simple, and is called
The Hansom Fling.
Hansom chooses a fare for his partner for the Fling.
Partner throws himself into the arms of Hansom. Horse
immediately cuts on the splashboard a few jetés-battus with
his hind-legs; Partner retires into the furthermost corner
of Cab, Horse drops on one leg, and, after a rapid dos-à-dos,
sets down Partner in the º of the road.
Grande Ronde of strangers and pickpockets, who take
Partner's handkerchief, and crossing over to the other side
of the *. shuffle offin double-quick time.
Hop-Waltz by Partner into Chemist's Shop.
Hansom walks off.
N.B. The General Finale of The Hansom Fling is a
Doctor's Bill.
SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF
AN UNPROTECTED FEMALE.
Scene 13.-Hall of the Post-Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand. The UNPROTECTED FEMALE, having “paid a little Bill” for a Friend in the Country,
has been repaid the amount by a Post-Office Order, and has got as far as the Post-Office in a desperate attempt to get it cashed.
Unprotected Female (gazing in perplerily at the range of doors and
windows, duly described in very large inscriptions, “Accountants’ Office.”
“Secretary’s Office.” “Receiver-General’s Office.” “Stamps issued here.”

[Scene changes to the Money. Order Office in Aldersgate Street. A
range of sliding hatch doors runs across the room, with labels
above them “Orders Paid,” “Orders Granted.” The ledge in front
of them is occupied by a crowd of all ages, seres, and sizes, about
eight to a bor—and the Clerks seem to have combined for the pur-
pose of eluding payment ºf any Order whatever. There is a general
ea pression of impatience, mingled with occasional resignation on
the part of old hands.

THE AMERICAN FLOATING DRAMA.
INCE the Drama has been going
on so swimmingly in America,
it... is no wonder that, on the
Mississippi and Ohio–accord-
ing to the account of MR.
BANVARD in describing his Pano-
rama of those rivers—there are
actually floating theatres, which
travel from city to city situated
along their banks. Dollars being
scarce in these regions, the prices
of admission are based on a sys-
tem of barter; the substitute
for hard cash being, for instance,
a bushel of potatoes, or two-
dozen eggs. Of course, any
other useful commodities would
be taken in lieu of silver, so that
9 having no . in your pocket
would be no obstacle to your
seeing the play; provided you
had a penknife or a pencil case
about you that you could spare.
As the * must pro-
portioned to the quality of the
places; supposing a seat in the
allery to be a pound of butter,
we might conceive a place in the dress-circle to be a bladder of lard;
or a stall, a cheese; whilst for a family box the charge would be,
perhaps, a family joint. It is clear that the aquatic actors of America
need not starve. As to potatoes and eggs, which are capable of serving
as missiles, we think, recollecting, how our Transatlantic cousins
treated MR. MACREADY, that there is a peculiar wisdom in taking all
such articles at the doors.
POLITICAL FISTIANA.
THE YoUTHFUL STUNNER requests us to state that he may be heard
of at the Pig and Tinderbox by any parties, whether Free Traders or
Protectionists, that may happen to be passing that way. The STUNNER
will be happy to initiate gentlemen of either way of "...". the
mysteries of the fistic science; a knowledge of which has become so
necessary to both sides at Pro-Corn-Law meetings, where the discussion
now consists of such literally knock-down arguments. The noble Art
of Self-Defence the STUNNER contends is the best resource of the Pro-
tectionists; whereas nothing can be more desirable for the advocates
of Free Trade than a fair stand-up fight and no favour. YoUTHFUL
approves of the return to the good old English practice of deciding |
disputes by the fist, instead of by resorting to the unmanly use of the
tongue and pen, and thinks that both cotton-spinners and farmers
would meet on equal ground in a mill.
Something out of the Common.
MonsLEUR PROUDHoN has just married a young lady of immense
property. Now, if all “property is a theft,” it is clear that PROUDHQN
osition of a receiver of stolen goods,
and the receiver, we are told, is fully as bad as the thief. PROUDHoN
was generally looked up to as “the SoLoMon of Communism,” but the
result has proved he was nothing in common with the great name,
further than being an IKEY SoLoMons. If tried by his own Laws of
Property, he would most certainly be condemned “guilty of a-fence.”
The only thing he can do to save himself, will be to restore the pro-
perty, which he clearly, by his own confession, has stolen.
The Universal Luminary.
LoRD BROUGHAM is stated to have delivered a lecture on the subject
of light, last Monday week, at the Institute of the Academy of Sciences
at Paris, and to have illustrated his discourse by means of an apparatus
which he had got made by M. Soleil. In going to M. Soleil’s, the
noble and learned Lord went to the right shop for the means of experi-
menting on light, and doubtless was enabled by the help of Soleil to
make his theory as clear as noon-day.

IN passing down Holborn, or the Strand, or the Poultry, our ear has
often been arrested with the cry of “Going—going—going—(repeated
innumerable times)—gone.” . .
The difference between a person's body and a person's ear, when
they are respectively arrested, we believe, is this:--that, whereas the
former is immediately seized with a violent desire to run, the latter is
only taken with agentle curiosity to stop.
*... the above sounds of “ j. ” no sooner
beat upon the drum of our ear, than we suddenly pause and look about
us to see where the blow has come from, for it is but natural to turn
round on receiving a blow, to see whom it has been dealt to you by.
The dealer, on these occasions, is an Auctioneer, and his dealings are
so open to the scrutiny of the world, that he plies his honest vocation
in a shop, the front of which seems to have flown away. Indeed, there
is such an air of openness about him, and his business, that you invo-
luntarily walk in. The greatest respect is shown to you as you enter.
Dark:looking gentlemen creep backwards to make way for you, and the
Auctioneer appeals. to your ſº in the most flattering manner.
The boy with the dirty apron and bags of sleeves, that look as if they had
been black-leaded, is sharply directed “to hand the tray to the gentleman
for his inspection.” Every little article, from a boot-jack downwards, is
held up admiringly under your nose, as if they were bouquets that only
required to be sniffed to be appreciated, and the bidding, which, on your
entrance, was only carried on in timid whispers, breaks out now into that
big, confident, tone, which can only be inspired by the possession of mil-
lions. The Auctioneer's hammer grows twice as big—his hammer knocks
twice as loud. You know this is all done in honour of yourself, and feel
§ are called upon to do something to deserve it. A silver cruet-standis
eing eagerly disputed for amongst the millionaires.. It is only
£3 10s. How remarkably cheap! It is true you do not want it, and
you have a long fight with yourself whether you shall buy it. But the
worthy Auctioneer sees your distress, and relieves your embarrassment
by knocking down the cruet-stand to you, congratulating you, moreover,
in the kindness of his heart, upon “the very great bargain you have got.”
You take it home, and discover that your bargain º be dear at
five shillings |
We never pass one, of these Mock:Auctions, that only keep open
house that they may the easier “take in" visitors, without walking in
for five minutes purposely to enjoy the popular farce of “Raising the
Wind” that is being acted inside in the *. daylight.
RT TITTT
The company is invariably the same, having a large dash of Jews, and
the Jews one meets at auctions are never particularly handsome. It
would almost seem as if the Jewish physiognomy, from attending such
places, had been made especially for-bidding:
Amongst this select company, however, there is one, character that
always takes the leading business, and remarkably well he performs it.
We will call him—
THE CAPITALIST OF THE MOCK-AUCTION.
We have been admiring him now for these eight or ten years, and
though he has been spending hundreds every day, for five days every
week (for on Fridays the Mock-Auction is generally closed), he has
not got to the end of his capital yet! The amount that prodigal man
must spend every year would drive RothschiId into the workhouse.
Nothing is too good or too common—too expensive or too cheap-
for him. One minute he will º a silver candelabra, the next a silver
thimble. In the morning he will add a hundred guinea dressing-case
to his enormous property, and in the afternoon amuse himself by bidding
a shilling for a little trumpery pen knife. Why, he must have some-
where about 50,000,000 penknives already!. -
The articles he has the greatest hankering for are evidently razors
and yet, to look at his unshorn beard, you would fancy he never shave
from one month to another. The hairs stick out on his chin like the
wires in a musical snuff-box. It is most amusing to watch him when
the razors are handed round. He will snatch one off the tray, draw the
edge across his nail, breathe upon it, then hold it up to the light. and,
after wiping it in the gentlest manner upon the cuff of his coat, bid for
it as ravenously as if he would not lose the scarce article for all the
wealth of the Minories. He has clearly a mania for razors.
What he does with all the articles he buys we cannot tell. If the
Pantechnicon were his, it would not be large enough to contain all the
rubbish he has been accumulating these last ten years. His collection
of sideboards alone would fill Hyde Park, and he must possess by this
time more dumb-waiters than there are real waiters in England. The
number of boot-jacks, also, which he must have upon his hands would
have crushed any other man long ago. How he stands up against this
daily accumulation of furniture is a trial of strength that but few men
in the City could endure Any body else's fortune would have been
broken with one half the load that he must have upon his mind... We
have actually seen him carry off six chests of drawers in one morning!

It may be that he gives a great deal away, for he is certainly very
liberal—otherwise what can he want with the innumerable work-boxes,
brooches, and thimbles he is for ever purchasing P. We are sure
the Capitalist of a Mock-Auction is a very fond husband, and that he
has a very large family of daughters, and that he never goes home to
the bosom of his family without some little trifle tucked under his arm,
to convince his dear wife, and each of his dear children, that, even in
the midst of his boundless speculations, his thoughts at times rest
lovingly upon them. -
#. č. at a Mock-Auction is calm, self-possessed, mild, affable,
and far from arrogant, as you would suppose from the enormity of his
wealth he must be. If a stranger comes into the arena of his many
triumphs, he gives way directly, and ceases bidding in his favour. Is
not this condescension in one who has only to nod, and the most
expensive article in the shop, nay, the entire shop itself, would be
immediately knocked down to him? -- --
You never would suppose from the Capitalist's appearance that, he
was so incalculably .. as he is. . His dress, it must be confessed, is
rather shabby. A rusty black suit is all that embellishes him, and his
dirty hands are ungloved. But these are little eccentricities that
Wealth is privileged to indulge in. . A man that spends, from £500 to
£2000 a day merely in trifles and elegancies can well afford to be a
little negligent in his person 1
The name of the Capitalist has always been a mystery. We have
watched him when a French clock, worth at least £80, has been
knocked down to him for £10, and waited in anxiety for him to pro-
nounce the mysterious name—but all in vain. A confidential smile was
all that passed between him and the Auctioneer, and the clock was put
on the .. In fact, his face is so familiar to every one connected with
the establishment, from the large purchases he is continually making,
that it is quite unnecessary for him to give his name, and yet, when we
asked one of the porters who he was, the stupid man could not
tell us. It is very strange that one who spends so much should be so
little known! - - --
As the clock struck five one day, we noticed the Capitalist was pre-
paring to go to his dinner. We followed him, and found ourselves
seated opposite to him in one of the many eating-houses that run round
the Poultry. We maturally expected he would order turtle, iced punch,
yenison, ortolans, young peas, every expensive delicacy of the season;
but will it be believed, that that great Capitalist, who had been lavishing
his hundreds all day, did not spend more than 143d, upon his dinner,
including his half-and-half and the waiter? -
He started home, but called for no cab. “Well, you are a curious
mixture,” thought we, “of extravagance and economy.” We walked
after him, in silent admiration. He stopped, in a bye-street, and
darted into one of the most wretched-looking houses. Soon afterwards
we spied a light at the top part of the house. “Is it possible,” we
could not help exclaiming, “that in that lonely garret lives one of the
greatest Capitalists of the present day Pº No wonder that he has not
room to accommodate all the sideboards he is perpetually buying !
This occurred a week ago. Since then we have had reason to suspect
the honesty, or, at least, the sanity, of our friend the Capitalist... Yester-
day we looked in at a Mock Auction. The indefatigable Capitalist
was there, as usual. A valuable mahogany sideboard had just been
knocked down to him for £1810s.
At twelve o’clock we passed again. Another sideboard was knocked
to him for £19 5s. -
At three we passed a third time, and again he had another sideboard
knocked down to him for £12 7s.6d. ; and on inspection we found he
had purchased three times over the same piece of furniture. He had
given upwards of £50 for the same sideboard | -
We suspected our man instantly. Our admiration fell into the gutter.
It was evident, he was no more a Capitalist than we were....He
was only playing the part of Rothschi LD for something like two shillings
a day. W. everything at a Mock-Auction is mock, from the Auc-
tioneer down to the Capitalist |
A Mockery, a Delusion, and a Snare.
WE perceive by the railway intelligence of the past week that one of
the large companies has given its resident engineer a portrait of himself
and £500 worth of stock at par. Considering that everything in the
Railway world is now at a tremendous discount, the presentation of
anything at parto anybody is like giving him a ravenous bear, for it is ten
to one but the shares will eat him up in future calls, to say nothing of
the actual difference between accepting at par what may be already at
discount. The portrait may give the affair a different complexion, and
at all events it is better to be done in oil than done in railway securities.
TEETH WARRANTED TO BITE.
FoR, the supply of lost teeth, never think of consulting a regular
practitioner in dental surgery. Go to an advertising dentist, who will
only charge you 20 guineas a set for teeth, which, you may depend upon
it, will certainly bite—the purchaser. One trial (which took º:
last week in a law court) will prove the fact.
A NOTE FROM ELYSIUM.
E see you here
every week, Mr.
Punch—indeed,
would it be Ely-
sium without
you—and,there-
fore, as a con-
stant reader,and
as ... a brother
quill, a brother
who was ever
proud of his bit
of goose—even
when Iwanted a
dinner—I have
to request a
word through
ou to the
- rotectionists.
Shades as we are, we are still susceptible of what you say of us above;
and feel as much delight when new editions of us come out, as I was
delighted in my bloom-coloured coat, made by JoHN FILEY, at the
Harrow, in Water Lane. If, then, we are pleasantly alive to a com-
pliment, we are no less susceptible of vulgar usage. We do not like
our lines pressed into wrongful service. It is a sort of moral forgery
...tº upon us, that stirs our ichor. Now, I who, whilst in your
world, was one of the least irritable of creatures, I, who had not adrop
of vanity of ink in my whole body—even I, am compelled to complain
of the treatment that my poetry daily sustains at the mouths of the
‘Protectionists,” as they call themselves. The ill-used lines—if I
remember them aright—are these:–
“‘Princes and lords may flourish and may fade,
A breath can make them as a breath has made.”
“Now, Mr. Punch, these Princes and Lords have been put upon such
hard service-have been so pawed and mauled about, that, I am sure of
it, they are by no means the same people that originally came out of my
ink-bottle. The Princes, are PRINCE PRETTYMANs, and the Lords,
LORD NOODLES. I protest, Mr. Punch, I will not endure this. Again:—
“But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
When once destroy'd can never be supplied.”
“My peasantry were sturdy, red-cheeked fellows, with smockfrocks
white as daisies on them,-- now, these ‘peasantry’ have been so
worked and belaboured at public meetings, that I shouldn’t know them

for new diversion. But no one, better than yourself, Punch, knows
that critics, like turtles, are very hard to kill. Like turtles, too, they
have been known to live for a long time without their brains.
“You would hardly know Johnson—he has turned so droll and
frisky. He is still attended by BARBER, his black servant; only he is
not black here, all being of the same colour in Elysium, a melancholy
fact that may cause very virtuous disgust in the bosom of THOMAs

publicly burnt here by an indignant flash from APOLLO—from that

at the expense of Boswell. “What,” says the Doctor, “What is
the cause of the scarcity of timber in Scotland?' Nobody could
guess it—not even MERCURy, “Why, Sirs, this—because every Scotch-

subject, an allegory of the Protecting Landlord and the Protected

THE DWARF AND THE GIANT.
WE never remember such a curious illustration of the old puff of
“Two Exhibitions in One,” as that afforded by the career of Louis
NAPOLEON. Little more than a year ago he was looked upon as a
political dwarf, and every body was laughing at the idea of sovery small
an object being placed in a conspicuous position, for it was felt almost
universally, that to elevate si peu de chose was not to uphold him, but to
hold him up to ridicule. France seemed to be acting the part of show-
man in the midst of the fantastic absurdities of its revolution, and
appeared to be crying out to the rest of ; “Walk up, here, walk
up. You are now in time to see the Republican dwarf, the smallest
President in the world. Walk up, and you will see a worthy follower
of the American GENERAL ToM THUMB, so famous for his miniature
copy of the EMPEROR NAPOLEoN.”
Scarcely six months, however, had elapsed, when the dwarf com-
menced shooting up in a manner that surprised the whole world, which
had not been prepared for the upshot. Time's telescope has since
acted as a magnifying glass of the most extraordinary power, for when
at the close of 1849 we look at the dwarf of 1848, we find that he has
cutgrown all knowledge, and if he should out-grow his own strength,
his rapid aggrandisement will prove in the end to have been a
growing evil.
It is not surprising that a man, who seems to place no limits to his
own political growth, should refuse to be restricted by any measures
whatever. We never saw a more complete instance of an ell having
been taken, where only an inch was intended to be given.
- ISLE OF DOGS A PENAL SETTLEMENT.
As it appears that all our Colonies have given notice to EARL GREY
that none of our convicts shall lodge and board with them, it has been
determined by the Colonial Minister to make the Isle of Dogs a penal
settlement. It is calculated that the island will accommodate, well-
packed, about 100,000 felons. All communication will be cut off with
the island, and a cordon sanitaire established upon the opposite shores.
We are further enabled to inform our readers that MR. GeoRGE
HUDson, newly-cleansed and sweetened for the office, will be appointed
Governor of the Island, with permission occasionally to hoist his flag—
three stags in a field improper—on board the Wye. Government engi-
neers and architects have been ordered to the island, to make the
necessary preparations, and to commence the building of a mansion for
the Governor. The mansion, it is understood, will be of the I. O. Unic
order, faced—and very boldly faced—with composition.
A Coroner on Fire.
THE Coroner for the City of London is so warm in his official zeal,
that he insists upon sitting on every fire he hears of. Some people
object to his doing so, and he no sooner sits upon a fire than he finds
himself hauled over the coals, rather unceremoniously. His Salaman-
drine ambition proves a spirit deeply imbued with the philosophy of
Hobbs, and there is no doubt that, in sitting upon a fire, he feels he has
an additional range—though sometimes a kitchen range—of usefulness.
The Coroner takes very goodtemperedly all the remarks made upon his
alleged officiousness, and indeed it is not surprising that a functionary,
who is always ready to sit upon a fire, should not be easily put out, and
requires a great deal of cold water to be thrown upon him, before his
enthusiasm is completely damped.
THE RAILWAY SHARE-MARKET,
A slight rise in the price of Nº. has fiº. an impetus to
almost every description of Railway Shares: and there is no doubt
that when some of the heavier stock—the coarse cartridge paper—has
been cleared off, the heavier railway stock will sympathise,

THE HEALTH OF EUROPE DURING THE LAST WEEK.
FRANCE is excessively weak, and her constitution is gradually break-
ing up. She says she has the weight of a mountain on her breast that
prevents her rising. She still complains bitterly of the great vacuum

Russia has been troubled with a slight attack of yellow fever,
Bleeding was recommended, and was instantly carried out to a copious
extent in the City. Russia has felt very much better since, and is
very thankful to England for the unexpected relief.
Austria is, endeavouring to regain the strength she has lost in
Hungary. She is still stunned with the dreadful blow she received
there, which was nearly the death of her. She is recommended to keep
quiet for some time to come. -
England is collecting her members together, and rubbing them up

GENEROUS REDUCTION OF RENT.
MR. John O'Connell, held his meeting of tenants in Dublin, last
week. It was not very numerously assembled, for we doubt if the
number of his tenants exceeded ten. MR. JoHN, O'ConnELL said he
would detain them but a few minutes. He then began a speech which
lasted two hours. In the course of it he said, “He had heard a great
deal of the hardness of the times, and he must say they were particu-
larly hard upon him, for let him work as hard as he would, he could
hardly make a decent penny. As for Repeal, it was fairly, reduced to
its last penny. What did he make last week? Why only tempence-
halfpenny! And the week before? Why, nothing but a dirty fourpenny-
bit ! He should like to reduce their rents, but, in the face of such
terrible truths, how could he do it? . However, he was the last man to
tax their good-nature, and so he would leave the matter entirely to their
generosity. As for himself, he didn’t ask for anything ! They might
give exactly what they pleased.” (Tremendous checring, which lasted
several minutes.)
After this the Meeting separated, and we are hº to state that in
consequence of the liberal proposal of MR. JoHN O'CONNELL, every one
availed himself of it; ºf as the rent was left entirely to them, they
thought the best thing was to leave it alone. The amount of “Rent,”
therefore, collected at the doors did not exceed a penny postage stamp
i. there are some strong doubts whether that has not been use

of feznts and woodcox, which you sent us, both for the attention
which was dellygit, and because the burds was uncommon good and

but in my time I thought the fun didn't begin until the great folks had
gone away. Give my kind suvvices to MRs. LUPIN, and tell MUNSEER

it interfears very much with my abbits and ixpeshly is not plesnt
dareckly after dinner to set hoff to a cold theayter for a middle-
Hage Mann, who likes to take things heazy; yet, my dear feller,
I do from time to time step in (with a horder) to the walls of the

JEAMEs and the younguns, sometimes to wild away a hidle hour when
shes outatown or outatemper (which sometimes will, ocur in the best
reglated famlies you know) or when some private mellumcolly or sorrer
of my own is a hagitating hof me.
“Yesdy evening it was none of these motifs which injuiced me to go
to the theayter—I had heard there was a commady jest brought out,
inwolving the carrickter of our profession—that profeshn] which you

“My dear RINCER. I greave to say, that though there was nothink
against our purſeshn said in the pease—and though the most delligit
and sensatif footman (and Ive known no men of more dellixy of feelin
and sensabillaty than a well reglated footman is whether hin or hout of

our beloved purſeshn.
“The plot of the Pease is founderd upon a hancient Lor, which the
Hauther, MR. Buckstone, discovyred in an uncommon hold book, and
by which it epears, that in Lip-Year (or whats called Bissixdile in
Istronnamy). it is the women who have the libbaty of choosing their
usbands, and not as in hornary times, the men who choose their wives
(I rºckmend you old feller who are a reglar hold Batchylor, to look out
in the Ormnack for Lip Year, and kip hout of the way that year) and
this pragtice must be common anough in Hengland, for a commady is a
reprasentation of natur, and in this one, every one of the women asts
every one of the men to marry: igsept one, and she asts two of em.
“Onst upon a time, there was an old genlm.n by the name of
FLOWERDEw as married a young woman, who became in consguince
MRS, FLORA Flow ERDEw. She made this hold buck so Appy during
the breaf coarse of his meddrimonial career, that he left a will, horder.

“His widder didn't cry much (for betwigst you and me F. must have
been rayther a silly old feller), but lived on in a †. manner in a
house somewhere in the drecshon of Amstid I should think, entertaining
her frends like a lady: and like a lady she kep her coachman and groom :
had her own maid, a cook & housemaid of coarse, a page and a MANN.
“If I had been a widder I would have choas a Man of a better Ithe,
than MRs. FLOWERJEw did. Nothink becomes a footman so much as
Ithe. Its that which dixtinguidges us from the wulgar, and I greave to
say in this pedicklar the gentleman as hacted WILLIAM WALKER, MRs. Fºs
man, was sadly defishnt. He was respeckble, T. horderly, hactive
—but his figger I must say was no go. You and me RINCER ave seen

Purty a settling his skower in my Barr which kep me a cumsederable

“MRs. KEAN, she was the widdo, and MR.K. he was WILLIAM the man.
He wasnt a Buttler dear RINCER like U. He wasnt groom of the
Chimbers like MR. MEwT at my Lords (to whomb my best com-
plymince), he wasnt a mear footman, he wasnt, a page; but, he was
a mixter of all 4. He had trowzies like a page with a red strip; he had a
coat like a Hunndress John; he had the helegant mistary of MR. MEWT,
and there was a graceful abanding and a daggijay hair about him which
I whish it was more adopted in our purfeshn.
“Haltho in hour time, dear RINCER, we didn quoat ByROM and
SHIKSPYER in the droring-room to the ladies of the famly, praps things

potry.—Well, for sevral years, during which he had been in MRs. F.'s
service, WALKER had been goin on in this manner, and it was heasy at
once to see at the very hopening of the pease, from the manner of missis
and man, that there was more than the common sewillaties of a lady and
a genlman in, livary goin on between em, and in one word that they
were pashintly in love with each other. This wont surprize you
RINCER, my boy; and in the coarse of my expearance I might tell a
story or two—O LADY HARABELLAR but Honor forbids, and Im
mumm.
“Several shutors come to whoo the widow; but none, and no great
wonder, have made an impreshn on her heart. Qne she takes, as a
husband on trial—and he went out to dinner on the very fust day of
his apprentiship, and came home intogsicated. Another whomb she
would not have, a Captain in the Harmy, pulls out a bill when she
refuses him, and requestes her to pay for his loss of time, and the
clothes he has hordered in horder to captivate her. Finely the piece
hends by the widdo proposing to WILLIAM WALKER, her servant, and
marrying that pusson.
“I don’t hask whether widdos take usbands on trial. I do not pores
to inquier whether Captings, send in bills of costs for courtship, or

so. Among the acknowledgments of those unaccountable remittances of conscience-money
§ ºnment which are almost daily published in the Times, it was notified the other
ay, that- -
“The Chaxcellor of * Exchequea has received from T. C. D. the first halves of Bank notes for £60,
remitted as a sum considered to be owing to Government.”

A. Curling Match on the Ice.
A correspond ENT, whose stupid head ought to be brought at once to the barber's block,
has written to us to know what is the meaning of the recent Curling Match on the ice, between
the EARL of MANspield and the EARL or EGLINton. Our correspondent, to whom, we should
bevery sorry to correspond in any particular, is imbecile enough to ask us how it happens that
the noble Earls, who must have so many other irons in the fire, can procure time topop a pair
of curlingirons into the fire also: We will not condescend to explain to our feeble-minded
correspondent that “curling” is a fine old sport, very different from the effeminate practice
of twisting the hair into ringlets; and we can only add, that if he could now beholdus, he would
witness a specimen of another kind of curling, for he would see our lip in the very stiffest curl
of contempt at his—anything but—“blessed” ignorance.

THE RASH REFORMERS OF DOWNING
STREET.
It has been stated, on authority, that Minis-
ters mean to bring forward this session a scheme
of their own for the re-adjustment of the parlia-
mentary representation; as, by the time these
words come fairly before, the universe, will
probably have been signified in the speech from
the Throne. We hope LoRD, John Russell,
and his colleagues will do nothing rash in the
attempt to improve our talorious Constitution.
But we fear that their measure of reform will be
too sweeping. For instance, we are afraid that
they will fix the pecuniary qualification to vote,
at too low a figure, and depart, too widely from
the good old principle of making money the
criterion of ability to exercise the franchise.
We are apprehensive that they will give an
insufficient preference to breeches-pockets over
brains in determining the standard of elective
rights. Nay, we are not without dread that
they will be so precipitate and reckless as to
allow every respectable man a vote provided he
is a taxpayer, and can write his name, and read
a column of Punch. We think it too probable, 1.
also, that they will be for approaching. more .
nearly than they ought, to an equalisation of
electoral districts, and granting constituencies
of equal populations, representatives in unduly
small disproportion. e are further alarmed
lest they should concede the ballot, or devise
some other inconveniently stringent security
against bribery, corruption, and intimidation-
In short, we tremble with the expectation that
they will go too fast and too far, and confer
more political power on HER MAJESTY's subjects
at large than, the bulk of the people wish to be
entrusted with.

NOOKS AND CORNERS OF CHARACTER.—THE CHARWOMAN.
F.there is one person more than another whose
life is regularly passed in Nooks and Corners, it
is the Charwoman's Her sun, it may be said,
rises in a cobweb, and sets in a cupboard.
She knows more of a house than the mistress
herself. Its most inmost recesses are laid bare
to her. Not a floor but what has disclosed its
segrets—not aboudoir, not a consulting-room, not
a family sanctuary, however private, but has made
a clean breast to her, and felt all the better
afterwards for the confession. This confidence,
however, is never very well repaid, for it is seldom

to know where to find her. Washerwomen,

the top bell,” flashes upon our recollection.
Be it modesty, or a horror of the income-tax,

but there is decidedly a great difficulty in find.
ing out the abode of the Charwoman. Like Echo,
she is to be “heard of" in the circle of a large
neighbourhood, but no one can tell the precise
spot where she dwells. The only chance is by
ºnquiry of the milkwoman, or the butcher, or the baker, who enquires of hisman, who says he'll ask his “good'ooman,” who he thinks knows aneigh-
bour that can let MRs. GRIMEs know that “she is wanted,”—and it is only by this º fashion that MRs. GRIMEs eventually turns up.
But when MRs. GRIMEs has once promised to come, she is sure to come. We never knew a Charwoman yet break her appointment.

Nothing but her own death, we think, would make her do it. Sherings the bell before the “milk,” even before the “sweeps.”
Her social position is not to be envied much. She is the lowest grade of domestic—even lower than the maid of all work, to whom she
ºfficiates as a sort of maid of all work herself. , Mistresses have but little love for her, for she is never called in but at the last extremity, and the
house is never comfortable til she is out of it. Her reverses in the course of the day are endless, but she must bear every little turn of
fortune wiſh cool equapimity, even if it be the fate of her º to be violently kicked down stairs by coming in contact with master's indignant boot.
How."master” does hate her, to be sure! With the mistress it is simply an antipathy, only agenteel aversion; but if she were abailiff, or
a mad bull, or a fire in the house, there could not be a stronger desire on the part of “master” to have her instantly put out. He knows there
is no comfort, no luncheon, no dinner, no answering the bell, as long as the Charwoman is pattering, steaming, ºf: slopping about, from
o
one room into another. He hates the clatter of her pattens—for Charwomen are still shod with these detestable irons
es—and woe to them
if he finds them lying about the hall! The chances are that they part, never to meet again. - -
She slaves, and yet never gives satisfaction. She is expected to do the work of six days in one. Let her come with daybreak, and
leave close upon the stroke of midnight, she can never do all the work that is required of her. She pleases no º Even the servants take a
pleasure in finding fault with her. She is disowned by the very person who has engaged her. No lady, talks of “her Charwoman, any lore
than agentleman breathes a word about “his pawnbroker.” The nearest admission that is ever made to the fact of her existence is that “MRs.
GRIMEs has come to assist.” And yether characteristics are sopatent that none but a Countess,who had been confined all her life inadrawing-room,
could pºssibly be deceived as to her appearance. The dirty mob-cap, the battered bonnet, generally black, that perches on the top of it, the
soiled ribbons that, sun, or rain, are never tied-the tucked-up gown, and bare arms, that are of an unpleasant redness all the way up to the
sleeve.-are so many witnesses making oath to her identity. - - - - - -
The Charwoman, it must be confessed, is of a most forgiving disposition. Loaded, as she is, with the insults of the entire house, she is
too willing to help any one. She fetches the beer, lays the cloth-washes the plates—toasts the muffins, &c., and waits at table until the
servants have their dinner or tea, before she touches a scrap herself. She addresses JEAMEs, and the clerical-looking Butler, as “Sir;” and
Cook, and my Lady's-maid, are always spoken to as “Ma’am.” And yet, strange to say, the Charwomanis, intºn cases out ºf a dozen, a decayed
servant hºrself. She has generally sayed a little money—married a speculative Johnsy-soon lost all in the greenline, and become “the
drab ºf a thing” that she in her proud prosperity snarled at and snubbed. (Moral (aside): "Be kind to your inferiors. ) -
There are many more strange. Nooks and Corners to be found in the character of the Charwoman, but we have not time to explore them just
now, much less space to record the result of our discoveries. We must throw down, therefore, without comment, the following fugitive
facts, which we cannot help catching as they buzz in our ears, and fly in our faces, with all the impudence of London blue-bottles. -
The Charwoman averages from 40 to 60. She has a remarkably good a petite, and can eat anything... She wears large pockets, which
keep gradually swelling towards night-time, and has a penchant for snuff, which she carries in a screw of brown paper. Report declares
that she smokes, but as this habit is never allowed to interfere with her avocations, we have no right to enquire into the rumour.
She has a large family, but they are rigidly forbidden the house she is “charing” at. The same law is enforced against her husband, but
quite unnecessarily, as he has too much sense to show himself. It is supposed he has some post in a public Pillar, or Monument, or Light-
house, or in the Police, for he is never seen from one year's end to another. - -
There are many speculations as to the honesty of the Charwoman, but she is poor, and therefore we must not wonder at her being sus:
pected. The “Ladies” down stairs, however, always lock up their tea-caddies, JEAMEs counts his spoons, Cook, hides her kitchen-stuff,
and Missus, makes a general clearance, whenever Mrs. GRIMEs comes to stop for a day. Whatever is missing, the Charwoman is sure to be
the thief. Everything that is broken is without failthe.handiwork of her fingers. The Charwoman is invariably the Catfor the week after her visit.
And for all her trials, labours, snubbings, and accusations, she has but one compensation, and that is a dish of tea: , The Saucer is the
Lęthe in which she drowns all the cares of the day. Buttered toast, and tea! Give her plenty of butter, º of thick toast, and ponds
of strong tea, and she is happier than any bride at a wedding feast. As she lifts the brimming saucer, time after time, to her thirsty º she
pours out the experiences of her profession. A fresh family is cut up with each new slice of foast-the scandal of the whole neighbourhood is
firred up, though not much sweetened, and handed round, for the tastes of her kitchen audience. For if there is an Inquisitor in an
Englishwoman’s fº. it is the Charwoman, for she has the entrée of every house, and, as you sit in the parlour, there she is accumulating
evidence against you under your very feet. Ladies, both in the parlour and the pantry, should beware of this secret tribunal, which runs from
parish to parish, and speaks of them, according as they behave to that universal outcast, that out-door drudge, that “general sweeping-
machine,” that hardest-worked servant of servants, the Charwoman.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REAL STAFF OF LIFE.
IMPORTANT MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST.S.
YESTERDAY a numerously attended meeting of gentlemen holding
the doctrines of Socialism and Communism took place at the For under.
the-Rose. Among the company we observed some of the most notorious
rogues in the metropolis. Owing to the admirable arrangements of the
police, there occurred no interruption of the proceedings.
The chair was taken by a MR. Moopy, a personage with a hideous
expression of countenance, and a great beard.
he CHAIRMAN briefly stated that the object of the meeting was to
consider what cºurse to take with regard to the Protectionist agitation
excited among the agriculturists by the aristocracy. He believed there
º a good time coming, and they'd ave to wait but a very little
onger.
MR. MoRDINs hated the aristocracy with all his heart and soul.
(Hear) But he would hold a candle to a duke—or to a wuss than
a duke-to light him to play his (MR. Mobbins's) game. The cry of
Protection to Agriculture was askin' of Parliament to raise rents by
checkin' competition. There was no difference between that and askin'
Parliament to raise wages by the same means. (Hear.) Except this.
The rent was to be screwed out of the poor man's loaf, for the idle;
whereas the wages was to be took out of the rich man's income for the
industrious. What was Socialism but Protection for everybody! The
base aristocracy was pullin' in the same boat with theirselves. He
would say, “Pull away, my harpies!” (Laughter.) He was for pullin'
along with them so long as they was a steerin’ the same course. (Hear)
When done with, he'd fling 'em overboard. (Tremendous Cheering.) He
would move—
“That Protection to Agriculture being a legislative interference with Competition, its
principle is, in the opinion of this here meeting, hidentical with that of Communism and
Socialism.
The resolution was seconded by MR. WILDGoose, and carried
zººm. cont.
MR. FIREDRAKE would clapse the Protectionist aristocrats in is open
harms. (Oh, oh!). The Protectionists were turning, not only Communists
and Socialists, but regularjolly Red Republicans. What did MR. Cheet-
HAM say the other day at the West Norfolk Meeting * “If he were in
PEEL's position he should be afraid of the poniard and dagger, and so
he had a right to.” (Prolonged cheering.) He (MR. FIREDRAKE) was glad
to hear respeciable farmers begin to talk about poniards and daggers.
CUFFY, his self, never beat that. Then, at the same meeting, Mr.
Bowy ER SMYTH, and MR. BAGGE, cursed free-trade and PEEL; the
rest, swearing in chorus with 'em, and MR. FRANKLIN, a parson, as
ood as sayin' Amen This was roaring worthy of the Mountain. (Hear.)
i. them flare up, then, and jine the Protectionists. Protection now
and the Democratic and Social Republic for ever! He would call
upon them to resolve—
“That the best course as can be adopted by the Communists and Socialists for the
promotion of their ulterior objects, is that of fraternising for the present with the
Protectionists.”
The resolution having been seconded by MR. BRIxton BEDLAM, and
carried by acc -
Three cheers were given for Loºp STANLEY and M. Louis BLANC;
for M. PRoudmon and the Duke of RICHMOND; for MR. Dismaeli
and LEDRU Boulin; for SIR. J. TYRELL and M. Raspall, and for
SERJEANT Borchot and Colon ELSIBTHoRP.
After which, thanks having been voted to the Chairman, the meeting
separated, and we came away—without our handkerchief.
* A WICTIM TO LET.”
OUR wrong-headed, good-natured friend, with a long signature,
who in the Herald abused poor Punch, simply, we take it, because it
was not in the dull man's brainto understand truth when edged with
satire—and therefore incontinently cut his fingers with it—our
friend has gone beyond his liberal promise, and sent his second E25 to
HowLETT, the dismissed postman, even though no intervening sum of
£25 has been subscribed. Howiett, however, is the richer man by
£50, for his benefactor’s misinterpretation of Punch, who stung dulness
into liberality. Punch complains not. He is willing to be misunder-
stood, when the error bears such golden fruit to the destitute. Never-
|theless, Punch marvels at the meaning of HowLETT's benefactor, when
he says–
“The philosopher Punch shows how relentless are his orders from head-quarters, by
still maintaining, against the plainest evidence, that HowLETT was ‘rightly dis-
missed.'"
Again:-
“Neither will the public accept (at least as a reason why they should quietly submit
to the demolition of their Sabbath) of Punch's testimonial—[Is the Sabbath so broken to
bits by Lord John?]—however true it may be—that “Loºp John Russen is a man of
earnest and unaffected religion." Far be it from me to say that such is not the case; but
it is impossible not to see what these words meanin Punch's use of them."
Firstly, Punch confesses that it is always his desire, moreover
always his practice, to write from “head-quarters:” namely, from all
the quarters of his own head. --- -- -
Secondly, If, as our dullfriend confesses at the last, “it is impossible
not to see” what Punch means—if this be really true in the particular
case of our obtuse reviler,--we congratulate him on his amended
intelligence. It is quite worth the £50 he has given, to Howrºtt,
who, we trust, will make the best and most profitable uses of the
benefaction.
*SPEAKING DAGGERS.”
ONE MR. CHEETHAM, a Protectionist (not a bad name for a small
corn party) at the Oakham Meeting, said:
“He could not help thinking that phantoms of ruined farmers would haunt the
sleeping pillow of Sir R. PREL. Knowing how much he was execrated, he should think
he must move about in fear and dread. Even if Sir R. Peel should have a majority
again, he dared not take office. He (MR. Curztnam) knew that if he was in Sir R.
º position, he should be afraid of the poniard and the dagger, and so he had a
right.
Since the awful, but no less popular appearance, of “Giles Scroggins'
Ghost"—sung at all the playhouses—we can conceive nothing, in even
an agricultural sense, more harrowing than the “phantoms, of ruine
farmers,” all with shadowy pitchforks, and moonshine flails, threatening
the “sleeping pillow” (why are not pillows wide-awake?) of SIR
RoBERT PEEL. Done into a comic song, GILEs Scroggins would be
laid for ever. -
But one word with MR CHEETHAM. A person who talks of poniards
and daggers, expressing his ready belief that a man “has a right” to
fear them, may—by the unreflecting—be thought to be the very sort of
person who would not hesitate to use them. Let MR. CHEETHAM, in
the matter of speculative assassination, hold his tongue, if he would hold
his character.
A Gross IMPOSITIon.
MR. DISRAELI, in his Speech on the Address, declared that “What
the land now wants is simple justice.” We are no agriculturists, but
we should say that the land was in want of something besides justice
just now—we mean better cultivation. If this were carried out to a
large extent, the land would not have reason to complain, even though
it should be a good deal put upon.

THE BALLAD OF ELIZA. DAVIS.
MR. FERRAND MISINTERPRETED.
At a late Protection, and very Free Speech Meeting, MR.
FERRAND developed yearnings that must have touched the
sympathies of MR. CALCRAFT of the Old Bailey, provided that
functionary ever amuses his grim leisure with anything .so
solemn as MR. FERRAND's orations. MR. FERRAND, assuming
that, some day—the date not named—corn and cotton woul
come to a fight, and that CoBDEN-(cotton being down)–
would become prisoner to corn, declared it to be his intention
—ready-made and home-made—to hang CopDEN to the next
tree, compelling John BRIGHT-on pain of hanging too, “like
twin cherries on one stalk”—to do #. as executioner.
A few days after, a MR. WoRTLEy, at Hailsham, an orator of
the like fire with Ferrand—a companion lucifer from the same
bundle—prayed for CoBDEN that he- -
“Living, may forfeit fair renown;
And, doubly dying, may go down
To the vile earth from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.”
MR. FERRAND, reading the above, immediately dispatched
a little note—full of amenity—to the speaker; a note running
as follows:—
“My dear Sir, –I have read your speech at Hailsham with
great delight. Permit me, however, to suggest when you
repeat it—and Protection, I fear, has but one string to its
fiddle-that you improve the last line of the quotation to adapt
it the better to the spirit of our cause. Let it run thus:—
“‘Unwept, unhonoured, Not unhung.'
“Believe me, my dear Sir, with sentiments of admiration
arising from kindred feelings,
“Yours, faithfully ever,
“Mr. Wortley.” “B. FERRAND.”
ALLIANT gents and lovely ladies,
List a tail vich late befel,
Vich I heard it, bein on duty,
At the Pleace Hoffice, Clerkenwell.
Fº you know the Fondling Chapel,
ere the little children i. ;
(Lor! I likes to hear on Sundies
Them there pooty little things')
In this street there lived a housemaid,
If you particklarly ask me where—
Vy, it was at four-and-twenty,
Guilford Street by BrunswickSquare.
Vich her name was ELIZA DAVIs,
And she went to fetch the beer:
In the street she met a party
As was quite surprized to see her.
Vich he was a British Sailor,
For to º: him by his look:
Tarry ſº et, canvass trowsies,
Ha-la MR. T. P. CookE.
Presently this Mann accostes
Of this hinnocent young gal—
Pray, saysee, Excuse my freedom,
ou’re so like my Sister SAL |
You’re so like my Sister SALLY,
Both in valk and face and size;
Miss, that—dang my old lee scuppers,
It brings tears into my heyes!
I’m a mate on board a wessel,
I’m a sailor bold and true;
Shiver up my poor old timbers,
Let me be a mate for you!
What’s your name, my beauty,tell me?
And she faintly hansers, “ Lore,
Sir, my name’s ELIZA DAVIs,
And I live at twenty-four.”
Hofttimes came this British seaman,
This deluded gal to meet:
And at twenty-four was welcome,
Twenty-four in Guilford Street.
And ELIZA told her Master,
(Kinder they than Missuses are),
How in marridge he had ast her,
Like a galliant Brittish Tar.
And he brought his landlady with him,
(Wich was all his hartful plan),
And she told how CHARLEY THoMPson
Reely was a good young man.
And how she herself had lived in
Many years of union sweet,
With a gent she met promiskous,
Walkin in the public street.
And ELIZA listened to them, .
And she thought that soon theirbands
Would be published at the Fondlin,
Hand the clergyman jine their ands.
And he ast about the lodgers,
(Vich her master let some rooms),
Likewise vere they keptheir things, and
Were her master kep his spoons.
Hand this vicked CHARLEY THOMPson
Came on Sundy week to see her,
And he sent ELIZA DAVIs
Hout to fetch a pint of beer.
Hand while pore ELIZA vent to
Fetch the beer, dewoid of sin,
This etrocious CHARLEY THOMPson
Let his wile accomplish hin.
To the lodgers, their apartments,
This abandingd female goes,
Prigs their shirts and umberellas:
Prigstheirboots,andhats,andclothes.
Wile the scoundrleCHARLEYTHOMPson,
Lest his wictim should escape,
Hocust her with rum and water,
Like a fiend in huming shape. .
But a hi was fixt upon 'em
Vich these raskles little sore;
Namely, MR. HIDE the landlord,
Of the house at twenty-four.
He was valkin in his garden,
Just afore he vent to sup;
And on looking up he sor the
Lodger's vinders lighted hup.
Hup the stairs the landlord tumbled;
Something's going wrong, he said;
And he caught the vicked woman
Underneath the lodger's bed.
And he called a brother Pleaseman,
Vich was passing on his beat;
Like a true and galliant feller,
Hup and down in Guilford Street.
And that Pleaseman able-bodied
Took this woman to the cell;
To the cell vere she was quodded,
In the Close of Clerkenwell.
And thoughvicked CHARLEY THOMPSON
Boulted like a miscrant base,
Presently another Pleaseman
Took him to the self-same place.
And this precious pair of raskles
Tuesday last came up for doom;
By the beak they was committed,
| Wich his name was MR. CoMBE.
| Has for poor ELIZA DAVIs,
Simple gurl of twenty-four,
She, I ope, will never listen
In the streets to sailors moar.
But if she must ave a sweet-art,
(Wich most every gurl expex,)
Let her take a jolly pleaseman;
Wich is name peraps is
Glut of Officials in France.
The Bank Coffers!
SUCH is the competition for employment in the financial department
of France, that the authorities declare their inability to read the appli-
cations, much less to answer the applicants. French finance has got
into such a state that it would seem to have been nobody’s business,
and as nobºdy's business is everybody’s business, everybody is now
offering to look after it. We should say that, as far as capacity goes,
the whole of the public would be about upon an equality, for every one
seems . incapable of finding a remedy for the financial difficulties
of the republic. In a case that really looks like one in which nothing
can be done, those who are competent to the doing of nothing maturally
feel themselves as well adapted as the rest of the community for giving
their services.
We have heard, so much, and we hear so frequently, about the
Coffers of the Bank, that our curiosity is rising to a tremendous pitch
about these mysterious articles. How much will a Coffer hold? How
many Coffers have they got at the Bank, and if all the Coffers should
happen to be “chuck” full, where do they chuck the surplus bullion?
Our early and infantine idea of a Coffer was, that it is an affair some:
thing like a coal scuttle, and that there is always one standing full of
bullion under the side-board in that most wonderful apartment, the
Bank parlour. We shall be º to accept an invitation from the
Governor of the Bank, to go over that establishment, any day when he
happens to have nothing to do, and when the Coffers, regularly polished
and sand-papered up for the occasion, may be placed before us.

SIGNS OF THE TIMES.
From “The Original Brown Bear.” Piccadilly, to the Emperor
of all the Russias, Greeting. >
IGHTY CzAR,
“FROM my
public and el-
evated posi-
tion Isee and
hear a thing
or two that’s
goling on, -
and I do as-
sure you, tre-
mendous Au-
tocrat, that,
whatever that
Cobden may
say to the
contrary, you
= are very high-
ly spoken of
by many peo-
º
olks of sub-
stance, with
money they
don’t know well how to lay out at decent interest—and your loan
praised and taken accordingly.
“Two or three merchants (with oranges and hundred-bladed pen-
knives) who trade under me at the short stages and "busses, are par-
ticularly disgusted with that Cotton CoBTEN, whose unadorned elo-
quence thought to re-button thousands of pockets that were open and
gaping, and ready to pour forth their blood in the cause of five per
cent., and for the glory of your Czarship. The chances were—thought
CoBDEN—that a lumping lot of the loan would be left on the hands
of the contractors; for he hoped to demolish the reputation of my
Nicholas. He dared to insinuate that even an Emperor might be
insolvent or unprincipled; that even the magnificent two-headed eagle
—with, of course, two stomachs to match—might be little better than
a felonious ie. He insinuated the probability—I shudder as much
as bear can shudder, and growl again with indignation at the thought—
the probability that the glorious Czar might be very liable to pick aquarrel
with England for the purpose of swindling the English bondholder, when
he promised that Woolwich arsenal should afford no assistance in the
recovery of the debt—no cannon-balls be served as writs, and no
execution be levied in the shape of squadrons. All this is disgusting
–mischievous. But these calumnies have not worked upon the virtuous,
but timid people, hungry for five per cent, who need not now continue
to satisfy themselves with three, or at best, three-and-a-half.
“Wain is the craft of the demagogue ! Good, excellent men, good in
themselves, and doubtless excellent as trustees, anxious to obtain the
best interest for their clients, the widowed and the orphaned, have gone
into Russian bonds: they have trusted their gold to paper ships, and
their confidence is very becoming, graceful to themselves, and
no doubt profitable to the Emperor. -
“Nevertheless-my NICHOLAs-that arch-agitator CoBDEN has
dared to hint the probability of the death of a Czar of all, the Russias!
As if an Emperor was ever known to die, -especially in Russia!
Nevertheless, the atrocious idea has entered Cobden's dark mind, and
revelling, in the thought, he has painted to a timid, money-loving
people, the possibility of the Emperor's successor repudiating the loan
contracted by his then sainted parent!
“Iquite agree with the Morning Post—one of the newsmen just under
me read the passage that—
“‘There is not half the difference which superficial observers mightimagine between
the gangs of MAzzINI, who yelled their ribald jest at the window where MADAME Rossi
was watching the body of her murdered husband, and the demure gentlemen who con-
gregated to hear Copoºn's hints about the uncertainty of the Czar's life. The Italian
villains certainly wanted one useful vice of their English friends, namely, hypocrisy.'
“‘The uncertainty of the Czar’s life!” Why, let ’em canvass London
Assurance Offices, and see if a Czar's life isn’t a life held as immortal
as the life of Phoenix at the office of that name. Ask whether, the life
offered, the Amicable would not embrace it—the Anchor drop upon
it—the Argus look with all its eyes delighted at it—the Atlas, with new
joy. at his heart, sustain it—the Britannia, like a sister, hug it—the
Pelican, with its best blood, foster it? The Emperor's life, say I–the
Emperor's justice! Why, in Russia, when was ever life sacrificed–
when, in any sense, hempen or otherwise, was PETER ever robbed to
pay PAULP
“And then, my CzAR, "what apother,” as MR. BARABBAs, the orange-
man, observed, ‘about the morality of the loan.’ What a joke! Where,
I should like to know, is the morality in money? Whereabouts, in his
anatomy, the heart of PLUTUs? “In a purely commercial country,’
|
| observed MR. Cosey to MR. CRUMBs, both waiting for a Kensington’bus
|- in a purely commercial country, the breeches' pocket has no morals.
This is a sentence to be written in letters of diamond over the architrave
of every Exchange, and to be bowed to-as the Persian bows to the
riº. every broker and merchant, at least once in the morning.’
“‘What matters it to the lender, who gets his interest, rejoined
CRUMBs to Cosey, “how money is employed? Consider ten hundred
thousand P. as an army of a hundred thousand men-accoutred
and armed to murder, burn, and pillage. What of it P. The English
moralist sleeps comfortably in his bed, and what matters to him how his
hundred pounds earn their yearly interest of five P , Pecunia non olet.
The money may certainly be steeped in the blood of Poland, and may
pass through the fires of Hungary, -again, I demand, what of it? The
five per cent. is paid, and—no questions ought to be asked, at least, Sir-
but here’s our 'bus—at least in a commercial country.”
“I—the ee in the opinions of MR. BARABBAs, that the loan
is perfectly moral, because commercially profitable. “As for abusing
the BRoth ERs BARING, why, Sir, it’s all very well,” said HUNKs to
CLose, waiting for a Hammersmith—“all very well, but all cant. . In a
commercial country, people would prefer 5 per cent. through the hands
of the Brothers. CAIN to 4% from the Brothers ABEL.' . . . -

To MR. CoEDEN.
DEAR SIR,
THE following questions—of a nature very similar to those to
which you alluded the other day at Manchester—are a few out of many
that I have been desired to ask you by certain country correspondents,
who don’t seem to approve of you very much.
In advocating Free Trade, Peace, and Financial Reform, are you
really actuated by a feeling of hostility to the nobility and gentry, oc.
casioned by an affront received by you in early life from somebody of
the superior classes? If so, how were your feelings hurt? -
When you were sent by your employers to wait upon a Duke with
some patterns, did his Grace tell a menial to take you down stairs, and
give you some beer?
Is it true that a young lady of rank boxed your ears for making her
an offer over the counter?
Did a noble Marquess offend you by offering you sixpence in return
for helping him on with his great coat? -
Is your antipathy to the military profession, in particular, owing to
a Colonel of Dragoons having once requested you to hold his horse?
Perhaps you will be so kind as to answer these enquiries at Your
perfect convenience. Perhaps you may be of opinion that their best
answer would be one such as I saw some time since among the Notices
to Correspondents in a sporting paper—“X. Y. Z. is an Ass.”
Your sincere well-wisher,
33832CA3.
VERY STRANGE, BUT VERY TRUE.-The electric telegraph is now
one of the really sovereign powers by which the world is governed, and
though civilisation, with a thousand other blessings, may be said to be
advanced by the potent engine, it must be admitted that wherever
the electric telegraph holds its sway, it rules with rods of iron.

the Person Applying should show a Testimonial for Clean Hands, it is indis-
pensable that Parties appear on the Canvas and the Hustings without Gloves.

sinuations that the official voice of the Usher should be finally
hushed, and limited henceforth to the narrow arena of the domestic
circle. Malicious stories, are in circulation about an alleged
shakiness in the hand, while handing in a compute, and there are
sinister allegations afloat that the gown of legal stuff—and non-
sense—should be laid aside at once for the º: of privacy.
We have watched BUGGINs for years—
do in Court—and we can affirm that his roar of “Silence” has, if
anything, gained in depth what it has lost, in pitch, and that
his sostenuto, or holding the note, on the word “Pray,” when his
demand for silence, is in the form of an entreay, may be ranked
anong one of the finest efforts of the roce di petto (his pet voice)
that we ever heard. .
Protectionist Candour.
THE Protectionists commenced the session in the House of Com-
mons on the opening night with a burst of candour that argues
excellently well for the future avowal of faults and fallacies.
When Lord JoHN RUSSELL very properly asked, with a view
to the saving of time, whether it was understood the debate on
the Address was to be concluded on the next night, a cry from
the Protectionists of “No, No! No understanding on this side
the house” became loud and general. The confession of a de-
ficiency of understanding is the first step—though it may be a very
long way off—towards the supply of the absent commodity. We
should not have been so uncomplimentary to the Protectionists
as to go the whole length of their own cry of “No understanding”
on their side of the house, but as the assertion was made very
generally, and the whole party seemed eager to assent to it, we are
not disposed to be contradictory.
RATHER LONG-WINDED.
THE Speech from the Throne was **i. over 2000 miles
of wire within an hour of its delivery. Though the Speech was
above the average in point of matter, it must be confessed that
never was a Royal Speech so thoroughly wire-drawn before.

THE THOUGHTS OF A SILENT MEMBER.
NEVER speak, but I think all the more. -
I often think, if Members spoke no more than I did,
that business would get on all the better for it.
I think the reporters are at the bottom of the long
debates. If there were no reporters, there would be no
speeches, and, there being no speeches,...we should only
have to divide, and the Session might easily be over in one
day.
I think, if cigars and refreshments were allowed in the
House, it would tend very much to enliven the debates,
and would do more towards bringing opposite parties to-
gether than all the speechifying in the world. I half think,
if CoBDEN and DISRAELI only had a sherry-cobbler toge-
ther, they would not care a straw afterwards about any little
difference of opinion; and I do think, if MUNTz were
to offer SIBTHöRP a cigar, that it would almost induce
the staunch old colonel to cross over from one side of the
House to the other. -
I think, if we were to meet earlier, and not to break up so late, it
would be much more rational. It does appear strange, not to say
ridiculous, that some 500 gentlemen should sit up all night to talk
about the nation, when all the nation is in bed. And I, think, if
this, arrangement were carried out, that our wives would like it
all the better. I know I should, for my wife will always sit up for
me, and question me about “my speech” . Now, this addressed to a
man who never by any accident says a word, is particularly unpleasant
at two o'clock in the morning. No 1 if there is one thing I pride
myself upon more than another, it is upon never having made a fool of
myself by attempting to speak. I think, but never speak, -and that’s
better than many others, who speak without ...;
ſ º! *m. º: the only man in the House who hasn’t made a fool
of himself.
Now, for a man who never says a word, I think I’ve said enough.
A Good Price given for Breezes.
WE read last week an advertisement in the Times headed:–
“C o N T R A C T F o R B R E E Z E."
Here’s a grand, opportunity for those married gentlemen who have
more breezes at home than they know what to do with ! 3
A Good SIGN.—If there were any doubt as to the falsehood of the
absurd rumour that LoRD John RUSSELL was irrevocably pledged to
finality, or having come to a stand-still, his numerous notices of motion
would at once negative the supposition.

WHERE IS BLISS TO BE FOUNDP
THE song-writers have frequently asked with some slight variations
of phraseology, “Where is Bliss to be found * and we are glad to be
able at last to answer their question by saying, once for all, that “Bliss
is to be found in the last scene of every pantomime.”
The searcher after happiness has only to go to the theatre where the
| usual Christmas entertainment is given, and by following the precept
of the moralist, to “Wait for the end,” he will be sure, to make the
desired discovery. The curtain will certainly not descend until he has
seen either the “Halls of Bliss,” the “Realms of Delight;” the
“Groyes of Felicity,” or the “Saloons,” “Temples,” or “Porticos”
of "Joy,” “Mirth,” or “Happiness.”
... It is, true, that, as that which is “One man's meat is another's
poison,” so that which the play-bills describe as “bliss” would be an
intense bore to the world in general; for pantomimic rapture usually
consists in, maintaining a most uncomfortable position, amid a dis.
agreeable blaze of blue or red light, and a drizzling shower of uncom-
fortable sparks from smoky fireworks. If such are the elements that
rule in the Halls of “Bliss,” it is clear that MoRTRAM's firework
manufactory, in the Westminster Road, must be, a fortiori, an Elysium.
We know that there is no pleasure without pain, but we should
decline a locus standi in the “ s of Delight,” when the condition of
such a standing is, that you stand upon your head on the top of a pike,
with a Roman candle stuck into your mouth by way of Roman-candle
stick, and a Catherine wheel revolving round your nose instead of its own
axis. The poet who told us, that “ignorance is bliss,” was certainly
fight as far as pantomime bliss is concerned, for it would be much
better to be ignorant of such bliss, altogether. A walk through the
Halls of Happiness” after the curtain goes down, when clown is being
released from the top of the pole, upon which his popularity has placed
him, and the other heroes and heroines of the night descend from their
uncomfortable elevation into the arms of the carpenters, while the fire-
man extinguishes the sparks still remaining with his heavy highlows,
and prepares his hose for the night—such a ramble behind the scenes
would afford sad proof of the emptiness of all theatrical felicity.
NELSON'S HORATIA.
We think we now espy hope for NELson's Daughter. We trust that,
the Aristocracy rejecting her, she will now be adopted by the People.
Punch, to aid in the publicity of the subjoined, copies it from the Times
of Feb. 1:— -
ORATIA NELSON.—If W. M., the writer of a letter in the Times, of
December, 1849, will CONFER with H. B., Post-office, Canterbury, he will hear of
several persons anxious to fall in with his suggestion for “a National Subscription in
behalf of Nelson's Daughter.”
Punch has, he thinks, to make an admirable suggestion to the excellent
people of Norwich. As NELson was a Norfolk man—(a real Norfolk
Dumpling, transmuted by MARs into a cannon-ball)—as NELson began
his education at the High School of Norwich,--Mr. Punch suggests to
the Mayor of that city the propriety of beginning the public work, by
calling a public meeting in aid of Nelson's Child."
- - - --
A Compliment to Jack.
The Naval Circular notices the arrival of the Hecate at Portsmouth,
from Bermuda, with this compliment:—
“It is gratifying to state, that although her crew is one borrowed from the Eccellent
chiefly, among whom are some famous gunners, not one case of desertion to Aalerica
has occurred, although she lay some time off an American port.”
Thus, it would seem, that English tars, when shipped to American
markets, like English printed cottons, are most to be praised when
warranted—not to run. -
SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE.
CHARITABLE persons are in the habit of sending portions of five-pound
notes by way of contributions to benevolent objects. We are sorry to
throw a slur upon what is undoubtedly a very noble action, but when a
man forwards a bank note in two separate pieces, truth compels us to
declare that he is only doing things by halves.

MR. PUNCH ON CHURCH AND STATE
EDUCATION.
MR PUNCH has often made his appearance at Willis's Rooms, but,
being a decided opponent of “National Education upon strictly Church
Principles,” he .# away from the building last Thursday when the
friends of Church Education met to uphold their plan.
MR. P. declares that he is as much interested in the Education
question as any Prelate, Archdeacon, Warden of Winchester College,
or Majesty's Counsel learned in the law then present at Willis's ; where,
as of course they had hired the rooms for their own purpose, they had as
good a right to dance to their own tunes, so to speak, as other folks do
at the same place, upon payment of their money. It is only in the
columns of the Times newspaper that MR.P. reads a record of their
F. and of these, as he also is a public preacher, he feels
himself bound to speak.
That eloquent §. C., who presided over the meeting, and whose
tongue is so sweet that even when -
- n, he speaks, against you, one is
charmed to hear him: that accomplished orator, MR. J. Taibor, stated
not unfairly what the purposes of the Government Education Scheme
are: and presented it in what he called its hideous deformity.
“The government plan,” MR. Talbot said, “was now renewed in all its hideous
deformity, and required instant resistance. (Hear, hear.) It was proposed to constitute
a central school for the supply of district schools with teachers, in which there was not
to be the slightest approach to a Church Character, no connexion whatever with Epis-
copal superintendence, no profession of faith, no creed, no catechism, but a deliberate
bringing together, under the plea of comprehensive education, every variety of dissent
and of difference, or indifference, in religion, the probable result of which would be uni-
versal scepticism and infidelity. In connection with this was the system of inspectors,
men responsible to the Committee of Education alone, and quite independent of the
bishops and of ecclesiastical authority, and whose whole business related to the disse-
mination of secular knowledge rather than of religious truth, (Hear, hear); ample
algebra, much mathematics and mechanics, land surveying, and what not; but of
religion, nothing; of dogmatic teaching, nothing.”
Now; beauty is a question of taste like any other; and MR. P.,
taking MR. TALBOT's statement as his own, declares in the face of the
honoured public of Great Britain,th it this plan of education, pronounced
by * * to be a “hideous deformity,” is, in MR.P.'s eyes, a very
pretty plan.
. P., as heartily and earnestly wishes that there may be schools estab-
lished throughout England, for the “dissemination of secular knowledge,
ample algebra, much mechanics and mathematics, land surveying, and
what not ”—as he heartily and earnestly denies that their jº will be
“ universal infidelity and scepticism.” . A black Fetish man, or a priest
take of it; ” but those who would keep the public away from it, except
under the prescription of the doctor. Doctors? psha! GoRHAM
is a Doctor; PHILLPotts is a Doctor; MR. NEwMAN was a famous
|Doctor of our schools, which he has quitted for quite a different practice;
|MR. Noel was a regular Doctor º has left the College;—we speak of
these learned persons not with the slightest disrespect for the opinions
which each holds, and which they bear conscientiously through evil and
; repute; but, because the very notoriety of their differences pleads
or toleration, and proves that there ought to be a neutral ground where
English boys and girls may learn reading, and sewing, and geography,
and the multiplication table in quiet. Are not these things good, true,
and wholesome? Is it not good that all should know them? It is good
that a Wesleyan milk-maid should be able to spell, that an Anabaptist
plough-boy º know his multiplication table, that a High-Church
tailor's apprentice should know something of history, and allow-Church
young ... ler should be able to write decently, whatever differences of
religious opinion there, may exist between him and the little, Papist
who is casting up a Rule of Three sum at his side. Oh, you doctors,

Here, for instance, at this meeting, gets up MR. NAPIER from Dublin,
who says that the Government scheme of teaching children of all religious
denominations to read, is “an attempt to exclude God from the Government
ºf the world; to separate Providence from man; to set up the wisdom of
man against God's truth.” In this way the honourable gentleman raves
and blasphemes, because two boys of different religious persuasions sit
at the same bench to learn the multiplication table. This is a zeal
ardent, indeed; worthy of LAYNEz, the heretic-burner; worthy of
CALVIN, the Socinian-roaster; worthy of the wickedest days of the
wickedest persecution.

Divinity, so that we are so many devils—neither, more nor less—this
amiable gentleman, is “one of the friends of Education on strictly
Church principles,” and a popular Champion to choose in the days of
her dolours and difficulties. -
After him rises MR. G. A. DENIson, another auxiliary of Mother
Church, who is likely to make her cause popular.
“By every means at their command, the Committee of Education were seeking to
make education independent of any definite form of religious faith; in quarters exer-
cising no contemptible influence over the Church there was manifested a fearful
indifference to divine truth; latitudinarianism was finding favour in high places.
(Hear, hear.) But the greatest danger of all was the practical negation of definite truth
which was found so largely in the Church itself, from that spirit of compromise which
led men, for the sake of what they erroneously called peace, to fritter away the
objective truth; from that sickly sentiment which made men shrink from unfurling
the banner on which were written the awful words, “This is the Catholic Faith, which
unless man believes, he cannot be saved." (Hear, hear.) The effects of this spirit of
negation and of compromise were not far to seek. The question of education had been
from the first, between the maintenance or the surrender of the creed and doctrines of
the Church Catholic and of the catechism of the Church of England. (Hear, hear.)
All education flowed from and necessarily de upon the doctrine of regeneration

necessarily no spiritual character.”
Now, MR. NAPIER from Dublin, what do you say to this doctrine of
the origin of education, by MR. Tenison from Öxford?" Very likely

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
“This is the Catholic Faith,” &c. Now, MR. NAPIER, do you hold this
doctrine, or not? if not—you know the consequences—you are as badly
off as the atheists whom you were assaulting just now... And the
chances are that being an Irishman you do no believe it; it is certain
that very few of the little Irish children have ever read it, or heard of
it: some of PHILPotts's boys may hold this doctrine, but GoRHAM’s
boys don’t: GoRhAM denies it flatly: and half the Church of England
with him. Things may be changed since we went to school, but in our
time, we believe that the head-masters of public schools did not begin
lessons every morning with a statement of “Bºys, all education flows
from, and necessarily depends on, the doctrine of,” &c. Why should they?
when they disagreeabout it in Doctors' Commons, when the archbishops
themselves are very reserved about it, and the Bench of bishops is mum.
After these laymen rises MR. SEWELL, who says, that, if my boy
learns to spell at a school where the Catechism is not taught, he is
brought up under a system
“which must inevitably destroy in the created being veneration, for the Creatºr, in
the child love for the parent, in the pupil respect for the teacher, in the subject obedience
to the state."
And after SEwBLL comes the Warden of Winchester, who declares
“that the Committee of Council of Education are not only forgetful of
their duty to their God and to the people, but also of their duty to the
Sovereign”—declarations rather alarming, certainly, were the truth of
them proved: but let us hope that the clerical gentlemen are wrong,
and led away by professional zeal, rather than think that Her Majesty's
Government, and the Council of Education, and the Schºol Inspectors,
masters, mistresses, and pupils, are in the deplorable condition described,
and all cursed from beginning to end. Let us humbly hope, we say,
that your Reverences are wrong. Among the approvers of the Govern-
ment Educational Scheme, are persons just as wise as you; among the
Inspectors, other clergymen no doubt as good. The gentlemen of whom
you say that they “forget their duty to GoD and the Sovereign,” are
by age and education capable of judging for themselves; it may be that
a knowledge of the multiplication table, however acquired, will not lead
to Atheism, and that Jews, Methodists, Baptists, and Socinians, honour
their fathers and mothers as well as you do.
O gentlemen! O servants of the poor dear old Church of England,
while you are boxing and brawling within the sanctuary, why send forth
these absurd emissaries to curse the people outside? They don't mind
your comminations; they are only jeering at your battles. “As sure
as you learn geography without us,” shrieks SEwBLL from the tower,
“you’ll be —.” “Go it, GoRHAM—Pitch into him, PHILPoTTs | *

tiplication table,” cries out the Warden from the door:—and the people

many more quit it, and get the tops of their heads shaved, and have
themselves christened over again, each as a new man: BAPTIST walks

sad O, Ministers of our venerable mother—keep quiet tongues in

freely. The people in this country will learn to read and write; they
rsons set their sums and point out their lessons, or
meddle in all their business of life: and as for your outcries about in-
fidelity and atheism, they will laugh at you (as long as they keep their
temper,) and mind you no more than MUMBo JUMBo.
A Few Stumbling Blocks in the Path of Fame.
BY MR. BRIEFLESS.
BEING *: as junior in a cause, and finding ourself described in
the papers of the following day as “another learned gentleman.”
Going into Court without our wig and gown, to hand a compute to to
the Usher, who tells us that “those things can’t be taken from the
attorney's clerks, but must be handed in by a barrister.”
Having a half guinea motion, and refusing it on the plea of “other
retainers elsewhere; ” the real fact being that it does not pay for the
sake of a solitary ten-and-six to incur the usual charge of one pound
nineteen for the robing-room.
Having to open the door to a client while our clerk has gone out
for a lobster, and the clerk bursting into the room with the lobster just
as we are quoting “CRABB's Digest.”
SAYINGS WITHOUT DOINGS.
“I should just like to pay you off,” as JoHN BULL said to the
National Debt.
“I wish I could get things into the right train,” as the UNPRO-
TECTED FEMALE said to herself when she saw her luggage going away
from her in all directions.

We suspect that there are several consigned annually to a Thames

redress at the fountain head, the New River head is the only one that is

LOUIS-NAPOLEON “SPARE THAT TREE.”
THE Parisians must be getting as nervous as a lot of old aspens;
for there is continually something happening to frighten them out of a
portion of the few senses that may still remain to them,
Within the last few days considerable excitement has been caused
by the removal of some of those eyesores—the dead trees of liberty.
Upon some of them had been placed various flags and revolutionary
emblems, which being hoisted to the top of the high trees, were
regarded by the Government as little less than high treas-on. The
isaffected on the other hand, thought Louis NAPOLEoN guilty of a
design to cut up the Republic root and branch by laying the axe-
without axeing the permission of the people—to the trees of liberty.
For our own parts we think that if these sorry symbols of the Republic
are not likely to flourish or put forth foliage, it is quite as well that they
should be compelled to take their leaves by order of the authorities.

NELSON'S “HORATIA.”
PUNCH is a little embarrassed by the communication of a “Constant
Reader”—albeit very flattering to Punch, and very indicative of im-
pulsive generosity on the part of the aforesaid “Reader;” of whom
Punch has to request an early line, that the “Reader’s ” communication
may be returned to him. Punch being desirous in this, and in all
matters, of no other testimonial than the rewarding sympathy of his
Readers, and the apprºval of his own conscience.
In default of the “Reader” not seeing the above—or seeing it, not
acting upon it—the communication, though at present very perplexing
Punch, will be forwarded to the benefit of some object that may
make the best and speediest use of the difficulty.
. A line, however, is earnestly requested from a “Constant Reader” a
line recapitulating the substance of his formerletter, that there may be no
mistake in the person replying to this, Punch's emphatic solicitation.
Another “Case” for the Protectionists.
We read the other day, in one of those amusing miscellanies, a “City
article,” that pepper was getting up, and we foresaw at once that the
Protectionists would have a good cry directly they set their eyes on
pepper. They will of course bewail the additional difficulty of getting
their rents in those cases where the rent is a peppercorn, and with a
frantic shout of “Look at pepper,” they will declare they are bein
ground down worse than ever. There is no fear that the article wi
maintain too high a price, for pepper is about the last thing that people
will pay for through the nose very readily.

PUNCH*S PARLIAMENTARY HODGE PODGE.
To EveRY ONE GREETING: The Parliament meeting,
Punch orders his faithful reporter, reporter,
While nothing mis-stating, to give the debating,
But cutting the speeches much shorter, much shorter.
In the strife and the tameness, there's always a sameness,
Another day’s very like one day, like one day:
So after some weedings, we give the proceedings,
In the way that they happened on Monday, on Monday.
With eloquence manly, up rose the LoRD STANLEY,
And . about ADMIRAL PARKER, yes, PARKER:
Some papers he wanted—though papers when granted,
Wºº. make matters much darker, much darker.
Then came MARQUIslansDowne with look soft as swans-down,
Trusting quarrels with Greece would be fleeting, quite fleeting:
The documents granting LoRD STANLEY was wanting,
The matter thus pleasantly meeting, yes, meeting.
Discussion proceeded, though none could be needed; -
LoRD LANsdowne's compliance had stopp'd it, had stopp'd it;
But one or two members kept poking the embers,
Till their Lordships conclusively dropp'd it, yes, dropp'dit.
On the very same night too, as they had a right to, -
The Commons 'bout Greece had been asking, been asking;
LoRD PALMERSTON's readiness, with obstinate steadiness,
MR. GIBson adroitly was tasking, was tasking.
Then MistER DISRAELI determining gaily
To physic LoRD P. as with senna, with senna;
Said, relations with Turkey look’d gloomy and murky,
As well as with Spain and Vienna, Vienna.
Next ANstEY, call’d CHIs Holm, delighting in schism,
A word introduced 'bout Moldavia, Moldavia;
When PALMERston coolly put down the unruly,
With his usual off-hand behaviour, behaviour.
The address the report on, no sooner was brought on,
Than there rose with a look of dejection, dejection,
MISTER PACKE, who lamented in terms discontented,
The loss of his dear friend Protection, Protection.
MR. HuME in º; to MISTER PACKE's sighing,
Demanded Reform from LoRD Russell, LoRD Russell,
Which set many seeking at once to be speaking,
And threw the House into a bustle, a bustle.
Then both sides together got arguing, whether
Free Trade was a good or a bad thing, a bad thing;
There rose such a bother, 'twixt one and the other,
The confusion was really a sad thing, a sad thing.
LoRD Russell, however, by earnest endeavour,
In answering questions succeeded, succeeded,
Proceeding to mention—he thought an extension
Of the franchise, at present, not needed, not needed.
Next came some orations and small observations,
Evincing no wondrous discernment, discernment;
And a member who woke up, the night's business broke up,
By moving at once the adjournment, adjournment.
THE CREDIT OF AN EMPEROR.
OUR dingy friend, SouLouque, having got tired of a tub for his
throne, which furnished a butt for ridicule, has been sending orders to
Paris for splendid upholstery, to uphold his imperial dignity. The
furniture was * in hand, but the manufacturers want the cash to be
in hand as well as the furniture. Soulouque having been called upon
for a remittance, and being almost as destitute of money as he is of
clothes, sent of a cargo of sugar, in the hope that it would sweeten
anything like bitterness on the part of his creditors. The Parisian
tradesmen were, however, not to be done by anything so raw as a lot
of brown sugar, and have returned it all, on Soulouque's hands, who
has no way of showing his anger but by his black looks, which we need
not say are quite lost in the distance. He is rather disgusted at the
manufacturers being so excessively reluctant, to part with their fur-
niture, and he thinks—though he has not said as much—that persons
who are so chary of their chairs and tables, must be most un-chari-table
characters. Instead of sending out the fauteuils and easy lounges, he
ordered, they have by their refusal of credit, given him a setting down
of a very different nature.

THAMES WATER IN THE NURSERY AND THE GARDEN.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
“EstEEMED SIR,
“As you do not always reject scientific communications, I
venture to submit to you a curious case illustrating the comparative
effect of Thames water on animal and vegetable life. I took my house
—which derives its water-supply, through a Company, from the Thames
—about a year ago. I had scarcely been in it six months, when my
children’s growth seemed to have stopped, and they had become evi-
dently emaciated. My doctor ascribed these alarming symptoms to
the water we drank. Behind my house I have a little back garden,
with cabbages in it. Not far from our residence there is an Artesian
The doctor recommended me to give the well-water to the
children, and the Thames-water to the cabbages. His advice was
followed, with equal benefit to my plants and my progeny. The latter,
on leaving off Thames water, soon regained flesh; the former, on being
supplied with it, began to vegetate luxuriantly. I wonder what those
peculiar principles can be in the water of the Thames, which, whilst
they stunt the human frame, are so highly nutritious to vegetables?
Can you inform
“Your fervent Admirer, SIMox PURE **
*...* The peculiar principles contained in Thames water, in addition
to their more useful properties, evolve such a quantity of sulphuretted
longer to be the receptacle of the London sewage, we believe even our
Correspondent will be able to set it on fire.
AFFAIRS OF HUNGARY.
*- THESE affairs have, altogether, been treated
º in the House of Commons with a spirit of
"pleasantry that instructively proves the truth
of FIELDING's axiom, that there are many
people who can bear the misfortunes of their
neighbours like Christians. Shooting. of
brave soldiers, hanging of venerable legalists
and judges, and scourging on the naked back,
under the glaring eyes of a savage, soldiery,
wives and mothers—though mortal, horrible
and loathsome to the sufferers, may be very
placidly talked about-nay, eloquently de-
fended, to “a frigid house” by members of a
British Parliament. -
Thus LoRD DUDLEY STUART made his
statement of the atrocities suffered by Hun-
gary at the incarnadine hands, of the EM-
PERoR of Austria—(his Lordship read over
the list of death)—a terrific catalogue, to
startle Kaisers at some time—when–
Lord C. HAMILTON wondered at anybody
who could think ill of the EMPEROR OF AUS-
TRIA! The House (Lord S. must acknow-
ledge) was as cool as a cucumber, with all his pother about Hungary.
And who could think Austria's young Emperor any other than an
Imperial flower—the very pink of Potentates–a perfect gentleman?.
R. Disraeli said the whole matter was ridiculous. Some, nºisy
people had been hung and shot and whipped in Hungary!, Well, hadn't
people been shot and flogged in Ceylon? If there were halters and cats
in Hungary, were there not halters and cats under English dominion
in the East? People who could not—as he could-loºk upon these
matters, and generalise them with a philosophic º: adding thereto a
shake of Cayenne and a squeeze of lemon, -people who could not do
this, were people of a very narrow mind, and—perhaps, he was very
sorry for them. -
And here, for the present, the matter (bleeding Hungary) rests.
Our Colonel's Experience.
We are delighted to find our old friend, CoLoREE Sibthoºr, on his
legs again, overwhelming the Government with inºffensive abuse
-
a propos of any and every question before the House. Alluding, to the
Commission for the Grand Industrial Display to take place next year,
the Gallant Colonel is reported to have said-
“If such were to be the component parts of the Commission he would only augur:
for experience had made him wise, that there would be nothing but trick and
manoeuvre.”
We hope our Colonel will not repeat this. There is a certain sort
of persons who are proverbially said to be made wise by experience;
we would not hear our Colonel's enemy class him with such, nor shall
he, with our acquiescence, do our ear that violence.

- THE EXCHANGE CLOCK.
A RUMoUR having got into circulation that this respectable member
of the Horological Society was suffering from an internal complaint,

like many other inhabitants of the City of London, had been injured b
want of attention to cleanliness, the dirt standing nearly an inch thi |
on his face and hands, and there being such an accumulation of particles
in those passages which ought to have been quite free, that how he has
gone on so long is quite a miracle. - --- - - -
We have ourselves been to visit the clock twice within twenty-four

Railway Punctuation.
THERE is nothing that has so little punctuality about it as railway
punctuation, a truth of which every line of BRADSHAw's Guide ſurnishes
frequent instances. The other day, on the North Kent, the train was
out in its punctuation, and was brought to a dead stand-still from a
deficiency of steam power, or in other words, it came to a full stop ſor
want of a coal-on. There were several notes of exclamation and inter-
rogation from the passengers; but the guard could not or...would not
explain the cause of the full stop, which so much curtailed the ac-
comma-dation of the passengers.
FEARFUL INUNDATION.—The most ruinous inundation, and the
largest destruction of property that has occurred for some time, has

SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF AN UNPROTECTED
FEMALE.
MR. Jones has a literary friend, GRIDDLEs, who has a Comedy brought
out, and has “left MR. Jones's name’ for a private bor on the
occasion. MR. Jones has persuaded the UNPROTECTED FEMALE to
accompany him. The UNPROTECTED FEMALE is under the impression
that Jones has gallantly paid for the bor, and Jon Es is under the
impression that he need not disabuse her of such notion.
ScENE. Outside of the Theatre, with the usual scene of contrary behaviour
on the part of the vehicles, their horses, and drivers. The UNPROTEC-

[During all this time, the cab has been performing a series of sticks,
jolts, bumps, currets, sudden pulls up, sudden startings forward,
grindings of the curb stone, &c., #: &c., to the grievous discom-
posure of the UNPROTECTED FEMALE, whose only comfort is

Boar. He passes the Money-TAKER.

Where’s the Box-keeper?

Betrothed (who does not dance the Polka). “I should like to punch
His HEAD-A conceited BEAST.”
MR. HORSMAN'S ANATOMY.
AN interesting dissection and demonstration of an Organised Humbug
was made last week by MR. HoRsMAN, in the Hall of St. Stephens’
Legislative Society. The Humbug in question is called the Ecclesias-
tical Commission. Its organisation consists of certain Bishops, com-
bined with some laymen, distinguished and undistinguished, of the
Church of England: and formerly included a Secretary, of whom the
best that can be said at present is, non est inventus. The design of its
formation was to provide for spiritual destitution; instead of which it
has been employing itself chiefly in building palaces for Bishops. With
a large remainder of the funds of the concern that were not thus mis-
applied, the Secretary bolted. Nobody knows where he is; nor does
it º: that MR. DANIEL FoRRESTER, or any other such pursuivant,
has been commissioned to find out. Happy Secretary, in not having
been a foreman that absconded with the contents of his employer’s till,
and was had up at the Central Criminal Court, and sentenced to seven
years transportation! Finis coronat opus. With such a career, such a
secretary, and such a consummation, is not the Ecclesiastical Commis-
sion, a regular Humbug, a thorough Humbug, a Humbug from
beginning to end?
Our Foreign Feuds.
SNUBBED as we are by Spain, slighted by Austria, at odds with
Greece, and barely on speaking terms with the world at large, unless
some very great improvement takes place in our foreign relations, and
| provided—to borrow a word or two from MR. CARLYLE,-the next
ech from the Throne is not to be a Sham-Speech concocted by a
Phantasm-Cabinet, the passage in it alluding to the assurances, &c.,
received from foreign Powers, will run somewhat thus:-
“I continue to receive from almost all foreign States and Sovereigns the most un-
equivocal manifestations of disrespect and resentment.”
LoRD PALMERston’s broils are indeed pretty dishes “to set before
the QUEEN.”
Much of A. Mugh NEss—Since the recent disclosures of gross
falsehood practised by Railway Boards, the term “lie direct” has
been amplified into “lie directory.”
THE THOUGHTS OF A SILENT MEMBER.
I THINK it is absurd quarrelling; and so by remaining silent, I
keep my friends and make no enemies. If you wish never to quarrel,
ow of no surer plan than never opening your mouth.
... I think quarrels, in the House only bring disrepute upon it. It is
like a matrimonial squabble in the street. A large crowd collects,
cheers, shouts, urges both parties on, and laughs at them all the while.
Not a person troubles himself about the cause of the row. It is a
source of amusement to them; and they are perfectly indifferent which
side is right, or which is wrong. It is the same with our squabbles.
The nation does not care one jot about them, further than the little
amusement it gets out of them. Depend upon it we are only
laughed at.
I think, however, that when we do quarrel—when we regularly make
a night of it—that strangers should be ordered to withdraw. It is bad
enough quarrelling; but I consider it fifty times worse letting all the
world into the secret. If we do make fools or blackguards of our-
selves, there is no necessity why everybody should know it. Why
cannot we quarrel peaceably, quietly, amongst ourselves? As for the
. they make half the mischief. If they hear anything bad,
delicacy should teach them not to say anything about it; I wonder they
are not tired of circulating so many evil reports.
I think I would not be Prime Minister for all the world. What with
the sharp work, and the immense grinding, it strikes me as the life of a
continual grindstone, which must wear out the stoutest blade in no time.
No omnibus horse is harder worked, and worse whipped, or more severely
pulled up when he makes a stumble. Besides, he gets no thanks, ex-
cepting when he goes out; I know I should earn my small portion of
thanks as soon as I could, for I should look upon myself as an unfortu-
nate man who had fallen into the ice, and that I should’nt feel comfort-
able till I had got myself well out of it.
chance of my ever being Prime Minister, but to avoid accidents, Ishall
not try. I think Lord JoHN knows me better than to suspect I would
take any mean advantage of him.
JOCULAR LONGEVITY.
º oME extraordinary instances of longevity in
the regions of facetiae are upon record,
but we recollect nothing in the annals of
the venerable which comes up to the follow-
ing:—There are still living in a burlesque,
which shall be nameless, six puns whose
united ages amount to 425 years. The
whole of the puns may be seem every even-
ing in a state of tolerable activity, with no
other signs of decay but a shortness of
breath, which creates a necessity for the
omission of the letter H in cases requiring
aspiration. Three of the aged puns were
familiars of Old JoE MILLER, and one of
them boasts that he has assisted at every
performance of every burlesque that has
ever been written. e are º to see
that the venerable character of the puns
causes them to be treated with respect by
the public, who never smile even at their
infirmities. One of the puns boasts of
being on the best terms, with several
members of Parliament, Judges, and other dignitaries, who have always
a good word or a bon mot to say for him.
WIT AND WISDOM IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
“SAPIENZA,” gentlemen of the rural districts, is Italian for wisdom.
It is also the name of an island concerned in the squabble between our
Government and Greece. Now, you will be enabled to perceive the
force of the subjoined remark which the EARL of ABERDEEN, com:
menting on ADMIRAL PARKER's demonstration at Athens, is reported
to have made in the House of Lords. His Lordship
“Did not mean to deny that it might be better for our Government to bein possession
of Sapienza; but even wisdom ought only to be obtained by legitimate means."
This is a rather vivid flash of that mild merriment that is wont to set
the Peers in a titter. A faint coruscation shows brightly in a dark
place. LoRD ABERDEEN is a “wit among Lords” and a pretty res-
pectable commoner among wits. It is a pity that he did not go on
while he was in the vein, and say that LoRD PALMERston was at sea
in the Piraeus, or would get into a mess by meddling with Greece.
Indeed, our foreign policy in general is so absurd in itself, that the
noble Lord might, without any impropriety, have turned all its points
into puns, and converted every one of its questions into conundrums.
I do not think there is much-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

“ AN APPEAL TO THE ARISTOCRACY,”
WE hate treason—even the
treason of the Servants’
Hall, or Butler’s Pantry;
hence, we must express
our most devastatin
contempt of the princi-
ple that has put a goose-
quill into the traitor-
ous hand of amindividual
who has written and
published a pamphlet
called—
“An Appeal to the Aris-
| tocracy, the Upper and
\ Middling Classes of So-
ciety, to Remedy the Er-
isting Evils Regarding
London Servants.”
The writer is an Ex-Footman, a Retired JENKINs; a traitor who has
shed his plush as a viper casts, its skin, and is now ea ultans in ºuts
riribus—, or, to take a free translation, is now strutting in plain
clothes. There is no name to the pamphlet; but the whole style of the
thing crawls with the obsequiousness of the most obsequious liveryman.
Every line smells of the JENKINsonIAN hair-powder. However, to give
our reader a whiff of the fellow's quality. Having knocked off the
House Steward, or Butler,-the Head Groom or Stud. Groom, the
Trainer, or Racing Groom—all of whom, he, one and severally, shows to
be worthy of no other livery than the Woolwich pepper-and-salt,
turned up with iron ornaments at the ankles: after these, the ex-plush
ruffian comes to “Ladies' Maids.” And here he begins by a warning
to all English mistresses. He says-
* I am obli to believe, in addition to these qualifications, that, taking them,
º maids] generally as a class, they are also not the most moral in the world.
here is one I would especially extend to your notice to avoid—it is “the young and
pretty woman, recommended from the country as a perfect treasure, so unlike those horrid
Ilondon Maids: ' this is a most dangerous intruder. . . . But, as I said before, we
must not class them all alike; at any rate, “the treasure from the country, so unlike those
horrid London Maids,' is best avoided. Indeed, I would much recommend—”
What, fair ladies, think ye P. What would this traitorous JENKINs,
this fellow who, found out in his worthlessness, has evidently been cast
off by some honest English girl, -what does this yellow-plush-hearted
varlet recommend ?–Listen:-
“Indeed, I would much recommend in this particular department, the services of our
French neighbours: there is, rest assured, to all ladies, something so much more pleasing,
added to a willing, light-hearted, satisfactory quickness and intelligence in their calling,
which is a sort of second nature in them, so far preferable to the comparative slow
movements and inordinate presumption and vanity of our countrywomen.”
And yet, there may be gratitude in this paltry, unpatriotic JENKINs.
The Roman twins were suckled by a wolf... The writer of the above,
was, no doubt, wet-nursed by a French poodle.
And what the fellow's remedy for the evils abounding in English
servants? How would he abolish English Ladies’ Maids, casting them,
no matter to what destitution, to what misery, in favour of the “willing,
light-hearted, satisfactory” services of our French neighbours? Why,
he puts the remedy in the way of a question, and asks-
“Can anything be more easy, or any course more simple, than the calling together a
meeting of some of the highest and wealthiest of our aristocracy and higher classes
during the time of the season in London and sittings of our Houses of Legislature
when they are most likely to be in numbers on the spot.”
And there and then to obtain a pledge from them—
r
r
“That they will forthwith, from that time forward, send for their house stewards, one
and all, and briefly state their fixed and unalterable determination, in consequence of
the change of times, to discharge all those of their domestic establishment that will
not serve them at a reduced rate of twenty-five per cent. in all descriptions of wages,
subsistence moneys, and the like.”
. All the English Ladies' Maids of “comparative slow movements and
inordinate presumption,” being cashiered, no matter to what destiny, in
favour of the “willing, light-hearted,” Ladies’ Maids of France.
. Punch, it may be supposed, is no friend to impressment; but with a
view to a prºper reward being vouchsafed to the ex-pantry writer of the
“Appeal,” Punch would propose that the traitor be immedia'ely sought
for and seized, and kept in safe keeping, until a certain ship be said
to sail for Van Dieman's Land; the ship that shall bear from our
coast, hundreds of half-starved, broken spirited Englishwomen. On
board this ship, let the writer have a special appointment; namely,
an appointment for the whole of the voyage, not to open his mouth
*: ºnale passenger, and continually to wring swabs in the ship's
ead.”
THE WORST OF TAXES.
SUPPose, readers, that there existed a tax . water, which, in its
operation, compelled the poorer classes to slake their thirst at cess-
tº: tº drink sewage, and mere sewage, qualified “with no allaying
ames.’
Such a tax there is, which renders living water—the knowledges of
g i. and truth-dear, and so withholds them from the many; whom it
rives to swill abominable slush, replete with all manner of pollution.
That tax is the tax on paper. For a full view of its workings, see
MR. CHARLEs KNIGHT's remarks on:"The Struggles of a Book against
Excessive Taxation.”
MR. KNIGHT shows that, by reason of this impost, cheap and good
publications do not pay; whilst the cheap and nasty, weekly vented in
myriads by the scoundrelhood of the Press, are remunerative. The
former class, of works he typifies—we thank him for the use of the
figure—as the Fountain; the latter as the Sewer; and he gives an
estimate of the comparative cost of their production. The Fountain
can only be set up at a considerable expense, both in materials and
architects' wages. The Sewer is established at small charge, and fed
by scavengers, for scavengers' hire. The Sewer can be turned on, at a
low rate, with profit; the Fountain—in consequence of the Paper-tax-
not. Take off the Paper Tax, and the Fountain can compete with the
Sewer. If farther reason is wanted for the removal of this Protection
to Literary Filth, let Government ponder the following words of MR.
KNIGHT:-
“Upon a tolerably accurate calculation, I have, from my own unaided resources,
expended during the last twenty years, eighty thousand pounds upon copyright and
editorial labour. During the same period I have paid fifty thousand pounds paper duty,
which sum has become a double charge to me by the inevitable operation of a tax upon
raw material. May I venture to ask what, during these twenty years, the Government
has done for the encouragement of learning and literature, equal to the sum which it has
exacted from me in the shape of a tax upon knowledge?’
MR. KNIGHT ought not to lose his investment. Some few crumbs,
at least, of the bread which he has cast upon the waters should be
restored to him. He asks not a pension, but the repeal of the Paper
Tax. ...Grant it, my Lords and Gentlemen, and if good instruction has
the effect it is said to have, the amount will soon be saved in prison
expenses. Do an act of justice to MR. KNIGHT, and remove a prohi-
bitory duty on wholesome beverages, and a bonus on the sale of poison.
A MINISTER IS INFALLIBLE!
LoRD JoHN RUssELL said, last week, “A Cabinet Minister cannot
be sorry for his expressions.” The old fable was, “A King can do no
wrong.” The new one apparently is, “A Cabinet Minister can say
| nothing wrong.” At least, however wrong he may talk, he need not
be sorry for it. This is a latitude of speech, which none but a Minister
can indulge in. He may advance what he likes, but will withdraw no-
thing. This is another reading of Finality, an expression, which, if we
remember right, LoRD JoHN has had occasion more than once to be
sorry for. Since LORD JOHN has a taste for curious dogmas, the
following is perfectly at his service:
| “The Minister who is never sorry for his expressions, makes at best,
but a sorry Minister.”
Railway Signals.
WE dare say that out of the various Railway Signals that have been
invented by ingenious enthusiasts, we should find many signal failures,
but we are not quite prepared to go the length of the Railway autho-
| rities in rejecting all other plans, and declaring that the break is a
sufficient means of communication between the guard and the engine-
driver, particularly when we recollect that the “break” is usually one
affecting the arms, legs, and heads of the passengers.
“Vous en avez Menti."
THE French papers of last week tell us that the above words, uttered
in the Chamber by M. LEO DE LA. Borde, “caused a great sensation.”
We cannot but wonder at this. Considering that the courtesy is flung
at somebody’s head about once a week, it only shows that, the French
at least, are not “a people of habit.”
AN OLD QUESTION SETTLED AT LAST.
WHO is MILEs’ Boy?
MR. BANVARD, MR. BonoMI, and MR. BREEs, are clearly “Three
|Miles' Boys” from the fact of their Panoramas all running that
| distance.
THE ExTREME of PROTECTION.—There is a great fitness of things
in LoRD JoHN MANNERs' standing for Colchester; for his Lordship
is so thorough a Protectionist, that, no doubt, he is prepared to vote
for Protection to Native Oysters.

Though the Railway Directors have generally gone far above the

fallen very low indeed, in the estimation in which they are held. It

THE SELF-PRESENTATION PIECE-OF.PLATE
CLUB.
[PROSPECTUs, PRIVATE AND CIRCULAR.]
T having struck,
and at the same
time, the conge-
nial minds of
several individu-
als, that society
is divided into
classes, namely,
the Class that
is honoured and
enriched with
pieces of plate, in
the way of Testi-
monial, and the
Class that is
not, -
The marked in-
justice, the social
discrepancy, is
sought to % re-
medied and set
straight by the
establishment (in
confidence) of
a Piece-of-Plate
Club that shall
- - at once be Self-
Presenting and Self-Supporting. With this View it is thought desirable
that a Society be formed, to be composed of a certain number of indi-
viduals, who, having, no expectation that their Merits and Virtues,
though intimately well known, and equally well appreciated, will be
represented to them in so many ounces of gold, silver-gilt, or modest
silver, by Others,
Are nevertheless desirous to pay some slight mark (in the way of
Goldsmiths' Hall Mark) of esteem and veneration to Themselves.
And thus much for the sentiment, the philosophy, and the AEsthetics
of the Club under consideration. It is now high time to proceed to
the most efficient means of its practical development.
It is proposed that the Club shall consist of at least not less than
embers. That subscriptions shall be paid weekly, monthly,
or quarterly; the subscriptions being of any amount from One Shillin
to One Hundred Pounds, according to the Value of the Testimonial,
that is the Laudable Object of Ambition to the Subscriber.
That Once a Month, a Drawing shall take place of the Names of
Members (the number to be hereafter decided upon) to be duly Plated.
That the Members, so Drawn shall have immediate permission to
decide upon the Testimonial to be by Themselves presented to Them-
selves, on giving Sufficient Security to the Club for the payment of the
Silversmith's Bill (by * it) for the Object of the Selected. That
Every Member—as best knowing. Himself—shall, write his Qwn
#ºn. recording his Own Wirtues, and hallowing his Own
erlts.
Thus, after the Establishment of THE SELF-PRESENTATION PIECE-or-
PLATE CLUB,it will be wholly attributable to the indolence or the poverty
of every man.if he have not upon his own Side-Board some flattering
Record of his Excellence, in the Shape of a Salver—a Wine-Cooler–
a Bread Basket, or an unassuming Cellaret.
Further Particulars of the Club will speedily appear in the Public
Prints. Thus much is, for the present, imparted, that it may beneficially
work and ferment in the Public intellect.
. The Meditated Circle of the Club will be very Comprehensive, taking
in All Classes of Men, from the Member of Parliament anxious to
etermise, in a Candelabra, his Own Sense of his Own Eloquence, and
his Own Unwearied Watchfulness of Public Interests, to the Paro-
chial Beadle who, on a Small Silver Mug, would speak of his Fidelity,
his Civility, his Integrity to the Parish at Large, and his Suavity and
Benevolence to Little Boys in Particular.
N. B. To Husbands, desirous of Commemorating the Virtues of their
Wives in at least a Silver Tea-Pot, the Club offers an Opportunity of
displaying perhaps one of the most, if not the most, noble'Emotions of
the Human Heart.
& Please to Give This Paper to the Lady of the House.

A TRUTH FOR THE TIMES.
It is a curious fact in the grammar of politics that when statesmen
get into place they become often oblivious of their antecedents, but
are seldom forgetful of their relatives.
VOL. xWIII. I
A RUN OF BAD LUCK.
.THE Red Republicans made a futile effort a week or two ago to
disturb the peace of Paris, when the soldiers, laudably anxious to avoid
bloodshed, took the hint of their commander to disperse the mob at
the point of the toe, instead of at the point of the bayonet. We wish
we could look upon the little affair as literally the last kick of the Red
Republicans. The method adopted by the military was perfectly suc-
cessful, for the soldiers no sooner took to their toes, than “the Reds”
took to their heels with wonderful, rapidity. The fugitives, who had
just before been assuming an alarming attitude, were at once rendered
ridiculous, even in the eyes of the women of their own party, and will
no doubt remember for some time their collision with a detachment of
foot, and its ignoble consequences... We dare say they will, attempt to
make out—after the fashion of their own historians—that they º:
no discomfiture at all, and that it was nothing but their own tremendous
enthusiasm that ran away with them.
THE LAND.
An Echo to Barry Cornwall’s “Sea.”
THE Land! The Land! The grumbling Land!
The poor, the always at a stand:
Without a penny, without a pound,
It turneth the same dull circle round.
It brays for relief, for Protection cries,
Or like a .# creature lies.
They’ve got the Land! They've got the Land!
But to help themselves won’t lend a hand.
With debts above, and debts below,
And a mortgage *...; go.
If a chance should come, while they wail and weep,
What matter | The Land will go to sleep.
I hate, oh! how I hate to hear
Their murmurs foaming in my ear!
When some mad member bays the moon,
Or whistles Protection's dull old tune;
And tells how goeth the corn so low,
That it really never will pay to grow.
I never heard Protection’s roar,
But I saw the humbug more and more,
And backwards flew to reason's test
Which proves Free Trade to be the best.
For Free Trade always appear'd to me
The thing that’s right, and that ought to be.
The landlords look'd black, with rage and scorn,
In the hour when fair Free Trade was born.
The noisy whistled—the Tories old
Declared themselves º: sold;
And never was heard such an outcry wild, .
As welcomed to life PEEL's Free Trade child.
We’ve lived since then in calm and strife,
A few short summers, an active life;
With wealth to barter and power to range,
Where'er we can make the best exchange.
But alas ! there’s only the same dead stand,
When we turn to look at the poor old Land!
DUNCES OF DOWNING STREET.
MINISTERs are at a loss what to do with the Ten Hours Factory
Bill, which, owing to a defect in its wording, proves inoperative. For
the present they had better send it to the Dead Letter 9ffice. Really,
Parliament must have an Editor to prepare its acts for publication.
His salary would cost the country but little, as a gentleman of moderate
literary attainments would be competent to the *H. He would ||
only be required to possess the ability to write the English *f;
correctly, an art, apparently, beyond the reach of statesmanship. To
create such an office would be giving some little encouragement to the
profession of the Pen. What but faulty composition can be expected
of a Government that neglects Literature.
High Ways and Low Ways.
It may be cited as a melancholy instance of the ruinous effect of
credit, that several turnpike trusts are in a state of insolvency. It
may be further observed, that the ticketing system, which has been in
#. force amongst all these concerns, most commonly leads to bank-
ruptcy.

peal,offairy bells. The extreme neatness of the pump, if nothing else,
would tell you that it is the Waiter.
With the quickness of a pantomimic change, the Greengrocer has
transformed himself into the Waiter. If he had stood at the side-wing
of a theatre, and the carpenter from behind had pulled the string out of
his great coat, the change could not have been effected quicker. And
what a change! It is hard to believe that the two individuals—the
butterfly and the grub-have sprung from the same body. You can
º magne the fittering thing before you serves greens in the
ay-tºlume .
..What is it that refines him? How is it that, by simply decorating
his neck with a wisp of clean muslin, and winging his feet with
an aerial pair of pumps, the nature of the Greengrocer is so com-
pletely changed? We shall really believe that there is something
spiritualising in the profession of a Waiter, and that agentleman, to be
a perfect gentleman, should put the last touch of polish to his education
by going through a six months’ course of rubbing mahogany tables.
Look at the specimen before us! An hour ago he was a hard, dingy,
lump of a man. How bright he is now! He sparkles and burns with
nºw fire, and tha. Promethean fire he has stolen from the kitchen-
grate....Call on him to-morrow. Catch him behind his apron, and
yºu will not recognise in the soiled hands that are playing at marbles
with the potatoes, the Beau BRUMMEL of the Berlins who helped
you so gracefully to blanc-mange the evening before. Or observe him
i tempered than the waiter who is a regular fixture.
when he is on the front bar of a covered van, whipping a jaded white
horse, with “eighteen insides,” to Hampton Court. You would hardly
believe that dusty-looking man with a short pipe in the corner of his
mouth was the same bright creature that only yesterday was playing
about the room, like summer lightning, shedding a radiance wherever
he darted in and out with his napkin. There is decidedly some vivifying
charm, some magic reviver, that lies hid in the butler's pantry.
But on no other could this charm act so ethereally, on no other would
this reviver operate with such lustre, as on the Greengrocer! It would
be absurd to try it on the Butcher, and the Chimney-Sweep would be
equally ridiculous. The Milkman unfortunately knows nothing of
waiting, excepting at the area gate. The Tailor wants aristocratic
presence for the high office. The Baker, when asked for Bread, would
hand you the loaf on the palm of his hand. The Cheesemonger would
be tasting the cheese before he took it round, and the Postman, if told
to inform the gentleman that the “tea was waiting,” would deliver the
message with a tremendous double knock. No! the Parent to wait, at
parties has been exclusively lodged by Nature in the bosom of the
|Greengrocer.
| Besides, his good temperis a key to open every door and every
heart. The waiter that is only laid on for a night, is always better
The tender way
in which the Greengrocer behaves to children would be a chea º:
them
“brats.” He lets them pilfer the “sweets” as they come out, as much
as they please, and if they get between his legs when he is carrying some
mighty dome of a silver ver, he manages somehow to bear up
against it, where any other servant would be violently upset. He is as
affable below. He compliments the lady's-maids, and jokes with the
cook, helping her to unspit joints, and untie pudding-bags. There must
be º: in the atmosphere of spring onions and summere
that, to contract a loan with the Latingrammar,
*—emollit mores, nec simit esse feros.”
After the fatigues of the evening, his temper is as little ruffled as his
fine linen shirt. He helps on great coats, and fastens goloshes, with the
most nimble readiness, and if you give him a shilling, he hides his
emotion by turning away his head. -
Then comes the washing-up, and them,-painful duty! implying dis:
trust, but which he cheerfully goes through—the counting “the plate.”
After that he is free. The Waiter is cast off—the Greengrocer is
himself again. Exit the butterfly, and enter the grub.
He sits down to supper—and all the good things you had at dinner
are brought out for his meal. He has the choice of the best. The
whole larder is spread on the kitchen-table before him. There is alarge
tankard foaming with fresh beer. There are innumerable glasses of
wine, which he criticises, as he takes a sip of each. His opinion is
greatly respected, for who tastes more wine in the course of his life
than the Greengrocer who waits at parties? The professed cook umbends
to him, and drinks his health out of the pewter, for, independent of his
being a man who pays taxes, he is a talking directory of the whºle º:
bourhood. He is a great personage, for the Greengrocer, in addition to his
other duties, is a large purveyor of situations. Accordingly, if a servant
wishes to “better him or herself,” the Greengrocer is always the great
oracle consulted. He knows the wages of the best houses, the most
becoming liveries, and the perquisites, and the strength of the beer,
attached to each. He is a portable Servant's Bazaar—a living column
of “Want Places,”—but without the usual stipulation on the top,
“All Answers must be prepaid.”
The last person in the house is the Greengrocer. About eleven
o'clock (we are supposing it is a quiet dinner party) the same sound of
heavy feet, or perhaps a little heavier, is º tramping along the hall.
The same mass of great coat, above which now peeps a red comforter,
is seen going out, carrying the same bundle in a coloured handkerchief
It may be that the bundle has grown a trifle larger, for in the fulness
of his heart the Greengrocer has not forgotten he has a wife and family.
In another minute the street-door is bolted. The Greengrocer has
gone home to smoke a pipe by his own fireside.
Beauties without Paint.
THE Picture Cleaning Mania has extended all the way to Holyrood,
where the portraits have most of them been brought to the scrubbi
brush, and are rapidly finding a soap and watery grave. The allege
object of placing the pictures in the hands of the charwoman is to bring
out the colours, and the attempt is so far successful, for in these cases
the colours are most thoroughly brought out, and cannot be brought in
again. Nearly all the pictures we have seen, after their having under-
gone the cleaning process, are remarkable for their similarity of subject,
for they look the pictures of misery.

QIje 3Lamentable 36allab
or
THE FOUNDLING OF SHOREDITCH.
From the Times of Feh. 14.
OME all ye Christian
people, and listen to
my tail,
It is all about a doctor
was travelling by the
rall,
By the Heastern Coun-
ties Railway (vich the
shares I don’t desire),
From Ixworth town in
Suffolk, vich his name
did not transpire.
A travelling from Bury
this Doctor was em-
wº
ith a gentleman, a
friend of his, vich his
name was CAPTAIN
LoyD;
And on reaching Marks
Tey Station, that is
next beyond Colchest-
-er, a lady entered into
them most elegantly
dressed.
She entered into the
Carriage all with a
tottering step,
And a pooty little Bayby
upon her bussum
slep;.
The gentlemen received her with kindness and siwillaty,
Pitying this lady for her illness and debillaty.
She had a fust class ticket, this lovely lady said,
Because it was so lonesome she took a secknd instead,
Better to travel by secknd class, than sit alone in the fust,
And the pooty little Baby upon her breast she must.
A seein of her cryin, and shiverin and pail, .
To her spoke this surging, the Ero of my tail;
Saysee you look unwell, Ma'am, I'll elp you if I can,
And you may tell your case to me, for I’m a meddicle man.
“Thank you, Sir,” the lady said, “I ony look so pale,
ecause I ain’t accustom'd to travelling on the Rale;
I shall be better presnly, when I’ve ad some rest:”
And that pooty little Baby she squeeged it to her breast.
So in comwersation the journey they beguiled, -
CAPTING Loyd and the medical man, and the lady and the child,
Till the warious stations along the line was passed, .
For even the Heastern Counties’ trains must come in at last.
When at Shoreditch tumminus at lenth stopped the train,
This kind meddicle gentleman proposed his aid again.
*Thank you, Sir,” the lady said, “for your kyindness dear;
My carridge and my osses is probbibly come here.
Will you old this baby, please, vilst I step and see?”
The Doctor was a famly man: “That I will,” says he.
Then the little child she kist, kist it very gently,
Vich was sucking his little fist, sleeping innocently.
With a sigh from her art, as though she would have bust it,
Then she gave the doctor the child—wery kind he nust it:
Hup then the lady jumped hoff the bench she sate from,
Tumbled down the carridge steps and ran along the platform.
Wile hall the other passengers vent upon their ways,
The Capting and the Doctor sate there in a maze;
Some vent in a Homminibus, some vent in a Cabby,
The Capting and the Doctor waited with the babby.
There they sate looking queer, for an hour or more,
But their feller passinger neather on 'em sore:
Never, never, back again did that lady come
To that pooty sleeping Hinſnt a suckin of his Thum !
What could this pore Doctor do, bein treated thus,
When the darling Baby woke, cryin for its muss?
Qff he drove to a female friend, vich she was both kind and mild,
And igsplained to her the circumstance of this year little child.
That kind lady took the child instantly in her lap,
And made it very comforable by giving it some pap;
And when she took its close off, what d'you think she found?
A couple of ten pun notes sewn up, in its little gownd.
Also in its little close, was a note which did conwey,
That this little baby’s parents lived in a handsome way:
And for its Headucation they reglarly would pay,
And sirtingly like gentleſolks would claim the child one day,
If the Christian people who'd charge of it would say,
Peradwertisement in the Times, where the baby lay.
Pity of this bayby many people took,
It had such pooty ways and such a pooty look;
And there came a lady forrard (I wish that I could see
Any kind lady as would do as much for me;
And I wish with all my art, some night in my night gownd,
I could find a note stitched for ten or twenty pound)–
There came a lady forrard, that most honorable did say,
She’d adopt this little baby, which her parents cast away.
While the Doctor pondered on this hoffer fair,
Comes a letter from Devonshire, from a party there,
Hordering the Doctor, at its Mar’s desire,
To send the little Infant back to Devonshire.
Lost in apoplexity, this pore meddicle man,
Like a sensable gentleman, to the Justice ran;
Which his name was MR. HAMMILL, a honorable beak,
That takes his seat in Worship Street four times a week.
“O Justice l’” says the Doctor, “instrugt me what to do,
I’ve come up from the country, to throw myself on you; ,
My patients have no doctor to tend them in their ills,
(There they are in Suffolk without their drafts and pills')
“I’ve come up from the country, to know how I’ll dispose
Qf this pore little baby, and the twenty pun note, and the clothes,
And I want to go back to Suffolk, dear Justice, if you please, -
And my patients wants their Doctor, and their Doctor wants his ſeez.”
Up spoke MR. HAMMILL, sittin at his desk,
“This year applica ion does me much perplesk;
What I do advise you, is to leave this babby
In the Parish where it was left, by its mother shabby.”
The Doctor from his Worship sadly did depart—
He might have left the baby, but he hadn’t got the heart,
To go for to leave that Hinnocent, has the laws allows,
To the tender mussies of the Union House.
O
Mother, who left this little one on a stranger's knee,
Think how cruel you have been, and how good was hel
Think, if you’ve been guilty, innocent was she ;
And do not take unkindly this little word of me:
Heavea be merciſul to us all, sinners as we be!
HAPPY AND FIUME-OROUS.
IT is not often that MR. HuME indulges in a joke—for he is eco-
nomical even of his wit—and he avoids humorous as well as all other
extravagance. He did, however, a few evenings ago indulge, in a sally,
which, though coming from the venerable Joseph, might have been
mistaken for an “Old JoE,” but which was really of a rather fresh
and buoyant character. He rose for the purpose of º: for an
address to HER MAJESTY, recommending the abolition of the Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, and at the same time gave, notice of a motion
proposing a drawback on bricks—the point evidently being the coupling
of the Lord Lieutenant with bricks in general. Now the antecedents
of the present Lord Lieutenant prove him to be a brick in the largest
sense of the word, and hence arises the combination, to which we have
though; ourselves justified in prefixing the epithets “happy and Hume-
orous.
O BE DISPOSED OF.—A small Joke Business, doing from six to seven
Puns per day. The dinner connection is good, and capable of improvement, with
an average stock of linen, and appetite moderate. No professed punster or pickpocket
need apply. The concern is only parted with in consequence of the proprietor going
into another line—the penny-a-line. Any person retiring from the latter business, and
having on hand a few Sea Serpents, early Gooseberries, Mermaids, or Earthquakes, not
much the worse for wear, may hear of a purchaser.

GOOD MEASURES FOR THE COLONIES.
J. Russel.L AND Co., Downing Street, Home and Colonial Tailors,
Invite attention to their New System of Colonial Measurement.
WITH joy and pride a parent sees
His #. §. about his knees;
Pleased we regard the tiny elves,”
The little dittos of ourselves;
It is a gratifying sight .
To witness their increasing height,
And mark, as every father knows,
How quickly they outgrow their clothes.
A change of garb, too, must be had,
Soon as the child becomes a lad;
We then select a manlier style
Of clothing for the juvenile.
With little Bulls John Bull, is blest,
'Tis time that they were rightly drest;
Russel LAND Co. will undertake
The requisite costume to make.
With needful measures duly squared,
To meet all wants they’re quite prepared.
Suits they provide for every age,
Of growth according to the stage,
Adapted to each size and ..
Yes; from Australia to the Cape,
Jamaica, Çanada, Ceylon,
Russºll invites to try them on;
# they’re warranted to sit,
Full freedom to combine with fit,
And elegance with what must be
Resistless-strict economy,”
In which all other firms compete
In vain with Russell's, Downing Street.
*...* Measures to order, and a New (Blue) Book will shortly be published.
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE,
o us there is no greater marvel
among the Mysteries of Lon-
don, than what becomes of all
the Clowns, Harlequins, and
Pantaloons when the panto-
Inline season. Is Over. For a
few weeks at Christmas holi-
day-time the metropolis teems
with specimens of the class
alluded to, and we find them
bound together in a bond of
brotherhood, umited into a
human wheel-barrow, piled up
into a pyramid, or groping to-
== gether through the §: of
espair on º in Lon-
don. Out of the pantomime
season the race seems to be-
come extinct, and we never hear of a Clown, for even that remark-
able specimen of humanity “a country Clown” is fast fading away,
and we scarcely ever read of a case of “clownish ignorance.”. It is
true there may be a sprinkling of Clowns in the provinces and else-
where, in the form of “Clowns to the ring” where horsemanship is
going on, but even then there is an enormous surplus of Clowns wholly
unaccounted for, and the Clowns to the ring can embrace but a very
limited circle. -
As the London tomimes are now coming to the close of their
career, we would ask what is to become of the Clowns that will be
thrown upon the wide world, together with the numerous pairs of
Pantaloons and the accumulation of Harlequins who will have to ex-
change the magic wand for far less enchanting wanderi We have
asylums for decayed everythings, and as º tilton cheese
—decays so fast as the gymnastic powers, why do we not have an
asylum for decayed Clowns, Pantaloons, and Harlequins? They are
accustomed to a good deal of buffeting about, but the severest blow of
all must, be, the *. which the withdrawal of the Pantomimes
i. puts to those kicks which are the source of all their
"pence.
REASON Foº. BELIEVING A GENTIEMAN who Has DISHonourED
HIs BILL.-“His word is as good as his bond.”
THE GREAT DUNUP CONTRACTS.
THE commercial world has been a little startled, and the “city”
taken somewhat by surprise, at the announcement of a novel class of
contracts, which seem to offer peculiar advantages to one at least of the
parties concerned: “Perhaps,” says our commercial correspondent,
‘the matter may be better understood from the following advertise-
ments, which have been handed about during the last week on 'Change,
though they have not yet formed the basis of any positive transactions.
We quote one or two specimens of the announcements alluded to.”
“MR. DUNUP is now prepared to receive tenders for the supply of
meat, fuel, and cigars, º: the use of the DUNUP establishment, and
specimens of the articles named may be at once sent in to him under
º: following regulations –
“The Meat Contract will remain open during an unlimited period,
in order that time may be allowed for testing the effects of Free Trade,
and that the contractor may have the fullest opportunity of altering his
prices according to the markets. Every butcher tendering for the
supply must send in a quantity of not less than three pounds per week
of prime beef or mutton, as specimen food, until the contract is either
accepted or declined, and MR. DUNUP does not bind himself to any
particular period for the adjudication, as it is expedient to open the
door—his own private docr-to competition as wide as possible.
“With reference to the article of fuel, MR. DUNUP is now ready to
receive samples of coal in quantities of not less than one hundred
weight, which must be shot at the expense of the parties tendering at
any time between the present date and the 31st of December, 1850,
when the sealed tenders will be opened for the purpose of adjudication.
MR. DuNUP does not bind himself to accept the lowest tender, and he
will require a deposit at the rate of sixpence per sack to cover the
jº. of cellarage, the actual cost of consumption, and the removal
aSIles.
“The parties tendering will not be bound by the quality of their
latest supply, but will be at liberty to amend their tender from time to
time by sending in fresh specimens of superior qualities at any period
before the acceptation or refusal of the contract.
“The rules respecting the tender for the supply of cigars will be the
same as those that have been framed for food and fuel, except that no
particular quantity will be insisted upon, and a single cigar will be
received as a sample from any respectable party desirous of tendering:
Every cigar must be accompanied by a certificate from a duly qualified
chemist, guaranteeing the purity of the leaf, and certifying the non-
employment of the native cabbage in the process of its manufacture. As
each cigar will have to undergo separately the somewhat elaborate
process of smoking, MR. DuNUP will not pledge himself to any limi-
tation of time, which might hastily commit him to a second class
commodity.
“The tenders need not be sealed, but may be waſered, as it is
desired that the parties tendering should be put to no more expense
than is necessary for the due carrying out of the purposes of the
contract.
“Lowness of price, it has been already intimated, will not be an
essential in determining whether the tender will be received, and
persons are invited to keep in view first-rate quality rather than cheap-
ness in the selection of the samples forwarded.
“The contract is not confined to the merchants or manufacturers of
any particular locality; but it has been placed on the broadest basis
so as to allow of its taking in as many as possible.”
FRENCH AND ENGLISH POLICEMEN.
THE Englishman is as laconic as an electric telegraph’s message. The
Frenchman is as lengthy and as pompous as an American President's
message. Observe the difference in the two following expressive
examples.
The English Policeman says briefly and sharply, “Move on there.” "
The French Policeman takes off his hat and says in the blandest
manner, “Messieurs, il faut que je vous prie de ne pas empécher la
circulation.”
The above polite little order, or entreaty rather, will be found in the
Paris correspondence of the Times on the occasion of the late Tree of
Liberty riots. The infuriated mob took off their hats, bowed, and
instantly retired. - - -
t Imagine Policeman X. addressing an English mob in the following
erms :-
“Gentlemen, I should esteem it as a personal favour if you would be
kind enough to disperse, for you may not be aware that by loitering
here you are greatly impeding the general circulation.”
We wºnder if it would have the same effect as “Now, Gents,
move on.’

STRANGE BIRDS IN ENGLAND.
We find from one of the newspaper naturalists
—a most industrious and entertaining class-
that several rare aves have been upon a visit
to this country in consequence of the season's
severity. We have remarked, as an indication of
the probable severity of the session, the pre-
sence lately of some very strange birds in
Parliament.
Some of these strange birds are of the goose
tribe, their peculiarity consisting chiefly in their
being web-footed, which prevents them from
taking a firm stand and often gets them into a
wretched hobble. Among other varieties of rare
ores our attention has been especially called to the
Ampelis Garrulus, or Waxen Chatterer, so called
from its being very soft and very talkative.
Of this class there are several fine Parliamen-
tary specimens now to be seen, but º are
considered excellent game for the keen political
sportsman who delights in bringing them down,
a feat which is rather difficult of achievement,
º a good hit well aimed will often dispose
of the Parliamentary Ampelis Garrulus most
conclusively.
The Colymbus Arcticus, or . Black-throated
Diver, is a very disagreeable bird, whose visit
to our Commons is always marked by extreme
|coldness and severity. The blackness ºf the
throat is attributed by political naturalists to a
sort of black slimy matter generated in the bird
itself, and discharged from the mouth, while
| others think the Diver acquires the quality alluded
to from a habit of diving very much in dark,
troubled, and dirty water.
La-dy. She would pass all her time read-ing no-vels and work-ing cro-chet, but would
ne-glect her house-hold du-ties; so her hus-band, who was a ve-ry nice man, and fond of a
nice din-mer, became a mem-ber of a Club, and used to stop out very late at night, which
led to ma-ny quar-rels. How fool-ish it was of FAN-NY to me-glect her house-hold du-ties,
and not to make her AL-BERT hap-py at home !

THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE HAVING BEEN REQUESTED BY A FRIEND. To Pick HER UP A DAVENPORT, CHEAP, ATTENDS A SALE BY
AUCTION, WHERE SUCH AN ARTICLE IS TO BE DISPosed OF.
SCENE. All the rooms of a “family mansion,” with the “new and
fashionable household furniture,” distributed in a bewildering and
contradictory manner, the beds in the j. the mangle in the
front parlour, the hall chairs and umbrella-stand in the back attic,
the eight-day clock in the back kitchen, the dining-tables in the best
bed-room, and the splendid suit of drawing-room furniture in complete
rout all over the house. The “old and choice cellar ºf wines” has
come up-stairs to the first floor front, and looks uncommonly fresh
about the corks. The genuine oil fictiºn, % the first masters, have
been “collected from the continent,” in Wardour Street and Holborn.
There is a great deal ºf dirt on the hall floor, and the hands of the U
Brokers and Brokers’Men, with a pervading atmosphere of varnish,bass-
matting, shavings, stale tobacco, and fresh porter. Numerous parties,
principally Ladies, are looking at everything, and marking in their
catalogues; Brokers are submitting º furniture to violent tests,
tugging drawers out, jamming them in, tossing, punching,and doubling-
**ions and attresses, rubbing the French polish from chºſ.
fonniers, chairs and tables, and chºpping off mouldings, ornaments, and
salient points from everything that has any.
Unprotected Female (reflects with astonishment over the third eight-day
clock she has met with in an unexpected position). Well, I’m sure, they
seem to have had three and four of everything in this house ! I’ve
counted the rooms and the beds, and there’s at least two beds to a

have ſaid all the carpets. (Sniffs an article of furniture.) They must have

THE LUCKY FAMILY.
ANOTHER ELLIOTT has been added to the ten thousand and one
ELLIoTTs already attached to Ministerial appointments. A foreigner
would imagine that the ELLIOTTs had the monopoly of talent in England,
or else that they were a race as numerous as the SMITHs. The present
reign will be chronicled in future histories as the “Reign of VICTORIA
and the ELLIoTTs.” The last appointment is recorded in the Daily
News of Feb. 11. It seems that the original stock of ELLIOTTs is very
nearly exhausted, and that they are now .." with the persons
who have married into the family. The husband of an ELLIoTT has
been appointed to the office of Engineer at the Admiralty.
The CoBURGs were at one time known as the Lucky Family to marry
into. It was the surest step to rapid promotion. The ELLIOTTs, how-
ever, will soon supersede them. Next to a handsome dowry nothing
will be so valuable as the hand of an ELLIOTT. It will be taken any-
where as equivalent to a ſº £1000 a year at least, and, if the times
are particularly good, will be eagerly smatched at as sure to throw the
happy owner into the best berth at the Admiralty.
MR. HuME should move for a return of all the ELLIoTTs who hold
offices under Government, with specifications of their united ages and
joint incomes.
What's in-a Livery P
THE box-keepers at the Olympic Theatre are dressed in handsome

evening, was greatly alarmed at their #. and, when the box-
keeper asked him for his ticket, he drew him aside, and said, aſter great
hesitation, “My name is ORRIDGE, but I must beg you will not
announce it.” He was evidently labouring under the fear that, the
moment the door of the dress circle was opened, the servant would bawl
out, in the loudest voice, “MR. and Mrs. ORRIDGE" in the same way
that guests are announced at an evening party.

THE LATEST HUDSON TESTIMONIAL.
It is rumoured that the “honourable” member for Sunderland, has applied for
and been actually refused the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. We are glad
to find that the interests of these unhappy hundreds, whose stewardship has
generally been entrusted to any hands, however §§ that have been ready to
accept the trust, are at all events sufficiently cared for to prevent them from
being consigned to the charge of MR. Hudson. Three years ago, he would, no
doubt, have undertaken to make the Chiltern Hundreds so...profitable, that, every
separate hundred of them should pay ten per cent.; and if a company had been
advertised with his name as Chairman of the Board of Directors, to run a
railway to Chiltern direct, with a hundred branches for the accommodation of
all the hundreds, the shares would have come out at four or five premium.
We never exactly understood what the Chiltern Hundreds really are, and our
imagination has wandered ely from a hundred of walnuts to a hundred of
coals; but whatever they may be, they are considered too valuable, at any rate, to
admit of their stewardship being consigned to the individual who has given so
unsatisfactory an account of his stewardship in matters of a more extensive nature.

In republics it is usual to discard titles altogether, but every day brings forth

ductions. One of the greatest puzzles we have met with in this line, is a new

ark, how finely—how logically—SIR PETER, disposes of MR. SIMON. The Man of
Health is utterly demolished by the Knight of Wisdom:—
“He considered that MR. SIMON's Report was quite enough to give any one the cholera. (Laughter). He
warned the Court that, if they were to increase salaries every time they had an interesting Report, next
year their feelings would be harrowed up to the lamentable extent of 1000l. a year, (Laughter). The
amount of 500l. a year was ample remuneration for all the services which could be required from an officer
of health for a population of only 50,000 persons, and he should oppose any increase of amount where there was
no increase of duty.”
SIR PETER’s powers of humour are tremendous. He would be too much for the gravity
of an ape. There was a certain philosopher who died in a fit of laughter, upon seeing a
donkey eat figs. , If, in return, any individual of the race of asses is to be killed by hearin

i |All through Saffron Hill he strove to get in,
THE SUN’S WALK.
THE sun got up from his damp sea bed,
For a tour of observation
He donned his paletot of London º
And his night cap of Thames exhalation,
In whose fleecy haze he wraps up his rays,
When he visits the English nation.
He toddled down to St. Stephen's
On a Wednesday daylight sitting,
And heard Ministers quash a proposal rash,
For the window-tax remitting: |
And the Sun remarked, “They’ve sat in the dark,
Till for dark than light they’re more fitting.”
From St. Stephen's he turned to St. Giles',
Guided less by seeing than smelling,
For he ran his nose ’gainst the walls that rose
Round each damp and darksome dwelling.
“No wonder,” said he, “they won’t admit me,
Lest of such sights Íshould be telling.”
He met his old foe, Fever, -
At his feast in the damp, so goulish;
And heard MR. BUMBLE, at the Poor-rates grumble,
Which struck him as somewhat owlish;
While the guardians who lord o'er the parish board
Are Messrs. Penny-wise and Pound-foolish.
Like mites from old cheese, the houses
Poured forth their squalid dwellers;
The young folks sallow, the old green-yellow,
And all those blanched cheeks were tellers
Of the same sort of tale as the lettuces pale
Grown by amateurs in cellars.
He tried to get into a tenement
Which was let out to these poor creatures,
But each window was barred by the tax so hard
inst a glimpse of his features:
Daylight and fresh air had no business there,
Except as over-reachers.
From out of an open cess-pool
He saw the gas freely wander,
Poisons more and less pure, from gully and sewer-
And it caused the Sun to ponder.
“What harm could it be, if I were as free,
As Mr. Typhus yonder?”
But they wouldn't give him permission: . .
He tried Rosemary Lane and Whitechapel in vain,
'Gainst the tax-gath’rer's opposition;
Till after a while, to a stately pile, .
All amazed, he found free admission.
“Ha! Ha!” thought he, “’tis easy to see,
Here’s a better dispensation:
This no doubt is a home to which old folks come,
Who’ve deserved well of the mation;
A resort for the old age of Industry,
Or a club for people of station.”
He wandered at ease through the passages,
Peeped through windows wide and airy
Roamed the light corridors, upon all the floors,
From the attics down to the area;
When with sudden dismay he heard somebody say
'Twas the Peniten-ti-ary!
Official Changes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
EARL OF HAREWOOD F
ORBIDDING THE BANNS.
OTICE.-In consequence of the continued Practice of overcrowding and taking
ºf. into the cottages of the Harewood Estate (more especially within the village
of Harewood), contrary to the express agreement and regulations: Notice is hereby
given that any Cottager being a Tenant of EARL HAREwood, and who shall from the
date hereof take in any Lodger, or whose Son or Daughter shall marry or bring home
to the cottage, Wife or Husband, without having previously obtained PERMission from the
E. of H., shall receive notice to quit, which notice shall be strictly enforced, and if
in employment of the said E. H., shall be discharged. W. MAUGHAN, Agent.
A NobleMAN in the north of England, has issued the above notice to
his tenantry, prohibiting them from taking lodgers into their cottages,
or allowing a son or daughter to marry and bring home a wife or a
husband, “without having previously obtained permission” from the
peer alluded to. This measure is adopted, on the plea—which is not
a bad one—of preventing the over-crowding of cottages; but we think
we could suggest something better than a prohibition of those ties
which Providence designed should be formed, and which it seems must
not be formed upon certain estates, without the sanction of the landlord,
on pain of ejection from home, and dismissal from employment.
If instead of pulling down cottages on their estates, landlords would
build more, so that it would be unnecessary to crowd those that exist,
with lodgers; and a son or daughter upon marriage, could find another
roof beside that of the parent, the prohibition referred to in this case,
would not be required.
Perhaps, too, if wages were rather better, there would be no neces-
sity for a landlord to forbid the banns, with a view to the prevention
of what, instead of being as they ought to be and might be, happy
and prudent unions, are in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred,
“Improvident Marriages.”
TWELVE MEN IN A BOX.
WE have in our time heard various articles mentioned as the props of
our glorious Constitution, but there has never been any question as to
the fact of “twelve men in a box” affording much material support to
British liberty. ...We admit the truth of the assertion, though, as the
“box” is continually changing its eontents, the twelve º: will
occasionally turn out to be twelve sticks, a circumstance of little con-
sequence, for the props are merely temporary, and one set is being
always replaced by another set, so that the value of liberty is not likely
to suffer much from casual infirmity.
The following paragraph taken from a leader in the Times will throw
a light upon what we have been saying—
“The jury, with that ingenious facility of compromise to which juries alone attain,
pronounced a verdict for the defendant, who had characterised MR. O'Connor as a
swindler, and then expressed their opinion that the honesty of the latter gentleman
‘stood unimpeached.’”
We were as much puzzled as our contemporary at the result alluded
to in the above extract, but as our Constitution is often said to be
a perfectly consistent whole, though made up of a mass of apparent
conflicting particles, we must believe that great Constitutio
authority, a British jury, to be always, right in the main, though
apparently coming to a conclusion involving the most palpable con-
tradictions. How a man can be pronounced a swindler without having
been libelled, or suffered the smallest impeachment of his character, is
to us a riddle, which we cannot hope, and will not attempt to, elucidate.
The decisiºn in the case before us reminds us of the old, Irish, verdict
9. Murder, and served him right;” for the jury in MR. FEARGus
O'ConnoR's case, say in effect, that the defendant was justified in
abusing the plaintiff, but that his character remains unimpeached.
There seems to us to have been a by no means “soft impeachment,”
which if unmerited—as he jury decided it was—should, we imagine,
have entitled the plaintiff to damages. . If a man has his eyes blacked,
his nose broken, and his teeth knocked out by an assault, it would be
be very hard when he appeals to the law, to be told to his very teeth,
and in the very face of his damaged features, that he is none the worse
and that his assailant is acquitted. Such is the consolation MR. FEAR-
Gus O'ConnoR has experienced. He goes into Court, declaring he has
been beaten black and blue in reputation. The defendant does not
deny, but justifies the treatment, he has offered to the plaintiff, who,
when he seeks redress, is told “there, run along, go away, you’re not
hurt in the least; and the person who has attacked you is not guilty
of any thing.”
A PRETTY PALR.
It is suggested that Mr. FEARGus O'Connor and Mr. Hudson had
better pair off immediately.
THE LIMBO OF GREATNESS.
MADAME Tussaud may be called the old clotheswoman—the second-
hand broker of this world's pomp. “The greatest price given for left-
off vanities” might be written over her doorway; and as the
dangling black doll indicates—though wherefore, we must write and
ask the editorial conjuror of Notes and Queries, to know-that rags
are purchased within, so should a tin crown and wooden sceptre, sus:
pended in Baker Street, give commercial, notice tº the heirs and
executors of departed greatness. At the sale at Marlborough House,
MADAME Tussaud has been an adventurous purchaser.
“The full-length portraits of their late Majesties, GEongs THE THIRD and QUEEN
CHARLorts, formerly occupying positions in the grand dining-room, and ticketed at
£50 each, have found favour in the sight of MADAME Tussaulo, in whose saloon they
will henceforth be associated with their prototypes in wax."
That the father of his people, and the mammato match, should be
made part and parcel of a shilling show ! ...That pictures, so sincerely
venerated, so passionately idolised in the life-time of their originals, i.
should be treated with no more reverence than the daub of any “King's
Head” that swings and creaks at the door-way of an ale-house! There
is a neglect, a want of gratitude in this, that is melancholy-depressing:
We think the rightful reverence of folks in high places is perilled by a
custom that associates their relics with a twelvepenny treat. Panch

CIVIL WORDS COST SOMETHING.
ONE would . that there was no great harm in askin for a
thing, even if nothing was to be got by it; but the fact is, that, if
nothing is got by it, a great deal is lost by it when asking takes the
form of a petition to Parliament. It is to be wished that people who
are always wanting impossibilities would be satisfied with a refusal, and
take an answer once for all, instead of going to the legislature annually
with a request which, if it leads to no Bill, in either House, saddles
John BULL with a printing and stationery bill of no ordinary magnitude.
It is true enough that Parliament gives nothing unless it is asked, but
there is so much unnecessary axeing as to call loudly for the pruning-
knife...The teetotallers have spent a little fortune of the public money
in petitioning that all the spirit shall be taken out of the army and navy,
while the petitions for economy have been poured in and printed at such
an extravagant rate, that a large amount of taxation is absolutely
necessary to pay for them. - -
Civil words, we are told, cost nothing; but the number of civil words
addressed to the legislature would form a very formidable item among
the Civil Contingencies. Every one who has a wish, and chooses to
turn it into wishy-washy language, hashes up a petition, and gets some
Member to move that it be printed, when forthwith John BuuL has to
pay a heavy sum, because SNooks is anxious to see the Hindoos pro-
vided with cop boºks, or Murray's Grammars distributed among the
Yahoos, or would like to see the duty taken off everything; or because
SNoBBINs wants a Charter, with eight or nine new points to it.
We appreciate at its utmost value the privilege of
Parliament, but we like moderation in everyt -
petitioning is carried on in these days with somewhat too little regard
to either reason or economy. It seems that there is annually a very
large sum expended in simply folding petitions; so that, in addition to
the outlay for printing them, it costs not a trifle to double up and do
for them. If the legislature would, make a point of giving us good
measures without waiting to be asked, the trouble and expense of
petitioning or printing petitions would di very rapidly.

TAKING STEPS FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT.
“WELL, MY FRIENDs, You seem to Hold AN ORDINARY AT THE STEPs
of My Door EveRY DAY AT 12.”
CLIMBING UP THE NORTH POLE.
Of all foreign climes there must be none so difficult to get to the top
of as the North Pole. We feel convinced that no one but a Bedouin
Arab will ever do it, unless perhaps it is MR. STILT, for, in standing on
his head on the top of a pole, that gentleman has reached the very
summit of his profession. By the way, what a position for a brilliant
display of fireworks! - -
}. for ourselves, knowing “how hard it is to climb,” we shall, leave
the North Pole in the hands of others. We are perfectly content with
Mr. BURFORD's Panorama. , An iceberg is a kind of obstacle we should
never attempt to get through, especially with the chilly conviction that
we should, only be met on the opposite side with another iceberg. An
ocean, with a splitting, stunning set of icebergs, continually dancing reels
and quadrilles, is not exactly the kind of society we feel anxious to plunge
into. We prefer ALMACK's, with the ices provided by GUNTER.
It is true that the Aurora Borealis is a very magnificent sight, and
we imagine MR. BURFORI must have borrowed Aurora's rosy fingers to
have painted the beautiful one he has hung round his Arctic first-floor.
Still the feeling that if you put your head out of window to look at it,
you immediately lose your nose, must take away a great deal from the
leasure, for the wind is so cutting on those Snow Hills, that no Turk's
ead could possibly hang out for an hour without being cut to pieces.
Besides, toujours. Aurora Borealis must eventually prove a bore, for
however, successful, a thing may be on its first appearance, very few of
us would like, to sit it out for 200 consecutive nights and days. The
Aurora Borealis is a substitute for the sun, or rather it is a sun done
in colours. The effect is not unlike the reflection at night from a
chemist's window. Fancy Trafalgar Square lighted up with a string of
§Avoy and MooRE's green and pink bottles, and you have the Aurora
Borealis brought at one coup d'ail to your mind's eye, but with this
improvement, that there is not anything half so ugly at the North Pole,
as the National Gallery.
The streets, and lanes, and courts, and squares, are all formed in the
Arctic Regions, of ice,—of immense high walls of ice. Picking your way
is very difficult, as none of the streets are named, or the houses num-
bered, and you lose yourself before you know where you are. Building
is carried there to a greater extent, even than it is round London. You
É. to sleep in an open field of water, and, on waking up, find yourself
emmed in by a floating row of crescents and towering palaces of ice
that must strike a chill, into the boldest heart. It must be very
awkward when a ship gets into a cul-de-sac/ What a turn it must
give them, or rather, what would they not give to be able to turn and
get themselves out of their awkward scrape. We cannot imagine a
greater "tarnation fix.” There the ship is held between the two dead
walls of crystal as in a nut-cracker, and if the walls close in the least,
the shipis cracked as easy as a monkey cracksanut. The narrow streets of
the City are bad enough when one of PICKFORD's yams comes galloping
down, and you have only just time to nail your body to the ji as thin
as a picture, to save yourself being crushed; but what must it be then
at the North Pole, where there are no Mews, morasingle shop where you
can run into
MR. BHRFORD's, Panorama suggests all these frozen horrors without
painting them. The water is so natural, that you cannot believe it is
done in oil. The ice sets everybody's teeth on the chatter; the ladies'
teeth, with the proverbial loquacity of the sex, chattering, of course
more than the gentlemen's. Taken altogether, it is the most beautiful
bit of frieze-painting our eyes ever, watered in looking at. In
summer, it be quite a Magnetic Pole, for the coolness of the spot
will be sure to attract all on to it., What a superb luncheon-
roºm it wºuld make for FARRANCE, during the dog-days!
N.B. There is a long pole exhibited with some fur dresses in the
room; and as many persons have allowed their curiosity to be stirred
up by this long Pole, and handle, it and look upon it evidently as a
Very great curiosity, we are requested by MR. BURFoRD to state, that
the pole in question is not the North Pole, nor has it, for what he
knows, any connexion with it.
PUFF PASTE.
Our eyes have lately been arrested by what may be termed the very
mºan process of a summons to stay our further proceedings, and turn
into sundry small shops in the metropolis to eat A FREE-TRADE PIE.
This alleged luxury is advertised as juicy with the meats of Smithfield,
succulent with the savoury kidney, ambrosial with the fish of Billings:
gate, and gushing with the luscious syrup starting from the plethoric
pores of thºvernal rhubarb. Such is the confidence of the speculators
in these puff paraded patties, that a reward of £5000 is offered to any
one who can produce (at the price) “a larger and a better” pie. The
connection between Free Trade and the pie in question is by no means
obvious, nor has any attempt been made in the placard before us to
*::: where, how, why, or in what respect such connection exists.
here is a pretended quotation from EPICURUs, and several great
men of antiquity are cited apropos of the pie, but the only hero of
the past whose name is appropriate to ::::::::: mean, of course, our
9ld friend PIE-Us AFNEAs—is by some accident overlooked. We have
in our time had much experience in articles of this description, and
there was a time, ere sober reflection had taught us to curb the
sharpness of our expressions, that we were seldom long without some-
* tart in our mouth.
..We have learnt at the cost of experience—and many halfpence—that
size is no test of º , and that in pastry, as in mankind, excellence
is not always to those looked upon as the great. If we had known how
to moralise upon a pie before eating it—which we never could—we
should have said “Trust not to that which seems externally overflowing
with goodness, for the sweetness that is always Fº to rise to the
surface is soon exhausted, and is often a proof of hollowness within.”
Apropos of pies, we will conclude with one fact in Natural History,
founded on long observation, and we should be glad if Von HUMBOLDT,
TIDE-MAN, Untidy-man, or any man, would exp to us the mystery
which we have discoverei -
We want to know, and we ask the simple, question of the whole of
the natural historians now living, how it is that all pigeons of which
pigeon pies are made, have each four legs. If there is any doubt as to
the fact being as we have stated, let any, one buy a pigeon pie at a
pastry-cook’s...let him compare the protruding claws or “tootens” with
the number of birds below the crust, and if it is not found that there
are four of the former to one of the latter, we will eat our own words,
and—what will be worse still—a Free-Trade pie.
THE INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS.
THE admirable º; of PRINCE ALBERT to hold in this country
an Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations has excited unusual interest,
which has extended even to the chevaliers d’industrie of France,—an
order which it is expected will be largely represented at the forthcoming
gathering. These gentlemen will, it is expected, exhibit various proofs
of their industry, which is emphatically the industry of all nations, for
there is not a nation on the earth which does not contain among its
eople several who have at their fingers' ends the industry alluded to.
Such arrangements will, however, no doubt, be adopted, as will restrain
the specimens of this sort of industry within as narrow limits as possible,
and any chevalier found in the practice will, whatever his apparent
station, be brought at once to the station of police in the immediate
neighbourhood. It is said that most of the American States will con-
tribute specimens of their ingenuity, but Pennsylvania declines sending
anything to England, which contains already so many proofs of what it
can do, in the i. of numerous creditors who have been done by its
cunning device of repudiation.

SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF
MR. JONES, AS SOME REPARATION FOR THE GREAT FAILURE OF THE PRIVATE Box, HAS INDUCED THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE TO ACCOMPANY

Friday night. JoNEs and the UNPROTECTED FEMALE make
their way with some difficulty through the crowd of Orange-sellers,

for vendors of tickets.

A GOVERNOR BURIED ALIVE.
ONE of the most extraordinary cases of premature
interment that has ever come to our knowledge has
recently been given in the German, and copied into
the English newspapers. A remarkable feature of the
affair is that the sepulture has been quite voluntary on
the part of the individual buried, and that he has
caused the vault to which he has consigned himself to
be fitted up with much splendour, as if he was under
the influence of a kind of vaulting ambition, which he
has taken those unusual means to gratify. The annexed
paragraph, which has almost as much of the gay as of
the grave about it, will explain the circumstances under
which a Governor has become, as it were, his own
Shillibeer, and performed his own funeral:—
“The cold is so severe at Kamtschatka that the Governor has
been compelled to quit his usual residence at St. Peter and St. Paul
to bury himself under the earth—that is to say, he has retired to
his subterranean Palace, which is 20 metres below ground, and is
capable of accommodating 200 persons. This palace is perpetually
lighted by lamps. Most wealthy private persons have dwellings of
N-V this kind, but it is rarely cold enough to induce them to flee thither
S" for refuge.”—Hamburgh Borsenhalle.
This underground residence is evidently a luxury in
Kamtschatka, though we suspect that even in the coldest
seasons that part of our, population which lives in
underground kitchens or cellars from necessity, and not
from choice, would willingly exchange their subterra-
nean apartments with the chilly Governor, for the
coldest garret, in his dominions. His Kamtschatkian
Highness can have little room for, exercise, and a walk
about his grounds must be anything but cheerful or
salubrious. The fact of most wealthy persons having
a subterranean residence, gives us the idea of º e
below stairs being carried to the highest, or rather to
the lowest, pitch in Kamtschatkian society. At the balls
ce most in vogue is, of course, the Cellar-ius.
ANOTHER PEERAGE.-It is rumoured, only we do not
believe the rumour, and hope the reader will display the
same intelligence, that MR. DISRAELI is to be made a
Peer, for the º of getting him out of the House
of Commons. He will assume no title, it is said, but
merely change his name to UPPER BENJAMIN.

THE STREET OPERA SEASON.
^ ENERALLY before the opening of Her
Majesty's and Covent Garden Theatres
(for which BALFE and Costa are making
their usual preparations,) the Street
Qpera season commences, and we now
find vocalists, as well, as instrumen-
talists, in every walk along the public
thoroughfares.
The old stringed quartette of four
blind double basses has reinforced its
instrumental power with a new stock
of catgut, which supplies three or four
strings that have been missing for
some years, and we have now a com-
pleteness of effect which was difficult
to attain'when the executants had to
deal with defective instruments.
Aſseventh trombone has been added
to the brass band of nine, and, in
order to give effect to martial music,
a triangle has been attached to the
elbow and knee of the cornet-à-piston
. . who renders his ºf: on both of
his instruments very conscientiously. The celeb basso-prºfondo
in a sailor's costume has acquired fresh depth since last season by an
extra hoarseness, which gives great additional aplomb, at a slight sacrifice
of power. His “Will you love me then as noto?” may be looked upon
as a perfect triumph of nothing overeverything." . . .

THE WOLE OF EXETER HALL."
SoME little time ago we had occasion to take contemptuous notice of
the animadversions of a pseudo-sanctified newspaper called the Record
upon the directors of Exeter Hall for permitting SHAKSPEARE to be
read in that half-conventicle, half-concert room. The Exeter Hall
directory, we understand, has objected to the further use of the Hall
for SHAKSPEARE tºº. because certain MAwwoºt Societies
renting portions of the building, threatened to quit. if, any more
SHAKspeARE were suffered in it. Yet songs, many frivolous, not a
few of questionable tendency, are allowed every Wednesday, where
SHAKSPEARE's noble º and true philosophy may not be heard. It
has been remarked with disgust that *:::: the Exeter Hall i. has
been included a coarse and vulgar one celebrating murder and robbery:
and sung nowhere else but at Free-and-Easies, called." The Wolf.”
That, however, is not the kind of Wolf that is the most odious there.
The worst Exeter Hall Wolf—the Wolf with truly hideous howl—is
the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.

THE SELF-ASSERTION OF SUNDAY.
BACKED by a numerously and º signed petition, I demand
the total discontinuance of Post-Office Labour during my twenty-four
hours. My objection to such labour altogether is quite different from
the cant of my pretended partisans, who howled against Ministers for
employing a few London postmen during part of me, in order that many
postmen in the country throughout the whole of me might rest.

But, apart from higher considerations, all who possibly can ought to
have a holiday once a week, and I am the day for it. I do not want to
be forced upon anybody, but this I will say: that to compel the con-
scientious to disregard me is persecution; and all should at least enjoy
the option of observing me; that is to say, the Christian Sabbath, or

OLD BALLEY CANNON-BALLS.
MR. Edwarn KENEALY, barrister and late candidate for Dublin
University, has been held to bail to appear, without wig or gown, on
the shadyside of the Old Bailey bar, charged with the grossest cruelty
to his child. We shall give no opinion of the case, further than to hope
that MR. KENEALY may clear himself of the accusation; otherwise we
know of no process that can return the learned gentleman, sweet, and
wholesome again to the fraternity of barristers. MR. BURNIE, a legal
friend of the accused, very solemnly declared, that—
“If he went to the sessions, it would be his duty to defend a grand principle, and he
should speak cannon-balls.”
If evidence bear out the charge, we take it nothing short of cannon-
balls can be of any avail to Mr. KENEALY ; certainly cannon-balls
discharged from brass ordnance.

LORD BROUGHAM'S EXHIBITION FOR 1850.
LoRD BRqugh AM was, among the higher Westminster personages
who met tº discourse of the appointed Exhibition of 1851. There was
some excellent talk. The good EARL of CARLISLE delivered himself
with his characteristic earnestness and elegance. Then came the
French Ambassador; then London's Bishop; then Prussia spoke
through CHEVALIER BUNSEN; then America gave utterance, in the
words of MR. Lawrence. All proceeded in the most cordial manner:
everybody full of satisfaction, everybody, animated by the hearty an
enlightened sentiments variously delivered. This unanimity, however,
could hardly please LoRD BRough AM. The cordiality of the meeting
was almºst an affront to himself; it was plain, he was restless under
the good-humour delivered and enjoyed about him. Whereupon, he
got himself to move a resolution, that, after his best manner, he might
throw two or three squibs and crackers amongst the rejoicing people
gathered together. is Lordship was, of course, successful. Nothing
but cheers and plaudits had been heard untiloºp Brough AM opened
his mouth. Then came the difference; for his Lordship—departing
from a consideration of the º: to be exhibited at the great com:
mercial, festival, of 1851—suddenly fell upon that day of special
constables, April 10, 1848; that day when every one held himself over
to keep the , and perfectly succeeded. Adverting to the sights to
be presented to the eyes of our foreign guests—
“He hoped we should not have the trouble, further, of showing them—but if occasion
arose, we should show them—howhere such spectacles as that of the 10th of April, 1848,
are received.” (Cheers and Hisses.)
Then, pleasantly stimulated by the sibilation, BRough AM continued,
saying:-
“We should show them that, although preparations are made on such occasions by
the Queen's Government to preserve the Queen's peace, such preparations are not
needed, for that the citizens themselves at once put down, as quietly as effectually, the
miserable despicable attempt at disturbance.” (Renewed Cheers and Hisses.)
It is with this feeling that, as we understand, LoRD BRough AM pro-
poses to contribute an instrument that, in the very triumph of the
show, shall—like the skeleton at the º banquet-callup dismal
thoughts, to overcast and sadden the reveſ. On the 10th of April, 1848,
LoRD BRough AM was a most distinguished Special Constable; the
admiration of servant maids, and the terror of little boys, who—when
become the oldest inhabitants of their parish—will no doubt tell their
§º. of the grace and agility of BRough AM and WAux.
ell, it is his Lordship's intention to contribute to the Exhibition the
identical staff—now a precious |º of history—with which he
entered on his special duty. That staff, in the like manner that yews
and cedars are dwarfed into trees of inches—that staff contains within
itself the whole bulk and massiveness of the British oak. The acorn
was planted by CARACTAcus—the bark of the flourishing tree was
carved by KING ALFRED, and the whole timber compressed into one
small weapon for the special hands of a BRough AM. flecting on the
origin, and history of the staff, we are not surprised that, even at so
eaceful a meeting as that, of the inhabitants of Westminster, his
É. should flourish the bit of oak about him, with the vivacity of
an Irishman at Donnybrook Fair.

CHANCERY IN DANGER.
(Draught of a Petition to the House of Commons.)
--
WE, the undersigned, loyal subjects of HER MAJESTY, warmly at-
tached to all our time honoured institutions, and in particular to the
High Court of Chancery, beg leave humbly to approach your Honourable
House, and pray you not to pass any measure calculated to abridge or
simplify the proceedings of that, Court, wherein we, your Petitioners,
have vested interests.
We submit that practitioners in equity have a prescriptive right to
a portion of the property of this country, represented by the average
amount which is spent in litigation respecting the same.
We are prepared to furnish your Honourable House with returns,
showing the number of suicides and cases of insanity, referrible, during
a term of years, to the working of the Court of Chancery. We entreat
you to consider that inquests are generally paid for at so much each,
that cases of derangement give rise to commissions of lunacy, and also
exert a material influence on the number of inmates of asylums for the
insane. We therefore implore your Honourable House not to assent to
any measure, which, by limiting the operation of Chancery in the
respects abovementioned, will diminish the customary business, and
abridge the regular gains of your petitioners. And your petitioners as
by interest bound will ever vote, &c.

Chancery Barristers, Coroners, and Keepers of Lunatic Asylums.

"A
THE BOLD SMUGGLER who walks THE STREETS.
You know the Bold Smuggler at once, because there is nothing nautical about his appearance.
He does not wear a blue-striped shirt—nor pumps—nor a belt-nor a straw hat-nor loose
canvas trousers. More than this, to prove how little he has to do with the sea, he wears
races. He looks infinitely more like a stolen-dog-seller than a Bold Smuggler. -
The Smuggler's haunts are principally at shop windows. The West End is his favourite
cruise. He picks up the best prizes in the rich channels of Regent Street. -
The way in which the Smuggler captures a prize is very easy. When a simple-looking craft
anchors in front of a print shop, he runs in alongside of him. He pours a broadside, a very
mild one at first, rising no higher than a whisper, such as, “D'ye want any cigars, Sir? you
shall have 'em very cheap.” But if that makes no impression, the next broadside is thrown in
a little stronger, being compounded of “Chinay dresses—walenscenes lace-French cambric
hankychiefs—Injayshawls,” and similar deadly ingredients, that are generally fatal for presents.
But the young craft mostly surrenders at the first shot, and then all the Smuggler has to do
is to tow him quietly into some secluded little creek where he can plunder him at his leisure.
This towing requires most clever tacking. The Preventive Service (the Police) may be on
the look-out, and give chase. This seldom occurs, however, for the Smuggler knows all the
stations of the Police, and manages to steer pretty clear of them. -
The Prize at last is run on shore. The bay is a public house in some narrowinlet of a street.
They sail rapidly through the bar, clear the yard at the back-and there, into some dark, cave
of a washhouse, where neither the eye of man, nor the bull's-eye of the police, can penetrate,
is the prize quietly hauled. It is all done without a breath being heard. The Smuggler has
long ceased to say a syllable in favour of his “prime cheroots.” There is not even the
creaking of a boot to disturb the silence of the gloom. . . - -
A door is unlocked. The Prize is requested to walk in. No hospitable ray shines from
within to guide his wavering steps. The Smuggler in charity seizes his hand, and acts as
a friendly lugger to the unhappy craft he has captured. - - -- - -
The first sound that grates upon the ear of the sleeping silence is the striking of a lucifer-
match. In another minute a weak tallow candle endeavours to throw a light on the black-
ness of the scene. There is more silence, more, darkness, and more luciferºmatches. At
last the candle is really lighted, and illuminates the thick figure of a second Smuggler, that
during the struggle has tiptoed into the gloomy cave. - - -
Then the plunder begins. What rich shawls are unfolded, and held up in all their breadth,
and draped over the Smuggler's expansive shoulders, to display their inviting richness!
They seem large enough to cover Hyde Park, and with colours so gay that a lady would not
be happy till she had folded them to her, heart. Cambric stores are curiously fingered and
violeniſy stared through, to investigate their delicate fineness. , Little violet-coloured boxes,
full of the creamiest laces, as tender as cobwebs, are emptied on the dirty table, whilst
the Bold Smugglers exchange entertaining fables about their marvellous origin and value.
But where are the cigars? True!. JIM will run out and fetch the box. It doesn't do to
* their store here on account of the Excise. They’re so precious sharp, -
he Smuggler No. 2 is soon back again. He couldn't find the box, but he can give
the gen’ſ'man two or three as a specimen of the lot. They’re the primest Hawannahs, and
couldn’t behad not for three times the money anywhere else.
The cigars are * The genºman has his doubts as to their authenticity, and modestly

ultimately puts down two pounds
Hereupon the Prize gets alarmed. He gently
states that he does not wish to make any pur-
chases to-day, and hints a pressing desire to go
home-a desire which elicits all the ferocious
daring of the Smuggler. He plants his big back
against the door, and roughly insinuates “that
trick won't do. . He doesn’t stir from this 'ere
place till he has bought sumfin. It’s very likely
they’re a going to let him loose to run and give
information agin' 'em. They’ve been served
that dodge once too often. How do they know
he’s not an Excise Officer in disguise? So he
must purchase sumfin, and then he’s as much in
their power, as they are in his'n. The gen’I’mn
must excuse him, but they’re, poor folk, and
they can’t risk, their necks on the igh seas just
to be put in jail for muffen.”
There is no escape. The Prize, evidently, will
not be sent adrift till he has been cleaned out.
The Smugglers look threatening. Their black
faces grow blacker with rage—they whisper
together, and growland cough most forebodingly.
The Prize amends his opinion touching the cigars.
They are not so bad as he thought at first. A
negociation of peace is then entered into, and he
for a box of
the “best Hawannahs,” and a couple of cambric
handkerchiefs.
The money, is paid, and the Smuggler re-
minds him that º have not got the cigars with
them. But he will give the gen’l'man a receipt
for the money, and he promises the box shall
be left to-morrow at the Fleece Inn, in Holborn,
before six o'clock. What name shall it be left
lm
The Prize gives his card, the goods are packed
away in their former hiding place, and he and
the Bold Smugglers saunter out together. As
they pass through the bar, he is astonished to
hear the landlord call one of his comrades back
with the curious intimation “that those four
cigars have not been paid for.”
For a whole week he enquires regularly once
a day, at the Fleece Inn, “if a box of cigars has
not been "ief there in the name of Apº
SIMPLETON ?”
As for the cambric handkerchiefs, they are
given to the housemaid the next day for dusters.
A month afterwards our Prize hails in Regent
Street the self-same Smuggler. He tells him that
he has never received the Havannahs, and inno-
º requests to have his two pounds returned
O 111m.
The Bold Smuggler laughs boldly in his
face, and denying #. acquaintance, as well as
his debt, gives him more than the amount of it
in abuse and blackguardism—for every Smuggler
knows that however rich a Prize may be the first
time, there is no chance of ever catching him a
second.
Young Prizes that float up from the country,
laden with boundless treasures, should beware of
the Bold Smugglers that infest the streets of
London! You invariably pay through the nose
for smuggled goods, more especially for cambric
pocket handkerchiefs and cigars.
The Very Latest Secret.

terial confidence, instating, that a certain worthy
wise, and weighty Alderman is about to be raised

THE TREE OF LIBERTY IN FRANCE.
Down, Frenchmen, with your Tree of Liberty,
The wretched emblem of an empty boast !
Clear ye away the sapless mockery,
Now, nothing but an inconvenient post;
And chop it into logs to burn
That it may serve some useful tum.
“Sapless, you say. Good stranger, look again,
And you’ll discern it is a living tree.”
In faith 'tis true—its buds I see quite plain,
Blossom and leaf, distinct as they can be.
Nay, I can e'en distinguish now,
Fruit, thick and full, on every bough.
Seeming, erewhile, a dead old poplar—lo!—
–Only to think how outward sense deceives!—
View'd closer, 'tis a flourishing wild sloe,
For prickles having bayonets; swords for leaves:
And it bears cannot-shot, and bombs,
And musket-bullets for its plums.
To the revision of the mind's eye, thus,
Paris, thy Tree of Liberty appears,
Which thou didst plant, with such a world of fuss,
Since but a little less than two short years:
Sword-law and Soldier-rule its fruit—
A mighty Tree indeed—to shoot.
To outward view 'tis still a wither'd trunk,
What other was it ever like to be
Transplanted—sure, by people mad or drunk—
In its green youth, what hope of such a Tree ?
If Freedom's timber you would grow,
You must not think to rear it so.
No: first, your care must duly set in earth
The seed—your acorn is the only kind—
And then the Tree must be mured, from birth,
To brave the nipping frost and stormy wind,
And of the lightning to defy,
Reaching its proud arms to the sky.
This is the sole true Tree of Liberty,
Fixed in the soil with everlasting roots;
Beneath its shade thrives peaceful industry;
Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and Order, are its fruits.
Then burn your Maypoles, worhy folk,
And cultivate the British Oak.
A MODEL WOMAN.
We hear that a statue—an embodiment of the perfection of a woman
-is, about to be erected on the heights of Foſkstone; a statue that
shall carry with it a great moral lesson. It is no other than the Statue
of a Woman (about to travel)—with only one portmanteau.
How. To ADVANCE IN THIS WoRI.D.—Let your advances be like
thºse of a pawnbroker, who never makes a single advance unless he is
quite sure that “it is the ticket.”—Our Prophetic Soul.
WAITING AT THE STATION.
WE are amongst a number of people waiting for the Blackwall train
at the Fenchurch Street Station. me of us are going a little farther
than Blackwall—as far as Gravesend; some of us are going even farther
than Gravesend—to Port Philip, in South Australia, leaving behind the
patriaefines and the pleasant fields of old England. It is rather a queer
sensation to be in the same boat and station with a party that is going
upon so prodigious a journey. One speculates about them with more
than an ordinary interest, thinking of the difference between your fate
and theirs, and that we shall never behold these faces again.
Some eight-and-thirty women are sitting in the large Hall of the
station, with bundles, baskets, and light baggage, waiting for the
steamer, and the orders to embark. A few friends are taking leave of
them, bonnets are laid together, and whispering going on. A little cry-
ing is taking place;—only a very little crying, Hand among those who
remain, as it seems to me, not those who are going away. They leave
behind them little to weep for; they are going from bitter cold and
hunger, constant want . unavailing labour. "Why should they be
sorry to #. a mother who has been so hard to them as our country has
been? How many of these women will ever, see the shore again, upon
|ine brink of which they stand, and from which they will depart in a few
|minutes more? It makes one sad and ashamed too, that they should
not be more sorry. But how are you to expect love where you have
| given such scanty kindness? If you saw jº. children glad at the
| thoughts of leaving you, and for ever: would you blame yourselves or
them? It is not that the children are ungrateful, but the home was
unhappy, and the parents indifferent or unkind. You are in the wrong
under whose government they only had neglect and wretchedness; not
they, who can’t be called upon to love such an unlovely thing as misery,
or to make any other return for neglect but indifference and aversion.
You and I, let us suppose again, are civilised persons. We have been
decently educated: and live decently every day, and wear tolerable
clothes, and practise cleanliness: and love He arts and graces of life.
As we walk down this rank of eight-and-thirty female emigrants, let us
fancy that we are at Melbourne, and not in London, and that we have
come down from our sheep-walks, or clearings, having heard of the
arrival of forty honest, well-recommended young women, and having a
natural longing to take a wife home to the 3. * *. of these would
you like? If you were an Australian Sultan, to which of these would
you throw the handkerchief? I am afraid not one of them. I fear, in
our present mood of mind, we should mount horse and return to the
. preferring a solitude, and to be a bachelor, rather than to put
up with one of these for a companion. There is no girl here to tempt
you by her looks; (and, world-wiseacre as you are, it is by these you are
principally moved)—there is no pretty, º, red-cheeked, rustic,+ro
neat, trim, little grisette, such as what we call a gentleman might cast
his eyes upon without too much derogating, and might find favour in
the eyes of a man about town. No; it is a homely bevy of women with
scarcely any beauty amongst them—their clothes are decent, but not
the least picturesque—their faces are pale and care-worn for the most
part—how, indeed, should it be otherwise, seeing that they have known
care and want all their days?—there they sit upon bare benches, with
dingy bundles, and great cotton umbrellas—and the truthis, you are not
a hardy colonist, a feeder of sheep, a feller of trees, a hunter of kam-
garoos—but a London man, and my lord the Sultan’s cambric handker-
chief is scented with Bond Street perfumery—you put it in your pocket,
and couldn’t give it to any one of these women.
They are not like you, indeed. They have not your tastes and feelings:
your education and refinements. They would not understand a hundred
things which seem perfectly simple to you. They would shock you a
hundred times a day by as many deficiencies of politeness, or by out-
rages upon the Queen's English—by practices entirely harmless, and
yet in your eyes actually worse than crimes—they have large hard
hands and clumsy feet. The women you love must have pretty soft
fingers that you may hold in yours: must speak her language properly,
and at least when you offer i. your hearſ, must return hers with its
h in the right place, as she whispers that it is yours, or you will have
none of it. If she says, “O Hedward, I ham so unappy to think I shall
never becld you agin,”—though her emotion on leaving you might be
perfectly tender and genuine, you would be obliged to laugh. If she
said, “Hedward, my art is yours for hever and hever,” (and anybody
heard her), she might as well stab you, -you couldn’t accept the most
faithful affection offered in such terms—you are a town-bred man, I say,
and your handkerchief smells of Bond Street musk and millefleur. A
sun-burnt settler out of the Bush won’t feel any of these ..".

because her hands are coarse and her ancles thick: but he will take
her back to his farm, where she will nurse his children, bake his dough,

But between you, an educated Londoner, and that woman, is not the
union absurd and impossible? Would it not be unbearable for either ?
Solitude would be incomparably pleasanter than such a companion.—

“In Saturday's paper,
by a typographical acci-
dent, the commencement
of SIR. J. WALsh's speech
was omitted in the sum-
mary of the debate in the
House of Commons, and
to MR. REYNoLDs.”
An “accident” of
be such a very lucky
one, that the occur-
rence of a few more
such “accidents,” which might easily be “done on purpose,” would
be an immense boon to the Newspaper Reading Community.
The occasional omission of the first half of one speech, and the last
half of another, would effect a saving of exactly fifty per cent on the
whole amount, and would cause an economy of the editor's space and
the reader's time, that both parties would appreciate. Considering
how many speakers come to a conclusion quite independent of what
they have been alleging in the first portions of their harangues, there
could not be much harm done by the reporters now and then beginning
at the end of a speech, or leaving off in the middle. A much more
truthful picture of the debates would thus be afforded, for many of the
Orators speak to no *:::: end; and, of a great many others, the
only valuable part of the speech is the conclusion or stoppage.
It must have been rather annoying to the parties concerned in the
above typographical mélange, but we dare say SIR John WALsh's
wind-up did quite as well with ºut any commencement of its own, and
that MR. REYNoLDs's exordium fitted in at the beginning, just as well
as the one that had been made for it. We wish our daily contemporary
would introduce a series of these Parliamentary cross-readings, by
which a great portion of the debates that are now without any interest
at all, could be made amusing at any rate.

HINT TO THE HUMANE SOCIETY.
THE Humane Society dined together last week at the Freemasons
Tavern. the course of the evening a number of persons who had
been rescued from drowning by the Society marched in procession
through the room. Among the number was the illustrious SoYER, who,
as the world knows, was nearly “glacé en surprise”, the other day
while skating, and was preserved to culinary and political Reform by the
Society's means... We notice the appearance of M, SoYER, for the
purpose of recording the wish that he may have presided, on this occa-
sion, over the preparation of the dinner of a Society that so well de-
served a good one. After saying thus much, we may be excused for
recommending that the Humane Society should extend the sphere of
its operation. Why should its benevolence take an exclusively aquatic
turn? In the metropolis, at least, more persons die by gas than by
water. Let the Society lend its aid in diminishing the mortality occa-
sioned by the sulphuretted, hydrogen which is exhaled by our filthy
drains. Or, still keeping to its favourite element, suppose it en-
deavoured to obtain a pure water supply for London. Were the
attempt successful, it would save many additional lives; for such
... as Londoners mostly drink poisons greater numbers than it
owns.

JUDICIAL AUCTIONEERS.
TNDER the new Act for releasing Encumbered Estates in Ireland,
the Judges are empowered to sit in open court and dispose of land by
auction. It is nothing new to see property knocked down by due
course of law, but the process of getting rid of it beneficially to all
parties by legal process, is something no i. original than agreeable.
We hope the puffing system will not be adopted, nor indeed do we
fear that it ºil. for their Lordships are clearly actuated by a deter-
mination to “keep the thing respectable.” We should be sorry to
see the court covered with placards announcing “Little, Paradises,”
“Unencumbered Elysiums,” “Eligible realms of Freehold Bliss,” or
with any of the other clap-trap modes of attracting attention to a sale
by auction. We could pardon some such announcement as the
following:—
MR. BARON RICHARDS,
admitted by detraction herself to be
“NOT A BAD JUDGE,”
will, with the valuable assistance of DR. LoNGFIELD, in their conjoint
capacity of Government Commissioners for the
SALE OF IRISH ENCUMBERED ESTATES,
have the pleasure—if pleasure it may be termed without a soleeism-
of submitting to Public Competition a splendidly unique and incom-
parable series of
LOTS OF LANDED PROPERTY,
the whole of it being divested of Encumbrances in Mortgage, Rent-
Charge, &c., amounting to the astounding sum of
EIGHT MILLION POUNDS,
which would undeniably go some way towards
PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT.
A more tempting opportunity of investing capital in that truly
laudable, and, even in an Englishman, patriotic object, the cultivation
of Irish soil, so earnestly advocated by the florid and convincing
eloquence of
SIR ROBERT PEEL,
never perhaps presented itself even to the fertile imagination of
CAPABILITY BROWN.
“Now or Never,” therefore, should be the motto for any enterprising
Capitalist desirous of promoting
THE REGENERATION OF IRELAND.
The Conveyance of these Estates has been so simplified as to preclude
the slightest apprehension on the part of the Purchaser of being in-
troduced to too familiar acquaintance with
GENTLEMEN OF THE LONG ROBE ;
and he may rest assured that he will require
A VERY SMALL BOX FOR HIs TITLE DEEDs,
which will confer upon him what the celebrated DR. Johnson would
ave styled the potentiality of rendering the famine-stricken population
of Ireland really and truly some of the
FINEST PEASANTRY IN THE UNIVERSE,
thus effectively carrying out the creditable intention of the
GOVERNMENT OF LORD JOHN RUSSELL.
*...* Although the Sales will take place in a Court of Justice, MR.
BARON, RICHARDs will endeavour to banish all gloomy associations by
emulating the usual facetiae of the Auction Room ; an attempt in which
he is allowed to have felicitously acquitted himself on his very first
occasion of wielding the Hammer.
THE NEEDLES OF LONDON.
To hunt for a needle in a bottle of hay is a venerable proverb of hope-
lessness—to discover a needlewoman in London seems a matter of no
less despair, THOMAS CARLYLE has, from his paper pulpit, ſulmined
the fact that “no needlewoman, distressed or otherwise, can be pro-
cured in London by any housewife to give for fair wages fair help in
sewing.” This is very true. The sempstress is a thing of mystery.
She dwells in the attics and back rooms of courts and alleys; but how
to discover her ?...Why, SIR Ropert PEEL has anticipated the
remedial reply—“Register, register.” Perhaps, MEssRs SHADRACH
AND ABEDNEGO, or any other benevolent Samaritans of the thimble,
would allow a book upon their premises, wherein the needlewomen
might write their names and addresses in honest ink. At present such
writing, in the books of such tradesmen, is done in tears.

AN APPEAL FROM THE FIRST OF APRIL.
To SIR. R. INGLIS, BART.
“PERMIT me, the First of April—allowed by the wisdom of

the people of England for that of Prussia or France? On the 10th of April, 1848, had

THE MARRIED BACHELOR,
THERE is no limit to the recklessness of the penny-a-liners in
providing pabulum for a paragraph. If the spider had a shilling an
inch allowed him for his web, he could not set to work with more
alacrity than is shown by the penny-a-liner in spinning the yarn, of
fiction into the form of fact, and, indeed, like a green spectacled
monster, “making the food he lives upon.” Numerous have been the
premature deaths of celebrated men at the hands of the reporters for
ihe newspaper press, who, having earned a shilling by the announcement
of a distinguished character's decease, have pocketed an additional
sixpence by briefly bringing him to life again. To kill an individual for
a day or two is, however, a venial offence, inasmuch as he can always
prove his own existence by entering an appearance, at any time, but it
is far different with the case of the gallant MAJOR EDwaipes, who ha
no sooner come home from India, and put his foot on the Waterlºo
Station of the South Western Railway, than some penny-a-liner, in
human form, must needs marry him, and bestow upon him two ready-
made little ones. - . .
The Major lost no time in getting himself paragraphically divorced,
and repudiating the pair of infant pledges in which he had no interest.
He very naturally objected to the adoption of the system of “families
supplied” on the very gratuitous terms upon which he had been just
supplied with a family. His alleged wife turned out to be a black
Ayah; and we are of opinion that, on the very face of it, the allegation
of his marriage ought not to have been put forth, for if it had been so,
the fact—as well as the lady—would have worn a very different Com-
plexion. Such a plea as there having been a nigger female with him,
cannot hold; and we must insist that, to use the professional term,
there was not even enough to give colour.

DEATH OUT OF TOWN.
THE Report on intramural interment is a most discouraging document. . It treats death as
a nuisance, and ought, therefore, to arouse the opposition of those worthy men—the genus
LAURIE and Hicks—who look upon a London tombstone as bearing, only with a difference,
an extract from the Great Charter. With the recommendation embodied in the Report
once carried into effect, and all London church bells are henceforth dumb-dumb in so far as
funereal solemnities appeal to them...The giddy, calculating wayfarers of London streets are,
commercial feelings deepened into meditation by the frequent appearance of walking funerals,
shouldering and edging their way through a crowd of º: life. This, no, doubt, is only
another attack upon another yested right, and—but we leave the measure in the hands of SIR
PETER LAURIE, who will, we fear it not, behave with becoming indignation upon so important
a matter.
The Report recommends that a vast cemetery for the million be established. Erith is
said to be the spot pointed at. To this spot there will be easy access by railway; and
further, by steam-boat, that, at several appointed stations, shall, on certain days, take up its
freight of mortality. H - - -
bait, will suffer the death-boat to poison the Thames and their sense of animal enjoyments is
yet to be known. The measure has not yet been approved of by the Court of Aldermen, and
that Court boasts at least a LAURIE
The Report further recommends that the cemetery be planted with trees. For—
“It appears that decomposition invariably goes on more rapidly near the roots of trees than in any other parts
of the burial-ground; that the earth is always much drier near the roots of trees than elsewhere; that the fibres of
of the coffin-lid.”
The products of decomposition are “recombined,” says the Report, “into living and healthful
vegetable structures,” and thus what were the mortal elements of men and women, may become
yew and cypress, and weeping willow. . In lieu of poisoning a city atmosphere, the human earth
is transferred into a thing of healthful beauty. Very old, indeed, is the thought—but no less
welcome in the admirable Report before us. How solemn—how profoundly significant is the
old legend of ADAM and the Tree of Paradise
“ADAM, being, now ready to die, felt a fear of death, and desired earnestly a branch from
the Tree of Paradise. He therefore sent one of his sons thither to fetch one, in hope that
e might, escape this dreadful reward of sin; The son went, and made his petition to the
cherub who guarded the gate, and received from him a bough, but ADAM meanwhile had
departed. Therefore the son planted the bough upon ADAM’s grave. It struck root, and
grew into a great, tree, and attracted the whole nature of ADAM to its nutriment. This tree
-say the Talmudists—together with the bones of ADAM from beneath it, was preserved in
the ark. After the waters had abated, NoAH divided these relics among his sons. The skull
was SHEM's share. He buried it in a mountain of Judaea, planting the tree with it, and the
place was called from thence Calvary and Golgotha, or the place of a Skull. And of that

pends the matter well”—writes our old author
—“shall find that whole ADAM as it were is re-
collected in and under the cross, and so with
an admirable tie, conjoined to the vivifical nature :

Beautiful and sustaining is the thought of i
this solemn legend! It descends with an espe-
cial comfort from churchyard yew and cypress.
A HOUSE DIVIDED.
THERE were on Monday night no less than
eight divisions of the House of Commons, by
Protec"ionists º ing up one after the other
to move “that the Čim. report progress, and
ask leave to sit again.” We do not exactly see
what progress there could be to report, when
obstruction was so much the order of the day
that everything in the shape of business was
stopped by the repetition ad nauseam of the
motion we have specified. If we had been the
Chairman, we certainly would not “ask leave to
sit again;” ſor, after eight divisions upon one
proposition, we think we should have had quite
enough of it. -
We will not question the great devotion of the
Protectionists, as well as of all other parties, to
the interests of their country; but we think it
is a very unfortunate mode of showing their
zeal, that they should impede the public business
for an entire evening, by jºi. and
over again a motion which rendered impossible
anything else in the shape of motion, and
brought the House to a dead stand-still. Per-
haps, however, the Protectionists act on the
motto, “Divide et Impera,” and imagine that, the
oftener they divide, the better their chance of
governing.

authority could make it plainer. It has been done from time immemorial, and not
merely in reference to the actor and his performance, but in respect to his private
conduct, as an actor, off or on the stage.”
Acting not being a useful art, what is to be said of play-writing? Is
Hamlet little better than the kaleidoscope?... Is Lear not useful—only
sºirs? And then MR. WAN BUREN, with a triumphant peroration,
as -
“How are you to get down the throat of a man and know the reason of his
applauding?”
Wery true: impossible. Now it is easy to get into the pocket of a
counsel—the actor in horse-hair—and know the reason of his sophisti-
cating. The licence of the bar, however—as impudence and brutality
are too often mis-called—takes especial liberties with the actor. Give
a counsel a playhouse case to deal, with, and-nine times out of ten-
he considers himself justified in his worst. The great man, with the
loftiest contempt and the sharpest wit to match, despises and lacerates
the poor player. Even our own SERJEANT WILKINs, whose delicacy
become a proverb—so that at the bar Mess nothing is more
common than to hear, “as meek as WILKINs;” “as gracious as
WILKINs;” “as golden-mouthed as WILKINs”—even that mild,
magnanimous man, cannot forego the temptation of sport with
the actor. A few days ago, a young lady brings an action against
MANAGER MADox. The actress is a person of unimpeached cha-
racter; an excellent woman. Nevertheless, even WILKINs must
have his joke; for he expresses his sympathy with managers who
have to deal with actresses “who come to rehearsals after dinner.”
The hilarious, vinous attempt at wit, is here patent; and the joke
is all the more gay and daring, from the fact that the milky WIL-
KINs knows that rehearsals never take place after dinner. The
Serjeant himself was once a promising actor; and at Stoke Pogis
always secured the bespeak of MIss GRIMBY’s boarding-school when
he acted. Rosencrantz. Therefore, the wit of the Serjeant's allusion to
feminine intemperance is the more to be relished. It is the known
falsehood of the thing that makes it so very piquant, and so very

IGNORANCE FOR THE MILLION |
Respectfully Dedicated to SIR. R. H. INGLIS and MR. PLUMPTRE.
LIGHT for the many needful lore,
In vain the good and wise implore
And wherefore is there none
INGLIs his portly bulk expands,
And interposed dense PLUMPTRE stands,
With all Cant’s congregated bands,
Between them and the Sun.
“No school without religion!” whoop
The zealot band, the bigot troop,
(Mild names the crew to call),'
Knowing that England can't agree
What that religion is to be,
And therefore, in reality,
They cry, “No school at all!”
Unless with orthodoxy taught,
The Alphabet's a thing of naught,
The Grammar is a smare;
Arithmetic a net of sin, .
Geography, a Demon's gin, .
To catch the souls of children in,
As these good folks declare.
*Religion 1 Not a school without!”
You teach it cleverly, no doubt,
By your parochial plan; .
The Lesson drawled with dronish note,
The Catechism rehearsed by rote,
The gabbled Collect, much promote
piety in man.
*Twere mighty well could you impart
What is the learning of the heart
Task-like, as A. B. C.; .
Could formal pedagogues inspire
What childhood hardly can acquire
But from the teaching of a sire,
Or at a mother's knee.
Say, INGLIs; is it for your creed
You won’t let children learn to read;
Or hold you but a brief
For Oxford, whom you represent,
Oxford, on domination bent, ..
Though torn to pieces with dissent
As to her own belief ?
Well; stand in Education’s way,
And still obstruct the public day,
INGLIs and PLUMPTRE too;
Whilst every wretch in darkness bred
To freight the hulks, the drop to tread,
Because through Ignorance misled,
Shall render thanks to you.

conscLENCE AvAUNT
THE public treasury is under very great obligations just now to
Conscience, in whose name the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchequER is
continually receiving sums of large amount, and the first halves of
| Bank-notes, whose better halves follow in a day or two afterwards, to
form the necessary union. We are not quite sure that these large
receipts of conscience money may be regarded as proof of increased
morality on the part of the public, for we may be tolerably certain
that the sums sent in to the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER do
not form the hundredth part of one per cent upon the gross amount
of roguery committed. The fact of conscience money coming in rather
briskly shows that dishonesty is carried to such an extent, that
even conscience, who is so easily put to sleep, can no longer remain
completely dormant. We cannot say much either for the respectability
of a principle which regards the payment of money in the name of
conscience as a sufficient expiation of an offence, and indeed the
process is no other than the old one of plating sin with gold—a
species of electrotyping which, in our estimation, leaves the gilt as
glaring as ever. -
Nevertheless, all is grist that comes to the CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
chEQUER's mill, and if conscience continues its contributions at their
present rate, we may begin to look upon conscience money as a
-recognised source of revenue. We will anticipate a few cases under
the head of -
- * TENDER-CONSCIENCE MONEY.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER has received from “X.” lid,
'computed to be the value of a rose picked ten years ago in Kensington
Gardens.” He has handed the money over to the Commissioners of
Woods and Forests.
The ChançELLOR OF THE ExchequER has also to acknowledge the
receipt from “Z.” of £500, being “the amount, with interest, of penal-
ties, incurred at various times by carrying notes from one friend to
another, instead of sending them #y post.”
, The sum of £50 has been sent to the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
by “J. B.” “for having defrauded the Excise, by making a private still
§ of a tea-kettle, and therewith distilling an ounce of spirit from apot
Of ale.
“A Reformed Convict” has forwarded 3d. to the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExCHEQUER, “for reparation of damage done to Government pro-
perty, while in gaol, by cutting out the name of ‘SNooks’ on the wall.”
THE COOKERY OF ALL NATIONS.
In the classified list of objects to be admitted to the “Exhibition of
Industry of all Nations.” under the head of Section 1, “Raw Materials
and Produce,” it is stated that— - -
“Under raw materials in this section, are to be included all products of the Mineral,
Vegetable, and Animal Kingdoms, either in an entirely raw state, or in any stage of
preparation, previous to arriving at the state of a finished manufacture.”
This arrangement evidently opens the door of the Exhibition to the
butcher, the fº. and the cook, whose respective commodities
are all derived from the vegetable and animaſkingdoms. ... We think the
permission to exhibit objects belonging to the latter kingdom “in an
entirely raw state” had better be revoked, for although the exterior of
MR. GIBLETT's shop may be considered a picture by the vulgar, yet, to
please the eye of refinement, meat should be dressed—the leg of mutton
should appear with its º not as sheep's flesh unadorned.
There can be no objection to the display of culinary pº though
this, in some cases, will rather inyolve making a hash of it. Let France,
then, send her countless dishes, Italy her cream, Spain her olla-podrida,
Russia her caviare, Turkey her kiebobs, India her, curry, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales their stew, haggis, and rabbit, whilst English roast
beef shall compete with the cookery of the world. Let Germany also
send her sausages, and as regards sausages, it might be well to relax the
restriction above recommended. The exposition of the raw materials
of the sausage, whether German or British, would not only gratify a
wholesome curiosity, but also (we hope) allay very unpleasant misgivings
The Victoria Blue.
IN “Labour and the Poor,” in the Chronicle, we have the curious
history, the odd statistics, of the doll-trade. A doll-maker says:—
“The eyes that we make for Spanish America are all black. A blue-eyed doll in that
country wouldn't sell at all. Here, however, nothing goes down but blue eyes. The reason
for this is, because that's the colour of the Queen's eyes, and she sets the fashion in this
as in other things.'
What a blessing it is that our good little QUEEN does not squintº

SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF AN UNPROTECTED FEMALE.
THE UNPROTECTED FEMALE, WHILE VISITING THE SMITHERSES IN THE COUNTRY, HAS HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO HAVE SEEN A ROBBERY
COMMITTED AT A RAILWAY STATION, AND FINDS HERSELF SUBPOENAED AND IN ATTENDANCE As A WITNESS AT THE ASSIZE TOWN.

jammed painfully into a corner, with a confused impression that the
Plaintiffs are Prisoners.

NOTHING LIKE LEATHER.
Y the latest advices from California, we learn that
the articles in which it is most judicious to speculate,
are jack-boots, , and that a horseguard, therefore,
emigrating in his regimental chaussure, with his boots
on his legs, would have a little fortune on his hands
if he felt himself disposed to get the articles dis-
posed of. -
It seems that the slushy and §. state of the
diggings, necessitates the use of the most substan-
tial protection to the feet and legs; nor can we be
surprised that there is much mud and dirt to be
gone through in the search after filthy lucre.
In more civilised nations it is indispensable that
the mere money-hunter should have a strong, coarse
just as in California it is the thickness of the boot that
understanding
aids one in th: pursuit of booty.
It is evident that a parcel of pumps would be of no use whatever at
the diggings; and that as in boots, so in men—the jack of the one and
the knave of the other, will be most suited to California.
Bribery.
THE Post has a manful exposure of the meanness of certain print
publishers, who vainly hope to attack the members—at least, the
—of the press with food and drink.
“A publisher lprintseller] once sent to our office a card of invitation, upon which
was written, in fair round text, “Luncheon as usual.’”
The printseller, in his profound ignorance, no doubt believed that
plates would fail to have their proper influence, unless further recom-
mended by knives and forks.
Politieal Choregraphy.
THE ballot produced the other night at the Theatre Royal, St.
Stephens,’ was, we regret to say, unsuccessful. One point in the per-
formance excited, universal disapprobation. . This was a pirouette
executed by SIR. G. GREY, simply by turning right round in the most
graceless manner possible.

THE WEAKNESS OF THE WHIP, AND A SATIRICAL YOUNG
ROGUE.
THERE are those who believe that the most judicious treatment of the human
“Donkey wot won't go” in the right direction is, really, to “wallop” him...How
little it is feasible to reform criminals by the lash—how impracticable to “whip
the offending APAM out of them,” might be proved by numerous Chronicles of the
Cat, and Statistics of the Scourge, making a large pile of Black-and-Blue Books.
In the meanwhile, here is one case in § commended to the consideration of the
sect of penal “Flagellants.” At the Middlesex Sessions, one day last week, as the
Times relates,
“Thomas Jones, a little lad of the age of 15, was convicted of having stolen 22 books of the value
of 21.4s., the property of a gentleman named THoMAs Jones.
“The learned Judge said he would read the history of the prisoner for the last year, and from one
prison only. On the 17th of February, 1849, the boy was "summarily’ convicted in the name of
ANDREw MITCHELL, and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment; on the 20th of March, three
days after he had been liberated only, he was again ‘summarily’ convicted in the name of John
WILLIAMS, when he was sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment; on the 1st of June he was a third time
‘summarily" convicted, and sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment, and to be well whipped—on this
occasion he had resumed his own name; on the 2nd of August he was a fourth time 'summarily’
convicted and sentenced to one month, and to be well whipped; and, on the 13th of November, he
was a fifth time ‘summarily’ convicted, when he had been sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment, and
another whipping.”
The ursine attempt to lick a cub into sha

than skin-deep. With small result has, this youth been
“leathered” except “with a vengeance,” according to the
prescription of MR. CARLYLE, who contends that in prison-
discipline.there is nothing like “leather” applied to the
back vindictively. The whippings of young Jones will have
given little satisfaction to anybody but the writer of “Model

This retributory flogging, moreover, is by no means a
settlement with the culprit. If Society has scourged Jones,
Jones is still a scourge to Society. He has his “revenge”
as well. He, as a social pest, avenges broken natural laws—
moral, physical, physiological ordinances—the infringement
of which produces your Jon ESEs. Some such “Young
Troublesomes,” perhaps, can be reclaimed by no means,
fair or foul; but an early trial of the former might, in
many instances, possibly prevent recourse to the latter.
It is curious that the last offence of MASTER Jones con-
sisted in stealing books. For this he has been sentenced to
six months' imprisonment and hard labour. The state of
educational destitution among the Jon Es-class considered,
there was such clever satire in the theft, that for this once
he almost deserved to be let off.

A. CRY FROM ST. PAUL’S.
WE have º pleasure in giving utterance to a Cry from
St. Paul's Churchyard. The criers desire to express their
concurrence in an agitation now going on in their neigh-
bourhood for the removal of the railing in front of the
jºi"injº i.iii.; it ºf
the church, is an injury to the fame of W. an impedi-
ment to circulation, often occasioning accidents, and such
a perfect eyesore as frequently to give foreigners ophthal-
mia. They perfectly agree with the Observer, alluding to
the locality of St. Paul's, that—
* At present there can be no question that this part of London is a
disgrace to the Metropolis.”
There is, however, they contend, a certain metropolitan
body, to which this part of London is particularly dis-
graceful; and shameful as they consider it that the exterior
of St. Paul's should be shut out, they think it much more
scandalous that the interior should be excluded from the
public view. They demand the removal of the twopenny
obstruction, by which the DEAN and CHAPTER hinder the
poor people from entering the church. They remark that
twopence is a large sum in proportion to many a working
man's wages, and equivalent to a loaf of considerable size,
which the workman and his family cannot spare for the
DEAN and CHAPTER. They own that in making these
observations they are ringing changes on one theme, but
declare that they feel themselves justified in so doing as
long as MEsses. DEAN and Co.'s money-changers continue
to ring theirs in the temple. ---
Finally, they propose that the St. Paul's railings and
church-mail should be abolished together, and that the old
irons should be appropriated for sale by the reverend
showmen as an indemnification for the resigned coppers.
This Cry from St. Paul's Churchyard emanates from the
stones that pave it, which represent themselves as having
been compelled to cry out by the protracted enormity
of the twopenny cathedral imposition.
THE OXFORD STEEPLE-CHASE.
THE Oxford Correspondent of the Morning Post, states
that measures have been taken by the Vice-Chancellor and
heads of houses, to prevent “the practice of riding in
races commonly known as steeple-chases,” which has of
late “prevailed to a great extent among some of the junior
members of the University.” Steeple-chasing, we believe,
is not uncommon among senior members of the University,
who clear scruples and go over difficulties in fine style,
when there is a shovel hat or a mitre at the goal.
A FLAT CONTRADICTION TO AN OLD PROWERB.
THERE is a musty old proverb which says, “Every road
leads to Rome.” This is not the case with the Pope at
all events, for with him every road leads to every other
place but Rome.

PU N C H2S PO L I C E.
A WERY MELANCHOLY CASE.
YESTERDAY. a gentleman of the name of THOMAS CARLYLE was
brought before Mr. Punch, charged with being unable to take care of
his own literary reputation—a very first-rate reputation until a few
months past—but now, in consequence of the reckless and alarming
conduct of the accused, in a most dangerous condition; indeed, in the
opinion of very competent authorities, fast sinking. :
The office was crowded by many distinguished persons, all of them
manifesting the most tender anxiety towards the accused; who, how-
ever, did not seem to feel the seriousness of his situation; but, on the
contrary, with folded arms and determined expression of visage, called
the worthy magistrate (Mr. Punch) a “windbag,” a “serf of flunkey-
dom,” and “an ape of the Dead Sea.”.
John Nokes, a policeman with a literary turn, proved that he had
*::: known the doings of the accused. Witness first became acquainted
with him through his “Life ºf Schiller,” a work done in the very best
and decentest manner, in which no offence whatever was committed
against the people's †† for he, JoHN NoKEs, had no idea that
English should be called either “king’s ”or “queen's,” but emphati-
cally “the people's English.” Had since known the accused through
“Sa Resarius,” “The French Revolution,” “Past and Present,” and
“Oliver Cromwell.” From time to time, as he went on, witness had
marked with considerable, anxiety, an increasing, wildness, a daring
eccentricity of manner in the doings of the accused, frequently observº
ing that he delighted to crack and dislocate the joints of language, and
to melt down and alloy sterling English into nothing better than
German silver. Nevertheless, witness did not believe the reputation
of the accused in any positive, danger, until some three or four
months back, when he detected him running wildly up and down
the pages of “Frazer's Magazine,” pelting, all sorts of gibberish
at the heads of Jamaica niggars—fantastically reproac them for
being."up to the ears, content in pumpkins, when y should
work for sugar and spices” for their white masters—threatening
them with the whip, and, in a word, dealing in lan only dear
to the heart—witness meant pockets—of Yankee, slave-owners and
Brazilian planters. Since then, witness had named his suspicions to
i. : respectable publishers, warning them to have an eye upon.
& Offender.
PETER WILLIAMs, teacher at the Lamb-and-Flag Ragged School,
deposed that he had purchased two numbers of a work by the accused,
led .*.*. amphlets.” The first number appeared to him
(witness) to develope rabid symptoms, -but in the second, in Model
Fisons-there was nothing in it, but barking and froth. (Here several
passages were read that fully bore out the opinion of the witness; pas-
sages which, created a melancholy sensation in court, many persons
ighing *: and in more than one instance dropping “some natural
tears.”)-Witness did not believe it consistent with public safety that,
in his present temper, the accused should be trusted with pen-and-ink.
If permitted the use of such, dangerous weapons he would—until
recovered from his present indisposition—inevitably inflict, upon his
reputation a mischief from which it could not recover. As it was,
Witness consideredit far from safe.
Mr. Punch asked the accused, if he had anything to say; whereupon
accused, with a withering smile, replied—
...Freematural, Eternal Qceans” –“Inhuman Humanitarians”-
Eiderdown Philanthropy”—“Wide-reverberating Cant”—“Work
Sans *:::: Three Cheers more, and Eternal, Inimitable, and
Antipodean º
and Pen-and-Inkidom!”
Mr. Punch observed, this was a melancholy case. He could nºt
- release the accused, unless . good and cient surety. Where-
upon two gentlemen-publishers of the first respectability—declared
themselves, willing to be bound, that accused should not, until in a
more healthful frame of mind, be allowed the use of paper and
goosequills.
. It is believed that if accused again offend, the whole body of pub-
lishers will insist upon his compulsory silence. Let us, however, flope
better things. |

WE understand that a Quarantine is to be established with reference
to all Steam Boats Junning, between London Bridge, and Battersea, in

THE BACHELOR-HUSBAND.
Y Bachelor-Husband, we
mean a husband who
is made a bachelor pro
tem, # the absence of
his wife.
...Of course such a
kind of life has its little
enviable privileges and
advantages; but then
| it has its drawbacks
and annoyances, for
which no freedom can
compensate. It is free-
om made slavery.
Husbands are always

of getting away from

they do, what miserable

for a fortnight. The
is left alone—not altogether out of love with the
“dear Hubby”
thought of being restored to liberty.
And yet, the very first day, what a helpless creature he is 1 He is
left the uncontrolled master of the house, and doesn’t know where a
single thing is . If he wants anything, he has, to get up and
f, and even th
search for it himse en there is but a small chance of his
finding it. For he doesn’t know one key from another, and he tries
them all; but, as a matter of course, the very key that is wanted is
missing.
The first day he meets some friends. He tells them with a trium-
phant chuckle, that he is a bachelor, and they must come home and
dine with him.
What a dinner!. Probably it has not been, ordered. How very
foolish' . He quite forgot that he has to go to the butcher's, and the
rºl. and greengrocer's, every day himself now: or, if the dinner
as been ordered, it is sure §. some vulgar dish which he is
ashamed to see put upon the table, or else it turns out to be the very
joint which he never touches. For the cook does not know all his whims
and fancies, his choice aversions and preferences, as his wife does.
Then again, the beer was “out” yesterday, and a fresh barrel has not
been ordered in. There is a pause of ten minutes, therefore, to enable
the cook to run out to the A and Eve for a pint of the best ale.
When the best is brought, no one can drink it. -
... He is profuse in his apologies to his dear friends, who assure him that
it does not in the least matter, but, as they leave, it is evident, from
*-"Pumpkindom, Flunkeydom, Foolscapdom, their blank faces, that they have turned down a page in the volume of
their experience, as a private memorandum, never to trust to the tender
hospitality of a Bachelor-Husband again. - -

to go down into the kitchen, where he sits, listening to the tick-tick-tick
of the kitchen clock, and amusing himself now and then with a grand
battue of black-beetles, till past one o'clock in the morning, when the
mildest ring at the bell proclaims Nurse's return. .
His troubles begin the first thing the next morning. He cannot get
the servants out of bed. Then he has to ring separately for every
article he wants. The servants' behaviour altogether is changed to what
it is when Missis is at home. They seem to be aware of his helplessness,
and do as little as they can to relieve it,
When he goes down stairs, the room is scarcely dusted, or the dusters
are lying, about, and he nearly sits down upon, the box of black-lead

to that extent that at last he is driven away from his home, and regularly dines out.

“PLEASE, siR, what will You HAVE For DINNER To-DAY.”
Moreover, it is cheerless dining all alone-sitting opposite to his wife's empty chair—not a
person to take wine or exchange a word with. The silence grows oppressive, and any cheap
saw-dust dining place, where there are nothing but chops and steaks,—excepting steaks an
chops, soon becomes preferable. -
of that, the Bachelor Husband dines much.at, cheap dining places. . He runs through
the circle of his friends and relations, beginning with his friends first, for he knows they give the
best dinners, and reserving the relations for the last. He requires no invitation—for the fact
of his being a Bachelor, throws open every dining-room door to him. He begins to stop out
late-associates with young men—gets into a habit of late suppers, and smokes incessantly—for
a cigar is one of those recognised privileges which the Bachelor-Husband takes behind his wife's
back, which he would never dare to do to her face.
But smoking, even in his own parlour, is not enough to make the place happy. The place looks
empty, dreary, and no wonder he comes home late, for it has lost all attraction, all comfort, in
eyes. It is a house for him, but no home. He is yery little, better than a lodger—he has
merely taken a sitting-room and bed-room for a fortnight in his wife's mansion during her absence.
He leaves the first thing in the morning, and goes home the last thing at night to sleep.
Everything loses the bright appearance it had when his wife was on the spot to look after the
house. The drawing-room stares at him like a dingy Lowther Bazaar smothered indust...Dust
seems to †: itself over every little thing, and the servants themselves appear as if they
would be all the better for a good dusting.
The Bachelor-Husband is an outcast in his own house. He has but little control over any
one-and pays the bills that are put before him without a question, being too glad to get rid
of the nuisance as quick as possible. The washing, too, wears his life out." All his linen
comes home wrong. His waistcoats and neck-handkerchiefs are washed so biliously he has not
the face to wear them. The strings are off his collars; and, as for Bachelor's Buttons, he has
not a shirt with one on. He does not know whom, to ask to help him. He complains, but his
complaints are not heeded, and if he has a cold, he is obliged to nurse himself, receiving pity,
consolation, and water-gruel, from no hands but his own.
He puts his name down to be entered at some West-End Club (a Club for Bachelor-Husbands,
by-the-bye, would not be a bad move, open at all hours to all Bachelor-Husbands), so that, by
the time his wife leaves him a Bachelor the second time, he may have some table of refuge where
he can eat a good dinner in comfort, and invite friends to come and eat it with him.
Wives should beware of this, and should never stop away too long, but should rather return
ere the .." has elapsed, before they receive a letter imploring them to come home as
soon as possible-for when they receive that affectionate summons, they may be sure that, the
very climax of wretchedness, has been attained by that º: itiable, persecuted, helpless,
domestic hearth-broken individual, whom we call the Bachelor-Husband. Common prudence,
not to say compassion, should whisper to them it is not fair, or worthy of the fair sex, to pro-
long any husband's sufferings to that extent
—unless perchance they leave him in the
hands of a warranted mother-in-law.
NON-POLITICAL AND UN-FASHION-R
ABLE RE-UNIONS.
THE Master of one of the Metropolitan
Unions had his customary Re-Union in the
Workhouse on. Saturday last. Gruel was
served in the º apartment, and breads
were laid for one hundred and fifty guests.
The accomplished Lady of the Master received
the visitors at the grand copper as they en-
tered, and we observed among them several
who had recently had the Order of the Cold
Bath conferred ". them. Severalal fresco
fish feasts have been lately given in various
parts of London, and on Saturday, the fashi-
onable evening, there is held at Brompton a
regular fête des poissons, or º fair, the
stalls at which are presided over by some of
the most distinguished females of the neigh-
bourhood. At most of these stalls the Whelk
is the “monster of the deep” most in re-
quest by the public, who may generally cal-
culate on a hearty Wheikome.
TIME OUT OF MIND.
WE really cannot tell what has come lately
to some of the principal Clocks of London.
Since St. Clement's set the bad example of
irregularity some four or five years ago, there
has been a sort of epidemic prevailing among
many of the principal time-pieces of the Me-
tropolis. A month or so back, it was the
Royal Exchange that showed symptoms of
ill-timed eccentricity, and now we regretto
hear of that highly-respected member of the
Horological Society, the Asylum Clock in the
Westminster Road, having turned off the
whole of its hands for the last fortnight.
The absence of the hands cannot be the result
of a strike, for no striking has been observed
by the inhabitants.
The works are, of course, completely stopſ,
and the supposition is, that the Clock had, in
a moment of forgetfulness, been wound up
to a pitch of intensity which his proved fatal
to its proper equilibrium. Whateverma
the cause, we can only deplore the effect,
for this Clock, which seemed always to have
the game in its hands, is at present without
any hands whatever.
A HINT TO PUBLISHERS.
THERE is in Literature, as in other matters,
a great deal in a name, and no sooner does
anything successful appear in any depart:
ment of speculation, than a series of nominal
resemblances to the fortunate achievement
are instantly advertised... We recommen
the following as a few titles for books, in-
tended to follow up the recent new work,
called, “TURKEY AND its DEstiny.”
“capon AND ITs capabilities.”
“veal AND ITs woes.”
“Mutton and Its cape Rs.”
“chicken AND ITs FAINT-HEARTEDNEss.”
“GIN AND ITs BITTERs.”
“cuRD AND ITs wheys.”
Brava! Jenny Lind!
JENNY LIND was offered some thirty thou-
sand pounds to sing at the Imperial Concerts
at the Court of Russia. JENNY's significant
negative to the offer was “Hungary.” Great
is the triumph of genius, when the night-
ingale is too much for the eagle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH THE SAILOR'S FRIEND.
Punch has always been animated by the kindest feelings towards
the British Seaman—from the son of NEPTUNE taking an airing in the
back-yard of a man of war, to the gallant tar dancing hornpipes,
fighting combats, and wiping his “dear eyes” on the stage of aminor
theatre. Punch, however, i. not been blind to the defects of the
nautical character, including its propensity to improvidence; its insane
delight in, riding on the roofs of cabs;, its tendency to bully and
bluster, when dissipating on shore; and indeed “Jack,” as every
drunken sailor chooses to call himself, has often appeared to be little
better than an unlicked sea-cub, to whom the process of licking would
be in more senses than one, a benefit. - -
Several attempts have been made to effect the social elevation of the
tar, who has frequently been sat upon by Parliamentary Committees,
from whom recommendations have issued over and over again; but it
unfortunately happens that no Government has yet had sufficient pluck,
energy, or good will, to act on the recommendations in question.
The Legislature has always within itself a quantity of obstructive
force, besides the natural visinertia, or power of doing nothing, that the
º: contains, and these generally prove sufficient to º: any good
work that is not urged on vigorously from without, and taken up in-
doors with a thorough determination to accomplish it. The present
Administration, acting through MR, LABouche RE, the President of the
Board of Trade, had prepared a measure designed to improve the con-
dition of the Merchant Seamen, when straightway the regular
obstructors of Parliament,...allying themselves with a self-interested
class, have gone to work with the intention of preventing, if possible,
the good designed by the Government for the mercantile navy. One
of the objects of the measure introduced by MR, LABouchERE is to
submit the masters and mates of merchant ships to examination, with
the view of ascertaining their fitness; a provision opposed by the ship-
owners, who contend that they ought to retain the right of appointing
either the fit or unfit to the command of their vessels,
If it could be said of a naval commander, as of a poet, nasciºur non fit,
there might be some ground for objecting to a legislative measure for
making sure of his fitness. Experience has shown that the power,
while in the hands of the shipowners, has been grossly misused, and
that the interest of the seaman has been grossly overlooked. His life
under the old system has been anything but that canvas-trowsered,
olish-pumped, and hornpipe-dancing career, which, in our infantine
s we always pictured as the lot of the British sailor. His voyages
have not been that delicious intermixture of grog and sentiment, that
series of playful allusions to lee-scuppers, marlin spikes and mizens
which we once attributed to him as the staple of his conversation, and
the sole º: of his anxiety. Domineering inefficient officers afloat,
neglect on s
the stage and in print—have been the seaman's fateformany years, and
º the evils which the Government measure is calculated to
remedy.
SPOHR’s “COMBINATIONS.”
SPRING-TIME is come-the sap is rising-JENKINs promises to be
almost himself again. Here is a sample from the Post of last week.
JENKINs prophesies upon the Opera prospects of 1851, and thus lays
violent parts of speech upon Spohr:—
“A thrilling sense of sweetness arises from his combinations which affects usin the
same manner as does a summer might's west wind heavy with the breaths of a thousand
ſtowers blended into one odour, under whose influence we almost faint with the excess of
ecstasy which vibrates through our whole being.”
JENKINs thrilled with a sense of sweetness of a summer night's west
wind blending a thousand flowers into one odour—as the perfumers
say, extrait de milleſleurs-and almost fainting with an excess of ecstasy,
vibrating through his whole being, JENKiss, we say, in this very
interesting situation, is by no means bad. At least, to begin with.
Proceed, JENKINs; vibrate and prosper!
A Half-Pint Measure of Law Reform.
The principle that “every little helps” is being adapted and acted
upon by the authorities in the Court of Changery. A few days ago a
proceeding was postponed before one of the ity Judges, in order
that “all the parties might be heard at once.” This is a magnificent
idea, and though it runs counter to the old Royal regulation of “one at
a time,” when a provincial Mayor began to speak simultaneously with
the braying of an adjacent donkey, we are convinced that there are
many little matters º wit
merrier,” as far as the talking of Counselis concerned, is the best rule
to act upon. Though money may not be saved b the arrangement,
there would be an economy of time in letting several learned gentlemen

THE ADVANTAGE OF LODGING UNDER A. MECHANICAL GENIUS,
DRAINING THE METROPOLIS."
THE Times states that the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers,
“old and new, have been in office nearly three years, and have spent at
least £100,000 pounds a year of the public money.” For this expendi-
ture our contemporary complains that there is nothing to show, and adds,
“Excepting incidenfally, we have had no proclamation or recognition
by the Commissioners of any great principle of drainage”. Nay; give
the gentlemen, their due. They have not only recognised a principle,
but also put in practice a system of * to a very great extent,
only they have made a slight mistake; they have drained the City's
resources instead of its sewers. It does not appear that any ‘sumps”
have been provided for the conservation of these valuable drainings:
No; the Commissioners contented themselves with finding an outfall
for them; and the drainings have simply gone to the deuce.
Anticipations of the Budget.
ALL classes of interests are of course desirous of º the benefit
of any reduction of duty that may be rendered possible by the surplus
revenue; and we have even heard it whispered that a motion.will be
made in the House of Commons, to take apart of the duty of policemen.
The application will be made on the alleged ground of its being for the
benefit of men of letters.

THINGs in the Tunnel continue to look, black, and at the meeting of
proprietors a few days ago, a comparison between the receipts and ex-
penditure presented ground for hope, inasmuch as there is always play
for the imagination, when nothing has been realised. . It appears that
the Directors do all they can to brighten the prospects of the concern,
for between £700 and £800 have gone in the year for gas, which makes
the Tunnel light though it makes the expenditure heavy. There has
been a falling off in the tolls for the past year, but this deficiency is of

unprofitable, it has, at all events, acted as a sort of general accountant

in Croyland long ago. A huge un-
trodden, haggard country, the “cha-
otic battlefield of Frost and Fire;”
a country of savage glaciers, te
mountains, of fouljungles, unhewed
forests, quaking bogs; which we
shall have our own ados to make
arable and habitable, I think!”
, THE SENSE.
“This is a novel, alarming, state
of things. There are no agents but
ourselves at work in it that I can
perceive, except irrational, unsound
preachers of chimeras (philanthropic
and other deceivers). of , great
note; abusive and satirical jour-
nalists, literary wolves that prey
on the public morals; probably
certain magazines of evil tendency,
blue, or perhaps blue and yellow
magazines [coloured like the]
devils [which] St. GUTHLAG found
in Croyland long ago. An indefinite
unexplored dreary state of things
the arena of diametrically oppose
principles; an age of frozen cha-
rities, stubborn prejudices, filthy
mazes of immorality, unreclaimed
populations, and social bases threat-
ening to give way; a state of things
which I think we shall have suf-
ficient work of our own to render
capable of improvement, and orderly
enough for us to exist under it.”
A Fact for the Agriculturists.
WE understand that one of the farmers' friends in the House of
mmons will shortly propose a return to Protection, in consequence
of the ruinous effect produced by FreeTrade upon our home agriculture,
which has ...' caused the introduction in the year 1849 of £4000
worth of French lawns into this country. It will be urged with the
usual soundness of logic and accuracy of fact, for which the Protec-
tionists are remarkable, that if foreign lawns are already ‘...; in so
fast, foreign fields may soon be expected to follow. It will doubtless be
asked how it is possible for the land to stand against such competition,
when, not simply the produce from abroad is imported, but when French
lawns, and why not French, pastures, on a still more extensive scale,
are admitted bodily into unhappy England.
“Down. IN FRONT.”
...We learn from the papers that there is a movement getting up in the
city, with the yiew of doing away with the iron railing round St. Paul’s
Cathedral. This may be all very well, but we give due notice to the
parties interested, that, though the iron railing may be abolished, until
the twopenny-show principle of charging for admission has been got
rid of, our irony and our railing will never be removed from St. Paul's.
PLOUGHING BY STEAM.
WE perceive that steam has been applied to the process of ploughing.
If the º are really, as they allege, in terrible hot water, we think
they cannot do better than turn the hot water to account, by using the
steam for farming purposes.
REASON FOR WEARING A BEARD.
THERE is a Member of the Peace Society who has not shaved now for
years, and the reason he gives for his heard, which is a very handsome
oing to touch a razor, lest by any accident he
one, is this: “He is not
should be lending his hand to the unnecessary effusion of blood.” -
One of the items of receipt is as usual the rent of stalls, for that
continual fancy fair which is perpetually going on underground, in
obedience to that wonderful law of our nature which teaches us some-
times. to delight in the most startling contrasts, and has led to the
establishment of a bazaar in the tunnel. We should be most happy to
but truth . us to say that we utterly despair of ever seeing the
concern succeed in keeping itself above water.
The Ruins of Nineveh.
It appears that a French antiquarian threatens to get the best of our
own LAYARD at Nineveh. He will—
“With his much larger fund (£30,000 it is stated), materially encroach on the harvest
of antiquities which would fall to the lot of the English nation were CAPTAINLAYARD's
exertions backed by more ample means.”
This is an idle, an #. complaint. When John BULL is made to
lose so much with “ducks and drakes,” how can he, with the French,
afford to play at “marbles?”
Quick Returns and no Profits.
MR. HUDsoN has re-appeared “in his place” (where we should have
thought he would have been somewhat “out of his place”) in the House
of Commons. We are not aware whether the ex-Railway-King is sup:
plied with a motto for his armorial bearings, whatever they may be, but
if not, we would suggest to him as appropriate to his re-appearance in
Parliament, the well known phrase of “Cut and come again.”

... WE wish that MR. CoBDEN, in his next annual motion for the reduc-

relative to the useless expenditure—of time—which we have so
frequently, incurred in telling Correspondents that they must take
copies of their communications before they consign them to Punch's

returns they please, but amongst such returns, no return of any article

SIBTHORP'S WANT OF CONFIDENCE.
THE gallant ColoneL SIBTHoRP ought to be the most bashful
member that the House of Commons contains, for he is totally devoid
of confidence. He takes every opportunity of declaring his total
distrust of everybody and everything parliamentary; a state of mind
which is perpetually prompting him to take up his hat and rush out of
the house, for the purpose, as he always declares, of getting out of an
atmosphere of humbug and roguery. We should not be surprised at
his putting on the paper a notice of motion in something like the
| following form:—“Colon ELSIBTHoRP to move for a call of the house,
for the purpose of taking into consideration his confidence in nothing
and nobody, and after having taken up his hat to ask for a committee
to sit upon it.”
The honourable and gallant member must suffer materially from this
feeling of distrust in all men of all parties, for it must be exceedingly
disagreeable to live in one continued state of doubt as to the whole
world's honesty. The Colonel wears out, we understand, at least half-
a-dozen velvet maps in the session, by his constant practice of bonnetting
himself, and rushing out of the house with a sweeping denunciation of
Whigs, Tories, Radicals, Conservatives, Peelites and Protectionists.
8IBTHORP has no confidence in
Either PARTY.
A MATCH FOR HAYNAU.
THE Times tells us that there were “21 persons hanged or shot by
court-martial, and 73 flogged,” according to one report, “irrespectively
of courts-martial.”. Where, and by whom?. In Hungary again?
Another exploit of HAYNAU’s P. No, indeed. In Cephalonia, by
British authority, as shown by “SIR HENRY WARD's own statement,”
did these military executions take place. The cats for the flogging were
44 º supplied for the purpose by SIR WILLIAM PARKER's flag-
ship.” ...The culprits were, it is said, banditti, but political tools. The
population of Cephalonia is stated by the Times as 70,000: the
number of capital executions in Hungary to have been 54. In this
hanging, shooting, and whipping match, there appears to be a “tie”
between HAYNAU and his British rival. In Cephalonia, 21 victims
must be considered as exceeding 54 in Hungary; but then, against his
opponent, HAYNAU scores women. HAYNAU is perhaps the more
thorough whip, but it is a question whether he has not been distanced
by our own countryman.
A Prize Ministry.
CoLoREL, SIBTHQRP complained the other, night, in the House of
Commons, that the Ministers were getting much too fat—a circumstance
that is quite compatible with their having no lean-ing towards the
gallant Member's doctrines. We can understand the Colonel's objection
to the fatness of the members of the Government, for it must give them
additional weight in the country, and it shows also that they are made
a great deal of, since their bulk is becoming remarkable. "We don't
object to their being double-bodied, so long as they are not double-faced
and if they increase so much in size, it will not be possible for political
intriguers to get round them very easily.
THE UNFILIAL HANGMAN.
Last week, CALCRAFT the hangman was summoned for refusing to
assist in the support of his mother. , CALCRAFT, pleaded poverty in
excuse of filial neglect. True, it was shown that his re Newgate
salary was one guinea per week—nothing being said of the proceeds
of his ºf harvest, in the country. CALCRAFT is, moreover, a
shoemaker; and was taken in the fact of wearing a shoemaker's apron.
Nevertheless, CALCRAFT declared he could not and would not pay a
tester in support of his parent.
We are sorry for this. We lament the hard-heartedness of the
hangman. Reflecting upon the great moral uses of the gallows—as
averred and championed by defendants of the halter—it does appear to
us assingularly unfortunate that CALCRAFT, the great teacher º
jºins away such low morality from that great public school, the
SCallolol.
The report further states, that
“A considerable degree of interest was excited, and the court was inconveniently
crowded by persons, amongst whom were a number of well-dressed women, anxious to
obtain a sight of the defendant,”
We are not without sympathy even for JACK KETCH; we are willing
to do him a good turn, without asking him for another.
Çan MR. CALCRAFT make nothing out of the “considerable degree
of interest” which is excited by his public appearance?... If he were to
give an “At Home,” for example, would not his exhibition-room be
inconveniently, but profitably crowded ? Try it, CALCRAFT, at 1s. a
head. What an easy way of getting #. You have only to show
yourself—though, if you could give a little lecture with illustrations, so
much the better, of course. How pleasant too ! With a number of
well-dressed women anxious to obtain a sight of you! What young buck
does not envy you, you happy dog?
By the way, a certain late patient of MR. CALCRAFT's was remarkable
for dressing well. Perhaps the well-dressed women, gloating on him
at Worship Street reminded him of her. Possibly it is not in externals
alone that the ladies who could revel in such contemplation resembled
MARIA MANNING.
ANIMATED LIKENESSES OF THE LATE LORD ELDON.
A MYSTERIOUS STORY.
It is well observed by the BARD of Avon that there are more things
in Heaven and Earth than, are dreamt of in our philosophy. Among
such our readers will probably be disposed to include the following
occurrences, presuming their authenticity, which it is difficult to doubt,
being vouched for by the independent testimony of various eminent
solicitors. We are informed by a great number of legal correspondents
in all parts of the kingdom, that the most curious and unaccountable
phenomena have, for some time past, been exhibited by the portraits
and busts of the late LORD ELDON, which, as is well known, are the
ornaments of most lawyers' offices. The E." of the sometime
Lord Chancellor of England have been observed suddenly to turn
themselves to the wall; or to tumble down from their hangings with-
out any assignable cause. His busts have all at once appeared to
change countenance, and assume an expression of weeping; a habit for
which the original, as is well known, was remarkable in his life-time.
Šaperstiious minds have not failed to connect these singular circum-
stances with the production of the Solicitor-General's measures for the
reform of the Irish Court of Chancery. -
Certain, however, it is, that the great Equity Lawyer was a strenuous
defender of what are now considered the abuses of the Court which
he presided over, and if the success of SIR. J. Rom IILY's Irish measure
should lead, as is expected, to a corresponding Chancery reform in
England, no doubt, the mysterious events in question will at least be
regarded in the light of “curious coincidences.”—Provincial Paper.
Every Man (even a German Prince) has his Price.
THE PRINCE of PRussia is fired at in his travelling carriage, and
his postillion is shot through the leg. The Prince, to record his gra:
titude for his narrow escape, awards the postillion a monthly pension of
five thalers. We must say we do not consider fifteen shillings a month
as the most princely payment in the world for saving a royal life, but
probably the Prince is a modest man, and, in fixing the sum, he was
anxious not to give more than he considered himself fairly worth. If
the Prince of Prussia is ever reduced to sell his life, we are afraid he
will not make much by the transaction, according to...the very low
estimate he has put upon himself. Why, it isn't five shillings a-week!

THE GUARDSMAN’S UNBIASSED OPINION UPON
MR, COBDEN.
(Delivered at the Mess after Dinner.)
* shouTD like to have the
handling of him. Wouldn't
I give it him I wouldn’t
are him, I can tell you!
should like to have him
for my flunky for a week,
that’s all—he shouldn’t
forget it soon. I would
wear ten pair of boots
every day, that he might
have the bother of clean-
ing them. What can he
know about the army?
Why doesn't he come
amongst us? I only wish
he would. Wouldn’t we
give it him, my boys! We
would show him a new
hight or two, and send him
home in a wheelbarrow.
I can’t help laughing, but
I think 1 know of a *
that would sicken him.
We would put him next to
the Major, and if his old
. jokes didn’t punish him
in less than half an hour, he is lost to all sense of feeling. . Nothing
is too bad for that fellow. By Jingo! I wouldn’t give a tin
sixpence for the best commission in the service if he was at the
head of affairs to-morrow. I’d sooner buy into the Police Force, and
turn officer in the Blues, than wear moustaches under such a man.
It’s my firm opinion he wants to make us rise from the ranks, and do
away with commissions altogether, a pretty state of things there would
be them. I think I shall sell out at once, for I’ve no idea of seeing a
Cotton Lord at the head of the regiment, and of taking wine with a
Colonel after he had been choking me with Devil’s-dust. If I had my
way, I would pack MR. CoBDEN and all his gang out of the country.
He is a dangerous firebrand that must be extinguished, or he'll be burn-
ing us all out of our berths. However, he’s too ignorant, luckily, to do
much harm, and if ever he comes across my º double him up
like a Gibus hat, in no time—and then I will carry him under my arm
to Almack's, to show the world what a regular flat he is. So much for
CoBDEN, and now, my boys, I’m any man's game for blind-hookey,
lansquenet, or a throw with the bones, or a short pipe, or anything you
please, my little dears, from a dog-fight to a bowl of brandy-punch.”
Splitting the Difference.
THE Morning Herald, in speaking of M. CARNot, in its paper of the
14th, calls him “a half cynical, half mystical, half Wºº. half
Johan PAUL RICHTER enthusiast.” We always considered CARNot
a sort of incarnation of the “entire animal” doctrine, but if we are to
believe the Herald, he is one of the most half-and-half of republicans.
It is evident that, in the event of future misconduct, a man of so
many halves will be allowed no quarter; and though we do not quite
see the force of the Herald's arithmetic, in assigning four halves to
one man, still on the principle of his being a man beside himself, the
anomaly may be perhaps accounted for.
Weights and Measures for the Million.
QNE pound of chalk makes two gallons of milk.
Two twigs of birch broom—one ounce of tea.
Three ounces of sand-half a pound of sugar.
Qne stick of Spanish liquorice–two pots of porter.
Twenty noisy boys—one infuriated beadle."
Six friends in the pit—one blaze of triumph.
Eight Protectionist facts—one falsehood.
SOMETHING BEYOND A Joke.
MANY persons involved in the Railway Mania of 1845 have asked
whether the applicants for Shares, and the Directors of a defunct
Company, are in the same position. They certainly are not, the differ-
ence being, that, while the Committee-men are ill-at-ease, the share-
seekers are simply all-ott-ees, which makes all the difference.
NOOKS AND CORNERS OF CHARACTER.
THE MAN WHO STOPS THE BOTTLE.
If you notice, there is sure to be one man at the table who is always
stopping the bottle.
This man has peculiarities so patent, that we are confident there is a
race of men who are born Bottle-STOPPERs.
The Bottle-Stopper is generally a poor, inanimate, dull creature,
who sits, scarcely stirs, and never speaks—or, if he speaks, he stammers,
unless he stutters, when he is sure to blush double-crimson-deep. He
is both nervous and absent, so that, if he is recalled to his senses, his
nervousness, upon being made conscious he is in the company of ladies
and gentlemen, is more painful to witness than his absence,—so, of the
two, it is much better to let him remain absent.
In appearance he is awkward, and cannot carve without throwing
something off the dish. He wears a white neckcloth, that has contracted
a ludicrous habit of twisting round his neck.
In intelligence, his countenance is not unlike a male ballet-dancer’s,
but there the likeness stops, for the Bottle-STOPPER never smiles, or
ſº in the same bewitching manner that the ballet-dancer does, when
he is pleased. All kind of animation seems to have absconded from his
pale face long ago. He looks much more likely to cry than to laugh; so,
if you are wise, you will not attempt the latter for fear of succeeding
in the former.
Let the conversation be ever sobrisk, he never appears to listen. His
thoughts, if he has any, are out of the room. The jokes may fly about
in all directions, but he is following a blue-bottle along the ceiling, or
else building a red-hot castle in the coals. He is only awakened from his
studies by a powerful entreaty to “pass the bottle; ” when he rubs his
eyes to see where he is.
As a matter of course, the Bottle-Stopper has not the smallest
taste for wine. His ignorance in this respect is something con-
temptible. An unmarried lady knows more of champagne than he does.
The youngest man of the party, who is rubbing up for a pair of whiskers,
can tell a fine glass of port, with a higher knowledge of its goodness,
than he can. When asked to fill his glass, he helps himself to the bottle
that is nearest to him, without any reference, to the wine he has been
drinking last. Red or white—sparkling or still–Rhine wine or French
wine—it is all the same to him. If it was table beer—or no better than
SoYER's Nectar—he would drink it all the same.
As the Bottle-Stopper never says a word, he is not much spoken
to. He would not be noticed at all, if it were not, for his unfortunate
propensity to keep the bottle constantly by his side. This propensity
only elicits a playful observation at first, but as the error is repeated
every time the bottle travels round, he is sharply called to order by
some bald-headed, elderly gentleman, who begs of him, in a military
voice, to “Look a little more alive, and send round the port.” These
reprimands grow sharper at each new offence, till at last the Bottle-
STOPPER is happy to escape the moment “coffee” is announced, leaving
the elderly gentleman and his portly compeers to denounce
“stupid fellow,” as soon as his back is turned. .
He is not more lively with the ladies than with the gentlemen. He
takes refuge in some large portfolio of prints, and disappears myste:
riously during some heavy ordnance piece of -
quietly out of the street-door. A week afterwards he leaves his card,
and is never seen again.

ornamental, and the general apology for stupidity cannot be made in his
favour, for he is not even rich.
at the last minute to fill up the gap made by the unavoidable absence of
some better invitation.
What the Bottle-STOPPER may be in private life, we have no means
of knowing, and we are rather glad of it. But we can imagine him to
be always in arrear with his rent, never to eat his dinner till it is
erfectly cold, to be plunged in the darkest ignorance with regard to
#. insurances, and all commercial transactions, and never by any
accident, to keep an appointment, or recollect a single thing he has
promised. He is the sort of man who would invite twenty persons to
dinner, and then forget everything about it. We can fancy his starting
for the Derby on a Thursday morning, or if there was an eclipse to-day,
that he would be rushing out to see it to-morrow. After all, he is as
harmless as he is simple; only, as a general rule, we should say: “Never
sit º, to the BöTTLE-Stopper at dinner, if you possibly can
avoid it.
P.S. We have dimed at many hundred tables, and have known, in our
varied “mahogany” experience, many hundred Bottle-Stoppers, but
we must say, in justice to a much-calumniated country, that we have
never met with an Irishman yet who was a Bottle-Stopper!

MR. FINIGAN'S LAMENT.
He following Poem, upon an event which at present
occupies much of the public attention in Ireland, has
been sent to us by a gentleman connected with the
Knife Board of Dublin Castle:–
O TIM, did you hear of thim. Saxons,
And read what the peepers repoort P
They’re goan to recal the Lifinant,
And shut up the Castle and Coort]
Our desolate counthry of Oireland,
They’re bint, the blazyards, to desthroy,
And now having murdthered our counthry,
They’re ; to kill the Viceroy,
ear boy;
‘Twas he was our proide and our joy!
And will we no longer behould him,
Surrounding his . in throngs, . .
As he weaves his cocked-hat from the windies,
And smiles to his bould aide-de-congs P
I liked for to see the young haroes,
All shoining with sthripes and with stars,
A horsing about in the Phaynix,
And winking the girls in the cyars,
e
l x
A smokin' their poipes and cigyars.
Dear MITCHELL exoiled to Bermudies,
Your beautiful oilids you’ll º: -
And there’ll be an abondance of croyin
From O'BRINE at the Keep of Good Hope,
When they read of this news in the peepers,
Acrass the Atlantical wave,
That the last of the Oirish Liftinints
Of the oisland of Seents has tuck lave.
GoD save
The QUEEN–she should betther behave.
And what’s to become of poor Dame Sthreet,
And who'll ait the puffs and the tarts,
Whin the Coort of imparial splindor
From Doblin's sad city departs P
And who'll have the fiddlers and pipers,
When the deuce of a Coort there remains:
And where’ll be the bucks and the ladies,
To hire the Coort-shuits and the thrains 2
In sthrains,
It’s thus that ould Erin complains!
There’s CounsELLOR FLANAGAN's leedy,
'Twas she in the Coort didn’t fail,
And she wanted a plinty of popplin, -
For her dthress, and her flounce, and her tail;
She bought it of MISTHREss O'GRADY,
Eight shillings a yard tabinet
But now that |. Coort is concluded,
The divvle a yard will she get;
I bet,
Bedad, that she wears the old set.
There’s SURGEoN O'ToolE and Miss LEARY,
They’d daylings at MADAM O’RIGGs’;
Each year at the dthrawing-room sayson,
They mounted the neatest of wigs.
When Spring, with its buds and its dasies,
Comes out in her beauty and bloom,
Thim tu’ll never think of new jasies,
Because there is no dthrawing-room,
For whom
They’d choose the expence to ashume.
There’s ALDERMAN ToAD and his lady,
'Twas they gave the Clart and the Poort,
And the poine-apples, turbots, and lobsters,
To feast the Lord Liftinint's Coort.
But now that the quality’s goin,
I warnt that the aiting will stop,
And you’ll get at the Alderman's teeble
The devil a bite or a dthrop,
Or chop,
And the butcher may shut up his shop.
Yes, the grooms and the ushers are goin,
And his Lordship, the dear honest man,
And the Duchess, his eemiable leedy,
And CoRRY, the bould Connellan,
And little LoRD HYDE and the childthren,
And the Chewter and Governess tu;
And the servants are packing their boxes,
Oh, murther, but what shall I due
Without you?
O MEERY, with oi's of the blue !
RED-COAT CONSTABLES.
MR. STANFORD, M.P.-Most Profound—of Reading, opposes reduc.
tion in the army; as he conceives that Manchester, Birmingham, and
Liverpool, have especial need of well-filled barracks. If foreign laurels
are not to be gathered, there may be a good home crop won upon
English soil. At Liverpool, for instance, there is the Financial Reform
Association, that requires military watchfulness. With a hundred
pen-knives whetted to scratch out certain items in the civil list, such
as thousands per annum for Hereditary Falconers and Masters of
Buckhounds, we must have bayonets continually fixed to overawe and
repress the revolutionary movement.
At , Birmingham, there is Joseph STURGE with many disciples
preaching Universal Peace, advocating pestilent doctrines that will
render the fines' parks of artillery only so much old iron;–Joseph and
his associates alone demand the vigilance of a few battalions.
Then, again, there is the great Freehold Movement. Every man
treasonably bent upon purchasing for himself as much earth as will
grow him a vote, is a social enemy—a hater of the franchise as it is—
and requires at least a couple of red-coats to have an eye upon him.
More; let us consider the helpless condition of the judges without the
aid of the military: “The sentences of the judges could not be put
into execution merely by a small police force.” This is very evident;
most manifest from the many abortive attempts lately made to release
felons from prison vans, and to carry off murderers even from the very
scaffold; attempts only frustrated by the sudden, presence of the
military power, that, sword in hand, scattered the evil-doers.
“When honourable members alleged that the people were calling for reductions in our
military establishments, he asked them what they meant by “the people?' Did they
mean to include, under the term, pickpockets, thieves, and that large body, 70,000 in
the metropolis, who were called ‘the dangerous classes?' If so, he could easily account
for the demand.”
Very good—very wise, MR. STANFORD. To ask for a reduced army
power is to have five fingers itching for the property of our neighbours.
To object to the extravagant outlay upon the household troops is to
be a man marked “dangerous.”
But it is clear that the judges are of little use without the prospect
of military co-operation. The ermine would be defiled by º: con-
tempt, unless protected by scarlet serge. This is the reasoning of
MR, STANFORD–this a specimen of the reasoning animal too often
dubbed M.P., and sent to weary honest people, and fill with froth the
morning papers.
However, from the debate we extract one delicious drop of comfort.
CoLonel SIBTHORP said—
“Allusion had been made to the possibility of outbreaks by anarchical factions: if it
should be found necessary for the preservation of the peace and dignity of this country,
he should be prepared to act against any attempt which the Radicals might make.”
There is a blacksmith dwelling at Lincoln who is prepared—at onl
one day's notice—-to transmute the Colonel's well-known dagger of lat
into a broadsword of most heroic temper. The funds are always safe,
for is not SIBTHORP ever ready ?
BENEWOLENT MACHINES.
SoME experiments which would have highly interested a Boshman or
ay warrior were tried last week in the marshes at Woolwich.
They were carried on, says the Morning Post,
“With shells, the invention of MR. Groves of Birmingham, having for their object,
when burst among troops, to scatter a quantity of prepared material, which would set
their clothes on fire, and destroy the enemy by that means.”
A considerable improvement, this notion, upon that of poisoned
arrows It is difficult, however, to conceive how a shell could set on
fire any clothes but petticoats, and how, therefore, it could be available
against any troops, but Amazons, or, perhaps, Highlanders. . In the
present instance, the shells all burst at the mouth of the howitzer
without igniting even the turpentine, or whatever it was that they were
to fling about. "We had a mistaken notion that, in civilized warfare, all
such weapons had been exploded long ago. Not so, it seems ; and next,
perhaps, it will be proposed that we should fight with vitriol and
aqua-fortis.

A CAMBRIDGE LYRIC.
THE CLASSICAL QUESTIONIST's vow.
WHERE Cam in marrow channel sleeps,
And Johnian towers rise,
Connected with the olden Court
By the modern “Bridge of Sighs,”
A Questionist, of Classic fame,
“Gazed on the flood below.”
And as he cooled his fevered brow,
Poured forth this tale of woe.
“Ye Gods of Hades down below,
. Have mercy on a sinner,
Six weeks of squares and triangles,
And yet but a beginner |
These cosine thetas to the nth
Will drive me crazy soon;
Oh, grant, ye Gods, a quick release,
And bring me home the Spoon.
“With MILLER’s hydrostatic lore,
And GRIFFIN on my lip,
I wish I were a bold Bargee-
Oh, would I were a Gyp.
Little care they for function r,
Sines, º fulcrums, comes,
They blow their baccy as they like,
And rest their lazy bones.
“Oſuot ºped ped' tº rpakréov;
0 Mákapes on high,
Oh, list for once a suppliant voice,
Oh, hear a gownsman's cry.
To you I'll pour libation free
Qf punch, of wine, of beer;
I’ll give you nectar, if you like,
(We’ve only SoYER's here).
“I’ll crown the cup with blooming flowers,
Prepare the festive spread,
And for the guests that meet that night,
The floor shall be their bed;
They shan’t go home till morning,
Till daylight doth appear;"
And gyps and bedmakers shall swim
In ponds of College beer.
“If in the dreadful Senate-house,
Where pens and ink abound,
And Problem Papers, crabb’d and stiff,
Lie heaped on tables round,
Where Moderators look severe,
And men down on their luck,
You’ll deign protect the Muses’ child,
And shield him from a pluck.”
AS GRAWE AS A JUDGE.
ONE. of our illustrated contemporaries favours the public with “a
portrait of LoRD CAMPBELI, in the act of listening to MR. HuM:
PHREY, Q.C., in an action for debt, to recover the price of a boiler.”
We confess, that, if we were doomed to have our portrait taken, we
should hope to be drawn in some more interesting situation than in the
act of listening to a forensic harangue on the price of a boiler. Judging
from the portrait, LoRD GAMEBELL seems to be feeling his subject, for
he looks as if he were trying his hardest to get up the steam. It is to
be regretted that one of the º wags § not make a joke at the
moment of the portrait having been taken, so that a smile might have
been seen to play on the noble lord’s countenance.
If MB. HUMPHREY had thought of the rampantly comic observation
that,' disputes about boilers bring people into hot water,” the object
would have been achieved. Perhaps it would have been better still, if
SIR.F. ThesſGER had reserved his celebrated jeu de not on the subject
of Le Prophète, for the first sitting of the New Chief Justice. As
SIR, FREDERICK's waggery may have escaped the observation of the
Mublic, we re-produce it for the use of young beginners in the facetious
e. Another learned counsel having observed that the parties to the
action were sick of Le Prophète, SIR F. THESIGER rejoined, that it
appeared as if the parties were sick for want of The Profits. The
Court, of course, rang with laughter, for forensic minds are easily
amused. i
THE GREAT SCHOOL OF LONDON.
To those who can learn in the school of the peripatetics, who find
knowledge in every walk of life, and who, as they run, manage to read
—there is, we say, for such a class, an academy in every London street,
a college at the corner of every court, a sort of seminary at every step
and a perfect university in every ºilſ thoroughfare. What a fund
of grammar may be supplied in a ramble from Charing Cross to the
and back again. Behold that man and woman quarrelling, and
recognise at once the great grammatical rule, that the masculine and
the feminine cannot agree. Listen to the abuse bestowed by that coal-
heaver upon that costermonger, and you will at once be struck with the
distinction between proper and improper names. Watch that urchin
extracting the handkerchief from the pocket of the gentleman, and there
is an exemplification of the possessive case, while the coming up of
yonder vigilant policeman illustrates the objective, for it is at once a
case of objection to the thief's walking away. . There is an unhappy
being leaning, in a state of intoxication, against a lamp-post, and
realising the great grammatical theory of an adjective, which is unable
to stand alone.
If we would take a lesson in punctuation, are there not hundreds of
omnibuses *...". loitering, and pausing, to initiate us into the
mysteries of all kinds of stops ? -
We could in the streets of London on any fine #. or fine night,
continue ad infinitum to learn by analogy the rules of the Grammarians,
but in a spirit of deeper inquiry we turn aside from the vulgar crowd,
and seek the i. of the Arcadia known as that of Exeter, where
the beadle, with a letter on his collar, enjoys the ºl. of lettered
ease. Like the hermit with his staff he paces to and fro, meditating on
the emptiness of everything as he gazes in at the windows of the un-
tenanted shops. We never go in at the Exeter Street entrance of the
Arcade, and come out into Catherine Street, without feeling that we
have gone through something indescribable, and recollecting it after-
wards as one of the most melancholy passages of our lives.
THE HIDDEN NEEDLEWOMEN.
THE Chronicle has opened a list of the names and addresses of
London needlewomen; of the suffering creatures, hard, as it appears,
to discover even by those who require and would fairly pay their
services; in such payment affording the possible luxury of an incidental
chop, to vary the dietary of thrice-drawn tea-leaves and butterless
bread. So far so good, and great praise to the Chronicle.
Punch, however, has his suggestion. Every post-office is a sort of
public place. Punch, then, suggests to all shop-keeping postmasters
and mistresses of London to have a little book—it may cost a penny-
in which the needlewomen of the neighbourhood may inscribe their
names.
If there are those who would hesitate at the prospective “trouble”
of the thing—the said trouble bringing no apparent profit in silver or
copper—Punch begs to observe, that whoever calls at a shop to post a
letter, or to ask a question, is a probable customer. There is, say
six times out of twelve, something presented that is required—
that the dropper-in is reminded of; and thus he or she who comes
only to post a letter, or to ask the whereabouts of a sempstress,
remains to buy.
Pottery Extraordinary.
Who knows anything about a person of the name of KESEPH P. Is
he a Thug, or a Burker, or what | Or else what means this odd adver-
tisement which we saw lately in the Times —
“THE LATE CRUEL ATTEMPT to STIFLE THE Hox, B. Noer, by Keseph, is com-
mented upon in the Earthen Wessel for February, 1850. This monthly periodical is
published by &c., &c.
What are the particulars of the ruffianly outrage above alluded to ? A
grilling on a gridiron would be a fitter punishment for KESEPH than, a
mere dressing in an Earthen Wessel. This piece of crockeryware, by the
way, must be one of the curiosities of literature. One § curious to
ascertain the contents of this periodical pitcher, or pipkin, or pot.
MAKING AWAY WITH HIMSELF,
It appears that the EARL of CLARENDON himself º the project
for abolishing his own office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It would
certainly be very difficult to replace so excellent a Viceroy, and it is
therefore prudent to give up the attempt, when it is quite clear that
any one selected to succeed would inevitably fail.
SCOTCH TENACITY.
THE motto on LoRD CAMPBELI's seal is “Justitie Tenaz.” The
translation of this, evidently, is “Holding on to the Chief Justiceship.”

we think of the unhealthy atmosphere
to which they are consigned? One of
our own commissioners, who has been

to us the evil effects of jostlingtogether

CoMMUNIsM means, we believe,
“HALF-AND-HALF,” and we doubt if
Communism is ever likely to go down in
England, or to become a popular

HERO SURGEONS.
LAUREL grows not for military surgeons. They may, in the very
thick of the fight, dress wounds, amputate, perform acts of most bene-
ficent and dexterous skill—they may, within range of the enemy's fire,
set up their hospital, and haply be swept away by the enemy's shot, -
yet are they held of no more account than the practitioner who
operates in the safe precincts of Guy's or St. Thomas’s.. Occasionally
an army surgeon is i. nevertheless, no laurel twig is planted
upon his grave. He dies as obscurely as the parish apothecary; his me-
mory as “undecorated.” -
This is hardly fair; but then, it is very English. We are, unques-
tionably, a great people; and in the serenity of our greatness, rarely
vouchsafe to acknowledge the existence of people of science. To be
sure, now and then, there is a sprinkling of th. in the parties of high
º life; just a flavour of science—a tint or two of pictorial art;
ut, as a principle, the English Court and the English Government do
not condescend to be #.iar with genius that is only pacific. A great
Captain kills a few thousand Indians, and on his return home, he is
immediately summoned “above the salt” at Windsor. A thousand
times greater man—a marvellous worker in iron, one STEPHENson,
drives the 2,000,000th rivetin the plate of the Britannia Bridge, thereby
consummating a work as great as the Pyramids, with utility incalculable
subliming the greatness, and we suffer France to step before us, and,
in her way, acknowledge and adorn the skill of the mighty master.
Had STEPHENSON, from the cannon's mouth, fired away a hundredth part
of the iron with which he has griped Menaishore to shore, his coat
would have been hung with trinkets thick as a jeweller's window.
The soldier, in his terrible trade, inflicts pain, maims, kills. The
Surgeon, a skilled and watchful beneficence, waits in the track of blood,
and comforts, assuages, saves. The heroic destroyer obtains, at least,
the Order of the Bath, the surgeon only wears the Order of Neglect.
SIR, DE LAcy Evans asks when a decoration is to be presented “to
medical officers who may have been present, and proved deserving in
important military and naval actions?” And “when” remains unan-
swºred. It is so glorious to fire a bulletinto aman—but nothing, whilst
bullets are flying about the operator, to extract the ball. Very service-
able to the state is it to cut sabre-gashes, of small account to heal the
hurts received. Destruction is a demi-god; mere healing, a pettifogger.
We raise a hundred statues to MARs, but not an ounce of bronze to
Escularrus. Glory may be written on a drum-head, but is not to be
put down upon lint.

Gentleman. WHAT’s the price of this red herring?
Jºshmonger. You shall have that one for a halfpenny, Sir.
Gentleman. Well, I’ve no money about me, but I can give a postage-
stamp, if you can oblige me with change.”
EXPENSIVE SOCIETY.
We should have thought that so dignified an individual as a judge of
a superior Court would find no difficulty whatever in getting into the
very best society; but we presume it is on the ground of a judge
ceasing to be a man of parties—and accordingly declining all invitations
-that he is allowed a very handsome sum for an associate. Of course,
if great judicial dignitaries must be very particular indeed with whom
they associate, it is desirable that they should be allowed to find
associates for themselves, and a few thousands a year can’t be con-
sidered misapplied in a matter of this kind, for a judge would soon
grow very dull indeed without a single associate. -
The office, whose duties consist, we º: of constant companion-
ship, with the judge, must be very agreeable in the present day, when
the bench is graced with nice, genial, gentlemanly, well-informed, and
high-minded men, but there have been periods when it might have been
said of many a judge, that his lordship's room was preferable to
his lordship's company. The associate has probably the task of starting
topics of small talk to relax the judicial mind, and occasionally perhaps
tº take a part in picking one of those dry old bones of contention that
the legal appetite yearns for the discussion and digestion of. We
believe the salaries of the associates of the judges are from £1000 to
£2000 a year, but we think there are many who would accept the
situations for the mere privilege of associating with some of the most
agreeable and entertaining men in England, who deserve rather to be
paid than to pay for allowing others to become their associates.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THE SURPLUS.
We have had some wonderful years lately; but this year seems likely
to be more wonderful than any of them. The Whig Government has
got a surplus of some £2,000,000. The question was what were they to
do with the money? -
They might have invested it in the creation of a fund for the reward
of literary and scientific merit.
They might have applied it to the liquidation of the National Debt-
settling, we would suggest, in the first place, England's little account
with HoRATIA. - -
They might have appropriated some of it to the erection of a decent
National Gallery. --- -
But they had better have sent it all to the British Museum, which
institution only is the proper receptacle for such a curiosity as a
Whig surplus.
A BAD spec.
THE late Socialist triumph in the Paris elections may be said to
present an illustration of very large returns and very small profits.

A SPIDER OF WESTMINSTER HALL.
THE pious GooDMAN in his “ Fall of Man” takes it as an especial
evidence of the beauty and simplicity of English law that “Providence
hath so fitly ordained it, as prophesying, or prescribing...a lesson that
the timber in Westminster Hall should neither admit cobweb nor
spider.” Fortified by such authority, we are disposed to consider the
correspondent who below addresses us as a designing impostor; never-
theless we give his communication, desiring the courteous reader to
judge for himself.
COUNTY COURTS BILL.
“MR. PUNCH,-It has been moved to extend º of County
Courts to debts just under £50. From £20 to £50 is a jump indeed;
and the hairs of barristers' wigs, as in duty bound, stand on end at the
suggestion. The Attorney-General looks professionally grave at the
notion; and prophesies all sorts of evil, every kind of inconvenience,
from so sweeping a measure. -
“Now, Mr. Punch, if anything in life have cause to fear sweeping
measures, it is myself—a spider of Westminster Hall; a spider that
has descended in a right line from the days of Stephen. The County
Courts Bill may, nine times out often, be made a puzzle and a flam-
if it receive no further aircrafton than mere extension, it may take in-
nominally take in—a £100, and law will be as dear as ever; and
defendants, like flies in a web, be caught and held inextrically in
the meshes of the attorney. Let us, Sir, consider the beautiful con-
struction of the County Courts Bill as it stands. It is, indeed, a very
pretly bit of network. -
“When the plaintiff dwells more than twenty miles from the
defendant, and the debt is in shape of a Bill,—how easy and how very
satisfactory it is, to endorse the said Bill to a friend distant more than
the statute .." miles from the acceptor! By these facile means the
cause is a cause for the superior court, and the costs are thumping
accordingly. - - - -
“When plaintiff and defendant dwellin different districts, and goods
are sold and delivered to distant defendant, then again may plaintiff
elect to sue in superior court, snapping his fingers at the very nose of
the County Court judge!
“Again, attormies are privileged folks. When they themselves are
plaintiffs—and nothing so common, especially for Hebrew discounters
as to sue upon their own stamps—they have this high prerogative, to
make the most of the defendant, by the more expensive process,
‘grinding his bones’ to make their best wheaten bread!. However, by
an after ‘amending act, the privilege, before ‘enjoyed” by attorney of
being sued in superior court, is taken from him; but, as a sweet con-
sideration for such loss, he is still permitted, as plaintiff, to take
defendant to the dearest market!
“Why, there is Moses FITzogRE, Esq., attorney-at-law — sharp
fellow . He alwayssues in the superior court. ...And why? Because.”
says Moses, “defendant won’t risk #10 or £15 in setting me right; but
to stop the bother will pay costs of writ; a dirty £115s, or £2, as
magnanimity may be.” -
“Observe, Mr. Punch, to move to deprive plaintiff of costs will
amount to some £10 for expenses of motion. Then, a demurrer follows,
and who shall say where the costs shall end, until a receipt infull, to
some romantic amount, be duly obtained and—paid for?
“So you see, Mr. Punch, with even an extension of the County Court
Act to £50, if it be nothing more than extension, there will yet remain
ample work, and sufficient profit for
“Yours, (in a line,)
“A SPIDER OF WESTMINSTER HALL.
“P.S.. I perceive that the attormies are moving to be relieved of
expense of certificate tax. If they succeed, will letters fall from 6s. 8d.
to 4s. 6d. P’’
A Protectionist Banquet.
THE Morning Post says—
“Another novel importation of foreign production has now taken place in the shape
of a parcel of 108 bundles of hº by the steamer Earl of Auckland, from Rotterdam, the
growth and produce of Holland."
The importation of hay is a result of Free Trade, which would, we
should think, be palatable even to Protectionist donkeys.

illuminating properties to sulphuretted hydrogen, with a view to light

THE AUTHORS OF OUR own PLEASURES.
Next to the pleasure of having done a good action, there is nothing
so sweet as the pleasure of having written a good article!
SIBTHORP “WHEN AT OXFORD.”
DEEPLY shall we regret the day-
may it be a century distant-when
SIETHoRP shall be removed from
the House of Commons to West-
minster Abbey. SIBTHoRP should
be a joy for ever. Even as the
mummies of Egyptian royalty fix
upon the visitors of the British
useum the memory of a long-
departed fact, Egyptian civilisa-
tion, so does Sibthorp, in his
old Tory swathings, tell of the
days that are gone ºday's of buck-
skin breeches' loyalty and hatred
of wooden shoes; days of fox-
hunting and hard drinking to
s follow; days when GeoRGE THE
THIRD was really the father of his
people, and Royal CHARLotte
their nursing mother; days when
Tyburn had its weekly batch of
highwaymen, coiners, and house-
breakers, and a squeamish senti-
mentality lowered not the useful
gains of the executioner. Last
week, SIBTHORP was very strong
upon Mr. EwART's motion for es-
tablishing town libraries for the
eople. SIBTHQRP, for himself,
- - eclared that “he did not like
reading at all, and he hated it when at Oxford.”
A certain Spanish author writes a strange matter of a canon named
TIN, “excellently pious, but an incorrigible blockhead.”. In vain
he puzzled himself to learn, till SAINT IsIDöRE appeared to him in a
dream and made him eat a book! Whereupon MARTIN awoke alearned
man, and wrote the purest Latin!
How much would the world have gained, if SAINT IsIDoRE had only
paid such a visit to SIBTHoRP “when at Oxford!”

ARMY INTELLIGENCE.
WE are glad to find that the high state of discipline of the British
army is likely to be carried still higher by the contemplated reductions,
which will cut off vast numbers of men without diminishing the
uantity of officers. It is contemplated that our army will, in time, be
. to boast of such efficiency in the way of command, that every
private will have at least six superiors to look after him. In order to
test the value of this kind of arrangement, it has been proposed to
º ToMKINs, of the Grenadiers, under the new system, which will
e established if the present mode of lopping off from the ranks, and
leaving the upper grades untouched, should be persisted in.
ToMKINs will undergo a series of drills at the hands—or rather at
the voices—of the numerous officers whose duty it will be to keep up
his efficiency, by showing the juvenile soldier how to handle his musket,
and eventually teaching the young idea how to shoot.
The following will be a sample of the mode in which ToMKINs will
be addressed, and we only trust that though too many cooks spoil the
broth, it will not turn out that too many officers spoil the soldier:—
Adjutant. Heads up, ToMKINs.
First Lieutenant. Keep your stomach in, ToMKINs.
Captain. Steady, ToMKINs, Steady.
Second Lieutenant. As you were, ToMKINs.
#. You’ll go back into the awkward squad, ToMKINs.
Colonel. Eyes right, ToMKINs.
All the Officers together. Chest out, stomach in, eyes right, shoulders
left, head foremost, toes out, knees straight, steady, steady, ToMKINs!!!

SUNDAY EVENINGPS AMUSEMENT IN THE CITY.
FoREIGNERs complain that there are no exhibitions open on a Sunday
evening. There is, however, an entertainment in the City accessible to
those who can procure an admission. It is even attended by some of
the clergy, whose only complaint of it seems to be that they get bad
places. “SPEs” thus writes to the Times :-
“Sir, Happening to be present at one of the ‘suppers' given on Sundays during
Lent to the boys of Christ's Hospital, I was grieved to see that the seat assigned to the
head masters and tutors was a low form behind all the spectators, upon a level with the
seats allotted to the servants of the establishment, the upper places being entirely
reserved for the governors and their friends.’
We sometimes hear of a ploughman's publicly devouring a leg of
mutton as a “disgusting exhibition.” Is there anything much more
refined or intellectual in the sight of a lot of hungry boys eating their
supper ? To those who enjoy a display of voracity, the Zoological
Gardens on Monday at feeding time would surely afford a higher treat
than the spectacle on the previous evening at the Bluecoat School.
The object of thus making the scholars agazing-stock at their meals is
not very conceivable. Are they made a public show of as the recipients
of charity to humiliate them P We should think such an exposure
could hardly be pleasant to themselves, and for our own part we have
no desire to be its spectators. We had much rather go and see how
the citizens would eat, if they were obliged to keep Lent all the week,
and indulged with one good supper on the Sunday. -

VIRGIN GOLD. HUNTERS IN CALIFORNLA.
The Toronto Independent gives an account of two young and beautiful
ladies from Florida, who have gone to California, and are gold-seeking
there on their own account, with no assistance but that of an old negro.
The eldest of them is not 20; so that, as the punning reader, will not
fail to observe, they are both minors. Ransacking the bowels of the
earth is an extension of females' mining operations, which have been
hitherto confined to the heart of man. From the last named diggins
they have often obtained large quantities of the precious metal, and
have generally counted themselves very unlucky if they got no more
gold than there is in a wedding ring.
English young ladies need not go to California. They have a Sacra.
mento at home in the Nisi Prius Court, where damages for breach of
promise of marriage are extracted from the pockets of the unwary by
the sieve of an action, and the scoop of a barrister's silver tongue.
AN APPEAL FROM “WHITE STICK.”
MR. PUNCH-I appeal to you, as the common guardian and bene:
factor of the snubbed and the º In the width, length, and
depth of your benevolence, you will not think the less of me, because I
ama Stick—a White Stick. A Stick cut to the heart—for sticks have
hearts—by the cruelty of, I believe, a daily print, called the Times-I
am told, a newspaper.
It is not for me, Mr. Punch, to boast of my long, honourable, and
useful descent. As White Stick to the Court of England, I may claim
for my genealogical tree—whence I was cut by the Norman sword of
William—a very distinguished oak still flourishing near Battle. At this
moment, I feela sympathy with my illustrious kin; and though to the
eye and finger of all Lord Stewards of Royal Household, I may
seem only so much dead wood, I do assure you that, touched by the
influence of this spring season (notwithstanding the east-wind), I do feel
the sap rising—rising, I say, sympathetically with the vital fluid that is
now coursing up and down the trunk of my venerable parent. Indeed,
I cannot promise—were Ionly stuck inch-deep in the generous soil of a
Court—that I would not bud and put forth leaves, and then acorns, and
become—like my ancestor—a mighty oak... But this is to expect too
much. Let me be satisfied that it is nevertheless my proud destiny to
betwiddled twixt the finger and thumb of the Most Noble, and Most
Puissant MARQUEss of WESTMINstER.
Mr. Punch, it is with that distinguished individual—within these few
days more distinguished than ever by the abuse of the print called the
Times—that I am proud to make common cause. We are, for a time,
one and the same: Marquess and White Stick—wood and wood. Well,
Sir, the Times throws it in the teeth of the illustrious nobleman, that,
gilt and double-gilt as he is by stone-blind fortune, he should yet yearn
for the barren honour of White Stick? Why not? The Times marvels
that noblemen—not merely golden calves, but calves with diamond eyes,
rl teeth and emerald hoofs—should abase themselves by donning the
ivery of HER MAJESTY' Why, Mr. Punch, it is this beautiful
humility that makes the true glory of a monarchy. The lower the
self-degradation of the nobleman, (“nobleman,” according to DEBRETT)
the higher the royalty. The greater the self-abnegation of the servant,
the larger the honour paid to the served. Whence would the Times
obtain the QUEEN's Domestics—I mean the Domestics paid and tick-
etted by the state? Is HER MAJESTY to order an advertisement in the
newspapers:
ANTED, a Lord Steward of the Household. He must not be of higher
rank than a Baronet. No person with £400,000 per annum need apply.
Followers allowed.
Is it by such means that the Times would have the QUEEN's noble-
men in livery appointed? Am I-White Stick—to cease to be as much
the object of hope, desire, and noblest ambition—of watchfulness by
* and prayer by night--as though I was the wand of a Prophet?
may be thought prejudiced in the matter; but I deny, denounce the
assumption—when I state it to be my belief that the English monarchy
owes its serenity at home, and its power abroad, not to its legal and
social institutions—not to its navy and its army—but to this one virtue
alone, the humility of HER Majesty's state servants. Magna Charta
is all very well; but the parchment it’s written on is of no more value
than an old drum-head. No.; the real strength of the country is in the
lappets of the Mistress of the Robes—when that Mistress happens to
be a Marchioness or Duchess. Not to the battles of a Lord Nelson
do we owe glory as a state; but to the humility of a LoRD ByRoN, a
Lord (in livery) in Waiting. Waterloo is all very well; but I should
like to know of what worth is the baton of F.M. the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON to myself-White Stick—when humbly, reverently, fearingly,
grasped by the devoted hand of a MARQUEss of WesTMINstERP
hat a noble, what a Christian answer is it to an ignorant and
democratic charge of pomps and vanities of a Court, to be able to tell
of Footmen Dukes, Chambermaid Countesses, and Groom and Hunts-
truly lowly of heart, your only guide to the discovery is the Court Guide.
The true Book of Humility is the Red Book.
The Times, no doubt intending a sneer—says, “There is a broad vein
of plush that traverses the whole frame-work of English society.” I.
rejoice at the beautiful truth—a truth, that despite of affor
tinctions, really puts the Duke on a level with his butler, and
cheek by jowl, the Earl and the groom. Thus, beautifulº
thinking is the Mºst Noble the Mºsquess or Westminsº
Lord White. Stick! ...True; he might be a stirring benevolencº
national hospitality. With his preposterous amount of wealth,
Head of Brass, might make his wealth warm and animate
cold Feet of Clay, but the Marquess, by grasping White Sti
himself a meek, a humble, self-denying, Christian. He mig
Prince; his acts most princely in the widest and loftiest senseº
phrase—but he shrinks from the ostentation. He retires within him-
self, and stands in the Court of Queen Victor.IA, with his mind in
#. soul in livery ſlowliness bound up with hope, with crest of
sh-and-loaf on livery buttons)—Lord sº ! . -
That he may long so stand; a monument of humility, is the desire of
at once his Friend and Rod,
WHITE Stick.

Y ExPANSIVE
* FRIEND.
Nº ſº “I have
VMI'ſ been deeply
ſº touched by the
affectionate zeal
—and you must
have been se-
creting the good-
mess for a long
time—that you
have so ... sud:
denly exhibited
towards Greece.
You have really
bowels—bowels
in the sympa-
thetic sense.
That you have
* double beak,
and double gul-
let, Hungary
is a mangled,
have a heart to pulsate
great truths—it will take
bleeding witness; but that you should .
for “a brave people’ is a truth that—like all gre -
some time for the incredulous and apathetic English to be reconciled to.
“You have taken little OTHo under your wing... We have before
heard the story of the Eagle and Child; but you, in your astonishing
3. afford a prettier and more humane version of the tale. You
o not propose to make a meal of the young gentleman; you have no
beak—not either of the two—for any bit of Greece, and as for Turkey,
ou can't abide it. No 3 your intentions are almost dove-like; having
een glutted with carrion on the fields of Hungary, you wouldn’t
‘rumple the feathers of a Barbary hen.”
“Well, it must be confessed that OTHo has been hardly used by that
hard-hearted PALMERston. A great man in debt is always a subject of
interest. Tradesmen may smash by the score, and it is of no more
account to a thinking people than the bursting of so many soap-bubbles;
but a king—nay, such a bit of a kingling as small OTho—in difficulties,
is a sight to make even CoMMIssionER Courvoisie R. PHILLIPs melt,
like brass in the furnace.
“And after all, Otho was right not to pay his debts. He had been
so long let alone by PALMERston, that when sea-attorney PARKER
served the writ, with a few forty-two pounders to proceed to execution
—OTHo had, in his own belief, sufficient justification to cry "Robbery,’
‘Piracy,” and “Murder!'. How could Otho—knowing himself—expect
that the plain and plodding MR. Wyse meant what *. said, when, in
the simplest manner—and without any Court varnish at all—he
informed M. LoNDos that War-Secretary PALMERston was by no
means a man to be trifled with? That he had ships and metal at sea to
back his demands: and a wise and fluent tongue in his head to justify
them? Is it extraordinary that Otho should forget that little brush
at . Acre? By no means; for, to all experience, kings are sieves;
nothing—as Louis-PHILIPPE, now of the Star-and-Garter, Richmond—
nothing remains with them.
“It is very true, my Expansive Double-Headed Friend, that the dirty
money claim put in by TMR. WYSE did not amount to a thousand
pounds. Not half as much as LADY PALMERston lays out in a season
of evening parties: it is very true that the Greek Treasury—to say
nothing of OTHo's private money-box—contained somewhere about
nine hundred pounds; but then, what an extortionate creditor to
expect, even under such circumstances, a penny in payment? England
had quietly waited so long, it could be no matter if she continued to
wait longer. Besides, it is well known, that of all countries of the
earth, England has least need of money. At this moment there are
millions lying barren in her Bank cellars. And yet PALMERston
bullies for a dirty nine hundred pounds! Bullies Greece, above all
other nations ! Greece that has given us HomeR, PLATO, Sophocles,
and the Elgin Marbles! In the immortal words of a small minister,
now departed—‘It is too bad.”
“Proceeding to extremities, LoRD PALMERston at this moment holds
about 50 Greek ships, with the crews of each, as a security not only
for the money due from Greece,—but to assure himself of satisfaction
for a certain act of implied ill-manners towards a few English blue-
jackets. This is really shameful. But then the Greek owners and
Greek crews must be mightily comforted by the distress you feel for
them. The more so as your sympathy is warm and new, like new-
drawn milk. Hungary was a matter to make a meal upon; so much
garbage. But Greece–classic Greece, dear to the Russian breast—
Greece is a land to feel, and if oceasion be, to weep for "
“There is no doubt, my Wide-spread Friend, but the abrupt and
contumelious PALMERSTON.—who does somehow, with that adroit way
of his, get over the English Commons—by accepting the services of the
Gallic Cock to crow between him and Orno, did treat your Extensive-
ness with a spice of º just a pinch of it. But then how
serenely, how beautifully, how benevolently, did you turn the War-
Minister's ill-manners to good account %. cared nothing for per-
sonal dignity, not you, -if it was for the welfare of Greece. So Otho
was made comfortable, you cared not how much your feathers were
plucked or draggled. his is so unlike your double-headedness, that
plain people are at once charmed and puzzled with it.
“I fear, however, that you will make nothing of PALMERSTON : now
northern ABERDEEN was another sort of person. PALMERSTON, it is
said, continually keeps John BULL in hot water; but if he does, he at
least keeps his hands clean, which could not be said of him when cared
for by the auld Scotch wife who ‘did” the Foreign before PETARD
PALMERSTON.
“Accept my best wishes for your growing benevolence—seeing you
have moulted your old feathers—and believe me, with every sign of
respect,
“Yours,
“THEIRED LION.”
[Mr. Punch, in his wise impartiality, thinks it only fair to let the
“Red Lion” have his roar—since much may be roared on both sides.]
HOW TO SAVE THE TIME OF THE SESSION.
ALL persons, both in and out of Parliament, seem to agree that it will
be desirable during the present session to be economical of time, a com-
modity with regard to which there has usually been the wildest extra-
vagance. A suggestion has been thrown out that several members
should be allowed to speak at one time, an idea which we have ;
entertained, and with which we have on a former occasion entertain
the public. There would be an immense saving effected by this arrange:
ment, for inasmuch as the speeches if spoken in unison would in all
probability not be heard, the unpleasant necessity of a reply would be
avoided. A dull speech is bad enough of itself, but the worst of it is,
that it may give rise to a duller answer, and thus when a mere talker
gets upon his legs we never know the end of it. Speaking to no end
at all is quite a senatorial failing, and the conversion of a number of
harangues into a chorus would certainly assist the members to keep
time instead of losing it. Personalities would also be checked, for two
angry speeches going on at once would neutralise each other to a great
extent, and—to make use of a chemical term—would correct each
other's acidity.
STOCK EXCHANGE.
The following is part of a letter from Mr. Punch's Brokers,
MEssRs. STAG, DIDDLE, and BoLTER:-
“The Swindleton Extensions are beared heavily, and so are the Gam-
montown Continuations. I think the latter would be safe at le. 3d. to
1s. 4d. nett. Shall I take 1000 or 1500 ° -
“A Director of the Bubbleton Junction has failed, having sold options
largely, and this event has occasioned a lively demand for Squeak!own
Preferences. May I take 500 of these at 2s. 6d.” The news from
France is alarming. The PRESIDENT has been fired at, and came away
by the third-class evening train, with only a change of linen. The
Socialists are triumphant everywhere. May I bear Paris and Rouen's
for you? You may sell 1500 or 2000 to deliver, safely. By the by,
what do you say to a fly at Dragglestone and Dripstones? They are
likely to be a good thing; Sw1NDLE and SNAPP are enquiring for them;
6d. is offered and 74d. would be taken for the pre-
ferences 7 per cent. shares, including the dividends
now due, which will be paid out of the first funds
coming in to capital account.
“Yours,
“STAG, DIDDLE, and BoITER.”
Nature's Livery.
We have lately witnessed a great, tendency to what CARLYLE would
call flunkeydom, on the part of our old friend Nature, who is beginning
to put on her livery of green for the season that has just commenced.
Her little lawns may be compared to velvet smalls, and every flower is
a livery button, while the pastures look as if she was preparing to stuff
her calves. Before the end of the autumn we shall find Nature wearing
the epaulettes of a golden harvest, which, however, will be all thrashed
out of her by the close of the year.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

KNIFE-AND-FORK EXHIBITION AT THE
MANSION-HOUSE.
We are proud of England—prouder of London-most proud of
London’s Mayor. Very beautiful was it last week to see his Lordship,
the º and representative of the commercial greatness of the smoky
capital, surrounded by all the Mayors of the kingdom.
*Like a swart Indian with his belt of beads,”
It was a grand metropolitan dish, handsomely garnished!
His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT showed, too, a full-blown
pink of Princes. Nothing could be better than his speech: Simply
given, and strong with good Saxon sense., There was no filagree, no
snip-snip about it; no muslin matter, worked with gold and silver-
thread; but a mas’s speech, uttered for the ears and hearts of men
brought together upon two vital, national occasions;-dinner and work.
Glad are we that PRINCE ALBERT has thrown “his hat.” into the great
ring of the world's industry. Delighted to acknowledge that he has
minded his Punch, and retired from felt. - -
The ARchbishop of CANTERBURY spoke like an Archbishop. He
was afraid that the Church might be indifferent to the purposes of the
Exhibition, they being secular. Why should his Grace have harboured
such a modest doubt? The Exhibition will be the means—it is ex-
pected—of giving us domestic comforts made more comfortable: softer
carpets—easier chairs—linen of a finer web, and purple of deeper and
more enduring dye. Can the Church be indifferent to these? Can
Lambeth neglect them—can Fulham hold them as dust in the balance?
We hope not. Again; the Exhibition will have one peculiar feature
interesting to all nations; for it is whispered that it is the intention of
Bishop PHILPotts to exhibit himself in sackcloth and cinders, as a
model specimen of the meekest of martyrs.
The French Ambassador clubbed some excellent English. Indeed,
should his Excellency ever translate any of his native vaudevilles for any
English theatres, we predict that his success would be prodigious!
Then followed House of Lords and House of Commons; the healths
of Prime Minister and Ex-Prime—of Lady Mayoress and of all the
Mayors—[it was calculated that their united gold chains would have
reached from London (crossing the channel) to Dublin]—and then the
EARL of CARLISLE rose, and gave one of his best orations... And this
was no wonder; for it was the health of “the Workmen of the United
Kingdom.”
This toast, as will be inevitably supposed, was received with nine
times nine deafening cheers, and
*The Prince of all the land
Led them on!”
Indeed Punch has rarely witnessed—with all his knife-and-fork expe-
rience—such emotion; such enthusiasm. The PRINCE cheered—Church-
men dropped grateful tears—Ambassadors embraced one another-
Lords and Commons, and Commons and Lords shook hands—and in
fact, one and all acknowledged the toast with feelings of the deepest
gratitude. They really appeared to vie with one another in the outward
expression of acknowledgment and thankfulness.
hen the excitement had somewhat subsided–
A. WoRKING-MAN (in a fustian jacket) arose at the lower end of the
Hall, and the profoundest silence immediately ensued. The WoRKING-
MAN said-ſhow is it that his speech was omitted from all the news-
pers, it is not our business or our pleasure to inquire; it is, however,
oth to supply what others have failed to chronicle)-
“You R Royal HIGHNEss, My Lords AND GENTLEMEN,
... “ON.behalf of hundreds of thousands of the working men of
the United Kingdom, I am here to thank you. Let bye-gones be bye-
ſº but this, I think, is the first occasion that the fustian jacket has
een acknowledged and received by such a company. (Hear” from
PRINCE ALBERT) But, my Lords, you embolden me to say in my plain
words that the Meeting would hardly have been complete without it.
The workingmen honour the superfine coat of the nobleman—and
respect the lawn of the Church. ("Hear” from the Lord Mayor's
º They admire and are grateful to the red-coat of the field,
and the blue-jacket of the ocean; and now, Gentlemen, such feelings
are only made the stronger and the deeper by the conviction that you
have a somewhat like respect, and like recollection for the fustian
of labour. (Cheers.) We are to have, it seems, an Exhibition of
Work—a great World's Show-shop for the skill of labouring men; for
we are all labourers, mind ye, whether in fustian or super-saxony.
(Laughter and Cheers). The Workmen of England rejoice at it! The
Workmen desire nothing better than to knowtheir brethren of the rest
of the world; and to know them as men are best known—by their
works. (Cheers.) Well, Gentlemen, we Workmen may not be able to
talk French with Frenchmen, and German with Germans; but if our
tongues arnºt skilled, we have our brains—our hands—and our eyes.
e can talk to a machine. (Cheers.) That speaks all languages.
lever’s a lever all over the world—a piston’s a piston. They talk on
the Nile as well as on the Thames; and JACK CHINAMAN–though he
may be puzzled a bit at first-begins to understand ’em as well as John
BULL. (Cheers.) At this Exhibition the brains and hands of all the world
will speak..one common tongue; and depend upon it, Lords and Gentle-
men, the Workmen of the United Kingdom won’t go to the show without
taking somethoughts andmotions worth a bit home with them. (Cheers.)
Some years ago, there was another sort of Foreign Exhibition in London
-of a sort, I hope, we shall never have again, an Exhibition of Foreign
Emperors, and Kings, and Generals. "Tisn’t that I care about object-
ing to them; but *: were brought here after Waterloo-at the peace.
Now, I hope we shall never have another such celebration of peace,
because to have it, we must have a war to begin with. (‘Bravo” from
the French Ambassador.) Instead of the Emperors of Russia and
Austria, and Kings of Prussia and Holland, and Hetmans of Cossacks,
and so forth-let us have a Congress of Manufacturers; let all those
kings send their representatives to the great show-shop in Hyde Park,
and dependupon it, they’ll have a hearty welcome from the “Workmen
of the United Kingdom.’”
The speaker then sat down amidst loud and long-reiterated cheers.
He was, however, scarcely seated, when he was summoned to the
presence of PRINCE ALBERT, who shook him heartily by the hand;
acknowledging the peculiar obligations of himself .#all his class to
the fustian jacket—to labour.

SINGULAR OPTICAL DELUSION.
Gentleman. “THERE, Love: Do You see THAT STEAMERP”
Lady. “OH, DISTINCTLY 1 THERE ARE Two.”
THE MAYORS AND THEIR WRONGS.
We have received communications from two Mayors, who express
themselves hurt at their omission from the long list of Mayors invited
the other day to the Mansion House. The first of these cºmplainants
is the well-known Mayor of Garratt, who, though his whole career has
been a farce, feels indignant at having been excluded from a meeting
which must have contained many characters as ludicrous as his own,
and he does not see why, in his own Garratt, he is not as good as the
London Lord Mayor in his drawing-room.
The second expostulant is the Lord Mayor in Richard the Third,
whº writes through his representative, MR. GARRick GRIMEs, of the
Stoke Pogis Theatre, and who intimates that he ought to have received
a card of invitation, inasmuch as his elevation to the Lord Mayoralty
dates as far back as the year 1826, when he first took office under the
monarchy of M.R., EDMUND KEAN, having been promoted from the
“cream-faced loon” in Macbeth, where his “goose § was regarded
as a bit of quiet nature, unsurpassed for its truthfulness. So thoroughly
did he throw himself into the character of the “cream-faced loom,” that
he always took in a pint of milk over night, in order to get himself up
with real cream, which he always regarded as the grand feature of the
part as SHAKSPEARE wrote it.
We certainly think that it was a serious omission to leave out such a
Mayor as this from the Mansion House Banquet, but we believe the
potentate of the City of London was not to blame, though we cannot
sºy who is, and we must therefore be satisfied with taking the saddle
off the right horse—or the right Mayor, at any rate.
YOUNG CHINA AND COMMERCE.
... INTELLIGENCE from Hong-Kong states that, “Long Cloths” have
improved. Trade, in China, appears to be still in its infancy.
WHAT’S TO BECOME OF THE MARBLE ARCHIP
Now that Buckingham Palace is getting into a state of completeness,
the Marble Arch is in everybody's mouth, for all are asking what is to
be done with it? It has been stated that the process of carting it away
will cost more than the whole concern is worth, and as JoHN BULL is
not in the humour to pay very dearly for another game at marbles, we
cannot exactly say how the affair is to be disposed of... Perhaps the best
mode of dealing with the difficulty will be to take the Arch into the
Court of Arches, by which process the most substantial piece of property
in the whole world could be º got rid of. Somehow or other,
the monstrous pile of masonry must be removed, and the country will
be obliged to anybody who will patriotically give his head to the unsightly
block, with the view of doing away with it.
In MR. CARLYLE's “Latter Day Pamphlet,” No. 1, “The Present
Time,” Mr. Punch encountered the subjoined piece of enigmatical
phraseology:
“Opaque flunkeyism grown truculent and transcendent.”
THE HEIGHT OF FLUNKEYISM.
|
The interpretation of this dark writing did sorely puzzle Mr. Punch till
“We have the satisfaction of announcing that the MARQUEss of WESTMINSTER, the
most opulent member of the English nobility, has finally attained the object of his
life, and is appointed to the office of Lord Steward, with the full privilege of carrying a
Friday last week, when the Times made the announcement following:—
tº: stick about, like Polonius in the play, whenever the QUEEN gives a party to
e lieges.”
The cruel self-degradation of a nobleman into a lackey is flunkeyism
which may well be called “truculent.” That it is “opaque,” or dark,
and “transcendent,” or surpassing all bounds, is too obvious to require
demonstration.

with himself, when he views his
conduct in the mirror of his thoughts,
| and, by the aid of reflection, adjusts
his morals; in the same way that a

of the street, a glass tells him they

the Ereter Arcade on Solitude.
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF THE LAW
AMENDMENT SOCIETY.
THIs admirable society, says our reporter, had an extraordinary
meeting a few nights ago; and although, we strongly suspect our
correspondent of having made the meeting first, and then reported it-
à la ToM THUMB and the giants—we neverthelesss give him the
º: of the “copy” he has prepared, by inserting the account that
oilows :-
LORD BROUGHAM, as usual, took the chair, and opened the business
of the meeting by writing two letters at once, thinking of something
else, talking about sundry matters, and exclaiming, “Now then,
what’s the business before us for this evening?” -
MR. DUNUP rose to present his report on Legal Education.
LoRD BROUGHAM—Oh! ah! Exactly. I’m sure we are very much
obliged to you for coming here, MR. DuNUP. Idare say you can tell
us aſgood deal. Now then, give us the benefit of your experience.
MR. DUNUP proceeded to state that the system of education for the
bar was very defective, and unnecessarily elaborate. He had heard
that a fee of a hundred guineas was usually given to an Equity Drafts-
man to teach the student to draw a bill. Whereas, he (MR. DUNUP)
had been taught to draw a bill and accept one too, for half the money.
He had also heard much from time to time of the intricacies of an
answer; for a bill and answer usually go together. But he (MR.
DUNUP) had always one answer to every bill—and that was, “Not at
home,” through the letter-box; or, when the answer was in writing,
“Gone out. Return in an hour,” was the form in which he answered
every bill that was served upon him.
As to interrogatories they had become such a disgusting matter of
routine, that he had adopted one uniform practice of refusing everythin
to everybody who asked, and considering that those who did not as
did not want anything. When he had endeavoured to answer an inter-
rogatory, he (MR. DUNUP) found he was only opening the door to abuse,
and as he would not stand to be abused, he now opened the door to
nobody. This was the school in which he had learnt the law, and such
was the report on legal education he was prepared to lay before the
meeting.
LORD BROUGHAM. Very good. A very valuable report in its way,
no doubt, Mr. DuNUP, and I shall be glad to have a copy of it. For
my part, I have a total objection to the present mode, by which pupils
give a hundred ineas, or, as the lawyers call them, gas—the worst
name in the world, since from such gas there proceeds no enlightenment
whatever. When I went into MR. (afterwards Chief Justice) TINDAL's
chambers, I was told to copy anything I could catch, hold of, and the
result was, I got so sick of copying in º life, that I have since
become quite an original. At Edinburgh I used to attend Latin
lectures, and when we were questioned, if the question began with
onne, we said Bºian: ; and if it began with An we said Non; so what
with the Nons and the Monnes, it was a pack of nonsense altogether.
His lordship having, during this speech, written several more letters,
rose from his seat, rushed out of the room, and left the meeting to
adjourn itself.
EARLY RISING ExTRAORDINARY.
At the Marlborough Street Police Court, last week, two persons were
brought up, for having. practised imposition on the Duke QF WEL-
LINGTON. To take in his Grace—if there is any truth in proverbs—they
must have got up, as SAMUEL PEPrs says, “mighty betimes.”

A Shot for Government.
ONE of the slight objections to the maintenance of the African
blockade is that around shot, fired by a British cruiser at a slave-ship,
is as likely as not to take an unfortunate direction, and go, crashing,
right through the negroes. Anxious to prevent this little inconvenience
to the blacks from continuing to attend our operations in their behalf,
the Government, Mr. Punch is authorised in stating, will give a hand-
some reward to anybody who shall invent a cannon-ball that can be
warranted to avoid the captives in the slaver, and only hit the crew, or
at least to traverse the negroes without doing them any harm.
CONTINUED success of “THE ELDER BROTHER..”
THE failure of MR. Locke KING's motion for distributing landed
property, in cases of intestacy, according to the same rules as prevailin
personal property, leaves the Elder Brother in Y. of all the
advantages which he has so long enjoyed under the law of primogeniture.
They don't know a Joke when they Hear One.
WE always thought that the smallest joke went the greatest way in
the House of Commons, and that honourable members were too ready
to laugh at the tiniest bit of humour. The following jeu-d'esprit, how-
ever, was received by them in the gravest manner.
“MR. HuDson hoped, from a SENse of RIGHT AND JUSTICE, that the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would,” &c. (Never mind the remainder.)
The House never even as much as smiled; and yet to hear HUDson
alking of “RIGHT AND Justice” strikes us as being the richest joke
in the world. We wonder it was not received with roars!
THE TASTE or SLAVE-SUGAR.'
It is curious that the British palate—in some respects sensitive to
squeamishness—should not revolt at the smack of the whip perceptible
in slave-grown sugar.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
WOOD v. BRICK.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER has admirably discharged
the duty imposed on Wood, by taking the duty, altogether of brick, and
hºmºſºmit for himself a monument of which every untaxed brick
will form part of the foundation. By some it has been suggested that,
as he has proved himself what is technically, or vulgarly, termed abrick,
he should be allowed to alter his name from SIR CHARLEs Wood to SIR
CHARLEs BRIck, without the expense of an Act of Parliament. It was
not to be supposed that the tempting opportunity for puns would be
passed over by that feeble-minded part of the population which is so
fond of “paltering in a double sense,” and occupies itself in making
puns, rather than adopt the Johnsonian alternative of picking pockets.
We have received several hundreds of letters, inquiring whether all
duty will be taken of the regular bricks, and whether we ourselves, as
that extraordinary piece of human clay “a jolly brick,” must henceforth
be considered as functus officii, or off duty. -
We can only say that, as far as we are concerned, we do not mean in
our character of “brick” to avail ourselves of the exemption so
laudably conferred by SIR CHARLEs Wood upon bricks in general.
The duty imposed upon us is a duty we owe to ourselves, as well as to
society; and as we can never be expected to pay ourselves, the duty
must remain in force, though we continue constantly discharging it.
Besides, the duty is not yet taken off carriages, and as we are the
greatest public vehicle for the conveyance of everything that is good,
we cannot by any mode of looking at the matter, be regarded as exempt
from duty.

§
EFFECT of TAKING THE DUTY off “BRicks.”
THE NAVAL ASSISTANT SURGEONS’ MESS.
ANTICIPATED INQUEST.
THE Admiralty persists in compelling Naval Assistant Surgeons to
mess with the midshipmen, instead of admitting them, according to
their age and station, to the ward-room. Very well. Wait the event.
One of these fine days an inquest will be held on the body of BARNABAs
BUNTING, late seaman on board HER MAJESTY's ship Trunnion, alleged
to have bled to death in consequence of the professional incompetency
of Cooper SLIgE, M.D., Assistant Surgeon to the said vessel. .
DR. SLASH, full surgeon to the Trunnion, being called in evidence,
will prove that the deceased BARNABAs BUNTING received a wound in
the airilla, injuring the arillary artery, and occasioning a flow of blood,
to stop which, it was necessary that the subclavian artery should be
taken up and tied. That he, DR, SLASH, being at the time disabled by
gout in the right hand, requested DR. SLICE, the Assistant Surgeon, to
perform the operation, but that gentleman could not do it, wherefore
it was not done, and the patient consequently perished of haemorrhage.
DR. SLICE, on being told, with the usual caution, that he is at liberty
to make a statement, will admit the truth of the facts related by DR.
SLASH. He will then proceed to say that he is now 30 years of age,
and has been an Assistant Surgeon in HER MAJESTY's Navy for eight
years. When he entered the service he had passed a severe examina-
tion, and was then fully equal to the performance of any surgical
operation whatever. But ever since that time, though a Doctor of
Medicine, and . by an Order in Council, ranking with a Lieu-
tenant in the Army, he had been obliged by the Admiralty regulations
to remain in the Midshipmen’s berth. Owing to the constant confusion
which there prevailed, he had been utterly unable to study or to refresh
his memory, and hence he had quite forgotten all the anatomy which he
once knew. Had he been free of the ward-room he could have kept up
his knowledge, and the unfortunate result of his loss of it, which he
deplored as much as anybody, would never have happened.
R. RICHARDISPRITELY, a young gentleman aged 15, Midshipman
on board the Trunnion, and messmate of Dr. SLIce, will describe the
eculiarities of the Midshipmen’s berth, so as to give an idea of the
}. which it affords for medical and surgical studies.
The PRESIDENT of the College of SURGEoNs will depose that a
Surgeon must continually renew his anatomy if he would retain it.
He will confess that he should himself soon forget all he knew of it,
if he did not frequently, by thought and reading, recal its details to his
mind's eye. He will declare that it would be impossible for him to
think or read either, amid the distractions of the Midshipmen’s berth;
and that for any mental occupation he should of the two prefer the
mast-head.
DR. SLICE will produce numerous testimonials, and call various
witnesses, in proof of his former attainments and qualifications.
The CoRoNER will explain to the Jury, that if they consider that
DR. SLICE displayed culpable incompetency, they must return a verdict
of manslaughter against him; but that no man is to be considered
responsible for consequences arising from the misſortune of losing his
memory.
The Jury, after a short consultation, will find “That the deceased
BARNABAs BUNTING died of haemorrhage through the inability of
DR. SLICE to perform a surgical operation by reason of his having for-
gotten his knowledge of anatomy for the want of a fit and proper place
to study in on board ship, owing to the arrangements of the Lords of
the Admiralty.”
BELGRAVIANS! MEND YOUR WAYS.
We have strong faith in the proverb, “Where there’s a will there’s
a way;” but we regret to have met with an instance in which we have
been baffled, for having lately the will to pass along the King's Road,
we could find no way of doing so.
The King's Road, Eaton Square, is indeed in an alarming state; for
it is as rampant with ruts as a field lately under the plough, and
presents to the traveller a truly harrowing spectacle. If a horse
ventures upon it, the poor animal instantly experiences the facilis
descensus, for he is very easily down, and is not very easily got up
alm.
We cannot understand the reason of a principal thoroughfare in the
fashionable locality of Eaton Square—the very heart of Belgravia—
being left in a state of almost mountainous ºfºº unless it is for
the purpose of giving something like a taste of the Ups and Downs of
liſe to the yº, inhabitants.
We have, in the course of our career, been frequently put to the
necessity of exclaiming with the hero of antiquity, aut pian inveniam
aut faciam—I will either find a way or make one. We have laboured
through snow, of which we too plainly saw the drift, in the Alps; we
have waded through the almost º, and always unsettled ashes
of Vesuvius; we have picked our path through the cabbage leaves, and
hopped over the oyster shells of Whetstone Park. We have been almost
jammed up in the gelid icebergs of the Northern regions; we have
encountered the difficulties of a passage in a Bayswater omnibus to the
Bank, and done it in two hours and a half, but “we never! no we
never,” nor reader, “did you ever” experience anything equal to the
troubles of the transit along the King's Road, Eaton Square.
A Tune on our Own Trumpet.
We have been asked if we mean to send any jokes to the “Exhibition
of the Industry of all Nations.”. Certainly not; since our jokes, not
being laboured, can by no means be regarded as the products of industry.
However, we would not discourage any of our contemporaries from
seeking the reward of intellectual toil. But, the temporary building,
which is to contain the Exhibition, would prove much too temporary if
it contained any jokes of ours, which would cause its sides to shake
with such incessant violence that it would be sure to tumble to pieces
in no time.
The INTERREGNUM OF A GREAT MIND.
LoNGFELLow, the American Poet, talking of the strange motley way
in which CARLYLE has lately disguised himself, says, “we still recognise
the monarch in his masquerade.” Let us hope the monarch will soon
throw off the clown's dress, and once more take his seat upon the
throne—a far higher one than any occupied by King—the throne of
reason.

GOOD NEWS FOR GOVERNESSES.
owever, people may talk
about the difficulties at:
tending the position of
a Governess, it is evi-
dent, if there is faith in
an advertisement, that
the task of teaching "in
a gentleman's family”
is a luxury worth paying
for. As to liberal sala-
ries being offered to Go-
vernesses, we do not
wonder at the system
being quite exploded,
when we find that it is
considered probable a
“lady” will enter a
“gentleman's family.”
on the terms set forth
i in the following extract
from a late supplement
(gratis) of the Times:–
WANFP, in a gentleman's family, a LADY, who is desirous of meetin
with a comfortable home, to undertake the EDUCATION of TWO CHILDREN,
of the ages of seven and eight years, and who would consider the above as equivalent
to a salary. She would be required to instruct them in an English education, French
and music, without the aid of masters. Must be of the Established Church. good
references. Address to A.T., at , 17,
This notification seems to imply that there is such a general desire
on the part of well-instructed gentlewomen to undertake the education
of children, that any one having the opportunity afforded her of enjoying
such a delicious privilege, would probably “consider the above as
equivalent to a salary.”. There is certainly something attractive in the
surmounting of difficulties, and there may be, therefore, a kind of self-
compensating principle in the task of, attempting to beat information
into the thick heads of the juvenile members of “a gentleman's
family.” We shall, expect to see shortly an advertisement for a pig-
i.i. will consider the pleasure of thrashing the pig as “equivalent
o a salary.’
The stipulation in the announcement we have quoted, that the lady
should be “of the Established, Church,” is quite characteristic of the
sort of thing, for we always find a little bit of religion dragged in at the
end, to tone down the unchristian complexion of the rest of the adver-
tisement. The probability, also, is, that the parties who are so anxious to
get a little piety thrown into the bargain with the *. education,
the French, the music, the German, the dancing, and all the rest of it,
are desirous that in return for the nothing a year which they pay their
Governess, their children should acquire a little of that religious prin-
ciple of which they themselves have been left destitute.
An uneducated parent is frequently heard to say, “Though I have not
much learning myself, I should wish my children to be well taught;"
and in the same spirit, no doubt, the advertiser of “no salary,” and
ofher hard uncharitable conditions, would be the first to demand
º: piety,” or a “religious turn of mind” in his poor victimised
overness.
A BLACKFRIARS BULL FIGHT.
IT is not necessary to travel to Spain in order to get an idea of a
Bullfight, for, on every Smithfield market day, there is a display of the
conflict of the Toreadores with real Bulls in the neighbourhood of Black-
friars. The vacant ground on each side of Chatham Place forms an
admirable arena, where there are frequent contests between the Toro
and the Picadore—the Bull and the drover. A few days ago there
was a splendid exhibition, of human prowess on one side, and brute
instinct on the other-with a spice of canine sagacity superadded, to
give it a flavour. An active, bullock had been playing “Mag’s diver-
sion,” with a horn accompaniment all the way down Farringdon Street,
and had been indulging his facetious humour at the expense of the
public, by butting at and making a butt of everybody he met ; when
suddenly the drover made a blow at the animal's butt-end, and the poor
creature with a marvellous instinct of self-preservation, turned into a
neighbouring house, which proved to be the Cattle Insurance Company.
The clerk in attendance thought at first that the animal had come
with the view of effecting an insurance on his own life, and had almost
presented him with one of the usual forms, when, the bullock uncere-
unoniously upset everything in the shape of form by tossing over a
bench that happened to be in his way, and making for the board-room
with frightful velocity. The poor brute was a good deal flurried, and
he had no opportunity of turning himself round, for the space would
nºt admit of the operation, and the only way left him was to back out
of the difficulty in which he had placed º This was a most dis-
g|chased, and set above the new House of Lords.
agreeable alternative, for there were two or three drovers' dogs
attempting to make a luncheon off ox-tail. The drovers did their
utmost to keep possession of the poor creature by holding him in
tail, but he evidently objected to this new style of drawback on British
beef, and the more they pulled him one way, the more he tugged the
other. Though he was anything but reserved or shy, the difficulty
in drawing him out was tremendous, though the clerks attempted by
persuasion to convince him that his departure from the Insurance Office
would be the very best policy. The poor animal was ultimately ejected,
and it is not surprising that he was very much put out in consequence.
SELF-EXHIBITION OF LORD BROUGHAM IN 1850.
PUNCH has to propose to the workers of tin, iron, or brass of all
nations, to send a specimen of the Weathercock. BROUGHAM to the
great industrial show of 1851. It is, we think, difficult to conceive a
more suggestive subject for the matter proposed; one more provocative
of the inventive quality of designers; more certain to call forth the
latent resources of mechanics, conjointly in the variety of form, and in
the ease and rapidity, with which a weathercock should obey “every
little wind that under heaven is blown.”
The prize weathercock—the thing, from its peculiar complexity, is
worth at least a thousand pounds; indeed, how many national weather-
vanes have cost a hundred times the sum º be paid for, pur-
--- - - - - This would at once
be a utility to the building, and a compliment to LoRD BRough AM.
Like the DUKE OF WELLINGTON, his Lordship would anticipate post-
humous honours and enjoy his significant monument whilst in the #.
nd LQRD BROUGHAM has, a thousand times over, earned such
testimonial. His last—at least, at the time we write, his last—un-
conscious effort for such reward was in the House, when he discoursed
upon the promised Exhibition of 1851. Now, it may be remembered—
especially by those capable of recollecting every new pattern produced
by every new shake of a kaleidoscope—what LöRD BRough AM uttered
at the º Westminster gathering in favour of the future show. “It
would be a marvellous exhibition T. We should astonish the foreigner;
amaze him! Not only amaze all aliens with evidences of our manufac.
turing and mechanical skill; but, moreover, should confound, and
humiliate them by exhibiting a specimen of the special constable's
staff, garlanded with civic oak-leaves, date, “April 10, 1848. This,
among other things we should do, and great would be the agglomerate
glory thereof. , His Lordship deeply pitied the crassitude of any man
who could doubt it!” -
And now the wind shifts, and the weathercockpoints to an ill-wind—
an east-wind—that cuts as with a rusty knife the blossoms of hope 1
In the House of Lords, LoRD BRough AM last week discoursed of the
Exhibition. As for the English manufacturers, they would—
“No doubt, learn something whereby to improve the fabric of their manufactures.
They would not, however, increase the price of their commodities and manufactures.
No, no; down, down, down, would come the prices;–and so much the better would it be
for us the consumers, and ultimately no doubtfor themselves. They would not, however,
find this so sweet in the taste as it was in the prospect.”
£very word of this might have acted as another button upon the
breeches' pocket of manufacturers and tradesmen; shutting up the sub-
scriptions that otherwise would have come forth. We say, “might
have aeted,” had the orator's turnings and shiftings been less notorious.
The words, however, are harmless. No one predicts from the weather-
cock of to-day what point the wind may blow from to-morrow.
LoRD BRough AM protested against the erection of the required
building in either of the West-end parks. “In Hyde Park it certainly
must not be.” There was, however, an eastern park. “He thought
that the building had better be erected in Victoria Park.” This sug-
gestion brought up, of course, the whilom genius of Woods and Forests,
and especial protector of the poor man’s “bit of green” at all times,
the EARL OF CARLISLE.
“He could not see any reason why their lordships should be more tender to the aris-
tocratical lungs of one portion of the metropolis than they were to those of the densely-
populated district in the neighbourhood of Victoria Park.”
Why, no. And then folks who drive in Hyde Park, may drive a little
further from London; and, we believe that none of the weavers and
spinners of Spitalfieldskeep carriages. Indeed, we almost incline to doubt
whether they can vindicate their respectability even in a Sunday gig.
The West-end parks—quoted Lord Brough AM—“have been called
the lungs of the metropolis.” But, then, it is otherwise with Park
Victoria. Spitalfields having little use for the belly, can the less regard
a “tubercle” on the lungs.
TEMPERANCE TOAST.
THE papers state that at the anniversary festival of the Marine
Society, after dinner “the usual round of toasts was given..., FATHER
Mathew himself could hardly object to toasts in the form of the round.
If the toast of the evening was buttered, it is not likely that any
member of the Marine Society got half seas over.

An expedition has beenformed, of some six hardy individuals,toventure

last session, and has not been seen since.
The intention is to set out on the very day that Parliament opened.
There is an immense tract of barren debates for the expedition to cross,
and it is confidently asserted that it will never be able to get half-way
through it. If any trace is found of him, intimation is instantly to be
sent to the House of Commons.
The expedition has our best wishes for its success, though we cannot
help having our fears as to the result.

venture in search of such an object? How will they finda passage through
immense blocks of speeches, that seem as if they must crush the person
who comes near them. The six individuals, we are told, are to relieve one
another, and never more than three persons are to sleep at the same
time. This arrangement is highly commendable; still, if the torpor
should be too much for their hardy natures, and they should all six
give way to the feeling of overpowering lassitude that is known to
attack every one who ventures in those frozen regions, it is horrible to
think of what must inevitably be their sad fates! We implore this

BRITANNIA'S SWEET TOOTH.
I’m the Genius of BRITANNIA, and, you know, Irule the waves,
And I form'd a resolution to put down the trade in slaves,
So I've fitted out a squadron, and it costs me very dear,
At the lowest computation full a million pounds a year.
Yet the slave-trade I’m maintaining all the while I’gainst it fight,
I º it with the left hand whilst Istrike it with the right;
Qf slave-grown sugar, being cheap, a vast amount I eat,
I have such a tender conscience, but a tooth so very sweet! -
Goose's liver is a dainty certain foreigners derive,
So I have heard, from roasting the unhappy goose alive;
# laws with punishment condign would visit any wretch
Who dared the culinary art so cruelly to stretch. "…
But were I the chief consumer of the fruit of this abuse,
I should surely be partaker in the torture of the goose:
Am I not then an accomplice in the wickedness and shame
Oflashing into sugar the tormented negro's frame?
There is negro in our puddings, in our pies, our cakes, our buns;
In our jellies, creams, and custards, there are ADAM's sable sons;
There’s negro in each cup of tea the smug precisian sips
And thinks that he has done no wrong, and wipes his holy lips.
I am certain that the trade in slaves my cruisers scarcely touch,
Irepress it very little, and promote it very much: , -
If I mean that it should cease, I must renounce my toothsome sin,
Resolv'd from this time forth to take no slave-grown sugar in. . .
But I can't resign cheap sugar; so I’ll keep up my blockade,
For º: sake-by way of demonstration and parade;
Though I must confess I’d rather not beforced to spend the sum
Of a million pounds per annum to maintain a costly hum.

Sacrifice Extraordinary.
A NewsPAPER advertisement announces that
“A professional gentleman is instructed to sacrifice Three young sound Honses

perhaps: for when a * marries he is sometimes forced to give
up his stud.

And this re-
port is accom-
panied with a
sadness, with a
faintness of

ing, is still gra-
velled for a re-
medy. How is the nuisance to be abated? By what means of flushing—

of CURTIUs, and leap into the ever-open, ever-widening gulf f ill
all the societies, united for early closing, endeavour a remedy? For
ourselves, we can only hit upon one poor chance of success, the applica-
tion of neglect...When LUTHER was spiritually sublimed, wrought by
the greatness of his work, he heard, he tells us, a mighty noise in the
next room. “But,” said he with an after-thought, “knowing it was
only the devil, I took no notice of him; for there is nothing that so
irks the devil as contempt.” Will the newspaper press henceforth
perform the part of LUTHER to FERRAND, the foul-mouthed and vocife-
rous? Will they, for all future time, take mercy upon their readers, by
taking no notice of the noisy man, whose last bluster was at the town
of Ponteſract? We hope so.
However, the press, having unwarily printed MR. FERRAND's brag,
it becomes the uneasy duty of Punch to disburse a few words upon it.
Punch will linger no longer on the matter than he holds to be barely
necessary; for Punch likes not the reek of the FERRAND nosegay; his
flowers of rhetoric are truly flower of brimstone. And so, with a
closed, nostril, putting aside the bunch of noisome epithets culled
for political opponents, come we to the FERRAND remedy; and the
remedy is—the sheep.
| MR. FERRAND preaches a Wool League. The Fleece versus the
| Cotton Tree' MR. FERRAND makes the sheep the symbol of England's
regºneration. Having shorn it, and spun the wool into the agricultural
uniform, he would, no doubt, stretch its parchment into drum-heads,
and beat dismay through the streets of Manchester. Who would have
thought it? The tall cotton chimnies, levelled with a thundering crash
to the earth, pulled down by a line of worsted! What a politic spider
is FERRAND, and with his woollen web, how he will catch and fatten on
those gilded flies, BRIGHT and CoBDEN |
The tedious monotony of the time will be pleasantly, hilariously
broken by the two parties, into which all England will—hints FERRAND
—immediately divide itself. The fight will be a contest of worsted balls
and cotton balls! And the contest will be the fiercer, the richer, too, in
interesting episodes, inasmuch as the principal combatants will be of
the softer, and, therefore, more pugnacious sex. Every other woman
will bear a flag of worsted—will fight under her own particular banner!
“At present,” mourns FERRAND, “it is cotton above—cotton below—
and cotton everywhere.” Wait awhile; and inevitably the cotton will
be worsted.
Plain-minded people may vainly seek the source of inspiration whence
FERRAND drew this deep and beautiful idea. Punch—who knows every.
thing—can at once reveal the oracle that instructed the patijoti, Was
nothing less than a sheep's head. Fit teacher, fit pupil' It is a well-
accredited story, that MAHOMET-who, like all truly great men, was
beautifully simple in his fastes—much admired shoulder of mutton;
| a dish, by the way, delighted in by another great man, who, however,
was not a prophet—GeoRGE THE THIRD, the Father and Farmer of his
}. Well, MAHOMET, says the legend, was about to partake of his
avourite dish, and had made the first prime incision, when the yawning
shoulder found a voice, and cried—“Beware, O prophet ! For I, your
much-loved joint, am poisoned. Eat me, and you die.” Thus it was
that destiny made vocal even a shoulder ºf mutton to preserve the man,
chosen and beloved by fate.
And so it was with prophet FERRAND. It was at the end of the
second week of March, when FERRAND-hungry from contemplation,
deep and keen, of his country's wrongs—sat down to dinner. Great
men, we have already said it, have simple tastes....The dish best-beloved
by Fernand is sheep's head; sheep's, head, with its buttered brains.
Of these brains—innocent nutriment l–FERRAND, by way of preface,
partook; and was about to flesh his carving-knife in the h itself,
when the jaws opened, and—(wonderful to report' with the tongue
lying in a separate plate)—the head spoke audibly thus—“Honey-
mouthed FERRAND, dear to clods and men! Take what I need, and
with it spin a yarn, yea, many #. and save your mother-land. You
shall go forth in your armour of hose, and win. Accept this as a happy
omen—I speak without brains; be worthy of your oracle.” -
Whereupon, after much self-preparation, FERRAND went to Ponte-
fract, and, first sweetening his mouth with indigenous liquorice, he
then preached the Wool League; he then and there enacted the part
battle-cry—was “BAA-A,” a word to be worked in blood-coloured
worsted on the banner of the farmers—a word at once to float above
and doom the “topless” chimmies of Manchester!
All this is vast and comprehensive, but this—the great wool question
—admits of a still deeper consideration; of treatment, dee
the NERI and the BIANCHI will be cast into oblivion by the deeds of
foreign twist... The bulletins will be of marked and curious interest.
It will be delightful, sustaining, to read of houses invested by the
then hung out of the garret window, in token of parley; the enem
being at 1-ngth permitted to march out with just one pocket-hand-
kerchief flying, symbolical of his sorrow and discomfiture.
All this, we say, will be very delightſul, and the really patriotic heart
glows even by anticipation; but, there is yet another glory for wool; a
glory, it is true, . by yew and cypress—for it is a glory of the
churchyard. Let the law—the law most shamefully repealed—be re-
enacted, making it compulsory upon the dead—for an Act of Par-
liament is all potent, think some folks, even on the other side of Styx
—to be buried in home-grown wool; in staple flannel as our grand-
fathers were, so that even in the grave we shall henceforth defy the
foreigner, and not be made, as now, unpatriotic in our coffins, crumbling,
shamefully crumbling, in imported cotton. Then the country church-
patriotism. For whilst the great public moralist, with clouded eye on
tombstones, reads the swift decay of all things, his ear is pleasantly
smitten by the sheep-bell, and he sees the wether and the ewes biting
and expanding with the view and thought—he thinks with pleasure of
the wool above the grave, and the wool within it. As it is, we feel
sider even a country churchyard desecrated by the under-crop of
foreign yarn. e, have now no such poetry as GRAY's Elegy

“More dead than alive, I took my darling children out of the place,
and tenderly embraced them when I was out of the door.
“The Haidorama is next by, and my dear little third grandchild
insisted upon seeing it. Sir, we unsuspecting, ones went into the
place, and saw, what i. you think?—the Earthquake of Lisbon' Ships
were tossed and dashed about the river before us in a frightful manner.
Convents and castles toppled down before our eyes, and burst into
flames. We heard the shrieks of the mariners in the storm, the groans
of the miserable people being swallowed up or smashed in the rocking
reeling ruins—tremendous darkness, lurid lightning flashes, and the
awful booming of thunderbolts roared in our ears, dazzled our eyes,
and frightened our senses so, that I protest I was more dead than alive
when ſquitted the premises, and don't know how I found myself in my
Carriage.
“We were then driven to the Zoological Gardens, a place which I
often like to visit (keeping away from the larger beasts, such as the
bears, who I often fancy may jump from their poles upon certain unof.
fending Christians; and the howling tigers and lions who are continu-
|ally biting the keepers' heads off), and where I like, to look at the
| monkies in the cages (the little rascals') and the birds of various
plumage.
“Fancy my feelings, Sir, when I saw, in these gardens—in these
gardens frequented by nursery-maids, mothers, and children, an immense
rute of an elephant about a hundred feet high rushing about with a
wretched little child on his back, and a single man vainly endeavouring
to keep him " I uttered a shriek—I called my dear children round
about me. And I am not ashamed to confess it, Sir, Iran. Iran for
refuge into a building hard by, where. I saw-Ah, Sir! I saw, an
immense boa consºrictor swallowing a live rabbit—swallowing a live
rabbit, Sir, and looking as if he would have swallowed one of my little
boys afterwards. Good Heavens ! Sir, do we live in a Christian

these :

the interior of the building. Sir, it is like the entrance to the that, rather than be left alone in that gallery at night with, those
Eleusinian mysteries, or what I have been given to understand is statues, I would consent to be locked up with one of the hºrid lions
such a profound darkness, that my darling ANNA MARIA instantly
began to cry. We felt we were in a chamber, Sir, dimly creak-
ing and moving underneath us–a horrid sensation of sea-sickness
and terror overcame us, and I was almost as frightened as my poor
innocent ANNA MARLA.
“The first thing we saw was a ghastly view of a church—the
Cathedral of Saint Sepulchre's, at Jericho, I believe it was called—a
dreary pile, with not a soul in it, not so much as a pew-opener or
verger to whom one could look for refuge from the solitude of the
dismal. Sir, I don’t care to own I am frightened at being in a church
alone; I was once locked up in one at the age of thirteen, having
fallen asleep during the sermon, and though I have never seen a ghost,
they are in my family; my grandmother saw one.
with epitaphs and death's heads, and I own that I thought a walk in
the Park would have been more cheerful than this.
“As we looked at the picture, the dreary church, became more
dreary; ſhe shadows of night (by means of curtains and contrivances,
which iheard in the back part of the mystery making an awful flapping
and pulling) fell deeply and more terribly on the scene. It grew pitch
dark; my poor little ones clung convulsively to my knees; an organ
£ommenced playing a dead march—it was midnight—tapers presently
began to flicker in the darkness—the organ to moan more dismally-
and suddenly, by a hideous optical delusion, the church was made to
appear as if full of people, the altar was lighted up with a mortuary
illumination, and the dreadful monks were in their stalls.
“I have been in churches... I have thought the sermon long. Inever
thought the real service so long as ... one which I witnessed
aſ the Tenebrorama... My dear children whispered, ‘Take us out of this
place, Grandpapa. I would have done so. I started to get up-(the
place bi ing now dimly visible to our eyes, accustomed to the darkness,
and disclosing two other wretches looking on in the twilight besides our.
selves)—I started, I say, to get up, when the chamber began to move
again, and I sank back on my seat, not daring to stir.
“The next view we saw was the Summit of Mount Ararat, I believe,
or else of a mountain in Switzerland, just before dawn. I can’t bear
looking down from mountains or heights; when taken to St. Paul's by
my dear mother, as a child, I had well-nigh fainted when brought
out intº the outer gallery; and this view of Mount Ararat is so dreadful,
so lonely, so like nature, that it was all I could do to prevent myself
from dashing down the peak and plunging into the º: below. A
storm, the thunderous rumble of which made me run cold, the fall of
an avalanche destroying a village, some lightning, and an eclipse I
believe of the sun, were introduced as ornaments to this picture, which
| I would as lief see again as undergo a nightmare.

Children looking as if they all had the yellow fever—sights enough to
terrify any Christian I should think—sights which, nevertheless, as a
man and a grandfather, I did not mind undergoing.
| “But my second boy, ToMMY, a prying little dare-devil, full of mis-
chief, must insist upon our going to what he called the reserved apart-
ment, where NApoleon's carriage was, he said, and other curiosities.
Sir, he caused me to pay sixpences for all the party, and introduced me
to what?—to the CHAMBER of HoRRoRs, Sir!—they’re not ashamed to
call it so—they’re proud of the frightful title and the dreadful exhibition

you ever seen a simoom, Sir? Can you figure to yourself what a simoomis?
—a tornado of sand in which you die before you can say Jack Robinson,
in which camels, horses, men, are swept into death in an instant—and
this was the agreeable sight which, as a parent and a man, I was called

I quited Waterloo Place, and having treated the dear £iº. to a few
buns in the Hawmarket, conducted them to their last place of amuse-
ment, viz., the Panorama, in Leicester Place.
“Ah, Sir! of what clay are mortals supposed to be made, that they can

to own I pºpped down the curtain after one single peep, and would not

A BEAUTIFUL LEASE,

brought before Parliament;
* LoBD SMERE having
* been charged with a desire
to obstruct the eye-sight of
– the public, # erectlng a
: wall. LORD RussBLL came
: to the rescue; and he said
: the wall was a very low wall,
and—
“Although Lond ELLEsm RRE's
tº lease contained a clause prohibiting
L = the building of a wall, there was no
E covenant in it which prevented the
: raising of a mound, and therefore,
: if the Government were to insist
: upon the stringent enforcement of
the terms of the lease with respect
to the wall, LohD ELLEsmertº
might be driven to raise a mound,
which he could carry as high as he
- pleased.”
: , How beautifully must, a
lease be drawn, with what a
perfect mastery and enjºy-
ment of chicane must a
cument be set, forth, that
“prohibits the building of a
wall,” but does not prevent
. ... “the raising of a mound !”
The wisdom of the Crown grantors in this case is worthy of Bottom's
best acting of Wall itself, even after Bottom's longer ears were on!

The man was, by verdict, returned of unsound mind; and the only
reason that has induced Punch to advert to the matter is, to put it to
the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequen whether, as a Chancellor and a

abovenamed received by him, to the funds of Bedlam P. We trust Šm.

“PAY ready money for evervthing you have, and you’ll never get

If this is true with regard to private individuals, how much truer it
must be when applied to Governments ... Would England be owing her
National Debt at the present moment, if she had always gone upon the
system of ready money? If we had our way, no country should go to
war till it had money sufficient to pay all the expenses. This plan, if
enforced generally amongst all nations, would tend more to the abolition

WERY POOR. SCHOLARS.
THE following advertisement
-to say nothing of its inverted
in a Scotch periodical:—
SCHOLASTIC ESTABLISHMENT, No.
RS. AND Co. have the honour to call the attention of Palents and
Guardians to their List of GOVERNESSES for the present season, which far
surpass in “solidity and finish" of Education “any they have ever yet had.” Some tho-
roughly educated Frenchwomen, English and Scotch of the “first order,” besides some
“Excellent Day Governesses,” which, with their usual “care” and “promptitude,” they
will be happy to supply families “Gratuitously.”
We were not previously aware, that “solidity” of a “surpassing”
order is looked upon as a desirable quality in a Governess. We can,
however, understand that, where starvaſion prices are paid, a Governess
with its italics and its inverted commas
grammar-appeared just as we give it,
with “a lean and hungry look” would be avoided, as likely to betray
the meanness of the employer, and that a lady, therefore, with a large
capital of fat to begin upon, which would take a good deal of bringing
down in a stingy family, might be more likely to suit than one of,
physically speaking, “more slender pretensions.”
The wording of the advertisement issued from the Scholastic Esta-
blishment seems to indicate that all the learning is sent out so rapidly
that there is none left for ordinary use on the premises. As to Syntax,
the stock is i. * exhausted, and we almost wonder that there
y left on hand to supply the spelling of even a short
advertisement. We should be glad to see some of those “thoroughly
educated Frenchwomen, English and Scotch of the first order,” who,
no doubt, belong to the class of citizers of the world, and are thus qua-
lified to be described as, at the same time, French, English, and Scotch,
by the directors of the Scholastic Establishment. The concluding
portion of the advertisement, announcing some “excellent Day
Governesses, which, with their usual care, and promptitude, they will
be happy to supply families gratuitously,” is rather mysterious. Whose
“care and promptitude” are intended to be indicated, and if it is the
“care” of the advertisers, what is meant by supplying a Governess with
“care”—as if the expression alluded to some article requiring caution
in the packing * “Gratuitously,” too, is a word that adds to our diffi-
culty, for though there is a great deal of competition among the unfor-
tunate class, we have not heard that they have commenced the practice
that used to be common in the old opposition coaching days, and that
they are trying to run each other off the road to j. by taking
pupils for nothing. -
Altogether, the advertisement we have quoted is a specimen of the
fact that too much cheapness will effect its own cure, for we venture to
assert that any one really in want of education, even of the plainest
kind, for his children, will not, if he can appreciate the first chapter of
the Grammar, seek the article he requires in 2the Scotch “Scholastic
Establishment.”
The World’s “Multum in Parvo.”
We are told that a Company is on foot for the purpose of buying
up LoRD BRough AM., The object of the purchase is to send in the
#. Lord at the forthcoming Exhibition of 1851. With his Lordship
the Company feels sure of winning the great prize, as there is scarcely
a thing that he does not know something of; and if they can only keep
him from talking, they feel persuaded they can palm him off as the
most wonderful specimen of #. industry. ...We are sorely afraid,
however, that the Company, let it have the wealth of California added
even to that of Monte-Christo, must be ruined, if it is compelled to
take Lord BROUGHAM at his own valuation.
DREADrui, COMPLAINT OF ONE OF THE LUNGS OF THE METROPOLIS.
LoRD DUNCAN complains of encroachments upon the Green Park.
If these encroachments are allow nd they are very likely to increase,
since it appears that the Officers of the Woods and Forests do not
know the boundaries of the property they are supposed to have the care
of-there will soon be no Park left-and the spot it formerly occupied
will be known in history as the “Invisible:GREEN PARK.”
The METROPOLITAN WATER-BUTT.
THE noble EARL of CARLISLE presented a petition “from the parish
of Christ Church, Spitalfields, complaining of the supply of water to the
metropolis.” If the petitioners complain of the supply, of water to
Spitalfields, we are sure they can have very little to complain of.

THE SIAMESE OR DOUBLE BROUGHAM.
A-BRIDGE-MENT OF ENGLISH GEOGRAPHY.
You would imagine that Louis NAPOLEoN, from the time he had
been in England, would know something about English º: and
yet in one of the recent numbers of Le Napoléon, of which he is the
reputed editor or sub-editor, there appears the following mistake:-
“Over the Straits of Menai and Bangor, between England and Ireland, there runs a
suspension bridge, &c.”
This is not so bad to start with, but the mistakes grow thicker and
thicker as the article gets longer, till at last we are told that the
object of the new tubular bridge is nothing less than to
*Joindre le sol d'Irlande & celui de la métropole.”
And the remainder of the article proves that one end of the tubular
bridge is supported on the English coast, and the other on the Irish.
We are sure that MR. STEPHENson will be astonished to hear this, and
will rejoice that his reputation rests upon a more solid foundation than
the bridge in the article in the Napoléon. It is just as absurd as if,
talking of the PRESIDENT of THE REPUBLIc, we were to say,
“It jointles talents de son Oncle & ceux qu'il possede lui-même.”
The stretch in the one instance would be no greater than in the
other. The probability is, that the author of the above, rich mistake
had been reading some highly poetical leading, article, about the
“tubular bridge connecting England and Ireland in the closest links
together,” and that he had taken it all literally... It is only a pity that
the Bull did not make its appearance a little earlier, for, from its size,
it might have figured grandly in the Carnival as the Baeuf-Gras.
“Now Ready.”
Realy Money! One of the greatest difficulties of life is that Ready
Money! It never is ready when you want it! It is like a woman
who says she is “perfectly ready,” and then runs up stairs to get her
gloves, or handkerchief, or card-case, or something. You wait ten
minutes, half-an-hour, till at last, tired of waiting, yow, go without her.
So it is with Ready Money! I have waited for it so long—all my life
I may say—that now I go without it.—Young Rapid, at present on a
visit to the Queen's Bench.
THE INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS.
THE great gathering of 1851 is not specifically appointed to include
living productions, but we have, nevertheless, heard of a few that will
most assuredly present themselves. The French will contribute a good
sprinkling of their chevaliers d’industrie, and the rural districts of
£ngland will send up their full quota of raw material to be dealt with
or done—as raw materialis generally doomed to be.
We may perhaps be excused for suggesting a few animated subjects
that might be added to the exhibition without fear of over-crowding,
as the specimens of the articles we are about to name would be limited
by their exceeding rarity.
A man born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
A ditto made of nine tailors.
A ditto who has dined with DUKE HUMPHREY.
A governess who has been willing to accept, instead of remuneration,
| a comfortable home, and who has found the consideration realised.
A young gentleman who has been liberally boarded and well educated
for 16 guineas per annum.
Somebody who has found something to his advantage after having
heard of it from Joseph Apy,
The laughing eye with the light in it. .
A man with all his best feelings possessing him.
THE WOODEN WALLS AND THE WOODEN HEADS OF.
ENGLAND..
THE sale of old naval stores in 1849 amounted to £42,403.
The sale of old ships amounted to £2.9ll.
The latter item, we think, is insignificantly small, considering what
a perfect hand-first chop, we may say—the Admiralty is in building
ships, and cutting them up again. It would not be a bad speculation,
by the bye, to open a little store shop next door to the Admiralty, where
the new ships might be sold in penny bundles of firewood, and boxes of
lucifer-matches. An ELLIoTT (if there is one left unemployed) should
be put at the head of the establishment, and a little black doll, in the
shape of ELLENBoRough or MINTo, might be suspended over the
doorway, so as to attract the notice of SIR WILLIAM SYMonds, and
the other Government ship-breakers. Over the portico should be
written, in the peculiar rag-and-bottle kind of long spidery letters,
the following board:—
THIs Is THE CHEAP ORIGINAL MARINE STORE SHop.
N.B. Best Price given for Newly Launched Men-of-War.
EXHIBITION OF IDLENESS.
LoRD BRough AM objects to Hyde Park as the site for the proposed
Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations. It is but fair, however, that
Industry should compete with its opposite on the latter's own ground.
For along series of years, from February to August, there has been
held, in the Ring of Hyde Park, a daily Exhibition of idleness. The
Industry of all Kºi... may afford a lessonto the Idleness of one. It
must not be supposed, however, that our lounging fashionables and lazy
footmen ſº the sole criterion of our national Idleness. To form an
adequate idea of that quality, it is necessary to take into account our
defective drainage, putrescent Thames, thirty thousand starving needle-
women, and multitudinous rogues; the stupendous result of inattention,
indifference, and indolence.
Mr. Ferrand's Real Substitute for the Corn-Law Fleece:
MR. W. B. FERRAND, at the Pontefract Protectionist Meeting last
week, is reported to have made the following proposition for the relief
of agriculture:-
“Let the farmers of Great Britain and Ireland enter into a wool league, and vow
they will never again wear cotton, if they can be provided with linen or woollen *
and in two years the cotton-spinners of Lancashire will compound. (Loud cheers.)"
To this suggestion of MR. FERRAND's there is little doubt that the
farmers will stop their ears—with cotton itself.

THE BACHELORS’
LEAGUE.
Y many highly re-
spectable unmar-
ried men, it has
long been felt as
a great grievance,
that they should
be liable to certain
very heavy duties,
and in order to
release themselves
from these duties,
a league has been
formed by a batch
of bachelors. A
friend, whose sin-
gleness of purpose
consists of a pur.
pose to remain
single as long as
he can, has ſa-
voured us with a
glance at a few of
the rules laid down
for the guidance
of the League of
- Bachelors.
1st: Every, bachelor joining the League is to cancel all previous engagemen's.
2nd. Every bachelor having subscribed for five years to the League, and who, by misfortune,
shall have incurred a matrimonial engagement, shall be defended against any acion for
breach of promise, and thus saved from the shame and misery of going through the Court of
Hymen, º is too frequently another name for the Insolvent Court.
3rd. Connected with the League it is intended to establish a Bachelors' Insurance
Office, to insure single men against marriage and flirtation, on the same principles as are
usually applied to death and fire. ...Any member having visited wilfully a house with more than
- in the event of the calamity of narriage befalling
as felo de se, and his policy will be viliated on account of
the very bad policy that will have guided him. Any bachelor falling-into matrimony—by
his own hand, as in the case of a written promise to wed, will be deprived of all the benefits
of his insurance, and every applicant proposing to be insured must answer the following
questions, among others that will be propos. d to him:—
What is your age next birthday?
At what age had your father the misfortune to marry your mother?
ave you been afflicted with the Polka or other mania? are you subject to sentimental
fits f have you been addicted to the writing of sonnets? or have you ever suffered from the
cacoethes scribendi in any shape, or at any time whatever ?
Have you at any time in your life been a victim to the flute, or any other deadly-lively
instrument P
Have any of your near relations fallen in love at any time, and if so, have they recovered,
or have their cases ended fatally?
f these questions are | answered in a satisfactory manner, any member of the
Bachelors' League may insure any amount under £5000, to be paid within three months of
the melancholy termination of his single career, on proof of wedlock having actually
overtaken him.
The Insurance against flirtation or fire cannot be effected where the applicant is more than
ordinarily inflammable, and watering-places in the season, balls, and pic-nic parties must be
considered as doubly or trebly hazardous, and charged accordingly.
t moral engine will be kept on the premises, so that, in case of an alarm of fire, any
A
member may have cold water thrown upon him without extra premium.
MEANNESS REWARDED.
“A MECHANIC,” describing himself as a foreman in an extensive establishment, related,
in a letter, which appeared last week in the Times, the following satisfactory instance of
proper spirit on the part of his fellow-workmen. He and they, whose numbers amounted to
nearly 200 men, had raised a general subscription for the purpose of taking their wives
and families a trip by railway to the sea-coast on Good Friday, and returning on Easter
Monday, or Tuesday. The railway directors, it might have been supposed, would have
been willing to enlarge their usual accommodation of return tickets to these poor people,
if but as a piece of seasonable benevolence,—an Easter offering of charity. Forget'ing, how-
ever, all such, Easter dues, those gentlemen contraced instead of extending their ordinary
| liberality in this respect, and made the return tickets available for one day only. . The men
indignantly “revolted” at this “shameful imposition,
” and their excursion scheme was
abandoned; a circumstance to be regretted only on account of the good folks' loss of a
holiday. A weightier loss, we rejoice to say, was sustained by the railway companies, who
were the losers of about £75 from “A Mechanic’s” shop alone. By this system of “ quick
returns,” then, the railway companies are likely to make appropriately “small profits,” and
Wre º a continually decreasing income will be the reward of their perseverance in so
mean a line.
THE MILITARY BILLY TAILOR.
BILLY TAILOR was a poor young fellow,
Well nigh starved as he could be;
And his wrongs he did diskiver
To a Public fair and free.

Says they, "Wot kind of trade's this here?”
Says SIDNEY, “'Tis the trade of a gallant warrior,
Who buys so cheap, and who sells so dear.”
Fiddeloldiday, &c.
“If 'tis the trade of a gallant warrior,
Tell unto us his rank, we pray.”
“His rank, kind friends, is that of Colonel,
Who by clothing ; his pay.”
Fiddeloldiday, &c.
“If as he gets his pay by clothing,
That’s a way both mean and near,
Get up early some fine morning,

Early as by break of day,

WICES OF SPEECH.
THE contemplated abolition of the Irish Vice-
royalty has furnished a fruitful theme for com-
ment in the would-be jocular circles. Some do
not scruple to affirm that the Government will
rival FATHER MATHEw in the glory of having
suppressed the National Vice of Ireland. Others
[. so far as to say that the Irish will be no
onger able to complain of being impoverished
by this º, when they cease to be under the
screw of an English Vice. Some, again
rash enough to predict that, when Ireland has
no longer a Viceroy, her present lamentable con-
dition will be quite vice versä. A few have
had the desperation_to affirm, that the “golden
round” of Irish Vice-Sovereignty has been
nothing else than a vicious circle. Justice, how-
ever, compels us to state, that, in none of these
playful liberties taken with words, has anything
been intended in disparagement of the present
Lord-Lieutenant, whose vice-regal career, durin
the most trying vicissitudes, is allowed on
hands to have been perfectly unvitiated.

(From our own Correspondent, Belgravia, March 28.)
HERE I am, as poor SINCLAIR used to say in Harry Bertram, “like
love among the roses.” This is not a mere façon de parler with me, I
can assure you, when, between four and six in the afternoon, I take
my diurnal canter in Hyde, Park, amid the flowers of aristocratic
loveliness. “”Tis true.” slightly to vary a Byronic aphorism, “your
English Miss is very, charming,” and this is a truth that. I have of
late amply verified; º, or some weeks, the restrictions of the
weather office have, sadly interfered with the attractions of , the
Ring. N'importe: the ** air creates º and rushing
off to a petit diner with a few choice spirits at the Clarendon,
I indemnify myself for the manque of the ocular repast, by a more
substantial if less, sentimental banquet. The côtelettes à la Maintenon
here are very much de mon gré, but you would scarcely believe how
hard it is to get good potatoes. This reminds me that the Irish Viceroy
is to be abolished, as the national esculent was like to have been a year
or two ago—pardon this badinage—by the blight. I write currente
calamo, which must excuse abruptness of transition. HER MAJESTY
the QUEEN is “tol-lol;” she “showed” at Der Freischütz, the other
evening, accompanied by the PRINCE, who is getting rather popular.
The cares of state, seem to sit, lightly on Victoria, and AIRERT
appears perfectly at his ease, though having on his shoulders the
Industry of All Nations. In this pie, by the way, LoRD BRough AM,
of course, wanted to have his fingers; failing in which desire he has
been doing all, he can to bouleverser the concern, as was to be expected.
All the world is laughing at, the sparring-match which took place
between him and STANLEY in the Lords, with reference to the epithet
“volatile” applied to the noble and learned lord by the Hºir of
‘‘peppered” one another with much seeming bonhomie, exchanging,
however, some pretty hard raps, I can tell you. There are said to be
various novelties in preparation both at the two Operas and Houses of
Parliament; in the one and the other we shall see what we shall see.

meeting of these poor 'squires of the thimble the other day at the
London Tavern, ALDERMAN. SIDNEY ascribed their miserable plight in
a great, measure to the “grinding system” pursued by the “clothing
Colonels” who pick their pay out of soldiers' uniforms. The idea of
these gallant slop-sellers is très dróle, n'est ce pas ? The case of the
starving needlewomen is also becoming serious; as I cannot help
feeling rather strongly-not having eaten anything since lunch. Hey!

A “LATTER-DAY.” NIGHTMARE, BROUGHT ON BY READING THOMAS CARLYLE HIS PAMPHLETS.
RAGS WERSUS SOAP.
THE Bishop of ExETER is not, as it appears, to monopolise the
right and enjoyment of controversy. Rags are to have a share, dis-
puting for it with purple and fine i.e. The Chronicle—with some
weighty testimony upon its side—contends that the Ragged Schools
are, ſor the most part, little other than gatherings of the dirty, house-
less, and, by consequence, profligate young, for the benefit of shelter,
warmth, and co-operation. Parties for robbery are arranged under the
very eyes of the self-devoted teachers. From the school-room to the
street, to “catch” the unconscious victims “coming out of chapel,” is
an anxious but rapid transit occasionally made by the pickpocket pupils.
The good LoRD AsHLEY puts in a plea for the utility of the rag
academy; but, with a faintness of heart, a certain tone of despondency
that does not mightily assure one. ... His Lordship avows that the hope
of amended morals can be but small, when the children from their birth
have been creatures, of filth and squalor—human vermin, at once
society's reproach and danger. Teaching must begin at home. When
the home is the dry arch, the door-step, or, as a passing luxury, the
twopenny lodging-house—poor, indeed, is the harvest of the school-
master!, Cleanliness we take to be one of the best teachers—the
prime usher of the school for the poor. There was an old fashion that
went to bribe the brain of the learner by a subtle appeal to the learner's
stomach: the pupil ate and digested his A. B. C. in spicy gingerbread.
Why will not government place in the hands of the poor an alphabet of
another substance-namely, untaxed soap?' Truly, the first im-
portant syllable for the poor to learn, is W. A. S. H.
. A Rabid Propensity for Pence.
MR. John O'ConnELL is making a great noise about the Irish Vice-
Royalty being done away with. He need not be so alarmed, for, if that
Vice is removed, a greater one will still exist, for we have always con-
sidered the worst Vice of Ireland to be agitation, and that comes much
more home to him than the one at the Castle ever could or would. We
are afraid, also, that, as long as MR. JoHN O'CoNNELL continues to
make his miserable penny by it, it is a kind of Vice that will never
be abolished in Ireland.

WHEN the execution which SHERIFF PALMERSTON, by the agency of
his officer PARKER, at the suit of DAVID PACIFIco and another against
OTHo, King of Greece, has put into the Piraeus, shall have answered its
purpose, and either the demand of defendants shall have been discharged,
or the plaintiff’s masts and other sticks shall have been sold off for the
benefit of his creditors, our fifa squadron might perhaps be sent to levy
a distress upon the United States. There are little matters not yet

of piracy continues to be practised to a frightful extent by American
publishers, and ought to be checked, for the interest of literature, the
true glory of England. If this is not done, Rajah Punch must proceed

OWn res onsibility. For the present we leave this important matter in
the hands of Her Majesty's Sheriff for Foreign Affairs.

“I fear that this is no air-drawn dagger of mine, for a MR. CUBITT has, either by

THE SMOKE NUISANCE.
SIR,-You are aware that
you are a public cha-
racter, and, as such,
your personal ap-
pearance and habits
are necessarily the
subject of interest
and remark. I, my-
self, saw you the
other day quitting
ship Southampton,
with your pockets
crammed full of ci-
gars which CAPTAIN
MoRe AN had pre-
sented to you, and
you were seen pub-
licly smoking one of
them in the streets
of Gravesend after
you had taken leave
of the º Cap-
tain and his vessel.
Sir, you areasmoker.
I am another. I am
not ashamed of my
habit. I like it; I
uphold it: and I am
desirous that you
should defend it.
“In the Morning
Chronicle of last
Saturday, I. read a
leading article, in
which men who
smoke are called
“selfish” and “nasty’
—and are held up to
eneral reprobation
- - or their practice of
smoking upon railways, and, of course, leaving the odour of their cigars in
the carriages behind them. The Chronicle writer draws afearful picture
of the agonised discomfort of a lady disinclined to tobacco, and forced to
make a journey of a hundred miles in a carriage impregnated with its
fumes, and by the side of a gent who had been secretly smoking his
weed up to the time of the entrance of his fellow passenger.
“There is no doubt that it is unpleasant for a female disliking tobacco
to sit by a man's side who has just been consuming his cigar; but Sir, it is
also clear, that it is most unpleasant for a man to be interrupted in his
pastime. ... Each individual under the circumstances is worthy of a
genuine pity.
-- *. out of the question the epithets of ‘selfish' and, “nasty'em-
ployed by the Chronicler; who does not probably smoke himself. So
it is selfish to drink a glass of wine or to eat a luncheon at Swindon or
Wolverton-but it is natural: you do it because you are hungry or
thirsty, and because you like it. So it is selfish for Mrs. Muscadel to
perfume her pocket-handkerchief with that abominable scent,...to me a
thousand times more odious than the nice wholesome natural fragrance
which fondly lingers about a man's coat and whiskers after he has
enjoyed a cigar. There is no use in calling me names, and saying that
smoking is nasty. I intend to smoke: all Europe smokes: all the
world smokes:-Tobacco has conquered the world, and is, an esta:
blished fact of which it is as impossible to get rid as it would be to get
rid of railroads or to return to Protection.

THE EXHIBITION OF INDUSTRY.-A HINT.
PEACE waves her olive-branch, and summons round her,
Array of heads unhelmed, unweaponed hands;
Commerce, late lightened of the chains that bound her,
Speeds hitherwards the gifts of many lands.
Now, for the first time since the world was parted
By differing tongues, round Shinar's tower of old,
One nation, horny-handed, and strong-hearted,
The grasp of friendship out to all doth hold.
The giant, Industry, with mighty motion,
Stirs from Norwegian hills to far Cathay;
From island unto island of the ocean
He calls upon his sons, and they obey.
Hammers are falling, forges roaring free,
The wheels whirl round, the noisy shuttles rattle;
And far as ear can hear or eye can see,
The world’s astir with note of peaceful battle.
Mind wars with matter in a thousand forms
And conquers it, though ne'er so big or brave,
Till the wildlightning from its house of storms,
Descends to do man's errand, like a slave.
But while with pride such victories we hail,
And view their gathered trophies, let the thought
Pass from the labour to the labourer pale,
That on these miracles of skill hath wrought.
From out of gorgeous hues and fabrics rare
Let the gaunt weaver's face its lesson loºk, ,
And all that’s forged, or wove, or carven there,
Becomes a leaf of a portentous book-
Too often blurred with blood, blotted with tears,
With sin and sorrow writ, from rim tº rim ;
While they that ought to read, with selfish fears
Avert their eyes from of the record grim.
It is a palimpsest—fair-writ, beneath
The red and rugged lettering above,
Aresweetly-sounding ancient words, that breathe
Of brotherhood and peace, and joy and love.
God speed the time when from that volume's fagº,
Some reverent hand, with loving heart for guide,
Shall those distressful characters efface, -
And bring to light the blessings that they hide.

Doctor Johnson, as an extreme Tory and High Churchman, held
views generally in accordance with those of Angºlsº LAUD. Yet
nothing could be more utterly at variance with Johnson than the sub-
jºined passage in a letter of Laud's lately published by Sylvanus

“Yourlordship's otherleter made his maiestye and all els that sawe it lºngh, since

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HORN OF PLATT.
BRAss, it seems, is not invariably
profitable material, even
when traded upon in most
worshipful society. , Not al-
ways does a man blow his
own trumpet –(some men,
indeed, are not merely single
trumpets, but brass bands
complete)—to his own final
advantage. The case of MR.
PLATT–and few men have
made sweeter noises in the
world—is a powerful illus-
tration of the perils that
environ melodious brass.
MR. PLATT has grown old
upon his horn: and now—
“having lost, from great and
continual pressure, the whole
of his front teeth,” he seeks
to obtain some sort of pro-
vision by means of a concert
“to exempt him from the
sufferings of an indifferently
provided for old age. The horn,”—continues the Herald, in the kindest
spirit—“is an instrument by which but little can be accumulated,
however long the service.” In a word, the brass at a man's mouth,
however exquisite its utterance, cannot be as profitable, as the unseen
brass in a man's lungs—as the brass armour in a man’s cheek. The
QUEEN vouchsafes her sympathy to the poorer worker in brass;
PRINCE ALBERT patronises the blown-out musician, and many of the
nobility and gentry, touched by the recollection of MR. PLATT's art—
an art exercised for nearly thirty years—are pledged practically, to
manifest their grateful memory. This is as it should be, alike ho-
nourable to the people of gold and the veteran dealer in even more
musical metal; most musical, most unprofitable.
“Let the bright seraphim in burning row,
Their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow.”
In how many ears these words will awaken the echo of PLATT's horn
as its music soared, triumphing and dallying with its strength and
sweetness!. How it seemed to become vocally spiritualised; how it
sympathised with the singer in her highest flights: how it became like
a living thing, endowed with supernatural utterance. And at the
same time—“from great and continuous pressure”—the pressure that
gave forth the divine harmony, the front teeth of the musician were
paying their existence for the music—gradually giving themselves up
a ºn sacrifice to sweet sounds. Sounds purchased with growing
Canker.
, Has our friend, the reader, ever met with a little book—the auto-
º of poor EULENSTEIN ? In that thin, meagre-looking little
book, is a terrible human history. It was the evil destiny of EULEN-
STEIN to fall in love with—a jew's-harp. Passionately in love with
that most unpromising bit of iron. Day and might, he wooed the hard,
unyielding thing, and at length made it sing to him most exquisite
music; at length, he awakened in that twopenny-halfpenny instrument
-that pauper thing that some Jew in his most desperate poverty must
have first fashioned out of marine-store old iron—most marvellous
harmonies. The jew's-harp was no longer a schoolboy's organ of
Annoyance—a big bumble-bee grown hoarse—but something even for
MERCURy, with his tortoise lyre, to smile upon. This was a great
triumph for the enthusiast. In the most frightful poverty, he had fol.
lowed his passion; he had succeeded in his suit; he could touch the
harp, the jew's-harp, to his own will; he had made himself a name and
—he was toothless. The iron had entered his mouth; his sufferings
were terrible. He had put unthought-of melody into the metal, and
the iron had eaten its revenge.
And this, in a degree, is the fate of poor MR. PLATT. He has, for
thirty years, made crowds of hearts beat thick with his mastery of
metal; and—even if he had the fulness of fortune’s feast—he wants
the teeth to enjoy the repast. There is a meaning in this—a sad,
instructive meaning in the condition of a man, of genius—worth, at
least, the price of a concert ticket, should the price be even one pound
one shilling.
The QUEEN, the PRINCE, a royal duke, and so forth, will patronise
the old musician: no doubt many of the wise and good will contribute |t
to the fund sought to be raised for the worn-out artist. If, in addition
to these, the folks who have made their noisy way in the world,—not
with metallic brass, but with brass human,—if they, too, would contri-
bute a moderate offering, then would the fund be prosperously
increased. The Horn of PLATT would then be the Horn of Plenty.
SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF AN UNPROTECTED
FEMALE.
SHE HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH HER LEGAL ADVISER.
SCENE.-The Parlour in Coram Street. She has shown her Aunt’s Will
to her ATTORNEY, who has come by appointment to advise with her
wpon it.
Attorney (examining the Will, and other papers). Hm—hm—hm—yes.
It must be part of deceased legatee's estate—so it.will have to be
charged with the same legacy duty as a gift in his lifetime, and then,
you see, it will have to be included in the estate in the estimate for
paying probate duty thereon, and be chargeable again with legacy duty,
ecause, as you are aware, it’s liable to duty in TIMMINs's hands, to
whom the legatee left it by his will. That’s satisfactory.
Unprotected Female (whose breath and understanding have been sus-
pended during the above, heaving a long sigh). Yes—very—but I don’t
quite understand about it,
Attorney (buried in the papers *: and making infricate calculations
with a pencil). Good gracious ! You’ve paid too much probate duty.
Oh, my dear Madam—we must rectify this at once,
Unprotected Female. Oh-I’ve paid so many things—they told me to
—and I didn't understand it. [Dejectedly.
Attorney. Let’s see. (Calculating.) Yes, £18 4s. You’re entitled
&£18 4s. We must get your £18 4s. You’ll have no trouble
about it.
Unprotected Female (much relieved). Oh-indeed—what have I to do,
if you please?
Attorney. Why, you’ll have to go to the Legacy Duty Office—it’s
within the six months—and you must produce the probate, and make
your affidavit—of course, you must swear there was no intention of
fraud—ah—you can swear that before a Master in Chancery. -
Unprotected Female (bursting out). Oh-please don’t let me get into
Chancery—oh–now— -
Attorney (blandly). No-no–a Master ex-traordinary, for , taking
affidavits and acknowledgments of married women, my dear aul.
Unprotected Female. But I’m not a married woman—Sir- -
Attorney (correcting himself). No-no–anybody can swear an affidavit
before him: and then you must subjoin to the affidavit the inventory
and account—that you’ll subscribe.
Unprotected Female (under her breath, and in deep agony). Dear, dear!
How much will the subscription come to?
Attorney (cheerfully running on). No-no-your signature only. Then
we must have the appraisements and valuations duly stamped—and then,
my dear Madam, we shall go to the Head Office comfortably.
Unprotected Female. Oh-no–don’t let us go., I’d rather let them
keep the £184s. Oh, there are ever so many things to swear, and I
don’t understand it.
Attorney (encouragingly). Pooh, pooh! my dear Madam—a mere form.
Let’s see (thoughtfully), we must show the debts were due and payable
in law. (Sharply.) You’ve got vouchers for the payments?
Unprotected Female (claspirg her hands). Oh-what’s that ? I paid
them all their bills.
Attorney. But you took receipts and legal vouchers?
Unprotected Female. Oh-I think I did—but I don’t know what
vouchers are.
Attorney. There were those mortgages. Let’s see—we shall have to
produce the mortgage deeds. I forget. Had

Unprotected Female. Oh-how P I’m sure, I dare say it was, but I
don’t know. Why don’t you take 'em all yourself, and do it, and don’t
frighten one. -
Attorney. My dear Madam, you’re executrix, and we must be regular.
No judgment debts, I suppose -
Unprotected Female. Oh! what ever’s that?—do you think I know a
judgment debt when I see it P Do look in the papers.
Attorney. Because, if so, we must produce office copy, and entry of
satisfaction on record, of course.
Unprotected Female (stupidly). Yes—of course—but, oh, I wish you
wouldn’t. I don’t understand what you’re talking about. But I’d
rather let them keep the £184s.
Attorney. Then there are three legacies to the old servants—
h Unprotected Female (glad to show she CAN do something). Oh-I paid
em.
Attorney. I don’t see the receipts.
Unprotected Female. Eh P Oh–the old housemaid couldn’t write, and
the housekeeper was a very respectable woman.
Attorney. You don’t mean to say, that you’ve gone and paid the
legacies, without taking stamped receipts?

Unprotected Female (innocently)...You know it can't make any matter.
They’re quite honest people, and they’ll never come again for the money.
Attorney. But you’ve subjected yourself to a heavy penalty, Ma'am.
You were bound to take a receipt, with date, testator's name, exor's
name, lºatee's name, amount and rate of duty. Dear, dear, this is very
serious :
Unprotected Female (tearfully). Oh—how is a poor woman to know?
But nobody will ever find out. - -
Attorney. Then the legatees are liable to a penalty for not giving the
receipt. They’ll be down on those poor servants, at the Legacy Duty
Office. And there’ll be the ten per cent. on the legacy to pay perhaps
—dear me, this is very unfortunate. -
Unprotected Female (in utter despair). Oh—why did AUNT SMITHERs
leave me her executrix? Why didn't she pay the servants their legacies
before she died? Oh–What is to be done? I wish somebody–
[The door opens sºftly, and MR. Jones appears. UNPROTECTED
FEMALE feels that a higher power has interfered in her behalf,
and rushes to receive him. -
Mr. Jones (smilingly). Do I interrupt business, eh?
Unprotected Female, Oh-MR. Jones—oh, no-oh, I’m so thankful
you’re come. Oh-do look at all those papers! you can't think how
glad I am to see you. (To ATToRNEY.) Oh, if you’d only tell MR. Jones
all you’ve told me, he’d understand it, and act for me—won’t you,
please, MR. Jones? It’s AUNT SMITHERs's will.
Mr. Jones (who has long felt a curiosity about that document). With
pleasure, my dear Madam—with the greatest pleasure.
Unprotected Female (all but giving way). Because, you know, a woman
can't be expected to understand these things, and I’ve no maiºrelations
(blushing) to advise me—and I’ve been doing everything wrong, it
seems—and exposing myself to penalties, and vouchers, and things—and
I don’t know anything about it; but if you’ll talk to MR. SMART, my
solicitor. (To M.R. SMART.) This is MR. Jones, MR. SMART. (To
MR. Jon Es.) I dare say you can understand MR. SMART. Oh-now, do.
Mr. Jones (gallantly). To save you any trouble, my dear Miss
STRUGGLEs, is a pride and a pleasure—now, MR. SMART, let’s see the
papers.
[SMART and Jones begin threading the legal labyrinth, the UNPRO-
TECTED FEMALE sits by, looking with admiration at Jones, and
listening with childlike faith to his remarks.-SCENE closes.
THE CORNISH CADIS.
WE have not yet quite abandoned the habits of our forefathers.
There are boots and breeches among us yet, and the latter sit at the
seat of justice, and the former walk in her paths, and the 'squires within
them here and there, in quiet nooks and corners of the island, still ad-
minister’squirearchical justice. Of this consolatory fact here is a little
É. evidence, furnished by the Times reporter on the Western
rcuit, writing from Bodmin:—
“Before we take leave of this place, we would again call attention to a circumstance
which, perhaps, may be considered by many to be a most extraordinary interference
with the liberty of the subject. We find among the prisoners in the gaol on former
orders, “WILLIAM Quick, committed the 15th of September, 1848, for a breach of the
º: for two y or until he shall find sureties for his good behaviour; WILLIAM
URLEY, committed the 8th of May, 1849, a breach of the peace, for twelve calendar
months, or until he shall find sureties; John WALL, the 5th of Feb ;1830, a breach
of the peace, for twelve calendar months, or until he shall find sureties.”
Now the peace is a valuable commodity, but, two years.yirtual im-
risonment for its breakage is rather excessive damages. What next?
e shall hear, perhaps, of the magistrates of Cornwall confiscating
offenders' goods and chattels, or ordering delinquents to be bastinadoed
à la Cadi, ad libiţum. It would not be surprising if these gentlemen
were to set up a little extra-legal gallows, and carry out, thereon, their
peculiar views of penal discipline.
Pro Omnibus Bibo.
THE American Ambassador, on returning thanks for his health at
the Mansion House, said on Easter Monday, that,
When the loving cup went round, he drank for 22,000,000 ºf his
countrymen.”
The reports say, “Drunk with all the honours;” and really, after
such a draught as that, we do not wonder at it.
But suppose every Ambassador drank to the same extent, the LoRD
Mayor would have to provide drink for all the world! A Mansion
House dinner would be quite “an Exhibition of the Drinking Industry
of all Nations.”
MY SOLE’s IN ARMs.
A LETTER from Sweden says that there is an order for the navy to
be immediately put “on a war *...*. We suppose that the sailors
will all have to wear. Bluchers or Wellingtons, which is our idea—
rather a literal one perhaps—of a war footing.
THE QUARTER'S REVENUE,
HE returns of the Revenue are
now before us; and to those
who are fond of a puzzle, com-
posed of the mystification of an
array of figures and facts, we
can promise an hour's treat, in
a contemplation of the official
document. The best of it is,
that it is a puzzle which never
ends, for the Returns may be
returned to again and again
without any solution of the
mystery. We are happy to be
told that the result is satisfac-
tory, though the balance is on
the wrong side; but we can-
not very well understand what
WNM there is satisfactory in a reduc-
N\ tion of income; and, when we
WR come to details, the following
N is the result of all we can
§ gather:-
The Customs have decreased'
from a scarcity, we suppose.
*- - of customers, and there has
been a falling off in sugar,L
the sweet tooth of John Bull having failed to exert its usual influence.
Grain and flour have also produced less, so that the contents of the
sack have sympathised with the saccharine. In the Excise there has
been additional consumption,-so that the depression complained of has
not materially affected the spirits, and poverty has had its gin, if it has
also had its bitters. The Assessed Taxes seem to have been paid more
romptly than usual, and the gatherer has no doubt had his patience
ess tried, and been able to keep himself and his rates more thoroughly
collected.
The Income-Tax seems to be in an undulating state, for one year it
º “up, up, up,” and another year it, goes “down, down, down,”
but for the Quarter, just ended, we have returns that look like
increased profits. There is a decrease of £8000 in the Post-Office,
which, if we may be allowed to adopt the usual mysterious style of
analysing § statements, would show a diminution in letters
amounting, when divided by 26, to a falling off of 307 and a fraction, on
every letter of the alphabet. -
Though the revenue has decreased on the quarter, it has increased
on the year, and so long as on a series of diminishing quarers we get
an augmented total, we suppose we have nothing to complain of...The
revenue seems to have a ; deal of the frothy buoyancy of a pot of beer,
which, though decidedly deficientin quantity, may be made, by a proper
adjustment of a “head,” to wear the aspect of refreshing redundancy.
e have a word or two to say about the Income-Tax, which has
taken a sudden start that may—or may not—be thus accounted for:
Taking the whole in round numbers—and we will, for the sake of
uniformity, use round numbers only—at 000,000,000, it is fair to con-
clude that every circle—of the nine we have embraced—is recovering
from the crisis.
With reference to the decrease, it must be remembered we have had
no China money this year, nor have we received anything from the River
Plate, so that the CHANCELLOR or THE ExchEQUER's plate and China
closets are getting equally empty. In looking at other commodities
we must embrace the whole of them at once, for we cannot take coffee
without sugar, nor should we think of º rum into our heads till
we had discussed the loaf, and some other articles of general consump-
tion. When the chaff is separated from the corn, when the grain in the
husk feels the full benefit of the principles of Huskisson, when the
fancy loaf is as free as the brick, henceforth to be released from duty,
then, and not till then, will English Industry have fair play and fair
work, for all work and no play has made JAck BULL more dull than he
ought to be.
The London Pharmacopoeia.
NAPOLEON, talking of medicine, said, “Water, Air, and Cleanliness
are the chief articles in my Pharmacopoeia.” But if NAPOLEON had
lived in London, his Pharmacopoeia would have been very badly
stocked; for neither its air nor its water can be recommended, from
their excessive purity, for cleanliness ; though, at the same time,
we must confess that the water of the Thames is, in its way, “a
perfect drug.”
REFLECTION OF A LONDON SIGHT-SEER.

OUR “USED UP” MAN TAKES A WALK WITH HIS COUSINS IN KENSINGTON GARDENS.
THE GRATUITOUS EXHIBITIONS OF LONDON.
IN, this, dearth of sights, open gratuitously to the public, we think it
Qur duty to point the attention of the public to such objects of out of
door attraction as may be seen upon those easy terms on which a cat
is vulgarly supposed to enjoy the privilege of gazing at royalty. For
those whº cannot afford the Zoological Gardens, at one shilling, there
is the collection of animals known as the Happy Family, in Trafalgar
Square; and though there is a suspicious drowsiness about some of the
inmates of the cage, which leads us sometimes to doubt whether the
apathy of some of the antagonistic tribes is the result of discipline or
drugging, the exhibition possesses sufficient interest to repay the
passenger for a moment's pull up on the pavement. For ſhose of
active imaginations who can see in the spirting of the syringe the
grandeur of the cascade, there are a few pints to be quaffed from
pleasure's cup in a contemplation of the paltry piece of turncockery
that is going on in the immediate ºś of the exhibition
already alluded to. For the lovers of pictorial art who cannot indulge
their taste by paying for admission to galleries of paintings, there are
numerous specimens of the modern masters to be seen in the course of
a ramble through the metropolis... There are the illuminated vans, for
instance, affording, gratuitous glimpses of the exhibitions they are
designed to advertise. - -
. To those who cannot afford to visit the Panorama of the Nile, there
is a camel, served up like a sandwich between a pair of pyramids, to be
seen for nothing at all; and those who cannot muster a shilling for the
excursion to Australia and back, under the guidance of MR. PROUT,
who invites the public to enter into his Australian views, may enjoy any
day in Regent Sireet a small taste of convicts and kangaroos, in a series
of two tableaux, on a perambulating cart, drawn by a horse that would
have caused RICHARD THE THIRD to have repented of his bargain, had
the brute been brought forward when the monarch was offering his
kingdom for a specimen of the animal. These tableaux are not only
amusing but instructive, ſor one of them has taught us the fallacy of
the saying that “a bird in hand is worth two in the bush,” for we learn
from the Australian views, that the birds in the bush are of such
exquisite beauty, that one of them is worth any two or any twenty of
those that we have ever had in hand in this country.
We need scarcely call attention to the numerous exhibitions of wax-
work that are scattered all over the town at the tailors' doors, and
which if they do not equal in fearful interest the Chamber of Horrors,
yet afford pleasing illustrations of the state of national costume in the
middle of the nineteenth century.
We say nothing about the Fantoccini performances that, abound
in London, for they are only quasi-gratuitous, inasmuch as the thrusting
of a hat under one's nose amounts to a sort of douce violence, as LoRD
BROUGHAM calls it, which one is only too glad to get rid of at the
sacrifice of one's loose copper... We had nearly forgotten that for those
who love the bustle and excitement of military scenes, the glitter and
clatter of camps and courts, there is the daily encampment of a British
Cohort in the courtyard of St. James's Palace. There may be seen, for
nothing, the young Guardsman first smelling fire from a smoky chimney
in the neighbourhood, and learning while standing by his colours at his
post—the lamp-post in the centre—to bear the heat of the action; for
the action, though comparatively trifling, is certainly not without heat
when the sun happens to be rather powerful. Such are a few of the
gratuitous Exhibitions that London contains, and we have no doubt
that having put people on the right scent, they have only to follow
their noses to find out many others such as those we have drawn
attention to.
- The Coming Animal.
'A HIPPopotAMUs is wailing at Alexandria, to be shipped over to
England. This will be the first visit ever paid to this country by this
noble and rare creature. Apartments have already, been engaged for
him at the Zoological Gardens, where an artist will wait upon him at
the very earliest opportunity, with the view of taking his portrait.
A ship has been put at the disposal of the Hippopotamus; and the
captain has .."orders to pay him every possible attention, and to
spare no expense in “going the entire animal.”
The Rhinoceros lately has been very noisy, and has not slept for
weeks. The keepers say there is more in this than meets the ey; but
for ourselves, we attribute it to a mean spirit of jealousy. The Rhino-
ceros is evidently afraid that the Hippopotamus will put his nose out
of joint.

PATRON SAINTS FOR THE WORKING CLASSES.
aah Punch-I am a journeyman car;
º: and joiner... I have a wife and
our children. I ºf don, if by so
calling them, instead of terming them
my old woman and kids, or young uns,
I am using language unsuited to m
station in life. Let that pass. I too
the former and two of the latter to see
the National Gallery and the British
Museum on Easter Monday. . . .
“If it be asked what there is to in-
terest me at either of those places, I
answer, the Pictures in one, and t
Statues, and Antiquities, and Stuffed
Animals in the other. I spend a
part of my leisure time in reading,
and know a little about such matters,
thº not so much as I could wish. - -
“When I go to look at a picture or astatue, I like to sit or stand before
it in quiet and comfort, give my mind to it, and enjoy the thoughts which
it conjures up ... I had rather do this than smoke a pipe. So when I
examine curiosities and specimens of natural history, I wish to do it
with my attention undisturbed.
“On Easter Monday both the Museum and Gallery were so crowded
as to make it a hard matter to move. I got mere glimpses, which only
tantalised me, of the wonderful and beautiful things in them. My wife
nearly fainted with the heat, and my children, the biggest of whom is
not up to my shoulder, could scarcely see at all, and were almost stifled
for nothing. I have r in newspapers of a place called the crush-
room at the QUEEN’s Opera; I suppose the British Museum and the
National Gallery on Easter Monday may have been something like it.

etters.
“These two exhibitions will continue to be crowded in this way, so
º they are the only ones open gratis on the few holidays we have
in the course of the year. This being the case, such institutions will
never do us any good; for you don't breathe in improvement with
the mere air of a room, especially when it is loaded with 800 or 1000
breaths besides your own.
“To see these places in comfort, and therefore to any good purpose,
what we workpeople want is a greater number of holidays, each holi-
day being only for a certain number at a time; so that we may take
pleasure, like labour, in gangs. -
“This would be no new-fangled system of holidays. We have one
already cut and dried. There are the Saints' days. Suppose we kept
them. Not by worshipping the Saints as demi-gods, or any nonsense
of that sort, but by taking healthy and useful recreation. The Saints,
suppose, were good folks, and would approve of this way of showing
respect to them. As it is, their names stand in the Calendar, going for
no more than those of so many directors of a Savings' Bank. I except
St. David and St. Patrick; and I propose to keep the other Saints' days
like theirs—barring the drink.
“The manner I would have the Saints' days º, is this. Formerly,
every, trade, almost, had a Saint at the head of it; the wool-combers
St. Blaize, I think; the cobblers St. Crispin, and so on. Very well.
Let each trade observe its own Saint's Day, and do him the honour of
visiting gratuitous exhibitions, fetching a pleasant walk in the fields,
or going a rail or steamboat pilgrimage to such places as Windsor or
Hampton Court., In the meantime if anything were known of the
Saint, to call his history to mind, with a view to take pattern from it,
if worthy of being taken pattern from, would be very right and proper,
of course, , Messrs. SPOONER and PLUMPTRE would find that steam.
boats and trains would load much less on Sundays, if masters and men
would put their horses together, and make the above arrangement.
“Some trades and callings have no Saints of their own: the Navvies,
for instance, who came up since the Saints' time. Such trades might
elect a provisional Saint to serve till they could produce a new one.
Why cannot Saints be made now, as formerly P Why not a ST. Dobbs,
stonemason, as well as a ST. DUNSTAN, blacksmith? The Saint might
be an artisan, a tailor, a bookbinder, a plumber-and-glazier, a cotton-
spinner—what .." will—who had led an uncommonly respectable life.
e should not be like the sort of Saint that used to five as a hermit,
ºf horse-hair next his skin and never changing it; on the con.
trary, he should be remarkable for having generally had a clean shirt
on, and for having creditably supported a wife and family. When such
a good fellow as this dies—leaving, perhaps, a trifle for his widow and
children—canonise him... Keep a happy holiday yearly in his honour.
Call him Hero, if you stick at a title that you think too serious ; but
if anybody in these hard times deserves to be counted a Saint, it is the
temperate, honest, industrious Working Man.
“Yours, John ADAMs.”
MONUMENT TO EBENEZER ELLIOTT.
THE true-tempered men of Sheffield are about to do a new honour to
themselves by honouring the memory of EBENEZER ELLIoTT; the man
whose iron pen drew up the indictment against that publig robber, Corn-
Law: and never was indictment better drawn for conviction; though
a rare success attended the novel deed, for it was only worded with
common words, the words themselves hot and glowing with hate of
wrong; ELLIOTT struck from his subject—as the blacksmith strikes
from the red iron-sparkles of burning light; and where they fell they
consumed. His homely indignation was,sublimed by the intensity of
his honesty: if his words were homely, they were made resistless by
- ut the man had the true
the inexorable purpose that uttered them.
heart and soul of the poet, and could love the simple and beautiful as
passionately as he denounced the selfish and the mean. He would turn
from the coronet of the corn-law landlord, the thing he had hammered
very small indeed, showing with his best vehemence, how very, very
little was a symbol of social rank when misused for social wrong, he
would turn from the battered bauble, and then from the heart of a
hedge-flower extract the balm of beauty, and the spirit of love. -
The Corn-Law Rhymes did greatest service. They were the earliest
utterances of a people, contending with a sense of inarticulate suffering.
They supplied the words; they gave a voice and meaning to the labour-
ing heart, and the true poet vindicated his true mission, by making his
spirit pass into the spirits of the many.
Very secure, indeed, in the genius of the Corn-Law were the lordly
corn-law landlords. Contem tuously serene the titled Triptolemuses.
There was, to be sure, a fitful noise—an impatient
House; yea, in both Houses of Landlords. And, at the time, there
was a plain, strong, vulgar man putting down certain syllables, mea-
suring out wordy lines—every line the sinew of a Sampson to pull
down the heathen temple where Monopoly sat enshrined. And these
words went abroad. They were sung by workmen on their road to
labour-they were chanted at clubs; they were droned at the fireside.
Wrong and indignation were packed into verses, and made portable to
the smallest faculty. In the meanwhile, what cared the landlord
Commons,—what the landlord Lords?
Time rolled on, and Corn-Law was condemned. The indictment
drawn by the poet, was the draft afterwards improved: but EBENEZER
ELLIOTT was the first drawer; and honoured be the men of Sheffield,
who seek to do monumental homage to their patriotic poet! We have
F. of modern statues to the sword. It is full time we had one to
the pen.
OUR WIWES AND OUR LITTLE ONES.
THE Times, in an article lºf the want of gratuitous amuse-
ments for the people, intimates that there is at least one squalling baby,
on an average, in every apartment of the National Gallery. Our con-
temporary is unwilling to insist on the exclusion of babies, lest the effect
should be to prevent the admission of those who carry the interestin
burdens, but it is gently stated that their squalls do not contribute muc
to a pleasant contemplation of the great masters. It is true that the
reat masters must frequently have attention taken from them by the
ttle masters and little misses in their parents' arms, but perhaps a sort
of machine like an umbrella-stand, might be placed at the doors, in which
babies could be safely and snugly deposited. Each infant, with a ticket
round its neck, might be claimed by the holder of a corresponding
ticket given at the door, and the infants would, at all events, be safe
against the risk that attends umbrellas of being stolen. If the baby-
stand. is not approved of by the authorities, we should suggest the
adoption of baby-jumpers at the doors of our public exhibitions, and
thus both parents and offspring could be enjoying their full swing of
pleasure at the same moment.
Agitation at a Discount.
Poor MR. John'Q'Connell, declared that when he sees the apath
of his countrymen, “his heart is rent.” If his heart is rent, there will
be very little for him to take to heart just now, for the repealers are
evidently desirous of keeping what money they have in their own
pockets. The son of the Agitator complains, bitterly of his having lost
every atom of the parent-al influence which he once hoped to exercise.
WHAT's IN A NAME?
AMONG the visitors of rank, fashion, and distinction who “assisted”
at the re-entrée of SoNTag at Her Majesty's Theatre last week we
the name of BARON DE SchERTz. e must say that in the brilliant
assemblage we observed no one that appeared to us as if he were really

was a case of the kind, the individual wore the collar of some order to
hide the deficiency.

POST OFFICE DESECRATION OF THE SABBATH.
It appears that the MARQUEssor CLANRICARDE has already effected,
or is about to effect, a postal arrangement with France, by which all
letters between France and England will be reduced to sixpence, and
further, that the said letters will be permitted to carry added weight,
namely, half-an-ounce! With these facts, published in, every news;
paper, the apathy of the "ardent, candid folks, who of late denounced
the unrighteousness of the Post-office infidels, -appears to Punch mºre
than perplexing. The French people are notoriously careless of Sunday
observance; therefore is it not plain that any treaty that shall facilitate
stal intercourse between Paris and London, must tend to the postal
§: of an English Sunday?. Should any meeting be convened
upon the question, Mr. Punch begs leave to state that this, his last fire-
new argument, is at the service of any bold-faced speaker. It, is quite
as strong, and no less logical, than anything hitherto advanced against
the Sabbath “desecration” of the MARQUEss of CLANRICARDE and
RowlanD HILL.

sea to miss one
inch of the way to China, if he only provides himself with a modern
Hand-Book, which will take him up at the Goat and Boots, and set
}. down at the sign of the Mandarin and Nine Tails in the Celestial
mpline.
There is, however, an .# delicious realms of song, to which
we have resolved on furnishing a Hand-Book. These realms are con-
fined within the walls of Her Majesty's Theatre, and though the
dominions are not vast in extent, they are important from the numerous
objects of interest they contain, and the influence they exercise.
The language, costume, and babits of the population are remarkable
for their variety, and the productions of the place present the most
curious subjects of study to the lover of art and nature. The scenery
combines the warmth and luxuriance of the South, with the bold and
rugged grandeur of the North. The buildings embrace every school of
architecture, both ancient and modern, while the climate is full of alter-
nations, as sudden, and almost as severe as those of an English summer.
We have often witnessed the graceful patineurs gliding over ice, on the
Same * that had lately been the floor of a splendid salon, and we have
seen the snow-capped mountain occupying, within half an hour, the
position in which the ſretted roof of a banquetting hall had lately been
visible. We have witnessed before our very eyes, the furniture of
nature replaced by the upholstery of art, for we have been startled by
the sudden disappearance of the mossy bank and the leafy bower, in
order to give way to the easy chair, and curtained canopy.
The place we are about to describe is in the centre of the great
western empire of fashion, and it is watered by the great stream of
population which flows into it on all sides. It is approached from
the east by the picturesque ridge of muffineers, mustard-pots, and
pepper-boxes, which have caused the National Gallery to be so
generally, sneezed at ; and the same approach is refreshed on the
south side, by those very small beer ſountains which, almost always
on tap, are continually throwing cold water on the finest site in
Europe. The access from the west is usually marked by a long line in
vehicles, all directed to the same point, and it is by joining the caravan
that the traveller is enabled to arrive, in his º: turn, at the place of
his destination. Before reaching the spot, he will be, most probably,
beset by a herd of male and female barbarians, who throw themselves
under the horses' hoofs and the carriage wheels, with a determination
and obstinacy, reminding one of nothing short of JUGGERNAUT. The
object of this insane sacrifice which, it is calculated, takes off one º:
cent. of the toes of the victims, is the attempt to sell certain books,
purporting to describe what
will be seen in the interior.
This, however, might as well
be left to the imagination, as
far as the books in question
are concerned; for what book
can describe such a scene as
may be passing within, when
LABLACHE in Don Pasquale–
that ton of man, ºf the
man of ton—is raising a laugh
by his attempts to raise a
billet.
The fraudulent productions
alluded to are not to be relied
on, for they are merely the
spoils of a piratical horde,
who infest the neighbourhood
for the purpose of waylaying
the unsuspecting traveller.
Some of the gentler portion
of the neighbouring popula-
tion come forward with flow-
ers in their hands, and one
might fancy oneself among
those “peasant girls” whom
Byron speaks of “with dark
blue eyes,” but that the eyes
in the present instance are - -
more frequently black than blue, and that the shrill exclamation
of “Buy a book or a book-kay” reminds us that we are among a
band of stragglers from the adjacent land of cockneydom. As we
near our destination the atmosphere becomes more refined: small
pickets of police stave off the marauders by, the mere production
of staves. hile we gradually descend that little range of mole-hills—
we cannot call the whole concern put together a mountain—which
slopes down from Piccadilly, we find ourselves º through a kind
of Terracina where every carriage is waylaid by bandit booksellers; and
there is one who might be considered the Fra Diavolo of the Hay.
º: if his velveteens happened to be green instead of whitey-
rown.
The frontier is now nearly gained, and a display of military force
marks the boundary of a separate domain. The army is not on a very
extensive scale, nor is there, any standing army, for one part of it is
*. walking to and fro, while the other part is sitting down comfort-
ably before a fire, which is a pleasant substitute for the fire of the enemy.
The pacific policy prevailing in the dominions of Opera, or realms of
Song, precludes the necessity for an extensive soldiery, and in fact the
civil power is paramount, for the utmost civility prevails at the frontier,
as well as at º: barrier, where the passport of the traveller will have to
be shown. This passport should be procured a few days before setting
out, and as some of our readers may be unprovided with a passport,
without which they cannot accompany us to the interior, we shall pro-
çeed no further at present, for any one who has accompanied us thus
: º not, we think, to be so ungraciously treated as to be left
Outside.
NO (CONSCIENCE) MONEY RETURNED.
IN what the Times ought to call its “Greenhorn’s Corner,” it was
lately announced that
“The ChancELLoR of THE ExchEQUER has received from X the first half of a
£5 note. He cannot answer the question as to liability.”
We miss a little appendage, which might have been gracefully added
to the above announcement, namely:-
“The CHANCELlor of THE Exchequen begs to be informed of X's address, in order
that he may return him the bit of Bank paper.”
The fact of this omission should be a lesson to all those who are
troubled with any scruples as to whether their accounts are quite square
with their tax-gatherer. In a question of liability Government takes
the benefit of the doubt. Henceforward, surely, the most morbidly
conscientious tax-payer will not hesitate to use #. same license, and
will hesitate before he sends half a note to the Exchequer-Office; an
act of rashness infinitely greater than thrusting one's head half-way into
a lion's mouth.

MILK FROM THE MOUNTAINS.
†- - - To Spanish saints and about
als º . millions of Spanish
human creatures—people,all
deemed rational, with an im-
mortal purpose—to starred,
. patrons, watch-
ing the destinies of Spain
and the aforesaid millions of
human bipeds, on their
course heavenwards — it
• must be a mater dear as
daily incense, and dailybread
and oil to know that—to the
passing astonishment of the
late Louis-PHILIPPE, now
Count DE NEUILLY-the QUEEN OF SPAIN is prosperously living
towards maternity, and the consequence thereof is, that—
“Two Physicians, appointed by the Chambers, left Madrid on the 24th ult, to choose,
in the mountains of Santander, Two healthy nurses to suckle the Royal infant.”
An old Spanish writer lays it down as a domestic canon that—if the
child be a boy, it must have two nurses. The brace of physicians,
solemnly despatched by the patriotic, Philº. Chambers, in search
of nurses, evidently hope for a man-child. It is, doubtless, this exalting
aspiration that cheers them onwards to Santander, to bring back to
Madrid milk from the mountains. -
For our own part, we may be permitted to indulge at this very
moment, a sage indifference in the matter of the sex of the august little
mystery—the small majesty in petto. We, snow-blooded English, who
worship neither Bourbon saint nor Bourbon royalty, may be fairly
exempt from any palpitation of the heart, whether destiny tosses man
or woman. Nevertheless, as a general principle, we prefer queens to
kings. Somehow, the crown is not quite someteoric on the head of a
female, and the sceptre has more of the grace and lightness of a palm-
branch. Besides, frugality is a female virtue: queens, as they are more
valuable, are at the same time cheaper. Is it not so? Let us suppose
- it cannot be treasonous towards any body in St. George's Chapel—
that there had never been a GEORGE THE FourTH; but in his stead a
buxom, good, domestic GeoRGINA. How much should we have saved
in hard cash, and—what as the most moral and pious country under
the sun is, perhaps, of equal consideration—how much in the begotteu i
iniquity of scandalous example? Again, queens are safer; their
thrones more stable. How many a man jerked or tumbled into the sea,
has gone down, struggling and shouting, beating the waters, and doing
his best to ride above them—down he has gone, and no questions
asked f How many a woman, untowardly cast upon the same element,
has floated like halcyon, until rescued; floated, without any effort of
her own, but by an accident of her feminine condition? Her petticoats
have kept her up. -
Had the salique law not obtained in France—we offer this question
as a thesis to M. GUIzot—might not Louis-PHILIPPE be still counting
his (we mean her) money at the Tuileries?
Therefore, if we may be allowed the luxury of a little anxiety for
Spain at this interesting moment—with twelve millions of Spanish souls
in a twitter of tenderest apprehension—if we may send in a fluttering
wish among the millions, it is that HER MAJESTY IsabelLA may
become mother of a daughter: yes, a little girl—if princesses are ever
little—even though one of the nurses be sent back to Santander.
We confess it to be a bold thought that would fly to the Asturias—
that would dare those mountainous districts, in a buzz and tumult with
the news of the doctors, on pilgrimage for matron nourishment—of the
urest and healthiest sort, yes, pure and healthy from the mountains—
or the illustrious unknown, the fleshly, unrevealed magnificence of the
hot, close, soul-stifling Spanish court. Milk from the Mountains ! Do
not the Bourbons need it?, Could hart pant with hotter thirst for the
water-course, than the thick, foul blood of the Spanish Bourbon—still
foul with the miasma of unventilated centuries—ought to yearn, for
mountain freshness, could the blessing come with nurses?
A few days since, and what a flutter * young thriving wives
of Santander | What visions of glory ! hat dreams of seraphic
- §: and princesses nursed at the chosen, the promoted bosoms of
antander; exalted from the mountains: exalted to—a Court | What
a grave, solemn review of flustered, black-eyed candidates for the tre-
mendous honour of suckling or º a probable king! Over-
whelming the sº of the possibility!, To be the foster-mother of a
king of Spain! hy, with the awful thought, the mountain spins like
a % and the dazzled sun blinks in heaven!
e would take breath, and ask, are the women of Santander, as wet-
nurses, under the patronage of any particular Spanish saint, or are they,
in the present *...* pointed at by the finger of profane
knowledge, as the most robust, the healthiest of matrons Is their
milk†. by the especial favour of any Madonna, or is it simply
naturally, the best ?, The two missionary physicians may answer, #
they will, we cannot. We merely know, upon book-authority, that
there are saints, whose particular business it is to watch over the
interesting minutes of Spanish princesses. . The Virgin has an obstetric
sash, with marvellous comfort in the web, at Tortosa; a sash, that
brings certain and immediate happiness to labouring Infantas. More-
over, the Virgin of Oña has, time out of mind, destroyed worms in
royal Infantas. Snakes—(and Spanish Bourbons have been troubled
with the larger pest, to the great *: of their loving subjects,)—
snakes, we take it, are beyond her skill. However, in the present case
—with twelve millions of thoughtful people in a pucker—will the Sash
of Oña be taken to Madrid Is modern heresy too strong for the
old, Spanish faith? Seeing, however, it is a matter of purest piety,
it may—on second thoughts—be safely left to grandmother CHRISTINA.
We trust that the physicians may not have returned to Madrid with
their lacteal treasures discovered at Santander, ere this sheet shall have
flown across the Pyrenees, fluttering down into the hand of IsabelLA.
Poor thing!, How many an English housemaid, at eight pounds a year,
with tea and sugar, and privilege to see her cousin the carpenter, on
Sundays—how many such a damsel has been happier than the court-
laced Queen of Spain! However, common fame is for the ten thou-
sandth time to be rebuked, and hiding her trumpet, with finger in her
mouth, must skulk away; for QUEEN ISABELLA, for all his trumpeting
–sounds that told a flattering tale to Louis-PHILIPPE—will really be
a mother. Physicians are actually despatched for wet-nurses from the
mountainous districts of Santander. Whereupon, we offer, some
advice; hoping it may reach Madrid, time enough for the counsel to be
ripened into reality.
... We hereupon propose that the two wet-nurses should enter Madrid
in state. We would have them seated in a carriage stuck about with
all fitting devices, drawn by four milk-white mules. They should be
met-say some three miles from Madrid—by the King Consort, the
Ministry, the Members of the Chambers, together with just a sprinkling
of people ecclesiastical. The carriage should be followed by two or
three hundred of the finest of the mountaineers of Santander. At a
certain point the King Consort should address the two nurses. In
grave Castilian speech he may observe how º he is to see them.
Flavouring his words with a pinch of the classical, he may speak of the
kings suckled by bears and wolves—(omitting the unquestionable apes)
-promising for his child a happier destiny, a more truthful course,
fostered by such nurses—seeing they are from the healthiest and
strongest of the people !
Truly, a pleasant, and profitable myth might be evolved from the
homely fact, that the babe of the pigmy Bourbon—the infant of a
warfed and miserable line should º the luck to be nursed upon
Milk from the Mountains. A LITTLE BIRD.
THE CHELSEA SQUADRON OF EVOLUTION.
PREVIOUs to the commencement of the Penny Steam-Boat Season it
is customary to turn out the craft for the purpose of evolution on the
Thames, and the following are some of the results, according to the log
of a well-known chip-of-an-old-block, who has been a stoker all his life,
having been born at Stoke Pogis and educated at Stoke Newington:-
April the lst.—On board the Daffodil. Signalled the Polyanthus in
three-fathom mud and one-fathom water.
9 a.m.—Ran three yards to the leeward; fowled a swam; got out
the larboard boathook; caught a crab; fractured a waterman's scull,
and missed stays—a pair hung out to dry but blown overboard.
A past 9 a.m.—The Daffodil relying on her jib began jibbing, when
the Polyanthus, being a cable's length from her spanker, got the cable
into a knot, which took thirty minutes to undo, and limited her to the
rate of two knots an hour. - -
4 to 10–The Polyanthus got a-ground on a tempenny nail, having
gone on a wrong tack, which brought her up sharp; and the Daffodil
H. cleverly by a figure-head, and a bundle of herrings dangling at the
wsprit.
The Last of the Gibbet-Posts.
THE papers tell us that—
“The last of the Lincolnshire gibbet-posts was blown down by the late gale. It
was that on which, forty years ago, the notorious malefactor, Tom Ortºn, was hung
in chains for the murder, near the spot, of a young woman that he married in the
morning and killed before night.”
There is a significant, an instructive omen in this doing of the late
gale. The hurricane that sweeps away the Lincolnshire gibbet-post is
only prophetic of the public opinion that, increasing in its might, shall
surely blow down every gallows in the kingdom.
UNPARALLELED MUNIFICENCE:-Though the Gardens were closed,
the Bears at the Zoological were entertained, by order of the Directors,
with a liberal supply of hot-cross buns on Good Friday.

NOOKS AND CORNERS OF CHARACTER.
RICHARDSON'S GHOST.
THE British Drama nods—SHAKSPEARE goes to sleep now and then to wake up all the
stronger—actors die, -even RICHARDSQN himself is gathered to his forefathers, but
Richardson's Ghost is always alive. Like the king, “The Ghost never, dies.”
We hope he never will—for the Ghost is a very good fellow. He is always to be found on
the side of virtue. When Innocence is oppressed, and does not know which way to turn
to avoid the bundle of swords and poniards that, thick as quills upon the fretful porcupine, are
pointed at her breast—then the gong is heard—two bars are i. in the orchestra, and the
Ghost stalks on to her rescue. stantly each glittering sword drops to the ground with shame
—Willany is abashed, and hides his head at the side wing—Virtue rushes to the arms of her
spangled lover, and the green-baize curtain acknowledges the prettiness of the tableau by
curtseying to “soft music.” - -
Alonzo, Gaspardo, Rinaldo, owe, a deep, debt of gratitude to the Ghost. Think of the
numerous murders their dirks would have been stained with, if it had not been for his timely
apparition. - - --
p he Ghost, however, is most gentle in his vengeance. His face is as pale as chalk-his lips
are the colour of cigar-ashes—but not an angry word flies from them. He looks a thousand
unutterable things—but not to one of them does he attempt to give utterance. He merely
flaps his wings—opens them to the utmost stretch of the table-cloth-but his revenge goes
no further. After the wrongs that must be locked up in his ghostly breast, this forgiveness
almost touches the sublime ! - -
SHAKspEARE's Ghost speaks his indignation in the most, magnificent blank verse; but
RICHARDsoN's leaves his a blank altogether. SHAKSPEARE's complains of the “fires,” in
which he is being roasted every day, like a Spanish chestnut; he has a nose to!" scent the
morning air;” he has eyes to see the paleness of the glow-worm: he has painful recollections
of “a foul, unnatural, murder,” and walks about with a burning desire to have it revenged.
How different is RICHARDsoN's Ghost!...You do not hear him complaining. He is somebody’s
ghost, but he never tells you whose. He may be his father's—or his grandmother's—or the
“base traitor's,” whose uplifted arm and guilty career he has suddenly arrested; but we cannot
tell: his lips are as secret as the grave he has that moment come from ; and all we know about
him is that he is RICHARDson's Ghost. He is evidently the victim of some fearful crime, but
he urges no one to blood, in order to avenge it. In fact, so meekly does he endure his wrongs,
that we are inclined to think at times that he must be the ghost of a murdered deaf-and-dumb
†: of some quaker, whose unhappy fame has escaped the pen of the Newgate Calendar
istorian.
But these are mysteries which hang, like a shroud, round the portly frame of the Ghost, and
which we can no more tear aside than lift up the veil whether he is—
“Doomed for a certain time to walk the night;"
though this can be no great hardship, as he never appears on the platform, and his walks have
enerally terminated before midnight. In this mighty ğ. does RICHARDson’s Ghost
É. the advantage over the Shakspearean and all other Ghosts in the world put together—for,
whereas they only come out as the clock strikes twelve, he is in bed at that disreputable hour,
or else sitting behind the scenes, enjoying his baked shoulder of mutton.

small Ghost of the size of a charity boy would
make no impression whatever. The audience,
instead of being awed, would only laugh, and cry
“Bray-vo.” The result of the Ghost’s height is,
that the j." of his fine face is repeatedly
lost, as it is hidden behind the “sky-borders” of
the theatre, and, if the Clown, with his bismuth
cheeks, were to come on as the Ghost, the au-
dience would not be a whit the wiser for it.
This partial concealment, however, may help
the imagination. A Ghost cannot be too mys-
terious. The effect of his sudden apparition would
be completely lost if he were to parade outside
the dances with Harlequin and Columbine. There
is poetry sometimes in a mask, and grief looks
all the better for a veil. Besides, it is only natural
that a Ghost should have a cloud upon his coun-
tenance
The Ghost is most honest in his means of in-
spiring terror. No shriek behind announces his
arrival. No “sulphurous flames” in the light of
blue fire, torment the eyes and the nostrils of his
awe-stricken beholders. Everything with him is
fair and above-board. No actor is freer from clap-

T H E PROSE R.
ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
I. ON A LADY IN AN OPERA-BOX.
oING the other night
to the Conservatoire
at Paris, where there
was a magnificent as-
semblage of rank and
fashion gathered to-
gether to hear the de-
lightful performances
of MADAME SONTAG,
the friend who con-
ferred upon me the
polite favour of a
ticket to the stalls, also
pointed out to me who
were the most remark-
able personages round
about us. There were
ambassadors, politi-
cians, and gentlemen,
military ºf literary;
there were beauties,
French, Russian, and
English: there were
old ladies who had
been beauties once,
and who, by the help
of a little distance and
... politeness (and if you
didn't use your opera-glass, which is a cruel detector of paint and wrinkles), looked young and
handsome still: and a plenty of old bucks in the stalls and boxes, well wigged, well gloved,
and brilliantly waistcoated, very obsequious to the ladies, and satisfied with themselves
and the world. - -
“Up, in the second tier of boxes I saw a very stout, jolly, good-humoured looking lady
whose head-dress and ringlets and general appurtenances were unmistakeably English—and
whom, were you to meet her at Timbuctoo, or in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan amongst a
bevy of beauties collected from all the countries of the earth, one would instantly know to be
a British female. I do not mean to say, that, were I the Padishah, I would select that moon-
faced houri out of all the lovely society, and make her the Empress or Grand Signora of my
dominions; but º: that there is a character about our countrywomen which leads one to
know, recognise, and admire, and wonder at them among all women of all tongues and countries.
We have our British Lion ; we have our BRITANNLA ruling the waves; we have our British
female—the most respectable, the most remarkable, of the women of this world. And now we
have come to the woman who gives the subject, though she is not herself the subject, of these
present remarks. -
“As I looked at her with that, fond curiosity and silent pleasure and wonder which she (I
mean the great British Female) always inspires in my mind, watching her smiles, her ways and
motions, her allurements, and attractive gestures—her head bobbing to this friend, whom
she recognised in the stalls—her jolly fat, hand wagging a welcome to that acquaintance
in a neighbouring, box—my friend and guide for, the evening, caught her eye, and made
her a respectful bow, and said to me with a look of much meaning, ‘That is MRs.
lºmº And from that minute I forgot MADAME SONTAG, and thought only
Ol MRS. T.-W.
“‘So that,” said I, ‘is MRs. TROTTER-WALKER!

“you look to be as kind and good-natured a person as eyes ever lighted upon. The way in
which you are smiling to that young dandy with the double eye-glass, and the empressement
with which he returns the salute, shows that your friends are persons of rank and elegance,
and that you are esteemed by them—giving them, as I am sure from your kind appearance
you do, good dinners and pleasant balls. But I wonder what you would #. iſ you knew that
I was ſooking at you? I behold you for the first time: there are a hundred pretty young
girls in the house, whom an amateur of mere beauty would examine with much greater
satisfaction than he would naturally bestow upon a lady whose prime is past; and yet the sight
of you interests me, and tickles me so to speak, and my eye-glass can’t remove itself from
the contemplation of your honest face.” -
..“What is it that interests me so? What do you suppose interests a man the most in this
life HIMSELF, to be sure. It is at himself he is looking through his opera-glass—himself
who is concerned, or he would not be watching you so keenly. And now ſet me confess why

WALKER, is it?’ with an air of such deep interest.
“Well, then. In the year †† hundred and thirty odd, it happened that I went to pass the
winter at Rome, as we will call the city. MAJOR GENERAL and . TroTTER-WALKER
were also there; and until I heard of them there, I had never heard that there were such
people in existence as the General and the lady—the lady yonder with the large fan in the
upper boxes. Mrs. WALKER, as became her station in life, took, I dare say, very comfortable
lodgings, gave dinners and parties to her friends, and had a night in the week for receptions.
“Much as I have travelled and lived abroad, these evening réunions have never greatly

to my memory, and made me recal some of the griefs and
fascinated me. Man cannot live upon lemonade,
wax candles, and weak tea. Gloves and white
neck-cloths cost money, and those plaguy shiny
boots are always so tight and hot. Am I made
of money, that I can hire a coach to go to one of
these soirées on a rainy Roman night; or can I
come in goloshes, and take them off in the ante-
chamber? I am too poor for cabs, and too vain
for goloshes. If it had been to see the girl of
my heart (I mean at the time when there were
girls, and I had a heart), I couldn't have gone
in goloshes. Well, not being in love, and not
liking weak tea and lemonade, I did not go to
evening parties that year at Rome; nor, of later
years, at Paris, Vienna, Copenhagen, Islington,
or wherever I may have been.
“What, then, were my feelings when my dear
and valued friend, MRs. CoverLADE (she is a
daughter of that venerable peer, the Right
Honourable the LORD COMANDINE), who was
passing the winter too at Rome, said to me, “My
dear DR. PACIFICO, what have you done to
offend MRs. TROTTER-WALKERP”
“‘I know no person of that name,” I said.
"I knew WALKER of the Post Office, and poor
TROTTER who was a captain in our regiment,
and died under my hands at the Bahamas. But
with the TROTTER-WALKERs I haven’t the
honour of an acquaintance.”
“‘Well, it is not likely that you will have that
honour,” MRs. CoverLADE said. “MRs. WALKER
said last night that she did not wish to make
your acquaintance, and that she did not intend to
receive you.”
“‘I think she might have waited until I asked
her, Madam,” I said. “What have 1 done to
her? I have never seen or heard of her: how
should I want to get into her house? or attend
at her Tuesdays—confound her Tuesdays l’ I
am sorry to say I said, Confound MRs. WALKER's
Tuesdays, and the conversation took another
turn, and it so happened that I was called away
from Rome suddenly, and never set eyes ".
MRs. WALKER, or indeed thought about her
from that day to this. - ----
“Strange endurance of human vanity! a million
of much more important conversations have
escaped one since then, most likely—but the
memory of this little mortification, (for such it
is, after all) remains quite fresh in the mind, and
unforgotten, though it is a trifle, and more than
half a score of years old. We forgive injuries,
we survive even our remorse for great wrongs
that we ourselves commit; but I doubt if we
ever forgive slights of this nature put upon, us,
or forget circumstances in which our self-love
had been made to suffer.
“Otherwise, why should the remembrance of
MRs. TROTTER-WALKER have remained so lively
in this bosom?, Why should her appearance
have excited such a keen interest in these eyes?
Had WENUs or HELEN (the favourite beauty of
PARIs) been at the side of MRs. T.-W., I should
have looked at the latter more than at the Queen
of Love herself. Had MRs. WALKER murdered
MRs. PACIFIco, or inflicted some mortal injury
upon me, I might forgive her—but for slight?
Never, MRs. TROTTER-WALKER; never, by
NEMESIs, never!
“And now, having allowed my personal wrath
to explode, let us calmly moralise for a minute
or two upon this little circumstance; for there
is no circumstance, however little, that won't
afford a text for a sermon. Why was it that

“Gentility is the death and destruction of social happiness amongst
the middle classes in England. It destroys naturalness (if I may coin
such a word) and kindly sympathies. The object of life, as I take it, is
to be friendly with everybody. As a rule, and to a philosophical cos-
mopolite, every man ought to be welcome. I do not mean to your
intimacy or affection, but to your society; as there is, if we would
or could but discover it, something notable, something worthy of
observation, of sympathy, of wonder and amusement in every fellow
mortal. If I had been MR. PACIFIco, travelling with a courier
and a carriage, would MRs. WALKER have made any objection to me?
I think not. It was the Blucher-boots and the worn hat, and the
homely companions of the individual which were unwelcome to this lady.
If I had been the disguised DUKE of PACIFIco, and not a retired
army-surgeon, would she have forgiven herself for slighting me? What
stores of novels, what foison of plays, are composed upon this theme,

tacles, and appears º, -

hands and applaud—what?—the star and garter.

fellowship, we forego for the sake of our confounded gentility, and

guests by a money-standard.

MAJESTY, nine Arabian horses, which, it is said, are such very poordiminu.
tive-looking creatures, that every respectable, dray-horse turned up his
nose at the cayalcade as it proceeded to the Palace. We cannot say much
for the breeding of the animals that so misbehaved themselves towards
the little strangers, but it must be acknowledged that the real Arabians
are not to be compared with even, the humblest, hack of British birth
that ever plunged in a cab, or kicked up “behind and before” in a
dust-cart; "We should fear that HER MAJESTY would be much dis.

mouth, it is probable that the Sovereign may soon wish the unprofitable
present absent. When PRINCE ALBERT saw the stud of Arabian
failures, he must have mentally begun to whistle to himself, “Oh, give
me (anything) but my Arab steed;” and it would not have been sur-
prising had, “Galloping Dreary Dun” burst involuntarily from the lips
of an attendant stable-boy. It is said that the accoutrements were as

A BLACK RAINBOW,
AMONG the newspaper wonders, upon which the penny-a-liners some-
times ameliorate their condition by obtaining an extra meal, we have
lately noticed a fivepenny phenomenon—just four lines and a half in
length—under the title of a black rainbow. This remarkable triumph
of nature over the ordinary rules of meteorology has been seen by an
American newspaper’s “own correspondent,” who has, probably, not
been particular to a shade in the view he has taken of, the marvel, he
as paragraphed. We suspect the rainbow is not so black as it has
been painted, though we confess that we have observed in our own
political atmosphere an appearance almost equally discouraging, namely,
that of the rainbow of taxation which spreads entirely across the sky
from one horizon to the other. The affair looks, rather black, but we
are not without hope that the prospect will soon brighten,

A GREAT MORAL LESSON.
THOMAs Sutton, denominated “an honest and hard-working fellow”
until Rush, the murderer, was convicted, became a thief out of intense
curiosity to see the murderer hanged. A great instance, this, of the
benefit of example ! SUTTON stole two sovereigns, and went rejoicing
on his way to Norwich; there he witnessed the show; and thence,
returned to London. His morbid hunger sated, his old honesty re-
asserted itself, and remorse led him to self-accusation; he was sum-
marily punished. Since then, the thief’s hand has again been at work,
and a fortnight ago, he was committed, from Lambeth Office, for trial,
again confessing his crime; he had stolen four saws from a marine
store; and has now every chance of becoming permanently enrolled
*; her Majesty's convicts. -- -
Robinson Crusoe has made many a sailor, wileing the boy from the fire-
side to the sea. The especial pains taken by a miserable portion of the
press to “make the most of a murder,” cannot but have an influence on
the dormant ambition of the criminal. Art, too, has its fatal blandish-
ments. MADAME Tussaud offers Scoundrel's Čorner, with an immor-
tality in wax. . Every day she calls from the columns of the newspapers
with a voice of silver (exactly eighteen-pence, “Horrors” included)–
calls to a thoughtful generation to consider and lay well to heart the
notoriety, that is the vulgar stimulant of miserable natures. What the
statue of NELsoN is to the sailor, the Murderer in Wax is to the
unblown scoundrel. Did not, FREDERICK MANNING, whose name,
like morning dew, ever brightens, the morning newspapers, - did
not he, in the fireside confidence with his student lodger, dally with
a forbidden pleasure, when he spoke of RUSH, as the prime beauty
of the Chamber of Horrors?
What beneficially we may owe to the imitative bronze of defunct
heroes, it is hard to guess; what, per contra, to felonious wax, even
MADAME.T. herself-(should Joseph HUME move for a return)—it is
no less difficult to calculate. Of one point, however, we are sure: the
Home Minister owes MADAME.T.’s “Chamber” greater attention than
is bestowed even upon penny theatres by the Home police.
CARELESS JOHN, THE STATE COACHMAN.
OH ! Pray, my LoRD JoHN, take care how you go on,
For Parliament isn't at play with you;
Mind well how you drive, for, as you are alive,
Your horses are running away with you.
In one week twice beat, you another defeat
Escape by the barest majority,
ecause, it would seem, you don’t govern your team
With proper control and authority.
Why BARING, alas ! did you let, with DUNDAs,
And BERKELEY, the claims, so ungraciously, .
Of the naval Assist-ant-Surgeons resist,
Unhandsomely, meanly, mendaciously?,
The Crown lawyers, pray, why allow in the way
Of the County Courts Bill to stand bootlessly P
For you were floored flat both in this case and that,
Incurring much odium quite fruitlessly.
Why sanction the fight for the tax upon light,
Where Wood, of Health’s Board contradictory,
Was morally smash'd, and, in fact, all but thrash'd,
With his petty numerical victory?
Look after your steeds, for be spilt you must needs,
Unless you are much more particular,
With Phaëton's fate from the chariot of state
Hurl’d heels over head perpendicular.
Strongholds of Filth and Pestilence.
A MR. W. S. HALE, the other day at the City Court of Sewers, is
reported to have remarked that—
“He thought the powers of invading a man's house in such a manner as to prevent
it from being any longer called his castle, had been somewhat liberally bestowed upon
the Commissioners of Sewers.”
The kind of castle of which MR. HALE appears to be the champion
might, if fortified, present an illustration of the saying, “A forty-eight
pounder at the door of a pig-sty.”
DOING THINGS BY HALVES.
THE town of Belfast seems to be going very fast indeed, for its popu-
lation has increased, since 1831, from something over fifty to above one
hundred thousand. With such a result as this, showing an augmentation
of cent. per cent, we think the name of Belfast should, in reference to
its population, be exchanged for that of Doublin’.
OUR CHIROPODIST.
It is not to be supposed that so great a personage as Punch could allo-
gether escape such an evil as corns, } which—if we are to believe the
corn-cutters—all the personages of the best standing in society are
visited. Statesmen, politicians, nobles, lawyers, and divines, are—
according to the advertisements—so many martyrs to those horny
excrescences, which render them literally as well as figuratively anxious
to avoid having their toes trodden on. Though Punch never sus-
pected himself to be a corn-grower on an extensive scale, for he has
never known the shoe to pinch him under any circumstances, he still
imagined that, from his illustrious position, he could not be exempt
from a malady apparently so peculiar to the most distinguished indi-
viduals. He therefore sent for his Chiropodist, who produced an article
worthy to form a supplement to the last edition of Elevant Ertracts.
Punch was, a good deal surprised at the produce, for, had he been
cultivating his own corn, with all the ºf high farming operations
including the harrowing process of tight boots, he could not have yielde

HOMOEOPATHIC STUFFING.
Two distinct homoeopathic hospital dinners were reported last week
in the Morning Post of one day. Unfortunately, the Post omitted to
F. their respective bills of fare. It might be *. that at a
omoeopathic banquet, real turtle would be served by teaspoonfuls
instead of tureens. A single whitebait would, one imagines, suffice
the largest company for fish. Wenison, we conceive, would be brought
to table by the small slice, and carved by the fibre. Our notion of a
homoeopathic pudding is that of a globule. Chemistry informs us that
all meat contains infinitesimal quantities of various substances—sulphur,
phosphorus, &c., which are of a medicinal nature. The red particles
in gravy include so many homoeopathic doses of iron. What a deal of
medicine, then, must be taken at every meal, and how qualmish we all
ought to feel after it, if there is any virtue in homoeopathic doses'
Perhaps we do, and don’t know it. Perhaps LoRD R. GROSVENOR, at
one of the above-mentioned banquets, and the EARL of Essex at the other
and the various lords and gentlemen over whom they presided, regaled
themselves on millionths of mouthfuls, and drank toasts in billionths of
drops. One ºf however, they did not do. They did not subscribe
infinitesimally. he total amount of subscriptions announced at one
dinner was £1,000; at the other £800. This º is doubtless very
creditable to the hearts of its authors, bnt can hardly be said to do equal
honour to their superior stories, in which, if they were not occupied by
delusions, it is probable that there would be lodgings to let., The best
that can be said of these votaries—or victims—of homoeopathy, is that
they have shown great alacrity in parting with their money.
CABINET WoRK AND WAGEs.—We anticipate that one recomment
dation made by the Committee on Public Salaries will be, that Ministers
should in future be paid, not quarterly, but by the piece, or at so much
per measure, of legislation. Colon EL SIBTHORP will probably suggest
that the Whigs would be well off if they were paid by the job.

The whole affair was got up almost impromptu, and consisted of a
running-match from the corner of Chancery Lane to the other side of
the river Thames, the bridge selected being optional. BARNEY AARON
made his appearance suddenly, which MR. DUNUP took as the signal
for starting, as there had already been a match of a similar kind
between the parties, in which the latter had come of victorious; and
he knew the former was desirous of trying another experiment.
BARNEY carried weight, consisting of a stick and a small slip of parch-
ment; but, DUNUP was i. with nothing but an empty purse;
and it had been whispered in many quarters that he would be found to
want metal. He had no sooner caught sight of his º than he
cut off at a rapid rate, BARNEY following closely at his heels, as far as
the corner of Essex Street, when DUNUF seemed about to give in, for
he turned sharp round (in consequence, as we have been since informed,
of the want of metal to go over Waterloo Bridge), where the halfpenny
toll would have brought him to, a stand-still. His opponent being
evidently taken aback by this sudden move, DUNUP started off again
at a terrific rate, and making all the running, through the intricate
turnings of Whitefriars, he went away at a slapping pace, past the
glass-works, took a diversion through a broker's shop, by which he cut
off a corner, and having gained several yards on his opponent, won
cleverly by the length of a writ, which, though it was made to run
pretty fast into Middlesex, could not run into Surrey.

lies, finding their incomes reduced, have curtailed the number of pairs
of breeches usually issued to their flunkeys, and thus calculate on
saving by the end of the year a considerable over-plush.

ADMIRALTY v. ASSISTANT-SURGEONS.
To ColoneL SIBTHORP.
EAR Colon EL-LET me
congratulate you on
your recent display, of
indiscretion. I use the
term merely in a Minis-
terial sense. “Indis-
cretion,” according to
the Čabinet dictionary,
is interference with the
Admiralty. ADMIRAL
NAPIER was, in the first
place, so “indiscreet”
as to disclose the eco-
nomy, ability, method,
and practical efficiency
for which that business-
like department of the
Government is now
celebrated. , You, most
– appropriately, followed
up his revelations with
a motion for the reduc-
tion of the number of the Lords of the Admiralty, and for a diminution of their salaries.
Your motion, my dear Colonel, though it failed, I grieve to say, was admirably timed.
Guriously enough, the Admiralty had just been exhibiting, itself in a peculiarly amiable
light, by resisting CAPTAIN, BoldeRo's proposition for the better accommodation of Naval
Assistant-Surgeons. You felt this, Colonel, I know. You are not the man to pooh-pooh the
claims of these gentlemen, and of their profession. .You can understand, the importance
of a class on whose skill may depend the preservation of a limb. The Admiralty Lords cannot
—and they have not a leg to stand upon. -
I now address you, Colonel, SIBThoRP, as an officer and a gentleman. As such, what think
you of the excuses made by persons–supposed to be also officers and , gentlemen-for
restricting adult members of a liberal profession, ranking as lieutenants, to the berth of
sea-schoolboys? - -
ADMIRAL DUNDAs, unless the reports belie him, opposed CAPTAIN BOLDERO's motion,
on the ground that the ward-room was not large enough to admit the Assistant-Surgeons.
CoLoRESIBTHORP, I have to ask you a painful question; was the plea of this honourable
member and gallant Admiral TRUE * Here is the answer I get from MR. HUME:-
“SIR. G. Cockburn, eight or ten years ago, gave the same reply, on the ground of want of room; but three
officers since that time had been added to the ward-room.”
May I charitably hope that, ADMIRAL DUNDAs—say from inexperience-was merely
mistaken as to the capabilities of the ward-room?, We shall see perhaps, CAPTAIN BERKELEY
standing together in his chivalry with the Admiral against the poor Assistant-Surgeons, ob ected
likewise to their demands the want of room. But CAPTAIN BERKELEY has been foully mis-
represented by the newspapers, or he argued that
“It would be the greatest blow to the discipline of the service, if, upon their first entering, the Assistant-
Surgeons were ill.i. mess with the higher class of officers.”
To which does CAPTAIN BERKELEY object, on the part of “the higher class of officers,”—the
Assistant-Surgeons' room, or their company?
The following was our candid Captain's reply to a complaint which related to the youth
merely of the midshipmen:—
“Well, suppose that they were schoolboys, they had their education most probably at Rugby, Eton, Harrow, or
other of our public schools; they were possessed of gentlemen's feelings, and he should like to know at what school
the Assistant-Surgeons were brought up that could make them one jot superior to the midshipmen. He denied that
they were so, and, as the comparison had been made, he would boldly maintain, that, if there was any gain, as far
as association was concerned, it was on the side of the Assistant-Surgeons.”
He would lº maintain! Y. boldly, in faith, I hope, my Colonel, that your bold Captain
| fights as boldly as he argues. Who disparaged the midshipmen’s birth and breeding,as he implies?
One more instance of this gallant gentleman's bravery of assertion. Of the sº to
promote the Assistant-Surgeons to the ward-room, he pronounces, with a courage worthy of
MUNCHAUSEN, that
b “It Mºntrary to their interest, and he believed, generally speaking, to their desire also, that they should
e so placed.” -
Oh! my dear Colon EL SIBTHORP, it makes me ill; it gives me a feeling of unspeakable
. to imagine that this reckless language can have been uttered by “officers and
gentlemen.’
I pass over SIR. F. BARING's speech on this subject—the mere stereotyped humbug,
as you know, of office.
One word more, my Colonel. In the very Times which records the above disgraceful sayings,
I observe, touching matters now under the Admiralty’s consideration, the announcement that
“It is said that epaulettes are to be altogether abolished; and it is a question whether the antiquated cocked
hat will be retained for use on board ship.”
Don’t, you think, Colonel, that the Admiralty had better confine their attention to cocked
hats, and epaulettes, and leave alone ship-building, an art in which they have not shone, and
in which they are not expert enough to provide accommodation for the Assistant-Surgeons?
I think. you will agree with me that they had, as I shall with you, that they ought to have
proportionate salaries.
Yours, my dear Colonel, at the very least, till Dissolution,
398:1961%.

cannot help it—for the safety of the British

THE Irish newspapers state that the

THERE are reports that gold is, after
all, not so plentiful as it was expected
to be at California. The diggers are
turning crusty at the precious metal
forming merely a crust over the soil,
and ill-natured remarks are being made
upon Nature, for having condescended
to use the electrotype process, instead
of making the ground one solid mass
of the precious metals. We hear that
j abounds in California, and
that, whenever a stranger presents
himself, the host, putting a pick-axe
into his visitor's hand, requests hi
to sit down and pick a bit.
SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF
SHE MARRI ES THE
SCENE.-St. George's, Bloomsbury. Eleven o'clock. The SMITHERs's
fly, and the TROTTERs’ own carriage, and a hack cab drive up. The
SMITHERs's fly-man is in a large favour, and a state of partial intor-
ication. The TROTTERs' coachman thinks favours low; but has also
been drinking the 'ealth of the 'appy couple by anticipation. The UN-
PROTECTED is in the TROTTERs' own carriage, with her cousin
TROTTER, who is to give her away, and two of the bridesmaids, Miss
SUSAN TROTTER, and the youngest Miss (ANNE) SMITHERs, a person
of mature years. OLD SMITHERs, and Miss SARAH, and Miss
SMITHERs, and Miss GUNSTON, are very tight in the fly. JACK
SMITHERs is in the cab. He is nothing in particular in the ceremony,
but, being of a lively turn, and fond of going to executions, has insisted
on seei Iss STRUGGLEs “turned off,” as he persists in calling it,
to the disgust of his sisters. (N.B. For costume, see Advertisement.)

tº MARRIAg: IN, HIGH LIFE.—On Wednesday, the 18th, at
St.George's, Bloomsbury, was consummated the long expected wedding
(which has been long on the tapis, and has given rise to so many on dits
in a weekly newspaper) between DAVID Jones, Esq. (of the Wiś.
firm of SMITH, JoNEs, and Robinson, corn-factors and general merchants)
and the lovely and accomplished Miss MARTHA STRUGGLEs (only child
of the late SAMUEL STRUGGLEs, so much #. in the commercial
world). The lovely bride wore an amber glacé silk, with an amber chapeau
ensuite, Chantilly fall, and orange flowers. She was attended to the altar
by the three elegant and charming Miss SMITHERs (daughter of JoHN
SMITHERs, of the highly respectable firm of SMITHERs, GUNSTON, and
BROTHERs, Turkey merchants), Miss TROTTER (daughter of Thom As
TROTTER, Esq.), and Miss GUNSTON. (niece to John SMITHERs, Esq.,
and second cousin of the bride). The lovely bridesmaids, who were
attired en suite, wore, pea-green poplins, with white chip hats, and
Honiton veils. After the ceremony, which was impressively performed
by the Rev. GRIMEs. WAPSHOT, assisted by the REy, OLINTHus
SMITHERs (a cousin of the lovely and accomplished bride), the party
returned to a magnificent déjeúner, at the town mansion of THOMAs
TROTTER, Esq., Woburn Place, Bedford Square, whence the happy pair
proceeded by railway to Brighton, for the honeymoon.”
KING ALFRED GOING, GOING—GONE!

auctioneer's hammer, on reading in
the Hampshire Independent the an-
nouncement following:—
“The tomb and the remains of ALFRED
THE GREAT are to be offered for sale by
Auction on Thursday next, by order of the
county magistrates.
We wish the immortality which
\N this notice will confer on the magis-
\\ trates of Hampshire were such as
they might have earned by erecting
\º a fitting monument over ALFRED's

# tecture, forming a second Win-

memory of the great patron of
education. It may be well, how-
= ever, that ALFRED's burial-place
# has passed from the possession of
the Hampshire º: Per-
haps it is now in better keeping.
Our Southampton contemporary adds-
“We should have thought that the lowest depth of degradation had been reached
when the site of the splendid Abbey where his remains were deposited was covered
with the buildings of a bridewell.”
Fancy the treadmill revolving and the rogues’ hornpipe danced over
ALFRED's grave! Had the truly wooden Bench, the authors of this
desecration, lived in later days, they would perhaps have dug the hero's
bones up, and sent them to Andover to be crushed. For the future we
hope that the people of Winchester will be enabled without blushing to
point out to the stranger the spot where ALFRED lies.
A MAIL FOR CALIFORNIA.
WE find, from a notice to the public, that the Post-Office authorities
have started a mail to California. We should like to see the vehicle
selected for the service... We have a strange suspicion that the old
Hounslow cab has been fitted up with a new pair of shafts to supply the
lace of those which we dashed to pieces some time ago in a fearful col-
sion with our shafts of ridicule, and that this precious set-out has been
ordered to set out on the first stage towards the diggings. ...We used
to find fault with the rate of travelling by this concern, but the rate of
postage is satisfactory. Half-an-ounce is to be 28.5%d, an ounce,4s.lld,
and it will scarcely require an ounce to announce anything tº one's
friends in California. e think the Post-Office authorities might ven-
ture to charge higher, and declare that every letter should be charged
with its weight in gold, which the Californians, with their embarras des
richesses, could make no objection to.
THE FORCE OF HABIT.
THE DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE was the Chairman lately at some country
meeting—it was either a Burial, or a Teetotal §º. we are not

officers on dut ..contraband commodities have occasionally
been smuggled in; and there have even been cases in
which that utterly prohibited article, the surtout, has
been got across the frontier by surreptitious means, such
as pinning up the skirts so as to avoid detection on the
outskirts. It would occupy too much space to furnish a
list of those objects that are not allowed to pass; but
it may be stated, that any one who wilfully makes an object
of himself by his absurdity of costume will be at once
objected to.
The law is by this time so well understood that at-
tempts to violate it are exceedingly rare, but now and
then a bold smuggler will advance towards the frontier
with an umbrella or some other offensive weapon, and
render it necessary that a seizure should be made; a pro-
ceeding which is always conducted with a mixture of gen-
tleness and firmness highly creditable to the authorities.
The article º: is not forfeited, but is deposited in
the hands of the proper officer, who takes charge of it
till the return of the traveller, who is expected to follow
the customary laws by giving a small customary fee on
the re-delivery of the goods, seized as contraband. Bon-
nets are of course prohibited, and, indeed, they are now
seldom brought as far as the frontier, for no one now
takes such a thing into her head, or on to it, when visiting
this locality.
The only indispensable luggage consists of a binocular
lorgnette, which is essential to a due appreciation of the
numerous beauties of the place now about to be entered.
By its aid distant objects are brought near, and, though
distance lends enchantment to some views, the scenes
we are about to open to the eye of the traveller in
these favoured regions cannot be brought too near to
us. . Though we, are somewhat precipitating matters,
by giving thus early a glimpse of what is passing within,
we avail ourselves of the power of the opera-glass to
advance, or, rather, to bring nearer one of those inter-
esting tableaur, which perpe'ually arrest our attention,
and the details of which we shall shortly more minutely
go into.

A BIT OF
MY MIND.
| BIT THE FIRST.-BEING MRS. MOUSER'S BIT OF A PREFACE.
I HAVE been # upon and provoked to it... I might have gone
down to my dying day, holding my tongue to my end, if it hadn't
been for the House of Commons. MR. MouseR-
Not that as a married woman, I would whisper a breath against the
husband it has pleased Providence to allot to me. I hope I know my
burden better. But MR. MoUSER—
And I’ll be judged by any of my acquaintance, whether by so much
as a look I have ever dropt a word of what, gracious knows 1 I might
have said. No; I shall never forget what my poor aunt PEAcock—she
was drest in a silver-grey lutestring like a board, it could have stood
upon its own hem—what that good soul said to me the very day I was
married, when I went up stairs to change before I went into the honey-
moon with MoUSER, in a sulphur po’-chay with two cream-coloured
horses to the Angel at Twickenham—whether the house is there or
gone, I won’t say—never shall I forget the words of that dear soul!
—never! “AMELIA,” said she, we were both crying all the time,
“AMELIA, my blessed child, you have now changed your condition.
What is in store for you, it would be presumptuous in any of us to say.
But, my dear babe, let me advise you as a friend, never to give way to
any thoughts of happiness. It’ll be the safest. If happiness comes,
well and good—but don't expect it. You are now a married woman"—
and here aunt PEAcock, giving a shiver that her lutestring rustled
again, swallowed her tears—“a married woman, and life won’t be
what it was, AMELLA. We were made to suffer, and must go through
with it. But, AMELIA, never forget the greatest jewel in a woman
is her proper pride: that is a jewel that will support you when
friends forsake. A proper pride is better than a marriage portion, for
it’s all for a woman's self. AMELIA, if you’re nipped to bits with red-
hot pincers—I don’t mean to say”—for 1 did look at aunt PEAcock
—“I don’t mean to say for a certain you will be; but if it should so
happen, don't say a word, however MouseR may ill-treat you. I don’t
mean to say he will, and finow that—only five minutes ago—he called
you before all the company his pearl, his rose without a thorn, his cup
of happiness running over at the brim; but all that goes for nothing
when it comes to plain working-day married life. Therefore, however
miserable you may be, don't make other people as wise as yourself. If
your heart’s breaking up to bits, put a smile upon it, as if nothing was
the matter. In a word, my dear girl, whatever may be your troubles in
wedlock, always have an oyster in your mind, and suffer and say
nothing.” These were poor aunt PEAcock's words; and at that time
how little I thought of 'em! The po'-chay’s steps were hardly up—the
door put to—and we not five minutes on the way to the Angel, when
the words were as clean out of my mind, as if they'd never been spoken. |h
But, to be sure, at that time, MR. MouseR—
. Nevertheless, it is not my intention—no, not in the face of red-hot
nippers themselves–to say a word that aunt PEAcock in her grave
would shake her head at. I have taken care of my F. ride from
the first, and it’s grown along with me. The things I have heard, and
the silence I have kept, would not be believed hy, there was only
last Tuesday, when . HoRNBLower—I sometimes think, when that
woman's talking, she has her own tongue and mine into the bargain—
when she would tell me all about Hornblow ER, beginning with his
goings-on from the first down to last week only, when he jumped up
like a madman from a sweet bit of cold mutton, and rushing up-
stairs, shaved himself in a passion, and drest himself in a whirlwind,
and banged the door like a savage, and went out to dine at a tavern
like a hurricane, and came home at last in a condition that men are
much better out—well, when I’d heard it all, looking down as I did
upon the woman, and wondering where was her proper pride, to take
her husband from house to house, and to bring up their cold mutton as
if it was as much other people's concerns as their own—well, when I
had heard all this, and, seeing MRs. HoRNBLower expected me to talk
in my turn, and f didn’t; for though, gracious knows! if I’d only had
the mind to speak of MR. MouseR-
But no; as I say, red hot pincers should never do it. Yet, when I
think of the temptation I go through, it is wonderful. More than that,
I’m sure of it, all my married friends think me a poor creature with
not a bit of spirit that does and takes just what her husband chooses;
but it’s a sweet consolation in my trials that they know very little of
AMEIIA MoUSER. No; I hear all their troubles, smile upon 'em and
only double-lock my own in my own breast. If it was not so! why,
there’s that man—whom everybody believes to be an angel at a fire.
side-there is MR. MouseR-
Still, I should despise myself for my want of proper pride, if I was to
say a word. And yet to hear how that foolish woman, MRs. Butler,
does go on about BUTLER; for all the world, as if every woman in life
#. up every morning to do nothing all day but to think of BUTLER.
ow she tired me out on Monday! Sent away another servant, because
BUTLER, happening to say the day before, he thought pink of all colours
prettiest on a woman, and then the bold slut flaunted it the very next
morning in pink, of course, as that silly woman said, for nothing else
only to please BUTIER! Well, whatever I may have felt in my ſlie, I
hope I’ve always followed the advice of poor aunt PEAcock, “As for
jealousy, my dear,”-she used to say—“it’s like, the small-pox, and
always disfigures the woman that shows it... Like the small-pox it
sometimes comes and can't be helped; but, unlike the small-pox, if you
so will it, you needn't discover the marks... Jealousy may be a burning
arrow, but let it burn unseen: never pull it out, and expose it before
company.” I am sure, when I see how some of my acquaintance will
. their green eyes—as somebody calls 'em—into all places, I'm
doubly grateful for my proper pride. I never speak, but I know this
fact—nobody better I’ll be bound—I know there's Turks out of
º: Of course, nobody to look at him, would think that MR.
OUSER-
Not that, for a moment, I am going to forget what I owe to myself.
Certainly not. Burning arrows are better kept for one's own fireside,
and for one's own husband. Nobody else has any right to 'em. The
same with everything 'twixt man and wife... I'm sure I wouldn't go
on like that dreadful MRs. HALIFAx, exposing her husband's pocket
and showing how mean, how little he is, wherever she goes. “ Would
you believe it,” says she to me—expecting I should care a pin's-point
about it—“would you think it, that HALIFAx, with all the money he
has, and what he has, though I’ve been his wife these fifteen years,
I don't know—with all he has, grudges me I may say, as much
as a new riband? My dear, if he wasn't my own, husband, I should
. he was a brute, for he thinks a new gown will last for ever. I
tell him he ought to be ashamed to see me go, as I do, when every
other man's § comes out, when it’s expected of her, like a bed of
tulips. And for me! why, look at me!” And then the 'foolish woman
supposes I’m to care how many gowns she has, or whether she
has any gown at all. Well, that a woman should be wanting in
proper pride! If she was kept like a blackamoor savage, she ought
to show too much spirit to..name it. For my own part, I was always
above dress: I had, from a child, a strength of mind beyond silk and
satins. And lucky for me, it’s been so. Otherwise, I am sure that
MR. MoUSER—
Notwithstanding, as I have already observed, people should keep
their troubles, like their measles, at home; and not carry 'em from
ouse to house. The same, too, with their conceit., Why, there is
that MRs. MACAw! She would—as she calls it—pour her troubles into
my heart. Trouble; when the foolish creature's as fond of it, as a
little girl with a big doll. MACAw, she says, is so jealous of her: she
Can't look ºut of the window The can't speak toº single creature.
“My dear,” says she to me, “I know it’s only MAQAw's idolatry,
as he calls it when he's in a good humour—his idolatry on the
wrong side. Still you must pity me. I do believe he'd like to lock
me up all day in an iron safe, and take the key out with him |
As I tell him sometimes, I do think he's jealous of the very
house-flies — and, my dear, .."; it is very flattering—we've
been married twelve years next Michaelmas-very flattering ; , still,
you must pity me. I hope, dear MRs. MoUSER, you don't know
from painfuſexperience what a jealous husband is?” And—for I trust
I’ve a proper pride in all things—I smile, and say nothing. But I
remember dear aunt PEAcock. "Jealousy from real love,” she used to
say, “jealousy, AMELLA, is wine turned into vinegar, And—it mayn't
be pleasant—still, if it’s your fate to drink it, take it down as if it was
buttermilk, and don't make the world laugh with your wry faces.”
What a deal I owe to aunt PEAcock! For sometimes—not but what
I hope I’ve too much pride to name it; nevertheless sometimes a saint
herself with MR. MouseR-
Certainly not; no, I shall say nothing—at present—that can in any
way allude to my husband. I hope I have a better pride. Never-
theless, since my visit to the House of Commons; since I had a look
at what is called by MouseR himself the Majesty of Parliament—and
since I heard his Majesty speak—I feel myself an altered woman. A
certain boldness, if I may use the word, a beautiful boldness induces
me to break the silence of a life.
The end of it is this—
I am now determined to give the world A BIT OF MY MIND.
That’s settled. Yours for the present,
The Honeysuckles. AMELIA MoUSER.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
A WORD TO LORD JOHN, UPON A LATE
DEBATE.
IR,-EVERY man who considers
the position of a Minister in
the present day, the ceaseless
calls upon his tongue and his
brains, the daily baiting that
he gets from the bull-dogs
of the House (if one may
so speak of honourable gen-
tlemen), must feel the sin-
cerest compassion for that
itiable being. Now it is
R. DISRAELI who rises and
gives the Noble Lord or the
CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER an airing; then it
is MR. HuME that pours into
him the shafts of his keen
--- sarcasm and polished wit;
| | then it is the acute SIRTHORP
||| | | who makes a butt of him, and
Tººl causes the House to ring with
laughter, at any rate at some-
body's expense : :
night it is an Irish Member who beards, as MR. GRATTAN says, the
inister in his place in the House of Commons, and exposes the wounds
he has made in the bleeding carcass of his country; or on another even-
ing, CoBDEN, BRIGHT, Gibson rise, figures in hand, pelt the Govern-
ment with irresistible arithmetic, and deſy them at the multiplication
table. To each and all the unfortunate Minister has to make some
answer, now to plead for time, now to refuse compliance; to
deny this statement point-blank, and, when particularly hard-pressed,
ingeniously to dodge from the other. Sir, when an eccentric author of
late likened your Lordship to a cock-sparrow or a canary-bird, I thought
to myself what an uncomfortable nest it is that poor bird sleeps in:
what an early bird he must be; what a life he has with all the mis:
chievous boys in the empire pulling at his tail, and the marksmen of
the press and all the sportsmen of #. House of Commons firing at him.
You can't go to take a quiet basin of turtle at the Mansion House but
somebody has a shot, and, as last week, in the midst of a peaceful dessert,
when Non Nobis has been sung, and everybody is tranquil, in full
truce, old CHARLEY NAPIER turns round and fires a stern-gun into you.
Your Lordship will perceive that the tone we adopt is one of good-
nature and tender commiseration for the many exigencies of your
situation, and by no means the tone of anger. Between great powers
such as we two are, a lofty courtesy is becoming, and a salute before
we engage in any dispute. You will remark with what kindness we
have invariably been disposed to treat you. A man so pressed as you,
cannot be supposed to have the best of every encounter. Armed ever so
carefully by anxious subordinates ere you go forth to battle, wadded all
Over } º, Street papers, a man so shot at, you must be hit
somewhere— a champion always called upon to turn out must be
weary, and be upset by, instead of overthrowing his adversary. Thus,
even of ourselves, it is said, `Aliquando bonus, &c.—even of ourselves
it is sometimes remarked, “This week’s Punch is not so uncommonly
brilliant, so tremendously stunning as the last.” Who can be always
right, always fresh and in good health, always a conqueror
Unwilling then to engage a combat with a man who has so many
challenges every day, and is on the ground every evening, we have
waited with some anxiety, and a sincere hope, that you would find
occasion to modify some opinions expressed by you in the House of
Commons the other night, with regard to the greater portion of the
Third Estate of the Realm, and also, that respected Fourth Estate to
which we have the fortune to belong, and the rights and honour of
which we propose most carefully to maintain. When MR. MILNER
GIBSON made his motion last week for the repeal of the excise duty on
paper, and the stamp and advertisement tax on newspapers in one of
the neatest speeches in which truth was ever agreeably administered, he
noticed as a proof that the present press taxes were unjust, not in the
whole.merely, but in the part; clumsy, ineffective, unequal; weighing
heavily upon the honest and useful part of the press, and not operating
upon the dangerous and wicked portion: the fact that while the Stam
duty was paid by all respectable journals which gave the proper .#
wholesome news of the day, and which, indeed, cannot circulate at all
without that passport, numbers of disreputable, scurrilous, indecent,
and ºff. periodicals were printed independent of any stamp at
all, and of course found their way into the houses of the poor who
could not afford to purchase the more costly stamped publication.
And, the hunger for reading being so great and natural that the
poor man will feed upon something (as I have seen poor people
failed them), he has recourse to this poisonous and unwholesome meat,
because, the wholesome food is put beyond his means, by the duty
which, the Government levies, on it. What happened yesterday in
the House of Commons, in England, in France; what MR. GIBson
said in support of his motion for removing press restrictions; what
valuable observations your Lordship supplied as reasons for retaining
them—the poor man must not read without paying his penny to the
State collector: but blasphemy, but indecency, but filthy slander on
private, character, but vulgar romance and Fº but discussions
political, social, religious, more or less, able and honest, or rascally
and incendiary, in which the propriety of every existing institution is
ainsayed, be it our private property, our wives' chastity, the House of
ords, and the Queen's throne, or that of Heaven itself; on all these
W. the market is open to him, and he is free to purchase his meal.
What a dreadful supply it is Can any man walk the streets of our
great towns without being frightened at it? What garbage and poison
stale cast-away scraps, and rotten offalº What huxters to vend it
hat an eager busy crowd
These are rhetorical figures, however, and it is by no means in such
that MR. GIBson deals; his are plain statements and facts. He reads
the Day of Judgment, they must

an extract from one unstamped paper in which the Colonial policy of
the Government is fiercely attacked; from others against the QUEEN
and the Church: and from a fourth in which the necessity of a new
organisation of society is proposed, based on principles not opposed to,
ut in accordance with, nature ? This letter is followed by “laughter”
from the House. The wags! * always, laugh, Be it ruin, anarchy,
augh—the subject is so funny! And
the speaker continues—
“Debarred from recording facts, the conductors of the cheap press were compelled to
rack their brains for something to excite the passions or stimulate the imagination.
Sometimes they did nothing more than act upon the nervous system. There was, for
instance, the Terrific Record;—that was for nervous people. (Laughter.) There was
another weekly paper, which contained a horrible account of a duchess who had been
murdered by a maniac, and another “story of real life,” namely, “the Confessions of a
Countess; or, the Life of LoLA Montes.” (“Hear, hear,” and laughter.) He had been
informed, by an eminent bookseller in Manchester, that he sold over his counter, every
Saturday, 80,000 or 90,000 of these penny publications to the working classes, some of
them political, some imaginative, and some religious. This bookseller told him that he
did not believe there was one in fifty of his customers who did not preter to purchase
the papers containing the leading events of the day, but they could not afford the price.”
Now, what is the reply the First Minister of the country makes upon
this facetious subject, in the midst of this jocular auditory f LoRD
John Russell, says:-
“His right hon. friend had shown the mischief of the unstamped papers, and he read
articles from them to prove their mischievous character; but they seemed to him to be
so like some of the articles in the stamped newspapers (A laugh) that he scarcely knew
the difference. There was a character of Lond GREY read that he almost thought was
written by Jacob OMNIUM, or some of the writers in the daily papers. (A laugh.) For
his part, he could not very much distinguish the difference in the style which the right
hon gentleman wished to point out. The Government did not, as one of the deputations
told him, keep on this tax to prevent knowledge being acquired and conveyed by the
newspapers. He felt no apprehensions of that kind; but he believed that if the tax were
taken off, it would make little difference in the papers."
So, this is the way in which the headman of the country comprehends
the situation 1–Instead of meeting the argument, thrust at him as plain
as a pikestaff, the Government Champion dodges and ducks under it!. He
can't very much distinguish the difference in the style which the Right
Honourable Gentleman wishes to point out; he almost thinks the
character of LoRD GREY is written by JAcoB OMNIUM, or some of the
writers of the daily press! O fiel O for shame !
As for JAcob OMNIUM, that ingenious person can take care of him-
self, and so can the writers in the daily press, too: between whom and
the unstamped publicists the Prime Minister can’t see any difference,—
therefore, the argument no doubt is, one is as good as the other; there-
fore let matters stand as they are; therefore let the Newspaper Stamp
duty remain, and a laugh of course from the House, O fie! O for shame,
we say again.
What, you can’t see that the chief writers of the press in this
country are men whose education is as good as yours, whose talent is
infinitely greater than , yours, who speak more to the point upon all
public questions and in better English, and employ a variety of learning
and acquirement such as not one in a hundred of you, Gentlemen of the
House of Commons, can use P You can’t see the difference between
polished wit, and accomplished style, and skilled logic, and argument
clear and eloquent, and the writings of those who have never had
the leisure to learn the use of these weapons of controversy P. Do
you think, my LoRD JoHN, that you could write three, leading articles
a week for the Times or any other newspaper? The public would snore,
the paper would die under the infliction. . The paper can afford to
tell the truth, you can only face that part of it which suits your party:
the newspaper writer can speak like a philosopher, you but as a par-
tisan; and I know of no spectacle more melancholy than that of a
great man, like SIR, RoRERT PEEL, in the last struggles of the Corn
Law, knowing the right and its inevitable mastery, but hiding from it
and avoiding it; bound "...'." the fatal compact of party-
exigency, until that day when broke from his bondage by a
noble act of revolt and recantation.

country are such that it is impossible to forego the revenue É. uced by the Newspaper

as necessary for them as bread, they must wait awhile until they can have the fair enjoyment
of the former; that though the actual prohibition is productive of infinite present mischief,
and pregnant with awful future evil, the State is so pºor that it can't afford to let Truth go
unraed to those who need it the most; that though they would thrive much better, and do
your work and their own much better, on wholesome mental food, they must go on poisoning
themselves just now, and dealing with their present purveyors; that you and the CHANCELLOR
of the Exchequeſt can see no remedy for this misfortune. It may bring ruin down upon
the whole of us before long; but in the meanwhile we must meet our engagements, and,
ruat celum, the public creditor must have his dividend. And, as a º joker, having
much experience in the business, and desirous to continue it peaceably, let me intreat your

DARKNESS IN ST. DOMINGO.
THE French papers make merry with the poor old mountebank EMPEROR OF ST. Domingo
—a potentate who will, we doubt not, be very truthfully, and withal economically repre-
sented in the English metropolis on the 1st of May, next—giving, with a smirk, a full and
particular account of the pilgrimage of the Emperor and Empress to celebrate a funeral
service for the souls of the Emperor’s father and mother. Besides this solemnity, there
was the ceremony of marriage of the two old negroes, parents of the Empress; who, never
expecting to have a daughter for Empress, never cared for the respectability of the marriage
tie. Well, the daughter is elevated to a throne; and she immediately has a quicker sense
of religious and social decencies: there is, we take it, little to laugh at in this. . It would
: i. worse for the imperial character at large, had the like delicacy ever animated all
lts dolngs.
But the parental shades of the Emperor are to be consulted and honoured. . Whereupon
the Queen º cock-and the priests carrying a kid and sheep-proceed at midnight
into the woods. ck, kid, and sheep are killed, and their mingled blood offered to the souls
of father and mother; which souls are duly fixed by the priests in a vessel of water; and
when fixed, are made to express their thanks for the filial attendance: and further to assure
the sacrificers that they are perfectly comfortable, wanting nothing whatever in the other
world. On this the writer bewails the awful superstition of poor SALoop, THE EMPEROR OF
ST. Domingo!
Very terrible, this—very humiliating ! Suppose we change the scene.
The scene is changed! . It is Naples. A ſéte-day: the ſéte of SAINT JANUARIUs. Where:
upon, with many thousands marvelling at the wonder, and º: themselves that they should
see it, the congealed blood of the Saint thaws in a bottle, and the miracle of the year is per-
formed—“to be continued in the next.”
Doth not SAINT JANUARIUS preach charity for the darkness of poor EMPEROR SALOOP f
PICTURES FOR THE PEERS.
FROM an answer given by the PREMIER to
SIR DE LACY Evans the other day in the
Commons, it appears that the refreshment-room
of the House of Lords is to be decorated with
pictures relating to the Chase. If so, the adorn-
ments of the Lords’ refreshment-room will much
resemble those often met with in that of another
public description of house. . To improve the
similitude, these works of art might be varied
by the introduction of scenes from the Turf, a pas-
time as Jordly as the Chase. “Noblemen Bet-
ting.” “Noblemen Making their Books,” perhaps
“A Nobleman levanting,” would be a propriate
subjects... “The Billiard Table” and #. Dice-
Box” might be added: and in further illustra-
tion of the Amusements of the Nobility, these
paintings might include a view of “CRoCKFORD's
in the Olden Time.” In connexion with the
Chase, we would pictorially elucidate the Game
Laws. ... “The Keeper Shot” and “The Poacher
Hanged” would be lessons in form and colour
—to the Lords. Many of the themes above
proposed are, now simply historical—let us hope
that all of them—especially those of the class
last mentioned—will soon be so too.
“THERE BE LAND PIRATES.”
. GEOGRAPHY now-a-days is fearfully outraged,
in the distribution of the different quarters of
the habitable globe, for we find Calcutta within
five minutes' walk of the Nile; and the Arctic
Regions next door but six to New Zealand,
which is separated from Australia by a narrow
neck of cab-stands.
We like to see these various Exhibitions thriv-
ing, for though they are pretty thickly studded
about the West End, there is instruction and
amusement to be gleaned from every one, and
there is abundant room for all of them. . While,
however, we can only applaud competition in a
good purpose, we object to anything in the
shape of piracy, and protest therefore against the
attempt of a MR. HARVEY-we admire HARVEY's
sauce-to profit by the popularity of the Exhibi-
tion of the Overland Mail, and open a second-
hand “Gallery of Illustration” in another quarter.
We never encourage these attempts, because we
have found from experience that anything, seek-
ing to establish a reputation on the success of
something that has º: before, has usually no
merit of its own to rely upon.
Owing to a series of former ºil.
under similar circumstances, we shall decline
taking the trouble to seek out Gallery of Illus-
tration No. 2, as we do not anticipate that we
shall be repaid for the trouble of a visit.
“Time Flies.”
THIs time-honoured truth has lately received
rather a literal illustration. The large clock over
the hair-dresser's in Qxford Street, has suddenly
disappeared. As it had underneath it the in-
scription “Time flies,” its flighty conduct is at
once accounted for. This is only another proof
of the very great difficulty a public clock has to
keep time. we were asked “what was most
behind the age?” we should say: “Next to Lond
John Russell, a public clock.”
A SPECIAL PLEA.
A Young thief who was charged the other day
with picking pockets, demurred to the indict:
ment, “for that, whereas he had never picked
pockets, but had always taken them just as they
Came.

THE CABINET CURTI
In the middle of St. Stephen's
The pit yawns deep and wide,
And PUNCHIUs, the augur,
Is standing at its side. -
He hath watched the sacred chickens,
Hath marked them turn away
From their official pickings,
For the first time to-day.
And PUNCHIUs hath counted up
The tottle of the whole,
Of auguries and omens,
And scratched his wooden poll;
And after rumination,
From the seat where he doth sit,
Hath risen, in explanation
Of this portentous pit.
“Oh, Place-holders and Ministers,
And Whippers-in of Rome, .
This is Retrenchment's pit that yawns
Beneath St. Stephen's dome.”
'Twas no Association - -
Financial, out of doors,
Nor HUME, nor HENLEY bored it,
Though they be mighty bores.
- - -
It was a little crack at first,
That, in his scornful play,
MARCUs HILLIUs jà leap over,
As he passed to the gang-way.
But still it waxed and widened,
And blacker, deeper, grew;
Till Russiſ. Us, beneath his hat,
Looked bilious and blue.

Till they had cast into it,

Then a scornful laughlaughed RussiLUs,
PALMERSTONIUs sneered,
And the stout tribe of TADPoLII,
They mocked CoBDENIUs' beard." . .
So of the Ordnance Estimates,
And Naval, with regret
Were flung in half a million,
But the pit gaped wider yet;
GRAIUs whispered RussiLUs,
As he looked round on their train,
“What if we fling into it -
A. Treasury Lord or twain?”
. But RussiLUs right sternly chid . . . .
Such radical remarks:
“If victims there must be,” said he,
“Fling in some score of clerks.”
So hapless clerks and messengers,
And all that had no friends,
They pitched in fast and freely—
, But still the pit extends.
Beneath the Treasury benches
It yawneth broad and black, . . . .
Aghast into its entrails -
Gazes each Treasury hack;
And forced up from the centre
By pressure from without,

With poor, hard-working slaves;

And gaping will go on
Until I swallow up this House

REPEAL OF THE ADVERTISEMENT DUTY.
YESTERDAY, an enormous meeting of Advertisers of all denominations,
took place in Palace Yard. MR JENKINs, as representing a class (the
large class of domestic servants) was unanimously bellowed to the Chair.
From what we could gather of the sentiments of the speakers, they
were (in fragments) as follow: - -
“A Wet Nurse, a Respectable Young Woman,” thought it was like
their impudence that she couldn't offer to take chargeint º:
of a precious baby from the month, without paying Eighteen Pence duty
to that LoRD Russell. - -
“A Lady's-Maid turned 20.” who understands hair-dressing and
millinery, gave it upon her honour and word that that Eighteen Pence
was shameful—abominable—and if the QUEEN only knew it—it was her
[the Lady’s Maid's] opinion—HER MAJESTY wouldn't permit it, that
she wouldn’t. -
“A Housekeeper to a Single Gentleman or Tradesman” said they
had only to be Unanimous to put down the Eighteen Pence for ever
and for ever. If they warn’t attended to this time, she gave 'em warm-
ing for her part—let the Ministry look to his windows! (Cheers).
“A Butler in a quiet Family where a Footman is kept,” said, it was
well-known that the Corn Laws was repealed, only that the Eighteen
Pence might go into the Lord Chancellor's pocket. He hoped he
had always been Loyal—always in his own person rallied round the
Altar and the Throne,—but the Eighteen Pence on Advertisements was
a fundamental blow at habeas e . He only hoped—it was his daily
prayer—that he should not be druv to join the Chartists.
: A Footman, single-handed,” said it was hinfamous-
“A Groom, or to Drive a Brougham,” cried—“shabby!”
“A Waiter to an Hotel” asked, if they stood the Eighteen Pence,
“what next were to follow P’’—
And then began a multitudinous roar, hundreds of Advertisements-
advertisers we should say—condemning the Eighteen Pence.
“The Natural Standard of Sherry,” hiccuped “shameful—”
“The Most Approved Stoves” roared “disgusting”—
“The Fverlasting Gold Pen” would write it down—
“A Revolution in Light” would show it up—
“What to Eat,” &c. would not digest it—
And, in fact, every advertising interest—represented and declared
after its peculiar manner-so emphatically denounced the continuation
of the Eighteen Penny Tax on the advertising industry and commerce
of the Country, that-
The noise of the Meeting coming to the ears of the CHANCELLOR or
THE Excheques, whilst in the House, he was seen to bend over to
LoRD, Russell, and heard to say, “I see how it is; we must give
the Eighteen Pence up, 'Tis only a trifle after all—and—yes, I’ll
manage it.”
HOW TO REDUCE TAXATION.
EVERY, one is, anxious to see Taxation reduced, and though nobody
doubts what to do, there is no one who can tell us (or the CHANCELLok
of THE Exchequeſ, which is much the same thing, for what we say
must be done, must be dome-Reader! by the way, be good enough to
excuse this long parenthesis, Lord BRough AM has setus the example)"
how to do it... We have, however, been fortunate enough to hit upon a
few Taxes which may be reduced to the perfect satisfaction of the
public at large, and without afarthing's loss to the revenue. We would
recommend the total abolition of the following Taxes:–
1st, THE TAx—on the patience of the House of Commons, when
MR. URQUHART is addressing it.
2nd. THE TAx—on our time, when we are reading the letters of cor-
respondents enclosingjokes, whose interest is purely antiquarian.
These Taxes throw on the parties subject to them, a burden of the
most onerous kind, and, in fact, we have some idea of sending our boy
as a deputation to the CHANGELLOR or THE Exchequer to represent
the nature of ºur case, and—following the example of everybody else—
ask him what he can do for us. By way of prºpitiating him, we will
give him a hint by which he may take off one Taxagainst which there
is some complaint, and impose another that will be a source of enormous
* In consequence of the length of this it had
of the º g parenthesis, it better be read at the end
revenue. Let him take the tax off knowledge—properly so called—and
lay the tax on º when, if the collection is properly made, the
product would be so immense, that the national debt might soon be
paid off, and cash left in hand to go to market with for another century.
AN EDUCATIONAL NOWELTY.
THE Education Question
is now one of
those numerous
uestions of the
ay, which are
waiting — and
someofthemseem
likely to be kept
waitingsometime
—for an answer.
Some are for
teaching this and
some that, but we
think there can
be no doubt in
the mind of any
one anxious to
train up a child,
that nothing
would be a se-
verer lesson than
N to carry the in-
fantmind through
a regular course
of railway trains
as indicated, in
the ublished
Time-tables. We
- have had Guides
to Knowledge of every kind, but to us a Railway Guide has been
hitherto a guide to ignorance, for we have always risen from a perusal
of that elaborate work with a thorough collision in our brain between
all the Ups and Downs of Life, from the Express to the Parliamentary.
We begin to fear that no one will ever understand a Railway Time:
table, unless he has learnt it in his early youth, for to us it is one of
the dead languages, in which our primaeval pedagogue has omitted to
instruct us. We propose, therefore, for the benefit of the rising
generation, that those tables should'be learnt in time, and thus the
time in the tables may, perhaps, be understood in the days of mature
manhood. We recommend that one of the large monthly sheets of
BRApsHAw should be put up in every school-room, and that the boys
should be divided into three classes, in accordance with railway division,
for the purpose of studying this intricate branch of knowledge. We may
perhaps write an additional chapter, to WALKINGHAM, KEITH, or our
old original friend. Cocker, with the view of furnishing examples of
Railway Arithmetic. The object would be gained by something like
the following:-
No. 1. If the figures 9-35,1-56-8-44 appear º: the parliamentary
train, state when it starts, when it stops, and when it arrives. .
No. 2. If an express train is advertised to be at its destination by
9 o'clock, state how far it will have proceeded on its journey by a
quarter past eleven. -
No. 3. Give the possible number of spoonfuls of a basin of hot soup
that can be swallowed at the Swindon Station. -
No. 4. If a basin of soup costs one shilling, how much is it per
mouthful for all that you have time to demolish?
No. 5. When a train is marked in the time-table as arriving at a
given place at a certain hour, and is stated in the same time-table to
start from a less distant place half-an-hour after its alleged arrival at
the more distant place, how is the difference accounted for?
t *: ; How many times will one engine go into three luggage-
ruc
No. 7. If one third-class carriage is divided by an express train, what
will the passengers come to?
We might multiply these instances ad infinitum, but we leave the
subject for the professional arithmeticians to multiply.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
PUNCH'S HAND-BOOK TO HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE.
UR passport having been vised
at the barrier by one of the
proper officers, who are distin-
guished by no uniform but
uniform politeness, the interior
is at length gained, and we find
ourselves on one of the nu-
merous ranges of boulevards or
ramparts, that lencircle the
Great Operatic Capital.
At convenient distancesalong
the whole line of these boule.
wards guides are stationed, who
are at once in attendance, to
assist the traveller in reach ºn
that particular circle to whic
he brings an introduction; for
though an admission into º:
implies an eligibility for all;
there is nevertheless a choice
of circles suited to the accom-
modation of every rank and of
almost every pocket. There is
in fact, a tier for nearly any
station, including the royaltier
—tºe upper tiers for the tiers
etati and we have even seen
on the distant neights, in the
extreme back ground of the
gallery, arow which might be
denominated the Soldiers' tier,
from the occasional military
occupation of a part of it by
the Sergeants belonging to the
ard of honour; and others
in attendance on the royal
visitors.
The Grand tier is now in
our eye, and such a tier must
not be unceremoniously wiped out by a few words: for it is a tier remarkable for its brilliancy.
It comprises so many attractive features, that the late lamented GeoRGE Robins himself,
whose imagination could have º: Pelion upon Ossa, Olympus on the top of that, the
Apennines over those, with Ben Lomond as a sort of Upper Benjamin to cover the whole-
we repeat that even this master of description would have found, description reduced to a
state of beggary, had he attempted to apply its resources to the locality at which we
have now arrived. He might have been equal to the task of dealing with a shooting-box,
or a little box in the country; but even he must have failed in doing justice to the boxes
of Her Majesty's Theatre. . He would
consisting of the lodge or lºge of the QUEEN herself; but he must inevitably have stumb
at the threshold; and as this ungrateful movement would be quite out of place, in such a
scene as this, we decline taking any further on our trip, a companion who might have been
thus awkwardly caught tripping.
We prefer, therefore, giving the reins to our own Pegasus, and shall at once dash into
the middle of our description of the grand tier, and its inhabitants. The chief ornament
of this circle is the illustrious personage after whom the whole locality is named, and it is
natural that THE QUEEN should be, as it were, identified with the theatre of HERMANEsty.
Though the realms of Opera possess a lyric throne, which is invariably occupied by the
reigning Queen of Song-to whom we shall hereafter allude—there is, nevertheless, an
ºperium in imperio; a Sovereign to whom all the lyrical Queens acknowledge allegiance.
Her present Majesty has succeeded to the empire of the Opera as to a part of the institu-
tions that have grown up under her predecessors, from whom they have been handed down
to her. It has been interwoven with the manners and customs of the people over whom
she rules, and whose visits to the delightful regions of melody contribute much to the culti-
vation of their taste in that art, whose charms are said to have the power of soothing that
turbulent nuisance, “the savage breast,” and, in fact, converting even the bears, the bores,
and the brutes of society into amiable members of a “happy family.”
.The QUEEN instead of rushing to this place or that for the benefit of the waters, the malade,
either real or imaginaire, may profit by drinking in from time to time the liquid harmony
that is continually . gushing forth, during the season, from the numerous springs of
melody that abound in this enchanted spot. In order to preserve the purity and genuine-
ness of the liquid harmony already mentioned, we may º: that it is always supplied
through the channels expressly, adapted by nature for its conveyance, and that nothing
in the *: of a pump is allowed to remain. We will not go so far as to say that no º
has been known in these dominions, for there have been one or two instances of the kind;
but as the pumps want supplying constantly with succour, to enable them to make a
momentary spirt, and are incapable of drawing, they at once cease to act, and are soon wholly
removed. We are, however, passing too rapidly from the inhabitants to the productions of
#: #: and we will say a few words of the brilliant circles into which the traveller is now
Introduced.
Looking to the left on entering, the traveller's eye will light on what may be termed in
guage suited to the locality, the Villa Reale, or royal box. §. this is tenanted, the effect
no doubt have commenced with “the abode of º h
e
is extremely pleasing, for Her Majesty's Theatre,
without HER MAJESTY, seems incomplete; and
though not amounting to a case of Hamlet with
the part of Hamlet left out, there is no denying
that the QUEEN seems never, so thoroughly at
home among her subjects as when enjoying with
them the same elegant entertainment in her own
house. Undisturbed by impertinent or obtrusive
curiosity, she has here an opportunity of mixing
with her people without the gene of Court
etiquette on the one hand, or the annoyance of
boisterous, but well-meant attentions on the
other. Inſthese agreeable regions HERMAJESTY
may see and be seen to the best advantage; for
her graceful emotion at the sorrows of Amina,
her not less becoming relish for the humours of
Don Pasquale, her hearty laughter at the fun of
LABLACHE, her delicate appreciation of the de-
licious singing and exquisite acting of SoNTAG,
her genuine º: of all she sees and hears,
are so many links between herself and those
around her; who find out that, though di-
vided by station from their sovereign, they are
in pleasant sympathies and in honest impulses
of feeling, very closely allied to her. Here, also,
the agreeable discovery has been made that the
Royal children possess the hearty qualities of
their mother, for when the PRINCE or WALEs
and the PRINCEss Royal were introduced to
the dominion of Opera, they, like the QUEEN
herself, were thrown into fits of laughter by
LABLAche, whose compass of voice is almost
equal to his compass of body, and who has had
more real greatness thrunt upon him than any
man alive. No wonder that every one should be
wrapped up in him when he is on the scene,
and that attention should be divided between
SoNTAG's smiles and his size. We ourselves
have got this tremendous object so completely
into our eye, that we must pause to take out this
great dot from our eye before we shall be able
to see our way to proceed further.
Fancy Slop-Fair.
The RE was advertised the other day in the
Times a “Fancy Bazaar,” to be held in the Hanover
Square rooms, “for the benefit of the Ladies’
Rºi. to the Jews at Corfu.” The lady-pa-
tronesses of this religious Fancy Fair may not
ave known, perhaps, that there are places called
Houndsditch and Duke's Place, rather nearer
to Hanover Square than Corfu, and containing
altogether perhaps more Jews, whose conversion
—to any honest persuasion—would, like an
Adelphi melodrama, be, “of strong domestic
interest,” instead of merely concerning foreigners.
But a Fancy Bazaar would be of more service to
our Needlewomen than to our Israelites; and if
charitable ladies would sell shirts for their in:
digent sisters, they would doubtless obtain prices
for those manufactures as fair—very nearly-as
themselves.
The Last NAUTICAL ROMANCE.
THE Admiralty alleges that there is not space
enough in the ward-room for the naval assistant-
surgeons. -
to the Lords of the Admiralty, and respectfully
recommends them to tell that to the Marines.

“These carriages, how-
\ ever, are very far from per-

drawbacks, I will mention
one: THE LADIEs.
“I maintain that Ladies
have no right in Omnibuses
at all. They never were in-

no Lady had, the face to get
into an Omnibus. She would

natum-or any one of our
clubs. Omnibuses, I lay
down, were built for men,
and by men they ought ex-
clusively to be filled.
. “At present Ladies are
interlopers—intruders—and
I should not wonder if in
time they do not make it a
favour to let us ride in our
own vehicles. As it is, I
never get into an Omnibus
that I see filled with the
lovely sex. I could no more
do it than Icould passtheday

“In the first place, I de-
test babies in *H shape—
- - quiet or noisy. If they are
quiet, they º with your shirt-frill, or your watch-chain—if they are noisy, they kick your
trowsers and clutch your whiskers. -
“Now, Sir, it is pretty evident, that if there were no Ladies in an Omnibus, there would
be no babies. By excluding the one, you virtually slam the door in the face of the other. I
would have babies pay double fare, and twins should not be admitted at any price. -
“There are other complaints, however, just as loud as the babies;-which I do not object
to, if they happen to be asleep, and you are not requested to hold them on your lap. ..But a
Lady takes up twice as much room as a gentleman, Look at her dress! What with her
hoops, and her flounces, and pelisses, victorines, mantalines, crinolines, and a thousand other
lines, Idefy her not to take room for two, at least. The consequence is, we have to suffer. If
there are two Ladies on the same side, you will see the gentlemen run up into a corner at the
end, packed together as tight as a pack of ºards. -
“Besides, every Lady who gets into an Qmnibus has an inseparable attachment for a
bundle, a bandbox, a birdcage, and a parcel of some sort or other, which ought properly
to have gone by the Parcels' Delivery Company. These parcels are always in the gentlemen's
way—and if you happen to put your foot accidentally into a bandbox, you are sure never to
hear the last of it, till you have left the Omnibus. Do what you will to oblige the women,
they are never satisfie - -
“There is but one remedy for this state of things, Sir, and with your leave I now hasten to
LET THE LADIES HAVE AN OMNIBUs To THEMSELVEs
“There are carriages exclusively for the Ladies on the railways, why should not the same
system be adopted in the streets with our public vehicles?
“The conductor should be a Lady—the driver should be a Lady. - -
"The roof inside might be ornamented with baby jumpers—or else the roof outside provided
with cradles—for the convenience of the dear babies.
: The interior should be lined with looking-glasses.
: Accommodation might be given for knitting, sewing, and crochet-work. -
“At the end of the vehicle, should be exhibited on an embossed card, with little raised
Cupids kissing one another, and tastefully decorated with ribbons, the following placard:–
No ScANDAL AILowed.
“To prevent disputes, every Lady should pay her fare on getting in, and no money to be
returned upon the Lady suddenly discovering she is going in an opposite direction to that
which she intended.
“A stringent law should be made that no Lady is to keep the Qmnibus waiting more than five
minutes, while she is searching in every pocket, bag, and reticule, “for her change.”
: Qnly one bundle to be allowed to each Lady.
“A separate Omnibus to run every Saturday and Monday, for the convenience of washer-
women and their baskets.
“A whole dictionary of names will instantly suggest itself for such Omnibuses. There is
Paradise,’. The Boudoir, “The Nursery,’ ‘The Parasol,’ ‘The Reindeer,’ ‘The Bonnet-
box,’ ‘The Whispering Gallery; ‘The Ladies’ Drawing Room,” (for such it literally would be,)
and many more, which I shall be happy to supply.
“I am sure such a vehicle would º hailed by all classes—but by the Ladies more especially
-as an immense improvement upon our present º of mixed Omnibuses. It would be
pleasanter for the es, and much more comfortable to the gentlemen. The former would
avoid . insults and robberies, and the latter
a hundred inconveniences in the shape of wet
umbrellas, dirty pattens, and teething ...”

‘to go outside (during a shower of rain) to

Farming Uncle. “You Don’t see such Muck As THIS IN LONDON, BEN ?”
Cockney Nephew. “Oh, DoN'T we, Though. You should see EATON SQUARE!”
GOLDEN LONDON.—A CIVIC SUPERSTITION.
A Few days ago, the MAyor of HASTINGs reciprocated dinner with
the LoRD MAYOR OF LONDON ; hospitality, intelligent, and agreeable.
We hope that his Lordship, ere his twelvemonth's reign shall cease,
will dine throughout England. Hoping this, we, however, protest
against the presence of ALDERMAN HUMPHERY at any future country
festival. The Alderman is, no doubt, an excellent man; but, to use a
gº." recently employed by the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE to Miss
SELLON (and was ever letter written nobler than that of plain Lord
John's P. so courteous—so grave—so gentlemanly—so parentall)—
“some of the darkest and most dangerous prejudices of men arise from
the most honourable principles.”. Superstition is of these—and shock-
ing, and very dangerous, however amiable in its intentions, is, the
.." enounced by ALDERMAN HuMPHERY to the guileless,
believing denizens of Hastings; who, when they had drunk “the
Corporation of London,” were addressed by the pride of London's
Aldermen, HUMPHERYs, saying these dark, benighted words : —
"Country people and young people are taught that when they visit
London #: will find the streets paved with gold. It Is TRUE | The
streets of that great city ARE PAVED witH goLD, and you have proof
to-day that ANY MAN who goes to London will find it so, whose course
is marked by industry, honour, and religion.”
Oh! HUMPHERy, and is this really true? Is it a great, lustrous
fact, or only so much moonshine? Are Cheapside flags gold, bright,
glittering gold to any man who, commanding the alchemic agents of
industry, honour, and religion, may choose to transmute the º:
into virgin metai? Are industry, honour, and religion invariably the
successful, graces of life, upraising, crowning, and cherishing their
votary and believer? ... Does industry never fail? Is the Gazette in-
variably the Fº of the sluggard? Does no one except the knave
stand abashed in Basinghall Street? Is it the scoffer alone whose
want of faith is punished with want of goods f. May any man—
judicious and prosperous HUMPHERy—endue himself with the miniver
of the Alderman? Do industry, honour, and religion alone officially
quaff punch and lap turtle in the Hall of Egypt?
Think again, oh Alderman 1. In the sagacious exercise of your magis-
terial functions, there must at some time have stood at ài. bar, a
miserable man, foiled in his best attempts at work—a man with purest
character-a man, whose uncomplaining patience under sharpest misery,
betokened that Christian faith in the future that half-vanquished the
terrible present. This man wants food; the shelter of a roof; the
decency of covering against the honest sense of shame as against the
elements. , And yet it is his own sin that makes him a wretch; it is
his own inherent want of good qualities that degrades him to a pauper.
There are London stones—and he will not help himself. All London
Aldermen are, more or less, alchemists: but the Guildhall knave has
no powers of projection; he is a penniless outcast, because he has
neither industry, nor honour, nor religion 1
This is the superstition of success—a superstition too frequently
written, in a cheque-book. With some men, the great account of
human life is the account at their bankers.

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE SECOND.
BEING A BIT OF MRs. MOUSER's POLITICS.
AUNT PEAcock, who was never wrong, was never more right than
when she said—and how I remember the day ! It was before I married
MouseR; and it was the first time he had ever seen me shed a tear,
and really he seemed as proud of it as if it had been a diamond of the
purest water—which of course it was, coming as it did from a young,
a loving, and a maiden heart, and it being dropped for him, he was
quite conceited about it, when aunt Peacock – and I shall never
forget her solemn countenance—said, “AMELIA, you foolish thing !
where’s your proper pride Couldn't you see that ALFRED’—that's
MoUser's Christian name, and it isn't for me, after these years, to say
it’s a name too noble for him, which aunt Peacock, I remember,
once hoped it wasn't—“couldn't you see that the creature, when you
would in that headlong manner drop a tear because he would be jealous
of young TARLINGTON, not that he felt any more real jealousy than the
lion's head upon the knocker—couldn't you see that he was quite
proud of your trouble f That upon that one tear he stood at least six
inches higher ?”
No; I couldn't see it: for I was then young—not that I mean to
say I am old at this moment; certainly not: I should say quite the
reverse; as I gave MR. MouseR himself to understand only yester-
day, when, looking at my new gown, he took it upon himself to wonder
what colour it was.
“Why,” said I, “my dear,” believing he felt all the pride it is a
husband's duty to feel, when he sees the wife of his bosom in anything
mew—not that I believe MouseR would sometimes notice me (but then,
to be sure, it’s all his aggravation) if I was to go like the Queen of
the Gold Coast, in ...; and cockatoo's feathers—“why,” said I,
“what do you think the colour is ?”
Then he shook his head as if he didn't care to guess. “Look at it,”
said I; “isn't it beautiful? Well, them, the colour is this—quite a
new thing-peach-blossoms shot with silver-grey.”
“Indeed!” said MoUser, and I could see his face twitch, and the
corners of his mouth crisp up as they always do when anything wicked’s
coming from him—and sometimes—not that I wish to say anything
against MQUSER—sometimes he cares no more for people's feelings,
than a wild boar cares for a rose-bush.
“Indeed,” said he, “peach-blossoms shot with silver-grey ! Wery
proper; and quite suiting your time of life, MRs. MouseR; for you
know, my dear,”—for that 's the way he sometimes covers the sting with
the honey—"you know that your peach-blossoms, not but what you’re
ſº still "-whereupon I told him to keep his compliments to
n
imself; I wanted none of 'em—“you know, my darling”—and some-
times, when he's in that humour, he’ll skip from dear to darling, and
perhaps to angel afore you can look—“you know, my bird of Paradise,
that your peach-blossoms have long since been shot with silver-grey;
dead shot, I should say, and no recovery.”
Now, There was a time, when, at only a syllable of this, Ishould have
gone to my room, and cried. But, I flatter myself, I have put down that
weakness with a hand of adamant. No : for I have treasured and im-
proved upon the words of dear aunt, PEAcock. “Women, AMELIA,”
said that dear soul to me, “women, like the lordly elephants, are made
what they are by men only for this reason; the foolish creatures don’t
know their own strength. Nature has done everything for 'em, and
they will throw themselves away—they won't do anything for them-
selyes. All the world’s at their feet, and, instead of making the most
of it for their own advantage, and their own comfort, what do they do?
Why, they take the world in their two hands, if I may so say it, and
give it away from 'em with themselves into the bargain. They put
chains upon their own wrists, and—well, I’ve no patience with 'em—
and think slavery becomes 'em. If they only knew their own strength
wouldn’t they cut the cards and play the game a little differently i
Yes, . my dear,”-poor aunt PEAcock would say—“ever since that
first apple was bit, haven’t the men, out of ver
sunnyside of the pippin to themselves?”
I say to MouseR, bitter as aloes.
owever, for the time the world's going to last, it’s quite worth
mending it, and it’s my opinion—and I’m quite prepared to be laughed
at, gracious knows! I’ve been pretty well seasoned to that by MouseR;
not that I would speak against MouseR; it doesn’t b-come me, thou
his jokes, as he calls.’em, have no respect for his wife,’specially the wife
I’ve been to him—it’s my opinion, that, if the world is to be mended
at all, it’s the women only that can properly do it. Doesn’t it stand
to reason f Here have the men been having the world to themselves
thousands and thousands of years—all to themselves, as if the world
was no more than a bowl of punch, ladling out all the good of it for
their own pleasure—and pretty creatures they’ve often shown them-
selves, when they’ve got more of the good than has really been good
for 'em-ladling out as much as they liked, and the poor women put
spite, always kept the
And it’s true—a truth, as
aside-snubbed, neglected, sent to tea and muffins, anything to be got rid
of This is the way the men have ruled the world ever since they first
put their foot in it, never so much as letting the women call their souls
their own property; and in many places—for it’s dreadſul to look at a
globe (I have one in the parlour), and to turn it over and over, and see
what little specks there are, no more than I may say pins'-points in that
thirty-six-inch globe, whereupon woman has any rights at all—though,
gracious knows! she has next to none here. To be sure, in Christian
countries, the men laugh at us—for, as I’ve often told MouseR, l know
they don’t mean it—laugh at us, and call us their better halves.
“Better halves,” said aunt PEAcock once-she had been talking of
Turkey, where every man, she said, lived by a flowing river, with a
sack in the house—“if we’re only better halves here, what are the
poor things in Constantinople? Of course, a man-I mean an Otto-
man, or some monster of the sort—a man with eight wives hardly
considers 'em his better sixteenths' " - - -
I do declare when I sometimes look at that thirty-six-inch globe—it
was a birth-day gift the first year I left school; but I was simple and
trusting, and by no means looked at the globe with the same eyes I do
now—when I sometimes consider it and twirl, it round and round, now
Circassia, and dropping a tear for my white ones, and now at North
America, and heaving a sigh for the dear red daughters of our first
ill-used, and, as I really believe, persecuted mother—for after all,
who can say what she had to put, up with, with no witnesses
by?—when, I say, I consider the globe in this manner, and think
of the poor souls the women upon it—there’s the dear Exquimaux
things that, as I am credibly informed, go seal-fishing, while their
lazy husbands do nothing but stop at home, drinking peach-brandy
and smoking pig-tail tobacco—when I consider this, as I do, when
| MouseR-that lord of the creation—is, for what I know, playing
at billiards—I am the more and more determined that the world can
never be put right, until women take it into their own hands, and roll
it after their own hearts! And this is what I remarked to MouseR and
—no, I won't say, for whatever his faults are, still he's my husband;
andſ took him with his faults, though I may be allowed to observe, if
I had thought he’d had half the number I’d have seen him not at the
altar before I—but however, women—at least up to this time, were
But—it’s not going to last.
I have been to Parliament—into the very House of Commons. I told
MoUser I would, and I’ve done it." - - ---
Well, the hypocrisy of men all over the world, 'specially the civilized;
for, after all, the savages are really and truly more of the gentlemen.
They mean what they say towards the sex, and act up to it; they don't
call the suffering creatures lilies, and roses, and angels, and jewels of
| life, and then treat 'em as if they were weeds of the world, and pebbles
of the highway. But with civilized nations—as I fling it at MouseR-
they all of 'em make women the sign-post pictures of everything that 's
beautiful, and behave to the dear originals as if they were born
simpletons.
“Look at Liberty, MR. MoUs ER,” said I. “Well, you want to
make Liberty look as lovely as it can be done, and what do you do?
Why you’re obliged to come to woman for the only beautiful Liberty
that will serve you. You paint and stamp Liberty as a woman, and
then—but it’s so like you—then you won't suffer so much as a single
petticoat to take her seat in the House of Commons.
“And next, MouseR”—for I would be heard-" and next, you want
the figure of Justice. Woman again! There she is, with her balance
and sword, as the sort of public-house sign for law, but—is a poor
woman allowed to wear false hair, and put a black gown upon her back,
and so much as once open her mouth in the Queen's Bench P. May she
put a tippet of ermine on herself—may she eyen find herself in a Jury?
h, no: you can paint Justice, and cut her in stone, but you never let
the poor thing say a syllable. - - -
“But that’s the way, MoUSER—and I will go on—that’s the way we
are handed about the world in signs: to be looked at and talked about,
and there an end. What would England do, without a woman with a
three-pronged fork to protect it? They call BRITANNLA—I have heard
you do it, and don't deny it—the genius of the country. Poor soul! if
that’s to be a genius, to be talked of and sung about, and not to have
a morsel of ... if that’s to be a genius–
“But—I tell you—I have been in the House of Commons. And I
will say this, I went up into the gallery with—no, I won't at the present
tell you my feelings. But I will say this. How our good QUEEN–and
if I’d my way there shouldn’t be another King in the world; no, they
gh should all be Queens, like Queen Liberty, Queen Justice, Queen Mercy,
and so forth—how our good QUEEN, after the times she’s looked at the
Parliament, and after the speeches she’s made to them—how she must
look down upon the Lords (I mean of the creation) of the Parliament
assembled.”

- - Middle-aged Gentleman.
Why, you see, my dear, Par-
liament is made up of gentlemen that belong to different religions, and not one of
them, except a few, will vote for any school unless his own religion is taught in it.
So the poor little girls and boys can't be taught anything because the sects can't
settle their differences.
Little Boy. What differences, Papa?
Middle-aged Gentleman. I can’t explain them to you. You couldn’t understand
them. They don’t signify to little boys of your age. -
Little Boy. Then, Papa, what do they signify to the poor little boys and girls?
Middle-aged Gentleman. Ehf-why–a–just so—that is—never mind. You’ll
know one of these days.
Little Boy. But what becomes of the poor boys and girls, Papa?
Middle-aged Gentleman. Why, they plunder and steal, and then they are taken up,
and imprisoned and whipped, and by-and-by transported, and at last some of them

Middle-aged Gentleman. Nobody’s in particular. It is because Society can’t agree.
Little Boy. Who is Society, Papa?

since the days, when the winds blew and cracked their cheeks on Dover Cliff, and
BoreAs split his sides in wild guffaws at the expense of poor old LEAR. It is said
that thirty thousand pounds’ worth of windows have n smashed, and it has
become a privilege to be allowed—after an appointment of several days' standing—an
audience of your glazier. The Dublin tradesmen declare loudly that the breeze has
been raised by the rumour of the approaching abolition of the Vice-Royalty, and
that this blow to their trade has been appropriately produced by the blowing out
of their, windows. Those who are always busying themselves about “What’s in
the wind?” are now told that indignation at the breaking up of an imitation Court
was decidedly in the wind during the late tempest. We don't see why Boreas
should give himself such airs about a sensible resolution of the Government, but we
cannot be surprised at the Prince of Puffers taking up the cause of the tradesmen

Oh, he was the man, when wild they ran,
To tail his dogs home in a crack;
No odds scent or weather, he kept them together,
On his hard-mouthed Treasury hack.
No hound so young could e'er give tongue,

But, with lash or look, BILLY brought him to book,

Old BILLY was safe to be found!
All covers he’d draw, and too much law
No fox got where BILLY came ; .
No matter what scent crossed the line they went,
He kept the pack to their game.
And to crown the run, when the sport was done,
You was safe a death to see, -

And I’d bet a pot, he 'arned all he got,

Essays AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFIC0.
II.-ON THE PLEASURES OF BEING A FOGY.
HILst I was riding the other day
by the beautiful Serpentine River
upon my excellent friend HEAvy-
sIDE's grey cob, and in company
of the gallant and agreeable
AUGUSTUs TopLADY, a carriage
F. from which looked out a
ace of such remarkable, beauty,
that AUGUSTUs and myself quick-
ened our pace to follow the ve-
hicle, and to keep for awhile
those charming features in view.
My beloved and unknown young
friend who peruse these lines, it
was very likely your face which
attracted your humble servant;
recollect whether you were not
in the Park upon the day I allude
to, and if you were, whom else
could I mean but you? I don't
know your name; I have for-
gotten the arms on the carriage
or whether there were any; an
as for women's dresses, who can
kind countenance was so pretty
and good-humoured and pleasant
to look at, that it remains to this
day faithfully engraven on my heart, and I feel sure that you are as good
as you are handsome. Almost all handsome women are good: they
cannot choose but be good and gentle with those sweet features and
that charming graceful figure. A day in which one sees a very pretty
woman should always be noted as a holyday with a man, and marked
with a white stone. In this way, and at §. season in London, to be
sure, such a day comes seven times in the week, and our calendar, like
that of the Roman Catholics, is all Saints' days.
ToPLADY, then, on his chesnut horse, with his glass in his eye, and
the tips of his shiny boots just touching the stirrup, and your slave, the
present writer, (who by the way is rather better and younger looking
than the designer has made him) rode after your carriage, and looked at
you with such notes of admiration expressed in their eyes, that you
remember you blushed, you smiled, and then began to talk to that very
nice-looking elderly lady in the front seat, who of course was your
Mamma. You turned out of the ride—it was time to go home and
dress for dinner-you were gone. . Good luck go with you, and with
all fair things which thus come and pass away!
Top caused his horse to cut all sorts of absurd capers and caracoles
by the side of your carriage. He made it dance upon two legs, then
upon other two, them as if he would jump over the railings and crush
the admiring nursery-maids and the rest of the infantry. I should
think he got his animal from BATTY's, and that, at a crack of WIDDI-
COMB's whip, he could dance a quadrille. He ogled, he smiled, he
took off his hat to a Countess's carriage that happened to be sing
in the other line, and so showed his hair; he grinned, he kissed his little
finger-tips and flung them about as if he would shake them off–
whereas the other party, on the grey cob—the old gentleman-pow-
dered along at a resolute trot, and never once took his respectful eyes
off you while you continued in the ring.
hen you were gone (you see by the way in which I linger about
you still, that I am unwilling to part with you) ToPLADY turned round
upon me with a killing triumphant air, and stroked that impudent little
tuft he has on his chin, and said—“I say, old boy, it was the chesnut
she was looking at, and not the guay.” And I make no doubt he
thinks you are in love with him to this minute.
“You silly young jackanapes,” said I; “what do I care whether she
was looking at the grey or the chesnut I was thinking about the
girl; you were thinking about yourself, and be hanged to your vanity!”
And with this thrust in his little chest, I flatter myself f. young
ToPLADY, that triumphant careering rider.
It was natural that he should wish to please; that is, that he should
wish other people to admire him. Augustus Topºny is young (still)
and lovely. It is not until a late period of life that agenteel young
fellow, with a Grecian nose and a suitable waist and whiskers, begins
to admire other people besides himself.
That, howeyer, is the great advantage which a man possesses whose
morning of life is over, whose reason is not taken prisoner by any kind
of blandishments, and who knows and feels that he is a FOGY. As an
old buck is an odious sight, absurd, and ridiculous before gods and
men; cruelly, but deservedly, quizzed by you young people, who are

Fogy is a worthy and amiable member of society, and a man who gets
both respect and liking.
Even in the lovely sex, who has not remarked how painful is that
priod of a woman's life when she is passing out of her bloom, and
thinking about giving up her position as a beauty? What sad injustice
and stratagems she has to perpetrate during the struggle ! She hides
away her daughters in the school-room, she makes them wear cruel
inaſores, and dresses herself in the garb which they ought to assume.
he is obliged to distort the calendar, and to resort to all sorts of
schemes and arts to hide, in her own person, the august and respectable
marks of time. Ah! what is this revolt against nature but impotent
blasphemy Is not Autumn beautiful in its appointed season, that we
are to be ashamed of her and paint her yellowing leaves pea-green P Let
us, I say, take the fall of the year as it was made, seremely and sweetly.
and await the time when Winter comes and the nights shut in. I
know, for my part, many ladies who are far more agreeable and more
beautiful too, now that they are no longer beauties; and, by converse,
I have no doubt that TopLADY, about whom we were speaking just
now, will be a far pleasanter person when he has given up the practice,
or desire, of killing the other sex, and has sunk into a mellow repose as
an old bachelor or a married man.
The great and delightful advantage that a man enjoys in the world,
after he has abdicated all pretensions as a conqueror and enslaver o
females, and both formally, and of his heart, acknowledges himself to
be a Fogy, is that he now comes for the first time to enjoy and appre-
ciate duly the society of women. For a young man about town, there is
only one woman in the whole city—(at least very few indeed of the
young Turks, let us hope, dare to have two or three strings to their
wicked bows)—he goes to ball after ball in pursuit of that one person;
e sees no other eyes but hers; hears no other voice; cares for no
other petticoat but that in which his charmer dances: he pursues her
—is refused—is accepted and jilted: breaks, his heart, mends it, of
course, and goes on again after some other beloved being, until in the
order of fate and nature he marries and settles, or remains unmarried,
free, and a Fogy. Until then we know nothing of women—the kind-
ness and refinement and wit of the elders; the artless prattle and dear
little chater of the young ones; all these are hidden from us
until we take the Fogy’s degree: may, even perhaps from married
men, whose age and gravity entitles them to rank amongst Fogies;
for every woman, who is worth anything, will be jealous of her
husband up to seventy or eighty, and always prevent his intercourse
with other ladies. But an old bachelor, or better still, an old widower,
has this delightful entrée into the female world: he is free to come, to
go: to listen: to joke: to sympathise: to talk with mamma about her
plans and troubles: to pump from Miss the little secrets that gush so
easily from her pure little well of a heart: the ladies do not géner them-
selves before him, and he is admitted to their mysteries like the Doctor,
the Confessor, or the Kislar Aga. - - -
What man who can enjoy this pleasure and privilege ought to be in-
different to it? If the society of one woman is delightful, as the young
fellows think and justly, how much more gelightful is the society of a
thousand One woman, for instance, has brown eyes, and a geological
or musical turn; another has sweet blue eyes, and takes, lºtus say, the
GoRHAM side of the controversy, at present pending; a third darling,
with long fringed lashes hiding eyes of hazel, lifts them up ceiling-
wards in behalf of Miss SELLON, thinks the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE has
hit the poor young lady very hard in publishing, her letters, and
proposes to quit the Church next Tuesday or Wednesday, or when-
ever MR, ORIEL is ready—and, of course, a man may be in love
with one or the other of these. But it is manifest . that brown
eyes will remain brown eyes to the end, and that, having no other
interest but music or geology, her conversation on those points
may grow more than sufficient. SAPPHIRA, again, when, she has said
her say with regard to the GoRHAM affair, and proved that the other
party are but Romanists in disguise, and who is interested on no other
subject, may possible tire you—so may HAZELLA, who is working altar-
cloths all day, and would desire no befter martyrdom than to walk bare-
foot in a night procession up Sloane Street and home by Wilon Place,
time enough to get her poor meurtris little feet into white satin slippers
for the night's ball—I say, if a man can be wrought up to rapture, and
enjoy bliss in the company of any one of these young ladies, ºr any other
individuals in the infinite variety of Miss-kind—how much real sym-
ahy, benevolent pleasure, and kindly observation may he enjoy, when
º is allowed to be familiar with the whole charming race, and behold
the brightness of all their different eyes, and listen to the sweet music
of their various voices!
ENGLAND’s GOOD NAME.
OUR late proceedings in Greece have induced foreign nations to make
a little alteration in our national nick-name, by adding a letter to it.

A HINT FROM HER MAJESTY.
WE do not often peruse with very intense
interest the lucubrations of that ener-
getic historian, the Court newsman, who
chronicles from day to day the walks,
the drives, and the dinners of Royalty.
Like Othello, we are “not much moved”
by the perusal of the tale, how this stick
has succeeded that stick, how this lady
has relieved the other lady, or how His
Excellency the BARON HoBANOR was
the only addition — and, in Tussaud
phraseology, “a magnificent addition,”
we dare say—to the party of Royalty.
We are quite sure HER MAJESTY
takes no delight in the perusal of these
paragraphs; for which of us would wish
to have published to the world the
details of our every-day life, embracing
such facts as our having, on such a day, “entertained MR. and MRs.
Jon Es at a leg of mutton dinner,” or that in the afternoon we had
“taken our usual airing on the halfpenny steamboat?” Though our
vanity might be a little Tickled at first by perusing in print the announce-
ment that we had received a few friends to tea, we should soon get tired
of what might be termed our Household Narrative, when we found
such paragraphs as “The charwoman has relieved the housemaid in
SABBATH-POST PENITENTIAL MEETING.
NEXT to being in the right, is the graceful and penitent confession of
having been in the wrong. This confession is about to be made some
day next week, by a large number of distinguished merchants, bankers,
solicitors, and others—by the same men who, two or three months
back, held meetings for the charitable purpose of denouncing Rowland
HILL as one of the wicked, as a man determined upon the desecration
of the English Sabbath, and with it the perdition of the souls of thou-
sands of the doomed ones employed in the Post-Office. Art had been
called in to awaken the indignation of the country, and envelopes with
a portrait of Rowland HILL, garnished with horns and tail, was seen
emptying from a bag a shower of letters upon a church steeple—more
fatally struck than was ever steeple struck by lightning—by Sabbath
foolscap. It was in vain that LoBD RUSSELL sought to guarantee the
peacefulness of the Sabbath—LoRD RusseIL was not believed; and
very much the “merchants, bankers, solicitors.” &c., applauded them-
selves in the charitableness of such incredulity. Since the first ass
cropped his first meal of antediluvian thistles, there had never been
such multitudinous braying, as that hee-hawed at public meetings, and
through newspaper columns. And now-biding his time-MR. Row-
LAND HILL º: published a Report, convicting the “merchants,
bankers, solicitors,” &c., of the most needless violence—of the most
unchristianlike abuse of a man to whom civilisation owes an immense
amount of debt—a, debt that from land to land will go on increasing:
We borrow from the Times the subjoined analysis of the “Report.”
in question:—
waiting,” or that “the children took their customary donkey-ride in
the Park.”
We, however, did notice in the Court Circular, of Friday last, a para-
- - - -
graph from which some profit may be derived. ... In the midst of a series
of announcements respecting the birth-day of the PRINCEss ALICE, we
came to the following:—
“At five o'clock in the afternoon HER MAJESTY received a small juvenile party, &c.
The QUEEN, accompanied by the Royal children, received the youthful visitors in the
saloon, in which the juveniles danced, and afterwards proceeded to the library, where
refreshments were served. The juvenile party left the Palace soon after seven
o'clock.”
Here is an admirable example to those who are in the habit of giving
children's parties, commencing at eight or nine p.m., and terminating
at one or two. in the morning, when the jaded juveniles crawl away
with at least six months’ health taken out of them by late hours, excite-
ment and fatigue. The QUEEN, as a mother and a sensible woman,
knows when “it is time that all good children should be in bed,” as the
nurse's saying, goes, and she most properly sets herself above the
fashionable foolery, of half killing children under the pretext of amusing
them., The juvenile party at the Palace was short and sweet, beginning
early, breaking up in good time, and not interfering in the least with
the usual hours that ought to be observed in all well-regulated
IeS.
The visitors were kept long enough to be entertained, but not long
enough to be worn out, and we dare say they enjoyed themselves in
roportion to the good sense shown in providing for their amusement.
he example is an excellent one, and we hope it will have its effect
when the time comes round for cooping up a number of little children
in hot rooms at unreasonable hours, for the gratification of a bevy of
misguided mothers looking on with rapture at their offspring mimicking
the fooleries of their elders in a spirit, of premature apishness, which
makes even childhood offensive—and that is saying a very great deal
indeed. For once we congratulate the Court historian on having ful.
filled the province of history—that of teaching by example—and the
higher the example the more profitable is the lesson likely to be.
Liston Redivivus.
We thought never more to hear of a once celebrated farce, rendered
famous in its day by the acting of LISTON in the principal character.
But only last week the Times announced that the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER had
“Received, from ‘X. Y. Z, Bank-notes, value £400, which he will place to the credit
of the public.”
Surely this is the farce of X. Y. Z, and the chief actor in it is
Neddy Bray, -
The End of the Sea-Serpent.
Wº left. our old friend dragging his slow length along up the
Beaufort River in Carolina, with a party of the “Free and Independent”
on their way to blow him out of the water with a couple of ten-
pounders. ...They sailed-they loaded; they saw the monster at a
distance; they primed—they were just going to fire—when they found
“Mr. Hill had always stated that the necessity for the extra labour would be brief.
On Sunday, the 28th of October, the additional London force of 25 men was first em-
ployed; on the 6th of January following it was reduced to 13; on the 13th of the same
month to 3, and on the very next Sunday it was dispensed with altogether, having
effected its object within the space of three months.
“By the device and execution of these measures 576 provincial post-offices have expe-
rienced a total positive relief of about 74 hours each Sunday, and upwards of 4000
dependent offices have received a similar relief of about 7 hours. Estimated in relation
to individuals, the effect of the measures has been to give to 5829 persons an average Sunday
relief of 5; hours each; that is to say, nearly 6000 people have been relieved from nearly
6 hours' work every Sunday by the operation of a scheme which was denounced as a
deliberate encouragement to Sabbath-breaking and profanity. The Sunday force regu-
larly employed in the Post-Office before the famous provisions of MR. Rowland Hill's
scheme amounted to 27 men. On the first day of operations under the new system this,
to the scandal and horror of the public, was increased to 52. To be sure, some 4000 or
5000 were relieved in other quarters by the same regulation, but this little compensation
was altogether overlooked in the great iniquity. But what followed? Not only was
this additional force dispensed with in toto before three months had passed, but its
labours had even contributed to lighten the lot of those who still remained. So well did
the new arrangements act, that the work of the original force began gradually and
steadily to diminish, and we are now officially told that ‘the whole Sunday force ordi-
narily employed in the London office will be reduced to five or six men, which, even
with the addition of the 10 clerks employed in the mail trains (and their duties will
intrench but little on the observances of the Sunday), will make a total force of little more
than half that employed before the 28th of October last.”
Punch has some satisfaction in the recollection that at the outset he
met the folly, the abuse, and—in some cases, he may add—the phari-
saical puritanism of the brawlers with argument and with laughter.
Well, very much are the “merchants, bankers, solicitors,” and others,
ashamed of themselves; and they propose to meet next week-place
and time will of course be advertised—and read MR. HILL's Report,
and then and there express their penitence, for the hard epithets that,
in their ultra purity, they again and again bestowed upon him.
Further, they will then—in token of repentance—walk bare-headed
in procession to the Post-Office, and read to MR. RowlanD HILL a
confession of their injustice.
Further, they will beg of MR. Row1AND HILL to accept a bracelet
for MRs. Rowland HILL–a bracelet set with *:::: in form of a snake
with its tailin its mouth, typical in this case of repentant slander that-
eats its own words.

MAXIMS AND DISPATCHES OF FIELD MARSHAL
WIDDICOMB.
URELY peace should be encouraged, if
it is only for its economy. How
much cheaper it is than war! Peace
requires no double band, no outlay of
brass, no blue-fire, no saltpetre, no
smoke—and War is all smoke, it is
the smoke that costs the money. A
War that should consume its own
smoke, would be a great boon—es-
pecially as the babies in the pit would
not cough so much, when I am ad-
dressing my gallant troops, previous
to leading them on to victory.
Victory ! it is but the flash of a
second — a vivid illumination, suc-
ceeded by general darkness. You
hear a shout—you see a blaze—and
the next moment the green curtain
falls—and I have to hurry off to pay
“the supers.”
If ever France and England should
go to war again, I propose that FRAN-
coni and Astley’s should fight their battles. We should do it much
more effectively—and our º: would do capitally for bulletins and
dispatches—for we should both of us be sure to claim the victory.
Every Ring has its fool, and the man who marries a woman in the
belief that she is perfection is the fool of the wedding-ring.
OLD Astley had the lowest contempt for women who did not know
how to ride. A celebrated actress from Drury Lane applied to him foran
engagement. “Can you ride, madam?”—“No, Sir.”—“Then, please
madam, you must walk.”-And he would not listen to another word.
DUCRow was the most enterprising manager I ever knew. At the
time that SIR ROBERT PEEL said that the “Battle of the Constitution
must be fought in the Registration Courts,” he sent in a contract to
Gºmment pledging himself to fight the battle cheaper than any one
else.
“Man is but Dust:”.this may not be perfectly new, but can anything
be more true? Considering how often I have been splashed and kicked by
the horses, and how repeatedly I have been tripped up by Mr. Merriman,
and rolled about in the Ring, I am sure no one will accuse me of
pedantry when Iboldly say that “Man is but sawdust.”
The Horse is greatly to be envied. His engagement lasts all the
;: round, and he never knows what it is to want a meal. There have
een moments of weakness, when I, WIDDIcomb,
not been born a horse!
Upon what a trifle does a man's Fame sometimes depend! Goversal,
confessed to me he owed his engagement as NApoleoN BUoNAPARTE
solely to the accident of his taking snuff!
Who says there is no promotion in our service? Why I have known
a young tailor start in the British army as a drummer boy, and be the
MARquess of ANGLEsex before he was nineteen. Innumerable other
instances might be given.
It is a great question whether I have derived half as much gratifica-
tion from “the most brilliant achievement that ever distinguished the
annals of British history”-Imean, our Battle of Waterloo-as from a
dozen oysters and a bottle of stout, which I have quietly enjoyed in
my dressing-room afterwards.
Are we a Nation of Rogues?
THE discussion on the Summary Jurisdiction Bill has elicited the
observations that trial by jury is the “Palladium of British Liberty,”
and the “dearest birthright of Englishmen.”. The fact asserted in the
former proposition cannot be too strongly insisted on; though, possibly,
the remark itself may be made too often. But to the latter aphorism
we entirely object. Our dearest birthright is, of all our advantages
that which we have most occasion to avail ourselves of, and we shoul
much ashamed if, in our personal case, this were trial by jury.
What must foreigners think of usif we let a º: pass current which
implies that an Englishman is almost constantly having to appear in

THE REPRESENTATION AS IT MIGHT BE.
AN entirely new basis of representation is suggested by a passage in
a speech made by MR. W. J. Fox, M.P., at the National Reform Asso-
ciation. The Honourable Member observed that—
“Many gentlemen now sent to Parliament represented the rascality (cheers), the
servility (cheers), the drunkenness, the selfishness of the country. (Loud cheers.)
Next to the real representation of the people, that of conflicting
interests and principles would be, perhaps, the fairest. The summary
of a debate might then run somewhat thus:-
In the House of Commons—
Petitions were presented by the MEMBER for CLAss PRIVILEGE for
the more stringent enforcement of the Game Laws; from the MEMBER
for MAMMON against any interference with the shift and relay system in
factories; and from the MEMBER for CHICANERY against Chancery
orm.
The MEMBER for FREEDOM or CosscIENCE proposed the throwing
open of the Universities to HERMAJESTY's subjects of all denominations.
The MEMBER for BigoTRY predicted the downfal of the Monarchy
from the admission of Dissenters to Qxford and Cambridge.
On a motion for the removal of Smithfield Market being made by the
MEMBER for HEALTH - - -
The Mººn for furn moved that the Bill be read this day six
months. He would defend vested interests through thick and thin.
The amendment was seconded by the MEMBER for PESTILENCE. He
would not tamely suffer his constituents, the undertakers, to be injured.
The MEMBER for FAIR PLAY brought forward a motion for the adop-
tion of the Ballot. This was opposed by the MEMBER for BRIBERy,
seconded by the MEMBER for INTIMIDATION, who, in an emergetic
harangue, denounced secret voting as unconstitutional and un-English.
Occasion was taken by the MEMBER for EconoMY to recommend the
the dignity of Gold Stick from the aspersions of the Hon. Gentleman.
The MEMBER for Cant gave notice of a Bill forbidding cabs, 'busses,
and steamboats to ply on Sundays. - -
Hereupon the Member for sistExcy said, that if the measure
went into Committee, he should demand the insertion of a clause to
prohibit the use of carriages on the Sabbath for i.". to Church. ...
The MEMBER for PHILANTHRopy then brought forward his motion
for the abolition of capital punishment, which, having been strenuously
opposed by the MEMBER for Destructiveness, was rejected by a small
majority.
Un º: motion of the MEMBER for EARLY CLosing, the House then
adjourned.

PUNCH2S HAND-BOOK TO
LEAving for awhile the regions of §§ we descend for a moment
to the floor of the house, a floor which MR. Jons Q’Connell, of mori-
bund notoriety, might be excused for a desire to die upon. The floor
to which we allude is the parterre of Her Majesty's Theatre—a par-
terre abounding in flowers, some of which are of the most, exquisite
beauty, some a little full-blown, some rather faded, and a few that night
be weeded out with advantage to the general appearance of the locality.
Among the flowers of the parterre there is a slight sprinkling of the
Pinks of elegance; a large assortment of the White Stocks, which give a
sort of starched regularity to the scene; a strip or two of London
Pride; and a goodly collection of those highly respectable tenants of
the soil, that, although neither forced in the hot-beds of luxury, nor
connected with the old roots of venerable ancestral trees, are a very
favourable specimen of the productions of the land in which they flourish.
There may be occasionally remarked in the parterre the sudden
appearance of an
object surmounted
with a hat, an object
which is always
looked upon in the
light of a scare-
crow among the sur-
rounding flowers.
Sometimes the
pleasing aspect of
the place is im-

of Qpera, however, there are some wonderful combinations of various
qualities and properties, which amalgamate only here, as if there was

intº harmony those matters, which are antagonistic everywhere else.

Whig Oil with Radical Vinegar, and the easy mixture of the Sublimate
of Aristocratic Alkali with the common Potash of the numerous essential
extracts of which Society is formed. It is difficult to account for this
phenomenon, when we remember that there is in the social structure a
chilly ingredient which seldom can be got above freezing point and our
only solution is, that in the genial †. of the realms of Opera, every
quality is held for the time in solution by means of that liquid harmony
we have already, spoken of, which could melt the snow that caps the
summit of that Mountain, in his own opinion, and Molehill, in other
people's—an upstart Lord.
Besides the neutralisation of political acids, the evaporation of aris-
tocratic airs, the giving off of vapours which are .. dissipated at
the Opera, and other great chemical results of the delightful climate, all
leading to the harmonious blending of a variety of naturally repugnant
parts, we may look upon many of the boxes as little laboratories of them.

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE THIRD.
MRS. MOUSER WISITS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
WISDOM OF PARLIAMENT.
HER OPINION OF THE
As I said, I have been to the House of Commons—to what MoUs ER
calls the British House of SoLOMON. It may be; but all as a woman,
I can say, is this—I didn't find SoLQMON at home.
I didn’t believe it—no, I didn’t, think I could even dream it—that I
should ever hold man less than I did. I shall never trust myself again,
for I thought I couldn't go lower; and now, men—if I may be allowed
the word—seem to me no more than mice.
Before this, I always looked cold at the man for the taxes. And now
—now I’ve seen the sort of people that make’em—I shall despise him.
I know it’s wrong to give way to prejudice; still, as poor aunt Peacock
used to say—“A prejudice, if rightly .#. may pass for a virtue;
just as mutton properly hung, may be put off for venison.” Whereupon,
for the future, I shall hate the tax-gatherer, and think myself the better
for my aversion. -
The Wisdom of Parliament! Well, I shall never—never go up and
down stairs without thinking of it—for there it is, in the passage and
on two of the landings, there’s that precious Wisdom, in three places.
Three blind windows have we in our house—three indigent blind case-
ments, as I call 'em, with bricks for glass, and what is more, telling the
meanness, or, rather, poverty of us, to all the world-because the
world’s so ill-natured, it won’t give people Pº. credit for meanness,
but will put it down to poverty—when, if it wasn’t for Parliament,
we'd have its wisdom framed and glazed, and not wisdom in darkness—
wisdom, indeed, that cheats the glazier, and shams windows with bricks
and mortar. After what I’ve seen and what I’ve heard in the House
of Commons, the lights of Parliament—as MoUser sometimes calls 'em
—are to my mind nothing more than blind windows.
To think, too, how I’ve been put ". by that House of Commons!
Since I was a girl, I’ve been given to the debates. “My dear AMELLA,”
poor aunt PEAcock used to say, “you’ll weaken your mind, diluting it
with those speeches in Parliament.” . Still, I used to think it so won-
derful that men could go on talking—talking—from column to column,
just as small beer runs, and runs from a barrel when once turned on—
never boggling, or stopping, or, so to speak, once breaking the thread
and taking it up again. But la! only to think of a Member of Parlia-
ment taken as he is on the floor, as they call it, with all his slovenliness
about him, and then, to see him smart and neat as a new pin in
the morning papers . . “Why,” as I said to MoUSER, “it’s no more the
same Member than I’m the same woman, with only my night-cap—not
that I would be seen in the sort of night-cap that some people wear—
and the same woman in my party turban and bird-of-paradise feather.”
Butlet me º myself—for I will expose that House of Commons,
Yes—I’ll pick the Wisdom of Parliament to little bits, and laugh at
the pieces. But just listen.
Once, MoUSER and I were walking together—not that we’re often
out with one another; indeed, as I say, people can hardly believe that
MoUSER has a wife at all, I’m so little with him—well, once we were
out; and—I don’t know what could put it into my head-of course i
looked at the shops as we went by, though MouseR took no more
notice of shops-bating that he wanted to stop at a fishmonger's, there
was, he said, such a noble salmon—no more notice of 'em than if he’d
been on Salisbury Plain, or Ramsgate sands. At last he drew up like
a rock in front of a window, and holding my arm in his like a vice, and
9inting with his stick, he got almost a crowd about us. “Look here,
º. MoUSER,” said he, in that cold-drawn voice of his when I know
he means to be aggravating-look, AMELIA: Isn't this a dreadful
sight-a shocking exhibition?” “What’s dreadful—what’s shock-
ing?” I asked—knowing what he’d be at all the time. “False
petticoats—false charms–false blandishments; false—false—false—”
and he went on in such a way, I wouldn’t if I could, repeat him.
“Why,” he cried, "with such hypocrisy before his eyes”—it was in
this way MouseR talked of a few harmless bits of crinoline—“with
such deceit, in twenty places, what is a man to believe true in life?
Only think,” he cried, and then he laughed in such a way, my blood
went quite cold, “only think of an Eve in horse-hair!”
Now, what I mean to say is this—as I did say it to MoUser him-
self, bringing back to his mind that very shop-window.—“Now,
MoUSER,” said I, “only think of the Wisdom of Parliament in the
House of Qommons—the Wisdom with its hands in its pockets—stam-
mering and shuffling-and looking up at the ceiling—and then feeling
all round its mouth for the proper word, and seldom getting it—the
Wisdom that jerks up to a red-box and gives it a tap, and then starts
back, again, as if the Wisdom had burnt its fingers, think of this
Wisdom in, such a quandary, and then see it laced, and puffed and
padded out in a flowing suit of print in the morning papers—think of
this, and then look in my face if you can, and answer—yes, just tell me
—whether the Wisdom of Parliament doesn’t wear crinoline too?”
Well...what was MoUSER's answer? “AMELLA, you’re a foolish
woman.” Yes; and with those very words men have gone on all these
thousands of years ºf our mouths, and almost making us believe
'em. Now, I only wish that every woman in the land would make up
her mind to go into the House of Commons—not that there’s any
decent place for them; oh no! the Wisdom of Parliament has taken
care of that. But perhaps, after all, the Wisdom has some shame; and
seeing what a little it has done for us—how much it has put upon us—
doesn't like to meet us. And I’m sure, if a woman—I mean, of
course, a woman with a spirit; for, as aunt PEAcock used to say,
almºst with tears in her eyes, “Some women, AMELLA, want the spirit
to do ’em right, just as some bees want a proper sting,”—if a real
woman wants her blood to boil, let her only go into the House of
Commons. Let her there—if she can only smother her feelings to do
it—have one good look at the Wisdom of Parliament; some of it fast
asleep, some of it with its hat on and its legs up, and all of it as much
like Wisdom as an owl is like a bishop; well, ſ: her there, with her
own eyes, look upon the Wisdom that makes a slave of her, taxing her,
and binding her; and never giving her, in that very House of Commons,
so much as an inch of seat to sit down upon; lef any woman that is a
woman, think of what she has suffered—is suffering—and no doubt,
will always suffer from that House; and then try to imagine—if she
can—what were my feelings when, hearing that Wisdom talk as it did
—I wasn’t allowed to answer it !
“MoUSER,” said I, when I came home; and a pretty humour I found
MoUSER in, just because I had stept into Parliament—not that I’m
going to drag my fire-place and MouseR's airs before the world—
“MoUSBR,” said I. “how for four hours, I held my tongue, is to me
astonishing.” “Hardly to be believed,” said MoUSER in his dry,
cutting manner, which I wouldn't notice. I then thought of what
aunt PEAcock used to say: “Silent women,” were her words, “silent
women are like oysters—nine times out of ten they don’t know the value
that’s in 'em.” Not that I felt in that way at all; no, the wonder was
—as I said to MouseR—that I didn't get up, and whether they liked it or
not, before all the Members of the House, give them a Bit of my Mind.
“And if you had,” said MouseR with a laugh that didn’t much become
i. as,a husband—“and if you had, they’d have sent you to the
OWer.
Had I only known that, I don’t think—no, not if they’d passed an
Act of Parliament for the ºr. I could have held my tongue.
I know that the house would have gone to ruin while I’d been away;
the fire-irons and steel fender covered with rust when I’d got back,
and even the chairs not fit for a Christian to sit down in-nevertheless,
Ido think to the Tower I would have gone; 'twould have brought
matters to a head. As it was, how I kept quiet I can't tell: my silence
was quite a miracle; just as if a kettle on the fire should be full of
boiling water—for that 's almost what I felt with my wish to talk—and
yet, for all that, never sing. -
The debate, too, that I heard, was all against woman: a cupboard
uestion—as I said to MoUSER-with all the meanness of men about it.
There’s that MR. HENLEY ; well, my fingers did itch to give him above
any one a Bit of my Mind. He made a motion—for that's what they
call a speech—to cut down the wages of Ministers and everybody.
And for what reason? “Why,” says MR. HENLEY-and I º:
men were impudent enough before; but the faces they have in Parlia-
ment, oh dear!—“why,” says he, “all things are at least a third as
cheap as they were.” All things | - -
Now I had to bite my tongue, I was so near calling out-“MR.
HENLEY, M.P. What’s the price of shrimps? They were sixpence
a pint when bread was eighteenpence a loaf, and sixpence they are now.”
I should like to have seen what he'd have said to that. But of
course lower the salaries, and it’s the women that must suffer. The
LoRD CHANCELLOR comes home and says, “My dear, they’ve cut me
down a third; you must keep house for half.” I could see it with the
quarter of an eye, it was only another attack upon the sex; another
low at woman; and all the meaner, because she isn't represented.
“I’ve discovered the reason, MR. MoUsBR,” said I, getting warm.
“And I’ve discovered the reason,” said he, with a solemn look;
“the reason why my breeches” (he has no such things) “my breeches
get so old as they do.”
“Why?” said I.
“Because,” said he, “where I wear them once, you wear them
twenty times.” - - -
Well, you may suppose I didn't think him worth answering, or I
could have given him a Bit of my Mind. -
Yours till next week,
The Honeysuckles. _ AMELLA MoUSER.
The Blind Asylum for Pictures.
TRAFALGAR SQUARE has always been described as “the most splendid
site in Europe.” This may account for the Vernon Gallery being so
long buried in that locality, as it was taken for granted that, “ with
the most splendid site in Europe,” no one could fail seeing pictures,
even in a dark cellar.

“I say, Tom MY, come AND shove. HERE's THE Pooh ORSEs cAN'T
GET THE waggin UP 1"
“DOWN-DERRY DOWN’” WITH YOUR SALARIES.
-- “CUT your coat according to your cloth,” says the old adage, and
Cut your salaries according to your corn,” is the present cry of the
Protectionis's. MR HENLEY proposes to pay the Judges, and all
other public functionaries on a scale to be regulated by the price
of wheat, so that, when the farmer, is getting so much a quarter
less for his wheat, the Judge will be getting so, much a quarter
less for his salary. The Mark Lane Express will be eagerly taken
in and perused at all the Government offices, and the dignitaries of the
Judicial bench before proceeding to sit in Westminster Hall will run
round to Mark Lane to ascertain the market value of their services.
When wheat is low, their Lordships will give evidence of the fact by
their rye faces; and if, on the contrary, oats should be looking up, the
Courts would bask in the sunshine reflected from the smiling faces
peering above the ermine. An arrival from Dantzic will dash with
woe the features of the Exchequer Barons, while alarge importation from
Odessa will cloud the benevolent brows of the Judges of the Queen's
Bench, and the Courts of Chancery.
We, cannot say we admire the wisdom of the proposition to put a
Judge's learning, impariality, and discretion into one scale, and a sack
of corn into the other; nor do we think their Lordships ought to be
ground down with the wheat, oats, and barley, that may be thrown
upon, the hands of the dealers, or sacrificed at a low figure. Let us,
by all means, treat, sinecures in every respect as we would corn, by
cutting down, threshing out, or winnowing away the chaff; but to make
a sliding scale of remuneration for public services, ably and conscien-
tiously º: is an expedient alike difficult in practice, and con-
temptible in principle.
Sibthorp on Food and Salaries.
SPEAKING of MR. HENLEY’s sham motion for the reduction of
official salaries, CoLoREI, SIBTHORP is reported by one of the organs of
his party to have said, that—
“He saw no reason why the salaries of the individuals who adorned that bench
should not be reduced in proportion to the price of food.”
What does Colonel SIBTHoRP understand by food?. It is said, that
an Irish member present, during the debate, answered this question by
asking, “Is it thistles?”
MAXIMS AND OPINIONS OF FIELD-MARSHAL
WIDDICOMB.
WHEN War is concluded, all animosity should be forgotten. I love
to see the British and French troops fraternise together as soon as the
Battle of Waterloo is over. To set them a good example, I have often
tossed with MARSHAL NEY myself.
Folly may take liberties with Wisdom, but let Wisdom once get the
whip-hand of Folly, and Folly soon drops its tone and learns to keep a
respectful distance.
Every man has his “Sauve-qui-peut.” I confess I should run away
i. §: an engagement where I was told I should meet nothing
ul, LI1sumen.
As to moral courage, I have rarely met, the three-months-after-date
kind. I mean unprepared courage, that which enables a man, without
wincing, to put his name to a bill the moment it is placed before him.
I was madly fond of . as a young man, but I had to stand one
º: at rehearsal behind DUCRow's Pegasus, and he kicked it all
out, ol. Inc.
I travelled once with GowersAL. “What are you?” said the man at
the passport-office. “I AM THE CHILD OF DESTINY,” loudly answered
Gowers AI, as naturally as if he had been that moment on the Field of
Waterloo. He was very indignant when his cºstume of BUoNAPARTE
was taken away from him at Boulogne. I recollect he was very nearly
imprisoned out of mistake for PRINCE Louis NAPOLEoN, and only
owed his escape to the fact of his not being able to speak a word of
French. Whether he cherished any designs upon the French throne,
it would be the height of presumption in me to say.
If people are discontented, give them a riddle. It is astonishing
how quiet they become. I am positive, if riddles were to be asked in
the House of Commons, that many of those riotous proceedings would
be put a stop to, which are a disgrace to a civilised community.
They call me ambitious, but my only ambition has been to be the
centre of the most fashionable circle in London, and in this I have long
ago succeeded. If my ambition had been of a “vaulting” kind, there
is not a barrier in man's path, which, with the horses at my command, I
: not easily have leapt over. Those who call me ambitious, little
ow me.
It was NApoleon's favourite boast, that “he had made all his
Generals out of mud,” I may boast of the same origin for mine, for,
as a rule, Inever make a man a General in my army until I know he is
a “thorough brick.”
If you ask me which are the best troops, I answer, The Irish.”
They will stand fire, like a mutton-chop. Their love of fighting leads
them into all sorts of disturbances. They should have been born razors,
they are such delicious blades for a scrape. In fact, if there is a
quarrel in the street, you may make up your mind to this—that an
Irishman is as sure to be there as a policeman is not.
The May Prince.
It has been authoritatively announced that the new Prince, having
been born on the birthday of the Duke of WELLINGTON, is to be
named Arthur, in compliment to the Hero of Waterloo. We
perfectly approve of this arrangement, and regret that we cannot second
the suggestion of a highly respectable deputation of chimney-sweeps,
who waited outside our office on Wednesday last, with a proposal that,
in consequence of the royal infant, having been born on Chimney-
Sweepers' Day, he should be called the Black Prince,

“The market-place,” he was in the habit of saying, “is the Louvre

of some of our market-places? We can imagine his saying ‘Smithfield
Market is the hospital of the common people; ” and it may be for this
very reason, now that we think of it, that Bartholomew's Hospital is
placed so conveniently in the middle of it.

PUNCH*S HAND-BOOK TO HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE.
F the visitors to Her Ma-
łº Theatre having now
said almost enough, we turn
to its administration, which
comprises almost as many
departments as are to be
found in Downing Street.
The Government, is not
limited to a single form,
but includes the monarch-
ical, which is always º:
up in the person of the
reigni ween of Song, as
well as the º
w is preserved by a
series of representations as
complete as they can pos-
sibly be º by º:
even the humblest
in º: * *
representation, wi ul
liberty to give his voice all
the power of which it is
capable. The qualification
required on the part of those
who have a voice in the re-
presentation is not peout
- niary, but they are expected
to produce certain notes of required value, which they are allowed to keep depºsited in their
own chests until the production of the notes is required. It is according to the value of
these notes, and the power of issuing them at pleasure, that a voice in the representatiºn of
Her Majesty's Theatre is estimated, and the great firm of LABLAQHe and Company have been
known to send forth so many notes of an extraordinary value in the course of a few hours that
the resources of Her Majesty’s Theatre have been pronounced inexhaustible. -
The monarchical department of the realms of Qpera,contains a lyric throne, occupied by a
Queen of Song, who, though not coming to the lyric throne by hereditary right, may be said
to succeed to it, for without succeeding, to arrive at a high position in Her Majesty's Theatre
would be quite impossible. - --- - -
We should use up a moderately sized goose in providing ourselves with the quills necessary
to write the histories of all the Queens of Song, which would form an interesting companion
to the Lives of the Queens of England, but we shall take a passing glance at a few of those
who have worn the laurel crown of Qperatic royalty. . - - -
It is not necessary to trace the origin of the extensive dominion which has been acquired by
the Queens of Song, but there is no doubt that the first of them arrived at the head of an
Italian troupe, which was soon joined by a powerful band, comprising the natives of various
countries, and acting under the direction of a leader, whose object has always been to ensure
harmony and uniformity of movement among the forces under him. The head of these forces
may be said to occupy a similar rank to that of Field-Marshal, and he is invested with a baton
as the emblem of his office, which is that of Commander-in-Chief of all the forces of the Opera.
Without going very far back into the annals of Musical monarchy, we shall content ourselves
with glancing at some of the comparatively modern reigns, commencing with that of PASTA,
who exercised a sovereign sway some twenty years ago, and whose career was remarkable for
very brilliant achievements. -
During the PASTA dynasty several valuable acts were introduced, which have been in
operation ever since, and every Queen of Song who has come after her has kept most of these
acts in full force, and has added others to the Operatic statute-book. -
The lyric throne was next occupied by GRISI, who enjoyed for some time an almost undis-
puted sovereignty, until the yearlsº, when she somewhat unexpectedly resolved on abdicating,
and joined an Operatic republic. The reign of GRIsr has been long and prosperous, for she
ascended the Operatic throne at an early age, and so great was her popularity, that her abdica-
tion must be attributed to the influence of her advisers, who induced her to vacate a throne
which she might have continued to fill, but which—as an interregnum is abhorred asthoroughly
as a vacuum-another soon came forward to occupy.
The immediate successor of the GR1st dynasty was the illustrious JENNY LIND, whose
dominion was the most absolute ever known, and whose reign was an uninterrupted series of
triumphs, graced by the homage of all classes, from the most exalted to the humblest, who vied
with each other in eagernessfo acknowledge their captivation, if not their captivity. Treasure
and tribute poured in so copiously, that the revenues, were vastly increased, and though a
considerable tax was imposed on the incomes of those desirous of paying court to the reigning
Queen of Song, the Treasury department of Her Majesty's Theatre, found difficulty in accom:
modating those who claimed the privilege of being the foremost to part with their money, and
who insisted on the right to a priority in the payment of their contributions. The officers of
the Operatic treasury were kept constantly as busy as the Chancellor of the Exchequer is at
those periods when the public conscience is in a particularly sensitive state, and the ten-pound
notes come tumbling in from all the Y. Z.'s and unwise heads, the A. B.’s and GABY’s, who
think to ruh, off along course of wholesale fraud on the revenue, by a single act of retail
honesty. The brilliancy of this reign was unexpectedly clouded by the abdication of the
reigning Queen of Song, whose departure threatened to leave a fearful vacancy on the lyric
throne, when happily the expedient of a restoration was resolved upon; and Sontag came
forward to resume the sceptre she had formerly held, and by her premature resignation
of which GRisi had held the undisputed sovereignty. -
The empire of Sontag was at once acknowledged by all parties, and her reign has been as
glorious and prosperous as any that has preceded
it. Her refinement and intelligence have caused
the introduction of several very desirable reforms
into Operatic affairs, and many acts that had
become obsolete have been renewed, while other
acts have been indebted to her for considerable
amendment. Everything she has submitted to
the attention of the house has been received in
the most enthusiastic manner without a division,
and there is ... prospect that the present
Queen of Song will enjoy a reign of pop
equal to any of her predecessors.
The Operatic sovereignty is to a certain extent
electoral, for no one can hope to fill the lyric
throne who has not been called to it by general
acclamation, and, though there may be an occa-
sional instance of a Pretender aspiring to the
position of Queen of Song, her title is never ad-
mitted, and it is found utterly impossible to make
a house, in which her supporters would have a
majority. Even if the civil list or free list were
to be vastly extended by the administration for
the purpose of increasing the number of her
friends, and an augmentation of the privileged
orders were to be resorted to, with the view of
º: her a factitious support, the attempt would
emet by the withholding of the supplies until the
establishment of a legitimate Operatic monarch.
The Queens of Song are sometimes placed in
circumstances of extreme difficulty by virtue of
their sovereignty; and a narrative of their trials
would furnish a volume of considerable interest
to those who sympathise with sorrow in white
satin, misery in muslin, or female distress of any
d, in any costume. Sometimes the Queen of
Song may be seen hanging onto the knees of some
excited hero, who is panting, with all the ener
of a steam-tug, to pull himself away, until the
occupant of the lyric throne falls prostrate, like
an abandoned bag of clothes, shaken ruthlessly
from the basket or barrow of some neglectful
laundress. At times the Queen of Song may be
seen in regal attire, seated on her throne, º
varies in its style with the particular occasion,
and in the course of a few months specimens of
the upholstery of all nations will be exhibited.
It is a remarkable fact, that when the Queen
of Song quits the regal apartment, its furniture
is carried off after her, by attendants who walk
in and remove the tables and chairs, a proceeding
which would cause a casual observer to suppose
that the goods are either being swept off by a dis-
tress, or that they are required for the use of
the room into which royalty has retired. What-
ever may be the pride, pomp, and circumstance,
with which the Queen of Song has,withdrawn,
the throne she has just quitted is pulled of back-
wards by its hindlegs, the golden table, with the
golden inkstand on it, is enclosed between the
two chairs by a splendidly liveried lacquey, and
the ſº upon which captive º have
been kneeling in homage, is whisked off by the
handsofanofficer, who will beseen soon afterwards
doing abit of Operatic gardening with awatering-
pot, out of which he irrigates the ground ºn
which the flowers of the ballet, are about to
spring up, after a brief interval. Sometimes, the
3. of Song may be seen ºf in the con-
cerns of humble Operatic life, and, disguised as a
peasant, girl, will be found flourishing, beneath
the malignant curses of frantic old gentlemen, in
flowing white wigs, submitting to flirtations with
“spangled” officers, or being thrown off by in-
dignant swains in Dutch trousers.and, Swiss
jackets. Nevertheless, this capacity for all situa-
tions, forms the great charm and glory of the
Queen of Song, whose popularity increases with
every rude repulse from the hands, mouth, arms
and legs of the lovers, fathers, brothers, and
sometimes even the mothers, of Opera.
A GRAVE REspossibility.—The worst thin
we can say of the Metropolitan Interments B
is that it is a “gigantic undertaking.”

A Most ALARMING sweLLING!

SALARIES AND SINECURES.
We have heard several instances of infants born with silver spoons in
their mouths, but there seems to be another class of fortunate indi-
viduals, who, without actually coming into the world with the valuable
article between their lips, are found with a prodigious mouthful of plate
before the expiration of their childhood. The office of Registrar to the
Prerogative Court of Canterbury is a nice slice of the loaves and fishes;
or, to follow out the allegory of the plate basket, it may be termed a
most enviable fish slice, to be placed in the infantine mºuths of those
who were not provided at their birth with the spoon, for which they
have often a remarkable affinity. - --
The Registrar of the *...* Court of Canterbury enjoys some
£12,000 a year, which is considered capable of yielding satisfaction not
only to the actual possessor, but by anticipation, to those who, are
likely to come in for it; and thus, while one individual is gorging him-
self to his heart's—or his pocket's—content, on the ample and nutri-
tious meal, there are always others appointed to stand by and revel in
the savoury odour of the banquet to which they are nominated to
succeed, when the gormandiser in esse has relinquished his hold on the
inexhaustible Fº:
We are glad to find that an act is in existence which will defeat the
reversioners to this gluttonous meal at the public expense, and we hope
LoRD John Russeil will have the firmness to keep off the hungry
expectants who are waiting to cram themselves on this great piece of
the greenest fat that ever tempted a sinecurist's gluttony. If the
Registrar has anything to register which really wants registering, let
him be paid for the work he may have to do; but 12,000, or 14,000l.
a-year seems an exorbitant sum, if it were even for registering aſ the
stoves, paletóts, and shirts that are manufactured in the course of the
twelvemonth.
INDIVIDUALs of a sombre cast of mind were offered, by an advertise-
ment which appeared on Wednesday, last week, in the Morning Post, a
decided treat. The notification alluded to thus commenced:—
Exhibition this day, May 1, of MOURNING COSTUMES.
A, rather seasonable and appropriate kind of show this, for May-day.
º it was got up in rivalry to the festivities of the sweeps, who
put of their sables on that merry anniversary to dance with Jack-in-
the-Green. The exhibitor of Mourning Costumes, we suppose, in-
tended to amuse the public with a Jack-in-the-Black.
HE WOULD BE A KNIGHT.
SoME letters have appeared in the papers
from a º Mayor, º: on the honours
of knighthood. He regrets he was not intown
on the occasion of the late Mayoral gathering
at the Mansion, House, and attributes his ab-
sence to inability to catch a train, added to
an anxious doubt whether his travelling ex-
penses would have been allowed him out of the
funds of the Corporation.
We were not aware that the Government
contemplated making §: of any of those
who came up to make amight of it, a short time
back, with the London citizens. The candidate
for dignity, to whose application attention has
been drawn, is evidently so intent on Knight-
hood, that he is prepared to seek it at any price
—even at the price of a railway fare to the
Metropolis. Considering the anxiety there is
to increase the revenue, at any sacrifice, it
might be advisable to grant Knighthoods at
so much per head, or per hood, to every pro-
vincial Mayor, who, like the individual to whom
we have alluded, is agitated by a fierce resolution
to tack Sir to the beginning of his name, even
though he should pay his own travelling ex-
penses up to town, to secure the dignity.
ANIMAL MACHINERY.
MACHINERy, we perceive, is to be included
among the things to be shown at the Exhibition
of 1851. Our national industry, no doubt, will
make a splendid display of steam-engines and
spinning jennies, but certainly the most tho-
rough-going machine which this country could
exhibit is the British soldier.

PROTECTION TO BRITISH SEPULTURE.
THE first dinner of the United Undertakers’ Protection ;
formed for the purpose of opposing the Metropolitan. Interments Bill,
took place yesterday at the Plume, of Feathers. The viands, which
comprised the very choicest funeral baked meats, were supplied by
MEssRs. ELMwood and NAYLOR. The chair was occupied by
MR. DobODY.
On the removal of the cloth, De Profundis was sung by the profes-
sional gentlemen from the Shades.
The customary loyal toasts having been unceremoniously disposed of,
MR. HATCHMENT, of the firm of HATCHMENT AND WoRMs, rose to
propose to the assembly their old toast, Death....With this toast, he
would couple a resolution, namely, that a Committee be appointed to
consider the best, means of defeating, the Metropolitan, Interments
Bill; a measure which, by putting the bodies of deceased parties into
the hands of the Government, would take the bread out of their (the
Undertakers') mouths. (Hear, hear.)
The toast was drunk down-sitting, amid cheers and laughter.
MR. TREssels, in seconding the motion, hoped they were tiled in-
or, as he might perhaps be allowed to say—screwed down (laughter),
because he should wish the pall of privacy to be extended over his
observations. The toast they had just responded to expressed a fact.
There was no doubt that they got their living by death. He did not know
much Latin, but his motto was “Mors Janua Vitae.” The measure in
question—he should like to take the measure, of the framer (hear)—
would diminish general mortality. True; but then, it would take away
their living, and as a poet had said—who, he believed, was buried at
Stratford-on-Avon-"You took a man's life when, you took the means
he lived by.” (Hear, hear.) The bill proposed the establishment of
cemeteries away from, human habitations. By this arrangement the
causes of death would be limited to casualties and common diseases. At
present, one corpse made many. Everybody buried in an intramural
churchyard contributed more or less to increase deaths, and, therefore,
their profits. (Cheers.)
Song. MR. BELLOES.-" King Death was a rare old Fellow.”
MR. SHRow DALL held in his hand the i. of the Board of
Health on a general scheme for extramural sepulture, a book which he
should pronounce very unpleasant. It let out—he should say disclosed
—what had much better remain buried—buried was the word—in
oblivion. Such a book ought to be contradicted. The public was
told in it that the air was poisoned by burial grounds (oh! oh!)—that
the water from them soaked, into the London wells (shame)—that
emanations from the dead produced strange and loathsome diseases,
and all manner of things of that sort, shocking to the generality,
though nothing to those who are used to them. There was a deal
in it also about crowded vaults, which would have the effect of making
people discontented with their long homes, and of deterring them from
tº: to church, which must lead to infidelity (hear), and this reminded
im of his toast, which was the Church—always in connexion with the
Churchyard. (Cheers.)
Song. MR, RUMBALL-" Down among the dead Men.”
MR. MyFFLEs said he had read the Board of Health's Blue Book
and considered it low. It went against the proper distinction between
8. º funeral and a common affair. (Öries of “shabby.”) It
called their taking a fair advantage of the friends of the party under
melancholy circumstances, extortion (groans); and it actually 3.
interment “a most unfit subject for commercial speculation.” The
interment bill was founded on that report, and he agreed with the
meeting, at St. Mary's, Lambeth, where it was eloquently said that, if
such a bill was to become law, “it would injure trade and hurt the
feelings of the majority of the parishioners.”. There was one most ob-
jectionable clause in the bill, providing that funerals performed under
the management of the Board of Health, shall, for the lowest on the
scale of the Board's prices, “be conducted with decency and solemnity.”
What was this but a direct premium to meanness, and blow to
business? He would direct their particular attention to the clause
providing reception-houses for bodies between death and interment.
A. *: cry might be got up against this as an outrage upon sorrow,
and all that sort of thing. The assessment clauses should also be
attacked vigorously. A knowing appeal to popular prejudice might
defeat this measure, which would be as destructive to themselves as
wholesome to the community; and the rejection of which he would now
propose in a bumper. (much cheering.)

THE RED FARMER.
(From our Rural Correspondent.)
IIIs morning, during a ram-
ble in the fields, I observed
a man sitting on a stile,
dressed, indeed, in the pink
of agricultural fashion;
namely, in a broad-brimmed
hat, brown coat, black waist-
coat, drab breeches, leather
[... and stout highlows,
ut whom, otherwise, by his
gloomy look, and great beard
and moustaches, I should
have taken for an enormous
Frenchman. iscernin
however, what he was,
could not help exclaiming
– audibly, “Is this a sample

EE “Eeas it is,” said the agri-
s's— cultural gentleman, “and

“I beg your pardon, Sir.”
I replied, “for thinking aloud. Is it not almost time for mowing f"
“Mowun º' responded the farmer. “Bist thee a fool? Mowun at
this time in Maayſ Haw—haw—haw!” - - -
“Excuse me, Šir,” I said, “I mean a particular kind of mowing.
May I suggest that a razor—” -
*Ho, ho?” laughed my rustic acquaintance. “Thee wants to know
why I dwooant shaaye, I ºpose. Well; I'll tell'ee. Didº, ever see
the likeness of that feller BARBUs, the French revolutionist?” .
*Certainly, Sir,” I answered, wondering what could have induced
him to copy #Arººs in any particular. - - - >
*Didst read what the Ijuke of RICHMOND said in the House 'tother
night about we Warmers?” -
“He ...; that * yº not continue loyal much longer at the

THE WONDERS OF A LONDON WATER DROP.
* THE freshest fruits of microscopical research are the wonders which
have been revealed in a drop of London water through, the Molecular
Magnifier, illuminated by the Intellectual Electric Light. For the
ability to behold these astounding marvels, a certain preparation is
necessary, bearing, superficially considered, some resemblance to
Mesmerism. The person intended to be the Seer is placed on a seat.
Any competent individual then takes him in hand, and explains to him
the composition of water, showing him how the pure fluid differs from
the liquid constituting the Thames, and from that which exists in the
metropolitan wells, when the former has received the contents of the
sewers, and the latter the oozings of intramural graveyards. Some
delicate subjects, even of the male sex, cannot endure this process, it
affecting them with faintness and nausea. . .
Having been subjected to the above preliminaries, most people are
in a sufficient state of enlightenment to discover, by the aid of the
Molecular Magnifier, the curiosities contained in

A DROP OF LONDON WATER.
The drop to be magnified is taken from a mixture of the common
well-water of London, with that supplied by the various, Companies.
MR. HAssFLI, it is already known, has enabled philosophers to dis-
criminate, between these waters, by the verminous and other pecu.
liarities which he has demonstrated in ºf... form of beverage.
The Molecular Magnifier differs from other microscopes, in dis-
playing the ultimate constitution of objects; a spectacle not only defying
the naked eye, but all vision which is not in a measure psychical.
...And wondrous indeed is the scene disclosed within the sphere of a
little drop of water—of that water which Londoners drink, swallowing
daily, myriads, and myriads of worlds, whole universes instinct with
life, or life in death! It transcends all that has hitherto been deemed
astonishing. America herself will confess that it stumps the revelations
of ANDREw JAckson DAvis. -
Creatures—who shall name them? things in human shape—in all
appearance London citizens—aldermen, deputies, common councilmen,
—are seen disporting in the liquid dirt as in their native element.
Behold them, fiercely hustling each other in competition for atomic
garbage. What pushing, poking, fighting, kicking, scrambling !, There
goes an unfortunate wretch fast as if for dear life, with a hook-nosed
homunculus-evidently a genuine water-bailiff—darting after him.
Here a cheap slop-seller has caught a smaller individual of the same
species by the head, and is trying to bolt him. There in, as plainly
as possible, you see a funeral procession with an undertaker at the head

of it. Look! a Death's-Head Larva jumps out of the coffin, snaps, up
the undertaker and kicks away the followers into space. See yonder,
what a twisting reptilery of it.". ! Observe, above, the
knot of knackers tormenting that ortunate beadle. Below, mark
the fry of slaughter-men, who are now, however, making their
onslaughts on each other. On a sudden the universal fray becomes a
rout. Monsters, rising as from a gulf of darkness, scatter the affrighted
combatants right and left. Gorgon-lobsters, hydra-prawns, direchimeras
of turtle, surely the unutterable mud-Pythons of MR. THQMASCARLYLE
Öme of them has seized a churchwarden: another, an alderman-and by
his gouty leg. Horrible! Darken the lens. Enough for one exhibition.
What are those infinitesimal semblances of humanity, which have
thus been detected in London, water They are only found in the
well-water of cities, whose inhabitants bury the dead among the living.
There is a *:::: that all organisations are multiples of themselves in
miniature, . Well-water, percolating the earth of churchyards, must
needs contain alderman, deputy, and similar bodies in solution. Examined
by the Molecular Magnifier, it certainly confirms this theory. .
A more important question is, by what are these beings animated?
It is all yery well to laugh at “Metempsychosis,” but, who would wil-
fully be laid in an intramural tomb, having once beheld the Purgatory
comprised in a drop of London water?

| THE SHADOW OF ENGLISH LIBERTY IN AMERICA.
- - - APPENDAGES OF BLACK ROYALTY.
ºt, º (To the Lord High Flunkey.)
RD, - º
The high position which you hold in the Royal Household induces me to call your
Lordship's attention to the fact that a nation of negroesis—if Imay be pardoned the expression
-going a head of usin what you, doubtless, will consider a most important matter...
Austin SouLouque, my Lord, Emperor of Hayti, a monarch, together with his subjects, as
black-as-your Lordship's boots, and Fº as polished, has been organising an aristocracy
and a royal household on a scale which will, º astonish even your own strong mind.
| . Faustin, your Lordship knows, woke up one morning lately, and found himself on a throne,
“Entering at once,” says the Ordre, “into the spirit of his imperial position, he soon created
ºrders, and titles of nobility. A first ordinance created four princes and fifty-seven dukes.”
The mind sinks prostrate, does it not, my Lord?—in contemplating this wonder of creation. It
is true that the titles of some of these noblemen have given occasion to shallow sneers. But
what if the Haytian peerage include a Duc DE LATABLE, A Duc De LA MARMELADE, and a
Duc pH. LIMONADE. Has not our own com-
prised Dukes of GLoucestER, and is there any
reason why it should not contain a Duke of
STILTON ?
“Another ordinance,” the Ordre states, “crea-
ted ninety-one counts.” My Lord, ma
allowed to make the remark that so e a
number of counts never perhaps occurred in the
longest indictment?
ccording to the same authority, my Lord,
this imperial blackamoor has a “grand almoner,
grandmarshal of the palace, gentlemen of honour,
governors of the Royal residences, masters of
ceremonies, &c.” Your º will perhaps
conjecture with myself that the &c. may include
Lord Stewards. The household of the Empress
consists of “two ladies of honour, fifty-six ladies
of the palace, twenty-two ladies of the chapel,
chamberlains, squires, &c.” There is something
interesting, though painful, in the idea of these
images of British flunkeydom carved in ebony. ||
If your Lordship were capable of entertaining
such an emotion, I think you would feel some
shame in observing the extent to which our
Court is surpassed by that of Hayti, in arrange-
|ments regulating costume...The princes, dukes
and counts, who bask in the light-if it would
not be more correct to say, who repose in the
shade—of Faustin's countenance, have to wear
a white dress, the barons a red coat, and the
knights a blue one. This combination of colours
is much more splendid than the variegation of
our own court dresses. Each of these magnifi-
cent uniforms is crowned with feathers, of which
ornaments the princes wear nine in their hats,
the dukes seven, the counts five, the barons three,
and the knights two. We have nothing to com-
pare with this, my Lord, except the appearance
of distinguished officers at a levee.
Let me beg you, my Lord, to take especial
notice of the circumstance that SouLouque was
originally a slave. This, viewed in connexion
with his “entering at once into the spirit of his
imperial position,” and creating his coloured
nobility, may suggest to your Lordship some
pleasing reflections on the natural tendency of
flunkeyism. *...
May 1, in conclusion, earnestly exhort your
Lordship to do all that you can in your peculiar
º to cultivate that tastein which so humi-
iating a lessonisafforded us, by the EMPEROR or

A. Remarkable Mis-nomer.
We must say that the lady who presides over
the Sisters of Mercy-at-Devonport, has been
treated very unhandsomely by our-contempo-
raries. The newspapers call her, Miss SELLon;
whereas she styles herself “y” Mother su ºf
the Sisters of Mercy.” Now, she has really done
so much good with her little imitation, or Albata
Nunnery, that we freely pardon her for assuming,
without the least acknowledgment, a title evi-
dently taken from “Manners and Cystoms of
yº Englyshe;” and we will not allow her to be
spoken of improperly. Since she describes her-
self as the Mother Superior, it is grossly incon-
siderate, to say the least, to Miss-call her as the
various journals do. We don't generally make
these mistakes in England, whatever may be
the case elsewhere. MRs. SELLos, gentlemen,
if you please, for the time to come.

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE FOURTH.
MRs. MOUSER, INCOG., ATTENDs THE “PROTECTION OF ENGLISH
INDUSTRY.”
THE secret shall die with me, but I’ve been at the Great Quartern
Loaf Meeting at the Crown-and-Anchor. How I got there—what I
went in-how nobody knew me—and how I saw and heard everything,
—all this, I say, shall go to the grave with me. To think that a noble
Duke—the DUKE OF RICHMOND-should, at such a time as this, put
our good little QUEEN into a fright, forgetting himself and going and
shaking hands, and slapping shoulders, with a pack of people that talk
of overthrowing the Lion and Unicorn, and carrying bullets and gun-
powder into the cupboards of quiet folks—and all because the cupboards
are filled at too cheap a rate; to think of this, and wonder how the
Duke can ever think of once more wrapping himself up in his fur and
velvet, and going to sup i. I have no doubt he will, if he’s
asked—at Buckingham Palace; to think of this is to think that society,
as MoUSBR calls it, is going to bits, and that not a soul of us will be
left to witness the pieces !
Well, the room was full, to be sure. The Crown—as I observed to
MoUSER-was crammed with jewels, many of 'em, as they seemed to
me, of the first brandy-and-water, Hand then there was the Anchor,
with Hope, in the shape of the noble chairman, as they called him,
sitting smiling upon it—smiling at the four-pound loaf at 54d. first
quality.
| people talk of pride', Why, if that dear Duke of RICHMOND
had been º: up in the fields to frighten birds from the corn—if
he’d been bred to rattle pebbles in a tin pot against the sparrows—he
couldn't have been more affable, more humble, more like one of the
smaller people about him. But—as aunt PEAcock used to say—the
really great political man can always make nothing of himself, when
it's for something to his advantage. I’m sure I’ve seen many a turn-
1. man thinking twice as much of himself as that blessed DUKE or
RighMond. . For only consider what he had to listen to . There were
half-a-dozen formers threatening to cut off all our horses—to stir up all
their ploughmen—and to come and take London to themselves; I
suppose, sharing all the gold and notes in the Bank, and the crown and
jewels in th: Tower, and the twopences of St. Paul's, and the half.
crowns at Westminster, and all of us to be sacked—as I believe they
call it—to make up what the farmers have lost in the price of corn, and
the wear and worry of their understandings! ...All this the Duke had to
listen to, and he seemed to think no more of it, but sat as quiet and as
cosy, as though the Bank of England were of no more account than a
hen-roost, and the crown of HER GRACIOUs, MAJESTY herself hardly
worth five shillings. But, to be sure, there is nothing so really high-
bred as indifference. The true nobleman-aunt PEACQCK used to say
—can always be, when it suits him, half-brother to a block of marble.
I have in my time seen a good many impostors. One lives in London
to very little purpose not to know what cheating is; we see it at every
corner of every street. But if ever I set, my eyes upon such a set of
jolly, red-faced, broad-backed sufferers, all of 'em--as they shouted—
destroyed and ruined, with not an inch of ground to rest their soles
upon? I couldn't have thought it possible that misery could be so fat,
and ruin so plump and good-looking !
To be sure, the DUKE or RICHMONDjold'em to take heart, and they
must fill their pockets. “Parliament,” said the Duke, “must listen
to you, if you only bellow loud enough. My advice is, don’t let
Éºle. eat, or drink, or think till corn’s at 50s., and up it must go
again! In the meanwhile, you will make a row like peaceable persons,
iſ and—whatever you may threaten—threaten and swagger like men who
know themselves. If we are robbed of every farthing, and stript of
= every rag, at least,”—said the dear Duke—“let us remember ourselves
; as gentlemen, and behave as such.”
“my opinion is that land’s everything,
“Then,” said one Farmer, -
ithout land, you can have no
and everything upon it’s nothing.
| country at all. Without land, where could the QUEEN find a place to
fiset her throne upon? Kings and Queens ar’n’t like skylarks; they
can’t live in the air. It’s the land as grows everything: soldiers and
sailors, cotton-trees and cocoa-trees, shopkeepers and spinners,-all live
upon the land: for take away the land, and where’s the sort of Noah's
Ark that will save the people?” At which everybody shouted, and the
Duke in the chair nodded his head, and moved his lips, as if he was,
º to himself, tasting the words, and mightily liking them. “But the
noblest thing upon the land is the farmer. Other folks are to him,
however fine they may be, no more than the poppies, among the
corn; they’re a show and a mischief, and not a crumb of whole:
some bread to be made out of 'em. Talking about poppies,” said
MR. MEALYMOUTH, “they remind me of soldiers; and that reminds
me again, if we’re to continue to have glory, we must be protected
in it. English gunpowder and British corn at 50s. are own
brothers....With corn down and free trade all over the world, the
manly British bayonet won’t be worth a rusty mail; and, instead of
settling any little dispute after the good old, manly i.º. fight—
which ends in a few thousands being knocked down—there’ll be peace
all over the world, and the beautiful cannon guns be turned into bee-
hives. We have,” said MR. MEALyMoUTH, “what’s called the
Apostle of Peace. Very well, then; if he is an Apostle, he’s the
Apostle JUDAs IscARIOT.” Whereupon, everybody, shouted and
clapped their hands, and all as pleased as if they’d found sixpence.
And next, a MR. G.RowleR, with tears as big as peas in his eyes,
declared that every English ploughman was without a bit in his belly,
or a thread upon his back. As for SIR. Robert PEEL-but here there
was such a shouting; some cried out for Temple Bar, and some for
Tower Hill: some for hurdle, and some for quartering—the Duke all
the while quite mild and well-behaved, and unconcerned at anything, as
a nobleman should be. Whereupon, MR. GROWLER took, heart, and
said, as the labourers were naked and starving, when they'd got in all
the crops, they would be bound together like so, many sheaves. And
if the poor fellows broke into rebels, was it to be expected that the
farmers would try to hinder 'em 2 By no means. Pretty liberty there'd
be for the subject if men mightn't do what they pleased against chea
corn “But”—said GRowLER—“our grand hope is in the dum
quadrupeds ! We own nine out of ten of all the horses—to say nothing
of the other animals... Well, what won't horses, carry, when they’re
º: to it? And when the Corn question is a question not only of wheat,
ut of barley and beans and oats, what won't English horses do, when
mounted by English farmers and labourers? As for Free Trade, it
would be put down like beans. And the QUEEN, the Prince, and the
children—whatever was the rumpus in London and the towns—would
be quite saſe in the country. There were farm-houses quite as com-
fortable as Windsor Castle or Buckingham Palace.” And then, MR.
GRowLER, snapping his fingers, said he should like to see what the
cab-horses of London, or the horses of the Guards, to boot, would do
against Dobbin?. He said, in a great passion—and ending his speech
in the sweat of his brow—he said he should like to see it. And then
everybody shouted, as much as to say, and so should wel And if it
wer’n’t a thing to remember, to notice how that dear DUKE OF
Richmond, who has been a soldier himself, smiled and looked as
pleasant, as though to talk about Englishmen fighting with Englishmen
—waggon-horses against cabs—was nothing! But then the Duke,
having seen a good deal of smoke in his time, knew perhaps exactly
what the speech was made of. -
Well, there were a good many other talkers, but the most furious of
'em all was one MR. Wiggins. I’ve heard a good deal of Red Republics
—though, whatever colours may have to do with ribands, what they’ve
to do with kingdoms, I can't tell—and MR. WIGGINs did, certainly,
though he was a farmer, look to my eye as red as Samuel in the
Freyschütz—that Samuel, that, all in red from hat to boots, goes walking

about the fields, and down the groves, burning the grass with his foot;
steps, and singeing the leaves with his cloak-MR. Wiggins bounced
forward, and said he had but a very few words to treat 'em with ; and,
as I thought, all the better; for the words he did say, every one of 'em
dropped from his mouth like a red-hot cannon-ball, and—I couldn't help
it—I saw all England in a blaze, and London taken by the Qart-Hors:
Heavy Dragoons, and the Reaping-Hook Artillery, and the Light Flail
Volunteers and me, and MouseR, and the children hidden in the
beer cellar while the sack went on, and MR. CoBDEN's head off on
Tower Hill, and MR. Bright-with Mr. Fearand riding as Sheriff–
on his way to Tyburn. All this I saw, and who could help it? for
WIGGINs, with a terrible look, and a voice like a clap of thunder, called
upon Government; and he said if Government didn't choose to answer
to the call, why, then, he and all of them, were ready for a scramble.
“Up with wheat,” cried WIGGINs, “or we’ll fight for the rise!” And,
certainly, he looked as if he meant it; for he flourished his arms about,
as though giving the meeting a sample of his muscles; and the meeting
—every man in it—jumped up, and gave such a shout—I’m sure there
wasn't a quartern loaf, between us and Charing Cross, that didn’t leap
again upon the baker’s shelf, at the very sound. - - -
And to see that DUKE of RICHMOND, and to fancy him with his
coronet—“with his pearls upon his brow,” as the song says—as meek
and mild in his chair as any two-year baby with sugared bread-and-
butter—to see him with not a pucker in his face, listening to such
cannon-balls in syllables, did, I must say it, cause astonishment, if not
admiration, in the breast of
Yours truly, Mr. Punch,
The Honeysuckles. AMELLA MoUSER.
“HOUSEHOLD WORDS.”
Both ER.—A word in great use when a stupid visitor has called, or a
dress has not come home, or the hair will not curl, or the pen will not
write, or the shoe will not come on, or any other little domestic
annoyance.
FIDDLESTICK.—A word strongly expressive of contempt. It crushes
all reply. When a lady once says “Fiddlestick,” he must be a bold
man who ventures to say another word.
FIDDLE-DE-DEE.-The same as “Fiddlestick,” only a degree milder.
DUCKY.-A term of endearment, applied indiscriminately when a *
favour is to be asked.
INDEED !—An ejaculation, “strongly recommended for family use.”
It implies doubt, a contemptuous denial, a gentle refusal, and saves an
infinity of useless explanation. Much may be said with that word
“Indeed!” It all depends upon the way in which it is pronounced.
“DRAT It!”—Very emphatic, almost amounting to an oath. It
should be used very sparingly, even by ladies.
DELICIOUS.-A word that, coming from a young lady’s lips, conveys
the highest possible amount of praise. It is applied equally to MARIO's
singing, GUNTER’s ices, HoubigANT's gloves, FRANK Stone's pictures,
FERRARIs' dancing, and means perfection in each instance.
Spoon EY.-A young man who cannot dance or talk, or talks no
better than he dances, or vice versá. A young man who wears clogs
and mittens, and sings sentimental songs with a lisp, and has turned-
down collars, and a miniature which he always carries in his waistcoat-
pocket, on the side nearest his heart, would take rank in household
estimation as a “spooney.”
DUMPY.—Unhappy, miserable. Any one who has a cold, or is dis-
agreeable, or has been disappointed, or has received bad news, or an
unpleasant truth, is said to look “Dumpy.”
Lateness of the Season.
WE saw last week, in the Park, a pair of Ducks, of the most spotless
white, but the cold was so intense that they instantly ran in, and we
have not seen them since. The London Ducks—for they are always
observed in pairs—are an extremely chilly bird. The least drop of
water sends them flying, and they do not stop till they get under
shelter. This is most extraordinary in this bird, for it is well known to
naturalists, that the Duck is, generally speaking, very fond of the rain,
and, instead of running away from water, takes it as naturally as a tee-
totaller. The London Ducks, which are the surest signs of an early
summer, are very late indeed this season.
I AM NOT WHAT I SEEM.
THE above would be an excellent motto for some trowsers recently
made by a Manchester operative, who has just turned out a complete
pair of “continuations” without a single seam. Such garments cannot
be considered unseemly, notwithstanding the peculiarity of their con-
struction; but it may be said that, if his plan should be generally
adopted, needles would become needless, and the population would be
curtailed of its tailors.
THE HOUSELESS COMMONS.
It is not generally known that the representatives of the people are
only in lodgings at the present time; for until their own House is com-
pleted, they are occupying “genteel apartments,” the rent of which is
paid from the public Treasury.
We are therefore interested in knowing how the * for their
permanent occupation, is, going on; and we are glad to hear that,
‘weather permitting,” the Commons are to go into their new House
forthwith ; but if the evenings should become cold, the Commons must
keep on for a week or two longer in their present lodgings. We cannot
see that there need be any want of warmth, for there are always
members ready to make the House almost too hot to hold anything.
Much curiosity has been excited in the minds of several M.P.'s, by
the presence of nine enormous boilers, which are standing in the
uadrangle, and the intended uses of which boilers are rather dubious.
here is surely enough of “Bubble, bubble, Toil and trouble,” in the
House without the introduction of nine tremendous boilers, which it is
said by some are designed for the express, purpose of enabling those
who make a display of their indignation to boil over with it. The wags
of the lobby, were the other night very active on the subject of these
vast reservoirs of hot water; and a Parliamentary wit, one of whose
jokes was once permitted to appear by courtesy in the pages of Punch,
was heard to remark, that the nine boilers looked as if the Commons
intended boiling themselves to prevent others from roasting them.
The M.P. who perpetrated this deserves, in our opinion, not simply a
roasting but a basting also, for his atrocity.

FAMILY METAPHYSICS.
AMoNG the recent literary births, we observe that of a Magazine
called the British Controversialist. Our new-born contemporary has
mooted the following points of controversy:—
Is beauty a quality inherent in objects? -
Is an hereditary *. preferable to an elective one P and, Ought
capital punishments to be abolished P -
t, has been determined by the most profound female philosophers-
the best judges, of course, in all questions about beauty—that so far
from beauty being inherent in any §. the very nature of all objects,
or that which causes an chject to be an object, is downright ugliness.
That an hereditary monarchy is preferable, is clear from the well-known
circumstance that an elective sovereign very seldom succeeds. As to the
abolition of capital punishments, we really must say that we wonder at
the presumption of anybody who can raise such a question after it has
been so satisfactorily disposed of by—our innate modesty forbids us to
say whom.
Civic Inconsistency.
THE Metropolitan Interments Bill is complained of in the City as
º: of a system of centralisation, . This is a strange objection, coming
rom those who may be truly, said to go the whole hog in centralising,
by keeping up their Smithfield in the middle of London.

PUNCH AMONG THE PICTURES.
FLIGHT THE FIRST.
HIs 'is the month of Ex-
hibitions. The flowers
come out and the Aca-
demy º: its tulip-
bed, and the little Water
Colour parterres blossom
unobtrusively, like prim-
rose patches and violet
banks, into fresh Coxes,
and sunshiny BENNETs,
and fresh green DA-
VIsons, and harmonious
CoPLEY FIELDINGs. So,
in this merry month of
May, Mr. Punch puts on
his spectacles, pays his
shillings, and may be
seem, any day that the
sun shines, between ten
and two, choosing un-
fashionable hours (when
something may be seen
besides pretty faces and
tasteful bonnets), cata-
logue in hand, slowly
gazing his way through
the Exhibitions. Mr.
Punch loves pictures:
from his box in bye-streets, he is accustomed to look down on so many, and to note
them too, at a time that the audience conceive we are thinking of nothing but
how to compass the destruction of the doctor, or to cheat the terrible gentleman
who carries us off in the fifth act.
Ah! pretty, housemaid Mary, who lingered with the beer, yesterday morning,
with that meat little bit of a cap, so prettily arranged on that shining, sleek, golden
hair of thine, the checked apron thrown º over the foaming pot, and thy blue
eyes making, believe to laugh at me, while all the while they were eager to cast
themselves down under the impassioned gaze of that guardsman—little did you
think, Mary, that I, Punch, was sketching the up in my mind's eye-but no
mater for that, except in so far as it connects itself with this article, - - -
There is one thing Punch wishes to say, first of all. He is not going to give his
readers a running commentary on a catalogue, with “Pishes,” “Pshaws,” notes of
admiration, &c. &c. He would rather talk with the artists than sit in judgment on
º: pictures—one by one—and he would rather utter his own thoughts than do
Cluner.
I have been to all the Exhibitions now open, and from all of them—except the
pair of Water-colours, of which hereafter—I have brought away one strong and
painful impression—which I must get off my mind.
Is painting a living art in England at this moment?
Is there a nineteenth century?
Are there men and women round about us, doing, acting, suffering? - -
Is the subject-matter of Art, clothes? or is it men and women, their actions,
passions, and sufferings?
I ask these questions of myself, and of my readers—especially the artists among
them—because I am driven to grievous doubt about them when I look round the
walls of the Picture Exhibitions.
If. Art is vital, should it not somehow find food among living events, interests
and incidents? is our life, at this day, so unideal, so devoid of all sensuous an
9utward picturesqueness and beauty, that for subjects to paint we must needs go
back to the Guelphs and GHIBELINEs, or to CHARLEs THE SEcoRD, or WILLIAM
THE THIRD, or GEORGE THE SEcond P --
Because it seems as if the painters found it so. I see no homely life anywhere in
your pictures. I see abundance of bric & brac, and MR. NATHAN. Very wonderful
velvet doublets, undeniable silk hose, marvellous carved furniture, and very often a
pretty set of features atop of the velyet doublets and silk hose aforesaid; but human
emotion, human passion, the thing that interests me as a man, Inowhere see.
How is this, my painters? If I read books, it is not for the beauty of the type,
9r the subtle devices of the binding, but for the meaning I get out of the words.
I see a stage play with pleasure, -which is a picture in action—it is not for the
glory of MR. Cooper's coat, or MADAME WESTRIs's purple velvet polka, but for
the humour, or wit, or passion, or situation, that they help to make visible, and
put into action.
But with your pictures it cannot be so. -
My eye is regaled by their charm of colour, often-delighted by their harmony
of line and skill of arrangement, often—attracted by the prettiness of your faces,
often and often; but for meaning—for thought shadowed out by you to impress me
-ſºr deep and true expression—where are they?
Shall I fell you the sad truth, as it appears to me, of nine-tenths of you, and not the
least skilful either? You appear to me like perfect masters of an alphabet writing
nonsense verses: like carpenters, masters of your tools, constructing chairs that can't
be sat upon, tables that won’t stand, and beds that can’t be laid in-in short, of men
doing a work whereof the main aim, scope, and purpose, is lost sight of altogether.

EXTRAORDINARY DISPATCH.
CoNSIDERABLE sensation was created on the London
Exchange, one day last week, by the arrival, atllo'clock P.M.,
of a gentleman from Hammersmith. He had been deputed
by a contemplated new Omnibus Company, to, test the
capabilities of the route, and the possibility of shortenin
the time now occupied in the journey. The usual ;
varies from two to four hours by some of the existing con-
vºyances, and a company is understood to be in the course
of formation, with a view to the acceleration of the transit,
$o that it may be performed within something like an
hour-and-a-half on an aver e. The gentleman, left the
Broadway at 9A. M., and reaching Kensington at half-past,
instead of waiting the customary twenty minutes, pro:
ceeded by a special 'bus to Sloane Street, where a pause
of a quarter-of-an-hour occurred for the filling of the
nose-bags, and other minor matters. The vehicle then
;: at accelerated speed as far as the Regent Circus,
iccadilly, which was gained by a quarter-past 10 o'clock,
and having next made for Charing Cross, the customary
stoppage for conversation occurred at the corner of Trafalgar
Square, at the conclusion of which the 'bus pushed on to
its destination. The gentleman who had carried out this
novel enterprise was received with loud cheers, when it was
known he had come in two hours from Hammersmith.
THE CHARTER OF PROTECTION.
THE "demonstrations” now going on at the various
taverns throughout the country and within the metropolis
remind us of the days of REYNoLDISM and CUFFEydom,
when Holywell Street publishers were sending to Down.
ing Street for the keys of office, and a dirty little half-
caste tailor was volunteering to lead a million of his fellow
men to death or victory over a carton Kennington Common.
The HowLERs and the CHowLERs are in a rabid state on
the subject of Protection, which *:: are determined to
galvanise, even though they throw the country into con-
vulsions by their shocks and experiments. The HowLERs
and the CHowLERs are taking the same line as the DUFFEYs,
the CUFFEYs, the SNUFPEys, and the rest of the agitators
of John Street, Fitzroy Square, as far as language is con-
cerned, though they have not yet arrived at the only prac-
ticable result, of the Currey, DUFFEy, and SNUFFEY
movement, which was the breaking of an immense quantity
of glass, the pillaging of a few shops, and the emptying of
sundry pockets. - -
It is from a sort of Animals' Friend Society feeling that
we advise these Protectionist howlers of sedition to stop in
time, lest it may be demanded that the same justice should
be meted out to them as was done upon the poor ignorant
creatures whose tone, it seems, the fashion to imitate.
CHowLER boasted that he and his party had with them
nine-tenths of the horses of the country. He might have
claimed the whole of the other class of quadrupeds as his
allies without the slightest fear of contradiction.
Londoners and their Lungs.
A SELECT Committee of the House of Commons is en-
gaged in considering the question as to the establishment
of a great Ce tral Gas Consumers' Company. The Central
Gas Consumers are an important body, as they comprise
all the inhabitants of the heart of the Metropolis. The
quantity of gas which they consume is enormous, including,
not only that which they burn, but also the whole of the
seous matter emanating from sewers, cesspools, and dead
É. which they are continually breathing.
Mr. Bright and his Mill.
WITH a very sharp twinge of mental pain we observed
that MR._BRIGHT, the other evening, "opposed LoRD
RoBERT GRosvenoR's motion for an inquiry relative to
the sanitary condition of the journeymen bakers. We
have a great respect for MR. BRIGHT, and for the Mill
| which he represents; but we wish he would be content
with representing the Cotton-Mill, and not constitute him;
self the champion of that Mill by means of which Capital
| grinds Labour.

THEREBY HANGS No TAIL. . . . . .
ONE of those ingenious and ever-watchful, gentlemen, the astro-
nomers, who may be termed the police of the skies, and are ever on the
look-out for suspicious characters among the stars, or luminous bodies
having no ; means of existence, has written to the Times,
announcing the detection of a new comet. It is very clear
that there , is no escaping the vigilance, of the astronomical
detective force, and the new comet that has just been observed
makes his appearance under circumstances of more than ordinary in-
terest, for he is declared to be “without a tail,”—a fact which seems
to indicate the presence of the comet in some meteorological disturb-
ances of a very violent character. . As there is a good deal of difficulty
in finding names for all the new comets that are continually appearing,
we beg leave to propose that the one which has just come forth without
a tail, should go by the title of the Comet Spencer. -

A REGULAR MULL.
THE CHANCELLOR or THE ExchequER introduces another Stamp
Bill, in which are incorporated, he tells us, all MR. MULLING's sug.
gestions. We should have thought there had been quite mullings
enough in this measure already.
CASE o
F CAUDLE.
THE WONDERFUL PROPERTIES OF RENT.
“THE FreeTrader,” growls a Pro-Corn-Law organ, “cannot deny that
the entire abolition of rent would not enable the occupier to cultivate
at a profit.” - - -
Fºgo, levy a bread-tax which shall pay the rental of the United
Kingdom, and yield a profit to all the farmers in Great Britain and
Ireland into the bargain! - -
But the FreeTrader has more to swallow. “And,” continues our
slightly paradoxical contemporary, “he has discovered that those whº
are most distressed, are those who have no landlord between them and
their returns, but cultivate themselves the soil that descended to them
from their fathers.” . - ...
Therefore, having rent to pay is a positive advantage to the farmer;
Agricultural subtraction is #. same thing as simple, addition. Renº
is like mercy, “it blesseth him that gives and him that, takes;” and
the tenant in paying his landlord aggrandises himself. “Fair is foul,
and foulis fair.” Wiinus is plus, and pus is minus; and so Pro-Corn-Law
reasoning brings us to a regular nonplus.
A Rotten CAUSE-Among the opponents of the Extra-Mural Inter.
ments Bill are a good . we fear, who attack it on the most corrupt
private grounds,-private burial grounds.

ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
III.-ON THE BENEFITS OF BEING A FOGY.
IN possession of the right and privilege of garrulity which is accorded
to old age, I cannot allow that a single side of paper should contain all
that I have to say in respect, to the manifold advantages of being a
Fogy. I am a Fogy, and have been a young man. I see twenty women
in the world constantly to whom I would like to have given a lock of
my hair in days when my pate boasted of that ornament; for whom my
heart felt tumultuous emotions, before the victorious and beloved
MRs. PACIFIco subjugated it. If I had any feelings now, MRs. P.
would order them and me to be quiet: but I have none; I am tranquil
-yes, really tranquil º as my dear LEONoRA is .."; opposite
to me at this minute, and has an askance glance from her novel
to my paper as I write—even if I were not tranquil, I should say that I
was), but I am quiet: I have passed the hot stage; and I do not know
a pleasanter and calmer feeling of mind than that of a respectable person
of the middle age, who can still be heartily and generously fond of all
the women about whom he was in a passion and a fever in early life.
If you cease liking a woman when you cease loving her, depend on it,
that one of you is a bad, one. You are parted, never mind with what
pangs on either side, or by what circumstances of fate, choice, or neces-
sity,+you have no money or she has too much, or she likes somebody
else better, and so forth; but an honest Fogy should always, unless
reason be given to the contrary, think well of #, woman whom he has
once thought well of, and remember her with kindness and tenderness,
as a man remembers a place where he has been very happy.
A proper management of his recollections thus constitutes a very
great item in the happiness of a *ś, I, for my part, would rather
remember–, and H, and—, (Idare not mention names, for isn’t
my LEONORA pretending to read “the Initials,” and peeping over my
shoulder f) than be in love over again. . It is because I have suffered
prodigiously from that passion that I am interested in beholding others
undergoing the malady. I watch it in ball-rooms (over my cards, where
I and the old ones sit), and dinner-parties. Without sentiment, there
would be no flavour in life at all. I like to watch young folks who are
fond of each other, be it the housemaid furtively engaged smiling and
flººk with John, through the area railings; be it Miss and the
aptain whispering in the embrasure of the drawing-room window-
4mant, is interesting to me, because of amavi-of course, it is
MRs. PACIFICO I mean.
. All Fogies of good breeding and kind condition of mind, who go about
in the world much, should remember to efface themselves—if I may
use a French phrase—they should not, that is to say, thrust in their
old mugs on all occasions. When the people are marching out to
dinner, for instance, and the Captain is sidling up to Miss, Fogy,
because he is twenty years older than the Captain, should not push
himself forward to arrest that young fellow, and carry off the disap-
pointed girl on his superannuated rheumatic old elbow. When there is
any ºf of this sort going on (and a man of the world has posses-
sion of the carte du pays with half an eye), I become interested in a
picture, or have something particular to say to pretty Polly the parrot,
or to little ToMMy, who is not coming in to dinner, and while I am
talking to him, Miss and the Captain make their little arrangement.
In this way I managed only last week to let young BILLINGTON and the
lovely BLANCHE PouTER get together; and walked down stairs with my!
hat for the only partner of my arm. Augustus ToPLADY now, because
he was a Captain of º almost before BILLINGTON was born,
would have insisted upon his right of precedence over BILLINGTON, who
only got his troop the other day.
Precedence 1. Fiddlestick! Men squabble about precedence becaus
they are doubtful about their condition, as Irishmen will insist upon it
that you are, determined to insult and trample upon their beautiful
country, whether you are thinking about it or no; men young to the
world mistrust the bearing of others towards them, because they mis-
trust themselves. , I have seen many sneaks and much cringing of
course in the world; but the fault of gentlefolks is generally the con-
trary—an absurd doubt of the intentions of others towards us, and a
perpetual assertion of our twopenny dignity, which nobody is thinking
of wounding.
As a young, man, if the Lord I knew did not happen to notice me,
the next time. I met him, I used to envelope myself in my dignity, and
treat his Lordship with such a tremendous hauteur and killing coolness
9f demeanour, that you might have fancied I was an Earl at least, and
he a menial upon whom I trampled. Whereas he was a simple, good-
natured creature, who had no idea of insulting or slighting me, and,
indeed, scarcely any idea about any subject except racing ºf shooting.
Young men have this uneasiness in society, because they are thinking
about themselves: Fogies are happy, and tranquil because they are
taking advantage of, and enjoying, without suspicion, the good-nature
and good offices of other well-bred people.
Have you not often wished for yourself, or some other dear friend
ten thousand a-year? It is natural that you should like such a good
thing as ten thousand a-year; and all the pleasures and comforts which
it brings. So also it is natural that a man should like the society of
people well-to-do in the world; who make their houses pleasant, who
gather pleasant persons about them, who have fine pictures on their
walls, pleasant books in their libraries, pleasant parks and town and
country houses, good cooks and good cellars: if I were coming to dine
with you, I would rather a good dinner than a bad one ; if so-and-so is
as good as you and possesses these things, he, in so far, is better than you
who do not possess them : therefore I had rather go to his house in
Belgravia than to your lodgings in Kentish Town. That is the rationale
of living in good company. An absurd, conceited, high-and-mighty
young man hangs back, at once insolent and bashful; an honest, simple,
quiet, easy, clear-sighted Fogy steps in and takes the goods which the
gods provide, without elation as without squeamishness.
It is only a few men who attain simplicity in early life. This man
has his conceited self-importance to be cured of; that has his conceited
bashfulness to be “taken out of him,” as the phrase is. You have a
disquiet which you try to hide, and you put on a haughty guarded
manner. You are suspicious of the good-will of the company round
about you, or of the estimation in which they hold you. You sit mum
at table. It is not your place to “put yourself forward.” You are
thinking about yourself, that is; you are º: about that personage
and everybody else; that is, you are not frank; that is, you are not
well-bred; that is, you are not agreeable. I would instance my young
friend MUMFORD as a painful example—one of the wittiest, cheeriest,
cleverest, and most honest of fellows in his own circle; but having the
honour to dine the other day at MR. HoPANob's, where His Excellency
the Crimean Minister and several gentlemen of honour and wit were
assembled, MUMFORD did not open his mouth once for the purposes of
conversation, but sat and ate his dinner as silently as a brother of
La Trappe.
He was thinking with too much distrust of himself (and of others by
consequence) as TopLADY was thinking of himself in the little affair in
; to which I have alluded in the former chapter. When
MUMFORD is an honest Fogy, like some folks, he will neither distrust
his host, or his company, or himself; he will make the best of the hour
and the people round about him; he will scorn tumbling over head-and-
heels for his dinner, but he will take and give his part of the good
things, join in the talk and laugh unaffectedly, nay, actually tumble
over head-and-heels, perhaps, if i. has a talent that way; not from a
wish to show off his powers, but from a sheer good humour and desire
to oblige. Whether as guest or as entertainer, your part and business in
society is to make people as happy and as easy as you can; the master
ives you his best wine and welcome—you give, in your turm, a smiling
ace, a disposition to be pleased and to please: and my good young friend
who read this, don’t doubt about yourself, or think about your precious
person. When you have got on your best coat and waistcoat, and have
your dandy shirt and tie arranged—consider these as so many settled
things, and go forward and through your business.
That is why people in what is called the great world are commonly
better bred than persons less fortunate in their condition: not that
they are better in reality, but from circumstances they are never uneasy
about their position in the world: therefore they are more honest and
simple: therefore, they are better bred than GROWLER, who scowls at
the great man a 'defiance and a determination that he will not be
trampled upon: or poor FAWNER, who goes quivering down on his
knees, and licks my Lord’s shoes. But I think in our world—at least in
my experience—there are even more G.Rowl.ERs than FAwNERs.
It will be seen, by the above remarks, that a desire to shine or to
occupy a marked place in society, does not constitute my idea of hap-
piness, or become the character of a discreet Fogy. Time, which has
dimmed the lustre of his waistcoats, allayed the violence of his feelings,
and sobered down his head with grey, should give to the whole of his life
a quiet neutral tinge; out of which calm, and reposeful condition an
honest old Fogy looks on the world, and the struggle there of women
and men. I doubt whether this is not better than struggling §:
for you preserve your interest, and do not lose your temper. Succeed-
ing? hat is the great use of succeeding P Failing Where is the
great harm It seems to you a matter of vast interest at one time of
your life whether you shall be a lieutenant or a colonel—whether you
shall or shall not be invited to the Duchess's party—whether you shall
get the place you and a hundred other competitors are trying for-
whether Miss will have you or not: what the deuce does it, all matter
a few years afterwards? Do you, Jon Es, mean to intimate a desire
that History, should occupy herself with your paltry personalty?
The Future does not care whether you were a captain or a private
soldier. You get a card to the Duchess's party; it is no more or less
than a ball or breakfast like other balls or breakfasts. You are half-
distracted because Miss won't have you and takes the other fellow,
or you get her (as I did MRs. PACIFICO) and find that she is, quite
a different thing from what you expected. Psha! These things
appear as naught—when Time passes—Time the consoler—Time the
anodyne—Time the grey calm satirist, whose sad smile seems to say,

Look, O, man, at the vanity of the objects you pursue, and of jour-
self who pursue them! - - -
But on the one hand, if there is an alloy in all success, is there not

FEARFUL FALL AND DECLINE OF THE LAW.
Y our letters we find
that the Lawyers
are crying out
most piteously a-
gainst the reduc-
tions that are made
every Session in
the profits of the
Law. If that sys-
tem continue, they
declare the pro-
ſession will be made
so contemptible,
that no gentleman
will think of follow-
ing it. A Chancery
Suit will be a poor,
miserable affair,
that will be over
in a couple of
weeks, and a Bank-
ruptcy Commission
will scarcely enable
the poor practi-
tioner to keep his
carriage. hese
will be dreadful
times for the Law-
yers, who will be
compelled, , for a
livelihood, to issue
writs against one another. The Insolvents’ Court will be filled with
most heart-rending cases of legal destitution, and Basinghall Street will
be occupied from º to day with winding up the accounts of Chancer
Lane. The Inns will follow, and the Law will become such a Paria
of a profession, that it will be universally shunned, excepting, by the
most reckless, or the very poorest. Recruiting-parties will have to
beat up the most wretched neighbourhoods, in the hopes of finding
some forlorn, youth whose misery may drive him, as a last extremity,
to “follow the Law,” and disobedient sons and unruly apprentices
will be packed off to Lincoln's Inn, as they formerly were sent to
sea, to be reclaimed by its trials and hardships. Who knows but the
Bar, also, may be reduced to a state of such abject penury, that
we may see a Joseph ADY sitting on the woolsack, sending out
letters to all clients, to the effect that, if they have their causes
tried before him, and will send him a sovereign, they may probably
“hear of something to their advantage.”
The following has been confidentially sent to us by one of the most
respectable practitioners in Carey Street, as the copy of a Bill of Costs,

The Bill is much longer, but we have given sufficient to prove the
extreme lowness of the charges. The worst is, the poor Lawyers receive
no pity. ... Every one laughs at them. Their misery seems to be a joke
universally enjoyed. , Perhaps the retribution is but just. Those who
proverbially have had no pity for others in distress, are properly punished
if they receive none, now that they are distressed themselves.

PATHOLOGICAL EXHIBITION AT THE ROYAL
ACADEMY.
(Noticed by our Surgical Adviser.)
THE Painter has hitherto done little for Medicine but hold its pro-
fessors up to ridicule. This year, however, our science has received a
tribute in the picture No. 518, at the Royal Academy’s Exhibition.
The interest of this work is purely pathological; the figures in it being
simply illustrations of the scrofulous or strumous diathesis. Their
emaciated bodies, their shrunken legs, and tumid ancles, are the well-
known characteristics of that morbid state of system. The incipient
opdema of the lower extremities is faithfully portrayed; though, in con-
nection with this symptom, which indicates far-gone disease, the
abdominal tension might have been more strongly marked. The boy,
advancing with the bowl of water, exemplifies a splendid case of rhachitis,
or rickets; and the osteological distortions of his frame have been cor-
rectly copied from the skeleton. The child in the centre is expressively
represented with the red hair, light eyebrows, and mottled complexion,
which betoken the extreme of struma. The female figure kissing it,
apparently its mother, is endowed by the artist with the same pecu-
liarities, in accordance with the law of hereditary transmission. With
a nice discernment, too, the squalid filth for which the whole group is
remarkable, is associated with a disorder notoriously connected with dirt.
The drawing of the figures evinces minute study in the demonstration-
IOOm.
To render the phenomena of morbid anatomy is clearly the speciality
of the artist. His talent for exact imitation, properly applied, might
preserve for us many specimens which we vainly endeavour to keep in
spirits. The productions of his pencil, thus directed, would eclipse
º in BAILLIERE's shop-window; but he should limit himself
to the strictly human subject. No. 518 has no title; but subjoined
to it there is a text suggesting that it is meant for the Holy Family.
Now the persons depiced in it seem to be mere portraits, taken from
life at the Orthopoedic Institution. Though interesting to the eye of
medicine, to the non-professional beholder they are unpleasant—not to
Say, revolting. They appear to savour, as has been intimated, of an
unacquaintancs with soap and water much at variance with the maxim
which adjoins cleanliness to sanctity, Scrofula, moreover, is a Northern
disease; and its antecedents, besides nastiness, are irregularities in
living. The figures in question are so many examples of the conse-
quences of transgressing the laws of health. The genius requisite for
“High Art” should include some creative power, sense of beauty, and
perception of congruities and incongruities. It will be a pity if this
gentleman does not turn his abilities—which, in the mechanical way,
are great—to the illustration of Cooper's Surgical Dictionary; and |
leave the Testament alone.
THE ANTI-EDUCATION LEAGUE SUBSCRIPTION.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to SIR. Robert HARRY INGLIS,
and begs to ask whether the Honourable Member for Oxford, Enlighten-
ment, and Toleration, has any idea of the number of those persons,
Churchmen and Dissenters, who share his views on the subject of
education? . Because, in the first place, by insisting on religious instruc-
tion as an indispensable accompaniment to secular education, whilst
differing among themselves as to...what religion to teach, they combine
to keep some eight or nine millions of #. MAJESTY's subjects in
ignorance: Secondly, inasmuch as it has occurred to Mr. Punch that
possibly they might be numerous enough to subscribe, between them,
the trifling sum of £2,000 a day, in which they are morally, if not legally,
indebted to the nation. Precisely this amount, according to the Times,
does Government spend upon the “maintenance, supervision, and cor-
rection” of convicts, or for “Prison and Convict services.” Hereunto
might be added the further expense involved in the prosecution of
offenders; however, Mr. Punch does not wish to be too hard on SIR
RoBERT HARRY INGLIS and his confederates. But it is ruled in fora
conscientia by Mr. Justice Punch, that they whose mystical polemics
revent the multitude from being taught plain morals are bound to
efray some part of the damage accruing from their obstinate bigotry.
Mr. Punch, therefore, proposes to trouble the honourable Baronet, and
all who side with him on the Education Question, for that same £2,000
per diem, in order to pay for the Prison and Convict services necessitated
by the want of schooling.
POLITICAL RUMOURS.
MR. DISRAELI passed Buckingham Palace yesterday, and looked up
at the drawing-room-windows three times. On his way home, he
looked in at Apsley House, for the street door happened to be open at

ese racts.

PUNCH'S HAND-BOOK TO HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE.
THE Operatic department of Her
Majesty's Theatre we have
already described as a mo-
narchy presided over º a
reigning Queen of Song, but
the iº of the Ballet
is usually disputed by two
or three candidates. These
contests may, in some degree,
be compared to the Wars of
the Roses, for the emblems
of victory are ſº floral
of bo
and consist uquets
thrown at the feet of the
conqueror. Ho is thus
paid where it is due, since
- the feet are the arms chiefly
employed in the great strug-
fi §: ascendancy in the
el.
Those who contemplate the
delicious softness of the
scenery, with its canvas bowers of profiled bliss, its woodwork woods,
its groves to which the . ots of art have supplied the verdancy of
nature; those who have looked on those pictures of peace—forgetting for
a moment that they are merely carpenter’s piece-work—would little sus-
pect the turbulent feelings that agitate the groups inhabiting these appa-
rently happy valleys... Secluded from the world by an impassable barrier
of ever-burning gas-lights, nymphs are seen º; round fountains
gushing with a material that sparkles but never splashe
santry gambols in white satin slippers on a village green, from which no
moisture arises to damp their shoes or their spirits, while, sometimes,
the scenery is celestial, and goddesses repose on clouds, having none of
the unpleasant density of vapour, but being substantial enough to sit
upon. Looking on such scenes as these, the poet might fairly hope to see
nothing but tranquillity in the bosoms of the inhabitants, but the
philosopher, rudely knocking the hat over the poet's eyes, proceeds
with the spectacles of fact to look into matters on his own account,
and the poet, hailing imagination's cab, starts for the realms of fancy,
.# are always to be found within a very short fare of sad and sober
reality.
Hand in hand with the philosopher, who, with the Turk's-head of
materialism, is for ever brushing down the cobwebs of idealism, that
overhang the romantic passages of life, we proceed to test the bliss-
fulness of the ballet. ... - - -- -
The difficulty of * two suns to shine in the same hemisphere
been suggested by astronomers; but the excessive trouble of
getting two or more stars of the ballet to exhibit their brilliance in the
same pas has never been thought of by the savans, whose subjects of
contemplation are at all events guided by fixed laws, while the dazzling
bodies that float before the eyes of him who would read the stars ºf
Her Majesty's Theatre are with difficulty subjected to any rule what-
ever. Nevertheless, the apparently impossible result has occasionally
been accomplished, though we might almost as soon expect to see
Sagittarius d in hand with, Virgo, executing a pas to the band
of Orion, as hope to witness the conjunction of three stars of the
ballet without a conyulsion of the most serious character. . We do not
wonder that Her Majesty's Theatre requires the constant services of
an Aquarius, who, with watering-pot in hand, is perpetually coolin
the ground that must be impregnated with all the materials for a vol.
cano, by the heat of so many contests.
The astronomer may well, turn away baffled from the stars of the
ballet, for the diplomatist is the only magician who can read or regulate
their occasionally combined movements. Men practised in the most
subtle regulations of Court etiquette, and skilled in deciding points of
precedence as fine as the point of a needle-men who could bundle up
together gold, silver, and half-a-dozen other sticks without giving
offence to either—men who could satisfy the claims of every degree of
knighthood, take the relative measures of any pair of garters, and deal
with a couple of Baths without getting into hot water; even such men
as these would find the points of precedence in a pas de deua, trois, or
quatre, far more difficult of adjustment than the matters above alluded
to. The achievement of the production of Les Graces, presenting
together CARLOTTAGRISI, MARIE TAGLIONI, and AMALLA FERRARIs,
Terpsichore's three favourite daughters, and their pas or grand pa, has
indeed called forth the cunningest diplomacy of all concerned in a com-
bination which seemed too good to be true, and which at one time
would have been pronounced impossible.
We can º: the numerous consultations that must have been
held by the Cabinet of Her Majesty's Theatre on this momentous
question. Which of the fair trio should commence was, no doubt, the
subject of anxious deliberation, which was at last put an end to by the
5. A happy pea-||
bright idea of their all appearing at once in a Fº and descending
together from the same pedestal. The difficulty of the premier pas was
thus got over, but this is not the only pas qui coute in such a very
momentous ahair as a pas de frois, where not a step must be taken that
is not properly weighed, and its exact, weight distributed in exactly
equal proportions among the Three Graces. If EUPHRosYNE has a
movement of the music to herself, consisting of so many bars, THALLA
and EGIE must be allowed to have their feet on the bars separately for
the same period. If EUPHRosYNE occupies for a moment the centre
place between her sister Graces, THALIA and EGIE feel it to be the
centre of attraction, and would murmur on both sides, or grumble right
and left, if they did not in their turn take the coveted position. If
THALIA is supported for an instant by the hand of EUPHRosyNE at the
waist, enabling the former Grace to maintain a horizontal line between
the tip of her toe and the tip of her nose, at an altitude of three feet,
THALLA will be expected to serve as a temporary P. while
EUPHROSYNE forms herself into an arch, of which her head, bent back-
wards to the utmost possible extent, seems to be nearly forming one of
the buttresses. If EGIE has been standing º: during these
ingenious feats of what may be termed the civil engineering of the
human frame, she will expect in her turn to have the assistance of one
of her sister Graces as a fulcrum or lever, while she arranges herself
into some mathematical figure that would astonish a senior wrangler by
its application of the best rules of art to the attractions of nature. It
speaks highly for the equanimity of the Queens of the Ballet that, with
a rival in their hands, they have never been known to let that rival drop
at a moment when the victim, if left to herself, would scarcely have had
a leg to stand upon. -
The . of upholding a competitor for public. º: can only be
understood by one who, with jealousy raised to its highest pitch by a
whirlwind of delight and a hurricane of bravas at the achievements of a
rival, and with muscular strength taxed to its utmost pitch by that
rival's weight, can still sustain that rival in her enviable position, and
look down upon her with a smile of benignity, unruffled by the pangs of
jealousy, or the hard work of bearing a load under which a porter might
wince, without much imputation on his porterhood.
THE SANITARY REFORMER TO HIS EXECUTOR.
WHEN in earth I shall calm recline,
Let no dwellings my couch be near;
Let not an atom that once was mine
Contribute to poison the atmosphere. ...
Bid them not lay me where churchyard railing
Encloses a narrow and crowded site,
Against my will and desire exhaling, .
estiferous vapours from morn till night.
Far from living men’s habitations
Let me harmlessly decompose;
None of my chemical emanations
Shall injure a soul, or offend a nose; ,
Free-blowing breezes, bad gas dispelling,
Shall fragrance derive from the various bloom
Of the shrubs and the flowers, so freshly smelling,
Adorning my extra-mural tomb.
EXPENSIVE PROSELYTISM.
At the late annual meeting of the British Society for Promoting
Christianity among the Jews, it was stated that—
“During the past year six individuals, who had been under instruction by the Mis-
sionaries of the Society, had been baptised.”
If this well-meaning Society made no more than half-a-dozen converts
among the Israelites in one year, it certainly takes a great deal to con-
vert a Jew. For, according to the Secretary’s report,
“The balance-sheet showed the total receipts (including a balance from the last
report) to be £40340s. 5d., and the expenditure, £368717s. 8d."
The conversion of these Hebrews, them, cost upwards of £600 a head;
money well laid out, truly, but, considering the educational and other ges-
titution existing around us, we think it might have been laid out a little
better. Besides, there is a mode of Christianising the Children of
Israel, at very small expense. The least costly and most effectual way
of promoting Christianity among the Jews would be that of getting it
practised among Christians.
A DUKE OUT OF PLACE.
THE exclamation of all on hearing that the DUKE OF RICHMOND
took the chair at the disaffected, farmers’ meeting in a place of such
radical celebrity as the Crown and Anchor, is “My Stars and Garters!”

MR, BRIGGS HAS GONE TO THE EXHIBITION.—A BOY HOLDS HIS HORSE IN THE MEANTIME.
THE BRITISH LION AN ULTRA CHARTIST
A GENERAL meeting of that peculiar class of politicians interested in
the notorious Land Scheme took place on Tuesday last week at the
Crown and Anchor. The chair was occupied by FEARGUs O'RICHMOND,
who delivered a * inflammatory speech, qualified by a judicious re-
commendation to his ſollowers to abstain from “physical force.”
MR. ERNEST BOOKER, indulged in a furious denunciation of Free
Trade, and after asserting that the agricultural interest was in a state
of sad depression, offered to subscribe £1000 for electioneering pur-
poses. , MR. LOONEY CHOWLER hinted, in no measured language, at
the probability of a speedy, insurrection among the peasantry, and at
the policy, on the part of the farmers, of driving them to rebellion by
sending them to the workhouse. The motoriºus Rurrey Stanmore
slapped the orator on the back in approbation of his spirited views and
suggestions. MR. CUFFEY HIggiNs, of Hereford, in a short but violent
harangue, declared º the Government would not alter their
system by moral force, they (the Land Schemers) would fight for it.
The deafening applause that followed this declaration, we suppose, pre-
vented the C an from calling the Speaker to order. MANNERs, of
Young England celebrity, and Tour NAMENT EGLINToUN, also addressed
the meeting, in milder terms, certainly, than Looney and QUFFEY, yet
without making *}; protest against the sentiments and language of
those gentlemen, which, therefore, it is to be presumed, they adopt.
We trust the Government will not be ill-advised enough to put the
Felonious Speeches Act inforce against these extravagant, but, no doubt,
harmless spouters. Ministers had better take no notice of them, what.
ever they may say... The followers, or dupes, of FEARGus O'RICHMOND
will soon, perhaps, be talking of gunpowder and ginger-beer bottles, but
it will be all talk; and even if they charge their bottles, we feel sure
that they will never be so foolish as to throw any.
THE FRENCH AND THEIR FRANCHISE.

SPARE, OH SPARE, THAT POLICEMAN.
THE axe of economy has found its way into that British type of the
Australian Bush, the Bay of Herne, where the Pier Policeman has been
cut off-(in his prime)—and the place has been put under the control of
that solitary sample of the civil power, the town constable. This indi-
vidual, having now the sole responsibility of the public peace on his
shoulders, has taken to wearing oilskin epaulettes, and has got himself
up with a sort of military air that has a powerful impression on the
simple-minded inhabitants. In order to represent all the ranks of the
force in his own person, he wears a superintendent's gloves, an in-
spector's coat, a serjeant's waistcoat, and a common constable's trow-
sers. . He has laid down a series of regulations for his own guidance,
and his system is such that he keeps himself constantly au fait at all
the duties of all the ranks in the police force. He is his own inspector,
and in that capacity he takes orders from himself as superintendent,
while as serjeant he reports himself as private to himself as inspector;
and so on, until he brings himself round once more to the point he
started from.
It is understood that he promotes himself occasionally for good con-
duct, and that he now and then reduces himself to the ranks, in order
that he may learn that lesson of humiliation which is so useful to man-
kind in general, and to policemen in particular. Having no night duty,
he does not require a bull's-eye by way of lanthorn, but he sometimes
indulges in a hap'orth of bull's-eyes, by way of “keeping up the alle-
gory” with reference to this portion of a constable's accoutrements.

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE FIFTH."
MRs. MoUSER's VIEWs on THE ROYAL CHRISTENING, AND THE
LAUREATESHIP.
ExETER-HALL comes in with the gooseberries. There is nothing to
me so beautiful as a bird’s-eye look up the Strand, from Charing Cross
to Temple Bar, at the very time the lilacs have come out, and
the chesnuts in Bushy Park—every one of 'em—are like SoLOMON in
his glory. With the gooseberries 'specially, as I said before, Exeter
Hall’s in prime season. And beautiful is it to see London—par-
ticularly the Strand—sprinkled over with, folks, the pepper and salt
of the world, as I say to MoUSER, though he won’t listen to me—
husbands seldom will, and that’s why women should never marry, if
they want to be attended to—with the pepper and salt that, keep
fhis wicked town as sweet as it is, which isn't saying much, I’m bound
or it.
“If there isn't another’tato blight all over. Ireland,” said our maid
to me only yesterday, “it won’t be for want of pervoking it. They’re
going to call the royal baby PRINCE PATRICK THE FIRST, and it isn’t
likely that the ’tatoes will ever get over it.”
Now our maid’s great uncle is the Beadle of Exeter Hall—I give
her, what she asked, a pound a year more wages for the connexion, she
said she always had itſ and it’s therefore in the nature of the girl—
(it's that that makes her such a treasure to me, or there’s much she
can’t do, I shouldn’t put up with—but then, as aunt PEAcock used to
say, “You can’t have a Wonder of the World for ten pound a i. not
even with tea and sugar and followers allowed,”)—it's therefore, as I
was going to remark, in the blood of the poor thing to be alive all over
to what, as dear M.R. PLUMPTRE says, “threatens our hearths and our
homes, our pews and our properties.” With a PRINCE PATRICK some-
times sitting in the lap of our gracious QUEEN, can even the BISHOP
of Oxford, in his eel-skin apron, lay his hand upon his heart, and say
—the Church isn’t in .#
“Ma’am,” said SUsANNAH to me, and the poor thing was in a real
twitter—“Ma’am, they might as well have gone and called the babby
DAN O'Connell at once, and there an end of it. But I’ve no doubt,
Ma'am, as uncle says, that the name of PATRICK is nothing but a feeler.
If the country only puts up with that, why, in a year or two, DAN
O'Conneil, will be sure to follow, with a PRINCE Pope Pius to end
the business. This, as uncle says, is the opinion, not only of MB.
PLUMPTRE hisself, but the downright belief of MR. fºr Newgate.”
“I tell you what it is, Susan NAH,” says I. “This christening re-
solves iſ: into a great kitchen question. To call a Royal baby
PATRICK is to strike a blow at the English servant. SUSANNAH" says
I, “you must have protection. With a PRINCE PATRIck at home in
the palace, how long will people put in the papers—No Irish need apply?
It’s a question that begins in the kitchen, and, as I now see it, doesn’t
stay there; but goes into all parts of society. More than that, there
isn't a good, wholesome English name that won’t feel it. In another
year, and there’ll be nothing baptised but PATRIcks and PHELIMs,
ERGUses and O'Connors. Not even a page in all that blessed
Belgravia that won’t give up JULIUS and OscaR, and take at once to
MIke and TEDDY.”
“Uncle's very words to a T,” said SUsANNAH; which brought into
my thoughts Exeter Hall along with the gooseberries, having our first
pudding that day, which MouseR laughed at as what he called the
association of ideas, being, as he further said, green altogether, which
I took no notice of, recollecting the advice of dear aunt PEAcock, who
always said, “When you can't answer your husband, AMELIA; when
you don’t know what to say, throw yourself upon compassion. Don't
speak: but look at him, as if you pitied him.” It’s a golden rule;
and I advise it to every poor woman who’s put upon; and, for the
matter of that, I should only like to see he one who isn't.
an º, as it 's short,” said MouseR, “what matters what a child's
e
“SusANNAH,” said I, “you may take your day out; and go and get
up a meeting. If Exeter Hall—as your uncle knows—puts up quietly
with PATRick, there’s no questioning it, in less than another year,
PRINCE Plus is sure to follow.... You may go, SUsANNAH; and I’ve no
doubt MR. Hugh M’NEILE will take the chair, as this being May, he
must be in London.”
“I’m obleeged to you, Ma'am,” said the girl. “Uncle said all along
there ought to be a meeting; if the name of PATRIck is n’t stopped, in
a couple of months, ’tatoes is nowhere. If we're to have PRINCE
PATRICK forced upon us, it's as clear as twopence, there’s an end of
the kidnies!”
“I think, MR. MouseR,” said I, turning to him when Susan NAH had
left, “I think you might leave me my own housemaid to myself. It’s
very little. I have in this house, but I think my own maid is my per-
quisite. I think, too, if children's names—whether Princes or common
| won't MR. MACAULAY—in his vol 50—put in this prophecy of
babies—arn’t the rightful property of women, it’s a pity they should
ever, be called upon to have anything to do with babies. To call a
royal child after a Popish saint—”
“Fiddlestick,” cried MoUser; “we’re all of us, more or less, called
after saints, all.’t we? ...Not to be sure,” said he, with a sneer at my
own godmother, “not that I ever heard of a SAINT AMELIA.”
"But an Irish Saint, MR. MoUSER; and so soon after the potato
blight is, I think, rather flying in the face of Exeter Hall; but, to be
sure, as MR. DE NewGATE, beautifully put it, when a heathen cabinet
tampers with the coin of the realm, principles are sure to follow. I
could have borne—and so could the Hall-–that is the country—any
Saint but a Saint from Ireland. Well, if I’d been a certain majesty,
however Imight have been put to it for a name, I should certainly have
said to myself, “No Irish need º But the palace gates once open
-who’s to lock the area gate and the door of the kitchen? And the
Privy Council, as they call themselves—if I was only in Parliament,
wouldn’t I make a motion about a few blocks and heads f—with their
hands in their pockets, hav’n’t a word to say! Now mark me, MR.
MoUSER, not that either of us will be alive at the time; but only mark
my words, then see if they don’t come true. PRINCE PATRick will be
KING PATRICK THE FIRST of all Ireland 1 That dear little baby
whether he will or no, will be inveigled some day to Dublin, crowne
against his will, and so repeal i. Union. He’ll be offered an
emerald crown and—well, all I’ll say now is this; I only hope, out
of love and duty to his beloved mother, he’ll have the strength
and the wisdom to refuse it. But when this has all happened,
mine :
and, won't , it for ever, after serve as a moral and a warning to all
royal christenings? PRINCE PATRICK! Why, MR. MouseR, the
thing's as clear as the moon at the full. All the hungry Irish will
come about the name like flies about treacle. I wonder what MR.
O'Connell, would have given for such a chance—why, he’d have given,
aye, anybody's money for it. Well, all I say just now, is this–I only
wish iºd been born man.”
“I only wish you had,” said MoUSER; and though I knew what he
meant, I wouldn't be aggravated. “It’s a great pity, Amelia,”—he
went on—“With your abilities, your power of prophesying, if you
could only have dome it in verse, you might, with luck and friends,
have been Poet Laureate; for the place is empty. As it is, don't you
think you could send in a sample * *
“And why not ?” said I. “Hasn’t somebody said a woman ought
to have the place, specially as a woman wears the crown? When I
was at school, I remember they used to say all the Muses were
women. Well, if it’s so still, why shouldn’t there be a Poetess
Laureate P. But there’s the old hypocrisy, that I spoke of before.
You can paint,and chisel, and print women as the goddesses of everything
—but to real women themselves, however you praise their shadows,
you won’t give even a crumb of solid pudding. I’ve heard it said they
used to give the Crown Poet a butt of wine; why not make a woman
the poet, and, instead of wine, give her a chest or two of teaf"
“Besides,” said MouseR, aggravating, “there is no doubt that a
female would do the thing cheaper. I think the post’s £300 a year.
Now what would you do the work for—tea and sugar included ?
We’ve given up Birth Day Odes, and all that; however, we ought to
have something for our money. Now, with a Poetess laureate, as
you call her, we might have all the Drawing-Room ceremonies put into
poetry, and her Majesty’s dress in particular run into a ballad.” -
“And why not?” said I. “And, as before there were only Nine
Muses—it’s nine MoUSER, isn't it?”
“Same as skittles,” said he.
“The Queen's Poetess Laureate might be the Tenth. Eh P’”
“Why,” said MouseR, and I could see he was going to say some-
thing, “in the matter of the real heroic verse, women can't do it.”
b t Can't do it,” said I, “and why not ? Quite as well as men, if not
etter.
“No, my dear,” said MoUSER, looking malicious, “no; impossible.
Hens don’t sing.” - -
MR. MouseR was perfectly right to jump from the table, take his
hat, and leave the house. Otherwise, what I might have answered,
nobody knows, not even, Mr. Punch,

THE WINDOW-TAX—THE GREATEST ABSORBENT
OF LIGHT.
... SINCE Government is so particular in charging for light, we wonder
it has never thought of putting a tax upon spectacles, eye-glasses, and
opera-glasses, which are all media for conveying light to i. eye, just
as much as a pane of glass. The same with the windows in a carriage,
or an omnibus, or a bathing machine. Why should they not pay the
window-tax to the same monstrous extent as the windows in a house?
These are shameful inequalities, which betray a partiality which should
exist in no tax, particularly in one which should be framed with the
strictest eye to accuracy, as the larger the frame, the larger, the pay-
ment for it. It is strange that Government should institute itself the
Great Purveyor of Light, in opposition to the Sun; with this difference,
however, that Government charges for every pane of light it lays on,
and cuts it off pretty quickly if it is not paid up exactly to the quarter,
and the Sun, gives its light for nothing. Of all monopolies, the
monopoly of light is the most cruel, and is a measure only worthy of
the dark ages. To carry out the cruelty consistently, every man who
has two eyes should be taxed for light doubly, men with only one eye
should be let off with one payment, and none should be exempt from
the tax but blind persons.
Police the Best Policy.
THE best suggestion—by far–that we have heard for the settlement
of the Greek question is, that the whole ºffair should be resolved into
a mere matter of police, and that by way of preventing further disputes,
England should be bound over to keep the Pacifico—which will be
equivalent to keeping the peace.
THE MAN THAT won’T MOVE ON.
THE Austrian Government has offered a º sum of money for a
Prize Locomotive. If it had been for a Prize Slow-coach, LoRD JoHN
RUSSELL would have stood the strongest chance of winning it.

MILK, OH ! OH ! OH ! MILK!
SoME recent accounts of the Milky Ways of the London milkmen
have filled us with a desire to have the good old days of chalk and
water back again. We knew that under the old system our insides
were simply whitewashed with a clean, if not a very wholesome prepa-
ration; but we shudder at the thought of what the London milk is
now declared to be. -
It is said that the rich creamy look of the mixture is obtained by the
use of starch, sugar of lead, and brains. Oh! that we could "dash out
our desperate brains” from our milk-jugs, and imbibe the thinnest...of
decoctions that the pump and the chilk-pin ever contributed. We
might not, perhaps, object to a dash of starch to enable us, to get
what might ; termed a stiff glass of milk—but there is something so
awful in the idea of brains, particularly as it is said they come from
the knacker's yard—that our own brain reels, swims, and performs
various other cerebral eccentricities that we know not how to describe.
We feel almost resolved to forswear the lacteal liquid altogether, and
take for our motto, as a direction to our children, “Lac milk.”

AUTO DA FE IN ESSEX
We have to inform an astonished world that an auto da Jº...has
actually taken place in England, and in the nineteenth century. This
disgusting exhibition of truculent bigotry, occurred on Tuesday last
week at Billericay, in Essex. The facts of the horrid affair are recorded
in the Morning Post. - --- -
The victim of a blind and ferocious superstition was the Editor of
the Times, vicariously burnt to ashes under the species of his journal.
A conclave of fanatics of the Protectionist order having met at the
appointed time and place, the alleged heretic was denounced by the
Rev. C. DAY, Vicar of Mucking, who appears to be one of the most
frantic and violent zealots of his sect. This Day described the Times
as an “infamous, abominable, and perjured journal,” and accused it of
attempting “to set the labourers against their employers.” The only
foundation for this charge was, that when MR. Chowler threatened
that the farmers would drive the labourers to rebellion by sending them
to the Workhouse, the Times made the very obvious remark, that such
a proceeding would only have the effect of causing them to destroy
*... and burnthrashing-machines. But this, in the eyes of sanguinary
and prejudiced judges, was enough to seal the dºom ºf the offending
journal. A voice—speaking the sentiments of the whole assembly,
exclaimed, “Burn it!”
“Yes!” cried the furious though reverend DAY, at once accuser and
judge; "Burn it, if you like!” - - - -
Then followed the execution, which is thus described by an eye-
witness:-
“A copy of the Times, placed on the top of a pole, was then brought out and formally
burnt in the market-place, amidst the execrations of those around.”
This act of barbarity is evidently the self-same proceeding with that
of the Inquisitors of Spain, who used to burn heretics, in effigy—only
when the originals were out of the way. Such awreaking of spite and
malice upon inanimate type and paper reminds us of the school boy in
Seymous's caricature, smashing the weather-glass that would point to
“Rain,” or of children generally, who beat.or.kick, the object over
which they have stumbled. The Billericay act of faith—or act of folly
—will not tend to lessen the peculiar reputation of Essex; for whilst it
evinces the º passions of the bull, it at the same time betrays the
feeble intellect of the calf.

AFFECTING SCENE.-KING SOYER RESIGNING THE GREAT STEWPAN.;
RESIGNATION OF SOYER.
ConsideBABLE excitement has, for some time past, been occasioned
at the West End, by the rumour of its being the intention of Mons.
SoYER to resign his position as Chef of the Reform Club. A few days
ago the melancholy rumour was changed into franic certainty, and it
became generally known that Soy ER had resigned the basting spoon of
office, into the hanus of the Committee, and had put his spit at their
feet. On the first announcement of this intelligence, the enquiries
were general whether LoRD John would go out with SoYER, whose
retirement, it was said, had shaken the cabinet to atoms. But on
inquiry, it was ascertained that the cabinet shaken to atoms, was a
cabinet pudding, which was being prepared at the moment, when in a
state of pitiable agitation the Chef resolved on throwing up the office
he has so long adorned.
Various causes have been assigned for the step that has been taken,
but nothing is positively known. By some it is intimated that there
has long been a coolness over the kitchen fire, and that SoYER has
vacated his office, in the hope of finding a much wider range for his P
abilities. Some insinuate that he was dissa'isfied with his subordinates,
and that on seeing a sirloin of beef going round, on the spit with
improper velocity, he expressed his horror at things taking such
a turn. -
In some quarters it is whispered that there are certain provisions
contained in a bill which the Chºf thought necessary to the maintenance
of his government; but those provisions requiring a bill of enormous
magnitude, were objected to in conmittee as extravagant, and not in
accordance with the moderate lastes of the members, but Soy ER
declared it impossible to carry on the culinary government on a paltry
scale of economy. Many of his plans required very early peas, but he
and the Commi tee having, it is said, spit upon these peas, and the
latter refusing to shell out, the Chef had no alternative. O hers give
ou', with an air of some authority, that, SoYER's schemes were so
gigantic, as to require a supply of five hundred new stewpans; but the
requisition having been characterised by an “exquisite” belonging to
the Committee as something “really stew-pan-dous,” the pride of the
Chef was offended, and he resolved at once on retirement.
-
This affair will cause much embarrassment, as it will require the filling
up of sºveral offices which the genius of SoYER was enabled to, con-
bine. There must be a minister for foreign affairs, including all the
French dishes, and none, but a successor of the PRESIDENT DU_PATY
could hope to preside over the pies. . As to the puffs, the loss of SoyRR
will not be so severely felt, as most of the puffs he was so famous for
manufacturing were for his own use.
THE THERMOMETER OF LOYALTY.
THE other day, it was apprehended that the farmers would rise; but
wheat has risen instead. º the rising of the corn-growers may be
represented as a consequence of the falling of corn; though the precise
degree of cheapness that produces insurrection has not been exactly
determined. It is, however, an ascertained law in political philosophy
that the loyalty of the agricultural Protectionist increases in temperature
in direct ratio with the price of wheat. A beautiful application of this
principle to practice is exemplified in our newly-invented Agricultural
ocket Thermometer, which indicates to a nicety the warmth of the
sentiment in question. This instrument differs from, the ordinary
thermometer in its freezing point being fixed at 38°; that is to say,
thirty-eight shillings a quarter; for pro-corn-law loyalty assumes the
character of ice long before its temperature sinks to 32°. Within the
last few weeks it has been nearly down to z ro. The degree of
“Temperate” is attained at 45°, and at 56° the farmers' loyalty boils,
wih great noise, and the extrication of much vapour. We have tested
the accuracy of our thermometer on the DUKE OF RICHMOND's
friends, ChowleR and HIGGINs, Introduc, d for a moment into such
gentlemen's pockets, it registers, precisely, the degree of loyal heat in
their hearts. - -
The Railway gastronomic Regenerator.
SINCE Soyer's resigmation, the most liberal offers have been made to
him by several Railway Companies to join their Board of Directors. The
object of securing such a celebrated chef de cuisine as Monsieur Soyº
is evidently to have the benefit of his skill in “cooking their accounts.”

FELLOWSHIP AMONG SURGEONS.
“MR. PUNCH, -
“Seyen-Asp-Twenty brisk youngfellows—Fellows by examin-
ation of the Royal College of S —met some time ago, as the
Lancet relates in full, to consider of a matter touching their honour
and glory. You must know, Mr. Punch, that we have Fellows by
Examination, and Fellows by fuck. The latter are certain members of
the College who were, so fortunate as to find favour in the eyes of the
Council, and to be dubbed by that learned body, together with itself, in
virtue of a Charter which it received in 1843. The former acquired the
honour of the Fellowship by undergoing an Examination, which the
Council, with a contempt of principle very remarkable, required of some
of its members—all of whom were previously of equal rank—and dis-
pensed with in the case of others.
.“From 1843 to the present time, the Council has been continuously
hissed and hooted for the unjust and arbitrary conduct, which it was
then guilty of, in creating an invidious distinction between co-equal
members of the same profession.
“These symptoms of public disapprobation have at length induced it
to reconsider its course, and now it has applied to Government for a
supplemental Charter, empowering it to elevate to the Fellowship,
without examination, members of a certain standing...To discuss this
proposed extension of the Fellowship, the Fellows by Examination were
convened. Three-and-twenty out of the twenty-seven that composed
the meeting, concurred in deprecating it. The view of the majority
was opposed by MR. THOMAS WAKLEY, JUN., M.R. ERICHSEN, and two
other gentlemen, names unknown.
“Certainly, Mr. Punch, you would say that, intrinsically, length of
; no more merits a scientific title than length of noses: and that
ustice would not make Seniority a present of an honour which it
forced Juniority to earn. To raise old Jolter to the level, to which
§. have made young BRISK climb, is unfairly to annul the distinction
etween B and J.
“But, Sir, why did our three-and-twenty brisk young fellows submit
to an examination, if the partial requisition of it was an injustice?
They have already recognised that right of discretionary dubbing
inst the farther exercise of which they now protest. From com-
plaining of any such act on the Council's part they are quietly
estopped.
“Let them be consoled. They may preserve the distinction of which
they are so sensitively tenacious. They are Fellows by Examination:
let them call themselves so; which is more than the Council itself can,
The danger to their dignity on the ground of which they oppose an act
of justice is imaginary; and their anxiety on that, score is superfluous
as well as unwarranted. They had better put their exclusiveness in
their pockets, and liberally agree to salute the new Fellows with “Hail
fellow, well met.” So, at least, thi
“Your Surgical Student,
* PROBE.”
THE BATTLE FOR INTRAMURAL CHURCHYARDS,
Of the Undertakers wroth,
Sing the glorious fray's renown,
When they stood up for their cloth
At the Anchor and the Crown
Where their zeal for “vested interests” was shown;
They came flocking to the Strand,
Round each hat a sable band;
And one Nodes, we understand,
Led them on.
Blank of looks as black of coat,
With eyes almost dropping brine,
Their appearance did denote
Great discomfort in the “line,”
Which with extramural burial doesn’t chime.
From among those carrion crows,
Such a deathlike odour rose,
That our stoutest held his nose
For a time.
It required no prophet's ken,
To anticipate a scene;
Since the sanitary men
An assembly did convene,
Qn behalf of the Interments’ Bill, which, won,
Qverreaching roguery strips,
And death-hunters' charges nips;
Dark and terrible eclipse
To their sun!
ROBERT GROSVENOR took the chair,
And he made a goodly speech;
They assailed him, then and there,
With howl, yell, whoop, and screech,
With hisses, shouts of “Off!” and cries of “No!”
And discussion, it was plain,
Would be utterly in vain;
Or to speak in vulgar strain,
All no go.
Then old NoDEs in rage up sprang,
And inveighed in angry tone;
There was fun in his harangue,
He so stoutly held his own;
And one pregnant observation that he made
It were pity to forget,
He those proceedings met, .
As a regular “dead set"
At his trade.
Then confusion dire ensued,
Which precluded all debate;
And a thorough row was brew’d,
Punch to stomach, thump to pate;
Though it s ems that no one met with serious harm.
And the meeting so did end
As when thunder-showers descend,
And the forests bow and bend
In the storm.
All reason clamour drowns,
To fisticuffs they fell;
And play’d at “knock-'em-downs.”
Hammer-and-tongs; pell-mell.
Meanwhile, amid the noise and the uproar,
Remember those who sleep
pits some fathoms deep,
A foul and festering heap
By the score.
Infection ever steams
From their pestilential bed,
Where fell Corruption teems
Among the crowded dead,
To aggrandise extortion; while the knave,
That in filthiest lucre rolls,
Sees his neighbours die in shoals,
Singing, “Merry the knell tolls
O'er the grave.”
A THAMES WATER LILY.
Geography for Young Ladies.
“WHERE's Hatcham P” enquired a sº upon meeting with
the name of that town in a newspaper. “Why, you, stupid!” indig-
nantly exclaimed her brother, “Hatcham is the first stage after Egham
to be sure,” and the young lady believed it.
Down ON THE NAIL.
THE Nailmakers, we are sorry to say, have joined in a very extensive
strike. The only strike we should have been glad to hear of among
tº Naimºn, would be their having hit the right mail on the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
PUTTING A PANORAMA ROUND THE EARTH.
RAVELLING is now-a-days so
cheap, that it is brought
within the means, of the
meanest pocket. A miser,
starting from Burlington
Arcade, could easily travel
round the world for five
shillings.
If this cheapness spreads
much further, the longest
and dearest journey will
shortly be from Hungerford
ºise to Paddington for
We have enjoyed many
cheap excursions lately.
* We have visited every quar-
ter of the universe at Egypt
tian Hall—have been stirred
up with the North Pole by
MR. BURFoRD in Leicester
Square—have emigrated to
New Zealand, and been
brought back again in less
than two hours by MR.
BREEs—and know every
feature of every river that
has had its likeness taken on a piece of canvas, not more than three miles
long. We have enjoyed all these little trips, and thought them...wonder-
fully cheap, and wonderfully quick—but it seems that travelling was
then in its stage-coach days of infancy. Paintings now move with the
rapidity of steam—and an artist, who has anything of the quickness of
the fox with his brush, will paint you a Panorama, long enough to go
round the Globe, in less time almost than ARIEL boasted of putting a
girdle round it. - -
The latest pictorial girdle of this kind is the Overland Mail, and a
most lovely work of art it is, radiant with beauty, and sparkling with
the most costly Indian gems. - -
We do not know the exact º of it, and really you follow its
winding course with such a happy feeling of enjoyment, that, if it were
three times as long as it is, you would still feel a regret that it had come
so abruptly to an end. - - - -
The various pictures which turn this girdle into an ever-varying
Gallery of Illustration, are taken from subjects which the traveller picks
up on his road, between Southampton Docks and Calcutta. -
These subjects are composed of half water, half sand. These materials
might be objected to as being too wishy-washy and too dry for a long
Panorama, but we can only say that, in the hands of the artists engaged,
the water is such d-ligious water, that it only gives, you a thirst for
more, and that the sand is such superior sand, that it shines with all the
interest of gold in your eyes. . . - - - - -
Moreover, the water is dancing in every direction with ships and boats,
and steamers, dressed out gaily with flags and seamen of every colour
in the world—and, besides, it has a handsome border of scenery,
with tints so dazzling, that a French ribbon would give you no more
idea of their lustrous combination, than an omelette could of one of
TURNER's º pictures. . -
The sand, also, is alive with Arabs, and omnibuses, and cara-
vans, and Cocknies dancing the Polka. Camels, too, are dying—which
is a great proof of the picture's accuracy, for we never recollect a yiew
of the Desert yet, but that there was sure to be a camel dying in it.
This poor animal must be the JoHN O'Connell of quadrupeds, for he
is always “laying down his life.” - -
The omnibuses, by-the-bye, are very like our bathing machines, with
the curtains taken off. If they are licensed to carry fourteen inside, We
should be very sorry to be the ſourteenth. They have no stand, either,
for the conductor behind, which must be very inconvenient if a Sheikh
wants to be taken up, or any “son of a dog” wants to be put down, in
the middle of the Desert:
Of the two halves, we like the sandy half the better. The fact is, that
surrounded as we are with water, and flooded as we have been with the
Nile and Mississippi, and other. Panoramas that, like SoyER's Pauper
Soup were full of .# anything but water, it is but natural that that
fluid however perfect and unlike the Thames it may be, should pall a little
on the public, and the artist's palette. This is the reason why the sand “a
sauté à nos yeux,” as the French say, with the greater pleasure, and the
pleasure must have been something very exquisite, when we assure the
reader that we *. the sand for full half an hour in our eye, and never
felt a moment's desire to have it removed. The horses do everything
but neigh. Their coats shine as if they were made out of the richest
silks and salins, and, altogether, they are so beautifully dressed, that we
think none but a lady in the height of fashion, could ride them.
Everything is turned off in the most finished, manner, excepting the
caravan, which, like a black, creeping, river, winds along, and is lost in
the distance, the camels' humps looking not unlike a long line of waves,
trying to leap over one another.
We should like to stop a whole day at Malta—and to tarry for a whole
night at Cairo, walking and mooning about, reading the Arabian Nights,
but we are afraid the proprietors might object, and would be turning us
out of the room. The reader must visit them himself, for unless we had
? ſº that had the gift of colours, like MR. GRIEVE's brush, it would be
O
y attempting to describe pictures that, when seen, speak for
themselves so much more eloquently than words.
We have reached Calcutta;-and by the noise and shuffling are
reminded that we have never left London. It is most curious on coming
out into Regent Street to find that the porters and cabmen are not black,
and that persons are riding on horses instead of camels. We call for
our palankeen, and we sigh when the film falls from our eyes, as a
Hansom is brought to the door. We rush back to the “City of Palaces”
—but, alas! the Exhibition is closed 1 It doubles up one's heart as flat
as a Gibus hat, to be compelled to stop in this ugly mews-yard of a
metropolis, after the beautiful cities we have just feasted our eyes upon.
ENTERTAINMENTS ON THE QUEEN'S BIRTH-DAY.
THE usual list has appeared of entertainments given by the heads of
Departments in celebration of HER MAJESTY's Birth-Day, but there
were some omissions, a few of which we have the happiness of supplying.
The Beadle of the Opera Arcade entertained a select circle of Metro-
º Beadles-with a comic song—at his official residence, the watch-
ox, in the rear of Her Majesty's Theatre.
The Gate Keeper at Kensington Gardens, entertained a small party of
nursery maids and children with the exhibition of his Waterloo Medal,
and recited some anecdotes of his exploits under—or, rather, by the
side of the DUKE of WELLINGTON.
º Punch entertained the whole world at his weekly banquet, as
usual.
MR. DUNUP entertained himself by reading various letters from his
tradesmen, but did not see his way to the funds necessary for enter- |
taining the idea of immediately paying them.
A Quick Passage.
A stout, gentleman on Tuesday last entered the Lowther Arcade
from the Strand, at 10 minutes to 1, and succeeded in reaching the
opposite end precisely at 25 minutes to 3. This is considered a very
quick transit, as the Middle Passage, at all times a very narrow one,
is at this time of the year, all but closed up. A chimney-sweep gains
a good livelihood, we are told, by stationing himself at either end of
the Arcade, and offering for a ..f.g. to escort gentlemen, who
are in a hurry, through that dreadfuſ pass. He effects a thoroughfare
in something less than half an hour.
ThE BOTANY BAY FOR ARTISTs.
AN Artist, of some repute, is so discontented with the position of his
pictures in this year's Exhibition, that he has written a long letter of
remonstrance upon the subject to the Hanging Committee...The answer
he has received is to the following terrible, effect: “MR. — had
i. * care, or his pictures, next year, will be hung in the Octagon
In

A LEAPING BARONET.
HE papers have recently
º contained an account of an
extraordinary feat performed
- by a certain SIR
Y—, who has just accom-
plished the task of running
a mile and leaping over a
hundred hurdles, 3 feet 6 in-
ches high, in 18 minutes and
30 seconds. The notes and
queries of David Copperfield's
confidante, Jugo Mills, might
be very applicable to this
case; and we are inclined
to ask, with J. M.–"1st,
Why run a mile P 2d, Why
over hurdles º And, 3d,
Why in 18 minutes 30 se-
conds P’”
The puzzle appears still
greater when we find that
SIR though he
cleverly performed the feat,
was “neither in health nor
spirits.” We might form
some faint idea of the motive that would induce an individual in the
exuberance of robust vigour, and in, the whirl of unusual gaiety, to go
bounding along over a lot of hurdles, and run a mile within a brief
space of time; but when we find the voluntary athlete was actually in-
disposed in body, and depressed in feeling, we are positively thunder:
struck at the recital of his needless achievement. Fancy an invalid
hopping, skipping, and jumping in the manner adopted by the worthy
Baronet, and only conceive a man in low spirits going through a series
of antics, impressed with all the rampant fun of the most extravagant
pantomime. -
It is very evident that we must not, in future, judge from appearances,
and regard athletic sports as an indication of bodily and mental vigour
on the part of those who indulge in them. If we should happen to see
a man tumbling head over heels, or requesting a back at leap-frog of a
passing stranger, we may infer that his health is undermined, or that
his spirits are suffering from depression.
THE EARLY DRIVING ASSOCIATION.
“You often pulls us up—and we often desarves it. Will you
give us a hand, now, to help us a for’ard a bit P -
“I see lots of Sociations for Early Closing, but not vun for Early
Driving. Now I’m a poor’bus-man, and I sits on my perch sometimes
till I’m ready to drop off it. I don’t know how long a hen may sit at
a stretch, but fourteen hours a day would try its patience, I think, a
few. Why, the poor tailors, who was put by the Day at Aljeers to
hatch eggs, was never condemned in their worst sittings to so many
hours as that, and I often thinks that the old pictur of Patience a sit-
ting on a Monyment a-grinning at Grief must have meant a 'Bus
Driver a looking down on his 'osses. In all weather, too, weather
broiling hot, or as cold as the Artache Regions, it is all the same, we
must go through it. Talk of Cruelty to Animals! vy, none of my
hanimals goes more nor vun stage a day, but we goes all stages, and
I’m afraid the last ’un will be a galloping consumption. I often thinks
I’m on the highroad to it, as I drives by the Colledge at Chelsea.
We're much 'arder driven than any animal—and for this reason no
Hanimal would stand it.
“Fourteen hours, a day, Sir, and sometimes 2 more upon the 'top
of that, as I’m a living—or, to speak correkly, as I’m a dying man.
No slave has greater right to complain of the horrors of the middle
passage than I have, a-going backards and for’ards, six and eight times a
day thro Chairing X. How I sits on my box from eight in the morning
till ten—sometimes eleven, and not unfreakently twelve at night, Icant
tell, and this goes on running for weaks and weaks together. What
slave, unless he’d been borne a Englishman, could endure it? Yet,
Sir, the Publick—that monster with many 1000 heads, but not an
atom of brains—expects us always to be as smiling and as sweet-
tempered as a pastry-cook's Miss; and cries out loudly, like a man that
has corns with summun treading on 'em, if we stumbles a bit, or
commits the smallest forepaw. It little thinks that we may have been
up there soaking eight consekutive hours in the pouring reins.
“Pray, Sir, start this Early Driving Association, and ['ll give you
a lift whenever you wants one in my way—which is, “All the way from
Putney to the Bank, for Sixpence.” Recollect. Factory Labour is
restrikted to ten hours. I asks no more for the

THE WOFLE NEW BALLAD OF JANE RONEY AND
MARY BROWN.
AN igstrawnary tail I will tell yer this week—
I stood in the Court of A'Beckett the Beak,
Were MRs. JANE RONEY, a widow, I see,
Who charged MARY BRowN with a robbin of she.
This MARY was pore and in misery once,
And she came to MRs. RoNEY it’s more than twelve monce.
She adn’t got no bed, nor no dinner nor no tea,
And kind MRs. RoNEY gave MARY all three.
MRs. RoNEY kep MARY for ever so many weeks,
(Her conduct surprized the best of all Beax,)
She kep her for nothink, as kind as could be,
Never thinkin that this MARY was a traitor to she.
“MRs. RoNEY, O MRs. RoNEY, I feel very ill;
Will you jest step to the Doctor's for to fetch me a º ? "
“That I will, my pore MARy,” MRs. RoNEY says she;
And she goes off to the Doctor's as quickly as may be.
No sooner on this message MRs. RoNEY was sped,
Than hup gits vicked MARY, and jumps out a bed;
She hopens all the trunks without never a key—
She bustes all the boxes, and with them makes free.
MRs. RoNEY's best linning gownds, petticoats, and close
Her children's little coats and things, her boots, and her hose,
She packed them, and she stole 'em, and away with them did flee.
MRs. RoNEY’s situation—you may think vat it would be!
Of MARY, ungrateful, who had served her this way
MRS. RoNEY heard nothink for a long year and a day.
Till last Thursday, in Lambeth, ven whom should she see?
But this MARY, as had acted so ungrateful to she.
She was leaning on the helbo of a worthy young man; ,
They were going to be married, and were walkin hand in hand;
And the Church bells was a ringing for Mary and he,
And the parson was ready, and a waitin for his fee.
When up comes MRs. RoNEY, and faces MARY BRown,
Who trembles, and castes her eyes upon the ground.
She calls a jolly pleaseman, it happens to be me;
I charge this young woman, Mr. Pleaseman, says she.
MRs. RoNEY, o, MRs. RoNEY, o, do let me go,
I acted most ungrateful I own, and I know,
But the marriage bell is a ringin, and the ring you may see,
And this young man is a-waitin, says MARY, says she.
I dont care three fardens for the parson and clark,
And the bell may keep ringin from noon day to dark. .
MARY BRowN, MARY BRowN, }. must come along with me,
And I think this young man is lucky to be free.
So, in spite of the tears which bejew’d MARY's cheek,
I took that young gurl to A'BECKETT the Beak;
That exlent Justice demanded her plea-
But never a sullable said MARY said she. |
On account of her conduck so base and so vile,
That wicked young gurl is committed for trile,
And if she’s transpawted º the salt sea,
It’s a proper reward for such willians as she.
Now you young gurls of Southwark for MARY who weep,
From pickin and stealin your ands you must keep,
Or it may be my dooty, as it was Thursday week,
To pull you all hup to A'BECKETT the Beak.
A Cathedral Gift.
It has been proposed to put railing round the top of the Duke of
York's Pillar. We should not be at all astonished if the Dean and
Chapter of one of our richest cathedrals did not seize this opportunity
of presenting the pillar in question with a few of the railings which at
present disfigure the handsome edifice intrusted to their charge, which
charge, by the bye, cannot be very great, for on inquiring at the door of
the said Cathedral, we were told, “the charge was only twopence.”

THE MISSING DIPLOMATISTs.
DIPLOMATIC dinners have frequently an importance beyond the
uality of the yiands of the cookery; and the dinners given by Her
Majesty's Ministers in honour of the QUEEN’s birth-day, are sometimes
full of significance. On such an occasion, LoRD PALMERston's table-
cloth may mean “more, much more than it unfolds;” and though we
may not always take a leaf out of his Lordship's book, we may learn a
great deal sometimes from a leaf out of his dinner-table.
The fact of the representatives of three powers having been absent
from the recent banquet of the Foreign Secretary, has been much com-
mented upon; and some of the habitual enemies of LoRD PAIMERSton
declare that his policy will eventually leave him no one but his Excellency
DUKE HUMPHREY, the representative of Hung’ry, to dine with on
official occasions.
We do not wonder at the desire that has been shown to establish
new diplomatic relations, if only for the purpose of getting up a
respectable show of#. at Lord PALMERSton's diplomatic dinners;
and we can even understand an anxiety that the Court of Pekin should
send a representative, so that in default of a banquet on a grand scale, a
chop with China might now and then be j upon. We presume
that a band is in attendance when the Foreign Secretary has the
diplomatic corps to dine with him; but if his guests continue to fall
away one by one, some wag will suggest that the melody of “Nobody
- - GRANDE,
Rev. Ew
—- –––––-
ºn the house with Diner,” should immediately be practised by the
musicians in attendance at the dinners of Lord PALMERston. The
spread of disaffection among foreign powers, will act, most unpleasantly
on his spreads; and to show the state of our relations with other
Fº no official returns will be more convincing than his Lordship's
tables. -
Foreseeing the effect of the absence of the Russian, Bavarian, and
French Ambassadors on the public mind, an effort was made to weaken
the force of a portion of the facts by a paragraph planting the measles
in the family of the first of these accomplished noblemen. This might
do very well, had the party been a juvenile one, but surely LORD
PALMerston is old enough to be above all fear of taking the measles,
and it is very unlikely that he would be alarmed at such an infantine
complaint; so that there must have been some other cause of dread, if
he really had any apprehension of “catching it.” from the Russian
Ambassador. We wonder the Court Newsman did not tell us that the
Bavaian Ambassador's baby had got the whooping cough, a story that
might have had some approach to probability, for we suspect that some-
thing in the shape of a whoop, which may turn into a war whoop, is in
reality the malady to be apprehended. e shall be told next, that the
representative of the Gallie Cock was absent in consequence of incipient
chicken pock, when, in fact, if there, has been, any malady in the
case, it is a sort of nettle-rash which has broken out among the
A." of those Powers whom the rashness of our Foreign policy
as nettled.

A BIT OF MY MI N D.
BIT THE SIXTH.
MRs. MOUSER CONSULTS THE “TIMEs” FOR A SERVANT.
IF there’s anything that shows what a Paradise of a place England is
—where Liberty, as they call it, doesn’t wear a red cap like a butcher,
but a beadle's cocked hat like a general—what a country, it is,
swimming in milk, and oil, and honey—if anything shows, it, it isn't
the riches in the Bank, but the gold upon liveries; it isn’t the noble
houses of England—but her tall footmen. As I said to MoUSER the
other day, “If you wish to know what real independence is, just take
up the Times, and drop your eye upon “WANT PLACEs. After runnin
'em through, it does seem to me that there’s no such thing as a rea
servant to be had ; all of 'em, wanting to be hired, seem nothing less
than gentlefolks that, for a time, go out to service for penance; just as,
in Popish countries, noblemen are known to wear sackcloth under their
fine linen, and ladies, instead of pearl-powder, sprinkle themselves with
coal-ashes.” “My dear.” said MouseR, “ all that is the growth—the
º: growth, if you will—of our free institutions. Why shouldn't
JACK be as good as his master?”, “Just as you º said I,
“but I do think it a little too much that, MoI Ly should be better than
her mistress. I will say it, MouseR—when I think of the poor souls,
who stitch away their very heart strings in shirts and shoe-bindings for
little more than bread-and-water, I do want patience when I see footmen
and plain cooks in the newspapers turning up their noses at the fat of
the land; and putting themselves upon choosing their places with as
much ado as a bride chooses her wedding satin.”
The fact is, we want a man and a maid. Susan NAH-having, in a
moment of woman’s weakness, shown, her Savings’, Bank book to the
policeman—has given us warning. I’ve told her what it will come to
HI’ve writ to Exeter Hall, to her uncle, the Beadle—but I believe
MouseR when he says the girl will go headlong to the altar, When a
woman’s once blinded by a church in her eye, nothing but the church
itself will make her see things as they are. So—I’m sorry for it; for
the stoves will never be what they were again—but I give up
SUsANNAH.
... Well, for the last week I’ve sat over the Times every morning; and
if it doesn't put me into a fever for the rest of the day to read the
impudence of people’s “Wants,” I’m a marble stone, and not a flesh-
and-blood woman. Just think of this;–not that we want a Boy. I’d
as soon have a wild zebra in my house.
A Boy, age 16, under a Butler. A good character.
country. Direct to -
Now, I want to know, if there could be more brass in this Boy's
buttons—stick 'em on him as thick as you will—than there’s brass in
these few syllables? Here’s A Boy beginning life in the pantry to end
in twenty stone, as MoUSER says, as landlord of the Duck, or Flying
Elephant-here’s a chap in training for a stomach and a red nose to
match—both of 'em to be manufactured out of the fattest and the best
- and he’s “no objection” to begin to make 'em in the country.
He'll give up * Street—he'll turn his back upon Pall Mall—he
won't do more than think of Piccadilly ; and with this alarming
sacrifice of his feelings—age 16—he has “no objection” to go among the
lilacs, and lie on his back in clover-fields, and hay-cºcks!, Talk o
Ragged, Schools for wretched, houseless little boys, in dirt and tatters,
I should only like to see a from Flesh School for young tigers in
broadcloth and metal, buttons. It would be a nice study, as I said to
MoUseB, to watch this Boy through five meals a day for twenty years,
and see what a whitlow he’ll be at the end. “No objection to the
country !” Well, I’m sure; and to think of the thousands of little
wretches who are made to have “no objection” to the gutter!
We don't want a Valet—MouseR puts on his own boots. But the
man we want must be used to horses. Well, my eye fell upon this:–
As Ghoom, or Groom and Walet, a single man, age 26, who understands the
management of hunters well. Would drive a pair occasionally.
As yet, we haven't come up to a pair—but we have a pole, and
can do it when society calls for it. Now, what a pucker a house would
be in with such a groom ' I should like to know what he’d call—occa-
sionally? Going to the Bank on Dividend Days—or once to Epsom-
or to two Flower Shows—or three May Meetings? To be sure, he
doesn't object—at least he doesn't say so—to go out at any time with
one horse; it’s the couple he boggles at. f suppose it’s the two
horses that make the wear and tear of a groom’s mind, and to be paid
for accordingly. Sill, to have an “Qccasionally” sleeping in the attic,
and ſeeding in the kitchen, is, as I tell MoUSER, a responsibility I can't
put up with.. “Occasionally!”. Well, arn’t the 'bus men to be pitied,
who, let it shine or rain, must drive a pair continually?
. But here's something that's humble, and makes amends for others'
impudence:-
As Coachman, a steady, sober, single man, age 30. Six years' good character.
No objection to drive a brougham.
No objection to the
WOL, XVIII.
#|about his forehead,
7.
“Poor fellow !” said MoUSER; “no doubt of it, he’s never before
driven less than six-in-hand, and now, humility, or trouble, or philosophy,
or a proper view of the world’s vanities has taught this coachman to
have—“no objection’ to drive a brougham.” “I suppose,” said I, “we
shall next have chambermaids with “no objection’ to make a bed l’”
I thought we'd lighted upon the very thing below, but as I went
reading on, I was stopped dead—for we do have our share of company.
S Coach MAN and GRoom, a respectable, steady, sober man, age 25. No
objection to wait at table occasionally.
“Only suppose,” said I to MouseR, “that the HoRNBLow ERs and
MACAws, and HALIFAxEs were with us three Sundays running—as it
does happen—and when we’re expecting the man at the table, were to
be told he shouldn't wait, for he didn’t think three Sundays ‘occa-
sionally l’.” “The only way, my dear,” said MoUSER, “to make sure
of attendance would be first to send for the man, and observe very
politely, “My good man, will you give us your definition of occasional
company ? Does it apply to two or three days in the week, or merely
to Šišim. Easter, family birth-days, with here and there the
marriage of a son and daughter?’” “Don’t laugh, MoUSER,” said I,
“for I’ve no patience with it. No objection to wait occasionally at
table, with the thousands and thousands of poor souls, tailors, shoe-
makers, and what not, who have notable whatever to wait upon l’”
We don’t keep a cow, but if we did, she might be milked by the
young man underneath –
As GARDENER, a young man, who understands the kitchen and flower garden.
No objection to look after a cow.
“Would he really have “no objection’ to his bread well-buttered?”
said I to MoUSER. “He might, my dear,” said MoUSER. “Perhaps
the young man would prefer orange marmalade or Highland honey.”
hen I came to what’s below, I flung the paper down, for I
wouldn't trust my temper any further.
Aš Plain Cook, in a small family, a respectable person, age 30. No objec-
tion to a tradesman's family,
“What do you call that, MouseRP” said I. “Why, I call that the
democracy of kitchen stuff... When we consider what a yery, dirty
thing trade is—what a dreadful degrading sight is the London Docks
—what miserable creatures are the bankers and merchants of Loudon
—what a hovel is the Coal Exchange—and what a masty show the
Thames Pool with its thousand masts — I do think, that the Plain
Cook preaches, from the bars, a very fine lesson of humility to the
nobility, clergy, and gentry of the land. Who, after this, should
turn up his nose at commerce—who should refuse to take pot-luck
even in a back-parlour, when a Plain Cook, aged 30, has “no objection’
to roast a sirloin and make a dumpling for a tradesman's family: *
“Take the paper, MousBR; I won't look at another line.” -
“Stop,” said MouseR, “here's something that comes, yery beauti-
fully after Footboys, and Grooms, and Gardeners, and Plain Cooks,
with “no objections.’ Hear this.” And MoUSER read:-
WAN.P. a Daily Teachen, thoroughly experienced in the Pestalozzian
system, to devote three or four hours daily to a little boy, aged four years, living
near Bryanstone Square. As only English is required, and the engagement will con-
tinue for years, more than two guineas a quarter cannot be given. Address, to P. D.,
at Mr. Kennedy's, bookseller and stationer, 9, Upper Berkeley Street, Portman Square.
“Two guineas a quarter!” said I. - - - .
“Two guineas,” said MouseR, biting his lips, and a cloud growing
“Two guineas, for four hours a day: this makes
eight guineas a year, So, if the Daily Teacher, º: in the
Pestalozzian system, is lucky enough to get three such little boys as the
boy of P. D., -he, the philosopher and teacher, will, for twelve hours'
daily teaching, amass the sum of twenty-four guineas § annum.”
“Twenty-four guineas a year for twelve hours a day ! And on the
Pestalozzian system? Why, MoUSER,” said I, “what system's that?”
“Why, my dear,” said MouseR, “according to P. D., it must be a
system upon which the experienced teacher—just as the coachman has
“no objection’ to a brougham—the butler's boy ‘no objection’ to the
country—and the gardener, “no objection to a cow—a system upon
which the schoolmaster has “no objection’ to perish.” -
Who’d think that butler's boys and coachmen were so particular, and
the schoolmaster made so cheap *
The Honeysuckles.
Yours, Mr. Punch, to continue,
AMELLA MoUSER.
A Fearful Pass.
THE bills of the Colosseum advertise the “Fearful Pass of the Tête
Noire, with its Awful Cataract,” &c. &c. We wonder, if this alludes to
the crossing leading from Cheapside into St. Paul's Churchyard, which
is defended by a Lascar, for that is the most “fearful pass of a Tèſe
Noire” that a lady can have to go through. He levies black.mail, in
the most barefaced manner, and if tribute is not instantly paid to his
impudence, then there comes down such an “awful cataract” of abuse,
that we pity the poor head it falls upon. By the bye, he would make
an i`iº, doorkeeper for St. Paul's Cathedral. He is just the bold
man to collect the twopences !

MR. BRIGGS PUTS HIS HORSE IN HARNESS, AND DRIVES A FEW FRIENDS QUIETLY DOWN
TO THE DERBY.
INTERESTING ORIGIN OF “THE FUN OF THE FAIR”
EveRy one knows that “The Fun of the Fair” is a little instrument
made of wood, which, being rubbed up and down a person's coat, some
hundred times in the course of the day, is admirably adapted for tearing
it. This “Fun of the Fair” is said to have been the invention of an
advertising tailor, who, finding business rather slack, and that gentlemen's
coats, notwithstanding the bad cloth, and the poor workmanship, and
every other advantage which the cheap, starving system could possibly
give them, did not go off half quick enough, hit upon the ingenious idea
of the above, instrument for tearing them off. His ingenuity was
quickly rewarded, ſor he amassed a considerable fortune in a very short
space of time, and, died “universally respected.” His agents used to
sell the “Fun of the Fair” with one hand, and distribute his handbills
with the other. The game, has been kept alive ever since, for it has
been found by the cheap tailors such a profitable combination of pleasure
and business, that Moses has been heard to say that “If Greenwich
| i only, came once a week, he should be able in time to sell coats for
nothing.’

PRESENTS FOR THE PASHA.
A SMALL domestic menagerie—a sort of Happy Family on an
extended scale-has been sent out by the Indus to Alexandria, as a
present for the Pasha. The collection comprised four swans and five
dogs, a barn-door capon, and a prize ox, whose history, consisting of a
cock and bull story, has been given by some of the newspapers. Water
being the proper element of the swans, we suppose they will be
attached, with ropes round, their necks, to the stern of the ship, for
they will never get on at all if they do not º on swimmingly.
Among the canine specimens are a couple of bulldogs, with counte-
mances so ugly, that they are said to have terrified all beholders, many of
whom quitted the bark at the first growl of the unsightly animals.
We hope the Pasha will not think it necessary to send over here a collec.
tion of brutes in exchange; for our Zoolo ºGardens are getting rather
overstocked, and the presents forwarded consist generally of such
savage monsters, that we almost feel ourselves turning into sandwiches
while they look at us.
PROTECTION FOR MR. MERRYMAN.
To our laborious punsters of the humbler class, whose overlaxed in-
vention finds production daily more and more difficult, even the Traitor
of Tamworth must feel in his secret heart that some protection must
be afforded, if they are to compete with the foreign joker—for such a
joker is . facetious fi. whose jokes are alien from his sub-
ject and employment. The industrious Clown in MR; BATTY's Ring is
not to be abandoned to rivalry with advocates in the Bankruptcy Court.
The Times of May 21 published no less than three jokes of the most
killing nature which had been made at that tribunal the day before. By
this time, perhaps, they may be considered to have become rather
stale; therefore we are not afraid of injuring MR. MERRYMAN
additionally by transcribing them. MR. Cooke, who appeared on
behalf of poor MR. DELAFIELD, observed, that
“The bankrupt's solicitor complained that the other solicitor had called him a MR-
PIRE. (A laugh.
“MR. LAwhaxce. Then it was not war to the knife, but war to the pike? (Laughter.)
“MR. CookE feared the poor client was the gudgeon. (Great Laughter.)"
As long as a profligate Whig Cabinet and an unprincipled House of
ommons permit, the system of free admission to Courts of Justic-,
and especially to the Bankruptcy Court, to continue, it is utterly im-
possible that the British Circus should maintain a competition with
those lively institutions.
A Joke's a Joke for a' That.
It is all very well to say a joke's a joke, but the public would find
a joke to be no joke, if, like ourselves, they received at least one
hundred copies of the same joke by every delivery from the post-
9ffice. We have lately been inundated, with the old jokes about
Greece, and Grease to such a fearſul extent, that we have serious
thoughts of applying for an Act of Parliament to place jokes
about Greece among the deleterious substances that it is unlawful
to transmit through the post-office. The chief objection to the measure
would be, that the Bill must set out the joke itself, and Parliament
would never consent to read a second and third time that with which
we have been already nauseated.

PUNCH*S NOTES AND QUERIES FOR THE DERBY.

the potency of the drinks, or the weakness of the post-boyish intellect,
we cannot precisely determine—but we never recollect seeing a post-boy!"

to twirl themselves round the horse's belly; and generally the older the
postboy the stronger did this inclination manifest itself.
. How many will a Derby carriage hold? . -

the usual number is four inside and two out, with the servant. If
coming back, every avail-
able space (as the re-
porters say) is occupied.

“cannot, for the life of
them, find their drag,”
—that is to say, have

way, and have no wish
to return by it—and the
pit of the carriage is
Yº... crammed to that extent,
that, to use the theatri-
cal term, there is “not
- even standing room.” It
is well known that a Derby carriage has all the elastic properties of
a carpet-bag, and will take in any number; but still, to be respectable,
no unlicensed vehicle should carry more than a horse-killer or an
omnibus. -
Query. Is a white hat the thing to go to the Derby inº
Note. As we never could understand what “the thing” was, we
must hold this query over for future arbitration.
Query. Is it justifiable to put a turnpike-man out of temper?
... Note. As a turnpike-man never is out of temper on the Derby Day,
it would be the height of absurdity making any note on such a pre-
posterous Query as the above.
Query. What is Chaff º'
Note. A kind of dry stuff you pick up in great quantities along the
road, mixed here and there with a few grains of wit.
Query. Does it hurt? and was it ever known to kill any one?
Note. It stings, and hits, rather hard, but a person must be soft
indeed, for it to make any impression upon him. It is only another
kind of dust flying about, but more easily laid. A glass of Sherry will
lay the Chaff directly. We never heard of an instance of its terminating
in the death of an individual.
Query. If a gentleman is absent from home on the Derby Day, is it
fair to suppose that he has gone to the Races?
Note. We think it most unfair to jump to any such conclusion. We
know an instance of a gentleman, whosewife's relations are all Quakers,
who left home early on that same morning, ordering dinner precisely at
a quarter to six. By some accident he did not reach home till ten
o'clock at night, and, because his clothes were a little dusty, he was
instantly accused of having been to the Derby. Yet his statement
was perfectly clear. “He had been to the Docks with a friend who
wanted his opinion, upon some Port he had been offered a bargain,”
and , he repeated this with all, the gravity of an innocent man.
But his protestations were ridiculed, laughed at, and indignantly pooh-
º: and his wife, to this present hour, believes he was at the
erby—and nothing will convince her to the contrary. We know many
such instances, all ...; the female liability to false conclusions,
but we think one is enough.

PUNCH AMONG THE PICTURES.
FLIGHT THE SECOND.
or MR. Jones in and out of the Erhibition.
HRISTOPHER Jones is a highly respectable and
perfectly, common-place man. He sits, ha-
- #. in a square, snug room, with a Brussels
carpet, mahogany furniture, oblong windows,
with the usual sashes, and a prospect (MR.
Jones lives in London) of a common-place row
of houses opposite his own, or, it may be, if
MR. Jones be so fortunate, a glimpse of the
green in a square garden. hen MR. Jones
} sits at a table, he generally puts his legs
under it. -
But MR. Jones comes, to have his portrait
painted. How it was brought about is no
matter. MRs. Jones wished it, and her friend
MRs. SMITH had insisted on SMITH having his portrait painted, by such
a clever man, and so cheap! -- - -- -
MR. Jones's portrait is in the Exhibition., Being a full-length, it is
well hung. It represents MR. Jones in his best suit, with a very stiff
white neckerchief, which MR. Jones never wears, except when he
cannot avoid it, as at funerals, for it makes him feel what he calls
“choky,” and he is plethoric of habit. The individual thus dressed is
seated in a spacious apartment, one, indeed, of palatial dimensions.
The furniture consists of a massive pillar, and a heavy red or green
curtain, partly swathed round, partly falling gracefully from the shaft,
together with a very massive red morocco or crimson velvet chair, and
the corner of a table, on which stands the massive inkstand presented
to MR. Jones by the United Club of Benevolent Brothers (of which
MR. Jones has been twenty years secretary).
The apartment receives air from a square aperture, without a sash,
| through which is seen a wild and daring landscape, with the grey trunk
of a tree, a lick of brown hills, and a splash of blue sky. MR. Jones is
seated in the imposing attitude usually assumed by heavy fathers and
stately noblemen in legitimate comedies, with his legs not under the
table, and very elaborately blacked boots.
The features are the features of MR. Jones. There is his common-
lace forehead—ditto eyes—ditto nose and ditto mouth. This might
e better painted. . There is no occasion for a light from the to
throwing a strong shadow under Jones's honest nose, and even of suc
light as there is, the effect might be more honestly and successfully
given. However, let that pass. The face is an average portraiture, let
us suppose.
But for the rest of the picture!, What is a portrait? The repre-
sentation of a man, you will say,+but that means the representation
not of a man's head, even if you succeed in that, for that is only part of
a man—and a º can give it you better than a REMBRANDT.
But let us stop here. If Jones's portrait be the representation of
Jones, this is not Jones's portrait—for reasons, Jones never sat in
such a room; Jon Es never sat in such an attitude; Jones would
be most wretched under the circumstances in which he is here painted.
But, we must further remind you that a portrait should be a picture
as well as a representation of a man. It is a representation of a man
according to rules of art.
Now look round the Exhibition, and do not wonder that portrait-
º as practised is considered a low branch of art | But should it
e So? . A low branch of art? That branch, which, if mastered, com-
prehends the setting out on canvas of the personality of an individual
man—even though it be a Jones, and common-p exceedingly.
REMBRANDT painted the Joneses of his day; and a Dutch Jones
was, in nine cases out of ten, no better for the painter's purposes than
an English one, RAPHAEL and Giorgio NE painted Roman and
Venetian Jon ESEs. True, they had nobler matter then to work upon.
But what, after all, is the difference between their work and ...}
. They painted living human heads with characters and individualities
in them. One doesn't think of the tie and the boots, and the curtain,
and the inkstand, and the chair, in looking at their pictures.
And yet all these, truthfully and feelingly dealt with, might be made
to help out to completion the notion of a Jones. Everything about
ºvery Jones, in his ordinary life, has got an impress of himself upon it.
Çach him over his ledger; catch him at the annual rejoicing of the
Benevolent Brothers;”. catch him in his own parlour, among his
children, or reading the Times; catch him where you will and when
you will-out of your painting-room—and you have the raw material of
a picture-full of character, of some .# or other, with accessories—
just as disposable and º if you have the eye and heart to see
and feel it, as your stock, pillar, and curtain, and i. and chair.
Now, might not portrait-painting, somehow, contrive to get out of
this region of falsehood, into the region of truth—in other words, out
9f your painting-room into Jones's parlour? Could you not contrive
to give us the man?-for every Jones is a man, and, as such, has a face
\
of his own, unlike all other Joneses, and with meanings in it, sh
and peculiar to the man. Could you not catch them? you could,
and could also subordinate them to the laws of light and shade, as they
are to be subordinated, you might do for our time what REMBRANDT
did for his—and TITIAN and GroRGIONE for theirs—and RAPHAEL, and
RUBENs, and WANDYKE for theirs—and REYNoLDs for his. You might
elevate what is low, only because it is dealt with in a low and mind-
less way, to the dignify that, belongs to all true representations of
human ºf: and, you might paint pictures that would look very
singular in the Exhibition of the Royal Academy.
THE WAY THE MONEY GOES.
IF any one wants to know how the money goes, a perusal of that |
part of the debates which is headed SUPPLY will furnish much very
striking, if not very satisfactory, information. The episode of the
Marble Arch contains some curious illustrations of the way in which
the public money may be wasted, not, perhaps, in playing at ducks
and drakes, but in a game at marbles. The country is asked to |
knuckle down to the tune of some £10,000 or £12,000 for the mere
removal of this arch, and nobody can decide where to move it to. Qne
proposition of a site is the round water in Kensington Gardens; but
whether the bottom of the water is intended, or merely the brink, we
have not been º: upon. We should suggest a contract with
some respectable dustman to remove the whole concern as rubbish,
rather than that the country should have to pay £10,000 or £12,000 in
addition to the £120,000 it has already cost us. The CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER declared, with an arch look, that the removal of
the arch would afford amusement to the public; and perhaps as far as
the juvenile part of the population is concerned, there may be some-
thing in the argument. Possibly a paviour might give the nation some-
thing for the old material; and thus the Ministry, which found the
arch of marble, might leave it of copper, by getting a few halfpence out
of it in the shape of balance, after deducting the expense of delivery.
Another portion of a recent debate on supply calls our attention to
the expence of the great quantity of fret-work about the New Houses,
and though there is not much use just now, in fretting over it, we are
... to hear that most of it is already filled up with º nests.
so that, although the money has not literally gone to the dogs, it has
gone to the birds in the most lavish manner. An Honourable. Member
complained also, that some of the new stone-work was crumbling away,
and thus the public, after having come down so liberally with the dust,
º find, the dust coming down of its own accord, and their money
will be blown away with it.
|
“Lown—There, in Front l”
WE cannot understand the strange tenacity with which the dead wall
in front of the British Museum is kept up. Two or three bricks are
knocked down every week, which certainly give the wall a picturesque,
vandyked appearance, and must render it very easy for cats to climb;
but, still, there must be some hidden reason why the wall is not knocked
down altogether. ...Two Irish bricklayers would do it easily in half a day.
No—we imagine it is maintained purposely to hide the new building,
for it is very wisely thought that the sight of a handsome edifice in
London would be too much for the public mind, if displayed all at once,
so it is considered best to accustom the public eye to it bit by bit. In
about five years' time, we may probably have a full view of the new
British Museum.

next morning.
If you cannot write yourself-or write no
better than a Chinese, or a Frenchman,—it
is better to get some one, who does write
well, to pen the letter for you. This plan has its advantages, for if the
haracter is a bad one, you hand it over to the friend who has written
the letter for you;--if it is a good one, you keep it yourself.
The profession of a GRAPHIologist is a profitable one l—so much
so, that we have been told lately of three capitalists who have left the
pill line to go into it.
The stock in trade is very simple. A quire of paper—a dozen Mag-
num-Bomums—a hundred envelopes—and a fair average quantity of that
material, of which knockers and barristers’ faces are made of.-and
you can start as a GRAPHIoLogist to-morrow. Borrow five shillings
for an advertisement, and your fortune is already in your lap!
The letters keep pouring in in such showers that the second, week
you are obliged to start a Secretary—and each week generally brings a
corresponding increase. , You must recollect every letter pays in a
shilling, and as every postman rarely delivers less than twenty letters,
#. can easily guess what the amount must be at the end of the day.
is income—his pen-and-inkome, to use an old joke—is something stu-
pendous—and, the name of a GRAPHIOLOGIST has been confided to us,
who gave his daughter, on her wedding-day, a dowry of 25,000 stamps,
and ºld upon her for life the eight o'clock delivery, A. M., of hi
practice.
This extensive correspondence is occasioned by the simple fact, that
there are many persons who write to every Graphiologist who starts
up through the advertisement-trap of a newspaper. Those persons are
hungry, conceited souls, who are never satisfied with the character they
have got, and are always nibbing their goosequills to death, in the hopes
of getting a better. Thus, no sooner does a new Professor publish the
announcement, that he is ready to grasp everybody's hand that brings
him thirteen postage-stamps inside it, than he is sure to receive appli-
cations from all those who have written to every Graphiologist who
has flourished with his pen before him. According to this, the Gra-
phiologist who comes last, will have a correspondence that will make
the returns on St. Valentine's Day look very small indeed.
It must not be imagined, however, that the GRAPHIOLOGIST is merely
a gypsy of literature, who tells characters by looking at the marks that
run through a person's hand. He is a man of immense reading, and
turns that reading to the greatest profit. He can tell at once the weak
point in a person's character, and, by flattering that point, ensures many
a letter-box full of customers.
But what has flattery to do with the truth? A great deal,-forevery-
one is pleased in receiving a good character. It requires but little
persuasion to believe we are good, but a great deal to be convinced
we are bad. Then, again, the character, when it is good, is exhibited
with pride to all the owner's friends—and this pricks them with an
envious desire to have their characters told also. This is the cheapest
advertisement the GRAPHIQLogist can have. But, supposing the cha-
racter had been filled with bitters instead of sweets, it would have been
torn ": in a rage, or locked up in some secret drawer, and not a soul
would have seen it. The well from which the GRAPHIOLOGIST draws his
truths is filled with eas sucrée.
There have been libels against the GRAPHIOLOGIST, as there have
been against every bold innovator who has attempted to raise the cha-
racter of his age. It has been falsely uttered, like a bad note, that
he keeps upon hand a large stock of characters, filled with, all the
cardinal virtues, and that, as the applications arrive, he fills them
#. with the names and addresses, and ends them off indiscriminately.
This libel is so atrocious, that, we think, it answers itself.
We have ourselves written to a Graphiologist three different letters
9n, three different days. It is true that the answers we received were
in three different handwritings, but still they were full of such flattering
truths, and redounded so honourably to our character, that we were
more convinced than ever of the libellous tendency of such rumours,
which persons cannot be too cautious in circulating.
It is as clear as silver-lake ice that the GRAPHIologist believes in a
preponderance of good over evil. If he errs, it is on the side of good-
ness. In these days of despondency, when it is too much the fashion
to hang crape round everything, it is most, refreshing to hear a voice,
carolling above us º: hundreds of hearts by the cheering notes
he scatters around . In this happy strain does the GRAPHIOLOGIST
º: .# sing, and we shall always look up to him as the gentlest

THE SONG OF THE UNDERTAKER.
To arms, to arms—unfurl the pall,
spread far and wide the * of gloom;
Awake at self-protection's call,
The goal we fight for is the tomb.
Tº. shall not baulk us of our prey-
o living victims do we crave;
The dead they dare not take away,
They shall not tear us from the grave.
From Undertakers’ dismal den,
u: º: we invite;
p rouse ye, them, my merry, merry men,
*Tis for the dead we fight.
Why should they turn our mimic woe
Into substantial grief?
Surely, if burning fears must flow,
Their progress should be brief.
If sorrow's emblem must appear,
We need no grief within;
As rich the moisture born of beer,
The tear distilled from gin.
From Undertakers' dismal den,
U. º we invite;
prouse ye, then, my merry, merry men,
'Tis for the dead we fight.
Knights of the sable plume are we,
Our º are of woe; . .
Our crest shalſ the black feather be,
The white we will not show.
Of all the perquisites we prize
Shall we be rudely shorn?
What genuine tears will dim our eyes,
When for ourselves we mourn!
From Undertakers' dismal den,
Mutes, mourners, we invite;
Up rouse ye, then, my merry, merry men,
Tis for the dead we fight.
They say that anguish only kills
en on one object fixed; .
That like our teas our mortal ills
Are wholesomer when mixed."
Grief for the dead may lose some power
If we its sphere enlarge,
By making, in affliction's hour,
A stunning funeral charge.
From Undertakers' dismal den,
Mutes, mourners, we invite;
Up rouse ye, then, my merry, merry men,
Tis for the dead we fight.
Then make an effort, one and all,
Since they our rights invade,
Ye Undertakers, great and small,
Black sheep of eyery shade;
Performers in the funeral line,
Who’ve fatten’d on the dead,
We want—and never will resign-
Their bones to make our bread.
From Undertakers' dismal den,
Mutes, mourners, we invite;
Up rouse ye, then, my merry, merry men,
*Tis for the dead we fight.

MEN OF LETTERS AT THE POST-OFFICE.
EGISLATION and LINDLEY MURRAY are often
at issue on a variety of points, and it would
seem that the Executive is equally at fault
to such an extent as to make us fear that
Government and Grammar are incompatible.
We should, however, have supposed, that, if
in one, department, more than another it
might be possible to construct a sentence
for which a charity boy would not deserve
the came, that department would be the Post-
Office, where the cultivation of letters might
reasonably be looked for. We regret to find
that the authorities at St. Martin's-le-Grand
are as bad as the worst of them in their
syntax, and we have much reason to believe
that it is only the printer's care that pre-
serves official orthography from constant
error. We invoke our old friend (EDIPus
to give us his aid in the elucidation of the
following direction issued from the Post-
Office as to the transmission of Bank Notes
in letters:—
P - * safest course will be to cut such notes in half, sending each half by two different
osts.”
This direction can only be followed º some genius such as Houp1N,
the professor of magic, who has been all his life accustomed to burning
pocket-handkerchiefs into tinder, and producing them in a perfect state,
drawing an infinite variety of liquids from one inexhaustible bottle, or N
exhibiting the same article in two different places at almost the same
moment. We should be delighted to know the secret of complying with
this requisition of the Post-Office authorities, for, if it could º: done, we
might send one half of a bank-note to two different places, and the other
half to two other places, which would enable us to kill two birds with
one stone, or, rather, pay a couple of debts with one note—if we hap-
pened to be so fortunate as to possess such a document. We strongly
recommend the CHANGELIOR or THE Excheques to put himself in
communication with the Post-9ſfice authorities, for the purpºse of
learning the art of not only making money go as far as it possibly can,
but of making it go in two directions at the same instant.
MR. ARCHER FERRAND.
At the meeting of a Society for Increasing the Price of Bread at
Doncaster last week, reported by the Morning Post, MR. FERRAND is
represented to have made the following remarkable assertion:-
“I here repeat a fact which has recently been stated to the public, and which has been
roved, that in America, 1000 slaves are daily murdered in the cultivation of cotton
º by cruelties and atrocities more horrible than ever were inflicted on dumb
At this rate, America will have little to fear from the increase of her
slave population. All that’s black will, fade from Transatlantic earth
with what MR. CARLYLE would call “some degree of brevity.” A
thousand negroes murdered, every day would be three-hundred-and-
sixty-five-thousand destroyed per annum, not to count an odd two-
*...* that would probably be killed besides in the additional
six nours.
MR. FERRAND is a good old, English enemy of Free Trade, which,
verily, he attacks with a good old English weapon. Robin Hood was
a child to him at the long bow.
“Bless their dear Eyes.”—T. P. cooke.
WHEN England is in an awkward predicament, and does not know
how to act, she is always warned that “the Eyes of Europe are upon
her.” We do not see that we should have any particular respect for
these said “Eyes of Europe,” beyond the reverence we show to every-
body’s orbits, though we must confess there is one great superiority
º enjoy over Englishmen's eyes, and that is, they pay no Window-
ax.

It is very difficult to say, for it is quite a toss-up, but more frequently
a spill, if there are any Laws at all on such a day. The only Laws we
know of as holding the reins of Government on that occasion are the
following:-
To pass every one on the road, whether you are right or left.
Cut in and out; and recollectiº is the
same asat whist—you must cutthewery lowest, if you wish to get the lead.
To exchange compliments with every, one on the road, more par:
To allow no one to pass you.

º and § gentlemen who are walking on foot with their
coats off.
To take your hat off, and kiss your hand
prettyfaces you see lining the
road, and to cheer those who
pointed compliments. ... -- - - - -- -
To stop at every pºlic house on the road, if it is only “to give the
horses five minutes!”
To shake hands with everybody, when you descend, and to be most
particular in enquiring after ..". stranger's health. - -
To ask the bar-maid in the blandest manner, if she is quite well?
and “if she’ll take anything neat?—a French cap, for instance, or a lage
bonnet, or a pair of diamon º —you're not particular which.'
To assure the ostler that you will “remember” him as long as you
live—and longer, if he particularly wishes.it.
To evince the highest disdain for broken panels, and not to have
the slightest regard for your horses' legs, or your postiliºns' calves,
but to command them to cut through narrow places, where there
would be scarcely room for a ginger-beer cart to creep through.
To distribute impartially to persons on the road the “knock-em-
downs” you have brought away as trophies of your exploits.on the
turf, reserving one or two of the largest º: r friend to
whom you owe along-standing grudge for similar debts incurred on
revious occasions, and, as you would be ashamed tº do anything
ehind his back, to wait till you meet him face to face, and then
*catch his eye” with the biggest. Before your friend,has recovered
the use of his eyesight, you are, of course, a good mile ahead, laughing
in the jolliest manner pºssible at the goodness of the joke. .
Before leaving the high road, to stop the most superb foreigner ºn
horseback you can select, and taking off your chapeak, to ask him in the
gravest manner, softened with a few drops of the “sweet oil” of his
ºwn continental politeness, “d’avoir labonté de se donner la pºſſe de

To stand up in your carriage, to shout, to use your arms like a wild
telegraph, and your legs like a pair of mad compasses, to talk, joke and
laugh, in the easiest, and decidedly the freest manner, with persons you
would be ashamed of being seen to exchange a single word with on any
other occasion but the Derby. -
To subside into your matural, quiet, gentlemanly, state, as soon as
you reach Kennington Gate, and for. the remainder of the journey to
sit silently in the back of your carriage, taking no heed of the vulgar
observations addressed to you by the dirty blackguards who forget their

TAO-KWANG’S DRAGON.
Upon the 14th of the First Moon, His MAJESTY TAo-Kwaxa (the Lustre of
Reason) departed upon the great journey, mounting upwards on the Dragon, to be a
guest on high.-Chinese Court Bulletin.
WITH a few curious English, it may be a matter of passing curiosity
to know something of the Dragon, which the EMPEROR OF CHINA has
so recently bestrode-taking his Throne as a mounting-post—and de-
parting from Pekin to be a guest in Heaven... We are enabled to give
the fullest particulars of the animal, as set forth by a very distinguished
Bonze in a conversation, philosophic and confidential, with an English
Post-Captain, now at Hong-Kong.
p;" And you really believe that TAo-KwaNG started upon a
ragon
Bonze. Believe! Have not the Flowery People put on garments of
white? Have not the Mandarins put away their buttons? Do they
not let their beards #. and are not their eye-brows ragged, and
their tails in a state of frenzy? Believe!
'ptain. Aye, aye ; very good. All that we can see. But the
Dragon? Are you so sure of the Dragon?
Bonze, Sure of the Dragon!. But the barbarians are blind and pig-
skinned Sure of the Dragon I
Captain. Understand me. Are you as certain of the existence of the
Dragon as of yonder peacock? Is the Dragon a real thing, or only a
Dragon drawn by the vermilion pencil?
Bonze. The barbarians are eyeless as stones. The Dragon a real
thing ! ... Does not the Dragon, at certain seasons, with open jaws
approach the moon?- Then, do we not beat, drums, and strike gongs
and frighten and appease the Dragon? This do the Bonzes. An
then the moon comes forth...bright and unbitten; with not a mark of
the Dragon's tooth in her silver face.
Captain. And is this #. Dragon of the Eclipse—the same
Dragon that has given old TAo-KwaNg a lift aloft P
Bonze. The same.
Captain...Who has seen him? Nobody but the priests?
...Nº but the Bonzes, whose trade it is to see the Dragon
-none other.
Captain. Then you can tell me, all about him. What does he
measure from the snout to the tail? Does he wear chain-armour, or
scale? Come, paint me your Dragon.
Bonze. The Dragon is as no other Dragon. A Dragon ten palm-
trees in length, ºf...; in compass. A Dragon, coloured as the rain-
bow, with precious stones, that, melt into one another. , A Dragon,
whose teeth are of onyx, whose tongue is of coral, and whose voice is
as the beating of a world of gongs. The Dragon has eyes of orange-
tawney, and on his lower lip is one long hair of mouse-colour, a hair
thick and straightforth as a bulrush.
Captain. You have seen it f -
Bonze. I am a Bonze, and so being, is it not my trade to see and
know, even to a hair, all about the Dragon? Can you turn my
“Yes” inside out into “No” P
The Post-Captain was taken aback by the confidence of the Bonze,
who continued to talk of the Dragon as of a daily friend—an old, old
acquaintance; making large profit of the knowledge. The Post-
Captain would fain have disputed the matter; but he had a touch of
philosophy (nourished, º: at Exeter Hall), and knew it was a
service of eril to meddle with the property of Bonzes, a property
vested—in Dragons.

PUNCH'S HAND-BOOK FOR INTENDING
EMIGRANTS TO THE DERBY.
C. - - ! Information which b ired l leavi
*::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ***
CHAP. I.--Why should people go to the Derby?
--
º
-
| & º
* , , º
In the first place, because everybody goes to the Derby. Another
reason is, because they like it. And a third, and very strong reason is,
because it is an excuse for a holiday. A few people go because they
have bets on the race, and certain old fogies go because they always
have gone, and “always mean to,” as they tell you with some pride.
CHAP. II.-Hints worth Consideration.
Is it worth paying £1818s. for a barouche and pair f Hadn't you
better find a seat with a ſriend who has already been green enough to
engage such a vehicle? Hadn't you better pause before you agree to
stump up for the party, and get it back from the men afterwards in
shares?, Did you ever know a case of anybody ever getting it back
under those circumstances? Consider whether it isn't the freest an
easiest way after all to toddle down in a Hansom, with a hamper be-
tween your legs f
CHAP. III.-Preparations for the Road. The Economical Passage System.
There is often a necessity for economical conveyance to the Derby.
There are various plans for effecting this. Some go in a van; but
unless your relish for warm porter, all-fours, and strong shag tobacco,
with dust, be very decided, I cannot recommend this mode, which,
however, gives opportunity for considerable social. enjoyment. If
you do go in a van, avoid one whose horses you think it probable,
from observation, will die on the road home. Persons have been known
to go down five in a Clarence cab. This is economical, but the brutality
of the practice creates a prejudice against it. The guinea drag is
objectionable from the mixed character of your companions, their pro-
pensity to indulge in chaff, and missiles of all descriptions, the great
probability that there will be a cornet-à-piston which will be played,
and the painful responsibility you will feel thrown on you, on your way
back, of keeping on the coach two intoxicated F.; gentlemen, in
no way related to you, but whom you naturally feel averse to let drop.
Of all the economical systems, the most economical, and decidedly the
most painful, is the railway. By choosing this mode you will be enabled
to combine the experience of a squeeze at the Opera pit-door, a Smith-
field cattle-ring on a Monday morning in a "ſull market,” and a prison-
van in the dog-days. You have also the terrific struggle on getting
out at Epsom, the exorbitant fare over to the course, with the peculiar
mental satisfaction which a man feels who has been deliberately done;
and, to wind up, you will have to leave the course about four, if you
wish to start by the seven o'clock train, as you may calculate upon a
three hours' conflict to get to your carriage. These considerations may
probably induce you to adopt the railroad line of conveyance.
CHAP. IV.-Preparations for the Road, continued. The Outfit.
Luncheon deserves, consideration. As for the drinkables, I will not
insult you by supposing you capable of a “ready-packed hamper,” at
36s., containing two bottles of
Port, two bottles of Sherry, two
bottles of Champagne, two
bottles of Hock, two bottles of
Chablis, and two bottles of
iſ T. Moselle. Reflect upon the
****ºn awful consequences of drinking
any considerable portion of any
~n one of those bottles, and then
º, conceive, if you can, the results
| of a mixture! . Pray see to
lillº' knives and forks, and salt.
/
- - Without these, what is the
i |k. most perfect luncheon Think
ſ of the humiliation of , eating
the most consummate lobster-
- - - salad out of a newspaper, or
drinking even real St. Peray out of a bottle-neck.
. For the eatables I say nothing. Let them be of the best quality, and
in the greatest abundance. -
In the above remarks, I allude to the considerations that should guide
you in eating your friend's luncheons, not in providing your own. As
a rule, never take any luncheon. You are certain to meet persons who
have provided more than they can possibly consume, and you will oblige
them by partaking. I have always found the object, at the Derby, to
be, to get the people to eat luncheons.
CHAP. W.-First Steps at the Derby.
As to your conduct on the road, let it be dignified, and affable. Do
not#. in return, if pelted at, and, above all, avoid that interchange of
chaff in which the
cabman is an
adept, since you
know, as well as
I do, that you
cannot do it, and
that, though you
may commence
with an air of de-
fiance, you are
sure to end in ig-
nominious failure. Hº
Against too much
freedom in your
manner of saluting the ladies' schools over the garden walls, I surely
need not warn you, but you will find the temptation strong. On
reaching the Heath, if in a intº you will have to pay a soverei
for your place on the hill. ay it ; and I would º
beg of you not to swear while doing so, but I know you wilſ.
You had better allow yourself to be brushed on alighting, as you are
º to be brushed if you will not allow it, and will have to pay all
e same.
Your first steps after getting down, and being a good deal brushed,
will probably be to a knock-'em-down, or a thimble rig, or a prick-in-
the-garter... I cannot recommend * of these amusements, but knock-
'em-downs is the most innocent of the three. It is highly improbable
that you will gain at either of the latter. It is customary, in hand
books of this description, to give estimates of the capital, that may be
taken out with advantage. I should say that the less capital you take
out in the case of the Derby Day, the better—as, whatever its amount,
you and it will be pretty certain to be taken in. -
About luncheon-time you must brace up your energies, and concen-
trate them on the delicate business of “sponging.” Do not appear eager
—and accept refreshment when offered as if you were rather conferring
than receiving a favour., Champagne you may drink about the carriages
as you please, but I would recommend you to lunch substantially, in one
and the same place. When you have once done this you are ..
for the day, and I need not, surely, enlarge on the noble and exhilarating
effects of a sense of independence.
CHAP. WI.-The Return.
Your horses will be found eventually, but you may, if you like, £. and
look for them yourself. The search will be attended with considerable
excitement, as you, are certain not to find what you are looking for.
You will also, in all probability, be kicked. - -
Do not pay anybody for helping to get your carriage out of the jam.
Parties performing this service, without previous agreements, have no
legal lien upon you, and it is a gratuitous politeness which you may feel
sensible of, but cannot properly be called upon to pay for.
Need I enlarge on the proper conduct to be pursued on the road
home. I am perfectly aware you will misconduct yourself. You are
certain to be in a state of more or less excitement; and if you avoid
the use of eggs and wine-glasses, and do not get spilt, I have every
reason to be agreeably disappointed.
A MEASURE THAT HAS PASSED THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
“Do you know that the MARQUEss of W- has his coats from
Moses?”—“No; but I can believe it, for I was told that Moses was
hanging on to the skirts of the nobility.”

walking grammars, called Heads of Houses and Proctors, has forwarded
an Address to CHANCELLOR the DUKE of WELLINGTON, in deprecation
of the projected inquest. This precious document is anything but the
cheese; however, here is a taste of it:—
“It may be well that modern founders and benefactors might, in some instances,
improve upon the ancient regulations if they were creating colleges anew of their own
bounty; but it does not follow that the former foundations and endowments, when they
are in no instance injurious to the community at large, often highly beneficial, ought
therefore to be disturbed.”
The delicate irony with which this passage commences is, in siraight-
forward language, as much as to say, “Yah! Why don’t the Ministry
found colleges themselves, and make statutes for them after their own
fashion?” However, even if they did so, according to the Oxford
Dons, they ought not to be suffered to render their foundations too
useful.” Itº, ,” as these Alphabetagammadeltarians hypothetically
put it, “be well that modern founders and benefactors might, in some
instances”—not in all—“improve #" ancient regulations.” We may
have too much of a good thing-old Port for instance. Improvement
is Oxford's example of the aphorism—not old Port.
If it “may”—not must—be well that ancient regulations should be
improved upon, but that only in some instances, and those confined to
new colleges, certainly it “does not follow that former foundations and
endowments,” which are “in no instance injurious to the community
at large, often highly beneficial, ought therefore to be disturbed.” No-
body says that it does. The question is, whether institutions in no
instance injurious to the community at large, often highly beneficial,
should not be rendered beneficial to it in every instance, and in as
high as possible a degree ?
Of course, MR. PLUMPTRE, and Messieurs Proctors and Heads of
Houses, who object so strongly to interfere with former foundations—
of course you say Masses for the souls of your founders, If not, can't
you stand a little more reformation?
Down among the Dead Mem.
WE have heard it whispered, that, in the event of the Government
Interments Bill passing into a law, the use of its machinery will be
requested of his colleagues by LoRD PALMERSTON, who is desirous of
getting the last few months buried in oblivion, BRITANNIA will in that
case be present, as chief mourner, though she will soon recover her
spirits should the funeral take place,—for in that case much of our
recent foreign policy will fall to the ground.
OMNIBUS POPULATION.
It is most difficult to ascertain the population of one of those elastic,
squeezable vehicles—it fluctuates so. For instance, we believe four to
be the extreme number an Omnibus is allowed to carry on the roof, but
we are sure, on any warm day, that, instead of four, sixteen will be
much nearer the outside.
RATHER OWER NICE.
NotwitHSTANDING, the height of civilisation indicated by the dis-
covery of the electric telegraph, we heard a lady object the other day to
receive a message by it, on the ground that any information conveyed
by means of electricity must require the use of shocking language.

MEDICAL PRECAUTIONS AGAINST MURDER.
SUPPOse a man is, indicted for the murder of his wife. Suppose it
proved in evidence that he had, for some time, previously to the act
evinced ſº irritability after dinner. That while in this state he had
once said to his wife, “There will be war between France and England,
and I’ll kill every foreigner; and before I’ve done I’ll kill you : I’ll
shoot you through the neck.” That he added the remark, that he
always felt inclined to murder her. That thereupon he made two
attempts to strangle her, endeavoured to cause her to jump out of win-
dow, and, lastly, snatched up a loaded gun to shoot her with, which he
was only prevented from doing at the time by not being able to find a
percussion cap, Suppose, moreover, the fact of his killing the victim
to have been clearly established. -
Beyond all doubt the jury would return a verdict of acquittal on the
ground of insanity. -
The circumstances above supposed are those of an actual case, which,
according to the Police Reports, came before MR. BINGHAM last week
at Marlborough Street. The wife only applied for protection from her
husband's violence: she said that
“She feared his mind was occasionally disturbed, as he appeared at times in a state
of forgetfulness.”
The issue of the application was that
“MR. BINGHAM thought that the most expedient course to take, under the peculiar
circumstances of the case, was to call on the defendant to find sureties for his peaceable
Of course MR. BINGHAM, could do no more, his hands were tied;
he was morally and legally under that restraint under which the
defendant ought to have been placed physically. Cannot a magistrate
be empowered, in a case like this, to sentence the accused to a strait

he be authorised to direct-under medical advice—a little bleeding and
blistering, with the exhibition of something sedative and antiphlogistic,
and to commit to Hanwell instead of Coldbath Fields? Many a timeous
shaving of the head would have prevented another use of the razor.
But as it is, a man must prove himself a dangerous madman by destroy-
ing somebody, before the law takes care of him. Shut the stable door,
and a fig for the thief, but unfortunately the horse is gone. -
Matrimonial Destitution at the Diggins.
According, to the latest, intelligence from California, there are
scarcely any ladies there. Amidst all the riches, therefore, of that
El Dorado, the treasure of a charming wife, it seems, would be sought
In Waln. £robably, loyely woman will never emigrate to California for
gold, so long as there is enough of the precious metal at home to make
a little hoop that will just go round the fourth finger of the left hand.
PREPARATIONs (AT AstLEY's) FOR waR.
F. M. WIDDICOMB, directly the rupture between England and
France was known, wrote in to LoRD PALMERSTON, to offer his services
to the British Government, and said he was empowered by MR, BATTY
to give £1000 for another Battle of Waterloo, with the promise of :
laying out £3000 more towards its celebration, in the event of its
turning out a successful piece.
Galling them Names.
It has been suggested by a wag, now, alas! in his dotage-a veteran
who has seen better jokes—that the most appropriate names for our
Minister at Greece and our. Foreign Minister at home would be Penny
Wyse and Palmerston Foolish-N.B. If there is any individual who
cannot or will not see any joke in this, he is requested to wink at it.
A PROFITABLE PERSUASION,
THE word Agapemone is a cross between Greek, and English.
“Agape,” in the former language, signifies love. “Mone” is evi-
dently an abbreviation of money. That the Agapemonians ought rather
to be called Agapemoneyans is clear from “BROTHER THOMAS's"
having been instructed by revelation that it would be sinful to settle
his wife's property upon herself.
A TRUTH, BUT NO JOKE-AT LEAST, A VERY SMALL ONE.
We see that there is advertised a “Free Trade Polka.” We do not
think this a very happily-chosen title, for we have been down to Kent
lately, and there the universal complaint is, that, though there is Free
Trade enough in corn, there is no Free Trade yet in Hops.
Toujours Fidèle.
HERR DREYschock, the eminent violinist, has been astonishing his
audiences by playing “God save the Queen’’ with his left, hand. How-
ever wonderful the fa, it has been objected to by a super-loyalist, on the
ground of its being after all a left-handed compliment to the sovereign.

T H E PROSE R.
ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
IV.-ON A GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG LADY.
oME time ago I had
the fortune to wit-
ness at the house of
ERMINIA’s brother
a rather pretty and
affecting scene:
whereupon, as my
custom is, I would
like to make a few
moral remarks. I
must premise that
I knew ERMINIA’s
family long before
the young lady was
born. WICTORINA
her mother, BoA
her aunt, CHIN-
CHILLA her grand-
mother - I, have
been intimate with
ºf every one of these
| ladies: and at the
table of . SABILLA,
| her married sister,
with whom ERMI-
NLA lives, have a
cover laid for me
whenever I choose
to ask for it.
Everybody who
has once seen ER-
MINIA remembers her. Fate is beneficent to a man before whose eyes at
the parks, or churches, or theatres, or public or private assemblies it
throws ERMINIA. To see her face is a personal kindness for which one
ought to be thankful to Fortune; who might have shown you CAPRELLA,
with her whiskers, or FELIssa, with her savage eyes, instead of the calm
and graceful, the tender and beautiful ERMINIA. When she comes into
the room, it is like a beautiful air of MozART breaking º you; when
she passes through a ball-room, everybody turns and asks who is that
Princess, that fairylady? Even the women, especially those who are the
most beautiful themselves, admire her. By one of those kind freaks of
favouritism which Nature takes, she has endowed this young lady with
almost every kind of perfection: has given her a charming face, a perfect
form, a pure heart, a fine perception and wit, a pretty sense of humour, 8
laugh and a voice that are as sweet as music to hear, for innocence an
tenderness ring in every accent, and a grace of movement which is a
curiosity to watch, for in every attitude of motion or repose her form
moves or settles into beauty, so that a perpetual grace accompanies her.
I have before said that I am an old fogy. On the day when I leave off
admiring, I hope I shall die. To see ERMINIA, is not to fall in love
with her: there are some women too handsome, as it were, for that:
and I would as soon think of making myself miserable because I could
not marry the moon, and, make the silver-bowed Goddess DIANA
MRs. PACIFIco, as I should think of having any personal aspirations
towards Miss ERMINIA.
Well then, it happened the other day that this almost peerless
creature, on a visit to the country, met that great poet, TIMOTHEUs,
whose habitation is not far from the country house of ERMINIA's
friend, and who, upon seeing the young lady, felt for her that admira-
tion which every man of taste experiences upon beholding her, and
which, if MRs. TIMOTHEUs had not been an exceedingly sensible
rson, would have caused a jealousy between her and the great
ard her husband. But, charming and beautiful, herself, MRs.
TIMOTHEUs can even pardon another, woman for being so; nay,
with perfect good sense, though possibly with a little factitious en-
thusiasm, she professes to share to its fullest extent the admiration of
the illustrious TIMOTHEU's for the º: beauty.
After having made himself well acquainted with ERMINIA’s per-
fections, the famous votary of APOLLO and leader of the tuneful choir,
did what might be expected from such a poet under such circumstances,
and began to sing. This is the way in which Nature has provided that
poets should express their emotions. When they see a beautiful
creature, they straightway fall to work with their ten syllables and
eight syllables, with duty rhyming to beauty, vernal to eternal, riddle
to fiddle, or what you please, and turn out to the best of their ability,
and with great pains and neatness on their own part, a º of verses
in praise of the adorable object. I, myself may have a doubt about
the genuineness of the article, produced, or of the passion which
vents itself in this way, for how can a man who to assort
d|doomed by Fate to disappear from amon
carefully his tens and eights, to make his epithets, meat and me-
lodious, to hunt here and there for rhymes, and to bite the tip of his
n, or pace the gravel walk in front of his house searching for ideas—
doubt, I say, how a man who must go through the above process
before turning out a decent set of verses, can be actuated by such strong
feelings as you and I, when, in the days of our youth, with no particular
preparation, but with our hearts fulfot manly ardour, and tender and
respectful admiration, we went to the SACCHARIssa for the time being,
and poured out our souls at her feet. That sort of eloquence comes spon.
taneously; that poetry doesn’t require rhyme-jingling and metre-sorting,
but rolls out of you you don't know how, as much, perhaps, to your
own surprise as to that of the beloved object whom you address. In
my time, I know whenever, I began to make verses about a woman, it
was when my heart was no longer very violently smitten about her, and
the verses were a sort of mental dram and artificial stimulus with
which a man worked himself up to represent enthusiasm and perform
assion. Well, well; I see what you mean; I am jealous of him.
IMOTHEUs's verses were beautiful, that’s the fact—confound him —
and I wish I could write as well, or half as well indeed, or do anything
to give ERMINIA pleasure. Like an honest man and faithful servant,
he went and made the best thing he could, and laid this offering at
Beauty's feet. What can a gentleman do more? My dear MRs.
PACIFIco here remarks that I never made her a copy of verses. Of
course not, my love. I am not a verse-making man, nor are you that
sort of object—that sort of target, I may say—at which, were I a poet,
I would choose to discharge those winged shafts of APOLLO.
When ERMINIA got the verses and read them, she laid them down,
and with one of the prettiest and most affecting emotions which I ever
saw in my life, she began to cry a little. ... The verses of course were
full of praises of her beauty. “They all tell me that,” she said;
“nobody cares for anything but that,” cried the gentle and sensitive
creature, feeling within that she had a thousand accomplishments,
attractions, charms, which her hundred thousand lovers would not see,
whilst they were admining her mere outward figure and head-piece.
I once heard of another lady, “de par le monde,” as honest Des
BoukDEILLEs says, who after looking at her plain face in the glass,
said, beautifully and pathetically, “I am sure I should have made a
; wife to any man, if he could but have got over my face l’” and
ewailing her maidenhood in this touching and artless manner, saying
that she had a heart full of love, if anybody would accept it, full of
faith and devotion, could she but find some man on whom to bestow it;
she but echoed the sentiment which I have mentioned above, and which
caused in the pride of her beauty the melancholy of the lonely and vic-
torious beauty. “We are full of love and kindness, ye men!” each
says; “of truth and purity. We don’t care about your good looks.
Could we but find the right man, the man who loved us for ourselves,
we would endow him with all the treasures of our hearts, and devote
our lives to make him happy.” I admire and reverence ERMINIA's
tears, and the simple heart-stricken plaint of the other forsaken lady.
She is JEPHTHAH's daughter condemned by no fault of her own, but
women. The other is a
queen in her splendour to whom all the Lords and Princes bow down
and pay worship. “Ah!” says she, “it is to the Queen you are kneel-
ing, all of you. I am a woman under this crown and this ermine; I
want to be loved, and not to be worshipped: and to be allowed to love
is given to everybody but me.” -
How much finer a woman's nature is than a man's (by an Ordinance
of Nature for the purpose no doubt devised), how much purer and less
sensual than ours, is in that fact so consoling to misshapen men, to
ugly men, to little men, to giants, to old men, to poor men, to men
scarred with the small-pox, or ever so ungainly or unfortunate—that
their ill-looks or mishaps don't influence women regarding them, and
that the awkwardest fellow has a chance for a prize. Whereas, when
we, brutes that we are, enter a room, we sidle up naturally towards
the pretties; woman; it is the pretty face and figure which attracº.us;
it is not virtue, or merit, or mental charms, be they ever so great. When
one reads the fairytale of Beauty and the Beast, no one is at all surprised
at Beauty's being moved by Beast's gallantry, and devotion, and true-
heartedness, and rewarding him with her own love at last. There was
hardly any need to make him alovely young Prince in a gold dress under
his horns and bearskin. Beast as he was, but goºd Beast, loyal Beast,
brave, affectionate, upright, generous, enduring, Beast, she would have
loved his ugly mug without any attraction at all. It is her nature to do
so, God bless her. It was a manmade the story, one of those two-penny-
halfpenny men-milliner moralists, who think that to, hay? a handsome
person and a title are the greatest gifts of fortune, and that a mani; not
complete unless he is a lord and has #. boots. Or it may have been
that the transformation alluded to did not actually take place, but was
only spiritual, and in Beauty's mind, and that, seeing before her
loyalty, bravery, truth, and devotion, they became in her eyes
lovely, and that she hugged her Beast, with a perfect. contentment
to the end.
When ugly WILKEs said that he was only a quarter of an hour
behind the handsomest man in England; meaning that the charms of
his conversation would make him in that time at a lady's side as

agreeable and fascinating as a beau, what a compliment he paid the whole
sex. How true it is, (not of course applicable to you, my dear reader
and lucky dog who possess both wit and the most eminent personal
attractions, but of the world in general,) We look for Beauty: women
for Love.
So, fair ERMINIA, dry your beautiful eyes and submit to your lot, and
to that adulation which all men pay you; in the midst of which court
of yours the sovereign must perforce be lonely, That solitude is a
condition of your life, my dear young lady, which many would like to
accept, nor will your dominion last much longer than my LoRD
FARN.com Brºs, let us say, at the Mansion House, whom Time, and the
inevitable November will depose. Another potentate will, ascend
his throne: the toast-master will proclaim another name than his, and
the cup will be pledged to another health. As with XERxes and all
his courtiers and army at the end of a few years, as with the flowers of
the field, as with LoRD FARN.com Be, so with ERMINIA: were I
TIMOTHEus of the tuneful quire, I might follow out this simile between
Lord Mayors and Beauties, and with smooth rhymes and quaint anti-
thesis make a verse offering to my fair young lady. But, Madam, your
faithful Pacifico is not a poet, only a proser: and it is in truth, and
not in numbers, that he admires you.
CIVILITY OF ST. PAUL'S SHOWMEN.
THE public has known for
some time how re-
markable for civility
and respectſul de-
meanour are the
Showmen and Mo-
mey-takers of the St.
Paul's Cathedral
Twopenny Exhibi-
tion. The politeness
and courtesy of these
entlemen have at
ength been taken
cognisance of by the
_ Court of Aldermen;
at a recent sitting of
E which worshipful tri-
bunal, reported in
the newspapers, MR.
* ALDERMAN Hoopera
took occasion to say
on their behalf:-
“A more impertinent
set of fellows never ap-
peared anywhere to per-
form duties of any kind.
Some of the females of
my family went to the
Cathedral on Sunday last
to hear Divine Service,
but it was in vain they
applied to the vergers for admission into the pews regularly appropriated to the
accommodation of the ladies and families of the Aldermen. One of these vulgar,
insolent fellows said, upon being remonstrated with on the subject, that he didn't care
i. the Aldermen. . . In fact, nothing could exceed the impudence of the presum-
g brutes”.
This last remark, pace ALDERMAN Hooper, is rather too strong; for
the impudence of these “presuming brutes” is certainly exceeded by that
of their employers in demanding money for the admission of the public
into a national church. “Like master like man;” and capitular rapacity,
naturally enough, is imitated by extortionate flunkeydom. MR. Hooper
proceeded to state that—
“A lady who happened to get a seat, was surprised to see the pew into which she was
admitted, almost filled with strangers, who, no doubt, paid these fellows silver for the
privilege.”
. Begging ALDERMAN Hooper's pardon, we object to calling the
sittings in St. Paul's Cathedral, pews. They are not pews, but stalls
and boxes, and you get admitted to them by means of the ordinary silver
key, hat is to say, by tipping the box-keeper. To leave their servants
to eke out their remuneration by picking up money in this scampish
kind of way would be discreditable to the management of any decent
theatre, and is in the highest degree scandalºus to that of such a House
as St. Paul's.
The subject of ALDERMAN Hooper's complaint has been referred to
the Committee of Privileges, and now that the showfolks of St. Paul's
have insulted the family of an Alderman, perhaps they will be brought
to their senses.

BANQUET to M, SCRIBE.-Certain distinguished translators of the
Dramatic Authors’ Society propose to give M. Scribe a dinner. This
is the least they can do, seeing the many dinners he has given them.
THE PRINCE'S PETITION.
Prºy the troubles of a poor young Prince,
Whose costly scheme has borne him to your door;
Who's in a fix—the matter not to mince—
Oh, help him out, and Commerce swell your store!
This empty hat my awkward case bespeaks
These blank subscription-lists explain my fear;
Days follow days, and weeks succeed to weeks,
But very few contributors appear.
Yon house, whose walls with casements tall abound,
With look of affluence drew me from the road;
But Grumbling there a residence had found,
Light was so plaguy dear at that abode.
Hard was the answer, and the cut was sore;
Here, where I hoped for good a pound a head,
A maid-of-all-work drove me from the door,
“We pays too much for Winder-Tax!” she said.
Oh, never mind your highly-rated dome!
Time hastens on: a year will soon have roll’d:"
Down with your dust, ye generous people, come,
Or else I shall be ly sold.
I'll not conceal how deep will be my grief
If liberality don't touch your breast,
And failure, for the want of kind relief,
should swamp a grand design, as mine’s confess'd.
Station brings duties: why should werepine?
Station has brought me to the scrape you see;
And your condition might have been like mine,
The child of Banter and of Raillery.
A great success I thought would be my lot,
When, for a lark, I broach'd my plan, one morn;
But ah! Taxation to such height has got,
That I’m afraid the thing will fall still-born.
The Income-Tax, that burden of the age,
Narrows the comforts of so many a home,
That people can’t afford me patronage,
And I am doom'd for charity to roam.
The tiresome duties that on knowledge bear,
Retained by Government's unwise decree,
A farthing will not let the poor man spare
To aid All Nations' Industry and me.
Pity the troubles of a poor young Prince,
Whose costly scheme has borne him to your door;
Who’s in a fix—the matter not to mince—
Oh, help him out, and Commerce swell your store!
“Eminent Services.”
THE Globe says:– Em s
“A royal sign manual warrant has just been issued granting a pension of 25l. a year
to Mrs. HARRIET Waghoºn, widow of the late Lieutenant Thomas Wagnosis, ‘in
consideration of the eminent services of her late husband.’”
There was a LIEUTENANT WAghorn who wore out his life in
achieving the noblest work, bringing England and India within a few
weeks together. It is plain, however, that this is not the WAGHoRN
whose widow is pensioned into something less than ten shillings a week.
We may be wrong, but we have a strong suspicion that the Queen's
rat-catcher was named WAGHoRN; though, as we have not heard of the
death of that functionary, we are somewhat puzzled by a pension granted
to his widow.
NAPLEs' soap.
THE KING or NAPLEs has given a place in his court to the son of
a gentleman—a correspondent for an English newspaper; the corres-
pondent having, for some months, “written up” his Majesty. And
now comes the appointment: Naples soap for Irish blarney.
Legal Wool Gathering.
LoRD John Russell took the greatest pains to prevail upon Loºn
LANGDALE to resign the permanent Mastership of the Rolls, and accept
the unstable position of Lord Chancellor. The Premier paid very high
compliments to the talent and learning of Lond LANGDALE, who drily
requested Lord JoHN to desist from flattering, inasmuch as “so long as
he, LoRD LANGDALE, enjoyed the Rolls, he cared little for the butter.”

A BIT OF MY MIN D.
BIT THE SEWENTH.
MRs. MOUSER, As ONE OF THE ENGLISH MATRONs' HOTTENTOT
socIETY, Is SHAMEFULLY DECEIVED.
PERHAPs never woman was so insulted-yes, insulted is the word;
insulted, laughed at, made a fool of, besides being wounded in her
tenderest feelings, pity and compassion for her fellow-creatures
especially the fellow-creatures that are dark and distant—never, I will
say it, was a woman ever so played upon by her husband, a person,
plain enough, that is sworn to love, honour, and protect her—(by the
way, if women had had the making of the marriage service, wouldn’t
they—as aunt PEAcock used to say—wouldn't they have put in a few
more locks and bolts on their own side P)—
Well, never was woman so played upon, as MoUSER has put upon
me! It was just three weeks ago that I went with MRs. HoRN-
BLower and her two sisters, and MRs, MACAw, and MRs. GRIFFITHS-
there were six of us, and we’d taken a fly among us, to go and pay, our
subscriptions to the Society against Cruelty to Animals—just three
weeks ago, that, coming back, we went into Exeter Hall—killing two
birds, as MouseR sneered, with one fly—to Exeter Hall, to the Annual
Meeting of our body, the Fnglish Matrons' Infant Hottentot Society.'
As MRs. CossETT observed—not that I like the woman, for I know, if
she could, she’d send her Pusey Tracts among our dear little Kaffirs,
poisoning 'em—as the REv. M.R. STIFFNECK piously preaches-
poisoning 'em in their vital source—still, as MRs. CossETT observed,
such a meeting was an earnest of Eden. I never cried with such
pleasure in all my life. For that dear M.R. STIFFNECK winds round the
feelings—as I told MouseR, who only laughed-like a convolvulus
- round a rose ! And what did he say ? What did he call us?
“Lilies of women”—said he—“women with hearts that beat on
the other side of the ocean ; with arms that, “. . across
seas, raise the little Hottentot from the dust, and dandle him into
reason. How many children have ye?” cried MR. STIFFNECK, and his
voice made me sweetly shiver like a silver trumpet –“how many
children, every woman here?”— at which, Miss Potts and MIss
WINKs did stare—“I don't mean the children, ºf: of your
own hearth! The creatures born in comfort, nestled in luxury, and
running alone in happiness-I don’t mean your own white children-
I don’t count them—I don’t think of them. Certainly not : I should
despise myself if I did. But I mean how many black children have ye?
How many offspring, born of your charity, and wet and dry nursed on
your benevolence? This, indeed, is a family to be proud of. Oh, my
sisters is it not delightful to feel that you have in the middle of Africa
a º: can’t count Is not this something to sleep upon?... You
—The English Matrons’ Infant Hottentot Society—you have sent in the
last year ten thousand books to the Hottentots. Say that one book
upraises only ten children—and the calculation is only too modest and
too moderate—that one makes only ten—why, then, my beloved women,
you have among fe one hundred thousand infants to whom you all are
nursing mothers . Think of that, sisters—let that thought accompany
ye to your hearths; let that recollecion be with you, when you look
upon your white families, the lily-skinned brothers and sisters of your
own black Hottentots. Ten hundred thousand children, my beloved
women, and share them all among ye!” There wasn’t a dry eye in
the place, except, indeed, that MRs. PRINCE who makes it a point to
cry at nobody but MR. Locust. And dear MR. STIFFNECK's discourse
went home with me, every word of it; and I did nothing but think of
my dear little black children—the little sooty darlings in the middle of
Africa, º; thousand elephants—while my own—but I won't draw
comparisons. I can’t bear it.
*isn't it beautiful?” said I to MoUser, “to be sitting here at our
own fireside, and to know that one's heart, like a dove, as MR. STIFF-
NECK says, is flying about, carrying leaves—that is, books—among the
blacks ten thousand, thousand miles away f . It’s a beautiful thing,
isn’t it, MoUSERP” And what did he answer?—But it only shows the
narrow-mindedness of the other sex in general. “Amelia,” said he,
“if you have any superfluity of maternal affection, I do think you may
find little negroes nearer home than Africa. Suppose you tried some
of the courts in Whitechapel,-made a visit to a few of the alleys in
Spitalfields. You'd find negroes there—with this difference, that the
miserable creatures are black and all black inside—with minds as dark
as Ethiops' faces!”
(But that’s so like MouseR-indeed, not to be too hard upon my
own husband, it’s like all of 'em—a woman isn't allowed, as aunt PEA-
Cock used to say, to expand her feelings upon broad humanity, the
little-minded creatures think it so much love and duty taken from them-
selves. . They’d have a woman's affections, like the fire-irons, never
budge from their own hearth—which I call poor and narrow.)
“MouseR,” said I, “you don’t know what true benevolence is.
You don't know what a soul-upraising, and heart overflowing delight it
is, as MR. STIFFNEck says”—(and then MouseR put a word upon
STIFFNECK that the ink would turn red if I was to try to put it upon
paper)—"what a glow it is to the very finger-ends of the soul, to sit
here under a Christian roof, and to know that you are pouring down
upon Africa, and China, and Mesopotamia, and the Great Desert, and
Araby Stony-pouring down books like snow; books for the blacks,
and reds, and tawnies—books for men, and women, and children, not
. blººk, as you sneer upon one—but for the benighted of all
COIOurS.
“Very beautiful, no doubt,” said MouseR, with that horrid turn of
the corner of his lip, when I know something’s coming; “very upraising,
as you call, it; sºil, I think, if you’d only laid out the same money
you’ve paid in books for the infant Hottentots and sucking Bosjesmans,
-the same money in soap, for the blacks at home, you’d have begun at
the better end. Depend upon it, AMELLA, soap is the first thing, the
º: letter A in the alphabet of all social improvement; muck won’t
e taught, and hunger—for with soap goes bread—and hunger won’t
be lectured.” Had MoUSER—though he’s my own husband—had
MoUSER been born a Hottentot, before the Matrons' Society was
established, he couldn’t have been more—but no; every woman's
husband is her own burthen, and I’ll bear mine, and say nothing.
This, however, I must make known—the shameful trick; the
unfeeling sport, and worse than Caribbean cruelty—(the words are not
mine, but MR. STIFFNECR's) that he played off, only three days ago,
upon me. I’d been looking over the Report of our Hottentot Sister-
hood, and was sitting with my eye upon the tiger in the hearth-rug,
and my thoughts were flying away among the cocoa-trees and sugar-
canes, and I was thinking to myself—whilst my heart warmed again–
what a deal of good my last two-pound ten—(and I’m sure if anybody
wants a new gown, I am that very woman)—what a deal of good my
subscription was dºing in Africa, and perhaps in Mesopotamia, when
the door ran open, and one of the sweetest little black boys ran in, and
fell upon his knees at my feet, and liſted up his hands and said, in the
most ºffecting broken English—“Buckra lady; ain’t l a little boy,
and a son?”
. I’d hardly risen from my chair, when MouseR followed the child
into the room, “There, AMELIA,” said he—“there’s a forlorn little
bit of ebony, fresh from the Bite of Benin”—some horrid monster, as I
thought—"fresh from the Bite, he’s been saved by a miracle and one
of the African squadron, and as one of the Matrons of the Hottentots,
you may dry-nurse and protect him.”
Who’d have thought that a woman's own husband would sport
with the feelings of his own wife! But let me go on.
As I looked at the poor little black—for he was as black as the very
coal in the scuttle, and his hair as woolly as a black lamb's back—as
I looked at him, I thought to myself, “Won't it be a treat and a
triumph over that MRs. CossETT to take this little burning brand to her
platform of the Hall, and examine him in the face of the world,
showing how I’ve opened his mind, ard formed his principles!
“The blessed darling,” said I, “where, MouseR—where did you
find this precious cast-away ? If I won’t have his picture taken for our
next Report, I’m not a bit better than a heathen. Where did you find
him?” “You shall know all about that, AMELIA,” said MouseR; “but
now he's here, what are you going to do with him f* “The precious
dove,” said I: “of course, examine him.” Whereupon I was going to
try him in a few questions—preliminary, as MR, STIFFNEck says, and
such as he recommends—when MouseR said, “My dear, let me advise
you to try bread first, soap afterwards, and then the schoolmistress if
you please.”
Well, just to humour MoUSER, I had up a beautiful cold chicken-
one of two that was left yesterday—a bit of broiled ham, a gooseberry
tart, and half-a-dozen custards. As the sweet little negro eat up every
bit, . only wish was, that all the Hottentot Matrons had been there to
see tilm.
“And now, he’s got his bellyfull,” said MouseR, “let me prescribe
the soap.” It was against my principles, for I wanted to rush into the
examination, but to let him have his own way, I rang the bell, and sent
the black boy into the wash-house. -
Well, he'd been gone about half an hour, and I’d been looking at
our Hottentot Tracts to open the negro mind, when the child-the
wicked little impostor-as white and as clean as a new-washed baby,
with brown hair and blue eyes, and a leer upon his saucy little face, as
if he knew he’d cheated me, and gloried in it, when a white, boy, a
real native of Whitechapel, ran in, and tumbling head-over-heels upon
the rug, began to sing, “Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me!”
“You good-for-nothing creature! What are you?” said I.
“I'm one of the Hottentot singers, and here’s my wig:” whereupon
he pulled out the curly thing, and shook it in my face.
“A miserable creature,” said MoUSER, “with no home but the gutter
—no bread but "–
“Don’t talk to me,” said I, “a little good-for-nothing white impostor,”
and with that didn't Iturn the vermin into the street? If I didn't, my
name is not
Yours, truly (ill-used),
AMELIA MoUSER.

THE PRIVILEGE OF PIC-NICS.
To the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE, Ranger of Richmond Park.
MAY IT PLEASE YoUR Royal HIGHNEss,
It is one of your many distinguishing virtues that you love a
od dinner. I have seen you many times exercising that love with a
eartiness that would put bowels into a mummy. You are, I under:
stand, to be painted as a jovial BRLAREUs for the refreshment room of
the House of Lords, with a hundred jolly faces smiling, glowing
reddening, lip-smacking, over a hundred different plates, and a hundre
hands carving the hundred delicacies of the four seasons. MACLISE is
to do the heads; and LANDSEER, the roast, pigs, ducks, geese, and all
the other animals that continually come whole to dinner. LAURIE is
en of for the fruit; and the mouths of unborn men will water at
his †. his pines, his peaches, and his melons. All this is right-
admirable; in excellent taste: worthy of the House of Lords, and
wisely commemorative of your Royal Highness's knife-and-ſork ame:
nities. No man has eaten more dinners in the cause of charity, and
until the end of your days—that is, if an end shall ever be—may gout
respectfully avoid you! May the demon never shake so much as your
little toe, and indigestion hold you in profoundest reverence | But—
But, your Royal Highness, is it possible that, as Ranger of Richmond
Park, you forbid the laying of a table-cloth on the greensward, and—by
means of †† keepers—carry consternation into the hearts of parties
ic-nic P Is this right of the Duke of CAMBRIDGE-the Duke of the
reemasons' Tavern—of the London ditto—of the Crown and Anchor
—the Thatched House—the Clarendon—the Blue Posts—the Elephant
and Castle—the Pig-and-Whistle, and all the other hostelries? (to be
duly noted by PETER CUNNINGHAM in his new Knife-and-Fork-Book of
London,)—whose rooſtrees have resounded to your laugh, whose lares
and penates have shaken their sides at your inexhaustible flow of humour
-your cataracts of wit?
Can your Royal Highness enjoy your green peas with the gusto that
you and green peas are equally worthy of, reflecting that a Richmond
Park-keeper has warned off John STUBBs, tailor, MRs. STURBs, and
children, HMRs. STUBBs having laid the cloth upon Richmond grass,
and about to lay upon that a sweet bit of cold lamb with her first goose-
berry, pie of the season? Is this wise—is it just—is it kind, your
Royal Highness? In a word, is it like the jolly, good-hearted DUKE
OF CAMBRIDGE * What! shall the champagne frizz and foam to your
royal mouth at the Freemasons', and shall not bottled porter cry “pop”
sub tegmine fagi in Richmond shades? Yet this notice, like a death's
head, stares and mockingly grins in the lengthened faces of perplexed
holiday-makers:–
Tºſ. Głº 38.
==
RICHMOND PARK.
NOTICE.
Persons riding or driving in the Park are requested to keep the line of the gravel-
roads. If riding or driving over the grass across the Park, they will be considered as
trespassers, and dealt with accordingly. If horses are taken off from carriages, the
keepers and constables have orders to impound them. No dogs admitted unless they are
led. Alldogs found hunting or straggling will be shot.
We have a respect for the English crown—especially regard the
gracious gentlewoman who adorns it, and that we have a respect,
we have in proportion a sorrow to see the crown placed as a scarecrow
to homely happiness.
And so, your Royal Highness, you will immediately think the matter
ºver, and we doubt not even ere the chestnuts, shall have dropt their
blossoms—(what a glory, what a floral illumination, while we write, is
burning in Bushy Park!)—the ugly notice frowning above will be taken
down; and in its place, the notice subjoined, with the illustrations
faithfully copied:—
| r L.
RICHMOND PAR. K.
NOTIC E.
Persons coming here, are ordered to enjoy themselves. They are
commanded, as faithful subjects, to bring with them an ample supply of
the best they can afford of meat and drink; from venison and cham-
pagne, to cold mutton and bottled porter.
Hot water, for tea parties, is to be had gratis at the Lodge from the
DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE's own tea-kettle.
GOOD HEALTH TO ALL.
N.B. Parties are earnestly requested not to leave their bones behind.
Please to pick up the corks; and—in consideration of the deer's feet
—leave no broken glass.
Wivat Regina: Good Night, and Happy Dreams.
This, may it please your Royal Highness, is the sort of notice for a
demesne, of which the jolly, DUKE or CAMBRIDGE is Ranger, and this
notice—he expects—will gladden his eyes, when Richmond Park is
next visited,
By your Humble Servant, Friend, and Councillor,
388852C#.
DRAMATIC NEWS.
THE New York Literary World publishes an astounding piece of news:
nothing less than a statement that London dramatic authors—ſhow
many authors would be left if war once broke out between the Palais
Royal and the Burlington Arcade)—intend to “hold their works,” that
is, not to print them; in order that American m ers may not play
them cost-free. What a notable device Why, before SIR BULwer
LYTTON's Act, many dramatists did not print their pieces; and what
was the result P Why, miserable garbled copies were obtained by a
go-between agent, and thus the authors were not only robbed, #!
murdered. So would it fare with authors who nominally “hold their
works” in England; being really plundered and butchered by the
American managers; most of whom, by the way, are, Englishmen; and
therefore may believe they have a patriotic right to defraud their coun-
trymen of their own.
All Up with the Reds.
THE Parisian Boulevards are to be macadamised—not so much for
the purpose of making the population mend their ways, but in order
that the general breaking-up of the large stones may prevent the
success of any future outbreak. MACADAM is the great enemy of the
barricades after all, since his invention will be the cause of a split or
general break-up of those constant friends to the Red party—the
paving-stones of the Metropolis. The spirit, or rather the unhappy
host of poor Liberty will in vain call upon the very stones to rise in
aris, as they have often risen before on former occasions. .
THE CHARITY-SCHOOL OF ART.
OUR olfactory moral sense is greatly outraged by a number of en-
gravings, to be seen in almost every print-shop window, representing
charity children, in various devotional postures. The vile odour pro-
ceeding from these works is that of sordid plagiarism, mingled
with the affectation of a sort of pious sentiment, which may be called
parochial. Some little time ago, a print was published, representing
three choristers chanting: the young gentlemen of the choir were
idealised specimens; the thing was rather pretty, and became very
popular. , Since then, Town has been over-run with engravings of
charity children, male and female, saying their prayers, and repeatin
collects and responses. Every clause in the Belief is threatened wi
being illustrated in this nauseous manner.
One idea has been successful, and, as usual, a host of imitative
speculators set to work to produce “something like it.” On the same
mean principle, some snob, a short time ago, when GEORGE CRUICK-
SHANK had treated us to “The Bottle,” was understood to contemplate
bringing out “The Bible.” There is something peculiarly disgustin
in the attempt to get a “run” out of the Scriptures and the Book o
Common Prayer, and in trying trade, “dodges” on the religious sym-
pathies of the public. Superadd to this the singular offensiveness of the
appeal to that vulgarity of taste and feeling which is gratified by the
#iºn of charity children, in their ridiculous and degrading costume,
playing pretty. Seemingly, there are persons whose ideas of Art are

who may be safely recommended as a study to the necessitous, draughtsmen, whose
poverty of resources has driven them to throw themselves on the parish.
LEGISLATIVE LITTLENESS.
THE new House of Commons, though intended for the
making of Statutes at large, is so constructed as to render
necessary the making of statues in little. SIR BENJAMIN
HALL having visited the studio of a sculptor employed on
the stone figures, intended to adorn the walls of Parliament,
was struck by the fact that many of the greatest characters
of º history appear so remarkably narrow-shouldered,
that they could never have sustained the weight of their
own, heads, much less the weight of public affairs, that
had been thrown upon them.
. When SIR BENJAMIN asked for an explanation, he was
informed that the statutes had been made to measure,
according to certain niches allowed by the architect, who
leaving ample room for the stretching of the legs, had pro-
vided for extremely contracted chests, among the illustrious
individuals whom the artist had undertaken to chisel. The i
result is, that many of the statues will have the appearance
of sugar-loaves; and most of the distinguished men will
seem as if they had been purposely pinioned or trussed for
the roasting that criticism will inflict upon them.
It is very hard upon such a man as HAMPDEN, for in-
stance, to be limited to a few inches from shoulder to
shoulder, when in life he demanded elbow-room for all,
and won his celebrity * his regard for liberal measures.
Historical accuracy will be much impaired by the placing
of various political characters in such a position as to
leave them no room to turn round, though they may have
been notorious for their adroitness in that movement.
Some of the statues have been so curtailed of their fair
proportions by the r tions as to size, that the well-
known political watchword of “Measures, not men,”
would be applicable to the greater part of them.
WAR TO THE KNIFE AND FORK.
A BANQUET was lately held in aid of the funds of King's
College Hospital, and the following notice was published
for several days afterwards:—
KING's COLLEGE HOSPITAL.
“Notice.—The hats and coats left at the dinner of the above Hos-
pital, have been removed to the Hospital.”
Such was the energy and enthusiasm of the supporters of
the charity, that they determined to stock it with a quantity
of patients at once, and that, this might be done without
#. to anybody, the patients selected were inanimate.
ts with broken crowns, coats with the loss of an arm,
trowsers.with a lacerated leg, and pantaloons with seats
looking like the seats of war, were gathered in large num-
bers, and as it appears by the notice we have given above,
were dispatched to the Hospital. We might extend the
dismal catalogue with bits of shirts torn at the bosom,
and rent to mere ribbons streaming with gore and gusset, to
say nothing of gloves cruelly bereſt of fingers, and pocket-
handkerchiefs prematurely mangled.
It is satisfactory, however, to feel that the sufferers were
removed to the Hospital, from which we can imagine the
issue of a series of bulletins in the following fashion:—
“The hats have enjoyed a tolerable long nap, and the
wounded arms of some of the coats having been sewn up,
are progressing towards recovery: Several of the trowsers
have been discharged cured, with no other appearance of
having suffered but a stitch in the side, which is nearly
imperceptible. Several shirts with a gathering in the neck.
which had been unhappily torn open, have been restored
under an application of fresh cotton. Very few of the
sufferers are past recovery, but we regret to say that, an
aged paletót was so much shattered in the affray, that it
was fºund impossible to bring it to, by making it one
again.”
ART IN PARLIAMENT.
We have all respect for the genius of Ma. Edwin
LANDSEER, but when LoRD MAHoN calls him the first
painter of the age, it does appear to Punch that it is sending
Art a little too much to the dogs.

| THE CHEERFUL MOURN. "
THE EMPEROR OF CHINA is lately dead, yet the sun is jing awa
merrily as if he had not lost a brother; the moon was all last we .
the week, before, in a state of the most smiling brilliancy, notwith.
standing the decease of a cousin; and as to the stars, they are every
night twinkling away and *...* it up with the most unfeeling disre-
gard to the memory of an affectionate uncle. Considering the close
relationship of the late Emperor to all the celestial bodies, we might
have expected a general mourning in the skies, an eclipse of both sun
and moon, with a new suit of sable clouds for the whole starry com-
munity. ORION's band should have had its drums all muffled on the
day of the funeral; the GEMINI, or Twins, should have sported a couple
of “suits of strong boys' black,” and AquaRIUs should have been got up
in a mourning gown, with a little bit of black crape fastened round the
rose of his watering-pot.
We have not heard whether there is to be a Court-mourning for the
EMPEROR OF CHINA in this country, but we suppose that if such a
ef, the gap that exists
measure is adopted, as, distance mitigates -
e dear : cause our trappings of
between ourselves and th
woe to be of a mild and moderate character.
We recommend the arbiter of these matters to issue directions that
in order to show our grief at the loss of the EMPEROR OF CHINA, we
should § into mourning by drinking black tea until the 14th of June,
on which day the mourning may be changed tº mixed, which is to last
until the 30th., after which day we may be at liberty to go into i.
as a sign of the mourning having ceased altogether. On the day of
the funeral, had we known it, we should have proposed that every
family should have discharged a spoonful of gunpowder into the pot,
as a salvo of respect to the Emperor.
We think the Court Circular should have issued some instructions
on the subject, if it had only been to recommend the general adoption
of the willow-pattern plate for one week, in consequence of the great
loss of China. ,

ON HORROR'S HEAD HORRORS,
DURING the morning of the first
trial of the new House of Commons,
all the members were talking at once;
and there was such a noxious atmo-
sphere of bad jokes floating over us
and around us, that our senses were
scarcely our own, and they were cer-
tainly nobody else’s, for nonsense
seemed to prevail in all directions.
One of the jokes, perhaps from its
being heavier than the rest, fell to
the level of our ears, and we give it as
a specimen of the rubbish that was in
general circulation. Somebody asked
if the selection of a summer's day for
the experiment was for the purpose of
debate. “No,” was the reply; “choice
has been made of a summer's day with
a view, not to the debate, but to the
Summary.” Happily this atrocity
escaped notice in the generaldin; and
the delinquent made his escape by
leaping over all the forms of the House
into an adjoining lobby.
-
Dreadful Case.
A MAN-we do not give his name
out of respect to his family-aman is
at this moment suffered to be at large
who perpetrated the following atrocity.
The conversation ran upon “the
Afreedee contumacy on the Indian
border,” when the shameless offender
observed, that the enemy must
always beaten, seeing that they were
never anything but “half-ready!”
The man—we repeat—is still at
large.
BENEFIT OF RESPECTABILITY.
THERE is one rule at least which is supposed to be without exception
—that recorded in the poetical reflection of the youthful pickpocket—
“Him as prigs wot isn't his'n.
Wen a 's cotch'll go to pris'n.”
But even the committal of a detected thief is no matter of certainty at
all police offices. At the Marylebone tribunal, for instance, it seems
that a man may steal bricks, and be let off with a penalty,+on a certain
condition. The Daily News reports that at the Temple of Themis in
question, one—
“MR. WILLIAM HARNshall, a person of considerable property, residing in Fitzroy-
place, Kentish-town, was charged with having stolen two bricks, the property of the
Commissioners of Sewers.” -
A policeman, RANSBY,.61 S, caught this gentleman, whom he sus-
pected of having stolen bricks before, in the fact, red (brick) handed.
The constable deposed that—
“He (witness) who had ...}. marked some of the bricks, had not been long in his
hiding-place when he observed the prisoner come up to the wall, and with a chisel
remove two bricks, which he put into his silk et-handkerchief, and then walked
away in the direction of his own house, situate about 200 yards from the spot.”
MR. WILLIAM HARMSHALL was taken to the station-house, and
loºked up on a charge of felony. That he took the bricks out ofº: ful
mischief-aspecies of frolic, libellously to a respectable indivi of
the feathered creation termed, a lark—was not pretended: and in
answer to any such excuse that might have been pleaded—
“Witness further stated that he found other bricks laid down so as to form a path at
the rear of the prisoner's dwelling, some of them had the initials before referred to upon
them; and in all probability had been removed from the wall from which the two (pro-
duced) had been stolen. Suspicion of the robbery was entertained against some poor
persons; but there was now every reason to believe that they were entirely innocent;
the wall was much damaged.”
Who cannot imagine that he sees the prison yard in which the poor
persons suspected of the robbery would now be in case it had been they
wh9, were detected in committing it? Yet poverty is the only palliation
of theft in the opinion of most people. But by way of reason why
MR, WILLIAM HARNshALL should not be committed to take his trial
for felony like any ordinary person charged with that offence,—
“MR. Woolf said that his client felt acutely the indiscretion of which he had been
guilty, and was willing to make any reparation in his power for the wrong he had done;
he would put the wall into proper order, and in addition thereto would be happy to con-
tribute a sum of money to the poor-box; he was a man of great respectability, and his
family were much distressed at the situation in which he was placed."
. So that great respectability, instead of great poverty, is the extenua-
tion of dishonesty, according to MR. Woolf. By respectability, of
course, MR. Woolf means solvency, or the being well off, because
brickstealing is, in itself, obviously a refutation of any pretence to
that attribute in the sense of moral character. MR. Woolf's advocacy
appears to have been less judicious than successful. The very fortunate
conclusion of the affair for MR. WILLIAM HARNshALL was that—
“MR. Bhoughton having ascertained that the Commissioners were willing to leave
the case entirely in his hands, and that they had no desire to prosecute, remarked that
the respectability of the prisoner was an aggravation of the offence, but under all the
circumstances he should deal with the case as one of misdemeanour, and not as a felony;
and for the unlawful possession of the bricks, he inflicted a penalty of 50s, or one
month's imprisonment in the House of Correction. The FINE was IMMEDIATELY PAID.”
MR. BROUGHTON is here judge and jury. As jury he finds the prisoner
guilty of misdemeanour, consisting in an act of theft, aggravated by
respº º As judge he inflicts a fine of 50s. The ability to pay fifty
shillings and not feel it, may be taken as a practical definition of
“respectability.” Of course, “the fine was .# d,” and the
offender escaped comparatively unpunished by reason of that which was
the aggravation of his offence. MR. WILLIAM HARNSHALL may or may
not steal more bricks; but he will not be likely to find such another
brick as MR. BROUGHTon. -
Derby Donkeys,
We observed a large number of asses in returning from the Derby, I
last week. They went principally with the yans—not between the
shafts, however, but inside, and .# viciously inclined, and too stupid
to bandy verbal jokes, they amused themselves by throwing flour over
gentlemen's §: We regret not having had an opportunity to dust
their jackets in return.

A TALE OF A WHALE.
F. M. THE DUKE of WELLINGTON and the Margate Boatmen have
been recently in the position of the Lion and the Unicorn, except that,
instead of fighting for the crown, they have been fighting for a whale,
which was fool enough to tumble like a great sand eel, on to the sands
of Margate. F. M. THE DUKE, treating as fish all that comes to his
met, as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports claimed his share of the
prize, and refused to allow the captors to bone the whale for the sake
of the whalebone. MR. WADDINGTON, the Margate surgeon, took up
the matter on behalf of the boatmen, when F. M. THE DUKE, or
WELLINGTON presents his “compliments” in a manner anything but
complimentary. F. M., is not aware of any, relationship, between a
Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and the Court of Admiralty of
the Cinque Ports, and F. M. expresses his determination to dispose of
the proceeds of his share of the whale without consulting the opinion
of MR. WADDINGTON,
There is no doubt that F. M. is entitled to do as he pleases with his
own; and if a donkey were to tumble over the cliffs, the Lord Warden
might come into competition with other claimants for the carcase. We
can imagine the DUKE's answering an *:::: from a stranger
something infthe following manner?—“F. M. THE DUKE or WEL-
LINGTON presents his compliments to MR. BLANK. The DUKE is not
aware that MR. BLANK has any relation with the Admiralty, or with
the donkey found on the Margate Sands. F. M. THE DUKE will dispose
of own share of the proceeds of the donkey, and will be #. to
hand over the skin to any one whom it may happen to fit, and who is
entitled to wear it.”
LIBERAL OPPONENTS OF PROGRESS.
To ColoneL SIBTHORP.
“GALLANT Colonel,
“I’M sorry I’ve no vote for Lincoln. Never mind; I'm your
constituent in heart. I admire your views and sentiments altogether.
Your fine old English speeches always delight me. I was particularly
pleased with the noble declaration you once made, that you were deter-
mined to sleep with your ancestors—that you would do it! As your
well-wisher, no less than my own—I am an undertaker, Sir-allow me
to say that I hope it is no untoward circumstance that has prevented you
from offering the spirited opposition that I expected you would to the
Metropolitan Interments’ Bill. I know you must have been unavoidably
disabled from sticking up against this Wi. job and sanitary humbug.
I am sure you regret that very much. Console yourself, Sir, by consi.
dering how nobly your F. was supplied—and by whom P %. by
our most out-and-out Liberal Metropºſitan Members. Would any one
have believed it? MR DUN.com.BE, MR. WAKLEY, and LoRD DUDLEY
STUART, did all they could to shelve the bill...Qf course they “approved
of the principle”--just a little flourish this, to soap the sanitary
reformers—but “objected to the details.” Never mind what they
thought of the “principle” of the bill; thank them for endeavouring
to pick it to pieces. Then, how splendidly they argued in defending
our vested interests! Here’s wisdom and logic for you, from LoRD
DUDLEY STUART of all men; who now shows what I call truly liberal
sentiments. These are his words, as given in the Times:—
“‘The clause of the bill which enabled the board to fix the price at which funerals J
were to be put, and to receive contracts from undertakers, was in opposition to the
principles of political economy.'
“Of course it is. So is providing model lodging-houses for the poor
at 14. a week; thus underselling the private building-speculator and
landlord; and, I may add, robbing the undertaker.
“Again: look at the candid and sensible remarks which his Lordship
is reported to have made about us:-
“‘He would grant that there were instances of extortion in this branch of trade.
But were the undertakers the only tradesmen in this metropolis who were extortionate?’
(Hear, hearſ) Were there no extortionate tailors or shoemakers? If so, why should
not the Government step in and say that these tradesmen should charge only a certain
price for a coat or a pair of shoes?' Butchers, too, very often charged a very high price
for meat. (Hear, Hear!) Then why did not the Government prepare a public scale at
which the butchers were to sell their joints of meat?'
“You, CoLoREL, at least, will see the force of this reasoning. Some
people may say that there is a difference between us and tailors, shoe-
makers, and butchers. You hear such persons complain, that we are
enabled to charge at our present figures by having to deal with cus-
tomers generally knocked over by grief—too distracted to bargain with
us—whereas people usually know what they are about in ordering a suit
of clothes, a pair of boots, a leg of mutton. But, as LORD DUDLEY
STUART, doubtless, would reply, are no boots ever purchased under
frantic excitement, whether arising from love or bunions? Does
nobody ever rush to his tailor's in a state of frenzy, occasioned by
wanting clothes on an emergency? Is there no one that sometimes
sends out for a chop, in the desperation of hunger?...Government does
not protect such reckless parties from imposition. Then why should it
interfere to defend those prostrated by affliction from the little over-
charges of undertakers ? -
“Must not the greatest booby on earth perceive that the cases are
quite parallel? - --
“Is it not a triumph, CoLoREL, to find ultra-liberal members sidin
with us in defence of our time-honoured graveyards?... Ill-nature
jesters say they have become the champions of Corruption. But a
joke must hit hard to break your head, or that of your humble servant,
“BONES.
“P.S. SIR. B. HALL, ALDERMAN SIDNEY, and MR. Osborne also
came out strong, for the coffin-interest. f flatter myself we’ve a
tolerable parochial influence at elections, CoLonEL.”

T H E P R O S E R.
ESSAYS AND DISCOURSES BY DR. SOLOMON PACIFICO.
W.—ON AN INTERESTING FRENCH EXILE.
As he walks the streets of London in this present season, everybody
must have remarked the constant appearance, in all thoroughfares and
public places, of very many well-dressed foreigners. With, comely
beards, variegated neck-cloths, and varnished little boots, with guide-
books in their hands, or a shabby guide or conductor accompanying a
smart little squad of half a dozen of them, these bonest continentals
march through the city and its environs, examine NELSQN on his inde-
scribable pillar, the DUKE of York impaled between the Athenæum
and the United Service Clubs—les docks, le tunnel (monument du génie
Français), Greenwich avec son parc et ses whites-bates, monumens de la
cité, les &uarr, du West End, &c., The sight of these peaceful invaders
is a very pleasant one. One would like to hear, their comments upon
our city and institutions, and to be judged by that living posterity; and
| I have often thought that an ingenious young Englishman, such as
there are many now among us, possessing the two languages perfectly,
would do yery well to let his beard grow, and to travel to Paris, for the
purpose of returning thence with a company of excursionists, who arrive
to pass “une semaine à Londres,” and of chronicling the doings and
opinions of the party. His Excellency the Nepaulese Ambassador,
and LIEUTENANT Futty Jung, know almost as much about our coun;
try as many of those other foreigners who live but at four, hours'
distance from us; and who are transported to England and back again
at the cost of a couple of hundred francs. They are conducted to our
theatres, courts of justice, houses of parliament, churches; not under-
standing, for the most part, one syllable of what they hear: their eager
imaginations fancy an oration or a dialogue, which supplies the words
delivered by the English speakers, and replace them by figures, and
sentiments of their own façon, and they believe, no doubt, that their
reports are pretty accurate, and that they have actually heard and under.
stood something. -
To see the faces of these good folks of a Sunday—their dreary
bewilderment and puzzled demeanour as they walk the blank streets
(if they have not the means of flight to Richemont or Amstedd, or some
other pretty environs of the town, where gazon is plentiful and ale
cheap), is always a most queer and comic sight. Has not one, seen
that peculiar puzzled look in certain little amusing manikins, at the
Zoological Gardens, and elsewhere, when presented with a nut which
they can't crack, or examining a looking-glass of which they can't under:
stand the mystery—that look so delightfully piteous and ludicrous? I
do not mean to say that all Frenchmen are like the active and ingenious
animals alluded to, and make a simious comparison odious to a mighty
nation; this, in the present delicate condition of the diplomatic relations
between the two countries, and while LoRD STANLEY's questions are
pending respecting papers which have reference to the affairs of a cele.
brated namesake of mine, would be a dangerous and unkind simile; but
that, as our proverbial dullness and ferocity often shows itself in the
resemblance between the countenances of our people and our boules-
dºgues, so the figure and motions of the Frenchman bear an occasional
likeness to the lively ring-tail, or the brisk and interesting marmozet.
They can't crack many of our auts; an impenetrable shell guards them
from our friends' teeth. I saw last year, at Paris, a little play called
“Une Semaine à Londres,” intending to ridicule the amusements of the
excursionists, and, no doubt, to satirize the manners of the English.
Very likely the author had come to see London—so had M. GAUTIER
-so had M.VALENTINQ, the first of whom saw ‘vases chiselled by
BENVENUTo” in the pot from which MRs. Jones at Clapham poured out
the poet's tea; the second, from a conversation in English, of which
he didn't understand a syllable, with a young man in Messrs. HUNT
and Roskell's shop, found out that the shopman was a Red Republican,
and that he and most of his fellows were ºf under the tyranny of the
Nº. Very likely, we say, the author of “Une Semaine à Londres”
had travelled hither. There is no knowing what he did not see; he saw
the barge of the Queen pulling to Greenwich, whither Her Majesty was
going to manger un ercellent sandwidg; he saw the bateaux of the blanch-
isseuses on the river; and with these and a hundred similar traits,
he strove to paint our manners for the behalf of his countrymen.
I was led into the above and indeed the ensuing reflections, upon
reading an article in the Times Newspaper last week, on citizen LEDRU
RQLLIN's work on the decadence of this unhappy country; and on a
subsequent reference to the work itself. That great citizen protests
that he has cracked the British nut, and, having broken his grinders
At it, pronounces the kernel utterly poisonous, bitter, and rotten.
o man, since the days of PITTETCOBOURG, has probably cursed us with
a more hearty ill-will, not O'Connell himself (whom the ex-tribune
heartily curses and abuses too) abused us more in his best days. An
enthusiastic malevolence, a happy instinct for blundering, an eye that
naturally distorts the objects which its bloodshot glances rest upon,
and a fine natural ignorance, distinguish the prophet who came among
us when his own country was too hot to º and who bellows out
to us his predictions of hatred and ruin, England is an assassin and
gorruptor (roars our friend); it has nailed Ireland to the cross (this is a
favourite image of the orator; he said, two years in Paris, that
he was nailed to the cross for the purpose of saving the nation!) that,
while in France the press is an apostleship, in England it is a business;
that the Church is a vast aristocratic corruption, the Prelate of Canter.
bury having three million francs of revenue, and the Bishop of Hawkins
having died worth six millions two hundred and fifty thousand; that
the commercial aristocracy is an accursed power, making * Rºle
Britannia” resound in distant seas, from the height of its victorious
masts; and so forth. I am not going to enter into an argument or
quarrel with the accuracy of details so curious—my purpose in writing
is that of friendly negotiator and interposer of good offices, and my
object eminently pacific.
But though a man paints an odious picture, and writes beneath it, as
the boys do. “This is England,” that is no reason that the portrait
should be like. MR. SPEC, for instance, who tried to draw ERMINIA
as a figure-head for the Proser of last week, made a face which was no
more like hers than it was like mine; and how should be, being himself
but a wretched performer, and having only once seen the young lady
at an Exhibition, where I pointed her out? As with SPEC and
ERMINIA, so with LEDRU and BRITANNIA. I doubt whether the
Frenchman has ever seen at all the dear-old country of ours, which he
reviles, and curses, and abuses.
How is LEDRU to see England? We may wager that he does not
know a word of the language, any more than nine hundred and ninety-
nine of a thousand Frenchmen. What do they want with Jordan when
they have Abanah and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, which they consider
to be the finest and most cleansing waters of the world? In the reader's
acquaintance with Frenchmen, how many does he know who can speak
our language decently? I have, for my pºrt, and for example, seen
many of the refugees whom the troubles of '48 sent over among us, and
not met one who, in the couple of years' residence, has taken the
trouble to learn our language tolerably, who can understand it accu-
rately when spoken, much more express himself in it with any fluency.
And without any knowledge of §. RoLLIN, who blunders in every
page of his book, who does not make the least allusion to our literature,
one may pretty surely argue that this interesting exile does not know
our language, and could not construe, without enormous errors,
any half-dozen sentences in the Times. When MACAULAY was busy
with his great chapters on KING WILLIAM, he, thoroughly learned
Dutch, in order to understand, and have at first-hand, the despatches of
the PRINCE or ORANGE. Have you heard of many Frenchmen
swallowing a language or two before they thought of producing a
history? Can THIERs read a page of NAPIER f . No more than LEDRu
can, or communicate in our native language with any Englishman, of
any party, from LoRD JoHN MANNERs to MR. JULIAN Y.
How many houses has LEDRU visited of, the ruffian aristocrats who
are plundering the people, of the priests who are cheating them, of the
middle classes who are leagued with the aristocracy, or of the people
themselves? Is he intimate with any three English families? with any
single nobleman, with any one parson, tradesman, or working man?
He quotes a great mass of evidence against England from the Morning
Chronicle: did he translate from the Chronicle himself, or get a secre-
tary.” Can he translate? . If he will, without the aid of a dictionary,
sit down in our office, and translate this paper fairly into French, he
shall have the last volume of Punch gilt, and presented to him gratis.
The chances are that this exile never sees our society at all; that he
ets his dinner at a French table d'hôte, where other unfortunates of
is nation meet and eat, and grumble; that he goes to a French café,
or coffee-shop used by Frenchmen, to read the French newspapers; that
he buys his cigars at a French house; that he takes his walk between
the Quadrant and Leicester Square; and that he takes his amusement
at the French play, or at a hotel, in Leicester Place, where there is a
billiard and a smoking room, and where the whiskered Redmen can meet
and curse l'infäme Angleterre. - -
MARIus sitting in the ruins of Carthage, and, scowling, on his pur-
suers, is a grand figure enough; but a French tribune loº upon our
Carthage, standing alone we may fancy, against the des status,
yonder in Leicester Square, is the most dismal, absurd, Judicrous image.
imaginable. “Thou hireling soldier,” (says he, folding his arms against
the statue, and knitting his brows with an awful air), “thoushuddering
Cimbrian slave, tell, thy master that thou hast, seen CAIUS MARIUS,
banished and a fugitive, seated on the ruins of,” &c., The minion of
despots whom he addresses does not care in the least about his scowls,
or his folded arms, or his speech; not, he-Policeman X points, with
his staff, thinks within himself that it's only a Frenchman, and tells
him to move on. --- - -
To an exile of this sort what a daily humiliation London must be!
How small he fº amongst the two millions! Who the deuce
cares for him? The Government does not even pay him the compliment
of the slightest persecution, or set so much as a spy or a policeman as
a guard of honour at his door. Every man he meets of the two millions
has his own business to mind. Yonder man can't attend to MARIUS
he is CHowLER, and has got to “chaw up” PEEL. The next can't

THE HOUSE THAT BARRY BUILT.
AFTER all the expense that has been incurred in the building of the
new House of Commons, we are now told that it is not large enough
for the accommodation of all the members, and that, in fact, the House
will never be able to contain itself. In the event of a call compliance
will be impºssible, and we shall expect to see the doors of the Commons
beset like those of the º: Theatre, by M.P.'s anxious to obey
the SPEAKER's summons.

be made to keep his charges within the same narrow dimensions as the
work he has undertaken to execute. It is true enough that the busi-
ness of the House is usually performed by a minority of the members,
but as the useless majority will have quite as good alright to occupy
the House as the really working members, how are the affairs of the
nation to be carried on, if the non-workers should take it into their
heads to attend regularly and thus curtail the accommodation of the
statesmen and legislatºrs of the House of Commons? We may
presume that the system will eventually be adopted of dividing portions
of the House off into stalls, reserved seats, and private boxes, for those
who like to pay the price demanded, while the ordinary run of members

SCRIBE v. SHAKSPEARE.
RNowING the argument of a book will, in some cases, save us, the
trouble of reading it. A treatise “On the Substance of the Moon,
showing that it is really Green and Caseous,” might be sufficiently judged
of by its title. A.; few are likely to be the readers of a
pamphlet, in which the author's object-apropos of ScRIBE's burlesque
of the Tempest—is, according to the Times,
“To show that SHARspeame, if he had lived at the present day, would probably have
made the Tempest an Opera, rather than a spoken drama, and that, therefore,
M. Schibe is carrying out the English poet's intention.”
The idea, in the first place, of the * conceptions, and images
of SHAKSPEARE-addressed by him to the fancy and the philosophic
intellect-spun out into trills and quavers! Or, the idea of SHAKSPEARE
turning his drama into an opera, with all these his peculiar beauties
omitted! The idea that SHAKSPEARE would not have left such a work
to M. SCRIBE, unless he could have got an injunction against him to
|hinier it!. The idea of comparing SHAKSPEARE with Sgambº!, And,
lastly, the idea of saddling º these absurdities on a certain unfortunate

COMPENSATION FOR EVERYBODY,
WE congratulate the landed interest on the probability that before
the first of April next the Government, will have taken measures for
making it some amends for the losses which it has sustained in conse-
quence of the Repeal of the Corn and Cattle Laws. Our reasons for
expecting that Ministers will adopt these, considerate stºps are com-
prised, in the following paragraph which has appeared in various
journals:-
*Tºº DEFUNør-Palace Count-It is understood that the Treasury has awarded
to each of the four barristers of the Police Court the sums they paid for the purchase
of their places. Ma. Best, M.P., paid £2000 for his appointment as one of the four,
and was the last purchase allowed. The attorneys and rs of the defunct court are
said to be waiting for compensation.”
We want to know what sort or description of personal interests can
be overlooked, if those which are vested in the Palace, Court are to be
respected?...Whoever buys a place in such an establishment speculates
on future Governments keeping up the rascality which he thinks to
profit by. A distinguished moralist has-or ſought to have-laid it
down that a bargain implying the maintenance of an abuse is an im-
moral contract; therefore, not binding: and that º may at any
time abate nuisances without regard to those who have staked money
on their permanency.
As to the attorneys, and officers of the Palace. Court who may be
waiting for compensation-let them wait for it a little, longer;-yes, a
littlelonger than the innkeepers and coach proprietors that have suffered
by railways.

FIELD MARSHAL PUNCH 0N. EPSOM DOWNS AFTER THE GREAT DERBY DAY.
THE MARBLE ARCH. ~.
d We have received permission to publish the subjoined correspon-
-dence :- - * * *
SIR GEORGE GREY to PUNCH,
- - “Downing Street, June 3. .
“SIR GEORGE GREY presents his Compliments to Mr. Punch, and is
desirous of acquainting himself with Mr. Punch's sentiments relative to
the unfortunate, marble, arch—the relict of GeoRGE THE FourTH
of gold frog memory—at present in front of Buckingham Palace. . It
has been suggested by the highest personage. in the realm that if
Mr. Punch—as a trifling testimonial to his unvarying, and triumphant
services in the cause of fº. humour and rational order—would accept
the aforesaid marble arch to span Bride Court, and thereby to give a
more distinguished appearance to Mr. Punch's Qífice, the structure is
wholly at his service, and shall be forwarded without delay by an early
Parcels D-livery. - -
“SIR GEORGE GREY avails himself of the present opportunity to
make a further enquiry, namely, whether Mr. Punch will consent to
stand for his statue, to be placed in one of MR. BARRY's niches in the
House of Commons.” .
, PUNCH to SIR GEORGE GREY.
“Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the receipt of SIR GEORGE GREY's
letter; and further wishes to convey his gratitude—if he may trust the
#. § the hands of a Cabinet Minister—to the highest personage of
e realm. . . . .
“Touching the arch, the thing is altogether puerile; and Mr. Punch
has long ceased to º at marbles.
“With respect to the Statue, Mr. Punch cannot consent to accom-
modate his hump and shoulders to the stone strait waistcoat of
MR. BARRY.”
A Sound OBJECTION.—The great defect of the new House of
Commons seems to be “an extreme slowness in transmitting sound.”
We shall not mind this defect so much, if the slowness is only com-
pensated for by an additional quickness in transmitting sense.
A TARDY CONSCIENCE.
CoNscIENCE not unfrequently sleeps; but it is seldom that it takes
so long a nap as we infer must have been taken by the conscience of an
individual whose act is recorded in the Times of last Saturday. It is
there stated that the Paymaster-General has received from some i. -
mous individual the sum of £10, “su poºl to have been unavoidably
overdrawn during the Peninsular § r.” Now it is upwards of
thirty years since this overdrawal must have taken place; and we can
only wonder at the obstinate nature of the lethargy into which the
conscience must have sunk, that has not wakened up during a period of
nearly the third of a century. |
We fear the conscience is not yet quite roused up, and we must
take the liberty of giving it a good shake, tugging it by the button, and
slapping it on the back, in order to open its eyes a little wider, and
render it thoroughly alive to the fact, that the interest on the £10 for
thirty years has yet to be dubbed up, before the conscience can quietly
set itself down again to repose. This gentleman's conscience being
somewhat of a sleeping beauty, in the length and intensity of its maps, we
consider it all the more necessary to pull it unceremoniously out of its
bed, to prevent its “tumbling off” again, and being wholly oblivious of
the arrear of interest that is clearly payable. Conscience would make a
capital thing of it if it kept the principal in hand for a long series of
years, and then made a merit of paying over the original sum, after
pocketing the interest. We have, therefore, nothing further to say,
than “Come, arouse thee, arouse thee, my merry merry boy,” to this
anonymous individual.
The Government Plan of Education.
MR. DRUMMOND defines Education as “something drawn out of a
man.” According to this, Education is the same as Taxation, which
the Government understands “drawing out” of the people to a very
great extent, and yet Education and Taxation can never be synonymous
terms, for it is a lamentable fact that, heavily taxed as the English
º are, they receive very little, if any, Education in return for it
rom the State.

THE MAISON DE DEULL OF PROTECTIONISTS,
In consequence of the general ruin that has spread over England,
it is not unlikely that the great body of Protectionists-and it is sin-
gular that mostly all Protectionists have great bodies, which is another
proof of the starvation to which they are reduced-will be going intº
mourning. In anticipation of this mournful event, a large commercial
house in the City is about to open an immense Maison de Deuil.
The premises, appropriately enough, are situate in Cornhill. We were
conducted over them a day or two ago, and the following is a short
description of their manifold attractions, as far as our agonised feelings
will enable us to recollect.
The sign of the house is “That Traitor Peel.” The shop is almost
larger than Holmes' or EyeRINGTON's. The exterior is plain but sub-
stantial. The summit is decorated with, a full-length figure of Fortune
with a crape band over her eyes, holding the Cornucopia, out of
which are flowing houses, horses, greyhounds, dog-carts, county mem-
bers, and prize oxen. The arms over the door are very simple-t
tankards of home-brewedale on a field of bread and cheese, and the
motto, “Ruin stares us in the face.”
. The interior of the shop is most sumptuousin its grief. There is an
air of comfortable poverty about it that rather invites than repels. We
longed to sit down on-one of the knotted garden chairs that line the
counters, and call for one of the tankards that are foaming (with rage,
of course) over the portico. All f of commiseration left us as
we passed the door-step, and on contemplating the abundance and
jollity that floods the whole place with a glorious sunshine of woe, our
only desire was to be ruined as quickly as possible.
Stout-looking farmers stood behind the counters. Their fat faces
were dimpled with the most good-natured wrinkles; to look at their
round cheeks, was to laugh, Crying was out of the question, HERA-
CLITUs himself could not have done it. They carried handkerchiefs
with deep black borders to them, but these evidently were only used to
hide their smiles, so that visitors might not see them jº. The
tops of their boots were blacked over, and they sported weepers, and
it was strictly sporting, for it was a costume that, far from drawing
tears, only provoked merriment. -
We were conducted by an elegant-looking gentleman, in polished
leather boots and a silver riding-whip to the “Protectionists' Unmitigated
Woe Department.'...Here we were shown a meat book of patterns. . It
contained maps of the several estates in the kingdom to be sold, owing
to the unparalleled pressure of the times. There were mansions with
princely parks for noblemen, down, to two-roomed cottages with
cabbage-gardens ºr. labourers at six shillings a week; but really
the prices of them all were so extravagantly high, that we are ashamed
to confess we were too poor to effect the smallest purchase. Our
conductor gave a mournful smile, as much as to say he deeply felt for
us, but that it did not matter in the least.
After this we were led to the “Partial Grief Stores.” It was adorned
with lists of the jº races and cattle-shows all through the
country, embellished with portraits in ebony frames of distinguished
racers, and celebrated cows and pigs that had won prizes.
..The next room was the “Inconsolable Lumber-room.” It was a small
library, filled with the most agonising speeches and harrowing debates,
all !. the question of the national ruin, Newspapers were
strewed about the floor, with reports of meetings that are said to have
shaken not only the Corn Market, but the Bank to its v centre, so
much so that it is a wonder that Mark Lane and Threadneedle Street are
standing at the present moment, Beautiful miniatures of Protectionist
Qrators, their familiar features crowned with gold laurel leaves, enliven
the otherwise dreary walls of this little apartment, . We were kindly
offered the last speech of MR. FERRAND, hissing hot from the hustings,
and taking the hint in the friendly spirit in which we are sure it was
offered, we immediately ran out of the room.
A pair of beautiful folding-doors, sheeted with the richest *.
were thrown open to make way for our retreat, and we found ourselves
in the middle of such a picture of misery as we had never witnessed
before..., Immense, long tables were groaning-and their groans, har-
monised half-melodiously with the painful feeling that lay, like a black
pall, over the room—under heavy sirloins of beef. Huge haunches of
venisºn added to the oppressive weight of the scene. Yorkshire pies,
raised pies, fruit pies, pies of every kind of game and rare delicacy, were
strewed about in such reckless disorder as only wretchedness can
produce, and, by their heavy looks, that evidently betrayed how much
Mºh in them, made one's mouth, if not one’s eyes, water to look
al, them.
. Ugly-looking mugs, filled with bitter, ale, lent a darker hue to the
picture, which was made st ker by small groups of bottles, with
silver heads, that kept hanging about the corners, and assembled in
greater force the oftener they were dispersed.
“What is the name of this room?" we inquired in a whisper, for
fear of disturbing the sºlemnity of the meeting... “This, Sir, is the
‘Speechless Misery Department,’” answered our attendant—and, true
enough, though there were at least a hundred persons present-and
several Members, of Parliament amongst them—yet not a syllable was
heard. It only showed how deep must be the grief that could not find
words to express itself!
...We felt the influence, of the place Jºš stealing over us, and

On getting into a cab, we were astonished at the very agreeable feelinga
that animated us from head to foot. We had jº so well, in such
boyish good temper with all the world, since the memorable day, on
which we recollect we first carried a gold watch. We determined to
turn, Protectionist—to get ruined—and to get installed, a constant
member of the Maison de Deuil as quickly as our funds would enableus.
We begin to find out that there is no comfort, no pleasure in the world,
equal to that of being rmined. The only drawback which we can see con:
nected with such a luxurious state, would be the constant uneasiness of
recovering some day from our ruin, and then having to fall back again
into the same miserable state of happiness we endured before. Only let
us be ruined-ruined for life-and we shall die happy!

PUNCH AMONG THE PICTURES.
FLIGHT THE THIRD.
.Many of Mr. Punch's good friends the painters are very angry with
him for what he has written already under this title, charging him with
injustice and narrowness. As to the first charge, he has only to say,
that he made a sweeping attack on a common vice and sin. That there
are many painters whom the vice grieves quite as much as it grieves
Mr. Punch, he knows very well, and he could, no doubt, have cited
examples of pictures with meaning, and sentiment, and passion in them,
and of portraits which were true representations.
Let, all, painters of such pictures, and portraits hold, themselves
exempted from Punch's Jeremiade. It does not include them. They
ought to be thankful that he has lifted his bâton against those spreading
abominations of furniture pictures and conventional portraiture—
“No-Let the galled jade wince, their withers are unwrung.”
But it is not Punch's purpose, or business, to pick out these meri-
torious gentlemen from their offending brethren. ... .
Let the Public do that, when they pay their shillings in Trafalgar
Square—so Punch would, if he were writing a catalogue raisonnée of
the pictures in the Exhibitions. But that task he leaves to the writers
of the daily papers, who have on hand a stock of stereotyped phrases
for the praise and blame that is yearly doled out to the painters in the
month of May as a matter of business.
a discontinuance of Sunday. labour, in the Police force. Legislation,
advancing in its present spirit, will soon render all work, not strictly
necessary on the Sabbath, illegal. The sole and only business of the
Police is to keep order in our, thoroughfares, and protect our dwelling-
houses. But it may be confidently expected that Sabbatical enactments
will soon put down every cab, omnibus, railway-train, steam-boat, on the
Sunday. , None will go abroad, except a few pedestrians, who may be
left to take the consequences of their impiety. |

The streets will soon be exclusively occupied by thieves, with nobody
to rob but one another. The houses will be sufficiently defended by
their inmates, who will be forced to stay at home. The only conceivable
occasion for policemen will be afforded, when people walk to church, for
walk they all will and must, when not even a bishop will be suffered to
ride. They will keep Bibles and Prayer-Books at their places of worship;
but, still, they will be obliged to carry pocket-handkerchiefs, if only §
way of provision for the sermon. It is undoubtedly possible that their

Punch, on the other hand, squeaks out of the fulness of his heart, and
mourns over the pretty face and scanty brains of the Muse of English
Painting, because he cannot help it. He goes into the Exhibition, and
comes out of it with his mind less impressed, his imagination less stirred,
his fancy less titillated, than it is easy to suppose possible, after a wall
of some thousand pictures has been spread for his entertainment. . .
But you charge him, further, with narrowness. His demand being
that you should paint truly what is, he reduces Art, you say, to a mere
servile re-production of outward Nature—and so destroys invention, and,
. creative Art altogether; making, at best, Daguerreotypes of
you all.
Not so. All he said, was, that if you, have to paint Joneses, you
should paint Joneses—real, not impossible Joneses. ...But all artis not
painting Joneses, and, even for the true representation of that, large
and common-place family, there is needed a generalisation, as well as a
istribution and subordination of parts, which leave Art
quite work enough on her hands when she goes no further than this.

he asks for is, that there be meaning in what is painted, and truth, in
expressing that meaning. Pictures ought, in his mind, to be books,
the characters whereof are colours and forms. The point in the picture

PUNCH*S BIRDS.
oME of the highest flights
taken by philosophy, have
been in pursuit of birds,
Science, in the form of
Ornithology, has been
running about for ages
with a pinch of the salt
of research between its
fingers, to place on the
#. of the feathered com-
munity. From the days of
Romulus and REMUs,
birds have played an im-
portant part, in history,
and the student will not
require the elbow of his
memory to be jogged by a
reference to the achieve:
ment of that respectable bird, the goose, whose well-timed cackle saved the Eternal
City when its durability was doubtful, and who, in his roasted state, was the
har º: of good fortune to QUEEN ELIZABETH... -
The Bird must always occupy a very high position, whether we look at him as a
lark, or, with wondering eyes and gaping mouth, regard him as a swallow. The
feathered tribe present so many phenomena from the very tip-top of the crest to
the lower extremity of the drumstick, that, were we to take him fº, pieces, feather
by feather, we should find a few words, to say upon each, and still reserve some;
thing more to say of him by filing, his bill for future comment. Though the bird
is not like the dog, emphatically the friend of man, nor like the cat, the friend of
woman, he is still on very amiable terms with most of the human family. Assumin
for the sake of illustration, the correctness of the º doctrine, we's
suppose a sort of amalgamation, between the bird and the human biped, and shall
take the bird in handjust as if it were a member of our civilised community...There
are many varieties of strange birds to be met within the everyday º: of life, and
though not apparently deprived of liberty, there are many who live in a cage, for
which Convention supplies the wires. All birds, however, are not restricted by
the network, sometimes gilded, and sometimes iron, that society throws around so
many, and perhaps, after all, the bird who is ever at liberty to hop the twig, is in
the most enviable position.
Intending to run through the whole race of social birds, from the hawk down-
wards to the duck, keeping in our eye the jay, and comprehending all pies, from
the magpie to the Roller—who, by the way, would seem to belong equally to the
ies and the puddings—we shall start with the most agreeable of the series, the
arblers.
THE NIGHTING ALE.
This delightful specimen of the warbler is very plentiful in England, but the
choicest of the class are to be found during the spring, summer, and autumn,
when, in addition to our native birds, some of the rarest mightingales visit this
country, from Italy, Sweden, France, and other parts of the continent. The might-
ingale—as the name implies-sings chiefly at night, and abounds in gardens, such as
Covent Garden, or delights in hay, many of the most favourite sort having found
a very desirable nest in the Haymarket. In the former locality there is still to be
seen a splendid specimen of the female nightingale, which emigrated some time ago
from the latter spot. This splendid nightingale is universally known as GRISI, a
magnificent specimen of the class, and possessing what DR. BECHSTEIN describes,
in his Natural History ºf Cage Birds, as a wondrous union of “compass, flexibility,
prodigious variety, and harmony of voice, which make it so admired by all lovers
of the beautiful.” -
The nightingale, as an Operatic bird, is liable to many diseases, and its tendency
to cold is so great, that a draft may render, it mute, though sometimes a pecuniar
draft adroitly applied, or even a mere ordinary puff, will at once restore its incli-
nation to exercise its vocal powers. Their notes are only to be procured at a
very considerable cost, and some naturalists have gone so far as to allege that
the note of the Operatic nightingale is due to the constant supply of Bank notes,
which, in this country, the bird in question lives upon.
The mode of catching a º: is rather curious, and sometimes very difficult,
on account of the competition among the principal Operatic bird-fanciers for the
rarest and most valuable specimens.
The ordinary method of capturing a bird, considered to be of great value, and
where two or three are º: to achieve the same result, is by º on a firm
bank, a very large bait, when the nightingale, having usually a long bill, perceives
the deposit ready to meet its bill, and drawing the bait from the bank is imme-
diately tied by the leg or caught in some legal lime that has already been spread for
binding purposes. The Operatic mightingale is remarkable, not only for the variety
and beauty of its plumage, but for the frequency of change that occurs in the
course of a season, so that the bird may appear to be constantly moulting, yet never
suffering the weakness incidental to the process, but coming out entirely changed
in appearance night after night, each appearance putting an additional feather in
the cap, and enabling the º: to soar higher and higher in public favour.
The maladies to which 9. rds of all descriptions are subject would fill a
volume, and we can therefore only find room for a few of them.
The catarrh or gold is avery common complaint, to which we have already alluded.
It is often caused by cold water being thrown upon the nightingale by the engines
i--------—----- -
of criticism; and then the remedy, according to DR. BECH-
steps, is a compound of “fresh butter,” which can hardly
belaid on toothick for the taste of an Operatic nightingale.
Straining of the throat is a frequent cause of injury to the
best of birds, and this is continually brought on by their
being fed upon leaves—of music—of a most unvegetable
character. º, sort of verdure-called by the Italians,
Werdi—some nightingales have the instinct to avoid, and the
famous nightingale GR1s has preserved her powers unim-
paired, by her taste having directed her to refrain from
the deleterious article, and confine herself to a more whole-
some commodity. º
-- -
A POETICAL INTERREGNUM.
THERE has been a considerable gap in the succession, to
the Poet-Laureateship, though it is rather singular that
there should be any interregnum whatever, for if poeta
nascitur non fit, we ought to find a . already born for
the office, and not be compelled to look out for the poeta,
who when ºf may be a miss-fit, and be º: wearing
the crown of laurel. Many are of opinion that the pause in
the succession has been caused by a necessity for taking in
the diadem, that, though not too large for the temples of
the late laureate, would completely bonnet theindividual
who may be selected to come after him. |
The chief difficulty we see about the office, is the fact of
there being nothing to doin it. Theyirtues of our QUEEN
are of too matter-of-fact a sort, and of too every-day occur-
rence, to be the subject of mere holiday odes, or, indeed, of
fiction in any shape. As the angler refused to go fishing,
because there were no fish, so the Poet Laureate finds a
difficulty in employing his fancy, because the virtues of the
Sovereign form such a prosaic matter of fact as to afford no
opportunity for mere flattery to Fº the lyre. If any
duties are to be attached to the Laureateship, we would
propose that they should consist of the task of giving a
poetical turn to that otherwise very dull and uninteresting
affair, the Court Circular, which fills, the somewhat con-
temptible duty of Paul Pry in constant attendance on what
ought to be the domestic privacy of royalty. As an illustra-
tion of what we mean we give the following specimen:-
This morning at an º hour,
In Osborne's peaceful grounds,
The QUEEN and PRINCE-ºspite of a shower-
Took their accustomed rounds.
With them, to bear them company,
fºrce Lennºn he went,
And with the other royal three
The Duchess, eke, of KENT.
His Royal Highness PRINCE OF WALES
Went forth to take the air;
The PRINCEss Royal, too, ne'er fails
His exercise to share.
On the young members of the flock
Was tenderest care bestowed,
For two long hours by the clock
They walked—they ran—they rode.
Calmly away the hours wear
In Osborne's tranquil shade,
And to the dinner-party there
Was no addition made.
Judge-Advocate SIR. D. DUNDAs
aving returned to town,
The Royal Family circle has
Settled seremely down.
The Strongest Thing in the World.
THE Gamel has a peculiar way of remonstrating when
too much is being put upon her back. She turns round,
and sighs. If the sighs take no effect, she weeps. The tears
are generally irresistible, and she is allowed her own way.
We º: heard of the same expedient being resorted to
when ladies consider themselves “too much put upon.”
They turn round, and weep, and instantly they are allowed
their own way. The strongest thing in the world is de-
cidedly a woman's tear, for we never knew a manyet who
could stand-up againstit!

SHAKSPEARE COOKERY BY M. SCRIBE.
M. ScFIBE threatens to oust M. SoYER, and to surmount the laurels
Qf the original dramatist with the paper-cap of the cook, M.SCRIBE's
first dish to an English audience having been relished with such delight,
d|press scribes—their ink-bottles foaming with champagne—having de-
d|clared the fricassee of wondrous spiciness and flavour, andfast men having
smacked their mouths, and ; their applauses, of the treat, the new
French Opera Cook, in the depths of his gratitude, is about to publish
the recipe by which he has been able to lay before a thoughtful,
SHAKSPEARE-loving audience, the savoury mess. Punch has been
favoured with an early copy of the document.
HOW TO COOK A SWAN (OF AVON.)
Cut the swan into pieces, throwing away the heart and brains.-
Put the fragments of the swam in a brazen kettle.—
A; over a quick fire, which fan with the poem of Wenus and
0nts.-
Sir with the toe of MLLE. GRISI, now fast, now gently; now stir
not at all.-
Use LABLACHE as a bellows, when wanted to boil.-
Take a song of SoNTAG's, as cold champagne, occasionally to cool.-
Boil again with an air by Col.ETTI-.
Cool and boil, and boil and cool, until the fragments of the Swan
shall be thoroughly dissolved.
Strain through canvas, painted by MARSHALL- - - -
Serve hot to an enlightened public, who will be frantic with delight
that a French cook should have made so admirable a fricassée of their
adored Swan of Avon.—
N.B. It would doubtless give the dish a fine flavour if the fire could
be made of the rafters of SHAKspEARE's Birth-place.
Further, Mr. Punch may be allowed to advise M. ScFIBE, who can
hatch such admirable French geese of his own, not to meddle with the
Swan of Stratford.
WHAT HO! WATCH, I SAY.
WE have for some years, kept a watch on the London clocks, and
have always had in our eye the hands of the principal public timepieces.
Chance and a threepenny 'bus—one of the Atlas, which never could
have been intended by the immortal bard, when he wrote the words,
“fixed as great Atlas self,” for the "busses in question are remarkable
for the fewness and brevity of their stoppages;-chance, then, and an
Atlas 'bus took us the other day to the neighbourhood of the Qld
Cavendish Street Post-Office, Instinct led our eye to the clock, which
we instantly perceived to be, suffering with a sort of delirium tremens
in the hands, which are so shaky that they let the time slip, as it were,
through their fingers. We believe the clock does not suffer from any
internal complaint, but there is such a nervous movement of the hands,
that the clock would seem to be affected by a sort of St. Vitus's Dance,
which causes it to, play truant in a Truandaise of a very desperate
description. The clock keeps its own internal arrangements very well,
but rumour and our own correspondent have informed us, that the
Post-Office authorities keep a man expressly to lead the clock by the
hand, and it is only by his constant vigilance in going hand in hand
...; clock that it can ever be made to conduct itself with the least
regularity.
A NATIVE APPEAL TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
MAY IT PLEASE YoUR Honour ABLE House,
I AM an oyster, a real native; and as such have within me the
largest and noblest pearl ever bred by British, mollusc. My house-
that is my two shells—is little more than simple lime; yet—with the
pearl inside-what a treasure it contains f
Oysters of the House of Commons, does my condition preach no
moderation—no moral to you? Your House has already cost two
millions of money, and I should like to know what will be the value of
the pearls dropt from the mouths of its tenants?
Yours, (with a broad hint),
A MoDEST OystER.
DEAF TO COMMON SENSE-AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
IT seems that it is very difficult to hear anything in the new House
of Commons. According to this, the fallacy of petitioning will be
rendered clearer than ever, for it will be quite impossible now for the
people to “gain the ear” of Parliament.
CAUSE FOR ExPLOSION.—Of all names, we think that "GUNN.” must
be one of the most unpleasant. It must be so very trying to one’s
temper to be continually asked if you are the “son of a gun?”

A BIT OF MY MI N D.
BIT THE EIGHTH.
MRs. MoUSER TRIES HER HAND As AN EXPERIMENTAL LEGISLATRESS.
MR. PUNCH,-Having my own notions, perhaps a little assisted by
the Beadle of Exeter Hall–(by the way, Susan NAH, is not going to
leave us, for all her warning; the Savings' Bank, in which she put her
bit of money having failed, and the Policeman that was to marry her,
failing immediately afterwards)—having my own notions, upon what an
Act of Parliament ought to be to double lock the Sabbath like a prison
door, with chains and bolts to make it fast and respected,—I have stept
out of my sex for once to give my pattern of an Act of Parliament as it
should be; which pattern I beg to send through you, Mr. Punch, to
that suffering nobleman, LoRD AsHLEY; who, I understand, has—upon
his own authority—sacrificed his reputation for the good of the working-
classes, who, I hope, will show their proper merits of his Lordship's
goodness, by presenting him with a costly piece of plate, or some such
foken it isºt often, Goodness knows! that a real nobleman º:
into a gulf like the Roman CURTIs, and when he does, he Qught to be
thanked and respected accordingly. But, Mr. Punch, to give you my
draft—as I believe it’s called, of
AN ACT of PARLIAMENT FOR SECURING THE SUNDAY.
ºščičāś,-It has been thought nothing but proper, especially
by the Dignities and Authorities assembled in Lord ASHIEY's Drawing-
room and MR. PLUMPTRE's back-Parlour-to take a loving Care of the
Souls and Consciences of the Masses of HER MAJESTY's loving Sub-
ects, too many of 'em not a bit better than Turks and Heathens, and
owing no more of the Sunday than the Mackarei that is sold by
Act of Parliament, to the Grief of the truly Respectable on that †.
It is Enacted, to begin with the extreme Beginning, that if shall not
be lawful for *... Male or Female, Single or Twins, to be Born
on a Sunday. asmuch, and for the very Reason, that many respec-
table Professional Gentlemen, to say Nothing of Druggists’ Assistants
and Monthly, Nurses, are—by such Forgetfulness of the Seyenth Day—
§: up and out at a Minute's Notice, to the Neglect of their better
uties. - -
And Further, If Children, after the Passing of this Act, in Contempt
of the QUEEN, the Bishops, MR. PLUMPTRE, and LoRD AsHLEY, will
f: on, coming into the World on a Sunday, as if no Act to the contrary
had been set forth, and Signed by the QUEEN, with her Crown on her
Head, and her Sceptre in her Hand, THEN
All Such, Sabbath-born Law:Breakers—Boys or Girls, Single or
Twins, shall be deprived of all Civil and Political Rights, being con-
sidered Born out of the Law, and therefore to be treated as little
Rogues and Vagabonds, who will have no Right to know that they
exist at all, except when such Knowledge is brought Home to their
Consciences and Pockets by the Law that shall, to the end of all Time,
cast them in Double Taxes.
Further, Be it Enacted, That all such Offenders born on a Sunday-
and thereby coming into the World in Contempt of Our aforesaid
Sovereign Lady, the QUEEN, MR. PLUMPTRE, and LoRD AshLey in
º.T. never be Christened. And, Further, if any Archbishop,
ishop, or Dean shall, in Violation of this Act, attempt to baptise any
Felonious Infant so offending, that then the said Archbishop, Bishop,
ºr Dean shall be liable to Support, Provide, and Pay for every such Boy,
Girl, Single or Twins, as if such said Baby or Babies were their own
natural Flesh, and not born Outlaws, with no acknowledged Father or
Mother, or Nurses Wet, or to the Contrary.
. Further, Beit Enacted, That—in place of Baptism—the said Felo-
nious Sucklings born on Sundays shall be numbered only by the Beadle
of the Parish (properly Empowered for that §: that, denied the
Christian Comforts of a Name, they shall—by the Figure borne—carry
their own Register as to their numerical Strength, and Social and Poli.
tical Weakness...
(And be it particularly Enacted. That the Beadle of Exeter Hall shall,
by Virtue and Violence of his Office, be the Grand Registrar Beadle of
all Felonious Infants born on Sundays in Her MAJEsty's United
Empire, Herne Bay and the Isle of Man included.)
And, Further, to assure the Better Observance of the Sabbath—now
tºo, frequently violated by the Performance of the Marriage Service-
all Parties joined tºgether in Matrimony on a Sunday, shall not be con-
sidered joined at all. John Brown and MARy White, wedded on the
Sabbath, shall by no means be held One Bone and Öhe Flesh, but Sepa.
rate Bones and Separate Flesh; that is, the Bones and Flesh of John
and the Bones and Flesh of MARy, as if no Ceremony whatever had been
performed, or celebrated between them.
And Whereas, divers Excellent Rose-coloured People—and especially
LoRD AshLEY and MR. PLUMPTRE-have been mightily grieved and
scandalised at the Performance of the Rite of Marriage on #. Sabbath;
and Whereas they—the Rose-coloured People Aforesaid, moved by the
most virtuous Scruples, would lay Axes of all'Sizes, and without Number,
to all the Roots of Sunday Neglect as especially shown in Sunday
Matrimony,
38e it &natten, That all Mercers shall have a Certificate signed
by not less than Three Respectable Householders (who have paid their
ater-Rates,) that any Silk, Satin, Lace, or any Commodity of their
Trade, sold for Wedding-Gowns, Wedding. Ribands, or Wedding-Laces,
are not to be used, put on, or worn for a Sunday Wedding; and, in
Default of non-Requirement of such Certificate, that they, the Mercers,
shall be committed to Gaol for not less than Three Months, with or
without Oakum, at the Decision of the Magistrates. -
And Be it. Enacted,—That the same Clause shall apply to all Tailors
supplying Wedding:Coats. with their Supplements. o, all. Glovers
vending Wedding-Gloves. To all Pastry Cooks dealing in Wedding-
Cakes and Wedding-Breakfasts. And, Further, that all Carriages and
Post-Horses belonging to Post-Masters, let out for Hire or Reward to
Sabbath Wedding-Parties, be confiscated to the Parish, the Beadle of
Exeter Hall having—in Virtue of his Office—Right and Authority to
seize one Carriage to his Own Use, with not more than Four Horses
for every Statute Twelvemonth. -
And Further, Be it Enacted, That all Tavern-Keepers, Licensed
Victuallers, and Others who shall—without Enquiry—harbour and com-
fort any Sunday, Bride and Bridegroom for the Honeymoon, or, any
º thereof, shall forfeit their Licence for Ever and Ever, and be
mulct in a fine of not less than Ten Pounds, to be carried to the Poor.
And Further, That no Tradesman soever, shall recover the Amount
of any, Debt for any Goods or Commodities, whether of Food, or
Apparel served during the Honeymoon—(which, to Qffenders shall
henceforth be known as the Aloes Moon)—to those Criminals who
believe themselves Married on a Sunday.
And Further, That as it is a Matter of deplorable Notoriety, that
Many º º: for the Feelings of divers Rose-
coloured Individuals, and of LoRD AshLEY and MR. PLUMPTRE in
Particular, have been known to Die, or Decease, or otherwise become
Defunct on a Sunday— -
#e it enactet, That henceforth every Man, Woman, or Child, who
shall henceforth violate the Feelings of the Rose-coloured Individuals
aforesaid, and especially of MR. PLUMPTRE and LoRD AsHLEY, by
P# on the Sabbath, - -
SHALL BE BURIED by Certain Undertakers by Law Appointed,
who shall exact any Amount of Cost of Funeral that *}. them, seem
Fit—burying the Sabbath Defunct Criminal in Rough, Deals, and with
not an Inch of Feather, and that such Amount, shall be paid by the
#g or Assigns of the dead Culprit, at their Peril refusing to disburse
the Same.
And Further, Beit Enacted, That All Parties dying on Sunday—and
thereby offending certain aforesaid Parties, and particularly LoRD
AsHREY and MR.PLUMPTRE—shall have their Epitaphs written by the
§: of Exeter Hall in the blackest Paint, and in the very hottest
yllables.
Long Live the
Long Live MR.
There, Mr. Punch, that is my notion—with a little of the Beadle's,
Iown—of An Act for the Better Chaining and Bolting of the Sunday,+
a notion which I will thank you to forward to LoRD ASHLEY, and beg
of him to believe me (with yourself),
Truly Bound by his Lordship,
AMELLA MoUSER.
UEEN, and (saving Her Royal Presence),
LUMPTRE and MR. ASHLEY!

FILCHING A GOOD NAME.
THE republic of letters is remarkable for the number, and variety of
the titles to which it annually gives rise; some of the titles being
almost as unaccountable in their origin as that of the celebrated NATHAN
Barony, now existing in Kennington. The last eccentricity of author-
ship in giving a name to a work is exemplified by the daily annºuncº-
ment of “The Shoe and the Canoe, or Travels in Canada.” In
accordance with the customary rule of imitation, we may expect shortly
to see advertised “The Sock and the Rock, or a Week at Gibraltar,
as well as "The Highlow and the Highlands”. “The Slipper and, the
Iceberg,” with a crowd of other counterfeits of the original to which
we have alluded. The “Shoe.” &c., will soon have a tribe of imitators
treading on its heels, for every one is ready to follow the steps, or stand
in the shoes of a successful writer... - - -
It is in vain to attempt to achieve a singularity of title; for the
singularity is immediately changed into plurality by the mass of
imitators, who, though always jealous of success, are in some respects
different from the ...} monster, inasmuch as they are thoroughly
unable to make “the meat they feed on.”

THE REAL FLOWER-SHOW.
THE Right
THE STAR OF FRANCE AND HIS SALARY,
..LOUIS NAPOLEoN often having afforded us a good laugh, we shall offer
him in returna fº. cry. “Vive Napoléon II/" and “Vive l’Empereur /*
have been tried and won't do. Something more rational is required as
a shout for the PRINCE PRESIDENT. The want is supplied to a nicety
by the apposite exclamation,
“VIVE LA REPUBLIQUE DRAMATIQUE ET THEATRALE!”
The dramatic, and theatrical republic—not the social and democratic
republic, or the simple republic, is precisely what the French Republic
is. It is a declaiming, singing, dancing, decorative, scenic republic.
Its histrionic character is peculiarly manifested in Louis NAFoleon
regarded as its representative. His part of President consists mainly of
regular stage-business, riding about in full uniform, distributing|f
crosses; pinning decorations to the breas's of meritorious peasants,
and making wives and children happy. It is but just to say that he
goes through even the heaviest act of charity con amore, and enters into
the spirit of his situation. However, it seems that he has trusted to
the national management to indemnify him for his disbursements;
singe he now applies for a dotation-bill to enable him to pay the debts
which he has incurred in character, and to sustain his somewhat ex-
hausting part... By continually repeating “Hold; take this purse,” the
word being suited to the action and the purse containing real cash, the
Rºost opulent, pockets must be emptied in the end; and if Louis
NAPQLEQN is to go on relieving distress and dispensing happiness to
#. he must be the goose with golden eggs, or else, if he persists
in such munificence, he will be the goose without them. Much indig.
nation has been raised by his demand for an increase of salary; but it
is perfectly, reasonable that, being expected to furnish a constant stream
9 bounty, he should claim an adequate supply from the national well.
9therwise, indeed, he would be a mere empty. Pump. No: let his
friends cry “Wive la blique dramatique et theatrale /* and base is
that Public, which seeks for orders, and grudges even to pay the
expenses of the poor actor.

THE WELLINGTON CORRESPONDENCE.
THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON, will go down to posterity not only as
the hero of a hundred fights, but as the hero of, at least, a million
letters. Future ages will declare that never were the spirit and the letter
so strikingly combined, as in the grand junction of valour and epistolary
correspondence that distinguishes the conqueror of Waterloo. He
was evidently born, to be a man of note, in every sense of the word,
and is as much at home in presiding over the billet of a soldier,
as in replying to the billet of any one who, addresses him. F. M.
THE DUKE, will be looked upon by posterity, as the polite letter-
writer of the nineteenth century. Everybody writes to him, and he
writes to everybody in return, so that, of all his numerous dis-
tinguished posts, the General #ost will hereafter be regarded as his
avourite. It is calculated that he consumes more letter-paper than
six of the largest commercial houses in England *: together, and if
he does not ride, about with the order of the Bath on his breast, he
never stirs from home without investing his stationer with the usual
order of the Bath Post—on which he writes his daily ream of letters.
We think a great deal of trouble might be saved if F.M. were to start
a weekly newspaper, to be called either The Duke's Life in London, or
The Apsley Times, for the purpose of answering his numerous corres- |
pondents in some five, or six columns of sma º for, eyen if the |
journal did not pay half its expenses, he would save a fortune in
postage.
Lopez and Cuba.
OLD smokers will remember a cigar which used to be sold under the
name of “labelled Lopez.” The Lopez now, become, so celebrated
should be labelled “Pirate.” In connexion with the subject of tobacco,
we may make the observation, that from literary to common piracy there
seems to be but one step in America, and advise Jonathan to put that
in his pipe and smoke it.
