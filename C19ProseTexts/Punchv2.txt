PUNCH'S EPILOGUE TO HIS
HIS SECOND
VOLUME.
9)
WELL, have you seen “ Punch ?”
What do you think of “ Punch ?”
Was there ever anything like “ Punch ?”.
Such a quantity of capital stuff, too, in “ Punch!"
But “ Punch can never stand !
Oh, impossible ; " Punch" is too clever to live !
Undoubtedly: “ Punch” has put all his fun into his first number.
I'll give “ Punch" a month—just a month.
Hang it! I'll give “Punch" six weeks.
Will you ? I'll give “Punch” three; not a day more than three ! -
(Whereupon, bets were laid; and much money lost upon “Punch.")
How many thousands of our readers will bear testimony to the truth of the above quotations ! How many
thousands must remember the surprise and admiration on the part of the town-tempered with a gentle pity, that
such a glory could not last-when
“PUNCH-Nº. II.”
Tose
, like another morning star, upon it! How good folks, fond of a joke, paused in their chuckle, and, “ beating
their pensive bosoms,” cried—“Delicious! but too too good to go on.” Ignorant of the limits of the powers of human
wit
, as applicable to this world, they believed that “ Punch” could only s be continued in the next.” To proceed
as “Punch" started, was a superhuman ambition—a presumptuous endeavour, to be henceforth classed with the
building of Babel, and the perseverance of the boy Jones.
Well, surprise was deepened into love-admiration has ripened into faith. This day, we write-
“ PUNCH-N°. L.”
And a grateful generation take off their hats, and with gratitude oozing, like honey-dew, through every pore of their
confess that this world has yet another grace worth living for!
We protest that what we are now about to indite we put not down with a swagger of triumph—No: we have
ne such caterpillar crawling about our heart. But what we pen, we pen as a mild rebuke—a gentle, bene-
volent warning to all men of all fature generations, born—like helpless porcupines—to a heritage of quills.

PUNCH'S EPILOGUE.
“ No, no ; impossible. "Punch' will be vulgar.”
666 Punch' is and must be, very low.”
“Punch 'will, doubtless, be personal.”
“Of course, 'Punch,' from his very name, will poke his nose into all the dirty alleys of life; and carry his
three pennyworth of dirty slander-of foul innuendos, into the dirty market supported by dirty people."
“Very much obliged to you for the offer ; but would rather have nothing to do with • Punch.'”
Such were the disheartening opinions—such the rebuffs that in sundry places were expressed and dealt out
upon “ Punch," when, feeling that he had some truth, some philosophy in him, some results of long and curious
observation upon shifting life,—he sought for various pens whereby to give his various yearnings utterance.
How proudly does “ Punch” at this moment stand! He vaunts not—he swaggers not. He writes with a
dove's-quill, and his ink, he verily believes, has the scent of roses in it. But he feels an honest pride to know that
his truths have smitten the national heart—that his philosophy has been acknowledged—that his views and tales of
life have been relished for their sweet and wholesome fidelity—that, while he has been most merry, he has been most
wise; ever bearing in mind the great truth of one of earth's greatest spirits, that—"indecency is sacrilege to the
majesty of human nature.”
A twelvemonth since, and “ Punch” looked anxiously around him for supporting quills. He breathes no
names; but he cannot refuse himself the satisfaction of turning to his book—this glorious, balmy, “leafy month of
June,” wherein are inscribed the dignities of men, at present clamouring to become contributors. “Punch" has
said he sinks the names, and will merely give a few of the dignities :-
" ONE BISHOP." His Grace solicits the political articles. But“ Ponch” prefers the honey of the Church
to the locusts.
“One Ex-CHANCELLOR.” His Lordship will do anything: and has certainly sent several capital beginnings
on several subjects. Unhappily, however, his Lordship is more famous for his beginnings than his terminations.
“One Field-Marshal.” Offers a series of articles on popular drunkenness and idleness; showing how, with
due sobriety, every weaver may keep a dog-cart.
“ONE MARQUESS.” Journal of a voyage to Ostend; with voyages to any other parts of the World“ PUNCH”
may wish to send him to.
“ Eight EDINBURGH REVIEWERS.” Anything.
" FOURTEEN QUARTERLY Ditto.” Ditto.
“ONE Ex-CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER.” For Money Markets.
“ One Ex-PRESIDENT OF BOARD OF TRADE.” Commercial Reports.
66 ONE PATENT MANAGER.” For Theatrical Criticisms.
66 Six ROYAL ACADEMICIANS." For Fine Arts.
These are only a few of the Aspirants—about a tithe of the number entered. But now, “Punch" is successful:
and oh! what a fine thing is Success!

articles are, so much the better. Large anıt repeated doses of the iceing from twelfth cakes have been found serviceable in inducing indigestion and sickness, when
a mixture of beef, pudding, blanc mange, and underdone chesnuts, has failed. It is advisable to bleed the governors on returning to school. As the cold goes away,
and the thaws approach, exercise should be taken, on wet days, with a hole in the boot if practicable, or a very thin sole and no change. People with delicate
lungs will find an unflinching exposure to the cold winds of infinite service in rapidly bringing about the termination of the complaint ; and the more the ehest
is exposed, the sooner will the invalid see the effect.

METEOROLOGICAL REMARKS.
WEATHER houses, containing a little man and woman, are particularly valuable, from the certainty with which they indicate a change of weather, some six or
cight hours after it has occurred. It is a popular error to imagine that fine weather can be secured by pinning the little man inside, or turning the barometer topsy
turvy, to make the mercury rise in the dial-plate. The breaking up of a frost may always be ensured by the purchase of a new pair of skaits. You may safely calculate
on rain, if you plan a pic-nic party, or a visit to a Vauxhall Gala. Fine weatber may be obtained by leaving home with a macintosh, clogs, and a shabby gingham
umbrella. To nautical gentlemen, who are in the habit of whistling for a wind, the air of " Cease rude Borcas” will be found particularly efficacious: while gentlemen
in second floors, uvablo to raise the wind, will be certain to get up a breeze, by requesting their landlady to whistle for her rent.

Cold bathing is now universally recommended. To enjoy it properly, you should rụn a small distance in the sun, and when in a perspiration, plunge into the water
head over ears. Al fresco picnics may be attended occasionally, which should always be prolonged until the night-dews come on; and recollect, that whenever
overheated by rowing, walking, or any other exercise, a tumbler of cold spring water is the most grateful and refreshing beverage that can be swallowed. Spasms of
the stomach are serviceable in stimulating its coats, and these may be produced by a liberal exhibition of ice-creams. Quantities of Cayenne pepper and hot pickles
are also highly beneficial in exciting the gastric reactions, and promoting appetite. The liver may be kept wide awake by the same means,

The best angling for Cockney Sportsmen is to be found on the marble slab at Grove's in Bond-street. Cod can be secured any day in the vicinity of Billingsgate,
and Turbot may be taken readily with 30s. Lively gold and silver fish in glass globes may be caught by the introduction of an active cat, or by letting off the water from
the vitreous receiver. Splendid covies of Dorking chicks may be found in the noted preserves at the foot of Holborn-hill; and two or three couple of rabbits may be
knocked off the hooks with a half-crown piece at this celebrated warren. There is also another Warren at 30 in the Strand.

POLICEMAN 0, No. 1, has got such an accumulation of corn in bond,
under a tight boot, that it is expected he will be allowed the benefit of
nominal or fixed duty. He is one of the most extensive growers of corn
in the kingdom, and always has on foot a prodigious quantity, which, when
he is in competition with those who try to take advantage of his position,
must naturally prevent him from striking the average.
Onions were dull at fourpence a rope, and wild ducks were heavy, with

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NORMA MADE EASY.
Act I., scene one-a Druidical grove ;
An oak in the centre, the moon above,
Which is skilfully managed ev'ry night
By a boy at the back of the flat with a light.
An altar kept burning with spirits of wine
Stands under the oak, which is Norma's shrine.
Enter the chorus-a goodly lot
Of soldiers, and bards, and the deuce knows what,
Headed by some unfortunate elf,
Who, because he happens to walk by himself,
Is mistaken for Leffler, and gets three rounds
Of applause, and cheering which knows no bounds.
But now Oroteso himself appears,
And of course is received with vociferous cheers;
The audience scarcely in calmness can sit,
Handkerchiefs wave in the boxes and pit;
Some who stand up to see with more ease,
Get a poke from a stick, with “ Sit down, if you please *
The gods not so civil, in blustering tone
Demand that some victim shall over be thrown ;-
While Leffler, before the music begins,
Comes forward and gratitude gracefully grins,
Forcibly dashing his hand on his breast,
Which means that the audience knows all the rest.
At length in half-circle the choristers stand,
And scream to a tune that's amazingly grand ;
They ask Oroceso if Norma is near,
When Leffler replies, that she'll shortly appear.
He speaks what he knows to be true, for Miss Kemble
He's seen at the wing in a bit of a tremble ;
After asking the moon most politely to rise,
(A request which a moon on the stage ne'er denies,)
Oroceso, bards, Druids, and all give one shout,
Get near to the side-scene, and somehow get ont.
Next enters adorn’d in most gorgeous caparison
All tinfoil and crimson the Pollio Harrison,
Attended by Flavius (i. e.) Clement White,
Who, though he's decked out as a Roman at night,
It needeth no ghost from the churchyard to say
Is an Irishman neat as imported by day;
They talk about Norma, and Pollio declares
He's heartily tired of conjugal cares-
And says that when sleeping to dream he is apt,
When a lamp in the orchestra gently is tapp'd,
And a very sweet air is immediately heard,
To which he just warbles his dream word for word;
A march in the distance, a chorus within,
The bards and the soldiers are making a din.
Re-enter the bards Oroceso and Co.,
Who sing a fine chorus, and stand in a row.
All waiting for Norma—a buzzing and humming
Is heard through the house—“Now Miss Kemble is coming!
A figure is seen from the side-wing to sally ;
It is she-no, it isn't, it's one of the ballet :
All is silent ; Miss Kemble proceeds to achieve
Her glorious triumphs in recitative,
And gives out a note-not of hand-though 'tis one
Which, like notes of hand, has a long time to run.
The effect that's produced by such marvellous wonders
Is electrical quite, and of course draws down thunders.
The chorus begin then to lustily bellow
For vengeance against some unfortunate fellow,
Whom they hope to see shortly the very dust biting,
A species of mouthful by no means inviting.
“He shall fall,” cries out Norma, addressing the crowd ;
And then in a voice almost equally loud,
Declares that he shan't, and she loves him, and so on,
Then in an allegro continues to go on
About his “returning” and “burning," although
That the chorus are close at her back she must know,
And would hear ev'ry word, if to stage rules obedient,
They wern’t seized with a deafness whenever expedient.
On the buckler of Brennus for vengeance they call,
Requesting his sword to come down from a wall.
Then the scene closes in, leaving people in doubt,
Whether Druids were really the fools they make onto
SCENE II, is the Grove, as before-but a part of it
That's not yet been seen-very likely the heart of it,
Where shady the paths, and where thickest the trees are,
For 'tis the resort of the fair Adelgisa.
Then enter Miss Rainforth, who tells us she's crying,
And visits the spot for the purpose of sighing
In snugness and solitude ; though there is danger
Of being intruded upon by a stranger,
Who, by a slight effort of mental comparison,
We find is no other than Pollio (Harrison).
IIe comes : he invites her to fly-she refuses ;
But in a duet out her firmness all oozes.
GOT INTO SOUNDINGS.
&
The lady throughout an andante melodious
Appears to regard his proposal as odious ;
But ere the allegro is more than half over
She promises freely to fly with her lover.
That at dawn they will meet they impressively swear
Then leisurely both to the green-room repair.
SCENE III. is the dwelling of Norma--good gracious !
Who'd have thought that she rented apartments so spacious !
'Tis
roomy enough, but so bare, that for rent,
One would think that the landlord had recently sent,
And finding his tenant unable to pay,
Had swept by distress all her chattels away.
'Tis true there are certain mysterious things,
Some druidical lumber, adorning the wings;
But still as the sitting-room 's utterly bare
Of sofa, of table, of stool, and of chair,
The conclusion to which one reluctantly comes
Is, that Druids of old used to sit on their thumbs.
Enter Norma, attended-oh, what an affair !-
By two little children with nicely-curled hair,
And faces so blooming that health seems to gush
From the skin,-but it's just been laid on with the bruslr.
Clotilda, (Miss Grant,) who is Norma's own maid,
And who seems, from her dress, to be pretty well paid,
Is order'd to hurry the children away,
To hide them, in fact, and goes out to obey.
Poor Norma feels some one is coming to tease her -:
She turns,—and beholds at her side Adelgisa.
Her love to the Priestess the latter declaring,
Suspects not the awful “ flare-up” she's preparing;
But in a duet freely opens her heart,
While Norma, from sympathy, soon takes a part.
Attentively hearing the tale of the maid,
It strikes her as odd that the lover had said
'The very same things that herself had once heard-
A STAY'D CHARACTER.
Then five more advance the attention to fix, 1
For figurantes always form parties of six.
But at last in good earnest, descending a plank,
Which is call'd in the bills “a druidical bank,"
Comes Norma herself-then what shouting and clapping !
What stamping of feet! with umbrellas what rapping!
That rapture no pen or no ink could describe it,
And then it's so catching the fiddlers imbibe it;
For a minute or two not a note can they play,
On their instruments' backs do they hammer away.
Like a spell the surrounding excitement enthrals them,
Until to their senses the leader recals them.

The pictures ain't done by Mr. Stanfield, nor Mr. Grieve, nor
Messrs.Pitt and Tomkins; but you'll admire them, we dare say.
We only wish they'd been published before the ceremony's cele-

And we've not the least doubt the Right Honourable Lord Mayor

invitation,

Which we should have accepted at once ; but, as it's over, we don't

Though Prince Albert has sent a card to us since to come down to
Windsor and see him, but we've declined it.
But, apropos de bottes, we'll at once commence our descriptive
panorama,
Which, if set to music by Mr. J. H. Tully or Mr. Johnny Blewitt,
would be worthy the attention of Chappel, Lavenu, Duff and
Hodgson, D’Almaine or Addison, Beale and Cramer.
This is a Marshal, upon " a cock-horse."
And would give half-a-crown to be safe on his feet;
But the danger he braves, for a Marshal, of course,
If not à la Ducrow, would be far from complete.

Such a wondrous genius for spreading the mortar,
You'd have thought he was wedded for life to the trade,
And not, as he is, to the Duke of Kent's daughter.
Then next come the Beadles, who're pretty well fed,
And seem deeply iinpress'd with the pride of their state ;
Then follow the Bargemen, bedizen'd in red,
And looking like lobsters prepared for the fêtc.

Who, anxious to prove that the peace he maintains,
Sets to work with his staff on an old woman's head,
And silenced her by the loss of her brains.
These are the Aldermen-Laurie's compeers,
Judges and gourmands--the mace and the myrtle,
Who are versed in the laws of “ Hip, hip, and three cheers !"
And love equity nearly as well as their turtle.
These are the little Boys shouting “Huzza !”
With their faces begrimed, and their feet all bemiry,
And fancying this is a new Lord Mayor's day,
Cry, “ Long live the Queen, and Alderman Pirie !"

The important ceremony of laying the first shell of the great oyster-

the mouth, which has within it two rows of a hard bony substance. His
Majesty's tongue, as far as we could judge, appears to be about the
ordinary size, coming to a point at the end, and communicating at the
other extremity with the Royal gullet.
The royal whiskers are somewhat bushy, and when His Majesty is talk-
ing with animation every hair appears to sympathise. Immediately below
the forehead, and just over the cheek bones, there are two fissures, in which
there are two moveable balls of a dark but brilliant nature, which are per-
petually passing from one side to the other of a whitish space, and giving
great expression to His Prussian Majesty's countenance, and His Majesty's
brow is slightly fluted, and there is a small indentation in the centre of the
upper lip, which it is believed is common to all Prussians.

THE WHITECHAPEL CHRISTENING.
THE other day, being that fixed for the christening of Master
Cleaver, the heir-apparent to his father's shambles, the sun rose at an
early hour, but, with its usual modesty, wore a dark veil of fog
trimmed with Scotch mist, and turned-up with smoke from the well-
known manufactories of the metropolis.
Whitechapel Church was, of course, an object of considerable

interest, for it was the locality selected for the great event, and a
liberal arrangement was made for the sweeping of a crossing exactly
opposite the eastern or principal entrance.
It is well known that a celebrated Overseer from Lambeth had
been invited to stand as one of the sponsors, and he was met at the
foot of Waterloo-Bridge by a member of the family of Cleaver, who
instantly escorted him on board the steamer Waterman No. 1, which
weighed its anchor last week at the old iron shop. The chimney

being lowered half-mast high, the gallant vessel floated through the
bridge under a salute of orange-peel from the balustrades above ;
and drifted majestically through the tier of barges, the crews of
which consisting of a man and a boy to each) gave the usual shouts
and took the usual oaths that are customary upon occasions of any
thing running foul of them. On arriving at St.
George's-in-the-East,
the crew of the Waterman received orders to ease her, which was
done in gallant style, and the command being given to shove her
astern, the steamer hove-to in capital order against a superannuated
coal-barge, which was moored as a temporary pier for the Overseer's
landing. The band of the 95th Street Buffs, or Pocket Rifles, struck
up the “Rogue's March," and the Overseer stepped on shore amid
the shouts of the crew, and was instantly received by the Jack who
officiates at the stairs on behalf of the watermen.

gates were thrown open, the scene was imposing
beyond description. The reserved seats in the
lamp irons were previously crammed to suffocation,
but the space devoted to the public (on the top
of the spikes) was now eagerly sought after.
The coping of the railings displayed a long array of
rank (ruffianism), and several were the fingers that were crushed

an elevated position.

We observed a large party of fashionables on a tombstone in the
yard, and pickabacks were eagerly purchased up at a penny a lift by
some of the more wealthy visitors.
We shall not describe the ceremony of the christening, but we
may add the following interesting particulars.
In order that nothing should be done to detract from the solemnity
of the occasion, it had been resolved that the infant should be

occasions of scrubbing it.
This interesting article, which served as the font, is bound round
with hoops of solid iron, and is provided with a handle of the same
durable material.
The little Prince must love the poor,
And he will heed the cry
Of the pauper mother, when she finds
Her infant's fountains dry.
He'll fill the cruise, and bruise the ear,
To make those founts o'erflow,-
For they have vow'd our little Prince
No " vanities" shall know.
And we will rattle our little bell,
And laugh, and dance, and sing as well -
Roo-too-tooit! Shallabella!
Life to the Prince ! Fallallalla!
Our little Prince will enter in
Where aged Want is housed ;
The old heart he will link again
To that its youth espoused.
He'll bid the mother's soul enjoy
The worship of her young,
And pour into her loving ear
The music of its tongue ; -
So we will rattle our little bell,
Aud laugb, and dance, and sing as well-
Roo-too-tooit! Shallabella !
Life to the Prince ! Fallallalla !
And death's dank bones will then become
Like iv'ry pure and white !
His blood-dyed robe will moulder off,
And his garments be as light ;
For man will slaughter man no more
For wrong begot by wrongs,
For our little Prince will say—“ To me
Nor life nor death belongs."
So we will rattle our little bell,
And laugh, and dance, and sing as well-
Roo-too-tooit! Shallabella!
Life to the Prince ! Fallallalla!

After the ceremony there was a BANQUET, to which, however, none
of the guests at the Christening were invited ; and the Nightingale
omnibus, having been ordered to be under harness, the Overseer,
attended by his suite (Baron Nathan only), stepped into it almost
unobserved, and after remaining at Charing Cross for twenty minutes
to inspect the statue of Charles the First (though the Overseer did
not alight), he was conveyed rapidly past the Treasury, at which he
took a cursory glance, and, passing towards the Marsh-gate, where he
paused an instant to witness the interesting ceremony of paying the
toll, was whirled off by the Asylum and set down at the Elephant.
Here he was received by a deputation of merchants, who called his
attention to the specimens of oranges imported into this country, and
placed under his eyes various specimens of steel pens and lead pen-
cils ; and after a few words (rather high) with a man who thrust
under his notice a knife with 14 blades, the Overseer, followed by his
suite (Baron Nathan only) darted off helter-skelter in the direction of
Kennington.

In case some one asks me her name.
From your own early feelings you truly can guess,
What a fervid affection is mine ;
So to one of the seven I fondly confess
Until death I'm her own VALENTINE.

To hint a Battersea field-day !
Lady-like Mars, my burning lay
Invokes thee! O make me thine,
Exquisite Valentine !
HERO of a hundred balls !
Captain (like him of Eton's halls
At Montem-time) of fancy dresses !
Great in poussette and l'Eté dri ll;
Puissant commander of quadrille !
Bold whisperer under damsels' tresses !
For thee I wake the tuneful nine :
Wilt thou be my Valentine ?
Though that envious girl Letitia
Denies thy rank, e'en in Militia,
Or in the Army-List!
O conqueror—at whist,
I love thee! for thy valiant martial air
Thine eyes so languishing—thy face so fair-
Thy desperate bluster
When rivals muster-
Thine interesting tremour when they dare
What though they say you ne'er smelt powder,
Save that call'd - violet”-that no prouder
Boast is thine of seeking "bubble reputation,"
But by a cannon made at billiards ; nor rely
On any services you've done the nation;
Except inventing a new hair-dye
Warranted to make moustaches stand caresses
Sans peur, especially from heir-esses.
That ne'er was word of stern command
Given by thee, other than such demand
As, "Waiter, bring a glass of lemonade."
Think you I'm of such ridicule afraid,
Illustrious lady-killer ? No! In fine
I really wish you'd be my Valentine !

Oh, darling of spinsters !-who, casting away
The earth and its follies, its pomps and its pother,
With footman behind them ride meekly to pray,
And lose this vain world in the joys of another !
'Tis sweet in the pulpit to see how thou'lt stand,
All scented and curl'd before Heaven's high throne,-
To mark the soft wave of thy diamond-deck'd hand,
Th' odour of sanctity—eau de Cologne !
And how art thou welcomed to revel and rout,
Where claret runs brightly as martyrdom's blood !
An orthodox spell to keep naughtiness out,
An elegant piece of the pious and good !
When wealth-as wealth must-walk in wickedness’ ways,
And take the bad breath of the pestilent hag,-
If straying with thee, wealth is safe as she strays,
As babies midst fevers, with camphor in bag!
How cautiously, gingerly, lisp'st thou of death,
With soft, under-tones dost thou coo about hell !-
The grim King of Terrors is-shortness of breath ;
Perdition-a place where the vulgarest dwell!
And, tender physician of luxury's souls !-
When made to prescribe for their filthiest taints,
If brimstone thou must put in naughty men's bowls,
"Tis brimstone with treacle-a med’cine for saints

Who shudder at death-in the family pew,
And think-once a week upon Sathanas' fire ! -

To be sought without doubtings, or faintings, or cares,

Rake up the plague pit-write—and write in gore !
Or, when inspired to humanize mankind,
Where doth your soaring soul its subjects find ?
Not ʼmid the scenes that simple Goldsmith sought,
And found a theme to elevate his though;
But you, great scribe, more greedy of renown,
From Hounslow's gibbet drag a hero down.
Embue his mind with virtue ; make him quote
Some moral truth, before he cuts a throat.
Then wash his hands, and-soaring o'er your craft,-
Refresh the hero with the bloody draught ;
And, fearing lest the world should miss the act,
With noble zeal italicize the fact.
Or would you picture woman meek and pure,
By love and virtue tutor'd to endure,
With cunning skill you take a felon's trull,
Stuff her with sentiment, and scrunch her skull !

THE ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG LADY.
I an dying with ardent affection,
So I send these few verses to thee,
In the hope they will meet your inspection ;
But I fear you're too clever for me.
And although in intense adoration
There can be no very great sin,
To address such a clever young lady,-
I'm really afraid to begin.
Yes, indeed, you're remarkably clever,
And of talents possess such a store,
That I'm truly unconscious if ever
I witness'd such knowledge before.
I would laud you beyond all conception,
But I fear at my praise you would laugh ;
For I know you accomplish'd young ladies
Are sometimes too clever by half !
You sing with a thrilling expression,
That makes all your auditors tremble,
And warble out “ Del cor tradisti,"
Like Grisi or Adelaide Kemble.
Tis divine—though some illnatured folks,
Full of envy, snarl out in their rage,
'Tis a pity this clever young lady
Wasn't brought up at once for the stage."
You embroider such exquisite patterns
For ottomans, sofas, and chairs ;
And I hear you have finish'd a carpet
That stretches up two pair of stairs :
Though the same set of commonplace people
Opine 'twould be better by far,
If these wool-working clever young ladies
Took stalls at the Lowther Bazaar.
You write the most ladylike poems ;
And I hear that (incog.), now and then,
The Assemblée's elaborate columns
Are graced by the fruits of your pen.
They are brilliantly soft, I allow ;
But with all the respect for a blue,
The world thinks 'tis sometimes a pity
You find nothing better to do.
There are many opposed to such measures,
Who hint from the right you depart,
In cramming the head with such treasures
And wholly forgetting the heart :
But hearts have long ceased to exist,
So I deem your affections are free,
And the chance is not one to be miss'd,
Then, fair one, my VALENTINE be.

They may talk as they will of the feeling that lies
In the flush of the face, or the glance of the eyes ;
But, dearest of footmen, I'd rather by halves
Catch a fortunate glimpse of those exquisite calves.
Believe me, my footman, my gallant, my bold,
In thy splendid accoutrements glitt'ring with gold,
When deck'd (par parenthesis just let me blush)
In those soft inexpressible things made of plush,
To me thou art quite an Adonis, and more,
For he such a costume as thine never wore.
Oh, turn not away from the tender appeal
Of one who her passion no more can conceal :
For I own I adore thee-yes, John, by the air
With which you perambulate Grosvenor-square,
Thou liveried Cupid, of Venus thou son,
Thou servant of Hymen-magnificent John,
By return of the post thy decision pray tell
Am I happy or curs'd ?—sweetest, answer the belle.
Oh, what must thy feelings, exalted one, be,
When told by your mistress to bring up the tea ?
And can there on earth be such terrible brutes
That would set thee to work, love, at cleaning the boots ?
Ah, gladly a hessian, or highlow, I'd be,
If I might but be polish'd, my own one, by thee !
They tell me thou cleanest the knives and the plate-
Oh, had it been kindly permitted by Fate,
I'd change into silver myself pretty soon,
To be leather'd-yes, leather'd by thee as a spoon.!!
But now fare thee well !-With your ultimate breath
When you answer the door to the knocking of death,
On your conscience, believe me, 'twill terribly dwell,
If now you refuse to attend to the belle.

With lips that move controll’d by “the fifth pair,"

Of love and of band-boxes meek prlerine
Sweet sylphide of chapeaux and glances,
Thy faultless corsages make fat women tliin,
While the favour of roués you fail not to win
By the leer which your beauty enhances.
I saw thee last Sunday in Kensington Gore,
Arm-in-arm with young Gusset, the draper,
Who, tenåerly pressing your gants brodés, swore
That he'd give you his love-and a scarf, if no more
You'd encourage the smiles of Lord Vapour.
And when to your garret you stole-in your dreams
Lord Vapour his “first hand” had made you ;
Instead of the gussets, the gores, and tlie seams,
Your coach (like your bonnet) was drawn—by four creams ;
Full measure of homage was paid you.
You awake ! Of its brightness the vision is shorn ;
Poor Gusset you have to bewail ;
“Stock-taking”-your ravishing charms to adorn-
He brought his light fingers and love t'other morn,
To the Compter-appropriate jail !
You turn to Lord Vapour-what less can you do?
Since to doubt that he loves you were treason,
And entreat him to cause your fine dream to come true ;
But he answers your scrawl in words frigid and few,
That “ he's off-out of town for the season."
Then mark me, sweet satin-stitch! I am the beau

THE MAN ABOUT TOWN.
Say who is the man with the Chesterfield coat,
And the fierce stock of satin embracing his throat,
All blue and gold sprigs, with a jewel therein,
That would serve for a drumstick as well as a pin?
With a gilt-headed cane, or a slight flimsy whip,
And an arch of soft down just o'ershading his lip,
As the Regent-street trottoir he strolls up and down-
'Tis the out-of-doors idler—the Man about Town!
Thou art he-though I know not the spot where you dwell,
For where Men about Town live, no mortal can tell,
But 'tis commonly whisper'd you roost rather high-
In a parlour, like Fusbos, “ that's next to the sky.".
The boots of glazed leather, which fit you so well,
Are still owed for, I know, to Lehocq or Gradelle;
But what matter-your aim is to shine in the street,
And dream you enchant every girl that you meet.
And when day has departed, at night's guilty noon,
The smoke-clouded tavern and flaunting saloon,
That teems with forced laughter and hollow-cheek'd mirth,
You deem a true paradise found upon earth.
Then fever'd with wine, as fresh haunts you explore,
A knocker or bell-pull you wrench from each door ;
And if you don't sleep at the Hummums' Hotel,
You are "safe" for a bed in the station-house cell.
I'm not going to preach ; if I've nettled your pride,
"It was all in good part-I meant nought else beside.
But Punch has been long upon town, and he knows,
From wine more of headache than happiness flows.
Then abjure such pursuits and respond to my flame ;
You will find me, gay VALENTINE, toujours la même ;
And a note at the Office, addressed to “ A. B.,"
May be safely confided to Bryant for me.

MY OWN DEAR TURNSTILE --You are above the prettinesses
of poetry, and therefore deserve a Valentine of good, serviceable,
wrought-iron prose. That you are dear to Punch-oh, most
dear!-is manifest to the whole world. I look upon you as a
bit of myself, a piece of my own wood, or chip sliced from my own
heart: indeed, from Machiavelli to Peel, how often have the
scions of politics been confounded with myself! How often has
it puzzled the wisest of the earth to know the difference between
Punch and the Politician, the POLITICIAN and PUNCH!
These, my dear Valentine, are portentous times. You must
learn to speak another tongue,- you must, at least, affect a
sympathy for man and his miseries,-you must have a heart,"
an organ hitherto unnecessary to your species. You must listen
with the profoundest attention to the complaints of misery; and
though you have not the remotest idea of removing them, you
must let your eyes moisten at the history. There was a time
when salt-water was no more expected from the statesman than
“ milk from a male tiger;"now, an onion is indispensable to the
politician. If he have the swallow of the crocodile, he must also
have its tears.
I said you must learn another tongue : it is most true. You
must forget the old conventionalities of political speech, the long-
drawn sinuous nothings that have been the stock of your ancestors,
and acquire the cant of benevolence. We have the Hamiltonian
system for the easy acquisition of the dead languages; but the
Stanleyian mode of teaching the jargon of philanthropy may be
easily comprehended by the very narrowest intellect. The Greek
radicals, under the best teachers, are hard to master ; but the
whole grammarof the tongue of Downing-street (as now published)
is retained as fast as it is read. In one week the illiterate are
erudite,
In times of terrible distress, when the people with surpassing
complacency are mild and reek as the shepherds of Arcady,-
when Famine herself becomes quiet and resigned as a six weeks'
dowager,-- when Beggary smiles wanly at the rags that hang
about her, and Destitution, naked, but cheerful as Musidora,
lays her down on the bare earth, and tries to dream away her
pains,-oh! then, most dear Politician, exhibit the sympathy of
politeness to the sufferers, then tell Famine that her ashy face
has a most becoming hue ; compliment the blueness of her lip,
the dulness of her eye ;' swear that Beggary wears her tatters
with the grace of a gipsy queen ; and vow that utter Destitution
is rendered so sacred by the dignity of her bearing, that you
want the courage to make yourself familiar with her. Whatever
may be the price of corn, surely there need be no sliding-scale for
compliment.
Misery is feminine, and, like all of the sex, will swallow
flattery, and sometimes think it solid pudding.
So to my words do thou thine ear incline,
And be mine own and Famine's Valentine !
Yours, your great progenitor,

into a temporary scrape, by mistaking a gentleman who comes into
the room in a white neckcloth for the waiter, and requesting he will
be good enough to bring him a glass of lemonade.
The visit of her Majesty to this delightful watering-place has been
preceded by several very natural phenomena. First foors have gone
up amazingly, and attics, which have been rapidly coming down for sume
time past, are now as high as ever. Quartern bricks are diminished in
size, and increased in price ; whilst cottages not half large enough for a
single gentleman cannot be had under fourpence. Twists are found to be
exceedingly small, especially by those gentlemen who, from the bracing
effects of the sea-air, have twists of their own remarkably large. Donkeys
have riz awfully, and shrimps have become lobsters—in price. Bathing
machines are now the same as glass-coaches, and if you want a dip, you
can't get over head and ears under a shilling. At the libraries literature
is on the advance. “ The price of Fame” is up to 6d. a volume, and the
“Life of Jack Sheppard” is so dear that it can only be looked upon as
a perfect robbery.
Everything is high down at the Devil's Dyke--so high that it ought to
be a “ celestial Paradise.” Notwithstanding the cold weather, the flies
have come out, and are sticking it into all the visitors.
The livery stable keepers are driving a very good trade with gigs,
which go off at an unprecedented rate, and sea-side horsemanship is az

A NEW MANIA
Has bitten the industriously-idle ladies of England. To enable a large
wager to be gained, they have been indefatigable in their endeavours to
collect old penny stamps ; in fact, they betray more anxiety to treasure up
Queen's heads, than Harry the Eighth did to get rid of them. Colonel
Sibthorpe, whose matchless genius we have so often admired, sends us the
following poem upon the prevailing epidemic :-
When was a folly so pestilent hit upon,
As folks running mad to collect every spit upon
Post-office stamp that's been soild and been writ upon ?
Oh for Swift! such a suhject his spleen to emit upon.
'Tis said that some fool in mustachios has split upon

To avoid loss and debt,
Half the town as collectors, to waste time and wit upon,
Bothering and forcing their friends to submit, upon
Pain of displeasure
To fill a peck measure
With the coveted treasure
Of as many old stamps as perforce can be lit upon,
To paper a room, or stuff cushions to sit upon.
Do, dearest Punch, lut fly a sharp skit upon
This new pursuit, and an ass's head fit

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Norma made Easy.--Act. II.
Scene I.-NORMA's DWELLING—a glance slight and cursory
Informs us at once that the room is the nursery.
On one side a couch, where the children repose,
Without any featherbed, mattress, or clothes,
But as they a bolster or pillow require,
One end of the couch than the other is higher.
The infants are sleeping, contented and good,
On a property bedstead, with bedding of wood.
Enter Norma, who carries in one hand a lamp,
Of the well-known theatrical butter-boat stamp;
While just at her waist, and her girdle within,
Is seen a bright dagger of double block tin !
She goes to the bed, and around it while walking
Is heard to herself to be earnestly talking:-
Eur
But now to poor Norma again we return :
She enters, and hears that her lover dared spurn
The overtures made in her favour ; and so
She gives to the gong a most vigorous blow.
The chorus surprised by the terrible din,
To know what's the matter come hastily in ;
She tells them the time for the battle is near,
And bids them get ready the sword and the spear.
A noise then is heard, it is Pollio caught
By the Druids, and now in safe custody brought.
His life is demanded-at once he declares
To his blood they are perfectly welcome-'tis theirs.
Says Norma, “ I'll shed it myself.” “Oh,” says he,
“It's you, is it, Norma ?” “Ay, Norma,” says she.
She holds up the knife, but she falters, and so
She begs most politely the Druids will go.
They do so. Her victim she eagerly views,
And then a duetto between them ensues ;-
She says she alone can at liberty set him,
Then tries by a promise of pardon, to get hinn
Her rival to fly from. Her offer he spurns.
To rage and vexation her pity then turns ;
She threatens—not only himself, but the children
She says she'll destroy in her frenzy bewilderin':
Besides Adalgisa—her heart seems quite set
On taking the lives of the hateful quartette.
But knowing that business, ('tis always confest)
When done by one's self will be managed the best,
He asks for the dagger—the desperate elf-
To do-like a single young man—for himself.
She summons the Druids ; then, oh, what a row;
She tells them a priestess has broken her vow.
He begs her to turn not a common informer.
The name is demanded ; she gives it—“'Tis Norma !"
Of course, when he finds on the pile she must burn,
His love in an instant begins to return.
He says he has wrong'd her; and curses his fate,
As heroes of operas will—when too late.
She pleads for her children ; but no one knows why :
Oroceso turns glumpy and swears they shall die,
Which causes poor Norma to hang on the skirt
Of the obstinate fellow's white calico shirt ;
A measure that never yet fail'd to assuage
The hardest of fathers—at least on the stage.
To the funeral pile the unfortunates turn,
Where, as the book tells us, together they burn.
Some spirits of wine on some fire they throw,
Which causes a glare, and lights up the TABLEAU.
Oroceso has fainted; for fathers whose hearts
Have been nothing but stones through the whole of their parts
Get soft as wet sponges, and tenderly cry,
Whenever the fall of the curtain is nigh.
The opera is finish’d; and Cooper comes out,
To be met, as he knows, by a general shout
For Adelaide Kemble : then Cooper retires
Like a bit of machinery hung upon wires.
And Mister Charles Mathews, whom gallantry bids
To sport every evening a clean pair of kids,
Comes forth ready dress’d for the arduous part
Of leading Miss Kemble ; who presses her heart,
And seizes a bouquet, on which she bestows
Many kisses, as sideways with Mathews she goes.
Miss Rainforth is afterwards lustily bawld for ;
The rest, like dead letters, are waiting till callid for.”

PAINFUL SUSPENSE.
1
“They slumber," says she, “and their eyes being slut,
They 'll know nothing on't when their weazands are cut !
But no !-they're my darlings; and what have they done?
They are his !-that's enough, so I'll cut, and then run.”
She raises the dagger, but then it occurs
To her mind, all at once, that the children are hers.
She fondles, embraces, and fervently blesses them ;
She hugs, she hangs over, and wildly caresses them,
Then summons Clotilda, by calling out “Ho, there!
As the coal-heaver, shooting a sack, cries—“Below, there!”
Clotilda comes in-Adelgisa announces,
And like a smart maid-servant out again bounces.
Then Norma, whose views are decidedly sinister,
An oath very solemn begins to administer
To fair Adelgisa, who, fearing to brave it,
Objects not to join the proposed affidavit.
The terms of the oath very clearly imply,
That Norma herself shall be suffer'd to die;
While her friend Adalgisa she begs will fulfil
The part of executrix to her last will,
And bring up the children—a charge that the other
Would find very likely a bit of a bother,
She therefore declines it, but says that soon speeding
To Pollio she will for Norma be pleading.
The priestess demurs : they join issue ; but, lo !
Poor Norma withdraws the record that said “ No"
To the offer just made. To the front they then get,
And warble together the well-known duet.
There over the lamps, with the gas turn'd on high,
They swear that “ together they'll live—they will die.”
SCENE II. is a landscape where Druids appear,
For no other purpose but vengeance to swear ;-
They seem in a terrible passion : they shout,
And awfully flourish their costume about ;
Which has an effect that is somewhat sublime,
For their thirty white nightgowns are shaken in time.
SCENE III. is the last—'tis a temple : there hangs
In the midst such a gong as the charlatan bangs
When he lets out his audience, bidding them go
To tell how they've been entertain'd at his show.
And then if they try to expose what is wrong,
Their voices he drowns with his thundering gong.

about and talking at and to each other without any earthly object or pur-
pose-individuals devoid of individuality; for though meant as specimens
of particular classes, they are like nothing but absurdity, of which they
are true embodiments. Their creators, knowing little of the classes they
pretend to paint, draw upon their ignorance for the outline and filling up,
and on their imagination for the truth and nature of their portraits. Hence
the origin of such comedies as “Marriage " and the “ Irish Heiress ;"
the authors of which pretend to represent the actions and feelings of
persons who move in what is called good society. Their dramatis persone
are vastly genteel the ver; aristocracy of stagers ; they all wear kid gloves,
and talk about their carriages and horses ;—whilst, to throw an air of
reality over the scene, with which the authors fail to invest the characters,
the managers engage upholsterers to decorate the stage, and real servants
to teach the supernumeraries the art of handing a letter to a master or a
mistress.* Few under the rank of baronets are admitted as principal
characters, and they never go below a valet for their low comedy.
Yet, alas, though the externals of high life are rigidly aped, yet the lord
is too often infinitely more vulgar than his footman, and the man far more
like a gentleman than the master ; because the dramatist, whatever his
tact or talent may be as such, is profoundly ignorant of the originals he
tries to copy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO HER MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT.
WE have received a letter from our esteemed friend the PosTMASTER-GENERAL, complaining of the sudden and
enormous increase in the duties of his office consequent upon the publication of our last Number. With every
respect for the present Government, we must confess that we did not think there was so much ingratitude existing
in St. Martin's-le-Grand.
Punch’s VALENTINES did not emanate from mercenary motives, but were designed in the purest spirit of patriotism.
We sought not to ensnare the idle threepences of our fellowmen; but, knowing the financial fix of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, we were determined to supply the two or three millions' deficiency in the revenue. We know we
have succeeded; and our indignation is only equalled by that of Bryant, who, instead of meeting with so illiberal a
return, modestly expected to be presented with the next vacant garter. Catch Punch saving his country again!

“ dry rubbish” which many others have
been unable to accomplish with good materials. But we are begin-
ning to anticipate ; and we must return to young Grunt, whom we
now find picking up the seeds of education (of which he has to this
hour retained the chaff) in a small seminary kept by an old woman
who divided her time between Mavor and her mangle, and submitting
alternately both linen and learning to the mangling process.
It was here that young Grunt first imbibed the predilection he has
since so strongly manifested of combining occupations contradictory
to each other; and as his early (we believe his only) instructor did
before him, he to this day unites two trades; for he professes in-
struction, while he practises mangling in every volume that he
publishes.
Having missed young Grunt for a series of years (for there are no
memorials of his career since he was seen carrying home the clothes
for his schoolmistress in the little village that gave him his birth (and
nothing else), we find him all at once taking a glass of porter at the
bar of a London tavern, in the company of a printer's devil attached
to one of the morning newspapers. Again we lose sight of him, till
we detect him in a garret in the New Cut; and here he enjoyed
for some time the confidence of his landlady; for he was four
weeks in arrear with the rent of his lodging. Grunt now began
to feel the ground under his feet (for his shoes were sadly
in want of soles; and, taking courage, he tasked his vigorous

A RAILWAY SLEEPER.
We read in the newspapers that “ a man was fined 20s. for proceeding
further on the railway than he had paid for. He fell asleep, according to
his own account, and when he reached London he had no money to pay
for the additional fare.” Now we call this too bad! No railway can go
on without its sleepers; and we think it something beyond a “fare ” im-
position that a gentleman, because he happened to be in the train, should
be charged for sleeping faster than he ought to have done. Doubtless

imagination for a flight in the regions of fiction, which he
enclosed anonymously to the editor of The Cab, a halfpenny peri-
odical then enjoying considerable credit—from the printer and sta-
tioner. The Cab was at that time edited by a gentleman who has
never since been heard of, and thus the literary aspirations of the
ambitious Grunt were overwhelmed in an instant, for his contribution
never appeared, nor did the work he sent it to, nor did its editor.
Balked in his efforts, the enterprising Thomas repaired to the Frog
and Feathers, the landlord of which knew something of him, and
good-humouredly consoled him by chalking out what for the last
month he had been chalking-in, and told him to pursue the path that
was open-a recommendation he accompanied by pointing to the
door, through which Grunt withdrew in a mood of exceeding dole-
fulness.
We now lose sight of our hero for many months, and meet with
him at last in Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials, where we find
him installed at the head of the literary department of the toy and
marble warehouse presided over by the well-known Mr. Pitts, who
retains for him to this day a strong and disinterested friendship.

For envious time has o'er them thrown
The gloom by which they now are shaded
A gloom that was not once their own.

Their day is past, their beauty blighted-

Alas ! how lapse of years can sever
Things that were firmly, closely knit ;
And unions that should last for ever
Are in one fatal moment split.
But how dares man-himself deluding,
Indulge in wild and happy dreams?
All things must part—(I'm now alluding
To my old coat—that's burst its seams).

That love or friendship has bestow'd,

A new writ was moved for, for Petticoat-lane, the late member having
entered into the service of the government, by assisting to turn the wheel
at Brixton.
Ben Bolt attended to take the oaths and his seat; but finding his seat
occupied by some one else, he hastily took the oaths and retired.
David Dumps had been requested by the landlord of the house in which
they were then assembled to bring in a bill, which he now begged to lay
on the table. It related chiefly to beer and spirits, but there was a clause
on the subject of tobacco, and another touching broken glass, which he
thought should have been kept separate.

Simon Snooks observed that with regard to the beer and spirits, he had
great reason to complain of the measure, and as to the broken glass, he
thought a select committee ought to sit upon it.

Emperor requested the Princess to try whether the bell had the same

when suddenly the doors were thrown open, and all the old and faithful
servants to whom she had bid adieu, and who she thought were then in the

A very pretty book might be written, illustrative of the “ Sensibility

surely find a fitting corner. What a butter-hearted emperor! Soft,
gentle, kind-hearted Nicholas ; how has Rumour, that foul-mouthed

“even to the most minute details of footstools” busies itself, to give
another joy! And then the delicate incident worthy of a Russian
fairy-if there be such things—of the "silver bell." How many
stories have been told of NICHOLAS—how many slanderous lies of his

heart, flung themselves beneath the wheels of the waggons loaded with
their children, doomed by the imperial kidnapper to Siberian wastes !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UR announcement of last week has created a sensation beyond our expectations or
desires. We are aware of our own powers of astonishing the natives, and conse-
quently are unwilling to appropriate any excitement which is legitimately the
property of another. Punch, therefore, begs to assure his Subscribers that the
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER which he promises in futuro will

Nobody dreams of a puncheon,
Where sweet Punch is eating his luncheon,
With his nosegay and holyday hunch on,
He has laid by his cap and his truncheon.
A change in the dream-PUNCH doth spectacles don,
And Judy is putting the tea-kettle on;
Letters are scatter'd all over the place,
For Judy has thrown them in poor Punch's face.
And PUNCH, in a passion, says, “ Toby or no Toby,
Judy, I'll send you a letter from Nobody."
Nobody, sure, dreams of loving me so,
And dreams are not always “contrary, you know."
VALENTINE.
I have lately discover'd the reason, dear PUNCH,
That the ladies to thee are so kind;
They dote on thy nosegay at breakfast or lunch,
Though thou'st worn the same time out of mind.
And if thou, dear Punchey, could sport one no more,
In honour so gracefully carried before ;
To hear it, dame Judy may scold as she will,
Nobody ever could love Punchey still.
The Chancellor's nosegay is nothing to thine,
And thy nosegay, remember, beloved PUNCH, is mine,
So to Nobody Punchey will be Valentine.

Of course you'll be my Valentine;

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT.
The Premier, in rising to explain his financial views, declared that
there was a horrible deficiency. The expenses had been great and
the revenue was contemptible in the extreme ; for the average of the
last quarter had been truly pitiful. (Hear.) He should, however, look
the crisis boldly in the face ; for the only way to get rid of an evil
was to stare it out of countenance. (Cheers.) He should not propose
a loan ; not because he objected to loans, but because he had nothing
upon which he could raise a shilling. (Ironical cheers from the Opposition,
followed by counter cheers from the Ministerial benches.) Finding things in
this state, he felt the necessity of looking round him—(hear)—and he

he intended that the moon should have been represented. In the corner
is a small spaniel, with an expression of hilarity in its countenance, and
near it is a dish, to which the appearance of motion is clearly given; while
a spoon lies undisturbed in the centre. Beneath the hieroglyphic are the
following mystic words :-

In looking at this distich, the first line which we modernise for conve-
nience into high diddle diddle, strikes us at once as the old mystic exor-
dium with which the bards of old were accustomed to commence their
incantations. It was thought peculiarly appropriate to prophecies, for it
implies a high degree of diddle, which was always the agent of the
soothsayer.
The next line, “The cat and the fiddle," has puzzled the antiquary
perhaps more than anything else ; but as fiddle-strings were made of cat-
gut, and prophets, who were also bards, generally accompanied their pre-
dictions by touching a few notes on the violin, the apparent mystery is at
once accounted for. “ The cow jumped over the moon," brings us at
once to the earthquake, which is the subject of the present article. The

ATROCIOUS IMPOSITION ON THE PUBLIC.
POLYGLOT IDIOTISMS; OR, MIRTH FROM OUR MORTAR.

It having been announced in the Harleian Manuscripts that a grand
exhibition would take place on Wednesday last, in which the City of
London was to act a principal part-assisted by St. Paul's, Westminster
Abbey, Waterloo Bridge, the common sewers, and a select portion of the
suburbs-a vast concourse of people assembled at Windsor, Richmond,
Primrose Hill, &c., to view the entertainment at a distance.
The preparations made in anticipation of this grand event exceeded the
most extensive of any former public occasion. Amateurs in earthquakes
assembled from every quarter of the globe to witness the magnificent
spectacle, and places at the top of the Monument were let at a high
premium. Innumerable spring-vans were, for weeks before, actively
employed in removing all descriptions of goods from town to country, lest,
in the enormous swallow which was to take place, the mahogany tables,
coal-scuttles, and toasting-forks, might cause a fit of indigestion in the
“ bowels of the earth.” Geological speculation was carried to an unpre-
cedented height, or rather depth ; and parties of pleasure-chiefly con-
sisting of members of “the British Association for the Advancement of
Science "-were formed, to visit the primary formations, and even the
antipodes, and their exiled friends in Botany Bay—if they could get there.
The Lord Mayor, to be on a level with the scientific world, and to pre-
vent confusion, made admirable arrangements for the sinking of the City.

MR. WILSON AND SCOTTISH MUSIC.
The rage for foreign music has at length extended
to the ditties of the Land o' Cakes, and the Store-
street Rooms are crowded every Monday night to
hear Mr. Wilson sing them. As yet, however, the
taste has not gone very far beyond the emigrants
from Scotland, for the chief part of the crowd con-
sists of the light-haired, the high cheek-boned, and
the occasional utterers of such plaudits as, eexcel-
lent!” “verra gude !" &c.
The lecturer gives a narrative of the adventures
of the Pretender, and sings the most popular songs
that were composed when the freaks of that French-
Scotch madcap were occupying public attention. To
judge from the effect produced upon Mr. Wilson's
auditors, these ballads must have been of good ser-
vice to “Charlie," for the ecstacies some of them
caused were not at all sparingly expressed. Besides
the exclamations before-mentioned, the clattering of
feet and thumping of umbrellas were sometimes
deafening.
If, then, such effects were produced upon the
sober-minded listeners of Monday, what prodigies of
sympathy must they not have created in the hearts
of the clansmen when they fought at Preston-pans,
and when they ran away from Derby? Every note
must have struck upon their ears like the thump
of a broadsword; every bar stimulated their desires

the extreme ; an entire bunch of greens was tied up in his hat-band; and
Richard Lalor Shiel, on the other hand, was as tiny as himself. In the
upper house, only one peer in the first instance exhibited the national sym-

PUNCH'S PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY.
I.
Introductory.
Come along, old fellow; follow me, as a friend, from the midnight streets :
Leave awhile the cold and muddy Strand, to loiter in the tavern of the Coal-
Hole.
Come into this quiet box, with hot-water in a batter'd pewter jug
Over whose beer-stain'd table are strewn many particles of crust;
Here, upon this wooden peg, hang up thy hat and Chesterfield,
Order a pint of stout, or go of grog, and rest for half-an-hour.
.
The money-taker's box is not in the style of Wren; but taking a
bird's-eye view of the architecture of the place reminds us of the
houses of pigeon, or pigeon-houses, of which there are some fine spe-
cimens in many parts of the kingdom. The building is sufficiently
capacious to enable a short individual to get in, but the architect does
not appear to have allowed for an occasional inclination to turn round
and get out again. The roof, which is somewhat in the form of a
cone, will allow a short person to stand up, if he keeps his head with
mathematical precision exactly in the centre. Taller individuals
find it more convenient to rest their chests on the little door which
runs half way up the building, and to place their heads outside, so
that those taking an asce
scending direction are pretty sure to meet
those of individuals coming hastily round the corner, and they are
thus reminded of the necessity for taking a check and paying the
fare at the money-taker's station.
We now come to the waiting-room itself, which is an irregular
building, of greater length than breadth, having an opening at one
end to let people in, and an opening at the other end to let people
out again. The walls are of solid half-inch deal, nailed stoutly
together, and painted after designs by a plumber and glazier in the
neighbourhood.

A PLATED WAITER.
Behold! I would stop a short time in this buzzing crowd of visitors,
Though wrapp'd up in a Mackintosh, yet are the seams and pockets pervious ;
But into the foam of this goodly glass I dip my beak,
And receive its contents as nectar ; yet the tap is Barclay's.
Under its cheerful influence I shall, before long, get loquacious,
And mingle the fashion of my speech with froth-built snatches of philosophy!
II.

The exterior is of a delicate slate colour, picked out with the
concussions of steamers, and filled in again with putty. But it
is the interior to which our description particularly refers, and
to this we will confine ourselves, as we have often done in a
shower of rain. On one side is a bench, and as the building is ne-
cessarily dark, the person who enters, catching a glimpse of people
sitting down closely together on one side, will naturally go to sit
down on the other, but as there is no accommodations, the result is
often awkward. As far as the eye can reach, which is about one
yard at each end (for there is no window, and the light is admitted
by the openings at the two extremities), are instructive and amusing
documents announcing the fares, the stations, and the hours of
starting of the steamboats of the company. Until very recently
there was a bill of Vauxhall-Gardens, but the destructive spirit
of renovation has besmeared it over with whitewash. The curious
in these matters can, however, still trace many of the words beneath
the unseemly coating.
Of Gifts.
I had a seeming friend :-I gave him a licking—he was gone :
I had an open enemy :-I stood a pint-and won him !
Common friends require presents ;-monkeys, more kicks than halfpence ;
But the scorn of any one melteth at a barrel of Quin's oysters.
A foe may get spiteful, and incline to call thee a humbug,
But send him a turbot, and he saith,—“He is a good fellow, after all !"
Policemen will not oft refuse a drain, if absent the inspector;
And policemen's friendship should be courted in the event of rows.
The larker, held by the collar, may be released by half-a-crown,
And thy own bed is better than the stone sofas of a station-house,
Or, being James Edwards, compell’d to call thyself John Brown.
There is not one crusher who is proof against the waistcoat pocket;
And the same font of happiness bath even power over reporters.
* saw a beggar in St. Giles's, and another beggar punch'd his head,
For the first had collected more coppers at his crossing than the other ;
His broom fell into the mud, and he swore an oath.
Anon a baked potatoe man came up, with a high-pressure can,
And gave him of his store : the first beggar was grateful;
He, poor stricken cadger, pick'd up his broom with a curse,
And, turning to the potatoe man, ask'd what he would take to drink.---

PUNCH'S DOSSAY PORTRAITS.

ABOVE THE COMMON RANK.
We regret to say that this tenderness on the part of our Colonel
was not felt at home, and the ass passed into the hands of strangers.
Every attempt of the Colonel to trace the whereabout of his early
friend and companion proved fruitless. · However, that Colonel
SIBTHORP has never forgotten the ass, is sufficiently evident from all
his speeches, both in and out of Parliament.
On the day of the opening of the present session Sir ROBERT PEEL
-ever anxious to encourage the manufactures of his country-pur-
chased, for eighteenpence, of a Jew in Parliament-street, a pocket-
book bound in green morocco. Placing the purchase in his poke,
Sir ROBERT bent his way to the House of Commons. He had scarcely
reached the lobby, when SIBTHORP, as though touched by some magic
influence, rushed into the arms of the premier, who from that time has
never been able wholly to relieve himself of the caresses of the Colonel.
It has long been evident to every one that the member for Lincoln is suf-
fering under some strange, some powerful fascination. We have disco-
vered the cause. The Pocket-Book! In the article sold by the Jew to Sir
ROBERT are sundry leaves of ass's skin ; yea, leaves of the very hide

a brother nigger that “neider so like bote dat's twite un possible to tell toder from

ABOUT TO HAVE HER FORTUNE TOLD. *

Don't cut the cards, for that fashion is gone away
Of telling one's fortunes, my pretty Loo Conoway ;
Pitch Zadkiel and Co. to the Lady of Babylon,
Take luck as it comes, let them chatter and gabble on,
Whether niany more winters are granted by Jupiter,
Or if this be the last one to hoist up your Blue Peter.
Which roaring away, in by no means the dumbest fone,
Dashes Tuscany's waves on her mountains of pumice-stone,
Toss off your liquor, and that brevi spatio. †

If I ask'd her-'Where now is the gim of the say?'
In a huff she'd cry out—'Get you down to your tay:
Don't you know 'tis ould Ireland ?—and that for the sake
Of the maly potato--Sir VALENTINE BLAKE.'
" Where's the hoighth of good spaking ?-I lave it to that,
Who tumble down tropes and upset figures flat ?-
'Tis ourselves—the ould Irish- they fed us in youth
With the flowery potatoes beflowering our tooth,
So the flowers of ould Roth’ric are ours-ours alone-
And, sure, we may do what we like with our own.

* This little poem will be found to bear some similarity to the eleventh ode of the
first book of Horace, which is addressed to a young lady of the same name, only
differently spelt, viz., Leuconoe, which runs as follows:-
AD LEUCONOEN.
Tu ne quæsieris, scire nefas ! quem mihi, quem tibi,
Finem di dederint, Leuconoë; Deu Babylonios
Tentaris numeros. Ut melius, quidquit erit, pati!
Seu plures hyemes, seu tribuit Jupiter ultimam,
Quæ nunc oppositis debilitat pumicibus mare
Tyrrhenum, sapias, vina liques, et spatio brevi
Spem longam reseces. Dum loquimur, fugerit invida
tas. Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero.
+ As the lines are at present pointed, they will not exactly hear this transla-
tion, but it is far more poetical to advise the lady to toss off the glass at once, than
to tell her that she is doomed to but a brief space of life. The haste with which it is
recommended her to seize rather the goods the gods provide, is of itself a suffi.
cient hint that she has no time to lose.
“ The Castle of Blarney-oh, many a kiss
Have I stolen from its stone for wife, widow, and Miss :
And I bathed in the Shannon, no blush can you trace,
Or any one else, on the hide of my face.
But unless on potatoes you always will live,
No virtue the stone, or the river can give ;
And your second-hand blarney an't worth half a shake :-
So stick close to the food of Sir VALENTINE BLAKE.

“There was Lord Castlereagh, who, as well as his wife,
Was as handsome a man as you'd see in your life ;
But no babbies they had, and it plagued him full sore
When he saw a poor woman with brats half a score.
Could you tell me,' said he,' how you got them, good dame?'
Norry curtsied, and said, 'Tis the praties we blame.'
My lord,' whisper'd my lady, .our dinner we'll make
On potatoes :'"-said (winking) Sir VALENTINE BLAKE.
“So bere put an end to this bother and botch-
Leave barley to brewers, and oats to the Scotch ;
Let wheat on its scale go to skate and to slide;
Would you please all your men, and your women beside ?

And with corn I am sure you wont set it again.
So having concluded, my bow I will make-

Most rooms appropriated by the kindness of hospital governors to
house-surgeons, are very much alike ; we may say (for the benefit of
those who have passed their Latin), ex uno disce omnes.
The apart-
ment has an odour of tobacco, the furniture is fashionable, inasmuch
as it is remarkably old, and the paper is of that elaborate pattern,
which you see stamped before your eyes in the window of a shop in
St. Giles, and afterwards labelled “three farthings ;" additionally
ornamented on each side of the fire-place by legends, inscriptions,
and diverting diagrams, in pencil. When any house-surgeon of
former times possessed a diamond ring, which appears to have been
by no means a common occurrence, he signed his name therewith
amongst the archives of the window panes ; if he were not addicted
to jewellery, he simply cut his initials upon the panels of the shutters
with a scalpel. Aged men with grey hair, who have been attached as
messengers to the hospital for the last sixty years, speak vaguely of
persons coming to whitewash the ceiling, and paint the wainscoat
when they were boys ; but these traditions are ascribed more to the
garrulity of age than the remembrance of such a proceeding having
actually occurred.

EXTRAORDINARY INQUEST.
At his grand wedding show,
Many ages ago,
The tears of Xarifa for dashing Andalla ran;
But never, oh! never,
Did bright Guadalquiver
Turn out such a hero as Hector O'Halloran !
VII.
An unfortunate man was found dead with a copy of Punch in his hand.
It was proved that he had been reading a Number of that publication,
when he was seized with a fit of laughter, followed by a splitting of the
sides, which soon terminated fatally. Medical aid was immediately called
in, and the sufferer was wrapped in sheets of the Morning Herald, which
are generally recommended in such cases as equal to wet blankets ; but
the unhappy subscriber gave bis last laugh, and expired with a convulsive
grin upon every feature. A long investigation took place as to the treat-
ment the patient had been submitted to, and the coroner thought that if
the application of the Herald had been earlier, it might have saved the
man's life ; while some of the jurors seemed to think, that if the particu.
lar Number resorted to was one in which Grandmama had been pathetic
on the Income Tax, strong hysterics and violent cachinnatory exhaustion
must have ensued rapidly. The jury, after an hour's deliberation, re.
turned a verdict of Justifiable Split-the-side, with a deodand of three-
pence on the Number of Punch that occasioned the accident,

culiarly low arch of Westminster Bridge, my old enemy gave me such a
twinge, and my elephantiacal symptoms became so intolerable, that I lite-
tally screamed with agony. Along the river, as far as Vauxhall, I was
greatly relieved ; and though I had apprehended a repetition of the attack
at the bridge, the convenient height of the arches enabled me to go through
without any other manifestation of indisposition than a suppressed groan ;
and by the time we neared the pier I was decidedly better.
We now began to put on all our steam, and crowded every shovel of
coal, to get through the Reach, where the water is rendered rough by the
gravel junction of the two seas of Chel and Batter. The former gives its
name to the Reach, and the latter lends its appellation to the Rise ; for
Chelsea Reach and Battersea Rise are well known to the hardy mariner.
The waves in this part of the deep are at times remarkably high, and the
feet of our coxswain were repeatedly washed by the surge of a breaker.

fancy that he is being suffocated, for want of sufficient room to move and

would be needed for the accommodation of the ponderous but generous

pleasing harmony, that a considerable secretion of coagulated copper in

Twang that he scrubs the instrument he is so great a master of. We have
heard of the delicate touch of Hertz, but Twang's touch hurts more than
that of any other professor; for in his enthusiasm when playing an extem-
poraneous voluntary he is sure to break a string or two.
In private life he is much respected ; and though he professes some
contempt for the elaborate scores of Mozart and Beethoven, he always
bears in mind whatever score there may be against him -at any of the
houses he is in the habit of resorting to.

The Markets.
THERE was a good deal of liveliness in Hops, and a party of strangers,
who seemed to act together, took off the contents of all the pockets they
could lay hold of. There was little doing in corn, and what Barley came
in, was converted into barley-water for a large consumer. Peas were
distributed freely in small samples through the market, by means of tin
tubes ; and as usual there was a good deal of roguery in grain, which it
was found necessary to guard against.

The Times suggests “ as a curious subject of physiological inquiry,
what it can be that makes the whole House of Commons go off into violent
fits of laughter on the slightest mention of an ass—as if it were some
newly-discovered animal, which had never before entered their imagination
—some lusus nature—some startling and original phenomenon, as yet
unheard of within or without the walls of their house." Certainly an

THE BEAR AND THE PINE-APPLE;
A TRUE STORY, DEDICATED TO THOMAS WAKLEY, M.P.
An odd event occurred on the 6th instant at the Zoological Gardens. It
appears that a man had by some means obtained an engagement in the
establishment, and although utterly unacquainted with the habits of the
animals, was employed to dole out to them their requisite provisions. A
very choice monkey was taken ill, and refused to eat. It was thought,

ON THE GEOGRAPHY OF SEVEN DIALS.
SITUATED at the northern extremity of St. Martin's-lane, having
the Broker-row for its eastern, and Monmouth-street for its western
boundaries, in longitude nothing, and lat. 0° 5', is a singular conform-
ation of country, radiating from a common centre and an illuminated
clock, known—from the number of its rays—as “Seven Dials.”
These rays are formed by several habitations built of burnt bricks
and mortar in regular rows, or streets, all diverging from the above-
named apex.
The geology of this district is peculiar. The superficial strata con-
sist of granite rhomboids placed closely together, the whole forming
a compact surface, or carriage-way. On each side is a smoother
formation of flags, which, from their worn appearance, are sup-
posed to be those which“ braved a thousand years."
In the department of Natural History, Seven Dials is peculiarly
productive. Dogs, cats, and a great variety of insects, together with
donkeys, abound. The last are used for conveying from one part of
the district to another the vegetable productions which form a large
article of import from Covent Garden-market. The indigenous vege-
tation consists of boxes of mignonette, picturesquely laid out on the
window-sills ; together with large quantities of mustard and cress,
cleverly grown upon flannel in exposed situations. Cabbage-leaves
are thickly sown in every gutter.
The trade of Seven Dials is extensive, it being the entrepôt for glass
bottles, rags, old iron, left-off clothing, and second-hand tooth-
brushes. An enlarged commerce is also carried on in lollypops, and
other sweet articles affecting the Colonial sugar-markets.

This magnificent pile of building was erected some years back in
Rupert-street, and still stands a memorable monument of the per-
fection to which the honest sons of the hod have carried the useful
art of bricklaying.
The progress of this celebrated structure was rather curious, and
the mind is literally overwhelmed by contemplating the irresistible

The floor is entirely laid down in the centre with a strip of strong
oil-cloth, and the seats are surmounted with rich remnants of cheap
but choice carpeting. In the centre of the ceiling is a chandelier,
and on the chimney-piece is a small wine-glass liberally stocked with
toothpicks.
Some of the most distinguished characters of the present day are
said to have been frequenters of these rooms during the early part of
their career; and we could point to a well-known repetiteur in the
band of one of our theatres, who, in company with the now very emi-
nent flute who occupies at this moment a stool in a well-known
orchestra, always, when he dined at all, went through that interesting
but somewhat expensive ceremony at the rooms in Rupert-street.
The waiter takes a melancholy pleasure in pointing out the vacant
seat of the famous repetiteur ; and indeed the spot is generally to be
distinguished by an inverted tumbler, which James affectionately
places every day exactly in front of the seat that his late exalted cus-
tomer was wont to occupy.

uninitiated persons might imagine it the destined seat of royalty ; but one
glance at the bristling and revolving chevaux de frise through which

The site upon which this edifice was raised was originally a deep and
stagnant bog. The peculiarities of the foundation seem manifested in the
superstructure ; as its inhabitants, like the passengers over the old sur-
face, generally stick in the mud, and remain there much longer than they
expected.
In some few cases, a process, as it were, of "man-draining” is resorted
to; this is excessively expensive, and, like pumping a

very generally requires unpleasant repetitions.

Although the proximity of the timber-yard furnishes board ad libitum
to all who may require it, yet the general arrangements of the establish-
ment do not allow of cooking ; so the majority of the lodgers dine at their

THE BRIDGES,
WESTMINSTER BRIDGE is a remarkable structure ; for it has been tumb-
ling to pieces ever since it was originally built : and it is a singular fact,
that as soon as one arch is rendered safe, another is discovered to be
dangerous. Though it is difficult for horses to ascend one side, the incon-
venience is overbalanced by the rapidity with which they are hurried down

The Western Exchange is principally used as a short-cut from Bond-
street to the Burlington Arcade, in wet weather; and is chiefly celebrated
for the extreme difficulty encountered in finding out the entrance from the
latter place, which is most ingeniously concealed, to puzzle novices and
afford a little harmless perplexity, in a pastry-cook's shop.
The Pantheon is also a thoroughfare from Oxford-street to Marlborough
do., and is mostly frequented by governesses with their charges, and
lovers of zoology. At one extremity is a conservatory of unknown plants,
and evergreen shrubs, occasionally disposed of to horticulturists who are
equally so; and a fountain and basin, filled with what are presumed at
first sight to be live red herrings, but which prove to be gold fish upon
close examination. There is also an excellent gallery of perpetual pictures

STEAM BOATS.
It is,-according to Malthus, and to a higher authority, Alderman
Lucas,-to the over population of this country that we are indebted for
its present depressed condition. Of the numerous remedies applicable to
the evil, none have been found so effectual as Steam-boats; and, although
their superiority over the small-pox and rail-roads has been disputed, yet,
from the increased favour in which, every succeeding season, they are
held, as engines of destruction, it is clear that the highest opinion is
entertained of their efficacy.
In proof of this, the stranger has only to trust himself on board a six-
penny Gravesend boat on a fine Whit-Sunday. The deck crammed, and
no standing-room on the paddle-boxes, he will be wedged in by the crowd
so tightly as to preclude the use of his limbs when the accident, whieh is
sure to occur, takes place. Exactly at the moment of the start, an op-
position boat will also set off, so that the speed will be deliciously ex-
hilarating. In trying to give “Bugsby hole" as narrow a berth as

PUNCH'S STRANGERS GUIDE
TO
THE METROPOLIS,
On passing the frontier which separates the Rookery from Oxford-
street, an examination of personal baggage frequently takes place by
expert persons brought up to the business from infancy. Crossing Oxford-
street you arrive on the opposite side of the way, leaving behind you the
things you have passed.
At this point of your peregrinations you may possibly discover that you
have lost your pocket-handkerchief; and it will
be advisable, therefore, to seize the person in
closest proximity to you. As he will be certain
not to be the thief, you will most probably be
knocked into the gutter ; and upon calling for a
policeman will find yourself given into custody on
a charge of assault and attempted highway robbery. Your next destination
will then be a station-house, where you will be conducted to your chamber,
and lighted to a bench, by a policeman with a bull's-eye lantern, and the
best thing you can do will be to go to sleep-if you can.

prepared a few placards, in which he boldly announced " Ease and
Comfort in Shaving,” his energetic mind at once fixed upon a penny
as the figure at which the operation could be performed; and, with a
decision worthy of Napoleon, he determined to cut and curl for
three-pence; which was one penny lower than a rival, who promised

Singe's style of lathering has been the subject of much remark ;
and it has been asserted that he introduces more soap into the mouth
than is absolutely necessary ; but it should be remembered that
boldness must be sacrificed, if every minute corner were to be
turned by the brush, and it is always in the power of the customer to
close his lips, which would prevent the possibility of accident. In
his style of shaving, the delicate certainly gives way to the forcible;
but when it is remembered how rigid are the materials with which
he has to deal, (for the majority of his customers have beards of a
week's growth,) it will not seem surprising that he should display a
roughness appropriate to what he is dealing with. His curling is of
the stiff, rather than of the graceful order; and his hair-cutting is
distinguished by its decision, rather than its tastefulness.

A GREAT deal was done yesterday in shares, but prices were
nominal. The West of England United Warming-Pan and Anti-
Rheumatic Company's scrip was freely offered at a considerable dis-
count; and a single share in the Anti-monopoly Match and Lucifer
Association was purchased, without the coupon, for a mere trifle. A
plan is talked about for putting London under cover in rainy weather ;
and a party is in treaty with the trustees of St.Paul's Cathedral, for the
purpose of ascertaining the practicability of erecting a large umbrella
on the top of the dome, which is to be put up in the event of a
shower, and is to be so constructed as to protect from wet the whole
of the Metropolis. It is expected that the suburbs (which would, in
all probability, be inundated by the drippings) will protest against
the plan ; but individual interests must of course give way to general
convenience.

so successfully showed the master manufacturers of England to be cheats,

of Heligoland, -has cheered the heart of every honest man, and delighted
the bosoms of the great family of Respectables.

which assembles every day to witness his performance, must rank
among the most hardy acts of martial prowess. We defy even the

THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY.
THE VICES OF THE POOR.

ܪ
M
This learned body met at the rooms of the President, and after par-
taking of a déjeuner à la congou, repaired to the back premises for the
purpose of inspecting the treasures of the dust-hole. This rich mine of
geological lore was first approached by the Secretary, who withdrew the
lid, and a sort of atmospheric phenomenon was immediately observed, for
the air within a circle of a few
feet was suddenly filled with ashy particles.
The Society now formed itself in a body round the interesting spot, and
the President, having been previously provided with a hooky stick, began
to disturb the upper stratum. It consisted chiefly of cinders, such as are
to be seen in the neighbourhood of Mount Vesuvius ; but a good deal of
vegetable matter was found within a few inches of the surface. On
getting lower down, a hard substance offered some resistance, and a
veteran geologist, who has made numerous personal sacrifices to science,
plunged in his arm, and brought up a piece of slate, of rather irregular
form, which became immediately an object of intense interest. It was
generally believed to have been introduced to the position where it was
found as a portion of the ashes from the kitchen fire; and the conclusion
was immediately deduced, that it was an experiment of the coal.merchant-
a profound geologist no doubt, who was desirous of witnessing the com-
bination of slate and carbon. There was also discovered a tertiary
deposit of potato peelings, which were scarcely altered in their appearance
by having been so long embedded in the soil ; and one of the Society
placed a portion in his mouth, with the laudable view of ascertaining
whether the vegetable deposit had entirely lost its original flavour. His
report was, however, not very satisfactory.

These poor are all a shocking set,
And given to every vice,
In spite of our societies
To make them good and wise.
There's Lady Censurelove and I
Do nothing, I am sure,
From morn till night, but talk about
The vices of the poor.
II.
Fashions for May.
In the early part of the month (including only the three first
days) artificial flowers will be very much worn, and an entire suit of
evergreens will be occasionally met with. The gentlemen will wear
cocked hats, with a garniture of gold paper, and tassels of the same,
while the coats, of which the prevailing colour is likely to be black,
will be striped with bright yellow. The ladies will wear low-necked
muslin dresses, with a head-dress of blue or pink gauze ; and golden
ladles will be seen, though it will be usual to hold a coloured hand-
kerchief in the hand, as a relief to the brilliancy of the basting
spoon. The above fashions will be observed at every matinée dan-
sante that takes place within the three first days of the month, and
it is expected that they will be much followed.
In the course of the month Taglionis will still be seen, but they
will be thrown back off the chest ; and an air of lightness will be
obtained by leaving off the waistcoat. White trousers will be the
same as last year, but many of them will be seen with false hems,
by which' greater length is obtained ; and a military effect will be
achieved by letting out the seams, which will form a sort of stripe
down the leg, and combine ornament with convenience.
In some instances there will be an abrupt transition from bear.

And very apt to imitate

Then what extravagance we seo
In hamlets and in towns,
One can but wonder how they dare

lovely form of an innocent woman. The scenes, too, are similar ; as the
downfall of the Trojans is represented by the ruin of their city, so the

ROEBUCK'S PURGE.
EFFICACIOUS as the Reform Bill has proved in the promotion of bribery,
some improvements are, it is said, in course of suggestion by the recent
Election Committees. It has come out in evidence, that a shameful pre-
ference has in many instances been shown to some honest and independent
voters over others—one receiving as much as twenty pounds for his suf-
frage, while a neighbour is palmed off with not more than three or four.
To remedy this flagrant and disgusting partiality, “ Your Committees
recommend that future elections take place at the Auction Mart, and that
Mr. George Robins be appointed returning officer for the whole of the
United Kingdom ; each borough to be knocked down to the best bidder,
and the proceeds equitably divided amongst its constituency:
The excellence of this plan will soon have to be extensively tested ; the
honourable Member for Bath intending, we hear, to extend his researches
not only to Harwich, Nottingham, Penryn, Falmouth, Reading, and
Lewes, (which incompatible seats will soon become vacant,) but to the
whole House. Now if bribery is to unseat a Member, and if, as he has
declared, the man of Bath persevere in his exposures, his efforts will
assuredly end in a dissolution of Parliament. We wish Roebuck's purge
better success than Russell's met with ; for it is nonsense to talk of repre-
senting the people, the numerous cases of “personation” at the poll fully
proving the people are quite capable of representing one another. No ;
property is the thmg to be represented ; and this will
never be adequately
done till Parliament gets into the hands of the capitalists.
INCOME TAX.
MR. BULL is always grumbling. Ministers are like the drummer-boy, flog where
they will he is never pleased. Think of his grumbling at the Income Tax,--that
beautiful tax,—which no one will pay without grieving that he has no more to pay ;,

of those artless beings who are induced to take the shops in it.
The idea of this arcade was, no doubt, taken from the celebrated
Grotto of Posilippo, near Naples, which is a long dark passage, cut
through a rock ; and the dead wall of the Opera House presenting a
grand and gloomy appearance, probably suggested the happy notion
of placing some dwellings immediately under it, and converting the
whole into a commodious vault, for the convenience of those persons
who like the amusement of keeping shops, but are averse to the
trouble of having to attend to them.

The Opera Arcade is approached either from Pall Mall or Charles
Street, and is in the rear of Her Majesty's Theatre, one of the walls
of which has been ingeniously taken advantage of in order to intro-
duce the uprights, beams, and hold-fasts which constitute the strength
ofthe structure that forms the subject of our present Interior. One
side is perfectly flat, and though this evenness of surface does not
exist in the shops, the perfect flatness of the occupants entirely makes
up for any irregularity in their tenements. The roof is of a concave
form, and keeps up the happy idea of a vault, though the character
of the building has been in some degree interfered with by injudi-
cious openings, which let in here and there a few mouthfuls of air,
and a few eyefuls of light, though not sufficiently to disturb the
mournful solemnity of the structure.
It is the merry month of May-
The jocund bee proclaims the spring-
The verdant fields give hopes of hay-
The house-fly now is on the wing.
Nature puts on her summer suit
Of green, turn'd up with skies of blue,
But I still wear (unhappy brute !)
My ponderous Petersham surTOUT.
The nettle now puts forth its charms;
The thistle tempts the patient ass ;
Black beetles walk about in swarms,
And from the kitchens upward pass.
All living things are blithe and glad,
While basking in the sunny noons,
But I with heat am almost mad,
In my thick Tweedish pantaloons.
What shall I do? where shall I go ?
The world is far too gay for me ;
But for the shilling that I owe,
I'd to the Crown, and have some tea.
But yet I will not quite despair :
One consolation still is mine,
For o'en in summer I can wear
My gossamer—my four-and-nine !

PROLOGUE TO “LUTHER.”
BY BOB HUMDRUMMERY.
FOLLOWING SUIT.
When I first came to town, an ingenuous youth,
I met Captain Snooks—soul of honour and truth!--
A Captain of Austrian Jäger-Marines,
And the nearest relation of Baron Von Beans.
The frogs on his coat seem'd with glory to glister;
A gentle ferocity lurk'd in his whisker;
I saw, and I trusted—our friendship begun,
And I lent him ten pounds—the Unprincipled One!
A day or two after, he drew me aside,
And begg'd I would always take him for my guide;
He talk'd of the dangers that threaten the young,
And how he by ingratitude base had been stung ;
And bade me subscribe to a Joint-Stock concern,
For extracting the very best port out of fern.
Just conceive my amazement when told-I was done,
And that he was a cheat-the Unprincipled One !
Having taken alarm, but not courage, I went
To demand what this very odd history meant ;
But he twisted his cane with a furious twirl,
And he gave his mustachios a terrible curl,
And he mutter'd I could not make out what he said,
But something that sounded like_“Blood must be shed
The rash fool--but I fear that the thing must be done,”—
Till I shook in my shoes—the Unprincipled One!
But hark ! in the street- there's a pickpocket caught,
And the nuob for his angry invectives care nought :
" What ! a Captain of Austrian Jäger-Marines,
And the nearest relation of Baron Von Beans,
To be huddled to quod by a parcel of beaks !"
u Come, you're sartainly book’d, my old boy, for some weeks
Ve knows yer—why, bless me! as sure as a gun,
It must be—it is—the Unprincipled One!"
Non omnis moriar.-HOR.
Go,* for you know me, I am he
That sang of Satan's Majesty,
An Epic twelve books long ;
And onward persevering still,
I drain my ink and wear my quill,
On many a weary song.
I may be read, or I may not,
I take my chance—the poet's lot,
And bear it very well :
Then, why should I give up the trade
While trunks are lined and pastry made,
I'm sure to live and sell !

PUNCH'S DOSSAY PORTRAITS.–No. 6.
Jarvis can satisfy a crowded buss that one or two more will cause no in-
convenience, ranks among the highest efforts of persuasive eloquence ;
and the insinuating style of his inimitable “It's a lady," when he has
received a remonstrance for thrusting a fat woman on to the laps of four-
teen stifled beings packed closely together in the Dog-days, can only be
conceived by those who recollect the thrilling effect produced by Mr.
T. P. Cooke when, as a British tar, he denounces the “lubberly loblolly-
boy who could see a woman in distress and not place the last shot in his
locker at her disposal, or protect her with the latest gasp of his breath
and the last blow of his marling-spike."
It is another great point in the character of Jarvis, that he never
acknowledges any place to which the omnibus of which he is the conductor
is not immediately going. By these means persons going to Kensington
have the opportunity of visiting the pleasant little village of Brompton,
when there is an agreeable walk over a fertile district, across which Jarvis
politely points, with a delicate intimation that there lies the way of the
passenger. In the same manner, an individual going to the Elephant and
Castle is treated to a view of some of the finest thoroughfares in London,
and having glanced at the Bank, he has a salubrious walk over London
Bridge in store for him-after having, of course, seen considerably more
than he could have done had he been conveyed at once to the Elephant.
The deep, sonorous voice of Jarvis also contributes greatly to his pro-
fessional success ; for his “ Bank, Bank,” is so beautifully indistinct, that
it conveys to every one a sound which is easily mistaken for the name of
the particular place he is desirous of going to.
MR. GROOM’S TULIP SHOW.
Punch returns his thanks to Mr. Groom ; he was very much pleased
with his floral blaze. However, shall we have no place—no spot-free
from the dirt and blight of politics? Why, Mr, Groom, why introduce the
spleen of party among the innocent beauties of creation? Why should
the caterpillar of politics drag its foul slime across the satin glories of the
tulip? Our friend, The Times, observes :-“Some of these tulips are
unique in shape, colour, and feathering: they have almost the appearance
Sitio
of being painted by the hand, so accurately and evenly are the divisions
of the tints. It is quite true that nothing is like the pencilling of nature,
and in these superb flowers it is illustrated beyond contradiction ; yet it
is also true that here nature comes so close to art in regularity and pre-
cision of design, that it would seem she had borrowed, and indeed im-
proved by her intimacy with her copyist."
The Times affects an ignorance of the fact; but art has been wickedly
industrious among Mr. Groom's tulips. The Times proceeds :-“Some

in this suggestion by a reference to an old superstition, as to cattle

very little doubt that the old expression “ Heads you lose, tails I win,”

MAN PLEASES NOT ME,"
says the melancholy Dane-which may be looked upon, by itself, as a
moral reflection, expressive of dissatisfaction with his species; but
the beautiful addition “nor woman either,” shows at once that it is to
the game we are speaking of that Hamlet's thoughts are wandering.
If the Prince of Denmark did not allude to Heads and Tails, but
intended to express distaste for his species, he would have stopped
at the words “ Man pleases not me," but the melancholy addition
nor woman either," coupled with the laughter of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, who had probably often tossed up with the Prince in
gayer hours, at once fixes the expression in the sense we have
endeavoured to give it. It is probably upon this line in “Hamlet”
that the general notion is founded, of the impossibility of making
either “ head or tail” of the Prince of Denmark's character.
The modern game is of an instructive and healthy tendency, which
causes us to regret that it should not be more general than it is at
present. It w' still played to a great extent by a wandering tribe of
piemen and the bold suburban youth, who are very skilful in its prac-
tice. It is also often indulged in on the pleasant margin of the
Serpentine river, by a hardy race of travellers, who deal in what they
describe as brandy-balls, and reap in the bathing season a very plenti-
ful harvest.
MR. EVERTON'S STUDIO.
This talented artist, who has lately removed the whole of his works
now in progress to his new studio in Oakley-street, has just completed the
casting of a colossal sucking-pig (the matériel is the same as that used for
Everton toffee), intended, with the concurrence of Government, to be pre-
sented to the infant Prince on his birthday. The artist has been most
felicitous in the undertaking; he has imparted a classical appearance to
the pig by enveloping him in a napkin, which forms the drapery and is
made subservient to effect ; the disposition of the trotters, the anatomical
proportion, and contour of shape, are all preserved, and shown either
beneath or through the napkin; the air is firm and noble-decisive, but
not obstinate ; and the snout is dignified without asperity. As a whole, it
far surpasses any like work of art.
Old Time had worked too sluggishly
That feast to furnish forth,
So Art had, like a robber, forced
Her riches from tho EARTH.
The hungry man gazed wistfully;
How throb’d his bursting heart !
As thus he spake, “ Oh that my child

A high-born dame, in purple dress'd,
Paused where the Pauper stood,
She raised a morsel to her lips,
Then left the dainty food.
“ Would I might taste !" the poor wretch criod,
"And then I should not die."
The dame passed on; her rustling silk
Seemed like a mourner's cry.
The pageant passed—the poonday's sun
Shone on the revellers' sleep,
It glared into the poor inan's room-
His slumber was more deep.
The noble, on his bed of down,
With damask was o'erspread;
The pauper's only swathing was
The core-cloth of the dead.

There is a cowardice of property which prompts many a well-

with their doors on the latch. But then the people about her are
poor, and she has we know not how many guineas-hoarded in her

PUNCH'S ANCIENT COSTUMES.
from his supposed propensity to quizzing ; but we think we have got
a leaf of an old parchment table-book somewhere, that gives quite
another version of this old and incredible story. Raleigh, it is true,
entered England (after his celebrated excursion a few miles beyond
the Downs, which was then called "going round the world”) in
company with a distinguished Irishman of the name of Murphy,
whom he probably introduced to his own circle; and this has ludi-
crously been perverted into a story that Raleigh first introduced the
Potato-meaning the Murphy—into this country.
The costume of the Baked Tatur Man is, in the highest degree,
characteristic of the period. It is loose, like the morality of the
age; and flowing, like the verse of the great poets who ennobled it.
From the short dumpy features of the face, we should say that the
Saxons were the first who took up taturs and baked them, with an
eye to trade; but Gutlum, or Guzzleum the Goth, is known to have
sent ont emissaries by night, disguised as tatur-men, who, under the
shadow of their cans, were enabled to watch the movements of the
enemy. It will be seen that the Baked Tatur Man of the fourteenth
is evidently the ancestor of the Baked Tatur Man of the nineteenth
century. The same indifference to the public gaze, and watchful
interest in the state of the public appetite are powerfully charac-
teristic of both ; while there is a mixture of bluntness and bonhomie
in both, which the reader cannot fail to recognise. The following
legend on the subject of Potatoes is so pleasant and appropriate, that
we cannot help quoting it. Upon looking again at the legend, we
find it neither so pleasant nor appropriate as it at first appeared ;
and we, therefore, make no apology for omitting it.

the cut of its costume. Upon undertaking the difficult task of illus-

POLYTECHNIC POETRY.
We have received numerous letters calling our attention to the effusions

And once again I saw his shape
When rising from the tank ;
He climbed the ladder dripping wet-
His hair was dank and lank.
But when at last he was assured
That there was no one near,
He shrunk behind the air-pump stand,
And took a drain of beer.

Yet again I see him quaff,

Perch yourself upon the plank,
And we'll dive a fathom down
In the deep, deep tank.
In the deep, deep tank,

There are seats enough to spare,
No rough waves your nerves to shock;
And should you want more air,
You must give " a double knock."
And gold and silver fish
You'll encounter on your way;

Ah! how can young sweethearts lounge,
In the galleries above;

TUESDAY.—Mr. Jones's tripe réunion, at Whetstone Park.
WEDNESDAY.—Mr. Baron Nathan's last ball at Kennington. It is
particularly requested that the ticket entitling the holder to a sandwich
may be given up when the sandwich is delivered.
THURSDAY.-
Mr. Seedy's petite diner at Cann's soup establishment.
Friday.—Duke Humphry's grand entertainment in Red Lion-square.
SATURDAY.--A public breakfast under the Piazzas at Covent-garden.
Coffee will be on table at half-past three, A.M., precisely.
FURTHER ARRANGEMENTS.
MONDAY WEEK.—We understand that this day has been selected for
the long talked of marriage between Dashwould Diaper, Esquire, of
Waterloo House, and Miss Susannah Simper, one of the lovely and
accomplished young ladies of the same fashionable establishment. We
have been favoured with a sight of the trousseau, which comprises a
tasteful selection from the last year's stock of soiled and damaged articles.
The bride will be given away by the cashier, and as the present is the
busiest part of the season, the happy couple are expected to spend the
whole of the honeymoon behind the counter.
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
mc,
We have heard a whisper of a party of antiquarians having associated
for the patriotic purpose of purchasing Aldgate Pump, with a view to bringing
out an illuminated history of that well-known but somewhat unappreciated
object. The Pump itself appears externally nothing remarkable ; but anti-
quarian research, it is expected, will invest it with startling interest. The
spout, when properly inspected and regarded in the most striking point of
view, is capable of throwing a light on many important points of civic his-
tory; and there is no doubt that if the subject is carefully worked out, and
elaborated with that patience which antiquarians know so well how to
bestow, the topic will be one of rather an exciting character. It is to be
hoped that the corporation to whom the Pump belongs will place no ob-
stacle in the way of this great national design, which may be greatly
damped if any handle is made use of for throwing cold water upon the zeal
of the parties alluded to.

(One of diver's' lays.)
Alr of course anticipated by the title, so there is no occasion to put it.
He wore a suit of Moses',
When first at morn we met ;
'Twas ten o'clock-the visitors
Had not assembled yet.
His high-lows were eight shilling ones,
His voice assumed the tone
Of one to whom both wet and coids
Were intimately known.
I saw him just, yet back again
My mind bis image brings,
As he swept the upper gallery,
And dusted the queer things.

SECURING A HAPPY OLD AGE.

When next we met, he wore ;
He songht the bottom of the tank,
And walked about the floor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ANCIENT COSTUMES.
There is an old pint pot in the British Museum, with the device of an
elephant with a castle on its back, which clearly shows that the Indians
-the most ancient nation of the world—were in the habit of using
pots ; and from this it may be inferred, that Pot-boys are at least os
ancient as the pots themselves, though we have no direct proof of it.
The Pot-boy cf the fourteenth century was remarkable for the
chasteness of his costume; and the short tunic of linsey-wolsey, aided
by the leathern Catharini, or buskins-which some have interpreted
as buckskins-gave him a very classical aspect. The cry of “ Beer"
is as old as the Curfew; and indeed is one of the few remnants of
the good old times, which, thanks to a spirit of restless innovation,
are still left to us. We never see a Pot-boy in his daily round, but
we are strongly reminded of the beautiful line in the Latin grammar,
which so strikingly introduces the word “pot" in (as an auctioneer
would see) at least three places : “Utpote Mars potitur. Nos te pote-
remur Ædille.” This triple allusion to pot, places pots and Pot-boys
in a very proud position; and having got them into this position, we
think it best to take leave of them.

ENTOMOLOGICAL NOTICE FOR THE MONTH OF MAY.
This is a busy month for the entomologist. At its immediate com-
mencement, the Sweeps make their appearance in every variety of colour ;
the head and thorax, however, are the same in all specimens, being of a
dusty brown ; the antenna are long, but vary extremely-some are
feathers of a dirty white colour, others darker, and of a deep orange.
Marbled Whites are numerous in the neighbourhood of the Seven Dials,
and are easily captured. Blues of all descriptions come out in small
coteries ; some of a large size are to be found, of an afternoon, near the
Horse Guards, especially in the enclosure of the Park. Towards evening,
Painted Ladies are numerous, and fall an easy prey to any one inclined
to pursue them. The Common White abounds in the neighbourhood of
Chalk Farm and Primrose Hill. The Caterpillar not unfrequently makes
its appearance at dinner time, especially in early Spring cabbages.
Browns are generally scarce ; nor are Coppers, large or small, often seen
flying about in this or any other season. Red Admirals are very rare ;
one specimen was discovered in Portland Place last summer, but has not
been heard of since. Of the Lepidoptera, Cats are very numerous; they
abound on the tiles of almost every house. Towards the close of the
month, there will be some good sport on Epsom Downs; many of the
Hawk tribe will be found about the young sprigs, Melanoscella also, in
any part of the course ; but they must be secured on the wing, as they
very seldom settle. Lastly, let the young entomologist never go out on
an excursion without having, first of all, borrowed the salt-box.

SONGS OF THE SEEDY.-No. 12.
Oh ! think not my trousers were always as bad
As these at this moment upon me you see,
For age on their beauty has influence had-
Time whitens not only the head but the knee.
Then turn not aside with derision and scorn;
They're seedy, I own, both behind and before :
Like the heart of the wearer, 'tis true they are torn-
Like his bosom they've suffer'd full many a gore.
THE POT-BOY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.
It is a remarkable trait in the English character, that there is a
strong disposition to attach an idea of an appropriate age to certain
pursuits; and the generic terms of " man," “ boy,” “ woman,” “ girl,"
have become identified with a variety of callings, without respect to
the age of the individuals pursuing them. Hence we have “post-
boys" who have devoted half-a-century to their exciting occupation;
and “ Pot-boys” who have nothing of the “ boy" about them but the
appellation.
The carrying out of beer is a very ancient practice, and dates as
far back as the earliest origin of the custom alluded to. We have
seen in a private collection a manuscript poem with the quaint title
of “ A Rhapsody on Pots and Pot-boys,” in which the author makes
some fanciful allusions to beer in the olden time, and to the modern
practice of having it in your own jugs,” which the writer greatly
disapproves, and he very happily applies the fine Shaksperian ex-
pression, “ Jug me no jugs," which is a truly Elizabethan slap at the
senseless innovation. Porter in the “pewter” has long been a theme
of adoration with
“ Savage, saint, and sage;"
for the dustman, the methodist, and the wise man, are all of them
equally addicted to drinking the delicious beverage in vessels made
of the metal we have mentioned.
The first direct allusion to Pot-boys, properly so called, is to be
found in Shakspeare's “ Richard the Third," where persons are said
to enter, “ carrying King Henry's bier” (vulgo, beer); and as his
“ beer” is subsequently ordered to Whitefriars," there is no doubt
that there was at one time a royal retreat in that now populous
neighbourhood.
Having traced the Pot-boy back into a remote period, and having
succeeded in winding him up with rich historical recollections, we
soon bring him, by easy stages, into the fourteenth century, in which
our art
as placed him.
“But never despair," says the confident sage,
And I, even I, am encouraged to hope ;
For I found by the paper's advertisement page
There's something still left us on earth, besides soap.
Yes, here is the balsam that gladdens my eye-
Oh! can the alluring announcement be true?'
A patent reviver—a species of dye
Which makes an old coat look quite equal to new!
Oh, wly in the world should we further go on,
When the lights are all out that illumined our way ?
When the tailors who trusted are bankrupts and gone,
And cold ones insist upon punctual pay ?
No, rather the garments I have I'll still wear,
Than ask of the “cold ones a boon they'd deny ;
They will not give credit !-at once I'll repair
To the mart for the patent reviver--and dye !

PUNCH'S PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY.
CHARLEY-MAGNE.
SONGS OF THE SEEDY.-No. 13,
A very interesting meeting of the Practical Association of Paro-
chial Philosophers took place in the long room of the Pig and
Parallax, on Monday last, and several curious experiments were
successfully resorted to.
The President opened the proceedings of the evening with a few
remarks on compasses, and gave a curious specimen of the compass
of his own voice by singing a stave which went from B in the bass to
C in the treble.
A member of the association having called for a bottle of ginger beer,
proceeded to go through the following curious operation, which kept the
room in a state of breathless attention throughout the entire process.
He first divided, with a common penknife, the lateral ligatures that
secured the cork, an operation that was performed with so much
nicety as to elicit loud applause from all present. He next applied
a degree of pressure to that portion of the cork which rose above the
neck of the bottle, and having carefully continued this process so as
to have embraced the cork at every point of its diameter, he suddenly
applied the palm of his hand with considerable violence to the bottom
of the bottle, when a curious result presented itself. The cork flew
with a loud explosion into the eye of a member who was watching
the scene with interest, and a light (frothy liquid streamed with
considerable violence into the face of the President. The operator
then drained the bottle into a glass and swallowed the contents
as speedily as possible.
The most interesting part of this proceeding consisted, however,
in the description of the sensations experienced by those who took
أن
A PROFESSOR OF THE BLACK ART.
I passed along a narrow street,
Upon my ear a deep voice fell-

part in it.
And must it be? must I submit
The early friend of other days—
The unexceptionable fit
That all who envied still would praise.
Must T allow my old Nugee
That made me once the beau-the thing,
Expos'd in a Jow's shop to be,
Or at his dirty door to swing.
The gentleman who received the cork in his eye, and still holding
his handkerchief over the organ alluded to, gave the following very
graphic particulars : “ After seeing the operator strike the bottom of
the bottle with his hand, I felt a smart blow, which appeared to
affect at once the brow, the lash, the pupil, and the ball of my left
eye, when, from sympathy, my other eye immediately closed (hear,
hear.) It then struck me (loud cheers) that there was a smart pain in
my left organ of vision, and there was a sort of flashing sensation in
the part affected, that was exceedingly interesting, and in the highest
degree curious. Having placed my pocket-handkerchief over my
eye, I found that on opening the right I could perceive surrounding
objects; but on withdrawing the protection from the left eye, it
seemed to open and close with a rapidity, that is very aptly described
as being like winking. For a few moments I experienced an un-
pleasant sensation, but ultimately the organ resumed its ordinary
functions.” The honourable member was loudly cheered at the
conclusion of his explanation.
The President, on being called upon, briefly remarked that he had
heard an explosion, and felt his face suddenly suffused with a cold
decoction; and having put out his tongue, he ascertained that “the
mixture” bore a sweet, and, at the same time, an acid character.
He confessed that he felt no peculiar impulse, unless it were to try
the effect of the bottle itself upon the head of the gentleman who
had occasioned the combination of the contents with the cutaneous
covering of his (the President's) countenance. (Ilear, hear.)
The meeting was kept up till a late hour ; and the members
eventually became so heated by the liquor that was introduced for
the purpose of sustaining their philosophic energies, that some very
powerful experiments were ultimately resorted to. Among other
things it was ascertained beyond doubt that the human head is capa-
ble of resisting the pressure of a pint-pot, brought down at an angle
of 56, with the arm of an individual opposite ; but it was observed,
as a curious result, that instead of the superficial plane of the skull
showing any indentation, it invariably gave symptoms of having
sensibly risen on the part with which the metal had come in contact.
Forbid it, Stultz—but oh ! 'tis vain,
The son of Israel lures me in,
The monster racks my tortured brain-
He mutters that the cloth is thin-
“Shee dare," the ruthless villain cries,
And bids me mark the wbiten'd seam,
“ Dish has been pieced-why plesh ma eyes,
“ 'Tis quitesh worn out." Is this a dream ?
Hark! in the idiom of his race,
He offers—what ?--a poor half-crown.
I throw a dagger in his face-
Of course I mean to say I frown.
I snatch it from his eager hand-
The fiend perceives I will not sell,
And hooting till I reach the Strand,
I hear him “ Carsh the seedy svell."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ANCIENT COSTUMES.
A SUMMER AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE.
We left the White Bear on a beautiful afternoon in May, and
arrived on the very same afternoon of the same day of the same
month at Knightsbridge. We enjoyed the journey greatly, and were
much struck by the magnificent scenery on our right, which presents
a vast level of green, intersected here and there by roads, and
bounded by the buildings which break the uniformity of the horizon
of Bayswater.
We took with us no guide, preferring to trust to our own resources,
and arrived safely in Trevor-square, where we had taken a floor, the
front of which commanded a full view of the houses opposite, while
from the back, through a local chasm formed by an opening between
the houses, we were enabled to catch a glimpse of Smith and Baber's.
Having resolved on remaining at Knightsbridge the whole summer,
we were not much disappointed at the weather, which confined us to
our lodgings during the whole of May and a considerable portion of
June ; for having had the precaution to put a pack of cards amongst
our luggage, we found no difficulty in getting through our time with
“beggar my neighbour," “cribbage," and other games of a similarly
pleasing character.
Our dealings with the natives, however, enabled us to form some
idea of the manners and customs of the place; and we found that
there is a very curious superstition prevalent among some of the
tradesmen, that if their first week's bills are not paid by strangers, it
is better not to continue to supply them with articles. From this
senseless infatuation we were very near experiencing some inconve-
nience ; but a remittance from the exterior enabled us to set our-
selves right with the natives, and we afterwards went on with them
very pleasantly.
The month of August had commenced before we could carry into
full execution our grand project of seeing Knightsbridge ; but this we
ultimately accomplished, and we were fully repaid for our trouble.
We looked in vain for the Bridge of the Knight, which is believed
to have given its name to the place; and indeed, the “oldest inha-
bitant” had no recollection of either one or the other. As the foot-
path is greatly elevated above the road, it is not unlikely that an arm
of the Serpentine formerly ran along the latter ; and indeed, the de-
clivity from the park at the barrack-opening gives every credibility
to the ingenious hypothesis.
Presuming that there was at one time water, it is surely not a too
violent assumption to conclude that there was a bridge, and supposing
the bridge to have been in existence, why may not a Knight have
passed over it? This chain of reasoning, every link of which throws

WHEN I GET THE TIN!
(A LYRIC OF TON.)
“0, crams !” was the forcible observation of Mr. Manhug.
Fact, Sir, and no mistake. I was a pupil at the Brighton
Dispensary at that time, along with two very nice fellows now in
practice not a hundred miles from the Chain Pier; and we could n't
afford to do it properly, although we wanted to go, for it was a grand
affair.
“And how did you manage ?"
“We got towed by a country wagon up to Guilford, and then
crossed over Chobham Common, and got on the Heath the night be-
fore the race. We had a little table inside, and played whist and
smoked all night. The next day, when we dined we let down the
calash and fed under it. Uncommon good fun it was, too; and the
people who had n't been to the sea-side could n't exactly make it
out, and thought it was a show, which they tried to explore by
climbing up the wheels and looking in at the little windows, until we
closed the shutters."
And with the like diverting reminiscences they beguiled the
journey, until the train stopped at Slough, some forty minutes from
the time of starting.

Punch's Political Leader.
EARS PIERCED.
When we look at the state of the nation, and contemplate the
aspect of the political hemisphere, we are struck with the proud but
painful recollection that our country stands upon a pinnacle, while it
trembles on a pivot ; and that the very abyss into which it must
eventually fall, is deepened by the height of the rock it rests upon.
While the angry monster of despotism places his paralysing paw
upon the growth of liberty, we are startled by the humiliating con-
sciousness that our forefathers, who fought and bled for all that was
dear to them, have failed in securing for us the fruits of their valour
and energy. But in turning back our recollections to Cressy and to
Runnymede, we cannot help feeling our bosoms swell, and our faces
glow with emotion and with pride, for something whispers to us that
the land of a Hampden and a Pym can never be altogether deprived
of that halo which the spirits of the free are always sure to throw
upon the nation that gives birth to them.
We have thought it necessary to make these strong and stirring
observations, (in which every reader with a really English heart will
sympathise,) from having observed a dastardly attempt to increase
our local paving rate.
I MEAN to go to Ascot
Upon the Gold-cup day;
I'll sport a steed of gallant breed,
A chestnut or bright bay ;
Unless I join Sir Henry's set
(He said he'd take me in),
And to the stand drive four in hand,
Mum !-when I get the tin!
I'll ogle all the ladies,
And many a smiling eye,
From the grand stand, will light love's brand,
And look me sigh for sigh!
I'll bet against the favourite
(The second's sure to win);
With smiles and nods I'll take the odds,
Humph !-when I get the tin !
Some club of notoriety
Must have me for a member;
Where I may dine, and sip my wine,
In the dog-days, or November;
Address my card—have letters left
When Town begins to thin ;
And I resort to shoot and sport,
Humph when I get the tin !
DESERTING A PRINCIPAL.
An opera-box I'll occupy,
Where eyes and diamonds gleaming,
On a court night, make earth seem bright
As the heaven of poets' dreaming !
I'll visit soirée, ball, and rout,
My day with night begin ;-
Outshine them all at masque and ball,
That's—when I get the tin !
Already have a grasping and a garrulous oligarchy who bestride
the parish, in the same way as Cæsar was emphatically declared to
sit straddle-ways upon the world—already have (we repeat it
advisedly) a grasping and a garrulous oligarchy steeped us in
the bitter gall of taxation, almost to our very lips, when, with
an effrontery that has not been equalled since the days when it last
occurred, they come to our pockets for an additional rate, in order to
indulge their own predilection for wood, by using it for the purposes
of pavement.
When the ferocious foreigner forces his yoke on the necks of a
subjugated people, the burden must be sometimes borne, and the
cud, however bitter, must be thoroughly masticated. But domestic
tyrants are the least tolerable of all, for they plant the iron shank in
the heart as well as in the neck, and mingle the gall of regret with
the wormwood of slavery.
But we will not trust ourselves further on this exciting theme,
though it is only prudence stays our pen, for our heart could fill
columns with the honest outpourings of its indignation and its sorrow.
We quit the topic with a fervent wish that the people at large may
never know what it is to be placed at the mercy of the insolent and
ambitious oligarchy.
To some fair creature I'll propose
(Love's flame, why should I smother?)
With rosy blush, my fears she'll brush,
And sigh—" Go ask my nother !"
Objections will at first be raised,
She pines, grows pale, and thin-

chased one of “ Young's Patent Composing Machines, which he con-

And, when installed in wealth and ease,

No duns shall come, like sound of drum,
To thunder at my gate ;
My grey goose-quill I'll throw aside
That now my way must win,
For ah! I've swore, to write no more,
When once I get the tin !

Is the acme of Domestic Drama, and is nightly received by astonished
thousands with vehement delight, and a kind of Mount Vesuvius greeting,
that cannot be expressed in the English language. The deep bosom-felt
woes of Polly Plum, would almost draw tears from a hearth-stone, whilst
the honest and upright conduct of Peter, the errand-boy, cannot but
excite a strong sympathy for the deserving class of juvenile individuals,
of which he is at once the ornament and wonder. The scenery is almost
too natural. The beau idéal of a gooseberry bush in the third Act, has
been nightly vociferously applauded. The Manager has no alternative
but to announce it for representation every evening, for three years.

And the conjuror bows with aspect proud,

Some two hours afterwards, the hoofs of Jawbrahim's dromedary were

“ but massa, treasurer had a plenty of money, and him paid him poet, and
sent him about him business."
“ Did it weigh twenty guineas ?”
“O berry much more—him poem in two columns."
“ Two columns ? two volumes you mean, you black antigrammarian.”.
“Well, two bolumns two columns, two columns two bolumns, him all
de same.'
“How do you mean, ruffian ?" shrieked the monarch, when, with some
hesitation the negro handed him a paper, thus written :-
“SIRE -I acknowledge to have received from your treasurer, Cashee Beg,
the sum of two hundred and fifty-five billions four hundred and nineteen
thousand nine hundred and six tomauns, two rupees, and sixpence, being
the weight of my splendid epic poem, . The Descent into Jericho,' recited
to your Majesty last night.
“And lest, Sire, you should be astonished that such a sum should be paid
for a poem (for which, in fact, no money can pay), learn, that I had no
paper whatever to write (which would have rendered the bargain a much
cheaper one to your Majesty), but that I was compelled, at much pains,
to engrave my epic upon two pillars which I found in the ruins of Perse-
polis, and which now lie in your august treasury.
“I have the honour to be, Sire,
“ With the utmost respect,
“ Your Majesty's most faithful Servant,
“JAWBRAHIM-HERAWDEE SYNCRETEEK."
Fancy how poor Samboo Beg was bambooed that night! how the
treasurer was fustigated, how all the clerks of the treasury were horsed
and swished !-
But there is one in that multitude
Who does not join in their plaudits rude.
Like iron his face,
Upon it no trace
Of mirth, or wonder, or low grimace.
His glaring eye does he ever fis
On yonder row of candlesticks, —
And Döbler the great may vainly try,
For his birds may fly,
And his cards float by,
But he cannot stir that glassy eye.
Herr Döbler rends a rabbit in half,
And each balf is living,
And kicking and thriving,
But sonder grim stranger will not laugh.
Glaring still at the lights is he,
And he lowly murmurs : “One, two, three."
And the people near bim begin to shrink :
There is something rather queer, they think ;

GENERAL ALARM.
李​长大
​Perhaps it's Herr Döbler's familiar elf,
Perhaps it may be Old Nick himself.
Who is the stranger of mystic mien ?
Harsh sounds the stranger's voice, “Sixteen.”
Bottles change,
Kerchiefs range,
Hung with lockets,
Into pockets.
Döbler does such feats of wonder,
Plaudits sound like peals of thunder.
Anything like the rage of Poof-Allee was never known since the days
when Achilles Khan grew furious whilst laying siege to the town of Shah
Priam, As for Jawbrahim-Herawdee, he returned safely among the
Syncreteeks, and spent his money in publishing several immortal works
which have rendered his name beloved and celebrated; and never after
that did Poof-Allee-Shah pretend to be a man of letters, or try to swindle
poor literary gentlemen any more.
This story is taken from the ancient Chronicles, written in the Armenian
language, and sung by the shepherds of the Caucasus as they drive down
their flocks to water by the Red Sea. Praise be to Mahomet and the
twelve Imaums!
But that grave mysterious ONE,
Plaudits,-langhter, he has none.
What to bim aro magic tricks?
Low he murmurs : “ Thirty-six !"
And some feel a chill,
And grow rather ill;
They cannot bear that look so still.
And little boys shy,
And little girls cry,
For they feel pretty sure that “ Bogio" is by.
Who is the stranger that looks so straight?
The stranger murmurs : “Fifty-eight."
HERR DOBLER AND THE CANDLE-COUNTER.
A LEGEND OF ST. JAMES'St.
The curtain riscs—the stage is dark, -
The folks are silent all, when, hark !
A pistol sounds, and they start with fright,
And the row of candles is all alight.
illi
But that ere has lost its chilly glare,
And a flash of joy is sparkling there ;
And that iron brow is at last unbent,
And over those features plays mild content :
While, list !-through the crowd a whisper ran,
“ What joy has befallen the wondrous man?"
Silence at last the stranger breaks,
And thus in accents soft he speaks :-
“ Ladies and Genılemen,-past a doubt
I've found the august Herr Döbler out.
He tells us the candles he lights are two hundred-
And, Ladies and Gentlemen, greatly you'vo wondered.
But I stood alope,
I was not to be done ;
I counted the candles one by one,
And I swear by all the saints in hcaven,
The number of lights are but eighty-seven !"
HERR DÖBLER.
* The above legend is taken from a notice to correspondents, which appeared in
The Times of the 8th instant. By that it appears that a correspondent was disap-
pointed at finding Döbler, of St. James's, light only eighty-seven candles with a pistol,
when he had proposed to light two hundred.
