TO THE TWENTIETH VOLUME.
unch Has completed his TwentIETH VolumE, an event worthy of the Year
- that has seen the Crystal Palace.
w
Though the work already accomplished might fairly represent the labours of a life,
PUNCH is yet in his infancy; for having just completed twenty, he is now entering on twenty-one.
If the past has been but the promise of his youth, it may well be asked, with astonishment,
what will be the performance of his years of maturity ?
To the self-respecting People of England, with affectionate and admiring hearts now
mingling in amity and brotherhood with men of all climes in that Crystal Palace, PUNCH
offers his own Collection,-the accumulation of vast Intellectual Wealth, and the produce
of the richest Mines of Wit, brought together by the combined resources of Art and Industry.

iv. PREFACE.
As in the Great Hive to which the World's Bees have contributed their labours,
PUNCH has here concentrated the treasures of his own hive, in which, though there may
be a little taste of the sting, there is no lack of the honey.
His Exhibition has the same object in view as that now collected in the Crystal
Palace, to which he stood Sponsor, and gave the name,
THE ADVANCEMENT AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND,
{{[it] the 33race amb & Gobbyiſt of all flations.

JAN UAR Y.
In the beginning of the month old HyeMs
will give his annual series of snow-balls.
January is generally the coldest month in
the year, and the hedges are covered with a
frieze-work of a delicate texture.
Booksellers plant their annuals, and place
specimens under glass frames for forcing.
BALDERDASH FOR THE BALD.
If the growth of the hair is promoted by
Macassar, will an Anti-Macassar have a con-
trary effect?
Letters are paid for by the ounce, but an
unusually weighty announcement is not sub-
jected to an extra charge.
Where are we most likely to find the sky
blue? The nearer we go to the milky way.
Why is a man who has just carried his
carpet-bag on shore from a steam-boat like an
owner of the soil 2. Because he is possessed of
“landed property.”

THE HAYCOCKS are an old family in —shire. They boast of being
descendants of HEAGEAC, the Saxon, and have always hated the French.
The present MR. H. declares that it runs in the family. “I hate 'em, Sir, and
so did my father before me. Hang your foreigners, and foreign trade, and sour
wine and loose morals, Sir. Protection to British Industry, Sir, is my motto.”

“Let's have a play!" said Dick Chaffinch. The idea was embraced with
Alacrity. What was the play to be? Tom Heyday proposed a vaudeville, but old
Haycock, hearing the proposition, said “No!" in a tone that silenced Tom Hey-
Day for the day, and the snbject was not broached again.
Mr. Haycock, Sr.N., who had a traditional reverence for SHAksprans (whom
he spoke of generally as “Glorious Will," but never read), insisted on a play
of that well-known author. “Play Shakspeake, sir, that's English. Ah—I

January, 1851, was a great month at Haycock Hall. Tom HEYDAY, and young
SPATTER, of the Blues, and Dick CHAFFINCH, Fellow of All Souls, Barrister-at-
law, and the best shot, oarsman, cricketer, and rider of his time, at Oxford; and
old SIR Job Dolokum, the nearest great county man, with four Miss Dolphums,
and half-a-dozen besides, young and middle-aged, were staying in the house.

“distinguished man” of the party, set to work to study Mr. Ford, in a spirit
of tragic earnestness which was very refreshing.
The great Tudor Hall made a capital theatre, and the dresses in the old
“withdrawing room" formed quite a pretty picture. All the neighbourhood
was there; and the play would have gone off capitally, notwithstanding the

melancholy sedateness of the Mrs. Page, but for SPATTER, who had a taste for practical jokes,
and who put explosive mixtures into the fairies' candles, in the last scene, and generally
made himself so disagreeable, that he was voted a bore even by Tom HEYDAY, who looked
up to him a good deal, as belonging to the Household Troops, and having the privilege of
lounging out of the guard-room window at the Horse-Guards, and wearing a moustachio,
professionally and openly, and not by stealth as Toxt did, when he went abroad for his little
tours, cutting it off with much bitterness at Dover, for fear his father should see it, and cut
him off with a shilling.
The play was over, and the frost gave way, and the hounds met, and the ladies were left
in the morning-room to amuse themselves and each other, and amusing the Miss Dolphunts
was no joke. And even when the gentlemen returned, it was not much better. They sat over
their wine, and discussed the news of the day, and fell asleep on the sofa, after they joined
the ladies in the draw-
ing-room.

THE HAYCOCKS IN TOWN.
From MR. Haycock's Diary.
April 20th-Arrived at the Eastern Counties Station—after amiserable journey—no porters
of course—and had to stand :..". over luggage for an hour before cabs enough could be
procured. Got 'em at last, and drove to Heyday's, in Baker Street. Couldn't get up to the
door for cabs, setting down, loaded with all sorts of foreigners, in all sorts of ridiculous
travelling caps and cloaks. The lobby full of foreign luggage, and the housefull of foreign
men and women. MR HEYDAY, in a great state of indignation, and no wonder. That con-
fºunded son of his had asked everybody who had been civil to him, in his travels (old
HEYDAY has been ass enough to sº. the boy in running abroad on all occasions) to
come to his father's whenever they visited ndon. They have all visited London for this
Cock and Bull Exhibi-
tion, and they've all
come to his father's, of
course. Old Heyday
doesn't talk any foreign
lingo, and y course
couldn't explain mat-
ters; so the foreigners
had got themselves set-
tled, and the house is
full of them from area
to attic. I shan't stay

The reduction of the duty
on Conveyances does not
affect cabs or omnibuses.
The stamp on Indentures
of *...? depends
on the number of words, it
being thought that, between
master and servant, the
fewer words the better.
It is a doubtful point
whether a blind man could
be made liable for his bill,
payable at sight.
If you have endorsed a
bill, and a bailiff comes to
serve you with a writ, and
you kick him out, you make
him an endorsee, but you do
not get rid of your own
liability.
ExtRAoRDINARILY HIGH
TEMPERATURE.-The heat of
the weather is now so op-
pressive, that one feels that
there is even something re-

MEASURES OF TIME AND Motion.
The difference between these measures may be ascertained by taking a cab; when, if you
pay by time, the motion will be slow and the time long, but if you pay by distance, the motion
will be swift and the time short.

and BARON ESS Von STOLTz are here too. I do not like
the Baroness, who is a Russian, I think, and flirts
dreadfully with the men of all nations, in their own
languages. There is a Polish Colonel, who, the Count
tells me, is a spy. He is very observant. Three Turks
have just arrived, from Trebisond, where Tom HEYDAY
was, two years ago, and where these gentlemen saved
him from being bastinadoed, in a mistake. They don't
understand any language but their own, and naturally
are not conversible, but very handsome. They can't
eat anything that has been cooked by Christians, and
have been living for a month on bread and cheese. I
am afraid MR. HEYDAY is uncomfortable, rather, among
so many strangers, but I must say I like it exceed-
ingly. Papa is perfectly unapproachable, and was
pººl. rude to a poor dear Armenian Pappas (or
riest), who put his fingers into a dish of potatoes at
table to-day.

had a little quiet “punting.” I was in luck, and nearly
broke the bank. I give the Count and LEGINski their
revenge to-night.
From Miss HAycock's Diary.
The poor dear Count He has been compelled to
leave the Heyday's, from political reasons. That Pole
was a spy, it seems, and every action and word of the
Count's was denounced to the French Embassy. His
estates in Berry are confiscated, it seems, in conse-
quence of the part he was accused of taking in some
horrid revolution or other; and he is forced to undergo
the greatest privations, tººl. now, that every-
thing is so dear. But he bears up with wonderful
heroism, and even assists his poorer countrymen. I
would gladly aid him out of my allowance, but he won't
accept anything for himself. He occasionally receives
money, and even food, for his own unfortunate com-
patriotes. I literally forced a turkey upon him yester-
day, which came in the last hamper from the Hall.
He took it with the noblest simplicity; and when I
offered to have it sent by the man who sweeps the
crossing, and who is in our confidence, he said, in a way
that brought the tears into my eyes, “Je me dévoue
pour mesamis. Je m'empresse de leur porter demes propres
mains les secours de vºtre angélique bonté !" I took
down the words in my heart, and then he pressed my
hand. He wont even see my brother, such is his sen-
sitiveness. He fears offers of assistance.
From MR. HAycock's Diary.
It is as I suspected. That swindling French-
man is fed at my expense. The landlady saw

That it is necessary to defer the meaning of

That a young lady loses position if she is in

THE ROMANCE OF CHILDE JOHNSON IN
PURSUIT OF A PATENT.
HILDE JOHNSON was a venturous wight as ever bearded wizard,
Slew Giant, or drove trusty lance through Dragon's greedy gizzard;
The fairy, hight Invention, gave her Carine a certain treasure,
Which to maintain and guard, required a desperate kind of measure.
This was to seek a parchment stamped with signs of purport latent,
A magic scroll—a talisman—a thing yolept a Patent: .
To gain this prize a pilgrimage was doomed to be his portion,
Through Dens and &. of ñoguery and Castles of Extortion.
- CHILDE Johnsox braced his armour on with courage tough as leather,
- And gather'd all the means he could contrive to scrape together;
* - For well he knew that monsters would at every turn invade him,
To baulk his quest and ruin him, if he’d no purse to aid him.
To Chancery's Court of Cozemage first undauntedly, he hies him; . .
Aharpystraightswoops down on him—but that could scarce surprise him;
Chambers,
Foul vultures tear him at each step o'er which he creeps or clambers.
To Palace of the QUEEN or HEARTs has Johnson now to walkon;
Then, souse upon him, darts again Home Secretary Falcon.
He next to Ravens' Patent Nest in Lincoln's Inn proceeding,
Is seized by those rapacious birds, and undergoes more bleeding.
Once more to Crown-Attorney's Lair, and Secretary's º:
Fares this much-suffering favourite of Invention, crafty Fairy; -
Once more unto the QUEEN of HEARTs does sturdy Johnson wend him,
And hawk and wolf of Government anew attack and rend him.
The Signet's Hauntnext Johnson braves, where Griffinsgrim and savage,
Slaves to the monster Privy-Seal, the CHILDE despoil and ravage;
The Patent Ravens now again, with bill, and stamp, and docket,
Engrossings, fees, and recipes, come picking at his pocket.
The Rats and Mice of Hanaper, the various other Vermin
That nestle in the Woolsack and that hang about the Ermine, -
And sub-Chaff-Wax-and-Sealer-Fleas complete the spoliation, -
And Johnson drained well nigh to death comes out of his probation.
The CHILDE, in spite of Monster, Ogre, Cockatrice, and Dragon,
Has got the Patent Talisman—and much he has to brag on!
Sing, Ho for Johnson! gallant CHILDE, and persevering fighter-
The prize is gained—and Johnson is three hundred pounds the lighter.
Good luck to Johnson' may the palm so hardly won, avail him;
And, should his rights invaded be, his talisman ne'er fail him;
'Gainst wiles of legal conjurers may it prove a safe assurance
And not betray the CHILDE, at last, to Whitecross Street and durance!
Next journeying 'twixt Home Office Den and fell Crown Lawyer's

ments in the evening,
and at about 11 P.M.,
having forgotten his

temporarily admitted

by the proper authori-
ties.
MR. BRIEFLEss, fol-
lowing the fashion of
WN- the day, has been
—” giving some private
theatricals at , his
Chambers in the Temple. ... The entertainment consisted of a monopºlylogue, in which
MR. Brueriess sustained the characters of his own clerk and his laundress, the audience
being on the other side of the outer door, and listening to the performance through the
letterbox. Among the visiters we observed several of the learned gentleman's creditors,
including two or three of the most respectable tradesmen of the neighbourhood.
G. F. MUNTZ, ESQ., M.P., ON BLACKGUARDISM.
MR. MuNTz has written along letter to the Times, on the convertibility of the National
Debt into Bank-notes. It is well known that there are men º and men of gold;
we are only to be saved by papyrus from bankruptcy—we can only exist as an honourable
nation upon the precious metal! Marvellous is it, that the art of money—so necessary
to human doings—should not become a fixed science. With a principle as deep as
life, it would seem to partake of the mystery of being. We really know nothing about
it: the vital spark and the vital guinea appear alike to baffle research: all we knowis, their
inevitable importance. -
However, waiving a consideration of the subject of money, come we to one of those
profound discoveries—accidentally struck forth by Mr. MUNiz-like chance hits by the
alchemists. In conclusion, and touching his hat to the Times, the philosopher of
Birmingham says—
“Please to avoid blackguardism, or I shall soon convince you that I can call things by their right names
as well as anybody.”
Then why, in the name of that º that MR. MUNTz deprecates, why avoid black-
guardism; when blackguardism deals in the best and plainest utterance of truth? How
much of the evil and folly of life do we owe to verbal sophistication! What gainers
should we be by a daily handful of the salt of blackguardism? The blackguard—we mean
the MUTNz blackguard—is not a foul-lipped, irreverent brawler; but a ". straight-
forward, honest presence. He does not reek in an alley, but shares the well with Truth;
coming out of it, to speak clean honesty, by calling things by their right names;” and
not confounding meanness and rascality with any holiday alias soever. Therefore, more
blackguardism, Mr. MUNTz—more, and still more.
Financial Economy.
It is not often we are enabled to compliment the Government on any matter of economy,
but we think the plan it generally adopts of issuing medals for victories some twenty or
thirty years after they have taken place, is deserving of the very highest praise of every
financial economist. By the time they are issued, mine-tenths of the noble warriors who
contributed to the victories are dead, and, consequently, that is a saving of so many
medals to the Government. This economical plan, however admirable, is capable, we
think, of still greater improvement. Qnly let the issue be delayed some ten or twenty
years longer, and then no medals would be required at all, as there is not the slightest
doubt that, at that advanced period, not a single survivor of any, one of the victories,
which the medal was supposed to commemorate, would be in existence. The saving to
the Gºmment would be immense—not less, probably, than £200, or, perhaps, as much
as £300
THE YANKEE VOLUNTEERS.
“A Surgeon of the United States Army says, that, on
inquiring of the Captain of his Company, he found that nine-
tenths of the men had enlisted on account of some female diffi-
culty.”—Morning Paper.
YE Yankee volunteers!
It makes my bosom bleed
When Iyour story read
Though oft’tis told one.
So-in both hemispheres
The women are untrue,
And cruel in the New,
As in the Old one?
What!—in this company
Of sixty sons of MARs,
Who march 'neath Stripes and Stars,
With fife and horn,
Nine-tenths of all we see
Along the warlike line
Had but one cause to join
This Hope Forlorn.
Deserters from the realm
Where tyrant WENusreigns,
You slipped her wicked chains,
Fled and outram her.
And now, with sword and helm,
Together banded are
Beneath the Stripe and Star-
embroidered banner.
And is it so with all . .
The warriors ranged in line,
With lace bedizened fine
And swords gold-hilted—
You, lusty corporal
You, Colour-man who gripes
The flag of Stars and Stripes—
Has each been jilted
Come, each man of this line,
The privates strong and tall,
“The pioneers and all,”
The fifer nimble—
{º. Ensign,
aptain with epaulets,
And Blackythere, who beats
The clanging cymbal—
O cymbal-beating black,
us, as thou canst feel,
Was it some Lucy NEAL
Who caused thyruin?
O mimble fifing Jack,
And drummer making din
$o deftly on the skin,
With thyrat-tattooing.
Confess, ye volunteers,
Lieutenant and Ensign,
And Captain of the line,
As bold as Roman—
Confess, ye grenadiers,
However strong and tall
The Conqueror of you all,
Is Woman, Woman!
No corslet is so proof,
But through it from her bow,
The shafts that she can throw
Will pierce and rankle.
No champion e'er so tough,
But’s in the struggle thrown,
And tripped and trodden down
By her slim ankle.
Thus, always it was ruled,
And when a woman smiled
The strong man was a child,
The sage a noodle.
ALCIDEs was befooled;
And silly SAMson shorn,
Long, long, ere you were born,
oor Yankee Doodie!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S SERMONS TO TRADESMEN.
A GOSSIP BY WAY OF PREFACE.
puPITY of life may sweetly show itself in purity of goods. A man—a
trading-man—may have his conscience beautifully asserted in even a
groat’s worth of commodity; as, indeed, and piteous it is to ponder it, he
may give a twist to his probity in the paper that screws up a pennyworth.
Even at a counter a man may weigh his name, precious in the balance
as a diamond, and weighed withal as tenderly; and with scales in hand,
and falsehood in the way of weight or impurity in one of them, he may
turn an hourly profit on the lightness of his reputation.
Meanwhile, there is an invisible shopman or clerk who will keep the
books. Yes; he will write, interline in the colourless milk of conscience
—to come out black enough some day—the truth of the matter; will
register the fraud to be reckoned in the after-time as a set-off against
the achieved and funded profit.
And having uttered these serious, solemn notes of preparation—these
cries of “silence,” modulated we hope with a grave harmony—we fall
back in our chair, cross our legs, link our fingers athwart our placid
abdomen, and very confidently beg to be permitted to tell a story. A
short story.
In our early days of ink-bottle we wrote a little book—a beautiful
little marrowy book. Is it vanity, gross self-love, to say so? May not
the parent delight in the memory of his little one, laid years ago within
the grave * , May not the author, the father of a charming little subject
decorously drest in ink and paper, lament the lost beauty of his off-
spring dead, ere, cutting its teeth, it made the smallest mark in the
world? Having written a dead book, shall the mortal author be denied
We hope not. Any way, it is
the consolation of epitaph or monody?
a sweet consolation to know that no book dies—whether it |. sighs,
kicks, and expires in the arms of a review; or drops apoplectic from
; press—that somebody is not left behind to weep, aye, to bleed
or it.
Perhaps the largest, handsomest, and, withal, most inviting cheese
and butter shop—with Spanish hams in festoons from the rafters—hams
that SANcho might bury his nose and cheeks in—is the shop, No. —,
in — Street, as you turn to the left, on your way to the Bank, when
proceeding thither to receive your hard-earned dividend. An admirable
shop ! RABELAIs would have smacked his lips like a whip, at the sides
of bacon crowding the premises. -
We were sold at that shop. Politely flung into a scale that went to
the earth with a growl and a grunt, as, some five hundred copies
strong, we suddenly asserted our gravity in the balance.
“Do famous for the pigs’ cheeks,” said the Master Butterman, look-
ing down upon the paper that thickly clothed our spiritual intelligence,
further arrayed in handsome print.
There was scarcely a sentence of that immortal little book—for
because it is dead to the present world, we believe it to be immortal to
future generations,—scarcely a thought, that, as it flashed from its
brilliant source, we did not consider a spick and span sunbeam for a
benighted and grateful country. How our heart was poured into that
book! And the book would be—famous for pigs’ cheeks'
We were taken to a ware-house—or rather a bone-house—reaching
far and darkly from the back of the shop. The place was cold and
damp, with a sickening smell of mildew. After a short time, so low
miserable, and degraded did we feel, that the prospect of being again
restored for a while to society, even in the company of pigs’ cheeks,
brought a cheery sense of holiday with it. We remembered that pet
crocodiles—sacred sinecurists of certain, temples—were wont to carry
precious jewels at their ears. Well, then, we would be content to
enfold, with intellectual glory, a pig's cheek.
Yet awhile, and we discovered that we lay in the literary dead-house;
an off-tenement, appertaining to the , butter-shop. As we became
accustomed to the gloom, we distinguished to our astonishment, and—
no, we will not suppress the malice of the truth—to our consolation
that we had for companions many printed reams, avowedly produced
to flutter in the highest circles, and bask in the most fashionable
drawing-rooms. Why, there was—but no; we will not name names;
and yet to think that, his leaves, especially made to be rustled by, at
least, a princess should, like our swinish selves, finally associate with
pig’s-cheek - - - -
Time wore on; and it struck, of course, twelve. It was legitimate
midnight; and it seemed to us that, just as exhalations and jack-o'-
lanterns arise from marsh and swamp, and flicker from bog to bog-so
did lights, of all hues, lights without destroying heat, arise from every
heap of paper. The ink—the printer’s ink—seemed to us to undergo
* combustion; and to burn the colour of the mind of the
Writer.
But the strongest, and the most vivid fires arose from some fifty old
ledgers lying scattered in a corner. Some lines burned brimstone blue
—others blood-red; whilst the figures, still keeping their numeral shape,
twisted and moved like fiery snakes of all colours.
A few minutes, and as though the thing grew into form from the ex-
|halations of the ledger page, a little impºsal upon every book; an |
with avarice, craft and cruelty, in his metal-coloured face; that would
now look like a shilling;-now grow into a sovereign; now shrink into
a fourpenny-bit; and now swell to a coarse, copper penny-piece.
Imps of all trades were there. The Baker-Imp who grinds his alum
to make his bread; and selling the staff of life, makes the staff carry a
mischievous weapon for the bowels of him who trusts to it. -
The Grocer-Imp who enriches his chocolate with brick-dust; and with
a morning draught conveys the materials of a vault. - -
.The Milk-man Imp with chalk against his customer, and chalk inside
Iſl.
The Confectioner-Imp, who paints Twelfth Cakes with emerald green
(a beautiful change for coppers, in an arsemite development), and—
especially in holiday-times—plays HEROD among the innocents.
he Publican-Imp, whose head of beer is green copperas—whose ale
is sharpened with the fiery edge of vitriol, and whose grains-of-paradise
are gifts of the serpent.
Enough. We say it—Imps of all trades were there; and every Imp,
in his turn, delivered a discourse upon the wisdom and the profit of his
former doings. And every discourse is as fresh in our memory as the
New-Year greeting of our friends of yesterday. Assured of this, we
shall faithfully report—in the course we heard them—SERMONs to
| TRADESMEN.
PASSAGE.
NoFTH - WEST
passage to
which we al-
lude, and the
difficulties of
getting through
which are equal
to anything
ever attempted
- y the great
explorers of ancient and modern times, is the North-West. Passage
that runs from the Strand in a Nor-Westerly direction, and is known
by the name of the Lowther Arcade. At the present period of the
year the passage is so thoroughly blocked up that the navigation, which
is at all times difficult, becomes almost impossible.
At this time of the year the attempt to perforate the passage is more
than usually arduous, for the wild inhabitants of the place—of whom
there are several-dispose the objects around in huge masses;, the
object, obviously, being to prevent those who venture within the limits
of the passage from finding their way out again. We are convinced
that, were CAPTAIN Cook now alive, he would prefer going twice round
the world to forcing his way once through the Arcade of iowtherland.
DIFFICULTIES OF THE NORTH.WEST
r" rº-
THE WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE.
WE read in Household Words that, amongst the various articles left
in the railways and never reclaimed, was “One Iron Hºheel.” Now it
is very difficult to imagine a gentleman travelling about with an iron
wheel, and leaving it behind him. If it had been his carpet-bag, or his
wife, or even his umbrella, we might be able, perhaps, to account for
the extraordinary absence of mind; but we can as easily conceive a
person leaving his boots behind him as an iron wheel ! The only
solution for the mystery, which we can suggest, is the probable suppo-
sition that the absent gentleman in question was busy reading Punch's
Almanack, and that he was so convulsed with laughter—so lost to a
sense of everything around him, excepting the rich fun he was revelling
in—that the wheel completely ran out of his mind, and has never come
back since. This proposition sounds to us so much like the truth, that
we have our serious misgivings whether, if the owner of the “Iron
Wheel”, were to bring an action against Mr. Punch for compensation,
he would not have to recover heavy damages.
SLEEP AT WILL.
THE general expression is “from pillar to post,” but there is a
morning newspaper so, especially soporific that the expression really
should be altered to “from Post to pillow.”

A thousand strange methods to try it we know:
To draw it about on the hand to and fro. :

And an ivory handle, the whitest and best;
i. showing the breathing, so quickly ’tis clear’d,
The dull metall'd razor first starts for the b
Now, the lather’s mix’d up, to the soap-box we rush;
For five minutes full we wºrk hard at the brush;
We lather, and lather, and lather away,
Till no more of the stuff on the visage will stay.
While, passing it first o'er the magical strop, l
The blade into very hot water we pop.
When fairly prepared, we the process begin,
And the dull metall'd razor is put to the chin.
Grown aged, used up, and turned out of the set,
Worn out, but with somewhat of sharpness left yet;
While its owner its former achievements can trace—
How it oft cut his chin, and rasped always his face;
While the sore he remembers, the weapon he scorns,
| And the dull metall'd razor now cuts all his corns.
| Till at last getting jagged, like a saw in its edge,
Thrown aside and neglected, it lies on a ledge;
Dull, rusty, and ne'er from the dampness now shut, -
It hacks at the wood it no longer can cut.
Now, blunt and neglected, its value all gone, |
In the very same house where so brightly it shone |
When the oyster-knife, lost, is delaying the spread,
The dull metall'd razor is used in its stead.

Dash Our Wig.
MoDERN ingenuity, not satisfied with adapting the
principles of ventilation to ordinary rooms, has applied
them to upper stories, and the result is that Ventilating
Hats and Ventilating Wigs are becoming very general.
We should be afraid that so much ventilation about the
poll would subject one occasionally to a severe blow on
the head, but perhaps a Ventilating Wig is desirable
for the supply of fresh (h)air to be derived from it.
(ADVERtise MENT.)
- THE BARos of BEEF had the honour of dining the
in a Hansom. Royal Party on Christmas Day.
THE INFANTRY TROWSERS.
A CIRCULAR has just been issued from the Horse Guards by the
Adjutant-General on the subject of the summer, trowsers of the In-
fantry, of which it appears the dye is so fleeting, that the hues run into
each other, and whole regiments are seen marching with what may be
termed literally, “flying colours.” Though the Adjutant-General is
“not particular to a shade,” he is anxious that the word uniform
should not be altogether a misnomer, and that there should be some-
thing like uniformity in the colour of the Infantry trowsers.
It appears that those dyers who have hitherto undertaken to dye for
their country, have succeeded very badly, as far as military inexpres-
sibles are concerned; for, to the inexpressible horror of the colonel, the
legs of his men are as variegated as the rainbow. It has been suggested
that ducks are the only articles that can stand washing and rain without
change in their appearance; but these are so expensive that the wearing
of ducks by the army leads to the making ducks and drakes of the
public .# - - - -
As the military authorities are endeavouring to obtain uniformity of
colour in the dress and accoutrements of the infantry, we would suggest
that some attention ought to be paid to the moustachios of the cavalry,
which present every shade, from the chesnut on the tree, to the carrot
on the dinner table. We are aware that everything possible is done to
obtain a darkness of colour by aid, of the famous cire, sold for the
purpose; but since the cire has failed, why not go a little further, and
try the regular cirage f
Drainage of London.
THERE has been, it seems, lately, a rather, considerable drain of
specie at the Bank. It is a great pity that this is almost the only
efficient drain that we ever hear of in the City.
CLOWNS OF QUALITY.
At this festive season of the year, it is pleasing to see that “touch
of nature” which “makes the whole world kin,” exhibited in a very
remarkable manner by the British nobility. Whilst the merry-andrews
at the various theatres are laudably exerting themselves to afford harm-
ess diversion to the British public, we observe with delight that some
of the most illustrious members of the Peerage do not hesitate to make
the same praiseworthy endeavours in their peculiar sphere, which, like
the comic arena at MR. BATTY's, would appear to be circular.
The Morning Post represents the DUKE and Duchess of Norfolk
as amiably engaged in “entertaining a select circle at Arundel Castle.”
The Duke of WELLINGTON, also, is stated by our fashionable con-
temporary, to be “surrounded by a small circle at Strathfieldsaye.”
No one, of course, would take the Hero of a Hundred Fights for a
mathematical point, and imagine him to constitute the centre of a circle
in that sense: and it is obvious that their GRACEs or Norfolk, cannot
be mere radii of a geometrical figure. . They are evidently employed in
contributing to the amusement, of the company which forms, their
circumference; and thus we find that the Drive in Hyde Park is not
the only Ring in which the elegant aristocracy of this, country are in
the habit of making a pleasant and lively exhibition of themselves.

Save up your waste, all the odds and ends
And bring them to SwagshAM the best of all friends.
To Housewives and Servants, and there you will get
A much better price than you ever got yet;
He'll buy anything whether ragged or old,
His shop is the true California of gold.
The peoples own Savings Bank, open every day
And no fear of the Secretary running away.
Brass, Iron, or Copper, it matters not what
Linen or colored rags as much as you have got
Horse-hair, Kitchen-stuff, Bones, or broken Flint-glass
The price that they'll fetch your belief will surpass,
For a lot of White Rags now depend upon it
You will get enough cash to buy a new bonnet
Dress-makers' cuttings will turn into shawls

Worn out Blankets that is not worth a pin to behold
Bring them to me, and although it seems funny
I will soon turn the lot into good ready money
The winter is coming, do think of the cold,
Clear out all your hoardings, and that will bring gold,
Bring all your rubbish down to J. SwagshAM's abode
At the rag warehouse near the main road,
Bring as much as you like, and come EARLY on LATE,
There is ever ready money, and just honest weight
J. SwagshAM is waiting with cash every day,
And only wants customers to take it away;
Keep on doing that while the present year goes
And when the next comes you will have plenty of clothes.

N.B.-A good price given for all kinds of Wearing Apparel, Old Boots, Shoes, &c.
MR. SwagsHAM, “the best of all friends to Housewives and Servants,”
calls his establishment a “Savings' Bank.” A “Stealings' Bank”
would be the more correct description of this institution for promoting
the snapping up of unconsidered trifles. Whatever might be the inten-
tions of MR. SwagshAM, his advertisement offers a direct encouragement
to servants’ converting as much as possible of their employers’ property
into waste and pickings. Our worthy rag-merchant, however, by no
means leaves his hints and suggestions º: He is not only
open to bones and rags, and broken bottles, but to “Brass, iron, or
copper, it matters not what.” It may be doubted if his proposals wo
have been rendered any more explicit by the addition of the following
lines to the above expressive poetry:
“When to Swagshaw's you come, you may have your face masked,
For he takes what you bring, and no questions are asked.
Whether crockery or plate, whether salver or platter,
There's your price for the goods—how you’ve got them, no matter.
In conclusion, Mr. Punch would remark, that if anybody loses his
spoons, the most likely place to find them, provided they are not melted
would be a mercantile establishment, such as Mr. SwagshAM's, shoul
there exist that blessing in the neighbourhood.

Meadows. I stand at last on Ludgate's famous hill;
I’ve traversed Farringdon's frequented vale,
I've quitted Holborn's heights—the slopes of Snow,
Where Skinner's sinuous street, with tortuous track,
Trepans the travelier towards the field of Smith;
That field, whose scents burst on the offended nose
With foulest flavour, while the thrice shock'd ear,
Thrice shocked with bellowing blasphemy and blows,
Making one compound of Satanic sound,
Is stunned, in physical and moral sense.
But this is Ludgate Hill—here commerce thrives;
Here, merchants carry trade to such a height,
That competition, bursting builders' bonds,
Starts from the shop, and rushing through the roof,
Unites the basement with the floors above;
Till, like a giant, that outgrows his strength,
The whole concern, struck with abrupt collapse,
In one “tremendous failure” totters down!—

Enter PRIGwell, talking to himself.
Priguell. I’ve made a sorry day of it thus far;
I’ve fathomed fifty pockets, all in vain;
I’ve spent in omnibuses half-a-crown;
I’ve ransacked forty female reticules—
| And nothing found—some business must be done.
By Jove—I’d rather turn Lascar at once:
ow the walnut's devastating juice
To track its inky course along my cheek
And stain my British brow with Indian brown.
|Or, failing that, I’d rather drape myself
In cheap white cotton, or gay coloured chintz-
|Hang round my ear the massive curtain-ring-
With strings of bold, effective glassy beads
Circle my neck—and play the Brahmin Priest,
To win the sympathy of passing crowds,
| And melt the silver in the stranger's purse.
But ah! (seeing MEApows) the land of promise looms before me:

Tell tales of well-filled pocket-books within.

Your pardon, Sir;
Is this the way to Newgate?
Meadows. Why, indeed
Iscarce can say; I’m but a stranger here,
I should not like to misdirect you.
Prigwell. Thank you,
I'll find the way to Newgate by myself.

THE MUSIC OF THE MATTRESSES.
AMONG the objects of interest about to be sent to
the Great Exhibition is a musical bed, which, we
presume, is intended to be adapted for the playing
of various melodies. Of course, when the bed is to
speak, for itself, it will strike up “Down, derry
down,” or if it is designed to the sleeper at a
certain hour, it will burst out into “Wake, dearest,
wake,” at the appointed moment. We doubt very
much whether a musical bed will be the best for
promoting a refreshing night's sleep, but as a mode
of taking a few bars’ rest, the arrangement may
be very agreeable. Perhaps, however, by the aid

undermining it. The Queen cannot go to open Parliament, because the
Commissioners of Sewers have chosen to open Parliament-street itself as
a vast ravine, and shut it up as a public thoroughfare. The truth is,
that the Commissioners hurl open defiance from their yawning abysses

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FOREIGNER'S NOTION OF THE WINDOW.TAX.
ALLLuxuries are taxed in England. Now, as light in England is a
luxury, (as the very derivation of the word, Lur, implies), it is charged
accordingly, and has to pay a very º duty. . The reason of its being
a luxury, is because there is so very little of it; and the numerous
fogs that prevail in England, three hundred days out of the year, are
the simple causes of its extreme scarcity. The English Government
may be said, not only figuratively, but almost literally, to be founded
on darkness, since the principal source of its revenue is derived from
fogs. This accounts for the little zeal that English ministers
display for the enlightenment of the people, and the contemptible sum
that is expended in England every year upon Government Education:
for, from the above fact, it is clear as the sun at noon-day (we mean, of
course, noonday in France) that it is the interest of Government to
keep the poorer classes as much as possible in the dark;
Only let the English people be once properly enlightened, and you
may take our word for it that they will never continue to pay the
enormous taxes that weigh upon their houses, their lands, and their
incomes, and which depress their energies, and their spirits, even more
heavily than their joys.-Ertract from the Presse, or the National, or any
French Paper.
“Put out the Light.”
ONE of MR. BENNETT's E. reasons for resigning his “per-
petual” curacy has been t º;" raised to his using candles.
This is certainly j up his living for a very light cause. It is
strange that a few long-fours or short-sixes should cause such a “flare
up” in the establishment, and place MR. BENNETT in a state of sixes
and sevens with his bishop.
rt
QUITE A Toss UP BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
It was a favourite saying of NAPOLEON's that “a Market should be
the Louvre of the People.” The City Corporation, however, thinks
otherwise, and, with regard to Smithfield, evidently think, from the
number of deaths that occur, that “a Market should be the Morgue
of the People.”
VERY RIDICULOUS.
WF frequently hear of men gaining the confidence, and the hearts,
and the money, of unsuspecting people from the cleverness with which
they carry out “a false front of hypocrisy.” Now this has always
appeared to us, most supremely ridiculous, for we never could under-
stand the possibility of any one, gaining the slightest credit, from the
fact of his wearing a Dickey—which we take to be the "false frontº
alluded to—and which, though strongly marked with “hypocrisy,” is
more likely, we should imagine, to excite suspicion than confidence, or
at all events, not sufficient to induce you to press the man who wears it
to your bosom. There are many mysteries in society, and this “false
front” is one of them!
Papal Aggression on Punch.
A NEw Year's jovial arrival suggests the mention of the medical fact,
stated in the old song, that “Punch cures the gout, the colic, and the
phthisic; and it is allowed to be the very best oft physic; ” so that it is
; superior in every way to the Roman Pretender's prescription
of bishop.
New Patent Cab.
MR. PUNCH was driven home, the other evening, by a cab who
demanded only four shillings for going six miles! Mr. Punch will not
say that his generosity was not excited by this ºl. circumstance,
of a cab-driver being content with his fare; but he mentions it, just to
introduce the suggestion that it would really be a capital speculation to
start a Patent Honesty Cab, during this New Year of the Great Exhi-
bition. There is little fear that the patent would be infringed.

According to the Erhibition Erpress, musical instruments will occupy

have a collection of all the armoury of ORPHEUs. The Jew will cºn-
tribute his harp, the Chinese his jº. the Ethiopian (serenader) his
banjo and his bones, and Mr. Punch will, of course, send his drum and
Pandean pipes. Thus will be collected the materials of an orchestra,
comprising every species of instrument in the world, since not even the
Scotch bagpipe .# be excluded. There is no sense at all in showing
musical instruments, unless the sense of hearing is appealed to; there-
fore these must, of course, be played, if any idea is to be given of their
merits.
In order that their respective powers may be exhibited at once,
it will be necessary that each should play a different tune at the same
time; which will produce a concert very appropriate to a World's

as the Harmony of All Nations.

which will be of the utmost service as a pattern—to be universally
avoided.

THE SENSE OF BEING MARRIED.
(Paragraph for a Ladies' Page.)
UR old friend, Lord CAMPBELL, says
that, in Scotland, a man can
scarcely tell whether he is married
or not. How different is the case
in this happier part of the king-
dom! ere, every moment of a
husband's domestic life is a
sensible assurance of the fact,
that he is blest with a wife.
When he comes down in the
morning—if he can possibly have
forgotten that fact—he finds his
newspaper aired for him, his egg
and toast ready, his tea made,
and his kettle simmering on the
fire. All these preparations for
his comfort have been made by
her. And there she sits, ready
either to divert him with pleasant
observations, or, if he is inclined
to read, to busy herself with the
arrangements of the table, and
not only to remain silent herself,
- ------ but also to keep the children, if
== - there are any, from disturbing

Should he have committed a slight imprudence overnight, and have a headache in conse-
quence, she condoles with him, and administers his soda-water. When he rises to go out, his
boot-hooks are at hand; so are his boots, º warmed: when he returns, the best dinner
the house, can afford awaits him. ... If he expresses a wish, he finds that it has been
anticipated; if he makes a remark, it is assented to. The stocking he puts on has been
darned or marked by her; every change of linen reminds him that she sewed on the buttons.
Yes; well does the Englishman know that he is married, by feeling, at every turn, the sweet

THE POPE'S BELLS IN ENGLAND.
A CoRREspond ENT of the Times writes on what he apparently considers a most clamorous
and deepening nuisance, that of bells-Roman Catholic º hung over Catholic churches
and chapels—bells “which are rung, with slight intermission, from morning till night.” He
says there is an unrepealed enactment against the hurly-burly of Popish bells; but adds,
“it is evaded by placing bells on the roof under a wooden covering,” which the straight.
forward simplicity of the spiritual sons of the Pope insist is not “a steeple,”—the thing
forbidden by the statute : the law, no doubt, never heeding the nuisance of the bells;
but only applying to the mischief of the thing they were rung under
Now, Doctor WISEMAN may have a special end, in view in these thorough-going
clappers. It is well known that bells-Catholic bells—ring away demons; and indee
clear the air of all influences working against his Holiness the Pope. And, at the present
time, with the English Protestants in all places, clamouring against the scarlet insolence of
is Holiness, alias Flunkiness, there may be a sublime antagonism in the vibration of bell-
metal. Against the speeches of McNEILE and AshLEY, what so seraphically eloquent as
the iron tongues sounding from under the wooden coverings of St. Tibbs and St. Fibs :
“The bells,” said a certain bishop of Chalons, “the bells, placed like sentinels on the towers,
watch over us, and turn away from us the temptations of the enemy of our salvation, as
well as storms and tempests. They speak and pray for us in our troubles; they inform
Heaven of the necessities of the earth !” But then these bells, to be spiritual guards and
protectors, must be duly baptised—called ANNA, STEPHANIA, DEoDATA, MARIA—the saintly
names bestowed at times by royal sponsors. Now, have the Pope's bells in England, com-
plained of by Correspondent, been christened If so, who were their godfathers and
godmothers? Sought out, they might haply surprise us by their rank and lustre.
Be this as it may, according to Correspondent, we are threatened with the condition of
the Ringing Island of RABELAis. The matter was more economically ordered, according to
the Acta Sanctorum, in the time of St. PATRick, for he had only one bell; what then –
that bell was heard in every corner of the Emerald Isle; a bell of so seraphic a reputation, that

may break a blood-vessel,-an angel descended, and repaired the flaw; no doubt closing it
with a piece of the music of the spheres, condensed into harmonious silver for the occasion,
and visible in that day !
However, the bells will no doubt be provided against when the Minister opens his
mouth in February. LoRD John’s tongue, we hope, against all the iron tongues of Nicholas
WisłMAN! Meanwhile, end we this short chapter on the Pope’s bells in England with a few
words from glorious old LATIMER—“The devil should have no hiding-place in England, if
ringing of bells would serve. But it is not that that will serve against the devil: yet we
have believed such fooleries in times past, but it was but mocking, it was the teaching of the
devil. And no doubt we were in a miserable case, when we learned of the devil to fight
against the devil!”

And when I at the lateness frown,
Tells me the engine's broken down?
My newsman!
Who coolly pawns my “other” shirt,
And tells me, with assurance pert,
She’s only dropped it in the dirt:
§ laundress!
Who peeps in every private note,
Wears my best neckcloth round his throat,
And at the “swarry” sports my coat?
My footman!
Who brings my shaving water late,
And with a basket-full of plate
One morning doth evaporate?
My valet!
Who flirts with soldiers dressed so fine,
And leaves that sweetest pet of mine
To tumble in the Serpentine?
My nursemaid!
Who comes to make a formal call,
Merely to criticise us all,
When severed by the party wall?
My neighbour !
Who’s who, or where shall he be sought,
Who may not now and then be caught
At something wrong in act or thought?
Why | No one!
Omnibus Dialogues.
SINCE the alteration in the fares, omnibus
conductors name their customers after, the
distances they are going. We heard an omnibus:
driver the other day enquire of BILL, (all
omnibus conductors seem to have been christened
BILL) “how many he had got inside #" when
BILL answered thus: “I’ve got six short 'uns,
and two long 'uns; but if you drives werry
quick past ife Circus, we may make 'em all
long 'uns.”
APOLOGY FOR MESMERISM.
IT is absurdly incredulous to deny the possi-
bility of clairpoyance, when we know from every
trade-report that cotton, sugar, and a variety of
other substances, are capable of “looking up’’
without eyes.

PUNCH*S SERMONS TO TRADESMEN.
TO THE BAKER.
“People may go to Church together, and be all of one mind as much as they please, -
I am apt to believe that when they pray for the Daily Bread, the Bishop includes
several things in that Petition which the Sexton does not think on.”—MANDEVILLI.
AILY Bread, my friends, is a phrase
round as the world; and in signifi-
cance deep as its bowels. faily
Bread, in its figurative condition, is
the jellied bird's-nest of the Mandarin
of Pekin, Daily Bread is the diurnal
turtle of the Alderman of London.
. Daily Bread may also be considered
in five relations:—
I. Daily Bread of the born rich :
Daily Bread that awaits their waking
every morning without a thought of
unconscious babyhood
§.”. and rejoicing in a big loaf:
read delicious; with enough it.
in it to give sweetness to every
mouthful. -
III. Daily Bread of the worker, pinched and stinted: bread that is
not Daily Bread in the fullness of its sense; but rather Daily Crumb.
IV. Daily Bread of the workman without, work; that is, the Daily
Bread in the bakers' windows wistfully considered: Daily Bread that is
the daily heart-ache of husbands and wives and little ones; the widowed
and the fatherless. -
W. Daily Bread that is the fitful crust and crumb of daily wrong-
doing : the loaf with hempseed ground in its flour; seed that may, in
a marvellously short time, become correctional oakum.
Now, Daily Bread, my friends, in these relations, may speak to the
moral and bodily man with a sweetly solemn-with a pitying—with an
awful voice. It may preach tenderness and itude to the rich;
sympathy to the prosperous; hope to the struggling; promise, with an
uplifting thought of after-manna, to the destitute; and penitence to the
wicked. And, my friends, let these voices enter your hearts, and “do
their spiriting.” Your hearts I leave to the after-influence of these
voices; and, now let me address myself, to the dealer in Daily, Bread—
Daily Bread in its reality—ay, to Daily Bread in its veritable crust
and crumb.
Master Baker, stand forth !. Alone, let us take a turn or so in the
fields. It is seed-time, and, blithely as hope, the sower casts the grain
abroad; and every grain, to grow, must be sound at heart. If musty or
ant-bitten, it will rot in the dark earth; if true at the core, the grain
will quicken and put forth its blade of tender green.
Another turn, and the wheat is up; , is waving in the airs of spring.
Another, and the ears hang thick, and the farmer begins to count his
gains. Another, and we hear the sickle biting the golden crop. Man has
worked, and God has blessed his labour. A thousand shocks of
corn are the glorious trophies of that well-won field. Oh Master
Baker, does not your heart try to leap—but cannot, it is too big—with
thankfulness? You could drop upon your knees among the stubble,
Qh Master Baker, and send up whisperings of gratitude,-up, up, with
i. lark above you, -the lark that sings, and sings the anthem of the
arvest.
Oh Master Baker, you are overwrought by the heavenly goodness,
the divine beauty, that lies around you. Yes, you are; it may be—nay,
I will be positive, you are—a civic baker; a baker unused to the deep
delights, in their ravishing fullness, of country life. The sight of that
field, so full of goodness, of natural truth, has been too much for you.
Let us return to your shop.
We are home again; and now let us descend to your bakery. Why,
what is this? Baker, it dwells within us to compel your utterance.
So, you turn pale, and your knees knock, as at the accusing inquest of
weights. Speak! What thing is this?
Baker. Alum.
And this?
Baker. Chalk.
And this 2
Baker. Lime.
And this? And this? And this?
Baker. Starch, plaster, pulp of potatoes, mashed beans, subcarbon-
ate of L
That will do, And, Baker, for what purpose have you these com-
modities 2
Baker. For what? Why, please your goodness, Sir, and don't I sell
the best wheaten bread: "We’ve ways had 'em, Sir; father had 'em
the loaf: even as mother's milk awaits
ii. Daily Bread of the worker, bread
-
before me; though, perhaps, he used 'em with a smaller hand than his
son; but then, Sir, sons live in other times than their fathers. Now,
when I look at the alum and my eldest boy, SAM; when I consider the
chalk, and think of Bob; when my mind wanders to the plaster, and I
remember the cleverness of JAck; for, Sir, that’s it—
What’s it?—
Baker. Why, that’s it. As the world comes to more brains, it comes
to cheat the cleverer. The baker of to-day despises the baker of his
ancestors. Alum is only another word for brains, and chalk means
intellect. That’s a truth—
Silence, Oh Baker, and no enthusiasm
Baker. I must. A truth, as true as the counter.
Truth, Oh Master Baker! And have you forgotten the field of wheat?
The field of truth? Did not every grain of wheat become wheat? Was
it changed, juggled into weeds—was it transformed to beans—did it
bulge into potatoes? More: did one wholesome grain become a grain
of poison?... Did not wheat return wheat, ay, forty, fifty fold—pure
and profitable? Oh Master Baker, a field of corn is God's field; but
łºwº-ºve with alum, chalk, and plaster—are loaves of the
eWII.
Yes, of the Devil, Oh Master Baker; and the Devil wears his ugliest
horns, shows his hºof at the worst, and arms his tail with its sharpest
barb, Y."...i the anatomy of a baker—he sells the infernal
loaf, the loaf damned with chalk and plaster, for the best wheaten
And, Oh Master Baker, dealer in chalk, plaster, and so forth, what
an admirable book-keeper is the Devil! Not the benefit, the after-
benefit of a single loaf will you lose. Does not your alum “increase
your yield” of bread, and shall it not be put to your eternal profit?
And then alum, taken with Daily Bread, tells its daily tale upon the
stomach of the customer; a matter to be faithfully recorded.
Consider this, Oh Master Baker; and thinking of that lovely field of
wheat, think for a moment upon the fiery poppies that here and there
burned among the stalks, and so thinking, take heed of your after-
conscience.
And when, in the fulness of the till, you—(I speak to the honest
Baker)—retire from business, think how sweet—how comforting will
be your Sunday visits to your parish church. For you, Oh Master Baker,
have trodden alum under your feet—you have never dealt in plaster—
you have manfully eschewed clay—you have defied the profitable
temptation of bean-flower—of potato-pulp-of rice—of chalk. You have
not vended a diurnal flam for a household truth; you have sold the
wheaten-stuff as it was grown by earth and heaven; and thus, with no
wrong upon your conscience—with no diseased stomach of man or child
to lay to your account—with no iniquity of adulteration to answer for-
you may, with a light heart, Oh Master Baker, think of every loaf of
i. past life with a sereme heart, and, so thinking, with a pure and
lopeful spirit make that universal petition—words that are as the
throbbings of the hopeful human heart—
“Give Us THIs DAY our DAILY BREAD.”
THE FOGY'S HAPPY NEW YEAR.
ON New Year's Eve the ringers kept
Me waking with their mirthful din,
When I, alas! would fain have slept a
The Old Year out, the New Year in.
To ToM, who longs to be a man,
Those chimes sound merrily, no doubt,
And glad the heart of MARY-ANNE,
Whose mind is bent on coming out.
Bach New Year's peal the young folk rings
The nearer fun, which TIME delays;
But fogies—such as he who sings—
The farther from their happy days.
QUANTITY OF RAIN.
A METEORological Amateur assures us that at least two inches of
rain fell on last Friday evening. He ascertained this fact by sitting in
the first row of the pit of the Haymarket Theatre. The might was a
very wet one, and as, every one brought in a drenched umbrella, the
water kept dripping down to the foremost part of the pit, where
collected in a narrow gutter just in front of the orchestra. The slanting"
descent of the Pit favoured, of course, the collection of the water, and,
our Correspondent says, that towards the fifth act of Pirginius the
gutter, which was a sad inconvenience all the evening to his hat, and
boots, was full two inches deep, for he measured it, with the ferule of
his parapluie. He recommends a better system of drainage for the pits
of our Theatres, for though it may be highly pleasing to a manager to
see an overflow in his house, it is not exactly so agreeable to those
who have to sit for five or six hours with their feet in it.

IGNATIUS IN LIVERPOOL.
FATHER IGNATIUs, late the HoN, and REv. MR. SPENCER, has been
assaulted in the streets of Liverpool. This is very bad—a violence to
be repressed, and punished. Nevertheless, a FATHER IGNATIUs may
commit the first offence. For is it not an assault upon the feelings of Pro-

streets in all the pride—the Church pride—of Roman Catholic ascetics?
Seeing, as we have seen, black-robed priesthood stealing along our daily
path-gliding by with unmistakeable looks as to their purpose, that of
spiritual and social domination in free England,-we would advise the
offenders to be a little less ostentatious in their mode of offence. They

THE “chalk formation” is pointed to as one of the sources whence

THE CHRISTMAS BOXES.
DRAMATIS PERSONAE.
Mr. BRIEFLEss, (of the Outer Bar and the Inner Temple).
Worsliot, (First Warden).
PostMAN, (with a Letter of Introduction).
The BEADLE, (a Staff Officer).
ScAvength, (with his Dog and his Bell).
THE DUsTMAN, (a Character not easily sifted).
Waits, Second Porters, Watchmen, Second Wardens, &c. &c.
The Stage represents a Chamber in the lane of the Inner Temple.
MR. BRIEFLEss discorered poring over a late book, chile a small
party of mice are keeping Christmas in one corner of the room over a
pound ºf candles.
Mr. Briefless (suddenly disturbed by the sound of the mice). What noise
was that? (Listens.) 'Tis a ridiculous mus
Making a musty or a mouldy meal
Upon the moulds that form my candles' store.
Such sounds as those recall me to myself,
When rapt in PUFFENDORF's perplexing pages.
Ah! when shall BRIEFLEss wear an honour’d name *
When will the hour arrive for fame at last
To thunder at the portals of renown,
And on the tardy opening of the door
Present an order for admitting one—
That one, myself—my place the foremost row
In reputation's enviable stalls?
But BRIEFLEss yet shall burst upon the world:
The roof of Westminster's time-honour'd Hall
Shall echo yet with his hot eloquence,
And the reporters' pens, like angel's wings,
Shall bear his eitea trepoevra up
Into the glorious sunshine of renown. [A single knock is heard.
What’s that?—a brief perchance—or p'rhaps a bill!
Away with doubt—I’ll know the best or worst.
[MR. BRIEFLESS goes to the door, and opens it upon Worshot.
Briefless. Whom do you want?
//opshot. I take the liberty
Of calling on you for a Christmas Box.
Jºrieſless. Who, and what art thou?
Wopshot. - I’m First Warden, Sir.
Briefless. Where are thy duties 2
Hºopshot. At the outer gate!
Bºſless. What hast thou done for me that I should give
A Christmas Box: Say! Hast thou blown a horn
To give me warming of a foe's approach:
Has thy shrill clarion from the postern, Sirrah,
Announced the advent of some creditor?
hºopshot. I do not understand your meaning, Sir.
The usual Christmas Box is half-a-crown.
[The PostMAN appears at the door.
Postman (to BRIEFLEss). A letter, Sir—and this is Boxing Day.
Briefless. I understand the hint—but prythee, tell me,
Why should I give a Christmas Box to thee *
Postman. For bringing you your letters, Sir.
Briefless (laughing hysterically). Ha, ha!
Didst thou but know one half what they contain;
Could'st thou imagine how thy dreaded knock
Falls on the hollow chamber of my heart
How the warm blood rushes to all its ce
And soon turns cold within its icy vault;
Could'st thou imagine this, you would not dare
To come and ask me for a Christmas Box.
But there’s a shilling for you—go your way.
Postman. A shilling !-why, there’s four upon the beat.
Besides the country and the foreign post.
Britiless. I’ll give no more. (Seeing the staircase filling.) But who are
these, and these ?
[DUSTMEN, PokTERs, NewsBoys, WATCHMEN, BEADLEs, &c. &c.
appear at the door, and continue increasing in numbers.
Dusſman. The reg'lar Dustman takes the liberty
Of asking for a Christmas Box.
Briefless. For what?
I have no dust, except upon my shelves.
ist Porter. I’m the Day Porter, Sir.
Briefless. What's that to me?
I need no porterage.
hatchman. The Watchman, Sir.
Bruſless. I’ve nothing here to watch save the dull hours,
Days, weeks, and years, that take their circling course,
And leave me—only where I was before.
2nd Porter. I’m the Night Porter—if your honour pleases.
Briefless. Just as you please.
2nd Warden. And I’m the Second Warden.
Briefless. Hence, useless second to an idle first.
But who are these that throng around my door?
Beadle. The Beadle, Sir.
Briefless. A Christmas Box for thee!
I hate the very name of Beadledom—
What hast thou done for me?
Beadle. Sir, I’m the Beadle.
Old custom bids me ask a Christmas Box.
Brieſless. That custom I will honour in the breach.
What is a Beadle but a thing of shams?
His gold-laced coat and soldierly cocked hat
Proclaim the phantasm captain, while his staff,
That speaks intimidation to the boys,
Marks the stump orator.—Away!—Away!
Beadle. I’m no stump orator, though for the stumpy . -
I’ve a decided liking. Please to stump up? [All the applicants laugh.
Briefless. Yes, laugh at my expense, I’ll suffer that;
But I’ll not to your Christmas mirth subscribe
In any other shape.
A confused murmur. Shabby! Oh, shabby!
[A bell is heard on the stairs, and the SCAVENGER appears with it in
his hand. |
Briefless. Silence that noisy bell! What knave art thou? i
Scavenger. The constant Scavenger of fifteen years.
This is the bell, and here's the reg’lar dog.
[Pointing to a black-eyed Poodle, ºrho barks.
I left a paper, Sir, with a request, i
You'd give no Box to any Scavenger
But one—who brought the reg’lar bell and dog,
And shows a medal of the death of NElson.
Briefless. You raise confusion in my heated brain.
What’s NELsoN's death to do with scavenging?
The regular dog with NELsoN ? And the bell,
What’s that to do with either?—least of all,
Have I to do with thee ? Am I going mad?
[The finkling of brass is heard on the staircase, and a Brass Band
appears at the door.
Brief!ess. Who are these varlets 2
1st Musician. Sir, we are the Waits.
Briefless. Dead weights you are upon society:
Disturbers of the peace of families:
Midnight marauders, robbing us of sleep.
1st Musician. You’ll give a trifle for a Christmas Box *
Briefless. Your impudence is brazen as your horns.
Go, draw them in ; for I will ne'er pull out.
Dustman (to the assembled applicants). Well, friends, I think we are
only wasting time.
If all the world come down with no more dust
Than this here gent, as true as I’m a Dustman,
We should be useless, and our ash quite settled.
Briefless. I tell you all at once—I’ll give you nothing. [They all groan.
Postman, to you—I’m deaf as any post.
You, Warden, must elsewhere seek your reward.
You, most irregular of regular Dustmen,
Have not to deal with common dust in me;
I follow not the ordinary rule.
And you, Sir Porter, 'tis your trade to bear—
And disappointment is your burden now.
You, Watchman, Beadle, Scavenger, and Waits,
Have watch'd, done beadle's work, scaveng’d, and play’d
In vain for me: no Christmas Box I’ll give.
Such Boxes much require shutting up.
Another Christmas you will knock in vain,
Even at my portal; for I’ll ne'er again
Open my door to such a gross abuse.
[There is a general groan. Mr. BRIEFLEss shuts his door; and the
countenances ºf the applicants and the curtain fall together.
Another Miracle.
A SACRED Picture in the Church of St. Saturnin, in the department
of the Vaucluse, has for some time past dropped blood. This has been
added to the authenticated miracles' The Courier de Lyons adds
“. The blood has been analysed by two medical men, who have declared
that its chemical composition exactly corresponds with that of human
blood.” Who could . it? When the juggler thought it necessary
that the picture should bleed at all, he would have been a dull dog.

º
BYRON's Mazeppa has º: a fresh lease of popularity
from the edition issued by MR. BATTY, who does not confine his
attention to our poets alone, but has taken in hand one of the finest
Works of one of our principal prose writers. Kenilworth, with splendid
illustrations—not in calf extra, but strong additional horse—has just
been issued from the Astleian establishment, and promises an impression
§: as large as any work that has preceded it...We never saw any-
thing better done, “in boards,” on any º: it repays one for the
hot-pressing process that must be gone t
ocking to witness it. -
We went ourselves, “stitched in a meat and appropriate wrapper,” a
few evenings ago, and arrived just as Amy Robsart was desiring Anthony
Foster to “touch not her garment lest it should go hard with É head”
-a, hint to that gentleman, that, to avoid one for his nob, he may as
well take to his heels; which he does accordingly. Amy is thus left
alone, when she hears a whistle, which seemed to us to come from the
º but we were assured, from Amy's own lips, that the whistle
was Leicester's signal; and that the tremendously shrill C Sharp of an
unmistakeable cat-call was “a mote of his lordly music.” When, how-
eyer, the affectionate Amy rushes to meet, as she supposes, her lover,
she, comes suddenly upon Parney, whom she makes pay pretty dearly
for his borrowed whistle, by the contempt she showers down upon him.
Warney proposes that Amy shall pass as his wife, in the presence of the
uéen, and, on the arrangement being scorned, he observes, that, if she
“obstanately refuses, means that may be readaly conceived ” must be
resorted to.
The interview being brought to an unsatisfactory close, there is
another whistle—a fresh note of “Leicester's lordly music,” from
the scene-shifters; and we are presented with Amy's boudoir, furnished
with a sort of raised luncheon-tray, or low sideboard, by way of otto-
man. Here Amy is seeking consolation from her attendant, Janet
Foster, when Anthony enters, with a huge golden goblet, containing
“something to drink” for the unhappy Miss Robsart. That young
lady does not seem altogether disinclined to the beve until Janet,
suspecting something wrong, or perha relying on its being all right,
insists on taking the first “pull” at the liquor. Anthony immediately
snatches the cup from his daughter's hands, and empties about three
pints of water on to the stage, declaring it to be “poison,” which is
carefully “mopped up” when the scene changes. The young ladies
are horrified, and Anthony further deluges the apartment with about a
gill of the tears of penitence.
ugh by the crowds now
(AstLEY's EDITION).
Amy makes her escape; and we are introduced, in a subsequent
scene, to MR. Hicks, who is riding about as Leicester, over difficult
platforms, and canvas, battlements.' He is, reviewing his retainers,
mounted on six variegated steeds, ready for the reception of Elizabeth,
who is served up to i. public on a charger, who ought to keep steadily
under a gorgeous canopy, but shows †† to back out of it.
Elizabeth receives a proposal from MR. Hicks, who aspires to a share
of the crown; but her ; declares she will have “no husband but
her country, no children but her people.” She then desires to be left
quite alone; but as her train is made of satin, worth at least 58.6d. a
ard, she is not permitted to jº. solitude, involving the spoiling of
er robe, which is accordingly held up by two pages, who are not only
drawbacks on herself, wherever she moves, but drawbacks on her
wishes for perfect privacy.
It so happens that Amy has found her . to the gardens of Kenil-
worth, j meets the Queen, who, being told that Leicester is her lover,
roars out, “Who waits?” and there being plenty of eaves-droppers
within ear-shot, the stage is soon filled, and poor . Hicks is taxed
with his duplicity. Having admitted one unhappy attachment, he
becomes the victim of another, for Elizabeth, turning to MR. R. SMITH,
the riding-master of the establishment, of whom cards of terms, ma
be obtained,” exclaims authoritatively, “My lord of Shrewsbury, attac
him (meaning Mr. Hicks for high treason.” Upon this, MR. R.
SMITH looks at MR. Hicks, and, MR. Hicks, hanging down his head,
looks at MR. R. SMITH, when the ceremony of attaching Leicester for
high treason is supposed to be º but Susser, having said a few
words, which we did not quite catch, the Queen takes her attachment
off Leicester, and having mounted her horse, remains most conde-
scendingly to be lighted up with some blue fire, which is subsequently
changed for a small shovelfull of red, which makes everything couleur
derºse for the going down of the curtain. . .
The second act is confined to the machinations of Warney against
poor Amy, in which he seeks the aid of the machinations of the stage
machinist. He consults with Foster as to the nature of certain
“masheenery” connected with the hall-staircase ; and finding an
arrangement similar to that of a drop for the execution of criminals, he
resolves on plunging the unhappy Robsart into the “yawning abbess.”
MR. Hicks, however, having been attached and unattached for high
treason by MR. R. SMITH, three or four times in the course of the
evening, arrives happily, in , time to see Warney, smashed by the
“perilou-smasheenery” already described; and as MR. BATTY never

allows anything but virtue to triumph at Astley's, the original sto
is so far departed from, as to save Amy, who comes down a bac
staircase into MR. Hicks's arms; while Queen Elizabeth prancing on
horseback into the hall—fortunately there is no umbrella-stand—the
“pyrotechnic department under the management of MR. B. FENWICK’”
lends its aid in the form of that blue and red fire, which seem to be
essential to the consummation of Amphi-theatrical happiness.
We have only to say, in conclusion, that the Astley’s edition, with
its good bold characters, its gorgeous illustrations, and incidental cuts
—in an introduced combat—is to be ranked among the most successful
of the numerous issues and re-issues of Kenilworth. ,
THE MYSTERY OF “CLO’.”
It seems a wonder how the cry of “Ou” clo’!” can pay—if all the
“clo’” purchased are really “ou’.” No great surprise, would be
excited by the discovery that very much of the “clo’” is, in fact,
“sto’,” to use an abbreviation which will be speedily explained. A not
very marvellous solution of the commercial mystery of “clo” was
afforded by a police-case, which occurred at Guildhall last week, and
was reported in the Times.
A lad of 16, named JAMES THOMAS NEWLAND, charged with robbing
his employer, a warehouseman, was brought before "Mr. Aroºs
FINNIs on New Year's Day—many happier and more creditable returns
of the day to him! He was accompanied by MR. HENRY HART,
an old clothesiman, and another persºn, bºth,” says the repºrt,
“members of the Jewish fratermity”—though it is to be hoped that
the Synagogue, does not fraternise with aſ the HAAT tribe. They
were accused of being the receivers of stolen property—consisting of a
quantity of linen and woollen goods,--in other words, of “clo.’”
The boy NEWIAND had expressed contrition for his thefts, into the
commission of which he declared that he had been trepanned by Jews.
This criminal HUGH of LINCOLN, wishing to make a clean breast of the
whole affair, was now placed in the witness-box, wherein he detailed
the process of his undoing. He first related how, having an old jacket
for sale, he saw HART in Gutter-lane one morning, and sold him the
garment; how HART asked him where he worked, and he told him;
what his master dealt in, and he told him ladies' collars, gentlemen's
shirts and fronts, ladies' habits, and children's * dresses: if he
ever had any soiled collars that he could sell him? and he said he had
not; and how the tempter then said, ‘‘Perhaps you can get some other
things, if you can’t get collars; ” how he at first resisted the temptation;
how this was repeated day after day, till at last he yielded; and con.
tinued from time to time purloining his master's goods, and ultimatel
receiving the reward of his iniquity, in the truly mosaic coin, a sweate
sovereign and three bad shillings. . A few specimens of HART's
way of doing business, as described * the witness, are richly worth ex:
tracting. The unlucky lad had at last been prevailed upon to steal
some “clo’” in the shape of children's dresses;–"I took them,” he said,
“to a beer shop, and
“HART followed me in. He said, ‘What have you got there?' I told him they were
children's dresses. He said, “What's the use of these; why don't you bring more?’”
In spite, however, of thus depreciating the articles, it seems that
MR. HART could suggest some “use ’’ for them. He would not buy
them, and become—needlessly—a receiver of stolen goods. No : but
when the victim, finding this, expressed the intention to “take them
back, and put them into stock again,”—
“He then said, ‘You must pawn them, and give me half the money, or I'll send you
across the water.’”
And again:—
“He said, ‘I have got two of them with me, which you must pawn.' I told him I
would not do it. He said, “There is only one step between you and a prison.’”
What follows may be anticipated:—
“I pawned them for 5s., and gave the ticket and half the money to HART. I met
him again a few nights afterwards. I pawned the rest of the dresses, HART waiting
outside, as before. I pledged them for 12s., and gave HART the ticket and half the
money."
. On another occasion, MR.HART has an article of “clo” to pawn on
his own account, and finds, it convenient to make witness his agent in
the transaction. Deponent demurring,
“HART then said, “If you don't like to do it, I'll expose you, for you are micely in my
hands!’”
“Upon this,” proceeded the dupe,
“I agreed to pawn it, and he told me it was a cloak and hood, and that I was to get
10s. on it. I said, ‘I don't like to pawn this,' and HART said, ‘You had better do it; it
comes from JAMEs WELCH AND Soss; and there is a young man there, who is a porter,
and he sells me a great many things, and you might do the same. He then said, ‘I
often have a few things from NEVILLE’s.’”
By this time, perhaps, it will appear not improbable that “clo’”—as
to the profitable portion of the merchandise—consists largely of such
commodities as “a few things from NEVILLE’s.”
Well; but is this recital of disgusting villany to lead up to nothing
lively? Nay—but to an excellent joke: the joke not of Punch but of
HENRY, WEBR, detective policeman, none, the worse or less racy for
being dry, like old port, Police Constable WEBB—whose joke was
joked on oath—was on the look-out for our clo'-merchant. An indi-
vidual was pointed out to him as the person he was in search of. Let
the Detective proceed:—
“It was the prisoner HART. I went up to him, and spoke to him; and HART directly
stopped me, and asked me in a confidential tone, if I had any ‘old clo'' to sell. I told
him I had not. He then asked me if I had got anything, as he was not particular
what it was. I told him I had. He asked me what it was, and I told him it was an
order to arrest him.”
Waggish WEBB | Never was gentleman more neatly taken up than
HART. -
ANOTHER BLOW AND GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT
FOR THE HAT.
“FRIEND PUNCH,
“I am one of the sect known to thee and others by the
appellation of Quakers. Thou knowest the tenacious reluctance we
have to lift from our heads our hats—be it to the highest or to the lowest
—to King, or Queen, or Lord Mayor. I can tell thee, friend Punch,
that often and often has my poor head suffered from our headstron
adherence to this principle. The headaches I have endured I canno
tell thee. There is a red rim round my forehead to this present day
which no soap, or emollient, or pommade, be it ever so divine, w
remove. And it is all owing—I feel it, aye, like unto an iron band
round my head—to the unshapely weight of the hats we wear. Thou
canst not tell the crushing load of that unseemly appendage to thy
crown unless thou hast worn one, as I have done, for ten consecutive
hours, at a public meeting. Therefore, Friend Punch, thou may’st rely
on the co-operation of every true Quaker in the coming crusade thou
hast º: ainst the present kind of hat; which, to my fancy,
partaketh far too abundantly of the appearance-yea, and the heaviness
too--of the common chimney-pot. , I am a candidate for alight, flexible
comfortable material, which, withal, shall not be too manifestly ugly. f
implore thee to guide me, Punch, in this dubious matter, and to counsel
me whether it would be unseemly, or exciting the little boys to too much
merriment, so that they might indulge inpublic observations, if a Quaker
were, in the full breadth of the light of day, to walk down Regent Street,
in the kind of hat which thou callest a Wide Awake." Couſii venture
in such a covering without subjecting myself to outward marks of
indignity, or of chastisement, such as might inflict on one the necessity
of purchasing a new suit of clothes? Thy advice is needed for the
especial comfort and guidance, Punch, of
“Thy Old Friend,
“OBADIAH BROADBRIM.”
THERMAN WHO NEVER LOSES.
-Q ERTAINLY, MR.HUDSON is a wonderful man,
for, according to the papers, he has won
another sum in the railways of £150,000.
Speculation with MR. HuDson seems to
be a winning game. Every card he plays
turns up trumps. It would be curious
to calculate the entire amount of his
winnings this year. It would be some-
thing under a million, if not beyond, for
his gains are always of a most colossal
size. He is never content with anything
less than £100,000, which seems to be as
little to him as if you were to give a
Spanish Bond, by way of Christmas Box,
to ROTHSCHILD. He will be at a loss to
know what to do with his money. We
shall see him, one of these unhappy days
when everything is below par, buying up
half-a-dozen bankrupt railways, and bein
chairman, directors, shareholders, an
everything himself, which will certainly
be the best way of “making things pleasant,” as he will have no one
else's accounts, or goose, to “cook,” but his own.
But all business, without some kind of amusement, grows very oppres-
sive. We recommend MR. HUDson, therefore, as soon as he has won a
few more hundred-thousands, to try his hand at a little harmless fun. Why
should he not, “just for the lark of the thing,” carry out the testimonial
that was never presented to him? He would only have to #. up the
subscriptions. Suppose they cost him £90,000, or even a million, what
is that to a man of his enormous wealth? He would then only have to
purchase some costly work of art, to give a grand |. and to present
in a glowing speech the Hudson Testimonial to himself after dinner.
Depend upon it, the joke would be tremendous, besides being a glorious
satire upon the humbug of testimonials in general.

POLITICAL BIAS.
OW and then we hear of the
“political bias” of certain
men, and certain parties.
We suppose it refers to the
large sums of money that
are spent at elections in the
urchase of votes. The
‘political bias” of a mem-
ber so elected means, then,
that he has the wealth to buy
any quantity of votes at the
rate of £40 (which, we are
told, was the latest quotation
in the bribery market at
St. Albans), or whatever sum
may be demanded, per vote.
Constituencies so purchased,
however, are as frequently
sold as bought. The phrase,
therefore, should be enlarged,
to combine both those facts.
Independent electors, when
talking of their member,
should not be content with
dwelling upon the sterling
virtues of his “political bias,”
but should go further, and
make handsome allusion to
his other accomplishment,
and speak of him as “a man
of a sure political bias—and

BELGRAVIA has not hitherto been known as a sporting

End are likely to take a prominent place in the annals
of ferocity:—

where the Fat may be cut off at 12s. per lb.; the head and skin for sale.
Any gentleman desirous of shooting the Bear on the 30th instant, may,
by application at the Dépôt, be supplied with further particulars.
It is really very hard º the poor bears imported into
this country, that not only their fat, but their fate should
be made a source of profit; and that they should become
the mark of such sportsmen as love sport for the luxury of
killing in cool blood, without the excitement of the chase, |
its dangers and contingencies... We presume there must |
be candidates for the privilege of doing the butcher's work
upon the poor bear, who is brought from his home at the
Pole to bestow his fat on the polls of those who take it into
their heads that it may offer a sort of hair-breadth escape
from baldness. -
The “head and skin” are also for sale; and considering
how many bears we meet with in the world, who seem to
have no head at all, we think the offer likely to suit a great
many. As to the skin, it might serve as a real bear-skin
coat, but a lion's skin would be more in demand by the class
of ºnal to whom the advertisement seems to address
itself.

TOO MANY COOKS 1
HAVE read with alarm, Sir, not unmingled with
astonishment, in a recent number of the Times, the
proposal of “A º: Wife,” that, as there
is a difficulty in finding cooks, at small wages, the
opportunity of the Exposition should be seized hold
º for opening normal schools for cooks, under the
superintendence of the chefs of the different restau-
rants, cafés, chop-houses, dining and refreshment
rooms, slap-bangs,
eating-houses, .
naries, table-d'hôtes,
&c. &c. &c. &c., whose

ing, frizzling, turning

“Sir, as a man
blessed with a dis-
criminating taste, and
a respect for the
great mysteries of
the kitchen, I put
= in a solemn protest
against any such most
dangerousand revolu-
- tionary proceeding.
“I fear this ‘Clergyman's Wife’, writes under a very imperfect sense of responsibility.
Does she know what she, in her kindly-meant, perhaps, but most short-sighted benevolence,
may be bringing upon the country—that is, upon that portion of it which can afford to get a
dinner every day, and I do not take any other class into account?
“‘We have too few cooks,” she says. , Granted, at once. Out of ten houses where I dine,
nine proclaim the fact, trumpet-tongued, in that unvarying saddle of mutton, faced by that
immutable pair of boiled fowls, or, at this, season, equally monotonous turkey. The same
melancholy truth is apparent, in the degraded complacency, with which the men and women
of our day put up with the dreary uniformity under which the British table languishes. You
see the things I have described eaten day after day, week after week, year after year, with
all the appearance of appetite. . No, one seems to imagine what a world of scientific
invention of varied jº. of high dietetic art, of refined aesthetic enjoyment, lies latent
in the thing “dinner.' We are little better than culinary Red Indians'; and what PENN has
gone forth (save this ineffectual quill of mine) to preach to the savages the great lesson of
‘what to eat, drink, and avoid?”
*We have too few cooks, then. I grant this much to the “Clergyman's Wife.”
may have too many; and we all know what too many cooks do.
“Bless me, Sir!—excuse this warmth; but I cannot write with patience—does, the
woman know what a good dinner is? Is her husband a bishop, or a dean, or a golden
prebend, or a rector? No such thing, I’ll be bound; but some poor, half-fed, rusty-coated
curate, with six children, and the wife in question, habitually employed in making legs
of mutton, go, impossible lengths. Some such poor, scheming, scraping, saving sort of
a woman this Clergyman's Wife' must be—one of those benighted beings who hold that the
first function of food is to satisfy hunger, and that an appetite is as necessary at table as a
knife and fork. -
“I say, has she any conception of Cookery as an Art—as the art of modern times?, Paint-
ing is effete; Sculpture is dead; Architecture is º for new life out of iron and glass.
But CookERY is the growth of the last century, and is still vital, every day glorifying the table
with new creations. Up E is not her MICHAEL ANGELo; nor CAREME her RAPHAEL; nor
SoYER her CARAcci. These are all her ‘quattrocentisti,” her Pre-Raphaelites, mere pre-
cursors of the great lights yet to arise on the culinary world. But Cookery, as an art, is
jºi. self-originating and homogeneous. ... As there is one school of Painting for Italy,
and another for Germany, and another for Spain, so with the respective schools of Cookery
of the civilised countries of Europe.
Eclecticism will be as fatal to the art of the kitchen, as it has already proved to that of the
painting-room. The Great Exposition will let loose upon us the manners and cookeries of
many men. Each style will run the risk of contamination from those around it. The pro-
found combination and subtly mingled succulence of the French cuisine will be apt to catch
heaviness and over-marked tone from the stronger flavour and richer handling of the
German kitchen ; while both may concur to rob the piquant and picaresque Spanish cucina
; |. . and dashing qualities which make the veritable Spanish cordon bleu the SALVATOR
of the kitchen.
“But, if these various schools of culinary art are likely to run into each other, mischievously,
even in the hands of conscientious and accomplished masters, what a chaos of consequences
will result, if we turn loose a set of raw, presuming, and undisciplined British plain cooks,
rudderless, into this sea of crossing currents, to find their way to some port of their own
choice, by a track of their own discovering ! -
“I shudder to think of the possible results. Fancy the bacon and chorizos, of the Spanish
Qlla, finding their way into the blandness of a North German himbeeren-suppe, or think of
detecting the truffe de Périgord in the unctuous recesses of a Turkish pilaff/
But we
“Of such a hideous confusion of *.
such a meaningless syncreticism of opposité
doctrines, and incompatible aims, the only result
would be an incongruity infinitely worse than
the E. nullity of the British kitchen. That
kitchen, if totally devoid of character, is, at least,
free from pretension. But a half-taught British
plain cook, with a smattering of the culinary
mysteries of all nations, may be expected to be as
arrogant as her productions are certain to be
intolerable. -
“And this will certainly be the result if the
Normal Schools of Cookery—somistakenly, though
I am willing to think well-meaningly suggested
by the Clº Wiſe’—are brought into
operation, under the demand for unskilled
labour which the influx of hungry, visitors is
likely to create in metropolitan kitchens during
the Exposition.

requested to send sealed tenders to the Secretary
of the Area, the Reverend the Sotto-Cameriere,

Cakes and crumpets are required, and milk and
cream will be received by the same officer at the

Milk-men (whose lives and milk-walks keep
them in a Protestant town, where all sorts of
abominations, and adulterations are practised,)
are cautioned respecting the article which they
shall offer for His Eminence's table. Calves’

Prince of an Infallible Church.

that, whilst the Paper-Tax and Window-Tax-

all past recollections, that the name be altered
from Gore, into “THE GoRGING House of ALL

Throwing his Advice in the Streets.
GENERAL CHANGARNIER has issued to the
inhabitants of Paris some “Instructions in Fight-
ing.” We think these instructions rather super-
fluous, as the Parisians know, *
only too well how to fight in the streets. If
the General had given them a few “Instructions
how to keep the peace,” he would have done
them a much greater service, and he would
not have thrown his advice so completely in
the streets.

his portrait has so often been drawn, by Mr. Punch. One distinguished individual has,
however, at last shown his sense of what is due to a gentleman of Mr. Punch's consequence.
Mr. Punch has been honoured with the animadversions of a person no less eminent than his
EMINENCE CARDINAL WISEMAN–so, at least, it is understood—in the Dublin Review. It is
true that the Cardinal calis Punch”“old and §º. But then he says that “Punch

before CARDINAL WISEMAN was ever thought of by Mr. Punch—an established
formula for traducing this paper. Those whose corns Mr. Punch has trodden upon have
always said that; , but, the proprietors of the corns, were “humble, very, humble,” like
URIAH HEEP, and did not wear red stockings. But our Cardinal is also humble, to
condescend to, a bout, with Punch ; crosier against cudgel. And “Mother”—Mother
Church—“she’s humble too,” to have reared so exalted a son, in so much humility.
To think of his Eminence volunteering to be a combatant on Punch's stage; taking off his
pallium, and setting to work to give us a drubbing!, And here are a few, of the knocks
with which we have been honoured by the Cardinal. Punch, he says, besides having
“become old and drivelling,”
“Had taken to preach and be a saint, had lost all his good-humour, had turned sulky, and then pugnacious
and ill-tempered; and, not content with this, had come down to his old street-occupation of playing the hangman.
º: before McNEILE in wishing Catholic Bishops to be sentenced to death, and then mercifully transported
Nay, but this is rather too condescending, good Cardinal; it is stooping so low as to
the assertion of that which is inexact. McNEILE has already pointed out your mistake in
his behalf. As to Mr. Punch, you are equally mistaken in representing him as usurping the
functions of MR. CALCRAPT. Nor would he, as you imaginatively insinuate, have atholic
bishops transported—any more than other people—except for stealing. With respect to
four territorial titles, my Prince of the Church, the cry of Mr. Punch is not so much “No
º !”, as “No Robbery!” -
s to his good-humour, Punch flatters himself that he had preserved that hitherto. But
he really fears that he is a little nettled by one thing CARDINAL WISEMAN has said about
him. Mr. Punch, is not aware that he “had taken to preach and be a saint.” But suppose
he had. . Surely the cap of Mr. Punch denotes his right to preach equally with the Cardinal's
Hat, nay, with the Tiara itself-having, equally with them, been derived from the primitive
ages. And as certainly Mr. Punch has a right to be a saint if he pleases. Is he not the ye
. of one, and as worshipful an image as any that ever winked * Look at the stained
mediaeval windows, and observe the attitudes of the saints therein depicted. See how their
heads are set on their necks, and mark the manner in which they hold their crooks; and then
look at Punch, and say whether he is not a saint of the original pattern all over.
But, come; Mr. Punch must not wax too warm, even in defence of his sanctity. He is
not seeking to impose, upon Englishmen, the spiritual domination of a priesthood, by a
pretence to absolute holiness; the refutation, of which pretence—as by proved complicity
in false miracles and cruel persecution—would be fatal to his scheme.

FALLACIES OF THE MALE
FACULTY.
THE inquiring reader will find in Punch's
Almanack (which, by the bye, is acknowledged
to be, not simply by ourselves, but, by every one
else, the greatest wonder of the world—and
still may be had at the Punch Office—price 3d.)
certain “Fallacies of the Female Faculty.” A
lady has written accusing us of meanness
in not having given, also, the Fallacies which
exist upon the other side; “for she is quite
sure,” she says, “that the Gentlemen, indeed,
have just as many Fallacies, if not more, than the
Ladies.” She calls upon us, in language too
emphatic to repeat, instantly, to reme ..
deficiency—and if we don’t, that she'll re-
luctantly compelled to say, “that Mr. Punch
is a brute.” To avert such a dreadful cata-
strophe, she has kindly forwarded us the accom-
panying list, which we are too happy to have it in
our power to print—for we do not think we could
live another minute, if any lady were to call us
“a brute!” Besides we never imagined that
there were, or could be in existence, half so
many.
FALLACIES OF THE GENTLEMEN.

That women are only born to be their slaves.
That dinner is to be ready for them the very
minute they come into the house.
That a lady's bonnet can be put on as quickly

ing the bell violently, has the effect of making
us dress one bit the quicker.
'hat they can do everything so much better
than we can—from Hºf. baby down to
poking the fire.
That they are “the Lords of the Creation”—
(pretty Lords, indeed!)
That nothing can be too good for them; for I
am sure if you were to º a hot joint, before
them, every day, that still they would be dis-
satisfied, and would be grumbling that you never
gave them cold meat.
That they know our age so much better than
we do ourselves. (It’s so very likely!)
º they may invite whom, and as many, as
they please; but if we only invite our mamma
to come and stop with us, or just ask a dear
unmarried sister or two to stop with us for a
month, that there’s to be no peace for us so long
as they remain in the house.
That music can be learnt without *.
and that it is necessary for them to rush out, and
to slam the door violently, the very moment
we begin to open our voices, or to run over the
last new Polka.
ti That sleeping after dinner promotes conversa-

That they know what dress and bonnet be-
comes us so much better than we do.
That it is necessary to make a poor woman
ery, because a stupid shirt-button happens, to
be off. . I declare, some men must believe that
their wives cut off their shirt-buttons "...;
from the savage pleasure they take in abusing
them for it.
That we are not allowed to faint, or to have
the smallest fit of hysterics, without being told
“not to make a fool of ourselves.”

money, and if we venture to ask for any, that it

BUTTERMILK FROM LIMERICK.
(For CARDINAL WISEMAN.)
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
Second Do. “Oh, very DROLL!”
|
It is highly important to CARDINAL WISEMAN, just 'now, that, his
|
supporters should distinguish themselves by, their charity, humility, d
moderation, and good sense. How very much obliged, then, he must
be to “The Congregated Trades of Limerick” for having voted him
: an Address of sympathy so replete with those Christian graces, that
| Mr. Punch is c."upon to notice it. The document opens with the
| following exemplification of -
HUMILITY.
“Proud of the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England, and of your exalted
position as its most honoured head and illustrious ornament, we, the Congregated
Trades of the city of Limerick, approach your Eminence with sentiments of the
profoundest respect and admiration.” -
It may be necessary to remind, the heretics and Englishmen who
read Punch, that the word “proud” in the above paragraph is use
both in an Irish and a Romish sense, and is therefore, of course, to be
understood to mean just the reverse. This is explained in the next
paragraph; which runs thus:–
“Limerick has always been foremost in defending the ancient faith—the religion for
which saints have suffered and martyrs bled; and now her humble, but faithful, artisans
are proud of the opportunity of testifying to the world their delight at the appointment
of your Eminence as Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster.”
Pictures, it seems, instead of martyrs, are now bleeding for “the
ancient faith;” but let that pass., The succeeding clause of the
Address may be regarded as singularly characterised by
GOOD SENSE, CHARITY, AND MODERATION.
“As Irish Roman Catholics, and inhabitants of a city which has suffered so much in
the cause of liberty and religion, and who nobly defied the blood-thirsty bigots of by-
gone days, we shall never look tamely on and behold in silence our church enslaved,
and the Roman Catholics of the world insulted, by base and bigoted Ministers, who,
true to the principles of their party, only await an opportunity of proving their
undying hatred to Catholicity, and add more to the many penal laws which accursed
Whiggery has placed on eternal record in the black annals of English history.”
Irish Roman Catholics are wonderful fellows, no doubt, in uniting
the particulars “Irish,” and “Roman” with the universal “Catholic;”
but still more wonderful are they in living in this Victorian age, and
nevertheless having “defied the blood-thirsty bigots of bygone days >>
as the parties to this Address declare themselves to have done in the
lucid and grammatical paragraph just quoted. It is sufficient barely to
irect attention to the mild, meek, gentle epithets, “base and bigoted,”
black,” and “accursed,” as specimens of the cooing of these intensely
“Irish” and strongly “Roman” Catholic doves.
. The Address then proceeds to favour the Cardinal with the following
rich piece of “assurance:”—
“Your Eminence may feel sincerely assured that we abhor and detest bigotry in
every creed and clime.”
Except—the reader will perhaps be tempted to add—in Ireland and
in Popery. CARDINAI, WisłMAN's sympathisers conclude with another
assurance, which may be rather less satisfactory to him. They tell him
that should his “ holy and christian-like remonstrances not succeed in
d|allaying the É. embers of bigoted malignity which are smouldering
within the bosom of Protestant England”—strange-coloured embers
and an odd grate!—and “should the faithful shepherds of the jº,
be driven from their flocks,”—he, the ejected Cardinal, will a
hospitable home “in Ireland, in the country of the persecuted.”
Some other country than that, one would think, would afford a more
comfortable asylum to his Eminence. Truly, these Bulls from Limerick
beat, all the Bulls from Rome. However, “the country of the per-
secuted”—being Ireland—is one, say his Limerick friends,
“Where, notwithstanding the dreadful havoc made in our population by famine and
emigration, enough still remains to protect our faithful and beloved pastors from
persecution or insult.”
Be aisy, ye “Congregated Trades of Limerick!” Nobody wants to
drive CARDINAL WISEMAN, by persecution, to the country of the per-
secuted. No one wishes to add “confessor,” in either sense of the
word, to his titles. There exists, no intention whatever to grill him
over the purple embers of bigoted malignity. Protestant, England
merely, requires that, he shall not use the name of Westminster, to
which he no right, and which WISEMAN–were he really wise—
would drop, gentlemen of Limerick, like a hot potato.

PUNCH*S SERMONS TO TRADESMEN.
TO THE CONFECTIONER.
For who that looketh on the books,
It saith—confection of cooks,
A man him should well advise
How he it took; and in what wise.
THE text, my friends, comes from the inkhorn of a John Gower,
whose pinch of dust—should a pinch remain—is to be found in the
vaults of St. Saviour's, Southwark. Hard upon five hundred years ago,
John Gower delivered himself of this fling at the confectionery of the
fourteenth century. Now, had JoHN Gower lived on the last sixth of
January, it is mightily to be feared that, pondering a twelfth cake of
temp. Wic, he would have dealt a yet stronger thwack at the confection
of our day than at the blancmanger and comfits eaten in the time of the
Second RICHARD.
Now, in those º arsenic was a mystery. Whereas, my friends,-
and if a guilty Confectioner be among you, let him at once make a clear
breast of it to the accusing spirit, that, though it now and then takes a
long nap in the bosom of the evil-doer, will nevertheless, like a teeth-
ing child, cry out again most lustily,–let him, I say, with sinking knees
and pe endicular locks, confess that he knows arsenic as a thing com:
mon in his business; that he is familiar with arsenite of copper; that
he has acquaintance with chromate of lead; that he has taken in his
º, a felonious matter-felonious, for falsely used—called blue
werdlter.
My friends, consider a Twelfth, Cake. Look at it, clothed in sugar
—virgin sugar—yet untasted by the lips of man. Consider and admire
the º that, to the outward eye, are as the rich and happy ones of
the earth, made for sweetness; purity, their pedestal; and beneath
them a mine of wealth. Think of that Twelfth Cake, below its saccha-
rine crust; and what is it but a miniature resemblance of the bowels of
the earth, with candied lemon-peel for Californian gold, glowing raisins
for topazes, and blanched almonds for onyx P
But, my friends, our present discourse is with the externals of the
cake—with the outward accidents of the cake. Here, we have brought
a cake with us. See; we place it before you. Behold the images;
consider the flowers that besprinkle and deck the cake; flowers that,
like Alpine buds, brighten even the snow.
Come forth, you trembling Confectioner! Stand up among the body
of our hundred thousand audience; and listen to your accusers. For
here they are, half-a-dozen of them.
Behold, my friends! Waving this goose-quill—a relic from the wing
of Merlin's Michaelmas dinner—gently waying it above the head of
every image; we give to the paste, or plaster vitality and speech.
Every image is now sentient and intellectual: not a whit more so, the
Lord Chancellor of Lilliput. We will first—to the amazement of that
guilty Confectioner—question the Grand Turk here. Though no taller
—as you º, our forefinger, his Seignorship will answer
#. the brains of a life-guardsman, and, we hope, in endurable
ngllSłl.
May it please your Sublimity to tell us, -were you present at your
own birth P
Grand Turk. I was; and know all about myself. There is but one
Confectioner and—
Stop—stop ! Answer, and make no comment. Of what are you
composed ?
Grand Turk. Plaster, or chalk; and—and—
Speak out, my little Mussulman.
Grand Turk. And poison. Yes, poison. You see something very
green about me, do you not ?
We do: your turban. As a descendant of MAHOMET, your turban is,
of course, green; it is the prophetic colour. Proceed.
Grand Turk. But green is the promise of life—the colour of new
existence. Now, my green is the hue of death; the tint of the grave.
My turban has not the innocence of the leaf of the rose-bushes of
Paradise, but is the greenness of copper.
That will do. Stand aside. We will now examine this image of a
Sailor. He has a frank and joyous look. ... In his right-hand, he waves
his straw-hat, invitingly, as he would call all the company to come and
slice the cake; and then, his P. foot declares him ready for a
rattling dance, contemptuous of cockcrow. See; we wave the goose-
quill over him—and see, my friends, how the smiles fade from his face;
what a melancholy look it has ; and behold with what a sorrowful air
he twitches the waistband of his trousers
Now, JACK Biscuit, what do you know of yourself?
Jack. Know, your honour? I’m ashamed of what I know, and I
can't help it. 'Lord love your honour, there's no more o’ the real thing
in my looks than in the red ochre of Portsmouth MoLL,-or—
There, that will do, JACK. Leave Portsmouth, and consider the
Company you are in. That is a very fine jacket of yours—eh! John
Biscuit—very fine *
Jack. Fine! Well, my dear eyes, there was never—no never-a
purser that would have the heart to rig out a seaman as I’m rigged by
that lubber of a cake-maker. You'd think this innocent blue, wouldn't
you .* as the blue eye of Plymouth MARY, when, as I
remember—
Come, JACK, ºf the starting brine from your eyes; give another
tranquilising twitch to your waistband, and proceed. Then that blue
jacket of yours—
Jack. Hangs out false colours: isn't true blue at all, No; I'm
pison—the blue is—is—avast a bit! yes, I have it; the blue is cabinet
of copper, and—
Carbonate of copper, John.
Jack. All’s one, your honour; it isn't the word that pisons, but the
thing. Well, and you didn't know what I’ve suffered all these holidays.
Go on, good fellow—go on, by all means. Out with your history.
Jack. Wei. you see, I’ve served aboard another cake afore this—a
cake that was only half cut and went back agin; and then I was drafted
to where I am. Well, I was standing on my first cake, keeping watch
o' the company, when a youngster comes on the sly, and la shold On
me, and afore you could toss a can, has my head and shoulders right
down my jacket, in its mouth. Well, I knowing I was pison as
far as that, and not being, able to say nothing, fiti was doing murder
without helping it. Well, at the minute, a blessed old lady, with, a
bough pot in her cap, comes with her gown rustling along—like the
tide drawing the shingle—and snatches me out o' the youngster's
mouth, clapping me down with a slam upon the cake, right as I was
afore. Well, you can’t think how I felt. Oh, your honour— - - -
That will do. JAck. Such emotion does honour to the whole British
Navy, the Admiralty, perhaps, included. That will do. Come, your
hat in your hand; and your toe pointed for the hornpipe as before:
very good; thank you, -
ur last witness shall be this Lady Image. She looks a Circassian;
but—with a touch of the goose-feather—we no doubt shall understand
her. There, now, Madam, what do you know of twelfth cakes and their
ornaments—what of confectionery—shop confectionery, in general?
Speak, BULBUL.
Bulbul. Know, Mr. Punch! I should think I did know more than
enough—a great deal more. I look very fine, and very innocent—as in
my mind and words I am—but the dress, Mr. Punch; the dress.' I
was almost about to say—goodness forgive me—but I’d rather have
no dress at all than be fitted out with nasty poisons. A rattlesnake in
its summer skin isn't more venomous than I feel myself to be. Look
at these green shoes—they’re some sort of poison of zinc: and you'd
think this an innocent yellow scarf? Bless you! it's chromate of lead.
And this red petticoat; why it’s sulphuret of mercury! And this
trimming of-
That will do, Madam. You remind us of the young woman—the
story is in the “Gesta;” understand us, not the Jester—who was
purposely, fed upon, poisons, and then, married to, an unsuspecting
rince. The bridal kiss was his first and last. Really, you are a very
Hºon. *
Bulbul. What, I? Well, then, you’ll be pleased to blame the Confec-
tioner. And if you come to that, just observe that flower on the cake.
It looks a beautiful fuchsia, I believe * Well, it's full of arsenic—no
poisoned rat was ever fuller. And—I do assure you—and upon my
word—and as true as I am here— -
There—we have waved the goose-feather, and the Lady Image is
fixed and silent. But—
Master, Confectioner, take with you this poison-flower., And when
you are about to deck jellies, to make bon-bons, and to adorn cakes–
take heed that the seeming flower is not a churchyard weed—a thing
of the grave. And further, Master Confectioner, if you must have
images, let them be harmless; that their unsuspecting little worshippers
may taste saffron, or cochineal, at the worst, and not, in their confiding
innocence, taste death. -
An Apology to a Poor Hebrew.
MR. PUNCH greatly regrets having, in his eagerness to lay open what
he has reason to believe to be a system of iniquity, too hastily relied on
the oath of a . rogue, and in consequence mentioned, with com-
ments which he hereby retracts, the name of an innocent man. HENRY
HART, relinquished apparel merchant, has been acquitted of the charges
brought against him º MASTER NEwAND. Mr. Punch begs M
HART's pardon for the remarks he made with reference to him,
which he is as sorry for as he would have been had he mistakenly
animadverted on CARDINAL WISEMAN or the Pope.
Fai ENDLY ADVICE.
We see advertised an “Indisputable Life Policy Society.” We would
advise MR. John Q'Conn ELL, and several other mock-patriots, whose
olicies have all their lives been disputed, instantly to join the above
Society.

BEFORE his Eminence set out from the
Flaminian Gate, he selected, with peculiar
care a large paving stone, which he ordered
his secretary, the REveREND FATHER SAcco-
DINoTTE, to place in his carpet-bag, and to
bring to England.
This truly savoury and miraculous stone
forms the chief stock for the delicious soups
. are served at the Most Eminent Lord's
able.
The receipts are varied: but after the stock
has been made with the Flaminian stone,
pieces of, veal, beef, ham, fowls, &c., are
added, with carrots, turnips, and onions (which
FAther.OLDBoy playfully calls Flam-inions)
—accordingly as they are supplied by the
contributions of the faithful. Pepper, salt,
&c., are now introduced, to suit the palates
of their Reverences, and the soup is served
--but without the paving-stone, which is care-
fully wiped and put away till next flesh day.
n meagre days the stone is not used, as
it would be likely to make the soup too rich.
And although this miraculous stone has
been in constant USE, it is a known fact,
which Doctor CUMMING and LADY MoRGAN
are invited to ascertain, that the stone has
not diminished in the slightest degree. On
the contrary, FATHER WYNKYN, of Rimini,
is of opinion, and preparing an essay to show,
that the stone has increased in size and weight

itchen.

Come, come-cheer up!—it almost makes me weep
To see a foolish child in such dishtress,
And º his foot the golden ball.
Sneakey. Well, well, I’ll bring a bit;-where do you live?
Smoºhey. In Grace's Alley.
Sneakey. I’ll be there to-morrow.
Smouchey. No, not to-morrow, 'tis our plessed Shabboth.
I can’t do pizness on the Shabboth-day.
Let it be Monday—
Sneakey. Monday—be it then.
[Ereunt different ways: SMoUcHEY crying “Old clo' ' " Sereral
fº. are supposed to have elapsed between the Second and Third
arºs.
PART III.--THE CRIME AND THE DISCOVERY.
The Scene represents the interior of SMOUCHEY's Old Clothes Shop, in
Grace's Alley, Hell Street.
SMOUCHEY (is standing near the door, exclaiming to the passers-by).
Got an old vestcoat, that you vont to shell?
I'll call upon you, at your lodgings, Sir.
[SNEAKEY rushes in, and they }oth go towards the back of the shop.
Smouchey. Wot have you brought this time
Sneakey. There’s no one here?
Snouchey. Don't be afear’d—Vot’s this?—more indigo?,
Vy, plesh the poy! there’s near three pounds of it.
Sº, i weighed it, and I found it weighed five pounds.
Snouchey. You tried it in a cheating pair of scales;
Mine are the honest truth—I wouldn't cheat you.
And now I’ll tell you vot I’ll do for you;
I’ll make a shacrifice to use you vell—
Catch hold of these 'ere trowsers. [Puſs a pair in his hand.
Look at 'em.
They’re worth a pound at leasht.
Sneakey. I want the money.
Snouchey. The poy’s a fool; the monish I could give
Will be a crown—the clothes ish worth a pound:
The bargain gives you fifteen shillings clear,
Beshides the valuesh of the indigo.
But shtop-I’ll tell you vot I'll do vid you—
This meerschaum pipe is worth its weight in gold;
If you won’t have the trowshers, take the pipe.
neakey. I’d get a pipe like that for half a crown.
Smouchey. Wot an ungrateful }. !-how he would rob me!
Beshides, the money goes in foolishness;
You told me that the last you had of me
Was gone in applesh, oranges, and nutsh.
Wouldn't you rather now have had the pipe?
Sneakey. 'Tis true the money’s done me little good;
That, as you say, 'tis gone in foolishness.
But if you’ve made me rob my master, Jew, -
You shall not robus both—you sha’n’t rob me. [Snatches up the Indigo.
I’ll take my indigo away again.
The other day I brought some cochineal,
For which you offer'd trowsers.
Smouchey. Well, ma tear,
And vot is money goot for but to puy?
The trowsers vash a pargain—plesh ma heart!
I could have shold'em for just twish the shum.
Give me the indigosh—and take the pipe. -
Sneakey. No, that I won't—I’d rather take it back.
[He runs out with the Indigo. SMouchey runs after him as far as
the door; then stops suddenly, and says to a passer-by,
Wot have you got to shell?—jusht shtep inshide.
[A Stranger enters with a bag. SMouchEY and the Stranger retire
together to the back of the shop. They look very cautiously
about them, and the scene closes in.
SCENE THE LAST.--THE DISCOVERY.
The Stage represents Mincing Lane. SNEAKEY is walking rery fast with
a bag under his arm, when he meets PROBE, of the Detective.
Probe. Hallo! Young chap—I want a word with you.
What’s in that bag? -
Sneakey (confused). What’s in the bag!. Oh, nothing.
Probe. 'Tis strange, the º: infinity of nothings
That goes about this great Metropolis
In baskets, bags, and parcels, after dark.
I’ll trouble you to let me see the nothing
That seems so bulky underneath your arm.
Sneakey. What I have got can be at any rate
Nothing to you.
Probe. There’s many a naughty nought,
When nothing turns up something in the end.
But I’ve no time for parley—pull it out.
Sneakey. Well, 'tis no use—there—there—'tis indigo.
Probe (eramining the contents). This looks uncommon blue—where
did you get it?
Sneakey. I got it from my master: truth is truth.
I stole it, as #. done a great deal more,
Over-persuaded by a rascal Jew,
Who made me rob my master, then robbed me.
Probe. Are you prepared to tell us where he lives?
Sneakey. I am. | 'm sick of this dishonest life;
Pleasure nor profit has it ever brought.
It has not made me richer by a penny;
And as to happiness, that’s all quite gone.
Hoping to save other º fools,
Who walk unsteadily the path of life,
For want of principles’ secure foundation,
I’ll take you to my master's and the Jew’s.
Probe. To dish the Jew is a judicious act.
But let me caution you : whate'er you say
Is at your peril—so don’t say a word.
Sneakey. I thought you were an officer of justice;
And being so, why thus discourage me
In speaking truth? by doing which I feel
The cause of justice I shall much assist,
Though at my own expense.
Prohe. I beg of you
To say no more. I’m one of the Detectives;
My duty is detecting criminals.
The task, though hard, the law makes harder still,
Forbidding us assistance to obtain
From rogues themselves.
Sneakey.
Bºº confession.
robe. Will you hold yºur tongue?
Or must I run the risk of my dismiss:
Because you will further the ends of justice,
When 'tis your interest to baſile them?
Sneakey. I say again, I stole–
Probe (collaring him). I'll hear no more!
So to the Station-house away—away !
[PROBE drags SNEAKEY in the direction of the Station-house, and
the Curtain falls.
Pray, let me ease my mind

Whence the Cholera derives generation.

THE GREAT (EXPECTED) SEASON OF 1851.
EveRY one is expecting to make a fortune in the Great Exhibition
Season of 1851; Beds are, by anticipation, going up in the environs o
London, and a large broker, in Broker's Alley, is selling so many bed-
steads that he is making a fortune at full gallop with four-posters.
Somebody has even proposed to make the bed of the Serpentine avail-
able, and perhaps it would not be a bad idea to throw a Mackintosh
cover across the whole surface, and thus turn it into one of those water
beds which are sometimes so strenuously recommended by “the faculty.”
The plan would have the double effect of hiding an offensive object and
promoting the convenience of the public; while the Serpentine itself is
well adapted for the purpose of repose, as when anything is said about
cleansing the river, the authorities seem determined to go to sleep
upon it.
Religious Persecution.
THE Congregated Trades of Limerick have forwarded an Address of
Congratulation to CARDINAL WISEMAN, and offered his Eminence a
home in Ireland, should the reign of ELIZABETH be revived in England.
The CARDINAL says that Mr. Punch has been unkind to him; but—
…#. . from my friends”—we never wished his Eminence so badly
off as this.
LORD CHANCELLOR's LUNATICs.
It is alleged that the prisoners of Chancery, said to have been incar-
cerated so long for contempt of Court, owed their imprisonment to their
own perverse eccentricity. Very likely: no one in his senses would
| wish to stay in gaol; and we can ii, conceive, that the rascally
injustice of Chancery had driven them mad.
CLFRICAL JOKE.
UNLIKE the corpulent Pontiffs of the bloated Anglican Schism, it !
f| is known that the Princes of the True Church fare modestly, and live in
the simplest manner. Until the faithful have subscribed for plate, steel
forks are provided for the frequenters of the Cardinalitial table; where
potatoes, greens, and legs of mutton are also thankfully received and
eaten, when supplied by well-disposed persons. -
Last week, a select party being assembled to try the merits of some
beef-steaks, which had been sent in by two pious butchers, FATHER
OLDBoy said, sticking his three-pron fork into the meat, that they
were met on a new Tridentine Council.
This irreverence, shocked FATHER NEwBoy, and some of the late
converts exceedingly; and MR. Oldboy is to do penance on split peas
at the next feast day. |
“A MERE MATTER or ForM.”
Of all things that are worn for the “mere matter of form,” stays
should be the very last, for they have ruined more forms than any other
article of dress;–such, at least, is the medical opinion of Dr. Punch.
A very Wide Opening.
How many people there are who want nothing but an opening; and
who, in fact, are ready to close with any opening that offers. Perhaps
the grandest opportunity that has yet occurred, is the opportunity that
now exists at the Crystal Palace, in conformity with the provisions of
the following Advertisement:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LADY FAN AND CARDINAL CROZIER.
WITHIN these few days
there has been a
mighty elegant tiff
—a tiff entirely—be-
tween a Lady’s Fan
and a Cardinal's
Crozier. Miracles
have begun again in
England ; and with
NICHOLAs WISE-
MAN enthroned in
Westminster, a WIR-
GIN winking at Ri-
mini, and an Ecce
HoMo bleeding in
the Department of
Vaucluse—miracles
were certainly to be
§ looked for about
this time in London.
Hence, a Crozier
has dogmatised, and
= a Fan—a Lady’s
- Fan—has, with an
air of eloquent in-
dignation, made
more than answer.
The affair came off
in Golden Square;
and if the curious
reader will wend his way to that regenerated quarter, he will see the
knocker of No. — carefully muffled in scarlet lamb's-wool, and straw
reverently laid before the door. To the last inquiry of our Devil, ere
locking up for press, the answer was—“Its Eminence the Crozier is
as well as can be expected.” -
The Fan had before shown itself a mighty good Fan at a hard rap:
a Fan—the verything for Hotspur—to “brain” a man withal:—a Fan
that had made a mighty breeze in Italy; a Fan that Popes and Emperors
—all now folded in congenial lead—could not abide; believing that if
they permitted it to come winnowing about them, they would be
mightily troubled to keep their blessed, their anointed—(for surely
doesn’t the legitimate oil go clean through, from the crown to the
sole?)—their anointed feet —a Fan that, for the audacious things
printed on it;-(a Fan, by the way, bordered with *ś
and stretching itself upon two cut sticks of Irish oak)—a Fan that
to the contentment of the Church of Rome, had been folded up and lai
by in the Index Expurgatorius—the roundhouse library of his Holiness
the Pope' And to think that only a few days ago this identical Fan
should be out again; and, in the face of the Crozier of Golden Square,
flirt contempt and disbelief at the uneasy Chair of St. PETER!
The Crozier is a stout article; cut from a Spanish chesnut, and
handsomely carved and ornamented by the ablest Roman artists. And
the Crozier is not hollow, like the pilgrim's staff in the old play—so
devised that it may carry an inside of golden crowns, with an outside
look of piety and poverty;-church staves never were made after such
deceitful fashion; never. No; the Crozier is a thorough-going bit of
Spanish wood; no doubt as truly Spanish, as was ever, lighted to the
inconvenience of heretics, and the passing illumination of the Church.
... And it would seem that the quarrel between the Crozier–by the way
it was not then a crozier; no, nothing but a rector's staff, that has
since blossomed scarlet as pomegranates—is of an old, old date; almost
some twenty years ago, the staff having struck at the Fan in 1833;
struck at that feminine type of coquetry and eloquence, with no more
tenderness than if the Fân had been the staff of the Bishop of St.
DAVID's beadle. But, then, what has a Catholic Rector of a College to
do with gallantry? Heresy has no sex.
We now proceed to give the report of the dialogue between the Fan
and the Crozier, as brought to us by an iron fly—a Fly made after the
fly of Regiomontanus; a fly that, for the public weal and on public
º we never hesitate to send into any house and through any
eyhole.
ScENE.-A Library in Golden Square. Discovered, LADY FAN and
CARDINAL CROZIER.
Fan. May I have half a syllable with your Eminence? It’s of ST.
PETER's Chair—and only half a syllable. -
Crozier. Madam, a whole syllable, at least; in my house, no lady
must take less.
Fan. You’ve written a work on “Lady Fan's Statements regarding
St. Peter's Chair, preserved in the Vatican Basilic?” . A work :
(CRoziER bends a bow.) Now, your Eminence, that work, with the
body of a mouse, has the bellow of a bull.
P
Crozier. Your Ladyship will not flatter a poor, unworldly priest.
Fan. It was your, purpose to stifle me—that is, my Italy, which is
me—and you did it! You built me up, like an innocent nun, in the
Roman cement of your Inder Expurgatorius—and you sought to drive
me from the hearth-rugs of ministers, publishers, ambassadors, book-
sellers, and other decent people. But you didn't!
Crozier. Your Ladyship—
. Fan. Be quiet, your Eminence—only a quarter of a syllable. At that
time, what your Eminence was, I don't know, an won’t say how
little I care; but at the time when my Italy was born, I had taken tea
-(I did not say tay, though your Eminence may be familiar with that
honoured pronunciation)—feawith Pope Pius VII, and had more than
one lemon ice handed to me by CARDINAL GONSALVI.
Crozier. Still, your Ladyship— -
Fan. Manners, your Eminence, and let a lady speak. At that time
what was CARDINAL CROZIER P. It may be, one among the 'prentice
priests from the Shannon—one lost among 'em, like a chance chesnut
in a sack of paraties.
Crozier. Nevertheless, your Ladyship— -
Fan. Only a bit of a syllable. 8. of the Chierici, who still reeked
of turf smoke—and who hadn't wiped their tongues from bog-tallow *
And now—like a flea in the night—comes upon me your dirty Remarks.
Here’s the book, with 1833 burned in its cheek; and for me—until now
—it has slept like a babe with its thumb in its mouth, and water—(holy
water!)—on its brain.
Crozier. But, your Ladyship—
Fan. Will your Eminence 5. a lady speak?–To come to what (at
Rome) is called, St. PETER's Chair. Well, is it wonderful that your
Eminence should be mighty hot about that same Chair?. Haven't you,
some day, an eye to a seat in it? And when folks think to put up for
a long stay at the Three Crowns, don’t they like to have a good reputation
with their beds
Crozier. Notwithstanding, your Ladyship—
Fan. Be easy, your Eminence, and wait your time.
Three Crowns at Rome has mighty fine accommodations.
sleepers are many. As BoILEAU says of another place—
And sure the

Grozier. But the Chair, your, Ladyship?. The Apostle's Chair?
Whº –in your anathematised and heretical Italy — what said
you :
Fan. Here it is, your Eminence, like an honest magpie, in open
black and white. Here it is—fxpy FAN reads from “Italy,” vol. II).
“The sacrilegious curiosity of the French broke through all obstacles to their seeing
the Chair of St. Petra. They actually removed its superb casket,and discovered the relic.
Upon its mouldering and dusty surface were traced carvings, which bore the appear-
ance of letters. The chair was quickly brought into a better light, the dust and cob-
webs removed, and the inscription (for an inscription it was) faithfully copied. The
writing is in Arabic characters, and is the well-known confession of the Mahometan
faith:—“There is but one God, and MAHOMET is his prophet.’”
That’s what I said; and that’s what I’ll stand to—sit to—wake to,
and sleep to.
Crozier. The seals were never broken—the cover never lifted—
Fan. Cardinal, mavourneen, just to prove it, lift the cover now.
You say the Chair was given by a Roman senator to ST. PETER. Who
knows? the nets of the poor fishermen may be under that same cover?
Hasn’t your Church in its day sold the iron filings from St. Peter's
chains—that never grew less? And why mayn't—
Crozier. The Chair is of wood, almost entirely covered with ivory.
Fan. From the tusks of the elephants that trampled to death the first
Christians! - - --- - -
Crozier. An ivory chair, with bassi-rilievi of the exploits of
HERCULEs -
Fan. Strangling LUTHER with one hand, and feeling for WICKLIFFE
with the other -
Crozier. A curule chair of ivory and gold, with rings at its sides for
poles, to be borne upon men's shoulders. - -
Fan. A Chair of Meekness for the Fisherman Pope who, learning his
lesson of º on Calvary, acts it from a seat of ivory and gold on
the shoulders of his brethren'
Crozier. And wherefore doubt our Chair of St. PETER.? Doesn't
your Church—yes, your Church—boast of the Chair of WICKLIFFE *
Fan. The WickLIFFE, whose dead body, after more than fifty years,
was torn from his grave by that wolf in scarlet, Pope MARtin W.
—that WICKLIFFE whose remains were burnt to ashes, and the ashes
cast into the Swift; and, as FULLER finely says—"Thus this brook
conveyed his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow
seas, they into the main ocean. And thus the ashes of WickIIFFE are
the emblem of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world over.”
That, your Eminence, is our boast of WICKLIFFE; not his wooden
Chair, which, did it remain, would be a thing to treasure, not to worship.
To no priest of Lutterworth, seated in it, would it give the tithe of a
hen's nest of eggs. Now, 'tis somewhat otherwise with him who sits

JURIES OF GENTLEMEN FOR GENTLEMEN OF
THE JURY.
IME may have been “made
for vulgar slaves,” but it
does not seem to have
been made for poor work-
men. . The Times Law
º of Friday...last
under the head of “
Court,” gives, the sub-
joined cruelly hard
CASE OF A JUROR.
“A person who had been
summoned on the jury, asked
to be excused.
“MR. JUSTICE WIGHTMAN.
On what ground?
“The Juror. Because, my
lord, I am only a journeyman
tradesman.
- “Mr. JUSTICE WIGHTMAN.
A journeyman tradesman . I
am not aware that that is any
ground of exemption.
“The Juror. My lord, I can't afford to give up my time.
“Mr. Justice WightMAN. I dare say it may be very inconvenient, but I cannot
excuse you.
“The unfortunate man was then sworn: he will have to attend, day by day, for more
than a fortnight, and may, perhaps, run a great risk of losing his situation, while, at
the same time, some hundreds of gentlemen of fortune are not called upon to take any
part of this unpleasant duty.”
This case may appear, at first sight, to disprove the maxim that “the
Law is no respecter of persons,” but, it will be seen to confirm that
saying, if you look into it. Here, on the one hand, are poor men whom
it ruins by taking them from their work. There, on the other, are
rich men, whom it leaves to pine with ennui for want of work. So it
is impartially merciless to both. . Many gentlemen of the leisure
classes are so troubled with Time that they don't know what better to
do with it than to kill it; as though minutes were vermin, and hours
kittens or blind puppies. Why not compel them exclusively, to serve
as common-jurors? A week or two of useful em lo ſment, occasionally,
in that capacity, by way of change from billiards, battues, or steeple.
chases, would be a positive treat to them. A burst with the forensic
hounds, now and then, would be a relief from fox-hunting. The
transition from the betting-stand to the jury-box might be pleasant at
times. But, as some of the parties in question might be of a contrary
opinion, a sufficiently heavy penalty should be provided to induce them
to serve the public for recreation. If property is a qualification for any
office of importance, those ought to have good incomes who are to
decide in cases of life and death. Sad complaints are made of ignorant
jurymen, which would be greatly lessened if jurors were always inde-
pendent gentlemen—and if wealth is correctly supposed generally to
imply brains.
As to Mr. Punch, with matters of his own to attend to, which would
preoccupy his mind, he would have “conscientious scruples” to swear, as
a common juryman, to decide according to that evidence which it would
be impossible for him to attend to.
Badder and Badder still.
ONE of those private nuisances, “a wag,” having heard that 8000
panes a-day could be glazed at the Crystal Palace, observed that it
must be “putty sharp work,” and added, that the immense structure of
glass would reflect the utmost credit on all concerned in it.
CONVERSATION BOOKS FOR 1851.
WE are informed by the Morning Chronicle that long-sighted Conti-
mental Publishers are already providing their countrymen with manuals
of English for use during their visits to London for the Exposition.
We much fear, however, that no possible familiarity with the manual
exercise will enable the foreigner tº stand British charges. Conceive
all unhappy German or a bewildered Russ attempting by the delusive
light of “English as spelt” to make out the meaning of “English as
spoken?” But etymological discrepancies will, we fear, not be the
worst in the way of those who trust to phrase-books. Such helps are
extremely apt to lead the confiding foreigner into a conversation, and to
desert him treacherously when he gets there, as an Irish guide pilots
the gauger into a bog, and abandons him up to his middle in the slough.
nder each head of conversation “What the man said,” will in most
cases serve as a very instructive comment on the value of “What the
Book said.” Thus

REFRESHMENTS AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION OF 1851.
º Ivers invitations for
- Sº tenders have been
issued by the Com-
missioners, on terms
that seem to us
rather hard, for the
supply of refresh-
ments at the Crystal
Palace. In the first
place, nothing eat-
able or drinkable is
to be taken out of
the areas; an ar-
rangement that .
eeable enoug
to the police and
others, who find a
refectory in every
area they come to,
but which will hardly
be acceptable to the
public in general.
* No cooking is to
be allowed on the
premises, and, consequently, as far as eatables are concerned, it will be
useless to display at the exhibition any of the raw material.
All stale pastry is to be removed between the hours of six and eight
in the morning, when the boys—those wholesale contractors for dry
rubbish, in the shape of yesterday's buns and tarts—will have to be in
attendance, unless the whole can be sent to a sort of clearing-house,
at a distance, where the juveniles may have an opportunity of effecting
the required clearance. -
The contractor is to be bound to lº gratis, pure water in glasses
to all visitors demanding it; but the Committee must have forgotten
that whoever can produce in London a glass of water fit to drink, wil
contribute the rarest and most universally useful article in the whole
Exhibition.
As we are expecting visitors from all nations, we may look for a
sprinkling of Red Men, to whom it would be a mockery to offer bread
and butter, ginger-beer, or even SoYER's Nectar; and we can only
recommend that the contractor should be bound to keep a set of kan-
fº in sizes, to suit the appetites, more or less moderate, of the
dian epicure.
The scheme of the Committee allows nothing for the diversity of
tastes among all the nations of the earth, but proceeds on the presump-
tion, that the whole world will be satisfied with tea and bread and
butter. When the Ojibbeways were in this country, they were roused
into the most frightful state of excitement at the opening of a bottle of
ginger-beer, which suddenly went off with a bang, when they raised the
war-whoop with such alarming vehemence, that the future sale of
sº in the Exhibition Room was prohibited.
e recommend, before it is too late, that the regulations as to the
refreshments should be modified in such a way as to provide for the
admission of the food of all nations to the Great Exhibition.

DYING “ON THE FLOOR.”
THE Secretary of the Congregated Trades of Limerick, lately sent a
mighty polite epistle to John O'Connell, Esq., touching the ensuing
session; whereupon the Hon. Member returned the following answer
(correct copy):—the response has hitherto been shamefully garbled in
the Irish papers. “Dublin, Jan. 7, 1851.
“Assure yourself, my dear Sir, that I shall go down to the House
prepared every night, until further notice, to die upon the floor, tº the
confusion of the cowardly. Whigs in general, and of Lord John
Russell, in particular. And further, be assured, that I have employed
the vacation in a series of experiments by which I may say, without
vanity, I have brought the art ºf º dying to so deep a
pitch of horror, that it cannot fail to strike the dasta º Cabinet dead
with a minority. Dying—as I propose continually to die—is a most
delicate and difficult art; nevertheless, permit me, with all constitutional
bashfulness, to observe, that I believe I have hit the right coffin-mail
upon the head, and am, at all times, -
“Yours, ready to expire,
“MR, TIM. O'Sullivan. “John O'Connell.”
THE LAND OF CARDINALs.
CARDINAL Wiseman has had a set-to with LADY MoRGAN on Italy,
and may be said to have been beaten on his own ground. Italy being
such, by the way, it is a pity he did not stay there.
HOLY CHAIRS TO MEND.
EnshrINED at Rome there is a certain Chair,
Concerning which, as you may be aware,
A terrible dispute at present rages
*Twixt two old women I won't say,
ecause one writes in such a clever way;
And I don't know precisely what her age is.
Long, for St. PETER's, this same Chair had passed,
*Till LADY MoRGAN hurt its reputation,
Thereby provoking the tempestuous blast
Of DR, Wise MAN's zealous indignation.
According to my LApy's story,
When BuonapaRTÉ, in quest of glory,
Invaded Rome, some Frenchmen—men of science-
Who on Tradition place but slight reliance—
Dragged into light this holy Chair -
sº it, and swept the dust and cºbwebs of it,
henlo! they found its back to bear
A queer inscription, hard to read,
Which proved to be the brief, but famous Creed,
Concluding with, “And Manowet’s his Prophet!”
All this the CARDINAL denies,
As though it were a pack of lies,
Which, to refute, his Eminence describes
This hallowed Chair—though he has neverseen it:
One would have thought the way to stop all gibes
Would have been simply to un-screen it.
No matter; Wise MAN makes the said Chair out
A seat, whereon, at Rome, the higher classes
In ancient times by slaves were borne about,
Using their brother-men as mules or asses.
How like the Apostolic pride!
How likely that St. PETER thus would ride,
Instead of taking quiet walks,
Chaired º the streets on people's shoulders,
A sight to edify beholders;
In short, paraded like Guy Fawkes!
This relic o º divine,
If good St. PETER e'er was its possessor,
Leave we to Cardinals, whilst I design
A better Chair for his successor.
Pius THE NINTH, 'tis right and fit,
On a becoming throne should sit:
One that's symbolical and allegorical.
This is my notion of a seat
Which for Rome's PontiFF would be meet,
Constructed to embody facts historical.
The portion that sustains the Papal weight
Should be Mosaic, wrought of shells exploded;
Four cannons for its legs, this Chair of State
Should have, and for its arms two mortars loaded.
The back let Gallic bayonets prop,
As columns, or pilaster-wise assorted,
With the Tiara on their top,
By way of showing how it is supported.
Thus fashioned, not a soul will dare
To raise a doubt about this Chair.
However heresy their minds may bias
To vote St. Peter's Chair a “flam,”
Posterity will, sure I am,
Always believe in that of Prus.
–
The Circle Squared at Last.
A FashionABLE Co ndent says that he has an idea that some little
difficulty has been experienced in the endeavour to square the circle;
and begs to suggest that Belgrave Square-constituting at once an
aristocratic circle and a distinguished square—is a case of Quadrature
of the Circle.
A CAPITAL STAGE TRICK.
Louis Napoleon has succeeded in quietly removing GENERAL
Changannier from his command. This comes of having known how
to treat the soldiery. No one Clown, playing in the present, Panto:
mimes, has shown lf so clever as the President in pulling out
sausages.
WHAT IS to BE Don E WITH THE POPISH HIERARchy
The Pope may easily translate his prelates into Latin, .We would
suggest, as appropriate sees, the Archbishopric of Alibi, and the
#. of Alicubi, Ubivis, Ubilibet, and Quocumque.

THE GENTEEL VIEW OF THE PAPAL
AGGRESSION.
Hou DENSE OLD Punch, -
“PRAY let me prevail
upon you to abandon the
line you have taken in
reference to the Roman
Catholic hierarchy. A cet
égard, you have quite
manqué votre coup—that
is the universal opinion of
all who move in good so-
ciety. You plant your
guns all wrong—on the
old forsaken ground of
º ethics, and logic;
and all your shots fly wide
of the mark. Béte that
tº you are, don't you know
>>SL, that all the world—the
º world of intellect and re-
finement, I mean-ig-
nores that prosaic real-
ism? Besides, it is quite
de mauvais goût to argue
on stakes, fagots, racks
thumbscrews, and horrid
things of that sort, by
mentioning which you only produce exasperation, and convince nobody,
among the gens comme il faut, whatever may be your success with the
canaille.
“Cannot you understand that we—the cultivated classes, I mean–
have quite ceased to consider the question with reference to material
fact, and vulgar—or common sense?...We regard, it entirely in, an
aesthetic point of view—as a matter of Taste: and this is what renders
your coarse, hard actualities so shocking to us; You joke—or reason,
which comes to the same thing—as if we would condescend to estimate
the consistency of a BoRGIA's conduct, for instance, with the claims of
the Vatican, Poor Punch! We think in quite another sphere. So far as
we are concerned with the Papacy historically, we survey it in its
colour, its contour, and Kºi... * I am afraid not
ou stolid old wretch. e behold it as a symmetrical whole, a colos
orm, a gorgeous prismatic Entity., Researches into character, and
authenticity are superfluous to those who are susceptible of the psychical
logic of symbolism—I endeavour, my bon homme, to be as perspicuous
as I can. Under the same aspect the System presents itself throughout.
Medieval Architecture and Ornament are all harmonious constituents of
the One great Idea. The Costume of the Priesthood is a Westimentary
Propriety: a Toilette of Sanctity., Images are the embodiment of an
Aspiration. ...Pale emaciated. ecclesiastics, burning, tapers, devoted
virgins, paintings of enthusiastic saints rapt in graceful devotion, are all
Elements of one vast Conception. And it is merely your barbarous
ignorance of the Theory of Church-Art that has made you expend, so
much futile ribaldry on the phenomena of Rimini, not perceiving
º: Subjective Impression is as good a Miracle as an "Objective
ity.
“Inquisitions, Les Huguenots affairs, and the like, are merely the
darker shadows º required to bring out the lights and
brilliant tints of the Gran Picture. But how can you feel this,
who have no heart for , the Picturesque – the Fº Standard of
Faith, which, after all, is, but a Development of Taste. And you
cannot suffer a little Papal Aggression! ... I should think you could
tolerate anything—you, who can tolerate a dreadful clerk, who aspirates
his Amens.
“I wish you could behold the contemptuous pity which curls the
chiselled lip, and dilates the delicate nostril, of the highborn and the
beautiful, when Punch is referred to as the soulless derider of the
Pretty in its relation to the Venerable—of all that, causes the Heart to
thrillor glow, and makes the Sensitive wonder and weep.
“En vérité, mon ami, I would advise you, before going any further in
polemics, to emparer yourself of some notion of the AEsthetic Principle.
“Your disgusted reader,
“FLEUR DE BELGRAVIE.”
*** I flatter myself I know what the “aesthetic” principle is, pretty
well. ... A certain calf of gold was made once, I believe, on that “prin.
ciple.” So were various hawk-headed, and other sculptures, from
º now in the British Museum. DIANA of the Ephesians, too, I
rather think, was adored on the “aesthetic principle.” And on pre-
çisely the same “principle,” I take it, does the negro grovel before his
fétiche.—Punch.)

second pint in despair). I’d better go and see him to-night—after all.
[Erit for the Haymarket.
The Real Oldest Inhabitant.
THE proper place in which to look for the oldest inhabitant, is the
Queen's Bench, in some corner of which there seems a chance of turning
up a Chancery prisoner. A little while ago, an individual was met with,
who had been an inhabitant for nearly thirty years; and who, like the
released prisoners in “Fidelio,” was i. singing choruses outside the
walls—made drunk by the air of liberty. Surely the law owes some
little reparation to a †. who has suffered so much on account
of it; and there would be some generosity, as well as justice in making
him some amends, by bestowing upon him some pension or sinecure.
Why not give him the salary of a judge of the Queen's Bench Pfor, having
resided there nearly thirty years, he ought by this time to be a very
good judge of it.
A Light Grievance.
It is said that the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER means to modify
and only partially repeal the Window:Tax. He may be expected to see
the whole country turn out of windows, and demand, the entire
abolition of the duty; for the friends of light and air will not consent to
lose, if not all, at least half-their panes in this manner. For our
own parts, we shall protest against our views being thus thwarted by
the burden upon our windows being retained; and we say at once, that
it is no use trying to open the door to compromise. If the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer wants a substitute, let him put a further duty on
lazed boots or French ribbons; for we would rather let our wives and
i. pay more for their sashes, than that we should still pay for
our windows.

MORE ABOUT HATS.
THE voice º Punch has not been raised in vain against the abomi-
nation of the chimney-pot. -
Already we see º, side the symptoms which tell us that the
existing Hat dynasty totters to its fall. We do not take credit to our-
selves for this . The Hat was already doomed 'ere we lifted up our
báton to crush it. We have only, the merit of having gathered the
public feeling into a focus, the light flashing from which has withered
the hideous Hat of the nineteenth century. All advocacy of the Hat
on its own merits has been abandoned. Its ugliness and its inconve:
nience are admitted on all hands. “Are not, then, its days numbered?”
The candid reader will ask. -
Alas for human nature, that we must answer, “No.” To get rid of
s no one
anything established, it is not enough to prove, that it f - -
purpose that it is meant to serve. It is established. Possession is
nine points of the law; and when a thing is herº, it has, primº facie, a
good right to stay here, until forced to quit. The existing Hat will,
therefore, continue to rule till another is set up in its place. It thus
becomes the duty of all who wish well to their fellow-creatures, to
bethink themselves seriously of the head-covering that is to replace the
discarded chimney-pot. And, above all, it is, our duty, having first
given a voice to the feeling of the time on this subject, to offer our
counsel to those who are determined to throw of the intolerable
pressure of the reigning Hat.
There are two questions to be answered—
1. How is the present Hatto be dethroned?
2. What substitute for it is to be set up?
On the first we venture to º that as organisation and the
diffusion of information upset the Corn Laws, so organisation and the
diffusion of information may unseat the Hat. Let England organise
for a combined effort...Let the men of every town unite in sections
and subsections, and bind themselves over a wide-awake, on a certain
day, to throw off the yoke of the hated º: Punch offers
himself humbly, as the TELL of the movement, and, like the Liberator
of Switzerland, he will be the first to refuse any longer to bow down
before the Hat:
If 500 men in England walk out of their peaceful homes on the same
morning-let us say the 1st of May, 1851—wearing the usurping head-
cover. (what that should be remains to be considered), the old Hat is
“a dim, discrowned king.” Let corresponding Anti-Chimney-pot
Societies be founded in the Metropolis and all large towns. Let each
section have its Chief, and let the Chiefs of sections be combined into
},º: and let the Directory have a head, and let that head be
tºeſ.
The duty of the Anti-Chimney-pot Societies will be to deliberate on
the choice of a successor to the reigning Hat. The chiefs in the
different towns will correspond with each other on the subject. The
members will also, each in his own sphere, combat the notion (which is
really the only thing like an argument that we have heard urged against
a change), that because the rest of the garments worn now-a-d
are unpicturesque and inconvenient, therefore the Hat ought to
*. and inconvenient, to match coat, waistcoat, trousers,
and neckcloth. Strange reasoning, which, if we admit its premises,
refuses to correct one abuse because other abuses surround it. It is to
be answered by showing how, though the reform is to begin with the
Hat, it is not intended to stop there. Let it be pointed out how the
small end of the revolutionary wedge having once been inserted at the
head, must go on working its way through the absurd totality of modern
English male costume. But let the reformer, at the same time, deny
the premises on which this monstrous conclusion is founded; let him
showhow coat, waistcoat, and trousers may, by very slight modification,
and the exercise of no more than average good taste, be made a
sufficiently º and comfortable array, to admit of a less hideous
Hat than the present, without any incongruity. Take an easy and
well cut morning jacket, of the form no longer confined to the stable-
yard or barrack-room, but admitted alike into breakfast parlour and
counting house, or the hanging paletot, with a waistcoat, not scrimp
and tight, but long and am º and wide and well-made trousers, pf any
of the neutral-tinted woollen fabrics, that our northern looms so
prolific in; and we assert, fearlessly, that a broad-leafed and flexible
sombrero of grey, or brown, or black felt, may be worn with such a
costume, to complete a dress at once becoming and congruous; a dress
of the nature of that into which (as it is) a man gets the moment he
is at his ease and free from restraint, and a dress, moreover, which is in
every way adapted to our climate and habits.
º the weightier question remains behind, “What is the New Hat
e - --
And to this question we promise an early answer, only cautioning our
readers against surrendering their judgment to the hatters, some of
whom we observe are already parading in their windows, under the title
of “The New Hat,” an article all but as ugly, and in every respect as
inconvenient, as the existing chimney-pot; besides which, it rejoices in
the superfluous absurdity of a Feather
That would be incongruous if you like!
A Card.
THE DIRECTORs of THE South-WestERN RAILway beg to give
notice to Prize-fighters, and Noblemen, College-Students, Gentlemºn;
and all Patrons of the Ring, that the best accommodation for a “mill”
is to be found on their line. By giving a day's notice, an Express
Train will always be kept waiting for their accommodation, to convey
to and from the scene of action. Scouts are always in attendance at
every Electric Telegraph Station, in order to forward the quickest
intimation of danger; and there is an understanding amongst all the
employés of the Railway, that, in the event of any pursuit, the Fighting-
º: is to take the precedence of every other Train. Terms moderate,
and the strictest secresy may be relied upon. N.B.-A map of the
most retired spots, and a list of all the fields that are situated on the
borders of two neighbouring counties along the line, may be seen on
application at the Office.—CoRNELIus Stovin, General Manager.
A CASE OF CONSCIENCE.
A Pious butcher who had sent legs of mutton gratis in honour of St.
Pudentiana to Golden Square, asked his director whether he should
send capers likewise?. The Reverend Father commended the zeal of his
parishioner, and said that the Church of Rome was neither averse
to mutton nor to trimmings.
Good Cry for Protestants.
A consider ABLE hubbub has been raised by LADY MoRGAN's con-
troversy with CARDINAL Wisexas, about the Chair of St. PETER. As
the dispute might easily be settled by producing the article of furniture
in question, there is a striking appropriateuess, during this particular
row, of raising the cry of “Chairſ Chair!”

HIGH JINKS IN THE ETERNAL CITY.
Sit chanced, MR. SCROGGS
ad mislaid his spec-
tacles. So laying up his
heels on a stooſ before
the fire, he desired his
niece, ANGELICA, to read
the Times to him, whilst
he finished his breakfast.
“First, what’s the news
from Rome?” said the
old gentleman, with a sly
wink-partly, perhaps,
in allusion to recent
events at Rimini-aimed
at the young lady, who
had been evincing some
symptoms of Tractarian
erangement.
“Oh! such doings on
New Year's Day; so in-
teresting”—replied AN-
GELICA, and read as fol-
lows:–
“LoRD CAMPDEN, son of the
EARL of GAINsborough, and
Lady CAMPDEN, made a public
recantation of the Protestant
faith, and were received into
the Roman Catholic Church.
LoRD and LADY FEILDING,
who have also lately come
over, were present, as well as
several other persons whohave
preceded or followed their ex-
ample.”
“Hah!” exclaimed MR. Scroggs. “Trip over to Rome quite the fashion, just now, you
see, my dear. Patronised by the nobility. Up the Tiber instead of up the Rhine-hum!
* º continued Miss ANGELICA, “that Rome is crowded with English converts of all
ranks, and,
“In all public ceremonies they obtain the best places, and the Pope and the Cardinals never fail to notice
them in public.”
“Extraordinary condescension, that,” MR. Schoegs observed, “Surprising humility in Pope
and Cardinals, actually to take notice of their fellow Christians... Ought to be called, in
future, His Lowliness and their Meeknesses. Wonder if the Fisherman ever demeaned
himself so far?” . - - -
“Oh, uncle!” ejaculated ANGELICA. “Then, in the evening, there was a grand fête given
—dear me, I should so like to have seen it t-ſisten, uncle!—
“The PRINCE CARDINAL ALTIERI, President of Rome and Comarca—”
S “Prince of the Church—Prince of a kingdom not of this world!”—interrupted MR.
CROGGS.
“Opened his magnificent Palace in the Piazza del Gesu.”
“The Piazza del!—well, no need to repeat the name,” said the old gentleman, ... An
apprºpriate site, rather, for the ‘magnificent palace’ of this Prince of said Church—eh?”
‘Law, uncle!” somewhat dubiously remonstrated his niece; and proceeded:–
“Every person of consideration, foreign and native, was invited, and the numerous salons were resplendent
with beauty and diamonds.”
“Beauty and diamonds! Rather smart decorations for the drawing-rooms of a Priest
Cardinal. Gayish ornaments for the apartments of avowed bachelor,” MR. SCROGGs observed.
ANGELICA resumed:–
“Among the ladies most distinguished for personal appearance was the PRINCEss ToBLoWIA, who was literally
one blaze of jewels, many of which were said to have once belonged to the shrine of Our Lady of LoBETTO,”
: Disposed of by the former Proprietress, eh?” said MR. Scroggs.
“Oh, uncle! how can you?” cried ANGELICA; and read on:—
“A diadem, composed of brilliants and pearls, eclipsed everything in the way of ornament present, and it is
said to be not only one of the most gorgeous, but the most costly parure belonging to any private person in Europe.”
“Query, though?” MR. SCROGGs interposed. “Perhaps all that is figurative. Brilliants
and pearls mean virtues and graces, may be. Ah!—very likely.”
“Then there was the PRINCEss DoRIA, daughter of the EARL of SHREwsBURY,” con-
tinued the young lady:-
“On this occasion she produced from caskets, where they had long been hidden, the costly heirlooms of the
PAMPILI family. The value of these jewels is almost inestimable, not only on account of their intrinsic worth,
but of their historical association, as many of them are known to have belonged to the celebrated Don NA OLIMPLA
(said to be a daughter of Pope INNockNr XI.).”
“Bless his Innocence!” exclaimed MR. ScRoggs.
“Then,” proceeded Angelica,
“The PRINCEss Borghese (a Rochefoucauld) was likewise splendidly attired. The PRINCEss ALTIERI, who did
the honours for her relative the Cardinal, was also a star of the first magnitude. Her diamonds in number and
value were scarcely surpassed by those above-named.”
“There, my dear,” said MR. Schoogs, “that will do. See how fine and grand you may be,
even at a Cardinal's tea-party. Greatinducement, isn't it, to a young lady to turn Papistſ I
suppose, though, she is not to take any pleasure
in her finery—if she can help it. Must imagine
herself in rags all the time—perhaps wear a horse-
hair, what-d'ye-call-it, underneath., Renounce
the world while she figures in it—show off, and
not think how nice it is. Ah! Fancy I could
renounce port in the same way. Now, JELLY, of
course you’ll go over to Rome; but first, like a
ood girl, go and fetch me down my boots.
§. well; his Eminence, the Roman Cardinal,
had a grand party—hadn’t he? Fine court

ladies regular Queens of Diamonds. I say,

THE GLUT OF DIORAMAS.
THE plethora of Panoramic exhibitions will
certainly be too much for us at last, or we *
perhaps die of the Dioramas. Vocalists, lec-
turers, artists, and all sorts of contributors to
the entertainment of the public, seem to think
the public will entertain nothing, unless accom-
panied by a Di-a Pan—a Poly—or a Physi-
Orania. #. last thing of the kind we have heard
of, and which we expect will soon be announced,
is so absurd, that we give the world the benefit
of a “private view”—that which everybody is
invited to see, is always called a “private view”
—of the programme.

A WOICE FROM THE NATIONAL
GALLERY.
We have received the following note, upon
which we make no comment:-
“Trafalgar Square, Jan. 18th, 1851.
“THE National ºl. º its compli-
ments to Mr. Punch, and begs to say, that it
feels very keenly the abuse thrown in its face,
but must add, that it owes all the abuse it has
received to its hav i. subject to the grossest
misconstruction. Though the National Gallery
feels there is much truth in the general, opinion
that it requires taking down, the National Gallery
is by no means proud of itself; and indeed, if it
could use its wings, it would take refuge in flight
from the contempt so unkindly expressed to-
wards it. The National Gallery feels, how-
ever, some consolation in , the knowledge
that it has not been the architect of its own
misfortunes.”

BON-BONS FROM JUVENILE PARTIES.
First Juvenile. “That's A PRETTY GIRL TALKING To Young ALGERNoN BINks!”
Second Juvenile. “H.M.–Tol-Lol! You should have seen HER some seasons Ago.”
THE MODERN BEGGAR'S PETITION.
PITY, the sorrows of a poor old tramp,
Whose glimpse of plate has lº him to your door;
Who with your spoons will probably decamp,
To sell at the marine receiving store.
These tattered clothes my pilferings conceal,
When ingenuity a larder clears,
And in this pocket many a bit of veal,
Mutton, or beef, adroitly disappears.
Yon villa, standing in secluded ground,
With tempting dulness drew me from the road;
For unprotected are the inmates found
And great the distance to the next abode.
Hard is the portion of the idle poor
There as Ibullied for a bit º bread,"
A sharp policeman drove me from the door,
And took me to the station-house instead.
Oh, would that I had reach'd the vagrants' crib,
Where, in the sweets of dissipation sunk,
The flash and slang exchanging, free and glib,
I might have got felicitously drunk!
Pity the sorrows of a poor old tramp, -
hose glimpse of plate has brought him to your door;
Who with your spoons will probably decamp,
To sell at the marine receiving store.
|NONE SO BLIND AS THOSE WHO WON'T SEE.
SoMe curiosity has lately been excited by a chess-
player who has been playing three games at chess at once,
without seeing the board; and this feat, without the eyes,
has led to the bringing up of stories about other mar.
wellous players, who have gone through several games at
chess at once, in a blindfold condition.
This, however, is not the first example of the same kind
of thing; for we all know the recklessness with which
our Baronial friend NATHAN has plunged among the e
with a nightcap drawn down to his mouth for the ſast
quarter of a century. Besides, there are other games quite
as intricate as chess, that people are in the habit of play-
ing at blindfold; and we need not go further back than
the most recent, history, for the examples of states-
men—or rather ministers—who have played the game of
politics, while utterly refusing to open their eyes to
anything.
A REMEDY FOR TOO MUCH PHYSIC.
-
“ANTI-DRENCH,” in the Times, complains grievously of “The
Doctors.”. He says:— .
“Ever since the case before the Chief Baron, where 5s. a visit was recovered, each
little, smooth, dapper, quick, pompous “medical attendant’ thinks himself under-paid,
unless he screws out that amount per visit, charged in the shape of medicine, or not,
at the choice of ‘the patient.’”
MR. ANTI-DRENCH has evidently had a long and, probably, exorbitant
doctor's bill to pay this Christmas; and is t erefore to be excused for
speaking rather irreverently of medical practitioners—the worst paid
and the most useful of the learned professions. If the majority of them
are dwarfish, sycophantic, ridiculously nimble and consequential, the
fault is, the public's; the supply is produced by the demand; and a
Squeamish imbecile flunkeyism must § very prevalent among patients.
invalids were generally magnanimous and sensible, surgeon-apothe-
caries, would be unpretending, deliberate, independent, and very
ossibly six feet º without their boots. However, the small and
pper type of his class, according to ANTI-DRENCH,
“Deems himself the only judge of the number of visits to be paid, and by way of
favour will say, ‘Oh! I will charge you only 3s.6d. But, of course, if two of your
family require attendance, I charge for each;' and he takes care by extra visits, if by
no other way, to stick on at one end what he cuts off at the other.”
And then the men of medicine
“Come and gossip with mamma and the nurse while 'master' is away on his business,
duly entering the visit as professional, or doubly so if the baby has a little cold in its
eye, or CHARLEY's tooth has been making him cross.”
The result of this kind of practice is, at the end of the year,
“A bill for two or three times one's income-tax, at least, on us poor working scrubs
of 300!, or 400l. per annum. And what have we got for it, except a feeling that, some-
how, though none of us have been in any the least danger—thank God—yet we have
been always.ailing, and some 150 visits have been paid in the course of the year to -
keep us well,—or rather to keep us ill, one would think?”
And ANTI-DRENCH asks the Times,
“What am I to do, Sir, to keep the doctor from paying four visits, when one would do,
to lighten the fears of mamma 2 I expect no good from changing, besides having to
stand the domestic hints that “Mr. A. is such a clever person, and ‘so much more
agreeable,’” &c. -
ANTI-DRENch may do these things:–
In the first place, let him sternly dismiss the practitioner who is “so
much more agreeable.” A doctor ought to be disagreeable—as his
physic is, and for the same reason. Natureº: drugs an ill taste to
prevent us from taking too much of them. Not that a medical man is
to be coarse, or rude; but he will be quite “disagreeable” enough to
ºne." if, however kind and gentle, he is a manly, straightforward
OW.
In the next place, let him pay his medical man liberally for necessary
attendance, that he may not tempt him to pay himself by attending
oftener than is needful.
Thirdly, let him take the pains to get up that general knowledge of
medicine, without which it is impossible to distinguish between a
quack and a true physician, or to know whether a doctor is wanted or
not; and without which, moreover, nobody has a right to have either a
wife or a family, unless he is prepared to pay for the consequences.
Thus will ANTI.DRENCH avert that yeterinary treatment to which his
name expresses an objection, but which the amount of his medical
knowledge might perhaps almost deserve. -

“Now, MARM, THIs goes to THE CHRISTIAL PALſs.”
“Bless THE MAN! I Don’t want No CHRISTIAL PALISEs. IAMA-gon to THE Boro’.”
THE MICE OF SCOTLAND.—A PANIC !
“MR. PUNCH,
“THERE is a two-legged, Scotch economist—the newspapers
call him "a gentleman in Kirkaldy’—who has invented an infernal
machine by which a couple of mice can be made to ‘spin cotton yarn.”
The cost and profit have been calculated with a nicety worthy of the
arithmetical spirit of ADAM SMITH. “A couple of mice’—(are the
couple to be a pair, or are pairs to be separated in the mouse-mill, as in
the Christian Unions?)—may “make atonement to society for past
offences by reeling from 100 to 126 threads per day.” By this, it
would appear that infant mice are not to be º : inasmuch as,
being up to a certain * guiltless of wrong, they have no evil to atone
for; an improvement, I must allow, upon the old cotton-mill system
that used up babyhood. But listen to the calculation, the sum total
of which has warmed the heart's blood of the gentleman in Kirkaldy,
warmed it like his morning porridge :-
“‘To complete this [the 126 threads], the little pedestrians have to run 104 miles.
A halfpenny worth of oatmeal, at 1s. 3d. per peck, serves one of these treadwheel
culprits for the long period of five weeks. In that time it makes 110 threads per day.
At this rate a mouse earns 7s. 6d. per annum. Take off 5d. for board, and 1s. for
machinery, there will arise 6s, clear for every mouse annually.'
“Pretty profits, these, to the musocrat, arn’t they?—and sweetly illus-
trative of a certain school of commerce that allows at the rate of five-
pence for the workman, and one shilling for machinery, the while the
master pockets more than four hundred per cent. profit from the
transaction?
“In what place did this gentleman of Kirkaldy light upon this wisdom?
Was it inspiration from the Minories? After this, what mouse in a
Scotch mill would not change its condition with a church mouse?—nay,
when I reflect upon the increased number of candles used now-a-days
in certain churches, a mouse ecclesiastical may have a very jolly
berth of it.
“But the thing is to be done upon a grand scale. There is to be a sort
of Mouse Palace, in order that—as in the Minories and elsewhere—
the extreme of pinching may be associated with the extreme of
vastness.
“‘The mouse employer was going to make an application for the lease of an old
empty house, which would hold 10,000 mouse mills, sufficient room being left for keepers
aud some hundreds of spectators.'
“Now, ten thousand mills employing ten thousand mice, and every
mouse returning, over the cost of oatmeal, and machinery, six shillings
per, annum profit, returns to the humble capitalist sixty thousand
shillings—otherwise, three thousand pounds per year. A very sweet
illustration of the rights of certain capital invested in certain ſabours.
How many men may think themselves not a bit better than mice!
“But, Mr. Punch, may I-as one of the cats of England—ask you if
Scotland intends to employ all her mice—and depend upon it, with the
yiew of six shillings a yeap profit upon each mouse, there will not be a
Scotch man, woman, or inſant, who will not set a mouse-trap, even if
baited with the last pinch of oatmeal,—may I ask you, Sir, with all
the mice of Scotland earning the food, and clothing, and pocket-money
of the Scotch people, may I ask what is to become of Scºtch cats;
WOL. XX.
A WARNING FOR FATHERS.
A, a father, leaves B, his daughter, £1600.
C, a, spendini, (and something more,) falls in
love with the £1600 of B. -

before her marriage entrusts to Capower of attorney
over the aforesaid £1600.
=|| C immediately squanders upon D, a harpy demi-
ºf rep, no less than £1480 out of the £1000!
- WARNING To FATHERs.-If you have money to
leave to daughters, so tie it upon them that even
they themselves cannot untie it. Protect them from
the credulity of their own affections, and the beggary
that may ensue.

intere
Punch, from the time of the Fall, mice have been our vested
And I ask you, if our natural victims are to be unmercifully
snatched from our claws to earn, every 9ne mouse of them, six shillings
English !?. every Scotchman,--I ask you what is to remunerate
us cats for our vital loss? Why, Sir, in six weeks—nay, six days–
there will not be a mouse throughout the length and breadth, and, what
is much more, the depth § Scotland, that is not shut up in a Scotch
mill, earning the daily bread of a Scotch owner. A cat in Scotland
might as we hope to catch an ermine as a grey mouse—whether house,
or field, or shrew-mouse—that shall not be sweating its 10% miles per
diem, on its half-pennyworth of oatmeal per five weeks
“Nor will the tyranny—the avaricious tyranny of Scotch gentlemen—
end with helpless mice. No, Mr. Punch : having secured mouse-
woven cotton, depend upon it some gentleman in Peebles will start a
patent for spider-spun silk. I have no doubt that—with mouse-cotton
in the market—every Highlander will speedily sport a pair of pantaloons
of the very finest web, the original yarn woven in the rafters of his own
paternal halls, and elaborated from the mourishment supplied by his
own clan blue-bottles. - -
“Dear Mr. Punch, elevate your voice against this tyranny. Save the
mice of Scotland from the oatmeal calculation of the musocrat. For
myself, who am an English cat, and living in a high Puseyite family
distinguished for its rigorous dinners of john-dory, turbot, salmon and
smelts in their respective seasons—(‘what cat’s averse to fish?')—for
myself, I say, whether Scotch mice grow grey in Scotch cotton-mills
or fall in natural course within the jaws of Scotch grimalkins, f
can have no personal interest: but I have a proper feeling for
the rights of mice, and I hope I have a due admiration of the
probity, the energy, and the enterprise of the Scotch people. And it is
upon their account I ask you to stand between their hopes of lucre–
this mouse-mill mania—and themselves. For with the fascinating lure
of six shillings profit per annum, the whole population-there can be
no doubt of the alarming fact—will forego their sober habits of certain
commerce, and madly throw themselves upon a mouse-trap. Depend
upon it, what railways have been to England, mouse-cotton mills will
be to devoted Scotland.
“As for Scotch mice, let them one and all make for the Tweed and
swim it. There is not one of them, though of the smallest, that shall
not receive a hearty welcome
“From your's, Mr. Punch,
“The Mews,” “PUSS-IN-BLUCHERs.”
Punch's House Protector,
THE recent great increase of burglaries in the rural districts has
suggested an invention to Mr. Punch for the protection of life and pro-
perty from housebreakers, which he hereby generously communicates to
the Public. The details of the contrivance are very simple. Strings
and wires are laid down in the premises as in setting spring guns. Any
one of these, on being touched, displaces a weight, which, in falling,
explodes a detonating ball, ignites a blue light, sets going an alarum
beil, opens a kennel, and lets loose any given number of large dogs,
trained to hold fast without biting.

PICTURES FOR THE EXHIBITION OF INDUSTRY.
THE Great Exhibition of Industry will not be complete without an addition
which Punch proposes to make to it. An exhibition of manufactures and commodi-
ties, is not an exhibition of Industry, but only of the results of it. A real exposition
of Industry would require that the INDustRious themselves should be exhibited as
well as their productions. In a glass hive we ought to show the bees at work.
However, as needlewomen cannot be starved, nor tailors “sweated,” nor miners
blown up, amongst a multitude of people, with any degree of safety, it is suggested
that paintings of our various artizans, labouring in their usual vocations, shoul
accompany the display of the substances and fabrics which we owe to the labour
or ingenuity of the respective classes. Pictorial art might thus be brought to
make appropriate contributions to the world's Bazaar. Shall we, ostentatiously
show off all manner of articles of comfort and luxury, and be ashamed to disclose the
condition of those whom we have to thank for them?

existence of a cattle-market in the centre of Christendom. Another bull, of the

Pontiff will persist in asserting his “vested interests,” to the annoyance of his

necessary to seek redress by an action for damages.

G. F. YOUNG’S NIGHT THOUGHTS.
ball "--, 1A.I. SELF-PRESERVATION is the first
------ law of Nature, and Protection
is the second; or rather as pre-
serving one’s-self, and protect-
ing one’s-self, are precisely one
and the same thing, I may say
that Protection is the First
Law of Nature, and ought con-
sequently to be the First Law
of the Land, and I am deter-
mined it shall be so.
There is no wealth without
agriculture. No country can
have a Cornucopia, unless corn
is at the top of everything.
The best way of talking figu-
ratively, is to use plenty of
figures. Probably the reason
why we Protectionists cut such
very bad figures at all public
meetings, may be owing to the
very careless manner in which
we handle them P But there
is one consolation left me. that
if ourarguments are individual y
weak, no one can deny they are
not numerically strong.
I don’t ...? like the ridicule
that is thrown upon the cause
of Protection. Since corn has
been taken out of our mouths,
we have been treated with no-
- thing but chaff.
There is no carpet bag half so squeezable as a Farmer's mind; for on my word it will take in as
much as you like to cram it with, and even then it will stand gaping for more.
I have got to speak again to-morrow. The old, speech must be rubbed up again, . But really it
has been rubbed up so often, that I am afraid the public will begin to find out its real value, and to
discover that, after all, I am only exhibiting before them a spoon of the commonest Britannia mettle.
As this is the year of the Exhibition, we must do something on a large scale to make a great show of
ourselves. It is rather unfortunate, talking of shows, the intimate connection there is in the public mind
between a Protectionist Meeting and a Cattle. Show. . This identification I am sure, has done us a
deal of harm; and I have often thought of writing up in the place of our meeting—“No CoNNExion
witH THE CATTLE Show NExT Door.”

OPEN HOUSE AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
“To Joseph PAxton, Esq. (favoured by MR. PUNCH.)
“SIR,-My name is MoB, that is Young MoB-son of OLD MoB—and, as the better-behaved son
of a wild and ignorant father, I beg leave to thank you, MR. PAxton, for asking LORD JoHN RUSSELL
to throw open the Crystal Palace to be seen by me for nothing; for I do assure †. I am very much
reformed, and iº. better behaved than my relations of the good old times, who used to kick up
a rumpus, going about like a swinish multitude that wanted rings in their noses, and wooden collars
about their necks.
“When I say my name is YoUNG Mob, I ought further to say that I am also called MAsses—YouNG
MAsses—by some people; and further known and received as MAsses alias MILLION, let me refer
to the ‘superior classes’ for my true character in all public places, to show, that I may—with very
little .*. after—be as well trusted in your Palace, MR. Paxtos, as in the British Museum, the
National Gallery, or in Kew Gardens. - -
“Am I not seen with my wife and children wondering at MR, LAYARD's Nineveh Marbles—wondering
uietly, and I will add, if you please, reverently? Have I, in fact, chipped the nose of any statue?
#. ſwrenched the little finger from any mummy? Have I pocketed a single medal? Have I dog's-
eared a single volume to be found where I have free entrance in the British Museum ? -
“Do I scratch RAPHAEL in the National Gallery, or poke my finger through Cuyp's cows?... Do
I not pay decent homage to CoRREGGIo? and do I mock at the light and darkness of REMBRANDT *
“Do } trample the flowers in the enclosure of St. James's Park? Do I – (as I fear some of my
ancestors might have done)—do I pelt the black swan or the Solan goose as sanguinary foreigners?
“What injury have I committed in Kew Gardens? Show me the twig I have broken, the bud
I have crushed.
“Well, then, I put it to you, MR. PAxton, whether you have not in my amended conduct a guarantee
for my civil and peaceable behaviour in your Glass Palace. The same better feeling that respects
the wonders of antiquity, will respect, the greater wonders of our times. If I know how to behave
myself in the British Museum, shall I become a brute and a savage when under your roof, and enclosed
by your walls of Crystal? - -
“Of course there are of my family—for the MAsses are a legion—thousands not admissible into the
British Museum, Kew Gardens, the National Gallery, and so forth—no, not even into St. Paul's Church,
by paying twopence for it. There are who belong to me, the idle, the dirty, the foul-mouthed, and the
ged. "Let these be driven from the Crystal, Gates; but I cannot understand why, if the British
Wºm and the National Gallery be º to the decent members of my family, the Crystal Palace

LITERATURE UNDER GROUND.
WE, sometimes hear of the ignorance
ºliº among, those who work in
ines, but if they can understand
what is written about their own ope-
rations, they are much cleverer fellows
than we took them for. It will be
necessary to dive, or dig very deep
down indeed, for the meaning of the
following piece of Mining intelligence,
which we have extracted from a morn-
1ng-paper:-
“At Borrington Park Mine they have cleared
the run in the adit level, and forked the water
in the shaft, and are expected to hole to the
adit early next week.”
We do not affect to be very stupid
but we really must admit our blesse
ignorance as far as the meaning of
this paragraph is concerned. “They”
—who are “they P” to begin with—
“have cleared the run”— what’s a
“run” ”—“in the aditlevel”—what’s
an “adit?”—and forked the water
into the shaft.” Now, we have heard
of “forking out,” but “forking in * is
a process we do not so easily compre-
hend, particularly when water is the
article upon which the operation of
“forking” has been performed. Our
ideas of dealing with water, are more
.#. to us of spoons than forks,
and having, therefore, become com.
pletely puzzled by what we have read,
we have no comprehension left for the
remaining words, announcing the ex-
pectation that “they” will “hole to
the adit early next week.” In this
hole we find ourselves helplessly stuck
and we shall feel very much obliged
to any one learned in the language
of mining, if he will lend us a hand and
pull us out of it.
A Fine Opening for a Novelist.
WE see a new book advertised under
the title of The Stones of Penice. We
think an ºl." companion to it
might be published under the name of
The Stones of London. Only think of
the immensity of the materialſ for not
a day passes—what with the gas and
the water companies, and the Commis-
sioners of Sewers, and the innumerable
Boards of Paving—but what something
is sure to turn up in Fleet-Street, or
one of the principal streets of our
rising metropolis. But then, again,
the incidents would be so numerous
that we doubt strongly, if a stupen-
dous work like The Stones of London
were once begun, whether it could
ever be brought to a close.
Some
fresh opening would be breaking out
every hour, in some fresh place—so,
upon a second view of the subject, we
think it far too deep for us to advise
any young novelist to drop into it.
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF STATE
EDUCATION?
EDUCATION is derived from Educere,
to bring forth
only thing which
forth, is the total incapacity of the State
to educate the People; and the utmost
it draws out is a miserable sum of
something like £30,000 a year, for no
other purpose, apparently, than that of
proving the above incapacity.—By One

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S SERMONS TO TRADESMEN.
TO THE GROCER.
“A grocer is a man who buys and sells sugar, and plums, and spices, for
galn.”—WATTs.
HAPPY is the grocer who, among this congregation of England's
grocers, can lay his hand upon his commercial heart, and making answer
to the text, can say—“I am the man.”
For of the men who take over unto their shop-doors, the name of
grocer, how many are there who buy and sell sugar, and sugar º:
who turn the penny upon spices in their purity, vending nought but the
true mace—the undoctored clove?
Great is the villainy of the Chinese; but it is written in certain books
of the working chemist, that the roguery of the Englishman—bent, it
may be, upon the means of respectability on wheels, namely, a final
country-box with a gig–may outblush the pale face of the Tartar
trickster. The Chinaman glazes his tea with #. blue; he paints
his Congon, and adds a perfume to his Twankay; but he—the pigtailed
heathen-does not recognise in an English attorney a man and a
brother; and in his limited sympathies fails to acknowledge in any
British maiden, of any fabulous age soever, a woman and a sister. The
China teaman is a benighted barbarian: the British grocer is an effulgent
Christian. The Chinaman's religion is the gust of revenge; the Briton's
creed is the creed of common love.
We can, if we endeavour it, drop a tear over the ignorance of the
Chinaman who dusts his faded tea-leaves with chromate of lead; but
shall not our eyes flash fire at the enlightened British tea-dealer who
to the withered leaf imparts the mortal glow of plumbago? Never-
theless, there are grocers in the commercial form of men, who treat the
stomachs of their customers, as their customers treat their stoves;
namely, they bestow upon their internals the questionable }*. O
black lead, innocently swallowed in cups of liquid, worse and blacker
than the Lacedaemonian black broth. How many an innocent tea-loving
spinster, proud of the jetty loveliness of her fireplace, would acknow-
ledge a spasm of horror could she know that the polish of her own
stove and the bloom of her own black tea, fragrant and smoking at her
lips, were of one and the same black lead; .#. that in due suffici-
ency is akin to coffin-lead?. And the English grocer, intent upon
deceit, outvies—say the chemists—the teaman of the flowery kingdom.
“There is not a toss-up between the Chinaman and the Englishman,”
says the grave and quaint Berzelius; “and if there be, though China
beats by a tail, England fails not to win by a head.”
Secondly, we come to coffee. Perhaps there is not a more touching,
a more instructive, and withal a more pathetic picture than either man
or woman complacently employed in drinking what the drinker, in pro-
foundest innocence, believes to be coffee—bargain coffee at one shilling
per pound ! Now a wizard, yelept Norman Dy, has taken a pound, a
nominal bound of this coffee; and with an analytic touch has resolved
the pound into these component parts of pence and profit:—
lb. of Coffee, at 1s. 2d. per lb. - - - - . 0s. 7d.
lb. of Chicory, at 4d. per lb. . . - - - - 0 2
he Grocer's profit . . - - - - 0 3
1 lb of Adulterated Coffee . . . - - - - . . 1s. 0d.
And the dupe swallows his bargain of half-a-pound of coffee, qualified
with half-a-pound of that rogue's root chicory, for—one shilling! How
his stomach glows with economy; and how the grocer rubs his hands-
brightened with copper profit, value threepence! And how sweet it is
to know that here, in merry England, are acres and acres of chicory—
that, be it understood, is not poison; nothing but mere lumber to the
internal man—acres, wherein the pious grocer, like the patriarch, may
“walk forth to muse at eventide.”
Thirdly, we speak of chocolate—of seeming chocolate that, entering
the cupboard of the unwary, carries with it damnifying potato-starch—
ground cocoa-nut shells-old sea-biscuits—brick-dust—and, to give it
richness, animal fat!
The baby, “with the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,” is
the helpless victim of the unjust grocer, and swallows with its arrow-
root—potato-starch. -
And honey, the º of innocence and goodness, eyen, honey is cor-
rupted, debased with a mixture of chalk; which, in, the rash judg-
ment of the ignorant, might make the industrious bees obnoxious
to the charge of mixing the blossoms of the field with the milk-scores
of the door-post.
And to conclude; for the sugar of the unjust grocer—if you would
count its many impurities, you must number—at least a few million of
them—the sands on the sea-shore.
And Punch commands this felon grocer—if he be among the present
congregation—to take in his hand an imaginary cup of imaginary
adulterated coffee, then of chocolate, then of tea, sweetened with false,
imaginary sugar. Come, culprit-gulp the tea, plumbago and all.
There : now give the cup a twist; and with what remains in it, aſter
the mode of silly maids, and sillier old women, read your fortune; to
you, however, a true, and fearful prophecy. Give Punch the cup.
es; here is your destiny—your conscience in the after-day, when wit
the alchemy of the counter you shall have turned black-lead into gold,
and, as you believe it, made the sands of the sugar the sands of
Pactolus. Here, is your destiny, thick in the grounds. The coffee
shows chicory to be the root of “Lethe's wharf; ” the chocolate gives
brick-dust, certain sign of an early vault; the tea, plumbago, unques-
tionable indication of a leaden shell; whilst the sands from the sugar
tell of the running glass of Time; and every grain of sand-oh, adul.
terate grocer h-bids you henceforth to eschew chicory, brick-dust,

A POLICE CASE.
(In the manner of MR. L– H-.)
SIR Foward SUGDEN, in September last,
#. Chancellor of Ireland in days past,
anted a Butler—and the place to gain
Came to the learned Knight, one MoRRIs LANE.
All things that a good servant should or can
Do, LANE said he could. He was a single man:
And gave as reference for his qualities all,
SIR Jacob PRESTON, Bart., of Beeston Hall,
With whom he, LANE, had lived for four good year.
And if SIR Edward wished more news to hear,
SIR JAcob PRESTON would the Knight enlighten, -
Who was staying at the Bedford Hotel, in the City of Brighton.
SIR. Edwańn straightway to SIR J Acob wrote,
And presently got in answer this here note.
Brighton, September,
SIR JAcoB PREston presents
To SIR. E. SUGDEN his best compliments,
And has the honour to inform SIR. E.,
That MoRRIs LANE as butler lived with me.
While in my service as butler and valet, LANE
Never gave his master reason to complain:
e left my service at his own request, -
Wishing to return to Town, for reasons to him known best.
Doubting about the style of the note in parts
º: style not being the forte of all our Barts.)
evertheless SIR Edward did retain
The proffered service of this MoRRIs LANE.
And to the good Knight's Mansion of Boyle Farm
SIR EDward took his man, not deeming of harm,
Where LANE, to the other servants, loved to recal
Stories of Old Sir jacon and Beeston Hali.
Learned SIR Edward soon had to complain
Of this new butler and valet, MoRRIs LANE.
And with some difficulty and distress
Sent MoRRIs LANE about his business.
The fellow gone, SIR. Edward heard with pain
This wifeless, childless, bachelor MoRRIs LANE,
Had a wife and five or six children of his own
Residing in the neighbourhood of town.
Resolved to unveil the man's iniquities all
SIR. Edward SUGDEN wrote to Beeston Hall,
And quick received a letter, in good part
Writ by SIR Jacob PREston, of Beeston, Bart.,
In which the worthy Baronet did explain
He never knew such a fellow as Morris LANE.
Resolved the dark conspiracy to trace,
SIR. Edward found out MoRRis's hiding-place,
And before the beaks at Kingston-on-Thames had up
This Traitor of the side-board and the cup.
Him guilty straight the beaks unanimous found,
And fined the treacherous villain twenty pound,
Which, of course, as he cannot pay, he will
Have three months labour at the Guildford Mill.
Thus, although rascals flourish for a Time,
Sharp lawyers and sharp law do vanquish Crime.
The Mining Mania.
TheRE seems to be some reason for fearing that the speculation mania
has only been driven inwards, as far as railways are concerned, to burst
out with reference to mines, just as in Southern climes. The elevation
of one volcano has been attended by the breaking out of another in
the neighbourhood. , Mines are now in the ascendant, and though the
madness has not yet become quite so universal as the Railway mania of
1846, it is still a fearful symptom, when we hear that somebody is talking
of opening a H. of ground in Southwark, for mining purposes, in
consequence of the great value of the shares in the Burra Burra.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 49
A FAULT EVIDENTLY ON THE SURFACE.
HE Daily News informs us that
the silver coinage of the present
reign has been considerably worn,
caused by “too much relief in
the dies.” . We cannot help
thinking that “too much relief.”
as certainly been given; for
when we recollect the number
of our coins that were no sooner
struck, than, they were struck
down, being killed almost before
their circulation began, we must
say that “too much relief.” has
unquestionably been given in the
“dying” department. Amongst
the Deaths at the Mint, we
have to record the following:-
“THE HALF-FARTHING-Died, at the
age of three months, deeply regretted
by the shareholders of the Lyceum
Theatre, the Bondholders of the Spa-
mish Government, &c., &c., &c.
º “The Floans.—Died, it is supposed,
º from defective circulation; or killed, it
- is rumoured by many lovers of the
Ring, from the very bad milling it re-
ceived at the hands of the mint.
“The small Half-sovereign-It
died at a very early age, unknown, unseen, unrespected by a single person; for, like
the donkey, or the post-boy, it was never seen, or known, how it died.
“THE CRown Piece.-Died, from having outlived its means, for it was found, after
it had been struck, that it could not live at the rate of five shillings, but lost twopence
upon every piece it disposed of.”
But as the faults at the Mint, we are told, exist—unlike many
other faults for which the Government is answerable—only on the
surface,” it is to be hoped they will soon be remedied. Besides
there are not many Government officers against which the complaint
ean be raised of “too much relief.” When will such a cry, for instance,
be uttered respecting our Union Workhouses?
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
“MR, PUNCH,

WHEN, a man is out of spirits—he

Enough To EAT. A. HARLEQUIN
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT OF ST. ANDREW’S.
We are told that the Roman ladies have an antipathy to roses., Why,
then, may not the sensitive authorities of the parish of St. Andrew's,
Holborn, have an allowed abhorrence of oranges; that is, oranges in
the baskets of men, women, and children, who may audaciously endea-
vour to vend that forbidden fruit on Sundays? MR. JAMEs, clerk to the
arish Union, is an eloquent defender of the sanctity of the Sabbath, and
scribed in burning words the offence of the orange-vendors, who were
in the habit of standing two or three together, “and surely,” said the
emphatic JAMEs, rounding a peroration of crushing power, “surely that
is an obstruction l’” But MR. CoMBE, the magistrate of Clerkenwell,
no doubt to the amazement of JAMEs, made answer—“Certainly not.”
MR. JAMEs, however, has studied the philosophy of obstruction in its
many highway phases; hence, he declared that “to congregate and
carry baskets was an obstruction.” MR. Combe again said—“Oh no.”
Taking breath, JAMEs dashed upon obstruction in hypothesis:-
“IF a man should carry a large skeleton load on his head—[What is a skeleton load?
May it be a Clerk to an §º. that would be an obstruction!”
And again MR. CoMBE cried—“Oh no!”
Then stept forth a St. Andrew's overseer, and he avowed that “the
calling out of oranges on Sundays was an intolerable nuisance.” N
doubt of it, Mr. Overseer. Sunday fruit ought to be Dead Sea apples,
silently vended by tradesmen in sackcloth. Oranges, as foreigners, are
prone to desecrate the English Sabbath. And yet, to the horror of the
represented parish of St. Andrew’s, MR. CoMBE said—“They may call
oranges all over the country, if they like.” Well:—
“A little girl, 12 years of age, who had been locked up all night, was charged with
laying down her basket of oranges in Leather Lane.
“Several other children were charged under similar circumstances,
discharged, with a caution.”
No, reader—it is not a printer's error. You must not read “they
were all discharged with a crown.” But “with a caution;” and is not
good advice better than silver or gold? They were cautioned never
again to lay down their baskets; but to carry them continually, fixed
to them; fast as wens; wicker of their wicker.
They were all
As for the ". little girl of 12 years of age; we hope that her
dreams in the police station—that is, if she managed to cry herself to
| sleep—brought with them salutary warnings for future conduct. There
is a very imaginative drama-Tre Aranci—The Three Oranges, written
by Gozzi, in which all sorts of fairies are made to issue from the ex-
panding fruit. We wonder if any kind of fairy visited the sleeping
riºt, aged 12, locked up for “laying down her basket!” in Leather
e
ane :
Possibly, yes. It may be that, the Parish, Presence of St. Andrew
—duly personified—haunted her sleep. The shaven head of St. Andrew
changed for the nonce. Not the awful head of a Clerk talking oranges;
but another sort of head familiar in tavern larders, and holding in its
foolish mouth the significant lemon. -
Truly the Parish of St. Andrew's has earned a right to quarter both
the head and the fruit." -
The Ministerial Crisis in France.
EveRY week, and indeed almost every post, brings us a new crisis from
Paris. If, France could send us her eggs as fresh as she does her
Ministerial Crisis, we should regard the former as something better
than those “musty precedents,” which always come to our mind, when-
ever we take up one of the ostensibly new laiders from Ostend. We
are getting heartily tired of a French Ministerial Crisis, which is now
getting as stale to us as the announcement in Macbeth, that the cry is
still “They come,” though with respect to the Ministerial Crisis, the bur-
den of every one of the cries is stilſ “They are going out.”
THE HOLY SEE-DAN.
THERE is one particular respecting St. PETER's (so called) chair at
Rome, which we are enabled confidently to communicate to our readers,
whom we hope it, may satisfy, especially WIsºm AN, if Punch has the
honour to be still the occasional “companion, of his railway journey.”
In however fine a state of preservation may be the relic, generally, it
certainly has not a leg to stand upon.

THE hour of six has sounded from near and distant tower,
The gas-lights glitter glaringly, the clouds of evening lour,
A thousand wagging tongues are heard two thousand ears to tell,
An eminent tragedian is taking his farewell.
The clatter of the cab-horse, with iron-bounded feet,
Rings noisily and rapidly on the stone-coated street;
Right onward to the Haymarket the cabmen fiercely drive,
Where coronetted carriages continually arrive.
The proudly prancing charger the cosy Brougham draws;
The clever hack the pavement with restless hurry paws;
The cob, with perseverance, up to the collar keeps,
With early opportunity into the rank he creeps.
But it is not in the carriage way the battle must be fought,
'Tis where the entrance of the pit is desperately sought;
Where voices, which by infancy or age are rendered shrill,
Raise the loudshrieko “oranges,” or scream “Who'll buy a bill?”
A crowd is round the portal—tremendous is the crush—
All summoning their prowess up to bear th’ expected rush;
The nimble youth, the stalwart man, the veteran bent with age,
Following their favourite actor as he quits for aye the stage. "
And now the door is opening—a movement stirs the mass,
The beating heart prepares to brave the fury of thedº
Some, for a moment quailing, would, if they could, draw back;
Hopeless is extrication from the close-knitted pack.
'Tis terrible advancing-impossible retreat,
Who would the impending avalanche venture to turn and meet?
The only chance of safety is on with it to go,
When once the torrent, with a roar, begins its forward flow.
How terrible the struggle, how furious the tide-
How sharply Johnson's elbow digs into Thomson's side—
How vehemently ToMkINs for air and mercy calls—
How hopelessly’neath fifty feet the hat of JENKINs falls—
How many lose their temper!. SMITH, of the fiery brain,
Bids Hobson of the overcoat “not to do that again.”

Comes down, not over fairy-like, on the Edwarplan toes.
The outward opening is past—the struggle still is rife,
The money-taker's box is now the goal of death or life; .
Once miss the small arch'd opening, and all has been in vain,
For hopeless is the effort to reach that box again;
The wretched individual can only watch the tide,
Directed by the checktaker to please “to stand aside.”
But happy are the buffeters, with all their trials past,
To take their places in the pit, and see the play at last;
While mutual urbanity is rapidly regained,
Andall the little brusqueries of #. pit-pass explained.
Johnson extends to Thomson the playbill to peruse,
And ToMKINs tells to JENKINs the last dramatic news.
SMITH, of the fiery temper, towards Hobson blandly cools,
And volunteers the avowal that “hasty men are fools.”
PITT, of the Poncho wrapper, will condescend to read
The playbill kindly lent by Cook—him of the guinea tweed.
And Edwańps—with the bunions—no longer fury, feels
At Jones's heavy highlows—those of the iron heels.
All other sentiments are still'd, except the sad delight
Caused by the interest that’s felt in that eventful night,
When the great actor unimpair’d snatches from Time his power,
And gallantly anticipates his own departing hour.
A PLEA FOR A LIBELLED INDIVIDUAL.
A GENERAL order has been issued, that newspapers are no longer to
be read during business hours in any Government Office.
|
When we
recollect the time-honoured fiction, t at the only work done in the
course of the day at any Government Office was the labour of reading
the newspaper, it becomes painful to contemplate what will become of
the above numerous class of such employés, now that they have been
thrown so suddenly out of work. These poor fellows will be driven, in
their despair, to fly-killing, when flies are in season, or playing at pitch-
and-toss, as long as they have anything to pitch-and-toss with, or else
they should be allowed to shell peas for the salesmen of Covent Garden,
or roll-up pills for Holloway, in order to keep their hands employed.
It must either come to this, or novel reading—or, worse still, novel-
writing will be one of the fearful consequences of their idleness." And
when we consider the reams of temptation for the latter that lie
within their reach, in the shape of
supplied to them ad libiţum, we do think that every encouragement
should be given to enable their weak minds to withstand the snares of
fashionable literature, and so strengthen them from rushing blindly into
the absurdities of 3 vol. print. They might be cmployed on the Museum
Catalogue, or on the Census, or be enlisted as a gentlemanly body of
Police—a superior corps of honour—for the Crystal Palace. -
Upon second thoughts, however, we do not think the public mind
nºbe much alarmed upon the subject. Our own fears, we confess
are very small—so small, indeed, that we do not think any remedy need
be devised for the evil complained of. The abolition of the newspaper,
after all, is no great cruelty; for it is a long time since it has been
unfolded in any Government office. The Government Clerk of the
present day is a very different being to the Government Clerk of ten or
fifteen years ago. He is compelled to work. He does not stand gaping
when spoken to, or beginF. his filbert mails directly he is asked for
anything. He is expected to work; and if his work does not come up
to the expectations of his superiors, he is very quickly shown the door
—and the door of a Government office, when once closed, never opens
again. His salary is very insignificant, and his speed of promotion so
extremely slow, that but very few live to take more than one or two
steps in their monotonous lifetime.
The highest grade of government clerks are extremely well paid-
but the lowest ºf: class who are supposed to read the news-
papers—are paid very little better than a copying-clerk in a lawyer's
office, and are looked after much more, severely. The old breed of
government clerk, who used to divide his time between reading the
per and washing his hands, is extinct, and is now replaced by an in-
#. scribbling, meanly-paid clerk whose hands are always too
busy, even to poke the fire. -
The above fiction has existed long enough, and it is time that it
should be universally known that a government clerk really does work.

WANTED A GOVERNESS BY A “SMALL FAMILY.”
E have had our attention
} called to an advertise-
ment which *}. ap-
peared in the Times,
thus commencing :-
ANTFD, in a small
quiet family, a person
about 30 years of age,
Nursery and HOUSE
MAID. She must be good
tempered and orderly, have
some experience as a Nurse,
and a good Needlewoman.
An active, pious ºrson,
would find this a comfortable
situation. The duties are
not heavy, the children being
out of the Nursery in the day
time. Thesalary:13 a-year.
There is great com-
fort in a good servant.
It is worth at least £13
yearly wages. Sothink
the heads of the “small
and quiet”—possibly
“pious”—family, who
would give the labourer
his hire, of course,
Stay: the advertisement proceeds:-
“In the same family a Young Lady is wanted to assist in the care and education of
three little girls, between the ages of four and seven."
If £13 a year shall be given for washing children and scrubbing floors,
how much for cultivating the youthful intellect, and forming the
juvenile mind? Answer—by the advertisement, continued:-
“Accomplishments are not required; but she must write a good hand, and work well
at the needle. As opportunity would be afforded for improvement, it is thought that
board, and washing, with £5 pocket-money, would be a fair remuneration for the first
year.
Five pounds a year pocket money! Well; but where's the pocket to
ut it into? Five pounds a year would not find the young º lin
ess. A damsel possessed of a small independence might perhaps
deem such a situation eligible—if willing to undertake alittle drudgery
for amusement. - -
But opportunities will be, afforded for improvement. As the
governess is required to “work well at the needle,” it is to be feared
that she would '. much less scope for improvement than for mending.
It would be doubtful whether her claims to sympathy would rather be
those of a poor governess or of a distressed needlewoman.
The “small quiet family” should º if they cannot get a nursery
governess for an old gown, like a canary bird, which may sometimes be
: by that species of barter, provided “accomplishments are not
required.”
This “small quiet family” may be very snug, but Punch is afraid it
is also dreadfully close. -
WISCOUNT WHIGGINGTON'S RECAL FROM THE
GOVERNMENT OF BARATARIA.
The Hottentot Sentinel publishes the following dispatch from EARL
BRUTUs to Wiscount WhiggingtoN :-
“Downing Street, August 15, 1850.
“It is my painful duty to announce to your Lor ship that HER
MAJESTY has been pleased to release you from the Government of the
lsland of Barataria to which SIR Hokey Pokey has been appointed.
And I am instructed to signify to you HER MAJESTY's permission, if
you should be inclined to leave the island immediately, (or as soon as
tourlordship's linen has been returned by yourlordship's washerwoman,)
hand over the Government to the Colonial Secretary, MR, DUMMY.
“In announcing your recal. I have to speak in terms of the highest
prºse of many parts of your Lordship's administration...
‘Indeed, considering that you have never filled a public office before
or were in any way distinguished by reputation, character, or capacity,
from any other gentleman, I cannot but think that your appointment
reflects credit ". Her Majesty's Government of which it have the
honour to be a Member, and upon the many affectionate relatives whom
* number amongst the advisers of the Queen. To cultivate the
mily affections has ever been the boast of our statesmen, and in many
of the troubles and perplexities to which the Cabinet, of which I form
part, has been subject, it has been an abiding subject of pride and con-
solation to us to think that Nature has endowed the members of certain
families, holding Whig principles in this country, with a peculiar aptitude
for business and peculiar talents for the public service; such as are not
to be found in the other less fortunate families in this country.
“The finances of Barataria, when you entered ". the government of
that island, were much embarrassed: they have been improved under
your lordship's administration... Your own revenues, I trust, have not
suffered during the same period.
“The alertness and vigour with which your lordship quelled the in-
surrection in Barataria, in 1848, has been * by some as excessive,
and the severity with which you quelled the revolt has, it must be
owned, been viewed by dissatisfied parties in this º in the
island itself, no doubt—with considerable disapprobation. we no
doubt, however, that the measures which you took were best
tº according to your opinion, and that that opinion was for upon
the spot.
º: I must add that it has appeared to a Select Committee of the
House of Commons that your lordship's efforts to maintain peace and
º among the public servants of the Colony have not been so
successful as the means which you took to restore º to the island:
and * every effort has * made not to publish the doc ts
which told in your disfavour, enough, I grieve to say, has tra
-
give the public an unfavourable opinion of your merits, oblige
your many friends and relations in the Cabinet, to advise TY
of the propriety of your recall.
“I have, &c.
“The Wiscount WHIGGINGTON.” *BRUtus.”
Now, as Wiscount WhiggingtoN himself announced his intention
of resigning, to the Council of Barataria in August, and the above
des ºil not reach the Colony until September, it is clear that
Lond WHiggingtoN was not recalled by the Home Government.
Slow and Sewer.
SEwer accidents are, we regret to say, becoming so frequent, that
there is a weekly average of one or two inquests arising out of loss of life
in the Sewers of the Metropolis. There is always abundance of evidence
to prove that there is no one to blame, and now and then, an eminent
engineer comes forward to show that if such a thing had been So and
So, nothing would have happened. This is about as consolatory to the
friends of the deceased and the public in general, as the intimation that
“if the bowl had been stronger the story would have benlonger,” may
have been found consolatory to the relatives of the three wise men of
Gotham who went to sea in a bowl.
MANCHESTER POLICY AND POPERY.
(To Richard Cobden, Esq., M.P.)
“MY DEAR SIR,
Is it true that LoRD John Russell intends to bring a bill
into Parliament reviving the penal laws, which rendered man
Catholic priests liable to be hanged, drawn, and quartered? Because
in your speech at the Albion Hºt . Manchester, the other evening,
you are reported to have expressed a fear that—
“There are men now in the Cabinet, who owe all their distinction in public life to
having been identified with the principles of toleration to which we are constantly
more and more progressing, who are now ready to sully their fair fame, and belie, I
had almost said, the whole of their past political career on entering into the political
season of 1851.
At all events, it would appear from the above, that you anticipate
an attempt at some very intolerant legislation against the Roman
Catholics on the part of the Government. The general expectation is,
that ministers ºft simply bring in a bill to prevent Rome's hierarch
from making free with England's titles. You are a man of sense, an
know that this is not intolerance. You are a man of honour, and
would not, to curry favour with part of your constituents, or to suit any
other purpose, pretend that it is,
Your general admirer,
33&iº.
P.S. Suppose an impudent fellow were to go about, calling himself
Chaplain to Richard Cobden, and, under that false pretence, were to
sneak into the houses of your friends and relatives, and inveigle the
females of their establishments into making him their confessor, would
º you wish to prevent him from using your name? An *ºn
oblige. -
The Best of all Law Books.
WE find there has been recently advertised a law Book under the
romising title of Broom's Practice. This is just what is wanted in the
aw; the Broom happens to be a good one, for a little practice with
such an implement may have the effect of operating a sweeping reform.
HIGH Words BELOW. STAIRs.
A DUEL has very nearly taken place in one of the most distinguished

culinary indignation, called SoxER “a regular Flash-in-the-Pan.”

NO NEWS FROM PARIS.
BY A CYNICAL CORRESPONDENT.
Café des Aveugles, Feb. 1.
ERTAINLY it is as well for
people who wish to lead
an easy life in the world,
that the inventions actu-
ally º: and per-
fected by men of genius
are by no means so nume-
rous as their plans; and
that the Patent-office con-
tains such a number of
specifications of disco-
veries, the knowledge of
which is not carried be-
yond the proprietor and
transcriber of the sheets
of stamped paper out of
which the vernment
takes its profit. . If every
man's discoveries were
practicable, and put in
execution, what a restless,
feverish, and uncomfort-
able world ours would be,
and how odious to those
who are lazy, or fond of
= old practices and customs,
= or desire to be quiet!
ºf Suppose, for instance,
CAPTAIN WARNER's long
range were to come into
§ play next week; suppose
the week after the steam-
carriage forLondonstreets
were to drive up and smoke the cabs and omnibuses out of the
town: suppose, ten days after, that the new system for warming and
lighting London simultaneously with gas made from egg-shells or
potato-peelings, or what not, should be brought, into use; and then
suppose that the aerial machines were completed, and every man had
his balloon and steam-engine in his back-yard ready to take him to
business every morning after his breakfast. Could we live with any
comfort, or keep pace with a world, where the progress of discovery was
so abominably rapid P WARNER's machine being brought into action,
it is evident that the standing army, and our “wooden walls,” England's
pride, the dock-yards, barracks, and Woolwich arsenals, the Guards’
Club, in Pall Mall, the Duke of Wellington, the sentries, and the valu-
able clock at the Horse Guards, would all be blowu to annihilation;–
there would be no use in Woolwich without artillery, no use for a
Guards' Club without i. i. no heroes in jack-boots to put into
the sentry-boxes at Whitehall; nobody to wind up the clock there, and so
forth. Then the steam-carriages would knock up the omnibus and horse-
dealers; then the aerial locomotives would drive the steam-carriages
proprietors into the gazette: then the gas companies would be extin-
guished, and § out in bankruptcy and darkness; then the coal pro-
prietors would have no sale for their black diamonds: the wharf owners
would not get their rents: the bargees would drown themselves from
their useless vessels; and the great parties at Wallsend House would
given up; then the coal-whippers would drink no more beer—so that
the aristocracy and the commonalty, the milliners, the lightermen,
MEssRs. BARCLAY and PERKINs, and the *#. who describe
the magnificent entertainments at Wallsend House aforesaid, would all
suffer by the new invention, and have their present means of livelihood
cut off. I am of a timid, or, if you please, conservative turn: I like the
pace of improvement to be so slow as scarcely to be felt: I am not sure
that I don’t admire LoRD John Russell. At any rate, who would
live in a country which gasps from one revolution into another, and in its
º perpetually tumbles down, has a fit, has the doctor fetched and
is bled, and then rises up and staggers on to the next convulsion?
My dear Mr. Punch, it has been my fortune to live in Paris for the last
few weeks. I have seen M.THIERs walking in the Tuilleries Gardens;
the President of the Republic made me (and a hundred others) a very
polite bow in the Champs Elysées on Monday; I dined in the very
next cabinet to M. CARLIER, the Prefect of Police, and a party at
PHILIPPIs, in the Rue Montorgueil, on Wednesday last; and the con-
clusion to which I have come, after thus mixing with the highest
French society, is, that I thank my fate I am an Englishman, and not
born under the baleful star of the Legion of Honour. Who knows
what explosive machines are getting ready to sweep down institutions
here? o knows what new method for firing Paris streets may be
#. into practice any day ? what flying wonders are in the air?
morning, or the PRESIDENT go off in one! The changes in this country
are so rapid; the lulls and tempests so surprising and sudden; the
fierce quarrels so easily healed; the firm friendships so soon broken;
the alliances so quickly made and dissolved; the illustrious reputation
of yesterday so entirely forgotten to-day, to re-appear and resplend
to-morrow, perhaps, . without any assignable reason—that I say we
may thank our stars that we live in a grave country, where the people
have not such prodigious powers of inventing and destroying; and
where demolition and edification do not recur so restlessly.
A fortnight ago—or is it a month P-or is it ten years?—or was it
before the Empire or the Revolution?—the illustrious CHANGARNIER,
his dismissal, his wrath, and the woes unnumbered of which it was to
be the direful, spring to France, was the subject of every newspaper
discussion and drawing-room conversation. What will the Illustrious
do? Will the President dare to do without him? Will the Chamber
not rally round the Illustrious Sword? Will the Chamber and the
Illustrious Sword together not turn the President out of doors, and
send him to. Vincennes or the frontier? Sir, we trembled at the
withdrawal of the Illustrious Sword; that removed, people said the
whole body politic which hung round it would collapse and fall to
the ground. This is but a fortnight ago—a week since the majority of the
Chamber, which had taken such offence at the dismissal of their cashiered
champion, did not even mention his name in the debate in which they
stormed the Government—and to-day he is no more talked about than
GENERAL KLEBER or MARSHALTURENNE. He is illustrious—c'est bien ;
France has such a number of illustrious Captains: you may see por-
traits of three thousand of them in the Museum at Versailles.
CHANGARNIER, THIERs, Burgraves, coalition of parties, attack on the
Government, determined stand against the Empire—these sounds, so
familiar at every café table, talked of by every woman in every drawing-
room, heard in every group of Champs Elysées, promenaders, or in the
pit or the balcon at the play-areas if they had never been. If CHAN-
GARNIER sulks in his tents, who cares? If the Burgraves wag their
venerable heads together and prophecy too, who minds? The Titans
of the coalition stormed and carried Olympus, and, then!—and then
they marched out again, leaving Jove in possession, and unruffled.
Coalition and combat, and victory, and failure are nine days old, and
the public does not care, for them one jot. , Sir, Mr. Punch, I am an
old Paris man, and I tell you that the excitement produced in the
country by MonTECHRisto, or the fight between the “Chourineur,” and
#. in the Mystères de Paris, was infinitely more great and durable
than the sparring-match between M.THIERs and M. BARochE the other
day. Parlez-moi de suffrage universel / The nation has elected the
Chamber, and having elected it, cares about its proceedings no mºre
than about "a theatrical feuilleton in the Journal des Débats. . The
representatives talk, and vote, and shout, and drink eau sucrée, and they
have lively interpellations, agitations, and so forth-but nobody goes to
their Théâtre Historique. THIERs comes out in the spectacles, CHAN-
GARNIER waves the grim sword, and brandishes his moustachios, DuPIN
rings the bell—but the audience doesn't care. La France possède sa
Chambre—and what happens after possession?—after courtship, and
enthusiasm, and marriage, before the Mayor of the arrondissement *
The Femme legitime sits at home, keeps her chamber, and Monsieur goes
out and walks on the Boulevard, and ogles the little coupés in the Bois.
Now, suppose a man, remarkable for coolness, simplicity, courage, a
clear head, whom chance or luck has placed at the head of a Government
like this;–and to this opinion of the Presiding Officer of the French Re-
public, you, Mr. Punch, and almost all persons of sense in England, have
come;—suppose a man endowed with iſ these qualities; and what great
desire can such a one have to be called Emperor, or to be crowned at
Rheims or Notre Dame? Would he be the better off, or the more secure,
if anointed ever so much; or if the Pope consecrated him; or if the
Chamber voted, or the whole nation elected him Emperor for ever and
ever? Every prince and his heirs for ever has been elected and re-
ceived with cries of joy, and ied round, and turned out; and from
the Throne Room of the Tuileries to the back door, and the hackney-
coach in the yard, seems to be the certain course of all French dynasties.
It is Arrivée du Roi—Sacre de sa Majesté—Fuite du Roi—Arrivée de
M. le Lieutenant-Général du Royaume, &c., -over and over again.
it had been his Majesty NAPOLEoN the Second or Third—(which is it)?—
meditating an assault upon the privileges of parliament and the liberties
of the country, whom the coalition attacked the other day, his majesty's
hackney-coach would have been ordered out, and he would have arrive
in England as MR. Jones—leaving the field to the allies, white, red, and
tri-color; and it was because there was no emperor that the President was
safe, and that those balked conspirators, took nothing by their victory.
And so, Sir, as I look from this place at the course of events, and
listen to the conversation of the people round me, I feel º: to be
as incredulous as any man of the company, the highest and the lowest;
I fancy the old Burgraves ºf to each other; the President
yawning with a languid, smile; and the porters at the gates, of the
Ministères, eying cynically out of their holes the passing folks who
take possession of the ministerial portfolio for to-day, and are gone to-
morrow, after playing their little part in the comedy—the comedy to
which nobody #. or for which nobody cares any more.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ARCADIA IN SMITHFIELD.
ERY lately MR. PUNCH was
andsomely invited to a
Smithfield conversazione,
at the London Coffee-
House, to hear a lecture
upon the advantages of
a New Central Cattle-
Market in Smithfield,
and to contemplate a
model thereof: he begs to
state, that he thinks the
model a real bit of Ar-
cadia. There can be no
doubt, that every bullock,
with a senseof the beaut
of his destination conti-
nually before him, would
go to such a market with
the gravity of an Alder-
man to dinner. No doubt
that Smithfield, regene-
rated after the manner
of MR. BUNNING, would
be the most salubrious
and balmy spot in the
whole metropolis. In-
deed, we have profoundl
considered the model,
and believe it would re-
resent a second Arca-
ia, with only a very
slight alteration; namely,
“A MERE FORM.”
MR. GoLDSMID, lately committed, in mistake,
to the House of Correction, for an assault, has
been liberated, the real offender having magna-
nimously come forward. The account says–
“MB. Golds MID was liberated from custody with a free
pardon, the pardon being of course a mere form, but neces-
sarily arising from the fact that the verdict of the jury
was “Guilty.'”
As the Jury committed one unhappy blunder,
the Government, to strike the balance, pairs the
mistake with a mockery; that is, for mockery
read “matter of form.” What a pity that, in aii
Government matters, poor common sense cannot
always be made a “matter of form.”
FISCAI, CoNUNDRUM.
WHY is a Paper-maker like a man with an over-
scrupulous conscience? -
Because he’s oppressed with a sense of duty.
CHANGE THAT won’T PAss.
ONE of those exceedingly tolerant Legislators
who'are for acquiescing in the Court of Rome's
assumption of authority in England, asked a
friend, the other day, to give him change for a
Sovereign. The other (who was a Wag, although
a bigot) replied, “Do you mean the Pope?”
Russell's Legislative Soirées.
Loº JOHN RUSSELL, assisted by his talented
Colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will,
from time to time during the Session, have the honour of
exhibiting his celebrated Imitations, which will consist in
in the most delicate china.

the pattern of our shepherds on our mantel-pieces, as imported from Dresden, and moulded | Window. Tax will form the subject of the first Evening's
TAKING OFF some of the more objectionable TAxes. The
Entertainment. For futher particulars, see the BiLLs.
A COMPROMISE WITH THE WATICAN.
THE controversy respecting the papal bishoprics is, simply, a
estion of names. A name is said to º a matter of no consequence.
f this is true of the titles of the Pope's bishops; if the point in dispute
is really a trifle, the priestly º in reason and justice, should
ield to the majority of the English Nation. England, on the other
and, might easily concede what ought fully to satisfy Rome. Let
every Roman Catholic Archbishop and Bishop continue to exercise his
present spiritual jurisdiction over the district to which he has been
a ...? by the Pope – his Holiness being free to draw on the face of
the country as many imaginary lines as he pleases, and to nominate
whomsoever he likes to be, within the contained spaces, Bishops or
Archbishops, of all who choose to acknowledge them. Only—just for
distinction's sake—let the places that give titles to their sees be named
anew. CARDINAL Wise MAN might, surely, be content to be styled
ARchbishop of PARLIAMENTvrile and Administrator of the Diocese of
Surrey Borough. A nearer approach to the actual designation of his
see, might be permitted to the new Bishop for whom Birmingham is
indebted to Pio Nono, and who might, with the greatest propriety
and most striking significance, rejoice in the title of Bishop of
BRUMMAGEM.
Too Much of a Pocketful.
High respect, generally, is due to the sensible principle of looking to
the main chance, so strenuously asserted by MR. Cobden and the
Manchester School. Let us—as far as we honourably may—attend to
their exhortations to be intent on making money. But in allowing
them to inspire us with an eagerness to fill our pockets, we must not
let them prevail upon us to pocket the Pope's insolence.
FRENCH NOTION OF THE WINDOW-TAx.
“THE Sun so seldom shines in England,” (says a sage French Poli.
tician) “that a Tax is actually put upon Light—that, being considered
to be one of the greatest Luxuries—in the shape of the Window-Tax.”
CRYSTAL PALACE POLICE.
THERE is to be an additional force of 900 policemen, in order to kee
1800 police eyes upon the Crystal Palace. There will also be furnished,
from the manufactory of Tussaud, for the contemplation of the
foreigner, a *...". illustrative of the habits of the policeman; namely,
the Policeman, the Cook, and the Leg of Mutton, all in wax.
TEETOTAL “HOPES,” AND TEETOTAL MODESTY.
ERTAIN teetotallers have ad-
dressed PRINCEALBERT, thank-
ing him for the exclusion of
alcoholic drinks from the Crys-
tal Palace. That glass is to
hold neither wine nor spirits.
The said teetotallers m
expressed
“A hope that his Royal Highness
did not sanction the late distribution
of beer amongst the workmen-en
upon the building, during a late visit
to the works."
A future letter from the same
body to the PRINCE will ex-
press another hope, that when
any of HER MAJEsty's Minis-
ters shall lunch at Windsor,
they will be restricted to tea,
with a due allowance of gun-
powder to Lord PALMERston,
Another letter will request of
- - - His Royal Highness a full and
particular account of the discipline of the Royal Nursery, hoping that
on no occasion the children, on coming down after lunch, are permitted
to sip of a glass of Marsala.
Another letter will desire of the PRINCE a faithful return of his own
consumption of wine, beer, and spirits, for the last twelvemonth; the
liquors to be given in a F. tabular form, showing the days of con-
sumption and number of glasses.
Temperance is an excellent virtue; but even temperance may be con-
ceited. Now, NARGIssus was undoubtedly the first teetotaller. And,
like that simple, modest swain, too many of the teetotallers of our day
see nothing in the world like themselves in water.
Proof of the Extraordinary Mildness of the Season.
So warm and genial has been the weather of late, that the ladies
have been coming out in Oxford Street and Regent Street, just as if it
were Spring, imparting the lively and blooming aspect of May to those
fashionable thoroughfares. The other morning, a young lady was
heard singing in Belgrave Square.

useful and interesting sub-
ects” as the subjects of the
itchen, instead of “conti-
nually tracing on innume-
rable yards of canvas the
horrors of war, the destruction of a fire
by fire or water, the plague, the storm,
the earthquake.” For this purpose,
SoYER suggests some admirable his.
torical events, connected with the
Cuisine, on which artists might, with
advantage, employ their genius.
Amongst others, he mentions the fol-
lowing:—
Louis XIV., at Versailles, receiving from
the hands of the PAchA the First Cup of Café
ever made in France.
Potsdam, with a Cup of Cho-ca.
CARDINAL MAZARIN tasting, at the Louvre,
the First Cup of Chocolate.
In all matters of taste (excepting
| his. Nectar and his Economical Soup,
| " which, we candidly confess, we never
| could stomach) we always agree with
}) the mighty Soy ER. ...And we are so
-- moved with his indignation at the
heglect with which artists have too
long visited all subjects connected
with culinary, art, that we go out of our way to give Royal Academicians the benefit of the following
notions, which may have the desired effect of elevating the Cuisine to the same level as the Conqueror's
Tent, or the Monarch's Council Chamber. We see a grand historical picture in each of the following
Suggestions:–
Grohge THE THIRD in the Old Woman's Cottage, wondering “how ever the apples got inside the apple-dumpling.”
Ude Tearing his Hair, upon learning that the British Nobleman had put salt into his soup.
The Duke of Norfolk conceiving the brilliant notion of Rescuing a Nation from Starvation, by means of his celebrated
Curry-Powder.
The Immortal Courage of the GREAT UNKNowN who Swallowed the First Oyster.
MARIE-ANton ETTE wondering how the People could Starve, when there were such nice little Gateaux at three sons a-piece.
Napoleon Eating the Dish of Stewed Mushrooms, by which, it is said, he lost, (in consequence of the indigestion,) the
Battle of Leipsic.
The Resignation of Soyer at the Reform Club.
Portrait of the Celebrated American Oyster, that was so large, that it took three men to swallow it.
ABERNETHY inventing his Dinner. Pill. --- -
BRILLAt SAVARIN tasting the Wonderful Sauce, that was so delicious, that a person could eat his own father with it.
CAESAR, or DANDo, Astonishing the Natives.
Heroic Death of WATEL, upon hearing that the Fish had not arrived.
CANN first hitting upon the glorious idea of giving in Holborn “a devilish good dinner for 24d."
As soon as our º Painters have put into living shape the above delicious morceaur, we shall be
prepared to furnish them with another course of the same choice quality.

THE NEW STYLE OF PARLIAMENT.
. THE inhabitants of the civilised universe, and all the other readers of this periodical, will do us the
justice to acknowledge that we have never failed, when occasion offered, to expose, according to the
measure of our humble ability, the unnecessary and absurd verbosity of acts of Parliament to public
cachinnation. We may therefore be excused if, with a slight measure of self-complacency, we quote
from a morning contemporary of last week the following important announcement:-
“At the commencement of the ensuing session, on Tuesday next, the statute passed in June last, entitled “An Act for
shortening the language used in Acts of Parliament,’ will take effect.”
... The session of 1851 thus opens under entirely new auspices; and from henceforth the GENIUs of
PERSPICUITY and ConciseNess will exert that influence over Parliamentary composition which has
hitherto been exercised by the SPIRIt of CIRCUMLocution and RIGMAROLE. The preamble of each
bill will be the offspring of PRECISION and TERSENEss; its clauses the progeny of ExACTNESs and
BREvity. The contracted dimensions of an act of Parliament, it is to be hoped, will in future deny a
thoroughfare to the figurative coach-and-six; and a laudable analogy to the gallop of the Hierosolyman
pony will be the only characterestic of the enactment that can be termed asinine.
Superstitious Delusion.
SERVANT girls and damsels of higher degree—maids-of-no-work as well as maids-of-all-work—occa-
sionally seek a knowledge of futurity in coffee-grounds. That they are not only deluded in their belief,
but also frequently mistaken in their grounds, is proved by the fact, that the latter, in many instances,
consist diº of chicory, roasted corn, beans, and potato-flour.
“ALL IN THE Downs.”
SIR PETER LAURIE has succeeded in appointing a Committee in the Marylebone Westry, to report
upon the Wood-Pavement in Oxford Street. This Committee, we are told, is a Standing Committee.
e are very sorry to hear this; for, as the Wood-Pavement is so extremely slippery that nothing can
stand upon it, it stands to reason that anything like a Standing Committee must necessarily be floored.
Voltaire helping FREDERIC, on the Field of
DANGEROUS LIGHTS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“You R kindly correspondent
PUss-IN-BLUCHERs, in the course of
observations on “The Mice of Scot-
land,” which do honour to her feline
heart, says–
“Nay, when I reflect upon the increased
number of candles used now-a-days in certain
churches, a mouse ecclesiastical may have a
very jolly berth of it.”
“Sir, this supposition would be
quite, correct, but that, alas! we are
afraid to eat the Puseyite candles.
Fatal experience has acquainted us
with the tricks of the tallow-chandlers.
Besides, we have a particular reason
for fearing that the candles in ques-
tion are arsenicated; for almost every-
body says that there is poison in Trac-
tarian compositions.
“I am, &c.
“A CHURCH MoUSE.”
"CLASSICAL DRUGGERY.
AMONG the appointments in the
Gazette of a few days ago, we find it
stated that a DR. Bond is chosen to
fill “the office and place of Reader of
Physic, in the University of Cam-
bridge.” We do not exactly under-
stand how physic can be read; how
for example, Senna can be substituted
for Seneca; but we have no doubt the
new official's duties are regularly pre-
scribed for him. Perhaps the task to
be performed is the tºº. of those
mysterious terms we find on the
doctor's bottles, and which would, no
doubt, be more difficult to the inex-
perienced than, the Classics usually
taught in schools; for though we may
comprehend Horat. Flac. Op., it is not
so easy to put a just interpretation
upon Squill. Sen. Coloc. Opad.—and
the other canine Latinity, which the
“reader of physic” will probably have
to elucidate.
! News from Rome.
A LETTER from Rome says:—
“LoRD FIELDING is making his round of
devotional pilgrimages here. Yesterday he
visited the church of St. Peter ad vincula,
and at his request the chains of the Apostle
were placed on his neck, and afterwards on that
of LADY FIELDING and of the servant man.”
This is precisely what the Pope
would do with John BULL : clap the
chains of St. PETER on his neck; and
having them there, would take especial
care to rivet them.
“PUT ouT THE LIGHT! AND THEN–”
PLANTs, it is said, die without light.
Our wonder is, then, how the Window-
Tax can exist; for every Sanitary,
and Parliamentary, and every other
kind of Commissioner, knows that the
effect of it is to block out the light;
and without light we should have
thought it must have retired into the
realms of the Prince of Darkness long
ago, as we certainly look upon the
Window-Tax as one of the most tre-
mendous Plants ever put upon a
Nation by a Government.

THE scientific world generally, and ornithologists in particular, will
doubtless feel interested in the fact, that the Philoperisteron Society—
which has for its object the cultivation of every variety of Pigeon—
held its Anniversar {ij}. and Annual Public Exhibition, lately, at
ANDERTON's Hotel, Fleet Street. The room was crowded, and the
company appeared much delighted with the exhibition.
We have also to record a meeting for similar purposes, which took
place, about the same time, at PopKINs's, in the Borough. The
attendance was numerous and select, consisting of all the mobility and
(light-fingered) gentry of that aristocratic jº amongst whom we
noticed some of the most celebrated incognoscenti of the “fancy.”
Several gentlemen amateurs present expressed their surprise that, up
to the present time, they had been ignorant of the existence of so
º: a body, and evinced a strong desire to join it.
Nearly all the species, indigenous and imported, were exhibited: the
Tumbler in his wonderful varieties, which, by-the-by, we are free to
confess, in noway equalled those of the Tumbler at Astley's, to say
nothing of our old protégés the Acrobats of Arcadia. Baldheads were
there, and Beards (short-faced), in all their interesting, and varied
beauties; Carriers, in their varieties of dun-brown and blue; and an
assemblage, under the general name of “Toys,” comprising the species
and varieties of Trumpeters, Helmets, the Porcelain from the Indies, and
others, too numerous to mention. All were in excellent feather and
fine show; and MR. Bolt's Pouter, commanded universal admiration,
chiefly, we believe, from the fact, that he was considered to be quite
worth the plucking, and would ultimately afford very pretty picking.
We heartily wish the Philoperisteron Society all the success it merits.
SERMONS IN LONDON STONES.
THERE is a great moral lesson to be learned from the Stones of
London, and though the philosopher would not be disposed to pitch it
too strong, he would naturally feel reluctant that the London stones
should be thrown away upon us, when there is so much instruction to
be derived from them. It seems that the repairing of the streets after
the Gas Companies took the subject up will, cost £20,000, and though
the public may contribute nothing specifically for the new pipes, we, in
some other way, have to pay the piper.
We have no fault to find with the establishment of the new Company,
which has so much cheapened our gas, and caused that to come com-
paratively light, which used to be heavy; but we wish the sewers, the
paviours, and the other meddlers with our ways, would be a little more
simultaneous in their action, and that they would, only take possession
of our thoroughfares when they find an opening a y made for them.
Old English Hospitality.
A wealthy householder of ancient Tory principles, who keeps a shop
in an opulent metropolitan parish, in order to prevent foreigners, during
the approaching Exhibition, from interrupting his business by coming
in to ask the way, intends to put up a bill in the windows of his es-
tablishment, notifying that “Ici on NE PARLE PAs FRANÇAIs.”
A RAILWAY ALLEGORY.
We learn, from the Maidstone Journal, that a few days since, a mail
train was nearly thrown off the rails, being attacked by a furious bull,
between Headcorn and Pluckley. The bul strayed from a drove—
“When the mail-train was seen approaching, on which the beast made directly towards
the red lights on the engine with its tail in the air; it was consequently dashed to pieces,
parts of the body having been picked up at a distance of sixty yards from the place
where the collision occurred.”
The furious, or, rather, foolish bull, is the bull sent from Rome and
straying from Golden Square; and the mail-train is PROGREss. That a
bull, “with its tail in the air,” running at such an engine, should be
dashed to pieces, was only to be expected. Better the bull to be
dashed to atoms, than that PROGREss should be thrown off the rails.
Intramural Burying-Alive.
THE country requires, on sanitary grounds, a legislative measure for
the general prevention of intramural interment. Of course the pro-
posal of such an enactment would excite a great deal of opposition on
the part of undertakers, and others having “vested interests” in
churchyards. Would it not also probably be objected to by DR. WISE-
MAN and his party as tending to the infringement of religious liberty?
For, certainly, if intramural interment is prohibited, it will be illegal
that a young lady should be buried within the walls of a convent.

DRAMAS FOR EVERY-DAY LIFE.
THE MINISTER PUZZLED.
DRAMAtts PEEsox *.
THE CHANCELLOR of The ExCITEQUER.
"THE WINDow TAx.
Thir INCOME TAx.
The TAxrs on Knowledgr.
THE TEA Duty.
THE So AP DUTY, &c. &c.
The Stage represents the Office of the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
in Downing Street.
The CHANCELLOR discorered solus, bending over papers.
Chancellor of the Erchequer. Was ever Minister so much perplex'd?
This horrid surplus overcomes me quite;
To me 'tis such an unaccustomed thing.
I feel as strange as one who meets the ghost
Of some one that he never met before.
Now, had it chanced to be a deficit,
I should have felt most perfectly at home;
Against a deficit, I’ve many a time . . . .
Stood boldy up—knowing there's nothing in it.
I’d nothing then to do but look around,
Select my victim for my needed tax, . .
And hurl him down the widely-yawning jaws
Of the exhausted Treasury’s abyss.
'Tis easier far to boldly take from one
Than satisfy a hundred loud demands.
'Tis simple work supplying simple wants;
But expectation with its million hands,
And twice ten million tongues, I cannot soothe.
'Tis Hydra teeming with additional heads,
BRIAREUs with ten thousand extra hands,
And ARGUs starr'd with supplemental eyes.
The million-headed HYDRA's million tongues
Make on the surplus near a million claims.
Each finger of BRIAREUs’ countless hands
Makes at the public purse a desperate clutch;
While I, beneath the gaze of ARGUs’ eyes,
See in them all the green of jealousy. -
[He goes on with his calculations, and falls asleep to the slow music of
an Italian Organ Boy without. While he sleeps, clouds gather
round from the dust of the surrounding papers, enteloping etery-
thing in obscurity, and the Ghost of THE WINDow TAX
appears, - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Ghost of Window Tar. List! list oh list ! thou sleeping Minister!
How canst thou sleep while I still stalk abroad:
My troubled spirit, with its weight of conscience,
Can never, never rest, till thou hast laid me.
[7%. CHANCELLOR of the ExchequER starts, and turns round.
'Tis well thou startest —better still, thou hast turn’d—
I’m glad to see that thou art turn'd at last;
But listen now, and thou shalt start still more.
See'st thou yon wretched hovel, where a crowd
Of miserable beings, closely packed,
Lie huddled in a foetid atmosphere;
Disease and death are in solution held,
Through every breath that stirs or stagnates there.
Talk of oppression and a tyrant's chains!
What greater tyrant is there than disease?
What worse oppression than the foul-mouth'd fiend,
Who, nightmare-like, sits on the tortured breast,
And with the poison from his lips exhaled
Corrupts the life-blood; turns the pleasant glow
Of genial warmth to fever's fitful heat 2
'...i when the sufferer seeks a purer air,
He seeks in vain; for I, the Window Tax
Shut up the wholesome vents which should supply
All Nature's sustenance—the breath of life.
On me. Mortality’s tremendous bills
Hang like a debt—to which I daily add.
But 'tis enough. I know thou meanest well.
Thou’lt lay my troubled spirit in the grave-
Abolish me for ever. So, farewell! - - - - - - -
[The WINDow TAx dismears in a flame from the light of Civilisation.
and immediately afterwards the Ghost of THE INCOME-TAX is
seen in its place.
Ghost of the Income Tar. To thee, Great Minister! I make appeal.
Oh, save me from the public odium
That I so well deserve Why am i forced
To visit equally the rich and poor *
To take from heap'd-up Superfluity
The same proportion that I rudely grasp
From Industry's barest sufficiency?
Luxurious Ease of nothing I deprive;
But careful Labour's wants I much curtail.
Nor is the present mischief that I do,
The only load that weighs my conscience down.
Pinching the father now whose constant toil
ms scarce enough his family to feed,
I rob them of their poor inheritance.
The father struggles, and the orphan starves,
And both their fates, alas! are due to me,
I that am nobly born—the offspring fair
Of good intention—but how misapplied'
Oh make of me the thing I ought to be
Let me assess the rich—not rob the poor.
Remodel me. Farewell—Remember me !
[The Ghost of THE INCOME TAx sinks down, and there rise up a
Group, headed by the TAx on KNow LEDGE, leading PAPER
Duty, ADVERTISEMENT DUTY, TAx on NEwsPAPERs, &c. &c.
Tar on Knowledge. Thou slumbering Minister, attend to us!
Nor let the cries of others stop thine ears
Against admittance from our potent voice.
The Window Tax, I know, has been with thee—
Talked of the light of day—’tis plausible!
But, oh! the light of knowledge must surpass
All other lights in brilliance. Window light
Freshens the body, but the light of knowledge
Gives life and vigour to the mind and soul.
'Tis well to ope the windows of a house,
But better by a thousand-fold, at least,
To ope the windows of the human frame,
Let in a flood of light, and warmth, and air
Upon the higher faculties of man.
Reflect on what I urge—Farewell—farewell!
[The Taxes on KNow LEDGE ascend out of sight, and the SoAP,TEA, and
other MINor Duties dance round the couch of the CHANCELLOR
of the Exchequer, who seems much disturbed, and utters the
following words incoherently in his sleep.
Chancellor of the Erchequer. How can I deal with all? Impossible!
Be silent, Soap! I know what thou would'st urge;
That health and cleanliness go hand in hand;
That thou would'st come to hand more frequently
If thou wert free. Away!—I’ll hear no more.
Tea—Tea—avaunt, I say! I know thy suit,
But well thou know'st thou hast a thousand tricks
To shun the duty thou art burdened with,
Thou half impostor–son of BIRCH AND Co.'
[The TEA DUTY getting under the nose of the CHANCELLOR OF THE
jºriº wakes him up. All have disappeared ; he rubs
is eyes.
So, 'tis a dream—I’m glad to find it so;
Though when awake I find 'tis much the same.
What with the various claims of Window Tax,
Income, and Knowledge, Sugar, Soap, and Tea,
I know not how to act. Alas, how true!
The power to do a benefit amounts -
To positively nothing more than this :-
The chance of making one ungrateful friend,
With some five hundred bitter enemies.
y surplus promises that chance to me.
Oh, 'tis enough to make one almost wish
The good old days of large deficiency
Were here again!—But, no! I’ll do my best,
And look for justice to the hands of Time.
Slow the reward, but sure—I will be patient.
[The CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer continues his financial calcu-
lations, and falling asleep, he and the curtain fall together.
More of our Bigotry.
Nobody whatever having insinuated that the late fire at the New
Houses of Parliament was occasioned by a modern GUY FAwREs, we
shall be surprised if the Tablet does not complain, of a report to that
effect as an instance of Protestant bigotry and intolerance.
A WERY LIGHT PUN.
WHY is a Woman shaving herself like the Crystal Palace?
Because it is a pane-fill Exhibition.
“THE NEW Houses of PARLIAMENT.”
MR. PUNCH has received a letter from Golden Square, begging him
to deny—(which he does with great pleasure)—the malignant report
that amongst the timber smouldering in the new Houses of Parliament
was found the foot of a red stocking.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO THE NUNS OF ST. PUSEY.

ia, the sister-

ters of St. Barnabas,
with many other
3. all of º

hope you wi allow
me to say one word
upon a seraphicbook
2--> just translated from
THER FABER (who
crossed from St.

about The Life of St.
S Rose of Lima / She
S; #. *:::: says
S FATHER FABER,-
§ in ſº, i.e.
Š MENT X., and “thus
S solemnly has the
S Church of God’—
meaning Rome–
“set the seal of her
unerring approval upon that series of wonders, that endless chain of
miracles, which, reaching from her cradle to her grave, make up the
life of the American virgin.’ Well, the life of St. Rose is dedicated by
FATHER FABER ‘to the Nuns of England,’ that..." with its bright
example they may feed their spirit of devotion.’ Well, Mr. Punch, it
has struck me that what may serve for the cloistered Nuns of England
–(where are all the Nunneries”)—may, with a little alteration, do
beautifully for the sisterhood of St. Pusey. ST. Rose is, to be sure, a
little strong in the South American spirit, but might be diluted for
English families. For instance; upon the undertaken authority of
Doctor FABER, St. Rose's mother having made her daughter wear
a garland of flowers upon her head, she in divine remembrance—
“‘Fixed the garland on her head with a large needle, which she plunged so deeply
into her head, that it could not be drawn out without the help of a surgeon, who had
much difficulty in doing it!”
Might not garlands for a party be worn by the Nuns of St. PUSEY,
fixed on with something less than a very large needle—but nevertheless
with something that should give a more than usual point to that wreath
of roses? something that should impart a new fascination to the smile
of the saint, struggling under such chastening discipline P St. Rose,
to avoid going out to parties, “rubbed her eyes with pimento, a very
sharp sort of Indian pepper, which made her eyes as red as fire, and so
painful that she ... not bear the light.' Now, the Sister of St. Pusey
might not decline Almack's or the Opera; but might try hartshorn
instead of pepper, to make her ‘look a fright’ to all otherwise admirers.
St. Rose—upon the approving belief of Doctor FARER—would not
eat; when her mother made her sit at table, and eat in her presence:
“‘But this enlightened daughter contrived to elude her vigilance, by begging the
servant to offer her only a sort of dish made without salt, composed of a crust of coarse
bread, and a handful of very bitter herbs.'
“Besides this, St. Rose every morning washed her mouth ‘with
sheep's gall,’ with which, moreover, “she sprinkled her food.”, After
this sweet example, may not the daughters of St. Pusey privately carry
with them assaſcetida to a pic-nic, or when “taken down to supper’ at
parties, give a dash of hyssop to the blancmange and jellies?
“ST. f. moreover—to the delight, of FATHER, FABER, and the
future edification of English nuns—“used two hair shirts, which, she
‘armed underneath with a great quantity of points of needles!’. Well,
this certainly gives a new hint for an improved manufacture of crino-
line, which—for the especial wear of the Sisters of St. Pusky—will, I
hope, be exhibited under MR. Paxton's magnifying glass. As for the
hair-shirts of St. Rose—
“‘It would be impossible to express the suffering this rough dress caused her; some-
times it made the perspiration stream from her in great drops; sometimes she fell
fainting under it, and was unable to take a step without great torture.'
“A little tighter lacing might give the Sisterhood of St. Pusey a mild
- - »
notion of this ecstasy of jorsehair. As for what follows, I don't know
what to propose in humble imitation of the real thing :-
“‘She watched also for the hour when cooking was going on in the house, and when
no one could see her, she exposed the soles of her feet to the heat of the oven, where it
was greatest, and kept them there till the pain of her half-roasted feet quite overcame
her!
“After this—and ST. Rose must have had not nine, but nineteen lives
—after, this, she cut off her hair, and wore a crown of sharp spikes
under it; yes, she—
“‘Wore this penitential crown underneath her veil; so that at the least agitation
these iron thorns tore her flesh, and pierced her head in ninety-nine places with exces-
sive pain; and, as the muscles of this part are connected with one another, our saint
could hardly speak; and when she coughed or sneezed, this violent effort caused the
three rows of points to penetrate even to the skull with almost inconceivable pain.'
“And, Mr. Punch, what says FATHER, FABER—the fellow chum of
Doctor NEWMAN–to this? How preaches that gentle, lamb-like man,
upºn the above, which, he says, we should take ‘like awe-struck
children as a page from the lost Chronicles of Eden,'—(FABER's
paradise of hair-shirts and iron-spikes)?—Why, he sweetly avers that—

for the daughters of the Church to learn how to make themselves a cloister in the

St. Rose conveys.”
“There, ladies—cloistered nuns of England, and drawing-room nuns of

... Upon the authority of FATHER FABER, and under his patronage,

“P.S.--Does FATHER FABER himself ever try a corking-needle
through his hat?–Does he season his soup with ipecacuanha?--Does he
wear a fillet of iron points under his night-cap? Or does he think these

THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER'S NEW TARIFF.
RATIONALITY is the boast of the present day; yet not only are the
mummeries of superstition enacted to a great extent, but the charges of
too many hotel-keepers are extremely unreasonable. “A Commercial
Traveller” recently sent a letter to the Daily News, proposing, in
behalf of gentlemen of his order, a reformed scale of prices for the adop-
tion of landlords, and he has forwarded a copy of this letter to Mr. Punch,
no doubt considering that Mr. Punch is a host in himself. Were the
Office of Punch, instead of being 85, Fleet Street, that of the proprietor
of an inn, were it his mission to entertain man and horse, in lieu of
affording instruction blended with amusement solely to the biped-he
would certainly consider himself adequately remunerated by 18, 6d for
a plain breakfast, and by 1s. 9d for the same meal, with the addition of
meat and the usual condiments. He would be happy to provide the
famished Commercial Traveller with dinner at 2s., on the understanding
that one pint of wine or more should be superadded to the repast, con-
fident that any loss he might incur by the hunger of his guest would be
more than compensated for by that fº. thirst. The same
banquet, with the extra consumption o ºft. of wine only, would,
he is sure, pay him handsomely at 2s. 6d., or, regulated on the
principle of total abstinence, at 3s.
Again, he would not deem le. 6d. too little for “one tea,” inclusive
merely of bread and butter, to which, for the consideration of another
sixpence, he would cheerfully undertake to add ham or beef. A cold
meat supper at 1s. 6d. he would also regard as an arrangement suffi-
ciently advantageous to himself; and if he º to supply Welsh
rabbits at 6d. each, he conceives that he should be a gainer by the
speculation. Did Mr. Punch preside over imperial measures, as a
publican, in place of controlling national affairs as a public character, he
certainly would not object to employ them in serving his customers
with alcoholic and fermented liquors at fair prices.
Now these are the requirements of our Correspondent; and
Mr. Punch really regards the Commercial Traveller's New Tariff, as
constructed upon very liberal principles. . This proposed arrangement
between the landlords and commercial gentry, also stipulates that beds
shall be charged “ls. per night, without horse;” and certainly for ls.
Mr. Punch would guarantee a better dormitory than a stable. It
further demands that the usual fees for servants shall be discontinued;
and Mr. Punch feels that, accepting the above terms, he might throw
attendance, accompanied with civility, into the bargain. It excepts
the “extra requirements of the boots,” which it allows “to be left for
private arrangement,” doubtless because the labour of the shoe-black
is variable, and must, besides, be measured according to the comparative
extent of surface of Wellingtons, Bluchers, and highlows, as well as

Curious Phenomenon in the Hair.
It is a singular fact, which has just been pointed out to us by an
eminent coiffeur of the Burlington Arcade, that mostly all the Quakers
have their hair cut after, one peculiar fashion... The reason of this, he
says, is on account of their extraordinary }. not to uncover
themselves in the presence of any one, and the consequence is, that a
barber has to cut a Quaker's hair with his hat on; guiding his scissors,
in the best way he can, round the circumference of the broad brim.
“This explains clearly,” says our informant, “why a Quaker's hair,
if you will only notice it, is generally of an equal length all the way
round his head.”

Cause of the Fire in the House of Commons.
.THE origin of the fire in the House of Commons has not yet been
discovered. It has been suggested to us, and we give the suggestion
without a word of comment, as we do not wish to throw ºwater
upon it, that probably one of MR. FERRAND's speeches had been
incautiously left in the neighbourhood of the Clock Tower, and that
it was of such a firebrand description, that it immediately took hold
of the dry materials, and set the "...ºf on fire. If one of
MR. Roebuck's letters had not been luckily close at hand, and
promptly used as a wet blanket, in which capacity, we are informed,
it acted admirably, the damage, never, would have stopped at offe
hundred pounds. Orders have been given, that, for the future, all
flaming speeches are to be kept in a separate building, which, for the
purpose, is to be made fire-proof. M.R. FERRAND's i. have been
removed altogether, as, after the recent experience, they are considered
to be too combustible.
“LE PEUPLE souver AIN.”
THE Representatives of the French Chamber receive (or did receive)

62 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
THE GROANS OF WEEN’S GHOST.
As the mighty hammer smiting
Twelve times on the metal falls,
Comes a rush of ghosts, alighting
In the nave of dim St. Paul's.
And while through the marble sobbing
Circle still those waves of sound,
Mingled with them is a throbbing
As of wide wings sweeping round.
For to-night the ghosts are ºrd
Of the great that slumber here—
Ill-used great—on whom are fathered
All the marble monsters near!
Johnson's ghost is there, disgusted
At his naked legs of stone;
that, save in silk or worsted,
e'er were e'en to Boswell shown.
HowARD, with a simple wonder
At his dress of sheet and key
Thinks they must have made a blunder:
Ne'er in such attire went he.
Chiefs, who wore cocked hats and feathers,
On their tombs themselves behold
Stripped e'en to their boots and leathers,
In their buff, like knights of old!
While they gaze, and n, and grumble,
O'er the lies Art tells of all,
With a sudden reverence humble
To their ghostly knees they fall.
For they feel a mighty presence
Growing dimly through the place,
Whereunto, in mute obeisance
Howeth down each heart and face.
Looming bigger yet and bigger
Filling up those vasty . º
Not reduced to form or figure—
'Tis his Ghost that built St. Paul's '
From the fabric he created,
For a trophy and a tomb,
With his spirit permeated—
Now that spirit fills the gloom.
O'er the ghostly circle round him
Blackly broods the Shade of WREN,
From the ribs of stone that bound him
Forced by sins of sordid men.
“Brother ghosts' " I heard him mutter,
“I am here to s my mind;
'Tis no time the Church to butter,
Were I ever so inclined.
“What is't that with thought and toiling,
Toiling of the hand and brain,
vil times and tempers foiling,
I for worship reared this fame?
“In my brain the stately vision
Shaped itself—but long I wrought
Ere I won—oh, rare fruition —
Outward shape to inward thought.
“And I said, as sped my labour,
“Green my memory will be,
When the poor man by his neighbour
Walks St. Paul's, and thinks of me—
“‘As the worship I have written,
In these characters of stone,
Sinks within his spirit, smitten
With a sense of awe unknown,
“‘Poverty will pause from caring,
Toil will feel a saintly rest;
And the weary and way-faring,
Ent’ring in, will straight be blest.
“‘Hearts, with sin or sorrow laden,
At the Porch will leave their weight;
Sinful man and erring maiden
Will pass lighter from the gate.”
“So I dreamed—a weak adapter
Of the fancy to the fact—
Were there not the Dean and Chapter,
And the coppers to be sack'd?
“With one voice to poor and needy
Calling, ‘Enter, we beseech;”
With another, whispering greedy
“For admission—twopence each.'
“Priests and prelates, in your grovelling.
Heedless how you smirch your gowns,
Into swollen pockets shovelling
Eagerly the wretched browns–
º º for shame! the world is trooping
nto England's Labour-show:
Let it not behold you stooping
To such paltry gains and low.”
So he spake—the ghosts in chorus
Straight took up his dying fall—
And rung out three groans sonorous
For the DEAN and Chapter all!
And a general vote was passing
(Just as our reporter left)
That the ghosts would quit en masse, in
Case they still kept up the theſt!

A small salary would be given. If acquainted with the general Shoe-

of a cobbler to the cure of souls. Another piece of fun,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. 63
A BILLET-DOUX FROM QUEEN ANNE.
ALLANT MR. PUNCH,
“ONLY yesterday, I
heard our Beadle—you
will please to recollect
that Istandin the Church-
yard of St. Paul's—in the
Churchyard, mind—and
don't make up any part
of the twopenn'orth that's
shown in-doors; I should
say quite the reverse—and
standing there, I heard our
Beadle read a letter in the
Times about the destitute state
of KING CHARLEs, at Charing-
Cross, at present so very re-
duced in circumstances. His
reins are fast dropping from
his hands, as they once did
before; and ... altogether his
horse is riding particularly
rusty.
“Now, Mr. Punch, as I hear
that millions of foreigners are
coming to London in the
spring, I do think that—spe-
cially to so many of 'em that’s
been playing at revolutions, I
don't know how long—I do
think that England should
make her Kings and Queens
pºt as, bold a face upon the visitors as possible. Being a woman, hope I may be
allowed to have a particular desire for appearances; and being, I believe, the .
ºut-of-doºr Queen in the City of London, do you think I am asking too muc
from the Corporation, in just hinting that I should like a handsomely gilt petticoat:
and, moreover, should be happy to have my face washed, being almost black an
well-nigh suffocated with the nasty coal-smoke? I feel that I’m not fit to be seen b
strºngers; and—if I’m not made proper—shall faint clean of my pedestal. And,
as I . being the only City Queen that has to stand all weathers, I think I might
be made a little more able to face the elements. I do assure you, Mr. Punch, that
may a first of May I’d have changed places with the Chimney-sweepers’ fady.
If $º Victoria would only look at me, and think of posterity—that I see so
much of every year, and don't think it improves by any means—she would, I am
sure, order me at least a coat of gilding, with, perhaps, an under petticoat of paint.
“But I don't speak only for º: #. that allºut of door royalty will be made
handsome. Couldn't George the Fourth be painted, and wear a wig of pale gold
manufacture till the Show was over? And George the Third—I do hope,” for
the credit of the country, that ºś will not be spared upon him,
whilst the dear Duke of York, on the Waterloo Pillar, will, I trust, be made to
show that, for once in a way, he really has plenty of coppers.
“If King William should remain in Leicester Square, do, there's a dear, speak
a good word for him that, for the next summer at least, he may, before his melting.
time arrives, have one more coat of Dutch metal.
“ANNE REGINA (as was).”
AN IMMORTAL IDEA.
We have an immortal idea, as grand and as simple as the Exhibition of 1851 itself.
Qur immortal idea is to put London under a glass cover. The thing is as easy as
putting a pea under a thimble !
Let us now look at the advantages that shine, like so many beautiful objects of
Art, under our magnificent glass cover.
First,9f all—we shall have no rain, no hail, no snow, no sleet, and consequently
we shall have no mud, no dirt. We shalſ have clean boots all day long. The
streets will only require to be swept, like a carpet, every morning, and can be
kept as clean as the floor of a cornmarket, or a lady's boudoir.
k at the saving, too, in our clothes, in our boots. They will be protected
from the º: of their greatest enemy, dirt. There will be no wet, not a drop
of water to plant the .# of a galloping consumption in the delicate constitution
of either. Our Wellingtons will be as dry in the evening as in the morning; our
pantaloons as spotless when we take them off as when we put them on.
..What a diminution in the annual amount of diseases! Elderly gentlemen will be
Kyanised from rheumatism, and ladies will be enabled to walk about with the
thinnest shoes in the world—without any shoes at all, if they like—without any
fear of their getting wet feet. Such a thing as a cold—with all its accompanying
horrors of gruel, hot bath, and tallowed noses—will become an old woman's
tradition, only worthy to be sneezed at . -
Then, again, if our feet, are protected from the wet in winter, our eyes will
be Fº screened from the dust in summer; for it stands to reason that as there
will be no wind in our *. case, there can be no dust, much less any fear of
fugitive tiles or dethroned chimney-pots, flying about in the calm air.
“What!” exclaims the clever reader, “will there be
then no air—no ventilation whatever?” Yes—we wi
promise that there shall be º of the former, and will
also go so far as to guarantee that DR. REID shall not
have the management of the latter.
Large windows will be placed at certain distances in the
roof-with the convenience of being opened when it was
too warm, or shut when it was becoming chilly—or begin-
ning to rain,_precisely like the window of any omnibus, up
or down-open or shut—just as you like.
By this means, plenty of ventilation can be secured in
summer; for the entire roof can easily be drawn back in
the Dog Days, if it is too sultry, and the streets can be
aired with hot pipes, filled with water, drawn from our
Baths and wº or heated with large fires, like our
churches, only made much warmer; and an invalid will be
able, to walk from Paddington to the Bank, without any
great coat or goloshes, and be as comfortable, as if he was
walking up and down his own drawing-room.
Why should not our streets also be decorated like a
conservatory Each street might be converted into an
ever-blooming avenue of exotic plants, London might be
a garden in a state of perpetual bloom—an illimitable
Eden under a glass shade! A map of the different floral
beauties of each quarter of the globe might thus be drawn
out on the large surface of the lºſiº the
climate of each street to the wants of each quarter. Birds,
too, of the rarest plumage, natives of those vocal climates
might be allowed to fly about these luxurious plants, and
to sing, or chatter us, miserable, Londoners, into the happy
belief that we were strolling about, with Wilson's birds,
in the woods of North America, or listening to the melody
of the plaintive bulbul in the poetic rose-gardens of Persia.
But this subject is of such an enticing, flowery nature,
that if we do not take care, we shall be losing ourselves, like
adog in the Maze of Hampton Court, in the endless labyrinth
of its playful windings. tus return instantly to London.
We propose that MR. PAxton—from whom we have bor:
rowed the acorn of our immortal idea—should be appointed
the grand conservator of this monster conservatory. . .
The glass roof can be covered, also, with calico—similar
to the plan proposed for the Exhibition—and occasionally
sprinkled with water, (with eau-de-cologne on state occa.
sions,) so as to temper the ardour of the sun acting with
all its force upon the glass.
Only consider, we shALL HAVE No MoRE BLAcks! those
lague-spots of an Englishman's out-door existence—those
som friends of every washerwoman. We shall be able
to walk about all day, and to return home, with an unstained
shirt, with clean cºllars, and almost with a clean counte-
nance. For, recollect, the chimneys will not be inside the
cover, and so, consequently, the “blacks” will fall all on the
outside. , Ladies, will enjoy the same blessing; and a
muslin dress, a chip bonnet, or a delicate mousseline, will
not be dirtied to #. blackness, after it has been
worn once in the open air.
Crossing-sweepers will also be swept away; and we shall
no longer be bothered for a copper” every time we cross
the road. Scavengers, likewise, will be wiped off the dirty
face of London, which, when kept under a glass, will be
as bright and as clean as a schoolboy's, when ushered into
the school parlour, where his mother is waiting to see him.
And, lastly—for it is time to shut up our imagination,
though on a subject so invitingly expansive we feel that we
could unfold it almost to any extent—we shall be freed from
that daily worry of an Englishman's life, the UMBRELLA, .
which, of course, will carry the parasol with it. The
umbrella-makers will, of course, be ruined. We are sorry
for them; but really we cannot help it; and, after all, it
is a serious question, whether we should weep over their
annihilation, when we consider the constant annoyance, and
the abuse, and the recrimination, and the large family of
plans and stratagems for borrowing, not to say stealing,
of which the UMBRELLA is the wicked parent. In putting
down the umbrella, therefore, we feel that we shall be for-
warding the most effectual plan for the discouragement of
robbery. This consideration alone should be more than
sufficient to justify the instant adoption of our IMMORTAL
IDEA. We shall be disappointed if the next generation of
º children are not j up, like cucumbers, under
a glass :

IPUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*TOLERATION FOR ALL PARTIES-AND SOME OTHERS.
URING the times of our great
grandfathers it was the pro-
fession of Englishmen to re-
nounce the Pope and the
PRETENDER, together with
another potentate, regarded
as the common enemy. In
the present day there are
British politicians who are
for quietly allowing the Pope
to establish an imperium in
imperio. Consistency would
make them equally tolerant
of the Pretender were he
now extant; and it is a
question whether their very
enlarged views of “tolera-
tion” would not even take
in the third individual in
the triad, were he openly
to endeavour to amnex the
| dominions of HER MAJESTY to the realms of Darkness.
FROM THE DIARIO OLTRAMANO.
WHEN, the submarine telegraph-lines have been satisfactorily laid
down, it is a great comfort for the piously-minded man to think that
communication throughout Europe will be almost instantaneous, and
that thus, in five minutes, and at a trifling.expense, we can get our
answers and orders from Rome. At any difficulty, Propaganda will
enlighten us; and I have not the slightest doubt, that a Sacred Board
will sit there permanently, with which we can have intercourse at all
hours of the day. What a comfortable—what a consoling-what a
magnificent idea!—that of Rome being really the centre of the world,
and irradiating knowledge and truth to all Europe! ... A miraculous º:
could not wink at Rimini, but the next instant the fact would be
known at Fish Street Hill; a difficulty could not occur, but it might
have an instant solution; and my Lord A. and S., speaking in the House
of Commons, might be reported in the Piazza di Spagna, and actually
prompted at St. Stephen's before he sate down.
In the meantime I should suggest that it would be as well that all
right-thinking persons, members of either House of the Legislature,
should advise with their spiritual director before making any speech or
statement whatever in their respective Chambers. A reverend brother
or two might be in constant attendance, and so attired as not to attract
observation. . For example: About the House of Commons, one might
sell oranges in Parliament Street; another might be employed as a
waiter at Bellamy’s, and so forth; and the great object of unity might
be obtained, and authority kept up.
A lamentable instance of the evils consequent on the want of
unity is to be found, alas! in the speech of LoRD CAMoys, in the
debate on the address. His Lordship, who represents one of the
most ancient families of the kingdom, says;–"At the period of these
introductions (the introduction of our incomparable hierarchy), the
Catholics of England were on the best possible terms with the Pro-
testants. They were in the full enjoyment of religious toleration;
they had the †: of perfect equality before the law; they were
increasing in numbers * * * the whole tendency of things was
§ #: stability to the Catholic body in this country, to enlarge and
o adorn it.”
Any person must at once see, that such admissions, as coming from
Catholic lips, must be fatal. Where was the spiritual director of Lond
C. when that Lord made such statements? Are we not, on the
contrary, maligned and cruelly persecuted P. How can it be for a
moment said that we are in the fullest enjoyment of religious toleration,
when other sects are allowed to exist at all? There can be but one
religion: therefore, all others are false; therefore, to put falsehood on
a par with truth is monstrously unjust and tyrannical; therefore we are
persecuted: therefore we are not in full enjoyment of our religious
opinions—and we have not perfect equality before the law: the law
makes MR. SUMNER, Archbishop of Canterbury, and does not allow
his Eminence as Archbishop of Westminster: therefore the law is
monstrously unequal. And a son of the Church, who, in spite of the
Church, the groans of its venerable princes, the outcries of its eloquent
prelates, the exclamations of the suffering clergy, says that we are not
persecuted at all, makes proof of a dangerous indifference and a
culpable apathy, for which §: ought to be visited with the severest
censure. Fancy for a moment this opinion to be general throughout
England, that a heretical majority had no intention to persecute! that
the stakes prepared for our faithful were without fire, that the swords
drawn against our people were only of lath, that the stones flung against
our martyrs were wind-bags! What scandal! What ridicule worse
than torture! What scorn of scoffers and the profane ! The director of
this Lord had best be changed: the Metropolitan had best appoint him
to a distant cure.

rebellious CHIs

THE ARMY AND THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
As the Great Exhibition is intended to be a sort of Peace Congress,
whereat the principles of brotherly love are to be taught to all nations,
it would º e supposed that the Church would be its chief sup-
porter; but, as the Church has lately been making such an exhibition
of itself, we are afraid that it will be
quite “used up” before the great
|affair comes off. It will therefore de-
|volve upon the other professions to
|aid and assist in what we may literally
term the great undertaking, viewing
it as the funeral of national prejudices.
It is said that even the Army will
“form up,” and do its best to square
the differences which have too long
existed between nations, and do its
share towards converting the swords
into ploughshares.
If Punch might venture to give a
hint, he would suggest that, some very
instructive articles might be sent up
for exhibition from military quarters.
A recruit before attending drill, for
instance, would be a fine specimen
of the “raw” material, while a soldier
on duty, with “eyes front, arrrrm
close to the side, palm of the hand
to the front, and little finger in line
be a specimen of the manufactured
article, and a pretty inmate for a
glass case—lobster in crystal. Space
might be afforded for an intelligent
victim to describe and illustrate the
interesting processes of club-drill, pack-
drill, back-stick, and black hole,
which the country bumpkin is “lick
into shape.” This, Punch is convin
would have a salutary effect on the
“smart, active, and º; young
men,” who are ambitious being
shot at for a shilling, and induce them
to remain at home, instead of seeking

PUNCH*S SERMONS TO TRADESMEN.
TO THE COAL-MERCHANT.
“Five-sixths of the London public is supplied by a class of middlemen who are
called in the trade “Brass plate Coal-Merchants.' These consist, principally of mer-
chants' clerks, gentlemen's servants, and others, who have no wharfs; but merely give
their orders to some true coal-merchant, who sends in the coals from his wharf. The
brass-plate coal-merchant, of course, receives a commission for his agency, which is
just so much loss to the consumer.”—BABBAGE's Economy of Manufactures.
Another instance of Milºš delusion—another cleaving wrong,
originating in the brass of London. The merchant, whose whole
capital is in his name cut in a brass door-plate—the man of nominal
coal, but really the man of smoke, supplies five-sixths of the parlour,
and dining-room, and bed-room stoves and kitchen-ranges of London,
from a wharf not his own—fed by ships of which he possesses no
lank—and laden from mines in which he has not a single pinch of coal-
#. He is a merchant—only a coal-merchant—in right and by virtue
of a piece of brass not wider than his congenial forehead. And he is
paid for his lack of merchandise, and prospers, and is comforted in his
ignorance by the benighted believers in any bit of brass, if written with
#. flourish, and set in a proper place, to strike the dazzled eyes of
idolators.
My friends—(Punch pººl. addresses himself to the true and
simple coal-merchant—to the man, it may be, with a touch of coal-dust
upon his coat, and whose shirt frill may be redolent of coal-tar. In a
word, to the coal-merchant, in his honest nigritude and legitimate

It is painful, my friends, to consider this duplicity of man. To look
in upon his heart, and see its vital strings worked into carbonic
£ s. d. Terrible, indeed, is it to look a little more than skin-deep into
the brow of STUBBs, broker's clerk, and read, as in his own brass-plate
—“MR. As PHALT STUBBs, CoAL-MERCHANT.”
And, to pursue our text; what shall we say of the insidious, doubling
entleman's servant, with his brass-plate – “MR. J.ENKINs, CoAL-
ERCHANT,” on his private six inches of a door, and his wife lurkin
in the back-parlour to take orders? Terrible is it to contemplate su
deceit: to behold now the powdered head of that carbonic gentleman's
hypocrisy, brazen on a door-plater—from the merely nominal falsehood
twinkling in the midday sun, to ponder the many evils that are born of
this duplicity; evils, that like the frozen snake, fail not to hiss and
declare themselves on the hearth-stone. False coal-merchants make
false weights. It is upon record– and the scandal, like coal-smoke in
a fog, pervades the town while we discourse—that out of forty sacks of
coals, brass-plate coals be it remembered, twenty-six sacks have been
found wanting. And that, whereas a true sack of coals should weigh
two hundred and twenty-four pounds, some of these sacks have lacked
seventy-two pounds, or almost one-third! . One-third weight gone—a
burnt-offering, or money-offering, to the idol brass-plate
My friends,--it may be that with simple folk you have sat about a
winter-fire, and it may be that a fragment of coal, has on the sudden
bounced upon the hearth. And some one may have taken up that bit
of coal, and whilst it tinkled-tinkled with departing heat—may,
with ancient superstition, have sought to divine its shape and ominous
purpose.
... It is a purse,” cries one.
“It is a coffin,” says another; and some declare for the purse, and
others for the coffin.
Now, my friends, let us, suppose the dishonest coal-merchant—the
unjust man of wicked weight—to be of the company. Let us suppose
that the burnt coal is placed in the hollow of his felonious hand.
But let. Punch put a short-thrust question. Is there such a man
amidst this congregation? If there be, Punch declares to him that if,
indeed, the burnt coal be a purse, as it came from fire, so should it
scorch a conscience, with a sense of wicked gains—and if, indeed, it be
a coffin, so should it bring a thought of another sort of plate—very
different from the brass of doors, and telling of a removal to another,
and a ...} different sort of dwelling-place.
Nevertheless, my friends, it takes a dupe, a victim, to make a suc-
cessful rogue. Knaves are fed by simpletons, even as foxes grow sleek
on geese. I doubt not that many of you—coal-merchants of this pit—
have felt saddened by the idleness, or careless simplicity of your
customers, who will not weigh your merchandise at }. cellar door;
who would not, by balance, assure themselves that every sack shot a
full two hundred and twenty-four pounds of coal into the cellar; but
who, doggedly, would take coal-heaver's truth on trust.
Let all such men, when they dreamily gaze into their glowing coals,
see therein not clouds, and mountains, and cities of faery—but let them
hold the likeness of their own foolish faces and over it a flaming
fool's-cap.
And for the coal-merchants—brassy or otherwise—who will sell false
weight, let them, on conviction, be doomed for a certain time to wear
a sqn benito, made from their own coal-sacks, and to drag at their legs
their own nominal iron cwt.
For consider, Q coal-merchants, what it is to give short weight to the
winter poor! Think how, with your avaricious fingers, you pinch poor
children, old men and women, at their speck of fire. Think of the
reward that shall bless your own hearths. Think—
Think; O fraudful coal-merchants, of the disaster that befel a certain
eagle-A’sop's eagle. . For, it is written of that bird, that, once upon a
time, seeing a piece of flesh ready to be sacrificed upon an altar, the
bird made a swoop, and carried it off in her claws. Rejoicingly, the
eagle made for her nest. And, behold, there was a coal—a burning
coal—that stuck to the flesh; and this coal consumed her nest, and
with it her young ones and herself!
, 9 unjust coal-merchants, may not some live coal from your own
light sacks, as strangely fall upon your own domestic substance? May
it not be with you, as with the eagle, that sacrilegious plunder—(and it
is sacrilege to cheat the r and wretched)—may some day bring
destruction upon your own homesteads?
THE LANCET'S DETECTIVE FORCE.
UR contemporary the Lancet has
conferred a great boon on
the public by establishing
a new order of constab-
ulary, which may be called
the Scientific Detective Po-
lice. The function of these
Detectives is to investigate
and expose the fraudulent
adulteration of articles of
food practised by a set of
scoundrels under the names
of grocers and other trades-
men. In his researches into
this rascality, the Lancet's
policeman is assisted by a
microscope, which, in throw-
ing light on the fraud in
question, exerts a power far
superior to that of the com-
mon bull's eye. By the help of this instrument, an immense quantity
of villanous stuff has been discovered in coffee, arrowroot, and other
substances sold for nutriment, and, some of them, “particularly recom-
mended to invalids.” The Lancet seconds the exertions of its intelligent
officer by spiritedly publishing the addresses, of the rogues at whose
swindling establishments the samples of rubbish were purchased. . If
any of the knaves thus pilloried in the Lancet, abetted by a disreputable
attorney and a dishonest barrister, endeavour to avenge, themselves
through the technicalities of the law, Punch hopes they will meet with
twelve true men in the jury-box who will scout both them and
their legal accomplices out of court.

in . many, cases
alike mortal: only in Hindostan the torture is more brief, and the final
peace more certain. In one case death comes in fire; in the other, by
the slower process of a breaking heart, -
LoRD CAMPBELL pities a widow in Chancery. Yes; a few days since
“he did from his heart pity the poor woman,” WIDow GARDINER—
“Who, upon the death of her husband, after having been for years in the Court of
Chancery, was now dragged into a Court of Common Law, whence she would be taken
back to Chancery; and all, so far as appeared, for doing no more than what an honest
woman might do.
“The Jury immediately gave a verdict for the defendant.”
And this verdict takes the defendant back to Chancery, “for doing
no more than an honest woman might do.” The moral of the verdict,
therefore, is, that every woman, being left a widow, should do anything
else than what an honest woman might do -
But MRs. GARDINER is again in Chancery..There she is, to be slowly
consumed by cannibal equity. Now, we ask it, is not the bamboo pile,
with pitch and resin, on the banks of the Ganges, a more humane sen-
tence pronounced by custom, on the Hindoo widow; by a barbarous
usage on a benighted infidel,--than, the slow, devouring system of
Chancery, that, in what is called a Christian country, eats up to the
very bones, the widow and the fatherless?
. The Bastile was stormed and carried by human indignation and
human vengeance; when will the Court of Chancery fall before justice
and common sense?
ENIGMA FOR THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.
FROM the vilest of sources deriving my birth,
I’m familiar with great men and kings of the earth;
From old patches and shreds my existence I draw;
Nay, I may be, indeed, a mere creature of straw:
I’m so light and so thin, with a touch that I’m bent,
Yet a pressure sustain of full fifty per cent!
Though I’m easily torn, I can form, you will find,
Bonds that even a giant securely will bind.
My fair market-price would be not far from nil,
But you may make me worth any sum that you will;
And I constitute riches worth millions of gold
More than all the amount which the Bank cellars hold.
Then I circulate over all nations' wide range
As mankind’s general medium of mental exchange.
I . bear to all parts of the world,
And without me no damsel can have her hair curl’d.
I provide men with servants, who tend them as PAGEs,
And minister to them the wisdom of ages.
Though nearly opaque, light I serve to purvey,
Like your windows, and like them, for doing so, pay;
For in screwing a duty from me, the ixcise
Taxes all publish'd thoughts of the good and the wise,
Which, were I but relieved from this load of taxation,
You’d soon find me diffusing all over the nation;
And then you’d behold, in a very short time,
A vast diminution of evil and crime,
Wrought by me and my two great allies, PEN and INK.
You’ll not want to be told what my name is, I think

Late Hours in Parliament.
NotwitHSTANDING MR BROTHERTON's laudable efforts to get the

judicial effect of late hours on the skin, we wonder the Legislature is
not desirous of wearing a better complexion in the eyes of the public;
which never can be done, if the House will insist on going to bed with
the lark instead of rising with that most matutinal .# animals. Some
of the Irish members are, likely to be fearfully inconvenienced this
session by the after-midnight sittings; for in consequence of the influx
of all sorts of characters into London during 1851, the objection to

SIBTHORP
IN THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
UR friends the citizens
of Lincoln have goo
right to a peculiar pride
in their great political
ToM—the wise Col.
SIBTHoRP. He is in
the present Session as
eep and as clear as
usual. We are told that
the old bell, called the
came cracked in 1827;
but though Lincoln's
political ToM,
“Swinging slow, with sullen
roar,”
has, for many a year,
given thundering note
of warning and alarm
to the whole country, that ToM is, in the present Session of 1851, as sound as ever—quite.
On the first day of Parliament, CoLonel Toyſ tolled thus, in the affrighted ears of the
architect of the Crystal Palace:–
“They might call it success, but he called it failure. He did not wish to see that building destroyed by any
acts of violence, but would to God that some hailstorm, or some visitation of lightning, might descend to defeat
the ill-advised project.”
The citizens of Lincoln cannot but feel their hearts warm and swell with emotion, when
they know that they are made to speak such hopes by such a tongue: that it is to the exercise
of their electoral wisdom we owe the possession of a Senator who prays for hailstorm or
lightning to bring down, with a crash, a fabric destined to awaken the wonder and admi-
ration of millions from, all parts of the earth. It is a tremendous thought, to contemplate
SIBThorp seated upon the ruins of glass—the ruins worked by his own patriotic aspiration.
We, however, trust that SIBTHORP will not be permitted to enter the Crystal Palace.
MR. PAxton, we beg you to take good heed of it; lest SIBTHoRP, hating the Philistine
foreigner, become a second SAMson; for who knows what mysterious strength may sleep in
the SIBThoRPIAN locks? And he has never been shorn, although often by Ministers shame-
fully cut..., Who knows, then, if SIBTHORP find his way into the Crystal Palace, and,
laying hold of the pillars of the transept, he may not bring down horrible devastation?
#.mischief done by that four-footed animal that once wildly danced amid a brood of chickens
would be as nothing to the tremendous moral lesson brought by SIBThoke upon the he
of the foreigner—
“Those two massy pillars
With horrible confusion to and fro,
He tugged, he tore, till down they came, and drew
The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder
Upon the heads of all who sat beneath.”
We begin, to tremble at the imagined horror; and, on reflection, every minute seeing
a growing likeness between SAMson and SIBTHoRP; SAMson-
“On whose shoulders, waving down, those locks,
That of a nation armed the strength contained ;"
and SIBTHoRP, with his meteoric beard,—we do earnestly hope that some member, with the
interest of the Exhibition at heart, will, for the safety of the Crystal Palace, move for
“A Committee, to take into consideration the propriety of shaving Colon EL, SIBTHoRP
once a-week, at least, during the continuance of the Exhibition; that is, from the 1st of May
to the 1st of September inclusive. And that the said shaving shall, to all intents and
urposes, be the closest shave; a shave clean as the hands of the Čiancelion or in
xchequer.”
We believe there are men so fearful of the hirsute energy of the Colonel, that they doubt
the efficacy of mere shaving ; and would have the peril plucked out by the roots. Punch is not
of these : nevertheless, Punch is an earnest advocate for the razor. For Punch, reflecting
upon the powers of that SAMsonIAN weapon which slew the Philistines, and remembering the
like maxillary potency of the Colonel in the Commons—fears that unless the Shaving Com-
mittee be appointed, the Member for Lincoln will, by pulling down the Crystal Palace,
perfect the parallel between himself and the Son of MANOAH. The work of the iaw-bone
will be completed to a hair.

SIR CHARLES NAPIER'S FAREWELL FIRE.
ON quitting the Indian army, SIR CHARLEs, NAPIER has discharged among his own
troops a tremendous broadside, which, if it hits its mark, will be a death blow to the
ºd folly by which not only the army, but every class of society is more or less
degraded.
Not the military ranks alone, but every rank in life, may profit by the vigorous assault
that SIR CHARLEs NAPIER has made upon humbug and dishonesty. He shows that it is idle
for officers to boast of the valour with which they meet the charge of the foe, when
they are obliged to sneak and shuffle away from the charges of their creditors. . As long as
a soldier cannot pay the debt, he owes to his tailor or his wine-merchant, he is degraded,
however much he may pride himself on the manner in which he discharges the debt he owes
his country.... An officer cannot honourably draw his sword, so long as disreputable
mortgages will not allow him to draw his pay for his necessary expenses. -
There is something so completely after our own hearts, in the way in which NAPIER calls
Tom of Lincoln, be-
things by their proper names, that we can scarcely
refrain from singing “Charley's my darling,” as
we peruse his spirited orders to the Indian Army.
He denounces as it deserves, the miserable
d| errors of living beyond one's means,—a low-
spirited vice which is the curse of nearly the
whole of the “professional” classes of society.
The world must be knocked out of its snobbish
struggles for “appearances,” and we gladly hail
such a colleague as Sir Charles Napier, in the
office of putter down of that hateful humbug,
which seeks respect by living far beyond one's
income, often swindling one's creditors, and
leaving one's family to beggary. If a man is
known to have a thousand a year, he must needs
live at the rate of fifteen hundred: a proceed-
ſing, which among those who take the trouble
to calculate, will show that he must be defraud-
|ing somebod y, and going to the dogs, at the rate
of five hundred per annum.
| Instead of making it a point to live within
one's means, the vulgar ambition of the present
day is to live without them. Oh! for a few
sensible men in every class, to set the example
of making, literally, a virtue of necessity, by
doing honour to those who live in accordance
with their circumstances however narrow. Let
the rich spend their money as freely, or waste it
as foolishly as they please, but let us knock for
ever on the head the footmanlike idea that the
having or throwing away of money is, in itself,
respectable, and that to live as if we had it, when
we really have it not, is anything but swindling
of the lowest description. SIR CHARLEs NAPIER
has done a great deal towards the promulgation
of this wholesome doctrine, and we must say that,
notwithstanding all the good he has done in the
service of India, nothing has become him better
than his last act in leaving it. -

forcing it, as well as they are able, simply by
the moral power of the crosier; in other words,
by hook or by 'crook. To compensate them for
the loss of their territorial sees, they are to be
located in palaces which will be selected from
the numerous castellated edifices situated in the
region of the atmosphere; and are to be digni-
fied by the exalted titles of Archbishops and
Bishops in nubibus.

MR. FERRAND WITHOUT “A PEAL.”
Count Ry paper, the
Yorkshire Gazette, has
a fling_at a “Free
Trade Parson” who
| would not consent
that the bells of
| Pocklington Church
should ring a peal in
* honour of the arrival
of MR. FERRAND,
about to enact his
favourite political
part of Sheepface;
that part, as most
of our readers may
know, consisting
chiefly in the vari-
ous intonation of
“Baa-a,” the poor
#7 fellow being sheep-
H_ stricken, or other-
wise having his brains
set wool-gathering.
MR. FERRAND has º: this character to very large audiences;
and, though we fear will not make a very great sensation with
his “Baa-a” in the Theatre Royal, St. Stephen's, it must never-
theless be conceded to his genius, that few men have made more
of the sheep's cry, the great cry with much wool (in futuro), than
has MR. FERRAND in some of his, agricultural engagements. But
touching the political peal of bells in honour of the advent of the actor,
our charity would fain hold the incumbent of Pocklington guiltless of
any wilful disrespect to MR; FERRAND. The reverend gentleman may
haply believe that it is not the function of Church bells to peal out at
once a welcome and an advertisement on the arrival of any exhibitor,
histrionic or political: and further, Pocklington's incumbent duly
considering the peculiar powers of FERRAND, might think even
the least amount of bell-metal unnecessarily thrown away upon a man,
who has ever such a stock of sounding brass at his own command.

CHEAP EXCURSIONS FROM OXFORD TO ROME.
As soon as the Exhibition begins to throw open its doors, the season
for Cheap Excursions will be in full train, addition to the many
trips which will be covering Europe with lines, as close as a cobweb
we understand it is the intention of MR. St. BARNABAS BENNETT an
others to start a series of Cheap Excursions from Qxford to Rome.
One great peculiarity of these Excursions will be, that they will not
come back again. Once at Rome, the excursionists will be compelled
to remain there, for no return tickets will be issued. -
Communications will be entered into with all the Puseyite chapels in
the kingdom, and great facilities offered to all Puseyite clergymen to
carry them to Rome as quickly as possible. -
Persons travelling by these Cheap Excursions, will be provided with
tickets to the Vatican, and no extra charge demanded.
Arrangements are pending, by which it is hoped the Committee will
have it in their power to throw in as a bonus to each train, a certain
number of introductions to the Pope, who has kindly condescended to
lend his toe on these occasions, for the use of such excursionists as
*: a holy fervour to kiss it.
l, the mumerous places of public resort in Rome, its gorgeous

THE POPE'S WALENTINE TO THE CARDINAL.
To NICHOLAs, in sore affliction,
PIUs sends Peace and Benediction.
The daisy’s pied, the violet’s blue,
The rose is red, and so are you.
I dyed you with that tint of ochre;
I made you like a red-hot poker;
And now, what I shall have to do,
Will be to drop you like one, too.
Indeed, indeed, my Man of Red,
My Holin Ess you’ve much misled:
You told me that the Pear was ripe,
And º waited for my gripe:
You of the British public spoke,
As quite prepared to don my yoke.
I acted upon what you said;
And here’s a pretty mess I’ve made 1–
Utter'd a peal of empty thunder,
And launch'd a Bull which proves a blunder.
Submit to me! They would be caught
As soon confessing JuggBRNAUT,
SERAPIs, BRAHMA, Wopen, AMMON:
#. vote my claims mere gammon,
My high pretensions joke and jest on,
Or, worse, examine what they rest on.
Who, sense and reason have deserted
For me—that is, have been converted?
We’ve had no luck among the masses;
Some few of the “superior classes”
Have joined us—manifestly raving,
Or else for mere excitement craving;
Parsons the rest, and of a College
Famed for the dearth of useful knowledge.
Cambridge, that EUCLID's lore -
Sends scarce a soul to kiss my :
From Oxford come our chief recruits—
Monastic education's fruits,
That in choice Latin fudge can speak,
Write monsense cleverly in Greek,
Couch in good Hebrew silly thought,
But are in Science quite untaught.
We get no men in high positions,
As Chemists, Surgeons, or Physicians,
Astronomers, Geologists,
Political Economists;
No Statesman sage to us succumbs;
To us no famous Jurist comes;
Your own’s the only EMINENCE
To which in England we’ve pretence.
Expecting an immense secession,
Imake a premature aggression;
Into a flame all England flashes,
Rakes up the MARIAN martyrs’ ashes;
Cries out on HILDEBRAND's ambition,
And twits us with the Inquisition;
Recounts our massacres, and gathers
The pious frauds of holy fathers—
Things that had out of memory grown,
# but let John BULL alone:
But now, these awkward points are mooted,
Qur tenets questioned and confuted,
And many, on their quiet way
To Rome, warned off, I’m bold to say.
Qur progress will at present cease;
At least, my subjects won't increase;
§ this same storm, in my opinion,
Will blow down some of my dominion.
You instigated me to brew it,
And I was blind enough to do it.
If, as is likely, you’re unseated,
Infallibility’s defeated.
Small thanks to you, from me and mine,
Although you are my VALENTINE.
A PORE AT THE PAPER DUTY,
It is the general opinion that the CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequen
should do something with respect to Paper. We decidedly think he
ought to turn over a new leaf.

JANE WILBRED, AND JANE WILBRED's Box.
THE SLoanes, man and wife—brute of brute, and wretch of wretch-
have confessed, and are sentenced. They are to have two years impri-
*sonment: and without hard labour. They are to be withdrawn awhile
daily handiwork. And they will have warm, decent raiment and bed-
ding: they who starved, striped, and outraged to the national scandal,
their workhouse victim!
Wherefore was JANE WILBRED wholly assaulted in her person?
Very nearly did her persecutors break into “the house of life:" a little
more, and the wretched drudge would have slipped through their fury
hands. . But JANE WILBRED, on the very threshold of death, is
avenged; and the monsters who outraged the sanctity of human
nature in her person, are imprisoned, without labour for-two years.
What a pity that JANE WILBRED suffered alone! What a pity that
her box—if indeed she had one-had not been as roughly handled as
JANE WILBRED's suffering body! Had the deal lid been forced, and a
riband valued twopence, a cap, a comb, been taken therefrom by
either of the Sloanes; then would the law have arrayed itself in
tremendous terrors; then would it have pronounced imprisonment-
transportation it might be, with daily slavery. But it was only human
flesh that, was striped; only human feelings that were outraged; and
the evil-doers, the evil not being worked upon property, have the
milder punishment. - -
How lucky for the Sloanes that they ill-used only JANE WILBRED,
and spared JANE WILBRED's box!
The Romish Calendar.
| THE Pope, out of compliment to his French allies, is about to find
room in the Calendar for a new Saint, who, it is universally acknow-

been shed in the Saint's behalf—the noblest champion that the Romish
Church has had for centuries past. The name of this new, Saint, we
have full permission to mention, is to be “Sainte Baronnette.”

MR. RoºBUCK's DEGREE.
Poor Roebuck is represented by the newspaper reports as having
delivered, in the course of the debate on the Address, a quibbling,
crotchetty, and disingenuous º on behalf of the Pope, characterised
y gross insolence towards Lord John Russelſ, and containing,
amongst many remarks beneath contempt, the following observation
worthy of some notice:–
“He might himself to-morrow parcel out the kingdom if he could get anybody to join
him, and call himself D.D. or A.S.S., if he pleased.”
. If MR. Roebuck, really vented the nonsense imputed to him by the
journals, it is probable that his gross ignorance of the relation of Papal
authority to political government—which even Roman Catholic legis-
latures are obliged to regulate—will allow few to join him in an attempt
to dub himself D.D., in any other sense than that of Double Dunce.
The other degree which

of º Barefooted Beg-
, a letter received by
im from one of his order
now in London—(who,
not too much to shock
º
ad received a dispensa-
tion from his Holiness
permitting him, whilst
on his mission, to wear
shoes)—a letter that has
been milk and honey to
all our bosoms.
“We were glad to learn
—for it is not our desire
to be uplifted by the vic-
tory that our prayers
have given to us—that
Lambeth Palace has been
quietly rendered up to
his Eminence the Cardinal; and that FATHER IGNATIUS, his mission
being done in Liverpool, will take peaceable possession of the abode
of the blessed BonnER, too long—for sins of ours—possessed by
heretical Bishops of London. -
“We are all at work upon a beautiful carpet for St. PAUL's ; and—
either by incessant labour or miracle-trust to have it ready by the
1st of April, when the Cardinal of London is to be enthroned in that
edifice; smatched, at length, like a burning brand to the true faith.
“We are a little anxious about the opening of Parliament; never-
theless the fraternal correspondent of FATHER LAZARus—who gives
the most faithful and the most minute account of all that is passing in
your City—assures us that LQRD John, his eyes a little opening to the
regenerated, condition of England, has allowed the introduction of six
little boys in the procession—(six to begin with)—to ºf censers
before the cream-coloured horses on their way from the Palace to
the Lords.
“They tell us that the day is not yet fixed when LoRD TRURo shall
give up the seals, to the Cardinal of Westminster; nevertheless, the
change is only a little delayed. Anyway, a beautiful milk-white mule
will i. sent from the stables of his Holiness, for the use of the
Cardinal on his visits to Chancery; and at this minute the nuns, of
St. Gammoni, with the nuns of St. Špinaccio, are employed embroider-

‘I cannot express to you what delight it is to us to have all the news
from England—all of it, as true and as particular, sent in the letters of
our missionaries—as though we were on the spot itself.

to go with a party of noble converts—the GREENYARDs and the St.

“The only revenue of the monks is derived from the sale of the eggs

IDon't Believe it unless You Like.
It has been rumoured that MEssBs. PickroRD AND Co., the great
carriers, have been desired to send, in a tender for the carrying of all
the Government Measures during the present session. It is expected
the saving of time and expence will be prodigious, if the arrangement
can be effected; for it is found that there is nothing so dear, slow,

THE SERVANTS’ HALL.
FELLow-SERVANTs, gather round me, while I speak upon our wrongs;
They are plain as yonder poker, and they pinch like yonder tongs.
Poker-like I now would stir you—into blazes break your ire;
Throw a shovel-full of Wallsend on your indignation’s fire.
Listen! Iisten!, Bells are ringing in my fancy's heated ear:
At the will of fellow-mortals we are summon'd to appear!
Would that every hated clapper on the ear of freedom fell,
Like the dirge of every despot, like oppression's parting knell!
Why are you or I, my comrades, at another person's call,
To be hurried, willy nilly, from the cheerful Servants' Hall?
Shall we stop the lively story, shall we check the jocund glee,
When a master wants his slippers, or a mistress wants her tea?
Must we quit the downy pillow, when soft slumber still we crave?
Must we rise to boil the water in which our tyrants shave 2
Shall we soil our freeborn fingers still to deck another's foot,
And throw a dazzling polish on the proud oppressor's boot?
You, partners of my sorrow, companions of my grief,
ou know how, in succession, we’ve dined two days on beef;
You know, the bread, on Monday, was very nearly stale,
And, bitterness on bitterness thick was the bitter ale.
You groan with indignation—Yes! Yes! 'tis time to rise
'Gainst common Dorset butter, and dripping-crusted pies—
'Gainst Holland's cheaper cheeses 'tis time we should a
'Gainst the hashing of the mutton, and the mincing of the veal.
Why should we take the fragments of joints commenced up stairs?
Our tyrants take the first cuts—then let the last be theirs.
Reflecting on such treatment the suffering spirit groans;
They take the primest slices—be theirs as well the bones |
But oh! my ill-used comrades! These are not our only woes,
For e'en our little perquisites they frequently oppose;
They would check the flow of commerce, bid the tradesman's traffic cease,
In the pan of paltry dripping and the pot of useless grease.
How they curb the kindly feelings that betwixt us should prevail,
And would place 'twixt loving cousins the area's iron rail:
How they trample down affection, and crush the spirit kind
That would in each policeman a near relation find
The laws of hospitality they coldly set aside,
Nor suffer us for visitors a table to provide.
What harm, my fellow-servants, can any of you see,
In asking each a friend or two to dinner and to tea?
And then the utter selfishness, that uses not, nor lends,
The wardrobe that on shelves or drawers its freshness all expends;
If the tyrant is not wearing it—oh, wherefore, tell me pray,
Should I not wear his coat for him, to-morrow or to-day?
How could it ever signify, how is the tyrant hurt,
If, just to keep it air’d a bit, I wear the tyrant's shirt 2
And when he’s nearly done with them, as long as no one knows,
What harm to him or any, if I go and sell his clothes?
Of our woes the dismal catalogue 'twere easy to F.
But mournful would the story be and profitless the song;
Then rise for retribution—and listen to the call,
Which seeks to bring the good old times back to the Servants' Hall.
-
I)istress on Wheels.
THAT long-suffering body, the coach-body, or body of coachmakers,
has had a pathetic interview with the CHANGELLOR of THE ExchEQUER,
in order to obtain his sympathy with the distresses of the trade. The
coachmakers handsomely suggest that all carriages be placed
“Under three classes only, at reduced rates, commencing with £3 for the highest,
£2 for the next, and £1 for the lowest, exempting none, as at present, but charging them
with the lowest rate.”
We only hope that a part of what my Lord Duke 'pays for his state
carriage will not be taken off and laid upon the pony gig-somethin
bigger than a tea-chest on wheels—kept by the invalid upon a sm
annuity.
A CONGENIAL TASTE.
WE are informed that Leicester Square has been taken for an exhibi-
tion of MR. WYLD's. We do not wonder at that locality attracting his
notice, inasmuch as, for years past, the Square has presented the most
perfect model of a Wyld Exhibition.

MR. BRIGHT AND “HIS EMINENCE.”
* ExtraEMEs MEET.”
A HOPE FOR LEICESTER SQUARE.
A PROPosition is now before the
land at Leicester Square, and we believe a party of huntsmen are
already engaged in exterminating the catty tribes that have long in-
fested the spot, and rendered it dismal, after nightfall, with the howings
of the feline inhabitants. Miń. WYLD, the great geographer of Charing
Cross, who has opened up to us in his maps so much of the world, 6
which we should otherwise be ignorant, has a plan for civilising a spot
which has hitherto been as completely a desert—as far as all useful
purposes are concerned—as Sahara's sand or Libya's dusty level.
It is proposed to bring all the world to Leicester Square, by throwin
over the railings, the Great Globe which Mr. WYLD has º an
which will enable us to visit every corner of the earth in a quarter-of-
an-hour., If the scheme should be carried out, and the world is safely
deposited in Leicester Square, it is in contem lation to rent the tops of
the adjoining houses for the erection of a º: Solar System, in order
tº make the allegory complete; and we have heard that the proprietor
of a highly effective Moon is already in treaty for the tiles of the LIN-
woon Gallery.
If Leicester Square can be rescued from the state in which it has for
ears been lying, almostuntrodden by the foot of man, though constantly

we say, can be effected, whoever accomplishes it will deserve a statue

Reporter, is to be made a Cardinall
GEMS OF PARLIAMENTARY ELOQUENCE.
ANY one who looks over the debates in the Houses of Parliament,
and not having time to read the whole wishes to make the best selec-
tion of the most telling points, would of course be naturally guided by
the “cheers,” “hears,” and other exclamations of delight which may be
supposed to have been elicited by the most effective passages. We
ourselves tried the experiment the other day, and taking the speech of
one of the cleverest of speakers, MR. Disraeli, we were attracted by
the “hears” and “cheers” to the following, which we are therefore
justified in quoting under the splendid title of “Gems of Parliamentary
oquence.”
“Now the average price of meat in 1850 was 3s. 8d." (Loud cheers from the
Protectionists.)
A few sentences further on—the gap having been filled up with some
allusions to mutton at 5s. 2d.-we arrive at this exciting passage:-
“The average of 1850, after two years of temporary depression, was only 4s.2d."
(Renewed cheering from the same quarter.)
|. After this ecstacy on the price of muttons—prime and inferior—had
in some degree subsided, we find no very strong proof of excitement
amºng the hearers of the great orator until he comesto a passage which
partakes rather too much of the old legitimate clap-trap to suit our
taste, but it seemed to go down splendidly with the House of
It ran thus:—
- º injustice was done to the noble character of the British farmer.” (Lºd
| The word “British” used always to be the cue for at least three
rounds of applause from the galleries of a theatre; but this species of
enthusiasm º been long banished from the º -house, and taken root,
it seems, in another house, where “the British Farmer” greate

he speech goes on quietly enough, interarded with a few ordinary
symptoms of approbation, and a somewhat enthusiastic ebullition of
“hear" at the word "Tobacco," until the honourable orator, basin
f. ed such a hearty round of applause for mentioning the “Britis
armer,” tries him again under the title of the “British Agriculturist.”
This is followed by renewed “cheers,” which are scarcely met with
through, several succeeding paragraphs, until we find a regular hurricane
of delight at the mention º “British barley.”
The above having been the most applauded, and we presume, there-
fore, the most interesting portions of a long oration by one of the ablest
of political orators, we have a right to regard them as Gems of Par-
liamentary Eloquence. Whether the specimens we have offered will be
so attractive to the general reader, that he will go through the whole of
the debates, as reported day by day in the morning papers, it is not for
us to determine. We º we find the Gems quite enough for us,
and scarcely worth the trouble of digging for in the mine of Parlia:
mentary intelligence that we are expected to explore every morning at
breakfast-time.

Paved with Good Intentions.
THE old proverb says, “Don’t holloa till you’re out of the Wood.”
Regent Street, Oxford Street, and many other localities, do not act
apparently upon this very sensible advice; for they are along way from
being “out of the Wood;” and yet, as every omnibus, cab, and
carriage-horse knows, you are stopped at every second step by a most
tremendous hollow.
CAUSE AND EFFECT.
MR. Qswald, with a triumphant air, told LoRD Rysseſ.I. that CAR-
DINAL WISEMAN, contemptuous of all measures, “would snap his
fingers.” People generally do, when they have burnt them.
A “Strictly Irish View.”
MR. MooRE would vote for Dish AELI against RusseIL, because
Loºp Jons" had excited the rancour and hate of a deluded º:
against the benign fraternity of the Pope. Thus, MR. MooRE did not
vote for a return to the Protection of the Corn Laws, but for Pro-
tection of Pio Nono.—Not for taxed wheat; but for free trade scarlet
stockings! Truly “a strictly Irish view.”
VERY GOOD GENERALSHIP.

Mr. Punch has been favoured with a view of the sort of dress

matically cut, being cut, as closely as possible, to indicate the lowness

a hole in it, further to illustrate the melancholy fact that the County

With gentle force the victims drive away,
Whilst cleavers ring, and marrow-bones resound
As they, in graceful movements, beat the ground.

In yonder baths their weariedlimbs extend,
And then retire, a copious meal to share,
With palates sharpen'd by the fragrant air.

MINERAL MANURE.
(To Mr. Punch.)
&:
“THERE's a potion o' MR. DISRAELI's spache about agri-
culteral distress as drat if I can make out nohow. He says, 'cordin' to
the Times:–
“The theory of M. LIEBNPrz was the application of mineral manure to the soil.’
“LIEBNITz, I take it, is a mistake of the printer's, for t'other feller
whose neam begins wi' iſe, as taches us to cure the poorness of the

º ouncers he tells I’ll warrant un. But what’s his “miner

how the agriculteral classes
“‘Were still told to apply more capital to the land.’
“What do this here mane, Mr. Punch & Is capital what they calls
‘mineral manoeuver?” Be we tº º: our pusses into a siv, and goo and

“P.S.–I spose ‘mineral manoeuver’ is to prodoose a golden harvust.

WHO SHALL DECIDE WHEN JUDGES DISAGREE?
(By our Reporting Poet and Poetical Reporter.)
1st Judge. Now this is a case of appeal,
Requiring our closest attention;
What each on the subject may fee
I beg of him freely to mention.
2nd Judge. I think the conviction a wrong one,
3rd Judge. My judgment is opposite quite;
4th Judge. The point that’s reserved is a strong one,
But I think the conviction was right,
5th Judge. There ought to have been an acquittal,
6th Judge. The verdict of guilty must stand.
7th Judge. I rely on the case, R. v. SPITAL. .
8th Judge. That was never the law of the land.
9th Judge. They ought to have had but one trial.
10th Judge. I think had the peril been less;
Of&#. 'twould be a denial:
11th Judge. fjustice I think there’s excess.
12th Judge. e parties were perill'd twice over,
Both times for the selfsame offence.
13th Judge. For that view of the case I discover
In the books not the smallest pretence.
14th Judge. The duty devolves upon me
The tribunal's decision to state,
Since all of us cannot agree
The majority’s voice will have weight.
My opinion is certainly strong,
'Tis irregular twice to indict:
So I think the conviction was wrong,
But I say the conviction was right.
Arch Waggery.
SOME economists in the House of Commons are complaining of the
expense of removing the Marble Arch; when, if some less remote site
ſº been chosen than Cumberland Gate, the arch might have been
within a stone's throw of its former position; and thus, by pitching it
rather, strong, the whole work of removal could have been done by
hand, instead of by horses and waggons.
An Index in Petticoats.
THE Sun says:—
“At the Queen's Printing Office, in New Street Square, is a middle-aged woman with
a wonderful head. She recollects the year and the chapter of every act of Parliament
upon auy subject.”
We understand it is the intention of MR. HuME, at an early day, to
move that this woman—“Be bound, and placed upon a convenient
shelf of the House of Commons' library.”
TRAVELS INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE
CRYSTAL PALACE.
“A GENTLEMAN WITH A wooDEN_LEG" writes to us, complaining
of the vast extent of the º Palace. He dreads having to go
through it. He says it will be nothing less than an immense expedi-
tion, the fatigues of which he is little prepared to encounter. He
doubts if many people, unless they are blessed with the legs and consti-
tution of CAPTAIN BARCLAY, will be able to do it. . He, for one, is not
going to walk twenty or thirty miles a day, navigating the narrow
channels in which the counters are to lie at anchor. How ladies will
manage, he is fairly at a loss to imagine. Why, the walk from one end
of the Exhibition to the other will be quite enough of itself to knock
them up!—and to expect them, after that, to promenade down half-a-
dozen miles of counters, crowded with steam-engines and monster
lumps of coal, is to expect what no lady, unless she is a farmer's
daughter, or an Acrobat, can i.
He suggests that a cabstand º t be established in the Centre Pro-
menade, or that omnibuses should be allowed to run, taking passengers,
which they might easily do, for 6d. “all the way;” “or, if that was all,”
inquires our grumbling correspondent, “why couldn't a miniature
railway be laid down?”. Two lines of rails—for an up and down train—
would be all that would be necessary, and a train might start every
quarter of an hour, . Otherwise, without some such expeditious means,
one will never be able to get over the ground.
Our wooden-legged contributor runs on in the above strain for several
pages; and at last he thinks he has discovered a simple remedy for the
tº: difficult state of things. This remedy is nothing more nor less
than-
A Moving PANORAMA of THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
He proposes, for the convenience of persons, who are not fond of
walking, or who have not the spare ** the strength, to walk
* twenty miles of counters, that the objects exhibited on
those counters should be represented in ºº:: of canvas, or,
rhaps, ten miles would be quite sufficient. visitors are to sit
own in comfortable chairs, whilst the collection of wonders is being
slowly unrolled before them. -
That the room, in which the Panorama is to be exhibited, should be
fitted in glass, as much like the Crystal Palace itself as possible, so as
to assist the imagination. -
That a Professor of all the Arts and Sciences should deliver a rapid
lecture, explanatory of the history and rise of the various products of
the earth as they respectively appear upon the canvas. -- - - -
That appropriate music should be played during the Exhibition,
introducin . the national melodies, from the Hebrew melodies down
to those of Ethiopia. -
That the Panorama might terminate with a Grand Allegory (say) of
Peace and Industry, with all the Nations of the World shaking hands,
and forming a sort of manual shield on which PRINCE ALBERT is being
lifted up to the skies.
That the price of the Panorama do not exceed One Shillin

person will be enabled to go through the Crystal jº. comfortably

LABOUR AND THE RICH.
(From our Special Correspondent.)
PARLIAMENT—ITS LABOUR AND ITS LABOURERS.
“MR. PUNCH,
“Now that the Correspondents of the Morning Chronicle have
exhausted the subject of “Labour and the Poor,' I deeply feel the
painfully interesting nature of the investigation you have trusted me to
make into the almost untrodden field of ‘Labour and the Rich.”
I hope that in the course of this inquiry no strength of sympathy I
may feel for the unfortunate class whose condition I am describing
j warp my views, or colour my conclusions. I am to give you facts,
and to leave your readers to draw their conclusions. It is thus I under-
stand my duty. - - -
“Many persons will, at first sight, be astonished to find “labour'
and ‘the rich’ brought together. They are accustomed to think that
work is the lot of the poor, and that the curse of Adam has, somehow,
been slipped off the shoulders of that half of his posterity which, in the
vulgar phrase, is born “with a silver spoon in its mouth.’ I trust that
these letters may remove this most erroneous impression, and show the
rich as the
- under-paid
are without any question—the 'most over-worked and
ass of the British community. . - -
“I commenced my inquiries in a field of industry which the wisdom
of our ancestors has reserved strictly for the rich, viz., the House of
| Commons.
at the number of slips in a statute
an Act of Parliament is ill-drawn,
“Accustomed as we are to read, night after night during the session,
that the House rose at one, two, or even three in the morning, how
seldom do we devote a thought to the lot of those who are compelled to
get up thus early in the morning! But É. as must be the fatigue of
such hours, their lateness, or, rather, earliness, is nothing, as compared
with the exhausting nature of the work in which the time is occupied.
“Of all who, morning after morning, skim the close-printed columns
of the debates in the Times, how few give a moment's compassion to the
over-worked operatives, to the toil of whose wretched nights we owe
these long-drawn tissues of print. When we feel inclined to grumble
or are about to get angry because
ſet us remember the hot and steaming
‘shop' where the manufacture of legislation is carried on, under the
glare of gas, and the intolerable din of prosy oratory—the dizzying whirl
of arguments almost always moving in a circle—the chopping of stale
logic—the endless drawing out of the same small staple of matter into
those interminable yarns, for the production of which our House of
Commons is so . famous.
“When we think that the place where our Acts of Parliament are
manufactured is of this Manchester School, who can wonder that the
wearied wits should, now, and then, turn out, clauses which courts
cannot unravel, or the reeling brains spin a section too rotten to resist
even the bluntest point of the most bungling barrister?
“Much sympathy has been expressed for the §. little slubbers, and
piecers, and winders of Lancashire or West Riding cotton mills; but
your correspondent will probably be the first to direct the stream
of pity towards the poor slubbers, and piecers, and winders of our
St. Stephen's law factory. -
“In the course of my Parliamentary inquiry I mixed freely with all
classes of the workmen in the House of Commons; from the hard-
featured old reformer of seventy, who remembered Peterloo and QUEEN
CAROLINE, down to the stripling private secretary, with the toſſy of
| the public school hardly dry upon his lip, and the greenness of the
University still visible in his eye. I found amongst all a great readiness
to give information so soon as they knew that I was not a Financial
Reformer in disguise, with a strong sense of the misery of their posi-
tion, and a sort of hopelessness of any change for the better, which
was most touching.
“‘I’ve been working here, let me see, these eight-and-thirty years, I
think, come next. August,” said a grey-haired and hard-featured old
man, whom his fellow-workmen called Joey, ‘I’m used to it now; but
it’s cruel hard work at my time of life. Do I feel the confinement?
In course I do: but I’m stronger than some, and hav’n’t much taste
for amusements, as they call 'em. I suck, an orange, now and then,
before I go to work, and it does me good, But I always was long-
winded, and don't feel the want of sleep much. Do I ever go to sleep
º at my work? No; but I’ve seen others asleep, lots of times,
while I’ve been i. my own yarn. I’ve seen them stretched out
on the benches like lobsters on a shop-front, snoring, that you could
hear it, through all the row.
“The Speaker’s kind to us. He don’t wake them up. He knows
they’d be asleep again in no time; especially the 3. 'uns. I
suppose he winks at it. Of course they oughtn't to be asleep. We
ain’t sent here to go to sleep. There’s a chap that º them up, now
and then. He’s called the ‘whipper-in.” They try to hide themselves,
of course; but he finds them out. Do they turn out work when
they’re so sleepy? Of course there must be slips now and then, and
the measures are sometimes badly put together. It would be a wonder
if they weren’t. I think it would be an improvement, if we didn't
work, so late. Have they tried to shorten time? Oh, yes. There’s
one BRotherton, he's a great short-time man. He tries it on every
year. Our masters won't listen to him, of course.
“I don't think times have changed for the worse, Some fancy so.
I think I’m comfortabler myself. They used me very badly when I first
came to the work. They called me “Jacobin’ and ‘Radical,’ and I’ve
seen when I couldn’t stand up hardly for the hard things they’d throw
at me. I worked at the same style of article then as I do now. The
don’t call me names now. I suppose it’s that times have changed.
I haven’t.
“Do I think there’s waste in the shop?, Don't I just 1 I always
said there was. There’s waste of words, I’m sure, and a t waste
i was when iſ first

call a comfortable er—a chop or so, most days, close at hand. We
haven't time to go home often... I may have worked twelve hours at a
spell; not often that; but eight and nine often. The article we’re at
work on now is called ‘Papal Aggression.” . It’s stuff, I think. Others
don't think so. I sticks up for my own opinion,
“It will take us a long time to get it out of hand, I'm afraid. I
don't like the cut of it. It’s a Roman pattern—but I don't see any
thing in it. . I’ve often designed things. Yes, that’s a little thing of
my own design I’ve got in my hat there. ... I won't show it you, 'cause
you might crib it. º: you, but I don't drink—except tea now and
then—can't afford anything stronger. I don't see what business it is
of yours whether I’ve saved a trifle of money, or not. I believe I’ve a
good character in the shop, and out of it too, if you come to that.”
. Leaving this veteran, who had a geniality about him, which
impressed me in his favour, despite all his hardness of face and manner,
I next addressed myself to a poor young man, apparently about thirty,
but fatigue might have sº im. His heartrending communication I
must reserve for a second letter.

PROTECTION FOR HOUSEWIVES.
“DEAR MR. PUNCH,
“PACKING up some' things in the news-
paper, one day last, week, I happened to notice a
speech made in Parliament, by MR. DisPAELI;
and in it a passage so interesting that I thought
* cut it out and send it to you. Here
lu is :-
“‘The average price of meat in 1848 was 4s. 53d. That
was the average of the temporary depression. Now, the
average price of meat in 1850 (taking it from the official
return from Smithfield) was 3s. 83d. (Loud cheers from
the Protectionists.)”
“Most tlemen talking politics, I have ob-
served, ridicule the Protectionists, and say they
know nothing about political economy. W.
now, I think there is great economy in paying
3s. 8d., instead of 4s. 5}d. for meat; and 1 must
say, I think it was very natural and sensible of
the Protectionists to cheer at the idea of such
a saving, and I shall try all I can to persuade
John to vote for their side at the next election.
“Your sincere admirer,
“MARTHA NoTABLE.
“P.S.. I suppose what Protectionists want is
to protect us from being imposed upon, and to
make everything as reasonable as they can. There
can be no nonsense in that. M. N.”

WRECK OF THE GLASS SHIP.
Some months ago, poor WILLIAM BALL–the artificer of a beautiful
glass ship—suffered shipwreck somewhere, unless we are mistaken, in
the dangerous roads of Ludgate-hill. A cab drove aboard of the crystal
vessel and smashed it; and as poor WILLIAM BALL was not insured by
the underwriters, his daily bread—as honestly traded for by his graft-
suffered total shipwreck. The ship was worth about £10; and BALl,
t together about one-fourth of the amount, and with a stout hopeful
heart, set to workto blow and build himself another craft. May it be
more prosperous than the last vessel— -
“Built i' th' eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark!"
Well, last week, glass-shipwright BALL appeared at Guildhall. He
had finished his new ship. he wanted of the magistrate was the
loan often shillings for a glass case to cover the craft. Ten shillings,
your worship, and WILLIAM BALL would pay back the mºney in weekly
instalments of 3s. The money was given-yery properly bestowed, a
free gift—and WILLIAM BALI, departed, a richer and a happier man.
| There is something fine and touching in the independence and energy
of poor WILLIAM BALL. There is his ship, shipwrecked, shivered upon
the hard, hungry stones of London; and the shipowner is utterly
ruined. His fate as wretched, hopeless, as * Antonio, or other
| “royal merchant,” with his argosy wrecked on the Goodwins. But
WILLIAM BALL plucks up heart, and there is an excellent, good man,
the Rev. M.R. Lyons, of Whitechapel, who helps him with a *
two-shillings' worth of bread—unprotected bread, MR. DISRAELI-an
to work goes WILLIAM BALL, and with the º donation of
the Guildhall ten shillings, he has now ready his new glass ship-his
new trader amid the shoals and straits of London, - - -
We really think this is a case for LLOYD's. There is an energetic
independence—a cheerfulness under calamity—as shown by this poor
WILLIAM BALL, that might teach a useful lesson, preach an exalting
sermon, to many a rich man, suddenly pauperised by winds and waves.
We should not at all be surprised, if “a few gentlemen at LLOYD's"
made up a little matter for WILLIAM BALL, the glass-shipwright, for-
warding the same to him, with their good wishes, “to the care of SIR
CHAPMAN MARSHALL, Guildhall.”

open, it will be a great #. to induce the Public to visit any other

sure to defy all counter-attraction.

MACREADY'S FAREWELL,
MR. PUNCH's last advices from º bring intelligence of a great
stir in that quarter. The shade of SHAKSPEARE, with the shades of
GARRick, KEMBLE, and KEAN, as shades in waiting, will be at Drury
Lane on Wednesday next, the 26th, on the farewell performance of
MACREApy. A very handsome bit of laurel has been provided by SHAK-
sPEARE for the occasion; whilst the great spectral actors will have their
tributary bouquets of asphodei and amaranth to dedicate as theirofferings.
Were Punch sovereign despot of England—which he has no wish to
be, except on special occasions, and the one he is about to name is cer:
tainly one of the most special—he would exact tremendous bail of
MR. MACREADY that he should, in the course of the next summer
make certain appearances; and if such bail were not given, Mr. Punch
would commit MR. MACREADy, under close guard, to-let us, say, the
Star and Garter, Richmond, with the range of the Park, sending him with
a guard of honour (and safety) to the Haymarket. Theatre, personally to
put in the following appearances, for the instruction and pleasure of the
several foreign nations, to be represented by their peoples, here in
London, during the Great Show. e ought, at least, to prove what we
can do in tragedy; therefore, Punch would hold MR., MACREADy
responsible for such exhibition. Hence, MR. MACREADY should play—
Hamlet, for the visitors from Denmark;
Cardinal hºolsey, to the folks from Rome;
Prospero, to the Milanese; -
Benedict, to the gentry from Messina;
King Lear, to the Ancient Britons, wherever they might come from ;
Othello and Iago, to the Moors and Venetians;
Claude Melnotte, to the ladies from Lyons;
Richelieu, to our other lively neighbours from Paris; and
Macbeth, (at half price), to all friends from the North.
Of course, the list might be º lengthened; and were
Punch sovereign despot he would lengthen it; as He is not, he must
make the most of the “farewell,” and array himself in his best for
Wednesday next, to do farewell honour to MACREADY, and—no, we will
not despair—for a while to SHAKSPEARE.
A File to smooth Asperities.

LONDON WITH A CLEAN FRONT ON.
UR good city of London is deter-
mined to deck itself out for the
forthcoming Exhibition in its
very best. Every street is either
whitewashing its face, or rub-
bing up its dingy complexion
with a fine layer of Roman
cement. Houses that have not
shown a bit of colour for years,
are coming out “as fresh as
paint.” Every little bit of or.
nament is being put on for the
occasion. No expense has been
Spared in making brass-plates
look, brighter than ever, or in
touching up area-railings that
were turning rusty from long
neglect, or in hanging some
little article of verti or decora.
tion about the balcony that
hangs gracefully in front of the
loºse, as if suspended, like a
châtelaine, from its waist. The
London balconies this year pro-
mise to vie in luxuriance and
splendour with the hanging
gardens of Babylon. Every
mansion, like, a beauty at a
grand ball, will exhibit a mon-
ster bouquet before it.
The shops are not in the least
behind the houses. The altera-
tions that are going on in all
directions promise a beautiful
harvest to the bricklayers and
carpenters. Every shopkeeper
seems to have said to #;
=: “Now is the time to beautif
my shop, or never!” A.
accordingly, he has set to work
with his cheque-book in one
hand, and Nash's Designs for
Mansions in the other. If his
shop-front ran up merely to the first floor before, he has given directions to have carried it now to the second
floor; and he would carry, the ceiling right into the garrets, if the alteration did not involve the
necessity of taking another house for the purpose of eating, drinking, and sleeping in. As it is, we imagine
that half of the shopmen in London must sleep in hammocks slung across the shops, or else in the
drawers of the kitchen-dresser; for when two-thirds of a house are thrown out of window to enlarge the
shop, it is very clear that there can be very little room left for the bedrooms. But such is the peculiarity
of the age we live in—not one-half of London knows how the other half sleeps! - - -
Of course, it is the firm belief of every shopkeeper, that the increase of his business this year will
more than repay the expenses of his mighty alterations. -
After all, i. alterations will make London look very gay and clean, as well it may, when every house,
every shop, is coming out expressly for the occasion with a new front. We trust that nothing in the
shape of extortions or dirty impositions will be practised upon the poor foreigners inside, so as to soil
the purity of the dwellings outside. -
But the question arises, since private individuals are exerting themselves, so much to put a clean
face and a decent look upon London, what is Government doing towards the fulfilment of the same
object?. We are afraid it is neglecting, amidst the excitement of divisions and the mortification of
minorities, its proper share of the work. -
Will it do anything to improve the looks of the National Gallery : -
Will it complete in time #. Lions and the alto-relievos of the Nelson Pillar? .
Will it remove, before the arrival of our visitors, that intolerable nuisance, Smithfield Market?
Willit allow Westminster Bridge to remain as it is -
Could it not interest itself in having the railings removed, and the entire area of St. Paul's Churchyard
thrown open before the First of May? -
Will it see that the Marble Arch is completed by the same period? .
The same with the British Museum? -
Will it take any measures that St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey shall be thrown open to
foreigners without any fee of twopence or fourpence? - -
Will it exert itself in the least, in carrying out any of the above |. for if not, we are
afraid that the clean front which London has put on for this grand holiday occasion, will be smeared
y two or three large spots of dirt, flung upon it by the careless hands of Government. We know the
answer will be that just at present Ministers have quite enough to do to keep themselves clean, without
troubling themselves about anything else; but, in the oft-quoted words of a celebrated Irishman, we can
only say then that “It’s a dirthy shame!”

VOL. XX. K
“MORE POLITICAL CAPITAL.”
TALKING of “Political Capital,”—
and though there is a great talk about
it, we see very little of it—poor Louis
Napoleon has been endeavouring to
raise a trifle, but the French Chamber
has refused to accept his bill, which
we think was very shabby. The con-
sequence is, that Louis has been com-
pelled to sell twenty of his horses.
How the “Char de l’Etat” is to get on
without a horse to draw it, we cannot
tell !—and especially without any
money to grease its wheels. But, the
people have promised to put their
shoulders to the Common-wheel, and
to help it along for him with a pullout
of their own pockets. This, however,
Louis, NAPOLEON will not listen to—
he will not accept any “Political
Capital” raised by any such means.
The Frenchmen, meanwhile, unaccus-
tomed to anything like denial, where
money is concerned, from their rulers,
are wonder-struck, and stand aghast
with their bank-notes fluttering aloft
in their hands. We must say we are
very much in the same position, (with-
out the bank-notes, however,) and find
it difficult to unravel this confusion of
“Political Capital.” What between
Louis NApoleoN asking for an ad-
vance of “Capital” which the Cham-
ber will not grant—and the people
making a gratuitous advance of
“Capital,” which Louis. NAPOLEON
will not accept—we are driven to this
conclusion: That if France, under its
President, does not make great ad-
wances, it is not so much the fault of
the pation, as of its illiberal Govern-
ment.
The Ministerial Budget.
WE always knew there was a serious
differencebetween the Ex-CHANCELLOR
OF THE Exchequer and some of his
colleagues on the subject of the Budget.
n arecent conversation with a member
of the Cabinet, the Ex-CHANCELLOR of
THE Exchequer observed consolingly,
“Never mind, the Budget will turn
out very well after all.” “Yes,” was
the reply, “I’m only afraid it will turn
out too well—but a turn out just now
is not exactly what we, as a Govern-
ment, desire.”
The POPE IN ENGLAND.
WE understand that Pope, the
Kensington carrier, who has hitherto
carried everything before him—and
seldom left anything behind him—has
written to Lord John Russell, to
inquire whether the Government mea-
sure against the assumption of eccle-
siastical titles in this country will
render it necessary for him (Pope) to
drop his nominal Papacy, which he
has exercised without molestation for
nearly fifty years.
Woodman Spare that Surplus.
CoNTRASTING, the good intentions |
with the financial incapacity of the
late CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchE-
QUER, there is, perhaps, some reason
for the name recently bestowed upon
him of SIR CHARLEs Wood—if he-
could.

LABOUR AND THE RICH.
(From our Special Correspondent.)
PARLIAMENT—ITS LABOUR AND ITS LABOURERS.
He last letter exhibited a
specimen of the hale and
hearty old Parliamentary
labourer, whom habit, that
second nature, has so
broken in to his work, that
he scarcely feels the fatigue
of an eight hours' night's
labour, and rather endures
than enjoys the idleness of
his brief holidays. But
with the poor young man
to whom I was next intro-
duced, the case was very
different. When I called
on him, at his morning em-
ployment, (for the poor
creature had to labour both
* night and day,) he was
seated at his desk. The
languor of his attitude, the
paleness of his cheek, and
the slight aureole which fatigue, and ceaseless work had traced P
round the hollow of his eyes, which looked dull and fishy, (if I may
be allowed the expression,) all showed the exhaustion ºf an over.
tasked frame. He appeared to me hardly to have strength to
support the newspaper which he held in his hand, or energy to under-
stand its contents. He was polite, though cold in his manner, and the
exertion of speaking was evidently almost too much for him; but he
grºw more animated as he spoke of his sufferings and hardships.
“I º he said, in answer to my question, “it must be about
two o'clock... I seldom know exactly what o'clock it is. What's the
use of knowing what’s o'clock, when one’s always cooped up at this
sort of thing? I’m working in the red-tape line, now. That’s my
day work. icame to it at twelve this morning. Perhaps I may get
away at four-I don't always; sometimes it may º earlier. It depends
on what there is to do. Yes, reading the newspaper is part of my
work, I shouldn't say it was the hardest part. ** off House-
work last night at one. I don’t call that a very hard night's work.
I went on at five. I'm tired when I go to the House. Of course, I
can't stay away. I should get ‘ear-wigged” if I did. The whipper-in
wºuld be after me. The long hours are too much for me. I sometimes
fall asleep in the House. I should say I fall asleep most nights. I don't
think the yarn-spinning the hardest work. I think taking in the yarns
is harder work than spinning 'em. My work’s what they call ‘dividing.’
It's carried on in a place called the Lobby. I don't think people knows
half the cruelty that goes on in that Lobby: you’re whipped in, no
matter how tired you are, or how hungry. Bless you! º, been
called away from my meals, or my little bit of bacca, over and over
again. They ring a bell, and you must come, and set to work, whether
you know what you’re a-dividing on or not. Of course there’s mistakes
sometimes.
... . 'I don’t know where I suffer most. Ifeel tired-like all over, and as
if I must go to sleep. Some nights it’s worse than others. It all
depends on the spinner whose yarns you’ve got to take in. There are
some of the spinners very hard on us. There's OLD Joey, that you were
talking to last night—he's reckoned a very hard customer; then there's
Deadly-LiveLY," as we call him—he's aterrible chap; you'd think he’d
never stop. Then there’s him we calls ‘Dizzy,'—he turns of his yarns
at such a pace. He's a stunner, he is. Do I often get a night's holi-
day? Very few, while the House is in work. Before I went to the
House-work I was fond of amusing myself, like other young fellows.
Oh yes! I went to balls a good deal, and to the Opera. I don’t go to
the Opera now-no, not ten times in a season; nor I haven't been to a
ball, I don't know when, except on a Saturday night, or a Wednesday.
“‘I worked in the new shop, last session, a few mights. Idon't like it
so well as the old shop, on the whole. There’s not cover enough in it.
The Speaker can see you everywhere. Qne can't cut a fellow's yarn
short, in this new shop, as we can in the old one, nor sleep so comfort-
able. But you can’t hear in it; that’s a comfort. I earn pretty
good wages while ‘the Governor' can keep things going. Of course,
if there's a turn out, I turn out with the rest, and my wages must stop.
I haven't saved any money. I never did save any. I can't afford it.
I suppose something will turn º: if we’re forced to stop work. My
friends are very kind to me. T ey’ll get me something tº do, Idare
say-something in the red-tape business. I’m a pretty good hand at it.
It don't take long to learn, but there's a deal of sitting in it, that you
must get used to, or it’s very tiring. There’s too many of usin it.
It’s not so good a business as it was—not half, I’m told. The wages
have come down, and you must do more work. It’s little better than
downright “sweating' in some of the red-tape shops.
“‘There’s the Treasury; they’ve got a very hard overlooker there.
He’s considered one of the sharpest chaps going to keep the hands to
their work, and cutting down their wages. Of course I wouldn't t
to get taken on there, if I could do anything better. I’ve been tol
there wasn't such an eye kept on a fellow in the old times, that the
hours were shorter, and the wages better, and nobody never asked no
questions. There’s an old hand here told me so. He thinks the red-
tape trade’s going to blazes. Them's his words. Ifancy people don’t
use so much red-tape as they did. It’s gone a good deal out of fashion,
like shoe-buckles. I don’t think I could turn my hand to anything else,
now, if I tried. I’d rather do nothing, of course.’
“We are glad to state that our statement of the case of honest
OLD Joey, last week, has elicited various strong expressions of sympathy,
and that we have received many presents for the worthy veteran.
Among others, ‘Dorcas’ transmits for him a warm knitted night-cap;
“Dulcibella, a packet of ‘Stol BERG's lozenges; while “A Friend to
Persevering Industry’ sends a copy of ‘Enfield's Speaker. They shall
be faithfully º to the worthy º of the senders’ sympathies.”
PUNCH*S POPISH RELICS.
WE have a turn for archaeology, and sometimes amuse ourselves with
an old barrow, when we h n to tumble over one. Having lately had
occasion to resort to our cellar—which we do very frequently—we fell
upon a stone; and having conveyed it to the light, we found it to com-
rise a piece of sculpture, worthy of the antiquarian relics to be found
in Stonecutter's Yard, and other old civic spots of venerable interest.
The subject of the sculpture is a very curious design, which, like
most of the curious designs of the present day, smacks of Popery. It
represents a Bull, not unlike some of those found, and supposed to have
been worshipped, at Nineveh; but in this country we are not such
ninnies as to pay respect to anything so contemptible. The Bull has a
triple crown; but, though aping an attitude of confidence almost amount-
ing to defiance, he has got the British Lion so completely down upon him,
that the idea of his making a successful stand is by no means likely to
be realised. It is a curious fact, that this old Papal design should have
been brought to light through the medium of the Punch Office, where
such matters are held at their proper value. We, in accordance with
our duty, take the first opportunity of exposing the design, and holding
it up to the public º with our customary good-humour.

JUMPING FOR REVENUE.
WoRDsworth’s beautiful poem of Hart-Leap Well has celebrated
the extraordinary leap of a stag; the chamois is famous for its daring
bounds; the squirrel can spring some distance; the kangaroo a long
way; the sum considerably...The grasshopper and the flea perform
prodigies of hopping. The British sportsman, riding a steeple-chase,
will “take” almost anything under a steeple. What have we not seen
Harlequin and Clown go over and under? But from no precipice, over
no gulf, between no two trees, across no plain, through no space, over
no hurdle, fence, or five-barred gate, through no fanlight or shop-
window, on no field, arena, or stage, did ever mortal witness such a
wonderful jump as was exhibited the other evening in the House of
Commons. Let the world-Ireland inclusive—match, if it can, the
following instance of jumping to a conclusion:-
“But, after all, I have come to the conclusion, that, under all circumstances, the fairest
and justest mode is that of placing one uniform rate upon all descriptions of income.”
The “fairest and justest mode,” alluded to, is that of raising the
Income-tax. The jumper is the right honourable baronet who held
the public purse-strings. But what a jump! Over what “switchers”
of unfairness—what “raspers” of cruelty—what “bullfinchers” of
extortion—what gulfs, what mountains of injustice! The seventy-
times-seven-l ed boots, in which such a feat was performed, ought
to be sent to the Great Exhibition. Well! Queen Elizabeth had
her dancing Chancellor, and, verily, QUEEN Victoria has had her jump-
ing Chancellor of the Exchequer; but SIR CHARLEs Wood beat SIR
CHRistoph ER HATTox.
However, if the pailings of justice and morality are to be jumped
over in levying the Income-tax, be it so. If we have thrown away
equity, and are to be as dishonest as we §: .# good; and let us
see how far we also can jump in evading Schedule D.
THE LIBEL DODGE.
2CAPITAL opening to persons de-
sirous of earning a dishonest
penny is afforded by the Law
of Libel.
For proof of this assertion,
the sceptic who may not be-
lieve Punch’s word, is referred
to the Times of Thursday last,
wherein he will find it fully
substan by a leader,
which is a considerable libel in
itself, tending, as it does, to
bring into extreme contempt
the numerous and distin-
guished persons who are re-
sponsible for the maintenance,
in its present state, of the law
in question.
oreover, the greater the
truth, the greater the libel;

HURRAH FOR AUSTRIA!
Now that the Sclavonian and Italian provinces of Austria have joined
the German Confederation, sauerkraut may be said to have taken root
over the greater portion of Europe: and the friends of the cause of order
in this country may have reason to rejoice in their assault on LORD
PALMERStoN last year. After all, what is there so wholesome, so much
needed for Europe just now, as quiet P and is not this the best way of
securing it?
For instance, suppose it is found necessary to ſlog some refractory
MADAME DE MADERSBAcH on the Danube, a regiment from Coburg
may be sent to do the business, and the Austrians be employed else-
where. Suppose the Emperor (GoD save him () wants to shut up a
Newspaper Office at Vienna, he may march a Milanese detachment
into the city who will perform the job. Suppose, the Holy Father is
uneasy, and from fear of his own subjects, a Lutheran garrison, from
Berlin may maintain order in his capital, and a High Dutch-asthetic-
mystific-Prussian force accompany the religious processions, and keep
guard in Saint Peter's. -
Suppose—for such things are possible still—suppose, in spite of the
aternal government of the KING OF Naries:(Heaven bless his
Majesty and reward him!)—another rebellion were to break out in his
country—like that, we will say, in Hesse the other day? The tran-
quillity of Naples is necessary for the tranquillity of the Roman States,
and of the Austrian possessions in Italy; the Austrian possessions in
Italy form part of the great German Confederation. Forwards, Hanover
and Brunswick! We march you into Naples to mount guard over the
Italian rebels IN CHAINS AND solitary IMPRISONMENT FOR LIFE,
and to back up the spies of CARRETTo.
And we have done this—or helped to do it—and chuckled over our

es, and we have seen the noble Hungarian sink, without a hand to
help him; we have seen the Hessians, with the best cause, the honestest
cause, the cause of every lover of peace and law, handed over to Bava-
rian courts martial—and never said a word: we have seen twenty
thousand men rotting in Neapolitan dungeons, and we read that forty
thousand Austrians are on the Sardinian frontier, because the Emperor
is disquieted by the encouragement given to liberalism in Savoy.
A BREAK DOWN.
O how unselfish we English are how generous, gallant, and wise!
How we trounce a Minister who meddles with other folks' affairs,
because as long as we are happy and easy, what matter what tortures
what tyranny, what misery and shame our neighbour may undergo?
Let us get over a Neapolitan gentleman, manacled and put into solitary
confinement for life on the word of a spy: let us have one over, in a
glass box, and put him in the Crystal Exhibition. Histortures will be
profitable to us; it will be amusing to see the lonely wretch caught in
the trap, and served right.

“Not allowed to be Drunk on the Premises."
No Spirits (with the exception, perhaps, of a glass of Cherry Brandy)
—no Wine (excepting, probably, a taste of Antimonial)—no Beer
(saving, always, the harmless Ginger), are to be served in the Great
Exhibition. After a long day's journey through its many streets of
counters, we can imagine a thirsty countryman rushing up to the
refreshment stall, and being told that they cannot possibly let him
have anything to drink stronger than a glass of water. How disap-
pointed, how enraged he will be and we can imagine his looking round
the Crystal Palace and giving vent to the following philippic: “Dong it !
I must say the building is beautiful enough, but I tell you Ishould have
admired your Glass a precious sight more, if one could have had a drop
of summut in it!”
The Ministerial Crisis.
AMONG the rumours current during the days of the Ministerial Crisis,
there was a large mixture of fiction and fact, but we saw no announce-
ment of Mr. Punch having been sent for to Buckingham Palace. He,
however, with his usual loyalty, presented himself at Court—by standi
in the court-yard—expecting to be “called in" for the purpose o
kissing hands upon the receipt of some important *ś but
feeling himself doomed to {...} ointment, he was satisfied with kissing
hands to one of the Royal Children, who happened to be at one of the
windows of the newly erected nursery.

A DELICATE CASE,
In a Let/er from MR. MUFF to M.R. PUNCH.
“DEAR P., -
. . “IN the midst of the agitation occasioned by the resignation
of Ministers, the affairs of the heart can find little interest, perhaps;
and yet, dear P., what does a Cabinet Minister matter to me in com-
parison to domestic bliss: and how would an Income-tax more or less,
or a Popish aggression or so, aggravate me and terranize over me
equal to a wife? I have been for some weeks an ingayged mann. f
am of age, and an Aberdasher in a quiet line of business, in Lambeth,
left to self, Ma, and sisters, by Pa.. I met Miss EMILY P-TTs at a
dancing acaddamy, which I danced with her several times: and had
the honour of excorting her and her sister home to their Ma's apart-
ments in the neighbourhood of K-mm-ngton Ov-l.
“Me and SAM TH-MPs-N, a friend of mine, used gennly to be the
partners of Miss A. and Miss E. P-TTs at the acaddamy, and walk home
with them after the ball. Miss A. fell to TH-MPs-N, Miss E. fell to me.
our many walks and conversations, º and scentiment, LALLA
Rook, ByRoºſ, ELIZA Cook—every think refined and intalectial, in a
word, came from Miss EMILY P-TTs, which her Christian name there is
no need to disguise, it . the same as that of the victim of the
fascinating Steerforth (which she always called me STEERFORTH) in
MR. DICKENs's most admirable novel.
“At that dancing Astabblishment, in those moonlike walks, no being
could appear more charming than EMILY P-TTs. Her form is that
of the Nymth; her air dark auburn, and curling naturally; her woice
like, the cooing of the ring-dove, which SAM TH-MPs—N (he is an
air-dresser, and has a great phansy for pidgings and things,) keeps in
shop. In fact, “I wandered by my EMILY's side, and wooed her for
my blushing bride”—as, I told her in the Valentine which I sent, the
14th of this very month, Febyouary, having courted her for four-
teen days.
“My Ma and sisters keep house for me, I am jest 21 years of age
managing the business for the family; and, after I had pledged
myself to Miss P-, which she had it in my hand-writing, and
no mistake—I did not like, for a few days, to break the news to Ma,
whose temper is what I should call uppish, and who won't like
to have a person put over her at a table where she have sate and pre-
cided so ſong in my pore Pa's time. At last, however, last Friday, I
told her, and there arose an exceeding unplesnt row. Ma and
sisters all cried. Ma asked how I could go for to º myself, bein
Ş. a boy (though I am of age these six months, and SAM says, wit
the use of his Mycasser, my whiskers will very soon grow quite large)—
how I could engage myself with a gurl whom I'd met at a sixpenny Op,
and whom I knew nothink of? I told her that Love is Love; that ever
since the wurld begann, mann was the slave of woman; that if I didn’t
marry my EMILY, I felt I should peridge in an untimely grave: and that
she was just as bad about me. So being the Head of the family, Mar
had nothink for it but to conscent to my whishes, which was for imme-
diate marridge. She kist my sisters all round—said what must be must;
and, putting on her bonnit, said she would go with me and see her
hter.
... This was not tº to my liking. I have forgot to tell you that I
didn't much like MRs. P-TT's, EMILY's Mamma, nor her big brother,
(which he is an horse-rider at a sircus and a bullying feller, always
borroring money of me, and gettin tipsy and swearing, and thretnin
he’d have my life if he thought my intentions towards EMILY was not
honorable;) and MRs. P-TT's lodgings was not kep as meat as they
might be, and she’s a bigg large woman with a black wigg and very odd
20aºs and I can’t help thinking that she is fond of drink too.
*Well, Ma and me goes to see MRs. P., and I couldn't help seeing
by Ma's face that she didn't like my EMILY's family at all. They’d jest
been having their dinner at 1 o'clock. There was a pewter pot, and a
bottle of º: on the table, and the cloth wasn’t very nice—neither
was MRs. P.'s gownd, which she looked as if she wore it in bed; whereas
re Ma is always as neat as a pinn, and they’d been having Hirish
tew, and Ma don’t like that neither—and EMILY scolded me for
bringing MRs. MUFF (which is our name) without giving warning
before hand.
“‘O, BOB,’ says Mar, going away and crying her eyes out. “How
can you expect that young woman can make you happy?. Her horrid
mother was, I'm afraid, tipsy; she herself is ten years older than you.’
“‘Law, Ma, I said, “she's only twenty-two;' but Ma said EMILY
was 30 if she was a day. “Your sisters can never live with her and
that dreadful brother of hers.’ And Ma took on and wouldn't be con-
soled, do the best I could; and again and again asked how after six
walks home (which I had but six, and that is true) with Miss P-, I
could give up my Mar and sisters for sush a creature, Mar called her.
... “Then when I went back to EMILY she gave it me too. Her voice
aint’so sweet when she scolds, as it is when she’s walking by moonlight,
nor she don’t look so well by daylight as she do at the demy in her
musling dress; and I see she is a good bit older than me; but she has
my promise: and there's that big brother (the beast) and the other
brother, who is in the Attorney’s office, which I hate him almost worse
than I do the big one—and I’ve given my word, and what can I do?
“Now, dear Mr. P., I read in the paper to-day, that aparty who was
engaged to another party for a fortnight, and who have broke off his
engagement, have been judged to pay the º eight hundred pound.
I don’t mean that our cases is in the least like; but what am I to do in
my case, and how much should I have to pay, º: I broke off with
EMILY P-TTsº, I did pop the question on rather a short, acquaint:
ance. I do think none of us will be happy if we marry. I do think, if
I feel this, and say so honestly to a gal, it ought to be a reason, and a
good reason, why we shouldn't be tied together for hever. I do, think
that the lor, which makes a matter of barging and money of this, has
somethink immodest in it, somehow. I do think that a jury, sitting on
a girl's feelings, and assessing the walue of them (where there has been
no harm done, and nothing but honorable courtship,) ain’t right; and
that the Law which forses a party to * a party the other party don't
like, is stoopid and wrong—and–and–I know I wish I hadn't been at
that Dancing Academy: and am your obedient servant,
“Robert MUFF.”

is died.”
NEW PANORAMA.
MR. PUNCH having perceived the success which has attended the
numerous Panoramas exhibited in London during the last season,
determined, with his usual liberality, to place an entirely new and very
comprehensive one before his countless readers. The Panorama of the
Over-land Route to India was amongst the most favoured, and Mr. Punch
does not see why a Panorama of the Over-sea Route to America should
not be equally appreciated. So far from its requiring three miles of
canvas for its representation, it will be found, to º but three
inches of paper, and will yet be found to exhibit all that is worth
seeing over a distance of 2,000 miles. Here it is:-

THE WOODEN BUDGET.
To the Ex-CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER.
MY DEAR SIR CHARLEs,
How easily you might have abolished the duty on paper, if you would
only have imposed a rather larger amount of tax upon printing-presses!
Only think with what facility you might have done away with the
malt-tax, by transferring it, slightly increased, to brewing utensils.
Just by taxing coals to an extent rather greater than would make up
to the revenue #. the deficiency, consider what very little difficulty
you would have found in taking off the tax upon tea.
Why, now, you might have got rid of the Customs and Excise alto-
§: and more than saved the expense of collection, by substituting
or them a judiciously augmented shop and warehouse duty.
. If you would have modelled your budget on the principle of these
simp ... oh what a deal of satisfaction and content you would
have given the country! . Much such content and satisfaction as you
gave it, by proposing to shift the window-tax to houses, and to charge a
ouse-tax on humble dwellings that never have had a window-tax to pay.
But, my dear SIR CHARLEs, if you could distribute the window-tax so
as to compel small houses and their poor occupants to partake of the
burden, it really was absurd to say that you could not adjust the income-
tax in such a manner as to make property bear a fair share of it in
. to earnings. . See what a mess you have got yourself and
colleagues into by your financial tricks. Believe me,
33&IºC#.
Your humble Servant and suffering Wictim,
P. S. Did you ever hear of Dead Sea apples? They are very like the
fruits of your fiscal ingenuity.

RELIGION FOR SERVANTS,
It would appear that there are two qualities of religion, as of almost
every other article; and there is a particular sort supplied, in some of
the metropolitan parishes, to the domestics whose souls are considered
worthy of salvation, through the medium of “sittings.” . There was a
discussion, in the Marylebºne vestry, not long ago, about the amount
of accommodation in the churches, when the following formed part of
the proceedings, as we found them reported in the Observer:-
“SIR PETER LAURIE rose to call the attention of the vestry to a return he held in his
hand, relative to the number of sittings vacant, and the amount of applicants for
sittings, in the respective churches of the parish. From this return it appeared that
there were 921 vacant sittings in the various parochial churches and chapels—namely,
in the parish church (the rectory), 145 vacant sittings, and 16 applications; in St.
Mary's, 50 vacant sittings, and 18 applications; in All Souls, 61 vacant sittings, and
22 applications; in Christ Church, 485 vacant sittings, and 1 application (laughter); in
Trinity, 149 vacant sittings, and 17 applications; in the parish chapel, 7 vacant sittings,
and 4 applications; and in St. John's Wood Chapel, 111 vacant sittings, and 4 appli-
cations. This he (SIR PETER LAURIE) thought clearly proved Ma. STEPHENs's state-
ment of the previous week to be wholly incorrect (Hear, hear).
“The Rev. Mr. Guaney said it would appear that SIR PETER LAURIE was trying to
make the vestry believe the churches were empty. Now, so far from that being the
case with regard to St. Mary's Church, the only seats that were empty were those in
the servants' gallery, and so distant from the pulpit that the minister could not be
heard or seen. He would, however, venture to observe, that in two months hence,
when the families returned to town, his church would be filled to overflowing, even in
the servants' galleries, and every other part.”
We find, from the above explanation, that servants are considered to be
suitably supplied with religious instruction, if they are furnished with
places where “theminister can neither beheardnor seen.” This is leaving
much to the imagination, and, perhaps, it is believed by the authorities
that, as distance sometimes lends emchantment to a view, the servants
of a congregation may be more enchanted the further they are removed
from the clergyman. The admission made at the vestry meeting is, cer-
tainly, one of the coolest and boldest we ever remember to have met
with; namely, that the appropriate º for domestics in a church are
those seats where they can see and hear nothing.
We should have thought the more educated classes might better have
been entrusted with the task of filling up, from their own imaginations,
the blanks in the service, or the sermon, at a place of worship; but we
find it is quite otherwise, for the servants are those whose senses it
is not thought worth while to appeal to, by placing them near enough
to enable them to know what the clergyman is talking about. When,
however, “the families come to town,” the unfortunate flunkies must
turn out of the galleries, where nothing is audible or visible, and, if
they go to church at all, their religious instruction must be laid on for
them into the lobbies and passages or porticoes of the churches, while
their “superiors” are receiving the article in a more direct fashion.
If the servants are expected to profit at all by a sermon, and are only
provided with places in which nothing can be heard, we presume that
some mesmeric influence is calculated upon for bringing to their senses
the words that their ears are not permitted the apprehension of.
THE COMPLAINTS OF THIN-SKINNED PEOPLE.
By a Pupil of ERasmus Wilson.
Of all complaints, none are so difficult to treat, as those of thin-
skinned people. There is no classifying them; and the worst is, the
i. inned such unhappy creatures are, the more difficult it is to
treat their complaints. Medicine has but little to do with the cure.
Gentleness, patience, and a spirit of forbearance, accompanied with a
mildness of remonstrance, are the only remedies known to have any
effect whatever.
These complaints assume a thousand eccentric shapes, that frequently
baffle, the experienced eye of Science. A medical man never can be
sufficiently prepared for them, and should always look upon the various
Nº. perplexing as they may be, with the greatest pity....He
should listen with an air of the most profound interest, and if he
cannot effect any good, still he may evince a feeling of sympathy, which
my go a long way in removing the imaginary complaint...
say imaginary, for, after all the complaints of thin-skinned people
are mostly imaginary. Herein lies the great difficulty of knowing how
to remove them. As it is absurdly impossible to discover in most
instances what has been the origin of the complaint, so it becomes a
matter of extremely hazardous risk to understand what particular
remedies to apply to it, and great care is requisite in many aggravated
cases before you determine on what you should say, or what you should
do, for fear of making the complaint worse. The most efficacious
method of treatment is to say nothing at all. Leave the patient to
himself. Let him be as peevish, and snarl, and rave as much as he
pleases, he will soon get better, when he finds out that no notice is
taken of him.
The conduct of a thin-skinned person, when his complaints are very
loud and frequent, is exceedingly curious, and anything but pleasant.
First of all, do what you will, there is no pleasing him. The very first
word that is capable of two meanings he will take offence at. In such
a mood I have known him quarrel with his dearest friend, and nothing
has been able to convince him he was in the wrong. If he has a rela:
tion in humble trade, he is perpetually fancying that everyone is making
allusions to the circumstance º to insult him. If by any acci-
dent some distant member of his family has been guilty of an indis-
cretion, which has rendered necessary his removal beyond the seas,
then historments are endless. The slightest touch, upon any º:
bearing ever, so remotely upon the Old Bailey, sends him into a of
the greatest fever. He will colour, cough, roll about in his chair, get
red in the face, and the chances are that he does not fly into the greatest
passion, and commit himself by spluttering out insults to the persons
who never meant anything insulting to him. Explanation in such a
case becomes hopeless. #, malady is of that sensitive degree that the
more you endeavour to persuade him you did not mean to offend him,
the more he becomes convinced that such was your intention. The only
remedy is to leave him to himself, and to send a friend to relieve his
mind the next morning—that is to say, if you think the case worth it.
For my own part, my practice invariably is to let thin-skinned persons
undertake the management and cure of their own complaints; for, treat
them as kindly as you will, I have uniformly found that you receive
nothing but hard words and no pay, much less thanks.
Protectionist Dialogue.
“I should like to see the Whigs without a leg to stand upon,” said
one of the farmers' friends to Disraeli,...“I can't exactly say that my
wishes go to that length,” exclaimed the Ministerin (non) posse; “I don't
desire to see them without aleg to standon, for Iwant them towalk out.”
THE Pope's Advocate.
MR. Roebuck, is a gentleman of great forensic abilities; so great,
that he seems to have been entrusted with the Pope's brief.

and among others a Cab.
Cab Driver. How º this—'tis quite a luxury!
First time this month since down this street I’ve driven;
Yet there’s some good in blocking up a street;
It sends one round, and round, and round, and round,
Making the fare a thing ad libiţum.
I’ve often taken up at Fetter Lane,
To drive to Ludgate Hill—which by the crow
Is scarcely half a mile—but, thank the Sewers,
It’s just as often two, or sometimes three;
For I have driven round, and round about,
Through all the City's ambiguities,
he Lane of Fetter and the Hill of Snow,
With all the tortuous sinuosities—
But hold!—this language ill becomes my station.
When on the stand, none would suspect my rank:
No matter—fate impels—and I drive on. [Erit CAB DRIVER,

[The Workmen set to work, and, in a short £. large chasms are
opened in all directions. During their labours, the daily traffic of
vehicles has set in, and at length an enormous crowd of carriages
and carts of every description may be seen brought to a dead
stand-still.
Omnibus Driver. Now, then, you Coaley—just pull up a bit.
Coal Waggoner. Pull up a bit of what—or how—or where?
If I go on, I’m into yonder gig. . .
If I go back, I smash that cab to bits.
If I pull off a bit, I’m down those steps.
If to the near I go a foot or two,
I’m through that large plate-glass.

Can't you go on?

So, to the wharf we’ll leisurely return.
Gentleman in Cab. My friend goes off by rail by five o'clock;
So just turn back, and drive me home agaln.

burst out into the magnificent chorus of “Come if you dare;”
the various Coachmen go off into “Britons Strike Home; ” and
the curtain falls.
REPORT OF THE INSANITARY COMMISSIONERS.
UNCH and Toby having been
appointed to inquire into
the state of Insanity in
England, this is the Report
we beg to make upon the
prolific subject:-
We are at a loss to say
if Insanity is on the increase
in England or not. How-
ever, we will let facts speak
| Pº for themselves.
* We have found the same
number of evening-parties
going on, at which twice as
many people have been in-
vited as the rooms would
hold. . The consequences
have been a system of
crowding and crushing, in
the midst of which anything
like dancing was entirely
out of the question. Then
we witnessed a crowd of old
ladies scrambling into the
º as if they were
at the last point of starva-
tion. Then we have seen
young ladies almost fainting with fatigue still continuing to dance
up to a very, late hour. But the most extraordinary thing of all

portion of the company, before retiring, go up to the hostess, and
thank her, in the most solemn manner, for “the very pleasant evening
they have passed.” - -
e. have thought it our duty, in the prosecution of our painful
inquiries, to accept several invitations, to fashionable dinner-parties,
which have lasted, on an average, from three to four hours, terminating
at an hour when rational people generally go to bed.
. From the above facts, it will be seen that our countrymen are not much
improved in their fashionable habits. We are bound to admit—which
we do without a word of comment—that they *: the same bad hours
as ever, and that the mad practice of turning night into the day is not
in the least altered for the better.
The practice of making long speeches in Parliament continues with
unabated force, and the newspapers, curiously enough, continue to
§ them, though we must say that we have met with but few
individuals insane enough to read them,--which pleasing fact speaks
largely, we think, for the growing intelligence of the country.
* Smithfield Market is not yet removed, nor does there seem much
chance, of it—for we have encountered herds of City people who, far
from thinking the market a nuisance, maintain, most seriously, that it
is a great boon and ornament to the Metropolis, in the midst of whose
Pº ation (nearly 2,000,000) it has the good fortune to be situate."
he gentlemen, we regret to say, still wear the unwieldy, uncom-
fortable kind of thing which they persist in calling “a hat.” This
obstinate habit convinces us, as much as anything, that there is some-
thing very wrong about the heads of our countrymen.
The ladies’ dresses are as long as ever; which, however useless and
extravagant, is connected with one good advantage, and that is, from
the effective way in which they sweep the streets, they leave the
crossing-sweepers far behind them. -
To conclude:—Whether England can boast of an increase or decrease
of Insanity, it would be extremely difficult to determine; nor would it,
do we think, at the present moment, when there has been such a
quantity of excitement about the Papal Question, be exactly fair to judge.

WE see by the advertisements of the Art-

to subscribers this year is “The Burial of

have been such a number of years intent upon

| rejoiced to discover that they have succeeded,
after so many wearisome trials, in finding it at
last!, Our rejoicings are all the more boisterous
on this happy occasion, as we perceive from
the above source, that not only is the body of
HAROLD actually found, but that some artist
more venturesome than the rest, has proceeded
so far as his “Burial.” -
| This progress in the Arts is most cheering;
but, let us hope, now that the body of HAROLI,
has been found, and that it has been fairly
buried, that artists will allow him a few years'
rest, and busy themselves in digging up some
fresher subject. Might we recommend to the

the Grenadiers, you know, who was at Cambridge, has been as bump;
tious all the week, talking about impacts, and resolutions of forces, and
lines of pressure and thrusts, and catenaries, and things, and proving to
all the fellows in the billiard-room from 10 p.m. till 2 a.m. regular,
that all the galleries must come down, and all the girders go to
immortal smash with the first rush. I heard him talking about it the
other day on Howell, AND JAMEs's steps, to old LADY SQUABASH, who
turns eighteen stone, till I thought the venerable dowager, would
have sunk into the arms of her own JEAMEs, who was waiting to give
her a hoist into the brougham. -

there’s any reason for their funk or not, we’re told that the galleries
and all are going to be tried. Of course, I’ve no objection to that.
But how do you think, old fellow, they talk of trying them : ... .
“They say, they’re going to have all our fellows up from Chichester
and Windsor, as well as the Tower, and the St. George's, Portman
Street, and Regent's Park barracks, and march, the, three regiments—
every man jack of 'em—slap through the blessed building, galleries, and
all, with a battalion practising the goose-step at a time—to try the
effect of the vibration, SPARKs says.
“Now, I say, the building may be weak, but isn’t this rather too
strong? Of course the men have taken the shilling, and they can do
what they like with them. I can't see what right they have to send us.
The sergeants could put the men through their facings, just as well as
we can—and take the whole kit of us (officers I mean), in the three
regiments, and we don’t weigh anything to speak of. -
“Besides, if they really want to try the strength of the building, why
don’t they send the Life Guards, or the Blues; or, better still, why
don't they have up a few regiments of Heavies from the provinces?
That would be something like a trial, and, if anything happened, the
Plungers would not be missed in the season. But just think what
one could only find it out. But other
Almacks', and the Balls, and Pratt's, and the Matinées dansantes, and
the Casino, and the C. C. C., and Epsom, and Ascot, and the Opera,
and the Ballet, would do without us.
“If such a thing is in contemplation, I’ve no doubt it’s a dodge of
those Manchester snobs, with CoRDEN and BRIGHT at their head, to
get rid of us at one fell swoop.
“The Commissioners had much better set a lot of them working
their infernal Manchester spinning jennies in the gallery instead.

FROM THE OWN CORRESPONDENT OF THE
MONITEUR DES BOULEWARDS.
London, 28th February.
onsieu R THE EDITOR.
“I have not yet de-
livered, my letters of in-
troduction," or done more
than arrive in the brumous
capital, of Albion, after a
brief though stormy pas-
sage across the Channel.
My sufferings were severe.
They are over. I am now
lodged in my hotel in the
neighbourhood of L-st—r
Squar, the centre of the
fogs, the fashion, the com-
merge of this city.
The proprietor of this
hotel (an intelligent com-
atriot) informs me that
ttle interest has been felt
in the late ministerial per-
Pºiº and changes. This
shall see quickly for my-
self. For the present I have
but the day's journal be-
fore me—reflex of daily
opinion—and I read there-
in matter sufficient, indeed,
for many a day's thought.
Intimately acquainted with
the English language and history, the contents of these journals is not a
mystery to me—I give my views and shall transmit you other letters, of
time in time.
“A singular process, illustrative of English manners and life, appears
before me in the journal which is laid upon my table. , You may not,
rhaps, have heard of an English writer of merit, M. DISRAELI.
is first novel, called the Curiosities of Literature, he made proofs of
esprit: his Letters of Junius, published subsequently, were sufficiently
picquantes, and caused their publisher, WQODEALL, more than one pro-
secution: his Life ºf Wivian Grey, was a bleeding satire upon the cele-
brated. Whig Earl, head of the powerful family the members of which
have, for 20 years, governed this country.
“The Whigs, since that satire, have vowed to him an undying detes-
tation. Lay your heel upon one member of the English aristocracy,
and the whole body writhes and turns, encircles you with its enormous
folds, and crushes its poisoned victims.
“Having quarrelled with the Whigs and PEEL, that transfuge to
their camp, |. the literrator, suddenly appears as the man
politic. . He enters the Chamber of Commons. He attaches himself to
the party opposed, to the Whigs., He defies the huge aristocratic
dragon, lancing at the sweltering and venomous monster the shafts of his
sarcasm, and piercing his scales with the brilliant glaive of his wit.
PEEL, the champion of the oligarchy, falls under his blows—DIsrAELI,
like PEEL a man of the people, like PEEL rises to the command of a
great aristocratical party in the state; he is unanimously elected as
member for the Bucks, and leads them in their battle against their
Whig enemy.
“What arrives? ... The aristocracy of England never pardons—it
resorts to assassination rather than forgets. The death of Disraeli
was resolved upon, and very nearly put into execution but a few
days past.
“Would you know, how? By a stratagem brutal yet deadly. An
infernal machine was invented by English treachery to destroy #. first
Consul: an omnibus is employed to crush DiskAELI. -
“Being in his brougham traversing the streets of London, an omnibus,
waiting its opportunity, dashed into the vehicle of the illustrious author,
burst the armoriated panels, of his light carriage, and cast him to
the ground. - -
“The name of the proprietor of this omnibus was NELson. Does not
this sº the attack and the mystery?
“A NELson does not retreat before armed force, brutal violence, and
murderous stratagem.
... It was a NElson who bombarded the peaceful city of Copenhagen.
“It was a NELSON who struck, like an assassin and incendiary, amidst
the midnight flotilla of Boulogne; whence he was flung §: by the
strong arm of our braves. It was a NELson who would have destroyed
the member for the Bucks.
... SIR DISRAELI, escaping by a miracle, carried his plaint before the
tribunals of the first instance. And in this country of England, where
ſºs
**t
everything judges itself by .# where the chastity of the spouse, the
#. of the º: pays itself at so much; what do you think, what
Oes #. think, was the fine imposed upon the agent of NElson, the
bravo of the box, who, in fault of a dagger, would have driven the pole
of an omnibus and two horses into the dauntless bosom of the Member
for the Bucks,
“SIR BINGHAM, the magistrate at the Court of Marlborough,
(remark, Marlborough l—another name full of fatal recollections to
France, another name suggesting blood, retribution, yengeance!) sate
º Statue of outraged Themis, and, delivered the astonishing
Verdict.
“SIR BINGHAM fined SIR STANTON, the driver of the omnibus,
SIXPENCE.
“—For the º: murder of a poet, SixPENCE
“—For the assault on a statesman, SixpenCE |
*—For the assassination of genius, SIXPENCE"
“Do you know what it is, sixpence in this. City of London? The
drive in an omnibus (without correspondences) is sixpence. The waiter
at the taverne where...you eat the bleeding beef, grumbles, at the
gratuity of sixpence. The maid at the hotel, who makes your chamber,
scornfully flings you back sixpence—it is not enough for her service;
it is not enough for the smoothing of a bed, for the passing of a bassi
noire for the i. hot water. The very pint of hafanaf costs sixpence;
the beggar in the street expects sixpence; and the life of the greatest
man in England is rated at the value of a chopine of ale, of a drive in
an omnibus, of a waiter's fee, or a beggar's gratuity | Note, that this
is true; that this is patent; that I read this in the º journals in
the nineteenth century, in superb England, that, builds fºe. of
crystal, and pretends to dominate the civilisation of the world!
“SIR DISRAELI's menaced life is valued at sixpence then; but his
broken coach pººl is rated at-how much think you—£810s.-at 212
francs 50 centimes!. -
ife, 65 centimes l—a coach panel, 212 francs 50 centimes —
Oh, Albion' - -
“Yes; but the coach panel is armoriated: the coach panel has a
blazon. It is an insult to attack a blazon in England; it costs 65
centimes to attempt a murder. -
“To attempt to assassinate an unpopular statesman is the same cost
to you as a cigar.
“Enough for the present regarding MONSIEUR DISRAELI. I grieve to
find that another leader of the Chamber of Commons, LoRD JoHN
. has met with a still more melancholy fate, and has suc-
Cumbed.
“Flying from the odium which his administration had caused in this
country, it appears that SIR RUSSELI, took shelter in Ireland, which,
as you know is now, joined to England by the vast Menai Tunnel.
º, iºnal of to day, the 28th, received from Ireland, announce
S 1ate.
“A Limerick paper states, that, ‘On Monday, last, immense
crowds paraded the streets of the town of Ennis, with blazing tar-
barrels borne on rafts, and bearing...in the centre LoRD JoHN
RussBLL, wearing, a hideous mask. The yells, and shouts of the
crowd were terrific, and after traversing the town—not forgetti
to visit Bindon Street, where the Judges of Assize were lodging—the crow
returned opposite the Qld Court House, and there committed LoRD
John to the flames, amidst vociferous execrations, and repeated cheers
for CARDINAL WIsey AN. . No stones were thrown or disrespect offered to
the Protestant Church, which they passed twice.”
“The Ex-PREMIER , seems to have escaped, however, from the
roasting at Ennis; and }. fled in disguise from that beautiful
city: for we find, by the Tipperary. Free Press, that he was at Clonmel
the next day, most ludicrously attired, carried on the back of a brawny
fellow, a number of men following and belabouring him with huge
wattles. They conveyed him through several streets, and, at length,
having suspended him from a lamp-post, it was set on fire, amidst the
groans of those assembled. .
“Is not this an awful picture—a º nobleman ludicrously
attired—carried before the courts where the judges of the land were
sitting, belaboured with wattles and º and burned a la lanterne?
O LEDRU Rollin' you said well that this country was hastening to
dissolution, and was to pay a speedy penalty for historic crimes!, The
indignant people rise in their wrath, upon the minister who has desig-
nated their beloyed rites as superstitious, carry him to the doors of the
Protestant temple which they respect, dress him in ludicrous disguises,
and slay him in the public place! . . -
“Were these facts not narrated in a newspaper, I should hesitate to
believe them. ... But they are in print, and cause neither denial, nor sur-
prise, nor indignation... The shops are not closed; the tocsin is not
sounding; the phlegmatic people are not in arms, but move with restless
egoism on the affairs of their commerce. I feel that I am about to gaze

was constantly un-
der the windows,
and up and down
the areas of Down-
ing Street, during
the past week, for
the purpose of
catching the drop-
pings from the offi:
cial eaves, and
collecting all the
official kitchen-
stuff that was to
be obtained from
tº the º de-
partment of the
= Government.
- One of the first
ºr incidents that
I seemed to show
= the
s = of the return of
– the late Ministry
to power was the
appearance of , a
small truck at the
door of the CHAN-
CELLOR • OF THE
ExchEQUER's offi-
cial residence. The
truck remained empty for about, half-an-hour, when a wash-hand-
stand, which we ascertained to be the private property of SIR.CHARLES
Wood was thrown into it; and from the removal of this stand
we inferred that all hopes had subsided of his being able to continue
his stand in Downing Street. Shortly afterwards a pair of slippers and
a boot-jack were placed in the truck; and we at once surmised, from
these arrangements, that SIR CHARLEs, intended walking away while
his shoes were good—or, at all events, while he thought them so.
Our observations at the back door of the Foreign Office, were
rewarded by an interview, pregnant with political meaning, between
the Porter and the Pot-boy; for the emphatic words, “no more beer
wanted after to-day,” were sufficient to let us into the secret that there
was a break up in that quarter. Bearing round to the kitchen windows
of the Colonial Office, we were fortunate enough to catch the milkman
in the act of taking back one “ha’porth' out of the usuul “pen'orth.”
# ; ; and we had the privilege of overhearing the following
alogue :-
%. Only half the quantity of milk! ...Why; what’s up now?
Servant. What’s up—why, it’s all up for the present. We shall only
want a ha'porth till we know whether the new minister takes any tea
here. That’s all I know about it. - . .
We immediately drew from this, the obvious conclusion, that the
ordinary domestic arrangements in Downing Street were thrown out,
which could only have arisen from the throwing out of the Government.
How far our suspicions were justified, will have been seen by the result,
and we only regret that our inability to be in two places at once--a
regret many office-hunters will share with us–prevented us from having
a #. od sneak, about the areas and railings of the Protectionists,
which would have brought us regularly within the pale of all the
principal political intelligence.

LAst week, while HER MAJESTY was sending right and left for the
heads of parties to get a Government, it is strange that the Royal sum:
mons was not directed to SIR CHARLEs Wood; for it is allowed on all
hands —by foes as well as friends—that there is no one so capable of
knocking up a Cabinet.

THE UMBRELLA AT THE PALACE.
QN a certain day last week was seen an umbrella lounging against a
certain, door opening to a certain back-staircase. In ordinary times, an
umbrella in such a place and position might have lounged unnoticed:
but there are, political and social occasions in which an unassumin
British umbrella is invested with a powerful significance, akin to tha
which clothes and elevate the royal, umbrella of the Emperor of
Morocco. It seemed tolerably certain that the umbrella was the
H. of some individual sent for. Whose could it be? Certain
eholders gave their different thoughts upon the matter.
The umbrella was manifestly of cotton—could it be Manchester
cotton? Was the article the chattel of R—CH-D C–B–EN ? Occa-
sion and place gave warranty to the supposition. For R–CH-D, if
not the originator—or, so to speak, the discoverer–of the principles
that make cheap bread; thereby making the great national prosperity
which the Royal Speech, as with a silver trumpet, sounded—if not the
inventor of the principle, R.—CH-D must be acknowledged (nay, there
have been some 70,000 minted witnesses to the fact,) the triumphant
general who carried such principles into the fight, and won the hard battle
with them. Corn from #. corn from the vallies of America, may inter-
twine upon the brow of the general of Manchester; and, therefore, it is
almost conclusive that the aforesaid cotton umbrella is the umbrella of
B–EN “sent for.” And for this well-known, national reason. We
are a people singularly addicted to patronise and reward the man whose
genius has first patronised and rewarded society. We care nothing for
a man's register of birth—heed nothing whose names it carries as the
begetters of the man of ability—we ask not what is his escutcheon, or
whether he has one or not, treating heraldic griffins and cockatrices as
of no part of the man soever—but only considering his works as his
best quarterings; and so, believing that it is the habit of England so to
believe in and reward the real man, with never a thought of his tree
genealogical—why, then, there can be no doubt soever that this cotton
umbrella here significantly left at the Palace-door, is the property of
R—CH-D C–B–EN, “sent for **
The umbrella, albeit of cotton, was certainly not the umbrella
belonging to C–B–EN., Not at all his sort of umbrella. It was
evidently too big—of too large a compass. An umbrella that expanded
in a pelting shower, was wide enough at once to cover the b rim of
a Quaker, and the shadowing (blighting) scarlet of a Cardinal. The
umbrella—any odds would be given upon such belief–the umbrella was
the property of J–HN BR-HT., For why, although one of the Friends,
why should not he be “sent for?”
No doubt of it, the umbrella is cotton—but not of the Manchester
manufacture, certainly not. That web was spun on the other side of
the Tweed; and is, moreover, of so strong a sort, that it has defied any
thickness of Scotch mist. The umbrella can belong, to nobody, if not
to J-s–PH H-ME. An admirable family umbrella adapted econo-
mically to do double duty—a thing, at once an umbrella and a parasol.
The handle is no doubt a Scotch pebble; or, if not Scotch pebble, a
bit of buck Scotch-horn, Beneath this, umbrella J-s—PH has for
nearly half-a-century stood safe from the Treasury beams; º even in
showers of manna—as they were wont to fall in the good times—
J–s—PH has kept himself perfectly dry. by means of this
umbrella J–s—PH would encamp the British army, cutting it down to
dimensions that even one umbrella should cover. Were it permitted
to open an umbrella leaning at a Palace door, then would be seen ribs
of iron—old iron; but still true as steel. Well, it is something to live
for: § know that a man may work for fifty years, and at last be
sent for.”
Well, how any man, with what he thinks to be eyes in his head, can
take that for a cotton umbrella? Why, is it not plain? The umbrella
is made up of Persian; flimsy Persian; and—who can doubt it?—is the
Fº of “hurried. B–N4–1N D—R—II, in hot haste sent for.
ook at the article. Expand it—there can be no gainsaying it—it is
shabby, and full of rents; it has, in its day, been used in so many
adverse modes; now striking the Marylebone hustings in the cause of
Reform, and now exposed as a scarecrow in an English corn-field. And
here and there it is patched with bits of foreign silk of every colour, and
the handle called a Scotch pebble; why, look again—is it not a bit of
Minories mosaic? Therefore is it a real Bucks' umbrella; and, there-
fore, !. all question, is the fact, that at last D–R—LI has been
-- Sen. or.”
And after this various fashion did divers people view and review the
umbrella at the Palace door. We merely give their contending specu-
lations. Whose umbrella—at the time we write—is really there, is more
than even Punch, knows; although he has a hankering opinion that it
ought to be no other than his own. |

THE BRITISH BANKER, ABROAD.
THE new passport system is a most significant, and 'withal, a most
honourable dºñº of England. An English traveller moves
upon his banker, as his watch, to be worth anything, moves upon a
diamond. The price of the foreign passport—still to be had, whilst we
write, of PALMERSTON AND º to the small sum of 7s.6d.
Three half-crowns fit the wanderer with a document that saves him
time and trouble on his way, rejoicing; and haply obtains of the
small folks in foreign office some additional momentary respect—some
transient smile or rudiment of a bow to the bearer. But of the
thousands of carpet-bagged Britons, who cross the sea, how, few in
proportion, are there worthy of the glorification of a Foreign Minister's
passport; albeit the three half-crowns may peep from between, the
ready thumb and finger of the traveller, yearning to pay! For there
are three provisos, one of which must be achieved, ere the document
can be exchanged for the aforesaid seven-and-sixpence. Three pro-
vises: namely—
f's The incipient traveller must be known to the Foreign Secretary
of State.
II. The would-be traveller, not knowing the Secretary, must get at
him through an acquaintance; otherwise, by knowing somebody who
knows him.
III. The prepared traveller, not knowing the Foreign Secretary of
State, and, further, being on so low a round of the social ladder, that—
miserable, depressed man l—he even knows, not any fellow-biped
acquainted with the Minister; why, still there is hope for him ;-if he
can be recommended as a fit, decent, and proper person to cross the
seas, by “an eminent banker.” - -
Having no banker, the man has no being; that is, as being is inter-
preted and understood at the Foreign Office. And this is a very proper
definition of a nothing, a nobody, a nullus homo. And it is, moreover,
decent and wise that the English traveller should have his condition
translated in the polyglot of our Foreign Secretary; that the bearer's
passport should surround him with a halo of importance, as reflected
either from a personal acquaintance with the Foreign Minister—or from
an acquaintance with his acquaintance—or, what is possibly as
bright a glory, if even not a brighter aureole—from the cash account,
held by an eminent English banker. Under either of these aspects,
the traveller is an interesting biped, awakening divers speculations
in the bosoms of douaniers and in the disinterested brain-pans of land-
lords and waiters. The Foreign Office passport is known to be in the
|. of that very gentlemanly traveller; and one of these results
ecomes the metaphysical property of certain people, as they believe,
concerned in the inquiry:
“Our Traveller knows Lord PALMERSTON. Haply goes to his
parties; any way he is acquainted with his Lordship. If not.—
“Our traveller is hand-and-glove with i. who knows LORD
PALMERston so well that the traveller's friend, %. all passport pur-
poses, need not know him at all. Or—
“Our Traveller has been recommended to the distinguished consi-
deration of the Foreign Office, by an eminent banker; who, no doubt
takes care of the cash of that most interesting individual, newly crossed
the seas, and with the odour of London coal yet fresh upon him.”
And the traveller, as he ought to do, vindicates abroad the human
dignity that we insist upon at home; the dignity of human nature; for
an Englishman can hardly be said to walk upright, considering the stars,
who have no balance. Indeed, he can hardly be allowed a human con-
sideration and position. There are, we know, hundreds of thousands
of sign-post likenesses of men, who, having no banker, “eminent’’ or
otherwise, do notwithstanding pay their taxes; but, after all, they are
but dumb dogs; for although they are compelled to pay—they have no
voice. In fact, your true Briton—like your true sovereign piece—is
only made at the Mint.
So preach Britons of one another; and so to all the nations—through
its passports—shouts the Foreign Office.
THE JARGON OF GENTILITY NOT NEW.
YoUNG ladies—and other persons of that kind—entertain a notion
that the language of our ancient law is rugged, harsh, rough, uncouth :
the reverse of everything that is genteel and refined. They know not
how closely its phraseology resembles the labial delicacies, the tip-
tongue prettinesses of speech and elegant levities of style, resulting
from the admixture of foreign with native expressions in the language
revalent in Belgravia, and thereabouts. Take, for instance, the fol-
owing quotation—made in the House of Lords the other evening by
the EARL of ST. GERMANs—from MooRE's Reports:–
“33 Elizabeth.-En le case d'un Manu que fui sue en le court Christian pour le
marier d'un de ses wives' sisters' daughters, et prohibition fuit agard (awarded) quia tel
mariage n'est prohibite per le Levitical ley.”
It will be seen that the dialect of the old courts is even more subli-
mated in its gentility than that of the modern drawing-rooms: being
actually based on the Zephyrine tongue of France, and only garnished,
or, more tastily to speak, ballasted, with the strong Saxon. hereas,
in the salons, however recherché may be the discourse, the Saxon pre:
dominates, and the language of compliment, la cuisine, and la danse,
occupies only a secondary place in the hodge-podge.
MR. PUNCH'S POEM ON THE POLITICAL CRISIS.
SINCE HUMPTY, DUMPTY, whose immortal smash
A king's whole power could not repair at all,
Eyes have not witnessed such an awkward smash
To remedy, as LORD JoHN’s recent fall.
And what a task our gracious
Trying to mend a shattered
hy, 'twas enough to drive a Sovereign mad,
Whose crown had on a common head been set.
Suppose you had to join a broken dish,
ith no cement at hand but gum or glue
Wanting Poo-loo, Oh! would you not cry * Pish "
And “Poo!”—or worse than “Poo!”—without the loo?
UEEN has had,
abinet !
Such botheration as yourself might feel,
About your fractured platter or tureen,
Has been experienced—more, perhaps, a deal—
During this plaguy crisis, by the QUEEN.
And yet, how many subjects of the realm—
How many liegemen—honest, wise, and true,
There are, who might be found to guide the helm,
And work the vessel, like a first-rate crew.
To satisfy the nation is the job!
Well; you might do it in an easy way:
Construct your budget so as not to rob
Income of more than it should fairly pay.
Take off, without reserve, the tax on light;
urther reduction, if you fear to try,
Extend the franchise—there you’ll sure be right—
And see about retrenchment by-and-by.
The tax on bread pretend not to restore,
In fact, you’d not be able, if you wished;
Protection's shout is but an empty roar—
DISRAELI knows, himself, the cause is dished.
As to the Pope, in England put him down—
Down, mind—don't play with him at fast and loose;
Let Ireland be ; however sad to own,
The fact is, PADDY’s Popery’s gone goose.
This is the programme for the “Coming Man,”
Forthcoming who does not appear to be,
But will be, if, approving of his plan,
HER MAJESTY will only send for me.
A LATE LAMENTED PARTY.
THE newspapers report a meeting of the County of Cambridge, which
was convened the other day, at Ely, for the º of considering what
could be done for Agriculture, in reference to her present embarrassed
circumstances. Unfortunately the assembly failed to suggest anything
that could be done, except the community at large, which it propose
to do out of a tax on }. A sensible recommendation, however, was
delivered to the farmers by MR. BALL, of Burwell—though, perhaps,
that gentleman did not intend his advice to be understood exactly as
Mr. Punch understands it. He declared, that,
“In answer to the threat of Sir JAMEs GRAHAM, the Agriculturists ought to wave
aloft the banner of Protection, inscribed with the motto “Resurgam.’”
Yes: Resurgam would be a good motto for the Protectionist
banner. So would Mors Janua Witas, or In medio vitae morte sumus,
or In Caelo Quies; or any other, inscription borrowed from , a
hatchment. The great fact expressed by all such legends is that the
party is defunct.
The Unacknowledged Cabinet.
“WY d'yer call this here Crisis a Hinterregnum ?” an individual
belonging to the inferior classes of wags was heard to demand. “With
LoRD STANLEY, and LoRp John Russell, and SIR JAMES GRAHAM,
continually drivin' backards and forrads, ain’t there a cabbin' it goin on

HE moment the ministerial crisis was known to exist, we chartered
a cab for our own reporter, who was instructed to gallop as fast as he
could after everything and everybody that seemed likely to afford a
clue to the movements of the ex- or embryo ministers. The following
sketch of the proceedings of the past week, will take its place among the
most important of our annals; and the future MACAULAY will find his
account in consulting our account, when he sits down to write the
history of the Great Crisis. -
FRIDAY-LORD John RussELL, on leaving the House of Commons,
“had an audience” of the cheers which greeted the announcement of
the majority against the Government. On his arrival at home, he
lamented to his private secretary, over his misfortune, and seemed to
be struggling to resign himself.

Saturday-Loup John Russell, having this morning disconnected
the Seals of Office from his watch-chain, proceeded to Buckingham Palace
to lay them at the feet of HER MAJESTY.
While LoRD JoHN RUSSELL was selecting his umbrella from the
#. hat-stand, the bell was rung, for pen and ink, with which HER
AJESTY immediately wrote to LoRD STANLEY. LoRD JoHN havin
let himself out, a special messenger was despatched—who run H.;
out of breath, making the bystanders wonder what was in the wind—to
LoRD STANLEY's residence.

During the afternoon, LoRD PALMERSTON, hearing that he was .
to lose some of his dearest “diplomatic” relations, proceeded to ca
on somebody to inquire after them.
MR, DISRAELI, on hearing of the Ministerial crisis, immediately
waited upon Fortune, but was not favoured with an interview.
The CHANCELLOR of The Exchequer was in a state of much
anxiety during the
day; and at about
three o'clock, his
official residence
presented a very | .
moving scene, for
several articles of
furniture were con-
veyed to his private
abode. The budget
was thrown into a
silkhandkerchief, to
be conveyed by his
own hand; but it
was found to be so
carelessly put toge-
ther, that it could
not be carried.

gentleman, wholly regardless of expense,"proceeded by the handsomest
of hansom cabs, to the residence of LORD STANLEY.
The interview was of the briefest description, for after a few inquiries
MR. GLADSTONE refused for one moment to take a seat in the library,
or in the Cabinet of LORD STANLEY.
Such was the confusion of the ministerial movements and º:
promenades, that everybody went to call upon everybody. The hall

nocking and ringing at doors continued throughout the whole day,
nothing seemed to answer.

• THURSDAY.-In the course of the afternoon the EARL of ABERDEEN
was sent for to the Palace, where he remained till past midnight.
What was the result of his Lordship's advice is of course not known,
but we have reason to believe that an illustrious personage was much
inclined to sleep upon it.
During the whole of the day, MR. DISRAELI was understood to
be so particularly engaged, that, with the exception of Lord
STANLEY, he could see nobody. So important were MR. DisRAELI's
interviews with himself during the Ministerial Crisis, that it appears
"|to have had the effect of shutting him up in the most extraordinary
manner.
Rumours were afloat early in the day that Mr. Punch had been “sent
for.” The funds jumped about in the most buoyant manner as these
rumours began to be credited, but we have authority to state that Mr.
Punch, however willing to serve and assist his royal mistress, considers
that his present, honourable office (85. Fleet Street), is the only one he
has º to fill with due regard to the happiness and welfare of his
country.
FRIDAY.-MR. GLADSTONE waited upon LoRD ABERDEEN, and it was
generally understood that everybody declined having anything to do
with everybody also; and, accordingly, orders were sent to the washer-
sº of the late Ministers to send their things as usual to Downing
reet.
A Hint for the Quacks.
WHY is it that the advertising doctors will catch hold of our legs
when they º as profitably seize us by the ears, or have a pu
at our noses P hy is it always a bad leg of so many years standing,
that is promised a cure by the advertising practitioners? Surely this
“bad leg” has had a pretty good run; and all the old hands must
be so familiar with the leg, that something else ought to be set on foot
as soon as possible. What would the world say to “a bad sneeze of
five years standing,” or “nose and eyes of twenty years running;"
either of which would be a change at all events, from the leg which
must have tired itself out by this time, almost as completely as it has
tired the public. -
A PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION.
SIBThorp says, “The present House of Commons may be divided
into two classes: Cotton-spinners and Yarn-spinners; and he doesn't
know which is worse.”

PUNCH AND THE WEGETARIANS,
EveRYBody knows that Punch never laughs at a really good thing,
except, perhaps, at a good joke—if it should change not to be his own—a
condition which very rarely happens. We have laughed once or twice
at the Vegetarians, who stand ridicule with so much good º that ºn
quizzing them seems to #. them in spirits; and, as they are precluded
by their rules from anything exhilarating, in the way of drink, we dare
say they find a threepenny."go” of Punch a most agreeable substitute.
Of course, if their principle is the true one, there will be no laughing
it down; but if º a little ridicule will be wholesome in a
double sense; for it will afford them the excitement of a laugh, while -
it cures them of their folly. -
The Vegetarians profess to see a close connection between the
kitchen-garden, and morality, as well as a near relationship between
the orchard and the intellect. They profess the belief that the mind
flourishes on mashed potatoes, and that we must look for true virtue
among cabbage-plants and beds of asparagus. . . .
We do not look upon any man as better than his º: because
his life may have been one º round of potatoes, beans, and
broccoli; nor do we believe that one whose mind is always in the cos-
termonger's cart, can attain to any very, high degree of intellectuals lſº
culture. The imagination that is bounded by Covent, Garden Market,
the fancy that plays about the greengrocer's sieve, the heart that is
true to the pottle, the affections that twine themselves round the rope
of onions, the sentiments that mix themselves with the salad, are
nothing in our º eyes; and we cannot, therefore, concede to
the Vegetarians the credit they claim for a grand union between the
market-garden and the moral and mental attributes. .
We have no doubt there are some excellent men living on green stuffs,
and we think they would be none the worse for a moderate indulgence
in a more generous diet. The Vegetarians seem to imagine that the
virtues are to be cultivated on garden produce; that a certain number
of potatoes will make a man a RALEIGH, and that a constant adherence
to cabbage will ultimately make a Bacon. We protest against the
whole system as an absurdity, but admit that we are open to cor-
rection; and we promise our vegetarian friends that when we can be
persuaded that their º is something better than mere gammon, we
will stick to spinach for a twelvemonth.
A NICE TIME OF IT IN ST. JAMESS.
If we desired to lay our hands upon a grievance, we should at once
º our hands on St. James's clock, which seemed to be without hands
when we looked at it last from the corner of Sackville Street. Musin
on its dismemberment, we had got into Jermyn Street, when we looke
up again to the other side of the clock, which did not exhibit a manual
deficiency. Not only was another face put on the matter, but there was
also a pair of hands, pointing to half-past ten as the time of day; when
happening to look up at one of the sides of this doubly double-face
clock, we observed that it seemed to be º hand in iº, for both
hands were at 12 precisely. Watching the clock for a few minutes, we
observed that the hands, thus united, never moved, and we came to the
£onclusion that the great parochial arbiter of the times was prevented,
by having its hands tied in some way, from doing its duty.
We have since been inundated with letters from the parishioners,
who complain that the clock is guilty of the grossest irregularities;
that its goings on are only to be equalled by its standings still, and that
it has completely given the go-bye to all who have been accustomed to
go by it. As to striking, the clock has become so eccentric, that its
movements ought to be watched very narrowly, for, every time it
strikes, it may be said to aim a blow at truth, inasmuch, as what it says,
cannot be relied upon. We understand that a paltry plan of economy has
been the cause of this horological outrage upon all the best interests of
business in the parish of St. James, and that the few shillings formerly
allowed for win * up the clock have been cut off by the financial
reform, party, in the vestry. The result is, that nobody is now res.
ponsible for the winding-up of the clock, which is thrown entirely on
its own hands, and, having no one to regulate its works, there is no
keeping its hands out of mischief.
THE Daily News, in a º article upon the Protectionist
Party, says, it is composed of nothing but “fops, fools, fanatics, and
ºxhunters.” The existence of such a party, then, composed of so many
ſº, must necessarily be very fiff femºral–From a Rºjected Contributor.
THE HIGH BAKER PARTY-The Protectionists in Parliament, who
I as a judicious housewife has observed—are trying to get up a ferment
tº make the bread rise—will be known to after ages as "The Members
who quarrelled with the Belly.”
THE MINISTER WITHOUT ARMS.
ANY years ago, a
GrandTurkcaused
his Vizier's arm to
be cutoff, and pro-
claimed that the
arm should be
thrown up, and
whoever caught it
falling should sug-
ceedinthe Vizier's
place; but upon
terms to be served
the same sauce at
ayear'send. When
the crowd was
# come together to
# catch the arm, one
man, more diligent
and dextrous than
the rest, caught it.
So he was Vizier;
and, at the year's
# end, his right arm
was cut off an
thrown up as be-
fore, and he him-
self, with his left
arm, caught it
again; and after
his second year, his left arm was cut off, and thrown up, and he caught
it with—his mouth, And for this parable—at the relatornames the story
—we are indebted to the .." experience of SIR. Roger North; a
parable narrated in Constantinople, now some nearly two hundred years
ago; in which time, the world, top-like, has had many spinnings, .
And yet, in 1851, Protectionist Minister STANLEY has the choice of
becoming Vizier of all England—but is to be Vizier without arms.
And Minister STANLEY refuses the hard conditions: it would be im-
possible for him to hold place without arms. Whereupon, Mufti Dis-
RAELIcomes forth; and declares that the embryo Viziernever refused office
upon such terms; and further the said Mufti, there and then, in Divan,
indicated that if even place were to be granted without arms, he-the
Mufti—was prepared to catch and hold on to office with his mouth.

THE REV. HUGH STOWELL ON PUNCH.
At the late rather considerable meeting, at Exeter, of persons who
object to the Church of the Inquisition, and are disinclined to allow
their country to be enslaved by its hierarchy, Mr. Punch had the honour
of being introduced by
The Rev. Hugh Stowelſ, who made an eloquent speech, warmly in
accordance with the national sense of the Pope’s paternal kindness in
giving us a new priesthood to govern us, and regulate our family
relations, and look after our spiritual affairs, and also take care of any
temporal property which hiſ be bequeathed in conformity with the
advice of the holy gentlemen who may “get the death-beds” of our
relations. In the course of his remarks, MR. Stowell, according to
the Morning Post, observed that
“It was most astounding, that men, calling themselves Liberals, should now be the
special apologists of the Papacy. (hº hear.) Why, they now had, in this country,
extremes meeting indeed. He had been shown, in a publication he did not often look
into, and which was noted for wit, a singular sketch—they had in Punch-ſa laugh)—
a representation in which Mr. Bºront, the impersonation of liberalism, was embracing
Da. Wisemas, the impersonation of despotism. (Laughter and cheers.)”
It was kind of the Rev. MR. Stowell, to make such handsome
mention of the name of Mr. Punch. MR. Stowell's confession that
Mr. Punch's publication was one which he did not often look into, was
made, Mr. Punch trusts, only as a pledge that the omissionshould cease.
Everybody, especially every public character, should read Punch.
Through the neglect of the perusal of Punch, or inattention to Punch's
warnings, political characters are betrayed into the courses that ºf
them to an ignominious end; and many a minister may date his fall
from the disregard of some article or paragraph, or large cut, or initial
letter in this periodical. The Pope would never have invaded us if he
had minded his Punch : nor would MR. BRIGHT have helped him in
that, attempt to trample on England, which will only, Mr. Punch sin-
cerely hopes, end in his putting his foot in it.
MIRACULogs INDUSTRY-Whilst Protestants, in the pride of their
superior intelligence laugh at the winking and bleeding pictures of
Continental credulity, it must not be forgotten that we have numerous
saints—some of them adored, too—in Belgravia, who have worked a
great many miracles—in Berlin wool.

In mart, or eke in mill;
And whether he go, or sit, or stand,
And whether his work be of brain or hand,
He beareth a burden still.
A loathlie thing doth clasp and cling
About his shoulders square;
It weights his back, till the bones they crack;
It clutches his throat, till the face is black;
It sticks like a burr, and it lies like a sack,

| RISING STATESMEN.
DURING the late Ministerial crisis, that is, on Tuesday, the 25th of February,
there is now no doubt whatever that the highest personage in the realm sent for
LQRD, STANLEY, at half-past ten o'clock in the morning. Clearly, he who would rise
to be the QUEEN’s minister must rise with the lark. Whether or no the couch of the
British Statesman is a bed of down or roses, it is quite clear that he must not be
tºo,fond of it, or he may happen, one fine morning, to be summoned to the councils
of his Sovereign before he is up, or, at least, before he has finished his breakfast.
IORD STANLEY, arrived at Buckingham Palace promptly at eleven o'clock, and was
discussing the State of affairs with the QUEEN for more than an hour. Whether he
had previously discussed his roll and bloater, we are not in a position to state; and
the question may be considered frivolous, if not impertinent. But it should be
considered that the experience of working on an empty stomach would afford a
good lesson to a politician who might be called upon by his party to increase the
price of food.
NEW WIEWS OF DIPLOMACY.
. It is a very generally received opinion that gammon is the basis of
diplomacy; but the fact is, that it is impossible to conduct international
negotiations on the foundation of that humble and economical fare,
even when rendered more palatable by the addition of spinach. The
New York Herald says, that MR. Rivers has written a letter to MR.
WEBSTER, complaining that the American Ambassadorship cannot be
done at Paris under £9000 a year, and adds that
“According to MR.PAKENHAM, good dinners are half the battle of diplomacy, and
the most favourable treaties are gained by liberal feeding.”
This aphorism suggest important reflections.
A main, point to be attended to in the formation of a diplomatic
corps is the commissariat; and the force. nust be well armed with
knives and forks, in addition to being supplied with plate armour.
The trenches in diplomatic warfare must be manned by regular
trenchermen.
Rivals in diplomacy must be cut out by actual carving; and in order
to dish them, recourse must be had to real dishes.
If one º wishes to turn the tables on another, it is requisite
that he and his suite should keep the better tables.
The politeness of diplomatic intercourse should be qualified, in some
measure, with sauce, and its gravity tempered with gravy.
Treating, in diplomacy, is best managed by giving “a spread.”
Bold diplomatists are those “who greatly daring, dine.”
. The most liberal foreign policy is that of giving grand banquets, and
is pursued by the †.º.
A plenipotentiary should have unlimited powers of cramming.
An ambassador has been defined to be, “a man sent abroad to lie for
the sake of the commonwealth; ” but the definition must be enlarged
*
MONSTER TESTIMONIALS.
“GeoRGE SLoANE, taken from life,” is, advertised as
having been added to MADAME Tussaud and Sons' exhibi:
tion of wax-works. Notwithstanding the iconoclast zeal
which has so º protested against the Chamber of
Horrors, it appears that there is still among the British
public a very numerous sect, inveterate in, the practice
of criminal image-worship. As everybody's."persuasion,”
whether true or false, is to be “respected,” our idolatrous
fellow-subjects, by way of some little #º to theirs,
might be gratified by the erection of public monuments
to some of the more distinguished objects of their veneration.
A few statues of eminent murderers and other atrocious
offenders might be ranged round the roof of Newgate, to
encourage their devotion, and serve as testimonials to a
class of remarkable persons whom so many of their country-
men delight to honour.
The Wood down in Lombard Street.
WHEN lovely Lombard Street is paved anew,
How still will be the scene; how sweet the viewſ
Beneath, the silent wood will be descried;
And many a golden bank on either side,
With richest notes where silvery change resounds,

104 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ORACLE OF SOMNAMBULISM,
NEw system of theology, and mental
and moral philosophy, is making some
|..." in the world, especially
among a portion of the superior
'classes, whose sense of pleasure is
'exhausted by enjoyment, and in whom
an enthusiastic temperament is com-
bined with a feeble understanding.
This species of revelation is derived
from #. mouths of soothsayers, who
are generally either nervous an
epileptic youths, or females afflicted
with hysteria. The state of inspira-
tion is induced on the seer by the
processes of what is termed mesmer-
ism; that is, by concentrating the
gaze, or operating, by a sort of sham-
pooing without contact, on the indi-
vidual, till sleep is produced, in which
state that person begins to talk.
The discourse of the sleeper is in
most cases manifestly incoherent and
nonsensical; but, sometimes, it takes
a more connected form, and relates
to scenes in the other world, or re-
mote objects in this, which the pro-
phet, if not shamming, may be pre-
sumed to be dreaming about. These
oracular trances are diversified, occa-
sionally, by convulsions, and par-
oxysms of grief or violence.
uring their more tranquil mo-
ments, the entranced afford informa-
tion concerning another life, and the
constitution of the mind. Useful
knowledge respecting the latter point
is obtained by touching the head in
this or that place, when the subject of the experiment indicates, by
speech or gesture, the faculty seated in the corresponding part of the
brain, which is supposed to be excited by the finger's end, through the
skull. For instance, when the part phrenologically called Self-esteem is
touched, the somnambulist struts; when the finger is placed on Vene:
ration, kneels down, or prays; or when it is, put upon Wit, laughs and
giggles, or, perhaps, in states of uncommon lucidity, quotes Punch.
Different phrenological manifestations, however, are obtained by
different mesmerisers, and the same may be said of theological doctrines.
There are conflicting denominations in the religion of fits. The hyste-
rical faith, according to some of its preachers, declares the present
existence final, and teaches that there is no essential difference between
Mr. Punch, and his dog, Toby. According to others, that Punch is
immortal; but that whether he has destroyed his wife and child, and
killed the constable, the beadle, the churchwarden, the overseer, and
jack Kitch; or whether he has devoted himself all his life to promote
the welfare of Society, will make little difference to the felicity of
Mr. Punch.
The revelation of these vast, but contradictory wonders, is stated to
be accompanied by the power of seeing, not only through stone walls
and into closed piº. but also into the middle of next week, and
farther; also of reading by the crown of the head, pit of the stomach,
and soles of the feet,
The doctors of the epileptic Church complain grievously that their
miracles are received with incredulity; which they might easily remove,
by performing one of them—say, causing a patient to read Punch with
the crown, or the heels, satisfactorily—in the College of Surgeons. Till
this is done, the convulsionary doctrines will probably not find any
disciples Fº of a homoeopathic particle of common sense, albeit
supported by certain persons who have too well deserved respect and
esteem, that, their names should be mentioned in connection with
absurdity and “bosh.” Persons wishing for information on mysterious
subjects—unless they know of a better authority whence to seek it—
should apply to Mr. Punch.
FRIENDS: OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE.
THE Times states that at the late Election of a Lord Rector of
Glasgow University, two “nations” voted for LoRD PALMERston. It
is not probable that those two nations were Austria and Russia,
Go! NAUGHTY MAN.—THE CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER (SIR
Q. WooD) has been much blamed for his unwillingness to take off
the Window:Tax, and he now has the satisfaction of feeling that he
has been obliged to take himself off instead.
THE YEAR OF EXPECTATIONS.
THE present year, 1851, seems to be The Year of Expectations.
Every one is expecting something ! -
Every lodging-house-keeper is expecting to let her lodgings at three,
and four, and five times the ordinary rent
Every house-agent is fondling the same beautiful expectations. We
have heard of a sanguine agent who actually expects to let the grand
house, at Albert Gate, opposite MR. HUDsoN’s. What he expects to
get for it, we should be afraid to mention!
Every little hotel and coffee-house-keeper expects to have his house
filled from top to bottom, and is forming most absurd expectations as
to the prices he shall get for beds, fitted up in sculleries, garrets, and
dust-bins ! -
Every theatrical manager expects to have “Crowded Audiences
“Overflowing Houses,” not merely in the play-bills, but positively
inside the theatre every might!
Every proprietor of a Panorama, Diorama, Cosmorama, Cyclorama,
and every other rama, expects to be able to retire next year with the
enormous receipts of this season's Exhibition! -
Every shopkeeper is madly expecting to sell off every bit of his stock
this year, and expects if he does not make his fortune, that it will be
entirely the fault of not having sufficient goods to supply the demands
of his innumerable customers!
Every young lady is expecting to be brought up to town, for
“Pa’s been promising it ever so long, and he can't refuse now, for
there never will be such an opportunity for seeing London as this
present year !”
Every wife expects, of course, the same.
Every country yokel expects to come up to Lunnun this year, and
expects to find our dirty streets paved with the traditionary paving-
stones of gold, and to see the QUEEN riding about all day in a carriage
and six, with the crown on her head, and the sceptre in one hand, and
the ball in the other.
Every bigotted Englishman, belonging to the fine old JoHN BULL
school, of tº...". Englishmen, expects to see every foreigner with
long moustachios, long beard, and long hair, and dirty habits, similar
to the class of Frenchmen he has been in the habit of meeting in
Leicester Square, and expects that London will be troubled with
nothing less than the Plague in consequence.
It would be difficult, and perhaps very tedious, to put down all the
expectations that have been raised, like so many cucumbers, under the
glass-frame of the Great Exhibition, more especially the expectations of
all those who ExPECT THIS YEAR. To MAKE THEIR ForTunes. We
can only say, that amongst so many expectations, more or less fragile,
that it will be a very great wonder if a few of them are not broken.
And that is the only expectation, we venture to form on the subject,
and about the only one we expect to see fully realised this year!

COCKS AND HENS FROM EGYPT.
WHAT will Colonel SIBTHoRP, FARMER CHowLER, aye, even the
}; OF RICHMOND, say to the subjoined, extracted from the Morning
Ost r—
“The hens of Egypt now lay eggs, for the Londoners. Thirteen casks were lately
landed at Southampton from Alexandria.”
Thus, our real, indomitable English game-cock is to be duly out-
crowed by the cock of Egypt! Once upon a time, the KING or Spain

cocks have a national reputation at stake—ought he, as a Protectionist
and a proprietor of English game birds—to allow of such a corruption
9f the breed of English hens, as these Egyptian eggs must inevitably
bring into our farm-yards, and to the very i. of our British barns?
One fact, touching these Egyptian eggs, may show what we may
expect. MR. CoBDEN, with a contempt of the maternal instinct,
worthy, of a free-trader, last season set-degraded, we should say—
hºnest English hens, upon Egyptian eggs. And what is the consequence?
Why, the hens, neglectſul of motherly yearnings will only lay their eggs
in an oven (to be hatched by wood and coals)—whilst the cocks, instead
of strutting, dalcemente feroce—as the poet says—and crowing English
cock-a-doodle-doos—do nothing but perch upon outhouses, forminarets,
and at morn and evening crow—“Allah Bismillah / Allah / Allah?”

BRUNSWICK IN A BALLOON.
THE Ex-Duke of BRHNswick has gone—or, wind permitting, will go—to Ger.
many in the Nassau Balloon. A natural yearning, it may be, takes back His
Roy AL HIGHNEss. The Ex of BRUNswick to Fatherland.
It was about midnight, on the 7th of September, 1830, that DUKE CHARLEs, or
Ex-Duke, turned his back on Brunswick and his Dukedom, his onward way
brightened—made very clear—by his blazing castle, fired by rebellious democracy
that would not have 5500 lbs. of gunpowder deposited in a church in the heart §
the city, such powder awaiting further consideration of His Royal Highness. For
QHARLEs of BRUNswick, with no popular love to .. when he set out, early in
the year, for France—not being ungrudgingly worshipped as the juvenile father
of his §: but some days before, returned from Paris, smirched and smoked
from the Barricades. . It would seem that he was instantly resolved to show to
chastised Brunswick how he—CHARLEs of that ilk—would have enacted the larger
part had he been CHARLEs of France. Whereupon he suddenly swaggers like a
tyrant in a burlesque. An old general is cut to the heart by Court gibes, and the
ukeyisits him on his death-bed; sees him defunct, and, upon view thereof, declares
that “he must accustom himself to the sight of dead bodies!” At these words,
everybody in the City—says the historian—takes alarm; maturally enough, every.
º having a body to which the words aforesaid might be appropriated.
pon which, ominous event follows event. Cannon are planted—and grape-
shot º on the ducal word to the Brunswickers. Finally—Exit Ex-Duke to
the blaze of his hereditary castle.
And now, the Ex-Duke returns to Germany—for awhile. On Tuesday week he
rose in the Nassau Balloon, with due refreshment—(CHARLEs GREEN piloting
QAsah and his hams, and chicken)—“with a large quantity of provisions—water
drags—and gutta percha lines.” The wind blew favourably, but—shifted; and the
balloon, after two hours—
“Sailing in supreme dominion
O'er the azure deep of air—”
of iron, cultivate sugar adm
descended at Gravesend, wind-bound. Determined, how-
ever, upon the flight, the Duke, like the migratory swallow,
only awaits a favourable gale. - -
ng ere, this appears, in print, His Royal Ex-Highness
may—though it is not likely—have descended even in the
midst of #. City of Brunswick; possibly—though, not
probably—near the very steps of the very Church selected
in 1830 to contain 5500 lbs. of gunpowder, destined for the
use of disobedient Brunswickers.
Anyway, the flight of his Ex-HIGHNEss of BRUNSWICK
from Germany, and his return thereto, suggest, by con-
trast, the pleasing thought that Royal CHARLEs may have
benefitted by his long exile here in England. Indeed,
there can be no doubt of it. True it is, that, in his hot,
chivalric youth, he, some twenty years since, threatened his
loving people with a shower of WULCANIC grape, but now,
might we search all the contents of that Nassau Balloon,
we have every belief. that we should find, among the
pullets, copies of Political Justice, and with pātes Périgord,
iring essays of the British habeas corpus.
MINISTRIES POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE.
DURING the late attempt at the formation of ministries
nearly every kind of political chemistry was resorted to,
for He purpose of effecting combinations of the most
astounding character. The natural abhorrence of a vacuum
extends to Downing Street, as it does to every other place,
and so desirable was it to get a ministry of some kind or other
without delay, that efforts of the most extraordinary kind
were made, in all quarters, to get together a Government.
Among all the numerous on dits and actual information,
we saw no account of an attempt which came under our
immediate observation, of some friends of our own to form
a Government. Though not sent for by the QUEEN, the
parties sent for each other, with great vigour, and three
or four of the chiefs were riding about in 'buses, and taking
cabs to such an extent, that had they “come in" they
would have deserved the title of cabbin' it ministers. As
early as Tuesday last, MR. BRIEFLEss called on MR. DUNUP,
and both proceeded, together to BARON, NATHAN, with
whom they remained in consultation several hours. Baron
NATHAN advised with them as to the best steps to be taken,
and a great deal of "...; ensued; but nothin
definitive was arranged, though the following skeleton sketc
of a Cabinet was handed about in several quarters.
Lord Chancellor, MR. BRIEFLEss.
Chancellor of the * MR. DUNUP.
Master of the Horse, MR: WIDDIcomp.
Lord Chamberlain, and Master of the Ceremonies, BARON
NATHAN.
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mons. SoYER.
The Vices of Chancery.
LORD LANGDALE’s bill, for appointing a new Vice-Chan-
cellor, will, it is stated, soon become law. The new Vice-
Chancellor may be a very pleasant man, but the present
state of the Chancery law will only, it is to be feared,
“Of our pleasant Vices
Make whips to scourge us.”
The APPOINTMENT REMAINS OWER.
DISRAELI made sure of an appointment under the
Protectionist Ministry, whereas, as SIBTHORP mockingly
says, “the only appointment poor DIS. got was a Dis-
appointment' "
A Capital Smithfield Joke.
THE friends of Smithfield Market contend for its conti-
nuance on the ground that it causes, to an immense extent,
the circulation of capital. We have only to refer to the
º state of the streets of London on a Smithfield
Market day, to show that, so far from the circulation of
capital being promoted, the circulation of the capital is
almost at a stand in many of the leading thoroughfares.
A BASHAWED LOBSTER.
PUNCH has been asked, in the }; way, to define
what is “a Bashawed Lobster?” Punch thinks it must be
a lobster with three tails; but—if the querist be still in
ldoubt—try SoYER.

PUNCH, OR TIIE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WHAT TO DO WITH THE SURPLUS.
ITERALLY, the real
embarrassment of
the Government
has been an em-
barras des rich-
esses; for the chief
difficulty of the
Cabinet has been
what to do with
the surplus? Had
it been a defici-
encythe Ministers
would have been
used to it, for
they would only
have had to fill
up the hole in the
treasury from the
public pocket, but
the surplus seems
to give as much
trouble as the
sewage, for no-
body knows how
to dispose of it.
The first idea, and
a very unhappy
one, of the CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE
ExchEQUER, was
to distribute it so very lightly over the country that nobody would
feel it—a principle which, though very judicious in the case of taxation
where there is an unpleasant load to be carried, is the reverse of
politic, where a benefit was to be distributed. SiR. C. WooD began
dealing with his surplus as a waiter at Vauxhall deals, with a ham
—by cutting it into such attenuated slices, that half the recipients
would taste nothing at all, and the few, who might be susceptible of
the flavour, would only have a relish engendered for more, by their
appetites being whetted instead of satisfied.
As the CHANCELLoR of THE ExchEQUER will, probably, look to our
pages in the course of the week for suggestions for his budget, to be
exposed to public view on Friday, we will favour him with a hint or two,
for which he ought to, and perhaps will, be very much, obliged to us.
Instead of making everybody dissatisfied by inviting the whole publie
to stand outside his cook's shop and inhale the vapours emanating from
the good things within, and telling us we ought to be as well satisfied
as if we had made a capital meal, we strongly recommend him to give
a hearty good feed to those who want it most, and trust to the patience
of the rest to wait till their turn comes. Let him take off the window
tax at one blow, and if there is anything more to spare, let him devote
it to introducing a principle of something like justice into the imposition
of the income tax. As this arrangement would give nothing to, our
unfortunate friends the agriculturists, and as it is unpleasant to hear
constantly the melancholy roaring of the British Lion, we would pro-
| pose to stop that noble but lugubrious animal's mouth with a lollipop,
in the shape of an equalisation of the poor-rate.
If the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer would proceed to the per-
formance of the first part of our suggestion, and hold out the promise
proposed in the last, we will guarantee himself, and his budget a safe
passage by the Parliamentary Train, and a happy delivery at the
terminus of the session.
THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE OXEN, COWS,
CALVES, PIGS, AND SHEEP,
DRIVEN FOR SALE AND sl, AUGHTER TO SMITHFIELD MARKET.
SHEWETH
that, if there is one place in the world we are especially fond
of, it is Smithfield Market.
We have reason to be fond of it for several reasons.
First of all, there is no place where our comforts are so much studied
as Smithfield Market, and consequently no place where we feel so
comfortable as in that favoured locality.
We are led there by the gentlest of means. Not a blow is resorted
to in order to ſº us the way. We are guided only by our own
instincts. We feel we are going to some loved spot, where we are
sure to be welcomed, and we are only too anxious to get there.
But once in the market, we are fully repaid for any little trouble we
may have º in reaching it. Abundance of space invites us
to rest ourselves. Friends are in waiting to point out to us the most
luxurious spots. Not a harsh word is to be heard. º voice is
tuned by kindness. Our smallest wants are attended to with a quick-
ness and a liberality rarely accorded to strangers. It would seem as if
every drover was a friend who could not do too much to make us º
—as if every butcher was some long-lost relation who was determined,
now that he had found us, to share amongst us the wealth and the
affection he had been accumulating in his breast for years. To look
at us, you would imagine we were all members of one large, united,
happy family.
We want for nothing. We have water in abundance to slake our
thirst; we have hay in profusion, to satisfy our morning appetite ;
and we have straw, deeper and softer than any lady's feather bed,
to recline our lazy bodies upon. What can beast need more? In
fact, Smithfield may be j."the Capital of the Land of Clover—the
Eden of Animal Existence. The pleasure of reaching it is only exceeded
by the pain of leaving it!
That pain is so acute, that, very few of us ever survive it. . Yet,
mortal as we all know it to be, none of us ever regret it, or wish to
avoid it. Our death is a sweet one, being softened by the Elysian plea-
sures that surround it. WE would soonER DIE IN SMITHFIELD MARKET
THAN Live ANYWHERE ELSE'
We therefore live in hope that that sweet pleasure may not be denied
us; and trust that Smithfield will be kept open for many centuries to
come in the very centre of the City of %. on, in order that we may
be allowed the inappreciable luxury of being slaughtered in the midst of
the comforts with which, as a model Market, it abounds.
And we will ever low, bleat, baa, and squeak, &c., &c.
DOWNING STREET COLLEGE.
No time must be lost in establishing a College for Statesmen.
For above a week we have seen the Premiership going a begging,
During all that time—but that Queens do not run—it might be said
that we had HER MAJESTY running about for a Minister. As it was,
she was reduced to the undignified alternative which the vulgar asso-
ciate with the name of Hobson. She was obliged to throw herself
back on Lord JoHN, after all. Another of his “fathom,” if the expres-
sion may be used, “had she not, to lead her business.”
There are more doctors among us than there are deaths; more
lawyers than litigants—and perhaps even than rogues; more parsons
than benefices, some of them puzzled, too, to get any sort of living
notwithstanding the existence of bishops worth more than a plum—i
worth nothing else. There is probably a surveyor for every acre of
land. The civil engineers may be computed to outnumber the coffee-
mills, and, to represent, an amount of physical force equivalent to a
considerable portion of the whole steam-power of the country.
And yet the Times calculates—quite correctly, no doubt—that the
empire contains scarcely more than twenty men who are fit to enter a
Cabinet. So, at any rate, the profession of Statesmanship is not over-
crowded. There is “an opening ” there, at all events. It is probable
that the Sover EIGN will soon be driven to advertise, in the journal just
named, “Wanted, an Upper Servant, and a few Subordinates.” If she
is, there will be not above a score of persons competent to answer the
application, out of flunkeydom—nobody able to serve the Crown in any
State capacity, and with any capacity, except as a Lord in Waiting,
Pinchbeck-stick, Nickel-stick, or other menial.
PRINCE ALBERT, to his honour, interests himself in the cause of
education. Let His Royal HIGHNEss undertake the task of founding
the College for Statesmen, to be called Downing Street College. Be it
the glory of ALBERT to have provided, for the service of his august
consort, at Downing Street, a choice of gentlemen qualified for some
*: employment than that of cleaning his own Albertonians.
he course of instruction should comprise:–
The rudiments of Logic, including the nature of a simple syllogism.
..So much of Moral Philosophy as shall suffice for a perception of the
difference between right and wrong.
Enough of physiology to awaken some slight notion of the influence
which that science should have on sanitary enactments or fiscal measures
affecting the public health, and on criminal legislation.
Colonial History, to the extent of the knowledge possessed by the
generality of commercial schoolboys about the colonies,
Navigation to a corresponding extent; and the principles of Naval
* in as far as i. are commonly understood by an ordinary
tinker.
Law, and especially Chancery Law, in a measure sufficient for the
apprehension of a few of its more glaring abuses and absurdities.
Arithmetic, to a degree of attainment equal to that of an average
apprentice; or adequate to the solution of such a problem as the adjust-
ment of the Income-Tax.
Whether a Downing Street College is instituted or not, politicians
must go to school, somehow or somewhere, or Red Tape will be conti-
nually getting into a knot—or, rather, harl—such as we have just seen
it in, having to be cut, because it cannot be untied.

STREET SPORTS AND PASTIMES.
WE hear a great deal, at times, about play-grounds for the people;
and we really wish there was something of the sort; for we find it very
inconvenient, occasionally, to have sports and pastimes going on in the
public thoroughfares. We don't object, perhaps, to leap-frog when a
arty of young athletes are “backing” their friends in Trafalgar
sº nor have we much to say against the ancient sport of “duck,”
though it now and then subjects one's toes to the “pressure from
without" of a tremendous brick-bat, or paving-stone. #. is, how-
ever, a pastime which we cannot tolerate, and which consists of the
“ignoble game of cat,” as played by the boys in nearly all the streets of
London. The game to which we allude is rendered doubly provoking
by the fact, that it is mysterious as well as mischievous; for we defy
any casual looker-on to say how the game is played; how it is lost;
how it is won; or in what consists the skill of playing it. As far as wé
can judge, the game of cat is indulged in after the following fashion;
Several boys, being got together, with sticks in their hands, a small
piece of wood is thrown down, which, being struck, flies up into the air;
and the game consists, apparently, in the art of hitting the piece of
wood, when thus ra and directing it through a square of g Or

LORD JOHN CINDERELLA.
ONCE, in merry England, less than a hundred, years ago, there
was a little Minister, who stood much higher in his situation than
he did in his stockings; for though he was short of stature he had a
longish head º means of which he continued to govern the country
tolerably well, or some years, under the fº. QUEEN VICTORIA. His
name was John ; but although that was his right name, and he was a
lord, and not a lady, people called him CINDERELLA. This was not Wo
because he used to sit among the cinders, for he had a much more com-
fortable seat than that, only, to be sure, he was now and then called
over the coals. , He came to be named Cin DERELLA, from an adventure
which happened to him, and which you will read about by-and-by in the
History of England.
There was a great House in Westminster, by the side of the River
Thames, near the bridge, so big that it held six hundred and fifty-six
people. They were Englishmen, Welshmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen
mixed together; and some were of this way of thinking, and some of
that; and others of other ways of thinking besides. But the Irishmen
had only one * of thinking, if it was thinking at all. Before John
could make any law to ſº the country, he was obliged to get the
#. part of this. House to agree to it. Now, the people of the
ouse were divided into two * sets, nearly equal in numbers, but
not quite. One set was for big loaves, and the other set for little
loaves; and the big-loaf party was the largest, and stood by John, and
generally consented to what he wished. And so things went on pretty
smoothly, although with a good deal of wrangling and squabbling, for a
time. ... But there were some of John's set that were for going fast, and
some for going quietly, and JoHN himself was for a quiet pace, and, to
*::::: truth, seemed rather too much inclined to stand º
..Then there was another set who cared nothing either for big loaves or
little loaves, or going fast or going slow, or for anything or anybody,
except the Pope of Rome, and his will º which they greatly
preferred to the Queen's. They used to side with or against any one,
without caring at all what part they took, except as it concerned the
Pope, their master. The Irishmen in the House, except one or two,
were these reasonable and loyal people. They had taken John's >
as long as they imagined that he was doing the work of the Pope. But
at last, the Pope invaded the QUEEN’s dominions. The QUEEN and
the people were greatly enraged, and so was John; and he declared he
d oppose the Pope, and kept his word. Upon this the Irishmen
...?º: and sided with his enemies, only out of spite. On the
other hand, many who might have backed him considered that he should
do more against the Pope... So the scale was turned against John, who
at the same time got into disgrace with the House, about his accoun
which he had unluckily trusted to another Minister. He was sovexed an
provoked at being beaten, and he saw such a deal of trouble before him,
if he continued in his place, that he ran away from it in a huff, and left
nothing but his shoes behind him.
What to do for a Minister QUEEN VICTORIA did not know: she sent
everywhere for one, but not one was there to be found either for love
or money, that would suit. . At last, in despair, she had recourse, to a
kind Fairy, who came to her assistance in the shape of an old soldier.
The Fairy assured HER MAJEsty, that he would find her, a Minister;
and made her a present of an old shoe; telling her that the statesman
whose foot would fit it would be the person that he should recommend
to fill the office.
All the great statesmen came to Buckingham Palace to try on this
wonderful shoe. A noble Wiscount of the race of GoRDON made the
attempt in vain, and the BARONET of NETHERBy succeeded no better;
as the shoe obstinately denied a footing to any truckler, to the Pope.
The HEIR or DERby strove hard to squeeze his foot in, but was
unable on account of his corn. The adventurous CoNINGSBY was
anxious for a trial, but his measure having been taken, showed there

was no hope for him. At last, at the command of the old soldier-Fairy,
a little gentleman stepped forward, and put his foot to the shoe, when it
instantly slipped in. At the same moment a mischievous Fairy, that
had been concealed in the crowd, uttering a dismal shriek, flew away in
the form of a robust individual, attired in a broad-brimmed hat and
robes all of scarlet.
The little gentleman turned out to be the identical JoHN who had
run away; the shoe that would fit nobody else, was one of the pair he
had left behind him. He was reinstated in his place; and from the
resemblance of his shoe to the glass-sli 8. of a celebrated young lady,

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A (TOO) LATE
BARRISTER.
I AM an aged junior of forty years standing, and have been an utter
barrister so long without an opportunity of speaking, that I sometimes
fancy I have lost my powers of utterance. If I ever dreamed of º
silk, I now look upon it as all stuff. Whether my clients are worth
shot I know not, but I have certainly none worth the powder—including
the powder-tax—involved in my wig. My only cases are my book-case
and my cigar-case, while my §: bag, which once used to furnish
visions of the woolsack, serves only to remind me of the emptiness of
human ambition. - -
I have tried everything, and have alternated like a pendulum between
law and equity, but my alternations have served about the same purpose
as the pendulum—namely, to mark the progress of time. I have at-
tempted occasionally the office of amicus curiae, but the Court has
looked coldly upon my friendship, and even the very usher, when I take
º seat in the back row, seems to glance at me as much as to say, “It’s
very well, old boy, but you know you have no business here.”
I once used to make a parade of papers, but my constant dumbness
showed them at last to be dummies; and I have now given up appear-
ances, except when a decree is being taken “by consent.” I sometimes
put in a bow, among half-a-dozen others, who, are , representing
‘parties,” at from two to five guineas a “party;” and, if strangers
should be present, I may look as if I was concerned, somehow or other
in the suit. Considering the number of proceedings that are dispatche
in court, by a word or two from a leader, and a chorus of bows from
gentlemen instructed on the same or the opposite side, it is not difficult
to f t up the appearance of a very large practice, by a succession of
well-timed obeisances. Old MoHAIR, the equity junior, who was
called on the same day as myself, early in the present century, has for
some years cleared a considerable income without opening his mouth,
his practice requiring him to “consent,” as second or third counsel;
and he has acquired such a very complying disposition, that he can
refuse nothing to anybody; indeed his head bows so habitually, that he
seems to be recognising some one or other wherever he goes. He has
bowed with such effect, that he might hold up his headº high, if it
were not for the habit he has contracted of ºf it down.
Having no business of my own to attend to, I have had abundant
leisure to attend to the business of others; and I have, during a long
and frequent attendance in the Courts of Chancery, kept a note-book
which would equal, in horrible interest, Fox's Martyrs, but which would
better deserve the title of “Wolf’s Martyrs;” for the victims are like so
many sheep among wolves. Some people have wondered why the
LoRD CHANCELLOR sits upon a woolsack. To me the reason is as clear
as (the absence from London of) the sun at noonday. The woolsack
represents the produce of the fleecings to which the victims in Chancery
are exposed.
. Before I begin the notes from my Diary, I beg to say, that, unhappy
bird as I am, I am not to be charged with fouling º own nest; for the
Court of Chancery has never been a nest to me, nor has it ever afforded
me house or home. Other more distinguished men than myself, who
owe a great deal to Chancery, seem disposed to º it off in very differ-
ent coin from that which they have got out of it; but I do not blame
them, for they took it as they found it; and having had experience of
its iniquities, are the best qualified to set about its reform. To begin
with a great ex-Chancellor, who once nestled in its woolly recesses, and
enjoys a highly desirable nest-egg out of it, I cannot well go beyond
him in describing the errors of its ways.
“The practice of the Court of Chancery,” says this high and respect-
able authority, “is so involved and embarrassing; there is such a luxuri-
ance and intertwining of boughs—such an extension of roots, that whoever
enters it, very speedily finds himself chained to his place, and reduced
to inactivity by the overpowering influence of the errors which he may
be desirous to remove.” This description is, indeed, but too true, for
I have seen many a poor victim so entangled in the boughs, that
* the twig altogether was his only escape. Chancery, may,
indeed, be compared to a forest, for not only is the traveller likely to
lose his way in it, to sink down exhausted with the hopelessness of
getting out of its intricacies, but he may become the victim of the wild
animals of prey with which the forensic forest abounds. These roots
and branches have been growing during a long period, until they now
need the axe of reform to cut them up as the vulgar tongue forcibly
hath it, “root and branch.”
Wolsey, on the woolsack, was the very incarnation of the system of
fleecing, and indeed the name of the “holy fox” Got attached to him,
being the only durable attachment of which he was the object. Some-
what later Chancery fell under the hands of the EARL of NottingHAM,
who, from the tangles, meshes, and nets over which he presided, might
well have merited the title of EARL of KNotts. He was called the
“father of equity,” but how grieved must he have been to find himself
the father of such a reckless and ruinous child. As a junior, Ilook with
respect to the opinion of a SENIOR-the able and intelligent Master in
Chancery of that name—who says that many suits “originate with a
solicitor, the next friend of an infant,” who wishes for costs. “Save
me from my friends,” is often the cry of the adult, but how terrible
would be the scream of the infant to save him from his friend, if the
helpless innocent could be made aware that a solicitor is cultivating an
interested amity for the sake of costs.
The infants in the forest of Chancery are the real babes in the wood,
to whom the solicitor is the wicked uncle, while those poor old birds,
the reporters, bury under the leaves of their reports, all traces of the
miserable victims; like the robins who performed the same friendly
offices for the babes already alluded to. . But my leaves, by the leave of
the public, shall bring the unfortunates to light, and thus I may have
the jºin of aiding a movement where movement is so much

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PIG-TAILS AND THE NO-TAILS.
ONCE upon a time—which is quite as good and authentic a date as in
most chronicles may be youched for—once, upon a time, when Brit-an
signified the Bright, or Shining Island, and Llandian—which signifieth
in British the temple of Diana—stood for London, because in that time
Diana had a fame near the site of the present Goose and Gridiron; a
truth made manifest by the after digging up of the skulls of oxen, to
which the goddess, in her sacrificial festivals, was mightily addicted—
Once upon a time the Britons built a magic ship—a sacred craft.
The timbers of the vessel were grown in Druid woods, from acorns
sown with solemn ceremonies, and watched, and preserved, and lopped
by white-robed priests. We say a sacred craft, built with wisest skill, and
with many mystic rites, called Thek-Ab-Inet, which in British signifies
the strength, and flower, and * of Brit-an, since known as Britain.
Now, it was the religion of the benighted people of Brit-an, or the
Shining Island, to believe that in Thek-Ab-Inet was the destiny of their
country. If the ship answered her helm well, never missed stays, did
not leak, overmuch, and, in fact, behaved herself as a good and decent
ship ought to behave, why, then the Shining Island shone with stead
lustre. If, on the contrary, any mishap occurred to Thek-Ab-Inet, if
she i. among rocks, or run a-ground, or had a foot or so of water in
the hold, why, then, not the youngest baby in the Island of Brit-an
that would not, in some way, through its parents or guardians, be made
to feel the shadow that shadowed the Shining Island. This fact being
borne in the mind of the reader, he will readily believe that Thek-Ab-Inet
jº, * of special wonder and worship to the benighted islanders
Ol Dºrtº-azz.
But besides the ship Thek-Ab-Inet, the people of Britain had, among
themselves, a hundred other ships, all of them manned by the skilfuliet
seamen: by men who, in the stiffest gales of wind, and from among the
most dangerous breakers, had brought their craft safe to port; giving,
in truth, by their wisdom and their hardihood, great example to the
crew of ºinet ; again and again in danger—the ship now upon a
sandbank—now bumping upon a rock—and now, with all hands at the
pumps, trying with all their might to stop a leak.
Now, nevertheless that there were so many sailors, hardy and skilful,
and knowing as pilots, nevertheless, not one of these mariners were
allowed to eat his biscuit aboard that sacred ship, Thek-Ah. Inet. And
wherefore ? In sooth, the cause is a melancholy proof of the supersti-
tion and º: of the people of the Shining Island; but this it is:—
Thek-Ab-Inet was officered and manned in turn by one of two sacred
families, the consecrated ones of the Shining Island. And these
mariners were known as the PIG-TAILs and the No-TAILs. When
PIG-TAIL commanded, and handled the ship, No-TAIL staid a-shore,
contenting himself with abusing PIG-TAIL, as a lubber, yelling to him
from the strand, and asking him if he called that seamanship; shout-
ing out rocks and sand, and with ferocious happiness predicting speedy
LEGAL MOVEMENTS.

learned gentlemen had not
met for some months until

the formation of a Ministry.
Both had in fact become
º by a mutual cool-
ut
meeting they agreed to re-
serve in future all their cool-

- - BRIEFLEss was the first to
make the advance, which was much to his credit, as neither of the learned gentlemen are in
kind. The reconciliation has been most cordial, and
of a bill stamp, adorned with one
of Mr. BRIEFLEss's characteristic drawings, and accepted in the same spirit in which it was
shipwreck. And then Thek-Ab-Inet would now and then, run bump
ashore, and—for guns there were not—strike minute-strokes on the
gong—strokes of distress. Whereupon the No-TAILs, with all the
glee of wreckers, would man their gig, or jolly-boat, or whatever
the thing was called in those dark days, and pull off to take posses-
sion of Thek-Ab-Inet, the crew of PIG-TAIIs giving, up the ship
with the keys of their lockers, and coming ashore in their turn, to
abuse the No-TAILs tacking in the straits. . .
And so for hundreds of years it went on, Thek-Ab-Inet never carrying
a soul aboard that was not of the family of PIG-TAIL or No-TAIL.
It may be supposed that this superstition, occasioned much loss, and
withal great chagrin to the Fº of the Shining Island; who would
now and then murmur and grumble; especially when the lubberly
seamanship of the PIG-TAILs or the No-TAILs run, the ship ashore in
the smoothest weather. Nevertheless, the people were continually
answered, and, for the time, silenced by certain men, the priestly
kindred of the PIG-TAILs and the No-TAILs. -
Once, when, Thek:4b-Inet struck upon the Lock Reef, otherwise
known as the Reef of Votes, with a strong wind blowing from Cardinal
Point, and the PIG-TAILs struck strokes of distress upon the #.".
and the No Tams º: off to the ship that they might handle her;
and afterwards found that they must rowback again, not having in them
seamanship for such a stress of weather, upon such a coast,--at that
very time, the Islanders cried, why not let This and THAT, and HE and
They—all of them famous sailors, who, on their own account, had
piloted the seas for years; and, moreover, had shown how the most
were to be made of trade winds,-when these pilots and sailors were
put forth by the º: as men that should take a turn in Thek-Ab-Inet
just to see how they could overhaul her, then— -
Then stepped forth certain Druids—kinsmen and friends of the PIG-
TAILs and No-TAILs, and said— - -
“Sacrilegious people, do you know what it, is you ask?. It is
very true that Captain THIS is an excellent sailor—Captain THAT a
thorough-going old Tar—Pilot. He and Quartermasters THEY, real,sons
of the Brine: but were they born with PIG-TAIIs?... Have they here-
ditary queues Neither are they of the tribe of No-TAILs, inasmuch as
THIs and THAT, and HE and THEY, have a certain curl, a small twist of
hair at the back of the head, that, whilst it cannot be called a PIG-
TAIL, neither can it be taken as No-TAIL soever. They may be the
best seamen of Brit-an, the skilfulest Fº of the world, but belonging
neither to PIG-TAILs nor No-TAILs, they never set a foot aboard the
sacred oak of Thek-Ab-Inet.”
And so the Ship was suffered to bump upon Lock Reef, or the Reef
of Votes, with a º heavy wind blowing from Cardinal Point. How
Thek:40. Inet got safely into deep water—if she ever did so; if, indeed,
she did not sooner or later go to pieces—history has not unveiled to us.
THE CLAIMS OF ST. BARNABAS'S
PIPER.
It is pretty #." known that St. Barna-
bas's Church, Pimlico, has an Organist. It is
less generally known that the same sacred edifice
has a Piper. Smaller, still, may be the notoriety
of the circumstance, that this musician is waiting
to be remunerated.
Punch has seen a circular, addressed to “My
dear Parishioners.” and signed by W.E.BENNETT
stating that St. Barnabas's Piper has to be paid
to the tune of “somewhere about £3400.”
This document, which is dated “Quinqua-
gesima,” states that MR. BENNETT will part with
St. Barnabas's on the “Feast of the Annuncia-
tion;”” but that, as one of the Trustees of the
Building Fund, he will still be bound to all its
liabilities, and ends with a request that reduces
BENNETT to BELISARIUs.
But let not Punch be misunderstood. It is but
reasonable that º who enjoyed the music should
pay the Piper, and lighten those obligations which
—with imprudent zeal, perhaps—MR. BENNETT
has, for their pleasure and amusement, con-
tracted with his tallow-chandler and other
tradesmen.
Yes; the St. Barnabas's Piper should be paid by
the Parishioners; but oh, candles and crotchets!

'Tis about a base conspiracy, as quickly shall appear;
'Twill make your hair to bristle up, and your eyes to start and glow,
When of this dread consperacy you honest folks shall know.
The news of this consperracy and villianous attempt,
I read it in a newspaper, from Italy it was sent:
It was sent from lovely Italy, where the olives they do grow,
And our Holy Father lives, yes, yes, while his name it is No No.
And 'tis there our English noblemen goes that is Puseyites no longer,
Because they finds the ancient faith both betteris and stronger...
And 'tis there I knelt, beside my lord when he kiss'd the Pope histoe,
And hung his neck with chains at Saint Peter's Vinculo.
And 'tis there the splendid churchesis, and the fountains playing grand,
And the palace of PRINCE Toºlonia, likewise the Vatican;
And there’s the stairs where the bagpipe-men and the piñrary's blow,
And it’s there Ldrove my lady andlord in the Park of Pincio.
And 'tis there our splendid churchesis in all their pride and glory,
Saint Peter's famous Basilisk and Saint Mary's Maggiory;
And them benighted Protestants, on Sunday they must go
Outside the town to the preaching-shop by the gate of Popolo.
Now in this town of famous Room, as I dessay you have heard,
There is scarcely any gentleman as hasn't got a

That there should always barbers be wheresumever beards do grow.
And as it always has been so since the world it did begin,
The Pope, our Holy Potentate, has a beard upon his chim;
And every morning regular when cocks begin to crow,
There comes a certing party to wait onlºope Pio.
There comes a certing gintleman with razier, s and lather, 1.

And now the dread consperracy I’ll quickly to you show,
Which them º º form against NoNo.
Them sanguinary Prodestants, which Iabore and hate,
Assembled in the preaching-shop by the Flaminian gate;
And they took counsel º their selves to deal a deadly blow
Against our gentle Father, the Holy Pope Pio.
Exhibiting a wickedness which I never heerd or read off;
wº º º think them Prodestans wish'd? to cut the good Pope's
ead oil .
And to the kind Pope's Air-dresser the Prodestant Clark did go,
And proposed him to decapitate the innocent Piol
“What hever can be easier,” said this Clerk—this Man of Sin,
“When you’re call'd to hoperate on His Holiness's chim,
Than just to give the razier a little slip-just so?--
And there’s an end, dear barber, of innocent Prol”
This wicked conversation it chanced was overerd
By an Italian lady; she heard it every word; .
hich by birth she was a Marchioness, in service forced to go
With the Parson of the preaching-shop at the gate of Popolo.
When the lady heard the news, as duty did obleege,
As fast as her legs could º, her she ran to the Poleege.
“O, Polegia,” says she, (for they pronounts it so),
“They 're going i. to massyker our Holy Pope Pio.
“The ebomminable Englishmen, the Parsing, and his Clark,
His Holiness's Air-dresser devised it in the dark!
And I would recommend you in prison for to throw
These villians would esassinate the Holy Pope PIo!
“And for saving of His Holiness and his trebble crownd
I humbly hope your Worships will give me a few pound;
cause I was a Marchioness many years ago,
Before I came to service at the gate of Popolo.
“That sackreligious Air-dresser, the Parson and his man,
Wouldn't, though ask’d continyally, own their wicked plan—
And so the kinſ Authoraties let those villians go
That was plotting of the murder of the good Pio NoNo.
Now isn't this safishnt º: ye gentlemen at home,
How wicked is them Prodestans, and how good our Pope at Rome;
Soletus drink confusion to Lord John and LoRD MINTo,
And a health unto His Eminence, and good Pio NoNo.”

THE MINISTERIAL MANAGERS.
ositively wenust callupon our Ministerial
managers to be alittle more sure, in future,
of what their company can do, and what
pieces they mean to bring out, when they
are about to open the two Great Houses
for legislative performances. A failure
before they have got through the first act
is a lamentable instance of mismanage-
ment, particularly when the resources are
so slender, that the house must be closed
for want of something to fallback upon.
We should be sorry to see our. Great
National Establishmentrendered ridiculous
after the fashion of some of those unfor-
tunate theatres, which are always com-
mencing a fresh season with some
“astounding novelty,” which before the
end of the week is withdrawn, and, by its
fate, cuts short the season so effectually,
that another has to be commenced if the
house is opened. Already we have had
two closings of the Great Parliamentary
Theatre in a month, because the managers
have been unable to redeem the promises
held out in their bills; and there is every
reason to fear further failures, if some powerful additions are not
made to the present rather inefficient company.
Though infarce there is tolerable strength, and though in the heavy
line there are several highly respectable performers, we must say that
the serious business is by no means well provided for. We know there
are many who would like to form º of the ministerial troupe, without
having any real qualifications for the task; and though there is much
anxiety among the Young Englanders to do the juvenile business, or,
professionally speaking, to enact the youthful, heroes, we cannot say
weº: like to see them put into the parts they believe themselves
sulted tor.
CONSIDERATIONS ON THE ECCLESIASTICAL-TITLES BILL.
Addressed to (Over) Zealous Protestants.
THE Ecclesiastical Titles Bill is “weak.” The loss of titles would
e of no great consequence to Rome. It would only tend rather
strongly to disabuse superstitious minds of a belief in the omnipotence
of Rome's decrees.
The Papal hierarchy was only constituted to make it appear that
Popery was becoming the religion of England in consequence of the
intercession of the Popish Church, and thus to invest it with the seem-
ing recommendation of public opinion, and supernatural testimony.
The repudiation of the Pope's bishops by the formal and national dis-
allowance of their titles, would only defeat the whole manoeuvre.
Should anti-Papallegislation be abandoned after anti-Papal agitation,
its abandonment will only be regarded by every Papist, º eve
person Popishly inclined, as a miracle. It will only be trumpeted fort
as such by every Popish*. in the kingdom, and only be believed by
every man, woman, and child with a Popish bias, in the QUEEN’s
dominions. - - -
The consequence will only be an indefinite increase of Popery.
What matter?
The Papists say that the Roman Catholic Church is holy. Well;
perhaps it is—for the Roman Catholic Church is an abstraction: what
else it is, who knows? The Roman Catholic Church never persecuted.
Of course not. , Abstractions don't burn people alive.
It was only the Roman Catholic hierarchies of particular countries
that are answerable for all the atrocities that were perpetrated in those
countries in the name of the Church. Should Popery get the upper
hand here, we might only have a wicked Popish hierarchy to-morrow.
Qur present Popish hierarchy is a patterm of all Christian virtues—
inclusive of candour and veracity. What *. what may happen?
These considerations, zealous, but acute. Protestants, should induce
you to think small beer of the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and be careless
about it, and pooh-poohit, and let the Pope quietly triumph.

TABLEAU-REPRESENTING MR, BRIGGS OUT FOR A DAY'S RABBIT-SHOOTING,
WANTED, A GOVERNMENT.
I KNow not a thing so inducive to vapours,
As reading what’s lately appear'd in the papers:
LORD THis and LORD THAT have been making such bother;
One calling on one, and the other on t'other:
Proclaiming the want of some statesman to guide us,
Which, perhaps, an advertisement might have supplied us.
In a future dilemma, the following rhymes -
Should, without hesitation, be sent to the Times:—
A Government wanted, adapted to fill
The usual places with average skill.
Superior attainments are not indispensable,
Provided position and birth are ostensible.
An average share of the smallest ability
Will suffice, when eked out with patrician gentility.
The highest positions in number are few—
ld patronage large, with occasional new;
And, besides, (though 'tis scarcely worth while to put that in),
There are plenty of places for friends to grow fat in.
The Premier must know all the several branches—
Home, Foreign, Colonial, Law, and Finances;
He’s expected to speak in the House like a native,
But in nothing need show an invention creative;
He must boast an acquaintance with neighbouring nations,
But his first care may be his own private relations.
And as colleagues, of course, in support should be hearty,
The Cabinet might be a family party.
Wanted a Government able to fill
The usual places with average skill; -
That the country may think the “traditions” of ruling
From birth are derived, not acquired by schooling.
Of the pay, why, of course, cela va sans dire,
It varies from one to five thousand a year;.
But of that, 'tis as well after all to be stinting.
To low interlopers it’s one way of hinting,
That unless by their fortune already on velvet, .
If they’ve any ambition, at once they may shelve it:
Though the Governing families born to the trade |
Don't object to accepting their salary’s aid.
Birth aristocratic—well traced by chronology
Indispensable—though perhaps by way of apology
For an origin, which of itself would disparage,
There might be a chance for connection by marriage.
These are the principal matters: (au reste),
Applications may be to the Queen's Head address'd.
Before we conclude let us add a PS,
In which a great fact we will frankly confess—
As one can't on the “families” always rely,
For of Governments stable a certain supply,
And as the º may, from quarter to quarter,
Be growing decidedly shorter and shorter,
There may yet be a chance for mere talent and worth,
Divested of all the “traditions” of birth,
Who may to the country assistance afford,
Although not connected at all with a lord.
The stock that is needed was long ago planted,
So let’s hear no more of “A Government wanted.”
Napier on a Broomstick.
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, in his Indian speech—full of character—has a
fling at a certain man of the press, a Bombay editor, and says that “he
(NAPIER) has sometimes wished to be near that man with a broom-
stick.” Really, is it worthy of a soldier to wish for a broomstick, when
he has shown himself so great in military brushes?

PLAYING AT PUSEYISM.
TALKING of Puseyism, and their lighting so many candles, (by-the-
bye, their Patron Saint must be St. BLAſses), a newly-made convert
has been heard to doubt whether after all “le jeu vaut la Chandelle?”

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

JOHN BULL BEATEN.
In a Letter from a Contributor to Mr. Punch.
UNCH, My DEAR AND EstEEMED
CHIEF-At the meeting of your Privy
Council, which you assembled upon the
appearance of CARDINAL WIsemaN's
first letter, dated from the Flaminian
Gate, the course which Mr. Punch was
to pursue, under the circumstances of
the Papal aggression, was debated
eagerly at your Board. What was to be
- done? Would we stand it? Would we
= allow a foreigneering Prince to appoint
- officers, and confer titles, in
England? It was too bad
—too insolent—we wou
not have it at any price
and so forth. The Counci
was very stormy. I see our
friend the Professor of
Theolo battling with
...; fists, and thump-
ing and defying the Pope
and all his crew.
“Our friend, the Profes-
sor of Belles Lettres, sate
by; sneered, at the agita-
tion; said it was absurd,
and that we could do no-
thing, and was the only one
of the conclave who seemed
to be undisturbed by the
general commotion. And
our dear friend, the Pro-
fessor of Mediaeval Design, whose faith and whose affections were with the party which we
were met to oppose, quitted us to join the banner displayed now for the first time these
300 years, and under which the Cardinal was marching upon our country. For this is amongst
the consequences of religious debate: it separates brethren; estranges parent and child; parts
dear friends; angers and embitters honest, hearts. By Jupiter. AMMON, Sir, rather than
have lost our friend the Professor of Mediaeval Design, I would have foregone a bench of
Bishops and a whole conclave of Cardinals—the Pope can make those any º
“To continue: amidst parties assembled at your table there was one Right Honourable
Gentleman, the learned Professor of Gastronomy—your humble servant, indeed—whose
opinion with respect to the present crisis was, he believes, as follows:– The insult,” said
that gentleman," that we Englishmen, we lords of the world, have received from an Italian
bishop, reviving pretensions as absurd and antiquated as those of the priests of Jupiter,
or the Druids, is clear. How can we be otherwise than indignant?’ The indifference of the
Right Honourable Gentleman, Professor of Belles Lettres, shocks me. With all, our might,
and with all our hearts, we must show that we are English citizens; and, since these Roman
riests will have a procession among us, we must greet them with a jeer and a growl. For
leration has its limits; if gentlemen choose to wear pigtails, or beards, or hats as broad as
washing-tubs, against the custom of my country, I’ll laugh at them—and have a right to
laugh; if they bring a winking statue into the Strand, I’ll sneer, and say, ‘Stuff!-away with
your rubbish of winking pictures and miraculous dolls!’. If Lorp SMOLLETT (let us call him)
were to walk down Pall Mall, with a jack chain round his neck, his footman after him, I
would join the mob that hooted him. Carry on these rites, friends, at home. Dress, undress,
kneel, chant, shave, or not, as you like; but don't bring your vagaries into our streets—we
don’t believe in them, we flout them utterly to scorn, My poor winking statue !—you may
wink for a week, and what do I care? Narrate that legend to the tº: and wink at
Rimini, not here, sub Jove, in Fleet Street, in the year 1851. And, as in Rome, when a
procession passes, or the fore blessed the city and the world, every man of good feeling
would take off his hat and bow his head with the crowd, so do you, of your part, respect our
manners and religion—take off your hat to it decently, and don't keep on that absurd
Cardinal's broad-brim in public. - -
“‘What then was our duty,’ asked the Professor of Gastronomy, when His Eminence
marched on us from the Flaminian Gate? To fling stones on the procession? No. To
subject any single person who was carrying a banner, or tossing an incense pot, or twanging a
chant, to imprisonment or violence? No. To laugh at the whole business, to meet it with
denial, with scorn, with every imaginable PROTEST. Yes. To that public assertion of the
Catholic party it was º the duty of the Protestant party to shout a denial—and, if
Punch, and LoRD JoHN, and º England did not bellow, Heaven help our lungs.
“‘But why protest when you can do nothing more?” says the Professor of Belles Lettres.
-I say, if we do nothing more than protest i. protest is good and wholesome. You do
not knock down a man who insults you in the street, but you have a right to feel angry—or,
suppose a lady boxes your ears, you do not, in reply, hit her on the nose, but it is quite
consistent with good morality that you should feel #it at the outrage, and say, ‘Madam,
I protest that your behaviour is monstrous, and your aggression an impertinence.’ And so we
have º: and done right to protest. It is a sentimental satisfaction—a record entered-
a medal struck, as it were-as when Pope WHAT-Do-you-call-EM struck a medal in com-
memoration of the murder of the Huguenots, he did not cause there by the slaughter of any
single Calvinist more, but simply recorded his ghostly satisfaction at that victorious assertion
of his principles, and at that event so triumphant for his faith.
“My counsel then, to you, Sir, was to protest
once or twice as loudly asNº. and there’s
an end on't—to chalk up ‘No Popery’ in as large
letters as you could, and so to leave the business.
We can’t persecute. We can deny. We can say
oh! pshal bosh! stuff and nonsense! protesting,
y various ways and arguments, but no more.
And to some Right Honourable Professors at
}}. table, who inclined to repressive measures,
had to offer a respectful opposition.
“We can't use repressive measures—has not
the agitation of the last three months proved it?
Lord Punch, LoRD John, LoRD AshLEY, the
Times, the whole country are in wrath; and we
find we can do nothing but protest!
É. back to religious, any more than to any other
ind of Protection: and having once announced
free religion, and taken the duties off faith, we
ld have not the means of setting them on again.
We can't fight Roman Catholicism by enact-
ments—Oh, me! and our enormous Establish-
ment of Custom House officers is still on foot!
“But that is a question, º interestin
to the Bench of Bishops perhaps, and the rest o
the ecclesiastical douane,) but not at present in
debate. The case at present seems to stand—so.
“We are insulted; we are angry; we are
beat. That is to say, if we want to retaliate for
an insult committe * us, we can't—and
LoRD JoHN, menaced by foe ecclesiastic, has
stepped back, has lifted his mighty arm to defend
himself, (or rather to hit out) and has dropped
that muscular weapon—not of defence, but
offence.—We can't strike. And thank heaven,
we can’t. Thank, heaven, I say, that a great
nation, stung, outraged as it has been, by a
monstrous insult, and perfidy of priestly aggres:
sion, has in its imperial armoury no weapon of
offence upon which it can lay a hasty hand to
punish the outrage; and can't persecute though
ever so angry. A few scores of years hence,
when harc certamina come to be described; when
that struggle is over, whereof we are but now at
the beginning; when that battle is fought, for
which we are taking our sides, and the ground
seems to be getting cleared every day—when it
shall be decided whether free thought, free
speech, and free commerce among men are to
exist—and we are to have railroads and Ross's
Telescopes, and books for all—or a régime of
Russian grenadiers, Index Expurgatorius, and
LoRD WISEMAN's hat, I say on that, day, when
this present one comes to be chronicled, I wonder
how the history will go?
“It will say perhaps:-
“‘At the commencement of the second half of
the nineteenth century, the ancient faith was
suddenly revived in England by the pious ener
of SAINT NICHOLAs, of Seville. Landing in the
country, amidst the almost frantic hostility of
the islanders, the most powerful in arts, arms,
and commerce, although the most benighted of
the inhabitants of Europe, SAINT Nicholas was
assailed on his first arrival by the Soverei
º; Head of the Sect calling itself a Church,
and dominant in that part of Britain); , by the
Prime Minister'a deplorable fanatic of Calvinistic
º ; by the Legislature, and a vast majority
of the nation. The country rose against him;
persecutions were threatened; tortures were in
preparation; ... chains, fines, and imprisonment
were devised for SAINT Nicholas and his *i.
But aid was at hand, and the arm which the
powerful Minister raised to smite the meek cheek
of the Cardinal, was staid by an influence which
we must, &c., &c. The clergy of the neigh-
bouring island of ireland (since removed by the

members of the Britannic Legislature, men re:
markable for the polish of their manners, and
the ſervid piety of their lives—above, all, the dis-
sensions among the English themselves, caused
the uplifted arm to fall powerless, which was

116 - PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
about to descend upon SAINT NIGHolas, and averted the glaive which would have found a
willing and joyful martyr. SAINT Nicholas and his clergy were suffered to live unmolested,
and continued, in and about London, making many converts, until the invasion of the great
Austro-French Force, under the two Emperors, accompanied by the Pope in person, when
religion was established, finally, in this country, to be disturbed no more. The unmarried
Bishops of the late establishment were generously admitted ad eundem, &c., &c., &c.’
iſ this be the tale, or will it be one of a different tendency and moral, which the
reader of future times will peruse—MR. MacAULAY's New Zealand Traveller, let us say,+
looking at the remains of Westminster and surveying the ruins of St. Paul’s?”
THE CHICORY
QUESTION.—COUNTER MORALITY.
sº ID the prophetic Pope
—wermean Pope ALEx-
ANDER, of Twicken-
ham-predict the con-
dition of our present
CHANCELLoR of THE
Exchequer, when the
Poet wrote thus on
coffee:-
*Coffee, which makes the
politician wise,
And see through all things
with his half-shut eyes.”
Could the bard have
waticinated thus of the
statesman, making SIR
CHARLEs Wood see so
very clearly through the
difficulties of his Budget
by means of coffee—of
coffee profitably qualified
with chicory? How-
ever, what avails the
sharpsightedness of SIR
CHARLes Wood? The
coffee-dealers are against
him. SIR CHARLEs
wishes—or did wish, for
never were past and
present tenses so differ-
ent to an Exchequer
Chancellor—to legalise
the sale of chicory. But
this is a plain-dealing
in no way.comformableto
the candid wishes of cer-
tain counter-moralists—
good men in aprons—
who denounce the sim-
plicity of the Minister as sheer foolishness in the eyes of courageous, money-making tradesmen.
‘What would the poor do without the poor?” is an old interrogation, carrying with it a
homage to human nature in its sympathy with fellow-suffering. What would the “respectable”
tradesman do without the poor?—has another sort of meaning, written or implied in the
shop-bills of those grocers who smugly swindle behind the counter, fobbing off poverty with
sham articles, and growing sleek and rich on daily adulteration. How often may “respecta-
bility” start its gig on counter counterfeits? -
... At the meeting of coffee-dealers—drawn together to consider SIR CHARLEs Wood's inten:
tions towards chicory—there was some outspeaking, quite worthy of the ingenuousness of
Newgate or Coldbath Fields. Had the words issued from the throats of men cropped by
prison barber and clothed in prison grey, they could not have had a more truly brassy
ring, sounding of convicted wrong-doing. “One touch of nature makes the whole world
kin;” and greed–greed at all hazards—is alike in the adroit knave who “frisks a till,” and
in the smooth dealer, who, by counterfeit goods, fills the till aforesaid with dishonest gains.
MR. T. BARING, M.P., was anxious for fair-dealing; and for expressing such anxiety he was
“hissed.” He was anxious—
“If a substitute for coffee was produced as agreeable to the public taste, it should be offered to the public atthe
lowest price, and not palmed off at a higher price than it would fetch if its true name were given to it."
Hissed again—and, no doubt, very conscientiously rebuked by the dissentients. What!
sell chicory as chicory, and not as the best Mocha? Cease to gull the poor, who are
expressly made poor for the benefit of the dealer—made poor, and poorer, by counterfeits-
why, it is to give up the due prerogative of trade in all its ardour of competition. All-
“All that he sought for was, that it should not be said in London that they were not anxious for fair trade, and
no deception.”
More hisses; the dissenting parties having no such anxiety—having, on the contrary, a
keener desire to sell a flam for a truth; inasmuch as the flam returned the greater and the
sweeter profit. -
MR. Moffat came in for his proper share of disapprobation, and it served him right.
He would have the coffee-dealer and the chicory-dealer distinct. Whereas many of the
meeting were, after their fashion, clamorous for the mixed thing—“the mixture of a lie doth
ever please,” says the philosopher Bacon—as good for families.
A retail-dealer, in his philanthropy towards the
poor, advocated the mixed article as “a poor
man's question.” He said chicory “improved
the strength” of coffee. No doubt of it; even
as copperas improves the froth of beer, and oil
of capsicum improves the heat of gin. The
retailer pathetically declared, that—
“It was found that when grocers had chicory on their
premises, it was impossible—such was the demand of the
public—to prevent them from mixing it. (Cheers and
hisses.)”
º: not to mix.” We believe in the
impossibility, to a certain sort of trader, just as
it would be impossible for IKEY Solomons to
keep his fingers from mixing with the contents of
a man's pocket, if the had a promising
look of profitable investment. Only such men
as our retail-dealer know what it is to struggle
for pure coffee against the blandishments of
winning chicory.
MR, DEANE, of Shoreditch, amidst a storm of
virtuous clamour, produced a sample of poor
man's fine rich Mocha. It consisted of burnt
peas, dog-biscuit, powdered earth, and some-
thing “too horrid to mention,” though old
coffin-boards were more than hinted. And—said
MR. DEANE–"four tons” of such profitable
abomination were now on hand, and, as “a sub-
stitute for chicory and snuff,” might be had, a
profitable penn'orth, by the hardy dealer—the
safe swindlerina safe apron. .
A moralist, of Islington, said—
“The man who sold coffee at the cheapest rate could
afford to keep his trade wholesome by buying for
with chicory the best coffee that was imported.”
A “wholesome” trade being a trade in one
article that is nominally put off for another.
Thus, the smasher who successfully utters a
piece of gilt copper for a sovereign—or, if his
trade be among the poorer sort, a bit of silvered
zinc for a shilling—such smasher “keeps his
trade wholesome.” Good, shop morality!
The meeting concluded in a hurricane of
feeling; many speakers having their short, sig-
nificant say upon the matter in contention. One
severe dealer exclaimed, that “coffee was a
luxury: * Therefore, chicory was to be put
off as the real Turkey berry on the beguiled
customer. “We don’t care if coffee goes out of
use altogether,” cried another, no doubt strong
in his confidence in the unfailing supply of burnt
peas—dog-biscuit—and old coffin-boards.
“The poor man has a right to have it mixed,”
shouts A.
“And”—vociferates B.-" and he shall have
it.” And we believe in the sincerity of B., in so
far as in B. lies; and certainly the moral and
honest determination of B. pervaded very many
letters of the alphabet represented by clamorous
coffee-dealers—or rather dealers who, struggle as
they might, had no doubt found it “impossible”
to refrain from mixing.
But the question stirred at the meeting em-
braces almost every trade. If grocers are to
be called upon to expose chicory, in all its ugly
nakedness, to be sold at a correspondingly cheap
price, when, mixed with coffee, it might carry the
coffee rate, the public will be clamouring to
have all other articles vended with the like sim-
plicity. For instance:
FINE Bohea—Good BRITISH SLoe-Leaves |
Best WHEATEN BREAD-ALUM, Potato
Flour, PLAstER or PARIs!
FINE Devonshine BUTTER—Good Hog's
LARD !
West-INDIAN ARRow Root—Potato STARCH!
Bees-WAx—STRong Rosſ N'
BLANc-MANGE-ARseNITE of Copper
CAYENNE PEPPER—BRick-Dust, Ochºº!
ChocoLATE – SEA-Biscuit, Cocoa-Nut
Shells!
HoNEy—SYRUP of Potato-SUGAR!
SugaR-SAND !
Now, if the Grocers be compelled to sell their
coffee from one canister and their chicory from

117
another, demanding for either article a distinct price,—is it not plain
that the above commodities will be submitted to the same rule of single-
ness? Is it not plain that Bohea will no longer be mixed with leaves
from British hedges, and that West-Indian sugar will be sold pure in
its conical half-pound for the stomach of the consumer, and the sand
be vended separate for the poor man's spittoon or floor? As it is,
like coffee and chicory, they are mixed, and—no doubt—according to
certain tradesmen, the poor, like their sugar with sand; nevertheless,
let coffee and chicory be disunited, and the commercial bond so long
existing between the above-named articles must be dissolved. As it
is, like married folks, they are bound together for better or worse;
and like some unhappily joined, though the two are brought together,
neither law nor habit can make them ONE. There can be no happy
union between fine Muscovado and pulverized gravel; therefore Punch,
for this and all times, emphatically forbids the banns.
LEGISLATI-PHOBIA.
REMARKABLE in-
| could not get a
º House together.
ºf The honourable member
- who seems to have suc-
ceeded to the office
which might be appro-
priately termed the whip-
ing post, declared his
inability, on the night in
tion, to accomplish
*: of bringing forty
members together; for,
though “there were seve-
ral about the House, they
evinced,” he said, “a
determined objection to
o into it.” “You may
rag a horse to the
water,” says the proverb,
“but you can't make him
drink :” and it may now
be added, that you may get an M. P. as far as the door of the House
of Commons, but you can't compel him to go in and legislate.
We are really quite puzzled by the sort of phobia that seems to rage
just now among legislators in general, and Ministers in particular.
Perhaps the example of the latter has done the former no good, for if
Jack is a dull boy, and don't get on, it is natural enough that all on
the lower forms should share his want of energy.
LIBERTY HALL AT FREEMASONS TAVERN.
PUNCH must put on a white sheet. Punch must take a long candle
in his hand, and walk up and down Fleet Street, singing Peccari through
his nose. For Punch has sometimes imputed a spirit of intolerance to
that liberal Church under whose influence Italy has become so free,
and Ireland so happy. But Punch has been confuted. An incident
which occurred at the late meeting of Roman Catholics at the Free-
masons' Tavern, shows what an unhappy booby Punch has been in
supposing that there was anything but meekness and charity in the
faith of QUEEN MARy, of milky memory. The grounds of Punch's
recantation are contained in the Times of last Tuesday week, which
states, that, at the above-mentioned meeting, the Chairman was about
to put a resolution,
“When a stout gentleman with moustachios stood up, and claimed to be heard for a
moment. He was assailed with loud shouts and groans from various parts of the hall.”
These are demonstrations which any assembly would make, if out-
raged by the intrusion of a monster of wickedness. But the wicked-
ness of this intruder was so enormous that—in fact, it must be described.
The wretch—not to call him, as the Times does, “the gentleman”—
“Rushed to the front of the platform, and was received by a storm of groans and
hisses. He exclaimed that “his name was KAIs ER" (or “KEYsen, we won't answer
for the orthography), and that he only wanted to ask a question—one question of the
irman.”
Only one question!—Yes; but to question what? To question an
act, of the Lord-Lieutenant of Heaven and Earth :, of his Celestial
Holiness, Sovereign of Sovereigns, the Pope. Whilst the shouts of
the indignant faithful “grew into yells,”
stance of Legisla-
- tiphobia occurred
| on Thursday, the
== 13th of March,
| when all the Mi-
misterial whip-
ping in the world
“MR. KAisºn, determined to have some information on a subject in which he seemed
to take so much interest, leaned over the reporters' table, and, with undeniable energy of
voice; exclaimed, ‘I wish to ask the chairman if he agrees with the Pope in the per-
secution he has set on foot against the Jews in Rome at this present time?' If he had
heaped up a whole orchard of apples of discord before them, the unfortunate querist could
not have more excited the wrath of the assembly, not, however, against the Pope, but
against himself.”
No wonder. , What a shocking question to ask!
unseasonable; how provokingly awkward! . “I)oes your Pope, good
folks, practise toleration himself?” That is what it came to. What
a query to suggest to the º: just at this time! And yet, how mildly
this much-enduring assembly resented it !—
“The screaming was frantic—one gentleman in red hair and spectacles, who looked
like an ecclesiastic, rushed forward behind the chairman, and shook his fist at the
offending KAISER, while his words were lost in the storm; an elderly woman, with a
very large and stout umbrella, poked him on the shins and lower extremities with great
vigour and animosity, while the invitations to ‘Kick him out,' from the platform and
body of the meeting, were of a very vehement and unanimous character.”
. The fist, would never hold a torch—the umbrella would never turn
into a red-hot poker, by any Rºle operation of the blessed principle
of “Development.”. Oh, no! This scene of moderation and gentleness
terminated in the following pleasant and peaceable way:-
“KAISER, having repeated his question in the most intrepid manner, for the satis-
faction of himself and a confidential reporter, descended from the platform with some
|declaration respecting the behaviour of the Pope to the Jews, and was speedily eli-
minated from the meeting by a very vigorous physical process, which some few of the
gentlemen on the platform endeavoured to moderate.”
. There—only think of that!. A sacrilegious wretch has the horrible
impiety to call the conduct of the holy Pope in º and is only
kicked out for it, and some of the Pope's children actually try to
moderate the kicking. The miscreant was not even torn in pieces !
And these are the good folks whose, views Punch has spoken of as
bigoted and irrational! Bring us the sheet! Fetch us the taper!
Pecca-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-vi-i-i-i-i-mus!

Couple of “BRUISERs.” MR. BRIGGS DESPATCHES THE “WHITECHAPEL CHICKEN” AND THE “BAYswAtER SLASHER.”
HE WOULD BE BEATEN.
MAwworm liked to “be despised;” but LoRD JoHN—who at all events
is no hypocrite—seems to love to be beaten. Our contemporary, the
Times, compared his Lordship, the other day, to one of the celebrated
order of flagellants; and it is certain that,even the Treasury whips
d to the ministerial wounds, for the said whips fail to whip up a
House when it is required.
It is said to be foolish to dash one's head inst a wall: but the
Ministers seem to be actually on the look-out º walls to dash their
heads against. A skilful pilot seeing breakers a-head, steers another
way; but the present pilot of the State vessel appears to look out for
them, merely for the purpose of making for them, and enjoying, the
fun of seeing whether it is possible to go slap-bang upon a rock without
going to pieces.
Nobody thought much about the Ceylon difficulty, until LoRD JOHN
commenced piping all hands, and calling on his crew to make right
away for the point of danger, just to see whether it is really enough of
a rock to wreck the vessel. Perhaps the ministerial commander has
become so accustomed lately to jeopardy, that smooth water does not
offer sufficient excitement; though he should recollect that it has
been from his hugging the old Whig shore, and being reluctant to go
far enough out, that he has already endangered his vessel.
Dropping, nautical allegory, we must express our sincere regret at
the miserable precedent LoRD JoHN RussELL has afforded for the
future stoppage of the business of Government, by suspending it until
an adverse motion—which is not to come on for º fortnight—
has been disposed of. According to this principle, it would only be
necessary for a member to give notice of a vote of censure, at t
months’ date, in order to put a stop, for three months, to every
measure of the Government. If a Ministry will do nothing while it has
a vote of censure hanging over it, nothing will be easier than to keep
such a bugbear j, suspended over the heads of the Govern-
ment; when, if all Premiers are like LoRD JoHN Russe
present extraordinary mood, no business whatever will

THE POPE, OR A JEW’S RIBS.
ABOUT, the same time that, a Jew, tied upon a horse, was wont to
be hunted and pelted by faithful Catholics at Rome; about that, very
time a Jew was hustled and beaten by British Catholics in London-
by Catholics gathered together at the Freemasons' Tavern, to protest
before the world their toleration, their meekness, their Christian
love for all men, together with their sorrow that Protestant England
—with, Wise MAN in Golden Square—should somewhat doubt, such
benevolent qualities. Louis KYEzoR, a Jew, begs to put a question to
the meeting, as to the amount of tolerance awarded by the Pope to
people of the Judaical faith in Rome; and the enlightened Catholics
give a practical answer to the pestilent unbeliever, by turning him,
with brotherly violence, and tolerant blows in the ribs, from the room.
“I beg to state [writes Louis KYEzor], that before I got through the crowd of Irish-
men, I received a most violent blow in my ribs, from which I am in great pain at the
present time. This is a specimen of Catholic benevolence towards those who differ in
opinion from them.”
A very correct specimen, MR. KYEzoR. It is not much, certainly,
considering what ë. have perpetrated upon the Hebrew body;
but it is, at least, as much as they are permitted to do up to the present
time—and they do it.
It would be something more racy to make Louis KYEzoR wear a
yellow hat, instead of the undistinguished black chimney-pot borne
alike by Jews, Catholics, and Protestants. It would be even more
gratifying to make Louis KYEzoR sit, once a year, in a Catholic
church to hear mass, as at Rome. . It might, on a strong occasion, be
savoury to the nostrils of the true faith to roast the aforesaid KYEzoR,
as Jews and Christians have been roasted, in this world, to purify them
for the next; but, as this is not to be done at present, why KYEzoR
shall be hustled and buffeted by Catholic, gentlemen, carrying home
with him, for the sympathy, and, it is to be hoped, the instruction of his
family, “a most violent ū. in his ribs.” hen a whole man is not
to be crushed, the instalment of a rib is something. Will,CARDINAL

THE PROTOTYPE OF A CERTAIN PERSON.
HE Quarterly Review describes the personal
appearance of that celebrated Athenian philo-
sopher, SockATEs. From this º We
subjoin some extracts—interlarded only with a
few remarks—which, however, would doubtless
occur spontaneously to many minds. Our con-
temporary says:—
“Could we transport ourselves back to the Athenian
market-place during the Peloponnesian war, we should
\ at once recognise one familiar figure standing with uplifted
finger and animated gesture, amidst a group of handsome
youths, or aged sophists, eager to hear, to learn, or to
/ refute.”
Such a figure as may be at this moment
imagined in Smithfield Market-place, urging the
removal of the same, amidst a group of pretty
fellows—consisting of meat-salesmen * pub-
licans—or aged sophists, in the shape of ve-
nerable Aldermen, more anxious, however, to
refute than either to learn or hear:—
“We should see the SILENUs features of that memorable
countenance—the flat nose, the thick lips, the prominent eyes—the mark of a thou-
sand jests from friends and foes.”
Quite a daguerreotype—this—of the SocRATIC “mug.”—except as to
the handle. Liberties were taken with SocBATEs’s nose by the sculptors.
It was really an ample and magnificent aquiline; but the rogues flat-
tened it to vex the sage, who contented himself with calmly turning up
the misrepresented feature.
“We should laugh at the protuberance of the FALSTAFF stomach, which no necessary
hardships, no voluntary exercise could bring down.”
All this is quite correct. SoºHATEs, like somebody living, who shall
be nameless, had nearly as much stomach as brain.
“We should perceive the strong-built frame, the full development of health' and
strength, which never sickened in the winter campaign of Potidaea, nor yet in the long
plague and stifling heats of the blockade of Athens.”
Perfectly true: and all so much evidence of a vigorous circulation.
“The strong common sense, the humour, the courage of the man were conspicuous on
his first appearance.”
The fidelity of this part of the portrait will be also recognised—at
least by every acquaintance of Mr. Punch.
“And every one knows the story of the physiognomist, who detected in his features
the traces of that fiery temper, which, for the most part, he kept under severe control,
but which, when it did break loose, is described by those who witnessed it as absolutely
terrible.”
Just so placid is the temper in general—just so tremendous is the
ire when aroused—of that philosopher and humourist who is the onl
acknowledged representative of the Athenian Sage. The gº
reviewer—who perhaps may not be aware of the parallel now alluded
to–has omitted to mention the hunch of SockATEs, and the cudgel that
he used to carry about with him, for the purpose of convincing those
who were invincible by reason.

THE LORDS OF THE COMMONS.
SPEAKING at the Protestant-Subjugation Meeting, at the Freemasons'
Tavern, MR. MooRE, M.P., is reported to have given utterance to
the fine language subjoined:–
“The quivering viper of a bill lying at their feet might hardly be thought worthy of
another blow of the hatchet, if they did not know that the scotched snake was not
always killed.”
..Irished, if you please; not Scotched, MR. MooRE. The Anti-Papal
bill-if that is what you mean by your snake—has been Irished: so has
the English people, MR. MooRE; but Irished is not being killed, any

EMPLOYMENT FOR CAPITAL,
WHO will venture to assert that there is in these days no employ-
ment for capital? Every day's advertisements in the Times will assure
us that if capital were fifty times as abundant as it is, there are plenty
of enterprising people not only ready and willing, but anxious to make
use of it. few specimens, taken at random from the paper of
Tuesday, the 11th, will suffice to show how easily money may be laid
out by those who, being possessed of it, don't know exactly what to do
with it. To take the first specimen that offers. Here is a tit-bit of
temptation:—
APITAL –Any Gentleman having £1000 or £2000 to dispose of, may
employ it most advantageously, without any risk. Address to —
The ºptional nature of the amount is beautifully adapted to, the
money-dispensing capacity, which has been judiciously consulted, in
this instance, by leaving a large margin between the maximum and
minimum of the amount required. The money is to be employed “most
...}. No doubt of it; for though it is not said where the
fall, it is impossible that one or two thousand pounds
can be employed without again to somebody. -
The next specimen is neat in its terms, and moderate in its pre-
tensions, though sufficiently large and liberalin its promises:-
DVANTAGEOUS.—WANTED, a GENTLEMAN, having at his imme-
diate disposal £40 or £50, to join the advertiser in a very lucrative profession, where
there are no risks. Address in the first instance by letter only to
We should like to know this “lucrative profession,” where there are
“no risks,” and out of which enough for two may be got, by the invest-
ment of £40 or £50 of ready money. , Who can dare to say that the
professions are all overstocked, when here is a profession waiting to be
jumped into by anybody with a couple of twenty-pound notes in his
pocket? “No risks,” too ! Of this we have no doubt. It is a matter
of certainty, we dare say; but what may be, the certain result we
forbear to speculate; for in respect to this advertisement we are not
prepared to go into speculation of any kind.
Opportunity.” No. 3 is offered to rather extended competition, for
it embraces, and is ready to take in, Solicitors as well as ordin
Capitalists. Here it is:—
O SOLICITORS and CAPITALISTS. A Gentleman, constantly in
WANT OF LOANS, for long and short periods, wishes to meet with Capitalists
ready to make advances on the same. Address to ——
We should like to see in the approaching Exhibition the “portrait of
a gentleman, constantly in want of loans, for long and short periods.”
Surely here is an opportunity for the artist, as well as for the man of
capital; a subject on which not only the latter may º his pen in
drawing a check, but on, which the former may use his pencil in a
species of drawing altogether different. The “constant want of loans.”
might be shown by the “hard lines” visible in the face, and the “wish
to meet with capitalists ready to make advances” might be expressed
by what SHAKESPEARE calls an “inviting eye,” not likely to repel
advances of any kind. We do not think it necessary to proceed further
with our proof of the fallacy of the cry that there is “no employment
for capital.” We hear, now and then, of a glut of money—a repletion
—a stagnancy, of coin in the very arteries of commerce; but how can
this repletion last for a single day, when there is a bleeding apparatus
and a choice of operators, constantly offered in continuous streams of
advertisements P

unfavourable to the development of the organ of humour, may be con-
sidered to have achieved a remarkable success in the following jeu-de-

extreme fragility requires tender treatment. Here it is :—The Door-

THE SAINTS OF OLD.
(That is, of the Dark Ages.) A CHANT For THE TIMEs.
THE Saints of old were queer old fellows, used to live in caves and cells,
And lº if true their legends tell us, rather more like Guys than
swells;
Next to their skin, not very clean, they mostly wore a horsehair shirt,
And over that a gaberdine, both regularly steeped in dirt.
j the cock-bird is the gander, and the goose the gander's hen;
And these, my bucks, were your holy men!
A knotted rope the waist around, these fogies did for girdle wear,
And had their feet with sandals bound, or otherwise º bare;
About their heads there used to play a curious shiny kind of thing,
Which is.pºrtrait. doth convey a like idea to SATURN's Ring.
Ing, &C
The rope that round their loins was twisted, served them, too, them-
selves to flog,
As they did daily, and desisted all but quite from drink and prog;
For Paradise they thought to merit, through the frame's attenuation,
And He gº. ºitude inherit by diurnal flagellation.
ling, &C.
In repudiating lather, scorning water, shunning soap,
Did your pattern saintly Father, also put his trust and hope;
Domesticities he hated, counting wedlock as disgrace,
Which º imitated, soon would end the human race.
ling, &C.
On their chins saints mourished bristles, but theyoften shaved their heads;
Used to sleep on thorns and thistles, or of nettles made their beds;
Or else would pass the § in kneeling upon bare flint-stones,
O'er and o'er * reciting gibberish on their marrow-bones.
Sing, &c.
Some would fix their habitation on a pillar in the air,
Just like LORD NELson's situation in our own Trafalgar Square;
From cold and wet without protection would through pious postures go,
And with many a genuflexion edify the crowd below.
Sing, &c.
Talk of Jumpers, talk of Shakers, and their antics queer and quaint!
They are all nothing; none but fakirs can approach your ancient Saint.
Thus he lived without a neighbour, or a soul to love or please,
Working §: º: giving i. only to industrious fleas.
ling, &C.
Now he lay in trances snoring—now his occupation dull
Was to sit intently poring on an image or a skull; -
With these employmentsinterfered the Fiend, withimps in variousshapes,
Who, to . . Saint, appeared as dragons, owls, wild beasts, and apes.
Ing, &C.
The º sometimes, like a badger, drew the Saint from out his lair,
And made, by force, the sordid cadger to ascend a bishop's chair.
At ancient pictures if you look, you’ll see him with his neck awry,
Holding . his wrists a crook, and doing miracles thereby.
ling, &C.
In odour styled of sanctity his Saintship finished his career,
A perfume which, decidedly, Saints' habits must have render'd queer.
His relics—nails—teeth—or coccygis—served to cure all kinds of ills,
As *g. to state obliges—as our Universal Pills.
Ing, &C.
Now to the Saints' mirific ashes, and their memory, peace we wish.
They sometimes, scribes whom nought abashes telſus, preached to birds
and Ilsh ;
If everybody had their wishes, once again would faith prevail
In such º * and birds and fishes, all so very like a whale!
Ing, &C.
A Kaffir Prophet.
The Kaffirs, it seems, keep a prophet—one UMLANGENI-and he pre:
dicted that the English would be, turned into cattle—the trees would
become Kaffirs—and the British bullets would be melted into water.
Now Punch predicts that, like an animal of burden, JoHN, BULL at
home will bear the weight of the war; and that for every bullet fired,
there will be paid at least an ounce of tax raised gold.
The Great Finish of Art.
THE excuse that Government makes, about taking forty years in
issuing a war medal, is, that they do not like to send out an imperfect
thing. They are determined that each medal,shall be the most finished
thing of its kind—only we are afraid they will carry the finish to such a
tremendous extreme, that, when really finished, there will not be a
survivor left to admire it!

ATTEMPTs are again º to “develope the
resources” of out favourite little “loop” line
—the loop in question consisting of i. about
rope enough to enable the concern to bang itself
up, until further notice. A kind of excitement
is being got up about the Exhibition, which,
it is thought, may be the cause of a sort of
hectic and feverish communication between the
Scrubs at Wormwood and the Canal in Warwick
Square—an event which would stimulate the line
into a state of unwonted but much wanted
activity. At present, we regret to say the report
is not encouraging. The “permanent wº ” is
a bad way for the shareholders, and the “plant”
has been neglected for the cultivation of cabbage
plants on each side of the property. In con-
sequence of the refusal of the Great Western

that head shows only a “dot and carry none,”
there being, unfortunately, none to carry.
Food for Comment.
A LEEDs Paper states that a Board of Guar-
dians in the neighbourhood has adopted the
practice of “feeding the paupers at a mess-trough
six at a time,” in consequence of the damage done
to the saucepans. There is something rather re-
volting to English notions in the idea of feeding
human beings out of a trough; and though it is an
arrangement that might possibly please the pigs,”
it is, in our opinion, going a great deal too much
“the whole hog” in the way of economy. We are has lately advertised some port

REMARKABLE DISCOVERY IN CHEMISTRY
BY THE APOTHECARIES COMPANY.
THE Society of Apothecaries is rumoured to have made a great dis-
covery in science, the only discovery of the kind it has made, that was
ever heard of. -
The bulk of mankind may require to be informed that the Apothe-
caries’ Society is one of the smaller City ‘. to none of which,
however, is it second in that singular attachment to vested interests,
which entitles it to rank with Smithfield, and other wonderful insti-
tutions of the Metropolis. -
Yet the Company of Apothecaries ought to be a scientific body.
Originally established to i. the public with genuine draughts and
other medicines, it has also been chartered, by a freak of Legislation,
to #. the community with medical men. In 1815 the Perfection
of Human, Reason invested it with sole authority to regulate the pro-
fessional education of general practitioners—the physicians of the people
at large. From that time to this it has continued to prescribe medical
studies—and to put up prescriptions. In its commercial dealings the
Worshipful Society is unimpeachable; its medicines are first-rate, and
its pepper may be recommended; but its educational arrangements are
considered rather inferior, and by no means so good, or so reasonable,
as its drugs and spices.
The Apothecaries' Company has a vast opinion of Chemistry;
although its members, for the most part, have distinguished themselves
rather as druggists than chemists. it has decreed that chemical
lectures shall form part of the education of every candidate for its
license. Attendance on the instructions of any competent lecturer, one
might suppose, would satisfy this requirement. Not so. Their Worships
of Apothecaries' Hall still, refuse to recognise the lectures of any pro:
vincial Professor, although his chemical reputation, which is vouched
for by chemists of the greatest eminence throughout Europe, including
BRANDE, BERzELIUs, and LIEBIG, may be said to be at least European.
And why cannot Apothecaries' Hall acknowledge the teaching of gen:
tlemen, recognised by the London University, and the Colleges of
Physicians and Surgeons?—bodies surely as well qualified to judge in
the case as the medicine-venders who keep the shop at the upper end
of Union Street. But the men of senna have made a bye-law, which
denies recognition to any chemical lecturer, unless he lectures in con-
nexion with a regular medical school. As if any competent lecturer
could lecture otherwise. As though there were any science of chemistry
but one, which is connected with every medical school, and the Apothe-
caries' Company did not know that, and had worked so long at the
pestle and mortar as to have brayed themselves into downright asses.
But, then, their Worships allege, that their regulation is one of long
standing, and that, therefore, they cannot rescind it; a sort of con-
servative logic, that in this instance a punster might describe as senna-
torial. In the meantime they have rescinded this sage regulation in
favour of the Royal Institution.
The truth is supposed to be, that they have discovered an extra:
ordinary chemical fact; namely, that there is a principle in the air of
London, essential to the study of that very science, by which alone any
sort of air can be ..". that is, essential to the pursuit of Chemistry
itself—as understood by the Worshipful Company. They appear to
have wished to keep this mystery to themselves—as the first persons
who knew of phosphorus endeavoured to hold that discovery secret:
however, it has oozed out.
London air has been generally supposed to differ from the air of other
places, by containing, in addition to the main constituents of the atmo-
*. a somewhat larger proportion of carbonic acid and other gases,
the products of combustion and putrefaction; also of aqueous vapour,
and free carbon in the form of smoke: with which last substance the
Apothecaries’ discovery has been thought identical.
It is, however, believed to have been ascertained by the Apothecaries'
Company, that the metropolitan atmosphere, especially in and about the
hospitals and medical schools, contains an element which brings into
play certain delicate affinities, unscientifically termed mutual interests,
rendering it impracticable to allow students to learn Chemistry—or, at
least, spend their money in so doing—elsewhere than at those partic
establishments. This element, or principle, is of a very subtle nature.
It is termed aurine—whether from aura, a current of air, or aurum,
another description of currency, let etymologists determine. ... The
Apothecaries are said to have made this discovery of theirs whilst in
pursuit of the philosopher's stone—the prime object of their philo-
sophical researches.
ut for this peculiarity in the air of London, a medical student
might learn his 8. whether at Liverpool or elsewhere, before
coming to town, instead of having to cram it, together with half-a-dozen
other sciences besides, during the short time of his attendance at the
hospitals, which ought to be devoted as much as possible to the prac-
tical study of his profession. It is almost a Fº therefore, that the
Apothecaries ever made this discovery, or, that, having made it, they
should have applied it in regulating medical studies, or, indeed, that
they continue to meddle with those studies at all, and do not confine
themselves to pharmacy and grocery.

THE GREAT RIVAL to THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
WE suppose that until a charge from the Bishop suggests the
abolition of the charge of two-pence at the door of St. Paul's, we must
look upon the latter as one of the numerous rivals, to the Great Exhi-
bition. It is not, we believe, the intention of the managers of the show
at the Crystal Palace to throw the first stone—for those who live in
glass houses will naturally shrink from the process—but we do not see
why St. Paul's should not go into the competition with spirit, and issue
a sort of programme of prices, suited to the extraordinary occasion upon
which we are entering. Perhaps the following may offer an acceptable
hint to the proper authorities:– -
GRAND EXELIBITION.—ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.
The managers of this Great National Exhibition have the honour to
announce that, during the great season of 1851, season-tickets will be
issued for ladies and gentlemen. The charges will be as follow:—
Season-tickct for a Gentleman - - - . 58.
Season-ticket for a Lady . - . . 28.
The tickets will not be transferable, but will entitle the owner to
ission whenever the Cathedral is open. The managers hope that
this reasonable scale of prices will be found satisfactory to their kind
friends, the public. -
On the first of May, in consequence of the many rival exhibitions,
including the gratuitous out-door one of Jack-in-the-Green, which it is
naturally expected might diminish the receipts at the Cathedral, no money
will be taken at the doors, but on the second and third the entrance
will be two-pence, as usual. On the fourth day of Exhibition the price
will be one penny, to be reduced, on the twenty-second day, to one
half-penny, at which it will remain till the rival exhibition closes. It is
in contemplation to make arrangements for the reception of families, at
the rate .# a penny a lot all round, taking the big with the little. No
change will be given at the doors, notwithstanding the hints in various
quarters that some very great change is required.
Should experience show that any alterations are expedient, the
managers reserve the right of indulging in any eccentricity that may
occur to them. - -
- º WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS COMING TO.
If much more of the time of the nation is wasted, the Session of
Parliament will dwindle down to a Quarter Session.

THE ONLY PARTY LEFT. |
WE all recollect the Lament of DisBAELI over the abolition of
Parties. We know many persons who attribute the incompetency of
the present House of Commons to the same cause. We think these
complaints are all unfounded, for if the Whig Party and the Tory Party
are both defunct, there is, at all events, one Party left, and, far from
being a weak Party, it is a very numerous, one, and so strongly bound
in one common interest together, that nothing has yet j to
shake it. The Party we mean is always too happy to lend its services to
the Government, and it is so stanch and true, that there is not an instance
recorded anywhere of its ever.deserting it. It is not a very talented
Party, but it makes up, in numbers what it wants in intellect. The
Party we allude to is the Family Party of the ELLIoTTs, who should
make the heart of MR. DISRAELI, and other mourners, rejoice that there
is still one Party left in the House of Commons! . What cares England
for Whig or Tory, or any other Party, as long as it can boast of its
Family Party of the ELLIoTTs? |
F- - |
A Distinguished Light of the Established Church. |
MR. BENNETT denies many of the Puseyite practices with which he
has been charged by the Bishop of LoNDoN. According to this, we
suppose, the fact of his lighting up the altar of St. Barnabas, every |
Sunday, in such a flaming manner, must only be looked upon as a small
piece of the Bishop's candle (scandal).
QUESTION AND ANSWER. |
WHAT is a Public Impost P -
Why, in certain cases, like the Income-Tax, it is not going too far to
call such a Public Impost a Public Imposture' -
No Medal Without a Reverse
A poor Veteran was inquiring at the Horse Guards for a Peninsular
Medal, to which he was entitled. “I tell you, again,” was the satis-
factory answer he received, “the medal’s not finished. You forget it
takes thirty years to make a die.” “So it seems,” said the Veteran, as he
walked away, “for I believe I’m about the only one now living.”

EAR Mr. Punch...I
hope that the little
anecdotes connected
with the Roman Catho-
lic Church, which have
of late been occupying
a good deal of public
making some folks an-
, will not tend to
isturb your own se-
rene judgment and
temper.
“What has hap-
pened? A young lady,
twenty years of age, a
ward of Chancery, with
eighty thousand pounds
for #: fortune, has
been for education to a
convent at Taunton,

her residence there, has
been so charmed and
edified by the conven-
tual life, that it is said
she feels inclined to
adopt it altogether ;
and, taking the Church
- for her bridegroom,
will possibly endow her mystic spouse with her eighty thousand pounds.
“Has she not a perfect right to do as she likes with her own? If she were poor, would
there be any great outcry made? Has she not a right, to her opinions and convictions?
Suppose that she likes better to get up to chapel at 3 o'clock in the morning, than to dance
K. at that hour in Belgrave Square f, Suppose she is of opinion that that retreat at
aunton is far nearer heaven than any residence in London could be; and prefers a spiritual
to a step-father—how are you to prevent her from having her way? -
“You have no more right to force her to eat beef on a Friday, than to compel me to dine
on a slice of bread and a carrot. It is a question of tastes which ought surely to be left open
in a free country. - -
“And, where there is liberty of opinion there must of course be expression of it.
Everybody, who speaks, proselytises more or less. You engage to make converts, just as
much as His Eminence or dear FATHER Holdstock—and as his reverence excites by hope

or terror, and says to his faithful, My beloved son or daughter, if you do so and so, you w
be assured of so and so; and if you don't do so and so, you will be pretty certain to go
to, &c.—so, you on your side, flout and scout, and scorn and fling ridicule on Holdstock
and Nicholas, and all black friars and white, blue friars and gray,+their preternatural
pretensions, the miracles which the poor creatures are compelled to swallow, the very moralit
which they, inculcate, as odious, foolish, debasing, unmanly. I have been in a convent myself
—perhaps in that very one of Taunton. I believe on my word, and conscience that if that
system, is virtuous, Sutteeism in India is virtuous: I believe if those twenty-four ladies were
married to twenty-four railway navvies, they would be better employed than they are in
their present business. I believe that many of the duties which occupy them, and in which
the, pºor souls, are taught to take a pride, are meaner and more frivolous than waltzing
with the dullest dandies in * Fair-that the scheme of life held up to them as the highest
and most virtuous of which human creatures are capable, is º more nor less than
despicable and shameful, and scorn the doctrine and the doctors inasmuch as they preach
it. We ºf: at the Doctors then: and they pity us, and send us—you know where. The
can't do otherwise, and we are perfectly content. Sir, they are all alike. Disagree wit
FATHER ATHANAsius or JACK THE COBBLER, who is bawling on the common, and he can
§onothing, but consign you to the deuce. As far as he stands there, and to the best of his
belief, he is the administrator of your ultimate happiness or perdition. Bawl on, Jack
THE COBBLER; curse away, FATHER ATHANAsius ! §. us and each other. You believe
yourselves right; and if you are right, we are done for. Show us that you are right, one or
the other of you, and the rest follows as a matter of course. But, holding your premises to
be as absurd and monstrous, as their consequences would be, I, for my part, take leave
utterly to deny one and the other.
“But, give clerical gentlemen fair-play. If I don't believe that FATHER ATHANASIUs
can absolve me, or the contrary; or decline to adopt the views of JACK THE º
has pretty much the same pretensions, at least those divines have as good a right to be heard
as wº; and conclusions and consequences must come out of their opinions as out of all others.
‘If, for instance, a young lady is of opinion that Father ATHANAsius is invested with
ſº to curse or bless her into eternity; is the holder of an absolute truth of which
e is the authorised and heaven-transmitted expounder; and if the Father says, “My dear,
for the good of your soul, and the benefit of the Church, you had much better take the habit
of a nun, and pay over that matter of eighty, thousand pounds, which can be of no use to
you;’ of course she has a right to follow #. ictates of her conscience, and the keeper of her
conscience; and you and I have no right to object to the disposal of her money.
Take the other case again, about which there has been such a brawl and talk in the
Vice-Chancellor's Court. An old French refugee and miser, who has scraped together
ten thousand pounds, is on his death-bed in Somers Town. Shivering and starving on the
attention, and which
have had the effect of
and, in the course of
brink of the grave, and without the heart to -
spend a shilling for a º of wine to warm his
wretched carcase—his landlord finds the Roman
Catholic Clergyman of the district, and, of course,
brings him to administer consolation to the dying
old wretch.
“Enemies may say that the old man, drivellin
|and trembling in the grasp of death, might fa
ºn easy victim to an interested person disposed
to exaggerate the terrors ... already were
agitating him; and take advantage of the weak-
ness which had stretched him on his miserable
couch. What does the REVEREND MR. Hold-

to good works—for what better work, than
ſºlariº What cause, more...sacred than that of
education? Those dear little girls of Saint
Aloys’ School want spelling-books and samplers;
and if the old miser, by screwing, by French
lessons, by whatever means, has amassed a sum
of money which he can’t take away with him to
the place whither he is going, let him give seven
thousand to the school, an he will bºno worse
for the donation.
| The Catholics like pictures, and admit them
as incitements of devotion. Here’s a nice subject
ſor a pious artist.! Let it hang up in the school
amongst the little children—the miser dying on
his miserable pallet—his wretched life flickering
out—prostrate by ghastly terrors, by accumulated
|Femorse, by mental and bodily weakness, and
|imbecility—and the priest and the priest's friend,
the barrister, hanging over him, and getting the
donation from the almost corpse-look up at
that, little girls! Count your little beads; sing
your little song in chorus for the repose of the
soul of the late MonsLEUR CARR£ !
“It is true that CARRE, for this pious purpose,
#. his money away from his family; but what
oes this prove P Does this not prove how
good an Englishman FATHER Holdstock is, in
reply to those wicked assertions that the Roman
Catholic Ecclesiastics are subjects of a foreign
power? CARRE's relations are Frenchmen. He
made his money in this country. ...Why should it
o out of this country?. He lived in Somers
own; let his piety enrich the suburb in which
ill|he practised the virtues of economy. If he had
not lived so avariciously as he did, he could not
have saved at his trade more than three thousand
pounds. Let his family have that. A soul is
saved; a school is built and improved, by which
thousands of souls more are probably succoured.
And I, for my part, say that H. HoLDSTock
performed A Good MoRNING's work.
“And this testimony which I give, is at least
impartial. I no more believe that the Pope of
RomE or any officer of his has power to save
(or the contrary) * soul, than that the beadle
of St. James's can do so: I have a right to my
opinion, and to publish it too; and so repeat
that the REVEREND MR. Holdstock did a good
morning's business. A coup of seven thousand
pounds in the course of a forenoon's conversation
is very seldom made; and many a clergyman has
passed six hours in taking a confession not
3. twopence-halfpenny. MR., Holpstock
would, no doubt, and has done; and would give
his ear to the fetid breath of a beggar dying of
|typhus, as readily as listen to the last quivering
#. of a perishing miser.
“And if clergymen of his persuasion have a
persuasion of their own so marvellous, that they
can alienate young girls from the world, sisters
|ſº sisters, dying old men yearning for their
|relatives from their natural affections, and the
| ordinary proofs of them—if they can get Miss
TALBot's money to build a cathedral, or CARRé's
to found a school—if they can enter families, close
doors and hold secret councils, remit, confirm,
soothe, terrify, divide, govern—what call have we
to complain? If Catholic families choose to sub-
mit to this, how can we help it, or how interfere?

and mount the steps? And as a young English, lady all but a minor,
imaginative, beautiful, tender in years and intellect, attended by the
devout and influential, friends of her family, by pious relatives, by a
crowd of priests, with shaven polls, singing round about her, and
pointing out the joys of heaven to her, has a Fº right to mount
those steps, and disappear from the world—why is a lady in Bengal
to be prevented from joining her spouse, whom her relations, the
practice of the country, and the advice of the most eminent fakeers
and Brahmins of her church, concur to press upon her?”
“AN OPPRESSED HINDoo.”
PUNCH AT THE PLAY-A LESSON FOR MANAGERS,
ºm Q wo or three weeks , Mr.
N. Punch paid a º state
| —his usual happy state—to
Drury Lane Theatre. He
was received at the door by
an enormous crowd of ladies
and gentlemen in waiting,
all of them wearing their
orders, and who seemed to
be rather more free than
| welcome. On reaching the
| top of the staircase, Mr.
| Punch was met by the clerk
of the check, to whom
he handed the customary
| counter of copper, humming
Al idea di quel metallo, as
| pºsed into the corri-
| The usual freemasonry of
|S| putting the hand to the
S. pocket being here gone
through by Mr. Punch, and
understood by the box-
keeper, that acute func-
tionary discovered he had
“one vacant seat on a front
row,” to which the distin-
guished visitor was ushered,
as the orchestra commenced
the º Chinese overture to the beautiful British comedy of
Simpson Co.
* In due time the curtain rose, discovering the hero of five hundred
melo-dramas, and the “light comedian” of upwards of a quarter of a
century. Nevertheless, theatrical youth, like forensic wisdom, is often
in the wig, and the venerable “young dog” of the old .* farces,
by the aid of the “real gentleman's head of hair,” looked as jetty as
JETTY TREFFz, if not º: as juvenile.
The acting was of the school called “mellow,” but a performer,
like a , cannot, unfortunately, preserve for ever, the happy medium
ofmeiſowness." There were aliihe old points, but the public cannot be
poked in the ribs for thirty years by precisely the same points, without
the said points getting somewhat flattened. After the appearance of
the BRoxſley of the night, which gave some idea of the strength of the
Co., expectation ... for the SIMPson. The actor is of high pro-
vincial repute, and brings with him to London the traditions handed
down from London, thirty years ago, as to the dressing of that re-
spectable old stage nuisance, the “British Merchant.”
The dramatic representative of Commerce has ever been clothed in a
costume, that, in real life in the City, would attract towards the
merchant a large circle of those rum, but unprofitable customers, the
“boys.” They could not be expected to witness unmoved the advent of
one, who, decked nearly entirelyin buff, would seem to invite the appella-
tion of “old buffer.” The acting of this part was more than respectable,
and if the actor had been brought to jº. to show his talents in
amusing novelties, instead of in the worn-out productions of the past age,
we might have been able to congratulate the performer and the metro-
politan public on their having made each other's acquaintance.
Ever gallant to the fair sex, Mr. Punch has nothing but compliments
for the ladies, particularising, however, the sensible expounder of MRs.
BROMLEY's sentiments, and the pretty and promising representative
of the unconscious mischief-maker, MRs. FitzALLAN.
Mr. Punch was, it is true, a little startled at seeing MADAME LA
TRAPPE enter a room in Mincing Lame—there the scene is laid—
having come through the thick of the City, in the middle of the day,
in a white muslin dress, without a bonnet, but a wreath of green on her
head, and with an arrangement of ribbons peculiar to the French
school-girl of the early part of the present century.
... The costume, under the circumstances, was *ś but perhaps
it was meant to be so; for, on the stage, effect is half the battle. For
the same reason, perhaps, the scene in Mi cing Lane was a room, with
French windows down to the ground, looking on to a garden, full of
flowers, and commanding a view of an extensive landscape. ferna
the room was at the top of the house in Mincing Lane; perhaps the
flower-garden was an ingenious arrangement on i. leads of adjoining
houses; and perhaps the landscape comprised our old friends the
“Surrey hills,” which the London lodging-house keepers, in a mythic
strain, frequently declare to be “wisible.”
To Mr. Punch, it must be confessed, this exhumation, as it were, of
the old dramas and old doings of the theatrical past, was a good deal
like the unrolling of a mummy. He stopped to see the spectacle of
Azael, which, as a spectacle, is excellent. Being good of its class, and
well done, the public saw it with pleasure; for merit of any kind is
appreciated. Everybody in the theatre had come to see the spectacle,
and everybody had come not to see the old worn-out comedy, with its
old worn-out acting, and its old worn-out, traditional, but most inap-
propriate, appointments and scenery. The evening's performance was
calculated to convey a lesson to managers; for, in the course of the
night, what to avoid, and what to do, were both exemplified. What a
pity it is that the former so often preponderates over the latter in the
modern system of management }. the way a new piece has since
been produced, under the title of a Morning Call, which is understood
to be well worthy of an evening call; and we intend, therefore, leaving
our card, at an early opportunity.
“HARPER CRIES,-"TIS TIME, TIS TIME!”
THE house of book-taker and bookseller HARPER, of New York, is a
house built of the skulls of English authors. Never did PHILIP, the
terrible red man, take so many scalps as, have fallen to the lot of the
Ex-Mayor of New York. He is a man all brains—the brains of other
people. HARPER makes his daily four meals off the bones of British
enmen. A joint of BULweR decks his breakfast-table; at luncheon he
has a snack of TENNYsoN ; at dinner, DICKENs and MACAULAY, with
MRs. SomeRVILLE and MRs. Howitt as side-dishes; and at supper-
for HARPER has a wondrous digestion—JAMEs and MRs. TROLLOPE.
Since the first book went to press, and the first bookseller was born of
that operation, no man has been known with the swallow of our New
York HARPER. Indeed, he can hardly be called so much a man—as a
safe, a brazen safe. And yet there are people, who, failing in admiration
of such a miracle of a being, put a knave's trick upon him. Advertise-
ments in the New York papers give evidence of this melancholy truth,
MR. Borrow has recently sent a night-mare to press under the title
of Lavengro. The house of PUTNAM had purchased an early and ex-
clusive copy of the book of its English publisher, MR. MURRAY-much
to the virious ire of the house of HARPER; that, nevertheless, set to
work in its own adroit and energetic way to obtain the sheets wet—the
wetter the better—from the press. A monster in the human form,
employed by MR. PUTNAM—with no touch of respect for the trading
enterprise of HARPER AND Co.—conveyed to those persevering men a
copy of Larengro; a copy which, in the guilelessness of their book-
nimming hearts, they believed to be perfect; and, so believing, set an
army of compositors to work, and produced their Lapengro at the same
moment—a double-birth—with the Lavengro of MR. PUTNAM' -
So far, so well, and we can see HARPER jocund and *...*.
his hands, and then twiddling sympathetically in his pocket—as his
face glows upon his own Lapengro. (SAwNEY BEAN must have smiled
in the same sweet, playful way upon the child set apart for his dinner.)
And now we see the HARPER jaw suddenly fall—and the HARPER orbs
flash fiercely, for HARPER reads an advertisement to the effect that his
—HARPER's Lavenpro–is an imperfect, a maimed, a crippled Lavengro.
And so it is. For the false man who conveyed the sheets had ordered
the press accordingly—had omitted some four or five pages, filling them
up with stars—malignant stars dropping grief and loss to HARPER-
and so his own Lavengro is a }.}}| ; to the exceeding wrath of
HARPER and the self-glorification of PUTNAM!
Poor HARPER! We would we had the instrument of HARPER
ORPHEUs to lament losses such as thine—oh, HARPER!—with harp not
“strung with golden-hair;” not strung with common cat-gut; but
with the literary heart-strings of scribbling Britishers'
“You must Translate, 'tis fit we Understand.”—Hamlet.
IN consequence of the anticipated influx of foreigners, preparations
are being made for translating everything into all languages, and the
great season of 1851 is to be known as the polyglot season in history.
Not only is every language to be spoken everywhere, but some of the
shopkeepers and others are understood to be making arrangements to
et their goods, as well as their words, translated into several tongues,
or the benefit of visitors from the continent. The sausage merchants
are preparing to get their German sausages translated into French, and
a dealer in sweet-stuff intends bringing out an English and Italian
version of his Spanish liquorice. French rolls are to be done into
Dutch; the Dutch ovens are to be translated into French, and a large
ironmonger has ordered a quantity of Italian irons in Dutch metal.

The Navy might be advantageously left to private speculation, which
would be certain to provide us with, a marine amply sufficient for all

altogether, and save all the expense of dock-yards and arsenals:
In like manner, we could quite do away with the War-Office; and
every sensible person must see that, unless we are to have efficient
national defences, we had better, have none at all; for an Army and
Navy which are not strong enough to repel invasion are of no manner
of use, and serve only to irritate foreigners by empty defiance, besides
being productive of *...*. expense.

The Walue of Character.
WE are afraid that character is rather at a discount just now, nor
can ability be worth much, if we are to judge of the value of both by the
following advertisement cut from a Scotch paper,
WANºp a person to train a Newfoundland Dog. None need apply whose ||
- ability and character will not bear the strictestinquiry. Apply.” &c. &c.
Character and ability would appear to be going to the dogs, if the -
above. announcement is any fair criterion of the sort of offices the
qualities in question are likely to command. Talent has often been|
sought to conduct the education of a "young puppy,” but the animal
has been of a different breed, and the idea of advertising for a man of
“character” and “ability” to bring up a Newfoundland Dog, is,
therefore, a novel one.

SAWE US FROM OUR FRIENDS.
THIS is just now the cry among all the London householders, who are
receiving by every post threats of invasion from relations of every kind
both near and distant; the latter lamenting, and offering to put an end
to the distance that has hitherto divided them. Every one in town who
has ever, by the slightest accident, or in the very commonest civility,
said to any one in the country, “I shall be happy to see you in London,”
is getting notes from all quarters “accepting his friendly invitation,”
“taking advantage of his polite offer,” and stating that “the approach.
ing Exhibition offers a fitting opportunity for cementing that friendship
which circumstances alone have hitherto prevented from becoming
intimate.” As for ourselves, we are so overrun with “acceptances,”
that we, who never failed to meet an acceptance of any kind, are puzzled
how to accºmmodate the thousands who have promised to come and
take a bed for a few mights at our Office, at 85, Fleet Street. We can
only say, that our four posters—the four large bills outside our windows
—are at the service of any one who come; but Judy, with the family,
i. of course, Toby, will require all the accommodation of our
household.
We recommend those who do not wish to be overrun with country
cousins, to lose no time in getting up a coolness as quickly as possible,
and a few active mischief-makers might, for the first time in their lives,
be usefully employed in fomenting É.i. dissensions, calculated to last
until the Exhibition is over. There are many idle ladies of our ac-
uaintance, and everybody's acquaintance includes one or two of the
class, we dare say, who, being apparently fit for nothing else but back-
biting, may have full scope in the present season for their amiable pro-
pensities; since the setting of people together by the ears just now
may have the effect of keeping them apart to their mutual advantage.
“A house divided” is the sort of thing that will be required to
prevent, the London houses from getting too full, and there are plenty
of good-natured friends of both sexes who, we are sure, would be
only too glad to undertake the task of causing division everywhere
among familiar friends and acquaintances.
THE OPERATIC CAMPAIGN.
THE Operatic war has commenced between the two great powers,
and the season seems favourable to hostilities on both sides; for there
are more than ordinary spoils to be won; the field is larger than ever;
and the eyes of Europe will be literally on the spot, to look on the
spectacle, or series of spectacles, that will be offered to them. The
campaign has been opened by HER MAJEsty's forces having struck the
first blow, with decided effect, on Saturday last, while the Royal Italian
army waited a week before making its first decided movement. On
both sides there is a determined and well-disciplined band, under expe-
rienced leaders; and advantage has been taken of the interval between
last and the present year's campaign, to fortify the weak posts on both
sides. The contest will be one of unusual interest; and we shall
frequently visit the seat of war, provided we find the seat agreeable.
Angling Extraordinary.
LoRD PETER, a potentate of the angle—a fisherman of many years'
standing—has had an extraordinary “take.” It appears that the old
angler is a wonderful hand at hooking maids; and recently landed a
maid in his landing-net, weighing the extraordinary weight of eigh
thousand pounds. The maid is to be seen—if LoRD PETER so willed it
—at one of his English country-houses, near Taunton, What makes the
capture of the maid still more wonderful, is the fact that the Fisherman
threw for her in the deep and muddy waters of Chancery. His tackle
is said to be very curious: his line being a string of beads, and his bait
a bit of white muslin—very like a veil.

ALL GOING TO THE DOGS 1
EAR MR. PUNCH !—THE good
old times are departing indeed!
Here is a melancholy paragraph
for you, from the Morning
Post:-
“‘DANCING AT A DISCOUNT.-The
number who attended the Assize Ball
at York, on Monday Evening, was
nineteen!'
“Ah, Sir! I recollect the
day when an Assize Ball was a
gathering, or, in your finikin
phraseology, a réunion of all
the beauty and consequence
of the county. Then you used
to have generally half-a-dozen
fellows, at least, left for execution. But now, we are grown so tender,
that we can hardly bear to hang anybody, and so squeamish, I suppose,
that we conside it barbarity and bad taste to assemble and dance over
the condemnation of our fallen fellow-creatures, as they are termed, and
what is called the degradation of our common human nature. We are
fast losing that manly character, Mr. Punch, that distinguished this
nation in the palmy days of the stocks and the pillory, and bear and
bull-baiting, and of your humble servant, “PIGTAIL.”
dent's, dancing days are not over, what does he
ize Ball with a hornpipe in fetters?

say to opening an
IO BACCHE.
THE lovers of learned music, including our good-humoured friend of
the Musical World, seem disposed to make Io Bacche, or, Go it Bach,
the burden of many of their critical lucubrations. We cannot help
thinking, nevertheless, that the bit of Bach attempted a few nights
ago at St. Martin's Hall must have made the audience wish for
Baccho stoppers to put an end to the smoky, mystification that
#. to have been going on, if we are to put faith in a criticism that
fell under our eye on the morning following. The performance was a
tit-bit of B minor, “long contemplated by musicians with the greatest
reverence as a monument of scholarship and learning, but its excessive
º: and deficiency in popular traits have long confined it to the
Study.
By way of making this piece of confusion worse confounded, we are
told by a critic, (who, nevertheless, luxuriates in Bach, and would chew
his Bacche to the last in the most succulent and confiding spirit) that
“none of the executants displayed any sort of mastery over their duties,
the voices being, not seldom, completely abroad, occasioning a degree
of mystification and entanglement utterly, obliterating every vestige of
form and coherence.” A -
a pure and severe taste for music that may improve the public judg-
ment rather than tickle the public ear; confessing our respect for the
educated musicianship which can appreciate all the beauties of that
mysterious bunch of keys used for opening the portals of harmony;
feeling, as we really do, a sincere reverence towards those learne
critics who can mither us with their A sharps or E flats, and who can
ut a B natural in our bonnet that will drive us mad with its profound
Buzi, we, nevertheless, come to the conclusion, and we think the
intelligent heads of the Musical World will agree with us, that “ex-
cessive dryness,” destitute of all “popular traits,” executed by “voices
completely, abroad,” and “obliterating every vestige of form and
coherence,” cannot be the sort of food upon which to nourish the
musical taste of the public. It is really, very like giving, the classical
school of music a sort of Back-handed blow, to drag forth a misty and
musty composition from the study, and then do such execution upon it,
as was done lately at St. Martin's Hall upon poor Bach's B minor.
To M.P.'s.-MR. EDWARD BRAY, Polyphonist to the Zoological
Gardens, having, with some pain, observed the r and ineffectual
manner in which certain Members of the House of Commons, in certain
debates, imitate the crowing of cocks, the barking of dogs, and the
baa-ing of sheep, -
Begs, leave to state, that he is ready to give Lessons in any such
ºnent to any M.P. soever, who may honour him with his
patronage.
MR. BRAY's cockcrow has been considered more perfect than the
grow of the bird itself; whilst–so successful is his peculiar mode of
instruction—his imitation of the Donkey, as conferred upon his pupils,
Is ... worthy of the original animal.

itting as we do the propriety of cultivating |h
THE HOODED RAWEN.
THE French have a proverb–
“Qui veut tenir nette maison,
Qu'il n'y souffre ni prêtre, ni moin, nipigeon 1"
which may be roughly handled in English—
“They that would keep their houses chaste and meat,
From thence must priests, and nuns, and pigeons beat.”
But the pigeon is a clean and temperate bird—nay, a piece of inno-
cence, even when most rapacious and pugnacious, in comparison with
the household raven—the Household flooded Raven—a black, sly,
sinister .."; that of late hops, more frequently among us, setting its
churchyard look, and uttering its death croak in the chambers of the
sick and dying. It has been said that the raven was fast disappearing
from England; that, in a few years, it would join the stork and the ustard.
And behold ! What a flight of ravens–Ravens of the Hooded sort—
have descended upon us! And they glide along our streets, many of
them young birds, almost callow, hardly come to their full black; but
with an eye and beak that promise a keen and deadly look, an unfailing
and mortal stroke in the future.
But our present story is with an old bird—the Hooded Raven of
ST. ALOYSIUs. We all know what a daring, subtle thief is the Magpie.
Bits of family plate are of no account in its bill; but what are a few
forks, and spoons, with, it may be, a punch-ladle and a fish-slice, in
comparison with a “lift” of seven thousand pounds? Nevertheless,
the Raven, the Hooded Bird of ST. Aloysius, has been known to carry
off no less in its bill, flying direct with the plunder to the towers of his
Saint. Nothing less than a miracle could have given to a mere weak
raven the strength to bear away such a weight of gold; but when gold
is the matter in question, can a miracle be wanting?
The story needs AEsop, rather than Punch : however, thus it is.
There was an old, old jackdaw-fri htened years ago from France by
the noise of the cannon, and the filthy smell of gunpowder—an old
jackdaw, that, bit by bit, had got together an enormous hoard of coin:
And this jackdaw was a solitary bird, with a hatred in particular to all
hen-jackdaws. He loved nothing but his store, that, day by day, fº.
and grew—the jackdaw, the meanwhile, looking the meanest and the
most draggled jackdaw that ever ho ped or º Now, the jackdaw
grew old, and at last fell sick. And then, much pressed, he consented
that a lawyer should be brought to him, a learned Lapwing, with a
pen-feather in his head, to make his will. The Lapwing, possessed of
the knowledge of the hoard of the dying jackdaw, no doubt, affectionately
pondered the matter in his legal mind.
Now this Lapwing knew and reverenced the Hooded Raven that
dwelt in the towers of St. ALoysius. ...And upon certain information,
jº the Raven “ordered his wings” and betook himself to the
Jackdaw, that could not abide the sight of any Raven soever, and always
screamed at the Raven croak, defying and denouncing it. The poor
sick Jackdaw entreated all the birds about him to save him from the
approach of the Raven; and, honest souls l—they tried, with, all their
little might—but think ye that the Raven was to be put down º of
ouse-sparrows, tomtits, and small lay-birds of that sort P. Not he.
And so the Raven-working his hood in a terrible way—and uttering
his most frightful croak, cried—
“What's this? Poltroons—blackguards—sons of darkness-out of
the way with ye! Fly into holes and corners—melt through the earth
—for it’s I—I the Hooded Raven of ST.Aloysius, that come to brin
manna in my blessed bill to the dear, darling, suffering, penitent, dutif
Jackdaw. t out of that l”
And, with a flap of his wing, and a lunge of his bill, the Hooded
Raven bore down all before him; and in a trice was at the bed, of the
dying Jackdaw. And then didn't the Raven croak-and, didn't he
insist that the learned º: should not hop off—as indeed the
Lapwing wished—but that he should use his pen-feather according to
the commands of the Raven, and for the cause of St. ALoysius!
And the Jackdaw grew worse and worse. And the Hooded Raven
spread his black wings about and above the Jackdaw; and talked the
ackdaw's own French in a bad croak. And what was said, and what
was done, whilst the Raven so enveloped the Jackdaw, no other bird
could tell. But this is the end. The Hooded Raven carried off to the
towers of St. ALOYSIUs seven thousand pounds’ worth of gold from the
hoard of the dying Jackdaw—and the Jackdaw in a day or two died;
but the Hooded Raven never returned again. -
The old Jackdaw—as we have jº. all hen-jackdaws. Now
the towers of ST. ALOYSIUs were expressly built for the succour and
protection of little hen-jackdaws, mere nestlings; and the Jackdaw's
stores became the means of nurturing the creatures of his hate. A moral
this to all sordid Jackdaws.
Nevertheless, let us not fail to struggle, to work, and pray against
the visits of the Hooded Raven. Woe, woe to the land, where such a

STLENCE–PRAY SILENCE
"CowPLAINTs have reached us of a practice which has nearly reached
perfection—the perfection of impertinence—consisting of a habit among
certain stall-frequenters at the theatres, of making their own voices
heard above those of the dramatic company. It is true that it may be
sometimes charitable to drown the language of the stage, though it is
frequently in such a state of dilution, that it would be almost im-
possible to find anything less solid in which the drowning process
could be effected. If a person pays to go to a theatre, he is entitled to
hear what is said on the stage, even though he pays something extra in
the shape of a penalty for listening to uninteresting dialogue.
. It does happen, however, that there are good things produced occa-
sionally at all the theatres, and as it is to see these things that people
usually pay, we feel called upon to protest—on their behalf—against
interruptions, from habitués of the stalls who may happen to have
“heard it all before,” and to be blasé of everything. If these gentlemen
would postpone their conversation during the piece, and only talk by
way of entr’acte, their small-talk might perhaps be acceptable; but as
long as the old story of “one at a time” is remembered—we allude to
the incident of the donkey and the Mayor both trying to make them-
selves heard at once—there will be an objection to the simultaneous
talking on the stage and among the audience.
Political Chivalry.
A NEWSPAPER, that advocates unreasonable bread, calls LoRD
STANLEY “the noble and chivalrous leader of the Country party.”
Ghivalrous comes from cheval, a horse. What LoRD STANLEY has to
do with a horse, in a political sense, we do not know, except in as far
as, without disrespect, he may be called a clever jockey. As for Pro-
tection, it is merely his hobby.
ANOTHER RIVAL TO THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
ExTREMEs generally meet; and we are this year threatened with the
meeting in London of two very striking extremes, in the shape of the Exhi-
bition of Industry at the Crystal Palace, and the Exhibition of Idleness
at the Palace of Westminster. The contributors to the latter are nume-
rous, and the contributions somewhat curious... One of the first articles
sentin, and which has done so much towards the grand display of Idle-
ness, was an article of Woon, consisting of a cumbrous piece of obstruc-
tive machinery, called a Budget...This extraordinary piece of goods so
effectually blocked up the legislative way, that nothing could be done;
while LoRD JOHN RUSSELL has since contributed a measure or two-
which may be called measures of space, from their containing nothing
—and which have added materially to the great Parliamentary Exhibi-
tion of Idleness. It is expected that by the time our visitors arrive
from abroad, the º for doing nothing will be quite complete;
and if we are to take the past as a guide for the future, we may ealcu-
late on being able to show the world a display of the political far niente,
which is almost, if not quite, without precedent.
The Cold Water Cure for Wagrants.
At Wexford—says an Irish paper—they have gotrid of vagrants .
a simple process: twenty-four hours' imprisonment and a thorou
º: No beggar submitted twice to the cold water. It is an old
belief that Truth harbours in a well; and, it would seem that her sister
Charity—in her best moments—is to be found at a pump.
A_GLoRIous Bon FIRE-LoRD LANSDown E would be happy to see
the Income-Tax repealed, and then “he should be glad to move that
all the papers relating to it should be burnt.” The only mode, we take
it, in which an income-tax paper can appear light to anybody.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A (TOO) LATE
BARRISTER.
How I came to take, permanently, the equity side of my profession, I
can hardly tell; but let me º by the way, that profession and practice
do not always go together. Ithink I was ultimately lured to equity by
the terrible fascination of its ruinous costs; and I thought that, if
suitors were to be devoured, I might as well “grind their bonestomake
my bread,” as allow all the grist to go to the mill of others. My reading
had been happily mixed at the University, and combined a sort of
Oxford mixture, adapted rather to use than ornament. My intellectual
food had been varied by square roots; and over the most difficult cubes
I had often smoked my cheap Cuba. -
After taking my degree, I had sat down before the fire, with Coke
in my hand, and I soon became red-hot for my profession. In this
state I was ready for BURN’s, which threw me into a flame of forensic
ardour; and Cole. On Criminal Informations heaped fuel upon fire.
With an appetite thus whetted, by what was so essentially dry, I
devoured ºFEARNE’s Remainders; I swallowed the whole of the
Digests; I made short work of PETERspoRFF's Abridgement in fifteen
volumes, with its Supplement in five; I exhausted Jagoº's Fisheries at
a sitting; of which, in fact, I crammed to an extent of which Europe-
except, perhaps, some unfortunate Turkey in Europe on the approach of
Christmas—would fail to furnish a precedent. I was loaded to the very
muzzle with legal ammunition; and the great question had to be decided
—howſ should go off. - - -
Time, alas! has answered the question, by leaving me without enough
shot in my locker to buy powder for my wig. My professional career
has been a feeble flash in a broken pan. I have fizzed and fumed for a
brief period. Yet, though aiming, as it were, with the double-barrelled
arm of law and equity, I have, with both, missed the mark. . . .
But I am anticipating, which I ought not to do, for my anticipations
were always erroneous. Alas!—I remember how fancy—the ſº
distributor of offices to the non-official—the sovereign by whom all the
unacknowledged statesmen are being º sent for to form a
cabinet—I say, I remember how fancy entrusted my very infancy with
The woolsack was the blissful spot where I and my
imagination used to go woolgathering by the day, week, month, and
bject of my earliest, veneration... His
doubts inspired me with a sort º mystic awe; and when, after dallying
with a cause for hours, and pronouncing a judgment that wanted only
to be left alone by himself to make it a decision, he would express his
determination to “take the papers home,” I used to congratulate
myself on entering a profession that ought, indeed, to immortalise its
chiefs—if, at least, they are to have time to attend to it.
Before I proceed to tear out the leaves of my note-book, and expose
them to the public gaze, a process like that of “pinning my heart upon
my sleeve for daws to peck at.”—should they §: º, inclined—
before I draw the fearful picture of the ward in Chancery with the cruel
old guardy-in the shape of the CHANCELLOR-keeping everything,
and especially the property, under lock and key; before I draw the
picture of the Infant Suitor, creeping through the stages of infancy,
manhood, maturity, and decay, until with one ºf in the grave and the
other in the Court of Equity, he dies with bills of revivor on all sides of
him; before I proceed to these harrowing details, let me look around
me and describe what Chancery really is. Common Law being founded
on certain principles, it was perhaps thought that the law might get too
common, as well as too certain, and a system was required which would
revent law. from getting very vulgar or common, by making it extremely
ear, and disturb its monotonous certainty by rendering it as uncertain
as º There were also some cases that the law could not meet,
and, as in every case there must be some money to spend, it was thought
that the lawyers should have a chance of meeting it, and hence, perhaps,
we get the word Chancery.
The mode of proceeding in Chancery was always to begin by a bill—
and indeed the proceedings seem to have begun as they meant to go on,
for there were nothing but bills from the commencement to the close
of a suit in Chancery. The suitor asks for relief; and there is some-
thing facetious in the form of his demand; for he makes it in the
name of “Charity,” though the first taste he gets of the sort of charit
he may expect, is a heavy demand for fees, including one for counse
for putting his name on the bill, or signing the petition. From the
earliest times there was such an antipathy among defendants to be
brought into Chancery, that those who served the first process, used
often to get their bones broken, and might have returned nulla bona to
the writ; while, in the Time of Elizabeth, an officer was made to eat
it *-or, in other words to breakfast on a parchment roll—and as none
of the digests were then prepared, the work of digestion must have
been very difficult. To eat one's own words is unpleasant enough at
all times; but to eat somebody else's, written out on a stiff material,
including ink, must have been a materialink-onvenience.
If the defendant did not appear, he was supposed to treat the whole
affair with contempt, and he became the object of a series of attach-
ments, each attachment costing him so much, that he was in danger of
being, as it were, killed by kindness. If from age, imbecility, panic,
or any other cause, the defendant kept out of the way, he was
pronounced a “rebel” – a sort of Rob Roy, haunting the merry
greenwood of Whetstone Park, and other famous retreats in
which the intended victims of Chancery were accustomed to hide
themselves.
If the defendant had no interest in the matter, he might put in a
disclaimer, but he must pull out a ten-pound note, at least, to enable
him to put in anything. If he answers, he generally denies everythin
and asks for costs—a piece of disinterestedness that is as commonasi
is touching, for every suitor asks for costs, which, it is well known, go
into the pockets of the lawyers; and, therefore, it is a pleasing trait of
simplicity on the part of the clients who pray for them. One of the
most common answers to a Bill in Chancery is “want of parties,”
amounting to a request that some other persons should be joined in the
mess; for it is a natural feeling among mankind, when in a scrape, to
involve with themselves as many as possible. Chancery seldom objects
to take in all that can be got; for a suit in equity seems to be as elastic,
as far as accommodation is concerned, as a threepenny omnibus. The
reply of Equity to all applications for the admission of parties is almost
invariably, "Plenty of room-jumpin;" for in equity, as in fishing,
the greater the number that can be hooked, the finer the sport—and, in
fact, the more the merrier.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
is
IF NOT : WHY NOTP
ACQQBDING to the
Guide Book, Ban-
bridge, in the County
Down, is one of the
most agreeable and
flourishing places in
Ireland. ‘Banbridge
is situated on #.
| river Bann, which
| rises in the Moudne
Mountains and falls
into Lough Neagh.
Within these *.
years the place has
risen into consi-
derable importance,
wholly from commer-
cial enterprise; and,
if it was necessary
to point out what can
be accomplished by
| individual exertion,
Banbridge might be
cited as an example.
Trees adorn the
wavy country and
the villas on the
- - - banks of the Bann.
Bleaching-greens . the surface; mills and factories, with their
tº. of ponderous wheels and tall chimnies, are scattered along
the river sides, mingled with the houses and gardens of the proprietors,
the comfortable cottages of the workmen, and their small and minutely
mixed tillage and pasture fields.’... What more peaceful and beautiful
; can be conceived: and isn't it cruel to think that the comfortable
inhabitants of such a sweet district should be driven, by the ferocity of
our law, into armed rebellion ?
“Such is the case—a case only too common in our dear sister
country of Ireland. A man lives in this country; peacefully occupies a
farm and, premises, there: tills, and garners, sows and reaps, and
raturally does not like to pay rent. Who does? What generous man,
surrounded by his children, would like to give away money, and deprive
his darlings of their bread—in order to fatten an already bloatedland.
lord? What man, after four years' quiet possession, would like to give
up his own—to see the Bailiff at his door-to see his cattle and º
driven away—the lamb, that his pretty children loyed and tended, le
off, bleating, to , alien shambles—and the arm-chair, in which his old
mother very likely sate, occupied by the heartless carcass of the man in
#." The desecrated home, the insulted household gods, the
esolated cupboard, the rifled poultry-yard, the empty duck-pond and
stable;—it is hard to think of images like these, without feeling
sympathy for him who loses such treasures, or hate for the ruthless
tyrant who, ravishes, them. There ought to be no rent: no landlords:
no bum-bailiffs. What man—what body of men—what cursed Saxon
law has a right to trample out the fire upon your hearth-stone —to
make a ruin of your p ?—to pluck the steed from your stall, the
. #. your fob, the shawl from your wife's shoulders—and sen
er an
bridge, who arose, in their º to rescue one of their comrades from
the grasp of the Law and the dlord, deserve well of their country.
“The above melancholy, but natural remarks, are inspired in my
bosom (and, as I trust, in that of every honest man) by reading a report,
which appears in the Irish papers, that a gentleman, having a tenant
at Banbridge, who owed, and refused to pay, four years' rent, took with
him the sub-sheriff and a bailiff, and roceeded to distrain.
“The bloodhounds of the law, the sub-sheriff and his attendant,
armed with a writ; the landlord with the rascal-rapacity of his race,
and urged with a fiendish lust to get his four years' tribute; were met,
close to. Banbridge, by two hundred gallant men, armed with guns;
and, so just and universal was the indignation of the people against
them, that the whole of the two hundred opened a fire upon the land-
lord and the myrmidons of the bloody law. Nothing can be more
simple or fair than this:—A dastardly attack, upon the part of the law,
is met by an honourable and manly resistance on the part of the finest
peasantry in the world. One of the law bloodhounds, at whom a
gallant peasant fired, taking a coward advantage of the honest fellow,
when his gun was gone off, sprang at him and tried to collar him;
but the brave Pappy slipt out of the ruffian clutches of the bailiff, and
escaped, with agility; and, finally, bailiff, and sub-sheriff, and landlord
were obliged to retire before an indignant population. -
“Let English landlords, who are grumbling about their rents, just
look at this example, and take warning. Here is a tyrant in Ireland,
who does not get a shilling of rent for four years, and when he asks for

our little ones shiyering into the world? The men of Ban-|E
lit, the whole country turns out to shoot at him. How would the DUKE
or RICHMOND like to let his land upon such leases—and get (from
behind one of his own hedges) such a pepper-corn rent?. It is manifest
that land held upon this tenure ought to fetch a good price, for tenants
must be so eager to have it.
“The Irish legislators are worthy of the legislation. One of them
gets "g. the House of Commons and puts a series of questions to the
Irish Secret He wants to know—First, Whether the report is
true?, Secondly, Whether there is an official report?
Whether the Secretary will lay that official report before the House?
|
hirdly,
“‘Fourthly, Whether he considered it fair towards the misguided people of that country,
on the one side, or the Lord-Lieutenant on the other, that process of the kind in ques-
tion should be issued by the sub-sheriff, without apparently taking the slightest
trouble to ascertain whether the process would be opposed by the people; and, if so,
whether he had taken a sufficient force to overawe the misguided people?’”
“What would poor old Ireland, do if she hadn't her real friends
and representatives to stand by her? Here’s the real state of
the case. The Government is in fault, of course, and acting unfairly
towards the people of Down. If a man wants his rent, after four
years, he ought to ascertain whether the process for obtaining it
‘will be opposed by the people. If it will be opposed by the
ople, as of course it will, the landlord ought to get a sufficient
orce to overawe, the people. , A. bailiff should march with a couple
of companies at his back, and, if convenient, say a field-piece. e
sharpshooters of the peasantry line the outlying hedges, of course, in
advance of the main body, and open a fire at the Regulars. Regular
skirmishers dislodge (with a considerable, loss, amongst the Red-coats
and Peelers) Peasantry's advanced men, who fall back on the principal
column: the action becomes general. Having the advantage of artillery,
the Peelers and Red-coats finally get the uppermost, the gallant
Peasantry retires in good order, after severely punishing the invading
force. The firing from the stables and outhouses ceases: the garrison
is withdrawn; the hall-door is burst open; the wounded officers are
brought in and laid, on the drawing-room sofas, and, the men are
amputated on the billiard-table; and the . sheriff (if not picked
off) enters, and puts in his execution. This would clearly be the
“fair’ way of doing things. It is . cruel, and unmanly for a
sheriff and his officer to advance unarmed upon two hundred brave men
and ask for rent; it is a sheer premium to murder. What honest an
ardent Patriot, knowing the wrongs, of his country, and maddened by
centuries of oppression, could resist the opportunity of shooting a bailiff?
A fellow who comes out on such an errand is no better than an amateur
bull's-eye: and a government that employs him is merely provoking an
honest people to revolt.
landlord would most probably want his rent at the half-year, and if he
waited for four years, and then distrained for it, it is probable that his
officer would not be fired upon by two hundred of the tenant's friends,
assembled on a rising, ground, with their picquets in advance. Nor
would an English member for a Devonshire borough, let us say, hearing
that such a disturbance had takenº in Yorkshire, rise up and ask the
Home Secretary whether the conduct of the Sheriff's officer was ‘fair”
towards those misguided Yorkshire folks—as a Munster gentleman spoke
about the Ulster men the other day. Here, as yet, rent is considered to be
fair, and it is not thought altogether unfair that a man should have to pay
it. If my landlord were not to get his quarter and to put a distress into
my house (both of which may Fate forbid!) the rest of the inhabitants
of the street would not turn out with double-barrelled guns to shoot
MR. LEVI or MR.S.LoMAN. If, LEVI" and, SLOMAN came unarmed,
save with, their writ, and were fired upon by two hundred men, no
nglish Member would inquire in Parliament, why a regiment was not
sent with MEssRs. L. & S., and ask if the sending them unaccompanied
was ‘fair' upon my two hundred friends, armed with pike and gun.
Levi and SLOMAN were shot by my two hundred friends, people would
use a stronger term than “misguided’ to describe the ten score cham-
pions. If even one score of armed ruffians were to attack a lawyer's
clerk in his lawful and peaceful calling, fire at him from behind hedges,
and deliberately º his murder, the sympathy of the public would,
to !" the least, be with the single and unprotected man:, but this is
not Ireland, this is the sister country—our sister's morals, her religion,
her virtues, her vices, her views of right and wrong, of black and
white, are quite different from ours.
“Oh, Mr. Punch! when our sister's children wanted a Parliament of
their own, why, why did we balk our eloquent cousins? Why shouldn't
they have their own Commons, their own Lords, their own Bench of
Bishops, and settle their own disputes their own way? Will you please
to agitate for a Repeal party here?... If you do, I suspect you will find
many an Englishman ready to join it; and, in the matter of Repeal at
least, like your very humble servant, “HIBERNIs HIBERNIOR.”
Some People never know when they have had Enough.

TECTED FEMALE.
MRs. Jones (late Miss MARTHASTRuggles) receives a Census, Paper,
and has difficulties in respect of it.
Time.-Saturday, March 29.
MR. Jones is away from home, on business. MRs. Jon Es has been left for
a week to struggle with her loneliness, a sense of the horrors of
Papal Aggression and the approaching Erhibition of all Nations, a
flighty Housemaid, and a Cook qf violent temper.
TECTED discovered at her solitary meal. It is raining.
Er-Unprotected Female (in a damp and dreary frame of mina). How it
ours! I hope Jones is not out in it. He never will put his feet in
ot water, on his journeys. He says it does him more good to put the
hot water into his mouth, instead, with a little brandy and sugar. Uhl
I’m sure he’s getting fond of spirits. (Reverts by a well-known law in
the association of ideas, from, MR. Jones's “hot with,” to the “cold
without.”) Oh, dear! how it's raining to be sure. They say that
Crystal Palace is quite full of water—and no wonder, I’m sure; and
very glad I am of it. With their CARDINAL Wise MANs, and GAvazzis
—a parcel of foreigners! And, merey only knows what revolutions
they mayn't have, when they all come over here, and clubs and things.
I’m sure it’s dreadful. (A smart knock is heard; a cross between the
rat-tat of the Postman and the rat-a-tat-tat of a visitor.) Oh! what’s
that?—only a knock. But one’s so nervous. , Jones shall stay at
home all this summer; and if he loses his situation I’m not a-going to
be left alone with the foreigners and people—and so I’ll tell him. (A
colloquy is heard in the passage.) There's that MARY a-gossiping as
usual. The baker, I suppose; or the greengrocer's young man from
round the corner, about |. firewood.
[Enter MARY (the flighty Housemaid) with a Paper un her hand, and
some excitement in her manner. Miss MARY is a good deal
prettier than a housemaid has any right to be, even if not flighty.

Mary (much impressed by her mistress's excitement). Please M', I said
we didn't want any ; and was ordered never to take in no papers at
the door.

Er-Unprotected Female. Don't be saucy, MARy; I beg you won't.
It’s the Census I tell you; that is—(rather puzzled for a definition)–
it's hºº! at the Registrar-General's information)—“to
show the number of the population—their arrangement by ages and
families, in different ranks, professions, employments, and trades; their
distribution over the country, in villages, towns, and cities; their
increase and progress in the last ten years.”
that’s what it is, MARY (triumphantly)—and a very good thing, too.
Mary (sancily). I don’t see what business anybody’s got with other
people's ages and families, and such like.
Er-Unprotected Female (who has been turning over the document in some
bewilderment with the General Instructions, and Eramples, and Directions).
How dare you talk so, you impudent thing! It’s the Government:

be stopped, it will amount to a stoppage of their vital organs altogether.
A DODGE FOR DOWNING STREET.
MINISTERs are no conjurers, nor, indeed, do they profess to be; but
perhaps they may not be above taking a hint from those who are; and
in that case we would refer them to Monsieur and MADAME Robin,
deal more amusing, than some of the Soirées of the House of Commons.
Among other wonders, is the sudden appearance of eight half-growns
in an empty box, suspended to the eeiling by a thin piece of cord, the
box being made of perfectly transparent glass, and the money appearing
there at the simple word of Monsieur Robin. This Robin is a little
bird that might whisper valuable secrets into the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER's ear, by telling him how the money is made to come at
the mere wish and word of the person requiring it. . A something, als),
may be learnt as to the art of acquiring a surplus from the magic
portfolio of Monsieur Robin, which is far more prolific than the port-
folio of a minister, and out of which something is being continually
brought when its contents appeared to have been exhausted. ..
The Box, too, which can be made heavy and immovable, or light and
portable, at the conjuror's will, is suggestive of a power that would be
invaluable to a minister in enabling him to carry every measure of his
own, and rendering those that might be o'jectionable to him not only
incapable of being carried, but even of being taken up for a single
moment by ºi, But, perhaps, the greatest trick, of all, for the
head of a Government to be able to play would be that with which
MossIEUR RoPIN concludes the mysteries of his Soirée. . What a
lorious thing for LoRD JoHN if he could put an extinguisher over
R. DiskAELI, and cause him to disappear altogether, as MADAME
Robin is made to do at the will of her husband
We recommend the ministers, who must require some relaxation now
and then, to go to the Salle at the top of the Haymarket, where they
may borrow a hint or two, or learn a º, of that adroitness which the
majority of them stand so much in need of.

know the Wolf was a Wolf, for he did not look like one. He had on a
long black wool-len Gown, so he was a Wolf in Sheep's Clo-thing.
But LIT-TLE RED RI-DING Hoop thought he was a ...] Man. The
Wolf said, “Where are you go-ing my lit-tle Dear?” LIT-TLE RED
RI-DING Hood said, “I am go-ing to play.” “Ah!” said the Wolf,
“take care. Here comes the Old Man to run a-way with you.”
Then LIT-TLE RED RI-DING Hood be-gan to cry, be-cause she was
a-fraid. Then the Wolf said, “Come a long with me, my Dear, and
I will hide you in my nice lit-tle House, where you will be
safe from the Old Man. , So LIT-TLE RED RI-DING Hood went
a-long with the Wolf, and the Wolf took her to his Den. And,
when he had got her there, he made her give him her Basket, and go
into his Den. And he shut her up in his Den, and went a-way to his
Bro-ther Wolves, and the Wolf and the o-ther Wolves ate up her Por-
tion be-tween them. LIT-TLE RED RI-DING HooD was ne-ver seen a-ny
more, and no one knows what be-came of her, only that the Wolf kept
her in his Den till she died. Lit-tle girls should not listen to Wolves
in Sheep's Clo-thing, for fear they should be served like LIT-TLE RED
RI-DING Hood.
INCOMINGs AND SHORTcomings.-The return of the Income-Tax, and
the Census Returns, are occurring this year about the same period. We
cannot º to John BULL, with #. to the former, what we might
apply to the Registrar-General of the latter, that “we wish many happy
returns” of it. Though these two great national events occur simulta-
neously, they have very little else in common, for whereas the one is a
Census Act, the other is an Act only formed to Incense-us!
MORE NUTS FOR MINISTERIAL CRACKERS.
A New and difficult question has just started up, with reference to
the assumption of titles in this º For some years past a title
not conferred by the Sovereign has been used in a very remarkable
instance, and usually acknowledged by all classes of society. The difficult
question which now arises, and which may—or may not—account, for
the long and frequent deliberations of the Cabinet, is said to be this;
Shall the Titles Bill embrace all titles of every º not conferred
by, the Sovereign?–Shall there, in a word, be a clause added to the
bill, to bring BARON NATHAN under its provisions? There is no doubt
that, as far as real authority goes, NATHAN is as much entitled to his
Barony as WISEMAN is to his Archbishopric of Westminster; and
there is no more reason . the former should not be recognised as a
Peer, than why the latter should not be acknowledged as a member of
the Episcopate. WISEMAN claims jurisdiction over the souls, while
NATHAN seeks to influence the soles and heels, of his votaries. The
Cardinal courts distinction by his red stockings; the Baron trusts for
notoriety to his black silks and pumps, in that peculiar walk which he
has chosen. Though º in many de - - -
resemblance in the position of Wise MAN to that of NATHAN, which it
is impossible not to recognise. Both assume titles unknown to the
law; and the Barony of the one is really quite as legitimate and
respectable as the Archbishopric of the other. It is true that
NATHAN's capers are far more harmless than those of WISEMAN,
and while we would willingly trust our friend the Baron, blindfold
among our little chickens, in their state of egghood, without the fear of
their being made to shell out all they possess, we would not allow the
scarlet hose among our young brood upon any consideration whatever.
there is a sort of general

ESSEX CALVES BLATANT.
You have all heard of those untutored sons of Genius, who, in their
literary compositions, occasionally “snatch a grace beyond the reach of
Art.” Did you ever see any of the effusions of such gentlemen?, If
not, Punch will show you one. Here is a “Proclamation,” penned by
certain Essex farmers, which has appeared in some of the . ers,
and was read at the late Protection meeting at Coleshill, Warwickshire,
with great applause. Here it is, verbatim et literatim, except the italics,
which indicate the finer passages, and for which Mr. Punch is re-
sponsible:
“A Proclamation to our worthy Labourers. We, the neighbouring farmers, deeply
deplore our inability to continue the present rate of wages to our worthy labourers—the
fact is, we cannot afford it. Free Trade has brought us into close competition with
foreigners, who pay so little money for labour, that dark brown rye bread, skim milk,
cheese, and a few onions, is all that the men get. With these foreign serfs, who are now
bought and sold with the land like cattle, are we now contending in our own markets.
Much as we deplore it, we are obliged manfully to tell you that, if we are to give you
constant employment, we cannot pay the present wages. Essex must come to what
other counties have already come, 6s. and 7s, a week. We will give as much as we
can, but it must be in proportion to the price of corn; the money lost by farmers this year
is dreadful. Down with the malt-tax/ God save The QUEEN "
The merits of this extraordinary piece of writing are rather complex.
“We, the neighbouring farmers,” is grand. Yet it is also modest-
comparatively, at least. There is not that assumption about it which
characterises the famous “We, the people of England” of the immortal
Triad of Tooley Street. A fine º is observable in the condoling
reference—emphatically repeated—to “our worthy labourers,” and yet
at the same time there seems to be something of irony in the expression-
as if, whilst the “worthy labourers” are addressed, certain other persons,
not thought so worthy, were spoken at. The allusion to the “foreign
serfs who are now bought and sold with the land like cattle,” is craftily
.." to those whom it concerns. There is somewhat singularly
ſecting in the collocation of “who are now bought and sold, &c.,"
with “are we now contending in our own markets”—a pathos which
would be quite peculiar, did not its language bear so close a resem-
blance in style to the eloquence of the indigent and itinerant blind.
“We are obliged manfully to tell you—that we cannot pay the present
wages,” is a valuable specimen of the bold in writing. §. dive is very
spirited—the Plºgº is highly courageous. “In the name of the
rophet—figs ſ” is not more brave. A sublime simplicity, a severely
grand ...'...} of words, marks that pregnant sentence—which, to
produce its full effect, should be viewed apart—
“THE Money Lost BY THE FARMERs. THIs YEAR Is DREADFUL!”
And then, what can be more spirit-stirring than the concluding appeal
to love of beer and loyalty combined, “Down with the malt-tax!
**śānºa.
ut wonderful as may be the grammar, and moving therhetoric, of this
impassioned outburst of the º mind of #. Mr. Punch must
in some measure question its social, and fiscal principles. Why,
sirs, manfully, tell your labourers, that you must reduce their wages?
Why not, a little more manfully, tell yourlandlords that they must reduce
gour rents & Is it because you know that, if you cannot pay the amount
exacted, other tenants are to be found who will—enabled to do so by
farming better than yourselves?... If so, would it not be preferable for
you to put the shoulder “manfully” to the wheel, than “manfully” to
cut down the wages of your labourers? Recollect, that if the “money
lost by the farmers” through the cheapness of corn “is dreadful,” the dis.
tress that would be caused by its dearness would be slightly dreadful too.

WELL, INEVER!
THE night of March the Thirtieth, 1851, was an eventful one for the
ladies of Great Britain, who were one and all bound to declare their
ages correctly, under a tº of five pounds. Talk of the terrors of
the confessionall What can be worse to a woman, on the other side of
thirty, than to be put to the torture by the Registrar-General, and com-
elled to state, not in round numbers, but in exact figures, her real age?
he attempts at evasion on Sunday night last were, some of them,
strange and desperate. As the returns were to include those sleeping
in the house on the night in question, many a determined female refuse
to go to bed at all, or to take any sleep whatever; but a closer refer-
ence to the provisions of the act proved that the legislature had been
wide-awake enough to include also those who abode on the premises,
as well as those who slept. -
It would horrify our readers to describe some of the domestic scenes
that occurred on the evening in question between husbands and wives.
Many a married couple, who had tacitly regarded the age of the lady
as a topic too delicate to be touched upon, were drawn into a fearful
uarreſ by the bone of contention which the Registrar-General had
thrown down to them.
GeoRGE GREY and GEORGE GRAHAM were denounced as cruel
disturbers of the peace of families, by injured wives protesting against
the stirring of a quastio, rendered verans by being perata, for the first
time; and numerous were the protestations of the British matrons
inst gratifying, what they called, “a morbid curiosity” on the part
of the Government to ascertain the ages of all the ladies in England.
We have reason to fear that the return will, after all, present but an
imperfect picture of the real ripeness of British Womanhood.
We would not mind ºf a wager, before seeing the result of the
Census, that the ages of the ladies will not average more than one-third
of the ages of the gentlemen when the returns are finally made up. We
recommend seriously to the CHANCELLOR, or THE ExchequER, as a
source of revenue, the penalties recoverable for the offence of giving
incorrect information, as to age, and we are sure that, if the returns
were to be checked by the parish registers, and the ſaw carried out
strictly in every case, the amount of fines would be so, productive, that
the income-tax—for this year at least-might be repealed.

An Interesting Question.
“THE MoTHER of A LARGE FAMILY” has written to us, to inquire
if children will be admitted, at the Crystal Palace, as at theatres, at
half-price. She expresses her indignation that nothing is said in the
list of prices upon that important subject. . She is equally indignant
also about the insulting silence that is maintained upon the subject of
“babies.” They are not even mentioned in the document alluded to
We find it difficult to answer her inquiries, and so we have sent her
letter to the Exhibition Committee. We have no doubt that PRINCE
ALBERT, who is himself largely interested in the same question, will
have it settled at the next meeting of the Council.

Lyke to the hedd of a stout parson;
All hys bodye ytt was blacke,
With a longe tail to hys backe.
Hee had a paunche both round and bigge,

He cold clutche his clawes with a mighty grippe,

A wide swallowe hadd thys Dragon;

He boltyd evere so moche a yere.
He swallowyd tythès and glebès fatt,

And wold tucke in tyn like any ostriche.
Thys Dragon was a mightye boare;
He used to : Seinct Powle hys door;
Thereyn, forsothe, mote noe man goe,
But must give hym twopence to se the showe.
He wolde take the twoepence yn hys clawes,
And caste them into his open jawes,
And so quicke he gobbled the copperes browne,
As a smal boye mote cramnjam-tartes downe.
He swallowed the twopence of alle who came, -
The twopence of squier, and the twopence of dame,
The twopence of lorde and the twopence of knyghte,_
The twopence of knave and the twopence of wryghte.

The good knyghte Ponche ytt sore dyd greeve,
The Dragoune thus sholde rob and theeve;

And hee went att the Dragon tooth and mayl.
He bete the Dragon from black to blue,

But colde not hytt his brain or harte,

And gorged the brownes at his olden rate.

my ink, are enough, to soften a pen-as well
NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A (TOO) LATE
BARRISTER,
IN the last chapter of my notes Itouchedupon answers; but the Court
of Chancery will not very easily take an answer, and therefore I have
a few more words to say upon that question. I trust. I may be allowed
the contradiction of alluding to an answer as a question; and being an
Equity lawyer, I indulge in contradiction as a sort of professional
knowledge. - - - -
I have spoken of a bill being objectionable for want of parties; and
indeed Chancery loves to get as many names to a bill as possible. As
early as the time of the fº Edward, one of three executors was
sued, and feeling the desolation of being “all alone and lonely,” in
a Chancery Suit—thinking, in fact, that the suit was a great deal too
large for him—he objected that measures should be taken to include
the two others in the suit with him. STILLINGTON, the Chancellor of
the day, who was also, Bishop of Bath and Wells, so that he may be
said to have presided over hot water in a double sense, both in his
court and his diocese-STILLINGTON exclaimed, in that shocking bad
French, which used to add to the unintelligibility of law proceedings in
former times, “Jeo adjugera sur ceo, come Judge de Conscience.”
And accordingly the three executors were sued together for the sake
of company. - -
Sometimes an answer is objected to for insufficiency; for such is the
voraciousness of Chancery, that it never knows when it hashadenough,
and º bills are encouraged to gratify the equitable appetite.
And, this brings me to a melancholy part of my recollections; one on
which I am fearful that I may forget myself; for my tears, mixing with
as a heart—of steel, and
leave neither myself.nor writing, implements sufficient strength to
proceed. Butlet me force my resolution to stand firm, by taking out
inst it a summons to stay, upon my º of the costs; and,
! what costs are more onerous, than those incurred by memo
when it files a bill of revivor of the I had a client. How we
do I remember that brief period of happiness, when I had for a time,
upºn my table, a pile of papers that were not all dummy,
Long after I had laid out the fee—which went like a flash of
lightning into a tailor's pocket—I was in the habit of laying out the
paperson which that fee was endorsed. No hen, over its first egg, was
Rºº. than I over the first endorsement of “2 GAs. With You
R. MoHAIR: ” and Iremember, as if it were yesterday, when MoHAIR
and I met in the latter's third-floor back in consultation, we first burst
into wild laughter, and then dissolved into still wilder tears. As
Moham's clerk pocketed his saveloy—for the urchin was at dinner—
to admit the attorney by whom we had both been “instructed,” you
might have knocked us both down with a couple of feathers. Mohama
motioned the “member of the lower grade of the profession” to the
horse-hair chair, which I knew had been purchased for four shillings,
one night, of a man in Holborn, for I had offered three-and-sixpence for
it on a previous evening, and had been refused with “curses,” un-
pleasantly, “loud” but not particularly “deep”. But why do I go into
this episode of the “old arm-chair.” Alas! it brings up the recollection
of my own days of furnishing, when, in my innocence, I thought of
applying to the Government broker, to know whether we might not
come to terms. Well do I remember the purchase of that wretched
old half-tester, at the back of Long Acre, and after sleeping on that
deceitful bedstead, I found I had set up my buggy without the slightest
intention of doing so. How well do ſremember buying a door-mat, at
the earnest importunity of a serious matter, who talked about religion,
and, what was a very serious matter to me at that moment, leftime—by
way of change out of a very good half-sovereign-avery bad half-crown.
How well do I remember investing three pounds ten in a downy goose
feather bed, and finding too late that the seller had been much, much
more downy, and I more goose-like than the feather bed, which made
me as fretful as a porcupine with its quills. The recollection carries
me back to my diming-table, made of the “merry green-wood,” and,
º out of the mere merriment of the green-wood, splitting its
slues.
At this moment I can recall the hardness of my easy chair, which,
after having borne up against me as long as it could, seemed all of a
sudden to have abandoned the policy of resistance, and upon my
throwing myself unexpectedly upon it, laid down its arms. My first
stock of ironmongery is among my earliest associations, for Iremember
that, seeing no necessity for having too many irons in the fire, Istarted
with a poker, trusting to fortune to furnish later a shovel and tongs.
My first carpet was a º remnant, and my first rug a present from a
inte hand, that had tried its best to smooth my rugged path. My
swere a blind bargain—before I had seen them—with the previous
occupant ºf my chambers, and I took as a fixture, also, a cumbrous
article, called a lavatory, of which I afterwards tried in vain to wash my
hands. These, with a deal book-case, the only case I had for the first
year of my “practice,” constituted the whole of my furniture, except,
perhaps, my laundress, who used to eat my butter, and walk away with
my candles, attributing the disappearance of both to the enormous
appetite of some apocryphal rats. I believe these animals have an
extraordinary goût for ſº but I always thought it was customary
for them to leave the wicks. The rats of my chambers were ex-
ceptions to the rule, for with them it was “the candle, the whole
candle,” and I wish I could finish by saying, “nothing but the
candle,” which I cannot do, for they took the butter, and the
odd halfpence as well. Had there been a post-mortem examination
of one of the rats who frequented my chambers, the faculty would
have been puzzled to ascertain the cause of his death, for there would
have been found candles and coppers, tea and sugar, sealing-wax and
butter, soap and stockings, coals and shirt-collars, with a sprinkling of
other “sundries,” in its inside. Inever thought of looking into the
natural history of the rat, for the purpose of º whether, the
animal was a natural receptacle for the missing articles, to some of which
I have alluded, but placing implicit faith in the tales of my laundress,
I believed, as my goods disappeared, that the rat—like Othelio–had a
“stomach for them all.”

A BISHOP FAMOUS IN STORY.
THERE is no objection occasionally to Punch a la Romaine,
because Punch is wholesome in every form; but Bishop a la
Romaine seems to be a very deleterious mess, if we are to judge
by the specimens lately sent us from the Vatican. Any one
with a regard for his reputation would honestly exclaim Nolo
scopari—I won't be a Bishop—if the Pope should offer
him a mitre, and if the Rome-made, in contradistinction from
the home-made, prelates are such as we have recently had a
sample of. The occupant of the New Catholic See of Clifton,
as exposed by himself in his letters in the Times, is º
as slippery as might be expected from one bearing the title
of his “oiliness.” We should recommend the translation of
“Clifton” by desiring him to go to Bath;, or perhaps the
better arrangement would be, to send him at once to
Coventry.

periodicals. As a literary curiosity, however, Punch must pre-
serve from oblivion a most curious perversion of Latin parts
of speech, which appeared in the Morning Post of Tuesday
week last. The Times reported MR. SMYTHE as having made
allusion, in the previous evening’s debate, to a mediaeval myth,
setting forth that, on the union between Church and State
taking place under Constantine, an angel was heard wailing
and crying in the air:-
“Hodie in ecclesiam venenum infunditur.”
Which, ragged scholar, means, “This day is poison infused
into the Church.”
In the Post this bit of Latinity is thus varied:–
“Dodrie in ecclesiam venerum injuditiones.”
The classical reader may smile; but there is a mysterious
grandeur in these distorted words. There is a fine ecclesias-
tical smack about them, wanting in the simple text. They
have a singular weight with us from the very circumstance of
our not understanding them; is it not so, fair saints of Bel-

A PRETTY TUNE FOR A ROMISH ORGAN.
|UNCH must unequivocally con-
demn one mode of attack some-
times resorted to against Popery,
– namely, misrepresentation.
There is nothing in warfare so
base and dastardly : poisoned
£ arrows, red-hot shot, are fair and
= honourable weapons to the shafts
; of calumny. Now, for instance,
with a view to P. the
faith of a body of high-minded
gentlemen in the House of
Commons, it is very shameful
to represent their religion as
obliging them systematically to
impede the progress of public
ſº affairs, not only in opposing the
Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, but by
striving generally to embarrass
the Government. It is disgrace-
ful to say—as if asserting Roman
Catholic principles—that,
“Besides this, it is the duty of the
Irish members to be obstructive in
every other department of public busi-
ness; to dabble in finance, law reform,
- colonial reform, foreign affairs, and to
occupy the time of the House as much
as possible with questions, motions,
amendments, speeches, and the other
manoeuvres of a Parliamentary
guerilla.”
If this is the line of policy
which Roman Catholicism pre-
uires them to behave in this unscrupulous manner,
of rational individuals—to vote against

scribes to its professors, as legislators, if it
more like a set of perverse and vexatious women than a bod -
their own convictions and to the national detriment, for the indirect promotion, by indirect means,
of the º interests of their Church;-if their religion obliges them to practise such villany as
al
this, the plain inference is, that they have no business, in the House of Commons at all, and a case is
clearly made out for the repeal of the Emancipation Bill. But no. Let us be fair in our opposition, at
any rate. Let us not dress, up Roman Catholicism as a monster to excite animosity against it, as
Nº § red the early Christians in the skins of wild beasts, and then baited them. No. We
won’t do that.
Again, it is surely a cruel slander to represent the Roman Catholic mind as breathing, such a spirit
of malignant and outrageous detraction, and hatred, and disrespect for constituted authorities, as is
evinced in the following extract relative to LoRD JoHN RUssell:—
“He is a man of small precedents; and, as there is still a Catholic Load STAfroRD, perhaps the Premier might consider him
to have a prescriptive title to the block; or, for the sake of variety, would he plunge his knife into the bowels of some
other innocent victim º "
We really must disown the Protestant who would put forward language, replete, as the two
foregoing specimens, with º and violence, as expressive of Roman Catholic sentiments. We
must leave him to be stigmatised as a shameless, calumniator—a wilful impugner of the known truth,
a deceitful, malicious, abandoned heretic,+to be branded, in short, in every possible way, except, we
will say, with the actual cautery.
But, soft l—as the hero º: in the minor drama. Gentle reader, the precious paragraphs above

petition for deliverance from friends, one would think should be added to the invocations of the
Roman Litany.
FORMATION OF THE EARTH.
We have been watching the progress of the Earth for several days past, in Leicester Square, and have
arrived at the following conclusions, built upon the premises, as far as they are advanced in that Arabia
Petraea of all WYLD spots in England.
The primary strata of the #. consisted of oyster, shells, old marrow-bones, lobster claws, and
broken bricks. Occasionally, a defunct dog or cat was found with them. . These were mingled with
decayed shrubs and small mounds of mud, relieved with bright fragments of crockery ware, and picked
out here and there with a perfect specimen of a ginger-beer bottle.
... These formed the foundation; but as it was supposed that the Earth would have a very uneasy seat of
it, if it rested upon nothing stronger than the above º: compound, the whole mass was
çarted away, and a stronger foundation, laid down, of bricks firmly cemented with mortar. Upon this
foundation, six feet deep, does the World now rest.
The shape of the Earth partakes very much of the appearance of a lady's powder-box; or it may be
said to resemble a compressed Colosseum. But as the Earth alters in appearance every minute, and
grows visibly in size every day, it would be hasty and premature, on our part to say just at present what
the Earth is like, or what it is ultimately like to be. Accordingly, we reserve our opinion.
In altitude the Earth reaches as high as the garret windows of the Linwood Gallery. . In width it
could easily gallop down Piccadilly without breaking a shop-window on either side. What the thimble
is to the pea, so is St. Paul's to the circumference of the Earth.
But, as galloping down Piccadilly implies a sense of motion, we must distinctly state that the Earth
so far from revolving, is as stationary as Smithfield Market, or any other London nuisance can be; an
that no order from a policeman, if such a thing was to be found on the surface of the Earth, could
|
induce it to “move on.” This is
lucky for the human beings that live
round the Earth, as one of the revo-
lutions would, instantly bring their
houses about their, ears, in a way as
summary as the French Revolutions
have proved to the Orleans, the
Bourbon, and other Houses, since fallen
completely to the ground.
The Earth has but one Pole, and
that is one on which a flag is flying
from the summit, or chimney, or ven-
tilator, or whatever the small orifice
may be that is on the top, like the slit
in a money-box. - -
The Centre of the Earth is occupied
by a plaster statue of one of England's
kings on horseback, but which king is
on horseback our geological researches
have not enabled us to discover, for
we have not yet penetrated into the
interior.
The only persons that at present
inhabit the Earth are a few carpenters
and glaziers, who walk upon it by
means of ladders—a very inconvenient
way of walking, if a person had to
travel for many days to distant climes.
What the products of the Earth may
be, we cannot take upon ourselves to
say; but we are told that the interior
is entirely filled with hoarding, pre-
viously to the monster casts...taking
possession of it. This brings, it some-
what into relationship with the Earth
we ourselves inhabit, where we know
too well that hoarding is the occu
tion of a very large caste of men. The
monster casts, we are told, are taken
from moulds, in which respect the
Model Earth differs, from our own,
where the mould is all on the outside.
The Earth has already cost a world
of money, is just four weeks old, an
is expected to last three years; after
... eriod it will be taken to pieces,
and sold for rubbish.
We had nearly forgotten to state
that, the principal deposits, of the
Earth will be the money paid at the
door. Its mineral products will be
silver and gold; but no diggings will
be allowed for the discovery of the
latter in the regions of California.
We have only as yet scratched up
the ground of this very fertile subject,
and so shall take the liberty of return-
ing to the Earth in a day or two.
A Pretty Scale of Prices.
A FASHIONABLE, Portrait. Painter,
whose name it would not be fair to his
many rivals to mention, when asked
what are his terms, invariably answers:
—“I have no scale of prices. In fact,
I generally leave it open to the libera-
lity of my patrons. I have but one
ºl. to guide me in taking likenesses,
and that, to be candid, is, ‘Handsome
is, who Handsome does.”
What an April Fool!
A Young correspondent, who writes
on the lst of April, says he has been
directed by his friends to inquire of us,
“What kind of fish is the Poisson
d’April 2". We have the greatest
pleasure in informing our juvenile cor-
respondent that the fish in question is
a very odd fish, and in its general cha-
racteristics is supposed to be very like
a whale!

“WELL ; PuT ME up A Dozen, To TRY 1"
THE FRENCH CONSPIRATION.
From GoBEMoUCHE, Man of Letters, to SIR WortLEY, Member of
Parliament.
4ſ. RD,
“I HAVE read in the journal the allocution which you have
addressed to the Government, and in, which you state that you, have
a proofs of a great conspiracy existing in this country, and of which this
city is the threshold.
‘Milord. I am a Frenchman. I am a conspirator. I am proud of
one and other title. ...Yes; we conspire: yes, we wish to conquer the
old England. . But it is in the full street that we conspire. It is by
intelligence, by genius, by civilisation, and no more by sabres and
bayonets, that we would vanquish. Yes, we will invade you by
thousands; and our flotillas, unimpeded, shall discharge legions of our
compatriots, from Boulogne, upon the Cliffs of Albion. But those
invaders come with flowers in their fusils, and your blondes country-
women need fear no terrors of war from those who trust to overcome
them. Yes, perhaps, I myself may hope to lead away some Britannic
Briseis, the captive of my bow; but it is the bow of CUPID which I
wield—it is with love and not war that we would be irresistible !
“My lord—there is a conspiracy, but it is patent—a foreign invasion,
but it is here. Our banners are planted amongst you, and yet your
Kremlin on the Thames does not burn. Our legions are encamped in
Regent's Quadrant and Leicester Squar: and yet we do not fear poison
in the houses where we are billetted, or dread ambuscades as we parade
your city. Oh, vanquished you have nothing to fear from French-
men' We smoke under NELsoN’s column, and Trafalgar is ours. We
promenade in Waterloo's Place, and revenge Waterloo!
“Already a letter from the important journal of which I was corres-
ndent, has appeared in these columns. Although the Moniteur de
Boulevardes has ceased to exist, I am a man of ſetters still, and not
idle... I study. I observe. I reflect. Educated with care, I write
English with native purity.
“I am not of those Frenchmen, light and frivolous, who think to
approfound the institutions of a country in a visit of eight days: and
having walked through London, attended by their guide of . and
spoken and smoked with their compatriots at the cafés of Leicester
Squar and Regent's Quadrant, believe themselves authorised to speak
with confid ºnce of the manners and the polities of a great nation. No
Since my arrival I have deeply studied, carefully inspected, intimately
meditated this City, this Carthage, superb rival of our Rome. I have
marked all classes of Insularies, from the superb LoRD MAYok in his
palace of the City, to the humble artisan taking his refreshment under the
tents of the Crystal Exhibition. I have formed profound conclusions;
I interview enormous changements for this country.
“The insular habits are rapidly passing away. The Parisian civilisation
has invaded and conquered the white cliffs, at which NAroLEoN pointed
in vain his eyeglass and his flotillas. The male beard and costume of
France no longer excites ridicule in the old England—on the contrary, the
Insularies adopt our dress, and let to grow their moustachios. I saw of
late, in the Chamber of Commons, the son of the greatest of English
Statesmen. His discovered chest, his waving locks curled above his
|blue frock with buttons of copper, the culotte of skin, the boots to
are those of the
forehead in a BRUTUs, his rich *. f the
country O
his gallant air
Continent of our France—not of England, traditional
reverse. The young SIR P-L might be a Sportsman of our Jockey
Club; a lion of our Boulevard of Glove. And not he only, as I have
said—not the young dandies of the clubs and brilliant militaries on leave
—but the * in general, the artists, the students of the schools of
medicine, the advocates of the Temple, and the clerks of notary, the
young officers of scheriffs in Chancery Lane, let grow the bair and carry
the beard. Where our arms have not conquered, our arts have
vanquished. The old England Frenchifies itself all the days.
“I see on most of the shopstheannouncement that French here is spoken
—an imperfect |. it is true, but yet a great and remarkable advance
and sign of civilisation; and it is with no small feelings of delight and
pride I remark that almost all the literature of the people is translation of
the profound views of our own superior authors; the seizing narratives
of our incomparable ALEXANDRE—the large morality of SUE, and SAND;
even the º tales of the good old PAUL DE Kock, here find inter-
preters and admirers. In the English Theatre, no pieces but of French
origin are tolerated by the public. An accomplished countrywoman of
ours, speaking, it is true, in the English language, but with an accent
which renders her adopted tongue a thousand times more melodious and
charming than it is in native mouths, is the chief actress at the people's
theatre in the Strand. At that of the Princess, where presides the Son
of the KEAN, whom our ALEXANDRE DUMAs has rendered immortal, I
found him and his wife performing a drama from our Boulevard. At
Drury-Lane, Azael the Prodigal, surrounded by the Bayaderes of Mem-
phis, has borrowed the decorations and voluptuous dances, if not the
music, of our Academy. Tartuffe is acting upon the Haymarket scene,
and those shafts which the immortal MoLIERE launched against the
priests and bigots of his time, are found still to be sharp and to have
poison after two hundred years, when directed against Anglican Church
zealots, and aimed at Britannic hypocrites.
“Thus I say, that we have conspired, and that we have conquered.
“Is not the man of all England the most admired and beloved a
Frenchman? Whose name, whose good things are in so many les’
mouths as the name, as the good things of ALEXIS Sox.E.R.? #.
ALEXIS is a great H. conqueror. If merit is to be º
by public gratitude, his eminent services ought to be acknowledged by
the two countries—the two countries which he has united, as were the
twins of Siam, by the bond of the stomach. If there were a co
(bleu) of the Legion of Honour, it should be sent, to SoYER, with the
title of Grand Commander. This nation has paid him just and repeated
honours. Chef of the Club of Reform, that once powerful party has
been disorganised ever since be ceased to be its chief. It dwindles.
One is dissatisfied with its leaders. LoRD JoHN is scarcely esteemed:
SIR. Wood is little tasted since SoYER the Frenchman resi -
baton of commandment, and threw himself upon a single party no
more, but on the whole country.
“Albion has responded to his appeal. In our days of college, it was
our habit to call her perfidious; but where shall we find a country more
faithful, more grateful? With us everything uses itself; every man
makes himself to forget. A week after February there was no more
question of the House of Orleans, than of the House of Valois; a
month after LAMARTINE had been the hero of a revolution, the
saviour of a Republic, he was the forgotten writer of books forgotten.
Here it is different. We (for almost I feel that this is France and that
I am an Englishman) honour and remember our public men. Honour
to the country, and to those to whom she is grateful! -
“An exploding proof of this worthy appreciation has lately been con-
ferred upon ALExis Soy ER. The magistrates of the county of Middle-
sex have summoned. before them ALExis. He appeared with the
courage of his nation, of his genius, before the grave administrators of
the Britannic Themis. But it was not tortures, it was not imposts, it
was not Botanibay, which they offered to him; it was to confer upon
him the rights of citizenship, and to present him, in the name of Queen
Victor IA, of the Lord MAYor, of England entire, with a splendid
testimony of the national gratitude.
“In the neighbourhood of London—by the gigantesque Palace of
Crystal, the fresh meadows of the Hyde Park, and the sombre avenues
of Kinsington's Gardens—little removed from the Octroi (turnspikes)-
there stands, amidst parks and prairies of its own, a château called the
Château of Gor. The Château of Gor has been purchased with the
money of the municipality by this grateful nation, by these grave magis-
trates, and has been conferred, with the patent of baronnet,
ALExis Soy ER, Frenchman. SIR Soy ER, in , a warm allocution,
responded to the Lord MAyoR, when this title, this domain, were con-
ferred upon him—and asked all the magistrates to dine in the palace of
which he has become master. -
“A palace of fairies is he making of it—truly a Symposium of all
nations, as SIR Soyer (faithful to his Bacchanalian tradition, and proud
of his religion of the apron) has styled it. Halls are here filled in the
manners of all nations, accommodated by the presiding tasteof SIRALExis,
The Saloon of Italy, the Saloon of Turkey, the Saloon of Spain; the Hall
of France, the Hall of Old England. You may consume here the

“Garden of England,” which has been rough dug all the winter, is
being stocked with liberal pennyworths of pºlyantiuses; and the Hall
of Banners is being sure of its armorial pocket-handkerchiefs darned
up into a condition calculated to make them fit emblems of an age of
valry.
In ºlition to the ordinary number of “Abodes of Bliss,” with their
tight ropes, additional lamps, ham sandwiches, stout, and fire-works, we
are promised, at Kensington Gore, something of a severely classical
school in Soyer's Symposium. Already at the outer gate may be seen
a British Lion, sculptured from a bit of genuine hearth-stone, raising
his paws in playful ram , and holding in his grasp a huge gas-pipe,
as # to show his mi º: shaking his mane and clutching the main

thousand yards long; but whoever spun that enormous yarn must, we
think, have been threading the mazes of those realms of fancy which
SoxER is attempting to realise.

A Work that is Sure to Go Down to Posterity.
Amongst the few works of the present day (excepting, of course,
Punch) that have any chance of going down to posterity, we may
mention the present unfinished Catalogue of the British Museum. In
fact, if it advances no quicker than it has already done, it is not only
likely to go down to Posterity, but to Posterity’s Posterity, and even
further. We wish them all joy of a thing which we are never likely to
enjoy ourselves.
. A Magistrate recently cautioned a defendant not to “take the law
into his own hands.” the presentimpure state of it, surely nobody
would think of doing so!
CUSTOMS OF THE CUSTOM HOUSE.
THE fact is beginning to be rather a
Customs are particularly ugly customers. e London Dock Company
has had to complain of their behaviour, and the St. Katherine's ditto
has also petitioned Parliament in deprecation both of their manners and
their Customs. The petitioners allege that on one occasion,
“Their premises were suddenly subjected to a search more like a search by police
officers for stolen goods than a visit for examination by officers of the Customs.”
Is this what these excisemen—if they were in search of spirits—call
doing “their spiriting gently?”
To seize on large quantities of goods not liable to duty at all, appears
to have been a customary P. with these Custom-house gentry.
They are likewise accused of having filed fifty-three separate informa-
tions relative to articles, some of which were not worth above la each;
º: which savour much more of grinding oppression than of
egal filing. That informations of such a nature are uncommon is
creditable to the character of the common informer. Their information
seems to be in a great measure worthless, as after all, that is, after the
lapse of a twelvemonth, they often fail to bring it into Court. The
following charge against them, if a true bill, shows them to be as
remarkable for misapprehension as for misinformation.
“It is also affirmed that some over drawings of molasses, which had been marked
among the seizures, being inadvertently returned to the casks, the Customs preferred
an indictment for felony against ten of the company's servants, upon which four of them
were committed to Newgate, and that when notice of trial was at length given, the
record was suddenly withdrawn.”
This great alacrity in getting up a charge would be most fitly re-
compensed by a discharge; a broadside which, to a very large extent,
should send the Board of Customs to their right place; namely, the
right about. The principle of FreeTrade thoroughly carried out, or
carried out and out, would enable us to dispense with their disagreeable
services. A great deal of the work they do had better be left undone;
for example, rummaging the persons of travellers; and what they leave
undone they had better never meddle with—the trunks of said tra-
vellers. Half of the time they are paid for consuming is wasted for the
prevention of pettysmugglinginruffling dresses by their clumsiness, and
tempers by their behaviour. This rotten old Government log ought to
be chopped up. Customs like those of this Board would be much more
worthily honoured in the breach than in the observance; and if the
breach were a break-up of the whole Board, so much the better.
FEWEST WORDS NOT SOONEST MENDED.
Last year, everybody thought a great legislative feat had been
accomplished by the passing of an act for the shortening of the language
of Acts of Parliament, but it seems that, in legislation, a “few words”
leads to so much disputing, that it has been necessary, in a great hurry,
to repeal the Act alluded to. We must infer from this, that Parliament
is nothing if not long-winded, and that it is quite impossible to legislate
without the old allowance of verbiage.
The attempt to make the ºie the feminine, and to declare
“this” shall stand for “that,” and “one” for “tº other,” has sig-
mally failed; and we have gone back in a single year to that plethoric
richness of adjectives, verbs, and substantives, for which our Acts of
Parliament have long been remarkable. Since the principle of curtail-
ment has been thus unceremoniously thrown overboard, we wonder
some M.P. does not propose that no Act shall be binding or bound up
in the Statute-Book that does not run to so many pages at least—the
number to be determined up-stairs by a Select Committee.
Lord John taking up his Bill.
THE question of the admission of Jews into Parliament is again
before the Legislature. We trust that bigotry and intolerance will no
longer deprive the House of Commons of the services of a class of men
so eminently calculated as the Hebrews, to participate in its labours;
for never let us forget that the whole business of Parliament may be
defined to be a series of bill-transactions.
How to obtain a Character.
LoRp John Russell, reading in the advertisements that a character
might be obtained at any time a person sending a Graphiologist a
specimen of his handwriting, immediately sat down, and wrote a letter,
in which he said, that “he would feel extremely obliged if Mr. W
could possibly favour him and his colleagues with a character by return
of post; at present they were deplorably in want of one.”

Classical Group which will, in all Probability, be on the Top of the Marble Arch by the First of May.
“WHAT’s the use of the Marble Arch?” is a question that even
Echo-who usually answers for everything and everybody—did not
condescend to reply to, until, the other day it was suggested that the
top of the Arch should be converted into a police station. Economy is
now so much the order of the day, that we wonder Temple Bar is not
assigned as a residence to the LORD, MAYOR, that the Mansion House
may be let out in separate beds for families and gentlemen. The
Beadle of Aldgate has, we understand, for some years, lived in Aldgate
Pump-upon, of course, a reduced salary; and we have heard it
rumoured that the two legs of the Bronze AcHILLEs, in Hyde Park,
are being fitted up as barracks for a small detachment of Foot, that
will be on guard during the Exhibition.
There is, perhaps, no objection to housing a division of police is the
Marble Arch, provided the inhabitants do not interfere with the architec-
tural design, by putting their heads out of the window and breaking the
uniformity of the cornice, by a great staring police constable, rendered
more glaring, at night-time, by his terrific bull's eye. We suppose we
must expect the top of the Arch to be turned to some useful purpose by
the inhabitants, and that it will be impossible to keep the Inspector from
smoking his pipe; the Serjeant from nursing his baby; or the married
officer from assisting in the weekly washing operations by which he ekes
out his maintenance. The single constable .# of course, expect to take
his “lettered ease”, over his newspaper, on the top of the Arch, which,
thus surmounted, will form an agreeablefore-ground to the Crystal Palace.
POLICE CASE EXTRAORDINARY.
Two lads, familiarly known as CHARLEY and JACK, were charged
with attempting to pick the pocket of MR. John BULL, in the old high-
Nº. It appeared from the evidence of Special Constable Punch, that
he had been watching MR. John BULL for some time, and, seeing the
prisoners with him, pretending to be his friends, he, the constable, was
afraid that MR. John BULL had got into rather bad hands, and resolved
to keep his eye on what was going forward, Seeing the prisoners
shuffling about for some time, and going from side to side as if they did
not know what to do, the constable remained a little way behind, when,
suddenly, the prisoner CHARLEY threw something over MR. BULL's
head, and, from the effect, there could be no doubt that there was some
chloroform, or other stupifying matter, on the article alluded to. At
the very same moment the other prisoner, JACK, approached the
gentleman's pockets, which were very full, and drew from him a long
purse marked with the word “Income.”
On being asked what they had to say for themselves, both the pri-
soners were inclined to be rather insolent, and CHARLEY said that he
was only offering the gentleman something to do him good; while as to
his companion, he had only just met him. -
Jack, when asked what he had to say to taking the money, declared
the gentleman owed it to him, and even if he didn't, he had got a
surplus—much more than he wanted for himself—and seeing it hang
out of his pocket, the opportunity was too tempting. -
On inquiry being made whether the prisoners were known, it was
found that both had been in the service of the prosecutor, who said he
had not had much to complain of until lately, when both had become
rather neglectful. In fact, he feared they had been too long in
their places. -- - -
The prisoner JAck declared he had offered once to leave his situation,
but his master wouldn't let him. . Both prisoners said the gentleman
was at liberty to suit himself, if he could, for they were tired of his
service, and didn't want to stay with him any longer. -
They were informed, that, however this might be, they must do their
duty as long as they remained; and they were remanded to a future
day, for #. inquiry.
The Real Miracle of Rimini.
MR. DRUMMOND may say what he likes about the winking picture of
Rimini: but there is one miracle which it has unquestionably performed.
It certainly has opened the eyes of wavering Protestants.

the same family, is an excellent one, and should not be held up to ridi:
cule. It stands to reason that the members of a Ministry who are all
members of the same family, must pull much better together than a
Ministry composed of persons picked from twenty different families,
who would each have a different interest, and would all be pulling
twenty different ways. The Family Ministry, on the contrary, has but
one interest, and pursues it in one compact body, most perseveringly,
every occasion. The members of it never squabble, for the
interest of one is the interest of all. To make a Ministry strong and
durable, we are confident that all the members of it should be personally
related; and the closer the ties of relationship, the stronger the interest
that binds the Ministry together. By this means you gain Union, and
Union in a Ministry is halfits strength. -
On the above principle, we hold, it is far better to have one Family
to govern us, though it may be the dullest in the kingdom, than a
Ministry composed of the cleverest men of the day !
In fact, we are convinced that the plan of Family Ministries is so
far superior to every other, that we propose that every Ministry, for the
future, be composed of but one entire Family. The various offices might
be distributed in the following manner:—
The Prime Minister - {: *}The Grand Papa of the Family.
given to J
The Lord High Chancellor His Eldest Brother.
Home Secretary . Grand Papa's Eldest Son.
A German Cousin, or any one of the
Foreign Relations.
Some Distant Relation.
The most liberal Uncle.
Somebody's Godpapa.
Any of the Grandsons who had shown
a taste for Letters.
Any of the Dittos who had read Robin-
son soe.
So many Brothers.
Any one of the Grandsons who had been
{ taken out a-shopping by his Mamma.
ſ Some crabbed Relation, to whom a
U grudge was owing.
The subordinate offices might be scrambled amongst the Nephews,
and the Cousins, and the Poor Relations, until the whole Ministry was
complete. The appointments about the QUEEN’s Household should be
confided to the female members of the same family. Mamma might
be Mistress of the Robes; and Ladies of the Bed-chamber should be
entrusted to the Wives and Daughters of Ministers, or else their
Aunts, and Great-Aunts, and Nieces. -
The only difficulty would be in the case of a family not being nume-
rous enough to fill all the offices, and being compelled to admit another
family to share the public fish and bread-basket with them, which would
necessarily cause a division, and lead to quarrelling... But such an in-
stance was never known. It is extraordinary the large families Ministers
always have. . There seems no end to them. The cause, we believe, is
owing to the large increase of one's family directly a person gets into
power:_relations, home as well as foreign, spring up in every direction,
and a Minister is introduced for the first time to first, and second
cousins—and great uncles, and great great grand-children on his mother's
side—of whose existence he never had the slightest suspicion, before
his elevation. Accordingly, we do not think we need have much fear
of the Supply of relations ever failing to meet the Demand.
We are positive our snug little family plan would answer admirably.
Another advantage would be that we should be saved by it the disap-
pointment of resignations, and the annoyance of dissolutions,—for you
may depend upon it that when once an entire family gets into power, it
would take a change in the dynasty at least ever to get them out again.
Once in, there would be the comfort of knowing that they would re-
main in for ever.

Architectural Transparencies.
THE Crystal Palace will doubtless suggest the construction of a great
variety of similar edifices. Punch would propose glass as the very best
possible material to build nunneries with, as in default of a legally
appointed visitation of such institutions, it would be satisfactory, and
would tend to calm unpleasant apprehensions, to see how their inmates
are treated, and generally what is going on inside the establishments in
question.
AN APOLOGY WHICH WAS SADLY NEEDED.
THE present Ministry is, as every one knows, a long way from being
a good Ministry; but still it is the best of its kind, for it must be con-
fessed that, as far as it has gone,—and we have hopes it will yet go
further, it has proved, itself in every respect “An Out-and-Out
Ministry.”
:
CHANCERY FOR THE MANY.
...ON, consideration, it strikes Mr. Punch, that LoRD John Russel.L,
if he had tried, might have devised a better expedient for expediting
the business of Chancery, than that of setting the Master of the Rolls
and a Common-law Judge to help the LoRD CHANCELLOR. ... Numerous
cases of º: are continually coming before the Metropolitan Magis-
trates, and are generally dealt with in such a manner as to give universal
satisfaction. If certain Shepherds of the Mormonite persuasion had
conspired to diddle a parish orphan out of a few pounds that had been
bequeathed to her in the savings bank, the machinations of those
reverend persons might have been effectually defeated, and the protec-
tion of the child provided for, quite adequately, without filing any sort
of Bill, by a simple application to the Beak. An order, or a recom-
mendation, directed to the overseers, with, perhaps, the summary com-
mittal of some of the parties implicated to the House of Correction,
would answer every purpose in such a case.
Punch, therefore, º: that the LoRD MAYOR should be asso-
ciated with the Lord CHANCELLOR, and likewise the more sagacious
among the Aldermen, together with the magistrates who dispense jus-
tice at the various police-offices. Such judges would not be the less
competent to settle a question of common sense and equity, because it
involved a matter of eighty thousand pounds. In short, a recent
notorious case might have been decided, as well, or better than it has,
at the Mansion House, or Worship-Street; and certainly much more
satisfactorily to the party chiefly concerned, there being the “costs to
be paid out of the estate.”
A CAMBRIDGE LYRIC.
QH, call me early, faithful GYP,-Oh, call me early, pray;
Toºmorrow's dawn will usher in the fatal Tripos Day.
From . Street and Trumpington, and the King's Parade along,
The embryo Wranglers, Senior Ops, and Juniors will throng.
I'm sure, if reading hard will tell, I’ve done my very best;
I’ve ransacked all the libraries and news-rooms east and west:
HALL’s, Johnson's, and MACMILLAN’s shelves attest my studies still,
And so, unless I greatly err, will each man's little bill.
Bell's Life in London, every week, I’ve scanned from page to page;
Devoured every novel that in turn has been the rage; ,
I’ve scampered over Hioper, and got it pretty pat;
I’ve studied Fistiana well, and Felix and the Bat.
The Mathematics practical I’ve studied 'gainst my will,
And described some rare parabolas in the course of many a spill;
And though I’ve not read Whewell, or a man of equal note,
I know something still of levers, as I’m stroke-oar of the boat.
Non fumus er fulgore, the mild cigar has taught;
Qf Falernum and Sahinum you know what HoRACE thought;
And after many a wine-party, with the Bard I quite agree,
Old-crusted Port at sixty-four bangs Cape at twenty-three.
But what will these accomplishments in the Senate-House avail?—
Recipes for mixing Copus, brewing Bishop, mulling Ale.
Will one continuous cannon at the billiard-table tell?—
I fear my course of subjects will too surely prove a sell.
They tell me, oh, N. faithful Gyp, 'twill be a case of pluck—
A most decided “Not approved;” if so, what sorry luck!
But were I an Apostle, methinks with joy I’d swoon,
And sing a hymn of triumph, were I dubbed “The Wooden Spoon.”
Then call me early, faithful GYP ; prepare a good repast,-
Strong Mocha Coffee to begin, some Cognac for the last;
And if I pass to-morrow, the College Ale I’ll broach,
And uphold my plan of studying 'gainst reading with a “coach.”
Extensive Sale of Wood.
DID it ever happen to SIR CHARLEs Wood, when at school, to be
despatched to procure pigeon's milk somewhere about this time of the
year * Punch's reason for asking this question will be obvious from the
subjoined very innocent announcement, which appeared the other day
in the Times:–
“The CHANCELLoR of THE Exchequer has also received a letter from ‘P. Q.,'
porting to enclose a half-note for £50. No half-note, however, accompanied the letter.
Surely the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER received this letter on
the First of April.

To relieve the minds of HER

the next task to which he intends to

| Rival to the Great Exhibition.
| THE Great Exhibition"of 1851 will
| be a very wonderful affair; but more
wonderful still will be the Great Im-
position of this same year-if the
people will stand it. It is needless to
say, we allude to the renewal of the
Income-tax.
SCARCELY THE WORD FOR IT.
A contemporary, talking of the
Great Exhibition, says, “the works
have been getting on swimmingly.”
SPIRITUAL TAILORS.
A PhILosophical book remains to be written on the connexion
between clothes and conversion; dealing with those ..". gentlemen
who only renounce the “vanities of the world” for the sake of the-
vanities of the church. How much may not the Tailor have to answer
for; the Tailor whose goose saves the Roman Capitol -
o explain: Young WELouBBY, chiefly notable at Oxford for his gay
attire, suddenly darkens in hue. The studs vanish like falling stars
from his shirt. ront, which becomes a sad one-frons lata parum. A
F. development takes place. But then you, observe another
orm of dandyism comes up. He looks more sanctified, it is true—but
then it is a polished and pretentious sanctity. , The black is glossy; the
pallor sentimental. , Now, may not a jackdaw be as vain as a peacock–
in spite of his sombreness? Shall we not suppose that it is W. p0S-
sible that the Tailor's part may help the Priest’s in this kind of conver-
sion, and that all these delicate dark externals of dress . be the real
converters, affecting a dandiacal mind? It is a melancholy thought
that Protestant churches should be severed by a tailor's shears!
We regret to say that your Tailor is fast becoming your Tractarian's
assistant. At the Universities, waistcoats like hair-shirts are among
the regular articles of supply. Soon may we expect to see a “Gent's
new hair-shirt,” or a “Tie à l’Ignatius,” figuring in London for the
benefit of the cheap dandies. The Tailor has the power of canonisation
now-a-days. A little fancy, conjoined to a good deal of credulity, help
his disciples on. Weak boys imagine they are loving doctrine, when
they only love ornament. They chiefly value the Rose of Sharon as
something to be worn in the button-hole!
Now we cry, “Reform your Tailor's bills,” to these young gentlemen.
We have no objection, to be sure, to anybody's wearing a hair-shirt–
ways provided it is occasionally washed. . But a waistcoat like a hair:
shirt is not an object of reverence, but of ridicule, my dear VELOURBY |
And, when, further, your ecclesiastical dandyism extends to putting
“old English" inscriptions in Latin on your É.i. the case gets
worse;—the respice finem on the panels only suggests “whip behind"
to the classical man of sense. -
Punch is only gay on such, matters with an object of good. ...Any
attendant of St. BARNABAs will tell you, that you prepare the purifying
Holy Water by putting salt in it.
THE BEST PERsons. To Know.—An Undertaker is advertising, a
#. º of Coffin, which, he says, is “strongly recommended by the
aculty.”
A SLAP IN THE FACE FROM BROUGHAM.
IORD BROUGHAM still preserves some of his old turn for satire, as
well as his other powers, which we are º to find unimpaired; and
he gave a specimen last Thursday evening of his retaining his *.*.
for irony in all its early vigour. Speaking of some motion he had
brought forward, he said, “Had he known that there would have been
other business on the same night, he would, for the convenience of the
House, have postponed his motion, to a future day, because he could
not but be sensible that it would be inconvenient to their Lordships to
listen to a discussion on this subject after having had their attention
occupied with another matter.” This sarcasm would seem to imply
that his Lordship did not believe the mental capacity or capaciousness
of the House of Peers to be sufficient to admit of more than a single
subject of discussion on a single evening.
It is true that the Commons rattle off their topics a little too glibly
sometimes, and pass rather hurriedly from the Budget to Ceylon; then
make a dash to Ireland, from which, by a short cut, they go to the East
Indies, calling at the *: of Good Hope, and winding up, as it were,
in Houndsditch, by a debate on Jewish disabilities: §. should be
sorry to see the Upper House proceeding thus skittishly in its discus-
sions: but we think LoRD BROUGHAM is rather too severe when he
would limit the powers of their minds to the admission of one solitary
subject in a single evening. We must accuse him of unmerited sarcasm
when he looks at the intellect of the Peerage as a sort of vacancy for
the admission of one, and one only, per night, of the many topics claimi
their attention.
On Orreries' Heads Orreries Accumulate.
In the ensuing week we are promised at the Haymarket a new
Orrery with mine additional planets. Every year the Solar System
seems to come out stronger and stronger; and we understand that
arrangements have been made for 1852, by which the spirited Astro
nomer will secure the whole of the thirteen new moons that will have
made their débuts in the year that is now passing. We are told that
the proprietor is in treaty with several Stars, and that terms have been
offered to the great bear at the Zoological to represent Ursa Major for
one week only.
So great is the appetite for novelty on the part of the º: that an
Orrery has really no chance unless an extra comet or a few additional
moons can be secured; and we are happy to congratulate, the Astro-
nomer on his prospects for the present season, which enables him to
advertise no less than NINE NEw PLANETs.

POT-LUCK FOR LORD STANLEY.

indulged in respecting the STANLEY “banquet:”—
“Some of our contemporaries are, or feign to be, surprised that Lond STANLEY did
not, immediately after dinner, at Merchant Tailors' Hall, direct Messrs. BATHE & Co.
to lay on the table, with the first bottle of claret, copies of every bill which he might,
d, could, or would have brought in, had he succeeded in forming an Administra-
tion when the present Cabinet first tumbled to pieces. The Times, more particularly,
seems to think that the Toast-master ought to have read them through, paragraph by
ph, and that the assembled convives would have done well to have discussed on
º: spot their possible political bearing, instead of their Burgundy and biscuits.”
... We can, fancy the hysterical laugh with, which the ruined agricul:
turists will deride the idea of their party’s “first bottle”, of claret, and
of its having, “discussed” Burgundy and biscuits. A likely joke this,

poverished representatives went as far as they could in treating them:
selves to good wholesome beer, and will say that how they could afford
even that humble beverage was wonderful, considering the Malt-tax.
HOCUS POCUS REFORM.
LoRD JOHN RUSSELL has been trying a little conjuring, to remedy
the shortness of judicial hands in the Courts of Equity. fe PREMIER
has evidently heard, with unusual respect, the old project of the Irish-
man who tried to lengthen a blanket, º: cutting a piece off the bottom
to add it to the top; and on the story being told him, LoRD JoHN has
apparently exclaimed—“Ha, ha! an excellent idea. £gadi I’ll try it !
I’ll cut a Judge off the Rolls, and placing him over the CHAN-
gELLOR, for appeals, I’ll increase the number of Judges, by taking one
from the bottom, and putting him at the top of the Court.”
The Minister seems also to have studied in the itinerant school of
the individual who, at fairs, twists a single sheet of paper into a multi-
licity of forms. floºd John, taking the existing judicial materials,
#. them about, and serves them up—or purposes, rather, to serve
them up—in different forms, by way of making more of them. We are
afraid this melancholy expedient arises from the cowardly fear which
has taken possession of Government in these days, and prevents it
from providing for the efficiency of the public service, lest a salary
more or less for a really working man should be grudged. We can
assure LoRD JoHN that he is not ºf the public by curtailing the
fair proportion of workers; but there is left ample scope for his econo-
mising operations among the drones.
An Enormous Cabbage.
ATAILOR, living at Middleton, near Manchester, cut out of a Spanish
cloak sufficient to make a º suit for three of his boys, a waist-
coat for a fourth, a cap for a fifth, a Polkajacket for his wife, and a pair of
gaiters for himself! This is the largest cabbage ever known on record

“Magna est Veritas, et praevalebit.”
“The Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth.”
-- “To the Editor of Punch.
“IN refutation of the calumny that ascribes to the Roman
Catholic priesthood an influence unfavourable to the political and social
vancement of a nation under its control, allow me to refer you to the
history and present state of Ireland—subjects whereon the most extra-
ordinary misconceptions prevail.
“Before St. PATRICK converted the Irish to the holy faith of Rome,
they were a set of miserable savages, but one degree elevated above
the brute. Indeed, they are said to have gone actually on all fours;
but I will not venture to vouch for the correctness of this last assertion;
º scrupulously anxious to confine all my statements strictly to
act.
“The heathen Irish lived in wretched mud cabins, which were shared
with their pigs, by those who were so fortunate as to possess any.
Their numbers were scanty, owing to the circumstance that they were
cannibals, and that they subsiste , in a great measure, on one another;
otherwise, the sole diet of the majority consisted of that precarious
root, the potato, which they ate raw. *
º Ireland, at this period, was ravaged by monstrous reptiles, amongst
which were dragons, exceeding, in size the largest Crocodiles, and
serpents bigger than boa constrictors, and highly venomous.
“The #. of St. PATRICK at once converted the wild Irish into
a civilised people. He persuaded them to leave off their relations as
food, instructed them in agriculture and the rearing of cattle, and not
only introduced the use of fish, but taught them to eat it with silver
forks, into which he had miraculously changed their wooden skewers.
“The Saint also, as is well known, banished all the snakes and dragons
into the bogs, where their skeletons are occasionally, dug up, bein
. º remains of extinct saurians and ophidians by infide
geologists.
“From that time to this, the career of Ireland—interrupted only by
aggressions on the part of Saxon heretics—has been one of tº:
ress, and has been marked in the most singular manner by freedom
rom those civil discords that chequer the prosperity of other and less
favoured nations. -
“At the present moment we behold, in that blessed land, a spectacle
of moral elevation and material greatness. Fields waving with corn
attest the perfection of agriculture. Inexhaustible peat bogs, by the
aid of chemistry and capital, are converted into mines, yielding bound-
less wealth. 1nnumerable man ries are transmutin into
clothing for all the nations of the earth. Fisheries, everywhere estab-
lished by judicious enterprise along the coast, are continually deriving
from the teeming ocean an abundance of wholesome, and nutritious
food. Landlords, uniformly resident, are devoting all their energies to
the improvement of their estates, and of the condition of their tenants.

“Strife and dissension are unknown; ev
kindness . and are, indeed, carried to such an extent, that blessin
are invoked by every mouth and every pen-and especially in the gentle
and amiable journals-on the heads of the bitterest and most cruel
enemies of the Irish race. Of course I allude to the malignant and
pitiless English people, who, lately, when the food of millions of Irish-
men had been destroyed by the Legislation of LoRD John Russelſ,
refused to contribute a single farthing to relieve the distress of their
suffering and injured brethren.
“But, foremost among the attributes which render Ireland a model
nation, is that noble sentiment which abhors and scorns deceit, prevari-

Irish character, it is scrupulous adherence to veracity.
“The blessings of education are everywhere diffused by an enlightened

a band of grave and reverend Senators, who never allow factious con-

state of Ireland, which is so entirely opposed to my faithful and accurate
account of it?. From wilful misrepresentation?... Far be it from me to
say that, sensitive as I myself feel to any imputation on my own credit.
No! . It is occasioned by a most extraordinary and almost incredible

ELECTRO-BIOLOGY; OR, THE LAST NEW FUDGE.
The moral a sophagus or gullet of the fashionable-world would seem
to be of large dimensions—developed in relation to an appetite for the
marvellous. At all events, there is observable, in genteel society, a
certain extraordinary power of deglutition. Witness the extensive
facility with which homoeopathy—clairvoyance–magic crystals,
Puseyism—have been swallowed by the superior classes. The bolus
just at present coming into vogue appears to be." Electrº-Biology.”
Mr. Punch lately witnessed an exhibition of this so-called “science.”
A number of persons, taken indiscriminately from among the spectators;
were seated together in chairs. Each h laced in his palm a bit o
metal, on which he was to stare. After the lapse of some minutes, the
operator went round, and passed his hand across their foreheads. In
... a quarter of an hour he desired those who had their eyes closed
to remain; the rest to depart. A remarkable clearance instantly took
place of all of the party that looked respectable and intelligent; leaving
a very suspicious and unprepossessing residuum. Then ensued a
series of “experiments” similar to those reported in the Morning
Post of Friday last, as having been exhibited at Willis's Rooms, in
the presence of beholders,
“Respectable in point of numbers, and exceedingly select and fashionable in charac.
ter; several noblemen, members of Parliament, and officers of high rank being
present.”
This select and fashionable assembly was diverted, according to our
º, with the following extraordinary phenomena, amongst
others:-
“Upon the two more susceptible subjects Dr. DARLING produced some very remark-
able effects, preventing them at first from speaking, except at his pleasure, and then so
far affecting their memories as to render them incapable of remembering the name of
the place in which they were, or even of the metropolis itself. In addition to this, he
placed the hands of each lightly together in front †. person, and, at the word of the
operator, the person found himself unable to take his hands apart. One hand of each
gentleman was then laid upon the hand of the other, and the combined strength of the
two could not separate them.”
These persons were also apparently rendered unable to walk—to rise
—to sit—and then,
“To crown all, after the patients had been allowed to resume their seats, they were
made to find those seats so insufferably hot, that they could not retain their places upon
them.”
Thus, by means of Electro-Biology, one might give another a drubbing
without committing an assault, and offer him somewhat more than a
mere insult, by bidding him consider himself horsewhipped.
The “patients” were likewise induced to mistake pure water, on
tasting it, successively, for wormwood, honey, and champagne; the
#|the result was, that the arm of the “patient” sank, in spite of manifest
evidence for the reality of these impressions resting on their words and
their grimaces. Others, on a previous evening, had been made to fancy
a sovereign a halfpenny, and a gentleman a horse, and to imagine a
tumbler of clean water to be full of enormous reptiles. . .
Now, in the Electro-biological performance which Mr. Punch wit-
nessed, there was an actor-or “patient”—whose arm, it was alleged,
could be stiffened at will by the operator. When it was so stiffened,
the “patient” declared himself absolutely unable to put his arm down.
Some medical men present suggested the test, of trying—against some
one not Electro-biologised—which could keep the arm extended longest.
A compact and muscular gentleman, present undertook the contest; and
effort, whilst the gentleman's continued to be held out, amid the cheers
of the lookers-on. So much, ". Mr. Punch, for Electro Biology:
But the wonders of Electro-Biology are not novel. Doubtless it was
in the Electro-biological state that Polonius, at the suggestion of
Hamlet, pronounced a cloud, in succession, to be like a camel and a
weasel, and, lastly, “very like a whale.”

A STRANGE MAN JUST DISCOWERED IN

T has been mentioned in the Ger-

from some unknown .
and speaking a jargon scarcely

German philologists, has lately
made his appearance at Frank-
fort on the Oder, where, of

the care of the police.

- knows how, in a remote and
extremely quiet German city,
are described by all persons as
most singular. In height he is
about five feet six inches, his
- hair is white, his face sallow, his
beard red—that on his upper lip
- not so much grown as that on
his cheeks: his hands are large and dirty: his teeth useful, his appetite
great, and his thirst constant.
*His dress is most extraordinary and barbarous. On his head he
wears, a covering of a snuff-brown colour, in shape something like a
wash-basin—which it would be very, advisable that he should use for
his face and hands. Round his neck, which is º ugly and
bare, he wears a strip of a shinin stuff, spun out of worms, he says, in
his own country, and called an Alberti; it is puffed in two bows round
his cheeks, and gives him a highly absurd appearance.

rancorous odour of what he calls ‘bac º
when asked its name, by BURGERMEistER von HUMPFFENSTRUMPFFEN
—the nondescript called a “Minorimosy;’ and, holding up his out-
stretched hand three times, cried out the syllable “Bob,” and wagged
his head; from which the Burgomaster concluded that “bob” is the
*of a coin of the country.
* Hi
of glass; and in the pockets, were found bits of paper, which the
nondescript, tried to explain—by the words ‘Ungle,” tickor,” “spowt,
&c.—and showed by his gestures that the F. were to him of
considerable value. They are greasy, and, to alſ appearances, worthless,
coarsely printed, and marked with rude manuscript numerals. It is con-
jectured that they may form part of the paper-money of his country.
“Beyond these tokens, no coin of any kind was found on the non-
from which he struggled vio-
descript's person.
“Under the glass-buttoned garment -
lently not to be divested, the stranger had on two other very singular
articles of costume. One was very ragged, and evidently old, and
govered with printed, figures in pink, representing Bayaderes dancing.
Over this was a small piece of stuff worked with the needle, and once
white-the name of which, after repeated and severe interrogatories
he said was “Dicki.” It has been carried to the Museum, an §
between the breastplate of a Turkish vizier and the corslet of a knight
of the middle ages.
“His lower dress was of a broad check pattern, something resembling
the stuff which is worn by the Scottish Highlanders, who, however, it
is known, do not use braceae, whence it is evident that the stranger
cannot be one of these. When the Burgomaster pointed to these, the
nghdescript wagged his head, pleased seemingly, and said the word
‘Stunnin,” which the clerk took down.
“On his feet were a sort of short boot with large iron heels, in which
he began to execute a queer dance before the Court, clinking the heels
together, and turning the toes fantastically in and out—pointing to this
boot with the cane which he carries in his mouth, he winked to the
clerk, and said Hylo;' but then presently looking round the room, and
seeing a portrait of the late Field-Marschall PRINCE OF WALLstadt, he
ran up to it, and said—“BLookER! BlookER!’ and danced once more.
“What relation can there be between the nondescript's boot and the
late gallant and venerated MARshAL Forwards, who destroyed Bona-
FARTE, after the latter had defeated and taken the HERzog v.
WELLINGTON prisoner at the battle of Mount St. John?
“At this stage of the examination, and having been allowed to resume
all his clothes, the stranger pointed to his ...i and laid his hand on his
is outer garment was aloose, shaggy vest, made out of the skins!'
This outer dress–
s next garment, one without sleeves, was decorated with buttons||
stomach, crying out the monosyllable “Grub,” which, DR. BLINKHoRN
thinks must mean food in his language. Accordingly, a sausage, some
bread, and a can of beer were brought, of the first of which he partook
greedily, devouring the whole bread and sausage. It was observed that
heate with his fork, not with his knife, as we Germans do.
“Having tasted the drink, he, however, laid it down, making very
wry faces, and calling out the word ‘Swipey, Swipey,” twice, which was
taken down. And then, by more faces and contortions, he made us to
understand as if the beer had disagreed with him, º which the ex-
cellent Burgermeister, having a bottle of Rhum in the cupboard, gave
* i. a. glass, who smacked it off at once, crying out the word
Olyby) ingo.
“‘Jo º was ist denn Jollybijingo?’ asked his worship, con-
jecturing with his usual acuteness, that this was the savage's for
hum of Jamaica. “Wilt thqu have yet a glass Jollibijingo?’ And his
Honour ſº out a second glass, which the nondescript seized, and
tossed off this time, exclaiming
“‘Aybaleaveyermibawawawy'
“Which expression being accurately taken down, his worship the Bur-
ermeister considered the examination sufficient, and sent off the
oreigner under the guard of Gendarmes Bºrtz and Wºrter to Berlin.
“A true copy. Signed HUMPFFENSTRUMPFF, Burgomaster.

From the Berlin Tagblatt.
“The named SNooks, Bartholomaeus Student, out of Smithfield,
London, was brought hither in custody, from Frankfort on the Oder;
where, being tipsy, he had lost himself, allowing the train to go away
without him. SNooks was handed over to the British Minister here,
and will return to London as soon as any one will lend or give him
funds for that purpose.”
THE WRONGS OF PIMLICO.
UPPose, in making Pro Bono
Pimlico synonymous with
Pro Bono Publico, so good a
Mrs. Malapropism has not
been perpetrated as we used
to imagine. The good of
the public is more closely
identified with the good of
Pimlico than has been
hitherto supposed; and a
recent letter in the Times
has shown what a nuisance
is inflicted upon the former,
y an inconvenience caused
to the latter. A complaint
has been made that every
vehicle having to make its
way from Pimlico to St.
James's Street, must go
miles round about, because
none but the privileged few,
who are, in this instance,
the very privileged and the
| very few, can be permitted
to drive past the front of
Buckingham Palace. What
harm can be done, does not
appear; for, although the
travelling, of troAAol, would
have to go before the royal windows, there is such a longun intervallum
enclosed within iron railings, that anything like contamination would
be quite impossible. -- -
W. are sure that HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE are quite ignorant
of the inconvenience entailed upon the public, in their names, as it
were, and for the apparent indulgence of a hº spirit of selfish ex-
clusiveness on their parts, which we verily believe neither of them
to possess... We make very little doubt that when the royal couple are
reading their next week's Punch-asthey no doubt do read, it by turns,
out loud to each other, at breakfast-they will cause inquiries into the
subject to be made forthwith; and if the complaint proves to be well
founded, we will answer for its being immediately remedied. In the
mean time, we can give a hint to the public, to enable them to cºmbine
loyalty with convenience, by taking a short, cut through the prohibited
ground, not only without any disrespect, but with decided respect to
the Sovereign. All visitors to the Palace are to enter by the gate in
front, and consequently a person wishing to ºut through, and save a
mile or so, going and returning between Pimlico, and the Stable-yard
gate, has only to say he is going to call at the Palace, and by leaving a
card, he will at the same time, satisfy the rigid claims of etiquette, and
considerably shorten his own journey.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
A CHRISTIAN HERO.-HIS CROSS AND LLJCIFER-BOX.
r_ HE world knows nothing of
<º its greatest º says Poet
TAYLOR ; Poet Wordsworth
—see Ercursion—having said
the same thing before him.
Here is the Rev. PETER DALY,
Catholic priest of the town of
Galway, burning like a lamp in
a sepulchre, when he ought to
shine like a star in the firma-
ment. DALY made a truly
heroic speech— a real poteen
oration—last week at a dinner
in Galway; in which speech he
crumbled Lord John Russell
to dust, crumbled him as a
giant's fingers would crumble
pound-cake. And then DALY
said that in '48 he had given
advice that would have over-
turned England–
-- roposed that there should
be ºNº. men -
each man like himself / / /–and that
forty of these should be sent to Liver-
pool, thirty to Bristol, and thirty to
portsmouth, and on a certain day and
hour to set fire to and burn down the
English fleet 1 and at one blow de-
stroy the government.”
The proposal was heroic; but where get a hundred men of such sublime, ennobling
º: as oriest Daiyº We doubt whether even Ireland—prolific mother of Christian
leroes—could supply them. Nevertheless, the mind is uplifted and enlarged by a contempla-
tion of the picture painted in flames by the hero that might have been. Beautiful, º:
to imagine the advent of DALY to our shores;...to, see him—the teacher ºf peace an
ood-will to all men—with his cross and his lucifer-box, land on the quay of all-unconscious
iverpool; to watch him with his midnight, panther tread, stealing down to the docks, and
then—and then to see the heavens red with conflagration!
Ought we not to love Ireland, that gives us such priestly goodness-ought we not to hug
to our bosoms a faith of which such men are the depositaries, and ought we not as Englishmen
to be especially proud of the contempt—the offspring of our strength—that takes no more heed
of the gabble of such wretches than the lion heeds the vermin that shelter in his mane?
EXTRAORDINARY PROTESTANT DELUSIONSl
ºt “Tell truth, and shame the devil.”—Shakspeare.
3.
“WITH your permission, I will redeem my promise to explain the nature of that
astounding delusion which makes Protestant heretics mistake the garden of the world, happy
Ireland, for a land of poverty, disorder, contention, turbulence, filth, fraud, mendicity,
mendacity, and wretchedness. - -
“First, Mr. Punch, let me request you to take a pea. And a thimble P. No, Sir.
Take a pea without a thimble, or take any other round substance of equal size. Cross
the two first fingers of either hand. Rub the pea, or the pellet, between your crossed fingers.
You will fancy that * feel two peas or pellets, though the fact is that you have only one.
Don't take my word for this, unless you please. T should scorn to deceive you; but try
the experiment, if you doubt the assertion. - -
“Again, you are probably aware, that although you think you see the setting sun in a
line with your eyes, natural philosophy demonstrates that it is below the horizon, and
that a large portion of the globe intervenes between the solar luminary and the visual
or of Mr. Punch. -
“As I pique myself on my candour, I must fairly tell you that these two illustrations are
not my own. They belong to our great controversialist, the late Bishop MILNER, and were
cited by him in confutation of the heretical position advanced by DR. Ponteus, a Protestant
Bishop of LONDON, that "If we cannot believe our senses, we can believe nothing.” The
º TILLOTsoN had before maintained, the same error; and the object of either pseudo-
prelate was to subvert a dogma of infallibility, attacked also by that rogue and thief of the
world, SwiFT, in the dinner-scene between PETER, MARTIN, and JACK, which occurs in the
fourth Section of A Tale of a Tub.
“Now, Sir, just as DR. MILNER's pea imposes on your touch, shall it disabuse your under-
standing; exactly as his setting sun bamboozles your sight, shall it undeceive your mind.
“No doubt the spectacle of Irish evil and misery is true for you, Irish peasantry appear to
you to starve and be evicted; Irish landlords to be shot from behind hedges; Irish partisans
to fight and murder one another; and, I dare say, even the scrupulous veracity of the Irish
people generally, seems to you to be questionable. Your perceptions, inform you that loyal
newspapers, such as the Tablet, foment ill-will and treason, and that honourable gentlemen,
like MR. REYNoLDs, declare themselves ready to vote right wrong, in order to spite Ministers.
“But, Mr. Punch, facts, undeniable, indubitable facts, as all these phenomena are apparently
to you, the truth is, that they are mere hallucinations—as unreal and absurd as the fancies
of any lunatic at Hanwell. They are no more to be trusted than the duplicity of MILNER's pea.
“These false perceptions, in fact, are the work of the Arch-Enemy of mankind; and #.
are only a small part of a grand system of im-
posture, which he has for ages practised on his
slaves and dupes—Protestant heretics.
“You have often wondered, doubtless, at what
you regard as, our wilful, blindness, in j
those historical records which impute bloodshe
and perseeution to our Church. , But the Church
never did persecute, or shed blood. Neither
have your historians altogether deceived you, I
grant that JoHN Huss, JEROME OF PRAGUE,
LATIMER, HoopeK, RIDLEY, CRANMER, did cer-
tainly appear to be burnt at the stake. The
crusade against the ALBIGENSEs, the massacre
of the HUGUENOTs, the living and human holo-
causts of the Inquisition, I admit, seemingly
occurred. But all these horrors were only phan-
tasms. Just so the crimes imputed to holy
ALEXANDER WI., whom you irreverently call old
Borgia, were imaginary. He died in the odour
of sanctity, and not from poison which he had
caused to be mixed for a Cardinal
“It is true that some of our writers—to
humour your illusions—have owned to persecu-
tion on the side of the civillpower, distinguish-
ing between the State and the Church. But
I would never stoop to evasion, however pious.
There is nothing like sticking to the plain truth;
which is, that every auto-dafā that has been
apparently witnessed, has been a mere appear-
ance, as also has every semblance of punishment
inflicted on the score of religion—except in Pagan
and Protestant countries. -
“You will ask how you are to judge of the
truth or falsehood of the evidence of your senses?
Heretical philosophers will tell you that the
errors of one sense are, corrected by the testi-
mony of the rest, and will cite Bishop MILNER's
pea and sunset to prove the very reverse of his
argument. Our Church, however, declares that
our senses may be altogether deceived, with
t. assurance, only, to convince you of the mis-
e.
“You are to know, then, that all the atrocities
of which History accuses her, are as visionary
as the air-drawn #; of MACBETH; spectres
conjured up #. diabolical artifice to induce you
to resist the Holy See. I trust that I have now
for ever dissipated those amazing delusions, and
that you will immediately become converted to
the Truth as it is in
“WERAX.”
Sidney for Slaughter-Houses. |
IN the debate on Smithfield, MR, ALDERMAN
SIDNEY is reported to have told the House of
Commons that, as to the question of removing
slaughter-houses from the Metropolis, ;
“If the House were prepared to deal with it, they must
be prepared to deal with at least, 1500 butchers of this
Metropolis.”
Very well. Of course, the butchers, will be
only too happy.
The “Lodge," Taunton.
WE understand that, in consideration of late
events, Docton HENDREN (soi-disant Bishop of
Clifton, and Shepherd of the “Lodge”) will be
empowered to change the name of that numery.
Henceforth, for “Lodge,” read “Dodge.”
Affecting Sacrifice.
SIR CHARLEs WooD said “he would rather
cut off his right hand” than attempt to transfer
the poor's rate to the Consolidated Fund. The
excision might be a sacrifice to the Minister him
self, but of no awaii whatever to the country.
Make even Barºneus Chancellor of the É:
chequer, and let him, in a fit of generous
insanity, cut off ninety-nine of his hands, would
there not still remain the hundredth to pick our
pockets of the Income Tax?

RELIGIOUS HOUSES BILL.
We applaud MR. H. GRATTAN; son of a great man—as the mistletoe
is the child of the oak. Wereverence the mild wisdom—the gentleness
and dignity of the Irish Member. Would he, for only one day a week,
consent to show himself in the Crystal Palace—under, a second glass
case to keep the flies off—as a model senator, to the delighted delegates
of the whole universe?, MR. GRATTAN's last contribution of wisdom—
his latest pearl at the time of our going to press—was on the Religious
Houses Bill. He called the bill “atrocious.” He also expressed a
benignant, wish that “some Honourable Members would go to these
religious houses to get good sense, goodf , and good manners.”
The wish was kind; and no doubt certain members might “get” the
estimable qualities spoken of by the Honourable, Member, with this
proviso—if MR. GRATTAN himself has not already carried them all
away; for where else could he have got such abounding good sense,
good feeling, and good manners, that on every public occasion break
out—thick as a rash—upon him? With respect to the Religious
Houses, if nunneries are still to be permitted in º: we earnestly
hope that a law will be passed legalising fences for the receipt of stolen
goods. We can scarcely think it fair that IKEY SOLOMONs should be
transported for buying thefts, and that IKEY HENDREN should be
allowed to kidnap young virgins, value £80,000!
The Exhibition and the Church.
A coRRESPONDENT of the Times suggests, “that a form of prayer be
H. and used in all Churches, on the last Sunday, in April,” for a
lessing on the Exhibition. We heartily second the thought; addin
this suggestion—“That, in penance of his abuse of the aforesai
Exhibition,Co.LONEL SIBTHORP be further prepared and used in a white
sheet in the body of St. Paul's, with a four-pound dip in either hand,
and a copy of his Parliamentary philippics, printed in large letters, hung
about his neck.”
GAZETTE EXTRAORDINARY.
WE are un-authorised to state that Royal permission will be granted
for a change of name to ALDHRMAN SIDNEY, who, as emphatically the
§: riend, will be allowed to take the appellation of ALDERMAN
IDNEY.
The Metropolitan Members.
THESE gentlemen seem to patronise any ancient annoyance, so it be
of London. Last year they ºl. the Cemetery #. for the
undertakers. This session they stand up for Smithfield. In time, we
fear, it may become a question, whether, among other crying nuisances
to be got rid of, there is not the nuisance of Metropolitan Members!
of battle — is dare
THE BRITISH LION AND THE FRENCHSOCIALISTS.
A Few persons have been foolish enough to fear that the British
Lion was preparing to submit its nose to the fingers of the foreign
Socialists, . We can answer for our old friend, the B. L., that he will
turn up, his nose a very great deal too high to allow of any liberty
being taken with a feature which is so serviceable to him in smelling a
rat, or getting scent of anything else, in which he has a real interest.
Socialism, is in far too bad odour for the nose of the British Lion to
have anything to do, either with it or its champions. The old women
of England.ought to be very much obliged to LEDRU Rollin and his
Socialist allies of all nations, for their recent manifesto, in which they
condescend to tell us that they do not mean to set England in a blaze,
nor overthrow the Government.
... We should like to catch them at it; or rather we should like a
single policeman to catch them at it. A night in the station-house,
and six weeks in the Fields of Cold-bath, would sufficiently damp any
revolutionary fire with which they might feel disposed to burn us out,
or enlighten us. We should like to see the LEDRU Ro LINITEs—who
droye our English workpeople out of France, and robbed them of their
sayings;--we should like to see these gentry attempting to lead our
intelligent artisans by the nose, into the same mess in which industry
now is in France, where employment is almost stopped, and where
liberty does not exist, even in name; for it is an offence punishable by
law—free republican law-to speak of it. -
But LEDRU Rollin does not mean to abuse our hospitality. “All
the better for him,” is all we have to say upon that question. So long
as the foreign Socialists pay their British washerwoman, if they employ
one, their British milk-score, and all their other expenses, which we
say they do—for “ready money” is most likely #. basis of their
transactions with our British working classes and tradesmen—we have
no objection to any number of aliens that our lodging letters can
accommodate. But once let any of these fellows try in this country
any of their Parisian pranks among themselves, for we will not insult
a single Englishman by supposing he would be such a spooney as to
join, -once let the foreign Socialists try any of their cut-throat or cut-
purse dodges here, and off they go in the hands of those bugbears to
rogues and thieves-the proper authorities.
PUNCH TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON.
MR. PUNCH presents his compliments to his Grace of London, and
having read the QUEEN's Letter to the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY, in
which her Majesty, among other wise hopes, trusts that all Bishops will
“by a judicious exercise of their authority and simplicity of the faith and
worship of our Reformed Church,” &c. &c.—
Mr. Punch having read the above, begs to put to his Grace of London
four questions:– -
* Aulolº—ºrical authority—derived merely from episcopal
Wea
II. Is Christian simplicity best shown in a Bishop's banker's book,
Or . a ºn other book, in which bankers are, at times, irreverently
Spoken of :
III. Is the best foundation of Christian episcopacy some £300,000
per annum (ground-rents included)?
IV. Finally, if it be so, will the BIs Hop or LoNDoN, at his bestleisure,
return to Punch the market-price of locusts and wild-honey at Fulham P
ORLD'S FAIR OFFER—Gentlemen in Belgravia, who, under the
signatures of “PIMLicoLA,” “J. O.,” &c., are writing to the Times newspaper,
describing the discomforts which they are likely to experience in the quarter from the
great crowds of strangers and omnibuses which will infest the Crystal Palace during
the Exhibition, are respectfully informed that MEssRs. W. QUITTs AND Co. have a
Register of Houses for exchange and letting. A House in Red Lion Square will be let by
a desirable Family, in exchange for an abode in Belgravia—without premium.—A noble
Mansion in Bloomsbury Square is offered to Families desirous of quitting Belgrave
Square or Grosvenor Place for the season. Premium for the season, £200.-A Lady
(daughter of a Colonel of the Grand Army) who receives twenty-four select Boarders
at her Mansion, Rue de l'Eau, Boulogne-sur-Mer, will be happy, during the ensuing
season, to change Houses with any English'Nobleman or Gentleman whose premises
are large, and whose respectability is undoubted.
No EXHIBITION RABBLE –Persons desirous of quiet, and to avoid the
vulgarity and noise of the Exhibition, are requested to examine the Registers of
MEssas. Swope AND Co., High Street, Islington, where the Nobility will find com-
modious Mansions in the most respectable Neighbourhood, in the finest air.
Tº FAMILIES QUITTING PIMLICO.-The Proprietors of the Blue
Pig Horrl, Smithfield, respectfully suggest to Belgravian Families quitting the
Pimlico end of the Metropolis, a visit to the Blue Pig Hotel. The B. P. H. is situated in
the most eligible and open quarter of the town—in a district proverbially healthy and
lively. The B. P. H. is within an easy distance of the principal Theatres and Houses of
Parliament. The (Central) Courts of Law are close to the B.P.H., and the Magnificent
National Fane of St. Paul's (from which the Bishop of London has Not yet—as at
Pimlico—ordered the cross to be taken down, is at hand; where divine worship may be
attended at the small charge of Twopence entrance and a shilling for the Verger. The
Proprietors of the B.P. H. will undertake to board Families in the most comfortable and
fashionable manner, including Tea for Ladies eight times a day.

And why they played before their dolles so often on their knees.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 161
YAN KEE DOODLE IN 1851. According to the “New York Weekly Herald.”
YANKEE DOODLE’s come to town,
To see the Exhibition,
And strike a blow at England's Crown,
By stirring up sedition.
The New York Weekly Herald see,
Whose Editor’s a noodle,
Or QUEEN VICTORIA’s throne will be
Upset by YANKEE DooDLE.
Chorus-YANREE DooDLE, doodle, &c.
Old JoHN BULL, our wares to show,
Invites our glorious nation,
And we’ve accepted, no ways slow,
The loafer's invitation.
We’ve produce to display, that shall
Amaze your cotton-spinner,
Our native raw ma-te-ri-al—
Our muscle, bone, and sinner.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
That there stuff, them genuine goods,
The sile of Freedom reared on,
Cut out an empire from the woods,
The greatest ever heerd on.
Light work to fell the British Oak,
For arms with might so gifted
The sleeves is tucked up for the stroke,
I guess the axe is lifted.
Chorus.-YANREE DooDLE, &c.
YANKEE DooDLE, in a ship, .
Is come from New York city,
And if he should repent his trip,
I reckon it’s a pity; .
Of Socialists he brings a crew,
To kindle agitation;
Reds, Chartists, Anti-rentists, too,
Who'll preach repudiation.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
Socialistic tracts, much more
Combustible than rockets,
Are stuffed, with bowie-knives in store,
In YANKEE DOODLF's pockets.
With schemes and projects for a new
Britannic constitution,
And plenty of revolvers, tu
}. the revolution.
Chorus.-YANKEE DOODLE, &c.
YANKEE DooDLE builds his hopes
Upon the great dissensions
Of Britishers about the Pope's
Aggression and pretensions;
On Manufacture's every seat
So ready for rebelling
For very hunger—now that wheat
At such a price is selling!
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
YANKEE DooDLE is no fool,
He's up to all that’s doing,
Full well he knows what Liverpool
And Manchester are brewing;
Their own republic they’re to form,
And cut the QUEEN’s connexion;
And he intends to guide the storm,
And lead the insurrection.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
A mob once sack'd the Tuileries,
Another might the Palace,
I realise, with ect ease,
And never mind the gallows.
To get the troops engaged in Town
In quelling this commotion,
And then on Manchester drop down,
Is YANKEE DooDLE’s motion.
Chorus.-YANKEE DooDLE, &c.
YANREE DooDIE’s come to town,
all his force and power,
He means to burn the Abbey down,
Bank, Parliament, and Tower.
Oh! yes—and fire the Thames as well,
Or, my! what fibs e-tarnal
That catawampous print do tell!
Our screamin' New York jarnal.
Chorus.-YANKEE DoodLE, &c.
CURIOUS DIARY.
THE other day, the police reports were lighted up by an extraordinary
gleam of sentimental interest. A swindler of no #: fraudulency
was found to have kept a journal in which his “doings” assumed quite
a pious and serious aspect. Devotion was associated with the ruin of
ers, and the victimisation of coal-merchants. The whole, too, was
tinged with a certain ludicrous pathos. , MELPoMENE's robes were used
to wrap up the firewood, fish, sofas, chairs, and champagne gained from
credulous tradesmen.—Now, by a curious accident, we have come in
ssession of another Diary. It was picked up in the neighbourhood of
owning Street !
“Monday. Brought on our Budget.
Fortune will not quite desert us. - - -
“Tuesday. Mob crying, ‘Give us pure coffee,” all day. , Got in a crisis.
Nothing from Irish members... Attempt to turn us out by STANLEY.
“Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, &c. Crisis, as usual. No help from

We are inclined to believe that the unhappy party will be on a very
serious trial before long.
A BRAY FROM SMITHFIELD.
“My DEAR KNIGHTLEy
“I AM not one of the common cattle. I am merely an Ass;
and, as such, in the course of my long life—(asses, †† know, seldom
die)—I have been sold many times, in Smithfield. I have, therefore,
some knowledge of that serene and tranquil spot. ... And, SIR CHARLEs,
ou were right in your beautiful speech in Parliament t'other night.
here never teas, any accident in Smithfield: bullocks never were
crowded or goaded; and as for being driven through London, they liked
it—they had, at least, a glimpse of life before they were introduced to
the butchers; and if they did toss a few old women, the old women
themselves liked, the operation; however, in the hospitals they might
F. to complain of it. Again, as you beautifully observed, Smith-
eld was not a fine l question, fine ladies never being out of their
beds when the market begins; and nursery-maids—as you touchingly
remarked—with their babies, had no business near the pens.
4. . am I that your beautiful speech did not have its full reward;
nevertheless, should the franchise extended to my order depend
upon it you shall have, at the next election for Northamptonshire, the
voice of “Yours truly, * A DONKEY.”
Everybody grumbling. Hope
POISON IN THE PAPERS.
A CERTAIN young gentleman, a few years ago, in passing through a
somewhat disreputable thoroughfare, was moved by the fervour of
indignant decency to smash some windows wherein were exhibited
divers prints and pictures of continental character and vile, tendency.
The zealous youth, by this act, obtained considerable sympathy, and no
little applause. The precedent, however, was dangerous; and really, if
among the rising generation there are many such ingenuous and spirited
yo fellows, it will be expedient that some particularly strong iron-
wire lattice or screen-work should be put up in front of the windows of
our newspaper offices. • *
The details of evidence, as exemplified by a recent instance, in
actions brought by gentlemen who have been injured in their marital
capacities, may give a zest to the breakfast of a man about town, but
are certainly very undesirable accompaniments to the coffee and rolls,
or tea and toast, eggs, rashers, Yarmouth bloaters, or Finnon haddocks,
of which comestibles wives and daughters are the ers. It is not
easy to conceive what manner of persons such disclosures can edify,
except brutal sensualists, forensic students, morbid anatomists of human
nature, and very º explorers of the theology of PETER DENs,
A rather more sketchy, style of reporting trials involving details of
roſligacy and vice, would much increase the eligibility of our journals
or family perusal.
“Club Snoring.”
Such is the title of a pathetic complaint addressed by a sufferer from
the “Alfred Club,” to the Post, touching certain members who will
snore; and innocently asking of the Editor of the P. to abate the
nuisance. We think the evil may be met by practically carrying out the
subjºined resolution,--
“Whereas, Certain members are given to stertorous habits, to the
annoyance of members wide-awake; be it enacted, that the Waiters, on
report of any Member snoring, shall henceforth be empowered, one and
. to–pull his nose.”
CORK HORSES.
..THE Cork journals announce an epidemic among the horses of that
city; and marvel at its origin. e, in our t marvel at their
ignorance. Was it not LoRD JoHN RUssell, who insinuated the
cholera into Ireland 2–it can be no other than he (but this we state in
confidence) who sends the glanders upon Ireland's horses. For further
information, apply to the members of the “Synod of Thurles.”
- A Pocket Protector.
A LADY-yes, a lady—has invented an elastic ring (elastic, we pre-
sume, as opposed to that gold ring) for the protection of our pockets.
Any hand intruding therein, will be immediately caught. In how many
ockets will the hand of the CHANCELLOR of the Excheques be laid
old of, “picking” the poor Clerk’s Income-Tax!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
MR. BRIggs Is WEIGHRD, of course.
CAXTON'S GHOST TO DR, MILMAN.
“MY DEAR DEAN,
“BEFORE your promotion from St. Margaret's, Westminster,
to the Cathedral, St. Paul’s, you stirred yourself in the laudable
endeavour to erect a monument of some sort to the memory of the first
English printer-namely, myself, WILLIAM CAxton. Now, we here in
the Shades—whatever your mundane philosophy may say to the con-
trary—are very much interested in the memories we leave behind us;
very susceptible of the ill-treatment that,the ingratitude of posterity
visits upon us. Thus, NEIsoN now and then fires up, as he could fire,
when from a new-comer he learns the unfinished condition of his
column; and even GEORGE THE THIRD takes it, unkind of posterity
that his copper pigtail, opposite RANsoM's, is not kept as bright as the
gold in RANsoM’s coffers. Well, my worthy DEAN, it is this spectral
weakness that urges me to put to you this simple question—
“DoctoR MILMAN, Dean of St. Paul's, what do you propose to do
with the money, subscribed some years since, towards the CAxton
Monument?
“I am told that a good round sum was collected. Poets and scholars
spared somewhat from their light pockets, whilst enthusiastic printers,
#. MEssRs. CLowes—proud of their CAxton—threw down their
hundred pounds!
“Now, DocTo º any bashfulness that may, even in my
present condition, linger about me, -I must ask of you, do you propose
to re-open the matter? Is WILLIAM CAxton to have a monument, or
are the sums subscribed to be returned—a very tedious and difficult
operation, by the way—to the donors f -
“I am told, when the monumental question was first opened, that
you, with poetic mind, suggested the adoption of a light and a fountain
to the memory of CAxton, as significant of the benefits of CAxton's
art to darkened and †† man. Permit me to offer another plan in
memory of my individual self. -
“You are now Dean of the City Cathedral; and though, as a late
parishioner of Westminster, my monument ought to stand somewhere
near that ‘side chapel of the Abbey' where my press creaked, never-
theless, I will not, reject the hospitality, of St. Paul's. Have you
money ºf: in hand to buy me a good, stout, working-day statue
in stone * If not, let me have a vera effigies in wax. MADAME Tussaud
tells me that such an article may be turned out of hand on the most
moderate terms; and a wax-work statue of WILLIAM CAxTON would,
no doubt, add to the wonders of your Cathedral, and make the show a
still better twopenny-worth than is at present afforded by your
exhibition.
“Any way, a monument of some sort, I will have—a monument of
marble, wax, or ginger-bread, or—depend upon it, MR. DEAN–you shall
again and again hear from
“THE GHOST OF CAxTON.
“P. S. I have this moment heard that the St. Paul's twopence is
abolished; and that Mr. Punch—for his prowess in the twopenny
warfare—is to be invited to a solemn festival given by the repentant
Dean and Chapter. Is this true?”
An Eligible Opening.
WE have seen an advertisement in the papers headed with the
striking words, “Close of THE ARCTIC REGIONs. We trust that be-
fore the Arctic Regions really do close, we shall have some further
particulars, as the whole world is interested in keeping open this im-
portant No-thoroughfare.

THE OFFICIAL YEAR.
It seems that the 7th of April is the first day of the official year, and
may be looked upon, therefore, as a sort of New Year's Day at
Downing Street. We do not understand why the 7th of April should
be selected, and, indeed, it seems to us that the lst would be quite as
. Why cannot official people commence their year when
other people do, instead of beginning more than ninety days after the
fair, when the rest of the world has entered . tits second quarter?
We suppose that one of the reasons why nothing is done during the
two first months of the assembling of Parliament is, that the official
#. has not commenced, and that the time has therefore not arrived
or business.
We beg to suggest the publication of an official almanack to enlighten
us as to the progress of time; for, perhaps, when we are lamenting that
we are half through the year—without anything having been accom-
plished—we are, officially speaking, only just commencing the twelve-
month. , We are afraid, however, that though the official year is
extremely slow to begin, it is quite as rapid as the ordinary time in its
flight, and that the year is consequently very soon over.
A new time-table should be immediately constructed for the use of
the uninitiated, among whom we must acknowledge ourselves to be
numbered, though, if we may venture on a guess, we think the table to
calculate official time would be something after the following fashion:
Two Minutes make One Official Hour.
Two Hours One Official Day.
Two Days One Official Week.
Two Weeks One Official Month.
Two Months One Official Quarter.
Two Quarters . One Official Year.
In addition to the time-table proposed above, we would recommend a
sort of official calendar, marking down all the moveable feasts, including
the Ministerial White bait Dinner, and other great solemnities of an
official character.
THAT “POOR CREATURE, THE POPE.”
FATHER NEWMAN has been glorifying, at Leeds, the celestial powers
of the Pope, in commemoration of certain converts made there. The
FATHER, with the meekness and truthfulness of his order, said:
“Why, they (the Protestants) had seen the holy father, the Pope, driven from Rome,
and obliged to take refuge elsewhere; they had seen him persecuted by his own
people, and had said, “Here is a poor creature—he can do nothing!' They (the Roman
Catholics) took them at their word. It was true the Pope was not strong in this world;
but if he was not strong in this world, and yet was strong, he suspected his strength
must come, not from this, but from some other world.”
How beautifully true is this! The Pope was taken from Gaeta to
Naples, and thence to Rome, by a sublime army, armed with celestial
weapons. The bayonets that . hoisted him into the chair of St.
Peter's (here LADY MORGAN shakes her head) were forged of divine
temper—the bullets were manna, doing the duty of lead—the swords,
converted sunbeams, fighting the fight of IMPIUs THE NINTH.
There can be no doubt of the celestial nature of the weapons; but—
we confess to the perplexity—we are much puzzled to learn how French
soldiers, in their gross mortality, managed to get hold of them. What
Archangel was Minister of Holy War on the blessed occasion?
MARKET REMOVALS.
SMITHFIELD Market is to be removed, we know not where. But had
FERRAND been returned for Aylesbury, there is no doubt that Billings-
gate would have gone to Westminster.

RARE NEWS FROM AMERICA.
Now that we have got a Crystal Palace, or
enormous glass-house, all the world, seems
determined to throw stones, or, at all events,
to have a shy at us. The last packet) from
America contains the exclusive and confiden-
tial intelligence, that the leading men of
Liverpool are about to declare Liverpool,
Lancashire, and Wales a republic; a pretty
mess or puddle for the Liverpuddlians to get
their feet into. We dare say, the next packet
from America will bring the news that Ken-
sington is a commonwealth; that PUMMELL
the headle, has been declared dictator: that all
the inhabitants have sworn fealty to him in
BATTY's new Hippodrome, and that the
Frºnor of Cm sº has been proclaimed
Lieutenant-General of Hyde Park in the Chi-
nese Exhibition at Knightsbridge. As to Ken-
ington, we shall probably hear—from America
column of the newspaper. An evil day was
it #: . when the *: pullets º: to
with sickening eye u ir morning ey, refusing partake
thereof. The Swans, º: of the Merchant Tailors, have given
augury of the saddest future to the City of London, or at least to that
powerful and compact body, the Tailors, that make the proudest portion |D
of London's Corporation. . . -
Possibly it may yet dwell in the mind of the newspaper reader that
the week before last, LoRD STANLEY was invited to take his seat at
the board—though not cross- —of the Merchant Tailors. It was
expected that his Lordship would there and then produce something
that should—like the owl of MINERVA—reveal itself as the acknow.
ledged type of sublimest wisdom...And up to the hour of his Lordship's
appearance at the board, all the sitting Swans of the Merchant Tailors
were doing as well as could be expected. LoRD STANLEY made his
speech; he moreover complimented MR. DISRAELI on his “wit and
ability”—(when you want to say the least you can of a man, always
speak of his “wit,”)—and the next morning every swan's egg of the
ailors was found to be addled; with one monstrous exception—an
egg, to all ſappearance, a full-sized, true swan's º produced the
smallest of goslings that, should it consent to be reared upon free trade
oats, may, arrived at its full growth, challenge the wonder of the world
as the smallest of geese! -
At the hour we go to press, a fierce discussion rages in the Hall of
the Merchant Tailors; namely—“Whether the speech, as an omen,
caused the goose, or the goose the speech?”
Serious Music.
EveRYBody has heard of the celebrated melody to which Tradition
imputes the death of a certain ancient cow. There is,however, aspecies
of music whose deadly influence is not confined to the vaccine consti-
tution. The enormous organs that are dragged along the streets,
howling and snorting, not only make noise enough to drive all the dogs
in the town mad, but also to frighten the horses, insomuch that several
fatal accidents have already occurred from the bolting of the terrified
animals: sº that these truly dangerous instruments are actually allowed
to go about, playing tunes that HER MAJESTY's subjects die of.
t NATHAN has become a discontented
Baron, and is walking about with a new
Magna Charta, to which he is soliciting signatures among those who
take tickets for his annual benefit.
We shall probably be informed also—from America—that the Isle of
ogs has gone to its proper destination; that CARDINAL WISEMAN has
been proclaimed Pope in the middle of the garden of Golden Square;
that GUs O'Connor has been sent for to form a ministry, and that
the Parliament is, henceforth, to assemble at Snig's End, which is to
be bought and paid for out of the public treasury. We shall not be
surprised, either, to hear—from America—that Leicester Square is in
the hands of the French; that a Provisional Government is sittin
daily at BERTOLINT's; that London is to be henceforth a j
rovince, and that LEDRU RoLLIN is appointed President of France,
eaving Caussion ag-who abandons the trade in boot-tops, for which
he has been travelling on commission—here as his deputy.
This is the sort of stuff we expect to hear from America, but, as we
are not very likely to hear it from any other source, it does not much
signify.
Mr. Ferrand, at Aylesbury.
MR. FERRAND, from his inn at Aylesbury-Aylesbury the spotless—
proudly appeals to the pure spirit of patriotism that dwells in the hearts
and sometimes jingles in the pockets of the model Bucks' constituents.
MR. FERRAND says, “he has no need of the ‘Man in the Moon.’” We
will endeavour to believe MR. FERRAND; the meekness of his utterance
ought always to dispose us to believe. He talks honey, and his political
speeches flow with the milk of human kindness. MR. FERRAND may
have no need of the Man that—according to hoary tradition-dwells in
the luminary; but of the Moon herself there can be little doubt of her
influence upon the brain of the fervid Protectionist, as shown in most of
his orations made “at the full.”

But—(pausing
THE KOH-I-NOOR A REAL “MOUNTAIN OF LIGHT! ”
A FATALITY has hitherto attended the possession of the Koh-i-Noor diamond; on
which account, now that it has fallen into HER MAJESTY's hands, superstition might
counsel the QUEEN to get rid of it as soon as possible. A considerably better reason,
however, why our Sover EIGN. might be recommended to dispose of this piece of crys-
tallised carbon, is, that by selling it for what it would fetch, she might be enabled to
i. a much more splendid jewel in that crown, which may she wear long before
c
anging it for a better!. The Koh-i-Noor would fetch a sum which might be invested
in a munificent Royal foundation for educational purposes. This proposal is more
especially seasonable just now, that we are all—that is, all rational and honest men-
considering how best to counteract papal machinations. We cannot oppose the Pope
and his servile emissaries, more effectually than by disseminating knowledge. Igno-
rance is said to be the Mother of Devotion; which is quite true—though only true as
º that devotion that venerates mail-parings, images, anatomical preparations, and
other things of a similar nature to the objects worshipped by aboriginal negroes.,.
But how is it, then, that so many “ . men,” as FATHER NEwMAN and his con-
federates boast, have gone over to Rome? In consequence of their stupidity, and not
of their cleverness. Most of those who have turned papists have been persons whose
acquirements are confined to the ancient languages, and whose philosophy extends no
further than the wordy speculations of the praters of old. A considerable number of
these erudite converts may be very well informed on the subject of Greek or Hebrew
roots, but it is questionable if many of them know the stamens from the pistils of a
buttercup. No FARApays, no BRANDEs, no WHEwells, no SEpgwicks, have pros-
trated themselves at the feet of the Pope and DR. Wise MAN. An acquaintance with
the sublime, laws, and the masterly handiwork which govern, and characterise the
Universe, will prevent any one who has the least idea of style, from mistaking for
other than human the imbecile ordinances and clumsy fabrications of priestcraft,
Oxford, learned only in the learning of pedagogues; asinine in regard to natural
science; has been the chief nursery i. Rome. The “clever men” who have joined
the Church of the Inquisition, have only done, late in
the day, what the slightest logical perception would,
with their principles, have made them do years ago.
The Royal Commission, it is to be hoped, will correct
the monkery of Oxford, by forcing the study of Crea-
tion's realities on that great grammar-school. Still
there is a large proportion of the working classes,
and a vast mass of pauperism, almost, if not quite, as
ignorant as Oxford of those truths, the knowledge of
which is the surest safeguard of the understanding
against the delusions of Roman or any other impos-
ture or insanity. Could the Koh-i-Noor be con-
verted into the means of dispelling this darkness, it
would be indeed what its name implies—a true
“Mountain of Light.”
A REGULAR BAR MESS.
THERE is a superstition annong the public which
renders it necessary for the Railway Directors to put on
a special train during circuit time, for the accommoda:
tion of the lawyers. This superstition—a very, absurd
one, no doubt—was nearly being justified one day last
week by the catching fire of a carriage full of barristers.
The attention of the guard was happily called to a
fearful odour of burning horse-hair, caused by the
frizzling of some of the wigs of the learned occupants.
We are happy to be able to add that the casualty can be
accounted for without reference to any mysterious
agency. We should be º to see the old suggestion
of SYDNEY SMITH as to the necessity for “burning
a bishop,” converted into a proposition for “burning
a barrister,” as a preventive against accidents to the
public in general; but we think a more wholesome plan
would be—until regular signals are provided—that the
breaking of a window j'be recognised as a sign to
be repeated º the passengers in each carriage, until the
attention of the guard has been obtained. Such a signal
as this would, in time, arouse the attention, not only of
the servants, but the Directors of the Company.
The Best Possible Proof of Civilisation.
MR. Hawes said of our. Cape colonists, “that they
were giving the best possible proºf of civilisation, for
they paid their tares very well.” If taxation and civi-
lisation run together, we are sure that England has
every reason to boast of being one of the most civilised
countries in the world. In fact, many a poor English-
man might complain that the country was much too
civilised “for his money.”
The New Foot Regiment.
SoME individuals, with a rather large development of
the bump of “cautiousness,” anticipate disturbances in
consequence of the expected influx of socialist foreigners,
Not much danger is to be apprehended from that
quarter; but, nevertheless, it is ſº certain that some
others of our foreign friends. will be ready for a brush,
which has been wisely provided for by the formation of
the Shoe-black Brigade.
MoRE MONSTERs!
We are threatened with the exhibition of a female
child, “15 inches in height, and weighing 5lb.” An
ingenious contemporary says of the human doll—“it
may be put in a pocket.” The very destination, we
presume, proposed for it by its exhibitors.

ful shoe-blacks, whom hopeful
benevolence has sent out of the
Ragged Schools, equipped to try
theirchance in a new game of Rouge
et Noir, or scarlet and blacking.
Mr. Punch, in his vocation of
mounting all sorts of coats, and
mixing with all manner of men, at
once took the hint—ordered a
red frock on his own account,
invested in
brushes and
blacking-bot-
tles, and is

It is an interesting occupation, though many may considerit a humble
one, Mr. Punch, while busy with the boots and shoes of his customers-
high and low, and high-low, alike—gets very curious glimpses into their
heads and hearts. The ancients had a proverb, that you might estimate
the statue of a Hercules from his foot, and it is still found that
fº the length of a man's foot is a very good way of finding out the
size of his mind, no less than that of his body.
In his new situation as one of the rank and file of the Shoe-blacks'
brigade—and very curious files some of them are—Mr. Punch takes
care to get the length of every man's foot, whose boots come through
his hands, and he proposes to communicate to his dear Readers, from
time to time, the results of the unconscious self-measurement which
his customers are every day innocently applying to themselves. Mr.
Punch believes he may thus be the channel of some not unimportant
truths. He prays John BULL, with his visitors, not to imitate the
cat who used to figure at the head of MR. WARREN's Advertisements,
setting his back up, and swelling his tail, in indignation at the image of
himself reflected in the boot which derived its polished surface from
“30, the Strand.”
And first of my new...friends, the red-coated little shoe-blacks.

follow it., They are themselves the moral off-scourings of those very

and going, lowering and lifting, hoisting and heaving, pushing and
poising—and the noise of hammers began to pall on my ear, and
j to feel an interest in the painters and glaziers that crawled like
flies on the roof–and still no customer came. It was a dry day,
unluckily for us, and mud was an abominably scarce article.
I had begun to think of packing up my brushes, when a hale and
hearty Briton, ruddy of the country, iii. of May-buds, and cows, and
fresh air (who had by some miracle contrived to find a puddle, and to
step into it), put one of his top-boots into my hand, and told me to black
away.
“Driving a tidy trade, lad—eh?” was his first question, as I got a

I commenced work yesterday in the neighbourhood of the Crystal
Palace. There it stretched, in its lightsome length, a glass hive for
the human bees of the nineteenth century. . I prayed, as I looked
it, waiting for a customer, that no one would ever attempt to take the
honey by the aid of sulphur; and that the bee-keepers of the world would
at last discover a betterway of “swarming” their bees than by the noise
of a brass band. Society, hitherto, has been more afraid of the stings of
its bees, than anxious to cultivate and aid their power of honey-making.
But now that the glass hive has been introduced into the bee-keeping;
practice, with the human as well as the insect worker, I could not but
hope that with the former, as the latter, we may henceforth see the
honey taken for use, while the bees, instead, of being smothered or
starved in the process, are left to thrive and multiply, and fill their
cells, year after year.
And, full of this thought," as PRINCE ALBERT passed me to inspect
the ordering of the world's contributions, I could scarcely resist a

And I blush to say, that such was the influence of my costume and
companions, that I indulged in a “sight” at my worthy instructor in
Political Economy, as he continued his walk, brandishing, his stick in
the direction of the Crystal Palace, as though he wished that it was all

my stool for a fresh customer.
REMOVAL OF THE BRIBERY MARKET.
BSERVING that Bills are
now before Parliament
for the Improvement and
Removal of Markets, we
hope some notice will
be taken of the Bribery
Market. This Market
has long been a nuisance
in all political boroughs.
Men |. been led by
the nose, and whipped
and goaded inlargeherds,
and publicly sold, in open
| daylight, like so many
cattle. The acts of inhu-
manity that have been
ractised in the Bribery
Market almost surpass
those of Smithfield. The
number of persons that
have been crushed, be-
cause they would not
quietly allow themselves
to be driven and sold to
the highest bidder, would
scarcely be believed, un-
less they were too truth-
fully recorded in the
Parliamentary annals of
corruption." The many instances of oppression that have resulted from
the public sales in the Bribery Market are so glaring, that it is difficult to
imagine how any one can advocate the continuance of such a cruel, such
a degrading system. Yet the Bribery Market has its sturdy advocates,
who maintain that the Constitution would be in danger if the Market
were attempted to be done away with. They cry out for “vested
rights,” and loudly demand compensation if these privileges are in the
least infringed
Another plea for the continuance of the nuisance is, that the persons
who are bribed rather like it, and if they choose to be bribed, no one
has a right to prevent it. They declare that the system agrees with
them |. well, and that, therefore, it must be a very healthy one.
They have resorted to it all their lives, and as long as they live they
will never buy or sell in any other market. As for the corruption, they
only wish the Market was held much oftener than it is—twice a week, in
fact, like most markets—in order that they might fatten and grow rich
upon it ! . Like venison, the higher the corruption the better they say
they like it !
There are others, also, largely interested in the maintenance of the
Market, who insist that the large sums of money turned every election
in the Bribery Market, should be a strong reason why it should never
be abolished. A solicitor, who has for years been a most extensive
salesman in the Bribery Markets all over the Kingdom, states, that
no less a sum than £3,000,000 must have changed hands at the last
general election—in close boroughs only. Why, the sum that was ex-
pended at St. Alban's alone exceeded, he thinks, £50,000. Then there
were Ipswich, and Woodstock, and Poole, Yarmouth, Portsmouth, and
Sandwich, to say nothing of several Írish towns, each of which held
snug little markets of their kind, in which business was done to the
extent of several thousands; and if this business was done away with,
by the abolition of all bribery markets, it would be so much money
taken out of the pockets of the inhabitants of those towns, and it would
be inflicting a very serious injury upon a very numerous class of HER
MAJESTY's loyal subjects. - - -
We think we have heard somewhat similar arguments used with
regard to a somewhat similar nuisance. If we recollect right, the
nuisance in question was Smithfield Market.
the Bribery Market will quickly go after it, and the St. Alban's
Market, we think, should be the first to show the example.
OUR COLONEL'S CORNER.
THE hearing in the new House of Commons is, as every one knows
who wishes to make a fine speech, extremely indistinct. SIBTHoRP
being asked what was the loudest tone generally heard in it, replied on
the spot, “A Barry-tone.”
A E. who was reading in the streets, ran violently against him.
The Colonel took hold of him and held him by the button-hole, till he
delivered himself of the following jeu d'esprit:-"Sir, it is perfectly
true that ‘ those who run may read;' but that is no reason why those
who read should run;” having said which, he good-naturedly released
him, with a poke in ribs.
It is needless to state that the Colonel is strongly imbued with all the
John BULL prejudices of the fine “Old gº; of which he has
always been one of the ormaments. He was asked what he
would do in ease the Crystal Palace were attacked by these French
Socialists. “Do, Sir!” he answered quite angrily, “why, Sir, I would
simply call into operation the Cold Water Cure. I would have a
small fire-engine stationed in the Exhibition; and if they attempted
any of their foreigneering tricks here, I would begin playing upon
them, like a house on fire. Depend upon it, Sir, they would all begin
running, to a man; for if there is one thing a Frenchman has a greater
horror of than another, it is Cold Water. I never met with a foreigner
yet who could face it.”
He was asked what was his opinion about Communism. He was
very angry at first, and wouldn't answer. At last his brow gradually
relaxed, and he said, in the calmest manner, “Communism, my dear
Sir, is the equal division of goods. That is to say, if I have a dickey
and you have no shirt, I must share my dickey with you. Now I should
like to know how we should all look with only half a dickey a piece?”
He has taken very little interest in the Papal-Puseyite question.
Once º was he heard to offer an opinion. The conversation an upon
the candles of St. Barnabas' Church:-"It seems to me,” he said,
“ that that religion must be rather a dark one that requires the aid of
candles to throw a light upon it. The only ends of Puseyism that I
can see seem to be candle-ends. You may call such things “Religion,” if
you like; but I call them ‘Stuff!—Stuff!” In fact, considering the
quantity of tallow used, I may say, Kitchen-stuff.” And nothing
would induce him to say another word.
He was taken, to see the Model of the Earth in Leicester Square.
His enthusiasm knew, no bounds; and he went about saying to every
one, “This is the wildest turn the Earth has had yet. We have often
That nuisance has been
ordered, by Act of Parliament, to be removed. It is to be hoped that
heard of the Earth being turned inside out; but this is the first time, I
believe, that it has ever been turned outside in.”
It is a mistake to suppose, however, that our Colon EL is always good-
natured. He can be severe, as well as playful; can kick as well as
romp. Many sessions ago, Chisholm ANSTEY ſailed to laugh at one of
his best repartees. The Colonel husbanded his wrath for three years.
At last, nearly,300 members were rushing out of the House at once.—
... Please, Sir” inquired an anxious stranger, “is the House up?”
“No, Sir,” shouted SIBTHQRP; “but Chisholm ANSTEY is 1* The
joke flew like wild-fire; and, the next morning, CHIsholm ANSTEY sent
a friend to the Colonel to ask him to make it up.
During Passion Week, he went to see one of the Orreries. He was
very uneasy for a long time; but, at last he could bear it no longer.
Crimson with rage, he rose from his seat, and exclaimed—“Why, this
is precisely the same as was exhibited last year!” And he left the
Theatre, warning all the check-takers, that “he certainly should write
to the Times about it.”
“Up with the Lark.”
“What makes you up so late, Sir?” said a father to his son, who
made his appearance at the breakfast-table about ten o'clock. “Late!
Why, Father, I was up with the lark.” “Well, then, Sir, for the future
. º up so long with the lark, but come down a little earlier to
reakfast.”

THE PEERAGE OF NATURE.
WE frequently hear of “nature's noble-
men,” but really they seem to be in such a
miscellaneous state, that we think the pub-
lication of a “Nature's Peerage” would be
very advisable. The only member of nature's
nobility that we are acquainted withis BARon
NATHAN, whose peerage is decidedly not
conferred upon him by patent, and we may,
therefore, presume that he claims his aristo-
cracy from nature direct. His efforts have
certainly been given to the improvement of
nature by the aid of art, and nature may, out
of gratitude, have conferred upon NATHAN
his barony. It is not hereditary, because no
one can expect to tread in NATHAN's shoes,
or dance in his pumps, at least with the
grace which he alone can impart to them.
Cruel Oppression.
“Much had been said” (so spoke MR.
Hawes about the Caffre war) “of the oppres-
sion of the Boers by the Colonial Office.” It is
our opinion, however, that a great deal more
might be said of the oppression of the Bores
of the Colonial Office, of the oppression of
the Bores in Parliament, and of every other
class of Bores whose pleasure it is to speak,
and yet say nothing. We wish some one
would head an expedition for the entire sup-
pression of all such Bores, more especially
in the House of Commons.

Conversions to Rome.
RECENT examples have led us to believe, that, in the conversion of
young ladies, it is not the conversion of their souls which is so much
desired º the Romish priests, as the conversion of their money, which
may be lodged in the 33 per Cents, or any of the public funds.
The interest of the Romish Church too frequently means the interest
of Government Stock–interest which, in many instances, is only gained
at the sacrifice of every principle. We are most happy to be able to
record the following
“FaustRATED ATTEMPT of CoNVERsion to Row E.-DR. HENDREN (soi-disant Bishop
of Clifton) has signally failed in attempting to convert the sum of £80,000, Public
Securities, into ready money, for the purpose of endowing a Nunnery at Taunton.”

surdities, it is recommended that on the principal statues erected
about the Metropolis in honour of distinguished personages, should be
inscribed conspicuously, in various languages, the words “Don’t
LAUGH!”
The Misfortune of Eminence.
As a personage enjoying, himself, some degree of celebrity, Punch can
sº with a distinguished ecclesiastic, with whom, lº and
doctrinally, he is at issue. Mr. Punch would not like to put in the
osition in which that eminent individual has been placed. . “His
ºminence CARDINAL WISEMAN, in Full Costume,” now occupies the
lace at the head of the wax-work advertisement that was lately filled
i. “Rush, taken from Life, at Norwich.” Before Rush, the benevolent

there is reason to believe that a contest of politeness will be occasioned
by the advent of our foreign guests, which will amount to a civil war.
QUACKERY.—The love of quackery by the British Government is
strongly proved by the fact, that a box of Life Pills has to pay less duty
than the maid-of-all-work's advertisement for a place.

And hange with black the hye Guildhalle,
Alack for rewth and woe!
Good old Smythfelde eftsoon must fall,
The markett ytt must go!
'Twas merry, on a Monday morn,
To see the ring-droves made,
Whilst goodly tunes on ox hys horne
The stout oak cudgel played,
And many a good round othe was sworn,
And the shepe-dogs bark’d and bayed.
That musicke we shall heer no more,'
For Smythfeeld must away,
Sith bulles sometimes old wives do gore,
As thro’ the stretes they stray,
And folk think anye dirt a boare,
So squeamish now-a-day !
Our lytle kiddes, as blythe as grigges,
Allynn their nursemayd's care, .
With hoopes and balles and whirligiggs,

To play among the shepe and piggs,
And take the mornyng ayre.

THE CALIFoRNIAN Goose.—The Eraminer states, that a mountain

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A (TOO) LATE
BARRISTER.
HERE was I? ...Alas! I am ** at blind
man's buff with my feelings. I lose myself
every now and then, until stern reality tears
the bandage from my heated forehead; and
I collect myself, or rather re-collect myself,
Once again.
I spoke of a consultation. It was not
quite the first, though it was nearly the last
in which I ever was engaged. But of this
anon' Resigning myself into the hands of
Fancy, I follow her into the Temple. I walk
up several flights—not of fancy, but of stairs
—and find myself at the door of those old
chambers, where, as one of the million waiters
whom, Fortune always keeps in attendance
upon her, I used to while away, the hours
in anticipation of the coming man, (the client),
who never came.
Disgusted with the world—as he well might be—my learned prede-
cessor in my attic chambers became more sombre, but no less philan-
thropic than heretofore; and, while thinking of burying all animosity,
it occurred to him that a Benevolent Burial Association, in which the
members were mutually to bury each other, º open up some new
ground to him. Another Prospectus came forth, headed “Funerals for
the Million;” and announcing the joyful intelligence, that everybody
who, paid, a shilling would be at once entitled to a grave. As the
“million” did not seem disposed to rush into the earth with the vigour
that might have been tºº. in fact, they would no more come
to be buried than “dilly dilly” would go" to be killed.” the grand idea
occurred of allowing a guinea to all those who were desirous of post-
poning their own funerals to some “onward occasion.” Notwithstand-
ing the outcry against expensive funerals, nobody seemed inclined to
meet half-way this wholesale undertaking of my predecessor;
who, still undaunted, tried to get up an Equitable Insurance office, in
which º was to receive the amount of º: down, instead
of at his death, and was to pay, one premium only, as a preliminary,
which was to entitle him to the whole sum at once for which he was
insured—out of the first profits of the concern.
I intended to pull a leaf out of my own diary, but I have plucked a
page from the reminiscences of my learned predecessor in my chambers. ||
Alas! he is no more. His demise formed the substance of a newspaper
The last occupant of my chambers had been
a hoary junior, who had sat for years waiting
for the turn of the cards, as if he had been
playing a game at Patience on the Monument
smiling at-the absence of brief. He had
at last turned his attention to the good of
the public, in utter hopelessness of doing
anythin for the good of himself. Unlike
many who are ill-used—or rather, not used at
all—by the world, instead of revenging him-
self on society by mockery and malediction,
he burst forth into a fit of benevolence so
universal in its objects, that it, really knew
no bounds. He had become the friend of
everybody, though nobody had been a friend to him. He started, or
rather he printed the Prospectus of a Philanthropic Pension Society
every member of which was to have a pension, or rather to be entitle
to one, on payment of a shilling deposit. *
The advantages were to be mutual. Everybody was to be equally
entitled to a pension, and the privilege of life-membership was to be
had for half-a-crown. Any philanthropist, who did not anticipate a
necessity for a pension, might purchase the luxury of being a “governor”
for a shilling, and a life-governor's qualification was to be had for
another sixpence, “to meet,” as the prospectus prettily expressed it,
“the wishes of all classes of philanthropists.” So busy was the brain
of my learned predecessor in plans of benevolence, that he was prepared
not only to pension off the world in general upon itself at a nominal
cost, but he was anxious to offer accommodation to the struggling, and
he projected a Benevolent Discount and, Friendly Promissory. Note
Association, the members of which were all to cash each others’ bills.
Admission to the vast benefits of this truly bosom stirring scheme
for giving everybody pecuniary assistancº, was fixed at the lowest
possible figure; and “a shilling deposit” entitled the depositor to
priority in the discount of all or any of his paper. The CHANGELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER, on hearing of the proposal, might reasonably have
altered his estimate of the next year's income, which must have shown
an enormous increase in stamps; for it might have been anticipated,
that, when a Benevolent Discount Company thus threw down, the
gauntlet, every one would be ready to draw. Unhappily the excellent
scheme of my learned predecessor—whose bosom was a perfect dairy
of the “sky-blue” of H. kindness—never came to pass. The
President ãº a bill upon the Vice, and endorsed it over to
the Chairman; the Committee drew bills upon each other, to which
the members, in a spirit of brotherly confidence, gave, the aid of
their names;, the Actuary drew upon the Secretary, the Solicitor
drew upon the Standing Counsel; and, in fact, there never was
tº: He was trying to set, on foot a Benevolent Society of
nited Cabmen; and, forgetting his own in society, he was
arguing on the rank in Piccadilly, when a Hansom gave him an ugly
blow with one of its shafts, and saved him from the shafts of envy or
misfortune, as far as the future is concerned. My tears flow, so fast at
the recollection, that my inkstand brims over with the pious brine, and
I must send for another hap’orth, which I cannot afford to do until
|next week—before I pr
PLAYERS FROM THE FRENCH.
R. MITCHELL is at his old
tricks again. The St. James's
Theatre is again to be pos-
sessed by a French troupe, to
the disadvantage and con-
tempt of our own manufac-
ture, the sterling British
actor; for there can be no
doubt that to the successful
issue of MR. MITCHELL's
campaign, as carried out by
French troops, we may as-
cribemuch of theindifference
which is the insult conveyed
by a heartless public to the
thorough-going Englishactor.
Who, for instance, that
witnesses the ease—the con-
summate polish—of a French
LAFONT, can be content with
the robust blundering—the
fine home-born vulgarity—of
a British BRowNP
Who, fascinated by the per-
fectart of a Boufff, can heed
—as he ought to heed—the
& slap-dash, go-a-head style of
- GRILEs P
Who, delighted by the airy DEJAZET, can admire—as he should—the
fine, crusted, maternal comedy, of a FitzJohns? -
Therefore, if our English actors are to be at all encouraged, let not
the English public be i. to behold a superior manufacture. The
French actor is an artist: the English actor—with rare exceptions—a

such an amount of splendid “machinery’ to set a society going; but
somehow or other, perhaps for want of something to grease the wheels,
the machinery would not act... My friend had himself undertaken the
arduous and responsible position of Standing Counsel, in which he had
no other interest than a fee of a shilling for “drawing bill,” with sixpence
extra for “signing draft; ” and at these º philanthropic prices he
was ready to draw bills in any quantity, or put his name to as many drafts
as were offered to his acceptance. Fate and the money-market nipped
this scheme in the bud, or more properly s g, it no sooner got
into the bud than it got an unexpected blow. A heartless banking com-
pany refused to negotiate the paper of the Beneyolent Discount Com;
pany, and that upas tree to all kindly sentiment, “the market,” laughed
its “orders,” and, “promises” equally to scorn. While money was a

handicraftsman. We only perceive one mode by which the French
players may be made to assist the English stage; namely, by inoculating
the English actor with some enthusiasm for his art. And whereas we
now commonly read that “MR. MANAGER CRUMMLEs has gone to Paris
for novelty,” let us be told that “MR. CRUMMLEs has taken his whole
company, by divisions, to study at the French theatre.”... We take
pieces from the French: when shall we take—or imitate—the earnest
ability that evokes their excellence?
Rivals to the Great Exhibition.
THERE is every hope that the crowd will be divided on the 1st of
May; for the Protectionists mean to create some diversion—entirely at
their own expense too—by making a separate exhibition of themselves
at Drury Lane Theatre.

“THOSE who LIVE IN GLASS-HOUSES SHOULDN'T

THE Executive Council, of the Great Exhibition have just done a
very snobbish thing, and they had better undo it as fast as possible.
They have also been guilty of a little bit of downright dishonesty. We
must and will call things by their right names—in selling their Season
Tickets on the condition that the holders should be admitted on the
lst of May, and now, at the eleventh hour, advertising that the tickets,
paid for on that understanding, are not to be admitted until the best
part of the 1st of May, is over. The cause of this arrangement is a
clumsy piece of fencing, intended to please the QUEEN; but calculated,
we should think, to disgust HER MAJESTY most exceedingly. We
will be bound that, no small portion of the royal pleasure, in opening
the Exhibition, would consist of the opportunity it would afford her of
sharing her enjoyment with a large number of her subjects; but the
idea of leaving her to ramble about the vast building in gloomy state,
with a few #. functionaries at her heels, is worthy the
imagination of the most º: of snobs.
e protest, on behalf of HER MAJESTY, against her being placed in
the very invidious position into which the Executive Committee would
thrust her. Only fancy an impatient crowd being º for hours, a
practical lesson of stupid. unmeaning exclusiveness, by being compelled
to kick their own and tread on their neighbours' heels all the morning
outside the doors, while the QUEEN, with a set of gold and other sticks,
may be taking a dismal tour over the unpeopled avenues of the Crystal
Palace. Those flunkies of the Executive Committee have no right to
ive a false and unfavourable inpression of the feelings of their Royal
istress, by making it appear that it is her wish, to have the vast
building | to herself during the best portion of the first day of the
Exhibition. In fact, the proceeding is a direct robbery of one half of
the only special privilege which the season-ticket holders pay for—
namely, the right of admission on the day of opening. It is dis-
respectful towards the QUEEN to arrange matters so that the visitors
to the Exhibition, instead of being glad to see her come, will be eagerly
impatient for her to go away, as the impediment placed between them-
selves and the enjoyment they have bargained for.
We can undertake to say, that if HER MAJESTY's personal wishes
were to be consulted, she would at once express, her wish not to dis:
appoint the public; and while every one would cheerfully submit to all
the arrangements necessary for the perfect comfort and convenience
of the Sovereign, scarcely any will believe that such arrangements are
incompatible with the presence of a few thousands of well-behaved
º: and gentlemen simultaneously with HER MAJESTY in the Crystal
ace. - -
Pedestrianism in Park Lane.
“ExPERIENCE,” in a letter to the Times, complains, “that there is
a leading thoroughfare, in the very heart of the West End, within a
stone's throw of the Crystal Palace, which is not paved on either side
of the way, the footway of which is so neglected as to be a perfect
disgrace to the parish.” The thoroughfare alluded to is Park Lane,
“OBSERVATION” presents his compliments to “ExPERIENCE,” and
begs to suggest to him that the inhabitants of Park, Lane do not
belong to, the walking, classes; hence, perhaps, the disregard exhi-
bited in the state of that thoroughfare for the convenience of the
pedestrian public.
Sir Harry Smith's “Brass Nob.”
THE Cape of Good Hope—or rather Forlorn Hope—with such a
governor as SIR HARRY SMITH, is not yet ruled by the Kaffirs; though
what may happen, who shall say, with a governor who, to awe the
savages, “carries in his hand a magic wand, surmounted with a brass
nob?” This brass mob has special sorcery in it. And armed with it,
SIR HARRY desires the Kaffirs “not to believe in witchcraft.” When
we consider the behest in association with the charmed weapon, SIR
HARRY must surely possess more than one “brass mob” so to ap
even to Kaffirs. -

THE LANGUAGE OF MUSIC.
VERY one has heard of the language
of flowers, in which lack-a-daisiacal
young ladies might talk sweet
stuff É, the flowerpot-full for hours
together; but a more dangerous
nuisance has lately, sprung up in
the facilities given by the titles of
songs for flirtations between the
young men in music-shops and
their fair purchasers.
The following is a specimen, not
only of what might happen, but
what, no doubt, does happen very
frequently in some of our musical
circulating libraries.

for “Happy. Heart,” and then I'll take it. I left it behind me
the last time I was here.

Parcels Delivery?
Young Lady. No; I'll take that and “The Manly Heart” home

THE SALE OF POISON.
We hope, the “Analytical Medical Commission” will, after it has
finished with the fl. London Tradesmen who are making their
rtunes out of adulteration, carry its inquiries into the mysteries of
the Wine Trade. It has now become such a matter of difficulty to º:
a glass of good wine, that we think the poisonous tricks practised by
wine-merchants should be exposed. . We trust the Lance? will not be
deterred from, undertaking this most difficult i. Not only does
health demand it, but conviviality claims it. Nothing is so destructive
of good-feeling as bad wine. It gives one the heart-burn in more
senses than one...The merriest party cannot stand up against a suc-
cession of Cape Sherries and Agricultural Ports. . The cruelty of the
deception is such—for one is made º: under the false pretence
of being made happy—that we would have every wine-merchant, who
was, convicted of selling wine that was everything but wine, punished
in the most terrible manner. We would have him, condemned, for
every bottle of bad wine that was found in his cellar, to drink out of it
not less than two glasses, for the first offence; three, for the second;
and an additional glass for .*. fresh offence; until these poisoners of
the nineteenth century were thoroughly sickened of their fraudulent
practices. - -
If the Lancet will º publish a list of these poisoners—with parti-
culars of their crimes and offences—we may, in time, be rewarded with
the discovery of an honest wine-merchant, who will sell wine free from
all adulteration l

THE LAUGH BEHIND THE SCENES.
THERE is a sound of hollow mirth
Bursts on the unaccustomed ear;
'Tis not the merriment of earth,
Nor laughter born of wine or beer;
'Tis not the cheerfulness of heart
That scarcely knows what sorrow, means.
No, no; ’tis mirth that acts a part;
it is the laugh behind the scenes.
The laughers are not truly *:
Their spirits are not really light;
Their mirth is the result of pay:
They laugh for eighteenpence a-night.
They stand within #. prompter's view,
Those Joneses, Thomsons, BRowns, and GREENs,
Waiting the well-remembered cue
To raise the laugh behind the scenes.
The laughter comes from hollow cheeks,
Whose deep vermilion-coated skin
Conceals, by night, the furrowed streaks
Of sorrow, groaning from within.
Not e'en a passing jest is heard,
To raise the mirth that supervenes;
The solemn prompter gives the word
That starts the laugh behind the scenes.
JoNEs has, perchance, a little bill
He’s fiercely importuned to pay; "
P'rhaps Thomson’s wife at home lies ill;
BRowN’s infant may have died that day.
GREEN, possibly, with aching head,
Against the wing distracted leans.
No matter; they must earn their bread,
And join the laugh behind the scenes.
But all the world’s a stage confest;
And laughter often has its source
In what would prove a sorry jest,
Could we but backwards track its course.
A TRIPLE FROM CULLEN.—We have nothing very rich from Ireland in the Great
Exhibition. Could not DR. CULLEN–with the help of some of the ingenious
gentlemen of Maynooth—have sent an Orrery P
For him the laugh would quickly turn,
Who’d ask too closely what it means;

Or look too far behind the scenes.
WONDERFUL SPEED.
THE Catalogue of the Crystal Palace is rapidly progressing, and will
be ready, not only in one language, but printed in four languages, by
the First of May. This gigantic undertaking, retarded by inaumerable
difficulties, will have been completed, therefore, in less than three
months. It is this memorable instance of speed that makes us propose
that the interminable and, never-to-be-completed-in-our-life-time (as a
German would say) Catalogue of the British Museum be taken out
of the hands of its present sleepy compilers, and confided to the
management of the concoctors of the Exhibition Catalogue. We will
wager they would get it completed, if necessary, before the end of this
ear, and would throw in some five thousand illustrations into the
argain, if they were wanted.
Some alteration is sadly needed—or else, at the rate of speed at which
this snail-like Catalogue is advancing, it will form a formidable rival to
the handering Jew, continually running on, but never coming to an
end. In fact, we can imagine its being used as a land mark in chrono.
logy. Future MACAULAY's will handle it as a very useful yard-measure
In ...ºf off lengths in history. Thus, we fancy the History of
England will henceforth be written in the following style :-
“It was towards the commencement of the letter A. of the Catalogue of the British
Museum (an era never to be forgotten in the annals of civilisation) when WILLIAM
The Fouhth ascended the Throne.”
Or thus:
“The letter B. of the Catalogue of the British Museum was in an advanced state—so
much so, that it required but ten years more, thoroughly to complete it—when, to the
universal joy of the nation, the marriage between PRINCE ALBERT and her beloved
MAJESTY, QUEEN VICToBIA, was celebrated, &c., &c.”
In the meantime the books keep accumulating in hundreds of
thousands every year, so that when the present Catalogue is completed
(if it ever will), another Catalogue will be required for the additional
library, which will have grown out of the long arrears of book-accumu:
lation—and so on perhaps ad infinitum. We prophesy that the sun will
never set on the Catalogue of the British Museum. Like the British
Dominions, there will be no termination to it !
* FOREIGN INWASION OF EXETER ARCADE.
A FRENch horseman was trotted up to Bow Street the other §:
on the charge of having made a desperate charge with his formidable
charger upon the Exeter Arcade. His defence was, that .# overtaken
by a tremendous mitraille of rain, and seeing the place wholly deserted,
he sought shelter within its desolate recesses; and in fact the Arcade was
taken ; storm. The foreign equestrian was very properly fined for his
own or his horse's capers; but we would suggest that to avoid such
rocedings for the future, some signs of habitation should be made mani-
}. within the gloomy vaults of that Arcade, in which, the Beadle, though
“monarch of .# he surveys,” cannot be supposed to be present with all
his staff at both entrances at the same moment.
We recommend the Exeter Arcade to the attention of the Fmigration
Commissioners, and shall be glad to hear, of an omnibus having been
chartered for the purpose of carrying colonists to that unfrequented
nook in the centre of the great human ocean, that rolls past it in every
direction. We can scarcely be surprised at a horse—with all its natural
instinct for the freedom of the desert—having rushed into Exeter
Arcade; which is, we presume, destined to receive the remainder of the
cat-tribe, driven from Leicester Square by the civilised Globe having
been pushed into its limits.
The only thing Free from Adulteration.
We are so frightened with the revelations of the frightful system of
adulteration that is practised apparently amongst all trades, that we
soon shall be afraid to touch, smell, eat, or drink the smallest thing...We
have but one consolation to buoy us up on this heaving sea of misgivings.
There is still one article left us (thank Goodness!) which is perfectly
free from adulteration. It is harmless, always genuine, and, no matter
what quantity, it is taken in, can never do harm, but, on the contrary
is sure to do good. The article we allude to is labelied" Punch,” an
may confidently be recommended as never having contained the smallest
grain of adulteration, in the way of wit, or common sense, or any other
of the healthy ingredients of which it is usually compounded.

THE HAT FOR 1851.
Hatter. “You couldn't Have A MoRE BEcoMing HAT, SIR-AND THEY'LL BE A GREAT DEAL
WoRN AT THE OPENING of THE Exhibition.”
sº
GUTTA PERCHA HATS.
We have seen advertised Gutta Percha
Hats. We should be sorry to wear one of
these hats on a melting hot day, as it might
not be so easy to pull off as on. It is clear
- they would not suit warm-headed gentlemen,
| either: for if the cry of “hats off!” was
suddenly raised, they might experience a great
difficulty in taking their hats off—a difficulty
which might not always admit of a ready
solution. A crowd of hot-headed old gentle-
men, for instance, on one of JULLIEN’s Pro-
memade Nights, would, the moment “God
save the Queen” was struck up, be all knocked
on the head, and turned out summarily, like
so many Red Republicans. We should also
recommend gentlemen who wear wigs to avoid
these Gutta Percha Hats; for supposing the
heat were anything excessive, they might dis-
cover, if they had occasion to salute a lady, that
their peruque went off simultaneously with
the salute. The only persons whom the Gutta
Percha Hats are likely to suit, would be
the Quakers, as they are known to take off
| their hats less than any other people; so
| probably they might take to a hat whose
- greatest recommendation would be never to
ſº I fly off, but to “stick to a person through
thick and thin.”
Rank Deception.
A cAB-DRIVER was brought up a few days
ago for smashing a Brougham. His defence
was a general character for humanity; and
he brought several witnesses to prove that
he could not have smashed a Brougham, for
he never hurt a fly.
SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF AN (EX) UNPROTECTED FEMALE.
THE FRIENDS OF THE (Ex) UNPROTECTED FEMALE FAVOUR HER witH THEIR VIEws of THE GREAT ExHIBITION OF INDUSTRY, AND ITS
CONSEQUENCEs, BY WHICH SHE IS BROUGHT
SCENE.-The Dining-room of MR. SMITHERs (of the firm of SMITHERs,
GUNSTON, AND Co.) after dinner. The Party consists of the Ex-
UNPROTECTED FEMALE (Jon Es being still out of town), MR.
SMITHERs, MRs. SMITHERs, JACK SMITHERs, the two Misses
SMITHERs, the REv. OLINTHUs SMITHERs, the REv. GRIMEs
WAPSHOTT (teho assisted the Rev. OLINTHUs at the ceremony which
transformed MARTHA STRUGGLEs into MARTHA Jon Es), and MRs.
GRIMES WAPshott, GoRHAMBURY GUNSTON, Esq. (the junior
member of the firm), MR. TRUMBULL (the Co.) and LADY, MR.
DoDDLEs (a nervous young man, with an attachment to the mature
Miss SMITHERs), and MR. Joseph JERRAMs (the only one of the
fast friends of JACK SMITHERs whom he is ever allowed to bring to
the family mansion, where he is usually alluded to by the eldest Miss
SMITHERs, as “one of John's low associates.”) The conversation has
of course turned on the Crystal Palace.
Mr. Smithers (who is considered eminently “cautious” in the City). Well,
I don’t know. It’s a wonderful undertaking, no doubt, but dangerous,
I’m afraid—though I don’t know.

is alive to danger, as usual). Eh P Oh, then, #. SMITHERs, you do think
there’s something in the columns and things—
Jack Smithers (who is unfeeling in his jokes). A bag of nails, they say,
and a piece of sacking found plugging one of 'em up.
Miss Smithers (severely). John, how can you? MRs. Jones means
something out of the per endicular papa.
Mr. Smithers (oracularly). Well, Ídon't know—there may be, though
PAxton is a very clever man, no doubt—but they say there ought
to have been more concrete under the pillars—however, I dare say
CUBITT would see to that. CUBITT is a practical man—highly respectable
—in every way.
Mr. Jerrams (with much gravity). I was sorry to hear they were
pumping the water out of the building with steam-engines, after the
shower yesterday.
Er-Unprotected Female. Goodness gracious, me !
Mr. Smithers. Ah-indeed—well—ºf don't know. [Shakes his head.

and looks up to him accordingly). Oh! really, do you think so, MR.
WAPSHOTTP
The Rev. Grimes (making himself up for a burst). Indeed, I do, MRs.
Jones. When I think of the flood of French infidelity it will let loose
upon us; the benumbing poison of German rationalism on the one
hand—I’ll thank you for an orange, MR. John SMITHERs—and the
grovelling mummeries of Italian image-worship, on the other-thank

its tendency to puff up poor worms of men, and make miserable sinners

I tremble, MRs. Jon Es; I assure you, I tremble. -
The Er-Unprotected Female (who has been tremblin also). Oh! indeed,
it’s enough to make one, MR, WAPshott; and what with the Roman
Catholics, and the Pope, and CARDINAL WisemaN, and their nunneries,
and poor Miss TALBot, I’m sure one doesn't know when one's safe-
one really doesn't. - -
Mrs. Grimes Wapshott (who takes an ascetic view of life, and lives under
the constant shadow of the Seven Hills). Have you read the Female Jesuit
in the Family, MRs. Jones?
Er-Unprotected Female. No, Ma'am ; is it very dreadful?
Mrs. Grimes Wapshott (with gloomy cheerfulness). It shows us we are
not safe in the bosoms of ... . 's all. I hope you’ve looked
to the religious principles of your cook and housemaid, MRs. Jones?
Er-Unprotected Female (clasping her hands). Oh, Goodness! yes-I
think so. They are always asking to go out to Chapel. But I never
asked which Chapel they went to, and it may be the Roman Catholic
apel. - -
John Smithers (joyously). Ah! you ought to inquire, MRs. Jones;
for they say a good many young women of the first Roman Catholic
families are going out as cooks and housemaids, with a view to making
converts.

girls of good family. I’m sure Cook drinks.

man, and a Protectionist). Oh! I dare say—some of the foreign demo-
crats, of course. Serves our precious Government right. There’ll be a
fine row this summer º 'll see. -
Mr. Smithers, sen. Aff indeed. Well, I don't know. Those Socialists
are desperate fellows, to be sure; but then there’s the police.
Er-Unprotected Female º Oh! but then they’re nºver

now—(the Ex-UNPRotected FEMALE looks deeper agony.)
Rep. Grimes Wapshott. I believe the building’s perfectly safe-(The
Ex-UNPRotected FEMALE blesses him, in her heart). I think most of
the awful spiritual consequences of letting loºse upon us the poison of
German rationalism, the flood of French infidelity, and the mummeries

into despair.)
Gorhambury Gunston. Well, I don't think there's any danger to

the country. (A ray of hope breaks in on the Ex-UNPRopected FEMALE)

goods, and take all the gold out of the country.
Er-Unprotected Female (remembering her dividends). What! the

Mr. Doddles. Now, I think the Exhibition will be very good for trade,
you see. It will set an immense deal of money about.
Er-Unprotected Female (hitterig). Of course it will—but if it's our
money—the Government Funds, I mean— -
Mr. Doddles. But I expect there will be a revolution. You see,
there's the French Communists, and the German Refugees, and the
Italian Democrats, and the Hungarian Honveds, and the American
Sympathisers, and the Chartists, and the Red Republicans, and
Gavazzi, and the Christian socialists, and Lºuitoſis, and Mr.
REYNoLos—and they’re all sworn in a conspiracy, I’m told, to upset
everything; and of course that will convulse society, unless the police
put a stop to it.
Er-Unprotected Female (who has breathlessly followed this awful enºmera-
tion). Police, indeed! Oh! why don't all well-disposed people go away
this instant, and emigrate to the Continent, ºr New Zealand, or
Australia, or somewhere? (with the inspiration of despair.)—What is the
ood of staying here, to have one's Government upset, and one's money
in the Funds täkemiami one's throat cut—and one’s religion perverted

ever ought PRINCE ALBERT to think of himself!
Mr. Smithers (shakes his head). Well! I’m sure I don’t know
MRs. Jones.
[A general shaking of heads follows. MR John SMITHERs winks at
MR. Joseph JERRAMs. The Ex-UNPROTECTED FEMALE in-
dulges in despair. MRs. SMITHERs rises with mournful dignity,
and waves the Ladies to the Drawing-room.
KILRUSH COOKERY.
THE Guardians of the Kilrush Union
bught really to publish a cookery-
book of their own, for some of their
inventions throw even Soy ER into
the shade for economy—whatever
may be said of the nutriment which
their wonderful concoctions ma
afford. The London milkmen will
be grateful for the intelligence that
here is something cheaper even
than chalk and calves' brains, to
increase the supply of the “genuine
milk” from that mysterious cow
who is kept so completely in the
background,though furnishing such
floods of the lacteal liquid from day
- * -- to day. The Kilrush º
for making new milk requires a gallon of water, half-a-pound of ground
rice, a little flour, and a little real milk, to make two gallons of “new
milk from the cow”—but how remote “from the cow” it is not necessary
to specify:
†. above will no doubt whet the public*...". for further speci-
mens of Kilrush cookery, which we trust will be forthcoming for the
benefit of all economical families.
WHAT WILL BE WANTED AT THE EXHIBITION.
Owing to the extent of the Exhibition, we think a Map will be wanted
to explain to travellers the line of country they are traversing. Great
ingenuity might be displayed in giving names to the many hundred
streets formed by the different counters. Capital towns, and the names
of great men, for which the respective countries are distinguished,
might stand sponsors on the occasion, Thus, Shakspeare Street might
form the principal street of England–Rue d'Alerandre Dumas would be
sufficient to tell the Exhibition voyageur that he was at that moment
in France—and Platz von Herr von Joel would at once give the necessary
information,that Switzerland was the country whose Gruyère cheeses were
exacting the visitor's passing admiration; whilst, if that celebrated sifteur
was on the spot to whistle some of his most bird-like airs, there could
not be a doubt about the matter. Some such system as the above will
be requisite, or else a person will be losing himself in the middle of
China without knowing where he is, or roaming amongst the savages
of Africa whilst he is only communing with the French at Algiers.
A. Directory, also, would aid a person in the pursuit of his in-
yestigations,—or else we pity the postman who has to deliver a letter
in the Exhibition to any one of the thousand BR.owns, Joneses, and
Robinsons who will be installed there. But the Directory, of course
could not be proceeded with until the Map was perfected,—for it would
be folly to go in search of a man, until you knew the name and number
of the street in which he lived. It becomes all the more urgent, there-
fore, to proceed with the Map as quickly as possible, or else we shall be
surprise i. morning with an §º like the following in the
second column of the Times:—
RABELLA is ENTREATED to return to her disconsolate Husband, from
whom she got separated yesterday in the great crowd of the Exhibition. He is
waiting most anxiously for her at the Tenth Pillar, opposite the Cake Stall, in the
Middle Aisle, near the Statue of Despair, on the right-handside as you enter at the
North Gate. To facilitate the recognition, he is wearing a white hat. Come, dearest
Arabella: your devoted Husband will not abandon his post till the very last minute of
the usual dinner hour.
Two of a Trade can never, &c.
MANY of our Dramatic Authors have sent in their names to the General
Interpreters' Society, with the laudable intention of offering their
talented services as interpreters to distinguished Frenchmen, during the
forthcoming season. They have sent in several of their most success-
ful pieces as testimonials of their ability. The usual Interpreters are
calling out loudly against this interference, which they characterise as
being all the more ungenerous, as, with a far better knowledge of the
French language than the Dramatic Authors, they have never thought of
interfering with their business... But they declare, if the latter persist
in their intention, that they will have no other alternative—much as
º: º lose in public estimation by the step—than to turn Dramatic
uthors :

MRS. BAKER'S SECOND FLOOR.
THERE never was, Mr. Punch,-never, such a man as BAKER. He
will so have his own way. A woman might as well have been married
to a steam-engine of forty horses’ power | Here is the world's show,
with the Glass Palace—which, by the way, wants nothing but to be
lined outside with quicksilver to make it all that a woman could wish
—here is the whole earth making all its ends meet, and BAKER—my
hº I was going to say, unfortunately, but I'll keep my temper
though I am his wife—my husband, PETER 'BAken, will so put himself
over the heads of his fellow-creatures, that he won’t, on no account, be
brought to take a penny of their money. That is, he wouldn't, if he
had his own way; which, as being the mother of BAKER's children, it
is my duty he never shall have.
Mr. Punch, if there is anything for which you are cherished in the
bosoms of families, it is for your tenderness towards what is called—
with no compliment, as I take it—the weaker sex. And why are we
the weaker? Not by Nature, but by Act of Parliament. . Only give
women their House of Commons, and see if we wouldn't be a match
§ * strongest of you. But that’s not my complaint at present;
ut this.
We have the prettiest little mansion—BAKER will call it a bird-cage
—in Wallflower Row, Camden Town: at the present minute, with its
bright green shutters, and red sashes, and a bran-new Insurance, plate
of the Hand-in-Hand, upon the wall—and the brass door-handle shining
like Moses's gold—and the scraper black-leaded—with primroses, in
the window—and muslim curtains--and a lark lºsiº outside on his
turf, as if his throat wouldn't hold his, happiness, Haltogether, I will
say it, a love of a house; that is, a real bit of Paradise! ... Yes; I am
bold to say, when the smell of the paint goes quite off, sitting in our
front parlour, you'd think yourself in the Garden of Eden'
Well, with such a mansion and at such a time-with a mansion of six
rooms, and only fourteen in family—for up to the present, we’ve only
nine children, my mother, myself, sister SARAH-who’s every day
going to be married, and lives with us till she’s quite settled—SUSAN,
the maid, and—yes, and BAKER—with only fourteen in family, and such a
house, ought we to fly in the face of fortune, and shut our doors to the
stranger ? Such were my words to BAKER, and I might as well have
thrown 'em away upon the hippopotamus.
However, when I’ve a thing in my head, I’m no more to be turned
aside than a crocodile. What doid, but go to M.R. BETTERTON Sock,
who lives, somehow, at the milk-shop; a great scholar, cut off from
thousands a-year—as MRs. SoCK so often tells me—by the will of an
uncle, who, when he heard that his nephew had gone upon the stage—
for nothing could keep him off of it—painted his house black, and let
his beard and nails grow for the wounded honour of the family,–what
did I do but go to MR. Sock, and ask him to write me a beautiful
advertisement, a little spiced and coaxing like, as if it was a thing for
a theatre royal play-bill—yes, just an advertisement of our second floor. 1
wanted to let the first; but f knew it was of no use. We sleep in that;
and BAKER would as soon give up his life as fº up his bed-room.
Else, what money it would have brought! With that beautiful, cane-
coloured four-poster; and the bed furniture, an Indy wood, with poll.
parrots pecking at citrons and oranges, and humming-birds buried in
flowers, and the EMPEROR OF CHINA and his Court taking the air in
alankeens—(the very furniture that was my grandmother's, that I
É. to BAKER when I married him, that is at this minute as fresh
as a new-blown rose)—what would such a bed have brought P But I
know one might as well take a vulture by the tooth as talk about it
to BAKER. -
So I just told MR. Sock that I wanted to let my second floor, and
asked him to draw it up in a nice way for the newspaper; whereupon,
MR, Sock takes pen and ink, spreads his left hand like a plaster all over
his forehead, and after biting the pen a bit, and making mouths at the
ceiling, he writ what follows below:—
O THE STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.—A SISTER of
the Great HUMAN FAMILY (about to visit London) proffers the Palm Branch
of Hospitality? Her TENT is pitched within a pleasing pilgrimage of the CRYSTAL
PALACE ; the oasis of the Regent's Park shining in its emerald green betwixt her
and the WORLD'S FAIR. A Second Floor, divided into two rooms, is the happy
home—on the most moderate terms—awaiting a small Family. A gentleman and his
wife may be accommodated with more than Arab cordiality. Or two Gentlemen would
be preferred. No Persons of the Turkish persuasion need apply. Terms, Four Guineas
a week, Boots included; if with latch-key, Five Pounds Ten. Apply, personally, at
No. 1, Wallflower-Row, Camden Town.
There, Mr. Punch, I call that a beautiful thing, out of the common
way; and for all that, when I laid it in the newspaper before MR.
BAKER, he called it trumpery, and begged to know if the wife of his
bosom wasn't gone clean mad? -
“What do you mean by second-floor—where do you find it?” asked
AKER.
... Where do I find it!” said I, “why what's the floor above us?”
… The garrets, and you know it; the garrets, where you can't swing
a cat l”
“Garrets, indeed! That’s how you pull down everything. I’ve
had them beautifully º: with a paper that’s coloured with a
tobaccº-plantation, with slaves and all, as natºral as life; and if, in
these times, that second floor isn’t worth a poor four guineas a week
it's worth nothing.
...And, MRs. BAKER,”—said BAKER to me, in a manner as if I was a
wild woman, without feelings for my little ones—“and what do you
intend to do with the children? Where are they to sleep?”
I didn't answer him—I wouldn't trust myself; as if f hadn’t taken
f. care of beds for the whole precious nine of 'em somewhere in the
1Ouse.
But the fact is, Mr. Punch, BAKER—though he's my husband—is a
man without what is called public spirit. He does nothing but abuse
the Crystal Palace; and has no notion of turning an honest penny upon
hospitality. And this, too, at a time when everybody’s throwing their
doors open; and the World's Family are meeting at our firesides—and
when, with a little squeezing for a few weeks, more than a twelve-
month's rent is tº be made out of one's foreign relations.
However, I only wish you could see our second floor! I did think
of following MR. BETTERTON Sock's advice—only BAKER is such a
man—and sending out cards to all the newspapers to come and look at
it, with sherry and ham-and-beef sandwiches; but, Mr. Punch, if Wall.
flower Row, Camden Town, doesn't lie in your morning's walk, you
may take my word for it that two sweeter, livelier rooms—specially
since I’ve hung up four canary-birds in each, to give a life to the
tobacco-paper, where there’s the tobacco in every stage, from blossom
to leaf-as the paper-hanger told me—with the slave and his whip, all
º: more to show off to our foreign brothers the freedom of BRITANNIA’s
soll,—
If, as I say, you can't come yourself to Wallflower Row, you may—
But I’m interrupted by a double-knock–I’ve put my head out of
window:-Two foreign brothers come, as MR. Sock says, to demand the
hospitality of our second floor.
THE MAY QUEEN,
You must see they call me early—call me early, that’s a dear!
To-morrow will be the least of a joke of all days in the year.
No doubt twill go off well, love—but still 'tis a trying day;
For I ‘. the Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am the Queen, and it’s
ay.
I'll go through it without a sigh, love, for your sake and for mine;
But, oh, how happy I shall be when we get home to dine !
I hope they’ll have it over soon, and let us get away;
For *. the Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am the Queen, and it 's
lay.
Pray tell Gold-Stick in waiting, that the moment he awake
He'll have all the Bed-chamber Ladies up before the day doth break.
You know those horrid Robes of State must be º on for the day;
For I am the Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am the Queen, and it’s May.
Little ALBERT shall go with us—it is well he should be seen;
And sº 'll tº: care and bow, dear, when they cry “God save the
UEEN '''
When I can’t bow to them myself, any longer, that’s to say :
For I º, ". Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am the Queen, and
1U ’s May.
There’s Colon EL RowAN round the porch will muster all his powers;
And I trust, to damp our pleasure, we shan’t have any showers;
You know I carry the sunshine where I go, as the people say;
For the Queen, 'tis always May, my dear; for the Queen, 'tis always May.
The carts still come and go, I hear, unto the house of Glass;
And the helpless folks in Śiś they grumble as they pass;
But, of course, dear, all must be ready, or what will the º e say?
For I º, º Queen, and it's May, my dear; I am the Queen, and
It 's May.
I haven't the least doubt, love, there’ll be no behaving ill ;
That they'll cheer us, as usual, down Constitution Hill;
That for rich and poor alike 'twill be a merry-making da
For I am the Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am §
e Queen, and
it’s May.
So you’ll see they call me early—call me early, that’s a dear!
To-morrow will be a triumph for you, love, never fear;
But still you know it’s sure to be a very fatiguing day;
For I ". the Queen, and it’s May, my dear; I am the Queen, and it’s

FEWEST WORDS SOONEST MENDED.
We understand that during the visit of the French
to London, an evening will be set apart at every London
theatre, when a F. will be performed without dialogue,
as the action will speak for itself, and will afford a picture
of French life which every Parisian—in the habit of visiting
the theatres of his own city—will at once recognise. The
dialogue would be a mere encumbrance in the eyes of a
Frenchman not understanding the English language; and
the incidents, as shown in action, will be such as he will
from previous acquaintance speedily catch the meaning
of. We have only, to recommend the restoration of the
French titles to all the “new and original” pieces that
have been produced on the English stage for the last year
or two; so that the play-goer from the other side, of the
water may select those pieces with the plots of which he
is already familiar. Considerable success has attended the
publication of songs without words; and we have no doubt
of an equally happy result to the experiment of plays
without dialogue.
Eastward Hoe for the Aristocracy.
Rotten Row is now—pretty much what its name im-
plies. In fact it may be pronounced to be decidedly in a
state of decomposition. T. notion of providing a substi-
tute for it by cutting out a horse-course in Kensington
Gardens, is unpopular, and, indeed, atrocious. The superior
classes had better abandon Hyde Park for this season,
and retire for quietude to that part of Town which hitherto
has rejoiced in the appellation of slums. We would sug-
gest to the equestrian and vehicular aristocracy the pro-
riety of seeking a temporary. Row and a succedaneous

Of Church Mice yee have herde before,

And half a Papyste, still thys Ratt

With gold, and carvyng, and with paint

And many an olde wryneckèd Saynt

As yff prayeres shold not be said,
But snofled, drawled, and droned.

With flowers about theyr stickes,
Would ducke, and turne, and ducke agayne,
With other soche antickes.
To preche without a surplice on,

And wolde have hadd his flocke, eche one,
Confess to hym for shrift.
And then men's wives and daughters went,
For all that they colde say,
And yn the Westrye wyth him spent
Sometimes nye half the daye

There never was a nuisance yet so foul, but
it was sure to find some one to praise it.
It is the poor shirt-maker who sows, but
the slop-seller who reaps the advantage.
It is a kind legislature that takes the same

But, longe as he colde staye,

And then he ran awaye.
His orders now he did declare

And his confessionall a snare,
His shrift a hoax and shamm.
He went unto hys lorde the Pope,
And bent to hym the knee;
As all soche Rattes wyll doe, we hope,
As quicklye as may bee.
And Ponche, meanwhile, with staunch ferret,
And good dog Tobye alsoe,
At all such varmyn Rattes will sett,

HOUSE OF CALL FOR BEAUX.
THE number of persons likely to visit London this year has been
calculated almost to a child.
The number of ladies, it has likewise been calculated, will probably
exceed the number of gentlemen by a proportion of, at least, 5 to 1.
This is very agreeable; but the question is, how shall we be able to
entertain so many ladies? Are there beauz enough to escort them
about town 2
. It is a very well-known and painful fact, that the beaua are a very
limited class. It is believed that they went out of existence with the
hackney-coaches; at all events, you may walk for miles before you meet
with one. If, then, the supply is scarcely sufficient to meet the present
demand, what will it be when there are another million of ladies im-
. into London? There will barely be one beau to every thirty
amliles .
. From the above analysis it is perfectly clear, that, whilst one family
is being shown the marvellous wonders of our Metropolis, twenty-nine
will have to stop quietly at home. It is out of compassion to those
twenty-nine families that we trouble ourselves to make the following
proposition:-
We propose that the names of all the available beaua about London
be collected, and inserted alphabetically, with their heights, and colour
of their hair, in a Register to be ...?“The Beaur of all Nations.”
This being done—and the regulation that no Beau should exceed the
*. of forty-nine, being strictly adhered to-certain houses should be
en in the leading thoroughfares about London, where those Registers
should be kept; so that they might be consulted by mammas and
*Hºº at all hours of the day.
he small fee of One Shilling should be paid upon each consultation
-or subscriptions for the month, or season, might be allowed at an
economical rate, entitling the subscriber to an unlimited inspection of
the Registers.
The Beaux should be divided into Three Classes.
The First Class should be CITY, or WALKING BEAUx.
The Second should be WEST-END, or CARRIAGE BEAUx.
...And the Third, OPERA, BEAUx—warranted good for evening parties,
pic-nics, horticultural and botanical fêtes, and if need be, ...
The name and address—and, when it will stand the test of inquiry,
the pedigree also-of every Beau to be carefully kept in the Register.
As an indispensable condition, every Beau must be well dressed, and
partially good-looking. - -
To facilitate reference, portraits might be appended by the side of the
name; or, better still, in order to avoid unpleasant shocks, and
against disappointments, a small assortment of beau: could be kept,
ready gloved or spurred, as samples, for inspection in the Office, similar
to the plan adopted at many of the Servants' Bazaars.
The rate of subscription should be very moderate, and there should
be family subscriptions, as at circulating libraries, to enable a family,
where there are many young ladies, to change their sets of beaux as
often as they please in th. course of the day. A higher rate should be
charged for beaux with ºl. leather boots and
French beaux to be ta
Irish beaux allowed. - -
Every beau should be well accomplished in all the small talk current
about town; should command a smattering of one or two continents
languages; should be walking directories of the districts in which their
services would be required; should have a general knowledge of shopping
and should not be above, if occasion required, carrying a lady's poºdle.
Some such valuable institution like the above will be needed, or
else the streets of London, during the forthcoming gay season, will be
robbed of some of their brightest ornaments, from the fact of nineteen-
twentieths of our female visitors not being able to venture out of doors
for the want of a proper beau to accompany them. Whereas, with a
“House of Call for Beaur of all Nations,” mamma would have only to
walk into the Office, and settle the difficulty at once, by calling “the
First Beau off the Bench l’”

AMong the most interesting objects in the Great Exhibition, will be
found a wonderful specimen of the most elaborate carving—consisting
of nothing less than a ham, carved into 5000 slices of the most delicate
texture, by a waiter at Vauxhall. He has employed his leisure hours
for the last twenty years in completing this extraordinary triumph of
the art of carving, and so beautiful is the workmanship, that the
material is rendered quite transparent; the minutest, fibre is plainly
traceable; and how there is substance enough left to hold together, is
the source of universal astonishment among all who have seen this
marvellous piece of waiter-craft.

IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS.
URELY the Clerk
of the Weather
has set his face
against . Fairs;
for it is now
some years
since appropri-
ately fair wea-
ther has shone
upon the stalls
and shows of
Greenwich. On
Easter Monday
and Tuesday
the fun of the
Fair, was des-
fined to experi-
ence a very long
rain, and a by
no means merry
- - - - - one. Parties
of Ethiopians were going about in a soaking state, proving the possibility
of washing the blackamoor white; and the Ghost of Richa RDsos, as he sat
in a shower, with his chalked face, eating his bit of bread and cheese,
exemplified the fact, that the distinction between chalk and cheese
is not always easy ; for, in this instance, the chalk and cheese
were being sadly mixed together. The Clown's dry humour was
amped by his wet, clothes; and the black ringlets of the Willain
Were hanging, horridly out of curl, over his highly corked countenance.
The penny portrait painters could not draw in chalk, or oil, because
9ſ the water which ran in torrents through their canvass, and FRazier's
Circus, though making a great splash with its horses, was open in vain,
for no one cared to see the noble animals plunging and kicking about
in the puddles. ... Even in the town, the weather threw a damp upon
everything, for, the “Collegians” could get nobody to pay a penny to
look at a black beetle under a glass-case, in a pelting shower; and
hot water for tea was not required where cold was so plentiful. It
would seem that the fates regarded Greenwich Fair as a stain upon us,
and are determined to wash it, by giving it a soaking every year, when
opportunity offers. Whether it will ever be washed fairly out, is a
question we cannot undertake to answer.
ALDERMEN IN OMNIBUSES.
The world of London—the present world, and the foreign world to
come-owe, and will owe, a debt of gratitude to MR. ALDERMAN
CARDEN. He has,within these few days, unconsciously suggested a
nºw and important benefit, to be obtained from Aldermen in the lump.
He has shºwn how omnibus-conductors travel in fear of Aldermen;
and upon learning the dignity of their passengers, become instan.
taneously changed into perfect gentlemen. Mouths of Billingsgate
become mouths of gold. One WILLIAM BURGEss, No. 1540, was
summoned º the Alderman for refusing to show his badge; accom-
panying such refusal with certain flowers of speech, not quite so
§. as the pearls and diamonds of the young lady in the fairy tale.
uddenly, No. 1540 learned the civic dignity of his customer, when—in
the Alderman's words—the conductor overpowered him with civility,”
well-nigh smothered him with roses. Nevertheless, the Alderman, with
proper public spirit, summoned 1540, who was fined in a mitigated
penalty, in consideration of his miraculous ſº of after civility.
Now, we would º to the honourable Court of Aldermen a little
amount of self-sacrifice ºf the summer months, with so many
thousand strangers omnibus-bound for the Exhibition. We would
propose that not a less number than six Aldermen should, day by day,
take it in turn to ride, from eight in the morning until ten at night, in
omnibuses plying towards the Glass Palace; that the fact of the half-
dozen Aldermen so bestowed should be made known, though—as far as
possible—the identity of every Alderman should be kept a secret; in
order that omnibus-conductors, in doubt whether they carried an
Alderman or not, should, upon the very suspicion of such passengers,
be as civil to all men-foreign and native—as was the penitent WILLIAM
BURGESs to ALDERMAN,CARDEN. HAROUN ALRAschid wandered incog.

MR. PUNCH'S COUNTER AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
As nothing, now-a-days, is complete without the presence of Mr. Punch,
we have opened a Counter at the Exhibition. It is not for us, to admire
it—that is a pleasure we cheerfully leave to others. The value of the
Counter,however, will be best proved by the following short description
of a few articles exhibited in it :- - - - - -
An Omnibus—that will allow a person to sit down with his hat on, and
give him plenty of room for his legs, without incommoding those of
other people.
A Lady-Jumper (on the same principle as the ºl. keep
º § quiet at home whilst the husband goes and enjoys himself at
lls Ulub.
A Latch-key—which really has the effect, falsely attributed to most
latch-keys, of turning every clock in the house three hours back,
directly the husband opens the street-door. -
A Machine for quarrelsome households, for enabling strangers to see
at once which way the cat jumps. -
A new kind of Alarum-bell, in connexion with a Shower-bath and an
Italian Qrgan, for getting lazy servants º the morning. . .
A Lodging House Meatometer—to enable rural visitors to judge, by
the quantity of meat that is eaten each day, how much greater their
º is in town than in the country. - -
he New Revolver Shirt—that, by turning round a little to the right
or left, is made to display in succession the followin round of fronts;
viz.:-1°, a Coloured ront, pour la matinée ; 2°. a Plain Front, pour la
comenade; 3°. a Dress Front, pour l'Opera, ou le Bal; and 4”, a
Deshabille. Front, pour la nuit;-thus admirably combining four shirts
in one. Singularly adapted for foreigners.
A Machine for making Satin Paper Gloves—to enable persons to
make their own gloves, and quite as cheap as envelopes. -
The Washable Parasol—that takes on and off, and washes beautifully.
The Revolving Shoe for Horses—purposely invented to enable gentle-
men to ride on the wood-pavement, as a horse with this revolving
shoe only goes round and round, but never falls. -
A Revolving Heel for Young Gentlemen—who cannot waltz without
gettingW.; -
The VERDI Ear-Protector—to enable a young lady to sit out one of
VERDI’s operas without hearing any of the noise. -
The Modern Housewife's Best Friend. This consists of an improved
kitchen safe, which, by means of a spring, catches the cat (that dreadful
domestic marauder, whose voraciousness is only exceeded by his
destructiveness) the moment he ventures near it. - -
The above are only a few of the wonderful things contained in
Mr. Punch's Counter but they are all we choose to let the public into
the secret of this week.
THE CONSCRIPT FATHERS IN SMITHFIELD.
WHEN the city of Rome was entered by a barbarian invader, and all
the rest of its inhabitants had fled in dismay, the Patres Conscripti
alone remained at their post, sitting in awful dignity, and trusting (no
doubt with sufficient reason) to their personal appearance to scare away
the savage intruder. As a last resource, our modern Patres Conscripti,
the Corporation of London, with Senator and ALDERMAN SIDNEY at
their head, might adopt a similar expedient to repel the invasion of
Smithfield. Indeed there is now nothing else that they can do; let
them, therefore, arrayed in their robes of office, and wearing their most
solemn faces, º forthwith to the Forum or Market in question,
and seat themselves, with stern, determination, in the pens, and lairs,
along with Gog and MAGog: Their venerable aspect, may terrify the
sanitary aggressors, who will perhaps regard them as the tutelar deities
of the place. A ready answer may be given to the only reason why, the
Defenders of the Filth should not sit among the pigs. Their official
habiliments will suffice to show which are which,
ROYAL BACON (WITHOUT ANY GAMMON).
WE are informed by the Bury Post that
“It is understood that in this year there is a bond fide claim for the ancient guerdon
of the gammon of bacon. It is no secret that the applicants, who have now been blessed
in the bonds of matrimony about 14 months, are resident at Felstead, the husband being
a small farmer of his own land there, and a man of some property.”
Pooh, pooh! The applicants have been “blessed in the bonds of
matrimony” longer than 14 months. They do not reside at Felstead
but in Pimlico. The husband is a farmer, certainly; but not a small
one and he cultivates agriculture near Windsor—he did make hats
once; but has left off that business, and so much the better. It is true
that he is a man of some property—having been fortunate in his mar-
riage. Punch will say ng more, except that the Dunmow Flitch for
}. # to be called the Royal Flitch, and shown in the Great
xhibition.

man, who brought testi-
monials, of sprightliness
from his ambassador: a
French literary gentleman,
M. GQBEMOUCHE, some of whose admirable letters have already appeared in our columns; a
Castilian, resident in London, whose national liveliness has resisted even the depressing
influence of Spanish bonds; a Turkish gentleman, who gave up, for our sake, a lucrative
rhubarb walk; our friend, HE-siNg, of the Junk, who declared, in the flowery language of his
native land, that his wit should shine as the peacock's feather in the cap of the mandarin;
HAMET EL-WAADEE, who is likely soon to be released from his attendance on the hippo.
potamus, owing to the rapid increase in size of that animal, and his growing relish for English
society; together with eminent professors of the dead languages; and a Privat-Docent of
Göttingen, who engaged to crack jokes in any language, living, dead, Qr #. (that is,
half dead and half living,) such as the Provençal, the Lithuanian, the Rumonsch of the
Graubünten, the Frisian, the Wallachian, and a host besides. For the Celtic tongue we
secured an eminent native professor of the Erse, from the brown bog of Connaught (who
consented, at our request, to delay his departure on a tour in the southern hay-harvest
districts), together with an enthusiastic Cymric master of tongues from the well-known
village of Cwmbdfgrbth in Merionethshire, and an interesting Breton from the remotest
#.". of Morbihan. We were much pressed to include a corps of gentlemen of the
ebrew persuasion, who were willing to have abandoned the sale of the pencil for the use
of the pen; and the Aborigines Protection Society in the handsomest manner placed at our
disposal their interesting protégés Makee-to-pe-ka-to-me-pa (“the Artful Dodger whose
tongue is in his cheek,”) ñoſ. the Middle Island of New Zealand, and that truly pions and
awakened Caffre, Ma-ka-row. But we were obliged to decline all these valuable offers of
service, as we found that the office was already becoming a public nuisance. -
Our first attempt was to set our º of all nations at work to translate the jokes of
the current number...The result was not encouraging - -
laborateurs were terrific. Anything like, the writhings of the º in the agonies of a
pun, which never came, we do not remember to have witnessed before, even among the cattle
in a Smithfield Monday Market. º GoBEMQUCHE was perfectly satisfied with his own
performance; but laboured under the slight disadvantage of a total misconception of the mean-
ing of the English which he was rendering. As for our lively Dutch friend, we have no
reason to believe he has yet been brought fo comprehend even the nature, of a pun; though
this may partly be attributable to the fact, that the German would explain to him what he
called the “central idea of the ur-wort-spiel,” or original word-play. The Turk and the
Arab put our fun into such very fine language, that it read to us just like MR, LANE's
version of the Arabian Nights—in other words, was perfectly unreadable. HB-SING made
us talk such intolerable fruisms that our richest morsels came out of his hands as dry as bits
of his own Junk, Qur Göttingen. Professor, instead of translating our articles, went hunting
º distant philological relationships, and remote “... ities all through the room;
while the Erse, Cymry, and Armorican took to quarrelling so violently about the relative
antiquities of their respective dialects, that it was º by setting them all three on the
unhappy Saxon, that they were, at last, induced to º e peace towards each other.
We need hardly say that we did not recognise, our children in their new costumes. They
were no more like the good, broad-faced, fat jokes, which we entrusted to the hands of the
foreigners, than the pale, long-haired, spindle-shanked, scatter-brained, and staid-mannered
boys and girls, that a travel-stricken parent brings home from a running education all over
the Continent, are like the rosy, romping, rough-spun family that embarked under his care at
Dover, six years before... And then, to prevent our jokes from hurting anybody, they had
carefully broken off all the points. So we gave up that plan of getting out our “NUMBER

Wonderful Natural Phenomenon.
A GENTLEMAN who has made it his business
to attend to the phenomena of the weather
during a long series of years, has called our atten-

Vauxhall opened on the 1st of May, not a drop
of rain fell during the whole of the evening.

WISIONS IN THE CRYSTAL.
-- W. MALL boys, of a nervous
| º temperament and high
º ſº
^
| family, have lately-
as genteel society well
| knows, begun to see
wonderful things in
crystals. Angels —
ICHAEL, GABRIEL,
RAPHAEL: the shades
of the illustrious dead
— JULIUS CAESAR,
SHAKSPEARE, EMA-
NUEL SwepENBoRG,
NELSON; the spirits
of the flanets; the
Kings of the East
West, North, an
South, appear to and
hold familiar converse
with these young gen-
tlemen; who, more-
over, communicate
with the departed re-
latives of the be-
holders; , and will
bring you best remem-
brances from your
grandmother defunct,
or kind regards from
- your deceased uncle.
Now, Mr. Punch—whose clairvoyance extends considerably farther
into a millstone than that of anybody else, and whose vision is by no
means limited to the middle of next week—has also been peeping into
the Crystal; THE PAxton CRYSTAL: that beats DR, DEE's, or any
other conjuror's, as a wonder and a marvel, all to nothing.
. Immediately on his first peep into the Crystal, Mr. Punch found
himself fulfilling the request of JoHNSON.—
“Let Observation, with extensive yiew,
Survey mankind from China to Peru."
He beheld the whole of ADAM's race collected together for the first
time since they were scattered, on the plain of Shinar-shaking hands
together, with JoHN BULL in their midst, instructing them in that only
genuine mode of fraternising.
The vision then changed; and a grand intercommunication of notions
and ideas took place between the various nations—on a principle of
mutual instruction carried out on a gigantic scale.
A number of French culinary artists were seen, introducing the art of
civilised cookery among the Caribs, and other tribes of savages; and
MR. BULL also was—not unsuccessfully—displaying to the same
aboriginals, the superiority of roast beef over broiled prisoner, and of
plum-pudding over boiled missionary. Our Gallic neighbours, also,
were giving ourselves certain useful hints on the preparation of nutri-
ment; but, our own butchers were .# them with the raw
material. The Turks likewise were contributing their kiebobs, the
Russians their caviare—to the million, indeed—the Italians their
macaroni, towards a family dinner of all the human family. Even
Ireland—to complete the omninational harmony—offered her stew.
The dinner over, various loyal toasts were proposed; from the health
of our QUEEN to that of the King of the Islands—now no longer
Cannibal. Every conceivable wine sparkled on the board; but, the
* yºderal product of the vintages of all nations was a bottle of
real port.
But the nations were not satisfied with teaching each other the art
of common good living. To the banquet succeeded a vast pantomimic
conversazione on the subject of habits, manners, customs, and institu-
tions—good and evil. Russia abandoned the knout; Turkey the
bastinado. The Pope of Rome abolished the Inquisition and burnt
the Indºr Erpurgatorius, The CZAR granted a general amnesty tº the
political prisoners in Siberia. The EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA made it up
with the exiled Hungarians., The French appeared demolishing
barricades, and founding, in their place good institutions—mostly
derived from England. Several individuals of that impetuous nation
were also seen saluting a number of the A Division with great polite:
ness, as if, from observing the advantages of British order, they had
acquired a respect for a policeman. Even an Italian brigand had so
far improved upon his habitual image-worship as to go down upon his
knees to a constable's truncheon.
Mr. Punch beheld a great, free steam-press like his own at work, and
the KING OF PRUssIA stoking the engine.
Brother JonATHAN also was observed by Mr. Punch converting his
cow-hide into shoe-leather, and unrivetting the ſetters of a black man,
to whom he afterwards offered a glass of sherry cobbler and a cigar.
The same gentleman, also appeared grinding his bowie-knife into a
pruning-hook, and selling his revolving pistol to a marine storekeeper.
The scene again changed to a vast iron-foundry, where millions of
swords and pieces of ordnance were in course of being melted up in
order to be turned into º: and locomotives. The º:
concluded with a grand display of fireworks, the materials of which
consisted of all the cartridges in the world.
THE LAMENT OF THE MEMBER FOR LINCOLN.
THE First of May has come—and gone—
And there has not been any row;
And I am doomed to rave alone,
And tear my frantic locks—as now !
Whilst I #. the lightning's flash,
The sun was bright, the sky was blue,
And not a hailstone fell, to smash
One pane of that Transparent Do.
No band of Yankee democrats,
No Socialists, or Reds of France—
In Phrygian caps and mapless hats—
Of Revolution seized the chance.
They did not try to burn the Bank—
#. did not seek to sack the Tower,
To plunder the abodes of Rank,
And overturn the seat of Power!
They went not to the Regent's Park,
And let the bears and lions loose;
I know they had such projects dark;-
§ tell me not that I’m a goose!
On Manchester and Liverpool.
There marched no Communistic crew;
And has Alarm, then, been a fool?
And has Prediction proved untrue?
Safe in the Thames the ship if stands;
Safe is our House, and safe the Peers’;
And Downing Street no Chartist hands
Have pulled about those humbugs' ears.
The Palace, too, of Buckingham
Has not been levelled with the ground ;
And, oh, that hum, that hoax, that sham,
That glass bazaar is whole and sound !
Yes; that confounded shop of glass,
Made, British hands to underself
Those foreign vagabonds, alas !
Perceive it serves their ends too well.
The earth to gulp it will not ope!
The bolt to crush it will not fall!
That Exhibition—and the Pope—
Will be the ruin of us all!
ENGLISH FRENCH AND FOREIGN ENGLISH.
FROM the patoisnow becoming prevalent in our streets, by the awkward
attempts of foreigners to speak, English, and the still worse attempts
of Englishmen to talk in a foreign tongue, our metropolis is likely to
earn the name of the modern Babel, rather than that of the modern
Babylon. To alleviate the difficulty, it has been proposed to have an
office for registered interpreters, and we do not see why these useful
articles are not as deserving of registration as shirts and over-coats.
The present mixed jargon in which everybody is .."; to talk his own
language badly, in order to meet half-way those who do not talk it at
all, cannot be too speedily abolished. Another feature of the proposed
scheme is the exchange of foreign mone
present rejecting as “buttons” every thing in the shape of outlandish
coin that is offered to them. The extent to which they are dashing
*::::::: buttons at the tenders made to them is frightful to con-
mplate.
Punch's Overland Mail.
WE find, from the Overland Mail, vid Regent Street and Charing
Cross, that the successful generals, GRIEVE, ABSALON, and TELBIN, have
just made a very brilliant addition to our valuable possessions in that
interesting quarter. They have made themselves masters of the Tāj
Mehal, with all the valuable treasures it contains; and the spot is now
daily visited by hundreds, who are attracted to Waterloo place, just as
they might be to the plains of Waterloo.

temper of the omnibus conductors to a fearful extent, and they are at

SIBTHORPE'S GALLANT ATTACK ON | STREET NUISANCES.
WHAT I REMARKED AT THE EXHIBITION.
I REMARKED that the scene I witnessed was the grandest and most
cheerful, the brightest and most splendid show, that eyes had ever
looked on since the creation of the world;—but as everybody remarked
the same thing, this remark is not of much value.
I remarked, and with a feeling of shame, that I had long hesitated
about paying three *...*.*.*.*. I had seen the QUEEN
and PRINCE before, and so forth, and felt now that to behold this
spectacle, three guineas, or five guineas, or any sum of money (for I am
a man of enormous wealth) would have been cheap: and I remarked
how few of us know really what is good for us—have the courage of our
situations, and what a number of chances in life we throw away. I
would not part with the mere recollection of this scene for a small
annuity: and calculate that after paying my three guineas, I have the
Exhibition before me, besides being largely and actually in pocket.
I remarked that a heavy acket of sandwiches which Jon Es begged
me to carry, and which I pocketed in rather a supercilious and
grumbling, manner, became most pleasant friends, and useful com:
panions after we had been in our places two or three hours: and I
thought to myself, that were I a lyric poet with a moral turn, I would
remark how often in the hour of our need our humble friends are
welcome and useful to us, like those dear sandwiches, which we pooh-
poohed when we did not need them.
I remarked that when the QUEEN bowed and courtesied, all the women
about began to cry.
I remarked how eagerly the .."; Prince talked with his sister—
how charmed everybody was to see those pretty young persons walking
hand in hand with their father and mother, and how, in the midst of
any magnificence you will, what touches us most is nature and human
kindness, and what we love to witness most is love.
I remarked three Roman Catholic clergymen in the midst of the
crowd, amusing themselves with an opera-glass.
I remarked to myself that it was remarkable that a priest should
have an opera-glass.
..I remarked that when the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY was saying
his prayer, the Roman Catholic clergymen seemed no more to care than
I should if MR. LoNGEARs was speaking in the House of Commons—
and that they looked, stared, peered over people's shoulders, and used
the opera-glass during the prayer.
I remarked that it would have been more decorous if, during that
part of the day's proceedings, the reverend gentlemen had not used the
opera-glass.
I remarked that I couldn’t be paying much attention myself, else
how should I have seen the reverend gentlemen?
I remarked my LoRD, Ivorystick and my LoRD Ebonystick
backing all the way round the immense building before the QUEEN;
and I wondered to myself how long is that sort of business going to
last P how long will free-born men forsake the natural manner of
walking, with which God endowed them, and continue to execute this
strange and barbarous pas ? I remarked that a royal Chamberlain was
no more made to walk backwards, than a royal Coachman to sit on the
box and drive backwards. And having just been laughing at the kotoos
of honest LORD CHOPSTICK, (the Chinese ambassador with the panto-
mime face), most of us in our gallery remarked that the performance of
LoRD Ivorystick and LoRD Ebonystick was not more reasonable
than that of his Excellency CHOPSTIck, and wished that part of the
ceremony had been left out.
I remarked in the § cage, to which the ladies would go the first
thing, and in which the Koh-i-noor reposes, a shining thing like a lambent
oyster, which ladmired greatly, and took to be the famous jewel. But
on a second visit I was told that that was not the jewel—that was only
the case, and the real stone was that above, which I had taken to be
an imitation in crystal.
I remarked on this, that there are many sham diamonds in this life
which pass for real, and, vice versä, many real diamonds which "go
unvalued. This accounts for the non-success of those real mountains
of light, my “Sonnets on Warious Occasions.”
I remarked that, if I were QUEEN of England, I would have a piece
of this crystal set into my crown, and wear it as the most splendid
jewel of the whole diadem—that I would.
And in fact I remarked altogether—God save THE QUEEN.
Duality of the (Protectionist) Mind.
THERE were two ladies present at the Protectionist meeting at Drury
Lane. , These two, however, from the fact of their being only two,
created more sensation than two thousand. We know of but two ladies
who give their smiling countenances to Protectionism, and they must
have É. the singular two in question. We allude, of course, to our
inseparable *. of old friends,--MEsdames GAMP and HARRIs. The
fact of both ladies having umbrellas with them—with which they
kept vigorously thumping the floor—fixes the identity at once. We
#. exceedingly that Mrs. GAMP was not allowed to “propodge” any-
g.

no local lark to regulate
our movements, we ac-
cepted as a substitute
for the early bird, those

blåtk-birds, the sweeps,
whose cry was the sig-
mal for our rising.
Everything seemed
auspicious. Even
razor was

tem º º wi-
º
; stimate, we, shºuld
- ave had a terribly close
shave to join in sufficient time the line of equipages, which already,
before eight o'clock, extended in one. rank-a rank in which nº
aristocratic distinctions were observed—from the doors of the Crystal
Palace to the very centre of the Metropolis. Theº equipage of
the peer was obliged to fall in behind the humblest fly or the ugliest
#º ; there being no privileged qrder, but the ºrder of arrival.
The student in armorial bearings would have had a miscellaneous feast
in examining the panels of the various vehicles, which combined | the
brilliant blazonry of BURRE, with all the mysterious heraldry of the
cab-stand.
During the time of waiting for the opening of the doors, good-humour
kept up the spirits of all, except some of those who, being driven impa-
tiently by the side of the line, found themselves obliged to retrace their
steps on arriving at the park gates, and take their places at the back of
the whole string, which had ſº a mile or so since they º:
foºlishly quitted it. The contents—or rather the non-contents—of the
vehicles in this dilemma, afforded amusement to those who had fallen
in at once with the regulations, and, º the former .# seen returning
a good deal farther back than the place they came from, it was clear
that the occupants of each carriage were throwing, sometimes, upon
each other, but more often on the unfortunate driver, the blame of their
failure. Nevert eless, the arrangements were so excellent, and every
foot of ground was so well º: that scarcely any one had
room for complaint, §º perhaps, when a passing coal-waggon made
every one wish the Wall's-end at the World's End, or when the carts
of a suburban milk company, returning from the morning supply of
their customers, intruded with their “pure milk” among many who
thought themselves for the moment the cream of elegance, and turned
somewhat sour at the contact.
The doors were at length reached, and the crowd waiting the arrival
of HER MAJEsty, furnished an exhibition of various kinds of industry
not represented within the doors of the Crystal Palace. Every available
place for catching a sight of the procession had been taken possession
of in every available manner. Our friends, the Bedouins, who, accord-
ing to the Astleian views of their habits, run about piled on each others' Q
shoulders in pyramids, four or five human stories high, were equalled,
if not surpassed, by our native acrobats. Looking at the doubtful
security of those forming the capitals of these strangely constructed pil-
lars, we could not help º ising inwardly º: e danger of a high
position, even when resting on the shoulders of the people, The trees
opposite the principal door seemed to have burst put suddenly into a
crop of eager bºys, who, in *: the warnings, ºf the police against
the forbidden fruits of juvenile industry, seemed º every tree a
legitimate tree of knowledge, if anything could be learned or seen by
climbing it. - -
. In vain did the constable, look up at the trees, and threaten the
juvenile branches, who felt there was little fear of their being taken
up, as long as their being got down was impracticable. Heer and
|ºpletely face to
# b
there an adventurous policeman would climb after the contumacious
urchin; but the latter, with provoking levity, would scramble on to
some bough too slender to bear the weight of the civil authority, who,
however, on this occasion, seldom lost his temper, though sometimes
losing his balance.
We º inter º building, and our first care is to find for the
beloved Judy ºne of those seats said to have been reserved for ladies.
With our usial good fortune, we secured a front place; and, indeed,
where should Punch be, but in the foremost ranks of those desirous of
showing loyalty and affection to the Sovereign? Having taken up our
arters, we had leisure, for the first time, to admire the wondrous
agnificence—the grandeur, enhanced by the simplicity—of MR.
Axton's building. We will not enlarge upon its merits; for Punch
isdains to echo the general voice; which, in this instance, is, in fact,
he º of the approval Punch himself was pleased to bestow on the
rst design of the architect. Where were the croakers and detractors
tº: knew the building was unsafe, º: it was strong enough to
gar the weight of their stupidi malignity combined?—and
where, ph where, were the formidable sparrows which we had been told
had §§ irremedially into the building; but which, if they inhabit any
hest at all, must occupy some mare's nest or other, of which, happily,
no trace is visible? -
tlength a cheer without, and #! rish of trumpets within, announce
the arrival of the Queen—and the Prince, whº by the idea of this
Exhibitiºn, has given to Royal Consortship a newº or, rather, has
§ ed fºr ever illustrious, in his own gase, a position too often
vibrating between the mischievous and the insignificant. fºrce
ALBERT has done a grand service to humanity, and earned imperishable
ſame fºr º an idea, the greatness of which, instead of becoming
less, will ap - |º as it recedes from tis. We are as yet too
- e with the object to see at once all its grandeur;
uţit w * more perceptible as we advance, just as the º and
tent of the mountain are but partially developed to the traveller who
not yet quitted it. ------ -
During the ceremonial, which was of a solemn and imposing nature—
and for which we refer to our merely matter-ºf-fact contemporaries,
it was not surprising that several eyes, including the Royal one, were
slightly crystallised ingraceful harmony with the Crystal Palace. While
the procedings were going on, the attempt to keep, the ladies of the
seats was given up as hopeless, and it was a pardonable instance of the
weakness of human nature, even in that stern piece of stuff, a metro-
politan policeman, that the constable, gradually growing absorbed in
the overwhelming interest of the scene, appeared to think that the
country would excuse him for attending more to the throbbings of his
heart than his ºrdinary beat, and that England would not be too
rigorous in expecting every man—that is, to say, every policeman—at
such a moment to do his duty. Nevertheless, so admirable were the
arrangements, that there was at the time specified really no duty to do.
At | conclusion of the ceremonial, a Chinese, carried away, or rather
hed forward, by his enthusiasm, performed suddenly, before HER
JEsty, an elaborate salaam, consisting of a sudden act of prostration
on his face, and when the individual rose up, the customatonce occurred
to us as the cause of the general flatness of feature and particular
squareness of nose of that flowery people, who, from their countenance,
appear to have been sown broadcast over a large tract of country. ...
eyond comparison, the most ºf incident of the day was the
promenade of the QUEEN and PRINCE, holding by the hand their two
eldest children, through the whole of the lower range of the building.
It was a magnificent lesson for foreigners—and especially for the
Prussian princes, who cannot stir abroad without an armed escort—to
see how securely and confidently a young female Sovereign and her
family could walk in the closest º: contact, near enough to be
touched by almost everyone, with five-and-twenty thousand º
selected from nº class, and requiring only the sum of forty-twº
shillings as a qualificatiºn for the nearest proximity with royalty. Here
was a splendid example of that real freedom on the one hand, and
perfect security on the other, which are the result of our constitutional
tº and which all the despotism and republicanism of the world
cannot obtain elsewhere, let them go on as long as they may, executing
each other in the name of order, or cutting each other's throats in the
name of liberty. It was delightful tº see the smiling confidence of the
UEEN, as-leaning on her husband's arm, the father and the mother
each holding by the hand one of the royal children—she acknowledged
the heartfelt cheerings of the enthusiastic but perfectly orderly multitude.
The only blot, as we thought, upon the whole proceedings, were the
unnatural and crab-like movements of one of our wealthiest peers, the
MARQUEss of WesTMINstER, and his fellow-official, the Loºp CHAM-
BERLAIN, whose in the pageant consisted of the difficult, but
not very dignified, feat of walking backwards, during the progress ºf
the procession. We hope the time is not far distant when, among the
other sensible arrangements of the present reign, a wealthy nobleman
may be released from the humiliation of having to perform before the
Sovereign and the public a series of awkward evolutions, which not all
!. skill of the posture-master can redeem from the absurdity at
o the contortions of the mountebank.

Not the least interesting incident of the day was a little bit of by-
play between the DUKE or WELLINGTON and the MARQUEss, or
ANGLEsey, who, when preparing to form the procession, engaged in a
slight contest, or rather passage, of arms, one attempting to pass the
arm of the other through his own as the privilege due to seniority.
The Duke eventually succeeded in causing the Marquess to surrender
his arm, which the latter never did before; and the two veterans, who
had been often side by side on the field º proceeded side by
side among the triumphs of the peaceful contest of industry.
A SKETCH MADE AT THE OPENING OF THE GREAT ExhibiTION.
We have left ourselves no space, had our emotions left us inclination,
to notice all, or any, of the wonders of the Great Exhibition, to which we
hope often to go, for the profit, not of ourselves alone, but of the public,
whom we mean to make our constant companions in our numerous anti-
cipated visits. We could not help, however, being struck by the glarin
contrast between large pretension and little performance, as º
in the dreary and empty aspect of the large space claimed by and allotted
to America. An enormous banner betokened the whole of the east end
as devoted to the United States; but what was our astonishment, on
arriving there, to find that their contribution to the world's industry
consists as yet of a few wine-glasses, a square or two of soap, and a pair
of salt-cellars! For a calculating people, our friends the Americans are
thus far terribly out in their calculations.
THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH.
To the Editor ºf “Punch.”
-- º me to call your serious and polite attention to the
extraordinary phenomenon, demonstrating the rotation of the Earth,
which I at this present moment experience, and you yourself or anybody
else, I have not the slightest doubt, would be satisfied of, under similar
circumstances. Some sceptical and obstimate individuals may doubt
that the Earth's motion is visible, but I say from personal observation
it’s a positive fact.
“I don’t care about latitude or longitude, or a vibratory pendulum
revolving round the sine of a tangent on a spherical surface, nor axes,
nor ºi. nor anything of the sort. That is all rubbish. All I know
is, I see the ceiling of this coffee-room going round. I perceive this
distinctly with the naked eye—only my sight has been sharpened by a
slightstimulant. Iwrite aftermy sixth goof brandy-and-water, whereof
witness my hand, “SWIGGINs.”

station-house.-Punch.

“TruTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION.”
THERE has recently been a cattle-show in Dublin, and we congra-

sonality shown in the following bond ſide extracts from the printed
catalogue:–
“26. R. Moore O'Fannºtt, Esq., M.P.-IA foreign Ass, from Malta.]
*636. James Fagas, Esq., M.P., Malahide-LAFat Pig.]
“678. AlpenwAs Gärshaº—ſome of the largest Hog Pigs in Ireland.]"
Surely there must be something more than mere coincidence in these
remarkable items. We could get over “MooRE O'FARRELL, Esq.,
M.P., a foreign ass from Malta,” as a possibility; but when we cºme to
the alderman, “one of the largest hog pigs in Ireland,” we fear there is
a little playful malignity in the case that is scarcely excusable.

THE MORNING, THE WEATHER, AND THE PEOPLE.
The morning of the lst of May, broke gloomily. There was muttering thunder about
6A.M., with heavy rain at 9; but about a "...i. 10 the sun just smiled enough to
disarm the aristocracy of their top-coats and umbrellas; and the crowd poured from Špital.
field; and Bethnal Green, mixing with the tide of human life that rolled and gurgled from
St. James's, Piccadilly, and May Fair, finally º: itself in multitudinous waves that
surged and beat against the doors of the Crystal Palace. But the aristocrats, like water,
found their level, and after awhile flowed into the building. Up to half-past 10 A.M., the
arrogant, Britishers had it all their own way; but at 12, wasn't “Rule Britannia” rather
changed to ‘Yankee Doodle's come to town?

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS PUT OUT OF JOINT BY THE YOUNG ELEPHANT.
ST. JAMESS PARK AND THE PALACE.
In St. James's Park, where is situated the Palace
in which the QUEEN, the PRINCE, and the children
spend three millions per annum—the upper out-
door servants of the Royal Family—I mean
them who board and sleep out, such as the
Mistress of the Robes, the Keeper of the Silver
Walking-stick—(silver, when I guess good hiccory !
will serve now !)—these out-door servants showed
about eleven. There was the Mistress of the
Silver Warming-pan as fresh as a rose, and the
Maids of Honour—(I will say that for 'em)—
like bunches of carnations. Well, they went
into the Palace, and after looking at themselves
in their glasses, they came out again, and—as the
court word goes, or, rather, went, for it's gone,
indeed, now—and “formed”— .
THE ROYAL PROCESSION.
There were eight carriages filled with the
upper servants, when came the ninth with the
QUEEN, the Prince, and little WALEs and
PRINCEss Royal. This carriage was drawn by
the cream-coloured horses that are descended from
HENGIST and Hors.A, said to be of Denmark or
Norway, but which is not material. However,
it will not take me, much out of my story here to
say, that before the day was over, those very
cream-colours were drawing two Brixton’busses,
filled to brimming with fraternal democrats.
The Royal coach with the cream-colours was
received by the people with quite a funeral silence.
Not a hat was moved, not a shout was uttered.
Indeed, there was such a profound pause, that
nothing was heard but the creaking of the Royal
carriage-springs, as the vehicle toiled its heavy
way up Constitution Hill. I need scarcely add

that HER MAJESTY, the PRINCE, and children, looked at the silence
about 'em, as if to ask where all of it was going to end?
HYDE PARK CORNER.
-- As the Royal Coach went through, the ...} there were loud cries of
Wire la République Sociale!” # a venerable man with a black plaster
ºver his nose, and the order b #. Climbing Monkey on his breast.
Three dastardly policemen dashed forward to seize #e patriot, when
ten thousand hands—at least, so it seemed to qur informant—snatched
the veteran from the menial grasp; and as for the policemen themselves,
#. to a late hour of the night not f fragment had been heard of them.
There was nothing but this brief incident to break the profoundly
significant silence that attended the Royal Procession to the very door
of the Crystal Palace; where the sounds of the hireling silver trumpets
proclaimed the arrival of Her Majesty.
THE TREES AND THE SERPENTINE.
Never since they first showed green buds had the Park Trees borne
such a crop of promise ! for, on every bough, on every twig, might be
seen, by the knowing eye, an enthusiastic member of the great social
family, quietly biding his time: ready, at the second and the word, to
drop to the earth, and carry out that great human triumph for which–
(as has before been shown in your everlasting columns)—so many
thousand foreigners, with beating hearts, had #. with their
suffering, down-trodden brethren in London! Oh, it was a lovely sight
for the true socialist, whose lively creed it is to think all property made,
like the stars and airs of heaven, for the common enjoyment of all men
—it was an º: to behold his brethren, clustering
thick as cocoa-nuts in British oak and elm | Nor was the Serpentine
without its lesson. There, around its banks, close as the beads of a
necklace, were tens of thousands of socialists, cºntemplating the
stream; and—with a terrible calmness—awaiting the hour!
ARRIVAL AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
At mid-day precisely, the QUEEN and PRINCE, and children arrived
at the door of the Glass House, when the trumpets sounded, and the
slavish musicians played—but for the last time in this iberated country
—“God Sare the Queen.” At the same moment, a fog—a truly national
fog—gathered over the building, and filled every part of it. The vapour
was so dense, that for a time it was impossible even to make out a single
beef-eater. Taking advantage of this auspicious event, the thousands—
(it is, at the present time, impossible to calculate anything approaching
the number)—the thousands of devoted foreign socialists, sworn to the
regeneration of the race, by some means formed themselves into an
ubiquitous body, and-all acting in concert—when the fog cleared itself
away, every policeman found himself a prisoner! Every soldier con-
sidered himself disarmed and incapable, and without ãº of a single
life, or the sacrifice of the meanest number, the monarchy of England
fell to the ground; and in its place rose, like an exhalation, the magic
fabric of the new social edifice Property was at the moment annihi-
lated; and everybody became in a twinkling the owner of everything!
LATE SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.
HER late MAJESTY, the late PRINCE, and the late royal children
returned to Buckingham House in an omnibus. The DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON, the MARQUEss of ANGLESEA, and other late military noblemen,
gave their parole to return to their homes to await further orders:
the late Lord ChancelloR emptied the purse, sharing the contents
among whatever brethren held their hands to receive them; and all ranks,
and all dignities, being there and then abolished, the great family of man
(of all nations) entered the Crystal Store without tickets; every brother
and sister taking to themselves whatever suited their taste and their
strength to choose and to carry. Turkish shawls and slippers found
ready customers; whilst the silks from Lyons were, by four in the after-
noon, gleaming and glittering in Bethnal Green and Shoreditch. It was
feared, at one time, that the great Mountain-of-Light diamond—the
Koh-i-noor—would be the sudden means of overturning the social
republic before it was well set up, there being so many claimants for
its glory. . It was, however, subsequently arranged, that the Mountain;
of-Light should be broken up into little Molehills-of-Lustre, and divided
-as far as they would go—among the brothers and sisters of the
human family, to be worn in rotation on Sundays and holidays.
The Glass Store being entirely cleared of its contents, by an early
hour in the evening, it was resolved by the new government that
Joseph PAxton be empowered to procure a banyan tree with the least

[.SCOURING A SOVEREIGN."
N
DUN-VISAGED Town hath scoured his sooty fronts—house and shop—to put on
3. fº face against the arrival of his expected guests from the four winds;
and it may be said with some truth, that the Metropolis presents a scrubby
appearance. A partial attempt was made to divest those wonderful works of
art, our public statues, of their dingy incrustation; and had it been general
and successful, so thickly are they covered with dirt, that the removal of their
coat would probably have given all of them the influenza. The subjoined
sketch represents a positive occurrence witnessed by our artist and ourself,
in walking through Pall Mall East on the evening but one before the opening
of the Great Exhibition.
Two men and a boy, mounted on ladders, were engaged in cleansing the eques-
trian statue of his sometime Majesty GeoRGE THE THIRD. One of the men
was at work on the horse, the other on the Monarch; and the boy was helpin
them. The material of this sublime piece of sculpture being bronze, the liqui
applied for the purpose of its ablution was dilute. sulphuric acid, or oil of vitriol;
and with this bland emollient the valet of metallic Royalty was washing the face
of his Majesty with a flannel cloth; but as tenderly as if the man had been a fond
mother, and the good old King a beloved infant. On the pedestal, beneath the
Sovereign's charger, was a variety of jugs and earthen vessels, no doubt contain-
ing a reserve of vitriolic and other cosmetics and Kalydors. By the help
of the acid, the molten image of George the THIRD was rendered partially
bright; thus evincing capabilities which were never displayed by the original.
me may question why the rest of our statues should not have been furbished
up as well. But the fact is, that they are conspicuous enough already, and the
brighter they were made, the more glaring would be their absurdity. Besides,
if ; Finest Gentleman in Europe wanted polish, it would have been impossible
to make GEORGE THE Fourth look respectable: and no one in his senses would
think of going to the expense of whitewashing the DUKE of York.
Bulletin.
CoLoREL SIBTHORP remains in the same state as when we last went to press.
On the day of the opening of the Exhibition, the Colonel said in (or rather,
out of) his place in Parliament:—
“He was not present at the Crystal Palace. He felt that his duty to Gop and his country
demanded of him that he should not go there !”
As we said, the Colonel remains as before; his head not yet being shaved.
We shall give the earliest notice of the operation when performed.
OH! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH THE ROW
By THE HoN. JEssam.IE LEAsowes.
(Dedicated to the Superior Classes.)
OH ! what have they done with the Row,
That was once so delightfully gay,
When it bloomed as the apple-trees blow
And the hawthorns and chestnuts in May?
With the flowers of the sunniest bank
Its blossoms of loveliness vied;
But the daughters of Fashion and Rank
Have deserted that elegant Ride.
I remember the dainty kid glove
Which the delicate riding-whip held ;
I remember the exquisite Love
That the nice little pony impell'd;
I remember the graceful salute;
I remember the dignified bow;
But where are the beaux of repute
And the beauties of quality now?
The young dragoon officers prance
# and down in their glory no more,
With the nobles—revealed at a glance-
Whom horses as thorough-bred bore;
No longer the plain sturdy cob
With the bishop upon him I see,'.
Nor the groom riding after the nob, --
Neat and trim as a horseman could be.
Alas, they have ruined the Rowl -
'Tis o'errun by the crowds that repair
To behold the Industrial Show, - -
... Which is commonly styled the World's Fair.
Very splendid that sight you may call; -
I’ll never pretend it is not;
But, oh! far the fairest of all,
The World's Fairhave abandoned the spot.
They have torn down the dear old wood fence,
So rural, and pleasant, and light,
And have set up a lot of immense
Iron posts, like great guns, on its site.
'Twas needful that they should provide
These fortifications, I know, -
'Gainst the throng that will press on each side,
And be crossing all parts of the Row.
And, ah, what a throng it will be,
To the concourse that charmed me of old'
What are beards—what are blouses to me,
And jackets of crimson and gold P
The turban—the fez—what are they—
What is any costume—to compare
With the tasteful and quiet displa
In the Season, that used to be there?
In the triumph of Commerce and Trade'
I know there is something that’s grand;
And the fabric of crystal has made
Its Inventor's a name for the land.
Of course, I am fully aware
Of the fact that all these things are so;
But I’m ready to cry for despair
When I think what they’ve done with the Row!
THE HEBREWS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.
MR. Goulburn, in the debate on the Jews Oath of Abjura-
tion Bill, is reported to have said
“They had now before them not merely a question about admitting the
Jews to the House of Commons, but to the House of Lords also.”
Undoubtedly. If the House of Commons, is to tolerate the
Jews, so must the House of Lords. What is sauce for goose,
is sauce for gander—if Punch may say so without committing
a double breach of privilege. Indeed, the House of Lords, of
the two, ought to admit the children of Israel the more readily.
Surely the long-descended Hebrew—whose name, occurs in re-
cords long prior, to the Roll of Battle Abbey, should be wel-
come to those who pique themselves on their pedigree. The
difficulty would be to find a suitable title for a Solomons or a
Levi. If we have strained a point in favour of the Israelites,
we may as well alter a letter. As an appropriate Solomonic or
Levitical title, Mr. Punch suggests Lord Discount.

PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HOSPITAL THAT BEATS BEDLAM.
MR. Punch is very happy to see that the “London Homoeopathic
Hospital” is largely advertised, under the patronage of that illustrious
lady of science, the Duchess of CAMBRIDGE, the LADY LINDsar, SIR
C. E. EARDLEY, BART., and numerous other philosophers of both sexes,
including a gentleman named Down Ey. Punch cannot too earnestly
recommend this valuable institution to public patronage. When a
fellow-being is seized with inflammation of the lungs, or some other organ
essential to life, and but for prompt medical assistance would perhaps
expire in a few hours, leaving a wife, possibly, and several children to
lament his loss, what an advantage it is to him to be enabled to obtain
that certain and instantaneous relief which is afforded by the billionth
part of a grain of medicine !
It is a pity that the Board of Management of the London Homoeo-
thic Hospital does not publish those numerous cases of fracture and
islocation which have been reduced by the administration of homoeo-
pathic globules, as also the reproduction of various amputated limbs,
effected—as certainly as any disease whatever—by the same
means. The Board, also, might as well have acknowledged those
edicts of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, which require that
the candidates for their respective diplomas shall have walked the
Homoeopathic Hospital; and, moreover, Mr., Punch misses ... the
respected name of the EARL OF ALDBOROUGH in the list of subscribers
to the institution.
A Richmond Trip.
“Is Protection dead?” After reading the following paragraph, we b
doubt if any sane man can, any longer, have a misgiving upon the
subject.
“Gentlemen,” shouted the DUKE of Richmond at the Drury Lane meeting, “we not
only must have Protection, but, what is more, by Heaven, we will 1 " (Immense
cheering).
Now, the will of a person is never publicly displayed until after his
death. Accordingly, we may look upon the above Will—coming, too,
from such good authority as the Duke of RichMonD—as the most
convincing proof that Protection is really dead; and we must say it is
most generous of the Duke to come in at the last moment and assist at
the execution.
A REALLY ALARMING SACRIFICE.
Eye Rybody knows there has not been much liberty in France since the
glorious Revolution, which made nobody free, while making free with
everything, and every body; but we were not aware, until our eye
lighted on the following advertisement, that the system of selling rail-
way shareholders had actually commenced in Paris. That the French
themselves have been fearfully “sold” by their revolution, is an admitted
fact; but the following notice seems to apply to others as well as their
own countrymen.
Tºlºs AND NANTES RAILWAY COMPANY.-Shareholders who
have NOT yet PAID the SIXTH CALL, due 20th June last, are requested
to do so at once, to prevent them being sold in Paris agreeably to the Statute.
By order of the Board, &c.
The above actually appeared a few days ago in the Times, and the
perusal of it is really enough to knock down, in one lot, all the English
shareholders in French Railways. We trust some member of Parlia-
ment will get up in the House of Commons, and ask LoRD PALMERston
whether any leave has been given to dispose of shareholders, by sale,
in Paris; for if it is only French leave that has been taken, we hope
it will be resorted to in every legitimate measure.
A PUN FOR THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
WE presented ourselves a few weeks ago at the Western door for
British Exhibitors, to offer the following pun, as a light fancy article
for the Great Exhibition. We were received with the utmost courtesy
the authorities, and the pun will be found as a companion, to
the Koh-i-noor diamond in the Crystal Palace. Passing the building
a few days ago, we found at the outer gate a tremendous piece of
granite in a cart, which some twenty horses were in vain attempting
to draw within the Park railings. Hearing that the enormous stone
had been brought many miles with comparatively little difficulty, we
could not help exclaiming, “What a pity it is that the granite, having
been brought thus far, should now experience so much difficulty in
being taken into the Palace, when the stone is within a stone's throw
of it!” The assembled multitude burst out into such an éclat de rire,
that the workmen were sufficiently invigorated to make another effort,
which enabled them to accomplish their task amidst deafening plaudits.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
M. GOBEMOUCHE'S AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF
THE GRAND EXHIBITION.
“In the good town of London, in the Squars, in, the Coffees, in the
Parks, in the society, at the billiards, there is but one conversation—
it is of the Palace of Industry; it is of the QUEEN and, PRINCE

“Polisemen flank the left pillar of the gate surmounted F. a Yase,
emblem of plenty; policeman flank the right pillar decorated by a lion
(this eternal #. lion, how his roars fatigue me; his tail does not
frighten me! his pternal fanfaronnades regarding his courage make me
puff of to laugh!)—and as nothing is to be seen in England without
undoing purse, a man at a wicket stops the influx of the curious, and
the tide J. pass the barrier except through the filter of a schilling.

these were the simple arrangements which it appears that the Britannic
genius has invented for the ieception of all people of the globe.
“I knock in the English fashion—the #. baronnet gives but one
knock, #. ostman, officer of the government, many and rapid strokes,
the LoRD º knocks and rigs. I am but the simple baronnet,
and SIR Gobemouche wishes to be thought no more singular than SIR
BROWN or SIR SMITH. - - - - -
“Two pages—blond children of Albion—their little coats, it being
spring-time, covered with a multiplicity of buds-fling open the two
beatings of the door, and I enter the little ante-hall. -
“I look up—above me is an azure dome like the vault ethereal, silver
stars twinkle in its abysses, a left-hand lancing thunderbolt is above us
—I read above, in characters resembling the lightning—‘Fille de l'orage”
in our own language, and ‘Symbolium of all Nations in English.’
“Is the daughter of the tempest then the symbol of all nations? ... Is
the day's quiet the lull after yesterday's storm? Profound moralist,
res—it is so—we enter, into repose through the initiation of the
iºn: . pass over the breakers and are in the haven!
“This pretty moral conveyed in the French language, the world's
language, as a pººl. to the entertainment—this solemn antichamber
to the palace of the world, struck me as appropriate as sublime. With
a beating heart I ascend further steps—I am in the world's vestibule.
“What do I see around me? Another magnificent allegory. The
cities of the world are giving each other the hand—the Tower of Pisa
nods friendly to the Wall of China—the Pont Neuf and the Bridge of
Sighs meet and mingle arches—Saint Paul, of London, is of accord with
his brother Saint Peter, of Rome—and the Parthenon is united with
the Luqsor Obelisk, joining its civilisation to the Egyptian mysteries,
as the Greek philosophers travelled to Egypt of old;—a great idea this—
greatly worked out, in an art purposely naïve, in a design expressly
confused. - -
“From this vestibule I see a staircase ascending, emblazoned with
the magic hieroglyphics, and strange allegoric images. In everything
that the Briton do Turks a deep meaning—the vices of his nobility,
the quarrels of his priests, the peculiarities of his authors, are here
dramatised;—a Pope, a Cardinal appear among fantastic devils—the
romancers of the day figure with their attributes—the statesmen of the
three kingdoms with their various systems-fiends, dragons, monsters,
curl and writhe through the multitudinous hieroglyphic, and typify the
fate that perhaps menaces, the venomous enemies that empoison the
country.
#. chambers of this marvellous º are decorated in various
styles, each dedicated to a nation. One room flames in crimson and
yellow, surmounted by a vast golden sun, which you see, in regarding it,
must be the chamber of the East. Another, decorated with º:
and piled with looking-glass and eternal snow, at Qnce suggests Kam-
scha #. or the North Pole. In a third apartment, the Chinese dragons
and lanterns display their fantastic blazons: while in a fourth, under a
canopy of midnight stars, surrounded by waving palm-trees, we feel
ourselves at once to be in a primeval forest of Brazil, or else in a scene

cottons? their commerce? Calico has been the baleful cause of their
foreign wars, their interior commotions. Calico has been the source of
their wealth, of their present º condition, perhaps of their
future downfall! Well and deeply the decorators of the Palace medi-

GROSS LIBEL UPON THE ENGLISH
LADIES.
We extract, from the Musée des Familles the
following libellous passage, which has been con-
tributed by a MossIEUR DEWEY, whose name
should be spelt WHEY, as the milk of human
kindness seems in his nature to have all curdled.
Speaking of English costume, he audaciously
says:-
“Ladies may be met with who are well dressed, although,
generally speaking, a sort of audacity is º: in
wearing the most irreconcileable colours. What gives
English women a somewhat bizarre appearance, is the
custom they have of swelling out their petticoats, by means
of circles of whalebone or iron: this causes them to resemble
large bells in movement.”
Now we ask of any of our readers, who are in
the least acquainted with the mysteries of female
attire, if the above account be true? Do English
ladies make use of any of the articles above
mentioned 2 Is “whalebone or iron’” ever used
in any part of an English lady's dress? Are
such hideous artifices ever exposed for sale in
any of our shop-windows? o—it is a gross
libel! We never recollect seeing anything of the
sort in Regent Street, or Ludgate Hill, or the
old Cranbourn Alley, or anywhere else, where
onnets, corsets, horse-hair petticoats, and all the
Accompanying charms of costume, that make
Lovely Woman so irresistible, are laid bare in
their Pºiº variety to the profane gaze of
Man. e mean to say, that the window which
had the hardihood to disclose such abominations,
would be instantly smashed to pieces.
If our Ladies are “great swells,” at all events
it is not Fº by the insidious means of pipes
and air-tubes, which Monsieur WEY has en-
deavoured to insinuate, in such a roundabout
manner, habitually hang round the graceful forms
of our native beauties. In the name of the fair
sex of our country, we declare that they are in-
capable of such 'hollow artifices. Monsieur:
EY cannot rank amongst the polite ways of
France, upon which his country generally prides
itself, or else he would never have thrown out
so base a calumny. If we had not so much to
do, at this particular season of the year, we
would run over to Paris, and ask him what he
meant by it.
WANTED: A BEADLE.
Two fine models—not to say dummies-of the

Gallery are effigies of that loyal ecclesiastic,
Thomas à Beckett, called Saint, by those who
retend to §: of sanctity, and CARDINAL
oRRoMEo (likewise sainted by the same parties)
in full canonical fig.; together with a similar like-
ness of the late ARCHBishop of, PARIs: all pre-
senting animposing display of what the Puseyite
mind, perhaps, might wish to be Anglican Church
Fashions for 1851. There are not, however, so
many figures à la Tussaup in the Exhibition as
there might be; and, contemplating those of the
popish prelates in their fine , Mr. Punch was
seized with regret that nobody has thought of
exhibiting, in all the magnificence of his parochial
costume, a British beadle, just to show that we
have one functionary, at least, connected with
the Church, whose attire, for gorgeousness and
rationality, may vie with the most extraor
fancy-dress in the wardrobe of Rome.

A GENTLEMAN FROM THR Countrar MisrAkhs. THE CRYsral sent by THE
Duke of Devonshirk For THE Koh-i-Noor Diamond.
FESTIVITIES AT THE MIDDLE TEMPLE,
ON Saturday last, and pursuant to the notice given by his Lordship at
the Lord MAYon's dinner on the previous evening, the Lord Chief
Justice of ENGLAND conferred with the Lord CHIEF Justice of the
QMMo).PLEAs and the ATToRNEY GENERAL, who are members of the
Middle Temple, and with the Benchers of that Honourable Society,
with respect to the fête to be given, in Middle Temple Hall, to the Bars
of all Nations and their ladies.
It was arranged that the entertainment shall take place on the 31st
9f next June, in order to give the foreign Benchers (and their ladies) time
: to reach England.
The announcement of the intended festival has, already, created
the most delightſul excitement in the Inn and its neighbourhood.
Twenty-four dancing-masters, from Vauxhall and the Casino, have
been engaged by the Benchers for the Members of the Senior Bar, and
they practise, incessantly, in the Middle Temple Hall, from 10 A.M.
till 4. Mr. Sººr Polkrºoms, after three lessons in the
Schottisch with Miss Flicker (of the de ballet), is said to dance
it very elegantly._MR HEAvyside, Q.C., MR. Bumpus, Q.C., Mr.
BELIosis, of the Western Circuit, and Mr. SERIEANT BANDYNAL, are
nearly, perfect in the Deur Temps Waltz; and, in compliment to the
#. Judges (and their ladies), the two most active BARons of HER
AJESTY's Exchequer are practising the Bolero.
..Besides the official instructors provided by the Benchers, fiddles and
kits are heard, all over the Temple. The staircases creak with the
incessant practice; learned gentlemen are seen dancing down Middle
§: Lane to the water-side—polking parties take place in Temple
Gardens—and we hear that MR. Squartetoes, the eminent special
pleader, to whom young MR. Tiptory had just paid his entrance fee of
one hun guineas, has turned his Pupils' Room into a dancing
academy, and has returned MR. Tiptoff his fee, having received from
#gºleman instructions in the Polka and the Two and Three-timed
altz.
MRs. SQUAREToes (who labours under the mistaken idea that MR. S.
practises in chambers with gentlemen only) is on her side arduous in
taking lessons at her private mansion in B-kºr Street, with the six young
ladies, her daughters. And four dancing parties a-week are given
by #: to which the whole of MR. S.’s Pupils' Room are liberally
InVlted.
Though there is a precedent for a LoRD CHANCELLOR dancing, yet,
as SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON was not a professional lawyer, it has been
ruled that the present Chancellor cannot professionally perform. His
Lordship will therefore look on while the LoRD CHIEF Justice of
ENGLAND, who suggested the ball, gracefully opens it with the lady of
an eminent Judge of the Scotch Bench (we believe we break no
confidence in mentioning the name of Lord Tullochgonum), and will
dance a Scotch reel.
MR. ATToRNEY and MR. SolICITOR GENERAL will perform in the
Anglo-German illes, with GRAEFINN SPRINGBoçK and BARONEss
HoRNPFEIFEN, the ladies of the Prussian and Austrian Chief Justices.
LADY MINos, wife of SIR.THOMAs MINos, of the Queen's Bench, and
LADY MARY PUNY, will dance in the same quadrille with the eminent
Wurtemburg, Jurisconsult, Von STERN, and the President of the
Bavarian High Court, Won RoHR. - - -
Some of #. heads of the Italian and Turkish Courts, being Ecclesi-
astics, will not dance; but we hear that the Vice-Chancellor and the
Master of the Rolls will have a rubber at whist with the Grand Cadi
of Constantinople, and the Chief Justice of the Roman Inquisition.
The Police *::::::::: of the Metropolis, and suburbs will attend
with their Clerks at the various entrances into the Temple, receive
tickets, maintain order, and keep out the Swell Mob. -
The celebrated Pump in Pump Court, the Fig-tree in Fig-Tree ditto,
will be brilliantly illuminated; and the Fountain in Fountain Court
will run during the whole evening, the most delicious Sherry negus.
It is j that gentlemen in Crown-Office Row, Paper Buildings,
King's Bench Walk, and indeed wherever else they choose in the
Temple, will put their reading-lamps, bedroom candles, &c., alºng the
lines of their windows, and thus effect a cheap but brilliant illumina-
tion, little costly to themselves, and not the least to the Inn.
If Members of the Bar and Students will provide their laundresses
with new ribbons, the Benchers will be much, gratified: and, as it is
impossible that the inn should feed the (multitudes which will be
E." on this festive occasion, it is suggested that gentlemen should
eave their teas and a little wine out in their chambers, for their
attendants’ refection.
Students of the Inn will be accommodated in the Temple Gardens
with seats and benches—they will be at liberty to inspect the fireworks
at Vauxhall, and will be supplied with cigars, from their own cases, if
they choose to purchase them, as usual. - -
Before the great Hall is open, the Silk-gowns and their ladies will
assemble in the Library... The Students' Washing-room, on the left of
the entrance to the will be, set apart for the Stuffs and their
families: where, for this night, the basins, will be silver, instead of
pewter; the soap Windsor, in lieu of the yellow commonly in use; and
the jack-towels of damask, richly embroidered with the arms of the Inn.
jºi will be served at twelve, in the usual style of antique splendor
and old English comfort. The High table will be provided by MEssrs.
GUNTER, and the Bar and their ladies will have separate tables of
four, with a leg of mutton (cold), a pat of butter, and four pieces of
cheese, and a bottle of port or sherry, for each mess. The excellent beer
of the Inn will be served in mimited profusion; but families requiring
porter will have to pay extra for that refreshment. -
Among the dances in rehearsal, we hear of the “King's Bench
Polka,”, the “Nisi Prius Quadrilles,” and a brilliant “Pas” by the
Old Bailey Bar. -
lliberal insinuations having been thrown out against Barristers,
members of this Inn, and it having been stated that MR. D–N-P has
agreed to introduce the wife and daughter of his tailor (to whom MR. D.
owes a small account) to the Middle Temple Ball, in the character of
his own mother and sister, we are authorised to repel this charge as a
foul calumny. The company, though promiscuous, will be truly select;
and a great, a touching, and a beautiful sight it will be, to see
ladies of every rank in the country, and from every quarter in the
town, sororising with each other upon this festive evening, mingling in
: sprightly ce, and sharing in the sumptuous hospitalities of
e Inn.
The nobility will set down, and take up, in Essex Street. As the
IQRD MAYoR's carriage will block up Middle Temple Lane, his Lord-
ship will come by water; and we hear of a large importation of lovel
ladies from the Sister Isle, mostly descendants of Milesian blood-roy
and relatives of the Irish Members of the Inn, who have engaged
steamers to Liverpool, and will bring the bright eyes and the elegant
tabinets of the Irish Vice-regal Court to figure in the ancient #.

PRINCE AIBERT AND THE CRITICS.
ccording to Woltai RE,
“Honest criticism is
the tenth muse.” But
this saying is only
another venomous
falsehood of the philo-
sopher; only one of
the huge sheaf of poi-
soned arrows still fly-
ing downward. We
are much grieved to
find PRINCE ALBERT
i. .a fallacy-
appily not ve pu-
lar—that the c º: of
literature and art
should be considered
with good r, and
even with delicacy.
Mere common ink,

an entry in a ledger,
or even to nicle
* a dreadful accident,
- a daring. robbery, or
an ingenious act of
swindling, is not the sort of fluid to drop upon a or to spºtter
on a picture. Treat the author as something only a little above
a begging letter-writer; consider the artist as merely bent upon ob:
taining money under false pretences, and-nineteen times out of
twenty—writers and painters are fitly entertained. This is an axiºm
of certain fast critics; an axiom valorously carried-out upon the
opening of the Royal Academy. For instance, a day or two º

Chronicle / And if we that every Chronicle is read by three
persons, why here is an R.A. made to look very small and very º
indeed, in the eyes of one thousand one hun of the population.
visitors of Great Britain' Is this nothing? -
However, come we to the opinions of PRINCE ALBERT, delivered a
few days since at the Royal Academy Dinner. The speeches of the
Prince have ever been distinguished by such fine sense, such delicacy
of appreciation, and such deep, unostentatious humanity-wide away
from the tinkling, philanthropy, the brassy benevolence of many plat-
forms-that we the more especially regret the short-coming of His
Royal Highness when addressing the R.A.s. He said:-
* Gentlemen, the production of all-works in art or poetry requires, in their con-
ception or execution, not only an exercise of the intellect, skill, and patience, but
particularly a concurrent warmth offeeling, and a free flow of imagination.”
Now, if these opinions of the Prince become widely acknowledged,
what will be the fate of “fast” criticism? Your fast critic should look
upon a picture as he would look upon an iron pothook—a thing
hammered out to order, and to be done by the hundred by the mere
hand of man; his heart and brain having just as much, and no more, to
do with the pieture, than has the farrier, who whistles while he
rounds a horse-shoe. Again, for literature: a book is to be considered
as an attempt to beguile the good-will of the reader, and to be treated,
nine times out of ten, as the petition of an impostor. Nevertheless,
hear what the good-hearted, but mistaken, Prince says of the claims of
art and letters. They are produced by feeling and imagination, and-
“This renders them most tender plants, which will thrive only in an atmosphere
calculated to maintain that warmth; and that atmosphere is one of kindness-kindness
towards the artist personally, as well as towards his production. An unkind word of
criticism passes like a cold-blast over their tender shoots, and shrinks them up,
** flow of the sap which was rising to produce, perhaps, multitudes of flowers
iru-t-
What mistaken benevolence isthis! Art, like a football, bounds the
higher the more you kickit: and for the effect of “cold blasts” on
“tendershoots,” why, the colder and more cutting the wind, the more
luxuriant the blossoms. We believe that artists and authors are
persons of a peculiar organisation, with a good deal of walnut-sap in
their frames; the more you thrash them, the better they flourish.
And wethink it the especial duty of the critic, in order to test the
vital strength of flowers in the bud, and fruit in the blossom, to drench
them well with a solution of vitriol; or, what may be readier at
hand, a copious flow of Day and Martin. It is also an excellent
custom-as-geese are sometimes turned in to bite-down vegetation
that promises to becomerank-to-put a “fast” critic on a young painter's
icture, or young author's book, to bite the thing to the heart. We
ave also read it to be the custom in certain vineyards to sendin an
ass or two to feed off the too luxuriantshoots. And thus they were
This is a weakness.
Hº: or rather criticised—“fast” criticised. Happy we are to
nd, for the true interests of art, that the Chronicle keeps a donkey!
In conclusion, we trust that PRINCE ALBERT will reconsider
his opinions; in their mistaken benevolence, they may tend to an
effeminate consideration of the claims of art and letters...No, no; let
us still dab mud on the palette of the painter; let us still mix dirt in
the ink of the writer.
Wild and rank indeed would be the vineyards of art and letters, but
for the judicious asses—both fast and slow-that prune the shoots!
THE “ALARMING FAILURE” GOVERNMENT.
THE present Ministry puts us much in mind of those commercial
concerns which, seem to exist upon “alarming failures,” “awful
sacrifices,” and “extensive bankruptcies.” Every week brings forth a
fresh intimation of something new in the “enormous depreciation”
line; and yet the Government goes on as usual. Among the novelties
of the season, the Budget has been continually ticketed, first, as simply
| “a failure;” then, “a terrific failure;” but it is, nevertheless, brought
forward again, with the emergetic words, “must have cash” attached
to it. S ten days are allowed to elapse without our attention
being called to a significant “Look here! Down again! Must go!”
as appropriate to something.org.ther offered to the public by the firm of
Russell, AND Company. We believe there are some houses in the
haberdashery trade that exist for ever on their failures; and the same
fate or fortune seems to support the firm or infirm which deals in
hashery and balder-dashery as its chief commodities. Being º
anxious for the credit and character of the Ministerial concern, we wis
we could see it lay in a stock of useful articles for national wear,
instead of endeavouring to keep afloat, hydisplaying now and then some
bits ºf patch-work, or some old remnants of stuff that nobody cares
about. The Ministerial Mart is getting as indifferent a character for
its measures, as some of the cheap tailoring establishments; and instead
of going on trying to cut their coats ing to their cloth, the
Government will be, eventually, obliged to cut it altogether. Though
the opposition that has been started has, hitherto, been rather weak,
the proprietors have commenced showing patterns ºf something better,
and designs decidedly newer, than those of the Government shop,
which—unless there is more spirit and activity-will have to be,
ultimately, vacated by its present occupants. -
A day or two ago, as we were passing along Trafalgar Square, strain-
ing our eyes for some object that would keep them of the Fountains,
our notice was attracted to our poor friend of the “glass ship,” who
accosting us with, “The very same ..º. honour, that was smashed
on Ludgate Hill,” solicited our pence and our sympathy. Not having
a heart of steel, but being burdened with a pocket full of coppers, we
indulged the feelings of the one, by lightening the burdens of the other.
As we passed on, we immediately thought of LoRn John, who seems to
take up his position by the side of the vessel of the State, and ask our
commiseration for the smashes and collisions it is continually encounter-
ing. There is, however, one important distinction to be drawn; for
while the ship of glass was da by no fault of its proprietor, the
state vessel gets knocked about for want of bold and skilful seaman-
ship. As Loºp John seems to be inevitably at the helm, he should keep
a good look-out, go a-head a little, and steer the vessel in its right
course; but he is not justified in asking our sympathy for disasters
which, with a little spirit and tact, ºil very easily guard against.

THE LADIES AND THE POLICE.--THE BATTLE OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
--
-
Nobody doubts the courage of the Police; but tº: the
body is being every day severely tested at, the Great Exhibition.
Though they would never hesitate to “clear the kitchen”—includin
sometimes the safe—they find it almost impossible to clear the Crysta
Palace, when resisted by the powerful band of ladies who oppose the
civil power at the point of the parasol. In vain do the constables
attempt to forget the susceptibility of the man in the firmness of the
officer; in vain does the Committee issue orders which blue cloth and
oilskin might possibly execute, but which flesh and blood cannot carry

out. Who could stand inst a battery from the fire of the flashing
eyes of angry ladies; and what policeman would be bold enough to
meet the charge of a light female brigade by a counter-charge at the
station-house? -
If the regulations are really to be carried out for closing the Crystal
Palace at a given hour, the only course will be to swear in a number of
ladies as special constables, and throw #." them the execution of the
duty, which no man—with such irresistible force opposed to him—can
possibly perform.
PICTURES OF THE PEERS PAINTED BY THEMSELVES.
THE picture of the Peerage painted by EARL STANHOPE, at the
recent supplemental meeting in Long Acre, made up of the Agricultural
overflow from Drury Lane, is not very flattering. The noble Earl is
reported to have said that, “out of 211 peers who voted for the repeal
of the Corn Laws, only seven had done so conscientiously.” This off.
hand sketch of the House of Lords was greeted with “hisses, groans,
and cries of shame.” As, whatever little strength the Protectionists
may possibly have, is suffered to reside in the Upper House, the pros-
pect must rather gloomy when one of the chiefs of the party
denounces the Peerage as deficient in conscience, or courage, to stand
by their Protectionist principles. We confess we have a higher opinion
of the Peerage than EARL STANHope would have us entertain, and we
refuse, therefore, to join in the unfavourable ºnent which has been
passed upon them by a member of their own § y.
Professional Name.
Should there be . the readers of Punch a sausage-maker—
should that sausage-maker be blest with an infant son, and design to
bring him "; his father's business, and should the child be yet un-
christened, Punch will propose a name for him:—Polonius.
A (PRINTER's) DEVIL's WHISPER.
We have heard it whispered in 3. and literary circles, that the
speeches, jokes, and opinions of ColoneL SIBTHORP are about to be
collected, and published under the appropriately mysterious title of
SIBI-LINE leaves.
ICI ON NE DINE PAS.
LoRD PALMERStoN has given public warning that, since the salary of
the English Ambassador at Paris has been reduced £3000, -
“Englishmen, who go to Paris, must not t to receive from the MARQUIs of
Noam Arby that large extent of hospitality, which they had formerly received, almost
as a matter of right on their part, and of duty upon his.”
Now, we beg to say that we have been several times to Paris, and
that we never expected anything of the sort. At all events, whatever
we may have expected, we never received a single dinner as long as we
were in Paris, and that, accordingly, the MARQUIs of Norm ANBy failed
in his “duty” towards us... We wonder if we have any redress! Can
we send in to the Marquis a bill for all the dinners, which we were
obliged to pay for, and which, it appears, we had a “right” to have
for nothing at the English Ambassador's Hotel? It is lucky for the
Marquis that this fact was not better known before, or else his house
would have been a regular “Ordinary at 6” for all the Englishmen in
Paris. But we do not see how our Ambassador's influence was
heightened abroad by making him keep a table d'hôte for the benefit of
all his countrymen. However, we make formal complaint, that lo
notice was never given of this new branch of an Ambassador's duties.
Invitations should have been sent out to all fresh arrivals—advertise-
ments should have been inserted regularly in all the papers, and a carte
of the dinner, when possible, also given. by was not the outside of
his Palais inscribed with some large-lettered intimation of the cheering
fact, with some inscription like “ChEAP DINING-House For ENGLISH-
MEN ?” There has clearly been great neglect somewhere. If the
MARQUIs of NoHMANBy was given £10,000 a year to give dinners, how
is it that we never knew, until this moment, that a knife and fork were
laid for us every day at his table?

FINE CLAIMS FOR CONVENTS.
To the LADY TERESA ARUNDELL.
My DEAR LADY, -
You wrote a letter to the Times last week, very pathetically
deprecating something extremely dreadful, which, you appear to have
imagined, was meditated by Parliament, or certain persons therein,
against the inmates of nunneries. Your ladyship spoke of them as in
danger of “the grossest insults,” and alluded to certain “most un-
manly attempts now being made to deprive them of a security which
even the meanest women slaves have secured to them:” to persons
who “cruelly insult and calumniate them :” to “members” who
“treat with insult” your “sisters and daughters: and, altogether
your language almost indicates an apprehension that English nuns are
about to be treated like the nuns of Minsk.
Let me, my dear Lady, assure you that nothing is farther from our
intention—the intention of a Protestant Parliament, and lº and
Punch—than to offer any the slightest insult or indignity to those whose
imaginary cause you plead so eloquently. Nay, rather, it is to protect
them from indignity and insult, and worse, that we intend and desire,
Think you that we regard them with contempt or derision? What!
when one of the most famousines of our greatest modern poet is
“The holy time is quiet as a nun."
Earnest religious enthusiasm—even though we may believe it erro-
neous—is no laughing matter with us, good lady—albeit there is a mere
mania of mediaevalism, which Punch does laugh at, he must confess.
We do not deride-though we may pity—the Hindoo widow whose
“heroic” devotion renders her the heroine of Suttee. -
You talk of sisters and daughters. My lady, we have sisters and
hters as well as you. It is precisely on their account that we
would legislate on the subject of nunneries. Some of them, it is pos-
sible—we are not fearful on behalf of our boys—may be wrested from
us by those legions of your ecclesiastics who are compassing sea and
land to make one proselyte. We should like to know what becomes of
them in the eyent of their being induced- I venture to say
inveigled?—to “take the veil.” Do you, my dear lady, expect us to be
satisfied with the assurance that they are in the hands of a "Lady
Superior,” subject, perhaps, to the supervision of a so-called “Bishop”
of Clifton P
... If you do, it is, I was fºg to say, neither more nor less than expect-
ing us to believe in your Church. But it is more than that. It is
expecting us to believe in all and sundry Ladies Superior, and
Bishops of Clifton or anywhere else—holding their mitres of the POPE.
Was there never a bad Abbess—never an Episcopal rogue? I do not
wish to use vul hraseology in addressing any lady-especially one
of birth, and title; but really I must ask your ladyship-is not this
ºf it a little too strong?
And then, I am not inclined to dispute that the majority of nuns are,
as your ladyship calls them, “angelic;” that is, in their lives and affeº;
tions. But have there, never been any disorderly convents? Are all
societies of religious Roman Catholic females impeccable . Even if
I believed the Church of Rome to be infallible, would it follow that I
should be forced to put my trust in all and every one of its friars, nuns,
priests and prelates:
Not so, my dear lady. Among them, doubtless, there are many,
very many, good men and women. They include, also, Tº: charac-
ters. "And we have a right to be on our guard against those ominous.
eyed, shaven-faced, lantern-jawed, lean gentlemen, or gentlemen with
protuberant stomachs and large c.. equally ominous, who
perambulate our streets, in black long-clothes, scowling to the right
and left... And we are justified in endeavouring to guard our families
against the encroachments of monasticism; and to provide against
sible tyranny, cruelty, and immorality in establishments, which,
owever “angelic” for the most part, have been, in some instances,
, known to be the reverse. I hope your ladyship will take kindly—as it
- iimeant—and ponder discreetly, this humble remonstrance from your
yship's obedient servant, # 33842C+8,
No Accounting for Tastes.
QUR eye was caught by an advertisement in the Times of Wednesday
last, recommending a middle-aged person, “willing to superintend the
domestic concerns, where no cooking is required.” We gave an in-
voluntary shudder, at the bare idea of any family in which cooking is
dispensed with; for there is something revolting in the notion of a
domestic circle feeding upon raw meat, or other specimens of the raw
material. The middle-aged person who wishes to find a home where there
is no cooking, had better apply to the family of the Showman, we have
sometimes been disgusted at in continental fairs, where the lady of the
establishment dines upon alive fowl, feathers and all, or makes a luncheon
from some disgusting material hanging uncooked at the doorpost.
CHARACTER or AN HABITUAL Sot.—He was a man of no deter-
mination—except to the head.
OUR ASYLUM FOR HOUSELESS JOKES.
THE Great Exhibition has turned loose on the town so many unfor.
tunate puns, jokes, riddles, epigrams, and other members of the same
family, that immense numbers of them are now in the greatest state of
destitution, unable to find a reception in any of the periodicals, which
are in the habit of º: opening their columns to this vast and
increasing family of outcasts, about this time. Always a large and
tº: class, they were never so numerous and so wretched as
ls year.
They may be found wandering about the Park, in the neighbourhood
of the Crystal Palace, notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather;
and it is impossible to visit the Exposition without running the gauntlet
through troops of them; callous to shame, and attempting to excite
mirth by the most barefaced—we had almost said, indecent—perversions
of the QUEEN’s English.
Under these circumstances, feeling anxious that these, unhappy
disgraces of English society should be withdrawn from the observation
of foreigners, we have opened a “Central Asylum for Destitute Jokes,”
at which puns, and other plays-upon-words, however threadbare and
miserable, are taken in at all hours. It is impossible to describe the
wretched cases that have already applied for the shelter of our columns.
We take the liberty (in the hope of inducing their cruel parents to
reflect on the fate of the hapless offspring they are thus flinging reck-
lessly on the world) of subjoining a few of the most melancholy cases
which have availed themselves of the benefits of our Institution.
Case 1. (Called itself a Conundrum, and bore its abject poverty with
a sort of jauntiness that was peculiarly saddening.)
“Why is a dandy riding in Rotten Row, like a gallant admiral?
“Because he’s a Hyde Park-er.”
(This poor thing had tried every access to public compassion, and did
not apply at our asylum till it had been brutally turned away every-
where—even from the office of the Morning Herald.)
Case 2. (Belonging to the same family as the former.)
“Why is the Crystal Palace like a dog-fight P -
“Because it ought to be put down, as a paneful and disgusting
Exhibition.”
(This misguided riddle, which was picked up by a policeman on the
steps of the Morning Post Office, brought a letter of introduction from
Colonel SIBTHoRF, in which the gallant Colonel stated his intention of
bringing it before the House of Commons, as a case of unmerited ill-
treatment.)
Case 3. (Called itself an Epigram.) -
“BULWER to BULL.
“If BULL were BULwer, native industry he’d protect.
“BULL to BULWER.
“If BULweR BULL were, Protection he’d reject.”
(Surely wretchedness like this needs no comment.)
Case 4. (Applied for shelter under the obviously false name of “A
Witty *...", -
Lord John, breakfasting the 'other day at BRookes', was asked if
he would take some reindeer's tongue. “No, thank you,” was the
ready rejºinder; “I find Roebuck's tongue quite as much as I can
m .”
º: were obliged, at the unanimous request of the other inmates
of this same ward, to turn this miserable example of misdirected levity
into the streets immediately.)
Case 5. (This impostor presented itself for admission under the dis-
guise of a friendly j :-
&c. dear Punch, -
“Who is the biggest rogue in London?-Give it up?
“The Nave in the Crystal Palace.”
(We refrain, out of a feeling for the family, from giving the name of
the parent of this.)
We will not sadden our readers, or shame the ts of these
abortions, by proceeding further with our catalogue; "hiſ this meets
the eye of any thoughtless person, who has at times felt the temptation
to make a pun, we trust that this list may act, anyhow, as a warming
not to go and do likewise.
Cake and Ice Market.
CrystAL PALACE, May 8–To-day there was a lively demand for
ices and cakes. Ices (ranilla) to unsuspicious persons went off, without
a word, at a shilling each; of the more knowing, for the same articles,
momore than sixpence was demanded. Some young ladies bought slices
of cake readily at 3d.; whilst cautious dowagers had the like slices at
precisely one under. The sellers (young women with most
innocent eyes) looked up, naturally enough, as the market rose.

THE Income-Tax makes strange acquaintance. A night or
two since ColoneL, SIBTHQRP, advancing, upon the broad
ſº of the impost—called MR. HuME “his hon friend' "
ut it all comes of the Crystal Palace; though we do not
expect, that, the Colonel can concede as much. The streets
abound with touching instances of fraternal love. A day or
two since we witnessed an affecting example. There is a
negro, black as night, and woolly as wº, with a leopard
skin upon his shoulders, an ostrich plumed cap upon his head,
and bills of the Lion-hunter and Antelope-slaughterer, GoRD0s
CUMMING, in his hand. This negro stands near Hyde Park;
and this negro we saw affectionately embraced—yes, tenderly
clipped-by the arms of an old Jew clothesman. We moralised
upon this affecting incident, as is our wont in our daily walks
in moral-abounding London; and we set down that #.
accolade to the sweet influence of the time! We were touched,
we hope a little ennobled, by our contemplation: but it was
as nothing to the thrill we felt next morning, when, in the
columns of the Times, we saw the chivalrous Colonel SIB.
THORP. call the sagacious Joseph HUME “his honourable
friend.”...Verily, the millennium approaches, for the fox lies
down with the goose!
FAMILY PHYSIC FOR 1851.
THERE is not much-although there has been some-doubt
that the tendency of the Great Exhibition will be wholesome.
In particular it may be expected to have a highly salutary
influence upon young ladies, married or single. The wives
and daughters of England are unfortunately very averse to
using their legs, except for the purpose of executing Schot-
tisches, Polkas, and so forth; hence doctors’ bills of stu:
pendous amount... But as natural curiosity will take ladies all
round the Exhibition, and as they will not be able to ride in
flies or cabs, they will be forced to walk the whole distance.
The reward of this exertion will be bloom in the cheek, bril-
- liancy in the glance, warmth in the extremities, appetite for
N inner, and domestic happiness, by reason of a saving of many
r fees, effected by an economical investment in a few tickets.
THE REvoluTION or 1851–The Revolution in connection
with the Exhibition of Industry, anticipated by certain Yankees
and others, has been entirely confined to, the wheels of the
steam-engines and clock-work that are revolving in the Crystal
Palace.
THE CANDLE OF ROCHESTER CATHEDRAL.
AMONG other wonders of science and art, the Great Exhibition contains
various inventions for the production of intense artificial light. But
neither the oxyhydrogen light, nor the electric light, nor any source of
illumination under the sun-if, indeed, even that exception can
ustly made—is comparable for brilliancy to a luminous body which has
een recently exhibited in connection with Rochester Cathedral. This
truly burning and shining light is a Candle, formed by the Dean and
Chapter of the establishment in question.” It is, at the present
moment, the most .# Church Candle in England. Unlike
9ther ecclesiastical candles, which are Moulds, this one is a Dip. It
has been made by a gradual process of accretion, and is now some
fourteen times as fat as it was in the time of HENRY THE EIGHTH.
From that time to this the manufacturers have been continually dippin
their Candle into certain funds of unctuosity, originally intended to fee
not it, but some twenty poor scholars, on the foundation of the Cathedral
Grammar School.
For a very considerable time this Candle had been wasting its
radiance-burning unseen, as, perhaps, the sepulchral lamp of some
monkish wizard may be, even now, under the Crypts of Rochester
Cathedral. But, a year or two ago, the Rev. Robert Whiston, late
Head Master of the Grammar School, raised it out of its obscurity, and
set it upon an eminence in the shape of a work on Cathedral Trusts,
and their ... ; and, thanks to MR. WHISTON, it is now conspi.
cuously resplendent.
For this, act of officious attention, the Dean, and Chapter, whose
modesty, it seems, would have preferred still to hide their Candle,
rewarded MR. WHISTON by relieving him of the labours of his situation.
MR. WHISTON, declining to profit by—though fully appreciating—the
magnanimity, generosity, and Christian charity of the venerable and
i. #. particulars of its exhibition—in the Court of Queen's Bench—will be found in
the Times.
reverend gentlemen, obtained a mandamus, commanding them to re-
instate him. To this they pleaded that his appeal lay to the Bishop of
RochestER; and so it was decided by the Court of Queen's Bench.
To the Bishop, accordingly, MR. Whiston, will appeal, unless he adopt
the more promising course of applying to the winds, or engage in the
more hopeful occupation of whistling §. to a milestone.
The bulk to which the Rochester Candle has been worked up may
in some measure be estimated from the circumstance that the fat of one
of the canonries that go to its composition, the original value of which
was but £20 a year, is now worth £680 annually.
This enormous Candle was displayed in Court on the last day of
April... It is fortunate that its exhibition did not take place on the
day following, since so prodigious a monstrosity might have seriously
interfered with the attraction of the Royal opening of the World's Fair.
And certainly there is nothing in the Great Exposition to compare with
this stupendous production of clerical industry. The famous Derby
§.ºlt could not have supplied sufficient tallow for the Rochester
andle.
Viewed by their Candle, the Dean and Chapter of Rochester appear
in a pretty light, º as regards their conduct to MR: Whiston,
º shines quite like “a good deed in a naughty world.”—contem-
lated over the sinister shoulder. In what glorious refulgence we

F-
Important to Rogues.
THE famous thief-catcher, the DANIEL FoREstER of Vienna, by
name FELZENTHAL, has arrived in London to have a paternal eye upon
the doings of the naughty ones from Austria, at present, or to be, in
London. It is proposed, by certain inspectors, to invite HERR
FEI2ENTHAL to a banquet in the police-van, and to present him with
an honorary pair of silver hand-cuffs.

WHERE ARE THE FOREIGNERS P
HERE is a question we cannot
help asking,"Where are the
Foreigners?” We have looked
for them everywhere—in the
streets—in the theatres—even
in the Exhibition—but we
have not seen them yet.
Leicester Square contains, of
course, its usual complement,
though we do not know what
civilised country would take
it as a compliment, exactly, to
be given the birthplace of such
dirty, uncouth creatures as
take especial delight in herd-
ing in that continental neigh-
bourhood. But beyond Lei-
cester Square there is not
much to be seen in the
“foreigneering” department.
It is true there are two or three Chinese in the Chinese Collection, but you must pay a shil;
ling to see them. . It is indisputable that we saw a Turk in a Hansom's Cab, but we recognised
him as our old familiar friend the Rhubarb merchant of the Lowther Arcade. , He, and
HERR voN JoEL, and a Lascar at a crossing, are the only foreigners we have seen during the
last week. We cannot refrain from asking, therefore, ‘Where are they?” . .
If it were not for a feeling of shame, we should confess that we are º: We
had expected to have seen foreigners everywhere—foreigners in thousands. . We had expected
to have seen them with their gold-embroidered legs hanging over the sides of omnibuses:
We had made up our minds to have discovered rows of their turbaned, heads in the pits of all
our theatres—and to have admired their long, raven, greasy locks waltzing madly round and
round at all our dancing-places. The innumerable prints of the Exhibition had cherished this
fond expectation. They had represented groups of º: hob-nobbing, elbowing, all
“. as at a Mºº only looking much happier. There were foreigners in sledges
-foreigners on camels—and Chinese †. under parasols, big enough to keep the sun off
the largest apple-stall, These gorgeous visions have not yet been realised. ...We made sure of
being knocked over by a Laplander, or of seeing the traffic of the City interrupted by an
unwieldy elephant, who, from his enormous size, had stuck in the marrow aperture of Temple
Bar, and could neither advance nor retreat. -- ----
We thought, Regent Street would be made musical with the jingle of a million bells, and
that Hyde # would resound with the whips, and various jargons of bright-coloured postilions
from every Longjumeau in the world. As it is, London is nearly the same as at any other
season. There may be a beard, or, two more; there probably is an extra dozen pair of mous:
tachios about Town, though the latter have scarcely any right to count, as we have noticed
with pain, that the moustache is a foreign air, which Englishmen have º been assuming a
great deal—so that now it is nearly as much the type of the Blackguard, as formerly it was ex-
clusively of the Guard.
With the above slight difference, the streets, present about the same appearance as they
did last year. We suppose the foreigners wilſ come—and we hope they will; but if not,
we have the consolation of knowing that our countrymen are making themselves up to look
like foreigners more and more every day; so that we shall soon have the foreign and native
ntleman both combined in one. Decidedly a great saving, only we are doubtful whether the
Inglishman gains anything by it !
LIBERTY OF THE PENCIL–Taxation without representation is tyranny; therefore Punch
considers himself as asserting the liberty of a Briton when he caricatures the PREMIER and
the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER. .
THE GREATEST SCEPTRE IN THE
WORLD.
Not the least interesting of the products of
native industry, now in course of astonishing
mankind at large, in Hyde Park, are certain
specimens of a peculiarly national weapon, ex-
hibited, together with a variety of fire-arms, by
Messrs. PARKER, FIELD, AND SoNs. The objects
thus admiringly alluded to by Mr. Punch, are
three magnificent constables' staves, splendidly
emblazoned and illuminated. The sight of these
truly English contributions figuring in the
World's Fair, the reflection how much more
tent are such simple truncheons to maintain
ranquillity amongst us, than bayonets and
; are to keep the peace in foreign lands,
inspired Punch with thankfulness for the posses.
sion, by ourselves, of that “moral instinct of
deference to a policeman” which DR. NewMAN
sneers at, in apologising for the political state of
popish countries. As Punch gazed on these
#. of law and order, a glow of patriotic en-
thusiasm flushed his cheeks with such a colour,
that they looked like red apples; and a paroxysm
of the same sentiment, dilating his bosom, occa-
signed one of his waistcoat buttons to fly with
a loud pop.
THE BISHOP OF EXETER'S CHIEF.
.THE BISHOP OF EXETER is one of the most
distinguished officers of the Church Militant.
He has seen an immense deal of service—has
been repeatedly in action—indeed, is almost con-
tinually signalising himself in some action against
somebody or other. How strange it is, then,
that this gallant Bishop should not know to what
regiment he belongs He has lately published a
letter, which he styles “pastoral,” addressed to
the clergy of his diocese, in which he alludes to
“The Primate of all England, the second spiritual chief
of Christendom—alterius orbis Papa.”
So, according to Dr. PHILPotts, the ARch-
Bishop of CANTERBURY is only second in com-
mand in the Militant Church—merely the Lieu-
tenant-Colonel. The full Colonel is his Holi NEss
PIQ NoNo. Now, the Bishop of Exeter ought
to be informed that the Church of England does
not recognise the Commanding Officer acknow-
ledged by DR. PHILPoTTs. The valiant, Bishop
should be made to know under whose colours he
is fighting-namely, the Pope's—in order that
he may look to the proper quarter for his pay;
which, whilst manifestly in the Romish service,
he is most unaccountably receiving from England.
SPEAK UP!
THE Times of last Tuesday week contained the
following distressing paragraph:-
“ColoxEL SIBThomp said a few words, which were quite
inaudible in the gallery."
This is too bad of Our Colonel, especially as
he is in the habit of speaking (as actors would
say) to the gallery, considering the merriment
which his remarks generally produce in the
Westminster Ring. e hope, .therefore, that
Our Colonel will always “speak up.” We would
not miss a single word that falls from his lips.
There is but one SIBTHORP in the world, and
we should like to be his Boswell. Little has
been done this Session; but the above gap makes
a hiatus in our legislature which never can be
supplied. We condole with the nation on its
irreparable loss.
CORDEN on CookERY.
MR. Coppen shares in a very vulgar error.
He seeks to deprive our ambassadors of their
cooks. Does he think, with the vulgar, that
diplomacy has no bowels?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
209
NEWDEGATE ON NUNNERIES,
To the Editor of the “Tablet.”
VFR RATIONAL SIR,-Is not the ignorance
of Protestants with respect to those º
institutions, nunneries, most lamentable:
Take, for instance, the following passage
(replete with ferocious hatred of the
Catholic religion) in MR. NEW DEGATE's
speech on the debate of Wednesday
week:—
“Let them quote an instance of a coroner's
inquest in a convent. (Hear, hear.) Well, but
would Hon. Members deny there were, or might
be, sudden deaths in convents?”
My loyal, reasonable, constitutional Sir,
here, you see, we have an English gen-
tleman, a Member of Parliament, who
actually believes that nuns die! Nay, he
even conceives it possible that sudden
death may sometimes occur in convents:
as if death of any sort, sudden or lin-
gering, ever took place in those abodes
of sanctity. He talks as though he
imagined that the austerities of disci-
pline or penance could in some instances
shorten human existence, and furnish
ground for investigation. He evidently
does not know that all nuns depart this
life by translation; and that inquests do
not take place in nunneries, simply
because perverse Protestants are well aware that the verdict of every
coroner's jury would attest the miracle.
The same gentleman exhibits a remarkable instance of Protestant
hallucination. In allusion to an absurd rumour respecting a nun who,
it was pretended, had escaped from her convent, he said, that—
“Whether the lady returned, or left the convent altogether, he could not say; but
he knew that, within ten days from the escape, 15 cwt. of iron stanchions were placed
round the windows of the building; and that convent was now as complete a prison as
could be found in the kingdom.”
How curious it is that the moral and spiritual restraints of con-
ventual discipline should “inform” to the eyes of heresy as actual bars
and bolts of iron ] But we ought to pity J. Protestants for being
possessed with these delusions, rather than denounce and abuse them;
ought we not, moderate Sir? Greatly admiring the music of your
Church organ, which is so contributory to universal harmony, believe
me, gentle and pacific Sir, your occasional reader,
39&#C#.
ROCHEFOUCAULDIANA.
There is no sympathy in England so universally felt, so largely
expressed, as for a person who is likely to catch cold.
When a person loses his reputation, the very last place where he goes
to look for it is the place where he has lost it.
. No gift so fatal as that of singing. The principal question asked, upon
insuring a man's life, should be, “Do you sing a good song?”
Many of us are led by our vices, but a great many more of us follow
them without any leading at all.
To show how deceptive are appearances, more gentlemen are mistaken
for waiters, than waiters for gentlemen.
To a retired tradesman, there can be no greater convenience than that
of having a “short sight.” In truth, wealth rarely improves the vision.
Poverty, on the contrary, strengthensit. A man, when he is poor, is
able to discover objects at the greatest distance with the naked eye, which
he could not see, though standing close to his elbow when he was rich.
If you wish to set a room-full of silent people off talking, get some one
to sing a song.
The Bore is happy enough in boreing others, but is never so miserable
as when left alone, when there is no one but himself to bore.
The contradictions of this Life are wonderful. Many a man, who
hasn't the courage to say “no,” never misses taking a shower-bath every
morning of his life.
If you wish to borrow £5 ask for £10.

AMERICA IN CRYSTAL.
THE United States—in the Exhibition—are mainly represented by a
very full-grown eagle. Its exact measurement, from wing to wing, we
know not; but in stretch of Fº it assuredly licks º live specimen
the Britisher can produce. It is, however, unfortunate that the gigantic
bird soars over next to nothing. No eagle, asking of itself where it should
dine, and hovering in space without a visible mouthful, could represent
the grandeur of contemplative solitude better than is shown by the
United States’ Eagle in the firmament of MR. Paxton's Crystal. This
is the more to be lamented, inasmuch as a very little consideration
might have given us the American Eagle, with the treasures of America
gathered §: its hovering wings. y not have sent, some choice
specimens of slaves? We have the Greek Captive in dead stone—why
not the Virginian slave in living ebony? e the more regret this
shortcoming—since we read the Travels in America just done and
printed by LADY Wortley. Her Ladyship should have been the
chosen commissioner of the States; she makes of slavery such a ve
prettiness. Her Ladyship is invited to the slave estate—a sort of blac
Arcadia—the property of the late President's son. The dwellings were
“very nice,” many of them “ornamented with prints:” doubtless the
Declaration of Independence, with portraits of the patriots among
them. Her Ladyship was then shown the rising generation of slaves—
from slavery at the breast to slavery just running alone.
“Such a congregation of little, smiling, good-natured raven rolypolies, I never saw
collected together before. One perfect duck [why not blackbird?] of a child was only about
three weeks old, but it comported itself quite in as orderly a manner as the rest, as if it
had been used to give parties and assemblies, and receive any quantity of company from
every nation on earth all its days, or rather hours. It was as black, as a little image
carved in polished ebony, and as plump as a partridge (in mourning).”
LADY EMMELINE’s ornithological experience is even greater than
AUDUBON's. We doubt whether he ever saw a partridge in mourning;
though possibly such a phenomenon may take place throughout the
preserves of England—that is, when M. BRIGHT shall succeed in
demolishing the Game Laws. - ---
Here is a strange difference noted by her Ladyship; as different as
white and black:
“These pitchy-coloured piccaninnies differed from white children in one essential
particular, for they were all perfectly quiet and silent; all wide awake, but all still and
smiling.”
What says WoRDsworth to placid infancy?
“Thou liest in ABRAHAM's bosom all the year,
God being with thee when we know it not!”
It may be that MR, TAYLOR's baby chattels—his little raven roly-
polies and º little ducks—have in their babyhood sweet com-
munings with their future destiny, under the beneficent rule of slavery
—that rod, not of iron, but of blossoming almond—and thus, even
whilst wide awake, they are all still and smiling. The angels that,
unseen, walk the cotton grounds, may be whispering to the piccaninnies,
pitchy-coloured; and piccaninnies smile at the celestial intelligence,—
for what a life lies blooming before them!
“All the slaves were evidently taken the kindest care of on GENERAL TAYLoR's
plantation. Men, women, and children all appeared to adore MR. TAYLoR, who seemed
extremely kind to them, and affable with them.”
We must again deplore the omission that has failed to accredit LADY
EMMELINE, as commissioner for the Slave States of America. Her
Ladyship describes the condition of the “inky imps” and “little
darkies” with such animation—with such truly iºn. enjoyment—
that, under her superintendence, the American Eagle, that now flaps
over much vacancy, would have extended its wings over the most choice
assortment of American manufactures; displayed, too, with as much
taste for the World's Gathering—the darling rolypolies, and perfect
ducks, and partridges, in mourning—as though the show was a stall
at a Fancy Fair, held for the suppression of the Slave Trade.
However, let us make the most of the time remaining. As we cannot
have a black baby show, let America hire a black or two to stand in
manacles, as American manufacture, protected by the American Eagle.

210 PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WANDERER OF THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
THE Police of England, have eyes, that, like
the eyes of LYNCAUs, could, upon occasion, see
into the bowels of the earth, as if the earth
were no other than the inverted Crystal Palace
itself. Hence, it is in vain for ſº. would-be
mysterious man to present himself every day in
a new dress, and putting, to the best of his
means, a new face upon his novel wardrobe.
“Sir” said InspECTOR GOSHAWK to our
astonished selves within the Crystal Palace, the
while pointing his sinister fore-finger towards a
thin, gaunt man, dressed in an Armenian gown
with a beard of very venerable fall—“Sir,” said
GoshAwk, “the gentleman thinks we don't know
him. Bless you! we know him : but we respect
his weakness—poor gentleman!—and wink.”
* Weakness?” cried Punch. “Wink?” .
“Weakness,” repeated the Inspector, with,
we thought, a humane affection for the word.
“You see he’d almost made a vow—that is, the
Armenian there—never to come to the Crystal
Palace. He said his duty to his º: les, his
§. and his Income-Tax, wouldn't let him.
evertheless, he’s melted, Sir; he’s melted.”
We looked at GoshAwk for an explanation.
“This is now the tenth day he’s come—and
every day in a new dress—to see what’s to be
seen, and never to be known. One * we catch
him in Holland, like a burgomaster—the next in
Turkey, like a three-tailed bashaw—the next in
Greece, with a cap, and I think they call it a
capote—the next among the QUEEN, of SPAIN's
jewels, with a Don's sombrero—the next in
America, like a Pennsylvanian Quaker;-and so
he’s gone on, and I’ve no doubt, like the
Wandering Jew, will continue to go on, from
country to country, until he’s gone all over the
world of crystal, and always in another dress,
laying another, part, ... that people—for , the
aughter sake—shouldn’t know him. Look at
him, Sir! Doesn't he do it like life?” asked
Goshawk, pointing to the Armenian, at the
time gravely running his fingers through his
venerable beard.
“Ten men in one—always acting a new part!
Why”—we cried to the Inspector—“in the
name of mystery, who—who—who can it be?”
“This way, if you please,” and we followed
GoshAwk into the wastes of Russia; when,
looking carefully about him, bending his head,
and speaking in a whisper, Goshawk said—still
looking at the Armenian—“why, it’s the
Colonel !” -
“You don't mean—”
“I do. Colonel”—and then the Inspector
spelt the potent name º his fingers, thus:
“S—I—B—T–H–O Pl”
A Deplorable Omission.
A NEW Divertissement called Les Cosmopolites
has been produced at Her Majesty's Theatre.
It is said to contain Dances of all Nations—
but from beginning to end we looked most impa-
tiently for the British Hornpipe; and will it be
believed? no Hornpipe ever made its appear-
ance. In fact, there was no national Dance of
England at all! Now the Hornpipe—with the
exception of Sir Roger de Coverley—is about
the º'ſ national Dance we have; and in
beauty, lightness, manly vigour, grace, and ac-
tion, (how beautifully T. P. Cooke used to
dance it, to be sure, some years ago!) will
compete with the Dance of any other country.
It is a deplorable omission at Her Majesty's
Theatre, which HER MAJESTY, we are sure, would
be the first to deplore. We hope the British
Hornpipe will be restored to the proud position
it is in every step qualified to occupy, and will be
allowed on every other evening to take the lead
of the Dances of all Nations.
THE HIPPODROME.-A LAY OF KENSINGTON.
Ho, Band! strike up a Polka—your very loudest play;
The º at Kensington, opens its doors to-day.
To-day the vast interior is hung with banners all,
And o'er the money-taker's box flags deck the outer wall.
A. º§: oval has tingle }. the ears,
nd at the furtner opening a gay cortege appears;
Forth comes a stalwart #º. lead the cavalcade;
His mouth contains a trumpet—for look—not music made.
His dress belongs to HARRY's time—but we have seen before
Shoes of the same description on Thanet’s sandy shore.
Yes—there is no mistaking them—I'll to the truth be sworn,
A pair of Margate slippers are * the Herald worn.
And now the Band approaches, led by the tuneful, BLIGHT,
Who on the pleasant piccolo puffs morning, noon, and night.
Young EDWARDs of the ophycleide—who's never out of tune;
SNooks of the loud Trombone; SMITH of the mild bassoon;
Their costume speaks of many days—of Rome their tunics tell;
Their º: and their trousers of the street of Holy-Well;
Their collars of the Quadrant—or other parts of town;
Their jockey caps bring memories of Epsom's favoured Down.
But see what follows after them—a retinue, whose din
Bursts on the ear with tramp of hoofs and clattering of tin.
Their heads are cased in metal—such as the housewives use,
When in their saucepans they prepare their hashes and their stews.
The peaceful faces of the knights are martially disguised,
The saucepan metal making us think of calves' heads surprised.
Behold! a car advances—drawn by two prancing steeds–
Howyery much the vehicle springs to the º needs! -
Tis the EIGHTH HARRY holding on—with all his might and main,
To keep his equilibrium—but tries he now in vain.
Each rapid turning of the wheelſseems sent to make him own
How much a revolution might shake him on his throne.
But now within the centre great deeds are to be wrought-
On far-famed Field of Cloth of Gold the tourney must be fought.
Imagination, it is true, must in its flight be bold,
To fancy gravel, tan, and mould, a Field of Cloth of Gold."

THE WORLD NEARLY COME TO AN END.
Though we have long ceased to feel any alarm at the º of
the Thames being set on fire in these days, we were rendered rather
nervous about a week ago, by the announcement, that the world was in
danger of . consumed in one extensive conflagration. Fortunately
an energetic individual at the World's end was ready with a few buckets
of water to extinguish the flame that was nearly coming in contact with
the surface of the globe, and uniting Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,
with all the intervening oceans, in one tremendous bonfire. It appears that
the man employed as night watchman to the World, had become rather
mooney—a state of mind quite consistent with his occupation—and
being a little way from the World, he kept up such a fire, as to make
the place he sat in too hot to hold him. e are glad to hear that the
World is heavily insured in the Sun, as well as in the Globe, and that
MR. WYLD, the energetic proprietor of the World, will not suffer much
from the recent accident. -
Sunday Morning's Concerts.
A GEEAT deal has been said of late about the “histrionic * practices
prevalent in some of the Metropolitan Churches. There is one of these
more objectionable than all the rest—than any bowings, duckings, genu-
flexions, candle-burnings, masquerading in mediaeval vestments, or
other clerical monkey's tricks. It is that very histrionic custom—as
ursued at the Foundling Hospital Chapel—of taking, money at the
oors, as if the edifice were a theatre, and the juvenile choristers infant
phenomena.
THE PAPAL BRIGADIERS AND AUXILIARIES.
MR. REYNoLDs, in his speech on Thursday night, seems, if correctly
reported, rather to glory in the term Irish Brigade,” which has been
applied to his political corps., Our Brigadier and his companions in
arms will be delighted to hear that it is proposed to present them with
a stand of, colours emblazoned with the names of the various par-
liamentary battle-fields in which they have displayed their loyalty—to
their peculiar sovereign. The glorious name of THURLEs will also
adorn the standard of these ant fellows. As the most serviceable
division of the papal troops, they are, moreover, to be distinguished by
the title of the Pope's Own. -
number of crosses and beads will be distributed by his Holiness among

allies such valuable assistance in fighting the battles of Rome.
Wiseman at the Academy.
ON his recent election, MR, SERJEANT MURPHY mildly spoke of
Englishmen as “the brutal and excited rºl. of England.” And
nevertheless, up to the present time, the portrait of CARDINAL
WISEMAN hangs in the Royal Academy, no English brute of all the
millions having laid finger upon it: not because of its offence against
the Protestant mind, but against Art. The Pope perpetrated a wrong
when he sent the Cardinal here; but how much deeper the .#
when the painter sent the Cardinal to the Royal Academy! After all,
the Cardinal—like another individual—cannot be so bad as he’s painted.
It is likewise expected that a large |

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN CRAYON.
VERY one must regret that
ALDERMAN WILSON has played
the tyrant towards two poor
atriotic men, named JAMEs
RAY and JoHN ALLEN,
charged with the misdemea-
nour—or, in true phrase, the
noble endeavour–of attempt-
ing to save their country by
means of whitewash. The
gallant fellows were painting
on the parapet of Blackfriars-
Bridge, the Belshazzar words
—“Free Trade and Starva-
tion.” As the National Debt
crushes us with its score of
chalk, why should we not be
uplifted and made sweet and
# clean by the same material?
And, the wise, and beneyolent
* of Protection thinking
this, sends forth its mission-
aries—its midnight mission-
aries—to paint the awful syllables to sear men's eyeballs withall
“A gent”—[says GaAy]—“a gent as meets me every Saturday pays me twopence
for every painting º I have been at it a month; I tell the gent every time
how many I have painted, and where I have painted them.”
And the gent—before or, after verification of the number of “Free
Trades” and “Starvations,”—pays the painter. And GRAY it appeared
—and this is worthy of mark—paid his assistant, ALLEN, 2s. 6d. per
night. Now speaks the Alderman:—
“ALDERMAN WILson. What do you earn in your present profession?—GRAY.
Sometimes 1s. 6d., sometimes 2s. per night; and occasionally none, as I do not always
get paid.
“ALDERMAN Wrlson. If you get only 2s., how can you pay 2s. 6d. per night?–GRAY.
I don't know, your worship, but I do pay it. I am obliged to pay my assistants well
[laughter]. We do it in the night, because the children smear it in the day [laughter.]”
GRAY made answer with the real logic of Protection. He did not
know how he paid 2s. 6d. Qut of 2s. per night; but he did pay it. And
Protection does not know how it lives upon loss; but it does live. How
significant, too, the fact that compels the labour of Protectionist
painters by night, lest babes and sucklings—full of bread-and-butter—
should, in mockery of the fiction, smear it out ! The offenders were
thus sentenced :-
w ºALDERMAN WILson. Well, you must go and clean the bridge, or I will send yon
son.'
Fº were taken away accordingly by the constable to perform that duty, in return
for obtaining their discharge.”
Now, this is a little hard upon the humble workers in chalk, when the
painters in words and ink are suffered to paint at their own will. What
said MR. ALIson, at Edinburgh, in his late “FreeTrade and Starvation”
speech P Hear the historian:— r
“The average importation of foreign grain before 1846 was 2,500,000 quarters; but
attend to what has been the enormous, and unparalleled, and unforeseen, extension
of the importation since 1846—why, gentlemen, the average of the last two years has
been not less than 10,796,000 quarters. Now, so far from this danger and this evil
diminishing, it is rapidly increasing.”
PROTECTION
. There, miserable people! Since 1846, you have eaten more than
jº of quarters increase of food; and, you are consequently
starving : -
“A gent”—says the Protectionist workman in whitewash—“a gent
as meets me every º º: me twopence for every painting.”. We
ºre sory that the force of evidence ºpºl, us to put the question—
Is the “twopenny gent” MR. ALIson
A Lady's Reason for liking the Great Exhibition.
. “My Dear, it is so very agreeable. You cannot tell how amusing it
is!' It is much better far than goin . ". The whole place is
full of some of the prettiest things in the wo ºn es—silks—brocades
—and such lovely jewels—and the beauty is, you may look at them
ever so long, without being expected to buy a single thing!”
What's in the Wind P
THE free circulation of the Metropolis is greatly º by the
blocking up of some of the best and most airy thoroughfares with the
Monster Organs; and indeed if the organs should get as far as the
Park gates, we shall be having the very lungs of London affected by
the prevailing organic disease.
CATCH FoR THE GREAT EXIIIBITION.
TELL me, shepherds, tell me, have you seen
SIBTHORP pass this way ?
BALLAD FOR OLD-FASHIONED FARMERS,
ON THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
You may zay what you like to about the World's Fair,
But I’ve no inclination nor wish to goo there.
Your Palace of Crystial I don’t care to zee;
What good unto #. Warmer is it like for to be?
I hears a vast deal, and Is’pose I shall moor,
About that famous dimond the gurt Koh-i-Noor,
That's wuth nigh a million, as folks do relate;
But what’s that with wheat down below thirty-eight?
There’s minerals, and physic, and chymical drugs,
There’s tapestry, and floor-cloth, and carpets, and rugs,
And there’s porcelain and crockery, so fine and so grand;
Huº all that wun't affoord no relief to the land.
There’s wonderful statues, and fountains, and gates,
Upholstery, cutlery, fenders, and grates,
Kitchen-ranges and stoves for to fry, roast, and broil;
But there’s nothun to make the poor Warmer's potboil.
There’s gurt big steam-engines for fairings and toys,
Which I dare say amuses the Manchester boys;
But all the World's Fair no machine don't contain
As will sarve us to screw up the prices of grain.
Your silks and your satins, your trinkets and such,
French, Austrian, and Roossian, and Proossian, and Dutch,
Shows fine cultivaition of vorreners' taste,
When half of our soil here's a-running to waste.
How much better off be we likely to be
For your coloured glass windows and gold filligree?
Which is all superstition and Popery of Rome,
And Free Trade, which is a-ruining your countrymen at home.
Oh! gie me the Fair which the World's Fair beat brown—
The #. as was held nigh our own native town;
In the old turnpike-days afore railways was know’d,
Which have ruined every coachun-house by the zide of therhooad.
Oh! there was the beastices which the keeper did show;
The Lion from Africa, and Lioness also,
And the Lion's Provider, the little Jackal
Besides the Royal Tiger that come from Bengal.
And there was the Elephant, like a Christian, almost,
As well as the play with the murder and the ghost;
And the ram with six legs, and the learned pig to view,
And likewise the pig-faced lady, and the pretty cockatoo."
Then what wonderful hossmanship also was show'd
I remember BILLY BUTTON, to Brentford as rode;
And the fine tight-rope dancing that also we zin,
And the Merriment a-balancun of ladders on his chin.
Then there was the cheese-fair, and hoss-fair as well,
Accordin as you wanted to buy or to zell;
§. bill-hooks, and rip-hooks, and all Warmer's tools,
hen we was contented wi our vorevathers' rules.
Them wicked inventions for grindum the earth,
In the Great Exhibition, I’m sure be nought wurth;
Beyond the old plough no machine can avail,
Except and saving only a good slidun-scale.
At the World’s Fair, I’m told, there's a deal I should learn,
But that for my life ican't nohow discern ;
Zo I wun't go anigh it—no, I'd rather bide here,
A-smokun of my pipe and a-drinkun of my beer.
Don't do it Again.
WHENEveR a particular measure of indisputable justice is asked for
at the hands of Government, the demand is met by the simple answer,
“It’s imprácticable—it can't be done.” Such has been the º for the
last three or four years, to the general request, for an equitable adjust-
ment of the Income Tax. We have been told it “can’t be done,” but
unfortunately the public “can be done,” and have been done, notwith-
§: the impossibility of doing, that has been announced by the
inisters.
HA! HA! I AM NOT MAD.
Poor JoE HUME, complains, that whenever he has an important
motion on the books, he can never obtain a House, and that consequently
he can’t get on with his schemes No–Hows.

THE ANTIQUITY OF ELECTRO-BIOLOGY.
EoPLE talk of Electro-Biology as if it
were something new, as well as mar-
vellous; but this branch of experi-
mental philosophy is as old as the
earliest twig of the tree of knowledge.
The operation of the Electro-Biologist
consists in making his patient gaze
on a piece of coin held in the palm of
the hand. For ages, the effects of
fº. on coin have been well known
o everybody at all conversant with
human nature. It matters not in
whose hand, nor indeed in what
situation, the coin is placed—it may
be laid on a table, or dangled in a
- - purse—the result will be the same.
The influence of this process on susceptible subjects, who are very
numerous, is such, that they will not only believe, but swear, that
black is white, or, anything...else, the experimenter pleases. For
instance, they will declare, with all the seriousness of a solemn vote,
the most extraordinary individuals to be fit and proper persons to
represent them in Parliament. Certain recent disclosures in relation to
the St. Alban's election and Sovereign Alley, are singular examples of
Electro-Biology, or Electro (or Elective) Bribery and Corruption.
M. VATOUT’S DAY AT THE DERBY.
[We took these papers from the person of an unfortunate French Gentleman
of literary pursuits, whom we picked up dead-drunk, on the Derby
Day, and took home to his lodgings at the Hôtel de º
Leicester Street, Leicester Square. His French we have translated as
literally as we could; his English, which we give in inverted commas,
is untranslateable].
“HAVING proposed to myself the mission of studying the islanders
in their totality, in their streets, their “public-ouse,” their “combats of
box,’ in the aristocratic quarter of their St. James, and Leicester
Square, as in the sombre dens of their proletaries round the market of
Newport, and in the port of Wapping, in the cold and sullen silence
of their Sunday, their noisy acclamations over their tea at Greenwich
or the potations of their famous dinner of fish at Blackwall, you will
understand with what eagermess (empressement). I embraced the offer of
a young ‘lord’ of my friends, to assist, under his auspices, at the cele-
brated Course of Derby. -
“This Course of Derby is at once, the Chantilly and the Bois de
Boulogne, the Longchamps, and the Courtille of the English. It is
there the fair young miss displays her choicest toilette—from the
atélier of one of our Parisian millimers—there the young elegant of
the squares and casino, exhibits his º thoroughbred P.":
fringant), and often himself puts on the rainbow jacket, and cap of
velvet of the jockey, to compete for his ‘Ascot Cup,” or his ‘Grand
Stand.”. It is there, too, those colossal fortunes, wrung out of the
sweat of the ne Cuba, the agony of the Čaffre, and the pillage of
the Hindoo, on which the rich merchant of the city keeps up his ‘snug
box” at º pays for his Oporto wine at 80 francs the bottle,
and his turtle of the Docks—it is there that these fruits of the rapa-
city of English commerce, and the fraudulent dexterity of English
diplomacy, are risked on the skill of a ‘gentlemans riders,” or the vatici-
nation of a “Bell's Life Era” that Delphi of the turf of fondon, whose
PYTHONESs seeks inspiration from the ale of the tavern, and the fume
of the ‘livery-stables.” The young lord who served as my obliging guide,
was a desperate “sportmans’ (‘sportemans' acharné).
“Our rendezvous was formine o'clock at his apartment in Craven—one
of the black and tortuous streets which conduct from the roar of the
Strand to the silence and fog of the Thames. After the national break-
fast, of which the “naſt-naff,” in its pot of silver, and the bleeding
steak (biſteck, au naturel saignant), formed part, we lighted, our
Panatelas, and at the Circus of Regent Street mounted our carriage,
with its team (attelage) of four spirited horses, and its ‘coachmen,”
seated in his ‘boxing coat' of many capes, stern, proud, and cold; a
type of one of those “coachman,’ thoroughbred as his horses, who
would perish sooner than conduct a proletary, and allow himself to be
torn limb from limb, before his beloved ‘stages-coach,’ with its armorial
escutcheon, should be built into a barricade, in the sacred cause of that
democratic and social republic, which, though still far off on the distant
horizon of insular history, is destined to be the Ark of Noah of all
Nations. With the ‘young lords,’ and haughty ‘gentlemans’ by whom
I found myself environed, and to whom my Mentor did not even present
me—such is English politeness—I exchanged but few words. Their
conversation turned on one named ‘Walker, some companion, without
doubt, of their orgy, over a blazing punch, of the night before; and they
greeted their acquaintance, as they passed other aristocratic equipages
like our own, with that, loud and semi-musical cry of the English
hunter, War—fii–é-ti! War—ai—é—ti!” prolonged and vibrating,
like the Jödel of the Swiss mountaineer.
“It must be avowed that the manners of these young aristocrats were
more free from reserve (retenue) than those we have the habit of attributing
to the insular character. But the Derby Course is a Saturnalia for the
Englishman of the “uppers class.’ On that day it is not the Helot, but
|his Spartan Lord who gets drunk—and the Helot does not lose the
lesson of the exhibition!
| “The road is full of interest to the foreigner. The proletaries, pale,
sad, and silent, line the footways (trottoirs), cursing, no doubt, in their
Saxon hearts, the haughty
º
orman who rolls by in his magnificent
carriage,’ but restrained from violence by the stern presence and
terrible baton of the “policemans.” The country is a garden, green and
| laughing, and to-day the sun shines always. The road is here and there
|lined with boarding-schools (pensionnais)—and graceful blonde heads
(blondes tétes gracieuses), smile on the equipages as they roll by, and
receive with submission the loud and insolent badinage of the young
Lords—for these are but the daughters of the tradesmen (hourgeoisie).
The pale and haughty sisters of these young men are not there. They
are cloistered in the distant manor-house, under the rigid rule of a
severe aunt, or the tutelage of a mercenary governess (institutrice)
herself an enemy of the proud race to whom she sells her services, an
whom, in her turn, she delights to pervert and sour.
“As we approach the course the equipages are more and more
crowded—the ºil horses move more and more slowly—the
dust rises in thicker, clouds... We stop at every “public-ouse' now
—up to this time we stopped at one in two. The young lords are busy
with their ‘bet-sweeps,’ and their lotteries of the horses. They offer
me one. I have the ‘outsides.” I am laughed at, and ironically
complimented.
“We arrive after long hours of heated riding, and are greeted by
the proletary again, Ragged, with naked feet, brown with the sun,
breathless and h rd, #. runs by our carriage, and vainly implores
charity, offering his list of the race, his ‘Dorlincorrécarde. His misery
is derided, and we pass him, without an emotion of pity, without a
word of brotherhood; we are in our “carriage,’ he is in the dust–
Bespatter him (“claboussez-le) and pass on, young lords!
“And now we are on the course!
“What a scene!
“It is the green and smooth ‘turf,’ which gives its name to the
sports of the course, and which has been adopted also among ourselves
—us, who are so slow to adopt anything, save a great idea. Myriads
of the proletaries, are there, who have toiled hither on foot-panting—
breathless—and dirty—to forget their wretchedness for a moment, in
the maddening excitement of the race, and to enjoy a full meal, for once,
out of the scraps which, they will beg round the “lunch” of the lord.
And to-day they will not be spurned from his table. They will receive
s wine! Happy proletaries! -
“The crowd of aristocratic carriages like our own is dense. They
cover ‘the Hill.” With difficulty one penetrates the crowd. , But
misery, in its rags, with its wretched children on its back, in its hand,
at its heels, drags itself through the press, and rears its menacing front
and haggard eyes to the door of the coach, and struggles for the dis-
dainful alms of the blasé ‘gentlemans,” whose spleen is for a moment
diverted by the sight of real º: the languid “Miss, who would
pity, if her stern Mamma, and her impassive ‘Papa,” in his starched
stocks,’ were not there to chill the fraternity that ever struggles in the
heart of woman—though born in a palace, and reared in all the luxury
of the superfluous. But I diverge from my companions, from the race.
“Saddened by the utter forgetfulness around me of the tyranny
under which this land of England is groaning, I have left my noisy
companions and reached the outskirts of the crowd.
“Gare! I have received a thick baton between my legs! I see a crowd
of Bohemians—fierce—wild—noisy (criards)—armed with formidable
clubs—who shout and menace me! Do they seek my money?
“No-it is a game of the islanders. They are playing at their

BEARING in mind PRINCE
ALBERT's admonition to
critics, and feeling that
genius draws itself up like
a sensitive plant, at the
harsh touch of satire, we
are determined, this year,
to water our artistic May-
flowers, which blossom on
the waſis of the Academy,
with the milk of human
kindness, and not the
bitter water from the well
of Truth. Delightful task,
to find beauty everywhere
– even where common
observers can only find
ugliness – all the more
complete, from being re-
presented with the most
- scrupulous exactitude.
Our dear and promising young friends, the Pre-Raphaelites, deserve
especial commendation for the courage with which they have dared to
tell some most disagreeable truths on their canvasses of this #.
MR. Ruskin was quite right in º: up the cudgels against the Times
on this matter. ‘. pictures of the P. R. B. are true, and that’s
the worst of them. Nothing can be more wonderful than the truth
of Collins's representation of, the “Alisma Plantago,” except the
unattractiveness of the demure lady, whose botanical pursuits he has
recorded under the name of

Whether, by the passion-flower, he has put into her hand, he meant
to symbolise the passion with which MEssRs. LACEY, DRUMMOND, and
SpoonFR, are inspired against the conventual life, or the passion the
young lady is in with herself, at having shut up a heart and #. capable
of love and charity, and good works, and wifely and motherly affections
and duties, within that brick wall at her back—whether the flower
Fºgarded, and the book turned aside from, are meant to imply that the
life of nature is a better study than the legend of a saint, and that,
therefore, the nun makes a mistake when she shuts herself up in her
cloister, we are not sufficiently acquainted with MR. Collins's ways of
thinking to say. By the size of the lady's head he no doubt meant to
imply, her vast capacity of brains—while by the utter absence of form
and limb under the robe, he subtilely conveys that she has given up
all Hº of making a figure in the world.
MR. MILLAis' "Mariana in the moated Grange,” is obviously meant
to insinuate a delicate excuse for the gentleman who wouldn't come—
and to show the world the full import of Tennyson's description.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE PROTESTANT PREJUDICE.
ANDID AND DEAR S
“THAT deluded statesman
LoRD John Russell, has, f
perceive, been betraying the
most extraordinary hallucina-
tions respecting the state of the
Church in Italy. In the debate
on that barbarous measure of
sanguina persecution, the
Ecclesiastical Titles, Bill, his
Lordship is reported to have
given utterance to the frantic
and outrageous language sub-
joined:—
“For my own part, I have no wish
to exchange the religions liberty that
we shall all enjoy, and that the Roman
Catholics will enjoy after the passing
of this b for any of that kind of
religious liberty which is enjoyed at
ome. (Much cheering.). It was but
the other day we were fºrº by one
of our Ministers in º that there
was a person now lying in prison for
the offence—of what? Of cfrentating an Italian version of the Holy Scriptures (loud
cries of “hear, hear")—a violation of the laws of that Italian State.”
“The unfortunate PREMIER, of course, believes this statement—for
making which, the only punishment I can wish him is a course of
medical treatment, including cupping at the temples and blisters at the
nape of the neck. hy, Sir, all the most distinguished ecclesiastics of
Italy are members of a Bible Society, over which the Pope himself
presides, and which reckons among its members ministers of all
denominations, who are, invited indiscriminately, to those, interesting
tea-meetings which his Holis Ess so frequently holds at the Vatican.
The kind of religious liberty en º at Rome, which Lohd John sneers
at, is the freedom of Liberty, Hall itself: the most unlimited latitude of
theological discussion preyails; only it is not considered good taste to
moot controversial topics before children under ten years of age.
“His Lordship is also represented as having said—
“I am very glad that if I wish to learn the art of reasoning, I am not debarred from
WHATELEY's Logic.”
“I can only tell LoRD John Russell that at Rome he would be at
perfect liberty to confine his intellect, and enslave his soul with the
trammels of WHATELEy's, or anybody else's Logic. The sale of the
book is as unrestricted as that of arsenic was here, up to the other day.
The Inder Erpurgatorius is merely, a good-humoured review, the object
of which is to oppose heresy by the harmless weapons of humour and
raillery. Believe me to be, my very dear Sir, most truly yours,
“WERAx.”
A FEW DESPAIRING QUESTIONS,

of the Great Exhibition everywhere except in the Exhibition itself.

NAKED UNTRUTH.
“Coven your statues!” shouts CLARKE, the hermit, of Spring
Garden Terrace. e great ascetic would have VENUs, rising from a
sea of calico; and would endue DiANA with the longest riding-habit.
The too pure CLARKE is shocked by what he sees at the Exhibition.
There was a philosopher—a little more in earnest than CLARKE-who
ut out his eyes º he might not look upon temptations that way-laid
is soul. Has not CLARKE the same heroic alternative? CLARKE-(it
is the same Rochfort CLARKE who manſully smote the reputation of
Doctor Wise MAN's mother; and all, as CLARRE no doubt thought, in
vindication of his own Christian charity,)—CLARKE says:–
“Things are preserved because they are old or strange, or well executed, which are
only fit for the #. or to be broken in pieces. Let us, therefore, entreat others to speak
out plainly, decidedly, and promptly; and then, whether we succeed or fail in driving
the indecent and superstitious images out of the public thoroughfares of the Great
Exhibition, we shall at least make it plain that the Church of this kingdom does not
sanction the evil, but abhors it, protests against it, and actively resists it.”
CLARKE himself has purged his own portfolio of the nude mythology
of Paganism. ... More; he once upon a time gave two guineas for the
engraving of the “Murillo” in the National Gallery, and “tore it up at
a # meeting of ‘the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.’”
It was only the more emergetic spirit of former CLARKEs that “tore up.”
the bodies and limbs of offenders themselves. CLARKE of 1851 can only
give prints to “the devouring flame.” The happier CLARKEs of earlier
times º snuff the sacrifice of burning i. sweet-smelling in the
nostrils of the faithful and the pure. - -
We, of course, respect the motives of MR. CLARKE; we believe him
to be truly in earnest; and, so believing, recommend his opinions to the
serious, attention of Scotland-Yard; that CLARKE himself, and persons
of the like moral cast of countenance, may be known to the policemen on
duty at the Exhibition, at our National and other ºi
We hope that the authorities will be vigilant upon the motions of all
and sundry people of bilious, yellow-ochre complexions, with sunk and
sullen eyes, . wide mouths smirking at the corners, in worship of
their own excelling goodness. Such persons, are to be very narrowly
watched when near such abominations, as MURILLO's Holy Family,
and CoRREGGIo's Wenus and Mercury. For after all, CLARKE is more a
human matter of police than of moral argument. As soon turn PAN
into Apollo, as deprive a certain sort of delicate saint of his moral
horns, and hooves, his hircine nose and pricked-up ears. For these
moralities are of the satyr, and not of the god, within us.
There was one Schillier, who writing on Art, wrote—“All in man
that is not humanity, is contingent. The Grecian artist, who has to
represent a Laocoon, a Niobe, a Philoctetes, knows of no princess,
no king, and no king's son; he busies himself only with men. For
this reason, the wise sculptor throws aside the vestment, and shows us
only naked figures, although he knows very well that this does not
occur in actual life. He esteems clothing as something contingent, to
which the necessary need never be post†: and the laws of pro-
priety or need, are not the laws of art. The sculptor should, and will,
show us men, and garments only conceal them; he is right in throwing
them aside.”
Do we quote this for the benefit of the genus CIApkE * No ; for we
know it incurable; and would as soon borrow Apollo's lyre—if we
could—to “call the cows home.” No: CLARKE and such dismal enthu-
siasts are, we repeat it, a matter of police. We therefore pray A. l to
keep his eye on our national “Correggios,” and exhort B. 2 warily to
watch our “Poussins” and “Murillos.”. Can we be too vigilant against
the rampant decency of a sect that, in its ablierrence of haked purity,
no doubt prefers as more outwardly respectable, an ADAM thrust from
Eden, to the mere ADAM as he walked in Paradise 7

It is a great pity that by cutting out a ride in Kensington Gardens,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE CHARLES THE SECOND BALL.
Ince the announcement of the Cos-
tume l, a good deal of excite-
rent, has been prevalent about the
Court regarding it. It is known
that CHARLEs THE Second used
to feed ducks in St. James's Park,
and it is thought that this amuse:
ment of the Merry Monarch is
harmless, and may be . on.
the present festive occasion. Re-
wards have been offered at the Lord
Chamberlain's ce, for a means of
keeping the ducks awake till twelve
o'clock at night.
We hear that some Duchesses de-
cline altogether to assume the cha-
racters of their namesakes in the time
of CHARLEs THE Second; and that
the Dukes, their husbands, perfectly
agree in this spirited decision.
or the same reason as their
Graces', the parts of Maids of
Honour are not in much request.
But for the character of CATHERINE
HYDE, who married the heir to the
throne, there are numberless pro-
posals among the young ladies of the
polite world.
For the character of the DUKE
of Bucking HAM (of CHARLEs THE
SEcoR p’s time), who kicked down a
grand fortune, without being able to
account for it, we hear a great
number of noblemen named; among others, Lord ADDLEstone,
LoRD MUDDEHEAD, and the Lord Wiscount WILDGoose.
The young gentlemen about Downing Street are reading the Bio-
raphie Universelle, and acquiring a surprising fund of historical know-
edge. , Young TAPELY, old TAPELY's son, who is eighteen, and has just
entered the Foreign Office, proposes to appear as Colbert: whom
GUTTLETON admires, not as a minister, but as inventor of Colbert-soles.
VANDER SOUCHEY, of the Dutch Legation, announced at the Club that
he would go as the PENsionARY DE WITT. “Behold de miracle instead
of de witt,” said FLICFLAc; and added, that Count NARcissi (the
envoy from Pumpernickel) had best assume this character, because the
women are always tearing him to pieces.
GENERAL The EARL of SLowgo (who does his best to be an F.M.)
has just been credibly informed that a work exists—a remarkable work
—although a light work he may almost say a biographical work—relative
to the times of CHARLEs THE SEconD, called PEpys' Diary, and pur-
W. to be edited by a member of their Lordships' House, the LoRD
Iscount BRAYBROOK.
GENERAL Slowgo has, therefore, presented his compliments to Lord
Wiscount BRAYBRook, and requests to know if the Wiscount has edited
the work in question ? Should his lordship's reply be in the affirma-
tive, GENERAL Lord SLowgo will write to the Librarian of the British
Museum, to know: 1st. Whether the work, entitled, PEPys' Memoirs be
in the ilibrary of the British Museum? 2nd. Whether that work contains
an authentic account of the reign of his late Majesty, King CHARLEs
The SEcox Dº 3rd. Whether the Librarian of the British Museum can
bring the volume, if a rare one, to Slowgo House? and, 4th, If not,
whether, and at what time, GENERAL THE EARL of SLowgo can consult
the work in question at the British Museum ?
The two little Miss BUDDs (who go about with LADY CRABB) have
had another contemporary work lent to them by their cousin Rowley,
and are busy reading GRAMMONT's Memoirs. When LADY CRABB
heard that her wards were reading history, she was highly pleased, and
observed that she has no doubt the volume is instructive, as the family
of GRAMMONT is one of the highest in France. The Miss BUDDs say
the book is—very instructive.
Miss GRIGG, who is exceedingly curious in books and antiquarianism,
has come upon some surprising illustrative passages in her Papa's
library, in the works of Wych ERLEY and §. . SEDLEY, and in
SUCKLING's poems.
Colonel Sir Nigel M*Asser, who has the largest and blackest
whiskers not only in the Horse Guards Green, but (with the exception
of one sapper, now at the Cape of Good Hope) in the British army,
when he heard that whiskers were not worn in the time of Charles
THE SEcono, and that gentlemen would be expected to shave, instantly
applied for leave of absence; and, if that is refused, he will send in his
rs.
£º, Rosa Twentyston E and her daughters have been to
Hampton Court, and taken careful note of the LELYs there. But
when they came down to dinner in the dresses which they had prepared,
*...* *Tº sº \!

and rehearsed the part before MR. Twentystone, he ordered the
i. family up to their rooms, and the dinner to be covered, until
they were.
“LADY Rosa is so delightful,” WARGEs says, that he thinks “one
can't see too much of her.”
LoRD Wiscount METhuselah has put himself into the hands of
new artists, and will appear with the cheeks, hair, and teeth of twenty.
He has selected the character of LoRD RochestER, and has sent a
request to the Lord Chamberlain that he may be allowed to make his
entree into the ball through a window and up a rope-ladder.
LoRD HulkingtoN hopes to be able to get into a º dress, which
he wore once in private theatricals, at the PRINCEssor WALEs’s Court at
Naples in 1814; and the lºdies ºf his family are busy (for his lordship,
. he came into his fortune, is become very economical) in trying to
enlarge it.
LADY HowLRURy experts, tº hake a great sensation, and not at a
large expense; having attired herself and daughters, each in a curtain
of the state bed at Ivybush, under which CHARLEs.The Second passed
three days after the battle of Worcester.
If the Lord MAYok is invited with his suite, the City Marshal, of
course, will go as MARSHALTUREEN.
LoRD ToM NodDINGtoN was much surprised when he heard that
CHARLEs the Secon D had been up a tree; and always thought that he
ran for the Oaks. His opinion was that CHARLEs the Second had had
his head cut off, just before his son, JAMES THE FIRST, came into this
country, from Scotland,-where Lord ToM goes shooting every year.
MR. BLAND WARGEs, who is the most notorious wag at SPRATT's, said,
that as Tom NoddingtoN had no head himself, he had better go as the
MARQUIs of MonTRose—after his decapitalion. Tom Noon!NgtoN
said he would be hanged if he went as MontBose, which WARGEs
said was more and more in character. Lord for said he didn't know.
He knew that he had shot the Duke's country, and hoped to shoot
there again; and he thought “it was devilish dangerous, begad, in those
confounded levelling times, by Jove, for fellas to go about, saying that
other fellas had their heads cut off; and that sort of thing begai, might
put bad ideas into other fellas' heads, and radical fellaº, and dam
republican fellas.” MR. WARGEs said that LoRD Tom needn't be aſ raid
about his head, and that if he lost it he wouldn't miss it; on which
Tom NoDDY said that WARGEs was always chaffing him.
LoRD ADDLESTONE–when his librarian informed him he had heard that
Louis THE Fourteenth as a young man wore a periwig powdered with
fold-dust—has hit upon a brilliant thought of his own, and ordered that
is wig shall not only be powdered with gold, but that he will have a
papillote of bank-notes. - -
... If these are scarce, as his steward informs him, his Lordship's man
is directed to use promissory notes bearing his. Lordship's valuable
Signature.
The young officers of the Eclectic Regiments, horse and foot, Cornets
and Lieutenant-Captains with ten shillings per diem of pay, are greatly
fººd at the idea of having to pay £40 a piece for their wigs at the
It is said that a venerable Prelate of a Western Diocese is going to
represent all the seven recusant Bishops of JAMEs's time at once; and
CARDINAL DE RETz, who had a genius for conspiracies, fights, rows,
and hot water in general, has a representative in Golden Square, with
a hat and costume ready bought and paid for.
Ensign AND LIEUTENANT Tipton, of the Coolstreams, says that he
intends to take MARLRoRough's part as a young man, for he is very
good-looking, is as poor as a rat, and ready to borrow money of any
woman who will lend it.
“List: Oh, List!"
THE Police-Commissioners issued a list of London Cab-fares, which
have since been recalled, as they were full of errors. . It is very curious,
but a cab-fare seems to be a question which cannot be handled without
committing some mistake. The poor Public is doomed, apparently, to
be deceived on every side. As if the Cabmen were not enough in a
conscience to impose upon them, the Police must also lend their aid .
to mystification and extortion. Between the Cabmen and the Police:
men, a person will no sooner enter a cab, than he will think himself
extremely well out of it upon payment of double fare. However, some
little indulgence should be shown to the poor Cabmen, supposing they are
proved to have committed any slight overcharge, when the very persons
who are appointed their judges commit themselves. We see .
a cab-fare is eternally destined to be one of those disagreeable subjects
upon which no two persons will ever be found to approach within a
mile—or more, if there is a back-fare in question—of the same opinion.
AMERICAN AMENDMENT.
THE Americans have improved upon the old English saying of “Base
is the Slave who pays;” for their strongest expression of horror is,
“Base is the Slave who doesn't pay.”

“My DEAR JANET,
“THE deluge of shillings having burst upon the Crystal Palace,
Inow have a moment's breath to tell you all about it. For the first
time—Sundays, of course, excepted—since the wonderful 1st of May,
I am again in my own little room, that was once such a dear of a
boudoir, but is now become as melancholy as a dungeon, and as cold as
an ice-house. CHARLEssays, it is all º my living so long among the
carpets of Persia, the veils of Turkey, and the *f and embroidery of
Cachemire—and there may be something in it; for ever since the 1st of
May, I've driven directly after early breakfast to the Palace of that
º Jin, Paxton, in Hyde Park, where for hours I’ve done nothing
ut think myself a great Princess of the Arabian Nights, with the
Koh-i-moor my own property, whenever Iliked to wear it.
“You may therefore judge, my own. JANET, what it was to come
home every evening to Baker Street; with CHARLEs—I will say it—in
the worst of tempers, and wickedly wishing the Crystal Palace given up
to Col. SIBTHoRP to blow into millions of shivers. However, knowin
that the mob would be let in like a torrent on the 26th, I was º:
to have the last minute out of my season-ticket, which Charles,
when, he bought for me—as he has since had the ill-nature to
say-little, thought “would have the effect of making me forget my
own fireside, my own husband, and my own family.” As if, when the
24th was over, I shouldn't forget the Arabian Right. the Persian
carpets, the Turkish veils, and be as dull as ever. But even these
sights-even these wonders, amongst which thousands of us ladies
walked and sat, and sat and walked, like Queens on their coronation-day
-all this was next to nothing to the delightful pleasure of attendin
PRINCE ALBERT wherever he went, swarming about him—as an ol
gentleman observed—like bees about a furze bush.
“You must know, º dear, that the Queen and the PRINCE are the
earliest of risers; therefore, you may guess—no, you can't, living in the
wild wilderness you live in-but you might, if you knew somethin
more of London-life—you might, I say, guess what it was to be up an
out and in the Glass Palace by a little past nine every morning, to be
ready for the QUEEN and the PRINce; that they mightn't stir a foot
without your following 'em. Well, as luck would have it, one morning
his Royal Highness came alone. I confess it; I have felt a little put
back—somewhat abashed by the mild, reproving glances of the Queen:
but for His Royal Highness PRInce ALBERT-it was plain from the
moment he entered, that he had not the heart to look coldly upon

condescension! - - - -
“In a word, my dear, we never left him. Living where you live,
ou have heard a good deal of the excitement—the wild pleasure—of
unting stags; of deer-stalking. Bless you, JANET, it can be nothing
to the delight of hunting a Prince; and hunting him so close, that you
may have, for the rest of your life, every look and line of the royal
countenance for ever impressed upon your loyal and devoted heart. I
am sure, for my part—never, never can I forget the expression of His
Royº. Highness Prince Aiment, on the – of May, in the Glass
Exhibition. But how should I? when I was all but a hair's-breadth
upon his royal toes, the crowd of ladies so pushing one another, that,
upon my word, my love, I thought for a minute, of the Christmas
gallery of a playhouse—it was more like it than the élite-for there
were many of our locale present—of Baker Street. But then the
Prince was so affable—so kind! And though, perhaps-I say, º
—His Royal Highness would have liked to be left a little to himself,
studying the commerce and things of allnations,—still he neverse much

best of breeding—for I am sure it must have taken the royal mind a
little trouble to do so. ---
“You will laugh, my dear, when I tell you that we positively followed
His Royal Highness from one end of the world to another. When he
dropped in upon the East Indies, there we were at Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras, and Singapore. When he made a move towards China, to
China we followed him! When he made for Switzerland, with His

shudder for the consequences. Is it not as if Cinderella's glass-slipper
was to be tried by the horridgiant that wore seven-leagued boots? The
Saturdays still remain for us; but, after the mob, will they-can they

THE BRITISH BROOM GIRLS.
oubtless it is not generally
known that there is a large
class of useful servants of the
public, the “Street Orderlies,”
whose services are not only not
remunerated, but are even ren-
dered at a considerable expense
to themselves: as the apparatus
which they use for sweeping
the streets is not supplied either
by the parish, or º: Commis-
sioners of Sewers, or any public
association for promoting the
office of scavenger. Indeed, their
utility had been altogether un-
acknowledged till MR. Paxton,
the other day, speaking, at the
banquet given to the foreign
Commissioners at Richmond, of the unexpected cleanliness of the
Crystal Palace floor, said that
“As a policeman had remarked to him, the building had been kept completely clean
by the rich silk dresses of the ladies.”
MR. Paxton had devised some contrivances expressly for sweeping
out his Palace; but these have been rendered superfluous by the ladies'
trains; which, in fact, are everywhere superseding besoms. Of course,
it is in consequence of the length of her garments that the fair
pedestrian, in perambulating our thoroughfares, interferes with the
operations of the regular dustman. He, indeed, may complain that
long dresses, in gathering up the dust, take the bread out of his mouth;
but the public is the gainer by this admirable fashion, so well calculated

to make the pavement look tidy, and hide a chaussure of which the
appearance would be different. Thus to veil from observation a very
important point in beauty, indicates a considerate feeling on the part
of our CINDERELLAs towards those of their sisters to whom Nature
with respect to foot and ancle, has been less bountiful in form, and
more so in size, than to themselves. It must, however, be confessed
that so studious a concealment does not so much evince goût as suggest
goutiness; a state of lower extremity which might, be imagined to
as frequent now among young ladies in the West, as it used to be
among old gentlemen from the East. But then it is pleasing to
contemplate the indifference to admiration, and the sacrifice of feelings
of vanity to practical usefulness, exemplified in this truly sweeping
reform of Fashion. Punch, nevertheless, would suggest a little econo-
mical improvement in the make of trailing gowns. Botanicaldecorations
of various kinds are common embellishments of feminine costume.
Let the hems of ladies’ long dresses be trimmed with broom.
A DRAMATIC APPEAL AND SUGGESTION.
To MR. Mitch ELL (of the French Plays), favoured by MR, PUNCH.
7~ ERTAINLY, Sir, when I
say that I am an English
dramatist of an industri:
ous turn of pen, you will
readily understand that
I have re-bottled a good
deal of French wine into
English vessels, flavour-
ing with brandy, &c., to
suit the English market.
However, to drop meta-
*: as vulgar and slow
am a dramatist; and
by at least a dozen en-
thusiastic worshippers,
who meet at the Dumas'
Head, am considered to
be the man destined to
redeem the English
Theatre—with all its
seediness and slowness
—to the spiciness and
vigour of the French
stage. With this view,
I have produced plays
that have been in their
turn ‘A Tremendous
Hit”—“Am Unparalleled
Blow *—“A ever-to-
be-Equalled Sensation,’ and so forth. Only two or three weeks ago.I
brought out The Amiable Cannibal-in which a Siberian spendthrift
devours three of his creditors to hurried music—with an alarming
effect, a tremendous blow, Sir, at the legitimate drama...The º:
after, the statue of SHAKEspeaRE over Drury Lane portico was foun
cracked through and through; and I am proud to believe will never
be mended. But to ". immediate purpose.
“You have read of the daw in peacock's feathers. In confidence, I
am a repetition of the condition of that very bird; and for this, Sir,
I may thank, or rather abuse, you. All my dramas have been put forth,
with not a word of their origin: and my friends have thought me a
man of wonderful fertility of invention. Yes, Sir, I have been consi.
dered and worshipped (as such happy beings are worshipped in England)
as author—dramatic author.
“And now comes your deuced French company to play in their
original French all my English productions. One by one my plays
are taken from me. One by one my peacock plumes drop from my
tail; and if your confounded company remain long with us, I shall soon
not have a single feather to strut with. But this comes of your
infamous Free Trade! This comes of admitting French º: free of
duty, like French shoes—to the destruction of the English dramatist
and the British shoemaker.
“However, quitting a consideration of my own wrongs, let me—at
this genial season of universal philanthropy—suggest a mode by which
the true English dramatist may yet benefit his species and put a trifle
in his pocket. At St. James's you are now playing Une Bataille de
ames; and at the Olympic the same piece is turned inside out as The
Ladies' Battle. Now, as our French visitors—ninety-nine out of a
hundred—know scarcely a word of English, and as all Frenchmen
know French º as they appear, why not turn the English Theatre
into an English school for the foreigner?
“For instance, let every line of Une Bataille de Dames be—line byline
—uttered by a French prompter, bestowed in the middle of the stage,
as at the Opera—each line being translated by the actor into sound,
literal, English. Thus the Olympic Theatre would be a very useful
school; and, for once, English actors would be really teachers. I do
not expect that M. REGNIER himself can be translated-I mean his
genius—but we might have all his words; and thus Frenchmen visit
the play-house for instruction, getting as much amusement as-as they
could. Any way, the reproduction of a modern French play ought to
have a great attraction for the mind of the Gaul. He leaves it in the
be |Palais Royal, and he finds it in Wych Street. This must excite in him
endearing associations of his country; just as if inviting a Frenchman
to the Clarendon to dinner, he was to have, warmed up, the very rol-au-
vent he had left half-eaten at the Trois Frères. The dish would stillsmack
of home, and that, too, very pungently. His patriotism would be
flattered by that stale rol-au-cent at the English hotel, as it must be
delighted at the English theatre.
“Sir, I have thrown out a suggestion that, if acted upon, may be
some small compensation to one ºf the many victims of Free Trade, and

“Then, too, anew Reform Bill was talked of; but he warned the Government that the

shoulders.”
The Duke of Bºbroad swept”—the QUEEN’s crown “swept”—

NOTES AND QUERIES
Connected with a late Magisterial Decision.
CAPTAIN PAULETT SoMERSET has been receiving, during his imprison-
ment in the Coldbath Prison, numerous visits. In fact, he may be said
to have held a levee every day. The Observer informs us, that at one
time six carriages were waiting outside the prison-door. All these
carriages, more or less coronetted, had brought sympathisers to the
incarcerated Captain.
Upon the strength of the above note, which has not been contradicted,
we beg leave to put the following queries:—
Whether the same indulgence would have been shown to any other
prisoner—suppose we say, BILL SYKEs P
Whether BILL SYKEs would have been allowed to receive visitors in
the same way as the Captain?
Whether the visitors of BILL Sykes, no matter whether they came in
cabs, or in donkey carts, or on foot, would have been ºwith the
same courtesy, and admitted within the gates with the same sympathetic
attention, as the titled visitors of the Captain?
..Whether they would not, have been sent away altogether, or else
directed to call on some particular day at some particular hour:
By whose, orders were these indulgences shown to CAPTAIN
SOMERSET, which, it is perfectly fair to presume, would never have been
ranted to BILL Sykes–unless BILL SYKEs had happened to have an
§. or an Aunt connected with the aristocracy?
And lastly, by whom were the orders signed to admit the visitors?
Here our queries end. We are sure ºft. orders were not signed by
MR. HARDwicke. He, whose conduct had been so jº, impartial in
the first instance, would never have been guilty of an act of such gross
partiality in the second. We will at once acquit him of any such
weakness. But the orders must have been signed by some magistrate.
We must say, then, that the magistrate in question had no right to
interfere with the sentence of another magistrate—and by the granting
of certain favours to weaken the force of that sentence.
We think that BILL SYKEs, and all the other inmates of the prison
have a just cause of complaint, and that he and they should be allowed
to receive visitors and sympathisers in any numbers, and at all nours,
until further orders.
Pre-Raffaellite Taste.
THE Pre-Raffaellite Brethren may be said to have come out at the
Academy this year very strong-as a glass of grog is strong—that is,
stiff. But these gentlemen really do paint hay and fº. wonderfully
well. There is something quite remarkablé, if not characteristic, i
their taste for fodder and pasturage, and doubtless they º *

THE FLOWER FOR THE FARMER.
AMONG the multitude of fine, things at the Exposition, Messrs.
BALLANTINE and ADAM exhibit the stained glass window, executed in
the Elizabethan style, of the entrance-hall of Glenmoriston. In noticing
this contribution to the industry of an industrious world, the Times
remarks—
“This seat is held directly from the Crown, on the condition that the proprietor,
when required, shall present the Sovereign with a Red Rose on the festival of St. John.”
To the political economist and reflective poet, this equally advan-
equs and sentimental tenure of an estate naturally suggests emotions
which find inadequate expression in the subjoined

But our Grand Fair's magnetic might
Draws all mankind together.
Hysteric patients, mesmerised,

Among the higher classes,
Yield to the conjuror's control
With absolute submission;
But all the nation gives its soul

Their properties mirific !
Have been explored by little boys,
And chemists scientific.

But, to the Crystal Palace, these
Must one and all knock under.
Around the Sun each planet whirls,

Andall the other saints of Thurles,

But on an orbit wholly new
This world henceforth will enter,
And sages will in Hyde Park view

THE SUREST ABOLITION OF WAR.
We have a grand notion for the total abo-
lition of war, which we freely make a present
of to all Peace Societies. Letthempropagate
it far and wide, and act upon it, as much as
they can. It is well known that a Free-
masonis forbiddenby his oathto injure, much
less to slay, a brother mason. Cases have
been known of soldiers being saved on the
field of battle from certain death, by their
making, at the critical moment, the masonic
sign. Our motion, therefore, is to send
aceful agitators amongst the army, to
induce the soldiers to become Freemasons.
Every soldier gained over to the good cause
would be enlisted in the grand army of
peace; and when every English soldier had
sworn to obey the benevolent laws of Free-
masonry, then let our peaceful agitators
º annel, and begin in France what
the º ready, achieved, so successfully

dest º ly—which no government, however
Whig or Tory, could scarcely be guilty of
—to send an army of Freemasons against an
army of Freemasons. It would be curious
to notice a regiment of English being
ordered to fire on a regiment of French,
and suddenly dropping their muskets as
they saw the latter make the mysterious
sign of Freemasonry. We prophecy that,
with two armies, composed of such brotherly
materials, not a limb would be hurt, not a
single lite would be lost.

to increase the difficulties of reference, is about six times thesize. Seek

by the afternoon equestrians. If there were no better plea for
aristocracy than that set up by LORD SEYMoUR on behalf of the
horseback aristocracy in Hyde Park, we should begin to tremble for
the peerage. The flippancy of Lord SEYMoUR, at the expense of what
he was pleased to call “the aristocracy of Bayswater,” is not precisely
suited to the present times; for these are not days when the wives,

respectable middle-classes of society.
THE LAMENT OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.
ALAsl for popularity—it is a fleeting flower,
That buds and blossoms, and decays almost within an hour;
'Tis scarce a year ago that I was brought across the brine,
To have a thousand worshippers bow daily at my shrine.
To catch an early sight of me how fast the crowd would run,
To see me sporting in my bath, or basking in the sun;
Or in the gentle arms of sleep beneath a summer sky |
No in'ant Hippopotamus was happier than I.
They used to give me pails of milk—all genuine and true,
But now among its tilts I trace a skyish sort of blue:
They used to come in carriages, and cabs and omnibuses,
To see the Hippopotamus of lippopotamuses.
No longer do the Visitors to my abode repair;
In vain. I take a sportive bath, or snuff the evening air:
To meet each other at my home no longer they appoint—
The Hippopotamus is hipp'd-his nose is cut of joint.
Qh, where are all my worshippers—why am I left alone?
'Tis that a baby Elephant now occupies my throne.
The Hippopotamus complaint, or mania, dies away;
Elephantiasis becomes the fever of the day.
But let the clumsy infant its triumph now enjoy;
The brute must º: its babyhood, and cease to be a toy.
Qh, then, farewell for ever, its glories and its charms'
It can’t remain eternally an Elephant in arms.
'Tis then the Hippopotamus will reassume its sway,
Growing in |. ularity, as well as size, each day.
Glories will light upon our race—the public will allot 'em us;
Then, hip ! hip! hip! hip ! hip! hurrah! hip ! hip! for the Hippo-
potamus !
children, or even the nursemaids, of the Notting Hill patricians—the tº:
little Lord shall have his yery little joke—are to be deprived of their
play-ground or their walks, at the will of any other aristocracy who |’
might find it convenient to run the risk of riding rough-shod over them.
The idea of the Hyde Park Ride being a sight that any one cares
about, except the snobs who go to see, and the mobs who go to be seen,
is a remnant of effete flunkeydom. If there are some persons who cannot
exist without the odour of aristocracy, and aristocratic horse-flesh, there
is BATTY's Hippodrome at the service of both parties. There may be
a few poor, creatures still remaining, who would be content to be
smothered in dust kicked up by the horse of a Lord, and who would
luxuriate in the chance of being run over by an aristocratic equipage;
but the number is now, we think, so small, that the locality we have
named would accommodate the whole of them. At all events we
recommend LORD SEYMoUR, when he is again interrogated on any
similar subject, to avoid his ill-bred sneers at suburban aristocracy
particularly when, as in this case, he is obliged to allege the “ royal
pleasure” as the only warrant for the step he has taken. It certainly
would not be the wish of royalty to have its “pleasure", urged as a
reason for interfering with the harmless recreation of the middle classes,
more especially when those classes are, at the same time, held up to
ridicule º: an ill-mannered Lord—by courtesy—as the aristocracy of
Bayswater. If Lord SEYMOUR wishes to make aristocracy ridiculous,
he need not go out of his way to impute it to the untitled inhabitants
of the neighbourhood of Kensington Gardens. There is quite enough
matter for sneering and sarcasm among the “order” as it stands.
NOT A DIFFICULT THING TO FORETELL,
“LET THE Poor Gipsy TELL Your ForTune, MY PRETTY GENTLEMAN.”
Jonatham's un-Brotherly Love.
THE New York Herald wrote some time ago an alarmist article on the
subject of England; and the same respectable authority now tells us
that we were so terrified at the picture of the state of our country, that
London was at once convulsed. There is some truth in this, however;
for London was convulsed in reality, on reading the predictions of the
New York Herald; but it was with convulsions of laughter, from which
we have as yet scarcely recovered.

SKETCH or A * Lord of the CREATION”
on His RETURN FROM THE DERby.
LIBELS BY THE BUSHEL.
MR. HENRY (the Magistrate of Bow
Street) has lately, been advancing, a new
truth, so perfectly astounding , that we
doubt if he will get any one to believe it.
He remarked, that
“The Medical Students of London were the most
disorderly class with whom the Police and the Magis-
trates had to deal.”
This cannot be the case; at least, not
a police case. We always imagined that
there was no better-conducted class of
ersons in the Metropolis than the Medical
§. We learn now, for the first time,
with the greatest surprise, that they are
ever taken before a Magistrate. In our
simplicity, we thought that they were so
uiet, so well-behaved at all public places,
that a Police Office was the very last place
where they were likely to figure in. -
HENRY must be labouring under a ºf:
He is probably confounding the Medical
Students with the youthful visitors, in this
merry month of May, to Exeter Hall—two
very different classes of persons. However,
we hope, that the Medical Students will not
ow the above imputation to hang over
them. We trust they will immediately hold
a public meeting, and spare no amount of
money, noise, and beer, in restoring their
characters to the high standard of spotless,
unsuspected purity popularly claimed, for
Caesar’s wife and London Milk. A Medical
Student should be not only pure, but above
suspicion. -
(Oh, cruel RICHARD MAYNE, &c.
THE FEAST OF THE HUMMING-BIRDS.
CERTAIN insects are coloured by their food; taking the various tints of
the various seasons. Looking upon MR; Gould's hundreds of Hum-
ming-Birds—but now flashed upon the public at the Zoological Gardens
—we are almost made to believe that the winged wonders have fed
upon emerald, º: diamond, topaz; all the precious jewels of the
earth. These birds are the most marvellous development of natural
brilliancy, and natural beauty; the most wonderful embodiment of the
things of fairy-land! We would as soon attempt to give the colours of
a rainbow with º ink, as hope to give the faintest notion of the
feast of beauty that awaits the eyes—yes, and the hearts of the beholders
of these wonderful creatures. So magnificent—so graceful—so strange,
and yet so harmonious in their thousand gradations of form and colour.
The Hippopotamus—whose London life seems to haye given it a
more knowing look; a better sense of the influence of society than
when we first saw it—the Hippopotamus is a marvel; the Baby
Elephant—so grave in its infancy, showing a seriousness far in advance
of its teeth—the suckling Elephant is a marvel;-but the marvels of
marvels are MR. Goulb's Humming-Birds.
And with what a º beneficence do they come to cheer, and—we
should hope—to satisfy the lady world for the loss of the glories of the
Crystal Palace | There is one Humming-Bird—the only known specimen
caught on the top of Chimborazo—that we can confidently produce as
a worthy rival to the Mountain-of-Light. ONE *—There are hundreds
of Koh-i-noors in feathers.
WExATA QUAESTIo.—“Now, Cabbie, what’s your fare?”
EVERY LADY HER OWN HOUSEMAID.
.WE have it on the authority of MR. PAxton—who obtained the fact
direct from an observant policeman—that the Crystal Palace gets
thoroughly..". every day by the long dresses of the ladies. R.
PAxton had invented “a machine of a ń. housemaid power” to
remove the dust #. the Exhibition; but the instrument is not required,
for the ladies are the great dust contractors, who may be said to remove
all the dust and dirt from the building by special train. We dare say
there is considerable elegance in a dress that sweeps the floor, but we
always thought the fashion involved much folly and extravagance, and
we now discover that it embraces a vast amount of dirt. The ladies
may well hide their º when we recollect the state of their stockings.
Perhaps there may be some economy, as far as the keep of servants is
concerned; for it seems that every lady of the long robe is, to a certain
extent, her own housemaid, and takes away upon her dress and her
legs, all the dust and rubbish, wherever she goes.

THE FARL of GLENGALL presented a petition, the other day, to the

(AFTER CHAUCER.)
T O R O NM E.
WHANNE that ye firste of º breedeth jokes
On boys and girles and simple full-grown folkes,
To seken out what they mote never finde, -
Legs from the lame, and eyesighte from the blinde—
Whan that conceit our clerkeseke and our cittes
º hath, out of their shallow wittes;
And chaunting curates maken melodie
Whereof nought understanden you or I-
So Oxford tractes prike them in their corages,
Then longen folks to go on Pilgrimages;
And unwashed º from many a foreign lande
Men may beholden walkinge in the Sirande,
And clerkes, and squiers, and younge ladyeseke,
They wenden forth the Churche of Rome to seke.
Methought that in that seson, on a daie,
In Fleet Streete at mine office as Ilaye,
Of Pilgrimes I beheld a compagnie
That on their viage unto Rome wente bye;
And Iwold tellen, as it seemed me,
What sort they weren, and of what degree,
And eke in what arraie that they were inne,—
And at a Lord than will I firste beginne.
32c_3Lºrū.—A Lord there was—and that a worthy man—
That, fro the time his college life beganne,
Was wont to talken of the good olde times, ,
And thereof wrote he and eke publish’d rhymes.
Him seemed it a sin that poure elves
Should thinken or should reden for themselves.
He wolde that the people should be goode,
Nortroublen them neither for faithe nor fºode:
For faithe, sith Holy Churche should stille their qualmés,
For foode, sith Lordès shoulden give them almés.
At Rome he was when Holy Week begonne;
After St. JANUARIUs wolde he ronne
To see his bloode melt-and it did him paine
That chemists woºde the miracle explaine.
At the Pope's feet eke wolde he louten low
To kissen of the Holy Father's toe.
His Hall, I wot, was sely Pugin’s glory,
For therein had he made an Oratorie,
With saintes the ugliest that mote be seene;
Poundes it coste two thousande and fifteene.
In briefe, his thought was by his life to prove
How that the worlde no businesse hath to move,
So to its motion he did shutte his eyes:
Yet was he worthy, though he was not wise,
And of his port as meke as is a maide;
He never yet no villainie y-sayde, -
Save of the lettere that Loºp John did write.
He was a very perfect, gentle wighte.
#2c ºutre.—With him there rode his friend—a batchelere,
An Exquisite, and a Young Englandere.
Within St. Stephen's had he showed his strengthe;
His speeches were much talked of-for their lengthe.
Of ballades he was author, two or three,
In Annuals, and eke in Manuscrit,
In Saintes praise; but his look seemed meet
Lesse for St. JAMEs than for St. James his Street.
Sweet-scented were the lockes on his head;
His tie was full of floweres, white and red;
Lounging he was or flirting all the daie;
Unto the Derbie rode he every Maie.
Well could he talke of fasting and penaunce
To maides, between the figures of the daunce;
And from the hollow world within the cloistre
Threatento shut himself, as in an oystre.
Whereat the gentle ladyes wolde flush,
And with a tender sighe wolde bid him hush:
Courteous he was—at parties serviceable:
And out-of church spent much time in the stable.
32e fºlatº. -A maiden was there, eke, of high degree,
After St. Bennet's rule, of Belgravie.
One that to be a nunne did much incline;
Fullwell she sange the service divine;
Entonédin her little nose, as sweete
As don º Highland bagpipes in ye streete;"
She coulde symbols work in Berlin wool, .
And missals paint of sharp-toed saintes fall;
And fain would she have fasted, but 'tis saide,
Fasting will maken maidens' noses red.
A favorite curate had she, that she wolde.
Sendjelly to, when he had taken colde,
And broider slippers for him eke, with rowes
Of crosses patiné upon ye toes;
And often, after Almacke's, down ye staires’
Came she at nine next morn for early prayeres,
And fain wolde have confessed her, as I guesse,
But that she knewe of no sinne to confesse.
She thought of saintes, so holy and unclean,
And pined for a hair-shirte in crinoline;

And at her glasse, betwixte black veile and white,
Wolde ponder which made her looke least a frighte;
And oft a nunnerie she thought aboute,
But firste resolved to see ye season oute.
#2t Oſtic ſhattle.—Another damosel I did beholde,
That was a maide—some eighté sesons olde-
That wolde the worlde renounce—nor did she err-
For that ye worlde hadde done ye same by her.
%2c 33isbupr.—A Bishope was there eke, a cholericke man,
To †. down heresye with booke and ban;
And heresye full shorte defined he,
“Heresye is the differing from me.”
Unto the texte he wolde not lend his eares,
That sayeth, “Blessed are ye peace-makeres,”
Or claimed himself that blessing, with increase, .
“Because,” quoth he, “I make knaves hold their peace.”
Obedience unto Bishops he wolde preche,
But to resist Archbishops still did teache;
And, eke, he was a prosecutor tight, +
For if one of his parsons dared to write
Qr preche against his will—for Churche's glory,
He clapped him straightway into Consistorie.
In quibbling, and in splitting of a hair,
Was all his luste—and costes he wolde not spare. ,
3.2c CIrrfic of 9penfurtle.—A Clerke there was of Oxenforde, also,
That shoulde have been at Rome long time ago;
Well coulde he logike choppe, and fairly make
The worstè cause the beste, for Churche's sake.
And he had gotten him a benefice,
And, though an Anglican, he was not nice,
To lead his flocke righte cunningly from home
Until he hadde them folded safe in Rome.
He recked more of bowed back and bended knee,
Than of an uprighte life and honestie;
Of altars sette with candles, and such showes,
Than of the light a pure ensample, throwes.
And § menne that did with him scolaie
He thoughte, it dutiful to lead astraie;
Sounding in hollow reasons was his speche,
And well coulde he pervert, and well misteche.
??c Curatc.—With him there rode a Curate, fresshe and faire,
In coate full long, and smoothely-parted haire;
At the West End, there, in a faire chapelle,
From curates rounde aboute he bore the belle.
With ladies olde and younge he was the rage,
Both for his fastinge and his fayre language.
He was a stoute ecclesiologist,
And had his chancelle sette oute, as him list,
With altar, and sedilia, and cross,
Piscina, roode-lofte, awmrie, and rere-dos.
He sette much store by bowinges Weste and Easte,
And kneelinges of ye people and ye prieste;
For prieste he did # clepe, and held it taunte
To be styled Clergyman and Protestaunte. . . . .
Fine were his handes, and fayre white was his skin,
As was the surplice he wold prechen in;
Upon ye slie heard he confession
Trom yonge women, that wolde flop them downe,
And poure their little sinnes into his eare,
That the poore Curate mote not help but heare.
Though he saide nay, a sainte they made him still,
And canonized their Curate, 'gainst his wille.
So with a humble looke, and a proude hearte,
This sely Curate he did ride ... -
Y-wrapped in the gowne of selfe-conceite.
32c #crgraunt of me 3Lamc.—A Sergeaunt of ye Lawe next mote
you meet,
That on black-letter bookès long had fedde;
Councils and cases in his rustie heade
So jostled them, that plaine truthe had no roome
For canonists and casuists to come.
Well coulde he quote the rubricks through and through;
No ceremonie quaint, or practice newe, , .
But in ye auncient Church, he made it plaine,
Place it hadde once, ergo may have again.
And when ye Bishopes raged, then furnished he
Authorities againste authoritie;
Hollow-eyed was he, lene as is a rake,
And of a calfskin was his gowne y-make.
32c Hºumagrrr.—A daintie Dowagere was in ye route;
Moche in ye worlde had she been knocked aboute.
And, after trying pleasures every one,
Of late had taken to devocion;
And well it liked her—for that it was newe.
Plump was her face, and fayre, and red of hue;
Nice dinners made she for poor Curates meeke,
To whom she wont of bye-gone sinnes to speake;
Upon an ambling pad rode she to Rome,
For ye indulgence she me founde at home.
£r Limmerc and ºr 3rdjitette.—They hadden with them eke
a young Limnere,
An Architecte, besides, that was his frere,
To whom their arte advance did seeme to lacke;
For why? Because that it wolde not goe backe. |
To be original, they did upholde, |
Artistes mote do what artistes did of olde.
This one made churches, wherein that did painte
Many a stiff-necked nunne, and long-toed sainte,
So rude and harshe, men mote sweare they did see
Ye thirteenthe, in ye nineteenthe centurie;
And o'er such werkès each did praise ye other,
And Architecte o'er Limnere made much pother,
And Limnere in his turn o'er Architecte:
Humbuggès were they both, I sore suspecte.
To Rome they rode, so they informed me,
For childe-like Faithe, and early Pietie.
%2c Caruimal.c.—Their leader was a stout carl, for the nones;
Full bigge he was of brawn and eke of bones;
A jº. had he, and redde were his hose;
A pastoral entuned he through his nose,
That from ye Vatican had lately come;
And therewithal he lcdde this route to Rome.

age, would exhibit him-
self before the world as
the champion of intole-
rance—the promoter of
persecution worthy of
the blackest . of
the darkest ages? (Hear,
hear, and great cheering
from the Irish Members).
No term in the vocabu-
ary of invective could
adequately express the contempt and detestation which all right-minded
men must feeſ for such a disgrace to his species....The mildest epithet
he could apply to such a man would be incompatible with his respect
for the dignity of that House. (Loud cheers from the Irish Members.)
Now, what would be thought of the intolerant bigotry which could
have dictated such a passage in a document—now public property
—(Hear, hear, and laughter)—as that which, with the permission of the
House, he would proceed to read?" The Hon. Member then, amid pro-
found silence, read as follows:–
“HER MAJESTY and her Royal Government shall dispense her powerful protection
and support the prelates when called upon, principally when it is necessary to oppose
malignant men who attempt to pervert the minds of the faithful, and corrupt their
manners; or when the publication, introduction, or circulation of bad and hurtful
books is to be prevented.”

CONVERSATIONS IN CHINESE.
We never knew the difficulty of
talking in Chinese till the
other º We thought we
were rather expert in read:
ing the lids of tea-chests, and
the inscriptions on CAPTAIN
PIDDING's five shilling pack-
§ ages; but when we came to
† converse, with the Chinese
lady, at the Chinese Collec-
|tion, we found, to our morti-
fication, that she could not
understand a word we said.
We have been deceived by
Howqua, or sold by PID-
DING, ºr else our own vanity
has made an April Fool of us; for when we paid FI-F1-0-You-NAu-Ti-
Sing (that is the name her Chinese godfather and godmothers gave her)
what we considered to be the prettiest compliment in Chinese, she
only laughed, and showed us her foot... We did not speak another word
of Chinese the whole day, except to observe “So-so" to some passing
remark the Mandarin made. ..
This Mandarin speaks English; but as we could not understand him
any more than the º: understood us, we infer that the English they
teach in China is no more English than the Chinese which our tea-
chests profess to teach here is Chinese. Having presented him with
a specimen of our
English tea-plant,
we returned to F1-
I.
She smiled, and
showing us her foot
again, invited us to
sit down by her
side. We soon dis-
covered that this
act of showing her
foot was the highest
favour she could
bestow upon any
one. She is very
proud of it, and, -
considering it a mighty treasure, only displays, it to a favoured
few. We think she is very right, for certainly there is not another
foot like it in all England. CINDERELLA’s slipper would be a police-
man's boot for it. It is so small—so unlike the usual shape of a
foot—that it comes like a kick to one’s imagmation when first told that
that circular piece of wood and leather has a lady's foot inside. It is
more like the foot belonging to the leg of an old table than anything
else. It is positively not as long as a teaspoon—and we are speaking
au pied de la lettre. How she balances herself upright upon such a
mere tobacco-pipe of a º is a marvel of equilibration. As it is,
she walks—or rather waddles-for about six yards, and then sits down.
You follow her with fear, holding your hands out lest she should fall.
Resting-places are dotted all over the Exhibition, to enable her to sit
after a tremendous journey of seven yards. She attempted to run; and
really it was as ridiculous as a German eilwagen attempting a trot.
But she would sing. So, taking up a mandoline (which is very much
like a banjo), she sang us a song, which seemed compounded of the noise
that cats make, and the sound of the hurdy-gurdy. It was most
mewsical, most melancholy. It was a love song. If ever we fall
desperately in love with a Chinese lady, we only hope she will sing
to us, for the very first mote be sufficient to cure us of our folly.

The lover who could still love after a Chinese love song must be an
ardent lover indeed! All love songs are dreary enough; but those of
China are certainly entitled to the first prize of dreariness. . There is a
fine, knife-grinding tone about them that cuts one to the quick.
Fi-Fi is attended by a Chinese waiting-maid, not dressed, like our
waiting-maids, in silks and ribbons, but all in black. She is not so
pretty as her mistress—for what waiting-maid ever was? But then
she has the great charm of not singing love songs. -
Fi-Fi has also two little cousins, as brilliant as butterflies. They are
both related to the Sum, or the Moon, or the Great Bear; and in proof
of their celestial descent, one of them carries a grou of flags on his
}. ºila: to those carried by the Boulevard vendors of oryeat and
2/10/faſte.
FI-FI was beginning to sing again. We turned quickly to the door
when the Chinese Beauty, to chain us to the spot, artfully displayed
her little foot. Even this temptation did not succeed. We hurried
recipitately out of the place, and, an Italian organ happening to be in
Fi blow outside the entrance, we listened with calm delight, and
thought it the finest music in the world.
TWO EXHIBITIONS IN ONE.
It is said that the Great Exhibition takes away all the attraction of
Parliament, though we scarcely knew that Parliament, at any time
ossessed much attraction. It is said that the public will not attend
Yoth to Parliament and to the Exhibition together, and the Times
kindly recommends the former to shut up shop at once, and not take
down its shutters again till 1852. We think there is no necessity for
this, and we should be sorry to lose Parliament as long as SIBTHoRP,
DRUMMond, REYNoLDs, and one or two others, are in it. We propose,
therefore, that the two Exhibitions be combined in one. Let the
sittings of Parliament be held for the future inside the Crystal Palace.
It would add materially to the interest of that great glass case of
| curiosities, and would be in perfect keeping with the building, especially
as the Irish Members are at present making such exhibitions of them-
selves. An appropriate space might be found for their deliberations
amongst the department of Raw Materials. By this arrangement
the one Exhibition will not clash with the other, and both will be
benefited. The only question is, whether the Building is strong
enough to stand the thunders of MR. GRATTAN's eloquence?
Why, my Lords, Do ye mot march Forward in Order?
... We believe that the tune to which the MARQUIs of WestMINster.
is in the habit of practising the celebrated crab step, is a March of
Back... We never in our lives saw anything that gave us such a perfect
idea of the very opposite to the March of Intellect.

THE MORALS OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION.
HE poet asks,
“Is there any moral shut
Within the bosom of the rose?”
and finds that there are so
many, that, to fix on any one
is to cramp the use of that
which is used to point it. So
it is with the Exhibition of
the Industry of all Nations.
All sorts of morals grow out
of it, or are tacked on to it.
You overhear them in the
Crystal Palace; you pick them
up in the Park; they obtrude
themselves upon you in lead-
ing articles; they oust the
weather in casual street-en-
counters; they beguile the
pauses of a quadrille, and set
conversation :* in the
railway-carriage. We present
a sample to the readers of
Punch, who will be good
enough to select those they
like best. All are genuine,
and the only fault we have to
find with them is, that they
cut each other's throats.
The Protectionist's Moral.-
Oh!—a pretty benefit to the
country to flood us with
goods, ruin the home-market, and take all the gold out of the country! However,
forei
it will open people's eyes to the humbug of Free Trade. - -
The Free #. jºi"A wonderful sight: Illustrates admirably the inter-dependence
of nation and nation, and proves, to demonstration, that the principles of Free Trade are
those of nature and common sense. - - -
The British Manufacturer's Moral.—By Jove, we must look sharp–or these foreigners will
* .
be cutting us out!
The Foreign ditto ditto:— *, *, * . . .

SEASON TICKET AND FIVE SHILLING MORALS.
The Dandy's.-What a deyvilish pleasant lounge!
The Débutante's-You know one meets everybody! -
Mamma's-Well-educated girls appear to such advantage; and my girls are so well educated!
The “Very Remarkable ###".jove? How deuced little one knows, after all!
Sir Charles Coldstream's—A lot of things one doesn't understand, and a host of people one's
;
l After all, these Englishmen have some notions of their
own, beyond machinery and penknives!
| tired to death of meeting.
MARITAL MORALS.
The Husband's:-Avoid the India Shawl and Lace Departments.
The Wife's.-Get the men to take you to see the stupid machinery, and you may get them
among those sweet shawls, and those loves of laces !
SHILLING MORALS.
The Artisan's.-I wonder how they’d get on without us?—Or we without them, for
that matter. -
The Democrat's-Well, there’s something in that chap, PRINCE ALBERT, after all!
The Communist's.-What a grab, if it wasn't for the Policement -
The Red Republican's-Confound these English They don't seem at all ripe for revolt!
The Observer's.-Upon my word, One Shilling seems to make a better use of his time than Five!
MR. PUNch’s MORAL.
That the different nations of the world, and the different classes of society, might meet
oftener, with much advantage to each other.
A BIT OF A TEASER.
WE have, for some seasons past, been accustomed to “dancing teas,” and other fooleries, in
what is called fashionable life; but we have just been introduced to something new under the
title of an International. Thé, which seems to us the climax of stupid absurdity. , Why,
unhappily for us, every Thé, or TEA-let’s use the plain English word-is international, being
a mixture, of the British sloe, the American broom, the rich metropolitan loamy dust, and a
slight addition of the real leaf from China. This is the true international tea, that is being
perpetually consumed by all classes in this country, and, therefore, the assumption of the
name is a piece of superfluous nonsense, which it is our duty to demolish. The same
individual announces a second international Thé for another evening. We trust in the mean
time, she will find some more sensible name for her spread, and we would suggest that a
“sloe affair” would not be inappropriate.
THE DEAD LION AND THE LIVE
PROTECTIONISTS.
MEssRs. Spoon ER, NewDEGATE, G. F. YoUNG,
and others of the species, went, down last week
to Tamworth with bran-new shoes upon their
feet, to eat their thistles in contempt of free oats
and to lift up their voices—prick their ears, and
“yerk their armed heels” at the memory of the
deadlion, SIR RoBERT. ...The party were refused
the hospitality of the King's Arms—it may be
that the landlord foresaw the coming storm; it
may be that he thought gratefully of the doings
of SIR Robert—and so they betook themselves,
says the Daily News, to “a small inn or spirit
vaults.” Any way the party dined in the town
of Tamworth.
There was boldness in this; and boldness we
must admire; for why, in the matter of protec-
tion—which is “high rents” in one word—wh
should we expect or desire in public men a deli-
cacy that would be ridiculous with wheat at its
present price; a sensibility only maudlin with
oats and barley nowhere? Therefore, any way
the #. manifested proper º#: in kick-
ing the dead lion in his own lair. Had they been
permitted to spread the table-cloth upon the
church slabs that cover the lion's ashes, the
banquet would, doubtless, have had a greater
significance; but as this was not to be com-
passed, well, as near to the grave of the dead as
could be, was the next best spot whereon to fleer
and flout at the buried.
Having dined, MR. NewDEGATE was about to
give voice and kick, when—says the reporter-
‘an enormous paving-stone was thrown through
the window into the middle of the hall!”. M.R.
Spoon ER, sagaciously reading the sermon in the
stone aforesaid, requested NEwnegATE forthwith
to desist. And then, many a Protectionist, re-
flecting upon that stone did, like the contempla-
tive animal enshrined in Peter Bell,
. “with action dull,
Turn on the pivot of his skull
His long left ear!”
And then other stones—hard manna!—poured
in; windows were smashed; and the fight began,
and ended, as reporters have duly chronicled.
With this history, however, we have nought to
do, save to moralise upon the first granite shot
fired into the middle of the hall.
Now, this stone is clearly the grave-stone of
protection. Upon it is written the epitaph of
what is called jhe Country Party. This stone
is, moreover, a living, practical epigram. It
says: “You ask for a dear loaf, and our answer
is—“Cheap granite.’”
Re-impose the Corn Laws, and—oh, Protec-
tionists—take this as an earnest, that the very
stones would rise as rose the quartern-loaf.
To M. Soyer, on his “Symposium."
Soy ER, the praise thy skill deserves
Is perfectly immense,
For nice discernment in the nerves
Of gustatory sense.
But now Gore House hath been by thee
So glaringly defaced,
However good thy palate be,
We must dispute thy taste.
ADWICE TO PRE-RAFFAELITEs.
THE Pre-Raffaelite Brethren are right as to
their E. but we object to the rest of the
name by which they call themselves. It should
not be Pre-Raffaelite, but Pre-posterous. As
these gentlemen depict rachitis, struma, and
other diseased conditions of system so admi-
rably, why do they not give up oils, and paint in
distemper?

THE EX-ACTORS OF DRURY LANE AND
COWENT GARDEN.
OME surprise has been expressed
that, notwithstanding º:total
alienation of Covent Garden,
and the partial alienation of
Drury Lane, from the pur-
poses of the English Drama,
there is still “a fund for the
oor actors” of both esta-
lishments. At the former
there are no actors at all; and
though there may be a few
decidedly poor actors occa-
sionally at the latter, we
should think there will soon
cease to be any claimant on
the funds of either. MR.
HARLEY, the worthy master
of the Drury Lane fund, does
annually his best—as it is his
duty to do—for the purpose
of exciting our sympathies on
behalf of the concern over
which he presides; but he
has commenced talking in the
singular number about “The
Actor” whose path is cheered,
whose children are educated
and whose widow is provided
for, out of the resources of the
*†, h
There is every prospect that
this will soon become a literal
fact, and that there will be
only one Drury Lane Actor
left to claim the benefit of the
fund; for we see no chance of
any addition to the stock,
º as it takes, we
elieve, three seasons during
which there must be a con-
tinuous engagement to entitle
#. one to become even a
subscriber.
The only way in which the
fund can now be fed—except
at the annual dinner—is by
enlarging the sphere of its ope-
ration, admitting FRANconi's
stud and JULLIEN's French drummers, together with the Protectionists,
whoſperform there occasionally, to subscribe, to the fund, and come
upon it in case of necessity. The Protectionists really have some right
to be considered in the # of actors, for they do nearly all the “heavy
business” of the country, with a good share of the broad farce, neglect-
ing, however, altogether, the line of general, utility; Tor, by the bye,
what would be much better, suppose the General. Theatrical Fund
with its many claimants, were allowed to participate in the goo
things of its brother of Drury. We throw out this merely as a hint.
A JEWEL OF A KING.
IN an article on the Great Exhibition in the Times, we are told that
“the only King in India sent his crown, the coronet of his eldest son,
and the turban of his prime minister.”. We trust the distinguished trio
will not catch cold by sitting bare-headed until the crown, coronet, and
turban are, sent, home again. , The articles themselves are, vulgarly
speaking, “not to be sneezed at;” but, there, is no knowing what
amount of sneezing may be the result of their absence from the heads
of the King, the Prince, and the Minister.
There seems, something a little despotic, according to our free
notions, in a King's having sent away his Prime Minister's turban to
an exhibition in a foreign country. Nevertheless, humanity seems to be
spreading; for Eastern tyrants were not in the habit of limiting their
#. propensities to the turbans, but extended their operations
frequently to the heads, of their servants and subjects. For what we
know, the Indian Prime Minister may now be congratulating himself
that, it is only his turban, and not his head, that, has been sent by his
royal master as a contribution to the Great Exhibition.

LEAVES FROM THE LOG OF H.M.S. “PRINCE
OF WALES.”
(Flag Ship on the Serpentine Station.)
OUR readers are probably not aware that H.M.S. “Prince of Wales,”
is commanded by one of our most distinguished naval officers, the
HoNour ABLE BENBow HAzy, Midshipman. As Louis PHILIPPE was
called the NAPOLEoN of Peace, MR, HAZY has been called the NELson
of ditto. We extract the following record of his services, given on the
occasion of his hoisting his Flag, by the spirited editor of Hoar's New
Nautical Record.
“MR. BENBow Hazy entered the Navy in 1844, and was present at
|SIMPKIN's action with the Policeman (E.40) near Portsmouth. He
|joined the ‘Magnífico' soon after, and headed a party belonging to
that ship, who petitioned the Admiralty to allow them to have a milch
cow on board. This daring action, it will be remembered, was not so
successful as might, have been hoped. MR. HAZY was repulsed with
considerable loss. We next find him (where, by-the-by, it has been
hinted, several people would like to find him.) on the iterranean
Station. He
at night, to endeavour to 'cut out’ the Rifles, on the ºccasion of a
ball, in which they succeeded entirely to their satisfaction. He was
three times employed on an ºl. on shore in Albania against the
woodcocks, and twice wounded; once, while g a piece
of fire-arms through a thick hedge, with its muzzle him; and
once by a spent shot from Mr. Higsey, who was in a distan portion
of the field. Mr. Hazy's exploits at Malta will long be red.
He commanded the §." of the ‘Sibthorp,’ 80, at Regatta
of 1846. When a celebrated attempt was made to capture the hostile
cutter, ‘Dun, MB. HAzy volunteered at once, and was seen soon
afterwards leading the ‘Dun’ in tow; thus saving HER MAJESTY's
Fleet from a great deal of annoyance. He headed the Forlorn Hope at
the attack on the Pit during the civil war in the Malta Opera, &c. &c.
MR. HAzY wears several decorations (at his parents’ expense).”
How Punch became possessed of the official documents of the Flag
Ship, is not to be explained here; and, until the gallant HAZY, Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Serpentine Station, complains on the subject,
we don't think anybody else nas a right to... The pardonable exultation
of a sudden acquisition of rank is perceptible in our first document, a
GENERAL ORDER.
“H.M.S. ‘Prince of Wales,’ Serpentine, 30th April, 1851.
“The Commander-in-Chief directs the attention of his crew, and of
the crews of all gigs, cutters, punts, and dingeys, now or hereafter
serving or to serve within these seas, to the necessity of maintaining a
high standard of discipline. The Commander-in-Chief must remind the
crew or crews of this ship, and of all gigs, cutters, punts, and dingeys,
that this is absolutely necessary in the presence of the enemy!

Of hys inntent to heare;

For eche he payd a crowne.
“Here’s thirty-fyve good shilling,” he sayd,
“Whereby I'm out of poke;

THE VIRGINIAN SLAVE.
INTENDED As A COMPANION. To power’s “GREEK slave.”
THE POSTMAN OF THE WAVES.
THE high rates of postage for the transmission of letters
from the United Kingdom to foreign parts tend grievously
to discourage international communication, and the recipro-
cation of kindly and affectionate sympathies between sepa-
rated relatives and friends; thus to check the operation of
some of our finest feelings, defer the reign of universal
brotherhood, besides obstructing business. Various means,
therefore, have been suggested for transporting epistolary
intelligence over the briny deep by some cheaper conveyance
than the mail-packets, the charge of which for carrying a
letter from Boulogne to Folkestone—that is, 30 miles, or 2
hours—amounts to 64d. and upwards; a demand savouring
much less of the post than of the *:
It has been º for example, to send up balloons
with a favourable wind, having mail-bags attached to them,
contrived so as to be disengaged by means of a slow match,
calculated to burn agiven time, exploding a quantity of gun-
owder, on the balloon reaching a certain point, say over
aris; so that the mail-bag, detached from the balloon, shall
dropperpendicularly through the skylight of an attic into a
box provided for its reception. To this plan a serious objec-
tion is the mutability of the wind, which, if it were not liable
to chop right round and drive the balloon back again, could
not be depended upon for blowing with such steadiness and
uniformity as to bring the balloon precisely over the attic,
and at the exact moment when the gunpowder wouldignite;
and thus there would be considerable danger of the mail-bag
missing its destination, and falling into the Seine, or the
hands of the authorities, or on somebody's head. Some ingenious individuals have
also recommended the establishment of a means of communication between distant
places, how far apartsoever, whereby epistolary.correspondence will be º:
altogether, and even the Electric Telegraph itself will be quite cut out. This truly
marvellous time and space annihilator, is the Snail Telegraph of M. M. BENolt and
ALLIx. The term is no antiphrasis, applied to express, velocity, as a negro, by the
rule of contraries, may be called Snowdrop. The Snail Telegraph is literally a tele-
raph worked by means of snails—not, however, at a snail's gallop. It is mentioned
in the “Letters on Animal Magnetism,” just published by DR. GREGORY, professor
of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh, Snails, according to M. ALLIx, are
creatures of so much magnetic fellow-feeling, that once having been in contact, they
sympathise ever after at all distances. On this fact the snail'ſelegraph is .
The snails are caught, brought into contact, and marked—so many sets for each
letter of the alphabet, in case of accident. The snail in France, belonging to each
letter, will sympathise with his fellow, though the latter has been taken to America.
When a word is to be spelled in either country, a snail is galvanised for every letter
insuccession; and the effects of the shock-through a test, applied, successively to
all the snails on the other side of the Atlantic—are exhibited by his brother in the
bonds of magnetism.
Now, the only difficulty as to belief in the Snail Telegraph lies, as DR. GREgoRY
justly observes, “in *...* the fact of the extraordinary sympathy of snails,
which being once granted, the rest is not only possible, but easy.” But
Mr. Punch took several snails, put them by pairs in contact for some time, marked
them, then let them crawl about, poked them, and electrified them with a bit of
excited sealing wax; nevertheless, though all those which he electrified and poked
drew in their horns as quickly as our Cardinal, none of the others exhibited any
symptom of the sort; and he is convinced that, if he had squelched everyone of the
former, not one of the latter would have been hurt in the least. As snails evince so
little sympathy at six inches apart, Mr. Punch can hardly imagine that they can show
any with the Atlantic º them—or even with the Thames. -
On the whole, therefore, Mr. Punch is disposed to conclude that the best and
cheapest intercommunication with our friends and connexions across the billows,
would be the “Ocean Penny Postage, recommended by MR, ELIHUBURRITT, who
demonstrates the feasibility of the scheme in a pamphlet, whereunto Punch refers
the Government, “An Ocean Penny Post” we shall have sooner or later,
SHAKESPEARE, who prophesied under pretence of writing plays, has foretold it
in the well-known lines of Macbeth –
“The Weird sisters, handin hand,
Posters of the sea and land.”
The Sisters, represented in such amicable conjunction, are clearly Fraternity,
Affection, and Business; and their description as posters of both divisions of the
globe, evidently has reference to their presiding over a Universal Penny Postage.
In conclusion, Mr. Punch begs to express his opinion that Row1AND HILL, even
when completely at sea, will never be out of his reckoning.

THE GLORY OF GUNPOWDER."
HE Times Portsmouth
reporter informs us,
that, within eight-
and-forty hours, were
fired eight royal sa-
lutes from the ships
and platform battery;
at an expenditure-
calculates the writer
—“of gunpowder
which would serve to
maintain a well-con-
tested action.”
First Salute.—The
royal children, cross-
ing from Portsmouth

ants to the roar of arms. powder may be an
to Cowes. As
harden the i
element in high moral training. This may be considered a hard con-
dition of royaſ life; hence, happy are the unsaluted who, escaped from
the nurse, have for good and all escaped powder. -
Second Salute—The QUEEN and the Court. We cannot º: to
this. SIR. JAMES CLARKE may have prescribed charcoal and saltpetre
as a tonic for nerves; and forty-two pounders may have only acted as
*};"; thecaries.
Third Salute—The Duchess of KENT, saluted by the whole fleet.
This, perhaps, as an act of gallantry towards an amiable elderly lady, is
not to be questioned. Powder—like rouge—may become a necessity.
#. jº. and * go to Spithead to look at ships;
and can hardly see them for smoke. -
Fifth Salute-QUEEN’s birth-day. . Guns fire in remarkably good
spirits, as being a salute they enjoy mightily,
Sixth Salute-PRINCEss HELENA’s birth-day. Another one-and-
twenty powder-puffs, as becomes a mighty baby.
Seventh Salute.—Duchess of KENT honoured as before; not one of
the one-and-twenty guns refusing to salute her. -
Eighth Salute—Return of the QUEEN and Court; and completion of
168 explosions in eight-and-forty hours; the cost of gunpowder being
-(but we refer the curious reader to the Notes and ries of the
Board of Ordnance).
In connexion with this vital subject we give the subjoined letter.
It bears the Portsmouth post-mark:-
“H.M.S., Fictory.
“MR. PUNCH,-I am aforty-two pounder of this here ship. They
say I’m on the peace establishment; but if I don't smell of powder as
much as in the time of Trafalgar, i’m honey-combed old iron—and
nothin' better.
“I’m always a firing * blustering, and nine times and more out of
ten for nothin'... Now, I writes to give the Admiralty warnin'.
know what it will come to, and I can’t help it: but this it is.
“I don't mind doin' the salutes as is proper; but if I’m to be fired
and fired away for the smallest of outlandish princes whenever they
come, and the smallest of babies—well, I know my temper—some
o' these days I shall bust, Sir; I shall, Yes, bust’s the word: and so
no more at present “From yours,

THE PAPAL ARMOURY IN 1851,
THE Parisian Ultramontane Papist organ, the Univers, states that the
French authorities have caused 10,000 rations, and a large quantity of
powder, to be taken into the Castle of St. Angelo. We had thought
that the Popedom was antagonistic to everything rational; but we can
no longer deny that its defence is based, in some measure, upon ration-
ality, which, however, in its association with gunpowder, rather strongly
exemplifies that ultina ratio, the arguments of which are bombs and
bullets. This consideration reminds us of an omission in the Roman
department of the Great Exhibition, which ought to be rectified as soon
as possible. We want a few specimens there of the purely spiritual
weapons by means of which the “Chief of the Catholic world,” so called,
is retained in the alleged see of St. PETER. We suspect the spirit of
which they consist would in a decidedly visible shape, and would
present an extremely striking resemblance to lead, steel, and iron.

i to be looked at,
The
THE SHILLING DAYS AT THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
N being informed on the best Ameri-
can authority that the first shilling
day was to be the downfall of the
Crystal Palace, we went to the spot,
determined to take our chance of
being buried in the rubbish, cut
down with the glass, or left a miser-
able survivor to moralise, like
MARIUs, over the ruins. Leaving
our office at eight o'clock, we ex-
pected to find the tide of population
already rushing down Fleet Street
with fearful impetuosity; but the
tide was not up, for scarcely any
one was stirring, and we were there-
fore obliged to tow ourselves, or
rather to trust to our heels, in
making our way to Knightsbridge.
On reaching the doors; of the Ex-
hibition, we found massive barriers
intended to contain the multitude;
but the multitude consisted of so
few that they could scarcely contain
themselves, for they kept bursting
with laughter at the ponderous pre-
parations for resisting their ex-
pected violence. It was quite
evident that JoHN BULL has no
need for barricades in any shape,
and on this occasion, the mon-
strous wooden break-waters, in-
- ... tended to resist the anticipated
human torrent, excited only his playful ridicule.
Qn reaching the interior of the building, we had been led to believe, or
rather we should have been lead to believe, that the mob of shilling visitors
would at once proceed to a sort of Fine Art distribution by declaring a
dividend—among themselves—of all the precious assets within the
Crystal Palace.
Communism was to have been put into practice—according to our
American informants—on the first of the shillin : the jewellery
was to have been seized by a coup de main, while England was to have
been declared a Republic under the wings of the United States Eagle.
The Koh-i-moor diamond, especially, was to have become the subject
of a community of goods; but how this was to be done we know not,
unless by br g it in pieces, º: it to dust, reducing it to
powder, and scattering it over the whole world, with a due regard to
the equal rights of all people. As to the clocks and watches, those were
to have been dealt with after the same fashion;, the principles of
Communism being applied, probably, by giving a hand to one, a number
to another, a wheel to this one, and a spring to that, for the purpose of
carrying out the grand, Socialist idea of an equal distribution of
jº Even the authorities seem to have been influenced by some
such delusion, for the Koh-i-moor was guarded by an extra policeman,
whose office was an invidious sinecure; for the intelligence of the
shilling visitors caused them to pass with indifference the rather unin.
teresting object, which attracted the vulgar and stupid, gaze of the
guinea and five shilling visitors at the opening of the Exhibition. The
“superior classes” must begin to look about them, if they would
retain, the epithet, assigned to them; for there is no doubt which
class has, shown itself to be the superior, in the view taken of the
Great Exhibition.
The high-paying portion, of the public go to look at each other, and
while the . yisitors go to gain instruction
from what they see; and the result is, they are far better behaved
than the well-dressed promenaders who push each other about, and
stare each other out of countenance on the days of the high price of
admission. These people, however, have received a noble lesson from
$º who, throwing overboard the vulgar prejudice of exclusive:
ness, has visited the Exhibition on the shilling days, with a graceful
thus setting a
reliance on the masses, which their admirable behaviour has well
merited. HER MAJESTY has furnished an excellent example, also, by
the manner in which she views the contents of the Crystal Palace;
looking at every department in its turn with an intelligent eye, and
É. which it is a real glory to lead, instead of being
merely the royal dummy, or lay-figure, from whose dressing-up the
female world may take the shape of a sleeve, the form of a robe, or the
colour of a ribbon. The QUEEN and the shilling visitors are actuated
by the same rational desire for instruction, and the extremes in the
order of society have met on the intellectual ground that has been
thrown open to all by the Great Exhibition.
“LEND ME YOUR EARS.”
WE were in hopes that affairs of honour had been long ago voted
matters of disgrace, that smoke had evaporated, and that lead had
found its level. It seems, however, that people still continue to seek
the satisfaction of being the º or the victim of a murder,
and that attempts are still made to clean, reputations, like empty
decanters, with shot, and preserve characters in saltpetre. .
The French papers have given lately some truly appropriate parti-
culars of the still existing practice of duelling. Two people go out to
prove their courage. ne murders the other, and runs away; two
more look on at the murder, and run away; they travel under false
names, are guilty of a hundred petty tricks of deception, and are
all concerned in what, on the lucus a non principle, is designated an
affair of honour.
If all the incidents of one of these affairs of honour could be faith-
fully reported, there, is not one which would fail to make any one, with
the slightest F. to the feelings of a gentleman, most thoroughly
ashamed of having anything to do with it. The whole Fº is a
string of falsehood, from the . to the end of it. There is,
first, the assumption of false names, followed by a series of false pre-
tences, at every step, and constituting a string of unworthy subterfuges
quite at variance with every thing worthy of the name of honour. The
murderous part of it we leave to the authorities; which, in every civilised
country, should deal with the offence with a firm hand, as with any
other crime deserving of punishment. It is as an affair of honour, that
a duel is such a contemptible piece of imposture. The thing has
fallen as low as it can, and must soon go down altogether.
* DON'T SLEEP UPON IT.
AMONG the wonders of the Exhibition is a Bed that upsets itself by
machinery at a certain hour, and thus the adage of “as you make your
bed so you may lie,” becomes a lie indeed, as far as this bed is concerned;
for, after a given time, you cannot lie in it, however much care you
may have been at in making it. The bed in question is a sort of lit de
ing appropriate punishment on the slothful, by turning
justice, inflic -
them out of j neck and crop, when they have lain long enough.
It occurred to us, that some parties might be pleased to see the principle
of this bed applied to the Ministerial benches in Parliament, so that the
occupants might be made to turn out whether they liked it or not, after
a certain length of occupation. The same machinery might enable the
Opposition to turn in, and they, again, would have to turn out, in due
course, if the arrangement sug ested were brought to bear upon the
snug berths of Government. The only inconvenience might that
the candidates for Beds would become very numerous.
The Main Chance.
THE London Gas and Water Companies are in a state of considerable
despondency at the prospect of the speedy breaking-up of their monopoly,
and they complain that there is a deep-laid conspiracy to put their pipes
out. Our own opinion is that we have paid the piper quite long enough
on account of the water monopolists; and the high price of Gas has
always been a burning shame. Those who interest themselves in the
destruction of these impositions, may be said to go through fire and water
to serve the public.

THE MARVELLOUS SHILLING.
E are all of us intimate
—through ballads, at
s least, and fairy-lore–
with the potency of
fairy groats. We have
all heard of the magic of
such coin; but what is
the fairy fourpenny bit
of the old, old times, to
s the # Shilling of
1851? That real, pro-
saic twelve-penny piece
is worth any number of
groats struck at the
under-ground Mint,
wherever it may be, of
King Qheron. And
never did benevolent
fairy, with an eccentric
- - - yearning towards, the
aspirations of human folks, put more power into silver than the spirit of the times
has º: into a shilling piece; for therein is a genius that conducts its possessor
to all the triumphs of all the world: brings him face to face with the doings—
and among them the very choicest doings—of the droll, diversified beings, that
make the total of mankind. And this is the work of One Shilling!
Nevertheless, there was great doubt—shrewd suspicions of the decency—the
proper behaviour of merely—Qne Shilling.
Sixty Shillings—sublimed into three golden, sovereigns, and then transmuted
into season, male ticket—considered One Shilling to be inevitably One Mob;
insolent, noisy, swaggering Twelve-pence; -
Forty Shillings—the female card—shuddered at the bare idea of that low, vulgar,
riotous, destructive unit; that revolutionary levelling One Shilling.
... And a Dollar—the embodiment of five º the best haste, and
it may be said, the best push in a crowd to see all that was to be seen, before the
Crystal was breathed upon, and for ever and for ever dimmed by One Shilling.
OW, as §.". has its day, so it seems every Shilling; and, at
length, the Shilling shone; and wonderful was it to the doubters to mark how
well, Shilling knew its proper value: to observe what self-respect, Shilling had
for its innate º Not sixty shillings, transmuted and enshrined in three
f. pieces, with all the breeding, all the education, that is a condition of such
ransmutation, could behave with better courtesy, with more gentleness and
good-humour towards one another, than One Shilling towards One Shilling.
And, somehow, One Shilling has appeared more and more in earnest than Three
Sovereigns-than even Five, Shilling pieces. , , Sovereigns were wont to cluster
about the QUEEN OF SPAIN's diamonds thickly, anxiously, as though they were
all of them Spanish bondholders, and expected—with due waiting—to have those
brilliants converted into ready cash for part settlement of their claims.
And what light did the Mountain of º draw about itself—rings and rings of
º ºf in the fair persons of two sovereigns, and subsequently of
lve onlilings
it must be confessed that One Shilling does not look, with such idolatry—
does not open its mouth with such wonderment at the Koh-i-noor of the East as,
perhaps, at the steel, works of Sheffield. The sublimed charcoal, worth two
millions—were a purchaser to be found—has, in the shilling mind, a rival in the
steel fire-places, those enduring caskets made to hold the black diamonds of
Newcastle.
. Most interesting-most satisfactory, aye, and most ennobling, are the earnest and
simple doings of One Shilling. Think of its representatives.
ere is, a smock-frocked, rustic considering, among other rural matters, a
Canadian plough. That quiet, self-instructing peasant is—One Shilling.
There is fustian jacket with a quick, critical eye, examining machinery of every
sort;, that jacket is—One Shilling.
Sailors and soldiers move tranquilly along the nave; or pause in silent admiration,
with others circling the basin of the Crystal Fountain, º Shilling.
And there a whole school of parish children, silent–serious with wonder; one
and all-One Shilling.
Seeing what the Crystal Palace has revealed, since the 26th, never, in all his
experience, did Punch feel such gratitude for what One Shilling might compass—
never such admiration of what One Shilling, in its quiet, self-respect, can assert.
CATHEDRAL EXHIBITIONS OF 1851.
WE are informed, by a paragraph in a morning contemporary, that—
“The ancient Gothic structure, Westminster Abbey, is the daily attraction of thousands; and
tºo much praise cannot be given to the DEAN or WestminstER for his liberality in opening the whole
* the : edifice to the public free, (with the exception of HENRY THE SEveRTH's Chapel, for
e present). -
We really must question this assertion. It would be quite possible, in our
opinion, to give too much praise to the DEAN of WesTMINstER, for throwing
religion; and to exclude the public from º part of a
building belonging to a Church maintained by the nation, is
simply a piece of monstrous impudence. In times like
these, when the EARL OF ELLESMERE and other noblemen
throw open their picture galleries for the gratification of
the public, surely it is possible to praise a Dean somewhat
more than he deserves, for allowing us a partially gratuitous
admission to his Cathedral, when, in common decency, he
ought to have rendered it entirely free.

The epistle is intended to correct, by means of the book, a mistake
under which Mr. Punch is supposed, by his reverend correspondent, to
labour, concerning the mode of treating fractures and other injuries
practised at the establishment in question., Mr. Punch presumes that

Now, Mr. Punch is blessed with so sound a constitution, that when-
|ever he has the misfortune to cut his finger, he has only to bring together
the edges of the wound, which invariably heals by what his medical
is attendant calls the “first intention,” or as quickly as the necessary
process of “adhesive inflammation,” as it is termed by the same respect-
able practitioner, can be naturally accomplished. Since common court-
plaster answers this purpose as well as possible, neither Arnica, plaster
nor any other could possibly answer it better. To test the efficacy of
Arnica plaster upon others, Mr. Punch would have to try several
hundreds of comparative experiments, on as many subjects, with Arnica
plaster on the one hand, and ordinary plaster on the other, under
similar conditions, carefully ascertained, of general health, diet, regimen,
and all other circumstances that could expedite or retard the healin
process. This is rather too much trouble for Mr. Punch to take: an
it seems to have been too much for homºeopathists to take themselves:
Yet this, he imagines, is the way in which investigations are man
in Inductive philosophy, -which is the philosophy of Lord Bacon and
Mr. Punch, and all who pretend to be scientific men, as homoeopathists
do, whatever may be thought of the pretence. That “one trial will
prove the fact,” is the axiom of others than Punch and Bacon. -
The little book which accompanies the sticking-plaster is a treatise on
“Arnica and Rhus, with directions for their Use, in Mechanical
Injuries, and in other Affections.” It simply proves that homoeopathists
do not profess to reduce dislocations and fractures º means of
homoeopathic globules. Punch does not say they do. All he does say
is, that homoeopathic globules will as much set abroken bone, re-adjust
a displaced one, or reproduce an amputated limb, as remove any
disease whatever. Success, no doubt, in many instances, will attend the
treatment, thus, in this same little book, recommended for
* Dislocations.
“Of course the surgeon must reduce the dislocated limb; but Arnica taken internally,
and applied as a lotion afterwards, and Rhus after two or three days, a dose internally,
and applied as a lotion, greatly facilitate the cure, and prevent the injurious º:
quences of such an injury.” - - - -
Qf course the surgeon must reduce the dislocation. "Yes... A rather
...' element this in the treatment of dislocations ! An equally
judicious surgery is recommended by this clever little book in
“FRACTURES.
“In this case the surgeon must set the limb, but Arnica used internally and applied
as a lotion,” &c., &c.,
Cold water—per se—is no bad lotion for a limb swollen and inflamed
by reason of a fracture: and no evidence has been submitted to
Mr. Punch at all proving that an infinitesimal quantity of Arnica would
render it in any but an infinitesimal degree more efficacious. Infini-
tesimal globules are much too big for Mr. Punch to swallow, or for
anybody else endowed with more than an infinitesimal quantity of
common sense: however well they may be adapted to the oesophagus

THE BULL AND THE SCARLET STOCKINGS.
HERE can be no doubt that on
some early day CARDINAL
WISEMAN will * in
London streets in his most
scarlet stockings: stockings
dyed in the blood of the harm-
less kermes, boiled and beati-
fied for the occasion. Indeed
we should be very sorry did
CARDINAL WISEMAN not show
himself to the world in his
scarlet stockings: we also
hope to live to see his scarlet
hat carried before him to
Westminster, with SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM, SIDNEY HERBERT,
John BRIGHT, and CoBDEN–
then all of the Cabinet—look-
- ing blandly on from Downing
Street windows. The daugh-
ters of Doctor PRIMRose re-
ceived the gift of a guinea
each on the understanding
that they were never to spend
it. But surely, not so did
Pope PIUs give scarlet stock-
ings to the English Doctor
Iseman: they were given
to be worn; and worn they must be. Indeed, when we reflect upon the saintly audacity, the
pious bravado that stares and fairly crows from WISEMAN's picture in the Royal Academy,
we are certain that, ere long—especially stimulated to such exhibition by the advent of the
foreigner—we shall have the Cardinal in the streets with all his honours. His scarlet, so
shown, like the scarlet of a lobster, will be a beautiful evidence of the hot water he has
swum in.
And with this assurance, our anxiety is that CARDINAL WISEMAN should walk in peace
and safety whenever it shall seem right and fitting to him to walk in scarlet stockings. Now
this can hardly be in the face of British bulls.
In the court of Exchequer one MR. Hupson brings an action against a Hackney cow-keeper,
the owner of an evil-disposed bull that did toss and gore the aforesaid M.R. Hudson; the
bull—as it was proved—always “running at a person who had anything red.” The bulſ had
: a little girl in a red bonnet; and had shown his indignation at the scarlet collar of a
postman :
MR, HAwKINs—with his native eloquence and subtle power of analogy—said, if bulls were
to be driven along thoroughfares—
“It might become impossible for a military person to walk with safety along the street. Indeed any lady with
any red in her shawl, or dress, or the ribbon :*her bonnet, would always be in danger.”
MR. BARON PLATT, however, at once put the ladies out of court; avowing, 'upon his
reputation as a student of the female mind, that women were too astute for bulls. Be this as
it may; our anxiety is for the safety of CARDINAL WISEMAN, should he, in the full blow of
his Cardinalship, brave a bull–John Bull—in his scarlet stockings. How terrible if the
Cardinal should be gored or tossed l. Yet they do say that there is a man—by no means a
milkman, which means a milk-and-water-man—a man who threatens to let loose a bull at the
first official appearance of scarlet stockings! . This is said. . And we have heard a good deal of
noise from the bull; yet, if after all, the taurine bellowing should be no more than the voice of
a calf?—why, then, great would be the swagger and the triumph of the scarlet stockings.

F. M. WIDDICOMB'S PROCLAMATION ON THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO.
“GALLANT SoLDIERs,
“THE anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo has again visited our boards, when it is
our annual custom, to celebrate that proud, event by the engagement of at least a hundre
additional hands, in order that the British arms may carry off the Palm of Victory in the
mºst honourable manner, regardless of all expense.
I am again willing to encounter that expense, or in fact to encounter anything in the
defence, of my country; but I ask you, my gallant Soldiers, who have never shouted ‘NEY!'
when I have raised the cry of ‘WELLINGrón ('whether it would be fair to carry our triumph
right in the teeth of the facts that are pointed this year, like so many cannon, at us.
. “It becomes a conqueror to moderate his triumph, and not to trample too long with the
. heel pf revenge on the prostrate form of a conquered “Super.”—Comrades, remember
CHER I
“It is true, our vocation is War, and that we live by it. It is a noble calling, and often
when I hear the prompter's voice crying “To arms,” do I bless the happy moment that made
me, a soldier. Still, if we are always ready, comrades, to draw our swords, and a shilling a
night, in the cause of War, never let it be said that we were too proud to sheathe them again
when the same magnificent sum was offered in the holy cause of Peace!
...The Qlive is a great plant, but it is a question if the Cabbage is not much more useful!
... Yes, let us strive to be generous as well as brave. We are prepared for action, but we
will not rush into it. . This is the year of Peace, and the match, that is ready-lighted for our
to the more agreeable pursuit of lighting the
Frenchman's pipe, instead of putting it out.
We will all sit on the heights of Hougumont,
without any fear of being blown up, and drink to
the many happy Returns, as we smoke them, of
Friendship.
“Comrades, it has been my proud destiny
through life never to have taken a º but you
have always followed me. Oſten as I have led
you on the Wings of Victory, no matter
whether on the O. P. or the P. S. side, you have
never disgraced a single board of the noble
Theatre of War, of which I glory in being the
Hero of (at least) a Thousand Fights. When I
allude to the Theatre of War, of course I mean
Astley’s—a theatre in which conquerors, like
myself, delight to come and ‘fight their battles
o'er again.”
“I am confident, therefore, you will all follow
me in the step I am about to take. It is a step
that leads to the Temple of Peace—a temple that
should always be reflected on the brow of every
Conqueror.
“I am sure you will shout with me, when I
ropose that, in consequence of the number of
oreigners now assembled in London (Anno
Domini One of Universal Peace!) that
“THERE WILL BE NO BATTLE OF WATERLOO
THIs YEAR AT ASTLEY's l!!
“Surely out of the number of victories, of
which the English annals are composed, we can
well afford to sacrifice one! -
“After all, the highest victory is one gained
over human prejudices!—and the cheapest one,
too, in the long run. -
“On all other occasions, gallant Soldiers, you
will always find me at the post of honour, where
the danger is the thickest. In matters of danger,
I am of opinion that no General can cut it too
thick.

DOWNING STREET PUMP WATER.
THE Government Water Bill seems unlikely to
supply us with more water, than will moisten
flannel enough for a wet blanket to be cast upon
our hopes of a proper supply of that necessary
fluid. The water companies are still to be pur-
veyors to his Majesty the Public; so that our
cisterns will probably continue to be replenished
with Thames and New River, or, the draught
which fertilises but not purifies. Competition can
alone be depended upon for remedying this state
of things. Cannot some Company of enterprising
teetotallers start a “Temperance Tap, established
to Supply the Public with Genuine ADAM's Ale,”
in various parts of the metropolis” “MATHEw
& Co.'s Entire, drawn Mild, in your own Jugs;”
or, “The Noted House for the Celebrated Arte-
sian Stingo,” would be tempting announcements,
could they be depended on. The liquor could be
iſ furnished at prices at least as moderate as the
present water rates, which Londoners are now
paying for a beverage of such a nature, that,
after being ducked in it, any cleanly person
would wish to wash himself.
“'Tis but Fancy's Sketch.”
THE Americans say, that the reason they have
sent nothing to the Exhibition is, that the pro-
ductions of their industry are, in the first place,
too gigantic to be brought over; and in the next
place, the reality is so impossible to be under-
stood or described, that the only way to give us
any idea of it was to leave it all to our imagination.
Certainly, when we visit the United States depart-
ment of the Crystal Palace, we find ample space
for the imagination to revel in. The American
impatient artillery, shall be turned aside for once from its murderous mission, and devoted objets de certi are, literally speaking, fancy goods.

DIAMOND DIALOGUES.
Scene.—Crystal Palace, Main Avenue.—Discovered, PolicEMEN
A. l. and B. 2., on either side ºf the Golden Cage containing the
Koh-i-Noor, or MoUNTAIN of LIGHT. PolicEMEN speak conft-
dentially and guardediy.
...Policeman A. l. My detective friend, in the course of your remarkable
life, did you ever observe moths about a candle?
Policeman B. 3 iots." That is, in summer; Clapham Common—
'bout bull's-eye.
A. l. (with a wan smile, regarding the women, ten rows thick, around the
Koh-i-Noor). Behold them here. Women—moths: diamond—candle!
B. 2. Only what with us, and the cage, and Mr. Chuº's sensitive
lock—as I’ve heard it called—they can't burn their precious wings,
which is fingers.
A. l. True, my philosophic co-mate: they cannot putout the diamond.
B. 2. Else I'm blessed if there wouldn’t be a scrimmage for it.
Talk of the Chartists! Why, with none o’ the force here, and no
CHUBE's lock, I’m sure on’t by the women's looks, the tenth o' April
of glorious memory would be nothin' to it.
. A. l. What do you really think of this Mountain of Light, my
* companion? -
B. 2. Atween ourselves, I don't think much of it; but my wife takes
mighty credit for it. There’s no holding her in the court: she says
I’m ten times as precious as I was; and from this very diamond bring
home light enough about me to go to bed without a candle. The boys
in the court call me B. 2. the Glow-worm'
A. l. Who knows—
B. 2. I don't; but you as was once a usher, and can tell—
A. l. Who knows—I was about to ask—whether a man may not gaze
º a. * so long, until its transmitted lustre becomes a part
Ol num"
B. 2. As a detective, with some people and no bars atween 'em, I
should say, not at all unlikely.
A. l. My simple friend, do you know what the diamond is made of P
B. 2. It can’t be Thames water: tho’ I’ve heard it’s nothin' but
water o’ some sort, out of the springs of the earth; which, with the
weight of the mountains upon it, manufactures the diamond by
hydraulic power.
A. l. The diamond, my friend, is charcoal; nothing but charcoal in
an intense state of development. ...Yes, that blazing oh-i-moor, and a
piece of black charcoal, are of the like common stock.
B. 2. Ha!, just as they say, we’re all the same flesh-and-blood;
dukes, and chimbley-sweepers: only the duke's the diamond, and the
chimbley-sweeper's the charcoal. Well, how the women do stare!
-(Speaks firmly, but mildly.) Pass on, ladies; pray, pass on-don’t
scrooge so. (Aside to A.l.) I say, did you ever see a cat, all alone,
watching a canary, or a bowl of gold-fish?' (A. l. nods affirmingly.)
Well, then, just look at that old ladylookin' at the diamond!. If her eyes
don't turn green and yellow, and if she don't run the tip of her tongue
round her mouth as if she was already tastin' the Mountain! (Tº the
ſº Lady.) Pass on, Madam; pray, pass on. (Aside.) Old fool!
t wouldn't agree with you, if you could swallow it:
Lady from Battersed. Are you sure, Mr. Policema
mistake? This can't be the Mountain; it’s so very small. -
B. 2. Why, yes, Ma'am; Primrose Hill is bigger. But you see, it’s
one o’ them 3. that some folks make out of mole-hills.
(Despairingly.) Will you pass on, ladies? -
A. l. (with mild sarcasm). Pray, pass on, Madam-do cutthe diamond'
Male Visitor (savagely). Ishall report you. You’ve insulted my wife
—and we don't pa pºlicemen to insult people and make jokes. -
Peckham Lady. Well, I am disappointed—it is very small. Isn't it
º small, Mr. Policeman? Now, don't you think it very small?
2. Yes, Ma'am; quite below your notice-pass on. -
Islington Lady (with slight disgust). And is this all? This amountain!

it may be bigger. Diſmonds are souncertain.
Islington Lady (passing on). Like his impudence. [Alull ensues.
B. 2. Do you know where the thing come from, and all about it?
What’s the dimond's history, or as you would say, its biography? . .
A. l. Well, it can’t brag of its com any afore it came to us; that is
—as I've read. It was found in Golconda and sent, to the GREAT
Mogui.; stole from him that stole it; the next thief being killed by the
next thief; who was again robbed of the Mountain, that was stolen
again and again until-
. 2. Yes—go on. -
A. l. (with emotion). Until it became the lawful property of the
British Crown. -
B. 2. Hallo! What, did we buy and pay for it?
A. l. Bought it with the brave blood of armies, and the º of
soldiers' pay! Paid I don't know how much in blood, and gold, and
gunpowder, and bayonet cold iron. - -
..B. 2. (scratching his head). Well, Idare say it’s all right. But, Isay,
if there was only a sort of upper Pºlice force, big enough to tackle’em,
what a lot of kings, and conq’rors, and generals, with their greenlaurels,
would have found themselves in the station house. -- -

never found any Police Court for the strongest. -

GEOMETRY OF HIGH LIFE.
THE PROPERTIES OF THE CIRCLE.
“The August circle included their Royal Highnesses,” &c.-Court Circular, passiºn.
HE Circle is a form of society
existing only among the su;
perior classes. The principal
varieties of the Circle are
the August, the Illustrious,
the Distinguished, and the
Select; there are no Petty,
Obscure, Indiscriminate, or
Promiscuous Circles. In re-
ference to the lower ranks, we
talk of “sets” and “lots,”
and “the humbler spheres,”
but not “circles,” are men-
tioned.
An August Circle is a
Circle of which the centre is
a monarch, and the radii—or rays of glory and splendour-are
**i. or princes.
An Illustrious Circle is a Circle having for centre a royal duke, and
for radii peers and nobles of high rank.
A Distinguished Circle is a Circle the centre whereof is formed by
some great statesman or warrior; its radii consisting of ambassadors,
leading politicians, generals, and bishops. -
. A Select Circle is a Circle whose centre is some highly aristocratic
individual, and whose radii consist of persons of fashionable notoriety,
and correct repute.
The radii of the Circles of high life are not all equal. For example,
an earl is not equal to a duke. Consequently their centres are not at
the same distance from every point of their circumferences.
For examples of the mode of describing a Circle of high life, see the
Court Circular.
The Quadrature of Distinguished and Select Circles has been at-
tempted, but never accomplished. The Fashionable Square, in many
instances, may be demonstrated very nearly to contain the Select.or
Distinguished Circle; but there are elements in every Square, which
are incompatible with the definition of any Circle to which Distinction
or Selectness can be ascribed with the least degree of accuracy.

“YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT.”
HERE will soon be an abso-
lute necessity, my dear
Punch, for a new dictionary
of the English language.
The meaning which DR.
Johnson attached to the
words “faithful,” “affection-
= ate,’ and “obedient,’ was
grossly absurd. Daily ex-
perience attests his igno-
3 rance. “Yours faithfu #.
regrets that it is out of his
power to serve you;, ‘Yours
truly” has disposed of his
patronage elsewhere; ‘Yours
dictated to under under any
circumstances. “Your at-
tached friend” takes
ticular pains to detail to you!
the minutest circumstances connected with events which have tended
to lower you in the estimation of your associates; and, in the tone
of his communication you detect a pleasant vein of sarcasm, which
proves to you that he rather relishes your distresses.
“Inexperienced, correspondents are familiar with the harsh deter-
minations of ‘Theirs humbly, and would prefer to receive a letter with
almost any other signature; but, of all letter-writers, “Your obedient
servant’ is, without doubt, the most terrible and the most unpleasant.
‘Your obedient servant” reminds you that you are in his employ,
and that, if you do not keep better hours and pay more attention to
your books, he will dismiss you. Your obedient servant' will be happy
to meet yourself and a second on Wimbledon Common, at a i.
early hour, for mutual target-practice, to satisfy his wounded honour.
*Your obedient servant” i. not wait another day for his money, but
will instantly place the matter in the hands of his lawyer, and leave you
to bear the consequences. “The obedient servant’ of MR. NATHANIEL
Stokes issued a letter from the Treasury, informing . gentleman
that his claim for a Government ºil. in consideration of his
father's services, as lieutenant of the Limerick Yeomanry, could not
be satisfied while so many more pressing and important claimants
remained to be provided for. “Your obedient servant’ is truly an
unmanageable fellow. There is no wheedling him. He never gives you
a day’s grace. He refuses you a temporary loan. He dismisses you
from your situation. He calls upon you to explain yourself. He begs
that you will discontinue your addresses to his daughter. He never
gives credit. In short, of all º he is the most disobedient.
“‘Yours humbly’ is a bore; but ‘Your obedient servant’ is a
correspondent who is not to be trifled with. Now, Sir, why not write
plain unvarnished English? Why should your creditor, sign himself
Your obedient servant, when the rogue knows very well that you are
his slave? Why should a man who never met you but once in his life,
sign himself “Ever faithfully yours,” when he {º. that he does not
care two pins about you, and would read a notice of your death in the
morrow's paper without the least, emotion?, These, Mr. Punch, are
little social hypocrisies, which, while they mask the serpent, weaken the
meaning of the friend.

A SHORT STORY FOR SIR ROBERT PEEL.
SIR ROBERT PEEL–(there is a music in the name that attunes
Punch to tenderness)—SIR RoBERT PEEL, listen to a short story: then
lay it to your heart, and cease not to ponder it.
. Once upon a time there was a young man whose heritage was the
immortal wealth of a great name. This young man was in evil hour
tempted by three Witches, even as Macbeth was tempted, and finally
betrayed by the Weird Sisters. . But the Witches that betrayed our
º man were not things animate; nevertheless they were of all
trayers the most subtle, and the most dangerous. And the names
of these betrayers were—PEN–INK–PAPER.
Oh, young SIR Robert PEEL, take heed how you take them! What
an innocent look they have, and yet how they may stab a man's own
name-how they may spatter blots upon a man's own reputation. How
harmless looks a sheet of paper; yet may not a man make of it the
winding-sheet for his self-slain happiness?
.CORN IN THE EAR,--The wheat is said to be in a very forward con-
dition. The papers speak of large ears of corn already shown as samples.
But, perhaps, at the late Corn Exhibition at Tamworth were shown
the very longest ears of all.

BRIEFLESS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
MEssRs, BRIEFLEss and DUNUP have recently visited the Exhibition,
and have displayed a reckless levity, which has excited the worst fears
of their friends and relatives. On entering the Refreshment Room,
MR. DUNUP called loudly for “a barrister's refresher; ” and MR.
BRIEFLEss, throwing aside the sobriety becoming his time of life, rushed
frantically into the Office of the Executive Committee, and, throwing
down sixpence, declared he intended devoting it to the purchase of
works of art, inquiring, at the same time, what he could have for the
money.
MR. DuNUP, ºf up to one of the attendants, asked to be shown a
windlass, capable of winding up the most hopeless affairs, and MR.
BRIEFLEss burst into an . of tears under the Statue of LoRD
ELDON. Both of the learned gentlemen left the building, declaring that
instead of applying for the coif, they should apply for the oilskin cap
and truncheon, not as serjeants at law, but as police serjeants.
THE ALARMIST'S DREAM.
IDREAMT that I stood in the Crystal Halls,
With Chartists and Reds at my side,
And that all who assembled in those glass walls
Came there the contents to divide.
Of riches too great to count it could boast,
Andjewels of world-wide fame;
But I found, when I woke, which surprised me most,
They remained there all the same.
I dreamt the swell mob was there in a band
With thieves of every degree,
And with skill that no police could withstand
They picked all the pockets of we.
And I dreamt that one of the scampish host
To grab the Koh-i-Noor came;
But I found when I woke, which surprised me most,
It was safe there all the same.
BEFORE AND AFTER.
“PUNCH, that admirable—that polished reformer of every abuse.”—Manx Cat.
[Punch pinches the Cat's ear.]
“That once humorous, but now malignant journal; need we say, Punch 2"—Manz Cat.
“The wit of Punch sparkles as brightly, and with the same purity, as the morning
dew upon the opening rose.”—Kilkenny Potato.
[The Potato is skinned by Punch.]
“The wit of Punch—or what the buffoon would pass for wit—is small beer, ten days
dead in a tin mug.”—Kilkenny Potato.

“What we most admire in Punch is that cosmopolitan liberality—that enlarged
sympathy—that gives a world-wide value to his every page."—The Pope's Eye.
[CARDINAL WISEMAN is ruddled into an English Cardinal.]

Punch / However, his day is approaching its end. The snuff of his farthing candle
already flickers on the save-all, and will soon expire in its own filthl"—The Pope's Eye
hit by Punch.
Sleep (not) at Will.
Johnson says of BURTON's Anatomy of Melancholy, that it is the only
book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to
rise. How voluminous would be the catalogue of books that might

“Do TRY ANOTHER PIECE!”
ALEXANDRE DUMAs has been producing the fourth piece founded on
Monte Christo, and the fifth is already underlined. Really, if ALEXANDRE
continues at this rate, his piece of Monte Christo bids fair to be a rival
to the celebrated “Thirty Years' Peace: ”.. after which we should
recommend him to take in hand the “Thirty Years' War.”

The Colonel's Last. |
WHEN the Colonel was informed of the attack by certain “gentle-
men” on the Derby Day—an attack in which they pelted the people
with eggs—the Colonel emphatically observed, that the only way, to
punish the offenders would be to make of them “the most terrible
eggs-ample.”

A HINT FOR THE AMERICAN NON-EXHIBITORS.
AMERICA continues to represent itself at the Crystal Palace as a large
place, that is—to adopt an American word—very sparsely, occupied.
The country and its products of art are appropriately typified-there
being plenty of room, which is illustrative of the one, and there being a
poor supply of the other. *...*. the Great Exhibition, wants an
addition to its inhabitants; and we have a plan for putting an end to
the aspect of desolation and barrenness for which the United States–
as shown in Hyde Park—are conspicuous. As visitors are now flocking
in from abroad, and from the country, we propose that America should
be allowed to utilise its empty space by letting it out in lodgings. Why
should half-a-dozen families be crowded into one house, several persons
into a room, and three or four into a bed, when there is a quantity of
waste ground in the Crystal Palace itself which might be profitably occu-
pied? By packing up the American articles a little closer, by displaying
Colt's revolvers over the soap, and piling up the Cincinnatipickles on the
top of the Virginian honey, we shall concentrate all the treasures of
American art and manufacture into a very few square feet, and beds may
be made up to accommodate several hundreds in the space claimed for,
but not one quarter filled by, the products of United States industry.
We would propose, therefore, that the Yankee Commissioners be
empowered to advertise America as affording accommodation to those
who wish to spend a week in visiting the Great Exhibition; and they
might, describe it as “Eligibly situated within a few minutes' walk of
Austria, Russia, France, and Switzerland, commanding an excellent
view of the “Greek Slave, and immediately opposite the largest looking-
; in the world, by which the process of shaving may be greatly
acilitated.”. By an arrangement with the Commissioners, whose duties
must be rather light, breakfast could no doubt be provided for the
lodgers before starting on their rounds; and the sign of the Spread
Eagle would be an appropriate one to adopt, for the hotel department
of the speculation.
Consideration on Cab Reform.
WITH such determination have Cabmen persisted in the endeavour to
extort more than their legal fare from the public, that it has been found
necessary to reduce their demands by MAYNE force.
BEECH LEAF TEA.
THE papers state that—
“Mr. Stevens, a tradesman, has been fined £250 by the Liverpool Magistrate for
manufacturing an article called tea from the leaves of beech and plane trees.”
And if MR. STEvens has manufactured English congou from English
beeches for any length of time, MR. STEvens can very well afford to
pay the penalty out of the profits of the deceit. But if MR. Stevens
were at this time |*|| some three months' retirement from the
world in Lancaster gaol, dressed in prison grey, and picking prison
oakum, MR STEVENs would not, on his return to society, look, so
comely, as no doubt he does, in the eyes of his neighbours; neither
would his name bear so respectable an odour. cases of proved
adulteration should be punished by imprisonment and hard labour, not
by a fine. When mere money-money only—is made the fuller's earth
it is wonderful what dirty work men will do, confident that the said
yellow earth can make them clean and respectable as ever.
In Turkey, they nail the ear, of an unjust baker to his shop-post.
This, no doubt, is barbarous and cruel: equally barbarous and shocking
would it be to clap a beech-leaf tea-merchant in an iron cage, and for
awhile suspend him from a branch of one of his own tea-trees.
CRIMINAL CHRISTIANS.
WE are by no means displeased to learn that, in accordance with a
rescript of the Pope, of the 7th ult, in Florence, Count GUIC-
CIARDINI, and six other gentlemen, were seized by the police, and have
been condemned to various terms of exile. Their crime was this:-
The Count had read and expounded to his friends a chapter of the
Gospel of St. John, in DiopATI's Italian translation. , And the
Pope, wisely fearing the spread of Christianity in Italy, as destructive
of his É. punishes the religionists. The old j. was,
“The Christians to the wild beasts?" The º mandate of
the holy Fisherman is—“The Christians to the sharks;” i.e., the
gensdarmes. - -
Punch earnestly hopes that MazzINI will keep his portmanteau in
readiness for travel. At every minute the great triumvir may be
called for.

PUNCH ON CRICKET.
INTRODUCTION.
THE Game of Cricket, though very ancient, is not quite as old as
the hills; for the hills are naturally inclined against a sport requiring
a level surface. Cricket is a promoter of cheerfulness and hospitality;
for it causes one player to open his gate to another, and invite him, in
a double sense, to take an innings at his homely wicket. The achieve-
ments of the bat are frequently celebrated by a ball; and even
enemies who have met as bowlers, have been known to forget in the
bowl all their animosity. It is not important to know the precise date
at which Cricket was introduced, who set up the earliest wicket, or
was the first to stir his stumps in this country.
In a MS. dated 1344, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, a woman is
represented in the act of giving a ball to a man; while in the back-
ground are several tall and little women trying, as so many º stops
and short stops, to catch the ball; but they are all ugly, and there
does not seem to be any great catch amongst them. -
The game familiar to our eyes, and much too familiar with our heads,
known in the streets as Cat, is believed to be the origin of Cricket—
which was formerly known as Cat and Dog; but, as the passing
stranger, or the pane of glass, forms the wicket aimed at in this case,
the game is only popular with the more mischievous portion of the
juvenile community.
In modern times Cricket is the favourite game with the soldier, the
sailor, and the clergyman; among each of which class there are many
who learn the art of long stopping while waiting for, promotion or
preferment; and who, though they may have often had the ball at their
feet, get, somehow or other, bowled out in the long run. For these
trials of'life. Cricket is an excellent preparative; and it is said, on the
authority of ČArrºn GoRDON, that, on the eve of Waterloo, some of
the officers were amusing themselves with the bat, while others were
dancing at a ball. -
It is a curious fact that the antiquarians have not yet tried a turn at
Cricket, for though they have groped among the foundations of almost
ºthing. the brick-bat is the only bat they have hitherto taken in
n
We, in a spirit of deeper veneration for antiquity, have explored a
wider field in the hope of finding it a Cricket field, and having taken a
walk with old SUIDAs—we fancy we hear the reader .# who is
SUIDAs? but let that pass—we have stumbled over a species of Cricket
being played under the classical name of Cottabos in a retired corner
of Greece. In this game a piece of wood stuck in the ground enabled
the Athenians to put up a stump without much expense, and being
stumped up to this extent, another piece of wood placed º
completed a cheap and effective wicket. A dish hung down from eac
end, but instead of a ball, the player threw with a vessel full of wine;
. * the game might be termed, to a certain extcnt, a game of
OWIS.
Cricket can only be played by men of excellent temper, who are
willing, like HAMPDEN, to fall in the field, who can submit cheerfully to
the chances of battery from the bat, and of assault from the ball. The
game is essentially English; and though our countrymen carry it abroad
wherever they go, it is difficult to inoculate or knock it into the
foreigner. The Italians are too fat for Cricket, the French too thin,
the Dutch too dumpty, the Belgians too bilious, the Flemish too
flatulent, the East Indians too peppery, the Laplanders too bowlegged,
the Swiss too sentimental, the Greeks too lazy, the Egyptians too ſong
in the neck, and the Germans too short in the wind.
A good Čricketer must have an eye as sharp as a needle, a hand as
tough as a thimble, and a leg as light as a bodkin. Russia should be
lable to produce no leather equal to his lungs, and India should not
show a rubber half as elastic as his muscles. He should have an eye as
steady as glass, with a frame of iron, and his limbs should be a study to
the limner. With these qualifications, we may hope to make him a
Cricketer, if he will accompany us into the field we are now entering.

the Peace Society, that he will not have a single flower in his garden;

OH, POOR FARMERS
As sung by PHILIP Pusey, Esq., M.P., to his Constituents, in the
Character of the “Agricultural Serenader.” -
AIR-" Oh, Susannah.'
WHEN first I went to Parliament,
The Farmers' Friend to be,
I voted for Protection |
To British Industry.
At last the people got cheap bread,
You “know the reason why,” :
And then Protection’s doom was sealed: |
Poor Farmers, don't you cry.
Qh, poor Farmers! don't you cry for me
To try and bring the Corn Laws back; for that can never be.
Protection's goose is wholly gone;
The flock has lost its leaders:
LoRD STANLEY and DiskAELI too
Declare themselves seceders, -
My lord, in language plump and plain,
And BEN, in speeches sly;
Whilst YoUNG and FERRAND spout in vain. -
Poor Farmers, don’t you cry.
Oh, poor Farmers' &c.
A paltry duty if you got, "
ive shillings, let us say,
So small a rise would me’er suffice
To make your produce pay;
But all attempts upon their food
The people will deſy:
Free Trade has triumphed, once for all;
Poor Farmers, don’t you cry.
Oh, poor Farmers' &c.
With all the House asleep one night,
Whilst REYNoLDs bored us still,
I dreamt that you had set to work
_With energy and skill;
The power of steam you had begun
In farming to apply,
d profit crowned your enterprise:
Poor Farmers, don’t you cry.
Oh, poor Farmers' &c.
Now, gentlemen who live by land,
We all must look around;
And with progressive husbandry
Turn to, and till the ground.
On Diligence, by Science ruled,
Alone we can rely:
Protection’s dead and buried;
Poor Farmers, don’t you cry.
Oh, poor Farmers &c. |
GENTLEMEN FROM THE EGG,
NE day last week, certain gentlemen—
for they were very well drest—were
2 charged at the Southwark police office
with throwing foul eggs, in the way of
sport, upon the folks returning from the
races. John BULL always improves
upon the effeminate sports of the Con-
tinent. In Carnival time the Italians
pelt one another with egg-shells filled
., with rose-water. The manlier John
BUIL prefers his eggs as fetid as they may be,
We think the magistrates might, in their judgment, copy the decree
of a certain Bey of Tunis; who, on taking captives too old to work, had
them—says the story—breeched in feathers, and made them sit upon
eggs.
ºftw. if justice at Southwark condemned the Epsom offenders to
sit a month upon their own eggs?
What's the Odds so Long as They're Happy?
THE contest between the different countries of the world in the
Great Exhibition of Industry may be called, as far as the rivalry
between other nations and America is concerned, “all the world to
nothing.”

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FROGWERSAZIONE AT THE MANSION HOUSE,
AST week the LORD MAYOR
gave — what was erroneously
called—a Conversazione to 1500
natives and foreigners in honour
of the Exhibition. Frogversazione
will be found the better word.
In default of banquet and loving-
cup, and those coarse appeals to
the “grosser senses,” there was
a display of , old watches, old
MSS., and other curiosities.
“The things, however,” (says the
Times) “which appeared to attract most
attention were the feet of spiders, flies,
and frogs, and the human skin, magnified
guests had an opportunity of looking.”
How much more ennobling
to look at flies through a micro-
scope, than to contemplate bees'-
wing in a bumper! Calves’-foot jelly has no chance against the feet
of spiders: the once lively turtle is beaten even by a tadpole; whilst
to see the human skin magnified must be—according to, the authority
of the Court of Aldermen—infinitely more gratifying to the intellectual
citizen than to feel the said human skin expand with the magnifying
power of six or seven courses.
Then there was a concert, which, from “the constant buzz of con-
versation,” was rendered a perfect hum! -
Everybody was of course delighted with the higher tastes and nobler
aspirations manifested by his lordship; and Punch congratulates the
LoRD MAYOR who has shown such an intelligent preference for science
in the abstract to SoYER in the gross. Nevertheless, if this innovation
grow into a custom, may not the practice be fatal to the honest ambition
of many worthy citizens at present looking towards the chair? For
instance, science may select her sons for yors, instead of custom
taking mere aldermen in rota. With frogs for fare, we may have a
PROFEssoR Owen chief magistrate as the best exponent of the dainty:
whilst the human skin under a microscope will inevitably demand a
LORD MAYor ERAs MUs WILson to expatiate upon the beautiful
mystery, the uses and abuses of its web. --- - -
With every respect for science, possibly the citizens and visitors at
the Mansion House may, on reflection, prefer the human skin under a
napkin to the human skin under a thousand power lens; and even a
LoRD MAYor—giving up the feet of flies and frogs—may think it
better to take the old time-honoured stand on knife and fork.
ANOTHER Account.
LITERATURE and Science have taken a very easterly direction within
the last two or three years, since the Lord Mayors have commenced
inviting authors and artists to the Mansion, House. An attempt has
just been made to introduce the Conversazione into the City; and,
though we give all due praise to the idea, we cannot say much for the
execution, in the present instance. The objects of interest submitted
to the company were not very recherché, and the most conspicuous were
... the feet of spiders, flies, and frogs, magnified through microscopes.”
This sort of amusement had certainly the merit of cheapness and sim-
plicity; and, as flies have only recently “come in,” their legs may be
glassed among the delicacies of the season—at least, for the present.
It is quite true that the idea is not new, for the Greenwich pensioners
have long been famous for an exhibition of a similar kind; the only
difference being, that, while the Lord MAYoR has magnifi d the legs
only of spiders and flies, the Greenwich veterans may be said to have
“gone the entire animal,” by applying the magnifying process to the full-
bodied native cockroach. Among the other curiosities, was “a col-
lection of old watches;” but we are not told whether that interesting
article, the “old night, watch,” since superseded by the new police,
formed part of the number. It was difficult to catch all that was said,
and particularly in the neighbourhood of the flies' º there was a
constant buzz that rendered individual remarks inaudible.
The Tol (de rol, lol, d) eration Brigade.
WE understand that it is the intention of those loyal and patriotic
gentlemen in the House of Commons whom the Eraminer aptly terms
the “Members for Rome,” to form themselves into a Stake Club. The
symbol of the Association is to be the Goose and Gridiron.
A BLACK JOB.
THE Protectionists excuse themselves from the charge of indelicacy
towards the memory of SIR. R. PEEL by declaring, that they are not
expected to be particular to a shade.

“PERMANENT HAPPINESS” AT A DISCOUNT.
WE used to think it was impossible to fix a money value on happiness
of even the most fleeting description, but an advertisement in the Times
of last Thursday lets us into the secret that Happiness has fallen to a
discount, and that “a small sum” will secure not simply the temporary
article, but the permanent commodity. If any of our readers doubt,
let them read the following.
YOUNG LADY, whose permanent happiness would be assured by a
small sum of money, makes this APPEAL to such benevolent individuals as
may be prompted to aid her. Any subscription will be most gratefully received.
Address to
We are curious to know what the “permanent happiness” consists
in, that may be secured for a small sum of money. Perhaps, as there
is a young lady in the case, a marriage license may be the “permanent
happiness” that only waits for fulfilment in consequence of the want
of funds to purchase the desired document. We are told, however,
that “any subscription will be most gratefully received;” so that any
|individual who is ambitious of the honour or pleasure of contributing
to a young lady’s “permanent happiness,” has now an opportunity of
doing so by an offer of himself.

MR. PUNCH AND TOBY DRESSED FOR THE QUEEN's FANCY BALL.
Deaf as a Government Post.
A TRADESMAN advertises his “Portable, Alarum Bells,” which he
W.' recommends to the notice of “members of parliament.”
e think this satirical dog of a tradesman should be summoned to the
bar of the House for contempt of Parliament. Does he mean to imply
that members are generally such a sleepy set, that it is more difficult to
rouse them than anybody else? Is he anxious, to try the effect of his
alarum upon LoRI. John P. knowing too well that if it succeeds in
making, him open his eyes, it cannot fail to make every one else jump
. and look about them. The experiment is a bold one; but we are
afraid that the alarum must sound from one end of the kingdom to the
other before it has any chance of making LoRD JoHN Russell sensible
that it is high time to be up, and doing something.

“Oh, I Beg Your PARDING, Miss ; But would You BE so obligiNg
As To show ME THE WAY. To THE QUEEN o' SPAIN's JEwels?”
WILLIAM AND SARAH ;
OR, THE LABOURS OF ROYALTY.
As WILLIAM and SARAH, one evening in June,
Was a-walking in the meadows, they spied the new moon;
“Lookee, WILLIAM, up yander’s the new moon,” says she,
Which I wish and turns my money whenever I see”
“And what dost turn thy money for,” cries WILLIAM, “I pray?”
“Oh! my wish for to obtain, as the old women say.”
“And what may º wish, now,” says the young man, “have been * *
“Oh!” says she, “I wished as how I wor HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.”
“If thee'st wish to be the QUEEN, then, young woman,” said he,
“I hope you wishes also PRINCE ALBERT was me.
But tell me what causes thy fancy to range,
So that with the QUEEN OF ENGLAND thee want'st for to change?”
“I should like never having to labour no more,
No scrubbing the hearth-stone, nor sweeping the floor,
No darning nor stitching, like I’ve to do now,
Nor rising so early to go and milk the cow.
“I should like for to slumber as long as I’d a mind,
And then to have my breakfast when I was inclined;
To be drest all in silks and in satins so fine,
| And to eat the nicest sweetmeats, and drink the best wine.
“I should like to have dances almost every night,
In my Palace, with virgin wax candles alight;
With a beautiful top-knot of feathers to wear,
And diamonds and pearls, too, all over my hair.
“I should like, when it pleased me, my Court for to hold;
To sit on my throne, with a crown on of gold;
And to rule my dominions with sceptre and ball,
And not to have no other trouble at all.”
When thus she had ended, said WILLIAM, and smiled
“Now bless thee, dear SARAH, thee talk'st like a child!
There’s more work for the QUEEN than thee dream'st of to do:
Read the news, and you’ll see what she's got to go through.
“Each morning she rises soon arter the lark,
Excepting in winter, and then it is dark;
And, the weather permitting, PRINCE ALBERT and she
Takes their walk on the Slopes, wheresoe'er they may be.
They breakfastes so early, in wet or in fine,
That they gets about their business most days afore nine;
They’ve a-gone at half-past, as the papers do say,
“No sooner has she swoller'd her coffee or tea,
With her egg or her rasher according as may be,
Than there comes LoRD JoHN Russell, with something to say,
Or else it is LoRD PALMINSTER, or mayhap SIR GEORGE GREY.
-- º the Ministers have done with the QUEEN,
There’s this or that Ambassador that has to be seen;
Or a Plenipotentiary that is just for to start,
And represent HER MAJESTY in some foreign part.
“Or else there is warrants and papers to sign,
Which must more or less her attention confine;
Then there’s some manufacter she’s engaged for to view,
Or inwention as is useful, or wonderful, or new.
“Then perhaps a Privy Council there is to be held,
Whereat to perside she’s in duty compelled;
And next she’s foreign Princes to receive and entertain,
From Roosher and Proosher, France, Portingal, and Spain.
“Very often to talk their own lingo has she
With Serene and Royal Highnesses from High Germany,
And such conversation for hours to have to find
Must be terrible trying sure-ly to the mind.
“Then, she’s drawing-rooms, likewise, and levvies to hold,
Where there’s three or four hundred of people, I’m told,
That comes forrards, by turns, for to kiss the QUEEN’s hand,
Which can't be but uncommon fatiguing to stand.
“All these ockipations her dinner makes late,
And over the †. she has not long to wait;
She must § and get ready for the guests she has bade
To a grand Fancy Ball for the benefit of Trade.

Dost n’t think, dearest SARAH, thee 'st feel migh half dead,
And would'st own, howsoever thy toil used to tire,
Thee wast out of the fryingpan into the fire?”
“Oh, WILLIAM, thee'st open'd my eyes,” she replied,
“Content with my lot I will henceforth abide;
I’d rather go a-milking in the meadows so green,
Than change my situation with HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN.”
THE COFFEE-HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Two mighty subjects, on Thursday evening last, divided and absorbed
the attention of the House of Commons—the Metropolis Water Bill,
and the Chicory question. Had the debates on these momentous topics
come to a satisfactory issue, the House would have presented us, as the
result of a night's work, with the materials for making a good cup of
coffee; but, as the Water Bill was read a second time, and MR.T. BARING's
anti-chicory motion rejected, the end of all that legislative labouris, the
decision that we are still to be deprived of the two principal conditions
to the goodness of the beverage in question. e are to continue
taking the mixture as before, having bad coffee and impure water to
make it with. It is to be regretted that MR. BARING's motion mis-
carried, for though it did not materially involve the destinies of the
Empire, yet everybody who knows the nature of coffee grounds, must
allow it to have been well grounded.
Change of Entertainment at the Mansion House.
THE Conversatione given the other evening at the Mansion House is
an innovation in the style of civic entertainment, which has caused
many worthy citizens to tremble for the interests of the Corporation.
It is feared that the banyan feast of reason and the teetotal flow of
soul will supersede the banquet of turtle and venison, and the circu-
lation of the loving-cup and milk-punch bottle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BLACK DIAMOND–THE REAL MOUNTAIN
OF LIGHT!!
THE SLANDERED CHURCH IN TUSCANY.
To Mr. Punch.
“My very DEAR SIR,
“Of course you are aware of the latest deception which, in
order to discredit the only genuine º has been practised by the
Enemy of Mankind upon, the British public. I allude to the fiction
ublished, last Saturday, by the Evil One, through the medium of the
aminer, that Count Piero GuiccIARDINI, and six other persons,
after having been confined ten days, have been sentenced, by the
Florentine Court of Prefecture, to forced residence in the Tuscan
Maremme; the Count for having read and expounded a chapter in the
Gospel of St. John, as translated by DIoDATI; and his companions
for having listened to him: his reading and comment having, in the
words of the judicial decree,
“Had no other purpose than mutually to insinuate into the parties religious senti-
ments and principles contrary to those prescribed by the Roman Catholic Apostolic
Religion.”
“To be sure, the Prince of Darkness, to render this hoax a little less
transparent, affects to admit that
“Six of the condemned have been since permitted to leave Tuscany, instead of
undergoing the penalty of compulsory residence in the unwholesome Maremme.”
“But I need hardly say that the story is quite as absurd as that of
the tyrannical conduct of the Church in Sardinia, or of the intolerant
concordat which the Pope is pretended to have made with Spain, or
any other of the falsehoods which, in support of, the rººf
Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill, the arch deceiver's craftily putting fort
every week or so,
“You know, and I know, my very dear Sir, that all these fabrications
are particularly calculated to excite indignation and contempt against
MR. REYNoLDs, MR. Keogh, MR. MooRE, and the rest of those mode:
rate, reasonable, honest, loyal, patriotic, and consistently liberal
gentlemen, who constitute what is derisively termed the Irish Brigade
in the House of Commons. To exhibit them, with professions of zeal
for religious liberty on their lips, pertinaciously contending day by day
for the supremacy of that very papal power, which, almost as often,
manifests its determined hostility, to freedom of conscience, is
necessarily to place them before the eyes of Protestant heretics
in as utterly despicable, and odious a light as a band of shameless
hypocrites can possibly be regarded with... But, Sir, the Adversary
is not quite so clever as he thinks himself. I will take him by the
horns. I will suppose that his GUIccIARDINI story is true; nay, that
the heretical Count has been burnt alive, instead of having been sent
to die of fever in the Maremme. It is needless to repeat that the
supposition is most extravagant—that the Church never opposed heresy
with aught warmer than eloquence: let us entertain it, for the sake of
argument. Imaintain that in having burnt Guiccia RDINI, or any other
* the Church would not have been guilty of persecution in the
east.
“Persecution is the opposition of power to religion... Any other creed
than the true religion is no religion at all. Consequently, the opposition
of 5. to such creed is not persecution. The Roman Catholic religion
is the only true one; and there is no such thing as persecution, except
oppºsition to that only true religion. ...*
‘It is not persecution to put down º or to prohibit the
worship of Juggernaut. All heresy, in its ultimate consequences, is
equally permicious, and to invoke the sword of the magistrate inst
Protestantism, is no more persecution on the part of the Roman
Church, than it would be on that of the British Legislature to interdict
the sanguinary practices of Indian superstition. -
“Nay, further, since the final misery of any one heretic will be as
intense in º as infinite in duration, it will indefinitely, exceed
any amount of suffering that can possibly be inflicted on any limited,
however large, numbers of human beings, in any given time, however
long. Therefore, the very largest, holocaust of heretics imaginable,
roasted by the slowest of conceivable fires—the heresy of the victims
being supposed to be desperate—must, if it should deter but one of the
faithful from falling into error—be an immeasurable economy of pain:
and thus a proportionate act of mercy. To rescue one soul from
the snares of heresy, it were a charity to burn all the rest of mankind
alive; and if this proceeding were necessary, the only persecution there
could be in the case, would be the prevention of a consistent Church
from developing its system of beneficence, and carrying out its theory of
love. Believeme, my very dear Sir,
“Yours truthfully,
“WERAx.”

specimens of the “British tradesman,” the “British public.loves to

marigold, wheat, and vegetables, instead of coffee; and that, in fact,
our ºne old delicious Mocha” has been, to use an obvious, if not an
aged pun, a fine old delicious mockery, -
In a little work on “Coffee and its Adulterations,” published at the
Lancet Office, we have what we might appropriately, term “a Coffee
Dictionary,” in which we get thereal meaning, as tested by examination,
of the stuff sold under the various denominations of coffee in London.
We give an extract from this interesting piece of commercial
lexicography:-
Delicious Coffee. Roasted beans and chicory forming one-third of
the article. -
Finest Berlice Coffee. About one half coffee, much chicory, and
some wheat.
Splendid Turkey Coffee. About one half coffee, the rest chicory.
Fine Plantation Cºffee. One-third coffee, the rest chicory, with a little
roasted corn.
Parisian Coffee. Principally chicory and corn; very little coffee.
Rich Drinking Coffee. One-third coffee, the rest chicory, with some
roasted corn.
Delicious Family %. One-fourth coffee, three-fourths chicory.
#: Java Coffee. Much chicory, and some roasted potato; very little
collee.
Coffee as in France. Principally chicory.
The above definitions will supply, a key to those highly-figurative
labels which greet our eyes in the shop-windows of the grocers; an
we shall know in future that when we are invited to try the “Fine
Java” at 18.11:d, we are simply asked to purchase, some roasted
potatoes and marigolds, at nearly 28, a pound, when potatoes are dull
at #d, and marigolds may be had in the fields for the trouble of º:
them. When we observe an announcement, that “This is the note
shop for the DELIcious Coffee at twenty pence,” we shall, henceforth
feeſ assured that for our twenty pence we shall get upwards of half-a-
pound of beans, and other less valuable commodities, with about one-
third of the article we are supposed to be purchasing.
It seems, however, that use has become such a second mature with
the public, who are accustomed to drink all sorts of trash under the
name of coffee, that, out-eeling the eels, they are not only accustomed
to be skinned, but insist on having the process applied to them.
Tradesmen write to the Chancellor of the 1xchequer, declaring they
have been serving chicory so long, that º have educated their cus-
tomers up to it; and if the latter are supplied with genuine coffee, at
two shillings a pound, they send it back, indignantly demanding the
old stuff they have been accustomed to.
We presume that the success of the Chicory chicanery, will encou-
rage other tradesmen to come out equally strong; and we shall have
the sausage-dealers openly announcing that the sausage-consumer will
not be satisfied without a good smack of the feline flavour in his
sausages. The milkman will renounce all pretence to the keeping of a
cow, and will inform the world unblushingly, that if he were to send
out anything else than horse-brains, chalk, and water, he should have
the article thrown back upon his hands by his indignant customers.
The water companies, too, will protest against any interference with
their present monopoly of the rich unctuous wash, that the public, will
insist on paying for under the guise of water; and we shall be told, no
doubt, that, having been accustomed to a full-bodied fluid-full of the
bodies of animalcules—they would not be satisfied with the purer ele-
ment. It is, at all events, a step in the right direction, that things are
beginning to be called by their F. names, and all we askis, that
if the public like chicory instead of coffee, it should be sold as chicory;
that, if sausage-eaters will be dogmatic in their tastes, the sausages
should be sold under their right appellation; and that, if the community
like to drink Thames wash, it should be classed under the head of
Sewer's Rate, instead of Water Rate.
STANZAS ON THE INCOME-TAX QUESTION.
To the CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequeſt and others.
AH! why inquiry wouldst thou shirk
On Industry’s unjust taxation?
Wherefore so anxious, Wood, to burke
The Income-Tax investigation?
That tax, which, under Schedule D.,
Is so atrocious an infliction,
That—if we can’t evade it—we
All pay it with a malediction.
And GLADstone, CARDwell, HERRIEs, GRAHAM,
Oh! tell a class that claims your pity,
On what account, in Goodness' name,
You will not serve on HUME's Committee?
Sure you, at least, SIR. JAMEs, might try,
If equal justice can’t be meted,
Toletus “know the reason why.”
We must continue to be cheated.
What, are there, men of property,
You who have fixed the tax on Income,
Facts which you’re not inclined to see
And therefore are resolved to blink 'em P
Think you the inquest would declare
The simple truth to all beholders,
The burden which you ought to bear
That you have clapp'd on others' shoulders?
A CHEERFUL DWELLING.
MANY persons entertain curious notions of cheerfulness...A house:
agent advertises in the Times a “cheerful Dwelling,” which of all
cheerful places is situate in Newgate Street. Now the cheerfulness of
Newgate Street must be on a par with that of Greenwich, Fair on a
Whit. or rather a Wet-Monday. The prospect of the Qld Bailey, from
the drawing-room windows must be most delightful to the mind that is
fond of cheerful associations! But we imagine, after all, that the cheer-
fulness must be especially intended for the class of Lord Tom NoDDIes,
who are fond of capital punishments. The sight of an execution is, we
know, to them a capit º and possesses charms which the same
ersons would in vain look for on the Surrey Hills, or any otherstanding
eature of cheerfulness in lodging advertisements. Viewed in this light, a
d|balcony in Newgate Street must rank higher than the Hanging Gardens
of Babylon, and could only be equalled in cheerfulness by the banks of
the South-Western Railway when an express-train of prize-fighters is
dodging up and down the line all day in search of a retired spot where
they can establish a “ º little mill.” On a Monday especially, with
the Gibbet standing out boldly in the foreground, there can be no place
out of the Agapemone half so “cheerful” as Newgate Street. We
wonder what the rent is?

THE PICK. LOCK QUESTION.
NDouBTEDLY, ingenuity and science are
all very well, but we do not like, to
see them taking the direction of skill
in housebreaking. MEssRs. BRAMAH
AND CHUBB are inviting all the world
to pick—and choose—their Locks;
and as art always invites imitation,
we have no doubt that the taste for
lock-picking—which is already quite
common enough—will extend among
a class where perfection in the opera-
tion is not at all to be desired. It is
said that an American gentleman is
now in town for the purpose of pick-
ing MR. BRAMAH's celebrated Picca-
dilly Lock, and we have good autho-
rity for stating, that several less
respectable individuals are also now
“in town” for lock-picking purposes.
Among the arrivals by the railway
last week was BILL bº. the
celebrated Lancashire cracksman,
who purposes a series of experiments
. . on all sorts of locks, during the pre-
sent season; while all the principal Metropolitan artists in the same
line are, of course, upon their metal—that is to say, upon the metal
of the locksmiths. .
As lock-picking is now being cultivated as a science, we begin
to fear that the º may hesitate to interfere, when they see an
individual engaged in an ingenious operation on a street-door; and
who, if interrupted by the force, may protest against any obstruction
being thrown in the way of an artistic experiment. Juries may hesitate
to commit, and judges may be reluctant to sentence, an individual who,
having been taken in the act of picking a lock and entering a house, may
plead that they were worked up by the pick-lock controversy now going
on in the newspapers, to try their own hands at an achievement, which,
from the high characters of the persons engaged in it, ought to be
thoroughly respectable. To be found with skeleton keys in one's pos-
session has, hitherto, been deemed an offence; but those implements
may, henceforth, be quite as characteristic of the man of science as
of the housebreaker.
A WOICE FROM THE JEWEL CAGE IN THE CRYSTAL
PALACE.
“MB. PUNCH,
. “STONEs are allowed to cry out, on great provocation. As
a precious stone, I avail myself of that privilege. The French have an
opera called Les Diamans de la Couronne; and some persons, whether
or not, after the too common fashion of English dramatists, in imitation
of their neighbours, I do not know, have been getting up a farce which
may be entitled The Crown Diamonds. Of this facetious production I
find myself made the hero, to my great annoyance. Some get up one
fine morning and find themselves famous. The other day, I rose from
out my safe, and discovered myself to have lost my reputation; I, who
till lately was the cynosure of all the brightest eyes in the Exhibition,
am now a mark for the finger of scorn. # is said aloud, in my hearing,
that I am a hoax, a hum, no Mountain of Light, but a lump of glass–
punsters call me a transparent imposture. After having passed from
throne to throne, from dynasty to dynasty, unsullied for a moment by
the breath of suspicion, to have my pretensions called in question by
the populace in Hyde Park, is too much. I fondly hoped I had taken
the shine out of the prerogative of merc i. and was regularly
installed as the brightest jewel of the I. Crown.
“I was grievously treated in my cutting, for which I was avenged;
but, alas! for European justice, there is nobody to be impaled, or
hanged, or even beheaded, for inflicting on me this unkindest cut of all.
Steps, it is true, are to be taken to vindicate my good name, which is
the immediate, jewel of my soul—or essence as a gem. I am to be
lighted up with gas, in order that my coruscations may proclaim me to
be veritable crystallised carbon. This is treating me with indignity,
Mr. Punch : no meaner...radiance than the flashes of your wit can
I allow to be worthy to illuminate
“THE Koh-i-Noor.

wretch, the Knave of Diamonds.”

THE FORCE OF EXAMPLE.
Wr, are happy to be able to record an extraordinary instance of
liberality on the part of MR. DUNUP, who seems to have entered com-
pletely into the current of benevolence that has had its source in the
Great Exhibition. , Having heard that employers generally are enabling
those in their service to visit the Crystal Palace, §. DUNUP called for
his laundress's account up to quarter-day last, and finding a balance
due to her of ten pounds three, he liberally paid off the odd shillings—
as an instalment—to enable her to visit the Great Exhibition.
MR., BRIEFLEss has in view a financial operation of some intricacy,
that will allow him to give his clerk the advantage of seeing the World’s
Fair in a day or two. It would be premature, perhaps, to explain the
nature of the arrangement proposed, but we can say with confidence that
it will be on the basis of mutual accommodation. MR. BRIEFLEss, fol-
lowing the example of the Government with regard to colonial Judges
who during leave of absence forfeit half their salaries, will possibl call
". his clerk to forfeit half his week's salary during a week's ºil.
which will place half-a-crown at the disposal of MR. BRIEFLEss. Out
of this fund the learned gentleman will call upon his clerk to hand over
one shilling only in ready cash, leaving him one-and-sixpence for himself,
which will enable him to spend a day at the Crystal Palace.

LEAVES FROM THE LOG OF H.M.S. “PRINCE
OF WALES.”
(Flag Ship on the Serpentine Station.)
THE Gallant ADMIRAL BENBow HAZY continues still in excellent
health. His nautical operations have been pursued with extraordinary
activity. . He recently invited several officers of his own standing to
inspect the Fleet under his command. There assembled on the
interesting occasion, HIGSBY, LYER DE MAINE, RANSFORD GRIGG, &c.
Soon after their arrival, a signal was made for the fleet to weigh and
stand towards Knightsbridge. The Prince of Wales took the lead,
and was followed in line by, the various punts and dingeys of the
squadron. At 11.15 the signal was made by ADMIRAL HAZY to “tack
together.” In performing this manºeuvre, however, the punt Snob
missed stays, , and falling athwart the bows of the dingey Lubber,
carried away her jib-boom. Here arose (says our own correspondent)
“ascene of indescribable confusion.” Of course, he goes on to describe
it, accordingly; but all we gather from his account is, that there was
a general scene, of “backing” and “hauling; ” that something was
“carried away,” which does not appear to have been brought back
again; that, one vessel “wore, to take the strain off her fore-mast,
having lost her bobstays;” with other particulars only suited to boat-
swains, and the learned civilians of the Admiralty Court. ADMIRAL
HAZY severely reprimanded everybody concerned; and soon after the
fleet came to an anchor, and the Admiral and his friends went to lunch.
It would be in vain to conceal that this great and good officer, how-
ever, was not long in his command before he wanted to go on shore.
At first stern, sentiments of duty, kept him on the bosom of the
Serpentine, which bounded beneath him “like a certain animal “that
knows its rider,” as BYRON says. Presently, he began to find that duty
required him to visit land. Circumstances didn't render it at all
necessary that he should fire on anybody, as he had first anticipated.
For some time, he dosed at night, in imitation of Collingwood, on a
carronade, slide; but this enthusiasm wore away (to say nothing of his
aleto's doing the same from the effects of it), and he began to ensconce
#. snugly in his berth, . At his first visit, to, the shore, he was
leased to express himself highly gratified with the Crystal Palace.
e was induced to visit “Malta” by old associations; and, curiously
enough, the particular old association, known as PAOLO AND Tickló,
a firm in Strada Detto, met, the gallant officer wandering there. The
eye which had never quailed in battle was here, for an instant, dis-
composed; but he soon, we understand, “recovered;” which MEssRs.
P. and T., however, have not yet succeeded in doing.
Since the above was written, we have received an account of a Court
Martial wiich was held on the captain and officers of H.M. Punt
Snob, for the loss of that vessel in a gale of wind on the coast of
Kensington. , She struck about 10 p.m. ... It was a subject of inquiry
whether the lead had been kept going....The Court met on board the
Prince of Wales, with all due formalities, each member wearing his
largest cocked hat... A four-pounder was fired (at a cost of fourpence),
at 8 a.m., and a Union Jack hoisted at the peak. It appeared from the
evidence that there was nobody in the chains at the time, the vessel
grounded; that the captain and master were of opinion that the vessel
was then in deep water, and acted accordingly; while the Admiralty
charts distinctly announced “deep water, dead dogs, and old hats,”
as descriptive of the spot. One witness, was of opinion that the
accident was attributable to the captain's having mistaken the light
from the bull's eye of a policeman for the well-known red light of
Knightsbridge Point. This witness, however, going against high
functionaries, was warned to be “very careful,” and soon contradicted
himself accordingly. Soon after (in conformity with naval precedents)
the captain and master were “honourably acquitted,” while the
inferiors generally were severely reprimanded.
Premium on Imposition.
OMITTING the º: heading of “Singular Infatuation,” the
Times announced the other day that
“The ChaxcELLOR of THE Exchequeh has received from ‘H. J." the first halves of
Bank notes for £50 and £20 due for Income-Tax.”
It may be all very well to pay the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
his due; but all other creditors should be satisfied first. Every person
liable to Income-Tax owes a debt to the public, which is, to pay no
more of that monstrous impost than he is forced to pay, until its in-
equalities have been adjusted, or at least till Ministers have made that
inquiry as to the possibility of such adjustment which they are trying
to shirk. To send the CHANcellor of the Exchequer the halves of
Bank notes for £70, due for Income-Tax, is, at this juncture, to en-
courage him in the attempt to stifle the investigation.

with respect to costume, and only as

the beauties of Washington and New

gowns, furbelows, flounces, and all other .
parts of dress to those garments, adorn-

have taken to go about in green and

commonly worn by the ladies of Con-

American ladies, must be prepared to
submit to the consequence of taking to Turkish trousers; which,
considered as female wear, are by no means the tokens of woman's

STATE OF FARMS FOR MAY.
(From “Punch's" own Protectionist Reporter.)
THROUGHOUT the length, and breadth, and depth of the land, farms
are every day being thrown up: cast back to the hands of the bewil-
dered landlords.
In Surrey, last week, a wild pigeon's nest was taken in the deserted
chimney of a farm-house that had been in the same family for two
centuries.
The white owl has, in more than half-a-dozen instances, been heard
hooting from the cupboards and pantries of deserted homesteads.
... A hare, with a litter of ten leverets, was a few days since discovered
in the kitchen range of a farm-house in Sussex.
Nothing is now more common than to find foxes on the hearth-stones
of bankrupt, houseless yeomen; whilst more than one pole-cat has been
scented in what was once the smiling and abundant dairy of the British
milkmaid.
In one morning's ride not less than twenty farms were counted by
the present writer as in the undisturbed possession of gipsies and
trampers.
Nothing can equal the aspect of desolation throughout the country.
A few enthusiasts, in the insane endeavour to compete with the
foreigner, have laid a few acres under cultivation; but the general
appearance of the land is that of weeds—weeds—weeds.
Where the corn was wont to spring, there is now couch-grass—where
barley would begin blithely to bristſ, chickweed and groundsel usurp
the ground—where oats would promise to wave, the insidious dandelion
threatens to over-run the soil.
Should any beneficial change occur—though it would be worse than
madness, it would be treason to hold out any hope of improvement—
it will with gladness be recorded by your present reporter; who may
confidentially state, that no less than five hundred farmers with their
families may, in the course of the summer, be expected to be “spoken
with ” in their way from England to America.

AT THE FOUNTAIN IN THE
CRYSTAL PALACE.
WITH a mixture of pain
and pleasure, Punch read in
the Times, that the country
folk who visited the Exhibi-
tion on Whit-Monday, hav-
ing carried provisions with
them, were seen in various
parts of the building taking
their food, out of , their
baskets, eating it with, avi-
dity, and washing it down
with copious draughts of
water from the nearest foun-
tain. This half-and-half feel-
ing in the mind of Punch
is excited by the reflection
that whilst enjoying their
solid cheer, the goodſ º
had nothing to drink but
water. Could not the foun-
tains be made to run beer?

dantly paying, and might
well defray the expenses of
